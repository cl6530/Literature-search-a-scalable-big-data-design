        "Martine one morning obtained from Dr. Pascal, as she did every three\nmonths, his receipt for fifteen hundred francs, to take it to the\nnotary Grandguillot, to get from him what she called their “income.\"\nThe doctor seemed surprised that the payment should have fallen due\nagain so soon; he had never been so indifferent as he was now about\nmoney matters, leaving to Martine the care of settling everything. And\nhe and Clotilde were under the plane trees, absorbed in the joy that\nfilled their life, lulled by the ceaseless song of the fountain, when\nthe servant returned with a frightened face, and in a state of\nextraordinary agitation. She was so breathless with excitement that\nfor a moment she could not speak.",
        "“Oh, my God! Oh, my God!” she cried at last. “M. Grandguillot has gone\naway!”",
        "Pascal did not at first comprehend.",
        "“Well, my girl, there is no hurry,” he said; “you can go back another\nday.”",
        "“No, no! He has gone away; don’t you hear? He has gone away forever–”",
        "And as the waters rush forth in the bursting of a dam, her emotion\nvented itself in a torrent of words.",
        "“I reached the street, and I saw from a distance a crowd gathered\nbefore the door. A chill ran through me; I felt that some misfortune\nhad happened. The door closed, and not a blind open, as if there was\nsomebody dead in the house. They told me when I got there that he had\nrun away; that he had not left a sou behind him; that many families\nwould be ruined.”",
        "She laid the receipt on the stone table.",
        "“There! There is your paper! It is all over with us, we have not a sou\nleft, we are going to die of starvation!” And she sobbed aloud in the\nanguish of her miserly heart, distracted by this loss of a fortune,\nand trembling at the prospect of impending want.",
        "Clotilde sat stunned and speechless, her eyes fixed on Pascal, whose\npredominating feeling at first seemed to be one of incredulity. He\nendeavored to calm Martine. Why! why! it would not do to give up in\nthis way. If all she knew of the affair was what she had heard from\nthe people in the street, it might be only gossip, after all, which\nalways exaggerates everything. M. Grandguillot a fugitive; M.\nGrandguillot a thief; that was monstrous, impossible! A man of such\nprobity, a house liked and respected by all Plassans for more than a\ncentury past. Why people thought money safer there than in the Bank of\nFrance.",
        "“Consider, Martine, this would not have come all of a sudden, like a\nthunderclap; there would have been some rumors of it beforehand. The\ndeuce! an old reputation does not fall to pieces in that way, in a\nnight.”",
        "At this she made a gesture of despair.",
        "“Ah, monsieur, that is what most afflicts me, because, you see, it\nthrows some of the responsibility on me. For weeks past I have been\nhearing stories on all sides. As for you two, naturally you hear\nnothing; you don’t even know whether you are alive or dead.”",
        "Neither Pascal nor Clotilde could refrain from smiling; for it was\nindeed true that their love lifted them so far above the earth that\nnone of the common sounds of existence reached them.",
        "“But the stories I heard were so ugly that I didn’t like to worry you\nwith them. I thought they were lies.”",
        "She was silent for a moment, and then added that while some people\nmerely accused M. Grandguillot of having speculated on the Bourse,\nthere were others who accused him of still worse practises. And she\nburst into fresh sobs.",
        "“My God! My God! what is going to become of us? We are all going to\ndie of starvation!”",
        "Shaken, then, moved by seeing Clotilde’s eyes, too, filled with tears,\nPascal made an effort to remember, to see clearly into the past. Years\nago, when he had been practising in Plassans, he had deposited at\ndifferent times, with M. Grandguillot, the twenty thousand francs on\nthe interest of which he had lived comfortably for the past sixteen\nyears, and on each occasion the notary had given him a receipt for the\nsum deposited. This would no doubt enable him to establish his\nposition as a personal creditor. Then a vague recollection awoke in\nhis memory; he remembered, without being able to fix the date, that at\nthe request of the notary, and in consequence of certain\nrepresentations made by him, which Pascal had forgotten, he had given\nthe lawyer a power of attorney for the purpose of investing the whole\nor a part of his money, in mortgages, and he was even certain that in\nthis power the name of the attorney had been left in blank. But he was\nignorant as to whether this document had ever been used or not; he had\nnever taken the trouble to inquire how his money had been invested. A\nfresh pang of miserly anguish made Martine cry out:",
        "“Ah, monsieur, you are well punished for your sin. Was that a way to\nabandon one’s money? For my part, I know almost to a sou how my\naccount stands every quarter; I have every figure and every document\nat my fingers’ ends.”",
        "In the midst of her distress an unconscious smile broke over her face,\nlighting it all up. Her long cherished passion had been gratified; her\nfour hundred francs wages, saved almost intact, put out at interest\nfor thirty years, at last amounted to the enormous sum of twenty\nthousand francs. And this treasure was put away in a safe place which\nno one knew. She beamed with delight at the recollection, and she said\nno more.",
        "“But who says that our money is lost?” cried Pascal.",
        "“M. Grandguillot had a private fortune; he has not taken away with him\nhis house and his lands, I suppose. They will look into the affair;\nthey will make an investigation. I cannot make up my mind to believe\nhim a common thief. The only trouble is the delay: a liquidation drags\non so long.”",
        "He spoke in this way in order to reassure Clotilde, whose growing\nanxiety he observed. She looked at him, and she looked around her at\nLa Souleiade; her only care his happiness; her most ardent desire to\nlive here always, as she had lived in the past, to love him always in\nthis beloved solitude. And he, wishing to tranquilize her, recovered\nhis fine indifference; never having lived for money, he did not\nimagine that one could suffer from the want of it.",
        "“But I have some money!” he cried, at last. “What does Martine mean by\nsaying that we have not a sou left, and that we are going to die of\nstarvation!”",
        "And he rose gaily, and made them both follow him saying:",
        "“Come, come, I am going to show you some money. And I will give some\nof it to Martine that she may make us a good dinner this evening.”",
        "Upstairs in his room he triumphantly opened his desk before them. It\nwas in a drawer of this desk that for years past he had thrown the\nmoney which his later patients had brought him of their own accord,\nfor he had never sent them an account. Nor had he ever known the exact\namount of his little treasure, of the gold and bank bills mingled\ntogether in confusion, from which he took the sums he required for his\npocket money, his experiments, his presents, and his alms. During the\nlast few months he had made frequent visits to his desk, making deep\ninroads into its contents. But he had been so accustomed to find there\nthe sums he required, after years of economy during which he had spent\nscarcely anything, that he had come to believe his savings\ninexhaustible.",
        "He gave a satisfied laugh, then, as he opened the drawer, crying:",
        "“Now you shall see! Now you shall see!”",
        "And he was confounded, when, after searching among the heap of notes\nand bills, he succeeded in collecting only a sum of 615 francs–two\nnotes of 100 francs each, 400 francs in gold, and 15 francs in change.\nHe shook out the papers, he felt in every corner of the drawer,\ncrying:",
        "“But it cannot be! There was always money here before, there was a\nheap of money here a few days ago. It must have been all those old\nbills that misled me. I assure you that last week I saw a great deal\nof money. I had it in my hand.”",
        "He spoke with such amusing good faith, his childlike surprise was so\nsincere, that Clotilde could not keep from smiling. Ah, the poor\nmaster, what a wretched business man he was! Then, as she observed\nMartine’s look of anguish, her utter despair at sight of this\ninsignificant sum, which was now all there was for the maintenance of\nall three, she was seized with a feeling of despair; her eyes filled\nwith tears, and she murmured:",
        "“My God, it is for me that you have spent everything; if we have\nnothing now, if we are ruined, it is I who am the cause of it!”",
        "Pascal had already forgotten the money he had taken for the presents.\nEvidently that was where it had gone. The explanation tranquilized\nhim. And as she began to speak in her grief of returning everything to\nthe dealers, he grew angry.",
        "“Give back what I have given you! You would give a piece of my heart\nwith it, then! No, I would rather die of hunger, I tell you!”",
        "Then his confidence already restored, seeing a future of unlimited\npossibilities opening out before him, he said:",
        "“Besides, we are not going to die of hunger to-night, are we, Martine?\nThere is enough here to keep us for a long time.”",
        "Martine shook her head. She would undertake to manage with it for two\nmonths, for two and a half, perhaps, if people had sense, but not\nlonger. Formerly the drawer was replenished; there was always some\nmoney coming in; but now that monsieur had given up his patients, they\nhad absolutely no income. They must not count on any help from\noutside, then. And she ended by saying:",
        "“Give me the two one-hundred-franc bills. I’ll try and make them last\nfor a month. Then we shall see. But be very prudent; don’t touch the\nfour hundred francs in gold; lock the drawer and don’t open it again.”",
        "“Oh, as to that,” cried the doctor, “you may make your mind easy. I\nwould rather cut off my right hand.”",
        "And thus it was settled. Martine was to have entire control of this\nlast purse; and they might trust to her economy, they were sure that\nshe would save the centimes. As for Clotilde, who had never had a\nprivate purse, she would not even feel the want of money. Pascal only\nwould suffer from no longer having his inexhaustible treasure to draw\nupon, but he had given his promise to allow the servant to buy\neverything.",
        "“There! That is a good piece of work!” he said, relieved, as happy as\nif he had just settled some important affair which would assure them a\nliving for a long time to come.",
        "A week passed during which nothing seemed to have changed at La\nSouleiade. In the midst of their tender raptures neither Pascal nor\nClotilde thought any more of the want which was impending. And one\nmorning during the absence of the latter, who had gone with Martine to\nmarket, the doctor received a visit which filled him at first with a\nsort of terror. It was from the woman who had sold him the beautiful\ncorsage of old point d’Alencon, his first present to Clotilde. He felt\nhimself so weak against a possible temptation that he trembled. Even\nbefore the woman had uttered a word he had already begun to defend\nhimself–no, no, he neither could nor would buy anything. And with\noutstretched hands he prevented her from taking anything out of her\nlittle bag, declaring to himself that he would look at nothing. The\ndealer, however, a fat, amiable woman, smiled, certain of victory. In\nan insinuating voice she began to tell him a long story of how a lady,\nwhom she was not at liberty to name, one of the most distinguished\nladies in Plassans, who had suddenly met with a reverse of fortune,\nhad been obliged to part with one of her jewels; and she then enlarged\non the splendid chance–a piece of jewelry that had cost twelve\nhundred francs, and she was willing to let it go for five hundred. She\nopened her bag slowly, in spite of the terrified and ever-louder\nprotestations of the doctor, and took from it a slender gold necklace\nset simply with seven pearls in front; but the pearls were of\nwonderful brilliancy–flawless, and perfect in shape. The ornament was\nsimple, chaste, and of exquisite delicacy. And instantly he saw in\nfancy the necklace on Clotilde’s beautiful neck, as its natural\nadornment. Any other jewel would have been a useless ornament, these\npearls would be the fitting symbol of her youth. And he took the\nnecklace in his trembling fingers, experiencing a mortal anguish at\nthe idea of returning it. He defended himself still, however; he\ndeclared that he had not five hundred francs, while the dealer\ncontinued, in her smooth voice, to push the advantage she had gained.\nAfter another quarter an hour, when she thought she had him secure,\nshe suddenly offered him the necklace for three hundred francs, and he\nyielded; his mania for giving, his desire to please his idol, to adorn\nher, conquered. When he went to the desk to take the fifteen gold\npieces to count them out to the dealer, he felt convinced that the\nnotary’s affairs would be arranged, and that they would soon have\nplenty of money.",
        "When Pascal found himself once more alone, with the ornament in his\npocket, he was seized with a childish delight, and he planned his\nlittle surprise, while waiting, excited and impatient, for Clotilde’s\nreturn. The moment she made her appearance his heart began to beat\nviolently. She was very warm, for an August sun was blazing in the\nsky, and she laid aside her things quickly, pleased with her walk,\ntelling him, laughing, of the good bargain Martine had made–two\npigeons for eighteen sous. While she was speaking he pretended to\nnotice something on her neck.",
        "“Why, what have you on your neck? Let me see.”",
        "He had the necklace in his hand, and he succeeded in putting it around\nher neck, while feigning to pass his fingers over it, to assure\nhimself that there was nothing there. But she resisted, saying gaily:",
        "“Don’t! There is nothing on my neck. Here, what are you doing? What\nhave you in your hand that is tickling me?”",
        "He caught hold of her, and drew her before the long mirror, in which\nshe had a full view of herself. On her neck the slender chain showed\nlike a thread of gold, and the seven pearls, like seven milky stars,\nshone with soft luster against her satin skin. She looked charmingly\nchildlike. Suddenly she gave a delighted laugh, like the cooing of a\ndove swelling out its throat proudly.",
        "“Oh, master, master, how good you are! Do you think of nothing but me,\nthen? How happy you make me!”",
        "And the joy which shone in her eyes, the joy of the woman and the\nlover, happy to be beautiful and to be adored, recompensed him\ndivinely for his folly.",
        "She drew back her head, radiant, and held up her mouth to him. He bent\nover and kissed her.",
        "“Are you happy?”",
        "“Oh, yes, master, happy, happy! Pearls are so sweet, so pure! And\nthese are so becoming to me!”",
        "For an instant longer she admired herself in the glass, innocently\nvain of her fair flower-like skin, under the nacre drops of the\npearls. Then, yielding to a desire to show herself, hearing the\nservant moving about outside, she ran out, crying:",
        "“Martine, Martine! See what master has just given me! Say, am I not\nbeautiful!”",
        "But all at once, seeing the old maid’s severe face, that had suddenly\nturned an ashen hue, she became confused, and all her pleasure was\nspoiled. Perhaps she had a consciousness of the jealous pang which her\nbrilliant youth caused this poor creature, worn out in the dumb\nresignation of her servitude, in adoration of her master. This,\nhowever, was only a momentary feeling, unconscious in the one, hardly\nsuspected by the other, and what remained was the evident\ndisapprobation of the economical servant, condemning the present with\nher sidelong glance.",
        "Clotilde was seized with a little chill.",
        "“Only,” she murmured, “master has rummaged his desk again. Pearls are\nvery dear, are they not?”",
        "Pascal, embarrassed, too, protested volubly, telling them of the\nsplendid opportunity presented by the dealer’s visit. An incredibly\ngood stroke of business–it was impossible to avoid buying the\nnecklace.",
        "“How much?” asked the young girl with real anxiety.",
        "“Three hundred francs.”",
        "Martine, who had not yet opened her lips, but who looked terrible in\nher silence, could not restrain a cry.",
        "“Good God! enough to live upon for six weeks, and we have not bread!”",
        "Large tears welled from Clotilde’s eyes. She would have torn the\nnecklace from her neck if Pascal had not prevented her. She wished to\ngive it to him on the instant, and she faltered in heart-broken tones:",
        "“It is true, Martine is right. Master is mad, and I am mad, too, to\nkeep this for an instant, in the situation in which we are. It would\nburn my flesh. Let me take it back, I beg of you.”",
        "Never would he consent to this, he said. Now his eyes, too, were\nmoist, he joined in their grief, crying that he was incorrigible, that\nthey ought to have taken all the money away from him. And running to\nthe desk he took the hundred francs that were left, and forced Martine\nto take them, saying:",
        "“I tell you that I will not keep another sou. I should spend this,\ntoo. Take it, Martine; you are the only one of us who has any sense.\nYou will make the money last, I am very certain, until our affairs are\nsettled. And you, dear, keep that; do not grieve me.”",
        "Nothing more was said about this incident. But Clotilde kept the\nnecklace, wearing it under her gown; and there was a sort of\ndelightful mystery in feeling on her neck, unknown to every one, this\nsimple, pretty ornament. Sometimes, when they were alone, she would\nsmile at Pascal and draw the pearls from her dress quickly, and show\nthem to him without a word; and as quickly she would replace them\nagain on her warm neck, filled with delightful emotion. It was their\nfond folly which she thus recalled to him, with a confused gratitude,\na vivid and radiant joy–a joy which nevermore left her.",
        "A straitened existence, sweet in spite of everything, now began for\nthem. Martine made an exact inventory of the resources of the house,\nand it was not reassuring. The provision of potatoes only promised to\nbe of any importance. As ill luck would have it, the jar of oil was\nalmost out, and the last cask of wine was also nearly empty. La\nSouleiade, having neither vines nor olive trees, produced only a few\nvegetables and some fruits–pears, not yet ripe, and trellis grapes,\nwhich were to be their only delicacies. And meat and bread had to be\nbought every day. So that from the first day the servant put Pascal\nand Clotilde on rations, suppressing the former sweets, creams, and\npastry, and reducing the food to the quantity barely necessary to\nsustain life. She resumed all her former authority, treating them like\nchildren who were not to be consulted, even with regard to their\nwishes or their tastes. It was she who arranged the menus, who knew\nbetter than themselves what they wanted; but all this like a mother,\nsurrounding them with unceasing care, performing the miracle of\nenabling them to live still with comfort on their scanty resources;\noccasionally severe with them, for their own good, as one is severe\nwith a child when it refuses to eat its food. And it seemed as if this\nmaternal care, this last immolation, the illusory peace with which she\nsurrounded their love, gave her, too, a little happiness, and drew her\nout of the dumb despair into which she had fallen. Since she had thus\nwatched over them she had begun to look like her old self, with her\nlittle white face, the face of a nun vowed to chastity; her calm\nash-colored eyes, which expressed the resignation of her thirty years\nof servitude. When, after the eternal potatoes and the little cutlet at\nfour sous, undistinguishable among the vegetables, she was able, on\ncertain days, without compromising her budget, to give them pancakes,\nshe was triumphant, she laughed to see them laugh.",
        "Pascal and Clotilde thought everything she did was right, which did\nnot prevent them, however, from jesting about her when she was not\npresent. The old jests about her avarice were repeated over and over\nagain. They said that she counted the grains of pepper, so many grains\nfor each dish, in her passion for economy. When the potatoes had too\nlittle oil, when the cutlets were reduced to a mouthful, they would\nexchange a quick glance, stifling their laughter in their napkins,\nuntil she had left the room. Everything was a source of amusement to\nthem, and they laughed innocently at their misery.",
        "At the end of the first month Pascal thought of Martine’s wages.\nUsually she took her forty francs herself from the common purse which\nshe kept.",
        "“My poor girl,” he said to her one evening, “what are you going to do\nfor your wages, now that we have no more money?”",
        "She remained for a moment with her eyes fixed on the ground, with an\nair of consternation, then she said:",
        "“Well, monsieur, I must only wait.”",
        "But he saw that she had not said all that was in her mind, that she\nhad thought of some arrangement which she did not know how to propose\nto him, so he encouraged her.",
        "“Well, then, if monsieur would consent to it, I should like monsieur\nto sign me a paper.”",
        "“How, a paper?”",
        "“Yes, a paper, in which monsieur should say, every month, that he owes\nme forty francs.”",
        "Pascal at once made out the paper for her, and this made her quite\nhappy. She put it away as carefully as if it had been real money. This\nevidently tranquilized her. But the paper became a new subject of\nwondering amusement to the doctor and his companion. In what did the\nextraordinary power consist which money has on certain natures? This\nold maid, who would serve him on bended knees, who adored him above\neverything, to the extent of having devoted to him her whole life, to\nask for this silly guarantee, this scrap of paper which was of no\nvalue, if he should be unable to pay her.",
        "So far neither Pascal nor Clotilde had any great merit in preserving\ntheir serenity in misfortune, for they did not feel it. They lived\nhigh above it, in the rich and happy realm of their love. At table\nthey did not know what they were eating; they might fancy they were\npartaking of a princely banquet, served on silver dishes. They were\nunconscious of the increasing destitution around them, of the hunger\nof the servant who lived upon the crumbs from their table; and they\nwalked through the empty house as through a palace hung with silk and\nfilled with riches. This was undoubtedly the happiest period of their\nlove. The workroom had pleasant memories of the past, and they spent\nwhole days there, wrapped luxuriously in the joy of having lived so\nlong in it together. Then, out of doors, in every corner of La\nSouleiade, royal summer had set up his blue tent, dazzling with gold.\nIn the morning, in the embalsamed walks on the pine grove; at noon\nunder the dark shadow of the plane trees, lulled by the murmur of the\nfountain; in the evening on the cool terrace, or in the still warm\nthreshing yard bathed in the faint blue radiance of the first stars,\nthey lived with rapture their straitened life, their only ambition to\nlive always together, indifferent to all else. The earth was theirs,\nwith all its riches, its pomps, and its dominions, since they loved\neach other.",
        "Toward the end of August however, matters grew bad again. At times\nthey had rude awakenings, in the midst of this life without ties,\nwithout duties, without work; this life which was so sweet, but which\nit would be impossible, hurtful, they knew, to lead always. One\nevening Martine told them that she had only fifty francs left, and\nthat they would have difficulty in managing for two weeks longer, even\ngiving up wine. In addition to this the news was very serious; the\nnotary Grandguillot was beyond a doubt insolvent, so that not even the\npersonal creditors would receive anything. In the beginning they had\nrelied on the house and the two farms which the fugitive notary had\nleft perforce behind him, but it was now certain that this property\nwas in his wife’s name and, while he was enjoying in Switzerland, as\nit was said, the beauty of the mountains, she lived on one of the\nfarms, which she cultivated quietly, away from the annoyances of the\nliquidation. In short, it was infamous–a hundred families ruined;\nleft without bread. An assignee had indeed been appointed, but he had\nserved only to confirm the disaster, since not a centime of assets had\nbeen discovered. And Pascal, with his usual indifference, neglected\neven to go and see him to speak to him about his own case, thinking\nthat he already knew all that there was to be known about it, and that\nit was useless to stir up this ugly business, since there was neither\nhonor nor profit to be derived from it.",
        "Then, indeed, the future looked threatening at La Souleiade. Black\nwant stared them in the face. And Clotilde, who, in reality, had a\ngreat deal of good sense, was the first to take alarm. She maintained\nher cheerfulness while Pascal was present, but, more prescient than\nhe, in her womanly tenderness, she fell into a state of absolute\nterror if he left her for an instant, asking herself what was to\nbecome of him at his age with so heavy a burden upon his shoulders.\nFor several days she cherished in secret a project–to work and earn\nmoney, a great deal of money, with her pastels. People had so often\npraised her extraordinary and original talent that, taking Martine\ninto her confidence, she sent her one fine morning to offer some of\nher fantastic bouquets to the color dealer of the Cours Sauvaire, who\nwas a relation, it was said, of a Parisian artist. It was with the\nexpress condition that nothing was to be exhibited in Plassans, that\neverything was to be sent to a distance. But the result was\ndisastrous; the merchant was frightened by the strangeness of the\ndesign, and by the fantastic boldness of the execution, and he\ndeclared that they would never sell. This threw her into despair;\ngreat tears welled her eyes. Of what use was she? It was a grief and a\nhumiliation to be good for nothing. And the servant was obliged to\nconsole her, saying that no doubt all women were not born for work;\nthat some grew like the flowers in the gardens, for the sake of their\nfragrance; while others were the wheat of the fields that is ground up\nand used for food.",
        "Martine, meantime, cherished another project; it was to urge the\ndoctor to resume his practise. At last she mentioned it to Clotilde,\nwho at once pointed out to her the difficulty, the impossibility\nalmost, of such an attempt. She and Pascal had been talking about his\ndoing so only the day before. He, too, was anxious, and had thought of\nwork as the only chance of salvation. The idea of opening an office\nagain was naturally the first that had presented itself to him. But he\nhad been for so long a time the physician of the poor! How could he\nventure now to ask payment when it was so many years since he had left\noff doing so? Besides, was it not too late, at his age, to recommence\na career? not to speak of the absurd rumors that had been circulating\nabout him, the name which they had given him of a crack-brained\ngenius. He would not find a single patient now, it would be a useless\ncruelty to force him to make an attempt which would assuredly result\nonly in a lacerated heart and empty hands. Clotilde, on the contrary,\nhad used all her influence to turn him from the idea. Martine\ncomprehended the reasonableness of these objections, and she too\ndeclared that he must be prevented from running the risk of so great a\nchagrin. But while she was speaking a new idea occurred to her, as she\nsuddenly remembered an old register, which she had met with in a\npress, and in which she had in former times entered the doctor’s\nvisits. For a long time it was she who had kept the accounts. There\nwere so many patients who had never paid that a list of them filled\nthree of the large pages of the register. Why, then, now that they had\nfallen into misfortune, should they not ask from these people the\nmoney which they justly owed? It might be done without saying anything\nto monsieur, who had never been willing to appeal to the law. And this\ntime Clotilde approved of her idea. It was a perfect conspiracy.\nClotilde consulted the register, and made out the bills, and the\nservant presented them. But nowhere did she receive a sou; they told\nher at every door that they would look over the account; that they\nwould stop in and see the doctor himself. Ten days passed, no one\ncame, and there were now only six francs in the house, barely enough\nto live upon for two or three days longer.",
        "Martine, when she returned with empty hands on the following day from\na new application to an old patient, took Clotilde aside and told her\nthat she had just been talking with Mme. Felicite at the corner of the\nRue de la Banne. The latter had undoubtedly been watching for her. She\nhad not again set foot in La Souleiade. Not even the misfortune which\nhad befallen her son–the sudden loss of his money, of which the whole\ntown was talking–had brought her to him; she still continued stern\nand indignant. But she waited in trembling excitement, she maintained\nher attitude as an offended mother only in the certainty that she\nwould at last have Pascal at her feet, shrewdly calculating that he\nwould sooner or later be compelled to appeal to her for assistance.\nWhen he had not a sou left, when he knocked at her door, then she\nwould dictate her terms; he should marry Clotilde, or, better still,\nshe would demand the departure of the latter. But the days passed, and\nhe did not come. And this was why she had stopped Martine, assuming a\npitying air, asking what news there was, and seeming to be surprised\nthat they had not had recourse to her purse, while giving it to be\nunderstood that her dignity forbade her to take the first step.",
        "“You should speak to monsieur, and persuade him,” ended the servant.\nAnd indeed, why should he not appeal to his mother? That would be\nentirely natural.",
        "“Oh! never would I undertake such a commission,” cried Clotilde.\n“Master would be angry, and with reason. I truly believe he would die\nof starvation before he would eat grandmother’s bread.”",
        "But on the evening of the second day after this, at dinner, as Martine\nwas putting on the table a piece of boiled beef left over from the day\nbefore, she gave them notice.",
        "“I have no more money, monsieur, and to-morrow there will be only\npotatoes, without oil or butter. It is three weeks now that you have\nhad only water to drink; now you will have to do without meat.”",
        "They were still cheerful, they could still jest.",
        "“Have you salt, my good girl?”",
        "“Oh, that; yes, monsieur, there is still a little left.”",
        "“Well, potatoes and salt are very good when one is hungry.”",
        "That night, however, Pascal noticed that Clotilde was feverish; this\nwas the hour in which they exchanged confidences, and she ventured to\ntell him of her anxiety on his account, on her own, on that of the\nwhole house. What was going to become of them when all their resources\nshould be exhausted? For a moment she thought of speaking to him of\nhis mother. But she was afraid, and she contented herself with\nconfessing to him what she and Martine had done–the old register\nexamined, the bills made out and sent, the money asked everywhere in\nvain. In other circumstances he would have been greatly annoyed and\nvery angry at this confession; offended that they should have acted\nwithout his knowledge, and contrary to the attitude he had maintained\nduring his whole professional life. He remained for a long tine\nsilent, strongly agitated, and this would have sufficed to prove how\ngreat must be his secret anguish at times, under his apparent\nindifference to poverty. Then he forgave Clotilde, clasping her wildly\nto his breast, and finally he said that she had done right, that they\ncould not continue to live much longer as they were living, in a\ndestitution which increased every day. Then they fell into silence,\neach trying to think of a means of procuring the money necessary for\ntheir daily wants, each suffering keenly; she, desperate at the\nthought of the tortures that awaited him; he unable to accustom\nhimself to the idea of seeing her wanting bread. Was their happiness\nforever ended, then? Was poverty going to blight their spring with its\nchill breath?",
        "At breakfast, on the following day, they ate only fruit. The doctor\nwas very silent during the morning, a prey to a visible struggle. And\nit was not until three o’clock that he took a resolution.",
        "“Come, we must stir ourselves,” he said to his companion. “I do not\nwish you to fast this evening again; so put on your hat, we will go\nout together.”",
        "She looked at him, waiting for an explanation.",
        "“Yes, since they owe us money, and have refused to give it to you, I\nwill see whether they will also refuse to give it to me.”",
        "His hands trembled; the thought of demanding payment in this way,\nafter so many years, evidently made him suffer terribly; but he forced\na smile, he affected to be very brave. And she, who knew from the\ntrembling of his voice the extent of his sacrifice, had tears in her\neyes.",
        "“No, no, master; don’t go if it makes you suffer so much. Martine can\ngo again.”",
        "But the servant, who was present, approved highly of monsieur’s\nintention.",
        "“And why should not monsieur go? There’s no shame in asking what is\nowed to one, is there? Every one should have his own; for my part, I\nthink it quite right that monsieur should show at last that he is a\nman.”",
        "Then, as before, in their hours of happiness, old King David, as\nPascal jestingly called himself, left the house, leaning on Abishag’s\narm. Neither of them was yet in rags; he still wore his tightly\nbuttoned overcoat; she had on her pretty linen gown with red spots,\nbut doubtless the consciousness of their poverty lowered them in their\nown estimation, making them feel that they were now only two poor\npeople who occupied a very insignificant place in the world, for they\nwalked along by the houses, shunning observation. The sunny streets\nwere almost deserted. A few curious glances embarrassed them. They did\nnot hasten their steps, however; only their hearts were oppressed at\nthe thought of the visits they were about to make.",
        "Pascal resolved to begin with an old magistrate whom he had treated\nfor an affection of the liver. He entered the house, leaving Clotilde\nsitting on the bench in the Cours Sauvaire. But he was greatly\nrelieved when the magistrate, anticipating his demand, told him that\nhe did not receive his rents until October, and that he would pay him\nthen. At the house of an old lady of seventy, a paralytic, the rebuff\nwas of a different kind. She was offended because her account had been\nsent to her through a servant who had been impolite; so that he\nhastened to offer her his excuses, giving her all the time she\ndesired. Then he climbed up three flights of stairs to the apartment\nof a clerk in the tax collector’s office, whom he found still ill, and\nso poor that he did not even venture to make his demand. Then followed\na mercer, a lawyer’s wife, an oil merchant, a baker–all well-to-do\npeople; and all turned him away, some with excuses, others by denying\nhim admittance; a few even pretended not to know what he meant. There\nremained the Marquise de Valqueyras, the sole representative of a very\nancient family, a widow with a girl of ten, who was very rich, and\nwhose avarice was notorious. He had left her for the last, for he was\ngreatly afraid of her. Finally he knocked at the door of her ancient\nmansion, at the foot of the Cours Sauvaire, a massive structure of the\ntime of Mazarin. He remained so long in the house that Clotilde, who\nwas walking under the trees, at last became uneasy.",
        "When he finally made his appearance, at the end of a full half hour,\nshe said jestingly, greatly relieved:",
        "“Why, what was the matter? Had she no money?”",
        "But here, too, he had been unsuccessful; she complained that her\ntenants did not pay her.",
        "“Imagine,” he continued, in explanation of his long absence, “the\nlittle girl is ill. I am afraid that it is the beginning of a gastric\nfever. So she wished me to see the child, and I examined her.”",
        "A smile which she could not suppress came to Clotilde’s lips.",
        "“And you prescribed for her?”",
        "“Of course; could I do otherwise?”",
        "She took his arm again, deeply affected, and he felt her press it\nagainst her heart. For a time they walked on aimlessly. It was all\nover; they had knocked at every debtor’s door, and nothing now\nremained for them to do but to return home with empty hands. But this\nPascal refused to do, determined that Clotilde should have something\nmore than the potatoes and water which awaited them. When they\nascended the Cours Sauvaire, they turned to the left, to the new town;\ndrifting now whither cruel fate led them.",
        "“Listen,” said Pascal at last; “I have an idea. If I were to speak to\nRamond he would willingly lend us a thousand francs, which we could\nreturn to him when our affairs are arranged.”",
        "She did not answer at once. Ramond, whom she had rejected, who was now\nmarried and settled in a house in the new town, in a fair way to\nbecome the fashionable physician of the place, and to make a fortune!\nShe knew, indeed, that he had a magnanimous soul and a kind heart. If\nhe had not visited them again it had been undoubtedly through\ndelicacy. Whenever they chanced to meet, he saluted them with so\nadmiring an air, he seemed so pleased to see their happiness.",
        "“Would that be disagreeable to you?” asked Pascal ingenuously. For his\npart, he would have thrown open to the young physician his house, his\npurse, and his heart.",
        "“No, no,” she answered quickly. “There has never been anything between\nus but affection and frankness. I think I gave him a great deal of\npain, but he has forgiven me. You are right; we have no other friend.\nIt is to Ramond that we must apply.”",
        "Ill luck pursued them, however. Ramond was absent from home, attending\na consultation at Marseilles, and he would not be back until the\nfollowing evening. And it young Mme. Ramond, an old friend of\nClotilde’s, some three years her junior, who received them. She seemed\na little embarrassed, but she was very amiable, notwithstanding. But\nthe doctor, naturally, did not prefer his request, and contented\nhimself with saying, in explanation of his visit, that he had missed\nRamond. When they were in the street again, Pascal and Clotilde felt\nthemselves once more abandoned and alone. Where now should they turn?\nWhat new effort should they make? And they walked on again aimlessly.",
        "“I did not tell you, master,” Clotilde at last ventured to murmur,\n“but it seems that Martine met grandmother the other day. Yes,\ngrandmother has been uneasy about us. She asked Martine why we did not\ngo to her, if we were in want. And see, here is her house.”",
        "They were in fact, in the Rue de la Banne. They could see the corner\nof the Place de la Sous-Prefecture. But he at once silenced her.",
        "“Never, do you hear! Nor shall you go either. You say that because it\ngrieves you to see me in this poverty. My heart, too, is heavy, to\nthink that you also are in want, that you also suffer. But it is\nbetter to suffer than to do a thing that would leave one an eternal\nremorse. I will not. I cannot.”",
        "They emerged from the Rue de la Banne, and entered the old quarter.",
        "“I would a thousand times rather apply to a stranger. Perhaps we still\nhave friends, even if they are only among the poor.”",
        "And resolved to beg, David continued his walk, leaning on the arm of\nAbishag; the old mendicant king went from door to door, leaning on the\nshoulder of the loving subject whose youth was now his only support.\nIt was almost six o’clock; the heat had abated; the narrow streets\nwere filling with people; and in this populous quarter where they were\nloved, they were everywhere greeted with smiles. Something of pity was\nmingled with the admiration they awakened, for every one knew of their\nruin. But they seemed of a nobler beauty than before, he all white,\nshe all blond, pressing close to each other in their misfortune. They\nseemed more united, more one with each other than ever; holding their\nheads erect, proud of their glorious love, though touched by\nmisfortune; he shaken, while she, with a courageous heart, sustained\nhim. And in spite of the poverty that had so suddenly overtaken them\nthey walked without shame, very poor and very great, with the\nsorrowful smile under which they concealed the desolation of their\nsouls. Workmen in dirty blouses passed them by, who had more money in\ntheir pockets than they. No one ventured to offer them the sou which\nis not refused to those who are hungry. At the Rue Canoquin they\nstopped at the house of Gulraude. She had died the week before. Two\nother attempts which they made failed. They were reduced now to\nconsider where they could borrow ten francs. They had been walking\nabout the town for three hours, but they could not resolve to go home\nempty-handed.",
        "Ah, this Plassans, with its Cours Sauvaire, its Rue de Rome, and its\nRue de la Banne, dividing it into three quarters; this Plassans; with\nits windows always closed, this sun-baked town, dead in appearance,\nbut which concealed under this sleeping surface a whole nocturnal life\nof the clubhouse and the gaming table. They walked through it three\ntimes more with slackened pace, on this clear, calm close of a glowing\nAugust day. In the yard of the coach office a few old stage-coaches,\nwhich still plied between the town and the mountain villages, were\nstanding unharnessed; and under the thick shade of the plane trees at\nthe doors of the cafes, the customers, who were to be seen from seven\no’clock in the morning, looked after them smiling. In the new town,\ntoo, the servants came and stood at the doors of the wealthy houses;\nthey met with less sympathy here than in the deserted streets of the\nQuartier St. Marc, whose antique houses maintained a friendly silence.\nThey returned to the heart of the old quarter where they were most\nliked; they went as far as St. Saturnin, the cathedral, whose apse was\nshaded by the garden of the chapter, a sweet and peaceful solitude,\nfrom which a beggar drove them by himself asking an alms from them.\nThey were building rapidly in the neighborhood of the railway station;\na new quarter was growing up there, and they bent their steps in that\ndirection. Then they returned a last time to the Place de la\nSous-Prefecture, with a sudden reawakening of hope, thinking that they\nmight meet some one who would offer them money. But they were followed\nonly by the indulgent smile of the town, at seeing them so united and\nso beautiful. Only one woman had tears in her eyes, foreseeing,\nperhaps, the sufferings that awaited them. The stones of the Viorne,\nthe little sharp paving stones, wounded their feet. And they had at\nlast to return to La Souleiade, without having succeeded in obtaining\nanything, the old mendicant king and his submissive subject; Abishag,\nin the flower of her youth, leading back David, old and despoiled of\nhis wealth, and weary from having walked the streets in vain.",
        "It was eight o’clock, and Martine, who was waiting for them,\ncomprehended that she would have no cooking to do this evening. She\npretended that she had dined, and as she looked ill Pascal sent her at\nonce to bed.",
        "“We do not need you,” said Clotilde. “As the potatoes are on the fire\nwe can take them up very well ourselves.”",
        "The servant, who was feverish and out of humor, yielded. She muttered\nsome indistinct words–when people had eaten up everything what was\nthe use of sitting down to table? Then, before shutting herself into\nher room, she added:",
        "“Monsieur, there is no more hay for Bonhomme. I thought he was looking\nbadly a little while ago; monsieur ought to go and see him.”",
        "Pascal and Clotilde, filled with uneasiness, went to the stable. The\nold horse was, in fact, lying on the straw in the somnolence of\nexpiring old age. They had not taken him out for six months past, for\nhis legs, stiff with rheumatism, refused to support him, and he had\nbecome completely blind. No one could understand why the doctor kept\nthe old beast. Even Martine had at last said that he ought to be\nslaughtered, if only through pity. But Pascal and Clotilde cried out\nat this, as much excited as if it had been proposed to them to put an\nend to some aged relative who was not dying fast enough. No, no, he\nhad served them for more than a quarter of a century; he should die\ncomfortably with them, like the worthy fellow he had always been. And\nto-night the doctor did not scorn to examine him, as if he had never\nattended any other patients than animals. He lifted up his hoofs,\nlooked at his gums, and listened to the beating of his heart.",
        "“No, there is nothing the matter with him,” he said at last. “It is\nsimply old age. Ah, my poor old fellow, I think, indeed, we shall\nnever again travel the roads together.”",
        "The idea that there was no more hay distressed Clotilde. But Pascal\nreassured her–an animal of that age, that no longer moved about,\nneeded so little. She stooped down and took a few handfuls of grass\nfrom a heap which the servant had left there, and both were rejoiced\nwhen Bonhomme deigned, solely and simply through friendship, as it\nseemed, to eat the grass out of her hand.",
        "“Oh,” she said, laughing, “so you still have an appetite! You cannot\nbe very sick, then; you must not try to work upon our feelings. Good\nnight, and sleep well.”",
        "And they left him to his slumbers after having each given him, as\nusual, a hearty kiss on either side of his nose.",
        "Night fell, and an idea occurred to them, in order not to remain\ndownstairs in the empty house–to close up everything and eat their\ndinner upstairs. Clotilde quickly took up the dish of potatoes, the\nsalt-cellar, and a fine decanter of water; while Pascal took charge of\na basket of grapes, the first which they had yet gathered from an\nearly vine at the foot of the terrace. They closed the door, and laid\nthe cloth on a little table, putting the potatoes in the middle\nbetween the salt-cellar and the decanter, and the basket of grapes on\na chair beside them. And it was a wonderful feast, which reminded them\nof the delicious breakfast they had made on the morning on which\nMartine had obstinately shut herself up in her room, and refused to\nanswer them. They experienced the same delight as then at being alone,\nat waiting upon themselves, at eating from the same plate, sitting\nclose beside each other. This evening, which they had anticipated with\nso much dread, had in store for them the most delightful hours of\ntheir existence. As soon as they found themselves at home in the large\nfriendly room, as far removed from the town which they had just been\nscouring as if they had been a hundred leagues away from it, all\nuneasiness and all sadness vanished–even to the recollection of the\nwretched afternoon wasted in useless wanderings. They were once more\nindifferent to all that was not their affection; they no longer\nremembered that they had lost their fortune; that they might have to\nhunt up a friend on the morrow in order to be able to dine in the\nevening. Why torture themselves with fears of coming want, when all\nthey required to enjoy the greatest possible happiness was to be\ntogether?",
        "But Pascal felt a sudden terror.",
        "“My God! and we dreaded this evening so greatly! Is it wise to be\nhappy in this way? Who knows what to-morrow may have in store for us?”",
        "But she put her little hand over his mouth; she desired that he should\nhave one more evening of perfect happiness.",
        "“No, no; to-morrow we shall love each other as we love each other\nto-day. Love me with all your strength, as I love you.”",
        "And never had they eaten with more relish. She displayed the appetite\nof a healthy young girl with a good digestion; she ate the potatoes\nwith a hearty appetite, laughing, thinking them delicious, better than\nthe most vaunted delicacies. He, too, recovered the appetite of his\nyouthful days. They drank with delight deep draughts of pure water.\nThen the grapes for dessert filled them with admiration; these grapes\nso fresh, this blood of the earth which the sun had touched with gold.\nThey ate to excess; they became drunk on water and fruit, and more\nthan all on gaiety. They did not remember ever before to have enjoyed\nsuch a feast together; even the famous breakfast they had made, with\nits luxuries of cutlets and bread and wine, had not given them this\nintoxication, this joy in living, when to be together was happiness\nenough, changing the china to dishes of gold, and the miserable food\nto celestial fare such as not even the gods enjoyed.",
        "It was now quite dark, but they did not light the lamp. Through the\nwide open windows they could see the vast summer sky. The night breeze\nentered, still warm and laden with a faint odor of lavender. The moon\nhad just risen above the horizon, large and round, flooding the room\nwith a silvery light, in which they saw each other as in a dream light\ninfinitely bright and sweet.",
