        "SABBATH, n.  A weekly festival having its origin in the fact that God \nmade the world in six days and was arrested on the seventh.  Among the \nJews observance of the day was enforced by a Commandment of which this \nis the Christian version:  “Remember the seventh day to make thy \nneighbor keep it wholly.”  To the Creator it seemed fit and expedient \nthat the Sabbath should be the last day of the week, but the Early \nFathers of the Church held other views.  So great is the sanctity of \nthe day that even where the Lord holds a doubtful and precarious \njurisdiction over those who go down to (and down into) the sea it is \nreverently recognized, as is manifest in the following deep-water \nversion of the Fourth Commandment:",
        "  Six days shalt thou labor and do all thou art able,\n  And on the seventh holystone the deck and scrape the cable.",
        "  Decks are no longer holystoned, but the cable still supplies the \ncaptain with opportunity to attest a pious respect for the divine \nordinance.",
        "SACERDOTALIST, n.  One who holds the belief that a clergyman is a \npriest.  Denial of this momentous doctrine is the hardest challenge \nthat is now flung into the teeth of the Episcopalian church by the \nNeo-Dictionarians.",
        "SACRAMENT, n.  A solemn religious ceremony to which several degrees of \nauthority and significance are attached.  Rome has seven sacraments, \nbut the Protestant churches, being less prosperous, feel that they can \nafford only two, and these of inferior sanctity.  Some of the smaller \nsects have no sacraments at all — for which mean economy they will \nindubitable be damned.",
        "SACRED, adj.  Dedicated to some religious purpose; having a divine \ncharacter; inspiring solemn thoughts or emotions; as, the Dalai Lama \nof Thibet; the Moogum of M’bwango; the temple of Apes in Ceylon; the \nCow in India; the Crocodile, the Cat and the Onion of ancient Egypt; \nthe Mufti of Moosh; the hair of the dog that bit Noah, etc.",
        "  All things are either sacred or profane.\n  The former to ecclesiasts bring gain;\n  The latter to the devil appertain.",

        "\nSANDLOTTER, n.  A vertebrate mammal holding the political views of \nDenis Kearney, a notorious demagogue of San Francisco, whose audiences \ngathered in the open spaces (sandlots) of the town.  True to the \ntraditions of his species, this leader of the proletariat was finally \nbought off by his law-and-order enemies, living prosperously silent \nand dying impenitently rich.  But before his treason he imposed upon \nCalifornia a constitution that was a confection of sin in a diction of \nsolecisms.  The similarity between the words “sandlotter” and \n“sansculotte” is problematically significant, but indubitably \nsuggestive.",
        "SAFETY-CLUTCH, n.  A mechanical device acting automatically to prevent \nthe fall of an elevator, or cage, in case of an accident to the \nhoisting apparatus.",
        "  Once I seen a human ruin\n      In an elevator-well,\n  And his members was bestrewin’\n      All the place where he had fell.",

        "  Then, for further comprehension\n      Of his attitude, he begs\n  I will focus my attention\n      On his various arms and legs —",
        "  How they all are contumacious;\n      Where they each, respective, lie;\n  How one trotter proves ungracious,\n      T’other one an alibi.",
        "  These particulars is mentioned\n      For to show his dismal state,\n  Which I wasn’t first intentioned\n      To specifical relate.",
        "  None is worser to be dreaded\n      That I ever have heard tell\n  Than the gent’s who there was spreaded\n      In that elevator-well.",
        "  Now this tale is allegoric —\n      It is figurative all,\n  For the well is metaphoric\n      And the feller didn’t fall.",
        "  I opine it isn’t moral\n      For a writer-man to cheat,\n  And despise to wear a laurel\n      As was gotten by deceit.",
        "  For ’tis Politics intended\n      By the elevator, mind,\n  It will boost a person splendid\n      If his talent is the kind.",

        "\nSAINT, n.  A dead sinner revised and edited.\n  The Duchess of Orleans relates that the irreverent old \ncalumniator, Marshal Villeroi, who in his youth had known St. Francis \nde Sales, said, on hearing him called saint:  “I am delighted to hear \nthat Monsieur de Sales is a saint.  He was fond of saying indelicate \nthings, and used to cheat at cards.  In other respects he was a \nperfect gentleman, though a fool.”",
        "SALACITY, n.  A certain literary quality frequently observed in \npopular novels, especially in those written by women and young girls, \nwho give it another name and think that in introducing it they are \noccupying a neglected field of letters and reaping an overlooked \nharvest.  If they have the misfortune to live long enough they are \ntormented with a desire to burn their sheaves.",
        "SALAMANDER, n.  Originally a reptile inhabiting fire; later, an \nanthropomorphous immortal, but still a pyrophile.  Salamanders are now \nbelieved to be extinct, the last one of which we have an account \nhaving been seen in Carcassonne by the Abbe Belloc, who exorcised it \nwith a bucket of holy water.",
        "SARCOPHAGUS, n.  Among the Greeks a coffin which being made of a \ncertain kind of carnivorous stone, had the peculiar property of \ndevouring the body placed in it.  The sarcophagus known to modern \nobsequiographers is commonly a product of the carpenter’s art.",
        "SATAN, n.  One of the Creator’s lamentable mistakes, repented in \nsashcloth and axes.  Being instated as an archangel, Satan made \nhimself multifariously objectionable and was finally expelled from \nHeaven.  Halfway in his descent he paused, bent his head in thought a \nmoment and at last went back.  “There is one favor that I should like \nto ask,” said he.\n  “Name it.\"\n  “Man, I understand, is about to be created.  He will need laws.\"\n  “What, wretch! you his appointed adversary, charged from the dawn \nof eternity with hatred of his soul — you ask for the right to make \nhis laws?\"\n  “Pardon; what I have to ask is that he be permitted to make them \nhimself.\"\n  It was so ordered.",
        "SATIETY, n.  The feeling that one has for the plate after he has eaten \nits contents, madam.",
        "SATIRE, n.  An obsolete kind of literary composition in which the \nvices and follies of the author’s enemies were expounded with \nimperfect tenderness.  In this country satire never had more than a \nsickly and uncertain existence, for the soul of it is wit, wherein we \nare dolefully deficient, the humor that we mistake for it, like all \nhumor, being tolerant and sympathetic.  Moreover, although Americans \nare “endowed by their Creator” with abundant vice and folly, it is not \ngenerally known that these are reprehensible qualities, wherefore the \nsatirist is popularly regarded as a soul-spirited knave, and his ever \nvictim’s outcry for codefendants evokes a national assent.",
        "  Hail Satire! be thy praises ever sung\n  In the dead language of a mummy’s tongue,\n  For thou thyself art dead, and damned as well —\n  Thy spirit (usefully employed) in Hell.\n  Had it been such as consecrates the Bible\n  Thou hadst not perished by the law of libel.",
        "Barney Stims",
        "\nSATYR, n.  One of the few characters of the Grecian mythology accorded \nrecognition in the Hebrew.  (Leviticus, xvii, 7.)  The satyr was at \nfirst a member of the dissolute community acknowledging a loose \nallegiance with Dionysius, but underwent many transformations and \nimprovements.  Not infrequently he is confounded with the faun, a \nlater and decenter creation of the Romans, who was less like a man and \nmore like a goat.",
        "SAUCE, n.  The one infallible sign of civilization and enlightenment.  \nA people with no sauces has one thousand vices; a people with one \nsauce has only nine hundred and ninety-nine.  For every sauce invented \nand accepted a vice is renounced and forgiven.",
        "SAW, n.  A trite popular saying, or proverb.  (Figurative and \ncolloquial.)  So called because it makes its way into a wooden head.  \nFollowing are examples of old saws fitted with new teeth.",
        "      A penny saved is a penny to squander.",

        "SCARABAEUS, n.  The sacred beetle of the ancient Egyptians, allied to \nour familiar “tumble-bug.”  It was supposed to symbolize immortality, \nthe fact that God knew why giving it its peculiar sanctity.  Its habit \nof incubating its eggs in a ball of ordure may also have commended it \nto the favor of the priesthood, and may some day assure it an equal \nreverence among ourselves.  True, the American beetle is an inferior \nbeetle, but the American priest is an inferior priest.",
        "SCARABEE, n.  The same as scarabaeus.",
        "              He fell by his own hand\n                  Beneath the great oak tree.\n              He’d traveled in a foreign land.\n              He tried to make her understand\n              The dance that’s called the Saraband,\n                  But he called it Scarabee.\n  He had called it so through an afternoon,\n      And she, the light of his harem if so might be,\n      Had smiled and said naught.  O the body was fair to see,\n  All frosted there in the shine o’ the moon —\n                      Dead for a Scarabee\n  And a recollection that came too late.\n                          O Fate!\n                  They buried him where he lay,\n                  He sleeps awaiting the Day,\n                          In state,\n  And two Possible Puns, moon-eyed and wan,\n  Gloom over the grave and then move on.\n                      Dead for a Scarabee!\n                                                     Fernando Tapple",
        "SCARIFICATION, n.  A form of penance practised by the mediaeval pious.  \nThe rite was performed, sometimes with a knife, sometimes with a hot \niron, but always, says Arsenius Asceticus, acceptably if the penitent \nspared himself no pain nor harmless disfigurement.  Scarification, \nwith other crude penances, has now been superseded by benefaction.  \nThe founding of a library or endowment of a university is said to \nyield to the penitent a sharper and more lasting pain than is \nconferred by the knife or iron, and is therefore a surer means of \ngrace.  There are, however, two grave objections to it as a \npenitential method:  the good that it does and the taint of justice.",
        "SCEPTER, n.  A king’s staff of office, the sign and symbol of his \nauthority.  It was originally a mace with which the sovereign \nadmonished his jester and vetoed ministerial measures by breaking the \nbones of their proponents.",
        "SCIMETAR, n.  A curved sword of exceeding keenness, in the conduct of \nwhich certain Orientals attain a surprising proficiency, as the \nincident here related will serve to show.  The account is translated \nfrom the Japanese by Shusi Itama, a famous writer of the thirteenth \ncentury.",
        "      When the great Gichi-Kuktai was Mikado he condemned to \n  decapitation Jijiji Ri, a high officer of the Court.  Soon after \n  the hour appointed for performance of the rite what was his \n  Majesty’s surprise to see calmly approaching the throne the man \n  who should have been at that time ten minutes dead!\n      “Seventeen hundred impossible dragons!” shouted the enraged \n  monarch.  “Did I not sentence you to stand in the market-place and \n  have your head struck off by the public executioner at three \n  o’clock?  And is it not now 3:10?\"\n      “Son of a thousand illustrious deities,” answered the \n  condemned minister, “all that you say is so true that the truth is \n  a lie in comparison.  But your heavenly Majesty’s sunny and \n  vitalizing wishes have been pestilently disregarded.  With joy I \n  ran and placed my unworthy body in the market-place.  The \n  executioner appeared with his bare scimetar, ostentatiously \n  whirled it in air, and then, tapping me lightly upon the neck, \n  strode away, pelted by the populace, with whom I was ever a \n  favorite.  I am come to pray for justice upon his own dishonorable \n  and treasonous head.\"\n      “To what regiment of executioners does the black-boweled\n  caitiff belong?” asked the Mikado.\n      “To the gallant Ninety-eight Hundred and Thirty-seventh — I \n  know the man.  His name is Sakko-Samshi.\"\n      “Let him be brought before me,” said the Mikado to an \n  attendant, and a half-hour later the culprit stood in the \n  Presence.\n      “Thou bastard son of a three-legged hunchback without thumbs!” \n  roared the sovereign — “why didst thou but lightly tap the neck \n  that it should have been thy pleasure to sever?\"\n      “Lord of Cranes of Cherry Blooms,” replied the executioner, \n  unmoved, “command him to blow his nose with his fingers.\"\n      Being commanded, Jijiji Ri laid hold of his nose and trumpeted \n  like an elephant, all expecting to see the severed head flung \n  violently from him.  Nothing occurred:  the performance prospered \n  peacefully to the close, without incident.\n      All eyes were now turned on the executioner, who had grown as \n  white as the snows on the summit of Fujiama.  His legs trembled \n  and his breath came in gasps of terror.\n      “Several kinds of spike-tailed brass lions!” he cried; “I am a \n  ruined and disgraced swordsman!  I struck the villain feebly \n  because in flourishing the scimetar I had accidentally passed it \n  through my own neck!  Father of the Moon, I resign my office.\"\n      So saying, he gasped his top-knot, lifted off his head, and \n  advancing to the throne laid it humbly at the Mikado’s feet.",
        "SCRAP-BOOK, n.  A book that is commonly edited by a fool.  Many \npersons of some small distinction compile scrap-books containing \nwhatever they happen to read about themselves or employ others to \ncollect.  One of these egotists was addressed in the lines following, \nby Agamemnon Melancthon Peters:",
        "  Dear Frank, that scrap-book where you boast\n      You keep a record true\n  Of every kind of peppered roast\n          That’s made of you;",
        "  Wherein you paste the printed gibes\n      That revel round your name,\n  Thinking the laughter of the scribes\n          Attests your fame;",

        "SCRIBBLER, n.  A professional writer whose views are antagonistic to \none’s own.",
        "SCRIPTURES, n.  The sacred books of our holy religion, as \ndistinguished from the false and profane writings on which all other \nfaiths are based.",
        "SEAL, n.  A mark impressed upon certain kinds of documents to attest \ntheir authenticity and authority.  Sometimes it is stamped upon wax, \nand attached to the paper, sometimes into the paper itself.  Sealing, \nin this sense, is a survival of an ancient custom of inscribing \nimportant papers with cabalistic words or signs to give them a magical \nefficacy independent of the authority that they represent.  In the \nBritish museum are preserved many ancient papers, mostly of a \nsacerdotal character, validated by necromantic pentagrams and other \ndevices, frequently initial letters of words to conjure with; and in \nmany instances these are attached in the same way that seals are \nappended now.  As nearly every reasonless and apparently meaningless \ncustom, rite or observance of modern times had origin in some remote \nutility, it is pleasing to note an example of ancient nonsense \nevolving in the process of ages into something really useful.  Our \nword “sincere” is derived from sine cero, without wax, but the \nlearned are not in agreement as to whether this refers to the absence \nof the cabalistic signs, or to that of the wax with which letters were \nformerly closed from public scrutiny.  Either view of the matter will \nserve one in immediate need of an hypothesis.  The initials L.S., \ncommonly appended to signatures of legal documents, mean locum \nsigillis, the place of the seal, although the seal is no longer used \n— an admirable example of conservatism distinguishing Man from the \nbeasts that perish.  The words locum sigillis are humbly suggested \nas a suitable motto for the Pribyloff Islands whenever they shall take \ntheir place as a sovereign State of the American Union.",
        "SEINE, n.  A kind of net for effecting an involuntary change of \nenvironment.  For fish it is made strong and coarse, but women are \nmore easily taken with a singularly delicate fabric weighted with \nsmall, cut stones.",
        "  The devil casting a seine of lace,\n      (With precious stones ’twas weighted)\n  Drew it into the landing place\n      And its contents calculated.",
        "  All souls of women were in that sack —\n      A draft miraculous, precious!\n  But ere he could throw it across his back\n      They’d all escaped through the meshes.",

        "SENATE, n.  A body of elderly gentlemen charged with high duties and \nmisdemeanors.",
        "SERIAL, n.  A literary work, usually a story that is not true, \ncreeping through several issues of a newspaper or magazine.  \nFrequently appended to each installment is a “synposis of preceding \nchapters” for those who have not read them, but a direr need is a \nsynposis of succeeding chapters for those who do not intend to read \nthem.  A synposis of the entire work would be still better.\n  The late James F. Bowman was writing a serial tale for a weekly \npaper in collaboration with a genius whose name has not come down to \nus.  They wrote, not jointly but alternately, Bowman supplying the \ninstallment for one week, his friend for the next, and so on, world \nwithout end, they hoped.  Unfortunately they quarreled, and one Monday \nmorning when Bowman read the paper to prepare himself for his task, he \nfound his work cut out for him in a way to surprise and pain him.  His \ncollaborator had embarked every character of the narrative on a ship \nand sunk them all in the deepest part of the Atlantic.",
        "SEVERALTY, n.  Separateness, as, lands in severalty, i.e., lands held \nindividually, not in joint ownership.  Certain tribes of Indians are \nbelieved now to be sufficiently civilized to have in severalty the \nlands that they have hitherto held as tribal organizations, and could \nnot sell to the Whites for waxen beads and potato whiskey.",

        "SOUL, n.  A spiritual entity concerning which there hath been brave \ndisputation.  Plato held that those souls which in a previous state of \nexistence (antedating Athens) had obtained the clearest glimpses of \neternal truth entered into the bodies of persons who became \nphilosophers.  Plato himself was a philosopher.  The souls that had \nleast contemplated divine truth animated the bodies of usurpers and \ndespots.  Dionysius I, who had threatened to decapitate the broad- \nbrowed philosopher, was a usurper and a despot.  Plato, doubtless, was \nnot the first to construct a system of philosophy that could be quoted \nagainst his enemies; certainly he was not the last.\n  “Concerning the nature of the soul,” saith the renowned author of \nDiversiones Sanctorum, “there hath been hardly more argument than \nthat of its place in the body.  Mine own belief is that the soul hath \nher seat in the abdomen — in which faith we may discern and interpret \na truth hitherto unintelligible, namely that the glutton is of all men \nmost devout.  He is said in the Scripture to ’make a god of his belly’ \n— why, then, should he not be pious, having ever his Deity with him \nto freshen his faith?  Who so well as he can know the might and \nmajesty that he shrines?  Truly and soberly, the soul and the stomach \nare one Divine Entity; and such was the belief of Promasius, who \nnevertheless erred in denying it immortality.  He had observed that \nits visible and material substance failed and decayed with the rest of \nthe body after death, but of its immaterial essence he knew nothing.  \nThis is what we call the Appetite, and it survives the wreck and reek \nof mortality, to be rewarded or punished in another world, according \nto what it hath demanded in the flesh.  The Appetite whose coarse \nclamoring was for the unwholesome viands of the general market and the \npublic refectory shall be cast into eternal famine, whilst that which \nfirmly through civilly insisted on ortolans, caviare, terrapin, \nanchovies, pates de foie gras and all such Christian comestibles \nshall flesh its spiritual tooth in the souls of them forever and ever, \nand wreak its divine thirst upon the immortal parts of the rarest and \nrichest wines ever quaffed here below.  Such is my religious faith, \nthough I grieve to confess that neither His Holiness the Pope nor His \nGrace the Archbishop of Canterbury (whom I equally and profoundly \nrevere) will assent to its dissemination.”",
        "SPOOKER, n.  A writer whose imagination concerns itself with \nsupernatural phenomena, especially in the doings of spooks.  One of \nthe most illustrious spookers of our time is Mr. William D. Howells, \nwho introduces a well-credentialed reader to as respectable and \nmannerly a company of spooks as one could wish to meet.  To the terror \nthat invests the chairman of a district school board, the Howells \nghost adds something of the mystery enveloping a farmer from another \ntownship.",
        "STORY, n.  A narrative, commonly untrue.  The truth of the stories \nhere following has, however, not been successfully impeached.",
        "  One evening Mr. Rudolph Block, of New York, found himself seated \nat dinner alongside Mr. Percival Pollard, the distinguished critic.\n  “Mr. Pollard,” said he, “my book, The Biography of a Dead Cow, \nis published anonymously, but you can hardly be ignorant of its \nauthorship.  Yet in reviewing it you speak of it as the work of the \nIdiot of the Century.  Do you think that fair criticism?\"\n  “I am very sorry, sir,” replied the critic, amiably, “but it did \nnot occur to me that you really might not wish the public to know who \nwrote it.”",
        "  Mr. W.C. Morrow, who used to live in San Jose, California, was \naddicted to writing ghost stories which made the reader feel as if a \nstream of lizards, fresh from the ice, were streaking it up his back \nand hiding in his hair.  San Jose was at that time believed to be \nhaunted by the visible spirit of a noted bandit named Vasquez, who had \nbeen hanged there.  The town was not very well lighted, and it is \nputting it mildly to say that San Jose was reluctant to be out o’ \nnights.  One particularly dark night two gentlemen were abroad in the \nloneliest spot within the city limits, talking loudly to keep up their \ncourage, when they came upon Mr. J.J. Owen, a well-known journalist.\n  “Why, Owen,” said one, “what brings you here on such a night as \nthis?  You told me that this is one of Vasquez’ favorite haunts!  And \nyou are a believer.  Aren’t you afraid to be out?\"\n  “My dear fellow,” the journalist replied with a drear autumnal \ncadence in his speech, like the moan of a leaf-laden wind, “I am \nafraid to be in.  I have one of Will Morrow’s stories in my pocket and \nI don’t dare to go where there is light enough to read it.\"\n  Rear-Admiral Schley and Representative Charles F. Joy were \nstanding near the Peace Monument, in Washington, discussing the \nquestion, Is success a failure?  Mr. Joy suddenly broke off in the \nmiddle of an eloquent sentence, exclaiming:  “Hello!  I’ve heard that \nband before.  Santlemann’s, I think.\"\n  “I don’t hear any band,” said Schley.\n  “Come to think, I don’t either,” said Joy; “but I see General \nMiles coming down the avenue, and that pageant always affects me in \nthe same way as a brass band.  One has to scrutinize one’s impressions \npretty closely, or one will mistake their origin.\"\n  While the Admiral was digesting this hasty meal of philosophy \nGeneral Miles passed in review, a spectacle of impressive dignity.  \nWhen the tail of the seeming procession had passed and the two \nobservers had recovered from the transient blindness caused by its \neffulgence —\n  “He seems to be enjoying himself,” said the Admiral.\n  “There is nothing,” assented Joy, thoughtfully, “that he enjoys \none-half so well.”",
        "  The illustrious statesman, Champ Clark, once lived about a mile \nfrom the village of Jebigue, in Missouri.  One day he rode into town \non a favorite mule, and, hitching the beast on the sunny side of a \nstreet, in front of a saloon, he went inside in his character of \nteetotaler, to apprise the barkeeper that wine is a mocker.  It was a \ndreadfully hot day.  Pretty soon a neighbor came in and seeing Clark, \nsaid:\n  “Champ, it is not right to leave that mule out there in the sun.  \nHe’ll roast, sure! — he was smoking as I passed him.\"\n  “O, he’s all right,” said Clark, lightly; “he’s an inveterate \nsmoker.\"\n  The neighbor took a lemonade, but shook his head and repeated that \nit was not right.\n  He was a conspirator.  There had been a fire the night before:  a \nstable just around the corner had burned and a number of horses had \nput on their immortality, among them a young colt, which was roasted \nto a rich nut-brown.  Some of the boys had turned Mr. Clark’s mule \nloose and substituted the mortal part of the colt.  Presently another \nman entered the saloon.\n  “For mercy’s sake!” he said, taking it with sugar, “do remove that \nmule, barkeeper:  it smells.\"\n  “Yes,” interposed Clark, “that animal has the best nose in \nMissouri.  But if he doesn’t mind, you shouldn’t.\"\n  In the course of human events Mr. Clark went out, and there, \napparently, lay the incinerated and shrunken remains of his charger. \nThe boys idd not have any fun out of Mr. Clarke, who looked at the \nbody and, with the non-committal expression to which he owes so much \nof his political preferment, went away.  But walking home late that \nnight he saw his mule standing silent and solemn by the wayside in the \nmisty moonlight.  Mentioning the name of Helen Blazes with uncommon \nemphasis, Mr. Clark took the back track as hard as ever he could hook \nit, and passed the night in town.",
        "  General H.H. Wotherspoon, president of the Army War College, has a \npet rib-nosed baboon, an animal of uncommon intelligence but \nimperfectly beautiful.  Returning to his apartment one evening, the \nGeneral was surprised and pained to find Adam (for so the creature is \nnamed, the general being a Darwinian) sitting up for him and wearing \nhis master’s best uniform coat, epaulettes and all.\n  “You confounded remote ancestor!” thundered the great strategist, \n“what do you mean by being out of bed after naps? — and with my coat \non!\"\n  Adam rose and with a reproachful look got down on all fours in the \nmanner of his kind and, scuffling across the room to a table, returned \nwith a visiting-card:  General Barry had called and, judging by an \nempty champagne bottle and several cigar-stumps, had been hospitably \nentertained while waiting.  The general apologized to his faithful \nprogenitor and retired.  The next day he met General Barry, who said:\n  “Spoon, old man, when leaving you last evening I forgot to ask you \nabout those excellent cigars.  Where did you get them?\"\n  General Wotherspoon did not deign to reply, but walked away.\n  “Pardon me, please,” said Barry, moving after him; “I was joking \nof course.  Why, I knew it was not you before I had been in the room \nfifteen minutes.”",
        "SUCCESS, n.  The one unpardonable sin against one’s fellows.  In \nliterature, and particularly in poetry, the elements of success are \nexceedingly simple, and are admirably set forth in the following lines \nby the reverend Father Gassalasca Jape, entitled, for some mysterious \nreason, “John A. Joyce.”",
        "  The bard who would prosper must carry a book,\n      Do his thinking in prose and wear\n  A crimson cravat, a far-away look\n      And a head of hexameter hair.\n  Be thin in your thought and your body’ll be fat;\n  If you wear your hair long you needn’t your hat.",
        "SUFFRAGE, n.  Expression of opinion by means of a ballot.  The right \nof suffrage (which is held to be both a privilege and a duty) means, \nas commonly interpreted, the right to vote for the man of another \nman’s choice, and is highly prized.  Refusal to do so has the bad name \nof “incivism.”  The incivilian, however, cannot be properly arraigned\nfor his crime, for there is no legitimate accuser.  If the accuser is \nhimself guilty he has no standing in the court of opinion; if not, he \nprofits by the crime, for A’s abstention from voting gives greater \nweight to the vote of B.  By female suffrage is meant the right of a \nwoman to vote as some man tells her to.  It is based on female \nresponsibility, which is somewhat limited.  The woman most eager to \njump out of her petticoat to assert her rights is first to jump back \ninto it when threatened with a switching for misusing them.",
        "SYCOPHANT, n.  One who approaches Greatness on his belly so that he \nmay not be commanded to turn and be kicked.  He is sometimes an \neditor.",

An immaterial but visible being that inhabited the air when \nthe air was an element and before it was fatally polluted with factory \nsmoke, sewer gas and similar products of civilization.  Sylphs were \nallied to gnomes, nymphs and salamanders, which dwelt, respectively, \nin earth, water and fire, all now insalubrious.  Sylphs, like fowls of \nthe air, were male and female, to no purpose, apparently, for if they \nhad progeny they must have nested in accessible places, none of the \nchicks having ever been seen.",
        "SYMBOL, n.  Something that is supposed to typify or stand for \nsomething else.  Many symbols are mere “survivals” — things which \nhaving no longer any utility continue to exist because we have \ninherited the tendency to make them; as funereal urns carved on \nmemorial monuments.
