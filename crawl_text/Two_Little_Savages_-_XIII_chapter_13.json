        "The Lynx",
        "As winter waned, Yan’s strength returned. He was wise enough to use\nhis new ascendency to get books. The public librarian, a man of broad\nculture who had fought his own fight, became interested in him, and\nhelped him to many works that otherwise he would have missed.",
        "“Wilson’s Ornithology” and “Schoolcraft’s Indians” were the most\nimportant. And they were sparkling streams in the thirst-parched land.",
        "In March he was fast recovering. He could now take long walks; and one\nbright day of snow he set off with his brother’s Dog. His steps bent\nhillward. The air was bright and bracing, he stepped with unexpected\nvigour, and he made for far Glenyan, without at first meaning to go\nthere. But, drawn by the ancient attraction, he kept on. The secret\npath looked not so secret, now the leaves were off; but the Glen\nlooked dearly familiar as he reached the wider stretch.",
        "His eye fell on a large, peculiar track quite fresh in the snow. It\nwas five inches across, big enough for a Bear track, but there were no\nsigns of claws or toe pads. The steps were short and the tracks had\nnot sunken as they would for an animal as heavy as a Bear.",
        "As one end of each showed the indications of toes, he could see what\nway it went, and followed up the Glen. The dog sniffed at it uneasily,\nbut showed no disposition to go ahead. Yan tramped up past the ruins\nof his shanty, now painfully visible since the leaves had fallen, and\nhis heart ached at the sight. The trail led up the valley, and crossed\nthe brook on a log, and Yan became convinced that he was on the track\nof a large Lynx. Though a splendid barker, Grip, the dog, was known to\nbe a coward, and now he slunk behind the boy, sniffing at the great\ntrack and absolutely refusing to go ahead.",
        "Yan was fascinated by the long rows of footprints, and when he came\nto a place where the creature had leaped ten or twelve feet without\nvisible cause, he felt satisfied that he had found a Lynx, and the\nlove of adventure prompted him to go on, although he had not even a\nstick in his hand or a knife in his pocket. He picked up the best club\nhe could find–a dry branch two feet long and two inches through, and\nfollowed. The dog was now unwilling to go at all; he hung back, and\nhad to be called at each hundred yards.",
        "They were at last in the dense Hemlock woods at the upper end of the\nvalley, when a peculiar sound like the call of a deep-voiced cat was\nheard.",
        "Yow! Yow! Yowl!\nYan stood still. The dog, although a large and powerful retriever,\nwhimpered, trembled and crawled up close.",
        "The sound increased in volume. The yowling meouw came louder,\nlouder and nearer, then suddenly clear and close, as though the\ncreature had rounded a point and entered an opening. It was positively\nblood-curdling now. The dog could stand it no more; he turned and went\nas fast as he could for home, leaving Yan to his fate. There was no\nlonger any question that it was a Lynx. Yan had felt nervous before\nand the abject flight of the dog reacted on him. He realized how\ndefenseless he was, still weak from his illness, and he turned and\nwent after the dog. At first he walked. But having given in to his\nfears, they increased; and as the yowling continued he finally ran his\nfastest. The sounds were left behind, but Yan never stopped until he\nhad left the Glen and was once more in the open valley of the river.\nHere he found the valiant retriever trembling all over. Yan received\nhim with a contemptuous kick, and, boylike, as soon as he could find\nsome stones, he used them till Grip was driven home.",
        "Most lads have some sporting instinct, and his elder brother, though\nnot of Yan’s tastes, was not averse to going gunning when there was a\nprospect of sport.",
        "Yan decided to reveal to Rad the secret of his glen. He had never been\nallowed to use a gun, but Rad had one, and Yan’s vivid account of his\nadventure had the desired effect. His method was characteristic.",
        "[Illustration: “It surely was a Lynx.\"]",
        "“Rad, would you go huntin’ if there was lots to hunt?”",
        "“Course I would.”",
        "“Well, I know a place not ten miles away where there are all kinds of\nwild animals–hundreds of them.”",
        "“Yes, you do, I don’t think. Humph!”",
        "“Yes, I do; and I’ll tell you, if you will promise never to tell a\nsoul.”",
        "“Ba-ah!”",
        "“Well, I just had an adventure with a Lynx up there now, and if you\nwill come with your gun we can get him.”",
        "Then Yan related all that had passed, and it lost nothing in his\ntelling. His brother was impressed enough to set out under Yan’s\nguidance on the following Saturday.",
        "Yan hated to reveal to his sneering, earthy-minded brother all the\njoys and sorrows he had found in the Glen, but now that it seemed\ncompulsory he found keen pleasure in playing the part of the crafty\nguide. With unnecessary caution he first led in a wrong direction,\nthen trying, but failing, to extort another promise of secrecy, he\nturned at an angle, pointed to a distant tree, saying with all the\nmeaning he could put into it: “Ten paces beyond that tree is a trail\nthat shall lead us into the secret valley.” After sundry other\nceremonies of the sort, they were near the inway, when a man came\nwalking through the bushes. On his shoulders he carried something.\nWhen he came close, Yan saw to his deep disgust that that something\nwas the Lynx–yes, it surely was his Lynx.",
        "They eagerly plied the man with questions. He told them that he had\nkilled it the day before, really. It had been prowling for the last\nweek or more about Kernore’s bush; probably it was a straggler from up\nnorth.",
        "This was all intensely fascinating to Yan, but in it was a jarring\nnote. Evidently this man considered the Glen–his Glen–as an\nordinary, well-known bit of bush, possibly part of his farm–not by\nany means the profound mystery that Yan would have had it.",
        "The Lynx was a fine large one. The stripes on its face and the wide\nopen yellow eyes gave a peculiarly wild, tiger-like expression that\nwas deeply gratifying to Yan’s romantic soul.",
        "It was not so much of an adventure as a might-have-been adventure;\nbut it left a deep impress on the boy, and it also illustrated the\naccuracy of his instincts in identifying creatures that he had never\nbefore seen, but knew only through the slight descriptions of very\nunsatisfactory books.",
