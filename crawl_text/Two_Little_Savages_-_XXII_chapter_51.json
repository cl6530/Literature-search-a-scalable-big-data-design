        "The Coon Hunt",
        "Yan did not forget the proposed Coon hunt–in fact, he was most\nimpatient for it, and within two days the boys came to Caleb about\nsundown and reminded him of his promise. It was a sultry night, but\nYan was sure it was just right for a Coon hunt, and his enthusiasm\ncarried all before it. Caleb was quietly amused at the ’cool\nnight_” selected, but reckoned it would be “better later.”",
        "“Set down–set down, boys,” he said, seeing them standing ready for an\nimmediate start. “There’s no hurry. Coons won’t be running for three\nor four hours after sundown.”",
        "So he sat and smoked, while Sam vainly tried to get acquainted with\nold Turk; Yan made notes on some bird wings nailed to the wall,\nand Guy got out the latest improved edition of his exploits in\nDeer-hunting and Woodchuck killing, as well as enlarged on his plans\nfor gloriously routing any Coon they might encounter.",
        "By insisting that it would take an hour to get to the place, Yan\ngot them started at nine o’clock, Caleb, on a suggestion from Guy,\ncarrying a small axe. Keeping old Turk well in hand, they took the\nhighway, and for half an hour tramped on toward the “Corners.” Led by\nSam, they climbed a fence crossed a potato field, and reached the corn\npatch by the stream.",
        "“Go ahead, Turk. Sic him! Sic him! Sic him!” and the company sat in a\nrow on the fence to await developments.",
        "Turk was somewhat of a character. He hunted what he pleased and when\nhe pleased. His master could bring him on the Coon grounds, but he\ncouldn’t make him hunt Coon nor anything else unless it suited his own\nfancy. Caleb had warned the boys to be still, and they sat along the\nfence in dead silence, awaiting the summons from the old Hound. He had\ngone off beating and sniffing among the cornstalks. His steps sounded\nvery loud and his sniffs like puffs of steam. It was a time of tense\nattention; but the Hound wandered, farther away, and even his noisy\nsteps were lost.",
        "They had sat for two long minutes, when a low yelp from a distant part\nof the field, then a loud ’bow-wow” from the Hound, set Yan’s\nheart jumping.",
        "“Game afoot,” said Sam in a low voice.",
        "“Bet I heered him first,” piped Guy.",
        "Yan’s first thought was to rush pell-mell after the Dog. He had often\nread of the hunt following furiously the baying of the Hounds, but\nCaleb restrained him.",
        "“Hold on, boy; plenty of time. Don’t know yet what it is.”",
        "For Turk, like most frontier Hounds, would run almost any trail–had\neven been accused of running on his own–and it rested with those who\nknew him best to discover from his peculiar style of tonguing just\nwhat the game might be. But they waited long and patiently without\ngetting another bay from the Hound. Presently a rustling was heard and\nTurk came up to his master and lay down at his feet.",
        "“Go ahead, Turk, put him up,” but the Dog stirred not. “Go ahead,” and\nCaleb gave him a rap with a small stick. The Dog dodged away, but lay\ndown again, panting.",
        "“What was it, Mr. Clark?” demanded Yan.",
        "“Don’t hardly know. Maybe he only spiked himself on a snag. But this\nis sure; there’s no Coons here to-night. There won’t be after this. We\ncome too early, and it’s too hot for the Dog, anyway.”",
        "“We could cross the creek and go into Boyle’s bush,” suggested the\nWoodpecker. “We’re like to strike anything there. Larry de Neuville\nswears he saw a Unicorn there the night he came back from Garney’s\nwake.”",
        "“How can you tell the kind of game by the Dog’s barking?” asked Yan.",
        "“H-m!” answered Caleb, as he put a fresh quid in his lantern jaw. “You\nsurely can if you know the country an’ the game an’ the Dog. Course,\nno two Dogs is alike; you got to study your Dog, an’ if he’s good\nhe’ll larn you lots about trailing.”",
        "The brook was nearly dry now, so they crossed where they would. Then\nfeeling their way through the dark woods with eyes for the most part\nclosed, they groped toward Boyle’s open field, then across it to the\nheavy timber. Turk had left them at the brook, and, following its\ncourse till he came to a pool, had had a bath. As they entered the\ntimber tract he joined them, dripping wet and ready for business.",
        "“Go ahead, Turk,” and again all sat down to await the opinion of the\nexpert.",
        "It came quickly. The old Hound, after circling about in a way that\nseemed to prove him independent of daylight, began to sniff loudly,\nand gave a low whine. He followed a little farther, and now his tail\nwas heard to ’tap, tap, tap_’ the brush as he went through a dry\nthicket.",
        "“Hear that? He’s got something this time,” said Caleb in a low voice.\n“Wait a little.”",
        "The Hound was already working out a puzzle, and when at last he got\nfar enough to be sure, he gave a short bark. There was another\nspell of sniffing, then another bark, then several little barks at\nintervals, and at last a short bay; then the baying recommenced, but\nwas irregular and not full-chested. The sounds told that the Hound was\nrunning in a circle about the forest, but at length ceased moving,\nfor all the barking was at one place. When the hunters got there\nthey found the Dog half-way in a hole under a stump, barking and\nscratching.",
        "“Humph,” said Caleb; “nothing but a Cottontail. Might ’a’ knowed that\nby the light scent an’ the circling without treeing.”",
        "So Turk was called off and the company groped through the inky woods\nin quest of more adventures.",
        "“There’s a kind of swampy pond down the lower end of the bush–a\nlikely place for Coons on a Frog-hunt,” suggested the Woodpecker.",
        "So the Hound was again “turned on” near the pond. The dry woods were\npoor for scent, but the damp margin of the marsh proved good, and Turk\nbecame keenly interested and very sniffy. A preliminary ’Woof!_\"\nwas followed by one or two yelps and then a full-chested\n“_Boooow!” that left no doubt he had struck a hot trail at last.\nOh, what wonderfully thrilling horn-blasts those were! Yan for the\nfirst time realized the power of the “full cry,” whose praises are so\noften sung.",
        "The hunters sat down to await the result, for, as Caleb pointed out,\nthere was “no saying where the critter might run.”",
        "The Hound bayed his fullest, roundest notes at quick intervals, but\ndid not circle. The sound of his voice told them that the chase was\nstraight away, out of the woods, easterly across an open field, and at\na hot pace, with regular, full bellowing, unbroken by turn or doubt.",
        "“I believe he’s after the old Callaghan Fox,” said the Trapper.\n“They’ve tried it together before now, an’ there ain’t anything but a\nFox will run so straight and fetch such a tune out of Turk.”",
        "The baying finally was lost in the distance, probably a mile away, but\nthere was nothing for it but to wait. If Turk had been a full-bred and\ntrained Foxhound he would have stuck to that trail all night, but in\nhalf an hour he returned, puffing and hot, to throw himself into the\nshallow pond.",
        "“Everything scared away now,” remarked Caleb. “We might try the other\nside of the pond.” Once or twice the dog became interested, but\ndecided that there was nothing in it, and returned to pant by his\nmaster’s feet.",
        "They had now travelled so far toward home that a very short cut across\nfields would bring them into their own woods.",
        "The moon arose as they got there, and after their long groping in the\nmurky darkness this made the night seem very bright and clear.",
        "They had crossed the brook below Granny de Neuville’s, and were\nfollowing the old timber trail that went near the stream, when Turk\nstopped to sniff, ran back and forth two or three times, then stirred\nthe echoes with a full-toned bugle blast and led toward the water.",
        "“_Bow–bow–bow–bow,” he bawled for forty yards and came to a\nstop. The baying was exactly the same that he gave on the Fox trail,\nbut the course of the animal was crooked, and now there was a break.",
        "They could hear the dog beating about close at hand and far away, but\nsilent so far as tongue was concerned.",
        "“What is it, Caleb?” said Sam with calm assurance, forgetting how\nrecent was their acquaintance.",
        "“Dunno,” was the short reply.",
        "“’Tisn’t a Fox, is it?” asked Yan.",
        "But a sudden renewal of ’Bow–bow–bow–” from the Hound one\nhundred yards away, at the fence, ended all discussion. The dog had\nthe hot trail again. The break had been along the line of a fence that\nshowed, as Caleb said, “It was a Coon, ’cept it might be some old\nhouse Cat maybe; them was the only things that would run along top of\na fence in the night time.”",
        "It was easy to follow now; the moonlight was good, and the baying of\nthe Hound was loud and regular. It led right down the creek, crossing\nseveral pools and swamps.",
        "“That settles it,” remarked the Trapper decisively. “Cats don’t take\nto the water. That’s a Coon,” and as they hurried they heard a sudden\nchange in the dog’s note, no longer a deep rich ’B-o-o-w-w.’ It\nbecame an outrageous clamour of mingled yelps, growls and barks.",
        "“Ha–heh. That means he’s right on it. That is what he does when he\nsees the critter.”",
        "But the “view halloo” was quickly dropped and the tonguing of the dog\nwas now in short, high-pitched yelps at one place.",
        "“Jest so! He’s treed! That’s a Coon, all right!” and Caleb led\nstraight for the place.",
        "The Hound was barking and leaping against a big Basswood, and Caleb’s\ncomment was: “Hm, never knowed a Coon to do any other way–always gets\nup the highest and tarnalest tree to climb in the hull bush. Now who’s\nthe best climber here?”",
        "“Yan is,” volunteered Sam.",
        "“Kin ye do it, Yan?”",
        "“I’ll try.”",
        "“Guess we’ll make a fire first and see if we can’t see him,” said the\nWoodpecker.",
        "“If it was a Woodchuck I’d soon get him for you,” chimed in Hawkeye,\nbut no one heeded.",
        "Sam and Yan gathered stuff and soon had a flood of flickering red\nlight on all the surrounding trees. They scanned the big Basswood\nwithout getting sight of their quarry. Caleb took a torch and found on\nthe bark some fresh mud. By going back on the trail to where it had\ncrossed the brook they found the footprint–undoubtedly that of a\nlarge Coon.",
        "“Reckon he’s in some hollow; he’s surely up that tree, and Basswood’s\nare always hollow.”",
        "Yan now looked at the large trunk in doubt as to whether he could\nmanage it.",
        "Caleb remarked his perplexity and said: “Yes; that’s so. You ain’t\nfifteen foot spread across the wings, are you? But hold on–”",
        "He walked to a tall thin tree near at hand, cut it through with the\naxe in a few minutes, and threw it so as to rest against the lowest\nbranch of the big Basswood. Up this Yan easily swarmed, carrying a\nstout Elm stick tied behind. When he got to the great Basswood he felt\nlost in the green mass, but the boys below carried torches so as to\nshed light on each part in turn. At first Yan found neither hole in\nthe trunk nor Coon, but after long search in the upper branches he saw\na great ball of fur on a high crotch and in it two glowing eyes that\ngave him a thrill. He yelled: “Here he is! Look out below.” He climbed\nup nearer and tried to push the Coon off, but it braced itself firmly\nand defied him until he climbed above it, when it leaped and scrambled\nto a lower branch.",
        "Yan followed it, while his companions below got greatly excited, as\nthey could see nothing, and only judged by the growling and snarling\nthat Yan and the Coon were fighting. After another passage at arms\nthe Coon left the second crotch and scrambled down the trunk till it\nreached the leaning sapling, and there perched, glaring at the hunters\nbelow. The old Hound raised a howl when he saw the quarry, and Caleb,\nstepping to one side, drew his revolver and fired. The Coon fell dead\ninto their midst. Turk sprang to do battle, but he was not needed, and\nCaleb fondly and proudly wiped the old white pistol as though it alone\nwere to be thanked for the clever shot.",
        "Yan came down quickly, though he found it harder to get down than up.\nHe hurried excitedly into the ring and stroked the Coon with a mixture\nof feelings–admiring its fur–sorry, after all, that it was killed,\nand triumphant that he had led the way. It was his Coon, and\nall admitted that. Sam “hefted” it by one leg and said, “Weighs thirty\npounds, I bet.”",
        "Guy said: “Pooh! Tain’t half as big as that there big Woodchuck I\nkilled, an’ you never would have got him if I hadn’t thought of the\naxe.”",
        "Yan thought it would weigh thirty-five pounds. Caleb guessed it at\ntwenty-five (and afterward they found out that it barely weighed\neighteen). While they were thus talking the Dog broke into an angry\nbarking such as he gave for strangers–his “human voice,” Caleb called\nit–and at once there stepped into the circle William Raften. He had\nseen the lights in the woods, and, dreading a fire at this dry season,\nhad dressed and come out.",
        "“Hello, Da; why ain’t you in bed, where you ought to be?”",
        "Raften took no notice of his son, but said sneeringly to Caleb: “Ye\nain’t out trying to get another shot at me, air ye?” ’Tain’t worth\nyour while; I hain’t got no cash on me to-night.”",
        "“Now see here, Da,” said Sam, interrupting before Caleb could answer,\n“you don’t play fair. I know, an’ you ought to know, that’s all rot\nabout Caleb shooting at you. If he had, he’d ’a’ got you sure. I’ve\nseen him shoot.”",
        "“Not when he was drunk.”",
        "“Last time I was drunk we was in it together,” said Caleb fiercely,\nfinding his voice.",
        "“Purty good for a man as swore he had no revolver,” and Raften pointed\nto Caleb’s weapon. “I seen you with that ten years ago. An’ sure\nI’m not scairt of you an’ yer revolver,” said Raften, seeing Caleb\nfingering his white pet; “an’ I tell ye this. I won’t have ye and yer\nSheep-killing cur ramatacking through my woods an’ making fires this\ndry saison.”",
        "“D–– you, Raften, I’ve stood all I’m goin’ to stand from you.” The\nrevolver was out in a flash, and doubtless Caleb would have lived up\nto his reputation, but Sam, springing to push his father back, came\nbetween, and Yan clung to Caleb’s revolver arm, while Guy got safely\nbehind a tree.",
        "“Get out o’ the way, you kids!” snarled Caleb.",
        "“By all manes,” said Raften scoffingly; “now that he’s got me\nunarrumed again. You dhirty coward! Get out av the way, bhoys, an\nOi’ll settle him,” for Raften was incapable of fear, and the boys\nwould have been thrust aside and trouble follow, but that Raften as he\nleft the house had called his two hired men to follow and help fight\nthe fire, and now they came on the scene. One of them was quite\nfriendly with Caleb, the other neutral, and they succeeded in stopping\nhostilities for a time, while Sam exploded:",
        "“Now see here, Da, ’twould just ’a’ served you right if you’d got a\nhole through you. You make me sick, running on Caleb. He didn’t make\nthat fire; ’twas me an’ Yan, an’ we’ll put it out safe enough. You\nskinned Caleb an’ he never done you no harm. You run on him just as\nGranny de Neuville done on you after she grabbed your groceries. You\nought to be ashamed of yourself. Tain’t square, an’ ’tain’t being a\nman. When you can’t prove nothin’ you ought to shut up.”",
        "Raften was somewhat taken aback by this outburst, especially as he\nfound all the company against him. He had often laughed at Granny de\nNeuville’s active hatred against him when he had done her nothing but\ngood. It never occurred to him that he was acting a similar part. Most\nmen would have been furious at the disrespectful manner of their son,\nbut Raften was as insensitive as he was uncowardly. His first shock\nof astonishment over, his only thought of Sam was, “Hain’t he got a\ncheek! My! but he talks like a lawyer, an’ he sasses right back like a\nfightin’ man; belave I’ll make him study law instid of tooth-pullin’.”",
        "The storm was over, for Caleb’s wrath was of the short and fierce\nkind, and Raften, turning away in moral defeat, growled: “See that ye\nput that fire out safe. Ye ought all to be in yer beds an’ aslape,\nlike dacint folks.”",
        "“Well, ain’t you dacint?” retorted Sam.",
        "Raften turned away, heeding neither that nor Guy’s shrill attempt\nto interpolate some details of his own importance in this present\nhunt–\"Ef it hadn’t been for me they wouldn’t had no axe along, Mr.\nRaften\"–but William had disappeared.",
        "The boys put out the fire carefully and made somewhat silently for\ncamp. Sam and Yan carried the Coon between them on a stick, and before\nthey reached the teepee they agreed that the carcass weighed at least\neighty pounds.",
        "Caleb left them, and they all turned in at once and slept the sleep of\nthe tired camper.",
