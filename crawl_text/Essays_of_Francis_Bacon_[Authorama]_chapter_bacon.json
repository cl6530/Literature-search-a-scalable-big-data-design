        "SALOMON saies; A good Name is as a precious\noyntment; And I assure my selfe, such wil\nyour Graces Name bee, with Posteritie.  For your\nFortune, and Merit both, have been Eminent.  And\nyou have planted Things, that are like to last.  I doe\nnow publish my Essayes; which, of all my other\nworkes, have beene most Currant: For that, as it\nseemes, they come home, to Mens Businesse, and\nBosomes.  I have enlarged them, both in Number,\nand Weight; So that they are indeed a New Worke.\nI thought it therefore agreeable, to my Affection,\nand Obligation to your Grace, to prefix your Name\nbefore them, both in English, and in Latine.  For I\ndoe conceive, that the Latine Volume of them,\n(being in the Universall Language) may last, as\nlong as Bookes last.  My Instauration, I dedicated to\nthe King: My Historie of Henry the Seventh,\n(which I have now also translated into Latine) and\nmy Portions of Naturall History, to the Prince:\nAnd these I dedicate to your Grace; Being of the\nbest Fruits, that by the good Encrease, which God\ngives to my Pen and Labours, I could yeeld.\nGod leade your Grace by the Hand.  Your Graces\nmost Obliged and faithfull Servant,",

        "WHAT is truth? said jesting Pilate,and would\nnot stay for an answer.  Certainly there be,\nthat delight in giddiness, and count it a bondage to\nfix a belief; affecting free-will in thinking, as well\nas in acting.  And though the sects of philosophers\nof that kind be gone, yet there remain certain discoursing wits, which are of the same veins, though\nthere be not so much blood in them, as was in those\nof the ancients.  But it is not only the difficulty and\nlabor, which men take in finding out of truth, nor\nagain, that when it is found, it imposeth upon\nmen’s thoughts, that doth bring lies in favor; but\na natural, though corrupt love, of the lie itself.  One\nof the later school of the Grecians, examineth the\nmatter, and is at a stand, to think what should be\nin it, that men should love lies; where neither they\nmake for pleasure, as with poets, nor for advantage, as with the merchant; but for the lie’s sake.\nBut I cannot tell; this same truth, is a naked, and\nopen day-light, that doth not show the masks, and\nmummeries, and triumphs, of the world, half so\nstately and daintily as candle-lights.  Truth may\nperhaps come to the price of a pearl, that showeth\nbest by day; but it will not rise to the price of a\ndiamond, or carbuncle, that showeth best in varied\nlights.  A mixture of a lie doth ever add pleasure.\nDoth any man doubt, that if there were taken out\nof men’s minds, vain opinions, flattering hopes,\nfalse valuations, imaginations as one would, and\nthe like, but it would leave the minds, of a number\nof men, poor shrunken things, full of melancholy\nand indisposition, and unpleasing to themselves?",
        "One of the fathers, in great severity, called poesy\nvinum daemonum, because it fireth the imagination; and yet, it is but with the shadow of a lie.\nBut it is not the lie that passeth through the mind,\nbut the lie that sinketh in, and settleth in it, that\ndoth the hurt; such as we spake of before.  But howsoever these things are thus in men’s depraved\njudgments, and affections, yet truth, which only\ndoth judge itself, teacheth that the inquiry of truth,\nwhich is the love-making, or wooing of it, the\nknowledge of truth, which is the presence of it, and\nthe belief of truth, which is the enjoying of it, is\nthe sovereign good of human nature.  The first\ncreature of God, in the works of the days, was the\nlight of the sense; the last, was the light of reason;\nand his sabbath work ever since, is the illumination of his Spirit.  First he breathed light, upon the\nface of the matter or chaos; then he breathed light,\ninto the face of man; and still he breatheth and inspireth light, into the face of his chosen.  The poet,\nthat beautified the sect, that was otherwise inferior to the rest, saith yet excellently well: It is a\npleasure, to stand upon the shore, and to see ships\ntossed upon the sea; a pleasure, to stand in the window of a castle, and to see a battle, and the adventures thereof below: but no pleasure is comparable\nto the standing upon the vantage ground of truth\n(a hill not to be commanded, and where the air is\nalways clear and serene), and to see the errors, and\nwanderings, and mists, and tempests, in the vale\nbelow; so always that this prospect be with pity,\nand not with swelling, or pride.  Certainly, it is\nheaven upon earth, to have a man’s mind move in\ncharity, rest in providence, and turn upon the\npoles of truth.",
        "To pass from theological, and philosophical\ntruth, to the truth of civil business; it will be acknowledged, even by those that practise it not, that\nclear, and round dealing, is the honor of man’s\nnature; and that mixture of falsehoods, is like alloy\nin coin of gold and silver, which may make the\nmetal work the better, but it embaseth it.  For these\nwinding, and crooked courses, are the goings of the\nserpent; which goeth basely upon the belly, and\nnot upon the feet.  There is no vice, that doth so\ncover a man with shame, as to be found false and\nperfidious.  And therefore Montaigne saith prettily, when he inquired the reason, why the word\nof the lie should be such a disgrace, and such an\nodious charge? Saith he, If it be well weighed, to\nsay that a man lieth, is as much to say, as that he is\nbrave towards God, and a coward towards men.\nFor a lie faces God, and shrinks from man.  Surely\nthe wickedness of falsehood, and breach of faith,\ncannot possibly be so highly expressed, as in that\nit shall be the last peal, to call the judgments of God\nupon the generations of men; it being foretold,\nthat when Christ cometh, he shall not find faith\nupon the earth.",
        "MEN fear death, as children fear to go in the\ndark; and as that natural fear in children,\nis increased with tales, so is the other.  Certainly,\nthe contemplation of death, as the wages of sin,\nand passage to another world, is holy and religious; but the fear of it, as a tribute due unto nature,\nis weak.  Yet in religious meditations, there is sometimes mixture of vanity, and of superstition.  You\nshall read, in some of the friars’ books of mortification, that a man should think with himself, what\nthe pain is, if he have but his finger’s end pressed,\nor tortured, and thereby imagine, what the pains\nof death are, when the whole body is corrupted,\nand dissolved; when many times death passeth,\nwith less pain than the torture of a limb; for the\nmost vital parts, are not the quickest of sense.  And\nby him that spake only as a philosopher, and natural man, it was well said, Pompa mortis magis\nterret, quam mors ipsa.  Groans, and convulsions,\nand a discolored face, and friends weeping, and\nblacks, and obsequies, and the like, show death\nterrible.  It is worthy the observing, that there is no\npassion in the mind of man, so weak, but it mates,\nand masters, the fear of death; and therefore,\ndeath is no such terrible enemy, when a man hath\nso many attendants about him, that can win the\ncombat of him.  Revenge triumphs over death; love\nslights it; honor aspireth to it; grief flieth to it; fear\npreoccupateth it; nay, we read, after Otho the emperor had slain himself, pity (which is the tenderest of affections) provoked many to die, out of mere\ncompassion to their sovereign, and as the truest\nsort of followers.  Nay, Seneca adds niceness and\nsatiety: Cogita quamdiu eadem feceris; mori velle,\nnon tantum fortis aut miser, sed etiam fastidiosus\npotest.  A man would die, though he were neither\nvaliant, nor miserable, only upon a weariness to\ndo the same thing so oft, over and over.  It is no less\nworthy, to observe, how little alteration in good\nspirits, the approaches of death make; for they\nappear to be the same men, till the last instant.\nAugustus Caesar died in a compliment; Livia, conjugii nostri memor, vive et vale.  Tiberius in dissimulation; as Tacitus saith of him, Jam Tiberium\nvires et corpus, non dissimulatio, deserebant.  Vespasian in a jest, sitting upon the stool; Ut puto deus\nfio.  Galba with a sentence; Feri, si ex re sit populi\nRomani; holding forth his neck.  Septimius Severus\nin despatch; Adeste si quid mihi restat agendum.\nAnd the like.  Certainly the Stoics bestowed too\nmuch cost upon death, and by their great preparations, made it appear more fearful.  Better saith he,\nqui finem vitae extremum inter munera ponat\nnaturae.  It is as natural to die, as to be born; and to\na little infant, perhaps, the one is as painful, as the\nother.  He that dies in an earnest pursuit, is like one\nthat is wounded in hot blood; who, for the time,\nscarce feels the hurt; and therefore a mind fixed,\nand bent upon somewhat that is good, doth avert\nthe dolors of death.  But, above all, believe it, the\nsweetest canticle is’, Nunc dimittis; when a man\nhath obtained worthy ends, and expectations.\nDeath hath this also; that it openeth the gate to\ngood fame, and extinguisheth envy. - Extinctus\namabitur idem.",
        "IN RELIGION",
        "RELIGION being the chief band of human society, it is a happy thing, when itself is well\ncontained within the true band of unity.  The\nquarrels, and divisions about religion, were evils\nunknown to the heathen.  The reason was, because\nthe religion of the heathen, consisted rather in\nrites and ceremonies, than in any constant belief.\nFor you may imagine, what kind of faith theirs\nwas, when the chief doctors, and fathers of their\nchurch, were the poets.  But the true God hath this\nattribute, that he is a jealous God; and therefore,\nhis worship and religion, will endure no mixture,\nnor partner.We shall therefore speak a few words,\nconcerning the unity of the church; what are the\nfruits thereof ; what the bounds; and what the\nmeans.",
        "The fruits of unity (next unto the well pleasing\nof God, which is all in all) are two: the one, towards\nthose that are without the church, the other,\ntowards those that are within.  For the former; it is\ncertain, that heresies, and schisms, are of all others\nthe greatest scandals; yea, more than corruption\nof manners.  For as in the natural body, a wound,\nor solution of continuity, is worse than a corrupt\nhumor; so in the spiritual.  So that nothing, doth so\nmuch keep men out of the church, and drive men\nout of the church, as breach of unity.  And therefore, whensoever it cometh to that pass, that one\nsaith, Ecce in deserto, another saith, Ecce in penetralibus; that is, when some men seek Christ, in the\nconventicles of heretics, and others, in an outward\nface of a church, that voice had need continually\nto sound in men’s ears, Nolite exire, - Go not out.\nThe doctor of the Gentiles (the propriety of whose\nvocation, drew him to have a special care of those\nwithout) saith, if an heathen come in, and hear\nyou speak with several tongues, will he not say\nthat you are mad? And certainly it is little better,\nwhen atheists, and profane persons, do hear of\nso many discordant, and contrary opinions in religion; it doth avert them from the church, and\nmaketh them, to sit down in the chair of the\nscorners. It is but a light thing, to be vouched in so\nserious a matter, but yet it expresseth well the\ndeformity.  There is a master of scoffing, that in his\ncatalogue of books of a feigned library, sets down\nthis title of a book, The Morris-Dance of Heretics.\nFor indeed, every sect of them, hath a diverse posture, or cringe by themselves, which cannot but\nmove derision in worldlings, and depraved politics,\nwho are apt to contemn holy things.",
        "As for the fruit towards those that are within; it\nis peace; which containeth infinite blessings.  It\nestablisheth faith; it kindleth charity; the outward\npeace of the church, distilleth into peace of conscience; and it turneth the labors of writing, and\nreading of controversies, into treaties of mortification and devotion.",
        "Concerning the bounds of unity; the true placing of them, importeth exceedingly.  There appear\nto be two extremes.  For to certain zealants, all\nspeech of pacification is odious.  Is it peace, Jehu,?\nWhat hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.  Peace is not the matter, but following,\nand party.  Contrariwise, certain Laodiceans, and\nlukewarm persons, think they may accommodate\npoints of religion, by middle way, and taking part\nof both, and witty reconcilements; as if they would\nmake an arbitrament between God and man.  Both\nthese extremes are to be avoided; which will be\ndone, if the league of Christians, penned by our\nSavior himself, were in two cross clauses thereof,\nsoundly and plainly expounded: He that is not\nwith us, is against us; and again, He that is not\nagainst us, is with us; that is, if the points fundamental and of substance in religion, were truly\ndiscerned and distinguished, from points not\nmerely of faith, but of opinion, order, or good intention.  This is a thing may seem to many a matter\ntrivial, and done already.  But if it were done less\npartially, it would be embraced more generally.",
        "Of this I may give only this advice, according to\nmy small model.  Men ought to take heed, of rending God’s church, by two kinds of controversies.\nThe one is, when the matter of the point controverted, is too small and light, not worth the heat\nand strife about it, kindled only by contradiction.\nFor, as it is noted, by one of the fathers, Christ’s\ncoat indeed had no seam, but the church’s vesture\nwas of divers colors; whereupon he saith, In veste\nvarietas sit, scissura non sit; they be two things,\nunity and uniformity.  The other is, when the\nmatter of the point controverted, is great, but it is\ndriven to an over-great subtilty, and obscurity; so\nthat it becometh a thing rather ingenious, than\nsubstantial.  A man that is of judgment and understanding, shall sometimes hear ignorant men differ, and know well within himself, that those\nwhich so differ, mean one thing, and yet they\nthemselves would never agree.  And if it come so\nto pass, in that distance of judgment, which is between man and man, shall we not think that God\nabove, that knows the heart, doth not discern that\nfrail men, in some of their contradictions, intend\nthe same thing; and accepteth of both? The nature\nof such controversies is excellently expressed, by\nSt. Paul, in the warning and precept, that he giveth\nconcerning the same, Devita profanas vocum novitates, et oppositiones falsi nominis scientiae.  Men\ncreate oppositions, which are not; and put them\ninto new terms, so fixed, as whereas the meaning\nought to govern the term, the term in effect governeth the meaning.There be also two false peaces,\nor unities: the one, when the peace is grounded,\nbut upon an implicit ignorance; for all colors will\nagree in the dark: the other, when it is pieced up,\nupon a direct admission of contraries, in fundamental points.  For truth and falsehood, in such\nthings, are like the iron and clay, in the toes of\nNebuchadnezzar’s image; they may cleave, but\nthey will not incorporate.",
        "Concerning the means of procuring unity; men\nmust beware, that in the procuring, or reuniting,\nof religious unity, they do not dissolve and deface\nthe laws of charity, and of human society.  There\nbe two swords amongst Christians, the spiritual\nand temporal; and both have their due office and\nplace, in the maintenance of religion.  But we may\nnot take up the third sword, which is Mahomet’s\nsword, or like unto it; that is, to propagate religion\nby wars, or by sanguinary persecutions to force\nconsciences; except it be in cases of overt scandal,\nblasphemy, or intermixture of practice against\nthe state; much less to nourish seditions; to authorize conspiracies and rebellions; to put the sword\ninto the people’s hands; and the like; tending to\nthe subversion of all government, which is the\nordinance of God.  For this is but to dash the first\ntable against the second; and so to consider men\nas Christians, as we forget that they are men.\nLucretius the poet, when he beheld the act of Agamemnon, that could endure the sacrificing of his\nown daughter, exclaimed: Tantum Religio potuit\nsuadere malorum.",
        "What would he have said, if he had known of\nthe massacre in France, or the powder treason of\nEngland? He would have been seven times more\nEpicure, and atheist, than he was.  For as the temporal sword is to be drawn with great circumspection in cases of religion; so it is a thing monstrous\nto put it into the hands of the common people.  Let\nthat be left unto the Anabaptists, and other furies.\nIt was great blasphemy, when the devil said, I will\nascend, and be like the highest; but it is greater\nblasphemy, to personate God, and bring him in\nsaying, I will descend, and be like the prince of\ndarkness; and what is it better, to make the cause\nof religion to descend, to the cruel and execrable\nactions of murthering princes, butchery of people,\nand subversion of states and governments? Surely\nthis is to bring down the Holy Ghost, instead of the\nlikeness of a dove, in the shape of a vulture or\nraven; and set, out of the bark of a Christian\nchurch, a flag of a bark of pirates, and assassins.\nTherefore it is most necessary, that the church, by\ndoctrine and decree, princes by their sword, and\nall learnings, both Christian and moral, as by their\nMercury rod, do damn and send to hell for ever,\nthose facts and opinions tending to the support of\nthe same; as hath been already in good part done.\nSurely in counsels concerning religion, that counsel of the apostle would be prefixed, Ira hominis\nnon implet justitiam Dei.  And it was a notable\nobservation of a wise father, and no less ingenuously confessed; that those which held and persuaded pressure of consciences, were commonly\ninterested therein., themselves, for their own ends.",
        "REVENGE is a kind of wild justice; which the\nmore man’ s nature runs to, the more ought\nlaw to weed it out.  For as for the first wrong, it\ndoth but offend the law; but the revenge of that\nwrong, putteth the law out of office.  Certainly, in\ntaking revenge, a man is but even with his enemy;\nbut in passing it over, he is superior; for it is a\nprince’s part to pardon.  And Solomon, I am sure,\nsaith, It is the glory of a man, to pass by an offence.\nThat which is past is gone, and irrevocable; and\nwise men have enough to do, with things present\nand to come; therefore they do but trifle with\nthemselves, that labor in past matters.  There is no\nman doth a wrong, for the wrong’s sake; but\nthereby to purchase himself profit, or pleasure, or\nhonor, or the like.  Therefore why should I be\nangry with a man, for loving himself better than\nme? And if any man should do wrong, merely out\nof ill-nature, why, yet it is but like the thorn or\nbriar, which prick and scratch, because they can\ndo no other.  The most tolerable sort of revenge, is\nfor those wrongs which there is no law to remedy;\nbut then let a man take heed, the revenge be such\nas there is no law to punish; else a man’s enemy is\nstill before hand, and it is two for one.  Some, when\nthey take revenge, are desirous, the party should\nknow, whence it cometh.  This is the more generous.  For the delight seemeth to be, not so much in\ndoing the hurt, as in making the party repent.  But\nbase and crafty cowards, are like the arrow that\nflieth in the dark.  Cosmus, duke of Florence, had a\ndesperate saying against perfidious or neglecting\nfriends, as if those wrongs were unpardonable;\nYou shall read (saith he) that we are commanded\nto forgive our enemies; but you never read, that we\nare commanded to forgive our friends.  But yet the\nspirit of Job was in a better tune: Shall we (saith\nhe) take good at God’s hands, and not be content to\ntake evil also? And so of friends in a proportion.\nThis is certain, that a man that studieth revenge,\nkeeps his own wounds green, which otherwise\nwould heal, and do well.  Public revenges are for\nthe most part fortunate; as that for the death of\nCaesar; for the death of Pertinax; for the death of\nHenry the Third of France; and many more.  But\nin private revenges, it is not so.  Nay rather, vindictive persons live the life of witches; who, as they\nare mischievous, so end they infortunate.",
        "IT WAS an high speech of Seneca (after the\nmanner of the Stoics), that the good things,\nwhich belong to prosperity, are to be wished; but\nthe good things, that belong to adversity, are to be\nadmired.  Bona rerum secundarum optabilia; adversarum mirabilia.  Certainly if miracles be the\ncommand over nature, they appear most in adversity.  It is yet a higher speech of his, than the other\n(much too high for a heathen), It is true greatness,\nto have in one the frailty of a man, and the security\nof a God.  Vere magnum habere fragilitatem hominis, securitatem Dei.  This would have done better\nin poesy, where transcendences are more allowed.\nAnd the poets indeed have been busy with it; for\nit is in effect the thing, which figured in that\nstrange fiction of the ancient poets, which seemeth\nnot to be without mystery; nay, and to have some\napproach to the state of a Christian; that Hercules,\nwhen he went to unbind Prometheus (by whom\nhuman nature is represented), sailed the length of\nthe great ocean, in an earthen pot or pitcher; lively\ndescribing Christian resolution, that saileth in the\nfrail bark of the flesh, through the waves of the\nworld.  But to speak in a mean.  The virtue of prosperity, is temperance; the virtue of adversity, is\nfortitude; which in morals is the more heroical\nvirtue.  Prosperity is the blessing of the Old Testament; adversity is the blessing of the New; which\ncarrieth the greater benediction, and the clearer\nrevelation of God’s favor.  Yet even in the Old\nTestament, if you listen to David’s harp, you shall\nhear as many hearse-like airs as carols; and the\npencil of the Holy Ghost hath labored more in describing the afflictions of Job, than the felicities of\nSolomon.  Prosperity is not without many fears\nand distastes; and adversity is not without comforts and hopes.  We see in needle-works and embroideries, it is more pleasing to have a lively work,\nupon a sad and solemn ground, than to have a dark\nand melancholy work, upon a lightsome ground:\njudge therefore of the pleasure of the heart, by the\npleasure of the eye.  Certainly virtue is like precious\nodors, most fragrant when they are incensed, or\ncrushed: for prosperity doth best discover vice, but\nadversity doth best discover virtue.",
        "DISSIMULATION is but a faint kind of policy, or wisdom; for it asketh a strong wit,\nand a strong heart, to know when to tell truth, and\nto do it.  Therefore it is the weaker sort of politics,\nthat are the great dissemblers.",
        "Tacitus saith, Livia sorted well with the arts of\nher husband, and dissimulation of her son; attributing arts or policy to Augustus, and dissimulation to Tiberius.  And again, when Mucianus\nencourageth Vespasian, to take arms against Vitellius, he saith, We rise not against the piercing\njudgment of Augustus, nor the extreme caution or\ncloseness of Tiberius.  These properties, of arts or\npolicy, and dissimulation or closeness, are indeed\nhabits and faculties several, and to be distinguished.  For if a man have that penetration of\njudgment, as he can discern what things are to\nbe laid open, and what to be secreted, and what to\nbe showed at half lights, and to whom and when\n(which indeed are arts of state, and arts of life, as\nTacitus well calleth them), to him, a habit of dissimulation is a hinderance and a poorness.  But if\na man cannot obtain to that judgment, then it is\nleft to bim generally, to be close, and a dissembler.\nFor where a man cannot choose, or vary in particulars, there it is good to take the safest, and wariest way, in general; like the going softly, by one\nthat cannot well see.  Certainly the ablest men\nthat ever were, have had all an openness, and\nfrankness, of dealing; and a name of certainty and\nveracity; but then they were like horses well\nmanaged; for they could tell passing well, when to\nstop or turn; and at such times, when they thought\nthe case indeed required dissimulation, if then\nthey used it, it came to pass that the former opinion, spread abroad, of their good faith and clearness of dealing, made them almost invisible.",
        "There be three degrees of this hiding and veiling of a man’s self.  The first, closeness, reservation,\nand secrecy; when a man leaveth himself without\nobservation, or without hold to be taken, what he\nis. The second, dissimulation, in the negative;\nwhen a man lets fall signs and arguments, that he\nis not, that he is.  And the third, simulation, in the\naffirmative; when a man industriously and expressly feigns and pretends to be, that he is not.",
        "For the first of these, secrecy; it is indeed the\nvirtue of a confessor.  And assuredly, the secret\nman heareth many confessions.  For who will open\nhimself, to a blab or a babbler? But if a man be\nthought secret, it inviteth discovery; as the more\nclose air sucketh in the more open; and as in confession, the revealing is not for worldly use, but for\nthe ease of a man’s heart, so secret men come to\nthe knowledge of many things in that kind; while\nmen rather discharge their minds, than impart\ntheir minds.  In few words, mysteries are due to\nsecrecy.  Besides (to say truth) nakedness is uncomely, as well in mind as body; and it addeth no\nsmall reverence, to men’s manners and actions, if\nthey be not altogether open.  As for talkers and\nfutile persons, they are commonly vain and credulous withal.  For he that talketh what he knoweth,\nwill also talk what he knoweth not.  Therefore set it\ndown, that an habit of secrecy, is both politic and\nmoral.  And in this part, it is good that a man’s face\ngive his tongue leave to speak.  For the discovery of\na man’ s self, by the tracts of his countenance, is a\ngreat weakness and betraying; by how much it is\nmany times more marked, and believed, than a\nman’s words.",
        "For the second, which is dissimulation; it followeth many times upon secrecy, by a necessity;\nso that he that will be secret, must be a dissembler\nin some degree.  For men are too cunning, to suffer\na man to keep an indifferent carriage between\nboth, and to be secret, without swaying the balance on either side.  They will so beset a man with\nquestions, and draw him on, and pick it out of him,\nthat, without an absurd silence, he must show an\ninclination one way; or if he do not, they will\ngather as much by his silence, as by his speech.  As\nfor equivocations, or oraculous speeches, they cannot hold out long.  So that no man can be secret,\nexcept he give himself a little scope of dissimulation; which is, as it were, but the skirts or train of\nsecrecy.",
        "But for the third degree, which is simulation,\nand false profession; that I hold more culpable,\nand less politic; except it be in great and rare matters.  And therefore a general custom of simulation\n(which is this last degree) is a vice, using either of\na natural falseness or fearfulness, or of a mind that\nhath some main faults, which because a man must\nneeds disguise, it maketh him practise simulation\nin other things, lest his hand should be out of use.",
        "The great advantages of simulation and dissimulation are three.  First, to lay asleep opposition,\nand to surprise.  For where a man’s intentions are\npublished, it is an alarum, to call up all that are\nagainst them.  The second is, to reserve to a man’s\nself a fair retreat.  For if a man engage himself by\na manifest declaration, he must go through or take\na fall.  The third is, the better to discover the mind\nof another.  For to him that opens himself, men\nwill hardly show themselves adverse; but will fair\nlet him go on, and turn their freedom of speech, to\nfreedom of thought.  And therefore it is a good\nshrewd proverb of the Spaniard, Tell a lie and find\na troth.  As if there were no way of discovery, but\nby simulation.  There be also three disadvantages,\nto set it even.  The first, that simulation and dissimulation commonly carry with them a show of\nfearfulness, which in any business, doth spoil the\nfeathers, of round flying up to the mark.  The second, that it puzzleth and perplexeth the conceits\nof many, that perhaps would otherwise co-operate\nwith him; and makes a man walk almost alone, to\nhis own ends.  The third and greatest is, that it\ndepriveth a man of one of the most principal instruments for action; which is trust and belief.\nThe best composition and temperature, is to have\nopenness in fame and opinion; secrecy in habit;\ndissimulation in seasonable use; and a power to\nfeign, if there be no remedy.",
        "AND CHILDREN",
        "THE joys of parents are secret; and so are their\ngriefs and fears.  They cannot utter the one;\nnor they will not utter the other.  Children sweeten\nlabors; but they make misfortunes more bitter.\nThey increase the cares of life; but they mitigate\nthe remembrance of death.  The perpetuity by\ngeneration is common to beasts; but memory,\nmerit, and noble works, are proper to men.  And\nsurely a man shall see the noblest works and foundations have proceeded from childless men; which\nhave sought to express the images of their minds,\nwhere those of their bodies have failed.  So the care\nof posterity is most in them, that have no posterity.\nThey that are the first raisers of their houses, are\nmost indulgent towards their children; beholding\nthem as the continuance, not only of their kind, but\nof their work; and so both children and creatures.",
        "The difference in affection, of parents towards\ntheir several children, is many times unequal; and\nsometimes unworthy; especially in the mothers;\nas Solomon saith, A wise son rejoiceth the father,\nbut an ungracious son shames the mother.  A man\nshall see, where there is a house full of children,\none or two of the eldest respected, and the youngest made wantons; but in the midst, some that\nare as it were forgotten, who many times, nevertheless, prove the best.  The illiberality of parents,\nin allowance towards their children, is an harmful\nerror; makes them base; acquaints them with\nshifts; makes them sort with mean company; and\nmakes them surfeit more when they come to\nplenty.  And therefore the proof is best, when men\nkeep their authority towards the children, but not\ntheir purse.  Men have a foolish manner (both parents and schoolmasters and servants) in creating\nand breeding an emulation between brothers, during childhood, which many times sorteth to discord when they are men, and disturbeth families.\nThe Italians make little difference between children, and nephews or near kinsfolks; but so they\nbe of the lump, they care not though they pass not\nthrough their own body.  And, to say truth, in\nnature it is much a like matter; insomuch that we\nsee a nephew sometimes resembleth an uncle, or\na kinsman, more than his own parent; as the blood\nhappens.  Let parents choose betimes, the vocations\nand courses they mean their children should take;\nfor then they are most flexible; and let them not\ntoo much apply themselves to the disposition of\ntheir children, as thinking they will take best to\nthat, which they have most mind to.  It is true, that\nif the affection or aptness of the children be extraordinary, then it is good not to cross it; but generally the precept is good, optimum elige, suave et\nfacile illud faciet consuetudo.  Younger brothers\nare commonly fortunate, but seldom or never\nwhere the elder are disinherited.",
        "AND SINGLE LIFE",
        "HE THAT hath wife and children hath given\nhostages to fortune; for they are impediments to great enterprises, either of virtue or mischief.  Certainly  the  best  works,  and  of  greatest\nmerit for the  public,  have  proceeded  from  the  unmarried or childless men; which both in affection\nand means, have married and endowed the public.\nYet it were great reason that those that have children, should have greatest care of future times;\nunto which they know they must transmit their\ndearest pledges.  Some there are, who though they\nlead a single life, yet their thoughts do end with\nthemselves, and account future times impertinences.  Nay, there are some other, that account\nwife and children, but as bills of charges.  Nay\nmore, there are some foolish rich covetous men,\nthat take a pride, in having no children, because\nthey may be thought so much the richer.  For perhaps they have heard some talk, Such an one is a\ngreat rich man, and another except to it, Yea, but\nhe hath a great charge of children; as if it were an\nabatement to his riches.  But the most ordinary\ncause of a single life, is liberty, especially in certain\nself-pleasing and humorous minds, which are so\nsensible of every restraint, as they will go near to\nthink their girdles and garters, to be bonds and\nshackles.  Unmarried men are best friends, best\nmasters, best servants; but not always best subjects; for they are light to run away; and almost\nall fugitives, are of that condition.  A single life\ndoth well with churchmen; for charity will hardly\nwater the ground, where it must first fill a pool.  It\nis indifferent for judges and magistrates; for if\nthey be facile and corrupt, you shall have a servant, five times worse than a wife.  For soldiers, I\nfind the generals commonly in their hortatives,\nput men in mind of their wives and children; and\nI think the despising of marriage amongst the\nTurks, maketh the vulgar soldier more base.  Certainly wife and children are a kind of discipline\nof humanity; and single men, though they may\nbe many times more charitable, because their\nmeans are less exhaust, yet, on the other side, they\nare more cruel and hardhearted (good to make\nsevere inquisitors), because their tenderness is not\nso oft called upon.  Grave natures, led by custom,\nand therefore constant, are commonly loving husbands, as was said of Ulysses, vetulam suam praetulit immortalitati.  Chaste women are often proud\nand froward, as presuming upon the merit of their\nchastity.  It is one of the best bonds, both of chastity\nand obedience, in the wife, if she think her husband wise; which she will never do, if she find him\njealous.  Wives are young men’s mistresses; companions for middle age; and old men’s nurses.  So\nas a man may have a quarrel to marry, when he\nwill.  But yet he was reputed one of the wise men,\nthat made answer to the question, when a man\nshould marry, - A young man not yet, an elder\nman not at all.  It is often seen that bad husbands,\nhave very good wives; whether it be, that it raiseth\nthe price of their husband’s kindness, when it\ncomes; or that the wives take a pride in their\npatience.  But this never fails, if the bad husbands\nwere of their own choosing, against their friends’\nconsent; for then they will be sure to make good\ntheir own folly.",
        "THERE be none of the affections, which have\nbeen noted to fascinate or bewitch, but love\nand envy.  They both have vehement wishes; they\nframe themselves readily into imaginations and\nsuggestions; and they come easily into the eye,\nespecially upon the present of the objects; which\nare the points that conduce to fascination, if any\nsuch thing there be.  We see likewise, the Scripture\ncalleth envy an evil eye; and the astrologers, call\nthe evil influences of the stars, evil aspects; so that\nstill there seemeth to be acknowledged, in the act\nof envy, an ejaculation or irradiation of the eye.\nNay, some have been so curious, as to note, that\nthe times when the stroke or percussion of an envious eye doth most hurt, are when the party envied\nis beheld in glory or triumph; for that sets an edge\nupon envy: and besides, at such times the spirits\nof the person envied, do come forth most into the\noutward parts, and so meet the blow.",
        "But leaving these curiosities (though not unworthy to be thought on, in fit place), we will\nhandle, what persons are apt to envy others; what\npersons are most subject to be envied themselves;\nand what is the difference between public and\nprivate envy.",
        "A man that hath no virtue in himself, ever envieth virtue in others.  For men’s minds, will either\nfeed upon their own good, or upon others’ evil; and\nwho wanteth the one, will prey upon the other;\nand whoso is out of hope, to attain to another’s\nvirtue, will seek to come at even hand, by depressing another’s fortune.",
        "A man that is busy, and inquisitive, is commonly envious.  For to know much of other men’s\nmatters, cannot be because all that ado may concern his own estate; therefore it must needs be,\nthat he taketh a kind of play-pleasure, in looking\nupon the fortunes of others.  Neither can he, that\nmindeth but his own business, find much matter\nfor envy.  For envy is a gadding passion, and walketh the streets, and doth not keep home: Non est\ncuriosus, quin idem sit malevolus.",
        "Men of noble birth, are noted to be envious\ntowards new men, when they rise.  For the distance\nis altered, and it is like a deceit of the eye, that\nwhen others come on, they think themselves, go\nback.",
        "Deformed persons, and eunuchs, and old men,\nand bastards, are envious.  For he that cannot possibly mend his own case, will do what he can, to\nimpair another’s; except these defects light upon\na very brave, and heroical nature, which thinketh\nto make his natural wants part of his honor; in that\nit should be said, that an eunuch, or a lame man,\ndid such great matters; affecting the honor of a\nmiracle; as it was in Narses the eunuch, and Agesilaus and Tamberlanes, that were lame men.",
        "The same is the case of men, that rise after calamities and misfortunes.  For they are as men\nfallen out with the times; and think other men’s\nharms, a redemption of their own sufferings.",
        "They that desire to excel in too many matters,\nout of levity and vain glory, are ever envious.  For\nthey cannot want work; it being impossible, but\nmany, in some one of those things, should surpass\nthem.  Which was the character of Adrian the Emperor; that mortally envied poets, and painters,\nand artificers, in works wherein he had a vein to\nexcel.",
        "Lastly, near kinsfolks, and fellows in office, and\nthose that have been bred together, are more apt\nto envy their equals, when they are raised.  For it\ndoth upbraid unto them their own fortunes, and\npointeth at them, and cometh oftener into their\nremembrance, and incurreth likewise more into\nthe note of others; and envy ever redoubleth from\nspeech and fame.  Cain’s envy was the more vile\nand malignant, towards his brother Abel, because\nwhen his sacrifice was better accepted, there was\nno body to look on.  Thus much for those, that are\napt to envy.",
        "Concerning those that are more or less subject\nto envy: First, persons of eminent virtue, when\nthey are advanced, are less envied.  For their fortune seemeth , but due unto them; and no man\nenvieth the payment of a debt, but rewards and\nliberality rather.  Again, envy is ever joined with\nthe comparing of a man’s self; and where there is\nno comparison, no envy; and therefore kings are\nnot envied, but by kings.  Nevertheless it is to be\nnoted, that unworthy persons are most envied, at\ntheir first coming in, and afterwards overcome it\nbetter; whereas contrariwise, persons of worth\nand merit are most envied, when their fortune\ncontinueth long.  For by that time, though their\nvirtue be the same, yet it hath not the same lustre;\nfor fresh men grow up that darken it.",
        "Persons of noble blood, are less envied in their\nrising.  For it seemeth but right done to their birth.\nBesides, there seemeth not much added to their\nfortune; and envy is as the sunbeams, that beat\nhotter upon a bank, or steep rising ground, than\nupon a flat.  And for the same reason, those that are\nadvanced by degrees, are less envied than those\nthat are advanced suddenly and per saltum.",
        "Those that have joined with their honor great\ntravels, cares, or perils, are less subject to envy.\nFor men think that they earn their honors hardly,\nand pity them sometimes; and pity ever healeth\nenvy.  Wherefore you shall observe, that the more\ndeep and sober sort of politic persons, in their\ngreataess, are ever bemoaning themselves, what\na life they lead; chanting a quanta patimur! Not\nthat they feel it so, but only to abate the edge of\nenvy.  But this is to be understood, of business that\nis laid upon men, and not such, as they call unto\nthemselves.  For nothing increaseth envy more,\nthan an unnecessary and ambitious engrossing of\nbusiness.  And nothing doth extinguish envy more,\nthan for a great person to preserve all other inferior officers, in their full lights and pre-eminences\nof their places.  For by that means, there be so\nmany screens between him and envy.",
        "Above all, those are most subject to envy, which\ncarry the greatness of their fortunes, in an insolent\nand proud manner; being never well, but while\nthey are showing how great they are, either by\noutward pomp, or by triumphing over all opposition or competition; whereas wise men will rather\ndo sacrifice to envy, in suffering themselves sometimes of purpose to be crossed, and overborne in\nthings that do not much concern them.  Notwithstanding, so much is true, that the carriage of\ngreatness, in a plain and open manner (so it be\nwithout arrogancy and vain glory) doth draw less\nenvy, than if it be in a more crafty and cunning\nfashion.  For in that course, a man doth but disavow fortune; and seemeth to be conscious of his\nown want in worth; and doth but teach others, to\nenvy him.",
        "Lastly, to conclude this part; as we said in the\nbeginning, that the act of envy had somewhat in\nit of witchcraft, so there is no other cure of envy,\nbut the cure of witchcraft; and that is, to remove\nthe lot (as they call it) and to lay it upon another.\nFor which purpose, the wiser sort of great persons,\nbring in ever upon the stage somebody upon whom\nto derive the envy, that would come upon themselves; sometimes upon ministers and servants;\nsometimes upon colleagues and associates; and the\nlike; and for that turn there are never wanting,\nsome persons of violent and undertaking natures,\nwho, so they may have power and business, will\ntake it at any cost.",
        "Now, to speak of public envy.  There is yet some\ngood in public envy, whereas in private, there is\nnone.  For public envy, is as an ostracism, that\neclipseth men, when they grow too great.  And\ntherefore it is a bridle also to great ones, to keep\nthem within bounds.",
        "This envy, being in the Latin word invidia,\ngoeth in the modern language, by the name of\ndiscontentment; of which we shall speak, in handling sedition.  It is a disease, in a state, like to infection.  For as infection spreadeth upon that which is\nsound, and tainteth it; so when envy is gotten once\ninto a state, it traduceth even the best actions\nthereof, and turneth them into an ill odor.  And\ntherefore there is little won, by intermingling of\nplausible actions.  For that doth argue but a weakness, and fear of envy, which hurteth so much the\nmore, as it is likewise usual in infections; which\nif you fear them, you call them upon you.",
        "This public envy, seemeth to beat chiefly upon\nprincipal officers or ministers, rather than upon\nkings, and estates themselves.  But this is a sure\nrule, that if the envy upon the minister be great,\nwhen the cause of it in him is small; or if the envy\nbe general, in a manner upon all the ministers of\nan estate; then the envy (though hidden) is truly\nupon the state itself.  And so much of public envy\nor discontentment, and the difference thereof from\nprivate envy, which was handled in the first place.",
        "We will add this in general, touching the affection of envy; that of all other affections, it is the\nmost importune and continual.  For of other affections, there is occasion given, but now and then;\nand therefore it was well said, Invidia festos dies\nnon agit: for it is ever working upon some or other.\nAnd it is also noted, that love and envy do make a\nman pine, which other affections do not, because\nthey are not so continual.  It is also the vilest affection, and the most depraved; for which cause it\nis the proper attribute of the devil, who is called,\nthe envious man, that soweth tares amongst the\nwheat by night; as it always cometh to pass, that\nenvy worketh subtilly, and in the dark, and to the\nprejudice of good things, such as is the wheat.",
        "THE stage is more beholding to love, than the\nlife of man.  For as to the stage, love is ever\nmatter of comedies, and now and then of tragedies;\nbut in life it doth much mischief; sometimes like a\nsiren, sometimes like a fury.  You may observe, that\namongst all the great and worthy persons (whereof\nthe memory remaineth, either ancient or recent)\nthere is not one, that hath been transported to\nthe mad degree of love: which shows that great\nspirits, and great business, do keep out this weak\npassion.  You must except, nevertheless, Marcus\nAntonius, the half partner of the empire of Rome,\nand Appius Claudius, the decemvir and lawgiver;\nwhereof the former was indeed a voluptuous man,\nand inordinate; but the latter was an austere and\nwise man: and therefore it seems (though rarely)\nthat love can find entrance, not only into an open\nheart, but also into a heart well fortified, if watch\nbe not well kept.  It is a poor saying of Epicurus,\nSatis  magnum  alter  alteri  theatrum  sumus;  as   if\nman,  made  for  the  contemplation  of   heaven,   and\nall noble objects, should do nothing but kneel before a little idol, and make himself a subject,\nthough not of the mouth (as beasts are), yet of the\neye; which was given him for higher purposes.  It\nis a strange thing, to note the excess of this passion,\nand how it braves the nature, and value of things,\nby this; that the speaking in a perpetual hyperbole, is comely in nothing but in love.  Neither is it\nmerely in the phrase; for whereas it hath been\nwell said, that the arch-flatterer, with whom all\nthe petty flatterers have intelligence, is a man’s\nself; certainly the lover is more.  For there was\nnever proud man thought so absurdly well of himself, as the lover doth of the person loved; and\ntherefore it was well said, That it is impossible to\nlove, and to be wise.  Neither doth this weakness\nappear to others only, and not to the party loved;\nbut to the loved most of all, except the love be reciproque.  For it is a true rule, that love is ever rewarded, either with the reciproque, or with an\ninward and secret contempt.  By how much the\nmore, men ought to beware of this passion, which\nloseth not only other things, but itself! As for the\nother losses, the poet’s relation doth well figure\nthem: that he that preferred Helena, quitted the\ngifts of Juno and Pallas.  For whosoever esteemeth\ntoo much of amorous affection, quitteth both riches\nand wisdom.  This passion hath his floods, in very\ntimes of weakness; which are great prosperity, and\ngreat adversity; though this latter hath been less\nobserved: both which times kindle love, and make\nit more fervent, and therefore show it to be the\nchild of folly.  They do best, who if they cannot but\nadmit love, yet make it keep quarters; and sever it\nwholly from their serious affairs, and actions, of\nlife; for if it check once with business, it troubleth\nmen’s fortunes, and maketh men, that they can no\nways be true to their own ends.  I know not how,\nbut martial men are given to love: I think, it is but\nas they are given to wine; for perils commonly ask\nto be paid in pleasures.  There is in man’s nature, a\nsecret inclination and motion, towards love of\nothers, which if it be not spent upon some one or a\nfew, doth naturally spread itself towards many,\nand maketh men become humane and charitable;\nas it is seen sometime in friars.  Nuptial love maketh\nmankind; friendly love perfecteth it; but wanton\nlove corrupteth, and embaseth it.",
        "MEN in great place are thrice servants: servants of the sovereign or state; servants of\nfame; and servants of business.  So as they have no\nfreedom; neither in their persons, nor in their actions, nor in their times.  It is a strange desire, to\nseek power and to lose liberty: or to seek power\nover others, and to lose power over a man’s self.\nThe rising unto place is laborious; and by pains,\nmen come to greater pains; and it is sometimes\nbase; and by indignities, men come to dignities.\nThe standing is slippery, and the regress is either\na downfall, or at least an eclipse, which is a melancholy thing.  Cum non sis qui fueris, non esse cur\nvelis vivere.  Nay, retire men cannot when they\nwould, neither will they, when it were reason; but\nare impatient of privateness, even in age and sickness, which require the shadow; like old townsmen, that will be still sitting at their street door,\nthough thereby they offer age to scom.  Certainly\ngreat persons had need to borrow other men’s\nopinions, to think themselves happy; for if they\njudge by their own feeling, they cannot find it; but\nif they think with themselves, what other men\nthink of them, and that other men would fain be,\nas they are, then they are happy, as it were, by\nreport; when perhaps they find the contrary\nwithin.  For they are the first, that find their own\ngriefs, though they be the last, that find their\nown faults.  Certainly men in great fortunes are\nstrangers to themselves, and while they are in the\npuzzle of business, they have no time to tend their\nhealth, either of body or mind.  Illi mors gravis\nincubat, qui notus nimis omnibus, ignotus moritur\nsibi.  In place, there is license to do good, and evil;\nwhereof the latter is a curse: for in evil, the best\ncondition is not to win; the second, not to can.  But\npower to do good, is the true and lawful end of\naspiring.  For good thoughts (though God accept\nthem) yet, towards men, are little better than good\ndreams, except they be put in act; and that cannot\nbe, without power and place, as the vantage, and\ncommanding ground.  Merit and good works, is\nthe end of man’s motion; and conscience of the\nsame is the accomplishment of man’s rest.  For if a\nman can be partaker of God’s theatre, he shall likewise be partaker of God’s rest.  Et conversus Deus,\nut aspiceret opera quae fecerunt manus suae, vidit\nquod omnia essent bona nimis; and then the sabbath.  In the discharge of thy place, set before thee\nthe best examples; for imitation is a globe of precepts.  And after a time, set before thee thine own\nexample; and examine thyself strictly, whether\nthou didst not best at first.  Neglect not also the\nexamples, of those that have carried themselves\nill, in the same place; not to set off thyself, by taxing their memory, but to direct thyself, what to\navoid.  Reform therefore, without bravery, or scandal of former times and persons; but yet set it down\nto thyself, as well to create good precedents, as to\nfollow them.  Reduce things to the first institution,\nand observe wherein, and how, they have degenerate; but yet ask counsel of both times; of the\nancient time, what is best; and of the latter time,\nwhat is fittest.  Seek to make thy course regular,\nthat men may know beforehand, what they may\nexpect; but be not too positive and peremptory;\nand express thyself well, when thou digressest\nfrom thy rule.  Preserve the right of thy place; but\nstir not questions of jurisdiction; and rather assume thy right, in silence and de facto, than voice\nit with claims, and challenges.  Preserve likewise\nthe rights of inferior places; and think it more\nhonor, to direct in chief, than to be busy in all.\nEmbrace and invite helps, and advices, touching\nthe execution of thy place; and do not drive away\nsuch, as bring thee information, as meddlers; but\naccept of them in good part.  The vices of authority\nare chiefly four: delays, corruption, roughness,\nand facility.  For delays: give easy access; keep\ntimes appointed; go through with that which is in\nhand, and interlace not business, but of necessity.\nFor corruption: do not only bind thine own hands,\nor thy servants’ hands, from taking, but bind the\nhands of suitors also, from offering.  For integrity\nused doth the one; but integrity professed, and\nwith a manifest detestation of bribery, doth the\nother.  And avoid not only the fault, but the suspicion.  Whosoever is found variable, and changeth\nmanifestly without manifest cause, giveth suspicion of corruption.  Therefore always, when thou\nchangest thine opinion or course, profess it plainly,\nand declare it, together with the reasons that move\nthee to change; and do not think to steal it.  A\nservant or a favorite, if he be inward, and no\nother apparent cause of esteem, is commonly\nthought, but a by-way to close corruption.  For\nroughness: it is a needless cause of discontent:\nseverity breedeth fear, but roughness breedeth\nhate.  Even reproofs from authority, ought to be\ngrave, and not taunting.  As for facility: it is worse\nthan bribery.  For bribes come but now and then;\nbut if importunity, or idle respects, lead a man, he\nshall never be without.  As Solomon saith, To respect persons is not good; for such a man will\ntransgress for a piece of bread.  It is most true, that\nwas anciently spoken, A place showeth the man.\nAnd it showeth some to the better, and some to the\nworse.  Omnium consensu capax imperii, nisi imperasset, saith Tacitus of Galba; but of Vespasian\nhe saith, Solus imperantium, Vespasianus mutatus\nin melius; though the one was meant of sufficiency,\nthe other of manners, and affection.  It is an assured\nsign of a worthy and generous spirit, whom honor\namends.  For honor is, or should be, the place of\nvirtue; and as in nature, things move violently to\ntheir place, and calmly in their place, so virtue in\nambition is violent, in authority settled and calm.\nAll rising to great place is by a winding star; and\nif there be factions, it is good to side a man’s self,\nwhilst he is in the rising, and to balance himself\nwhen he is placed.  Use the memory of thy predecessor, fairly and tenderly; for if thou dost not, it is\na debt will sure be paid when thou art gone.  If\nthou have colleagues, respect them, and rather call\nthem, when they look not for it, than exclude\nthem , when they have reason to look to be called.\nBe not too sensible, or too remembering, of thy\nplace in conversation, and private answers to\nsuitors; but let it rather be said, When he sits in\nplace, he is another man.",
        "IT IS a trivial grammar-school text, but yet\nworthy a wise man’s consideration.  Question\nwas asked of Demosthenes, what was the chief\npart of an orator? he answered, action; what next?\naction; what next again? action.  He said it, that\nknew it best, and had, by nature, himself no advantage in that he commended.  A strange thing,\nthat that part of an orator, which is but superficial,\nand rather the virtue of a player, should be placed\nso high, above those other noble parts, of invention,\nelocution, and the rest; nay, almost alone, as if it\nwere all in all.  But the reason is plain.  There is in\nhuman nature generally, more of the fool than of\nthe wise; and therefore those faculties, by which\nthe foolish part of men’s minds is taken, are most\npotent.  Wonderful like is the case of boldness in\ncivil business: what first? boldness; what second\nand third? boldness.  And yet boldness is a child of\nignorance and baseness, far inferior to other parts.\nBut nevertheless it doth fascinate, and bind hand\nand foot, those that are either shallow in judgment, or weak in courage, which are the greatest\npart; yea and prevaileth with wise men at weak\ntimes.  Therefore we see it hath done wonders, in\npopular states; but with senates, and princes less;\nand more ever upon the first entrance of bold persons into action, than soon after; for boldness is an\nill keeper of promise.  Surely, as there are mountebanks for the natural body, so are there mountebanks for the politic body; men that undertake\ngreat cures, and perhaps have been lucky, in two\nor three experiments, but want the grounds of\nscience, and therefore cannot hold out.  Nay, you\nshall see a bold fellow many times do Mahomet’s\nmiracle.  Mahomet made the people believe that\nhe would call an hill to him, and from the top of it\noffer up his prayers, for the observers of his law.\nThe people assembled; Mahomet called the hill to\ncome to him, again and again; and when the hill\nstood still, he was never a whit abashed, but said,\nIf the hill will not come to Mahomet, Mahomet\nwill go to the hill.  So these men, when they have\npromised great matters, and failed most shamefully, yet (if they have the perfection of boldness)\nthey will but slight it over, and make a turn, and\nno more ado.  Certainly to men of great judgment,\nbold persons are a sport to behold; nay, and to the\nvulgar also, boldness has somewhat of the ridiculous.  For if absurdity be the subject of laughter,\ndoubt you not but great boldness is seldom without\nsome absurdity.  Especially it is a sport to see, when\na bold fellow is out of countenance; for that puts\nhis face into a most shrunken, and wooden posture; as needs it must; for in bashfulness, the spirits\ndo a little go and come; but with bold men, upon\nlike occasion, they stand at a stay; like a stale at\nchess, where it is no mate, but yet the game cannot\nstir.  But this last were fitter for a satire than for a\nserious observation.  This is well to be weighed;\nthat boldness is ever blind; for it seeth not danger,\nand inconveniences.  Therefore it is ill in counsel,\ngood in execution; so that the right use of bold persons is, that they never command in chief, but be\nseconds, and under the direction of others.  For in\ncounsel, it is good to see dangers; and in execution,\nnot to see them, except they be very great.",
        "I TAKE goodness in this sense, the affecting of\nthe weal of men, which is that the Grecians\ncall philanthropia; and the word humanity (as\nit is used) is a little too light to express it.  Goodness I call the habit, and goodness of nature, the\ninclination.  This of all virtues, and dignities of the\nmind, is the greatest; being the character of the\nDeity: and without it, man is a busy, mischievous,\nwretched thing; no better than a kind of vermin.\nGoodness answers to the theological virtue, charity, and admits no excess, but error.  The desire of\npower in excess, caused the angels to fall; the desire\nof knowledge in excess, caused man to fall: but in\ncharity there is no excess; neither can angel, nor\nman, come in dan ger by it.  The inclination to goodness, is imprinted deeply in the nature of man; insomuch, that if it issue not towards men, it will\ntake unto other living creatures; as it is seen in the\nTurks, a cruel people, who nevertheless are kind\nto beasts, and give alms, to dogs and birds; insomuch, as Busbechius reporteth, a Christian boy, in\nConstantinople, had like to have been stoned, for\ngagging in a waggishness a long-billed fowl.\nErrors indeed in this virtue of goodness, or charity,\nmay be committed.  The Italians have an ungracious proverb, Tanto buon che val niente: so\ngood, that he is good for nothing.  And one of\nthe doctors of Italy, Nicholas Machiavel, had\nthe confidence to put in writing, almost in plain\nterms, That the Christian faith, had given up good\nmen, in prey to those that are tyrannical and unjust.  Which he spake, because indeed there was\nnever law, or sect, or opinion, did so much magnify goodness, as the Christian religion doth.\nTherefore, to avoid the scandal and the danger\nboth, it is good, to take knowledge of the errors of\nan habit so excellent.  Seek the good of other men,\nbut be not in bondage to their faces or fancies; for\nthat is but facility, or softness; which taketh an\nhonest mind prisoner.  Neither give thou AEsop’s\ncock a gem, who would be better pleased, and happier, if he had had a barley-corn.  The example of\nGod, teacheth the lesson truly: He sendeth his rain,\nand maketh his sun to shine, upon the just and\nunjust; but he doth not rain wealth, nor shine\nhonor and virtues, upon men equally.  Common\nbenefits, are to be communicate with all; but peculiar benefits, with choice.  And beware how in\nmaking the portraiture, thou breakest the pattern.\nFor divinity, maketh the love of ourselves the pattern; the love of our neighbors, but the portraiture.\nSell all thou hast, and give it to the poor, and follow me: but, sell not all thou hast, except thou\ncome and follow me; that is, except thou have a\nvocation, wherein thou mayest do as much good,\nwith little means as with great; for otherwise, in\nfeeding the streams, thou driest the fountain.\nNeither is there only a habit of goodness, directed\nby right reason; but there is in some men, even in\nnature, a disposition towards it; as on the other\nside, there is a natural malignity.  For there be,\nthat in their nature do not affect the good of others.\nThe lighter sort of malignity, turneth but to a\ncrassness, or frowardness, or aptness to oppose, or\ndifficulties, or the like; but the deeper sort, to envy\nand mere mischief.  Such men, in other men’s calamities, are, as it were, in season, and are ever on\nthe loading part: not so good as the dogs, that licked\nLazarus’ sores; but like flies, that are still buzzing\nupon any thing that is raw; misanthropi, that\nmake it their practice, to bring men to the bough,\nand yet never a tree for the purpose in their gardens, as Timon had.  Such dispositions, are the very\nerrors of human nature; and yet they are the fittest\ntimber, to make great politics of; like to knee timber, that is good for ships, that are ordained to be\ntossed; but not for building houses, that shall stand\nfirm.  The parts and signs of goodness, are many.  If\na man be gracious and courteous to strangers, it\nshows he is a citizen of the world, and that his heart\nis no island, cut off from other lands, but a continent, that joins to them.  If he be compassionate\ntowards the afflictions of others, it shows that his\nheart is like the noble tree, that is wounded itself,\nwhen it gives the balm.  If he easily pardons, and\nremits offences, it shows that his mind is planted\nabove injuries; so that he cannot be shot.  If he be\nthankful for small benefits, it shows that he weighs\nmen’s minds, and not their trash.  But above all, if\nhe have St. Paul’s perfection, that he would wish\nto be anathema from Christ, for the salvation of\nhis brethren, it shows much of a divine nature, and\na kind of conformity with Christ himself",
        "WE WILL speak of nobility, first as a portion\nof an estate, then as a condition of particular persons.  A monarchy, where there is no nobility at all, is ever a pure and absolute tyranny; as\nthat of the Turks.  For nobility attempers sovereignty, and draws the eyes of the people, somewhat\naside from the line royal.  But for democracies,\nthey need it not; and they are commonly more\nquiet, and less subject to sedition, than where there\nare stirps of nobles.  For men’s eyes are upon the\nbusiness, and not upon the persons; or if upon the\npersons, it is for the business’ sake, as fittest, and\nnot for flags and pedigree.  We see the Switzers last\nwell, notwithstanding their diversity of religion,\nand of cantons.  For utility is their bond, and not\nrespects.  The united provinces of the Low Countries, in their government, excel; for where there\nis an equality, the consultations are more indifferent, and the payments and tributes, more\ncheerful.  A great and potent nobility, addeth\nmajesty to a monarch, but diminisheth power;\nand putteth life and spirit into the people, but\npresseth their fortune.  It is well, when nobles are\nnot too great for sovereignty nor for justice; and\nyet maintained in that height, as the insolency of\ninferiors may be broken upon them, before it come\non too fast upon the majesty of kings.  A numerous\nnobility causeth poverty, and inconvenience in a\nstate; for it is a surcharge of expense; and besides,\nit being of necessity, that many of the nobility fall,\nin time, to be weak in fortune, it maketh a kind of\ndisproportion, between honor and means.",
        "As for nobility in particular persons; it is a reverend thing, to see an ancient castle or building,\nnot in decay; or to see a fair timber tree, sound and\nperfect.  How much more, to behold an ancient\nnoble family, which has stood against the waves\nand weathers of time! For new nobility is but the\nact of power, but ancient nobility is the act of time.\nThose that are first raised to nobility, are commonly more virtuous, but less innocent, than their\ndescendants; for there is rarely any rising, but by\na commixture of good and evil arts.  But it is reason,\nthe memory of their virtues remain to their posterity, and their faults die with themselves.  Nobility of birth commonly abateth industry; and he\nthat is not industrious, envieth him that is.  Besides,\nnoble persons cannot go much higher; and he that\nstandeth at a stay, when others rise, can hardly\navoid motions of envy.  On the other side, nobility extinguisheth the passive envy from others,\ntowards them; because they are in possession of\nhonor.  Certainly, kings that have able men of\ntheir nobility, shall find ease in employing them,\nand a better slide into their business; for people\nnaturally bend to them, as born in some sort to\ncommand.",
        "AND TROUBLES",
        "SHEPHERDS of people, had need know the\ncalendars of tempests in state; which are commonly greatest, when things grow to equality; as\nnatural tempests are greatest about the Equinoctia.  And as there are certain hollow blasts of wind,\nand secret swellings of seas before a tempest, so\nare there in states:",
        "Libels and licentious discourses against the state,\nwhen they are frequent and open; and in like sort,\nfalse news often running up and down, to the disadvantage of the state, and hastily embraced; are\namongst the signs of troubles.  Virgil, giving the\npedigree of Fame, saith, she was sister to the Giants:",
        "Illam Terra parens, irra irritata deorum,\nExtremam (ut perhibent) Coeo Enceladoque sororem\nProgenuit.-",
        "As if fames were the relics of seditions past; but\nthey are no less, indeed, the preludes of seditions to\ncome.  Howsoever he noteth it right, that seditious\ntumults, and seditious fames, differ no more but\nas brother and sister, masculine and feminine; especially if it come to that, that the best actions of\na state, and the most plausible, and which ought\nto give greatest contentment, are taken in ill sense,\nand traduced: for that shows the envy great, as\nTacitus saith; conflata magna invidia, seu bene\nseu male gesta premunt.  Neither doth it follow,\nthat because these fames are a sign of troubles, that\nthe suppressing of them with too much severity,\nshould be a remedy of troubles.  For the despising\nof them, many times checks them best; and the\ngoing about to stop them, doth but make a wonder\nlong-lived.  Also that kind of obedience, which\nTacitus speaketh of, is to be held suspected: Erant\nin officio, sed tamen qui mallent mandata imperantium interpretari quam exequi; disputing, excusing, cavilling upon mandates and directions, is\na kind of shaking off the yoke, and assay of disobedience; especially if in those disputings, they\nwhich are for the direction, speak fearfully and\ntenderly, and those that are against it, audaciously.",
        "Also, as Machiavel noteth well, when princes,\nthat ought to be common parents, make themselves as a party, and lean to a side, it is as a boat,\nthat is overthrown by uneven weight on the one\nside; as was well seen, in the time of Henry the\nThird of France; for first, himself entered league\nfor the extirpation of the Protestants; and presently after, the same league was turned upon himself.  For when the authority of princes, is made\nbut an accessory to a cause, and that there be other\nbands, that tie faster than the band of sovereignty,\nkings begin to be put almost out of possession.",
        "Also, when discords, and quarrels, and factions\nare carried openly and audaciously, it is a sign the\nreverence of government is lost.  For the motions\nof the greatest persons in a government, ought to\nbe as the motions of the planets under primum\nmobile; according to the old opinion: which is,\nthat every of them, is carried swiftly by the\nhighest motion, and softly in their own motion.\nAnd therefore, when great ones in their own\nparticular motion, move violently, and, as Tacitus\nexpresseth it well, liberius quam ut imperantium meminissent; it is a sign the orbs are out\nof frame.  For reverence is that, wherewith princes\nare girt from God; who threateneth the dissolving\nthereof; Solvam cingula regum.",
        "So when any of the four pillars of government,\nare mainly shaken, or weakened (which are religion, justice, counsel, and treasure), men had need\nto pray for fair weather.  But let us pass from this\npart of predictions (concerning which, nevertheless, more light may be taken from that which\nfolloweth); and let us speak first, of the materials\nof seditions; then of the motives of them; and\nthirdly of the remedies.",
        "Concerning the materials of seditions.  It is a\nthing well to be considered; for the surest way to\nprevent seditions (if the times do bear it) is to take\naway the matter of them.  For if there be fuel prepared, it is hard to tell, whence the spark shall\ncome, that shall set it on fire.  The matter of seditions is of two kinds: much poverty, and much discontentment.  It is certain, so many overthrown\nestates, so many votes for troubles.  Lucan noteth\nwell the state of Rome before the Civil War,",
        "Hinc usura vorax, rapidumque in tempore foenus,\nHinc concussa fides, et multis utile bellum.",
        "This same multis utile bellum, is an assured and\ninfallible sign, of a state disposed to seditions and\ntroubles.  And if this poverty and broken estate in\nthe better sort, be joined with a want and necessity\nin the mean people, the danger is imminent and\ngreat.  For the rebellions of the belly are the worst.\nAs for discontentments, they are, in the politic\nbody, like to humors in the natural, which are apt\nto gather a preternatural heat, and to inflame.\nAnd let no prince measure the danger of them by\nthis, whether they be just or unjust: for that were\nto imagine people, to be too reasonable; who do\noften spurn at their own good: nor yet by this,\nwhether the griefs whereupon they rise, be in fact\ngreat or small: for they are the most dangerous\ndiscontentments, where the fear is greater than\nthe feeling.  Dolendi modus, timendi non item.\nBesides, in great oppressions, the same things that\nprovoke the patience, do withal mate the courage;\nbut in fears it is not so.  Neither let any prince, or\nstate, be secure concerning discontentments, because they have been often, or have been long, and\nyet no peril hath ensued: for as it is true, that every\nvapor or fume doth not turn into a storm; so it is\nnevertheless true, that storms, though they blow\nover divers times, yet may fall at last; and, as the\nSpanish proverb noteth well, The cord breaketh at\nthe last by the weakest pull.",
        "The causes and motives of seditions are, innovation in religion; taxes; alteration of laws and customs; breaking of privileges; general oppression;\nadvancement of unworthy persons; strangers;\ndearths; disbanded soldiers; factions grown desperate; and what soever, in offending people,\njoineth and knitteth them in a common cause.",
        "For the remedies; there may be some general\npreservatives, whereof we will speak: as for the\njust cure, it must answer to the particular disease;\nand so be left to counsel, rather than rule.",
        "The first remedy or prevention is to remove, by\nall means possible, that material cause of sedition\nwhereof we spake; which is, want and poverty in\nthe estate.  To which purpose serveth the opening,\nand well-balancing of trade; the cherishing of\nmanufactures; the banishing of idleness; the repressing of waste, and excess, by sumptuary laws;\nthe improvement and husbanding of the soil; the\nregulating of prices of things vendible; the moderating of taxes and tributes; and the like.  Generally,\nit is to be foreseen that the population of a kingdom (especially if it be not mown down by wars)\ndo not exceed the stock of the kingdom, which\nshould maintain them.  Neither is the population\nto be reckoned only by number; for a smaller number, that spend more and earn less, do wear out an\nestate sooner, than a greater number that live\nlower, and gather more.  Therefore the multiplying of nobility, and other degrees of quality, in an\nover proportion to the common people, doth speedily bring a state to necessity; and so doth likewise\nan overgrown clergy; for they bring nothing to\nthe stock; and in like manner, when more are bred\nscholars, than preferments can take off .",
        "It is likewise to be remembered, that forasmuch\nas the increase of any estate must be upon the\nforeigner (for whatsoever is somewhere gotten, is\nsomewhere lost), there be but three things, which\none nation selleth unto another; the commodity as\nnature yieldeth it; the manufacture; and the vecture, or carriage.  So that if these three wheels go,\nwealth will flow as in a spring tide.  And it cometh\nmany times to pass, that materiam superabit opus;\nthat the work and carriage is more worth than the\nmaterial, and enricheth a state more; as is notably\nseen in the Low-Countrymen, who have the best\nmines above ground, in the world.",
        "Above all things, good policy is to be used, that\nthe treasure and moneys, in a state, be not gathered into few hands.  For otherwise a state may\nhave a great stock, and yet starve.  And money is\nlike muck, not good except it be spread.  This is\ndone, chiefly by suppressing, or at least keeping\na strait hand, upon the devouring trades of usury,\ningrossing great pasturages, and the like.",
        "For removing discontentments, or at least the\ndanger of them; there is in every state (as we\nknow) two portions of subjects; the noblesse and\nthe commonalty.  When one of these is discontent,\nthe danger is not great; for common people are of\nslow motion, if they be not excited by the greater\nsort; and the greater sort are of small strength,\nexcept the multitude be apt, and ready to move of\nthemselves.  Then is the danger, when the greater\nsort, do but wait for the troubling of the waters\namongst the meaner, that then they may declare\nthemselves.  The poets feign, that the rest of the\ngods would have bound Jupiter; which he hearing\nof, by the counsel of Pallas, sent for Briareus, with\nhis hundred hands, to come in to his aid.  An emblem, no doubt, to show how safe it is for monarchs, to make sure of the good will of common\npeople.  To give moderate liberty for griefs and discontentments to evaporate (so it be without too\ngreat insolency or bravery), is a safe way.  For he\nthat turneth the humors back, and maketh the\nwound bleed inwards, endangereth malign ulcers,\nand pernicious imposthumations.",
        "The part of Epimetheus mought well become\nPrometheus, in the case of discontentments: for\nthere is not a better provision against them.  Epimetheus, when griefs and evils flew abroad, at last\nshut the lid, and kept hope in the bottom of the\nvessel.  Certainly, the politic and artificial nourishing, and entertaining of hopes, and carrying men\nfrom hopes to hopes, is one of the best antidotes\nagainst the poison of discontentments.  And it is a\ncertain sign of a wise government and proceeding,\nwhen it can hold men’s hearts by hopes, when it\ncannot by satisfaction; and when it can handle\nthings, in such manner, as no evil shall appear so\nperemptory, but that it hath some outlet of hope;\nwhich is the less hard to do, because both particular persons and factions, are apt enough to flatter\nthemselves, or at least to brave that, which they\nbelieve not.",
        "Also the foresight and prevention, that there be\nno likely or fit head, whereunto discontented persons may resort, and under whom they may join,\nis a known, but an excellent point of caution.  I\nunderstand a fit head, to be one that hath greatness and reputation; that hath confidence with\nthe discontented party, and upon whom they turn\ntheir eyes; and that is thought discontented, in his\nown particular: which kind of persons, are either\nto be won, and reconciled to the state, and that in\na fast and true manner; or to be fronted with some\nother, of the same party, that may oppose them,\nand so divide the reputation.  Generally, the dividing and breaking, of all factions and combinations\nthat are adverse to the state, and setting them at\ndistance, or at least distrust, amongst themselves,\nis not one of the worst remedies.  For it is a desperate case, if those that hold with the proceeding of\nthe state, be full of discord and faction, and those\nthat are against it, be entire and united.",
        "I have noted, that some witty and sharp\nspeeches, which have fallen from princes, have\ngiven fire to seditions.  Caesar did himself infinite\nhurt in that speech, Sylla nescivit literas, non potuit dictare; for it did utterly cut off that hope,\nwhich men had entertained, that he would at one\ntime or other give over his dictatorship.  Galba undid himself by that speech, legi a se militem, non\nemi; for it put the soldiers out of hope of the donative.  Probus likewise, by that speech, Si vixero,\nnon opus erit amplius Romano imperio militibus;\na speech of great despair for the soldiers.  And\nmany the like.  Surely princes had need, in tender\nmatters and ticklish times, to beware what they\nsay; especially in these short speeches, which fly\nabroad like darts, and are thought to be shot out of\ntheir secret intentions.  For as for large  discourses,\nthey are flat things, and not so much noted.",
        "Lastly, let princes, against all events, not be\nwithout some great person, one or rather more, of\nmilitary valor, near unto them, for the repressing\nof seditions in their beginnings.  For without that,\nthere useth to be more trepidation in court upon\nthe first breaking out of troubles, than were fit.\nAnd the state runneth the danger of that which\nTacitus saith; Atque is habitus animorum fuit, ut\npessimum facinus auderent pauci, plures vellent,\nomnes paterentur.  But let such military persons be\nassured, and well reputed of, rather than factious\nand popular; holding also good correspondence\nwith the other great men in the state; or else the\nremedy, is worse than the disease.",
        "I HAD rather believe all the fables in the Legend, and the Talmud, and the Alcoran, than\nthat this universal frame is without a mind.\nAnd therefore, God never wrought miracle, to\nconvince atheism, because his ordinary works convince it.  It is true, that a little philosophy inclineth\nman’s mind to atheism; but depth in philosophy\nbringeth men’s minds about to religion.  For while\nthe mind of man looketh upon second causes scattered, it may sometimes rest in them, and go no\nfurther; but when it beholdeth the chain of them,\nconfederate and linked together, it must needs fly\nto Providence and Deity.  Nay, even that school\nwhich is most accused of atheism doth most demonstrate religion; that is, the school of Leucippus\nand Democritus and Epicurus.  For it is a thousand\ntimes more credible, that four mutable elements,\nand one immutable fifth essence, duly and eternally placed, need no God, than that an army of\ninfinite small portions, or seeds unplaced, should\nhave produced this order and beauty, without a\ndivine marshal.  The Scripture saith, The fool hath\nsaid in his heart, there is no God; it is not said, The\nfool hath thought in his heart; so as he rather saith\nit, by rote to himself, as that he would have, than\nthat he can thoroughly believe it, or be persuaded\nof it.  For none deny, there is a God, but those, for\nwhom it maketh that there were no God.  It appeareth in nothing more, that atheism is rather in\nthe lip, than in the heart of man, than by this; that\natheists will ever be talking of that their opinion,\nas if they fainted in it, within themselves, and\nwould be glad to be strengthened, by the consent\nof others.  Nay more, you shall have atheists strive\nto get disciples, as it fareth with other sects.  And,\nwhich is most of all, you shall have of them, that\nwill suffer for atheism, and not recant; whereas if\nthey did truly think, that there were no such thing\nas God, why should they trouble themselves? Epicurus is charged, that he did but dissemble for his\ncredit’s sake, when he affirmed there were blessed\nnatures, but such as enjoyed themselves, without\nhaving respect to the government of the world.\nWherein they say he did temporize; though in\nsecret, he thought there was no God.  But certainly\nhe is traduced; for his words are noble and divine:\nNon deos vulgi negare profanum; sed vulgi opiniones diis applicare profanum.  Plato could have\nsaid no more.  And although he had the confidence,\nto deny the administration, he had not the power,\nto deny the nature.  The Indians of the West, have\nnames for their particular gods, though they have\nno name for God: as if the heathens should have\nhad the names Jupiter, Apollo, Mars, etc., but not\nthe word Deus; which shows that even those barbarous people have the notion, though they have\nnot the latitude and extent of it.  So that against\natheists, the very savages take part, with the very\nsubtlest philosophers.  The contemplative atheist is\nrare: a Diagoras, a Bion, a Lucian perhaps, and\nsome others; and yet they seem to be more than\nthey are; for that all that impugn a received religion, or superstition, are by the adverse part\nbranded with the name of atheists.  But the great\natheists, indeed are hypocrites; which are ever\nhandling holy things, but without feeling; so as\nthey must needs be cauterized in the end.  The\ncauses of atheism are: divisions in religion, if they\nbe many; for any one main division, addeth zeal to\nboth sides; but many divisions introduce atheism.\nAnother is, scandal of priests; when it is come to\nthat which St. Bernard saith, non est jam dicere,\nut populus sic sacerdos; quia nec sic populus ut\nsacerdos.  A third is, custom of profane scoffing in\nholy matters; which doth, by little and little, deface the reverence of religion.  And lastly, learned\ntimes, specially with peace and prosperity; for\ntroubles and adversities do more bow men’s minds\nto religion.  They that deny a God, destroy man’s\nnobility; for certainly man is of kin to the beasts,\nby his body; and, if he be not of kin to God, by his\nspirit, he is a base and ignoble creature.  It destroys\nlikewise magnanimity, and the raising of human\nnature; for take an example of a dog, and mark\nwhat a generosity and courage he will put on,\nwhen he finds himself maintained by a man; who\nto him is instead of a God, or melior natura; which\ncourage is manifestly such, as that creature, without that confidence of a better nature than his own,\ncould never attain.  So man, when he resteth and\nassureth himself, upon divine protection and\nfavor, gathered a force and faith, which human\nnature in itself could not obtain.  Therefore, as\natheism is in all respects hateful, so in this, that it\ndepriveth human nature of the means to exalt itself, above human frailty.  As it is in particular\npersons, so it is in nations.  Never was there such a\nstate for magnanimity as Rome.  Of this state hear\nwhat Cicero saith: Quam volumus licet, patres conscripti, nos amemus, tamen nec numero Hispanos,\nnec robore Gallos, nec calliditate Poenos, nec artibus Graecos, nec denique hoc ipso hujus gentis et\nterrae domestico nativoque sensu Italos ipsos et\nLatinos; sed pietate, ac religione, atque hac una\nsapientia, quod deorum immortalium numine\nomnia regi gubernarique perspeximus, omnes\ngentes nationesque superavimus.",
        "IT WERE better to have no opinion of God at all,\nthan such an opinion, as is unworthy of him.\nFor the one is unbelief, the other is contumely;\nand certainly superstition is the reproach of the\nDeity.  Plutarch saith well to that purpose: Surely\n(saith he) I had rather a great deal, men should\nsay, there was no such man at all, as Plutarch,\nthan that they should say, that there was one Plutarch, that would eat his children as soon as they\nwere born; as the poets speak of Saturn.  And as the\ncontumely is greater towards God, so the danger is\ngreater towards men.  Atheism leaves a man to\nsense, to philosophy, to natural piety, to laws, to\nreputation; all which may be guides to an outward\nmoral virtue, though religion were not; but superstition dismounts all these, and erecteth an absolute monarchy, in the minds of men.  Therefore\ntheism did never perturb states; for it makes men\nwary of themselves, as looking no further: and we\nsee the times inclined to atheism (as the time of\nAugustus Caesar) were civil times.  But superstition hath been the confusion of many states, and\nbringeth in a new primum mobile, that ravisheth\nall the spheres of government.The master of superstition, is the people; and in all superstition, wise\nmen follow fools; and arguments are fitted to practice, in a reversed order.  It was gravely said by\nsome of the prelates in the Council of Trent, where\nthe doctrine of the Schoolmen bare great sway,\nthat the Schoolmen were like astronomers, which\ndid feign eccentrics and epicycles, and such engines of orbs, to save the phenomena; though they\nknew there were no such things; and in like manner, that the Schoolmen had framed a number of\nsubtle and intricate axioms, and theorems, to save\nthe practice of the church.  The causes of superstition are: pleasing and sensual rites and ceremonies;\nexcess of outward and pharisaical holiness; overgreat reverence of traditions, which cannot but\nload the church; the stratagems of prelates, for\ntheir own ambition and lucre; the favoring too\nmuch of good intentions, which openeth the gate\nto conceits and novelties; the taking an aim at\ndivine matters, by human, which cannot but\nbreed mixture of imaginations: and, lastly, barbarous times, especially joined with calamities\nand disasters.  Superstition, without a veil, is a deformed thing; for, as it addeth deformity to an\nape, to be so like a man, so the similitude of superstition to religion, makes it the more deformed.\nAnd as wholesome meat corrupteth to little worms,\nso good forms and orders corrupt, into a number of\npetty observances.  There is a superstition in avoiding superstition, when men think to do best, if they\ngo furthest from the superstition, formerly received; therefore care would be had that (as it\nfareth in ill purgings) the good be not taken away\nwith the bad; which commonly is done, when the\npeople is the reformer.",
        "TRAVEL, in the younger sort, is a part of education, in the elder, a part of experience.  He\nthat travelleth into a country, before he hath some\nentrance into the language, goeth to school, and\nnot to travel.  That young men travel under some\ntutor, or grave servant, I allow well; so that he be\nsuch a one that hath the language, and hath been\nin the country before; whereby he may be able\nto tell them what things are worthy to be seen, in\nthe country where they go; what acquaintances\nthey are to seek; what exercises, or discipline, the\nplace yieldeth.  For else, young men shall go\nhooded, and look abroad little.  It is a strange thing,\nthat in sea voyages, where there is nothing to be\nseen, but sky and sea, men should make diaries;\nbut in land-travel, wherein so much is to be observed, for the most part they omit it; as if chance\nwere fitter to be registered, than observation.  Let\ndiaries, therefore, be brought in use.  The things to\nbe seen and observed are: the courts of princes,\nespecially when they give audience to ambassadors; the courts of justice, while they sit and hear\ncauses; and so of consistories ecclesiastic; the\nchurches and monasteries, with the monuments\nwhich are therein extant; the walls and fortifications of cities, and towns, and so the heavens and\nharbors; antiquities and ruins; libraries; colleges,\ndisputations, and lectures, where any are; shipping and navies; houses and gardens of state and\npleasure, near great cities; armories; arsenals;\nmagazines; exchanges; burses; warehouses; exercises of horsemanship, fencing, training of soldiers, and the like; comedies, such whereunto the\nbetter sort of persons do resort; treasuries of jewels\nand robes; cabinets and rarities; and, to conclude,\nwhatsoever is memorable, in the places where\nthey go.  After all which, the tutors, or servants,\nought to make diligent inquiry.  As for triumphs,\nmasks, feasts, weddings, funerals, capital executions, and such shows, men need not to be put in\nmind of them; yet are they not to be neglected.  If\nyou will have a young man to put his travel into a\nlittle room, and in short time to gather much, this\nyou must do.  First, as was said, he must have some\nentrance into the language before he goeth.  Then\nhe must have such a servant, or tutor, as knoweth\nthe country, as was likewise said.  Let him carry\nwith him also, some card or book, describing the\ncountry where he travelleth; which will be a good\nkey to his inquiry.  Let him keep also a diary.  Let\nhim not stay long, in one city or town; more or less\nas the place deserveth, but not long; nay, when he\nstayeth in one city or town, let him change his\nlodging from one end and part of the town, to another; which is a great adamant of acquaintance.\nLet him sequester himself, from the company of\nhis countrymen, and diet in such places, where\nthere is good company of the nation where he\ntravelleth.  Let him, upon his removes from one\nplace to another, procure recommendation to some\nperson of quality, residing in the place whither he\nremoveth; that he may use his favor, in those\nthings he desireth to see or know.  Thus he may\nabridge his travel, with much profit.  As for the\nacquaintance, which is to be sought in travel; that\nwhich is most of all profitable, is acquaintance\nwith the secretaries and employed men of ambassadors: for so in travelling in one country, he shall\nsuck the experience of many.  Let him also see, and\nvisit, eminent persons in all kinds, which are of\ngreat name abroad; that he may be able to tell,\nhow the life agreeth with the fame.  For quarrels,\nthey are with care and discretion to be avoided.\nThey are commonly for mistresses, healths, place,\nand words.  And let a man beware,  how he keepeth\ncompany with choleric and quarrelsome persons;\nfor they will engage him into their own quarrels.\nWhen a traveller returneth home, let him not\nleave the countries, where he hath travelled, altogether behind him; but maintain a correspondence by letters, with those of his acquaintance,\nwhich are of most worth.  And let his travel appear\nrather in his discourse, than his apparel or gesture;\nand in his discourse, let him be rather advised in\nhis answers, than forward to tell stories; and let it\nappear that he doth not change his country manners, for those of foreign parts; but only prick in\nsome flowers, of that he hath learned abroad, into\nthe customs of his own country.",
        "IT IS a miserable state of mind, to have few\nthings to desire, and many things to fear; and\nyet that commonly is the case of kings; who, being\nat the highest, want matter of desire, which makes\ntheir minds more languishing; and have many representations of perils and shadows, which makes\ntheir minds the less clear.  And this is one reason\nalso, of that effect which the Scripture speaketh of,\nThat the king’s heart is inscrutable.  For multitude\nof jealousies, and lack of some predominant desire, that should marshal and put in order all the\nrest, maketh any man’s heart, hard to find or\nsound.  Hence it comes likewise, that princes many\ntimes make themselves desires, and set their hearts\nupon toys; sometimes upon a building; sometimes\nupon erecting of an order; sometimes upon the advancing of a person; sometimes upon obtaining\nexcellency in some art, or feat of the hand; as Nero\nfor playing on the harp, Domitian for certainty\nof the hand with the arrow, Commodus for playing at fence, Caracalla for driving chariots, and\nthe like.  This seemeth incredible, unto those that\nknow not the principle, that the mind of man, is\nmore cheered and refreshed by profiting in small\nthings, than by standing at a stay, in great.  We see\nalso that kings that have been fortunate conquerors, in their first years, it being not possible for\nthem to go forward infinitely, but that they must\nhave some check, or arrest in their fortunes, turn\nin their latter years to be superstitious, and melancholy; as did Alexander the Great; Diocletian; and\nin our memory, Charles the Fifth; and others: for\nhe that is used to go forward, and findeth a stop,\nfalleth out of his own favor, and is not the thing\nhe was.",
        "To speak now of the true temper of empire, it is\na thing rare and hard to keep; for both temper, and\ndistemper, consist of contraries.  But it is one thing,\nto mingle contraries, another to interchange them.\nThe answer of Apollonius to Vespasian, is full of\nexcellent instruction.  Vespasian asked him, What\nwas Nero’s overthrow? He answered, Nero could\ntouch and tune the harp well; but in government,\nsometimes he used to wind the pins too high, sometimes to let them down too low.  And certain it is,\nthat nothing destroyeth authority so much, as the\nunequal and untimely interchange of power\npressed too far, and relaxed too much.",
        "This is true, that the wisdom of all these latter\ntimes, in princes’ affairs, is rather fine deliveries,\nand shiftings of dangers and mischiefs, when they\nare near, than solid and grounded courses to keep\nthem aloof.  But this is but to try masteries with\nfortune.  And let men beware, how they neglect\nand suffer matter of trouble to be prepared; for no\nman can forbid the spark, nor tell whence it may\ncome.  The difficulties in princes’ business are many\nand great; but the greatest difficulty, is often in\ntheir own mind.  For it is common with princes\n(saith Tacitus) to will contradictories, Sunt plerumque regum voluntates vehementes, et inter se\ncontrariae.  For it is the solecism of power, to think\nto command the end, and yet not to endure the\nmean.",
        "Kings have to deal with their neighbors, their\nwives, their children, their prelates or clergy, their\nnobles, their second-nobles or gentlemen, their\nmerchants, their commons, and their men of war;\nand from all these arise dangers, if care and circumspection be not used.",
        "First for their neighbors; there can no general\nrule be given (for occasions are so variable), save\none, which ever holdeth, which is, that princes do\nkeep due sentinel, that none of their neighbors do\never grow so (by increase of territory, by embracing of trade, by approaches, or the like), as they\nbecome more able to annoy them, than they were.\nAnd this is generally the work of standing counsels, to foresee and to hinder it.  During that triumvirate of kings, King Henry the Eighth of England,\nFrancis the First King of France, and Charles the\nFifth Emperor, there was such a watch kept, that\nnone of the three could win a palm of ground, but\nthe other two would straightways balance it,\neither by confederation, or, if need were, by a war;\nand would not in any wise take up peace at interest.  And the like was done by that league (which\nGuicciardini saith was the security of Italy) made\nbetween Ferdinando King of Naples, Lorenzius\nMedici, and Ludovicus Sforza, potentates, the one\nof Florence, the other of Milan.  Neither is the opinion of some of the Schoolmen, to be received, that a\nwar cannot justly be made, but upon a precedent\ninjury or provocation.  For there is no question, but\na just fear of an imminent danger, though there be\nno blow given, is a lawful cause of a war.",
        "For their wives; there are cruel examples of\nthem.  Livia is infamed, for the poisoning of her\nhusband; Roxalana, Solyman’s wife, was the\ndestruction of that renowned prince, Sultan Mustapha, and otherwise troubled his house and succession; Edward the Second of England, his queen,\nhad the principal hand in the deposing and murder of her husband.  This kind of danger, is then to\nbe feared chiefly, when the wives have plots, for\nthe raising of their own children; or else that they\nbe advoutresses.",
        "For their children; the tragedies likewise of\ndangers from them, have been many.  And generally, the entering of fathers into suspicion of\ntheir children, hath been ever unfortunate.  The\ndestruction of Mustapha (that we named before)\nwas so fatal to Solyman’s line, as the succession of\nthe Turks, from Solyman until this day, is suspected to be untrue, and of strange blood; for that\nSelymus the Second, was thought to be suppositious.  The destruction of Crispus, a young prince of\nrare towardness, by Constantinus the Great, his\nfather, was in like manner fatal to his house; for\nboth Constantinus and Constance, his sons, died\nviolent deaths; and Constantius, his other son, did\nlittle better; who died indeed of sickness, but after\nthat Julianus had taken arms against him.  The destruction of Demetrius, son to Philip the Second of\nMacedon, turned upon the father, who died of\nrepentance.  And many like examples there are;\nbut few or none, where the fathers had good by\nsuch distrust; except it were, where the sons were\nup in open arms against them; as was Selymus the\nFirst against Bajazet; and the three sons of Henry\nthe Second, King of England.",
        "For their prelates; when they are proud and\ngreat, there is also danger from them; as it was in\nthe times of Anselmus, and Thomas Becket, Archbishops of Canterbury; who, with their croziers,\ndid almost try it with the king’s sword; and yet\nthey had to deal with stout and haughty kings,\nWilliam Rufus, Henry the First, and Henry the\nSecond.  The danger is not from that state, but\nwhere it hath a dependence of foreign authority;\nor where the churchmen come in and are elected,\nnot by the collation of the king, or particular\npatrons, but by the people.",
        "For their nobles; to keep them at a distance, it is\nnot amiss; but to depress them, may make a king\nmore absolute, but less safe; and less able to perform, any thing that he desires.  I have noted it, in\nmy History of King Henry the Seventh of England, who depressed bis nobility; whereupon it\ncame to pass, that his times were full of difficulties\nand troubles; for the nobility, though they continued loyal unto him, yet did they not co-operate\nwith him in his business.  So that in effect, he was\nfain to do all things himself.",
        "For their second-nobles; there is not much danger from them, being a body dispersed.  They may\nsometimes discourse high, but that doth little hurt;\nbesides, they are a counterpoise to the higher nobility, that they grow not too potent; and, lastly,\nbeing the most immediate in authority, with the\ncommon people, they do best temper popular commotions.",
        "For their merchants; they are vena porta; and\nif they flourish not, a kingdom may have good\nlimbs, but will have empty veins, and nourish\nlittle.  Taxes and imposts upon them, do seldom\ngood to the king’s revenue; for that that he wins in\nthe hundred, he leeseth in the shire; the particular\nrates being increased, but the total bulk of trading,\nrather decreased.",
        "For their commons; there is little danger from\nthem, except it be, where they have great and potent heads; or where you meddle with the point of\nreligion, or their customs, or means of life.",
        "For their men of war; it is a dangerous state,\nwhere they live and remain in a body, and are\nused to donatives; whereof we see examples in the\njanizaries, and pretorian bands of Rome; but trainings of men, and arming them in several places,\nand under several commanders, and without\ndonatives, are things of defence, and no danger.",
        "Princes are like to heavenly bodies, which cause\ngood or evil times; and which have much veneration, but no rest.  All precepts concerning kings,\nare in effect comprehended in those two remembrances: memento quod es homo; and memento\nquod es Deus, or vice Dei; the one bridleth their\npower, and the other their will.",
        "THE greatest trust, between man and man, is\nthe trust of giving counsel.  For in other confidences, men commit the parts of life; their lands,\ntheir goods, their children, their credit, some particular affair; but to such as they make their counsellors, they commit the whole: by how much the\nmore, they are obliged to all faith and integrity.\nThe wisest princes need not think it any diminution to their greatness, or derogation to their sufficiency, to rely upon counsel.  God himself is not\nwithout, but hath made it one of the great names\nof his blessed Son: The Counsellor.  Solomon hath\npronounced, that in counsel is stability.  Things\nwill have their first, or second agitation: if they be\nnot tossed upon the arguments of counsel, they\nwill be tossed upon the waves of fortune; and be\nfull of inconstancy, doing and undoing, like the\nreeling of a drunken man.  Solomon’s son found\nthe force of counsel, as his father saw the necessity\nof it.  For the beloved kingdom of God, was first\nrent, and broken, by ill counsel; upon which counsel, there are set for our instruction, the two marks\nwhereby bad counsel is for ever best discerned;\nthat it was young counsel, for the person; and\nviolent counsel, for the matter.",
        "The ancient times, do set forth in figure, both\nthe incorporation, and inseparable conjunction, of\ncounsel with kings, and the wise and politic use of\ncounsel by kings: the one, in that they say Jupiter did marry Metis, which signifieth counsel;\nwhereby they intend that Sovereignty, is married\nto Counsel: the other in that which followeth,\nwhich was thus: They say, after Jupiter was married to Metis, she conceived by him, and was with\nchild, but Jupiter suffered her not to stay, till she\nbrought forth, but eat her up; whereby he became\nhimself with child, and was delivered of Pallas\narmed, out of his head.  Which monstrous fable\ncontaineth a secret of empire; how kings are to\nmake use of their counsel of state.  That first, they\nought to refer matters unto them, which is the first\nbegetting, or impregnation; but when they are\nelaborate, moulded, and shaped in the womb of\ntheir counsel, and grow ripe, and ready to be\nbrought forth, that then they suffer not their counsel to go through with the resolution and direction, as if it depended on them; but take the matter\nback into their own hands, and make it appear to\nthe world, that the decrees and final directions\n(which, because they come forth, with prudence\nand power, are resembled to Pallas armed) proceeded from themselves; and not only from their\nauthority, but (the more to add reputation to themselves) from their head and device.",
        "Let us now speak of the inconveniences of counsel, and of the remedies.  The inconveniences that\nhave been noted, in calling and using counsel, are\nthree.  First, the revealing of affairs, whereby they\nbecome less secret.  Secondly, the weakening of the\nauthority of princes, as if they were less of themselves.  Thirdly, the danger of being unfaithfully\ncounselled, and more for the good of them that\ncounsel, than of him that is counselled.  For which\ninconveniences, the doctrine of Italy, and practice\nof France, in some kings’ times, hath introduced\ncabinet counsels; a remedy worse than the disease.",
        "As to secrecy; princes are not bound to communicate all matters, with all counsellors; but may\nextract and select.  Neither is it necessary, that he\nthat consulteth what he should do, should declare\nwhat he will do.  But let princes beware, that the\nunsecreting of their affairs, comes not from themselves.  And as for cabinet counsels, it may be their\nmotto, plenus rimarum sum: one futile person,\nthat maketh it his glory to tell, will do more hurt\nthan many, that know it their duty to conceal.  It is\ntrue there be some affairs, which require extreme\nsecrecy, which will hardly go beyond one or two\npersons, besides the king: neither are those counsels unprosperous; for, besides the secrecy, they\nconunonly go on constantly, in one spirit of direction, without distraction.  But then it must be a\nprudent king, such as is able to grind with a handmill; and those inward counsellors had need also\nbe wise men, and especially true and trusty to the\nking’s ends; as it was with King Henry the Seventh\nof England, who, in his great business, imparted\nhimself to none, except it were to Morton and Fox.",
        "For weakening of authority; the fable showeth\nthe remedy.  Nay, the majesty of kings, is rather\nexalted than diminished, when they are in the\nchair of counsel; neither was there ever prince, bereaved of his dependences, by his counsel, except\nwhere there hath been, either an over-greatness\nin one counsellor, or an over-strict combination in\ndivers; which are things soon found, and holpen.",
        "For the last inconvenience, that men will counsel, with an eye to themselves; certainly, non\ninveniet fidem super terram is meant, of the nature of times, and not of all particular persons.\nThere be, that are in nature faithful, and sincere,\nand plain, and direct; not crafty and involved; let\nprinces, above all, draw to themselves such natures.  Besides, counsellors are not commonly so\nunited, but that one counsellor, keepeth sentinel\nover another; so that if any do counsel out of faction or private ends, it commonly comes to the\nking’s ear.  But the best remedy is, if princes know\ntheir counsellors, as well as their counsellors\nknow them:",
        "Principis est virtus maxima nosse suos.",
        "And on the other side, counsellors should not be\ntoo speculative into their sovereign’s person.  The\ntrue composition of a counsellor, is rather to be\nskilful in their master’s business, than in his nature; for then he is like to advise him, and not feed\nhis humor.  It is of singular use to princes, if they\ntake the opinions of their counsel, both separately\nand together.  For private opinion is more free;\nbut opinion before others, is more reverent.  In\nprivate, men are more bold in their own humors;\nand in consort, men are more obnoxious to others’\nhumors; therefore it is good to take both; and of\nthe inferior sort, rather in private, to preserve freedom; of the greater, rather in consort, to preserve\nrespect.  It is in vain for princes, to take counsel\nconcerning matters, if they take no counsel likewise concerning persons; for all matters are as\ndead images; and the life of the execution of affairs, resteth in the good choice of persons.  Neither\nis it enough, to consult concerning persons secundum genera, as in an idea, or mathematical description, what the kind and character of the\nperson should be; for the greatest errors are committed, and the most judgment is shown, in the\nchoice of individuals.  It was truly said, optimi consiliarii mortui: books will speak plain, when counsellors blanch.Therefore it is good to be conversant\nin them, specially the books of such as themselves\nhave been actors upon the stage.",
        "The counsels at this day, in most places, are but\nfamiliar meetings, where matters are rather talked\non, than debated.  And they run too swift, to the\norder, or act, of counsel.  It were better that in\ncauses of weight, the matter were propounded one\nday, and not spoken to till the next day; in nocte\nconsilium.  So was it done in the Commission of\nUnion, between England and Scotland; which\nwas a grave and orderly assembly.  I commend set\ndays for petitions; for both it gives the sudtors more\ncertainty for their attendance, and it frees the\nmeetings for matters of estate, that they may hoc\nagere.  In choice of committees; for ripening business for the counsel, it is better to choose indifferent\npersons, than to make an indifferency, by putting\nin those, that are strong on both sides.  I commend\nalso standing commissions; as for trade, for treasure, for war, for suits, for some provinces; for\nwhere there be divers particular counsels, and but\none counsel of estate (as it is in Spain), they are, in\neffect, no more than standing commissions: save\nthat they have greater authority.  Let such as are\nto inform counsels, out of their particular professions (as lawyers, seamen, mintmen, and the like)\nbe first heard before committees; and then, as occasion serves, before the counsel.  And let them not\ncome in multitudes, or in a tribunitious manner;\nfor that is to clamor counsels, not to inform them.\nA long table and a square table, or seats about the\nwalls, seem things of form, but are things of substance; for at a long table a few at the upper end, in\neffect, sway all the business; but in the other form,\nthere is more use of the counsellors’ opinions, that\nsit lower.  A king, when he presides in counsel, let\nhim beware how he opens his own inclination too\nmuch, in that which he propoundeth; for else\ncounsellors will but take the wind of him, and instead of giving free counsel, sing him a song of\nplacebo.",
        "FORTUNE is like the market; where many\ntimes if you can stay a little, the price will fall.\nAgain, it is sometimes like Sibylla’s offer; which at\nfirst, offereth the commodity at full, then consumeth part and part, and still holdeth up the\nprice.  For occasion (as it is in the common verse)\nturneth a bald noddle, after she hath presented her\nlocks in front, and no hold taken; or at least turneth\nthe handle of the bottle, first to be received, and\nafter the belly, which is hard to clasp.  There is\nsurely no greater wisdom, than well to time the\nbeginnings, and onsets, of things.  Dangers are no\nmore light, if they once seem light; and more dangers have deceived men, than forced them.  Nay,\nit were better, to meet some dangers half way,\nthough they come nothing near, than to keep too\nlong a watch upon their approaches; for if a man\nwatch too long, it is odds he will fall asleep.  On the\nother side, to be deceived with too long shadows\n(as some have been, when the moon was low, and\nshone on their enemies’ back), and so to shoot off\nbefore the time; or to teach dangers to come on, by\nover early buckling towards them; is another extreme.  The ripeness, or unripeness, of the occasion\n(as we said) must ever be well weighed; and generally it is good, to commit the beginnings of all\ngreat actions to Argus, with his hundred eyes, and\nthe ends to Briareus, with his hundred hands; first\nto watch, and then to speed.  For the helmet of\nPluto, which maketh the politic man go invisible,\nis secrecy in the counsel, and celerity in the execution.  For when things are once come to the execution, there is no secrecy, comparable to celerity;\nlike the motion of a bullet in the air, which flieth\nso swift, as it outruns the eye.",
        "WE TAKE cunning for a sinister or crooked\nwisdom.  And certainly there is a great difference, between a cunning man, and a wise man;\nnot only in point of honesty, but in point of ability.\nThere be, that can pack the cards, and yet cannot\nplay well; so there are some that are good in canvasses and factions, that are otherwise weak men.\nAgain, it is one thing to understand persons, and\nanother thing to understand matters; for many\nare perfect in men’s humors, that are not greatly\ncapable of the real part of business; which is the\nconstitution of one that hath studied men, more\nthan books.  Such men are fitter for practice, than\nfor counsel; and they are good, but in their own\nalley: turn them to new men, and they have lost\ntheir aim; so as the old rule, to know a fool from a\nwise man, Mitte ambos nudos ad ignotos, et videbis, doth scarce hold for them.  And because these\ncunning men, are like haberdashers of small\nwares, it is not amiss to set forth their shop.",
        "It is a point of cunning, to wait upon him with\nwhom you speak, with your eye; as the Jesuits give\nit in precept: for there be many wise men, that\nhave secret hearts, and transparent countenances.\nYet this would be done with a demure abasing of\nyour eye, sometimes, as the Jesuits also do use.",
        "Another is, that when you have anything to\nobtain, of present despatch, you entertain and\namuse the party, with whom you deal, with some\nother discourse; that he be not too much awake to\nmake objections.  I knew a counsellor and secretary, that never came to Queen Elizabeth of England, with bills to sign, but he would always first\nput her into some discourse of estate, that she\nmought the less mind the bills.",

As Nehemias did; And I had not before\nthat time, been sad before the king.",

        "It is a point of cunning, to let fall those words in\na man’s own name, which he would have another\nman learn, and use, and thereupon take advantage.  I knew two, that were competitors for the\nsecretary’s place in Queen Elizabeth’s time, and\nyet kept good quarter between themselves; and\nwould confer, one with another, upon the business; and the one of them said, That to be a secretary, in the declination of a monarchy, was a\nticklish thing, and that he did not affect it: the\nother straight caught up those words, and discoursed with divers of his friends, that he had no\nreason to desire to be secretary, in the declination\nof a monarchy.  The first man took hold of it, and\nfound means it was told the Queen; who, hearing\nof a declination of a monarchy, took it so ill, as she\nwould never after hear of the other’s suit.",
        "There is a cunning, which we in England call,\nthe turning of the cat in the pan; which is, when\nthat which a man says to another, he lays it as if\nanother had said it to him.

And yet commonly they take advantage\nof their inability, and would be thought wits of\ndirection.  Some build rather upon the abusing of\nothers, and (as we now say) putting tricks upon\nthem, than upon soundness of their own proceedings.  But Solomon saith, Prudens advertit ad gressus suos; stultus divertit ad dolos.",
        "AN ANT is a wise creature for itself, but it is a\n shrewd thing, in an orchard or garden.  And\ncertainly, men that are great lovers of themselves,\nwaste the public.  Divide with reason; between selflove and society; and be so true to thyself, as thou\nbe not false to others; specially to thy king and\ncountry.  It is a poor centre of a man’s actions, himself.  It is right earth.  For that only stands fast upon\nhis own centre; whereas all things, that have affinity with the heavens, move upon the centre of\nanother, which they benefit.  The referring of all\nto a man’s self, is more tolerable in a sovereign\nprince; because themselves are not only themselves, but their good and evil is at the peril of the\npublic fortune.  But it is a desperate evil, in a servant to a prince, or a citizen in a republic.  For\nwhatsoever affairs pass such a man’s hands, he\ncrooketh them to his own ends; which must needs\nbe often eccentric to the ends of his master, or state.\nTherefore, let princes, or states, choose such servants, as have not this mark; except they mean\ntheir service should be made but the accessory.\nThat which maketh the effect more pernicious, is\nthat all proportion is lost.  It were disproportion\nenough, for the servant’s good to be preferred before the master’s; but yet it is a greater extreme,\nwhen a little good of the servant, shall carry things\nagainst a great good of the master’s.  And yet that\nis the case of bad officers, treasurers, ambassadors,\ngenerals, and other false and corrupt servants;\nwhich set a bias upon their bowl, of their own\npetty ends and envies, to the overthrow of their\nmaster’s great and important affairs.  And for the\nmost part, the good such servants receive, is after\nthe model of their own fortune; but the hurt they\nsell for that good, is after the model of their\nmaster’s fortune.  And certainly it is the nature of\nextreme self-lovers, as they will set an house on fire,\nand it were but to roast their eggs; and yet these\nmen many times hold credit with their masters,\nbecause their study is but to please them, and profit\nthemselves; and for either respect, they will abandon the good of their affairs.",
        "Wisdom for a man’s self is, in many branches\nthereof, a depraved thing.  It is the wisdom of rats,\nthat will be sure to leave a house, somewhat before\nit fall.  It is the wisdom of the fox, that thrusts out\nthe badger, who digged and made room for him.\nIt is the wisdom of crocodiles, that shed tears when\nthey would devour.  But that which is specially to\nbe noted is, that those which (as Cicero says of\nPompey) are sui amantes, sine rivali, are many\ntimes unfortunate.  And whereas they have, all\ntheir times, sacrificed to themselves, they become\nin the end, themselves sacrifices to the inconstancy\nof fortune, whose wings they thought, by their\nself-wisdom, to have pinioned.",
        "AS THE births of living creatures, at first are illshapen, so are all innovations, which are the\nbirths of time.  Yet notwithstanding, as those that\nfirst bring honor into their family, are commonly\nmore worthy than most that succeed, so the first\nprecedent (if it be good) is seldom attained by\nimitation.  For ill, to man’s nature, as it stands\nperverted, hath a natural motion, strongest in continuance; but good, as a forced motion, strongest\nat first.  Surely every medicine is an innovation;\nand he that will not apply new remedies, must\nexpect new evils; for time is the greatest innovator;\nand if time of course alter things to the worse, and\nwisdom and counsel shall not alter them to the\nbetter, what shall be the end? It is true, that what\nis settled by custom, though it be not good, yet at\nleast it is fit; and those things which have long\ngone together, are, as it were, confederate within\nthemselves; whereas new things piece not so well;\nbut though they help by their utility, yet they\ntrouble by their inconformity.  Besides, they are\nlike strangers; more admired, and less favored.  All\nthis is true, if time stood still; which contrariwise\nmoveth so round, that a froward retention of custom, is as turbulent a thing as an innovation; and\nthey that reverence too much old times, are but a\nscorn to the new.  It were good, therefore, that men\nin their innovations would follow the example of\ntime itself; which indeed innovateth greatly, but\nquietly, by degrees scarce to be perceived.  For\notherwise, whatsoever is new is unlooked for; and\never it mends some, and pairs others; and he that\nis holpen, takes it for a fortune, and thanks the\ntime; and he that is hurt, for a wrong, and imputeth it to the author.  It is good also, not to try experiments in states, except the necessity be urgent, or\nthe utility evident; and well to beware, that it be\nthe reformation, that draweth on the change, and\nnot the desire of change, that pretendeth the reformation.  And lastly, that the novelty, though it be\nnot rejected, yet be held for a suspect; and, as the\nScripture saith, that we make a stand upon the\nancient way, and then look about us, and discover\nwhat is the straight and right way, and so to walk\nin it.",
        "AFFECTED dispatch is one of the most dangerous things to business that can be.  It is like\nthat, which the physicians call predigestion, or\nhasty digestion; which is sure to fill the body full of\ncrudities, and secret seeds of diseases.  Therefore\nmeasure not dispatch, by the times of sitting, but\nby the advancement of the business.  And as in\nraces it is not the large stride or high lift that makes\nthe speed; so in business, the keeping close to the\nmatter, and not taking of it too much at once, procureth dispatch.  It is the care of some, only to come\noff speedily for the time; or to contrive some false\nperiods of business, because they may seem men\nof dispatch.  But it is one thing, to abbreviate by\ncontracting, another by cutting off . And business\nso handled, at several sittings or meetings, goeth\ncommonly backward and forward in an unsteady\nmanner.  I knew a wise man that had it for a byword, when he saw men hasten to a conclusion,\nStay a little, that we may  make  an  end  the  sooner.",
        "On the other side, true dispatch is a rich thing.\nFor time is the measure of business, as money is\nof wares; and business is bought at a dear hand,\nwhere there is small dispatch.  The Spartans and\nSpaniards have been noted to be of small dispatch;\nMi venga la muerte de Spagna; Let my death come\nfrom Spain; for then it will be sure to be long in\ncoming.",
        "Give good hearing to those, that give the first\ninformation in business; and rather direct them\nin the beginning, than interrupt them in the continuance of their speeches; for he that is put out of\nhis own order, will go forward and backward, and\nbe more tedious, while he waits upon his memory,\nthan he could have been, if he had gone on in his\nown course.  But sometimes it is seen, that the\nmoderator is more troublesome, than the actor.",
        "Iterations are commonly loss of time.  But there\nis no such gain of time, as to iterate often the state\nof the question; for it chaseth away many a frivolous speech, as it is coming forth.  Long and curious\nspeeches, are as fit for dispatch, as a robe or mantle,\nwith a long train, is for race.  Prefaces and passages, and excusations, and other speeches of reference to the person, are great wastes of time; and\nthough they seem to proceed of modesty, they are\nbravery.  Yet beware of being too material, when\nthere is any impediment or obstruction in men’s\nwills; for pre-occupation of mind ever requireth\npreface of speech; like a fomentation to make the\nunguent enter.",
        "Above all things, order, and distribution, and\nsingling out of parts, is the life of dispatch; so as the\ndistribution be not too subtle: for he that doth not\ndivide, will never enter well into business; and he\nthat divideth too much, will never come out of it\nclearly.  To choose time, is to save time; and an unseasonable motion, is but beating the air.  There be\nthree parts of business; the preparation, the debate\nor examination, and the perfection.  Whereof, if\nyou look for dispatch, let the middle only be the\nwork of many, and the first and last the work of\nfew.  The proceeding upon somewhat conceived in\nwriting, doth for the most part facilitate dispatch:\nfor though it should be wholly rejected, yet that\nnegative is more pregnant of direction, than an\nindefinite; as ashes are more generative than dust.",
        "\nOf Seeming Wise",
        "IT HATH been an opinion, that the French are\nwiser than they seem, and the Spaniards seem\nwiser than they are.  But howsoever it be between\nnations, certainly it is so between man and man.\nFor as the Apostle saith of godliness, Having a\nshow of godliness, but denying the power thereof;\nso certainly there are, in point of wisdom and sufficiently, that do nothing or little very solemnly:\nmagno conatu nugas.  It is a ridiculous thing, and\nfit for a satire to persons of judgment, to see what\nshifts these formalists have, and what prospectives\nto make superficies to seem body, that hath depth\nand bulk.  Some are so close and reserved, as they\nwill not show their wares, but by a dark light; and\nseem always to keep back somewhat; and when\nthey know within themselves, they speak of that\nthey do not well know, would nevertheless seem\nto others, to know of that which they may not well\nspeak.  Some help themselves with countenance\nand gesture, and are wise by signs; as Cicero saith\nof Piso, that when he answered him, he fetched\none of his brows up to his forehead, and bent the\nother down to his chin; Respondes, altero ad frontem sublato,    altero ad mentum depresso supercilio, crudelitatem tibi non placere.  Some think\nto bear it by speaking a great word, and being peremptory; and go on, and take by admittance, that\nwhich they cannot make good.  Some, whatsoever\nis beyond their reach, will seem to despise, or make\nlight of it, as impertinent or curious; and so would\nhave their ignorance seem judgment.  Some are\nnever without a difference, and commonly by\namusing men with a subtilty, blanch the matter;\nof whom A. Gellius saith, Hominem delirum, qui\nverborum minutiis rerum  frangit pondera.  Of\nwhich kind also, Plato, in his Protagoras, bringeth\nin Prodius in scorn, and maketh him make a\nspeech, that consisteth of distinction from the beginning to the end.  Generally, such men in all\ndeliberations find ease to be of the negative side,\nand affect a credit to object and foretell difficulties; for when propositions are denied, there is an\nend of them; but if they be allowed, it requireth a\nnew work; which false point of wisdom is the bane\nof business.  To conclude, there is no decaying merchant, or inward beggar, hath so many tricks to\nuphold the credit of their wealth, as these empty\npersons have, to maintain the credit of their sufficiency.  Seeming wise men may make shift to get\nopinion; but let no man choose them for employment; for certainly you were better take for business, a man somewhat absurd, than over-formal.",
        "IT HAD been hard for him that spake it to have\nput more truth and untruth together in few\nwords, than in that speech, Whatsoever is delighted\nin solitude, is either a wild beast or a god.  For it is\nmost true, that a natural and secret hatred, and\naversation towards society, in any man, hath\nsomewhat of the savage beast; but it is most untrue, that it should have any character at all, of the\ndivine nature; except it proceed, not out of a pleasure in solitude, but out of a love and desire to\nsequester a man’s self, for a higher conversation:\nsuch as is found to have been falsely and feignedly\nin some of the heathen; as Epimenides the Candian, Numa the Roman, Empedocles the Sicilian,\nand Apollonius of Tyana; and truly and really, in\ndivers of the ancient hermits and holy fathers of\nthe church.  But little do men perceive what solitude is, and how far it extendeth.  For a crowd is\nnot company; and faces are but a gallery of pictures; and talk but a tinkling cymbal, where\nthere is no love.  The Latin adage meeteth with it a\nlittle: Magna civitas, magna solitudo; because in\na great town friends are scattered; so that there is\nnot that fellowship, for the most part, which is in\nless neighborhoods.  But we may go further, and\naffirm most truly, that it is a mere and miserable\nsolitude to want true friends; without which the\nworld is but a wilderness; and even in this sense\nalso of solitude, whosoever in the frame of his\nnature and affections, is unfit for friendship, he\ntaketh it of the beast, and not from humanity.",
        "A principal fruit of friendship, is the ease and\ndischarge of the fulness and swellings of the heart,\nwhich passions of all kinds do cause and induce.\nWe know diseases of stoppings, and suffocations,\nare the most dangerous in the body; and it is not\nmuch otherwise in the mind; you may take sarza\nto open the liver, steel to open the spleen, flowers\nof sulphur for the lungs, castoreum for the brain;\nbut no receipt openeth the heart, but a true friend;\nto whom you may impart griefs, joys, fears, hopes,\nsuspicions, counsels, and whatsoever lieth upon\nthe heart to oppress it, in a kind of civil shrift or\nconfession.",
        "It is a strange thing to observe, how high a rate\ngreat kings and monarchs do set upon this fruit of\nfriendship, whereof we speak: so great, as they\npurchase it, many times, at the hazard of their\nown safety and greatness.  For princes, in regard\nof the distance of their fortune from that of their\nsubjects and servants, cannot gather this fruit, except (to make themselves capable thereof) they\nraise some persons to be, as it were, companions\nand almost equals to themselves, which many\ntimes sorteth to inconvenience.  The modern languages give unto such persons the name of favorites, or privadoes; as if it were matter of grace, or\nconversation.  But the Roman name attaineth the\ntrue use and cause thereof, naming them participes curarum; for it is that which tieth the knot.\nAnd we see plainly that this hath been done, not\nby weak and passionate princes only, but by the\nwisest and most politic that ever reigned; who\nhave oftentimes joined to themselves some of\ntheir servants; whom both themselves have called\nfriends, and allowed other likewise to call them in\nthe same manner; using the word which is received between private men.",
        "L. Sylla, when he commanded Rome, raised\nPompey (after surnamed the Great) to that height,\nthat Pompey vaunted himself for Sylla’s overmatch.  For when he had carried the consulship for\na friend of his, against the pursuit of Sylla, and\nthat Sylla did a little resent thereat, and began to\nspeak great, Pompey turned upon him again, and\nin effect bade him be quiet; for that more men\nadored the sun rising, than the sun setting.  With\nJulius Caesar, Decimus Brutus had obtained that\ninterest as he set him down in his testament, for\nheir in remainder, after his nephew.  And this was\nthe man that had power with him, to draw him\nforth to his death.  For when Caesar would have\ndischarged the senate, in regard of some ill presages, and specially a dream of Calpurnia; this\nman lifted him gently by the arm out of his chair,\ntelling him he hoped he would not dismiss the\nsenate, till his wife had dreamt a better dream.\nAnd it seemeth his favor was so great, as Antonius,\nin a letter which is recited verbatim in one of\nCicero’s Philippics, calleth him venefica, witch;\nas if he had enchanted Caesar.  Augustus raised\nAgrippa (though of mean birth) to that height, as\nwhen he consulted with Maecenas, about the marriage of his daughter Julia, Maecenas took the\nliberty to tell him, that he must either marry his\ndaughter to Agrippa, or take away his life; there\nwas no third way, he had made him so great.  With\nTiberius Caesar, Sejanus had ascended to that\nheight, as they two were termed, and reckoned, as\na pair of friends.  Tiberius in a letter to him saith,\nHaec pro amicitia nostra non occultavi; and the\nwhole senate dedicated an altar to Friendship, as\nto a goddess, in respect of the great dearness of\nfriendship, between them two.  The like, or more,\nwas between Septimius Severus and Plautianus.\nFor he forced his eldest son to marry the daughter\nof Plautianus; and would often maintain Plautianus, in doing affronts to his son; and did write\nalso in a letter to the senate, by these words: I love\nthe man so well, as I wish he may over-live me.\nNow if these princes had been as a Trajan, or a\nMarcus Aurelius, a man might have thought that\nthis had proceeded of an abundant goodness of\nnature; but being men so wise, of such strength\nand severity of mind, and so extreme lovers of\nthemselves, as all these were, it proveth most\nplainly that they found their own felicity (though\nas great as ever happened to mortal men) but as\nan half piece, except they mought have a friend,\nto make it entire; and yet, which is more, they\nwere princes that had wives, sons, nephews; and\nyet all these could not supply the comfort of friendship.",
        "It is not to be forgotten, what Comineus observeth of his first master, Duke Charles the Hardy,\nnamely, that he would communicate his secrets\nwith none; and least of all, those secrets which\ntroubled him most.  Whereupon he goeth on, and\nsaith that towards his latter time, that closeness\ndid impair, and a little perish his understanding.\nSurely Comineus mought have made the same\njudgment also, if it had pleased him, of his second\nmaster, Lewis the Eleventh, whose closeness was\nindeed his tormentor.  The parable of Pythagoras\nis dark, but true; Cor ne edito; Eat not the heart.\nCertainly, if a man would give it a hard phrase,\nthose that want friends, to open themselves unto,\nare carnnibals of their own hearts.  But one thing\nis most admirable (wherewith I will conclude this\nfirst fruit of friendship), which is, that this communicating of a man’s self to his friend, works\ntwo contrary effects; for it redoubleth joys, and\ncutteth griefs in halves.  For there is no man, that\nimparteth his joys to his friend, but he joyeth the\nmore; and no man that imparteth his griefs to his\nfriend, but he grieveth the less.  So that it is in truth,\nof operation upon a man’s mind, of like virtue as\nthe alchemists use to attribute to their stone, for\nman’s body; that it worketh all contrary effects,\nbut still to the good and benefit of nature.  But yet\nwithout praying in aid of alchemists, there is a\nmanifest image of this, in the ordinary course of\nnature.  For in bodies, union strengtheneth and\ncherisheth any natural action; and on the other\nside, weakeneth and dulleth any violent impression: and even so it is of minds.",
        "The second fruit of friendship, is healthful and\nsovereign for the understanding, as the first is for\nthe affections.  For friendship maketh indeed a fair\nday in the affections, from storm and tempests; but\nit maketh daylight in the understanding, out of\ndarkness, and confusion of thoughts.  Neither is\nthis to be understood only of faithful counsel,\nwhich a man receiveth from his friend; but before\nyou come to that, certain it is, that whosoever hath\nhis mind fraught with many thoughts, his wits\nand understanding do clarify and break up, in the\ncommunicating and discoursing with another; he\ntosseth his thoughts more easily; he marshalleth\nthem more orderly, he seeth how they look when\nthey are turned into words: finally, he waxeth\nwiser than himself; and that more by an hour’s\ndiscourse, than by a day’s meditation.  It was well\nsaid by Themistocles, to the king of Persia, That\nspeech was like cloth of Arras, opened and put\nabroad; whereby the imagery doth appear in\nfigure; whereas in thoughts they lie but as in\npacks.  Neither is this second fruit of friendship, in\nopening the understanding, restrained only to\nsuch friends as are able to give a man counsel;\n(they indeed are best;) but even without that, a\nman learneth of himself, and bringeth his own\nthoughts  to light, and whetteth his wits as against\na stone, which itself cuts not.  In a word, a man\nwere better relate himself to a statua, or picture,\nthan to suffer his thoughts to pass in smother.",
        "Add now, to make this second fruit of friendship\ncomplete, that other point, which lieth more open,\nand falleth within vulgar observation; which is\nfaithful counsel from a friend.  Heraclitus saith\nwell in one of his enigmas, Dry light is ever the\nbest.  And certain it is, that the light that a man\nreceiveth by counsel from another, is drier and\npurer, than that which cometh from his own\nunderstanding and judgment; which is ever infused, and drenched, in his affections and customs.\nSo as there is as much difference between the counsel, that a friend giveth, and that a man giveth\nhimself, as there is between the counsel of a friend,\nand of a flatterer.  For there is no such flatterer as\nis a man’s self; and there is no such remedy against\nflattery of a man’s self, as the liberty of a friend.\nCounsel is of two sorts: the one concerning manners, the other concerning business.  For the first,\nthe best preservative to keep the mind in health, is\nthe faithful admonition of a friend.  The calling of\na man’s self to a strict account, is a medicine, sometime too piercing and corrosive.  Reading good\nbooks of morality, is a little flat and dead.  Observing our faults in others, is sometimes improper for\nour case.  But the best receipt (best, I say, to work,\nand best to take) is the admonition of a friend.\nIt is a strange thing to behold, what gross errors\nand extreme absurdities many (especially of the\ngreater sort) do commit, for want of a friend to tell\nthem of them; to the great damage both of their\nfame and fortune: for, as St. James saith, they are\nas men that look sometimes into a glass, and presently forget their own shape and favor.  As for\nbusiness, a man may think, if he win, that two\neyes see no more than one; or that a gamester seeth\nalways more than a looker-on; or that a man in\nanger, is as wise as he that hath said over the four\nand twenty letters; or that a musket may be shot\noff as well upon the arm, as upon a rest; and such\nother fond and high imaginations, to think himself all in all.  But when all is done, the help of good\ncounsel, is that which setteth business straight.\nAnd if any man think that he will take counsel,\nbut it shall be by pieces; asking counsel in one\nbusiness, of one man, and in another business, of\nanother man; it is well (that is to say, better, perhaps, than if he asked none at all); but he runneth\ntwo dangers: one, that he shall not be faithfully\ncounselled; for it is a rare thing, except it be from\na perfect and entire friend, to have counsel given,\nbut such as shall be bowed and crooked to some\nends, which he hath, that giveth it.  The other, that\nhe shall have counsel given, hurtful and unsafe\n(though with good meaning), and mixed partly of\nmischief and partly of remedy; even as if you\nwould call a physician, that is thought good for\nthe cure of the disease you complain of, but is unacquainted with your body; and therefore may put\nyou in way for a present cure, but overthroweth\nyour health in some other kind; and so cure the\ndisease, and kill the patient.  But a friend that is\nwholly acquainted with a man’s estate, will beware, by furthering any present business, how he\ndasheth upon other inconvenience.  And therefore\nrest not upon scattered counsels; they will rather\ndistract and mislead, than settle and direct.",
        "After these two noble fruits of friendship (peace\nin the affections, and support of the judgment),\nfolloweth the last fruit; which is like the pomegranate, full of many kernels; I mean aid, and\nbearing a part, in all actions and occasions.  Here\nthe best way to represent to life the manifold use\nof friendship, is to cast and see how many things\nthere are, which a man cannot do himself; and\nthen it will appear, that it was a sparing speech of\nthe ancients, to say, that a friend is another himself; for that a friend is far more than himself.\nMen have their time, and die many times, in desire of some things which they principally take to\nheart; the bestowing of a child, the finishing of a\nwork, or the like.  If a man have a true friend, he\nmay rest almost secure that the care of those things\nwill continue after him.  So that a man hath, as it\nwere, two lives in his desires.  A man hath a body,\nand that body is confined to a place; but where\nfriendship is, all offices of life are as it were granted\nto him, and his deputy.  For he may exercise them\nby his friend.  How many things are there which\na man cannot, with any face or comeliness, say or\ndo himself?  A man can scarce allege his own\nmerits with modesty, much less extol them; a man\ncannot sometimes brook to supplicate or beg; and\na number of the like.  But all these things are graceful, in a friend’s mouth, which are blushing in a\nman’s own.  So again, a man’s person hath many\nproper relations, which he cannot put off.  A man\ncannot speak to his son but as a father; to his wife\nbut as a husband; to his enemy but upon terms:\nwhereas a friend may speak as the case requires,\nand not as it sorteth with the person.  But to enumerate these things were endless; I have given the\nrule, where a man cannot fitly play his own part;\nif he have not a friend, he may quit the stage.",
        "RICHES are for spending, and spending for\nhonor and good actions.  Therefore extraordinary expense must be limited by the worth of\nthe occasion; for voluntary undoing, may be as\nwell for a man’s country, as for the kingdom of\nheaven.  But ordinary expense, ought to be limited\nby a man’s estate; and governed with such regard,\nas it be within his compass; and not subject to deceit and abuse of servants; and ordered to the best\nshow, that the bills may be less than the estimation abroad.  Certainly, if a man will keep but of\neven hand, his ordinary expenses ought to be but\nto the half of his receipts; and if he think to wax\nrich, but to the third part.  It is no baseness, for the\ngreatest to descend and look into their own estate.\nSome forbear it, not upon negligence alone, but\ndoubting to bring themselves into melancholy, in\nrespect they shall find it broken.  But wounds cannot be cured without searching.  He that cannot\nlook into his own estate at all, had need both choose\nwell those whom he employeth, and change them\noften; for new are more timorous and less subtle.\nHe that can look into his estate but seldom, it behooveth him to turn all to certainties.  A man had\nneed, if he be plentiful in some kind of expense, to\nbe as saving again in some other.  As if he be plentiful in diet, to be saving in apparel; if he be plentiful in the hall, to be saving in the stable; and the\nlike.  For he that is plentiful in expenses of all kinds,\nwill hardly be preserved from decay.  In clearing\nof a man’s estate, he may as well hurt himself in\nbeing too sudden, as in letting it run on too long.\nFor hasty selling, is commonly as disadvantageable as interest.  Besides, he that clears at once will\nrelapse; for finding himself out of straits, he will\nrevert to his custom: but he that cleareth by degrees, induceth a habit of frugality, and gaineth\nas well upon his mind, as upon his estate.  Certainly, who hath a state to repair, may not despise\nsmall things; and commonly it is less dishonorable, to abridge petty charges, than to stoop to\npetty gettings.  A man ought warily to begin\ncharges which once begun will continue; but in\nmatters that return not, he may be more magnificent.",
        "THE speech of Themistocles the Athenian,\nwhich was haughty and arrogant, in taking\nso much to himself, had been a grave and wise\nobservation and censure, applied at large to others.\nDesired at a feast to touch a lute, he said, He could\nnot fiddle, but yet he could make a small town, a\ngreat city.  These words (holpen a little with a\nmetaphor) may express two differing abilities, in\nthose that deal in business of estate.  For if a true\nsurvey be taken of counsellors and statesmen,\nthere may be found (though rarely) those which\ncan make a small state great, and yet cannot fiddle; as on the other side, there will be found a great\nmany, that can fiddle very cunningly, but yet are\nso far from being able to make a small state great,\nas their gift lieth the other way; to bring a great\nand flourishing estate, to ruin and decay.  And certainly whose degenerate arts and shifts, whereby\nmany counsellors and governors gain both favor\nwith their masters, and estimation with the vulgar,\ndeserve no better name than fiddling; being things\nrather pleasing for the time, and graceful to themselves only, than tending to the weal and advancement of the state which they serve.  There are also\n(no doubt) counsellors and governors which may\nbe held sufficient (negotiis pares), able to manage\naffairs, and to keep them from precipices and\nmanifest inconveniences; which nevertheless are\nfar from the ability to raise and amplify an estate\nin power, means, and fortune.  But be the workmen\nwhat they may be, let us speak of the work; that\nis, the true greatness of kingdoms and estates, and\nthe means thereof.  An argument fit for great and\nmighty princes to have in their hand; to the end\nthat neither by over-measuring their forces, they\nleese themselves in vain enterprises; nor on the\nother side, by undervaluing them, they descend to\nfearful and pusillanimous counsels.",
        "The greatness of an estate, in bulk and territory,\ndoth fall under measure; and the greatness of\nfinances and revenue, doth fall under computation.  The population may appear by musters; and\nthe number and greatness of cities and towns by\ncards and maps.  But yet there is not any thing\namongst civil affairs more subject to error, than\nthe right valuation and true judgment concerning\nthe power and forces of an estate.  The kingdom of\nheaven is compared, not to any great kernel or nut,\nbut to a grain of mustard-seed: which is one of the\nleast grains, but hath in it a property and spirit\nhastily to get up and spread.  So are there states,\ngreat in territory, and yet not apt to enlarge or\ncommand; and some that have but a small dimension of stem, and yet apt to be the foundations of\ngreat monarchies.",
        "Walled towns, stored arsenals and armories,\ngoodly races of horse, chariots of war, elephants,\nordnance, artillery, and the like; all this is but a\nsheep in a lion’s skin, except the breed and disposition of the people, be stout and warlike.  Nay, number (itself) in armies importeth not much, where\nthe people is of weak courage; for (as Virgil saith)\nIt never troubles a wolf, how many the sheep be.\nThe army of the Persians, in the plains of Arbela,\nwas such a vast sea of people, as it did somewhat\nastonish the commanders in Alexander’s army;\nwho came to him therefore, and wished him to set\nupon them by night; and he answered, He would\nnot pilfer the victory.  And the defeat was easy.\nWhen Tigranes the Armenian, being encamped\nupon a hill with four hundred thousand men, discovered the army of the Romans, being not above\nfourteen thousand, marching towards him, he\nmade himself merry with it, and said, Yonder men\nare too many for an embassage, and too few for a\nfight.  But before the sun set, he found them enow\nto give him the chase with infinite slaughter.\nMany are the examples of the great odds, between\nnumber and courage; so that a man may truly\nmake a judgment, that the principal point of greatness in any state, is to have a race of military men.\nNeither is money the sinews of war (as it is trivially\nsaid), where the sinews of men’s arms, in base and\neffeminate people, are failing.  For Solon said well\nto Croesus (when in ostentation he showed him his\ngold), Sir, if any other come, that hath better iron,\nthan you, he will be master of all this gold.  Therefore let any prince or state think solely of his forces,\nexcept his militia of natives be of good and valiant\nsoldiers.  And let princes, on the other side, that\nhave subjects of martial disposition, know their\nown strength; unless they be otherwise wanting\nunto themselves.  As for mercenary forces (which\nis the help in this case), all examples show, that\nwhatsoever estate or prince doth rest upon them,\nhe may spread his feathers for a time, but he will\nmew them soon after.",
        "The blessing of Judah and Issachar will never\nmeet; that the same people, or nation, should be\nboth the lion’s whelp and the ass between burthens; neither will it be, that a people overlaid\nwith taxes, should ever become valiant and martial.  It is true that taxes levied by consent of the\nestate, do abate men’s courage less: as it hath been\nseen notably, in the excises of the Low Countries;\nand, in some degree, in the subsidies of England.\nFor you must note, that we speak now of the heart,\nand not of the purse.  So that although the same\ntribute and tax, laid by consent or by imposing, be\nall one to the purse, yet it works diversely upon the\ncourage.  So that you may conclude, that no people\novercharged with tribute, is fit for empire.",
        "Let states that aim at greatness, take heed how\ntheir nobility and gentlemen do multiply too fast.\nFor that maketh the common subject, grow to be a\npeasant and base swain, driven out of heart, and in\neffect but the gentleman’s laborer.  Even as you\nmay see in coppice woods; if you leave your staddles too thick, you shall never have clean underwood, but shrubs and bushes.  So in countries,  if the\ngentlemen be too many, the commons will be base;\nand you will bring it to that, that not the hundred\npoll, will be fit for an helmet; especially as to the\ninfantry, which is the nerve of an army; and so\nthere will be great population, and little strength.\nThis which I speak of, hath been nowhere better\nseen, than by comparing of England and France;\nwhereof England, though far less in territory and\npopulation, hath been (nevertheless) an overmatch; in regard the middle people of England\nmake good soldiers, which the peasants of France\ndo not.  And herein the device of king Henry the\nSeventh (whereof I have spoken largely in the\nHistory of his Life) was profound and admirable;\nin making farms and houses of husbandry of a\nstandard; that is, maintained with such a proportion of land unto them, as may breed a subject to\nlive in convenient plenty and no servile condition;\nand to keep the plough in the hands of the owners,\nand not mere hirelings.  And thus indeed you shall\nattain to Virgil’s character which he gives to ancient Italy:",

        "Neither is that state (which, for any thing I know,\nis almost peculiar to England, and hardly to be\nfound anywhere else, except it be perhaps in\nPoland) to be passed over; I mean the state of free\nservants, and attendants upon noblemen and\ngentlemen; which are no ways inferior unto the\nyeomanry for arms.  And therefore out of all questions, the splendor and magnificence, and great\nretinues and hospitality, of noblemen and gentlemen, received into custom, doth much conduce\nunto martial greatness.  Whereas, contrariwise, the\nclose and reserved living of noblemen and gentlemen, causeth a penury of military forces.",
        "By all means it is to be procured, that the trunk\nof Nebuchadnezzar’s tree of monarchy, be great\nenough to bear the branches and the boughs; that\nis, that the natural subjects of the crown or state,\nbear a sufficient proportion to the stranger subjects, that they govern.Therefore all states that are\nliberal of naturalization towards strangers, are fit\nfor empire.  For to think that an handful of people\ncan, with the greatest courage and policy in the\nworld, embrace too large extent of dominion, it\nmay hold for a time, but it will fail suddenly.  The\nSpartans were a nice people in point of naturalization; whereby, while they kept their compass,\nthey stood firm; but when they did spread, and\ntheir boughs were becomen too great for their\nstem, they became a windfall, upon the sudden.\nNever any state was in this point so open to receive\nstrangers into their body, as were the Romans.\nTherefore it sorted with them accordingly; for\nthey grew to the greatest monarchy.  Their manner\nwas to grant naturalization (which they called jus\ncivitatis), and to grant it in the highest degree; that\nis, not only jus commercii, jus connubii, jus haereditatis; but also jus suffragii, and jus honorum.\nAnd this not to singular persons alone, but likewise\nto whole families; yea to cities, and sometimes to\nnations.  Add to this their custom of plantation of\ncolonies; whereby the Roman plant was removed\ninto the soil of other nations.  And putting both\nconstitutions together, you will say that it was not\nthe Romans that spread upon the world, but it was\nthe world that spread upon the Romans; and that\nwas the sure way of greatness.  I have marvelled,\nsometimes, at Spain, how they clasp and contain\nso large dominions, with so few natural Spaniards;\nbut sure the whole compass of Spain, is a very great\nbody of a tree; far above Rome and Sparta at the\nfirst.  And besides, though they have not had that\nusage, to naturalize liberally, yet they have that\nwhich is next to it; that is, to employ, almost indifferently, all nations in their militia of ordinary\nsoldiers; yea, and sometimes in their highest commands.  Nay, it seemeth at this instant they are\nsensible, of this want of natives; as by the Pragmatical Sanction, now published, appeareth.",
        "It is certain that sedentary, and within-door\narts, and delicate manufactures (that require\nrather the finger than the arm), have, in their nature, a contrariety to a military disposition.  And\ngenerally, all warlike people are a little idle, and\nlove danger better than travail.  Neither must they\nbe too much broken of it, if they shall be preserved\nin vigor.  Therefore it was great advantage, in the\nancient states of Sparta, Athens, Rome, and others,\nthat they had the use of slaves, which commonly\ndid rid those manufactures.  But that is abolished,\nin greatest part, by the Christian law.  That which\ncometh nearest to it, is to leave those arts chiefly to\nstrangers (which, for that purpose, are the more\neasily to be received), and to contain the principal\nbulk of the vulgar natives, within those three\nkinds, - tillers of the ground; free servants; and\nhandicraftsmen of strong and manly arts, as\nsmiths, masons, carpenters, etc.; not reckoning\nprofessed soldiers.",
        "But above all, for empire and greatness, it importeth most, that a nation do profess arms, as their\nprincipal honor, study, and occupation.  For the\nthings which we formerly have spoken of, are but\nhabilitations towards arms; and what is habilitation without intention and act? Romulus, after his\ndeath (as they report or feign), sent a present to the\nRomans, that above all, they should intend arms;\nand then they should prove the greatest empire of\nthe world.  The fabric of the state of Sparta was\nwholly (though not wisely) framed and composed,\nto that scope and end.  The Persians and Macedonians had it for a flash.  The Gauls, Germans,\nGoths, Saxons, Normans, and others, had it for a\ntime.  The Turks have it at this day, though in great\ndeclination.  Of Christian Europe, they that have it\nare, in effect, only the Spaniards.  But it is so\nplain, that every man profiteth in that, he most\nintendeth, that it needeth not to be stood upon.  It\nis enough to point at it; that no nation which doth\nnot directly profess arms, may look to have greatness fall into their mouths.  And on the other side,\nit is a most certain oracle of time, that those states\nthat continue long in that profession (as the Romans and Turks principally have done) do wonders.  And those that have professed arms but for\nan age, have, notwithstanding, commonly attained that greatness, in that age, which maintained them long after, when their profession and\nexercise of arms hath grown to decay.",
        "Incident to this point is, for a state to have those\nlaws or customs, which may reach forth unto them\njust occasions (as may be pretended) of war.  For\nthere is that justice, imprinted in the nature of\nmen, that they enter not upon wars (whereof so\nmany calamities do ensue) but upon some, at the\nleast specious, grounds and quarrels.  The Turk\nhath at hand, for cause of war, the propagation of\nhis law or sect; a quarrel that he may always command.  The Romans, though they esteemed the\nextending the limits of their empire, to be great\nhonor to their generals, when it was done, yet they\nnever rested upon that alone, to begin a war.  First,\ntherefore, let nations that pretend to greatness\nhave this; that they be sensible of wrongs, either\nupon borderers, merchants, or politic ministers;\nand that they sit not too long upon a provocation.\nSecondly, let them be prest, and ready to give aids\nand succors, to their confederates; as it ever was\nwith the Romans; insomuch, as if the confederate\nhad leagues defensive, with divers other states,\nand, upon invasion offered, did implore their aids\nseverally, yet the Romans would ever be the foremost, and leave it to none other to have the honor.\nAs for the wars which were anciently made, on\nthe behalf of a kind of party, or tacit conformity of\nestate, I do not see how they may be well justified:\nas when the Romans made a war, for the liberty of\nGrecia; or when the Lacedaemonians and Athenians, made wars to set up or pull down democracies and oligarchies; or when wars were made\nby foreigners, under the pretence of justice or protection, to deliver the subjects of others, from\ntyranny and oppression; and the like.  Let it suffice, that no estate expect to be great, that is not\nawake upon any just occasion of arming.",
        "No body can be healthful without exercise,\nneither natural body nor politic; and certainly to\na kingdom or estate, a just and honorable war, is\nthe true exercise.  A civil war, indeed, is like the\nheat of a fever; but a foreign war is like the heat of\nexercise, and serveth to keep the body in health;\nfor in a slothful peace, both courages will effeminate, and manners corrupt.  But howsoever it be\nfor happiness, without all question, for greatness,\nit maketh to be still for the most part in arms; and\nthe strength of a veteran army (though it be a\nchargeable business) always on foot, is that which\ncommonly giveth the law, or at least the reputation, amongst all neighbor states; as may well be\nseen in Spain, which hath had, in one part or other,\na veteran army almost continually, now by the\nspace of six score years.",
        "To be master of the sea, is an abridgment of a\nmonarchy.  Cicero, writing to Atticus of Pompey\nhis preparation against Caesar, saith, Consilium\nPompeii plane Themistocleum est; putat enim,\nqui mari potitur, eum rerum potiri.  And, without\ndoubt, Pompey had tired out Caesar, if upon vain\nconfidence, he had not left that way.  We see the\ngreat effects of battles bv sea.  The battle of Actium,\ndecided the empire of the world.  The battle of Lepanto, arrested the greatness of the Turk.  There be\nmany examples, where sea-fights have been final\nto the war; but this is when princes or states have\nset up their rest, upon the battles.  But thus much\nis certain, that he that commands the sea, is at\ngreat liberty, and may take as much, and as little,\nof the war as he will.  Whereas those that be strongest by land, are many times nevertheless in great\nstraits.  Surely, at this day, with us of Europe, the\nvantage of strength at sea (which is one of the principal dowries of this kingdom of Great Britain) is\ngreat; both because most of the kingdoms of Europe, are not merely inland, but girt with the sea\nmost part of their compass; and because the wealth\nof both Indies seems in great part, but an accessory\nto the command of the seas.",
        "The wars of latter ages seem to be made in the\ndark, in respect of the glory, and honor, which\nreflected upon men from the wars, in ancient time.\nThere be now, for martial encouragement, some\ndegrees and orders of chivalry; which nevertheless\nare conferred promiscuously, upon soldiers and\nno soldiers; and some remembrance perhaps, upon\nthe scutcheon; and some hospitals for maimed soldiers; and such like things.  But in ancient times,\nthe trophies erected upon the place of the victory;\nthe funeral laudatives and monuments for those\nthat died in the wars; the crowns and garlands personal; the style of emperor, which the great kings\nof the world after borrowed; the triumphs of the\ngenerals, upon their return; the great donatives\nand largesses, upon the disbanding of the armies;\nwere things able to inflame all men’s courages.\nBut above all, that of the triumph, amongst the\nRomans, was not pageants or gaudery, but one of\nthe wisest and noblest institutions, that ever was.\nFor it contained three things: honor to the general;\nriches to the treasury out of the spoils; and donatives to the army.  But that honor, perhaps were not\nfit for monarchies; except it be in the person of the\nmonarch himself, or his sons; as it came to pass in\nthe times of the Roman emperors, who did impropriate the actual triumphs to themselves, and their\nsons, for such wars as they did achieve in person;\nand left only, for wars achieved by subjects, some\ntriumphal garments and ensigns to the general.",
        "To conclude: no man can by care taking (as the\nScripture saith) add a cubit to his stature, in this\nlittle model of a man’s body; but in the great frame\nof kingdoms and commonwealths, it is in the\npower of princes or estates, to add amplitude and\ngreatness to their kingdoms; for by introducing\nsuch ordinances, constitutions, and customs, as we\nhave now touched, they may sow greatness to\ntheir posterity and succession.  But these things are\ncommonly not observed, but left to take their\nchance.",
        "THERE is a wisdom in this; beyond the rules of\nphysic: a man’s own observation, what he\nfinds good of, and what he finds hurt of, is the best\nphysic to preserve health.  But it is a safer conclusion to say, This agreeth not well with me, therefore, I will not continue it; than this, I find no\noffence of this, therefore I may use it.  For strength\nof nature in youth, passeth over many excesses,\nwhich are owing a man till his age.  Discern of the\ncoming on of years, and think not to do the same\nthings still; for age will not be defied.  Beware of\nsudden change, in any great point of diet, and, if\nnecessity enforce it, fit the rest to it.  For it is a secret\nboth in nature and state, that it is safer to change\nmany things, than one.  Examine thy customs of\ndiet, sleep, exercise, apparel, and the like; and try,\nin any thing thou shalt judge hurtful, to discontinue it, by little and little; but so, as if thou dost\nfind any inconvenience by the change, thou come\nback to it again: for it is hard to distinguish that\nwhich is generally held good and wholesome,\nfrom that which is good particularly, and fit for\nthine own body.  To be free-minded and cheerfully\ndisposed, at hours of meat, and of sleep, and of\nexercise, is one of the best precepts of long lasting.\nAs for the passions, and studies of the mind; avoid\nenvy, anxious fears; anger fretting inwards;\nsubtle and knotty inquisitions; joys and exhilarations in excess; sadness not communicated.  Entertain hopes; mirth rather than joy; variety of\ndelights, rather than surfeit of them; wonder and\nadmiration, and therefore novelties; studies that\nfill the mind with splendid and illustrious objects,\nas histories, fables, and contemplations of nature.\nIf you fly physic in health altogether, it will be too\nstrange for your body, when you shall need it.  If\nyou make it too familiar, it will work no extraordinary effect, when sickness cometh.  I commend\nrather some diet for certain seasons, than frequent\nuse of physic, except it be grown into a custom.  For\nthose diets alter the body more, and trouble it less.\nDespise no new accident in your body, but ask\nopinion of it.  In sickness, respect health principally; and in health, action.  For those that put\ntheir bodies to endure in health, may in most sicknesses, which are not very sharp, be cured only\nwith diet, and tendering.  Celsus could never have\nspoken it as a physician, had he not been a wise\nman withal, when he giveth it for one of the great\nprecepts of health and lasting, that a man do vary,\nand interchange contraries, but with an inclination to the more benign extreme: use fasting and\nfull eating, but rather full eating; watching and\nsleep, but rather sleep; sitting and exercise, but\nrather exercise; and the like.  So shall nature be\ncherished, and yet taught masteries.  Physicians\nare, some of them, so pleasing and conformable to\nthe humor of the patient, as they press not the true\ncure of the disease; and some other are so regular,\nin proceeding according to art for the disease, as\nthey respect not sufficiently the condition of the\npatient.  Take one of a middle temper; or if it may\nnot be found in one man, combine two of either\nsort; and forget not to call as well, the best acquainted with your body, as the best reputed of\nfor his faculty.",
        "SUSPICIONS amongst thoughts, are like bats\namongst birds, they ever fly by twilight.  Certainly they are to be repressed, or at least well\nguarded: for they cloud the mind; they leese\nfriends; and they check with business, whereby\nbusiness cannot go on currently and constantly.\nThey dispose kings to tyranny, husbands to jealousy, wise men to irresolution and melancholy.\nThey are defects, not in the heart, but in the brain;\nfor they take place in the stoutest natures; as in the\nexample of Henry the Seventh of England.  There\nwas not a more suspicious man, nor a more stout.\nAnd in such a composition they do small hurt.  For\ncommonly they are not admitted, but with examination, whether they be likely or no.  But in fearful\nnatures they gain ground too fast.  There is nothing\nmakes a man suspect much, more than to know\nlittle; and therefore men should remedy suspicion,\nby procuring to know more, and not to keep their\nsuspicions in smother.  What would men have? Do\nthey think, those they  employ and deal with, are\nsaints? Do they not think, they will have their own\nends, and be truer to themselves, than to them?\nTherefore there is no better way, to moderate suspicions, than to account upon such suspicions as\ntrue, and yet to bridle them as false.  For so far a\nman ought to make use of suspicions, as to provide,\nas if that should be true, that he suspects, yet it\nmay do him no hurt.  Suspicions that the mind of\nitself gathers, are but buzzes; but suspicions that\nare artificially nourished, and put into men’s\nheads, by the tales and whisperings of others, have\nstings.  Certainly, the best mean, to clear the way\nin this same wood of suspicions, is frankly to communicate them with the party, that he suspects;\nfor thereby he shall be sure to know more of the\ntruth of them, than he did before; and withal shall\nmake that party more circumspect, not to give\nfurther cause of suspicion.  But this would not be\ndone to men of base natures; for they, if they find\nthemselves once suspected, will never be true.  The\nItalian says, Sospetto licentia fede; as if suspicion,\ndid give a passport to faith; but it ought, rather, to\nkindle it to discharge itself.",
        "SOME, in their discourse,  desire rather commendation of wit, in being able to hold all\narguments, than of judgment, in discerning what\nis true; as if it were a praise, to know what might\nbe said, and not, what should be thought.  Some\nhave certain common places, and themes, wherein\nthey are good and want variety; which kind of\npoverty is for the most part tedious, and when it is\nonce perceived, ridiculous.  The honorablest part of\ntalk,  is to give the occasion; and again to moderate,\nand pass to somewhat else; for then a man leads the\ndance.  It is good, in discourse and speech of conversation,  to vary and intermingle speech of the\npresent occasion, with arguments, tales with reasons, asking of questions, with telling of opinions,\nand jest with earnest: for it is a dull thing to tire,\nand, as we say now, to jade, any thing too far.  As\nfor jest, there be certain things, which ought to be\nprivileged from it; namely, religion, matters of\nstate, great persons, any man’s present business of\nimportance, and any case that deserveth pity.  Yet\nthere be some, that think their wits have been\nasleep, except they dart out somewhat that is\npiquant, and to the quick.  That is a vein which\nwould be bridled:",

But let his questions not be troublesome; for that is fit for a poser.  And let him be sure\nto leave other men, their turns to speak.  Nay, if\nthere be any, that would reign and take up all\nthe time, let him find means to take them off,\nand to bring others on; as musicians use to do, with\nthose that dance too long galliards.  If you dissemble, sometimes, your knowledge of that you\nare thought to know, you shall be thought, another\ntime, to know that you know not.  Speech of a\nman’s self ought to be seldom, and well chosen.  I\nknew one, was wont to say in scorn, He must needs\nbe a wise man, he speaks so much of himself: and\nthere is but one case, wherein a man may commend himself with good grace; and that is in\ncommending virtue in another; especially if it be\nsuch a virtue, whereunto himself pretendeth.\nSpeech of touch towards others, should be sparingly used; for discourse ought to be as a field,\nwithout coming home to any man.  I knew two\nnoblemen, of the west part of England, whereof\nthe one was given to scoff, but kept ever royal cheer\nin his house; the other would ask, of those that had\nbeen at the other’s table, Tell truly, was there never\na flout or dry blow given? To which the guest\nwould answer, Such and such a thing passed.\nThe lord would say, I thought, he would mar a\ngood dinner.  Discretion of speech, is more than\neloquence; and to speak agreeably to him, with\nwhom we deal, is more than to speak in good\nwords, or in good order.  A good continued speech,\nwithout a good speech of interlocution, shows\nslowness: and a good reply or second speech, without a good settled speech, showeth shallowness\nand weakness.  As we see in beasts, that those that\nare weakest in the course, are yet nimblest in the\nturn; as it is betwixt the greyhound and the hare.\nTo use too many circumstances, ere one come to\nthe matter, is wearisome; to use none at all, is\nblunt.",
        "PLANTATIONS are amongst ancient, primitive, and heroical works.  When the world was\nyoung, it begat more children; but now it is old, it\nbegets fewer: for I may justly account new plantations, to be the children of former kingdoms.  I\nlike a plantation in a pure soil; that is, where\npeople are not displanted, to the end, to plant in\nothers.  For else it is rather an extirpation, than a\nplantation.  Planting of countries, is like planting\nof woods; for you must make account to leese almost twenty years’ profit, and expect your recompense in the end.  For the principal thing, that hath\nbeen the destruction of most plantations, hath\nbeen the base and hasty drawing of profit, in the\nfirst years.  It is true, speedy profit is not to be neglected, as far as may stand with the good of the\nplantation, but no further.  It is a shameful and\nunblessed thing, to take the scum of people, and\nwicked condemned men, to be the people with\nwhom you plant; and not only so, but it spoileth\nthe plantation; for they will ever live like rogues,\nand not fall to work, but be lazy, and do mischief,\nand spend victuals, and be quickly weary, and\nthen certify over to their country, to the discredit\nof the plantation.  The people wherewith you\nplant ought to be gardeners, ploughmen, laborers,\nsmiths, carpenters, joiners, fishermen, fowlers,\nwith some few apothecaries, surgeons, cooks, and\nbakers.  In a country of plantation, first look about,\nwhat kind of victual the country yields of itself to\nhand; as chestnuts, walnuts, pineapples, olives,\ndates, plums, cherries, wild honey, and the like;\nand make use of them.  Then consider what victual\nor esculent things there are, which grow speedily,\nand within the year; as parsnips, carrots, turnips,\nonions, radish, artichokes of Hierusalem, maize,\nand the like.  For wheat, barley, and oats, they ask\ntoo much labor; but with pease and beans you may\nbegin, both because they ask less labor, and because they serve for meat, as well as for bread.  And\nof rice, likewise cometh a great increase, and it is\na kind of meat.  Above all, there ought to be brought\nstore of biscuit, oat-meal, flour, meal, and the like,\nin the beginning, till bread may be had.  For beasts,\nor birds, take chiefly such as are least subject to\ndiseases, and multiply fastest; as swine, goats,\ncocks, hens, turkeys, geese, house-doves, and the\nlike.  The victual in plantations, ought to be expended almost as in a besieged town; that is, with\ncertain allowance.  And let the main part of the\nground, employed to gardens or corn, be to a common stock; and to be laid in, and stored up, and\nthen delivered out in proportion; besides some\nspots of ground, that any particular person will\nmanure for his own private.  Consider likewise\nwhat commodities, the soil where the plantation\nis, doth naturally yield, that they may some way\nhelp to defray the charge of the plantation (so it be\nnot, as was said, to the untimely prejudice of the\nmain business), as it hath fared with tobacco in\nVirginia.  Wood commonly aboundeth but too\nmuch; and therefore timber is fit to be one.  If there\nbe iron ore, and streams whereupon to set the mills,\niron is a brave commodity where wood aboundeth.\nMaking of bay-salt, if the climate be proper for it,\nwould be put in experience.  Growing silk likewise,\nif any be, is a likely commodity.  Pitch and tar,\nwhere store of firs and pines are, will not fail.  So\ndrugs and sweet woods, where they are, cannot\nbut yield great profit.  Soap-ashes likewise, and\nother things that may be thought of.  But moil not\ntoo much under ground; for the hope of mines is\nvery uncertain, and useth to make the planters\nlazy, in other things.  For government; let it be in\nthe hands of one, assisted with some counsel; and\nlet them have commission to exercise martial laws,\nwith some limitation.  And above all, let men make\nthat profit, of being in the wilderness, as they have\nGod always, and his service, before their eyes.  Let\nnot the government of the plantation, depend\nupon too many counsellors, and undertakers, in\nthe country that planteth, but upon a temperate\nnumber; and let those be rather noblemen and\ngentlemen, than merchants; for they look ever to\nthe present gain.  Let there be freedom from custom, till the plantation be of strength; and not\nonly freedom from custom, but freedom to carry\ntheir commodities, where they may make their\nbest of them, except there be some special cause of\ncaution.  Cram not in people, by sending too fast\ncompany after company; but rather harken how\nthey waste, and send supplies proportionably; but\nso, as the number may live well in the plantation,\nand not by surcharge be in penury.  It hath been a\ngreat endangering to the health of some plantations, that they have built along the sea and rivers,\nin marish and unwholesome grounds.  Therefore,\nthough you begin there, to avoid carriage and\nlike discommodities, yet build still rather upwards\nfrom the streams, than along.  It concerneth likewise the health of the plantation, that they have\ngood store of salt with them, that they may use it\nin their victuals, when it shall be necessary.  If you\nplant where savages are, do not only entertain\nthem, with trifles and gingles, but use them justly\nand graciously, with sufficient guard nevertheless;\nand do not win their favor, by helping them to invade their enemies, but for their defence it is not\namiss; and send oft of them, over to the country\nthat plants, that they may see a better condition\nthan their own, and commend it when they return.  When the plantation grows to strength, then\nit is time to plant with women, as well as with\nmen; that the plantation may spread into generations, and not be ever pieced from without.  It is the\nsinfullest thing in the world, to forsake or destitute\na plantation once in forwardness; for besides the\ndishonor, it is the guiltiness of blood of many commiserable persons.",
        "I CANNOT call riches better than the baggage\nof virtue.  The Roman word is better, impedimenta.  For as the baggage is to an army, so is riches\nto virtue.  It cannot be spared, nor left behind, but\nit hindereth the march; yea, and the care of it,\nsometimes loseth or disturbeth the victory.  Of\ngreat riches there is no real use, except it be in the\ndistribution; the rest is but conceit.  So saith Solomon, Where much is, there are many to consume\nit; and what hath the owner, but the sight of it\nwith his eyes? The personal fruition in any man,\ncannot reach to feel great riches: there is a custody\nof them; or a power of dole, and donative of them;\nor a fame of them; but no solid use to the owner.\nDo you not see what feigned prices, are set upon\nlittle stones and rarities? and what works of ostentation are undertaken, because there might seem\nto be some use of great riches? But then you will\nsay, they may be of use, to buy men out of dangers\nor troubles.  As Solomon saith, Riches are as a\nstrong hold, in the imagination of the rich man.\nBut this is excellently expressed, that it is in imagination, and not always in fact.  For certainly great\nriches, have sold more men, than they have bought\nout.  Seek not proud riches, but such as thou mayest\nget justly, use soberly, distribute cheerfully, and\nleave contentedly.  Yet have no abstract nor friarly\ncontempt of them.  But distinguish, as Cicero saith\nwell of Rabirius Posthumus, In studio rei amplificandae apparebat, non avaritiae praedam, sed\ninstrumentum bonitati quaeri.  Harken also to\nSolomon, and beware of hasty gathering of riches;\nQui festinat ad divitias, non erit insons.  The poets\nfeign, that when Plutus (which is Riches) is sent\nfrom Jupiter, he limps and goes slowly; but when\nhe is sent from Pluto, he runs, and is swift of foot.\nMeaning that riches gotten by good means, and\njust labor, pace slowly; but when they come by\nthe death of others (as by the course of inheritance,\ntestaments, and the like), they come tumbling\nupon a man.  But it mought be applied likewise to\nPluto, taking him for the devil.  For when riches\ncome from the devil (as by fraud and oppression,\nand unjust means), they come upon speed.  The\nways to enrich are many, and most of them foul.\nParsimony is one of the best, and yet is not innocent; for it withholdeth men from works of liberality and charity.  The improvement of the ground,\nis the most natural obtaining of riches; for it is our\ngreat mother’s blessing, the earth’s; but it is slow.\nAnd yet where men of great wealth do stoop to\nhusbandry, it multiplieth riches exceedingly.  I\nknew a nobleman in England, that had the greatest audits of any man in my time; a great grazier,\na great sheep-master, a great timber man, a great\ncollier, a great corn-master, a great lead-man, and\nso of iron, and a number of the like points of husbandry.  So as the earth seemed a sea to him, in\nrespect of the perpetual importation.  It was truly\nobserved by one, that himself came very hardly,\nto a little riches, and very easily, to great riches.\nFor when a man’s stock is come to that, that he can\nexpect the prime of markets, and overcome those\nbargains, which for their greatness are few men’s\nmoney, and be partner in the industries of younger\nmen, he cannot but increase mainly.  The gains of\nordinary trades and vocations are honest; and\nfurthered by two things chiefly: by diligence, and\nby a good name, for good and fair dealing.  But the\ngains of bargains, are of a more doubtful nature;\nwhen men shall wait upon others’ necessity, broke\nby servants and instruments to draw them on, put\noff others cunningly, that would be better chapmen, and the like practices, which are crafty and\nnaught.  As for the chopping of bargains, when a\nman buys not to hold but to sell over again, that\ncommonly grindeth double, both upon the seller,\nand upon the buyer.  Sharings do greatly enrich,\nif the hands be well chosen, that are trusted.  Usury\nis the certainest means of gain, though one of the\nworst; as that whereby a man doth eat his bread,\nin sudore vultus alieni; and besides, doth plough\nupon Sundays.  But yet certain though it be, it hath\nflaws; for that the scriveners and brokers do value\nunsound men, to serve their own turn.  The fortune\nin being the first, in an invention or in a privilege,\ndoth cause sometimes a wonderful overgrowth in\nriches; as it was with the first sugar man, in the\nCanaries.  Therefore if a man can play the true\nlogician, to have as well judgment, as invention,\nhe may do great matters; especially if the times be\nfit.  He that resteth upon gains certain, shall hardly\ngrow to great riches; and he that puts all upon\nadventures, doth oftentimes break and come to\npoverty: it is good, therefore, to guard adventures\nwith certainties, that may uphold losses.  Monopolies, and coemption of wares for re-sale, where\nthey are not restrained, are great means to enrich;\nespecially if the party have intelligence, what\nthings are like to come into request, and so store\nhimself beforehand.  Riches gotten by service,\nthough it be of the best rise, yet when they are\ngotten by flattery, feeding humors, and other servile conditions, they may be placed amongst the\nworst.  As for fishing for testaments and executorships (as Tacitus saith of Seneca, testamenta et\norbos tamquam indagine capi), it is yet worse; by\nhow much men submit themselves to meaner persons, than in service.  Believe not much, them that\nseem to despise riches; for they despise them, that\ndespair of them; and none worse, when they come\nto them.  Be not penny-wise; riches have wings,\nand sometimes they fly away of themselves, sometimes they must be set flying, to bring in more.\nMen leave their riches, either to their kindred, or\nto the public; and moderate portions, prosper best\nin both.  A great state left to an heir, is as a lure to\nall the birds of prey round about, to seize on him, if\nhe be not the better stablished in years and judgment.  Likewise glorious gifts and foundations, are\nlike sacrifices without salt; and but the painted\nsepulchres of alms, which soon will putrefy, and\ncorrupt inwardly.  Therefore measure not thine\nadvancements, by quantity, but frame them by\nmeasure: and defer not charities till death; for,\ncertainly, if a man weigh it rightly, he that doth\nso, is rather liberal of another man’s, than of his\nown.",
        "I MEAN not to speak of divine prophecies; nor\nof heathen oracles; nor of natural predictions;\nbut only of prophecies that have been of certain memory, and from hidden causes.  Saith the\nPythonissa to Saul, To-morrow thou and thy son\nshall be with me.  Homer hath these verses:",

        "a prophecy of the discovery of America.  The daughter of Polycrates, dreamed that Jupiter bathed her\nfather, and Apollo anointed him; and it came to\npass, that he was crucified in an open place, where\nthe sun made his body run with sweat, and the\nrain washed it.  Philip of Macedon dreamed, he\nsealed up bis wife’s belly; whereby he did expound\nit, that his wife should be barren; but Aristander\nthe soothsayer, told him his wife was with child,\nbecause men do not use to seal vessels, that are\nempty.  A phantasm that appeared to M. Brutus, in\nhis tent, said to him, Philippis iterum me videbis.\nTiberius said to Galba, Tu quoque, Galba, degustabis imperium.  In Vespasian’s time, there went a\nprophecy in the East, that those that should come\nforth of Judea, should reign over the world:\nwhich though it may be was meant of our Savior;\nyet Tacitus expounds it of Vespasian.  Domitian\ndreamed, the night before he was slain, that a\ngolden head was growing, out of the nape of his\nneck: and indeed, the succession that followed him\nfor many years, made golden times.  Henry the\nSixth of England, said of Henry the Seventh, when\nhe was a lad, and gave him water, This is the lad\nthat shall enjoy the crown, for which we strive.\nWhen I was in France, I heard from one Dr. Pena,\nthat the Queen Mother, who was given to curious\narts, caused the King her husband’s nativity to be\ncalculated, under a false name; and the astrologer\ngave a judgment, that he should be killed in a duel;\nat which the Queen laughed, thinking her husband to be above challenges and duels: but he was\nslain upon a course at tilt, the splinters of the staff\nof Montgomery going in at his beaver.

There was also another prophecy, before the year of ’88, which I do not well\nunderstand.",

        "Octogesimus octavus mirabilis annus,",
        "was thought likewise accomplished in the sending\nof that great fleet, being the greatest in strength,\nthough not in number, of all that ever swam upon\nthe sea.  As for Cleon’s dream, I think it was a jest.\nIt was, that he was devoured of a long dragon; and\nit was expounded of a maker of sausages, that\ntroubled him exceedingly.  There are numbers of\nthe like kind; especially if you include dreams, and\npredictions of astrology.  But I have set down these\nfew only, of certain credit, for example.  My judgment is, that they ought all to be despised; and\nought to serve but for winter talk by the fireside.\nThough when I say despised, I mean it as for belief; for otherwise, the spreading, or publishing,\nof them, is in no sort to be despised.  For they have\ndone much mischief; and I see many severe laws\nmade, to suppress them.  That that hath given them\ngrace, and some credit, consisteth in three things.\nFirst, that men mark when they hit, and never\nmark when they miss; as they do generally also of\ndreams.  The second is, that probable conjectures,\nor obscure traditions, many times turn themselves\ninto prophecies; while the nature of man, which\ncoveteth divination, thinks it no peril to foretell\nthat which indeed they do but collect.  As that of\nSeneca’s verse.  For so much was then subject to\ndemonstration, that the globe of the earth had\ngreat parts beyond the Atlantic, which mought\nbe probably conceived not to be all sea: and adding\nthereto the tradition in Plato’s Timaeus, and his\nAtlanticus, it mought encourage one to turn it to\na prediction.  The third and last (which is the great\none) is, that almost all of them, being infinite in\nnumber, have been impostures, and by idle and\ncrafty brains merely contrived and feigned, after\nthe event past.",
        "AMBITION is like choler; which is an humor\nthat maketh men active, earnest, full of alacrity, and stirring, if it be not stopped.  But if it be\nstopped, and cannot have his way, it becometh\nadust, and thereby malign and venomous.  So ambitious men, if they find the way open for their\nrising, and still get forward, they are rather busy\nthan dangerous; but if they be checked in their\ndesires, they become secretly discontent, and look\nupon men and matters with an evil eye, and are\nbest pleased, when things go backward; which is\nthe worst property in a servant of a prince, or state.\nTherefore it is good for princes, if they use ambitious men, to handle it, so as they be still progressive and not retrograde; which, because it cannot\nbe without inconvenience, it is good not to use such\nnatures at all.  For if they rise not with their service,\nthey will take order, to make their service fall with\nthem.  But since we have said, it were good not to\nuse men of ambitious natures, except it be upon\nnecessity, it is fit we speak, in what cases they are\nof necessity.  Good commanders in the wars must\nbe taken, be they never so ambitious; for the use\nof their service, dispenseth with the rest; and to\ntake a soldier without ambition, is to pull off his\nspurs.  There is also great use of ambitious men, in\nbeing screens to princes in matters of danger and\nenvy; for no man will take that part, except he be\nlike a seeled dove, that mounts and mounts, because he cannot see about him.  There is use also of\nambitious men, in pulling down the greatness of\nany subject that overtops; as Tiberius used Marco,\nin the pulling down of Sejanus.  Since, therefore,\nthey must be used in such cases, there resteth to\nspeak, how they are to be bridled, that they may be\nless dangerous.  There is less danger of them, if they\nbe of mean birth, than if they be noble; and if they\nbe rather harsh of nature, than gracious and popular: and if they be rather new raised, than grown\ncunning, and fortified, in their greatness.  It is\ncounted by some, a weakness in princes, to have\nfavorites; but it is, of all others, the best remedy\nagainst ambitious great-ones.  For when the way\nof pleasuring, and displeasuring, lieth by the\nfavorite, it is impossible any other should be overgreat.  Another means to curb them, is to balance\nthem by others, as proud as they.  But then there\nmust be some middle counsellors, to keep things\nsteady; for without that ballast, the ship will roll\ntoo much.  At the least, a prince may animate\nand inure some meaner persons, to be as it were\nscourges, to ambitions men.  As for the having of\nthem obnoxious to ruin; if they be of fearful\nnatures, it may do well; but if they be stout and\ndaring, it may precipitate their designs, and prove\ndangerous.  As for the pulling of them down, if the\naffairs require it, and that it may not be done with\nsafety suddenly, the only way is the interchange,\ncontinually, of favors and disgraces; whereby\nthey may not know what to expect, and be, as it\nwere, in a wood.  Of ambitions, it is less harmful,\nthe ambition to prevail in great things, than that\nother, to appear in every thing; for that breeds\nconfusion, and mars business.  But yet it is less danger, to have an ambitious man stirring in business,\nthan great in dependences.  He that seeketh to be\neminent amongst able men, hath a great task; but\nthat is ever good for the public.  But he, that plots\nto be the only figure amongst ciphers, is the decay\nof a whole age.  Honor hath three things in it: the\nvantage ground to do good; the approach to kings\nand principal persons; and the raising of a man’s\nown fortunes.  He that hath the best of these intentions, when he aspireth, is an honest man; and that\nprince, that can discern of these intentions in another that aspireth, is a wise prince.  Generally, let\nprinces and states choose such ministers, as are\nmore sensible of duty than of using; and such as\nlove business rather upon conscience, than upon\nbravery, and let them discern a busy nature, from\na willing mind.",
        "AND TRIUMPHS",
        "THESE things are but toys, to come amongst\nsuch serious observations.  But yet, since\nprinces will have such things, it is better they\nshould be graced with elegancy, than daubed with\ncost.  Dancing to song, is a thing of great state and\npleasure.  I understand it, that the song be in quire,\nplaced aloft, and accompanied with some broken\nmusic; and the ditty fitted to the device.  Acting in\nsong, especially in dialogues, hath an extreme\ngood grace; I say acting, not dancing (for that is a\nmean and vulgar thing); and the voices of the dialogue would be strong and manly (a base and a\ntenor; no treble); and the ditty high and tragical;\nnot nice or dainty.  Several quires, placed one over\nagainst another, and taking the voice by catches,\nanthem-wise, give great pleasure.  Turning dances\ninto figure, is a childish curiosity.  And generally\nlet it be noted, that those things which I here set\ndown, are such as do naturally take the sense, and\nnot respect petty wonderments.  It is true, the alterations of scenes, so it be quietly and without\nnoise, are things of great beauty and pleasure; for\nthey feed and relieve the eye, before it be full of\nthe same object.  Let the scenes abound with light,\nspecially colored and varied; and let the masquers,\nor any other, that are to come down from the\nscene, have some motions upon the scene itself,\nbefore their coming down; for it draws the eye\nstrangely, and makes it, with great pleasure, to\ndesire to see, that it cannot perfectly discern.  Let\nthe songs be loud and cheerful, and not chirpings\nor pulings.  Let the music likewise be sharp and\nloud, and well placed.  The colors that show best by\ncandle-light are white, carnation, and a kind of\nsea-water-green; and oes, or spangs, as they are of\nno great cost, so they are of most glory.  As for rich\nembroidery, it is lost and not discerned.  Let the\nsuits of the masquers be graceful, and such as become the person, when the vizors are off; not after\nexamples of known attires; Turke, soldiers, mariners’, and the like.  Let anti-masques not be long;\nthey have been commonly of fools, satyrs, baboons,\nwild-men, antics, beasts, sprites, witches, Ethiops,\npigmies, turquets, nymphs, rustics, Cupids, statuas\nmoving, and the like.  As for angels, it is not comical enough, to put them in anti-masques; and\nanything that is hideous, as devils, giants, is on\nthe other side as unfit.  But chiefly, let the music\nof them be recreative, and with some strange\nchanges.  Some sweet odors suddenly coming forth,\nwithout any drops falling, are, in such a company\nas there is steam and heat, things of great pleasure\nand refreshment.  Double masques, one of men,\nanother of ladies, addeth state and variety.  But all\nis nothing except the room be kept clear and neat.",

But\nenough of these toys.",
        "IN MEN",
        "NATURE is often hidden; sometimes overcome; seldom extinguished.  Force, maketh\nnature more violent in the return; doctrine and discourse, maketh nature less importune; but custom\nonly doth alter and subdue nature.  He that seeketh\nvictory over his nature, let him not set himself too\ngreat, nor too small tasks; for the first will make\nhim dejected by often failings; and the second will\nmake him a small proceeder, though by often prevailings.  And at the first let him practise with\nhelps, as swimmers do with bladders or rushes;\nbut after a time let him practise with disadvantages, as dancers do with thick shoes.  For it breeds\ngreat perfection, if the practice be harder than the\nuse.  Where nature is mighty, and therefore the\nvictory hard, the degrees had need be, first to stay\nand arrest nature in time; like to him that would\nsay over the four and twenty letters when he was\nangry; then to go less in quantity; as if one should,\nin forbearing wine, come from drinking healths,\nto a draught at a meal; and lastly, to discontinue\naltogether.  But if a man have the fortitude, and\nresolution, to enfranchise himself at once, that is\nthe best:",
        "Optimus ille animi vindex laedentia pectus\nVincula qui rupit, dedoluitque semel.",
        "Neither is the ancient rule amiss, to bend nature,\nas a wand, to a contrary extreme, whereby to set it\nright, understanding it, where the contrary extreme is no vice.  Let not a man force a habit upon\nhimself, with a perpetual continuance, but with\nsome intermission.  For both the pause reinforceth\nthe new onset; and if a man that is not perfect, be\never in practice, he shall as well practise his errors,\nas his abilities, and induce one habit of both; and\nthere is no means to help this, but by seasonable\nintermissions.  But let not a man trust his victory\nover his nature, too far; for nature will lay buried\na great time, and yet revive, upon the occasion or\ntemptation.  Like as it was with AEsop’s damsel,\nturned from a cat to a woman, who sat very demutely at the board’s end, till a mouse ran before\nher.  Therefore, let a man either avoid the occasion\naltogether; or put himself often to it, that he may\nbe little moved with it.  A man’s nature is best perceived in privateness, for there is no affectation;\nin passion, for that putteth a man out of his precepts; and in a new case or experiment, for there\ncustom leaveth him.  They are happy men, whose\nnatures sort with their vocations; otherwise they\nmay say, multum incola fuit anima mea; when\nthey converse in those things, they do not affect.\nIn studies, whatsoever a man commandeth upon\nhimself, let him set hours for it; but whatsoever is\nagreeable to his nature, let him take no care for\nany set times; for his thoughts will fly to it, of\nthemselves; so as the spaces of other business, or\nstudies, will suffice.  A man’s nature, runs either to\nherbs or weeds; therefore let him seasonably water\nthe one, and destroy the other.",
        "AND EDUCATION",
        "MEN’S thoughts, are much according to their\ninclination; their discourse and speeches,\naccording to their learning and infused opinions;\nbut their deeds, are after as they have been accustomed.  And therefore, as Machiavel well noteth\n(though in an evil-favored instance), there is no\ntrusting to the force of nature, nor to the bravery\nof words, except it be corroborate by custom.  His\ninstance is, that for the achieving of a desperate\nconspiracy, a man should not rest upon the fierceness of any man’s nature, or his resolute undertakings; but take such an one, as hath had his\nhands formerly in blood.  But Machiavel knew not\nof a Friar Clement, nor a Ravillac, nor a Jaureguy,\nnor a Baltazar Gerard; yet his rule holdeth still,\nthat nature, nor the engagement of words, are not\nso forcible, as custom.  Only superstition is now so\nwell advanced, that men of the first blood, are as\nfirm as butchers by occupation; and votary resolution, is made equipollent to custom, even in matter of blood.  In other things, the predominancy of\ncustom is everywhere visible; insomuch as a man\nwould wonder, to hear men profess, protest, engage, give great words, and then do, just as they\nhave done before; as if they were dead images,\nand engines moved only by the wheels of custom.\nWe see also the reign or tyranny of custom, what\nit is.  The Indians (I mean the sect of their wise men)\nlay themselves quietly upon a stock of wood, and\nso sacrifice themselves by fire.  Nay, the wives\nstrive to be burned, with the corpses of their husbands.  The lads of Sparta, of ancient time, were\nwont to be scourged upon the altar of Diana, without so much as queching.  I remember, in the beginning of Queen Elizabeth’s time of England, an\nIrish rebel condemned, put up a petition to the\ndeputy, that he might be hanged in a withe, and\nnot in an halter; because it had been so used, with\nformer rebels.  There be monks in Russia, for penance, that will sit a whole night in a vessel of water,\ntill they be engaged with hard ice.  Many examples\nmay be put of the force of custom, both upon mind\nand body.  Therefore, since custom is the principal\nmagistrate of man’s life, let men by all means endeavor, to obtain good customs.  Certainly custom\nis most perfect, when it beginneth in young years:\nthis we call education; which is, in effect, but an\nearly custom.  So we see, in languages, the tongue\nis more pliant to all expressions and sounds, the\njoints are more supple, to all feats of activity and\nmotions,  in youth than afterwards.  For it is true,\nthat late learners cannot so well take the ply; except it be in some minds, that have not suffered\nthemselves to fix, but have kept themselves open,\nand prepared to receive continual amendment,\nwhich is exceeding rare.  But if the force of custom simple and separate, be great, the force of\ncustom copulate and conjoined and collegiate, is\nfar greater.  For there example teacheth, company\ncomforteth, emulation quickeneth, glory raiseth:\nso as in such places the force of custom is in his\nexaltation.  Certainly the great multiplication of\nvirtues upon human nature, resteth upon societies well ordained and disciplined.  For commonwealths, and good governments, do nourish virtue\ngrown but do not much mend the deeds.  But the\nmisery is, that the most effectual means, are now\napplied to the ends, least to be desired.",
        "IT CANNOT be denied, but outward accidents\nconduce much to fortune; favor, opportunity,\ndeath of others, occasion fitting virtue.  But chiefly,\nthe mould of a man’s fortune is in his own hands.\nFaber quisque fortunae suae, saith the poet.  And\nthe most frequent of external causes is, that the\nfolly of one man, is the fortune of another.  For no\nman prospers so suddenly, as by others’ errors.\nSerpens nisi serpentem comederit non fit draco.\nOvert and apparent virtues, bring forth praise; but\nthere be secret and hidden virtues, that bring forth\nfortune; certain deliveries of a man’s self, which\nhave no name.  The Spanish name, desemboltura,\npartly expresseth them; when there be not stonds\nnor restiveness in a man’s nature; but that the\nwheels of his mind, keep way with the wheels of\nhis fortune.  For so Livy (after he had described\nCato Major in these words, In illo viro tantum robur corporis et animi fuit, ut quocunque loco natus\nesset, fortunam sibi facturus videretur) falleth\nupon that, that he had versatile ingenium.  Therefore if a man look sharply and attentively, he shall\nsee Fortune: for though she be blind, yet she is not\ninvisible.  The way of fortune, is like the Milken\nWay in the sky; which is a meeting or knot of a\nnumber of small stars; not seen asunder, but giving light together.  So are there a number of\nlittle, and scarce discerned virtues, or rather faculties and customs, that make men fortunate.  The\nItalians note some of them, such as a man would\nlittle think.  When they speak of one that cannot do\namiss, they will throw in, into his other conditions,\nthat he hath Poco di matto.  And certainly there be\nnot two more fortunate properties, than to have a\nlittle of the fool, and not too much of the honest.\nTherefore extreme lovers of their country or\nmasters, were never fortunate, neither can they\nbe. For when a man placeth his thoughts without\nhimself, he goeth not his own way.  An hasty fortune maketh an enterpriser and remover (the\nFrench hath it better, entreprenant, or remuant);\nbut the exercised fortune maketh the able man.\nFortune is to be honored and respected, and it be\nbut for her daughters, Confidence and Reputation.\nFor those two, Felicity breedeth; the first within\na man’s self, the latter in others towards him.  All\nwise men, to decline the envy of their own virtues,\nuse to ascribe them to Providence and Fortune; for\nso they may the better assume them: and, besides,\nit is greatness in a man, to be the care of the higher\npowers.  So Caesar said to the pilot in the tempest,\nCaesarem portas, et fortunam ejus.  So Sylla chose\nthe name of Felix, and not of Magnus.  And it hath\nbeen noted, that those who ascribe openly too\nmuch to their own wisdom and policy, end infortunate.  It is written that Timotheus the Athenian,\nafter he had, in the account he gave to the state of\nhis government, often interlaced this speech, and\nin this, Fortune had no part, never prospered in\nanything, he undertook afterwards.  Certainly\nthere be, whose fortunes are like Homer’s verses,\nthat have a slide and easiness more than the verses\nof other poets; as Plutarch saith of Timoleon’s fortune, in respect of that of Agesilaus or Epaminondas.  And that this shoulld be, no doubt it is much,\nin a man’s self.",
        "MANY have made witty invectives against\nusury.  They say that it is a pity, the devil\nshould have God’s part, which is the tithe.  That the\nusurer is the greatest Sabbath-breaker, because his\nplough goeth every Sunday.  That the usurer is the\ndrone, that Virgil speaketh of;",
        "Ignavum fucos pecus a praesepibus arcent.",
        "That the usurer breaketh the first law, that was\nmade for mankind after the fall, which was, in\nsudore vultus tui comedes panem tuum; not, in\nsudore vultus alieni.  That usurers should have\norange-tawny bonnets, because they do judaize.\nThat it is against nature for money to beget money;\nand the like.  I say this only, that usury is a concessum propter duritiem cordis; for since there must\nbe borrowing and lending, and men are so hard\nof heart, as they will not lend freely, usury must\nbe permitted.  Some others, have made suspicious\nand cunning propositions of banks, discovery of\nmen’s estates, and other inventions.  But few have\nspoken of usury usefully.  It is good to set before us,\nthe incommodities and commodities of usury, that\nthe good, may be either weighed out or culled out;\nand warily to provide, that while we make forth\nto that which is better, we meet not with that\nwhich is worse.",
        "The discommodities of usury are, First, that it\nmakes fewer merchants.  For were it not for this\nlazy trade of usury, money would not he still, but\nwould in great part be employed upon merchandizing; which is the vena porta of wealth in a state.\nThe second, that it makes poor merchants.  For, as\na farmer cannot husband his ground so well, if he\nsit at a great rent; so the merchant cannot drive\nhis trade so well, if he sit at great usury.  The third\nis incident to the other two; and that is the decay of\ncustoms of kings or states, which ebb or flow, with\nmerchandizing.  The fourth, that it bringeth the\ntreasure of a realm, or state, into a few hands.  For\nthe usurer being at certainties, and others at uncertainties, at the end of the game, most of the money\nwill be in the box; and ever a state flourisheth,\nwhen wealth is more equally spread.  The fifth,\nthat it beats down the price of land; for the employment of money, is chiefly either merchandizing or purchasing; and usury waylays both.  The\nsixth, that it doth dull and damp all industries, improvements, and new inventions, wherein money\nwould be stirring, if it were not for this slug.  The\nlast, that it is the canker and ruin of many men’s\nestates; which, in process of time, breeds a public\npoverty.",
        "On the other side, the commodities of usury are,\nfirst, that howsoever usury in some respect hindereth merchandizing, yet in some other it advanceth\nit; for it is certain that the greatest part of trade is\ndriven by young merchants, upon borrowing at\ninterest; so as if the usurer either call in, or keep\nback, his money, there will ensue, presently, a\ngreat stand of trade.  The second is, that were it not\nfor this easy borrowing upon interest, men’s necessities would draw upon them a most sudden undoing; in that they would be forced to sell their\nmeans (be it lands or goods) far under foot; and so,\nwhereas usury doth but gnaw upon them, bad\nmarkets would swallow them quite up.  As for\nmortgaging or pawning, it will little mend the\nmatter: for either men will not take pawns without use; or if they do, they will look precisely for\nthe forfeiture.  I remember a cruel moneyed man\nin the country, that would say, The devil take this\nusury, it keeps us from forfeitures, of mortgages\nand bonds.  The third and last is, that it is a vanity\nto conceive, that there would be ordinary borrowing without profit; and it is impossible to conceive,\nthe number of inconveniences that will ensue, if\nborrowing be cramped.  Therefore to speak of the\nabolishing of usury is idle.  All states have ever had\nit, in one kind or rate, or other.  So as that opinion\nmust be sent to Utopia.",
        "To speak now of the reformation, and reiglement, of usury; how the discommodities of it may\nbe best avoided, and the commodities retained.  It\nappears, by the balance of commodities and discommodities of usury, two things are to be reconciled.  The one, that the tooth of usury be grinded,\nthat it bite not too much; the other, that there be\nleft open a means, to invite moneyed men to lend\nto the merchants, for the continuing and quickening of trade.  This cannot be done, except you introduce two several sorts of usury, a less and a greater.\nFor if you reduce usury to one low rate, it will ease\nthe common borrower, but the merchant will be\nto seek for money.  And it is to be noted, that the\ntrade of merchandize, being the most lucrative,\nmay bear usury at a good rate; other contracts\nnot so.",
        "To serve both intentions, the way would be\nbriefly thus.  That there be two rates of usury:\nthe one free, and general for all; the other under\nlicense only, to certain persons, and in certain\nplaces of merchandizing.  First, therefore, let usury\nin general, be reduced to five in the hundred; and\nlet that rate be proclaimed, to be free and current;\nand let the state shut itself out, to take any penalty\nfor the same.  This will preserve borrowing, from\nany general stop or dryness.  This will ease infinite\nborrowers in the country.  This will, in good part,\nraise the price of land, because land purchased\nat sixteen years’ purchase will yield six in the\nhundred, and somewhat more; whereas this rate\nof interest, yields but five.  This by like reason\nwill encourage, and edge, industrious and profitable improvements; because many will rather\nventure in that kind, than take five in the hundred, especially having been used to greater profit.\nSecondly, let there be certain persons licensed,\nto lend to known merchants, upon usury at a\nhigher rate; and let it be with the cautions following.  Let the rate be, even with the merchant\nhimself, somewhat more easy than that he used\nformerly to pay; for by that means, all borrowers, shall have some ease by this reformation,\nbe he merchant, or whosoever.  Let it be no\nbank or common stock, but every man be master\nof his own money.  Not that I altogether mislike banks, but they will hardly be brooked, in\nregard of certain suspicions.  Let the state be\nanswered some small matter for the license, and\nthe rest left to the lender; for if the abatement be\nbut small, it will no whit discourage the lender.\nFor he, for example, that took before ten or nine in\nthe hundred, will sooner descend to eight in the\nhundred than give over his trade of usury, and go\nfrom certain gains, to gains of hazard.  Let these\nlicensed lenders be in number indefinite, but restrained to certain principal cities and towns of\nmerchandizing; for then they will be hardly able\nto color other men’s moneys in the country: so as\nthe license of nine will not suck away the current\nrate of five; for no man will send his moneys far\noff, nor put them into unknown hands.",
        "If it be objected that this doth in a sort authorize\nusury, which before, was in some places but permissive; the answer is, that it is better to mitigate\nusury, by declaration, than to suffer it to rage, by\nconnivance.",
        "\nOf Youth",
        "AND AGE",
        "A MAN that is young in years, may be old in\nhours, if he have lost no time.  But that happeneth rarely.  Generally, youth is like the first\ncogitations, not so wise as the second.  For there is\na youth in thoughts, as well as in ages.  And yet the\ninvention of young men, is more lively than that\nof old; and imaginations stream into their minds\nbetter, and, as it were, more divinely.  Natures that\nhave much heat, and great and violent desires and\nperturbations, are not ripe for action, till they have\npassed the meridian of their years; as it was with\nJulius Caesar and Septimius Severus.  Of the latter,\nof whom it is said, Juventutem egit erroribus, imo\nfuroribus, plenam.  And yet he was the ablest emperor, almost, of all the list.  But reposed natures\nmay do well in youth.  As it is seen in Augustus\nCaesar, Cosmus Duke of Florence, Gaston de Foix,\nand others.  On the other side, heat and vivacity in\nage, is an excellent composition for business.\nYoung men are fitter to invent, than to judge; fitter\nfor execution, than for counsel; and fitter for new\nprojects, than for settled business.  For the experience of age, in things that fall within the compass\nof it, directeth them; but in new things, abuseth\nthem.",
        "The errors of young men, are the ruin of business; but the errors of aged men, amount but to\nthis, that more might have been done, or sooner.\nYoung men, in the conduct and manage of actions,\nembrace more than they can hold; stir more than\nthey can quiet; fly to the end, without consideration of the means and degrees; pursue some\nfew principles, which they have chanced upon\nabsurdly; care not to innovate, which draws unknown inconveniences; use extreme remedies at\nfirst; and, that which doubleth all errors, will not\nacknowledge or retract them; like an unready\nhorse, that will neither stop nor turn.  Men of age\nobject too much, consult too long, adventure too\nlittle, repent too soon, and seldom drive business\nhome to the full period, but content themselves\nwith a mediocrity of success.  Certainly it is good to\ncompound employments of both; for that will be\ngood for the present, because the virtues of either\nage, may correct the defects of both; and good for\nsuccession, that young men may be learners, while\nmen in age are actors; and, lastly, good for extern\naccidents, because authority followeth old men,\nand favor and popularity, youth.  But for the moral\npart, perhaps youth will have the pre-eminence, as\nage hath for the politic.  A certain rabbin, upon the\ntext, Your young men shall see visions, and your\nold men shall dream dreams, inferreth that young\nmen, are admitted nearer to God than old, because\nvision, is a clearer revelation, than a dream.  And\ncertainly, the more a man drinketh of the world,\nthe more it intoxicateth; and age doth profit rather\nin the powers of understanding, than in the virtues\nof the will and affections.  There be some, have an\nover-early ripeness in their years, which fadeth\nbetimes.  These are, first, such as have brittle wits,\nthe edge whereof is soon turned; such as was Hermogenes the rhetorician, whose books are exceeding subtle; who afterwards waxed stupid.  A second\nsort, is of those that have some natural dispositions\nwhich have better grace in  youth, than in age;\nsuch as is a fluent and luxuriant speech; which\nbecomes youth well, but not age: so Tully saith of\nHortensius, Idem manebat, neque idem decebat.\nThe third is of such, as take too high a strain at the\nfirst, and are magnanimous, more than tract of\nyears can uphold.  As was Scipio Africanus, of\nwhom Livy saith in effect, Ultima primis cedebant.",
        "VIRTUE is like a rich stone, best plain set; and\nsurely virtue is best, in a body that is comely,\nthough not of delicate features; and that hath\nrather dignity of presence, than beauty of aspect.\nNeither is it almost seen, that very beautiful persons are otherwise of great virtue; as if nature were\nrather busy, not to err, than in labor to produce\nexcellency.  And therefore they prove accomplished, but not of great spirit; and study rather\nbehavior, than virtue.  But this holds not always:\nfor Augustus Caesar, Titus Vespasianus, Philip le\nBelle of France, Edward the Fourth of England,\nAlcibiades of Athens, Ismael the Sophy of Persia,\nwere all high and great spirits; and yet the most\nbeautiful men of their times.  In beauty, that of\nfavor, is more than that of color; and that of decent\nand gracious motion, more than that of favor.  That\nis the best part of beauty, which a picture cannot\nexpress; no, nor the first sight of the life.  There is no\nexcellent beauty, that hath not some strangeness\nin the proportion.  A man cannot tell whether\nApelles, or Albert Durer, were the more trifler;\nwhereof the one, would make a personage by geometrical proportions; the other, by taking the best\nparts out of divers faces, to make one excellent.\nSuch personages, I think, would please nobody,\nbut the painter that made them.  Not but I think a\npainter may make a better face than ever was; but\nhe must do it by a kind of felicity (as a musician\nthat maketh an excellent air in music), and not by\nrule.  A man shall see faces, that if you examine\nthem part by part, you shall find never a good;\nand yet altogether do well.  If it be true that the\nprincipal part of beauty is in decent motion, certainly it is no marvel, though persons in years\nseem many times more amiable; pulchrorum\nautumnus pulcher; for no youth can be comely\nbut by pardon, and considering the youth, as to\nmake up the comeliness.  Beauty is as summer\nfruits,) which are easy to corrupt, and cannot last;\nand for the most part it makes a dissolute youth,\nand an age a little out of countenance; but yet certainly again, if it light well, it maketh virtue shine,\nand vices blush.",
        "DEFORMED persons are commonly even with\nnature; for as nature hath done ill by them,\nso do they by nature; being for the most part (as\nthe Scripture saith) void of natural affection; and\nso they have their revenge of nature.  Certainly\nthere is a consent, between the body and the mind;\nand where nature erreth in the one, she ventureth\nin the other.  Ubi peccat in uno, periclitatur in altero.  But because there is, in man, an election\ntouching the frame of his mind, and a necessity in\nthe frame of his body, the stars of natural inclination are sometimes obscured, by the sun of discipline and virtue.  Therefore it is good to consider of\ndeformity, not as a sign, which is more deceivable;\nbut as a cause, which seldom faileth of the effect.\nWhosoever hath anything fixed in his person, that\ndoth induce contempt, hath also a perpetual spur\nin himself, to rescue and deliver himself from\nscorn.  Therefore all deformed persons, are extreme\nbold.  First, as in their own defence, as being exposed to scorn; but in process of time, by a general\nhabit.  Also it stirreth in them industry, and especially of this kind, to watch and observe the weakness of others, that they may have somewhat to\nrepay.  Again, in their superiors, it quencheth\njealousy towards them, as persons that they think\nthey may, at pleasure, despise: and it layeth their\ncompetitors and emulators asleep; as never believing they should be in possibility of advancement,\ntill they see them in possession.  So that upon the\nmatter, in a great wit, deformity is an advantage\nto rising.  Kings in ancient times (and at this present in some countries) were wont to put great trust\nin eunuchs; because they that are envious towards\nall are more obnoxious and officious, towards one.\nBut yet their trust towards them, hath rather\nbeen as to good spials, and good wbisperers, than\ngood magistrates and officers.  And much like is\nthe reason of deformed persons.  Still the ground\nis, they will, if they be of spirit, seek to free themselves from scorn; which must be either by virtue\nor malice; and therefore let it not be marvelled, if\nsometimes they prove excellent persons; as was\nAgesilaus, Zanger the son of Solyman, AEsop,\nGasca, President of Peru; and Socrates may go\nlikewise amongst them; with others.",
        "HOUSES are built to live in, and not to look on;\ntherefore let use be preferred before uniformity, except where both may be had.  Leave\nthe goodly fabrics of houses, for beauty only, to\nthe enchanted palaces of the poets; who build them\nwith small cost.  He that builds a fair house, upon\nan ill seat, committeth himself to prison.  Neither\ndo I reckon it an ill seat, only where the air is unwholesome; but likewise where the air is unequal;\nas you shall see many fine seats set upon a knap of\nground, environed with higher hills round about\nit; whereby the heat of the sun is pent in, and the\nwind gathereth as in troughs; so as you shall have,\nand that suddenly, as great diversity of heat and\ncold as if you dwelt in several places.  Neither is it\nill air only that maketh an ill seat, but ill ways, ill\nmarkets; and, if you will consult with Momus, ill\nneighbors.  I speak not of many more; want of\nwater; want of wood, shade, and shelter; want of\nfruitfulness, and mixture of grounds of several\nnatures; want of prospect; want of level grounds;\nwant of places at some near distance for sports of\nhunting, hawking, and races; too near the sea, too\nremote; having the commodity of navigable rivers,\nor the discommodity of their overflowing; too far\noff from great cities, which may hinder business,\nor too near them, which lurcheth all provisions,\nand maketh everything dear; where a man hath\na great living laid together, and where he is\nscanted: all which, as it is impossible perhaps to\nfind together, so it is good to know them, and think\nof them, that a man may take as many as he can;\nand if he have several dwellings, that he sort them\nso  that what he wanteth in the one, he may find in\nthe other.  Lucullus answered Pompey well; who,\nwhen he saw his stately galleries, and rooms so\nlarge and lightsome, in one of his houses, said,\nSurely an excellent place for summer, but how do\nyou in winter? Lucullus answered, Why, do you\nnot think me as wise as some fowl are, that ever\nchange their abode towards the winter?",
        "To pass from the seat, to the house itself; we will\ndo as Cicero doth in the orator’s art; who writes\nbooks De Oratore, and a book he entitles Orator;\nwhereof the former, delivers the precepts of the\nart, and the latter, the perfection.  We will therefore describe a princely palace, making a brief\nmodel thereof.  For it is strange to see, now in\nEurope, such huge buildings as the Vatican and\nEscurial and some others be, and yet scarce a very\nfair room in them.",
        "First, therefore, I say you cannot have a perfect\npalace except you have two several sides; a side for\nthe banquet, as it is spoken of in the book of Hester,\nand a side for the household; the one for feasts and\ntriumphs, and the other for dwelling.  I understand\nboth these sides to be not only returns, but parts\nof the front; and to be uniform without, though\nseverally partitioned within; and to be on both\nsides of a great and stately tower, in the midst of\nthe front, that, as it were, joineth them together\non either hand.  I would have on the side of the banquet, in front, one only goodly room above stairs,\nof some forty foot high; and under it a room for a\ndressing, or preparing place, at times of triumphs.\nOn the other side, which is the household side, I\nwish it divided at the first, into a hall and a chapel\n(with a partition between); both of good state and\nbigness; and those not to go all the length, but to\nhave at the further end, a winter and a summer\nparlor, both fair.  And under these rooms, a fair\nand large cellar, sunk under ground; and likewise\nsome privy kitchens, with butteries and pantries,\nand the like.  As for the tower, I would have it two\nstories, of eighteen foot high apiece, above the two\nwings; and a goodly leads upon the top,railed with\nstatuas interposed; and the same tower to be divided into rooms, as shall be thought fit.  The stairs\nlikewise to the upper rooms, let them be upon a\nfair open newel, and finely railed in, with images\nof wood, cast into a brass color; and a very fair\nlanding-place at the top.  But this to be, if you do\nnot point any of the lower rooms, for a dining place\nof servants.  For otherwise, you shall have the servants’ dinner after your own: for the steam of it,\nwill come up as in a tunnel.  And so much for the\nfront.  Only I understand the height of the first\nstairs to be sixteen foot, which is the height of the\nlower room.",
        "Beyond this front, is there to be a fair court, but\nthree sides of it, of a far lower building than the\nfront.  And in all the four corners of that court, fair\nstaircases, cast into turrets, on the outside, and not\nwithin the row of buildings themselves.  But those\ntowers, are not to be of the height of the front, but\nrather proportionable to the lower building.  Let\nthe court not be paved, for that striketh up a great\nheat in summer, and much cold in winter.  But\nonly some side alleys, with a cross, and the quarters to graze, being kept shorn, but not too near\nshorn.  The row of return on the banquet side, let it\nbe all stately galleries: in which galleries let there\nbe three, or five, fine cupolas in the length of it,\nplaced at equal distance; and fine colored windows\nof several works.  On the household side, chambers\nof presence and ordinary entertainments, with\nsome bed-chambers; and let all three sides be a\ndouble house, without thorough lights on the sides,\nthat you may have rooms from the sun, both for\nforenoon and afternoon.  Cast it also, that you may\nhave rooms, both for summer and winter; shady\nfor summer, and warm for winter.  You shall have\nsometimes fair houses so full of glass, that one cannot tell where to become, to be out of the sun or\ncold.  For inbowed windows, I hold them of good\nuse (in cities, indeed, upright do better, in respect\nof the uniformity towards the street); for they be\npretty retiring places for conference; and besides,\nthey keep both the wind and sun off; for that\nwhich would strike almost through the room, doth\nscarce pass the window.  But let them be but few,\nfour in the court, on the sides only.",
        "Beyond this court, let there be an inward court,\nof the same square and height; which is to be environed with the garden on all sides; and in the\ninside, cloistered on all sides, upon decent and\nbeautiful arches, as high as the first story.  On the\nunder story, towards the garden, let it be turned\nto a grotto, or a place of shade, or estivation.  And\nonly have opening and windows towards the garden; and be level upon the floor, no whit sunken\nunder ground, to avoid all dampishness.  And let\nthere be a fountain, or some fair work of statuas, in\nthe midst of this court; and to be paved as the other\ncourt was.  These buildings to be for privy lodgings\non both sides; and the end for privy galleries.\nWhereof you must foresee that one of them be for\nan infirmary, if the prince or any special person\nshould be sick, with chambers, bed-chamber, antecamera, and recamera joining to it.  This upon the\nsecond story.  Upon the ground story, a fair gallery,\nopen, upon pillars; and upon the third story likewise, an open gallery, upon pillars, to take the\nprospect and freshness of the garden.  At both corners of the further side, by way of return, let there\nbe two delicate or rich cabinets, daintily paved,\nrichly hanged, glazed with crystalline glass, and\na rich cupola in the midst; and all other elegancy\nthat may be thought upon.  In the upper gallery\ntoo, I wish that there may be, if the place will yield\nit, some fountains running in divers places from\nthe wall, with some fine avoidances.  And thus\nmuch for the model of the palace; save that you\nmust have, before you come to the front, three\ncourts.  A green court plain, with a wall about it;\na second court of the same, but more garnished,\nwith little turrets, or rather embellishments, upon\nthe wall; and a third court, to make a square with\nthe front, but not to be built, nor yet enclosed with\na naked wall, but enclosed with terraces, leaded\naloft, and fairly garnished, on the three sides; and\ncloistered on the inside, with pillars, and not with\narches below.  As for offices, let them stand at distance, with some low galleries, to pass from them\nto the palace itself.",
        "G0D Almighty first planted a garden.  And\nindeed it is the purest of human pleasures.\nIt is the greatest refreshment to the spirits of man;\nwithout which, buildings and palaces are but\ngross handiworks; and a man shall ever see, that\nwhen ages grow to civility and elegancy, men\ncome to build stately sooner than to garden finely;\nas if gardening were the greater perfection.  I do\nhold it, in the royal ordering of gardens, there\nought to be gardens, for all the months in the year;\nin which severally things of beauty may be then\nin season.  For December, and January, and the\nlatter part of November, you must take such things\nas are green all winter: holly; ivy; bays; juniper;\ncypress-trees; yew; pine-apple-trees; fir-trees;\nrosemary; lavender; periwinkle, the white, the\npurple, and the blue; germander; flags; orangetrees; lemon-trees; and myrtles, if they be stoved;\nand sweet marjoram, warm set.  There followeth,\nfor the latter part of January and February, the\nmezereon-tree, which then blossoms; crocus vernus, both the yellow and the grey; primroses,\nanemones; the early tulippa; hyacinthus orientalis; chamairis; fritellaria.  For March, there\ncome violets, specially the single blue, which are\nthe earliest; the yellow daffodil; the daisy; the\nalmond-tree in blossom; the peach-tree in blossom; the cornelian-tree in blossom; sweet-briar.\nIn April follow the double white violet; the wallflower; the stock-gilliflower; the cowslip; flowerdelices, and lilies of all natures; rosemary-flowers;\nthe tulippa; the double peony; the pale daffodil;\nthe French honeysuckle; the cherry-tree in blossom; the damson and plum-trees in blossom; the\nwhite thorn in leaf; the lilac-tree.  In May and\nJune come pinks of all sorts, specially the blushpink; roses of all kinds, except the musk, which\ncomes later; honeysuckles; strawberries; bugloss;\ncolumbine; the French marigold, flos Africanus;\ncherry-tree in fruit; ribes; figs in fruit; rasps; vineflowers; lavender in flowers; the sweet satyrian,\nwith the white flower; herba muscaria; lilium\nconvallium; the apple-tree in blossom.  In July\ncome gilliflowers of all varieties; musk-roses; the\nlime-tree in blossom; early pears and plums in\nfruit; jennetings, codlins.  In August come plums\nof all sorts in fruit; pears; apricocks; berberries;\nfilberds; musk-melons; monks-hoods, of all colors.\nIn September come grapes; apples; poppies of\nall colors; peaches; melocotones; nectarines; cornelians; wardens; quinces.  In October and the\nbeginning of November come services; medlars;\nbullaces; roses cut or removed to come late; hollyhocks; and such like.  These particulars are for the\nclimate of London; but my meaning is perceived,\nthat you may have ver perpetuum, as the place\naffords.",
        "And because the breath of flowers is far sweeter\nin the air (where it comes and goes like the warbling of music) than in the hand, therefore nothing\nis more fit for that delight, than to know what be\nthe flowers and plants that do best perfume the air.\nRoses, damask and red, are fast flowers of their\nsmells; so that you may walk by a whole row of\nthem, and find nothing of their sweetness; yea\nthough it be in a morning’s dew.  Bays likewise\nyield no smell as they grow.  Rosemary little; nor\nsweet marjoram.  That which above all others\nyields the sweetest smell in the air is the violet,\nspecially the white double violet, which comes\ntwice a year; about the middle of April, and about\nBartholomew-tide.  Next to that is the musk-rose.\nThen the strawberry-leaves dying, which yield a\nmost excellent cordial smell.  Then the flower of\nvines; it is a little dust, like the dust of a bent, which\ngrows upon the cluster in the first coming forth.\nThen sweet-briar.  Then wall-flowers, which are\nvery delightful to be set under a parlor or lower\nchamber window.  Then pinks and gilliflowers,\nespecially the matted pink and clove gilliflower.\nThen the flowers of the lime-tree.  Then the honeysuckles, so they be somewhat afar off.  Of beanflowers I speak not, because they are field flowers.\nBut those which perfume the air most delightfully,\nnot passed by as the rest, but being trodden upon\nand crushed, are three; that is, burnet, wildthyme, and watermints.  Therefore you are to set\nwhole alleys of them, to have the pleasure when\nyou walk or tread.",
        "For gardens (speaking of those which are indeed\nprincelike, as we have done of buildings), the contents ought not well to be under thirty acres of\nground; and to be divided into three parts; a green\nin the entrance; a heath or desert in the going\nforth; and the main garden in the midst; besides\nalleys on both sides.  And I like well that four acres\nof ground be assigned to the green; six to the\nheath; four and four to either side; and twelve to\nthe main garden.  The green hath two pleasures:\nthe one, because nothing is more pleasant to the\neye than green grass kept finely shorn; the other,\nbecause it will give you a fair alley in the midst, by\nwhich you may go in front upon a stately hedge,\nwhich is to enclose the garden.  But because the\nalley will be long, and, in great heat of the year or\nday, you ought not to buy the shade in the garden,\nby going in the sun through the green, therefore\nyou are, of either side the green, to plant a covert\nalley upon carpenter’s work, about twelve foot in\nheight, by which you may go in shade into the\ngarden.  As for the making of knots or figures, with\ndivers colored earths,  that they may lie under the\nwindows of the house on that side which the garden stands, they be but toys; you may see as good\nsights, many times, in tarts.  The garden is best to\nbe square, encompassed on all the four sides with\na stately arched hedge.  The arches to be upon pillars of carpenter’s work, of some ten foot high, and\nsix foot broad; and the spaces between of the same\ndimension with the breadth of the arch.  Over the\narches let there be an entire hedge of some four\nfoot high, framed also upon carpenter’s work; and\nupon the upper hedge, over every arch, a little turret, with a belly, enough to receive a cage of birds:\nand over every space between the arches some\nother little figure, with broad plates of round colored glass gilt, for the sun to play upon.  But this\nhedge I intend to be raised upon a bank, not steep,\nbut gently slope, of some six foot, set all with\nflowers.  Also I understand, that this square of the\ngarden, should not be the whole breadth of the\nground, but to leave on either side, ground enough\nfor diversity of side alleys; unto which the two\ncovert alleys of the green, may deliver you.  But\nthere must be no alleys with hedges, at either end\nof this great enclosure; not at the hither end, for\nletting your prospect upon this fair hedge from\nthe green; nor at the further end, for letting your\nprospect from the hedge, through the arches upon\nthe heath.",
        "For the ordering of the ground, within the great\nhedge, I leave it to variety of device; advising\nnevertheless, that whatsoever form you cast it into,\nfirst, it be not too busy, or full of work.  Wherein I,\nfor my part, do not like images cut out in juniper\nor other garden stuff; they be for children.  Little\nlow hedges, round, like welts, with some pretty\npyramids, I like well; and in some places, fair\ncolumns upon frames of carpenter’s work.  I would\nalso have the alleys, spacious and fair.  You may\nhave closer alleys, upon the side grounds, but none\nin the main garden.  I wish also, in the very middle,\na fair mount, with three ascents, and alleys,\nenough for four to walk abreast; which I would\nhave to be perfect circles, without any bulwarks\nor embossments; and the whole mount to be thirty\nfoot high; and some fine banqueting-house, with\nsome chimneys neatly cast, and without too much\nglass.",
        "For fountains, they are a great beauty and refreshment; but pools mar all, and make the garden\nunwholesome, and full of flies and frogs.  Fountains I intend to be of two natures: the one that\nsprinkleth or spouteth water; the other a fair receipt of water, of some thirty or forty foot square,\nbut without fish, or slime, or mud.  For the first,\nthe ornaments of images gilt, or of marble, which\nare in use, do well: but the main matter is so to\nconvey the water, as it never stay, either in the\nbowls or in the cistern; that the water be never by\nrest discolored, green or red or the like; or gather\nany mossiness or putrefaction.  Besides that, it is to\nbe cleansed every day by the hand.  Also some\nsteps up to it, and some fine pavement about it,\ndoth well.  As for the other kind of fountain, which\nwe may call a bathing pool, it may admit much\ncuriosity and beauty; wherewith we will not\ntrouble ourselves: as, that the bottom be finely\npaved, and with images; the sides likewise; and\nwithal embellished with colored glass, and such\nthings of lustre; encompassed also with fine rails\nof low statuas.  But the main point is the same\nwhich we mentioned in the former kind of fountain; which is, that the water be in perpetual\nmotion, fed by a water higher than the pool, and\ndelivered into it by fair spouts, and then discharged away under ground, by some equality of\nbores, that it stay little.  And for fine devices, of\narching water without spilling, and making it rise\nin several forms (of feathers, drinking glasses,\ncanopies, and the like), they be pretty things to\nlook on, but nothing to health and sweetness.",
        "For the heath, which was the third part of our\nplot, I wish it to be framed, as much as may be, to\na natural wildness.  Trees I would have none in it,\nbut some thickets made only of sweet-briar and\nhoneysuckle, and some wild vine amongst; and\nthe ground set with violets, strawberries, and\nprimroses.  For these are sweet, and prosper in the\nshade.  And these to be in the heath, here and there,\nnot in any order.  I like also little heaps, in the nature of mole-hills (such as are in wild heaths), to\nbe set, some with wild thyme; some with pinks;\nsome with germander, that gives a good flower to\nthe eye; some with periwinkle; some with violets;\nsome with strawberries; some  with cowslips; some\nwith daisies; some with red roses; some with lilium\nconvallium; some with sweet-williams red; some\nwith bear’s-foot: and the like low flowers, being\nwithal sweet and sightly.  Part of which heaps, are\nto be with standards of little bushes pricked upon\ntheir top, and part without.  The standards to be\nroses; juniper; holly; berberries (but here and\nthere, because of the smell of their blossoms); red\ncurrants; gooseberries; rosemary; bays; sweetbriar; and such like.  But these standards to be kept\nwith cutting, that they grow not out of course.",
        "For the side grounds, you are to fill them with\nvariety of alleys, private, to give a full shade, some\nof them, wheresoever the sun be.  You are to frame\nsome of them, likewise, for shelter, that when the\nwind blows sharp you may walk as in a gallery.\nAnd those alleys must be likewise hedged at both\nends, to keep out the wind; and these closer alleys\nmust be ever finely gravelled, and no grass, because of going wet.  In many of these alleys, likewise, you are to set fruit-trees of all sorts; as well\nupon the walls, as in ranges.  And this would be\ngenerally observed, that the borders wherein you\nplant your fruit-trees, be fair and large, and low,\nand not steep; and set with fine flowers, but thin\nand sparingly, lest they deceive the trees.  At the\nend of both the side grounds, I would have a mount\nof some pretty height, leaving the wall of the enclosure breast high, to look abroad into the fields.",
        "For the main garden, I do not deny, but there\nshould be some fair alleys ranged on both sides,\nwith fruit-trees; and some pretty tufts of fruittrees, and arbors with seats, set in some decent\norder; but these to be by no means set too thick; but\nto leave the main garden so as it be not close, but\nthe air open and free.  For as for shade, I would\nhave you rest upon the alleys of the side grounds,\nthere to walk, if you be disposed, in the heat of the\nyear or day; but to make account, that the main\ngarden is for the more temperate parts of the year;\nand in the heat of summer, for the morning and\nthe evening, or overcast days.",
        "For aviaries, I like them not, except they be of\nthat largeness as they may be turfed, and have\nliving plants and bushes set in them; that the birds\nmay have more scope, and natural nesting, and\nthat no foulness appear in the floor of the aviary.\nSo I have made a platform of a princely garden,\npartly by precept, partly by drawing, not a model,\nbut some general lines of it; and in this I have\nspared for no cost.  But it is nothing for great\nprinces, that for the most part taking advice with\nworkmen, with no less cost set their things together; and sometimes add statuas and such things\nfor state and magnificence, but nothing to the true\npleasure of a garden.",
        "IT IS generally better to deal by speech than by\nletter; and by the mediation of a third than by\na man’s self.  Letters are good, when a man would\ndraw an answer by letter back again; or when it\nmay serve for a man’s justification afterwards to\nproduce his own letter; or where it may be danger\nto be interrupted, or heard by pieces.  To deal in\nperson is good, when a man’s face breedeth regard,\nas commonly with inferiors; or in tender cases,\nwhere a man’s eye, upon the countenance of him\nwith whom he speaketh, may give him a direction\nhow far to go; and generally, where a man will\nreserve to himself liberty, either to disavow or to\nexpound.  In choice of instruments, it is better to\nchoose men of a plainer sort, that are like to do\nthat, that is committed to them, and to report back\nagain faithfully the success, than those that are\ncunning, to contrive, out of other men’s business,\nsomewhat to grace themselves, and will help the\nmatter in report for satisfaction’s sake.  Use also\nsuch persons as affect the business, wherein they\nare employed; for that quickeneth much; and\nsuch, as are fit for the matter; as bold men for expostulation, fair-spoken men for persuasion, crafty\nmen for inquiry and observation, froward, and\nabsurd men, for business that doth not well bear\nout itself.  Use also such as have been lucky, and\nprevailed before, in things wherein you have employed them; for that breeds confidence, and they\nwill strive to maintain their prescription.  It is better to sound a person, with whom one deals afar\noff, than to fall upon the point at first; except you\nmean to surprise him by some short question.  It is\nbetter dealing with men in appetite, than with\nthose that are where they would be.  If a man deal\nwith another upon conditions, the start or first performance is all; which a man cannot reasonably\ndemand, except either the nature of the thing be\nsuch, which must go before; or else a man can\npersuade the other party, that he shall still need\nhim in some other thing; or else that he be counted\nthe honester man.  All practice is to discover, or to\nwork.  Men discover themselves in trust, in passion,\nat unawares, and of necessity, when they would\nhave somewhat done, and cannot find an apt pretext.  If you would work any man, you must either\nknow his nature and fashions, and so lead him; or\nhis ends, and so persuade him; or his weakness and\ndisadvantages, and so awe him; or those that have\ninterest in him, and so govern him.  In dealing with\ncunning persons,we must ever consider their ends,\nto interpret their speeches; and it is good to say\nlittle to them, and that which they least look for.\nIn all negotiations of difficulty, a man may not\nlook to sow and reap at once; but must prepare\nbusiness, and so ripen it by degrees.",
        "COSTLY followers are not to be liked; lest\nwhile a man maketh his train longer, he\nmake his wings shorter.  I reckon to be costly, not\nthem alone which charge the purse, but which are\nwearisome, and importune in suits.  Ordinary followers ought to challenge no higher conditions,\nthan countenance, recommendation, and protection from wrongs.  Factious followers are worse to\nbe liked, which follow not upon affection to him,\nwith whom they range themselves, but upon\ndiscontentment conceived against some other;\nwhereupon commonly ensueth that ill intelligence, that we many times see between great personages.  Likewise glorious followers, who make\nthemselves as trumpets of the commendation of\nthose they follow, are full of inconvenience; for\nthey taint business through want of secrecy; and\nthey export honor from a man, and make him a\nreturn in envy.  There is a kind of followers likewise, which are dangerous, being indeed espials;\nwhich inquire the secrets of the house, and bear\ntales of them, to others.  Yet such men, many times,\nare in great favor; for they are officious, and commonly exchange tales.  The following by certain\nestates of men, answerable to that, which a great\nperson himself professeth (as of soldiers, to him\nthat hath been employed in the wars, and the like),\nhath ever been a thing civil, and well taken, even\nin monarchies; so it be without too much pomp\nor popularity.  But the most honorable kind of following, is to be followed as one, that apprehendeth\nto advance virtue, and desert, in all sorts of persons.  And yet, where there is no eminent odds in\nsufficiency, it is better to take with the more passable, than with the more able.  And besides, to\nspeak truth, in base times, active men are of more\nuse than virtuous.  It is true that in government, it\nis good to use men of one rank equally: for to countenance some extraordinarily, is to make them\ninsolent, and the rest discontent; because they\nmay claim a due.  But contrariwise, in favor, to\nuse men with much difference and election is\ngood; for it maketh the persons preferred more\nthankful, and the rest more officious: because all is\nof favor.  It is good discretion, not to make too much\nof any man at the first; because one cannot hold\nout that proportion.  To be governed (as we call it)\nby one is not safe; for it shows softness, and gives\na freedom, to scandal and disreputation; for those,\nthat would not censure or speak ill of a man immediately, will talk more boldly of those that are so\ngreat with them, and thereby wound their honor.\nYet to be distracted with many is worse; for it\nmakes men to be of the last impression, and full of\nchange.  To take advice of some few friends, is ever\nhonorable; for lookers-on many times see more\nthan gamesters; and the vale best discovereth the\nhill.  There is little friendship in the world, and least\nof all between equals, which was wont to be magnified.  That that is, is between superior and inferior, whose fortunes may comprehend the one\nthe other.",
        "MANY ill matters and projects are undertaken; and private suits do putrefy the public good.  Many good matters, are undertaken with\nbad minds; I mean not only corrupt minds, but\ncrafty minds, that intend not performance.  Some\nembrace suits, which never mean to deal effectually in them; but if they see there may be life in\nthe matter, by some other mean, they will be content to win a thank, or take a second reward, or at\nleast to make use, in the meantime, of the suitor’s\nhopes.  Some take hold of suits, only for an occasion to cross some other; or to make an information, whereof they could not otherwise have apt\npretext; without care what become of the suit,\nwhen that turn is served; or, generally, to make\nother men’s business a kind of entertainment, to\nbring in their own.  Nay, some undertake suits,\nwith a full purpose to let them fall; to the end to\ngratify the adverse party, or competitor.  Surely\nthere is in some sort a right in every suit; either a\nright of equity, if it be a suit of controversy; or a\nright of desert, if it be a suit of petition.  If affection\nlead a man to favor the wrong side in justice, let\nhim rather use his countenance to compound the\nmatter, than to carry it.  If affection lead a man\nto favor the less worthy in desert, let him do it,\nwithout depraving or disabling the better deserver.\nIn suits which a man doth not well understand, it\nis good to refer them to some friend of trust and\njudgment, that may report, whether he may deal\nin them with honor: but let him choose well his\nreferendaries, for else he may be led by the nose.\nSuitors are so distasted with delays and abuses,\nthat plain dealing, in denying to deal in suits at\nfirst, and reporting the success barely, and in challenging no more thanks than one hath deserved,\nis grown not only honorable, but also gracious.  In\nsuits of favor, the first coming ought to take little\nplace: so far forth, consideration may be had of\nhis trust, that if intelligence of the matter could\nnot otherwise have been had, but by him, advantage be not taken of the note, but the party left to\nhis other means; and in some sort recompensed,\nfor his discovery.  To be ignorant of the value of a\nsuit, is simplicity; as well as to be ignorant of the\nright thereof, is want of conscience.  Secrecy in\nsuits, is a great mean of obtaining; for voicing\nthem to be in forwardness, may discourage some\nkind of suitors, but doth quicken and awake others.\nBut timing of the suit is the principal.  Timing, I\nsay, not only in respect of the person that should\ngrant it, but in respect of those, which are like to\ncross it.  Let a man, in the choice of his mean, rather\nchoose the fittest mean, than the greatest mean;\nand rather them that deal in certain things, than\nthose that are general.  The reparation of a denial,\nis sometimes equal to the first grant; if a man\nshow himself neither dejected nor discontented.\nIniquum petas ut aequum feras is a good rule,\nwhere a man hath strength of favor: but otherwise, a man were better rise in his suit; for\nhe, that would have ventured at first to have lost\nthe suitor, will not in the conclusion lose both the\nsuitor, and his own former favor.  Nothing is\nthought so easy a request to a great person, as his\nletter; and yet, if it be not in a good cause, it is so\nmuch out of his reputation.  There are no worse\ninstruments, than these general contrivers of suits;\nfor they are but a kind of poison, and infection, to\npublic proceedings.",
        "STUDIES serve for delight, for ornament, and\nfor ability.  Their chief use for delight, is in\nprivateness and retiring; for ornament, is in discourse; and for ability, is in the judgment, and\ndisposition of business.  For expert men can execute, and perhaps judge of particulars, one by one;\nbut the general counsels, and the plots and marshalling of affairs, come best, from those that are\nlearned.  To spend too much time in studies is sloth;\nto use them too much for ornament, is affectation;\nto make judgment wholly by their rules, is the\nhumor of a scholar.  They perfect nature, and are\nperfected by experience: for natural abilities are\nlike natural plants, that need proyning, by study;\nand studies themselves, do give forth directions too\nmuch at large, except they be bounded in by experience.  Crafty men contemn studies, simple men\nadmire them, and wise men use them; for they\nteach not their own use; but that is a wisdom without them, and above them, won by observation.\nRead not to contradict and confute; nor to believe\nand take for granted; nor to find talk and discourse; but to weigh and consider.  Some books are\nto be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few\nto be chewed and digested; that is, some books are\nto be read only in parts; others to be read, but not\ncuriously; and some few to be read wholly, and\nwith diligence and attention.  Some books also may\nbe read by deputy, and extracts made of them by\nothers; but that would be only in the less important arguments, and the meaner sort of books, else\ndistilled books are like common distilled waters,\nflashy things.  Reading maketh a full man; conference a ready man; and writing an exact man.  And\ntherefore, if a man write little, he had need have\na great memory; if he confer little, he had need\nhave a present wit: and if he read little, he had\nneed have much cunning, to seem to know, that\nhe doth not.  Histories make men wise; poets witty;\nthe mathematics subtile; natural philosophy deep;\nmoral grave; logic and rhetoric able to contend.\nAbeunt studia in mores.  Nay, there is no stond or\nimpediment in the wit, but may be wrought out\nby fit studies; like as diseases of the body, may\nhave appropriate exercises.  Bowling is good for\nthe stone and reins; shooting for the lungs and\nbreast; gentle walking for the stomach; riding for\nthe head; and the like.  So if a man’s wit be wandering, let him study the mathematics; for in\ndemonstrations, if his wit be called away never so\nlittle, he must begin again.  If his wit be not apt to\ndistinguish or find differences, let him study the\nSchoolmen; for they are cymini sectores.  If he be\nnot apt to beat over matters, and to call up one\nthing to prove and illustrate another, let him study 197\nthe lawyers’ cases.  So every defect of the mind,\nmay have a special receipt.",
        "MANY have an opinion not wise, that for a\nprince to govern his estate, or for a great\nperson to govern his proceedings, according to the\nrespect of factions, is a principal part of policy;\nwhereas contrariwise, the chiefest wisdom, is\neither in ordering those things which are general,\nand wherein men of several factions do nevertheless agree; or in dealing with correspondence to\nparticular persons, one by one.  But I say not that\nthe considerations of factions, is to be neglected.\nMean men, in their rising, must adhere; but\ngreat men, that have strength in themselves, were\nbetter to maintain themselves indifferent, and\nneutral.  Yet even in beginners, to adhere so moderately, as he be a man of the one faction, which is\nmost passable with the other, commonly giveth\nbest way.  The lower and weaker faction, is the\nfirmer in conjunction; and it is often seen, that a\nfew that are stiff, do tire out a greater number, that\nare more moderate.  When one of the factions is extinguished, the remaining subdivideth; as the\nfaction between Lucullus, and the rest of the\nnobles of the senate (which they called Optimates)\nheld out awhile, against the faction of Pompey\nand Caesar; but when the senate’s authority was\npulled down, Caesar and Pompey soon after brake.\nThe faction or party of Antonius and Octavianus\nCaesar, against Brutus and Cassius, held out likewise for a time; but when Brutus and Cassius were\noverthrown, then soon after, Antonius and Octavianus brake and subdivided.  These examples are\nof wars, but the same holdeth in private factions.\nAnd therefore, those that are seconds in factions,\ndo many times, when the faction subdivideth,\nprove principals; but many times also, they prove\nciphers and cashiered; for many a man’s strength\nis in opposition; and when that faileth, he groweth\nout of use.  It is commonly seen, that men, once\nplaced, take in with the  contrary faction, to that\nby which they enter: thinking belike, that they\nhave the first sure, and now are ready for a new\npurchase.  The traitor in faction, lightly goeth\naway with it; for when matters have stuck long in\nbalancing, the winning of some one man casteth\nthem, and he getteth all the thanks.  The even carriage between two factions, proceedeth not always\nof moderation, but of a trueness to a man’s self,\nwith end to make use of both.  Certainly in Italy,\nthey hold it a little suspect in popes, when they\nhave often in their mouth Padre commune: and\ntake it to be a sign of one, that meaneth to refer all\nto the greatness of his own house.  Kings had need\nbeware, how they side themselves, and make\nthemselves as of a faction or party; for leagues\nwithin the state, are ever pernicious to monarchies:\nfor they raise an obligation, paramount to obligation of sovereignty, and make the king tanquam\nunus ex nobis; as was to be seen in the League of\nFrance.  When factions are carried too high and too\nviolently, it is a sign of weakness in princes; and\nmuch to the prejudice, both of their authority and\nbusiness.  The motions of factions under kings\nought to be, like the motions (as the astronomers\nspeak) of the inferior orbs, which may have their\nproper motions, but yet still are quietly carried, by\nthe higher motion of primum mobile.",
        "HE THAT is only real, had need have exceeding great parts of virtue; as the stone had\nneed to be rich, that is set without foil.  But if a\nman mark it well,  it is, in praise and commendation of men, as it is in gettings and gains: for the\nproverb is true, That light gains make heavy\npurses; for light gains come thick, whereas great,\ncome but now and then.  So it is true, that small\nmatters win great commendation, because they\nare continually in use and in note: whereas the\noccasion of any great virtue, cometh but on festivals.  Therefore it doth much add to a man’s reputation, and is (as Queen Isabella said) like perpetual\nletters commendatory, to have good forms.  To attain them, it almost sufficeth not to despise them;\nfor so shall a man observe them in others; and let\nhim trust himself with the rest.  For if he labor too\nmuch to express them, he shall lose their grace;\nwhich is to be natural and unaffected.  Some men’s\nbehavior is like a verse, wherein every syllable is\nmeasured; how can a man comprehend great matters, that breaketh his mind too much, to small\nobservations? Not to use ceremonies at all, is to\nteach others not to use them again; and so diminisheth respect to himself; especially they be not to\nbe omitted, to strangers and formal natures; but\nthe dwelling upon them, and exalting them above\nthe moon, is not only tedious, but doth diminish\nthe faith and credit of him that speaks.  And certainly, there is a kind of conveying, of effectual\nand imprinting passages amongst compliments,\nwhich is of singular use, if a man can hit upon it.\nAmongst a man’s peers, a man shall be sure of\nfamiliarity; and therefore it is good, a little to keep\nstate.  Amongst a man’s inferiors one shall be sure\nof reverence; and therefore it is good, a little to be\nfamiliar.  He that is too much in anything, so that\nhe giveth another occasion of satiety, maketh himself cheap.  To apply one’s self to others, is good; so\nit be with demonstration, that a man doth it upon\nregard, and not upon facility.  It is a good precept\ngenerally, in seconding another, yet to add somewhat of one’s own: as if you will grant his opinion,\nlet it be with some distinction; if you will follow\nhis motion, let it be with condition; if you allow\nhis counsel, let it be with alleging further reason.\nMen had need beware, how they be too perfect in\ncompliments; for be they never so sufficient otherwise, their enviers will be sure to give them that\nattribute, to the disadvantage of their greater virtues.  It is loss also in business, to be too full of respects, or to be curious, in observing times and\nopportunities.  Solomon saith, He that considereth\nthe wind, shall not sow, and he that looketh to\nthe clouds, shall not reap.  A wise man will make\nmore opportunities, than he finds.  Men’s behavior\nshould be, like their apparel, not too strait or point\ndevice, but free for exercise or motion.",
        "PRAISE is the reflection of virtue; but it is as\nthe glass or body, which giveth the reflection.  If it be from the common people, it is commonly false and naught; and rather followeth vain\npersons, than virtuous.  For the common people\nunderstand not many excellent virtues.  The lowest\nvirtues draw praise from them; the middle virtues\nwork in them astonishment or admiration; but of\nthe highest virtues, they have no sense of perceiving at all.  But shows, and species virtutibus similes,\nserve best with them.  Certainly fame is like a river,\nthat beareth up things light and swoln, and drowns\nthings weighty and solid.  But if persons of quality\nand judgment concur, then it is (as the Scripture\nsaith) nomen bonum instar unguenti fragrantis.\nIt fireth all round about, and will not easily away.\nFor the odors of ointments are more durable, than\nthose of flowers.  There be so many false points of\npraise, that a man may justly hold it a suspect.\nSome praises proceed merely of flattery; and if he\nbe an ordinary flatterer, he will have certain common attributes, which may serve every man; if he\nbe a cunning flatterer, he will follow the archflatterer, which is a man’s self; and wherein a man\nthinketh best of himself, therein the flatterer will\nuphold him most: but if he be an impudent flatterer, look wherein a man is conscious to himself,\nthat he is most defective, and is most out of countenance in himself, that will the flatterer entitle him\nto perforce, spreta conscientia.  Some praises come\nof good wishes and respects, which is a form due, in\ncivility, to kings and great persons, laudando\npraecipere, when by telling men what they are,\nthey represent to them, what they should be.  Some\nmen are praised maliciously, to their hurt, thereby\nto stir envy and jealousy towards them: pessimum\ngenus inimicorum laudantium; insomuch as it\nwas a proverb, amongst the Grecians, that he that\nwas praised to his hurt, should have a push rise\nupon his nose; as we say, that a blister will rise\nupon one’s tongue, that tells a lie.  Certainly moderate praise, used with opportunity, and not vulgar, is that which doth the good.  Solomon saith,\nHe that praiseth his friend aloud, rising early, it\nshall be to him no better than a curse.  Too much\nmagnifying of man or matter, doth irritate contradiction, and procure envy and scorn.  To praise\na man’s self, cannot be decent, except it be in rare\ncases; but to praise a man’s office or profession, he\nmay do it with good grace, and with a kind of magnanimity.  The cardinals of Rome, which are theologues, and friars, and Schoolmen, have a phrase\nof notable contempt and scorn towards civil business: for they call all temporal business of wars,\nembassages, judicature, and other employments,\nsbirrerie, which is under-sheriffries; as if they\nwere but matters, for under-sheriffs and catchpoles: though many times those under-sheriffries\ndo more good, than their high speculations.  St.\nPaul, when he boasts of himself, he doth oft interlace, I speak like a fool; but speaking of his calling,\nhe saith, magnificabo apostolatum meum.",
        "IT WAS prettily devised of AEsop, The fly sat\nupon the axle-tree of the chariot wheel, and\nsaid, What a dust do I raise! So are there some vain\npersons, that whatsoever goeth alone, or moveth\nupon greater means, if they have never so little\nhand in it, they think it is they that carry it.  They\nthat are glorious, must needs be factious; for all\nbravery stands upon comparisons.  They must\nneeds be violent, to make good their own vaunts.\nNeither can they be secret, and therefore not effectual; but according to the French proverb,\nBeaucoup de bruit, peu de fruit; Much bruit little\nfruit.  Yet certainly, there is use of this quality in\ncivil affairs.  Where there is an opinion and fame to\nbe created, either of virtue or greatness, these men\nare good trumpeters.  Again, as Titus Livius noteth,\nin the case of Antiochus and the AEtolians, There\nare sometimes great effects, of cross lies; as if a\nman, that negotiates between two princes, to draw\nthem to join in a war against the third, doth extol\nthe forces of either of them, above measure, the\none to the other: and sometimes he that deals between man and man, raiseth his own credit with\nboth, by pretending greater interest than he hath\nin either.  And in these and the like kinds, it often\nfalls out, that somewhat is produced of nothing;\nfor lies are sufficient to breed opinion, and opinion\nbrings on substance.  In militar commanders and\nsoldiers, vain-glory is an essential point; for as\niron sharpens iron, so by glory, one courage sharpeneth another.  In cases of great enterprise upon\ncharge and adventure, a composition of glorious\nnatures, doth put life into business; and those that\nare of solid and sober natures, have more of the\nballast, than of the sail.  In fame of learning, the\nflight will be slow without some feathers of ostentation.  Qui de contemnenda gloria libros scribunt, nomen, suum inscribunt.  Socrates, Aristotle,\nGalen, were men full of ostentation.  Certainly\nvain-glory helpeth to perpetuate a man’s memory;\nand virtue was never so beholding to human nature, as it received his due at the second hand.\nNeither had the fame of Cicero, Seneca, Plinius\nSecundus, borne her age so well, if it had not been\njoined with some vanity in themselves; like unto\nvarnish, that makes ceilings not only shine but\nlast.  But all this while, when I speak of vain-glory,\nI mean not of that property, that Tacitus doth attribute to Mucianus; Omnium quae dixerat feceratque arte quadam ostentator: for that proceeds\nnot of vanity, but of natural magnanimity and\ndiscretion; and in some persons, is not only comely,\nbut gracious.  For excusations, cessions, modesty\nitself well governed, are but arts of ostentation.\nAnd amongst those arts, there is none better than\nthat which Plinius Secundus speaketh of, which is\nto be liberal of praise and commendation to others,\nin that, wherein a man’s self hath any perfection.\nFor saith Pliny, very wittily, In commending\nanother, you do yourself right; for he that you\ncommend, is either superior to you in that you\ncommend, or inferior.  If he be inferior, if he be to\nbe commended, you much more; if he be superior,\nif he be not to be commended, you much less.\nGlorious men are the scorn of wise men, the admiration of fools, the idols of parasites, and the\nslaves of their own vaunts.",
        "THE winning of honor, is but the revealing of\na man,s virtue and worth, without disadvantage.  For some in their actions, do woo and effect\nhonor and reputation, which sort of men, are\ncommonly much talked of, but inwardly little\nadmired.  And some, contrariwise, darken their\nvirtue in the show of it; so as they be undervalued\nin opinion.  If a man perform that, which hath not\nbeen attempted before; or attempted and given\nover; or hath been achieved, but not with so good\ncircumstance; he shall purchase more honor, than\nby effecting a matter of greater difficulty or virtue,\nwherein he is but a follower.  If a man so temper\nhis actions, as in some one of them he doth content\nevery faction, or combination of people, the music\nwill be the fuller.  A man is an ill husband of bis\nhonor, that entereth into any action, the failing\nwherein may disgrace him, more than the carrying of it through, can honor him.  Honor that is\ngained and broken upon another, hath the quickest reflection, like diamonds cut with facets.  And\ntherefore, let a man contend to excel any competitors of his in honor, in outshooting them, if he can,\nin their own bow.  Discreet followers and servants,\nhelp much to reputation.  Omnis fama a domesticis\nemanat.  Envy, which is the canker of honor, is\nbest extinguished by declaring a man’s self in\nhis ends, rather to seek merit than fame; and by\nattributing a man’s successes, rather to divine\nProvidence and felicity, than to his own virtue or\npolicy.",
        "The true marshalling of the degrees of sovereign\nhonor, are these: In the first place are conditores\nimperiorum, founders of states and commonwealths; such as were Romulus, Cyrus, Caesar,\nOttoman, Ismael.  In the second place are legislatores, lawgivers; which are also called second\nfounders, or perpetui principes, because they govern by their ordinances after they are gone; such\nwere Lycurgus, Solon, Justinian, Eadgar, Alphonsus of Castile, the Wise, that made the Siete Partidas.  In the third place are liberatores, or salvatores,\nsuch as compound the long miseries of civil\nwars, or deliver their countries from servitude of\nstrangers or tyrants; as Augustus Caesar, Vespasianus, Aurelianus, Theodoricus, King Henry the\nSeventh of England, King Henry the Fourth of\nFrance.  In the fourth place are propagatores or\npropugnatores imperii; such as in honorable wars\nenlarge their territories, or make noble defence\nagainst invaders.  And in the last place are patres\npatriae; which reign justly, and make the times\ngood wherein they live.  Both which last kinds need\nno examples, they are in such number.  Degrees of\nhonor, in subjects, are, first participes curarum,\nthose upon whom, princes do discharge the greatest weight of their affairs; their right hands, as\nwe call them.  The next are duces belli, great leaders\nin war; such as are princes’ lieutenants, and do\nthem notable services in the wars.  The third are\ngratiosi, favorites; such as exceed not this scantling, to be solace to the sovereign, and harmless to\nthe people.  And the fourth, negotiis pares; such as\nhave great places under princes, and execute their\nplaces, with sufficiency.  There is an honor, likewise, which may be ranked amongst the greatest,\nwhich happeneth rarely; that is, of such as sacrifice themselves to death or danger for the good of\ntheir country; as was M. Regulus, and the two\nDecii.",
        "JUDGES ought to remember, that their office is\njus dicere, and not jus dare; to interpret law,\nand not to make law, or give law.  Else will it be\nlike the authority, claimed by the Church of Rome,\nwhich under pretext of exposition of Scripture,\ndoth not stick to add and alter; and to pronounce\nthat which they do not find; and by show of antiquity, to introduce novelty.  Judges ought to be\nmore learned, than witty, more reverend, than\nplausible,and more advised, than confident.  Above\nall things, integrity is their portion and proper\nvirtue.  Cursed (saith the law) is he that removeth\nthe landmark.  The mislayer of a mere-stone is to\nblame.  But it is the unjust judge, that is the capital\nremover of landmarks, when he defineth amiss, of\nlands and property.  One foul sentence doth more\nhurt, than many foul examples.  For these do but\ncorrupt the stream, the other corrupteth the fountain.  So with Solomon, Fons turbatus, et vena\ncorrupta, est justus cadens in causa sua coram\nadversario.  The office of judges may have reference\nunto the parties that use, unto the advocates that\nplead, unto the clerks and ministers of justice\nunderneath them, and to the sovereign or state\nabove them.",
        "First, for the causes or parties that sue.  There be\n(saith the Scripture) that turn judgment, into\nwormwood; and surely there be also, that turn it\ninto vinegar; for injustice maketh it bitter, and\ndelays make it sour.  The principal duty of a judge,\nis to suppress force and fraud; whereof force is the\nmore pernicious, when it is open, and fraud, when\nit is close and disguised.  Add thereto contentious\nsuits, which ought to be spewed out, as the surfeit\nof courts.  A judge ought to prepare his way to a\njust sentence, as God useth to prepare his way, by\nraising valleys and taking down hills: so when\nthere appeareth on either side an high hand, violent prosecution, cunning advantages taken, combination, power, great counsel, then is the virtue\nof a judge seen, to make inequality equal; that he\nmay plant his judgment as upon an even ground.\nQui fortiter emungit, elicit sanguinem; and where\nthe wine-press is hard wrought, it yields a harsh\nwine, that tastes of the grape-stone.  Judges must\nbeware of hard constructions, and strained inferences; for there is no worse torture, than the torture of laws.  Specially in case of laws penal, they\nought to have care, that that which was meant for\nterror, be not turned into rigor; and that they\nbring not upon the people, that shower whereof\nthe Scripture speaketh, Pluet super eos laqueos;\nfor penal laws pressed, are a shower of snares upon\nthe people.  Therefore let penal laws, if they have\nbeen sleepers of long, or if they be grown unfit for\nthe present time, be by wise judges confined in the\nexecution: Judicis officium est, ut res, ita tempora\nrerum, etc.  In causes of life and death, judges ought\n(as far as the law permitteth) in justice to remember mercy; and to cast a severe eye upon the\nexample, but a merciful eye upon the person.",
        "Secondly, for the advocates and counsel that\nplead.  Patience and gravity of hearing, is an essential part of justice; and an overspeaking judge is no\nwell-tuned cymbal.  It is no grace to a judge, first\nto find that, which he might have heard in due\ntime from the bar; or to show quickness of conceit,\nin cutting off evidence or counsel too short; or to\nprevent information by questions, though pertinent.  The parts of a judge in hearing, are four: to\ndirect the evidence; to moderate length, repetition,\nor impertinency of speech; to recapitulate, select,\nand collate the material points, of that which hath\nbeen said; and to give the rule or sentence.  Whatsoever is above these is too much; and proceedeth\neither of glory, and willingness to speak, or of impatience to hear, or of shortness of memory, or of\nwant of a staid and equal attention.  It is a strange\nthing to see, that the boldness of advocates should\nprevail with judges; whereas they should imitate\nGod, in whose seat they sit; who represseth the presumptuous, and giveth grace to the modest.  But it\nis more strange, that judges should have noted\nfavorites; which cannot but cause multiplication\nof fees, and suspicion of by-ways.  There is due from\nthe judge to the advocate, some commendation\nand gracing, where causes are well handled and\nfair pleaded; especially towards the side which\nobtaineth not; for that upholds in the client, the\nreputation of his counsel, and beats down in him\nthe conceit of his cause.  There is likewise due to the\npublic, a civil reprehension of advocates, where\nthere appeareth cunning counsel, gross neglect,\nslight information, indiscreet pressing, or an overbold defence.  And let not the counsel at the bar,\nchop with the judge, nor wind himself into the\nhandling of the cause anew, after the judge hath\ndeclared his sentence; but, on the other side, let\nnot the judge meet the cause half way, nor give\noccasion to the party, to say his counsel or proofs\nwere not heard.",
        "Thirdly, for that that concerns clerks and ministers.  The place of justice is an hallowed place; and\ntherefore not only the bench, but the foot-place;\nand precincts and purprise thereof, ought to be\npreserved without scandal and corruption.  For\ncertainly grapes (as the Scripture saith) will not\nbe gathered of thorns or thistles; either can justice\nyield her fruit with sweetness, amongst the briars\nand brambles of catching and polling clerks, and\nministers.  The attendance of courts, is subject to\nfour bad instruments.  First, certain persons that\nare sowers of suits; which make the court swell,\nand the country pine.  The second sort is of those,\nthat engage courts in quarrels of jurisdiction, and\nare not truly amici curiae, but parasiti curiae, in\npuffing a court up beyond her bounds, for their\nown scraps and advantage.  The third sort, is of\nthose that may be accounted the left hands of\ncourts; persons that are full of nimble and sinister\ntricks and shifts, whereby they pervert the plain\nand direct courses of courts, and bring justice into\noblique lines and labyrinths.  And the fourth, is the\npoller and exacter of fees; which justifies the common resemblance of the courts of justice, to the\nbush whereunto, while the sheep flies for defence\nin weather, he is sure to lose part of his fleece.  On\nthe other side, an ancient clerk, skilful in precedents, wary in proceeding, and understanding in\nthe business of the court, is an excellent finger of\na court; and doth many times point the way to the\njudge himself.",
        "Fourthly, for that which may concern the sovereign and estate.  Judges ought above all to remember the conclusion of the Roman Twelve\nTables; Salus populi suprema lex; and to know\nthat laws, except they be in order to that end, are\nbut things captious, and oracles not well inspired.\nTherefore it is an happy thing in a state, when\nkings and states do often consult with judges; and\nagain, when judges do often consult with the king\nand state: the one, when there is matter of law,\nintervenient in business of state; the other, when\nthere is some consideration of state, intervenient\nin matter of law.  For many times the things deduced to judgment may be meum and tuum, when\nthe reason and consequence thereof may trench to\npoint of estate: I call matter of estate, not only the\nparts of sovereignty, but whatsoever introduceth\nany great alteration, or dangerous precedent; or\nconcerneth manifestly any great portion of people.  And let no man weakly conceive, that just\nlaws and true policy have any antipathy; for they\nare like the spirits and sinews, that one moves with\nthe other.  Let judges also remember, that Solomon’s throne was supported by lions on both sides:\nlet them be lions, but yet lions under the throne;\nbeing circumspect that they do not check or oppose\nany points of sovereignty.  Let not judges also be\nignorant of their own right, as to think there is not\nleft to them, as a principal part of their office, a\nwise use and application of laws.  For they may\nremember, what the apostle saith of a greater law\nthan theirs; Nos scimus quia lex bona est, modo\nquis ea utatur legitime.",
        "TO SEEK to extinguish anger utterly, is but a\nbravery of the Stoics.  We have better oracles:\nBe angry, but sin not.  Let not the sun go down\nupon your anger.  Anger must be limited and confined, both in race and in time.  We will first speak\nhow the natural inclination and habit to be angry,\nmay be attempted and calmed.  Secondly, how the\nparticular motions of anger may be repressed, or\nat least refrained from doing mischief.  Thirdly,\nhow to raise anger, or appease anger in another.",
        "For the first; there is no other way but to meditate, and ruminate well upon the effects of anger,\nhow it troubles man’s life.  And the best time to do\nthis, is to look back upon anger, when the fit is\nthoroughly over.  Seneca saith well, That anger is\nlike ruin, which breaks itself upon that it falls.\nThe Scripture exhorteth us to possess our souls in\npatience.  Whosoever is out of patience, is out of\npossession of his soul.  Men must not turn bees;",
        "...  animasque in vulnere ponunt.",
        "Anger is certainly a kind of baseness; as it appears well in the weakness of those subjects in\nwhom it reigns; children, women, old folks, sick\nfolks.  Only men must beware, that they carry\ntheir anger rather with scorn, than with fear; so\nthat they may seem rather to be above the injury,\nthan below it; which is a thing easily done, if a\nman will give law to himself in it.",
        "For the second point; the causes and motives of\nanger, are chiefly three.  First, to be too sensible of\nhurt; for no man is angry, that feels not himself\nhurt; and therefore tender and delicate persons\nmust needs be oft angry; they have so many things\nto trouble them, which more robust natures have\nlittle sense of.  The next is, the apprehension and\nconstruction of the injury offered, to be, in the circumstances thereof, full of contempt: for contempt\nis that, which putteth an edge upon anger, as much\nor more than the hurt itself.  And therefore, when\nmen are ingenious in picking out circumstances of\ncontempt, they do kindle their anger much.  Lastly,\nopinion of the touch of a man’s reputation, doth\nmultiply and sharpen anger.  Wherein the remedy\nis, that a man should have, as Consalvo was wont\nto say, telam honoris crassiorem.  But in all refrainings of anger, it is the best remedy to win time;\nand to make a man’s self believe, that the opportunity of his revenge is not yet come, but that he\nforesees a time for it; and so to still himself in the\nmeantime, and reserve it.",
        "To contain anger from mischief, though it take\nhold of a man, there be two things, whereof you\nmust have special caution.  The one, of extreme bitterness of words, especially if they be aculeate and\nproper; for cummunia maledicta are nothing so\nmuch; and again, that in anger a man reveal no\nsecrets; for that, makes him not fit for society.  The\nother, that you do not peremptorily break off, in\nany business, in a fit of anger; but howsoever you\nshow bitterness, do not act anything, that is not\nrevocable.",
        "For raising and appeasing anger in another; it\nis done chiefly by choosing of times, when men\nare frowardest and worst disposed, to incense\nthem.  Again, by gathering (as was touched before)\nall that you can find out, to aggravate the contempt.  And the two remedies are by the contraries.\nThe former to take good times, when first to relate\nto a man an angry business; for the first impression is much; and the other is, to sever, as much as\nmay be, the construction of the injury from the\npoint of contempt; imputing it to misunderstanding, fear, passion, or what you will.",
        "SOLOMON saith, There is no new thing upon\nthe earth.  So that as Plato had an imagination,\nThat all knowledge was but remembrance; so\nSolomon giveth his sentence, That all novelty is\nbut oblivion.  Whereby you may see, that the river\nof Lethe runneth as well above ground as below.\nThere is an abstruse astrologer that saith, If it were\nnot for two things that are constant (the one is,\nthat the fixed stars ever stand a like distance one\nfrom another, and never come nearer together, nor\ngo further asunder; the other, that the diurnal\nmotion perpetually keepeth time), no individual\nwould last one moment.  Certain it is, that the matter is in a perpetual flux, and never at a stay.  The\ngreat winding-sheets, that bury all things in oblivion, are two; deluges and earthquakes.  As for\nconflagrations and great droughts, they do not\nmerely dispeople and destroy.  Phaeton’s car went\nbut a day.  And the three years’ drought in the time\nof Elias, was but particular, and left people alive.\nAs for the great burnings by lightnings, which are\noften in the West Indies, they are but narrow.  But\nin the other two destructions, by deluge and earthquake, it is further to be noted, that the remnant\nof people which hap to be reserved, are commonly\nignorant and mountainous people, that can give\nno account of the time past; so that the oblivion is\nall one, as if none had been left.  If you consider\nwell of the people of the West Indies, it is very\nprobable that they are a newer or a younger people, than the people of the Old World.  And it is\nmuch more likely, that the destruction that hath\nheretofore been there, was not by earthquakes (as\nthe Egyptian priest told Solon concerning the\nisland of Atlantis, that it was swallowed by an\nearthquake), but rather that it was desolated by a\nparticular deluge.  For earthquakes are seldom in\nthose parts.  But on the other side, they have such\npouring rivers, as the rivers of Asia and Africk and\nEurope, are but brooks to them.  Their Andes, likewise, or mountains, are far higher than those with\nus; whereby it seems, that the remnants of generation of men, were in such a particular deluge\nsaved.  As for the observation that Machiavel hath,\nthat the jealousy of sects, doth much extinguish\nthe memory of things; traducing Gregory the\nGreat, that he did what in him lay, to extinguish\nall heathen antiquities; I do not find that those\nzeals do any great effects, nor last long; as it appeared in the succession of Sabinian, who did\nrevive the former antiquities.",
        "The vicissitude of mutations in the superior\nglobe, are no fit matter for this present argument.\nIt may be, Plato’s great year, if the world should\nlast so long, would have some effect; not in renewing the state of like individuals (for that is the fume\nof those, that conceive the celestial bodies have\nmore accurate influences upon these things below,\nthan indeed they have), but in gross.  Comets, out\nof question, have likewise power and effect, over\nthe gross and mass of things; but they are rather\ngazed upon, and waited upon in their journey,\nthan wisely observed in their effects; specially in,\ntheir respective effects; that is, what kind of comet,\nfor magnitude, color, version of the beams, placing in the reign of heaven, or lasting, produceth\nwhat kind of effects.",
        "There is a toy which I have heard, and I would\nnot have it given over, but waited upon a little.\nThey say it is observed in the Low Countries (I\nknow not in what part) that every five and thirty\nyears, the same kind and suit of years and weathers come about again; as great frosts, great wet,\ngreat droughts, warm winters, summers with little\nheat, and the like; and they call it the Prime.  It is\na thing I do the rather mention, because, computing backwards, I have found some concurrence.",
        "But to leave these points of nature, and to come\nto men.  The greatest vicissitude of things amongst\nmen, is the vicissitude of sects and religions.  For\nthose orbs rule in men’s minds most.  The true religion is built upon the rock; the rest are tossed,\nupon the waves of time.  To speak, therefore, of the\ncauses of new sects; and to give some counsel concerning them, as far as the weakness of human\njudgment can give stay, to so great revolutions.\nWhen the religion formerly received, is rent by\ndiscords; and when the holiness of the professors\nof religion, is decayed and full of scandal; and\nwithal the times be stupid, ignorant, and barbarous; you may doubt the springing up of a new\nsect; if then also, there should arise any extravagant and strange spirit, to make himself author\nthereof.  All which points held, when Mahomet\npublished his law.  If a new sect have not two properties, fear it not; for it will not spread.  The one is\nthe supplanting, or the opposing, of authority established; for nothing is more popular than that.\nThe other is the giving license to pleasures, and a\nvoluptuous life.  For as for speculative heresies\n(such as were in ancient times the Arians, and now\nthe Armenians), though they work mightily upon\nmen’s wits, yet they do not produce any great alterations in states; except it be by the help of civil\noccasions.  There be three manner of plantations of\nnew sects.  By the power of signs and miracles; by\nthe eloquence, and wisdom, of speech and persuasion; and by the sword.  For martyrdoms, I reckon\nthem amongst miracles; because they seem to exceed the strength of human nature: and I may do\nthe like, of superlative and admirable holiness of\nlife.  Surely there is no better way, to stop the rising\nof new sects and schisms, than to reform abuses; to\ncompound the smaller differences; to proceed\nmildly, and not with sanguinary persecutions;\nand rather to take off the principal authors by winning and advancing them, than to enrage them\nby violence and bitterness.",
        "The changes and vicissitude in wars are many;\nbut chiefly in three things; in the seats or stages of\nthe war; in the weapons; and in the manner of the\nconduct.  Wars, in ancient time, seemed more to\nmove from east to west; for the Persians, Assyrians,\nArabians, Tartars (which were the invaders) were\nall eastern people.  It is true, the Gauls were western; but we read but of two incursions of theirs:\nthe one to Gallo-Grecia, the other to Rome.  But east\nand west have no certain points of heaven; and no\nmore have the wars, either from the east or west,\nany certainty of observation.  But north and south\nare fixed; and it hath seldom or never been seen\nthat the far southern people have invaded the\nnorthern, but contrariwise.  Whereby it is manifest\nthat the northern tract of the world, is in nature\nthe more martial region: be it in respect of the stars\nof that hemisphere; or of the great continents that\nare upon the north, whereas the south part, for\naught that is known, is almost all sea; or (which is\nmost apparent) of the cold of the northern parts,\nwhich is that which, without aid of discipline,\ndoth make the bodies hardest, and the courages\nwarmest.",
        "Upon the breaking and shivering of a great state\nand empire, you may be sure to have wars.  For\ngreat empires, while they stand, do enervate and\ndestroy the forces of the natives which they have\nsubdued, resting upon their own protecting forces;\nand then when they fail also, all goes to ruin, and\nthey become a prey.  So was it in the decay of the\nRoman empire; and likewise in the empire of\nAlmaigne, after Charles the Great, every bird taking a feather; and were not unlike to befall to\nSpain, if it should break.  The great accessions and\nunions of kingdoms, do likewise stir up wars; for\nwhen a state grows to an over-power, it is like a\ngreat flood, that will be sure to overflow.  As it hath\nbeen seen in the states of Rome, Turkey, Spain,\nand others.  Look when the world hath fewest barbarous peoples, but such as commonly will not\nmarry or generate, except they know means to live\n(as it is almost everywhere at this day, except Tartary), there is no danger of inundations of people;\nbut when there be great shoals of people, which go\non to populate, without foreseeing means of life\nand sustentation, it is of necessity that once in an\nage or two, they discharge a portion of their people\nupon other nations; which the ancient northern\npeople were wont to do by lot; casting lots what\npart should stay at home, and what should seek\ntheir fortunes.  When a warlike state grows soft and\neffeminate, they may be sure of a war.  For commonly such states are grownm rich in the time of\ntheir degenerating; and so the prey inviteth, and\ntheir decay in valor, encourageth a war.",
        "As for the weapons, it hardly falleth under rule\nand observation: yet we see even they, have returns and vicissitudes.  For certain it is, that ordnance was known in the city of the Oxidrakes in\nIndia; and was that, which the Macedonians\ncalled thunder and lightning, and magic.  And it\nis well known that the use of ordnance, hath been\nin China above two thousand years.  The conditions\nof weapons, and their improvement, are; First, the\nfetching afar off; for that outruns the danger; as\nit is seen in ordnance and muskets.  Secondly, the\nstrength of the percussion; wherein likewise ordnance do exceed all arietations and ancient inventions.  The third is, the commodious use of them; as\nthat they may serve in all weathers; that the carriage may be light and manageable; and the like.",
        "For the conduct of the war: at the first, men\nrested extremely upon number: they did put the\nwars likewise upon main force and valor; pointing\ndays for pitched fields, and so trying it out upon\nan even match and they were more ignorant in\nranging and arraying their battles.  After, they\ngrew to rest upon number rather competent, than\nvast; they grew to advantages of place, cunning\ndiversions, and the like: and they grew more skilful in the ordering of their battles.",
        "In the youth of a state, arms do flourish; in the\nmiddle age of a state, learning; and then both of\nthem together for a time; in the declining age of a\nstate, mechanical arts and merchandize.  Learning\nhath his infancy, when it is but beginning and\nalmost childish; then his youth, when it is luxuriant and juvenile; then his strength of years, when\nit is solid and reduced; and lastly, his old age, when\nit waxeth dry and exhaust.  But it is not good to look\ntoo long upon these turning wheels of vicissitude,\nlest we become giddy.  As for the philology of\nthem, that is but a circle of tales, and therefore not\nfit for this writing.",
        "THE poets make Fame a monster.  They describe her in part finely and elegantly, and\nin part gravely and sententiously.  They say, look\nhow many feathers she hath, so many eyes she\nhath underneath; so many tongues; so many\nvoices; she pricks up so many ears.",
        "This is a flourish.  There follow excellent parables; as that, she gathereth strength in going;\nthat she goeth upon the ground, and yet hideth her\nhead in the clouds; that in the daytime she sitteth\nin a watch tower, and flieth most by night; that\nshe mingleth things done, with things not done;\nand that she is a terror to great cities.  But that\nwhich passeth all the rest is: They do recount that\nthe Earth, mother of the giants that made war\nagainst Jupiter, and were by him destroyed, thereupon in an anger brought forth Fame.  For certain\nit is, that rebels, figured by the giants, and seditious\nfames and libels, are but brothers and sisters, masculine and feminine.  But now, if a man can tame\nthis monster, and bring her to feed at the hand,\nand govern her, and with her fly other ravening\nfowl and kill them, it is somewhat worth.  But we\nare infected with the style of the poets.  To speak\nnow in a sad and serious manner: There is not, in\nall the politics, a place less handled and more\nworthy to be handled, than this of fame.  We will\ntherefore speak of these points: What are false\nfames; and what are true fames; and how they\nmay be best discerned; how fames may be sown,\nand raised; how they may be spread, and multiplied; and how they may be checked, and laid\ndead.  And other things concerning the nature of\nfame.  Fame is of that force, as there is scarcely any\ngreat action, wherein it hath not a great part; especially in the war.  Mucianus undid Vitellius, by\na fame that he scattered, that Vitellius had in purpose to remove the legions of Syria into Germany,\nand the legions of Germany into Syria; whereupon the legions of Syria were infinitely inflamed.\nJulius Caesar took Pompey unprovided, and laid\nasleep his industry and preparations, by a fame\nthat he cunningly gave out: Caesar’s own soldiers\nloved him not, and being wearied with the wars,\nand laden with the spoils of Gaul, would forsake\nhim, as soon as he came into Italy.  Livia settled\nall things for the succession of her son Tiberius, by\ncontinual giving out, that her husband Augustus\nwas upon recovery and amendment, and it is an\nusual thing with the pashas, to conceal the death\nof the Great Turk from the janizaries and men of\nwar, to save the sacking of Constantinople and\nother towns, as their manner is.  Themistocles made\nXerxes, king of Persia, post apace out of Grecia, by\ngiving out, that the Grecians had a purpose to\nbreak his bridge of ships, which he had made athwart Hellespont.  There be a thousand such like\nexamples; and the more they are, the less they\nneed to be repeated; because a man meeteth with\nthem everywhere.  Therefore let all wise governors\nhave as great a watch and care over fames, as they\nhave of the actions and designs themselves.",
