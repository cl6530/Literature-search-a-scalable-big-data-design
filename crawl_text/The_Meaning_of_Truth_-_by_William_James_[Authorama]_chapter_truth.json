        "THE pivotal part of my book named Pragmatism is its account of the\nrelation called ’truth’ which may obtain between an idea\n(opinion, belief, statement, or what not) and its object. ’Truth,’ I\nthere say, ’is a property of certain of our ideas. It means their\nagreement, as falsity means their disagreement, with\nreality. Pragmatists and intellectualists both accept this\ndefinition as a matter of course.",
        "’Where our ideas [do] not copy definitely their object, what does\nagreement with that object mean? ... Pragmatism asks its\nusual question. “Grant an idea or belief to be true,” it says, “what\nconcrete difference will its being true make in any one’s actual\nlife? What experiences [may] be different from those which would\nobtain if the belief were false? How will the truth be realized?\nWhat, in short, is the truth’s cash-value in experiential\nterms?” The moment pragmatism asks this question, it sees the\nanswer: TRUE IDEAS ARE THOSE THAT WE CAN ASSIMILATE, VALIDATE,\nCORROBORATE, AND VERIFY. FALSE IDEAS ARE THOSE THAT WE CANNOT. That\nis the practical difference it makes to us to have true ideas; that\ntherefore is the meaning of truth, for it is all that truth is known\nas.",
        "’The truth of an idea is not a stagnant property inherent in it.\nTruth HAPPENS to an idea. It BECOMES true, is MADE true by events.\nIts verity IS in fact an event, a process, the process namely of its\nverifying itself, its veriFICATION. Its validity is the process of\nits validATION. [Footnote: But ’VERIFIABILITY,’ I add, ’is as good\nas verification. For one truth-process completed, there are a\nmillion in our lives that function in [the] state of nascency. They\nlead us towards direct verification; lead us into the surroundings\nof the object they envisage; and then, if everything, runs on\nharmoniously, we are so sure that verification is possible that we\nomit it, and are usually justified by all that happens.’]",
        "’To agree in the widest sense with a reality can only mean to be\nguided either straight up to it or into its surroundings, or to be\nput into such working touch with it as to handle either it or\nsomething connected with it better than if we disagreed. Better\neither intellectually or practically .... Any idea that helps us\nto deal, whether practically or intellectually, with either the\nreality or its belongings, that doesn’t entangle our progress in\nfrustrations, that FITS, in fact, and adapts our life to the\nreality’s whole setting, will agree sufficiently to meet\nthe requirement. It will be true of that reality.",
        "’THE TRUE, to put it very briefly, IS ONLY THE EXPEDIENT IN THE WAY\nOF OUR THINKING, JUST AS THE RIGHT IS ONLY THE EXPEDIENT IN THE WAY\nOF OUR BEHAVING. Expedient in almost any fashion, and expedient in\nthe long run and on the whole, of course; for what meets expediently\nall the experience in sight won’t necessarily meet all farther\nexperiences equally satisfactorily. Experience, as we know, has ways\nof BOILING OVER, and making us correct our present formulas.’",
        "This account of truth, following upon the similar ones given by\nMessrs. Dewey and Schiller, has occasioned the liveliest\ndiscussion. Few critics have defended it, most of them have scouted\nit. It seems evident that the subject is a hard one to understand,\nunder its apparent simplicity; and evident also, I think, that\nthe definitive settlement of it will mark a turning-point in the\nhistory of epistemology, and consequently in that of general\nphilosophy. In order to make my own thought more accessible to those\nwho hereafter may have to study the question, I have collected in\nthe volume that follows all the work of my pen that bears directly\non the truth-question. My first statement was in 1884, in the\narticle that begins the present volume. The other papers follow in\nthe order of their publication. Two or three appear now for the\nfirst time.",
        "One of the accusations which I oftenest have had to meet is that of\nmaking the truth of our religious beliefs consist in their ’feeling\ngood’ to us, and in nothing else. I regret to have given some excuse\nfor this charge, by the unguarded language in which, in the book\nPragmatism, I spoke of the truth of the belief of certain\nphilosophers in the absolute. Explaining why I do not believe in the\nabsolute myself (p. 78), yet finding that it may secure ’moral\nholidays’ to those who need them, and is true in so far forth (if to\ngain moral holidays be a good), [Footnote: Op. cit., p. 75.] I\noffered this as a conciliatory olive-branch to my enemies. But they,\nas is only too common with such offerings, trampled the gift under\nfoot and turned and rent the giver. I had counted too much on their\ngood will–oh for the rarity of Christian charity under the sun! Oh\nfor the rarity of ordinary secular intelligence also! I had supposed\nit to be matter of common observation that, of two competing views\nof the universe which in all other respects are equal, but of which\nthe first denies some vital human need while the second satisfies\nit, the second will be favored by sane men for the simple reason\nthat it makes the world seem more rational. To choose the first view\nunder such circumstances would be an ascetic act, an act of\nphilosophic self-denial of which no normal human being would be\nguilty. Using the pragmatic test of the meaning of concepts, I had\nshown the concept of the absolute to MEAN nothing but the\nholiday giver, the banisher of cosmic fear. One’s objective\ndeliverance, when one says ’the absolute exists,’ amounted, on my\nshowing, just to this, that ’some justification of a feeling\nof security in presence of the universe,’ exists, and that\nsystematically to refuse to cultivate a feeling of security would be\nto do violence to a tendency in one’s emotional life which\nmight well be respected as prophetic.",
        "Apparently my absolutist critics fail to see the workings of their\nown minds in any such picture, so all that I can do is to apologize,\nand take my offering back. The absolute is true in NO way then, and\nleast of all, by the verdict of the critics, in the way which I\nassigned!",
        "My treatment of ’God,’ ’freedom,’ and ’design’ was similar.\nReducing, by the pragmatic test, the meaning of each of these\nconcepts to its positive experienceable operation, I showed them all\nto mean the same thing, viz., the presence of ’promise’ in the\nworld. ’God or no God?’ means ’promise or no promise?’ It seems to\nme that the alternative is objective enough, being a question as to\nwhether the cosmos has one character or another, even though our own\nprovisional answer be made on subjective grounds. Nevertheless\nchristian and non-christian critics alike accuse me of summoning\npeople to say ’God exists,’ EVEN WHEN HE DOESN’T EXIST, because\nforsooth in my philosophy the ’truth’ of the saying doesn’t\nreally mean that he exists in any shape whatever, but only that to\nsay so feels good.",
        "Most of the pragmatist and anti-pragmatist warfare is over what the\nword ’truth’ shall be held to signify, and not over any of the\nfacts embodied in truth-situations; for both pragmatists and anti-\npragmatists believe in existent objects, just as they believe in our\nideas of them. The difference is that when the pragmatists speak of\ntruth, they mean exclusively some thing about the ideas, namely\ntheir workableness; whereas when anti-pragmatists speak of truth\nthey seem most often to mean something about the objects. Since the\npragmatist, if he agrees that an idea is ’really’ true, also\nagrees to whatever it says about its object; and since most anti-\npragmatists have already come round to agreeing that, if the object\nexists, the idea that it does so is workable; there would seem so\nlittle left to fight about that I might well be asked why instead of\nreprinting my share in so much verbal wrangling, I do not show my\nsense of ’values’ by burning it all up.",
        "I understand the question and I will give my answer. I am interested\nin another doctrine in philosophy to which I give the name of\nradical empiricism, and it seems to me that the establishment of the\npragmatist theory of truth is a step of first-rate importance in\nmaking radical empiricism prevail. Radical empiricism consists first\nof a postulate, next of a statement of fact, and finally of a\ngeneralized conclusion.",
        "The postulate is that the only things that shall be debatable among\nphilosophers shall be things definable in terms drawn from\nexperience. [Things of an unexperienceable nature may exist ad\nlibitum, but they form no part of the material for philosophic\ndebate.]",
        "The statement of fact is that the relations between things,\nconjunctive as well as disjunctive, are just as much matters of\ndirect particular experience, neither more so nor less so, than the\nthings themselves.",
        "The generalized conclusion is that therefore the parts of experience\nhold together from next to next by relations that are themselves\nparts of experience. The directly apprehended universe needs, in\nshort, no extraneous trans-empirical connective support, but\npossesses in its own right a concatenated or continuous structure.",
        "The great obstacle to radical empiricism in the contemporary mind is\nthe rooted rationalist belief that experience as immediately given\nis all disjunction and no conjunction, and that to make one world\nout of this separateness, a higher unifying agency must be there.\nIn the prevalent idealism this agency is represented as the absolute\nall-witness which ’relates’ things together by throwing\n’categories’ over them like a net. The most peculiar and unique,\nperhaps, of all these categories is supposed to be the truth-\nrelation, which connects parts of reality in pairs, making of one of\nthem a knower, and of the other a thing known, yet which is itself\ncontentless experientially, neither describable, explicable, nor\nreduceable to lower terms, and denotable only by uttering the name\n’truth.’",
        "The pragmatist view, on the contrary, of the truth-relation is that\nit has a definite content, and that everything in it is\nexperienceable. Its whole nature can be told in positive terms. The\n’workableness’ which ideas must have, in order to be true, means\nparticular workings, physical or intellectual, actual or\npossible, which they may set up from next to next inside of concrete\nexperience. Were this pragmatic contention admitted, one great point\nin the victory of radical empiricism would also be scored, for the\nrelation between an object and the idea that truly knows it, is held\nby rationalists to be nothing of this describable sort, but to stand\noutside of all possible temporal experience; and on the relation,\nso interpreted, rationalism is wonted to make its last most obdurate\nrally.",
        "Now the anti-pragmatist contentions which I try to meet in this\nvolume can be so easily used by rationalists as weapons of\nresistance, not only to pragmatism but to radical empiricism also\n(for if the truth-relation were transcendent, others might be so\ntoo), that I feel strongly the strategical importance of having\nthem definitely met and got out of the way. What our critics most\npersistently keep saying is that though workings go with truth, yet\nthey do not constitute it. It is numerically additional to them,\nprior to them, explanatory OF them, and in no wise to be explained\nBY them, we are incessantly told. The first point for our enemies to\nestablish, therefore, is that SOMETHING numerically additional and\nprior to the workings is involved in the truth of an idea. Since the\nOBJECT is additional, and usually prior, most rationalists plead IT,\nand boldly accuse us of denying it. This leaves on the bystanders\nthe impression–since we cannot reasonably deny the existence of the\nobject–that our account of truth breaks down, and that our critics\nhave driven us from the field. Altho in various places in this\nvolume I try to refute the slanderous charge that we deny real\nexistence, I will say here again, for the sake of emphasis, that\nthe existence of the object, whenever the idea asserts it ’truly,’\nis the only reason, in innumerable cases, why the idea does work\nsuccessfully, if it work at all; and that it seems an abuse\nof language, to say the least, to transfer the word ’truth’ from the\nidea to the object’s existence, when the falsehood of ideas that\nwon’t work is explained by that existence as well as the truth of\nthose that will.",
        "I find this abuse prevailing among my most accomplished adversaries.\nBut once establish the proper verbal custom, let the word\n’truth’ represent a property of the idea, cease to make it something\nmysteriously connected with the object known, and the path opens\nfair and wide, as I believe, to the discussion of radical empiricism\non its merits. The truth of an idea will then mean only its\nworkings, or that in it which by ordinary psychological laws sets up\nthose workings; it will mean neither the idea’s object, nor anything\n’saltatory’ inside the idea, that terms drawn from experience cannot\ndescribe.",
        "One word more, ere I end this preface. A distinction is sometimes\nmade between Dewey, Schiller and myself, as if I, in supposing\nthe object’s existence, made a concession to popular prejudice which\nthey, as more radical pragmatists, refuse to make. As I myself\nunderstand these authors, we all three absolutely agree in admitting\nthe transcendency of the object (provided it be an experienceable\nobject) to the subject, in the truth-relation. Dewey in\nparticular has insisted almost ad nauseam that the whole meaning of\nour cognitive states and processes lies in the way they intervene in\nthe control and revaluation of independent existences or facts. His\naccount of knowledge is not only absurd, but meaningless, unless\nindependent existences be there of which our ideas take account, and\nfor the transformation of which they work. But because he and\nSchiller refuse to discuss objects and relations ’transcendent’ in\nthe sense of being ALTOGETHER TRANS-EXPERIENTIAL, their critics\npounce on sentences in their writings to that effect to show that\nthey deny the existence WITHIN THE REALM OF EXPERIENCE of objects\nexternal to the ideas that declare their presence there. [Footnote:\nIt gives me pleasure to welcome Professor Carveth Read into the\npragmatistic church, so far as his epistemology goes. See his\nvigorous book, The Metaphysics of Nature, 2d Edition, Appendix A.\n(London, Black, 1908.) The work What is Reality? by Francis Howe\nJohnson (Boston, 1891), of which I make the acquaintance only while\ncorrecting these proofs, contains some striking anticipations of the\nlater pragmatist view. The Psychology of Thinking, by Irving\nE. Miller (New York, Macmillan Co., 1909), which has just\nappeared, is one of the most convincing pragmatist document yet\npublished, tho it does not use the word ’pragmatism’ at all. While I\nam making references, I cannot refrain from inserting one to the\nextraordinarily acute article by H. V. Knox. in the Quarterly Review\nfor April, 1909.]",
        "It seems incredible that educated and apparently sincere\ncritics should so fail to catch their adversary’s point of view.",
        "What misleads so many of them is possibly also the fact that the\nuniverses of discourse of Schiller, Dewey, and myself are panoramas\nof different extent, and that what the one postulates explicitly the\nother provisionally leaves only in a state of implication, while the\nreader thereupon considers it to be denied. Schiller’s universe is\nthe smallest, being essentially a psychological one. He starts with\nbut one sort of thing, truth-claims, but is led ultimately to the\nindependent objective facts which they assert, inasmuch as the most\nsuccessfully validated of all claims is that such facts are\nthere. My universe is more essentially epistemological. I start with\ntwo things, the objective facts and the claims, and indicate which\nclaims, the facts being there, will work successfully as\nthe latter’s substitutes and which will not. I call the former\nclaims true. Dewey’s panorama, if I understand this colleague, is\nthe widest of the three, but I refrain from giving my own account of\nits complexity. Suffice it that he holds as firmly as I do to\nobjects independent of our judgments. If I am wrong in saying this,\nhe must correct me. I decline in this matter to be corrected at\nsecond hand.",
        "I have not pretended in the following pages to consider all the\ncritics of my account of truth, such as Messrs. Taylor, Lovejoy,\nGardiner, Bakewell, Creighton, Hibben, Parodi, Salter, Carus,\nLalande, Mentre, McTaggart, G. E. Moore, Ladd and others,\nespecially not Professor Schinz, who has published under the title\nof Anti-pragmatisme an amusing sociological romance. Some of these\ncritics seem to me to labor under an inability almost pathetic, to\nunderstand the thesis which they seek to refute. I imagine that most\nof their difficulties have been answered by anticipation elsewhere\nin this volume, and I am sure that my readers will thank me for not\nadding more repetition to the fearful amount that is already there.",

        "[Footnote: Read before the Aristotelian Society, December 1,\n1884, and first published in Mind, vol. x (1885).–This, and\nthe following articles have received a very slight verbal\nrevision, consisting mostly in the omission of redundancy.]",
        "The following inquiry is (to use a distinction familiar\nto readers of Mr. Shadworth Hodgson) not an inquiry into\nthe ’how it comes,’ but into the ’what it is’ of\ncognition. What we call acts of cognition are evidently\nrealized through what we call brains and their events,\nwhether there be ’souls’ dynamically connected with the\nbrains or not. But with neither brains nor souls has this\nessay any business to transact. In it we shall simply\nassume that cognition IS produced, somehow, and limit\nourselves to asking what elements it contains, what\nfactors it implies.",
        "Cognition is a function of consciousness. The first factor it\nimplies is therefore a state of consciousness wherein the cognition\nshall take place. Having elsewhere used the word ’feeling’ to\ndesignate generically all states of consciousness considered\nsubjectively, or without respect to their possible function, I shall\nthen say that, whatever elements an act of cognition may imply\nbesides, it at least implies the existence of a FEELING. [If the\nreader share the current antipathy to the word ’feeling,’ he may\nsubstitute for it, wherever I use it, the word ’idea,’ taken in the\nold broad Lockian sense, or he may use the clumsy phrase ’state of\nconsciousness,’ or finally he may say ’thought’ instead.]",
        "Now it is to be observed that the common consent of mankind has\nagreed that some feelings are cognitive and some are simple\nfacts having a subjective, or, what one might almost call a\nphysical, existence, but no such self-transcendent function as\nwould be implied in their being pieces of knowledge. Our task\nis again limited here. We are not to ask, ’How is self-transcendence\npossible?’ We are only to ask, ’How comes it that common sense\nhas assigned a number of cases in which it is assumed not only to be\npossible but actual? And what are the marks used by common sense\nto distinguish those cases from the rest?’ In short, our inquiry is\na chapter in descriptive psychology,–hardly anything more.",
        "Condillac embarked on a quest similar to this by his famous\nhypothesis of a statue to which various feelings were successively\nimparted. Its first feeling was supposed to be one of fragrance. But\nto avoid all possible complication with the question of genesis, let\nus not attribute even to a statue the possession of our imaginary\nfeeling. Let us rather suppose it attached to no matter, nor\nlocalized at any point in space, but left swinging IN VACUO, as\nit were, by the direct creative FIAT of a god. And let us also, to\nescape entanglement with difficulties about the physical or\npsychical nature of its ’object’ not call it a feeling of\nfragrance or of any other determinate sort, but limit ourselves to\nassuming that it is a feeling of Q. What is true of it under this\nabstract name will be no less true of it in any more particular\nshape (such as fragrance, pain, hardness) which the reader may\nsuppose.",
        "Now, if this feeling of Q be the only creation of the god, it will\nof course form the entire universe. And if, to escape the cavils of\nthat large class of persons who believe that SEMPER IDEM SENTIRE AC\nNON SENTIRE are the same, [Footnote:1 ’The Relativity of Knowledge,’\nheld in this sense, is, it may be observed in passing, one of the\noddest of philosophic superstitions. Whatever facts may be cited in\nits favor are due to the properties of nerve-tissue, which may be\nexhausted by too prolonged an excitement. Patients with neuralgias\nthat last unremittingly for days can, however, assure us that\nthe limits of this nerve-law are pretty widely drawn. But if\nwe physically could get a feeling that should last\neternally unchanged, what atom of logical or psychological argument\nis there to prove that it would not be felt as long as it\nlasted, and felt for just what it is, all that time? The reason for\nthe opposite prejudice seems to be our reluctance to think that\nso stupid a thing as such a feeling would necessarily be, should be\nallowed to fill eternity with its presence. An\ninterminable acquaintance, leading to no knowledge-about,–such\nwould be its condition.] we allow the feeling to be of as short a\nduration as they like, that universe will only need to last an\ninfinitesimal part of a second. The feeling in question will thus be\nreduced to its fighting weight, and all that befalls it in the way\nof a cognitive function must be held to befall in the brief\ninstant of its quickly snuffed-out life,–a life, it will also be\nnoticed, that has no other moment of consciousness either preceding\nor following it.",
        "Well now, can our little feeling, thus left alone in the universe,–\nfor the god and we psychological critics may be supposed left out of\nthe account,–can the feeling, I say, be said to have any sort of a\ncognitive function? For it to KNOW, there must be something to be\nknown. What is there, on the present supposition? One may reply,\n’the feeling’s content q.’ But does it not seem more proper to call\nthis the feeling’s QUALITY than its content? Does not the\nword ’content’ suggest that the feeling has already dirempted itself\nas an act from its content as an object? And would it be quite safe\nto assume so promptly that the quality q of a feeling is one and the\nsame thing with a feeling of the quality q? The quality q, so far,\nis an entirely subjective fact which the feeling carries so to speak\nendogenously, or in its pocket. If any one pleases to dignify so\nsimple a fact as this by the name of knowledge, of course\nnothing can prevent him. But let us keep closer to the path of\ncommon usage, and reserve the name knowledge for the cognition of\n’realities,’ meaning by realities things that exist independently of\nthe feeling through which their cognition occurs. If the content of\nthe feeling occur nowhere in the universe outside of the feeling\nitself, and perish with the feeling, common usage refuses to call it\na reality, and brands it as a subjective feature of the\nfeeling’s constitution, or at the most as the feeling’s DREAM.",
        "For the feeling to be cognitive in the specific sense, then, it must\nbe self-transcendent; and we must prevail upon the god to CREATE A\nREALITY OUTSIDE OF IT to correspond to its intrinsic quality Q. Thus\nonly can it be redeemed from the condition of being a solipsism. If\nnow the new created reality RESEMBLE the feeling’s quality Q I say\nthat the feeling may be held by us TO BE COGNIZANT OF THAT REALITY.",
        "This first instalment of my thesis is sure to be attacked. But one\nword before defending it ’Reality’ has become our warrant for\ncalling a feeling cognitive; but what becomes our warrant for\ncalling anything reality? The only reply is–the faith of the\npresent critic or inquirer. At every moment of his life he\nfinds himself subject to a belief in SOME realities, even though his\nrealities of this year should prove to be his illusions of the next.\nWhenever he finds that the feeling he is studying contemplates what\nhe himself regards as a reality, he must of course admit the feeling\nitself to be truly cognitive. We are ourselves the critics here; and\nwe shall find our burden much lightened by being allowed to take\nreality in this relative and provisional way. Every science must\nmake some assumptions. Erkenntnisstheoretiker are but fallible\nmortals. When they study the function of cognition, they do it by\nmeans of the same function in themselves. And knowing that the\nfountain cannot go higher than its source, we should promptly\nconfess that our results in this field are affected by our own\nliability to err. THE MOST WE CAN CLAIM IS, THAT WHAT WE SAY ABOUT\nCOGNITION MAY BE COUNTED AS TRUE AS WHAT WE SAY ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE.\nIf our hearers agree with us about what are to be held ’realities,’\nthey will perhaps also agree to the reality of our doctrine of the\nway in which they are known. We cannot ask for more.",
        "Our terminology shall follow the spirit of these remarks. We will\ndeny the function of knowledge to any feeling whose quality or\ncontent we do not ourselves believe to exist outside of that feeling\nas well as in it. We may call such a feeling a dream if we like; we\nshall have to see later whether we can call it a fiction or an\nerror.",
        "To revert now to our thesis. Some persons will immediately cry out,\n’How CAN a reality resemble a feeling?’ Here we find how wise we\nwere to name the quality of the feeling by an algebraic letter Q. We\nflank the whole difficulty of resemblance between an inner state\nand an outward reality, by leaving it free to any one to postulate\nas the reality whatever sort of thing he thinks CAN resemble a\nfeeling,–if not an outward thing, then another feeling like\nthe first one,–the mere feeling Q in the critic’s mind for example.\nEvading thus this objection, we turn to another which is sure to\nbe urged.",
        "It will come from those philosophers to whom ’thought,’ in the sense\nof a knowledge of relations, is the all in all of mental life; and\nwho hold a merely feeling consciousness to be no better–one would\nsometimes say from their utterances, a good deal worse–than no\nconsciousness at all. Such phrases as these, for example, are common\nto-day in the mouths of those who claim to walk in the footprints\nof Kant and Hegel rather than in the ancestral English paths: ’A\nperception detached from all others, “left out of the heap we call a\nmind,” being out of all relation, has no qualities–is simply\nnothing. We can no more consider it than we can see vacancy.’ ’It is\nsimply in itself fleeting, momentary, unnameable (because while we\nname it it has become another), and for the very same reason\nunknowable, the very negation of knowability.’ ’Exclude from what we\nhave considered real all qualities constituted by relation, we find\nthat none are left.’",
        "Altho such citations as these from the writings of Professor Green\nmight be multiplied almost indefinitely, they would hardly repay\nthe pains of collection, so egregiously false is the doctrine they\nteach. Our little supposed feeling, whatever it may be, from the\ncognitive point of view, whether a bit of knowledge or a dream, is\ncertainly no psychical zero. It is a most positively and definitely\nqualified inner fact, with a complexion all its own. Of course there\nare many mental facts which it is NOT. It knows Q, if Q be a\nreality, with a very minimum of knowledge. It neither dates nor\nlocates it. It neither classes nor names it. And it neither knows\nitself as a feeling, nor contrasts itself with other feelings, nor\nestimates its own duration or intensity. It is, in short, if there\nis no more of it than this, a most dumb and helpless and useless\nkind of thing.",
        "But if we must describe it by so many negations, and if it can say\nnothing ABOUT itself or ABOUT anything else, by what right do we\ndeny that it is a psychical zero? And may not the ’relationists’ be\nright after all?",
        "In the innocent looking word ’about’ lies the solution of this\nriddle; and a simple enough solution it is when frankly looked at. A\nquotation from a too seldom quoted book, the Exploratio Philosophica\nof John Grote (London, 1865), p. 60, will form the best\nintroduction to it.",
        "’Our knowledge,’ writes Grote, ’may be contemplated in either of two\nways, or, to use other words, we may speak in a double manner of\nthe “object” of knowledge. That is, we may either use language thus:\nwe KNOW a thing, a man, etc.; or we may use it thus: we know such\nand such things ABOUT the thing, the man, etc. Language in general,\nfollowing its true logical instinct, distinguishes between these two\napplications of the notion of knowledge, the one being yvwvai,\nnoscere, kennen, connaitre, the other being eidevai, scire, wissen,\nsavoir. In the origin, the former may be considered more what I have\ncalled phenomenal–it is the notion of knowledge as ACQUAINTANCE or\nfamiliarity with what is known; which notion is perhaps more akin to\nthe phenomenal bodily communication, and is less purely\nintellectual than the other; it is the kind of knowledge which we\nhave of a thing by the presentation to the senses or the\nrepresentation of it in picture or type, a Vorstellung. The\nother, which is what we express in judgments or propositions, what\nis embodied in Begriffe or concepts without any necessary\nimaginative representation, is in its origin the more\nintellectual notion of knowledge. There is no reason, however, why\nwe should not express our knowledge, whatever its kind, in\neither manner, provided only we do not confusedly express it, in the\nsame proposition or piece of reasoning, in both.’",
        "Now obviously if our supposed feeling of Q is (if knowledge at all)\nonly knowledge of the mere acquaintance-type, it is milking a he-\n goat, as the ancients would have said, to try to extract from it\nany deliverance ABOUT anything under the sun, even about itself. And\nit is as unjust, after our failure, to turn upon it and call it a\npsychical nothing, as it would be, after our fruitless attack upon\nthe billy-goat, to proclaim the non-lactiferous character of\nthe whole goat-tribe. But the entire industry of the Hegelian school\nin trying to shove simple sensation out of the pale of philosophic\nrecognition is founded on this false issue. It is always the\n’speechlessness’ of sensation, its inability to make any\n’statement,’[Footnote: See, for example, Green’s Introduction to\nHume’s Treatise of Human Nature, p. 36.] that is held to make the\nvery notion of it meaningless, and to justify the student of\nknowledge in scouting it out of existence. ’Significance,’ in the\nsense of standing as the sign of other mental states, is taken to be\nthe sole function of what mental states we have; and from the\nperception that our little primitive sensation has as yet no\nsignificance in this literal sense, it is an easy step to call it\nfirst meaningless, next senseless, then vacuous, and finally to\nbrand it as absurd and inadmissible. But in this universal\nliquidation, this everlasting slip, slip, slip, of\ndirect acquaintance into knowledge-ABOUT, until at last nothing is\nleft about which the knowledge can be supposed to obtain, does not\nall ’significance’ depart from the situation? And when our knowledge\nabout things has reached its never so complicated perfection, must\nthere not needs abide alongside of it and inextricably mixed in with\nit some acquaintance with WHAT things all this knowledge is about?",
        "Now, our supposed little feeling gives a WHAT; and if other feelings\nshould succeed which remember the first, its WHAT may stand as\nsubject or predicate of some piece of knowledge-about, of some\njudgment, perceiving relations between it and other WHATS which\nthe other feelings may know. The hitherto dumb Q will then receive a\nname and be no longer speechless. But every name, as students\nof logic know, has its ’denotation’; and the denotation always means\nsome reality or content, relationless as extra or with its\ninternal relations unanalyzed, like the Q which our\nprimitive sensation is supposed to know. No relation-\nexpressing proposition is possible except on the basis of a\npreliminary acquaintance with such ’facts,’ with such contents, as\nthis. Let the Q be fragrance, let it be toothache, or let it be a\nmore complex kind of feeling, like that of the full-moon swimming in\nher blue abyss, it must first come in that simple shape, and be held\nfast in that first intention, before any knowledge ABOUT it can be\nattained. The knowledge ABOUT it is IT with a context added. Undo\nIT, and what is added cannot be CONtext. [Footnote: If A enters and\nB exclaims, ’Didn’t you see my brother on the stairs?’ we all hold\nthat A may answer, ’I saw him, but didn’t know he was your brother’;\nignorance of brotherhood not abolishing power to see. But those who,\non account of the unrelatedness of the first facts with which we\nbecome acquainted, deny them to be ’known’ to us, ought in\nconsistency to maintain that if A did not perceive the relationship\nof the man on the stairs to B, it was impossible he should\nhave noticed him at all.]",
        "Let us say no more then about this objection, but enlarge our\nthesis, thus: If there be in the universe a Q other than the Q in\nthe feeling, the latter may have acquaintance with an entity\nejective to itself; an acquaintance moreover, which, as mere\nacquaintance, it would be hard to imagine susceptible either of\nimprovement or increase, being in its way complete; and which would\noblige us (so long as we refuse not to call acquaintance\nknowledge) to say not only that the feeling is cognitive, but that\nall qualities of feeling, SO LONG AS THERE IS ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF\nTHEM WHICH THEY RESEMBLE, are feelings OF qualities of existence,\nand perceptions of outward fact.",
        "The point of this vindication of the cognitive function of the first\nfeeling lies, it will be noticed, in the discovery that q does exist\nelsewhere than in it. In case this discovery were not made, we could\nnot be sure the feeling was cognitive; and in case there were\nnothing outside to be discovered, we should have to call the feeling\na dream. But the feeling itself cannot make the discovery. Its own q\nis the only q it grasps; and its own nature is not a particle\naltered by having the self-transcendent function of cognition either\nadded to it or taken away. The function is accidental; synthetic,\nnot analytic; and falls outside and not inside its being. [Footnote:\nIt seems odd to call so important a function accidental, but I do\nnot see how we can mend the matter. Just as, if we start with the\nreality and ask how it may come to be known, we can only reply by\ninvoking a feeling which shall RECONSTRUCT it in its own more\nprivate fashion; so, if we start with the feeling and ask how it may\ncome to know, we can only reply by invoking a reality which shall\nRECONSTRUCT it in its own more public fashion. In either case,\nhowever, the datum we start with remains just what it was. One may\neasily get lost in verbal mysteries about the difference between\nquality of feeling and feeling of quality, between receiving and\nreconstructing the knowledge of a reality. But at the end we must\nconfess that the notion of real cognition involves an\nunmediated dualism of the knower and the known. See Bowne’s\nMetaphysics, New York, 1882, pp. 403-412, and various passages in\nLotze, e.g., Logic, Sec. 308. [’Unmediated’ is a bad word to\nhave used.–1909.]]",
        "A feeling feels as a gun shoots. If there be nothing to be felt or\nhit, they discharge themselves ins blaue hinein. If, however,\nsomething starts up opposite them, they no longer simply shoot or\nfeel, they hit and know.",
        "But with this arises a worse objection than any yet made. We the\ncritics look on and see a real q and a feeling of q; and because the\ntwo resemble each other, we say the one knows the other. But what\nright have we to say this until we know that the feeling of q means\nto stand for or represent just that SAME other q? Suppose, instead\nof one q, a number of real q’s in the field. If the gun shoots and\nhits, we can easily see which one of them it hits. But how can we\ndistinguish which one the feeling knows? It knows the one it stands\nfor. But which one DOES it stand for? It declares no intention in\nthis respect. It merely resembles; it resembles all indifferently;\nand resembling, per se, is not necessarily representing or standing-\nfor at all. Eggs resemble each other, but do not on that account\nrepresent, stand for, or know each other. And if you say this\nis because neither of them is a FEELING, then imagine the world to\nconsist of nothing but toothaches, which ARE feelings, feelings\nresembling each other exactly,–would they know each other the\nbetter for all that?",
        "The case of q being a bare quality like that of toothache-pain is\nquite different from that of its being a concrete individual thing.\nThere is practically no test for deciding whether the feeling of a\nbare quality means to represent it or not. It can DO nothing to the\nquality beyond resembling it, simply because an abstract quality is\na thing to which nothing can be done. Being without context or\nenvironment or principium individuationis, a quiddity with\nno haecceity, a platonic idea, even duplicate editions of such a\nquality (were they possible), would be indiscernible, and no sign\ncould be given, no result altered, whether the feeling I meant to\nstand for this edition or for that, or whether it simply resembled\nthe quality without meaning to stand for it at all.",
        "If now we grant a genuine pluralism of editions to the quality q, by\nassigning to each a CONTEXT which shall distinguish it from its\nmates, we may proceed to explain which edition of it the feeling\nknows, by extending our principle of resemblance to the context too,\nand saying the feeling knows the particular q whose context it most\nexactly duplicates. But here again the theoretic doubt recurs:\nduplication and coincidence, are they knowledge? The gun shows which\nq it points to and hits, by BREAKING it. Until the feeling can show\nus which q it points to and knows, by some equally flagrant token,\nwhy are we not free to deny that it either points to or knows any\none of the REAL q’s at all, and to affirm that the\nword ’resemblance’ exhaustively describes its relation to the\nreality?",
        "Well, as a matter of fact, every actual feeling DOES show us, quite\nas flagrantly as the gun, which q it points to; and practically in\nconcrete cases the matter is decided by an element we have hitherto\nleft out. Let us pass from abstractions to possible instances, and\nask our obliging deus ex machina to frame for us a richer world. Let\nhim send me, for example, a dream of the death of a certain man, and\nlet him simultaneously cause the man to die. How would our practical\ninstinct spontaneously decide whether this were a case of cognition\nof the reality, or only a sort of marvellous coincidence of a\nresembling reality with my dream? Just such puzzling cases as this\nare what the ’society for psychical research’ is busily\ncollecting and trying to interpret in the most reasonable way.",
        "If my dream were the only one of the kind I ever had in my life, if\nthe context of the death in the dream differed in many particulars\nfrom the real death’s context, and if my dream led me to no action\nabout the death, unquestionably we should all call it a strange\ncoincidence, and naught besides. But if the death in the dream had a\nlong context, agreeing point for point with every feature that\nattended the real death; if I were constantly having such\ndreams, all equally perfect, and if on awaking I had a habit of\nACTING immediately as if they were true and so getting ’the start’\nof my more tardily instructed neighbors,–we should in all\nprobability have to admit that I had some mysterious kind of\nclairvoyant power, that my dreams in an inscrutable way meant just\nthose realities they figured, and that the word ’coincidence’ failed\nto touch the root of the matter. And whatever doubts any one\npreserved would completely vanish, if it should appear that from the\nmidst of my dream I had the power of INTERFERING with the course of\nthe reality, and making the events in it turn this way or that,\naccording as I dreamed they should. Then at least it would be\ncertain that my waking critics and my dreaming self were dealing\nwith the SAME.",
        "And thus do men invariably decide such a question. THE FALLING OF\nTHE DREAM’S PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES into the real world, and the\nEXTENT of the resemblance between the two worlds are the criteria\nthey instinctively use. [Footnote: The thoroughgoing objector might,\nit is true, still return to the charge, and, granting a dream which\nshould completely mirror the real universe, and all the actions\ndreamed in which should be instantly matched by duplicate actions in\nthis universe, still insist that this is nothing more than harmony,\nand that it is as far as ever from being made clear whether\nthe dream-world refers to that other world, all of whose details it\nso closely copies. This objection leads deep into metaphysics. I do\nnot impugn its importance, and justice obliges me to say that but\nfor the teachings of my colleague, Dr. Josiah Royce, I should\nneither have grasped its full force nor made my own practical and\npsychological point of view as clear to myself as it is. On this\noccasion I prefer to stick steadfastly to that point of view; but I\nhope that Dr. Royce’s more fundamental criticism of the function of\ncognition may ere long see the light. [I referred in this note to\nRoyce’s religious aspect of philosophy, then about to be published.\nThis powerful book maintained that the notion of REFERRING involved\nthat of an inclusive mind that shall own both the real q and the\nmental q, and use the latter expressly as a representative symbol of\nthe former. At the time I could not refute this transcendentalist\nopinion. Later, largely through the influence of Professor D. S.\nMiller (see his essay ’The meaning of truth and error,’ in the\nPhilosophical Review for 1893, vol. 2 p. 403) I came to see that any\ndefinitely experienceable workings would serve as\nintermediaries quite as well as the absolute mind’s\nintentions would.]] All feeling is for the sake of action, all\nfeeling results in action,–to-day no argument is needed to prove\nthese truths. But by a most singular disposition of nature which we\nmay conceive to have been different, MY FEELINGS ACT UPON THE\nREALITIES WITHIN MY CRITIC’S WORLD. Unless, then, my critic can\nprove that my feeling does not ’point to’ those realities which it\nacts upon, how can he continue to doubt that he and I are alike\ncognizant of one and the same real world? If the action is performed\nin one world, that must be the world the feeling intends; if in\nanother world, THAT is the world the feeling has in mind. If your\nfeeling bear no fruits in my world, I call it utterly detached from\nmy world; I call it a solipsism, and call its world a dream-world.\nIf your toothache do not prompt you to ACT as if I had a toothache,\nnor even as if I had a separate existence; if you neither say to me,\n’I know now how you must suffer!’ nor tell me of a remedy, I deny\nthat your feeling, however it may resemble mine, is really cognizant\nof mine. It gives no SIGN of being cognizant, and such a sign is\nabsolutely necessary to my admission that it is.",
        "Before I can think you to mean my world, you must affect my world;\nbefore I can think you to mean much of it, you must affect much of\nit; and before I can be sure you mean it AS I DO, you must affect it\nJUST AS I SHOULD if I were in your place. Then I, your critic, will\ngladly believe that we are thinking, not only of the same reality,\nbut that we are thinking it ALIKE, and thinking of much of its\nextent.",
        "Without the practical effects of our neighbor’s feelings on our own\nworld, we should never suspect the existence of our\nneighbor’s feelings at all, and of course should never\nfind ourselves playing the critic as we do in this article. The\nconstitution of nature is very peculiar. In the world of each of us\nare certain objects called human bodies, which move about and act on\nall the other objects there, and the occasions of their action are\nin the main what the occasions of our action would be, were they our\nbodies. They use words and gestures, which, if we used them, would\nhave thoughts behind them,–no mere thoughts uberhaupt, however, but\nstrictly determinate thoughts. I think you have the notion of\nfire in general, because I see you act towards this fire in my room\njust as I act towards it,–poke it and present your person towards\nit, and so forth. But that binds me to believe that if you feel\n’fire’ at all, THIS is the fire you feel. As a matter of fact,\nwhenever we constitute ourselves into psychological critics, it is\nnot by dint of discovering which reality a feeling ’resembles’ that\nwe find out which reality it means. We become first aware of which\none it means, and then we suppose that to be the one it resembles.\nWe see each other looking at the same objects, pointing to them and\nturning them over in various ways, and thereupon we hope and trust\nthat all of our several feelings resemble the reality and each\nother. But this is a thing of which we are never theoretically sure.\nStill, it would practically be a case of grubelsucht, if a ruffian\nwere assaulting and drubbing my body, to spend much time in subtle\nspeculation either as to whether his vision of my body resembled\nmine, or as to whether the body he really MEANT to insult were not\nsome body in his mind’s eye, altogether other from my own. The\npractical point of view brushes such metaphysical cobwebs away. If\nwhat he have in mind be not MY body, why call we it a body at all?\nHis mind is inferred by me as a term, to whose existence we trace\nthe things that happen. The inference is quite void if the term,\nonce inferred, be separated from its connection with the body\nthat made me infer it, and connected with another that is not mine\nat all. No matter for the metaphysical puzzle of how our two minds,\nthe ruffian’s and mine, can mean the same body. Men who see each\nother’s bodies sharing the same space, treading the same earth,\nsplashing the same water, making the same air resonant, and pursuing\nthe same game and eating out of the same dish, will never\npractically believe in a pluralism of solipsistic worlds.",
        "Where, however, the actions of one mind seem to take no effect in\nthe world of the other, the case is different. This is what happens\nin poetry and fiction. Every one knows Ivanhoe, for example; but so\nlong as we stick to the story pure and simple without regard to\nthe facts of its production, few would hesitate to admit that there\nare as many different Ivanhoes as there are different minds\ncognizant of the story. [Footnote: That is, there is no REAL\n’Ivanhoe,’ not even the one in Sir Walter Scott’s mind as he was\nwriting the story. That one is only the FIRST one of the Ivanhoe-\nsolipsisms. It is quite true we can make it the real Ivanhoe if we\nlike, and then say that the other Ivanhoes know it or do not know\nit, according as they refer to and resemble it or no. This is done\nby bringing in Sir Walter Scott himself as the author of the real\nIvanhoe, and so making a complex object of both. This object,\nhowever, is not a story pure and simple. It has dynamic\nrelations with the world common to the experience of all the\nreaders. Sir Walter Scott’s Ivanhoe got itself printed in volumes\nwhich we all can handle, and to any one of which we can refer to\nsee which of our versions be the true one, i.e., the original one\nof Scott himself. We can see the manuscript; in short we can\nget back to the Ivanhoe in Scott’s mind by many an avenue\nand channel of this real world of our experience,–a thing we can by\nno means do with either the Ivanhoe or the Rebecca, either the\nTemplar or the Isaac of York, of the story taken simply as such, and\ndetached from the conditions of its production. Everywhere, then, we\nhave the same test: can we pass continuously from two objects in two\nminds to a third object which seems to be in BOTH minds, because\neach mind feels every modification imprinted on it by the other? If\nso, the first two objects named are derivatives, to say the least,\nfrom the same third object, and may be held, if they resemble each\nother, to refer to one and the same reality.] The fact that all\nthese Ivanhoes RESEMBLE each other does not prove the contrary. But\nif an alteration invented by one man in his version were to\nreverberate immediately through all the other versions, and\nproduce changes therein, we should then easily agree that all these\nthinkers were thinking the SAME Ivanhoe, and that, fiction or no\nfiction, it formed a little world common to them all.",
        "Having reached this point, we may take up our thesis and improve it\nagain. Still calling the reality by the name of q and letting\nthe critic’s feeling vouch for it, we can say that any other feeling\nwill be held cognizant of q, provided it both resemble q, and refer\nto q, as shown by its either modifying q directly, or modifying some\nother reality, p or r, which the critic knows to be continuous with\nq. Or more shortly, thus: THE FEELING OF q KNOWS WHATEVER REALITY IT\nRESEMBLES, AND EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OPERATES ON. If it\nresemble without operating, it is a dream; if it operate without\nresembling, it is an error. [Footnote: Among such errors are those\ncases in which our feeling operates on a reality which it does\npartially resemble, and yet does not intend: as for instance, when\nI take up your umbrella, meaning to take my own. I cannot be said\nhere either to know your umbrella, or my own, which latter my\nfeeling more completely resembles. I am mistaking them both,\nmisrepresenting their context, etc.",
        "We have spoken in the text as if the critic were necessarily one\nmind, and the feeling criticised another. But the criticised feeling\nand its critic may be earlier and later feelings of the same mind,\nand here it might seem that we could dispense with the notion of\noperating, to prove that critic and criticised are referring to and\nmeaning to represent the SAME. We think we see our past feelings\ndirectly, and know what they refer to without appeal. At the worst,\nwe can always fix the intention of our present feeling and MAKE it\nrefer to the same reality to which any one of our past feelings may\nhave referred. So we need no ’operating’ here, to make sure that the\nfeeling and its critic mean the same real q. Well, all the better if\nthis is so! We have covered the more complex and difficult case in\nour text, and we may let this easier one go. The main thing\nat present is to stick to practical psychology, and ignore\nmetaphysical difficulties.",
        "One more remark. Our formula contains, it will be observed, nothing\nto correspond to the great principle of cognition laid down by\nProfessor Ferrier in his Institutes of Metaphysic and apparently\nadopted by all the followers of Fichte, the principle, namely, that\nfor knowledge to be constituted there must be knowledge of the\nknowing mind along with whatever else is known: not q, as we have\nsupposed, but q PLUS MYSELF, must be the least I can know. It is\ncertain that the common sense of mankind never dreams of using any\nsuch principle when it tries to discriminate between conscious\nstates that are knowledge and conscious states that are not. So\nthat Ferrier’s principle, if it have any relevancy at all, must\nhave relevancy to the metaphysical possibility of consciousness\nat large, and not to the practically recognized constitution\nof cognitive consciousness. We may therefore pass it by\nwithout further notice here.] It is to be feared that the reader may\nconsider this formula rather insignificant and obvious, and hardly\nworth the labor of so many pages, especially when he considers that\nthe only cases to which it applies are percepts, and that the whole\nfield of symbolic or conceptual thinking seems to elude its grasp.\nWhere the reality is either a material thing or act, or a state of\nthe critic’s consciousness, I may both mirror it in my mind and\noperate upon it–in the latter case indirectly, of course–as\nsoon as I perceive it. But there are many cognitions, universally\nallowed to be such, which neither mirror nor operate on their\nrealities.",
        "In the whole field of symbolic thought we are universally held both\nto intend, to speak of, and to reach conclusions about–to know in\nshort–particular realities, without having in our subjective\nconsciousness any mind-stuff that resembles them even in a remote\ndegree. We are instructed about them by language which awakens no\nconsciousness beyond its sound; and we know WHICH realities they\nare by the faintest and most fragmentary glimpse of some remote\ncontext they may have and by no direct imagination of themselves. As\nminds may differ here, let me speak in the first person. I am sure\nthat my own current thinking has WORDS for its almost exclusive\nsubjective material, words which are made intelligible by being\nreferred to some reality that lies beyond the horizon of direct\nconsciousness, and of which I am only aware as of a terminal\nMORE existing in a certain direction, to which the words might lead\nbut do not lead yet. The SUBJECT, or TOPIC, of the words is\nusually something towards which I mentally seem to pitch them in a\nbackward way, almost as I might jerk my thumb over my shoulder to\npoint at something, without looking round, if I were only entirely\nsure that it was there. The UPSHOT, or CONCLUSION, of the words is\nsomething towards which I seem to incline my head forwards, as if\ngiving assent to its existence, tho all my mind’s eye catches sight\nof may be some tatter of an image connected with it, which tatter,\nhowever, if only endued with the feeling of familiarity and reality,\nmakes me feel that the whole to which it belongs is rational and\nreal, and fit to be let pass.",
        " Here then is cognitive consciousness on a large scale, and yet what\nit knows, it hardly resembles in the least degree. The formula last\nlaid down for our thesis must therefore be made more complete. We\nmay now express it thus: A PERCEPT KNOWS WHATEVER REALITY IT\nDIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OPERATES ON AND RESEMBLES; ACONCEPTUAL\nFEELING, OR THOUGHT KNOWS A REALITY, WHENEVER IT ACTUALLY OR\nPOTENTIALLY TERMINATES IN A PERCEPT THAT OPERATES ON, OR RESEMBLES\nTHAT REALITY, OR IS OTHERWISE CONNECTED WITH IT OR WITH ITS CONTEXT.\nThe latter percept may be either sensation or sensorial idea; and\nwhen I say the thought must TERMINATE in such a percept, I mean that\nit must ultimately be capable of leading up thereto,–by the way of\npractical",
        " Is an incomplete ’thought about’ that reality, that reality is its\n’topic,’ etc. experience, if the terminal feeling be a sensation; by\nthe way of logical or habitual suggestion, if it be only an image in\nthe mind.",
        "Let an illustration make this plainer. I open the first book I take\nup, and read the first sentence that meets my eye: ’Newton saw\nthe handiwork of God in the heavens as plainly as Paley in the\nanimal kingdom.’ I immediately look back and try to analyze the\nsubjective state in which I rapidly apprehended this sentence as I\nread it. In the first place there was an obvious feeling that the\nsentence was intelligible and rational and related to the world of\nrealities. There was also a sense of agreement or harmony between\n’Newton,’ ’Paley,’ and ’God.’ There was no apparent image connected\nwith the words ’heavens,’ or ’handiwork,’ or ’God’; they were\nwords merely. With ’animal kingdom’ I think there was the faintest\nconsciousness (it may possibly have been an image of the steps) of\nthe Museum of Zoology in the town of Cambridge where I write. With\n’Paley’ there was an equally faint consciousness of a small\ndark leather book; and with ’Newton’ a pretty distinct vision of the\nright-hand lower corner of curling periwig. This is all the mind-\nstuff I can discover in my first consciousness of the meaning of\nthis sentence, and I am afraid that even not all of this would have\nbeen present had I come upon the sentence in a genuine reading of\nthe book, and not picked it out for an experiment. And yet my\nconsciousness was truly cognitive. The sentence is ’about realities’\nwhich my psychological critic–for we must not forget him–\nacknowledges to be such, even as he acknowledges my distinct feeling\nthat they ARE realities, and my acquiescence in the general\nrightness of what I read of them, to be true knowledge on my part.",
        "Now what justifies my critic in being as lenient as this? This\nsingularly inadequate consciousness of mine, made up of symbols\nthat neither resemble nor affect the realities they stand for,–how\ncan he be sure it is cognizant of the very realities he has himself\nin mind?",
        "He is sure because in countless like cases he has seen such\ninadequate and symbolic thoughts, by developing themselves,\nterminate in percepts that practically modified and presumably\nresembled his own. By ’developing’ themselves is meant obeying their\ntendencies, following up the suggestions nascently present in them,\nworking in the direction in which they seem to point, clearing up\nthe penumbra, making distinct the halo, unravelling the\nfringe, which is part of their composition, and in the midst of\nwhich their more substantive kernel of subjective content seems\nconsciously to lie. Thus I may develop my thought in the\nPaley direction by procuring the brown leather volume and bringing\nthe passages about the animal kingdom before the critic’s eyes. I\nmay satisfy him that the words mean for me just what they mean for\nhim, by showing him IN CONCRETO the very animals and their\narrangements, of which the pages treat. I may get Newton’s works and\nportraits; or if I follow the line of suggestion of the wig, I may\nsmother my critic in seventeenth-century matters pertaining to\nNewton’s environment, to show that the word ’Newton’ has the same\nLOCUS and relations in both our minds. Finally I may, by act and\nword, persuade him that what I mean by God and the heavens and\nthe analogy of the handiworks, is just what he means also.",
        "My demonstration in the last resort is to his SENSES. My thought\nmakes me act on his senses much as he might himself act on\nthem, were he pursuing the consequences of a perception of his own.\nPractically then MY thought terminates in HIS realities. He\nwillingly supposes it, therefore, to be OF them, and inwardly to\nRESEMBLE what his own thought would be, were it of the same symbolic\nsort as mine. And the pivot and fulcrum and support of his\nmental persuasion, is the sensible operation which my thought leads\nme, or may lead, to effect–the bringing of Paley’s book, of\nNewton’s portrait, etc., before his very eyes.",
        "In the last analysis, then, we believe that we all know and think\nabout and talk about the same world, because WE BELIEVE OUR\nPERCEPTS ARE POSSESSED BY US IN COMMON. And we believe this because\nthe percepts of each one of us seem to be changed in consequence of\nchanges in the percepts of someone else. What I am for you is in the\nfirst instance a percept of your own. Unexpectedly, however, I open\nand show you a book, uttering certain sounds the while. These acts\nare also your percepts, but they so resemble acts of yours with\nfeelings prompting them, that you cannot doubt I have the\nfeelings too, or that the book is one book felt in both our worlds.\nThat it is felt in the same way, that my feelings of it resemble\nyours, is something of which we never can be sure, but which we\nassume as the simplest hypothesis that meets the case. As a matter\nof fact, we never ARE sure of it, and, as ERKENNTNISSTHEORETIKER, we\ncan only say that of feelings that should NOT resemble each other,\nboth could not know the same thing at the same time in the same way.\n[Footnote: Though both might terminate in the same thing and be\nincomplete thoughts ’about’ it.] If each holds to its own percept\nas the reality, it is bound to say of the other percept, that,\nthough it may INTEND that reality, and prove this by working change\nupon it, yet, if it do not resemble it, it is all false and wrong.\n[Footnote: The difference between Idealism and Realism is\nimmaterial here. What is said in the text is consistent with\neither theory. A law by which my percept shall change yours\ndirectly is no more mysterious than a law by which it shall\nfirst change a physical reality, and then the reality change\nyours. In either case you and I seem knit into a continuous\nworld, and not to form a pair of solipsisms.]",
        "If this be so of percepts, how much more so of higher modes of\nthought! Even in the sphere of sensation individuals are\nprobably different enough. Comparative study of the simplest\nconceptual elements seems to show a wider divergence still. And when\nit comes to general theories and emotional attitudes towards life,\nit is indeed time to say with Thackeray, ’My friend, two different\nuniverses walk about under your hat and under mine.’",
        "What can save us at all and prevent us from flying asunder into a\nchaos of mutually repellent solipsisms? Through what can our\nseveral minds commune? Through nothing but the mutual resemblance of\nthose of our perceptual feelings which have this power of modifying\none another, WHICH ARE MERE DUMB KNOWLEDGES-OF-ACQUAINTANCE, and\nwhich must also resemble their realities or not know them aright at\nall. In such pieces of knowledge-of-acquaintance all our knowledge-\nabout must end, and carry a sense of this possible termination as\npart of its content. These percepts, these termini, these sensible\nthings, these mere matters-of-acquaintance, are the only\nrealities we ever directly know, and the whole history of our\nthought is the history of our substitution of one of them for\nanother, and the reduction of the substitute to the status of a\nconceptual sign. Contemned though they be by some thinkers, these\nsensations are the mother-earth, the anchorage, the stable rock,\nthe first and last limits, the terminus a quo and the terminus ad\nquem of the mind. to find such sensational termini should be our aim\nwith all our higher thought. They end discussion; they destroy the\nfalse conceit of knowledge; and without them we are all at sea with\neach other’s meaning. If two men act alike on a percept, they\nbelieve themselves to feel alike about it; if not, they may suspect\nthey know it in differing ways. We can never be sure we understand\neach other till we are able to bring the matter to this test.\n[Footnote: ’There  is no distinction of meaning so fine as to\nconsist in anything but a possible difference of practice.... It\nappears, then, that the rule for attaining the [highest] grade\nof clearness of apprehension is as follows: Consider what\neffects, which might conceivably have practical bearings, we\nconceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our\nconception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the\nobject.’ Charles S. Peirce: ’How to make our Ideas clear,’ in\nPopular Science Monthly, New York, January, 1878, p. 293.] This is\nwhy metaphysical discussions are so much like fighting with the air;\nthey have no practical issue of a sensational kind. ’Scientific’\ntheories, on the other hand, always terminate in definite\npercepts. You can deduce a possible sensation from your theory and,\ntaking me into your laboratory, prove that your theory is true of my\nworld by giving me the sensation then and there. Beautiful is the\nflight of conceptual reason through the upper air of truth.\nNo wonder philosophers are dazzled by it still, and no wonder they\nlook with some disdain at the low earth of feeling from which the\ngoddess launched herself aloft. But woe to her if she return not\nhome to its acquaintance; Nirgends haften dann die unsicheren\nSohlen–every crazy wind will take her, and, like a fire-balloon at\nnight, she will go out among the stars.",
        "NOTE.–The reader will easily see how much of the account of the\ntruth-function developed later in Pragmatism was already explicit in\nthis earlier article, and how much came to be defined later. In this\nearlier article we find distinctly asserted:–",
        "1. The reality, external to the true idea;",
        "2. The critic, reader, or epistemologist, with his own belief, as\nwarrant for this reality’s existence;",
        "3. The experienceable environment, as the vehicle or\nmedium connecting knower with known, and yielding the\ncognitive RELATION;",
        "4. The notion of POINTING, through this medium, to the reality, as\none condition of our being said to know it;",
        "5. That of RESEMBLING it, and eventually AFFECTING it, as\ndetermining the pointing to IT and not to something else.",
        "6. The elimination of the ’epistemological gulf,’ so that the whole\ntruth-relation falls inside of the continuities of\nconcrete experience, and is constituted of particular processes,\nvarying with every object and subject, and susceptible of being\ndescribed in detail.",
        "The defects in this earlier account are:–",
        "1. The possibly undue prominence given to resembling, which altho a\nfundamental function in knowing truly, is so often dispensed with;",
        "2. The undue emphasis laid upon operating on the object itself,\nwhich in many cases is indeed decisive of that being what we refer\nto, but which is often lacking, or replaced by operations on other\nthings related to the object.",
        "3. The imperfect development of the generalized notion of the\nWORKABILITY of the feeling or idea as equivalent to\nthat SATISFACTORY ADAPTATION to the particular reality,\nwhich constitutes the truth of the idea. It is this more generalized\nnotion, as covering all such specifications as pointing, fitting,\noperating or resembling, that distinguishes the developed view\nof Dewey, Schiller, and myself.",
        "4. The treatment, [earlier], of percepts as the only realm of\nreality. I now treat concepts as a co-ordinate realm.",
        "The next paper represents a somewhat broader grasp of the topic on\nthe writer’s part.",
        "[Footnote: Extracts from a presidential address\nbefore the American Psychological Association, published in the\nPsychological Review, vol. ii, p. 105 (1895).]",
        "THERE are two ways of knowing things, knowing them immediately or\nintuitively, and knowing them conceptually or\nrepresentatively. Altho such things as the white paper before our\neyes can be known intuitively, most of the things we know, the\ntigers now in India, for example, or the scholastic system of\nphilosophy, are known only representatively or symbolically.",
        "Suppose, to fix our ideas, that we take first a case of conceptual\nknowledge; and let it be our knowledge of the tigers in India, as we\nsit here. Exactly what do we MEAN by saying that we here know the\ntigers? What is the precise fact that the cognition so\nconfidently claimed is KNOWN-AS, to use Shadworth\nHodgson’s inelegant but valuable form of words?",
        "Most men would answer that what we mean by knowing the tigers is\nhaving them, however absent in body, become in some way present to\nour thought; or that our knowledge of them is known as presence of\nour thought to them. A great mystery is usually made of\nthis peculiar presence in absence; and the scholastic philosophy,\nwhich is only common sense grown pedantic, would explain it as a\npeculiar kind of existence, called INTENTIONAL EXISTENCE of the\ntigers in our mind. At the very least, people would say that what we\nmean by knowing the tigers is mentally POINTING towards them as we\nsit here.",
        "But now what do we mean by POINTING, in such a case as this? What is\nthe pointing known-as, here?",
        "To this question I shall have to give a very prosaic answer–one\nthat traverses the pre-possessions not only of common sense\nand scholasticism, but also those of nearly all the epistemological\nwriters whom I have ever read. The answer, made brief, is this:\nThe pointing of our thought to the tigers is known simply and solely\nas a procession of mental associates and motor consequences that\nfollow on the thought, and that would lead harmoniously, if followed\nout, into some ideal or real context, or even into the immediate\npresence, of the tigers. It is known as our rejection of a jaguar,\nif that beast were shown us as a tiger; as our assent to a genuine\ntiger if so shown. It is known as our ability to utter all sorts of\npropositions which don’t contradict other propositions that are true\nof the real tigers. It is even known, if we take the tigers very\nseriously, as actions of ours which may terminate in directly\nintuited tigers, as they would if we took a voyage to India for the\npurpose of tiger-hunting and brought back a lot of skins of the\nstriped rascals which we had laid low. In all this there is no self-\ntranscendency in our mental images TAKEN BY THEMSELVES. They are one\nphenomenal fact; the tigers are another; and their pointing to the\ntigers is a perfectly commonplace intra-experiential relation, IF\nYOU ONCE GRANT A CONNECTING WORLD TO BE THERE. In short, the ideas\nand the tigers are in themselves as loose and separate, to\nuse Hume’s language, as any two things can be; and pointing means\nhere an operation as external and adventitious as any that\nnature yields.[Footnote: A stone in one field may ’fit,’ we say, a\nhole in another field. But the relation of ’fitting,’ so long as no\none carries the stone to the hole and drops it in, is only one name\nfor the fact that such an act MAY happen. Similarly with the\nknowing of the tigers here and now. It is only an anticipatory\nname for a further associative and terminative process that\nMAY occur.]",
        "I hope you may agree with me now that in representative knowledge\nthere is no special inner mystery, but only an outer chain\nof physical or mental intermediaries connecting thought and thing.\nTO KNOW AN OBJECT IS HERE TO LEAD TO IT THROUGH A CONTEXT WHICH THE\nWORLD SUPPLIES. All this was most instructively set forth by our\ncolleague D. S. Miller at our meeting in New York last Christmas,\nand for re-confirming my sometime wavering opinion, I owe him this\nacknowledgment. [Footnote: See Dr. Miller’s articles on Truth and\nError, and on Content and Function, in the Philosophical Review,\nJuly, 1893, and Nov., 1895.]",
        "Let us next pass on to the case of immediate or intuitive\nacquaintance with an object, and let the object be the white paper\nbefore our eyes. The thought-stuff and the thing-stuff are here\nindistinguishably the same in nature, as we saw a moment since, and\nthere is no context of intermediaries or associates to stand between\nand separate the thought and thing. There is no ’presence in\nabsence’ here, and no ’pointing,’ but rather an allround\nembracing of the paper by the thought; and it is clear that the\nknowing cannot now be explained exactly as it was when the tigers\nwere its object. Dotted all through our experience are states\nof immediate acquaintance just like this. Somewhere our belief\nalways does rest on ultimate data like the whiteness, smoothness, or\nsquareness of this paper. Whether such qualities be truly ultimate\naspects of being, or only provisional suppositions of ours, held-to\ntill we get better informed, is quite immaterial for our present\ninquiry. So long as it is believed in, we see our object face to\nface. What now do we mean by ’knowing’ such a sort of object\nas this? For this is also the way in which we should know the tiger\nif our conceptual idea of him were to terminate by having led us\nto his lair?",
        "This address must not become too long, so I must give my answer in\nthe fewest words. And let me first say this: So far as the white\npaper or other ultimate datum of our experience is considered to\nenter also into some one else’s experience, and we, in knowing it,\nare held to know it there as well as here; so far, again, as it is\nconsidered to be a mere mask for hidden molecules that other now\nimpossible experiences of our own might some day lay bare to view;\nso far it is a case of tigers in India again–the things known\nbeing absent experiences, the knowing can only consist in\npassing smoothly towards them through the intermediary context that\nthe world supplies. But if our own private vision of the paper be\nconsidered in abstraction from every other event, as if it\nconstituted by itself the universe (and it might perfectly well do\nso, for aught we can understand to the contrary), then the\npaper seen and the seeing of it are only two names for one\nindivisible fact which, properly named, is THE DATUM, THE\nPHENOMENON, OR THE EXPERIENCE. The paper is in the mind and the\nmind is around the paper, because paper and mind are only two names\nthat are given later to the one experience, when, taken in a larger\nworld of which it forms a part, its connections are traced in\ndifferent directions. [Footnote: What is meant by this is that ’the\nexperience’ can be referred to either of two great associative\nsystems, that of the experiencer’s mental history, or that of the\nexperienced facts of the world. Of both of these systems it forms\npart, and may be regarded, indeed, as one of their points of\nintersection. One might let a vertical line stand for the mental\nhistory; but the same object, O, appears also in the mental history\nof different persons, represented by the other vertical lines. It\nthus ceases to be the private property of one experience, and\nbecomes, so to speak, a shared or public thing. We can track its\nouter history in this way, and represent it by the horizontal line.\n(It is also known representatively at other points of the\nvertical lines, or intuitively there again, so that the line of its\nouter history would have to be looped and wandering, but I make it\nstraight for simplicity’s sake.)] In any case, however, it is the\nsame stuff figures in all the sets of lines.",
        "TO KNOW IMMEDIATELY, THEN, OR INTUITIVELY, IS FOR MENTAL CONTENT AND\nOBJECT TO BE IDENTICAL. This is a very different definition from\nthat which we gave of representative knowledge; but neither\ndefinition involves those mysterious notions of self-transcendency\nand presence in absence which are such essential parts of the\nideas of knowledge, both of philosophers and of common men.\n[Footnote: The reader will observe that the text is written from the\npoint of view of NAIF realism or common sense, and avoids raising\nthe idealistic controversy.]",
        "[Footnote: Reprinted, with slight\nverbal revision,  from Mind, vol. xiii, N. S., p. 457 (October,\n1904). A couple of interpolations from another article in Mind,\n’Humanism and truth once more,’ in vol. xiv, have been made.]",
        "RECEIVING from the Editor of Mind an advance proof of Mr. Bradley’s\narticle on ’Truth and Practice,’ I understand this as a hint to me\nto join in the controversy over ’Pragmatism’ which seems to have\nseriously begun. As my name has been coupled with the movement, I\ndeem it wise to take the hint, the more so as in some quarters\ngreater credit has been given me than I deserve, and\nprobably undeserved discredit in other quarters falls also to my\nlot.",
        "First, as to the word ’pragmatism.’ I myself have only used the term\nto indicate a method of carrying on abstract discussion. The serious\nmeaning of a concept, says Mr. Peirce, lies in the concrete\ndifference to some one which its being true will make. Strive to\nbring all debated conceptions to that’ pragmatic’ test, and you will\nescape vain wrangling: if it can make no practical difference which\nof two statements be true, then they are really one statement in two\nverbal forms; if it can make no practical difference whether a given\nstatement be true or false, then the statement has no real meaning.\nIn neither case is there anything fit to quarrel about: we may\nsave our breath, and pass to more important things.",
        "All that the pragmatic method implies, then, is that truths should\nHAVE practical [Footnote: ’Practical’ in the sense of PARTICULAR, of\ncourse, not in the sense that the consequences may not be MENTAL as\nwell as physical.] consequences. In England the word has been used\nmore broadly still, to cover the notion that the truth of any\nstatement CONSISTS in the consequences, and particularly in their\nbeing good consequences. Here we get beyond affairs of method\naltogether; and since my pragmatism and this wider pragmatism are\nso different, and both are important enough to have different names,\nI think that Mr. Schiller’s proposal to call the wider pragmatism by\nthe name of ’humanism’ is excellent and ought to be adopted. The\nnarrower pragmatism may still be spoken of as the\n’pragmatic method.’",
        "I have read in the past six months many hostile reviews of\nSchiller’s and Dewey’s publications; but with the exception of Mr.\nBradley’s elaborate indictment, they are out of reach where I write,\nand I have largely forgotten them. I think that a free discussion of\nthe subject on my part would in any case be more useful than a\npolemic attempt at rebutting these criticisms in detail. Mr. Bradley\nin particular can be taken care of by Mr. Schiller. He repeatedly\nconfesses himself unable to comprehend Schiller’s views, he\nevidently has not sought to do so sympathetically, and I\ndeeply regret to say that his laborious article throws, for my mind,\nabsolutely no useful light upon the subject. It seems to me on the\nwhole an IGNORATIO ELENCHI, and I feel free to disregard\nit altogether.",
        "The subject is unquestionably difficult. Messrs. Dewey’s and\nSchiller’s thought is eminently an induction, a generalization\nworking itself free from all sorts of entangling particulars. If\ntrue, it involves much restatement of traditional notions. This is a\nkind of intellectual product that never attains a classic form of\nexpression when first promulgated. The critic ought therefore not to\nbe too sharp and logic-chopping in his dealings with it, but should\nweigh it as a whole, and especially weigh it against its possible\nalternatives. One should also try to apply it first to one instance,\nand then to another to see how it will work. It seems to me that it\nis emphatically not a case for instant execution, by conviction of\nintrinsic absurdity or of self-contradiction, or by caricature of\nwhat it would look like if reduced to skeleton shape. Humanism is in\nfact much more like one of those secular changes that come upon\npublic opinion overnight, as it were, borne upon tides ’too deep for\nsound or foam,’ that survive all the crudities and extravagances of\ntheir advocates, that you can pin to no one absolutely essential\nstatement, nor kill by any one decisive stab.",
        "Such have been the changes from aristocracy to democracy, from\nclassic to romantic taste, from theistic to pantheistic feeling,\nfrom static to evolutionary ways of understanding life–changes of\nwhich we all have been spectators. Scholasticism still opposes to\nsuch changes the method of confutation by single decisive\nreasons, showing that the new view involves self-contradiction, or\ntraverses some fundamental principle. This is like stopping a river\nby planting a stick in the middle of its bed. Round your obstacle\nflows the water and ’gets there all the same.’ In reading some of\nour opponents, I am not a little reminded of those catholic writers\nwho refute darwinism by telling us that higher species cannot come\nfrom lower because minus nequit gignere plus, or that the notion of\ntransformation is absurd, for it implies that species tend to their\nown destruction, and that would violate the principle that\nevery reality tends to persevere in its own shape. The point of view\nis too myopic, too tight and close to take in the inductive\nargument. Wide generalizations in science always meet with these\nsummary refutations in their early days; but they outlive them, and\nthe refutations then sound oddly antiquated and scholastic. I\ncannot help suspecting that the humanistic theory is going through\nthis kind of would-be refutation at present.",
        "The one condition of understanding humanism is to become inductive-\nminded oneself, to drop rigorous definitions, and follow lines\nof least, resistance ’on the whole.’ ’In other words,’ an opponent\nmight say, ’resolve your intellect into a kind of slush.’ ’Even so,’\nI make reply,–’if you will consent to use no politer word.’ For\nhumanism, conceiving the more ’true’ as the more ’satisfactory’\n(Dewey’s term), has sincerely to renounce rectilinear arguments and\nancient ideals of rigor and finality. It is in just this temper of\nrenunciation, so different from that of pyrrhonistic\nscepticism, that the spirit of humanism essentially\nconsists. Satisfactoriness has to be measured by a multitude of\nstandards, of which some, for aught we know, may fail in any given\ncase; and what is more satisfactory than any alternative in sight,\nmay to the end be a sum of PLUSES and MINUSES, concerning which we\ncan only trust that by ulterior corrections and improvements a\nmaximum of the one and a minimum of the other may some day be\napproached. It means a real change of heart, a break with\nabsolutistic hopes, when one takes up this inductive view of the\nconditions of belief.",
        "As I understand the pragmatist way of seeing things, it owes its\nbeing to the break-down which the last fifty years have brought\nabout in the older notions of scientific truth. ’God geometrizes,’\nit used to be said; and it was believed that Euclid’s elements\nliterally reproduced his geometrizing. There is an eternal and\nunchangeable ’reason’; and its voice was supposed to reverberate in\nBarbara and Celarent. So also of the ’laws of nature,’ physical and\nchemical, so of natural history classifications–all were supposed\nto be exact and exclusive duplicates of pre-human archetypes buried\nin the structure of things, to which the spark of divinity hidden in\nour intellect enables us to penetrate. The anatomy of the world\nis logical, and its logic is that of a university professor, it was\nthought. Up to about 1850 almost every one believed that sciences\nexpressed truths that were exact copies of a definite code of non-\nhuman realities. But the enormously rapid multiplication of\ntheories in these latter days has well-nigh upset the notion of any\none of them being a more literally objective kind of thing than\nanother. There are so many geometries, so many logics, so many\nphysical and chemical hypotheses, so many classifications, each one\nof them good for so much and yet not good for everything, that the\nnotion that even the truest formula may be a human device and not a\nliteral transcript has dawned upon us. We hear scientific laws now\ntreated as so much ’conceptual shorthand,’ true so far as they are\nuseful but no farther. Our mind has become tolerant of symbol\ninstead of reproduction, of approximation instead of exactness, of\nplasticity instead of rigor. ’Energetics,’ measuring the bare\nface of sensible phenomena so as to describe in a single formula all\ntheir changes of ’level,’ is the last word of this scientific\nhumanism, which indeed leaves queries enough outstanding as to the\nreason for so curious a congruence between the world and the mind,\nbut which at any rate makes our whole notion of scientific truth\nmore flexible and genial than it used to be.",
        "It is to be doubted whether any theorizer to-day, either in\nmathematics, logic, physics or biology, conceives himself to be\nliterally re-editing processes of nature or thoughts of God. The\nmain forms of our thinking, the separation of subjects from\npredicates, the negative, hypothetic and disjunctive judgments, are\npurely human habits. The ether, as Lord Salisbury said, is only a\nnoun for the verb to undulate; and many of our theological ideas are\nadmitted, even by those who call them ’true,’ to be humanistic in\nlike degree.",
        "I fancy that these changes in the current notions of truth are what\noriginally gave the impulse to Messrs. Dewey’s and Schiller’s views.\nThe suspicion is in the air nowadays that the superiority of one of\nour formulas to another may not consist so much in its\nliteral ’objectivity,’ as in subjective qualities like\nits usefulness, its ’elegance’ or its congruity with our residual\nbeliefs. Yielding to these suspicions, and generalizing, we fall\ninto something like the humanistic state of mind. Truth we conceive\nto mean everywhere, not duplication, but addition; not the\nconstructing of inner copies of already complete realities, but\nrather the collaborating with realities so as to bring about a\nclearer result. Obviously this state of mind is at first full of\nvagueness and ambiguity. ’Collaborating’ is a vague term; it must at\nany rate cover conceptions and logical arrangements. ’Clearer’ is\nvaguer still. Truth must bring clear thoughts, as well as clear\nthe way to action. ’Reality’ is the vaguest term of all. The only\nway to test such a programme at all is to apply it to the various\ntypes of truth, in the hope of reaching an account that shall be\nmore precise. Any hypothesis that forces such a review upon one has\none great merit, even if in the end it prove invalid: it gets\nus better acquainted with the total subject. To give the theory\nplenty of ’rope’ and see if it hangs itself eventually is better\ntactics than to choke it off at the outset by abstract\naccusations of self-contradiction. I think therefore that a decided\neffort at sympathetic mental play with humanism is the provisional\nattitude to be recommended to the reader.",
        "When I find myself playing sympathetically with humanism, something\nlike what follows is what I end by conceiving it to mean.",
        "Experience is a process that continually gives us new material to\ndigest. We handle this intellectually by the mass of beliefs\nof which we find ourselves already possessed, assimilating,\nrejecting, or rearranging in different degrees. Some of the\napperceiving ideas are recent acquisitions of our own, but most of\nthem are common-sense traditions of the race. There is probably not\na common-sense tradition, of all those which we now live by, that\nwas not in the first instance a genuine discovery, an inductive\ngeneralization like those more recent ones of the atom, of inertia,\nof energy, of reflex action, or of fitness to survive The notions of\none Time and of one Space as single continuous receptacles; the\ndistinction between thoughts and things, matter and mind between\npermanent subjects and changing attributes; the conception of\nclasses with sub classes within them; the separation of\nfortuitous from regularly caused connections; surely all these were\nonce definite conquests made at historic dates by our ancestors in\ntheir attempt to get the chaos of their crude individual experiences\ninto a more shareable and manageable shape. They proved of such\nsovereign use as denkmittel that they are now a part of the very\nstructure of our mind. We cannot play fast and loose with them. No\nexperience can upset them. On the contrary, they apperceive every\nexperience and assign it to its place.",
        "To what effect? That we may the better foresee the course of our\nexperiences, communicate with one another, and steer our lives by\nrule. Also that we may have a cleaner, clearer, more inclusive\nmental view.",
        "The greatest common-sense achievement, after the discovery of one\nTime and one Space, is probably the concept of permanently\nexisting things. When a rattle first drops out of the hand of a\nbaby, he does not look to see where it has gone. Non-perception he\naccepts as annihilation until he finds a better belief. That our\nperceptions mean BEINGS, rattles that are there whether we hold them\nin our hands or not, becomes an interpretation so luminous of what\nhappens to us that, once employed, it never gets forgotten. It\napplies with equal felicity to things and persons, to the\nobjective and to the ejective realm. However a Berkeley, a Mill, or\na Cornelius may CRITICISE it, it WORKS; and in practical life we\nnever think of ’going back’ upon it, or reading our\nincoming experiences in any other terms. We may,\nindeed, speculatively imagine a state of ’pure’ experience before\nthe hypothesis of permanent objects behind its flux had been framed;\nand we can play with the idea that some primeval genius might have\nstruck into a different hypothesis. But we cannot positively\nimagine today what the different hypothesis could have been, for the\ncategory of trans-perceptual reality is now one of the foundations\nof our life. Our thoughts must still employ it if they are to\npossess reasonableness and truth.",
        "This notion of a FIRST in the shape of a most chaotic pure\nexperience which sets us questions, of a SECOND in the way of\nfundamental categories, long ago wrought into the structure of our\nconsciousness and practically irreversible, which define the general\nframe within which answers must fall, and of a THIRD which gives the\ndetail of the answers in the shapes most congruous with all our\npresent needs, is, as I take it, the essence of the\nhumanistic conception. It represents experience in its\npristine purity to be now so enveloped in predicates historically\nworked out that we can think of it as little more than an OTHER, of\na THAT, which the mind, in Mr. Bradley’s phrase, ’encounters,’ and\nto whose stimulating presence we respond by ways of thinking which\nwe call ’true’ in proportion as they facilitate our mental or\nphysical activities and bring us outer power and inner peace. But\nwhether the Other, the universal THAT, has itself any definite inner\nstructure, or whether, if it have any, the structure resembles any\nof our predicated WHATS, this is a question which humanism leaves\nuntouched. For us, at any rate, it insists, reality is an\naccumulation of our own intellectual inventions, and the struggle\nfor ’truth’ in our progressive dealings with it is always a struggle\nto work in new nouns and adjectives while altering as little as\npossible the old.",
        " It is hard to see why either Mr. Bradley’s own logic or his\nmetaphysics should oblige him to quarrel with this conception. He\nmight consistently adopt it verbatim et literatim, if he would, and\nsimply throw his peculiar absolute round it, following in this the\ngood example of Professor Royce. Bergson in France, and his\ndisciples, Wilbois the physicist and Leroy, are thoroughgoing\nhumanists in the sense defined. Professor Milhaud also appears to be\none; and the great Poincare misses it by only the breadth of a hair.\nIn Germany the name of Simmel offers itself as that of a humanist of\nthe most radical sort. Mach and his school, and Hertz and Ostwald\nmust be classed as humanists. The view is in the atmosphere and must\nbe patiently discussed.",
        " The best way to discuss it would be to see what the alternative\nmight be. What is it indeed? Its critics make no explicit\nstatement, Professor Royce being the only one so far who has\nformulated anything definite. The first service of humanism to\nphilosophy accordingly seems to be that it will probably oblige\nthose who dislike it to search their own hearts and heads. It will\nforce analysis to the front and make it the order of the day. At\npresent the lazy tradition that truth is adaequatio intellectus et\nrei seems all there is to contradict it with. Mr. Bradley’s only\nsuggestion is that true thought ’must correspond to a\ndeterminate being which it cannot be said to make,’ and obviously\nthat sheds no new light. What is the meaning of the word to\n’correspond’? Where is the ’being’? What sort of things are\n’determinations,’ and what is meant in this particular case by ’not\nto make’?",
        "Humanism proceeds immediately to refine upon the looseness of these\nepithets. We correspond in SOME way with anything with which we\nenter into any relations at all. If it be a thing, we may produce an\nexact copy of it, or we may simply feel it as an existent in a\ncertain place. If it be a demand, we may obey it without knowing\nanything more about it than its push. If it be a proposition, we may\nagree by not contradicting it, by letting it pass. If it be a\nrelation between things, we may act on the first thing so as to\nbring ourselves out where the second will be. If it be\nsomething inaccessible, we may substitute a hypothetical object for\nit, which, having the same consequences, will cipher out for us real\nresults. In a general way we may simply ADD OUR THOUGHT TO IT; and\nif it SUFFERS THE ADDITION, and the whole situation harmoniously\nprolongs and enriches itself, the thought will pass for true.",
        "As for the whereabouts of the beings thus corresponded to, although\nthey may be outside of the present thought as well as in it,\nhumanism sees no ground for saying they are outside of finite\nexperience itself. Pragmatically, their reality means that we submit\nto them, take account of them, whether we like to or not, but this\nwe must perpetually do with experiences other than our own. The\nwhole system of what the present experience must correspond to\n’adequately’ may be continuous with the present experience itself.\nReality, so taken as experience other than the present, might be\neither the legacy of past experience or the content of experience to\ncome. Its determinations for US are in any case the adjectives which\nour acts of judging fit to it, and those are essentially humanistic\nthings.",
        "To say that our thought does not ’make’ this reality means\npragmatically that if our own particular thought were annihilated\nthe reality would still be there in some shape, though possibly it\nmight be a shape that would lack something that our thought\nsupplies. That reality is ’independent’ means that there is\nsomething in every experience that escapes our arbitrary control. If\nit be a sensible experience it coerces our attention; if a sequence,\nwe cannot invert it; if we compare two terms we can come to only one\nresult. There is a push, an urgency, within our very experience,\nagainst which we are on the whole powerless, and which drives us in\na direction that is the destiny of our belief. That this drift of\nexperience itself is in the last resort due to something independent\nof all possible experience may or may not be true. There may or may\nnot be an extra-experiential ’ding an sich’ that keeps the ball\nrolling, or an ’absolute’ that lies eternally behind all the\nsuccessive determinations which human thought has made. But\nwithin our experience ITSELF, at any rate, humanism says, some\ndeterminations show themselves as being independent of others; some\nquestions, if we ever ask them, can only be answered in one way;\nsome beings, if we ever suppose them, must be supposed to have\nexisted previously to the supposing; some relations, if they exist\never, must exist as long as their terms exist.",
        "Truth thus means, according to humanism, the relation of less fixed\nparts of experience (predicates) to other relatively more fixed\nparts (subjects); and we are not required to seek it in a relation\nof experience as such to anything beyond itself. We can stay at\nhome, for our behavior as exponents is hemmed in on every side. The\nforces both of advance and of resistance are exerted by our own\nobjects, and the notion of truth as something opposed to waywardness\nor license inevitably grows up SOLIPSISTICALLY inside of every human\nlife.",
        " So obvious is all this that a common charge against the humanistic\nauthors ’makes me tired.’ ’How can a deweyite discriminate sincerity\nfrom bluff?’ was a question asked at a philosophic meeting where I\nreported on Dewey’s Studies. ’How can the mere [Footnote: I know of\nno ’mere’ pragmatist, if MERENESS here means, as it seems to, the\ndenial of all concreteness to the pragmatist’s THOUGHT.] pragmatist\nfeel any duty to think truly?’ is the objection urged by Professor\nRoyce. Mr. Bradley in turn says that if a humanist understands his\nown doctrine, ’he must hold any idea, however mad, to be the truth,\nif any one will have it so.’ And Professor Taylor\ndescribes pragmatism as believing anything one pleases and calling\nit truth.",
        "Such a shallow sense of the conditions under which men’s thinking\nactually goes on seems to me most surprising. These critics appear\nto suppose that, if left to itself, the rudderless raft of our\nexperience must be ready to drift anywhere or nowhere. Even\nTHO there were compasses on board, they seem to say, there would be\nno pole for them to point to. There must be absolute sailing-\ndirections, they insist, decreed from outside, and an\nindependent chart of the voyage added to the ’mere’ voyage itself,\nif we are ever to make a port. But is it not obvious that even\nTHO there be such absolute sailing-directions in the shape of pre-\nhuman standards of truth that we OUGHT to follow, the only\nguarantee that we shall in fact follow them must lie in our human\nequipment. The ’ought’ would be a brutum fulmen unless there were a\nfelt grain inside of our experience that conspired. As a matter of\nfact the DEVOUTEST believers in absolute standards must admit that\nmen fail to obey them. Waywardness is here, in spite of the eternal\nprohibitions, and the existence of any amount of reality ante rem is\nno warrant against unlimited error in rebus being incurred. The only\nREAL guarantee we have against licentious thinking is the\nCIRCUMPRESSURE of experience itself, which gets us sick of\nconcrete errors, whether there be a trans-empirical reality or not.\nHow does the partisan of absolute reality know what this orders him\nto think? He cannot get direct sight of the absolute; and he has no\nmeans of guessing what it wants of him except by following the\nhumanistic clues. The only truth that he himself will ever\npractically ACCEPT will be that to which his finite experiences lead\nhim of themselves. The state of mind which shudders at the idea of a\nlot of experiences left to themselves, and that augurs protection\nfrom the sheer name of an absolute, as if, however inoperative,\nthat might still stand for a sort of ghostly security, is like the\nmood of those good people who, whenever they hear of a social\ntendency that is damnable, begin to redden and to puff, and say\n’Parliament or Congress ought to make a law against it,’ as if an\nimpotent decree would give relief.",
        "All the SANCTIONS of a law of truth lie in the very texture of\nexperience. Absolute or no absolute, the concrete truth FOR US will\nalways be that way of thinking in which our various experiences most\nprofitably combine.",
        "And yet, the opponent obstinately urges, your humanist will always\nhave a greater liberty to play fast and loose with truth than\nwill your believer in an independent realm of reality that makes the\nstandard rigid. If by this latter believer he means a man who\npretends to know the standard and who fulminates it, the humanist\nwill doubtless prove more flexible; but no more flexible than the\nabsolutist himself if the latter follows (as fortunately\nour present-day absolutists do follow) empirical methods of inquiry\nin concrete affairs. To consider hypotheses is surely always better\nthan to DOGMATISE ins blaue hinein.",
        "Nevertheless this probable flexibility of temper in him has been\nused to convict the humanist of sin. Believing as he does, that\ntruth lies in rebus, and is at every moment our own line of most\npropitious reaction, he stands forever debarred, as I have heard a\nlearned colleague say, from trying to convert opponents, for does\nnot their view, being THEIR most propitious momentary reaction,\nalready fill the bill? Only the believer in the ante-rem brand of\ntruth can on this theory seek to make converts without self-\nstultification. But can there be self-stultification in urging any\naccount whatever of truth? Can the definition ever contradict the\ndeed? ’Truth is what I feel like saying’–suppose that to be the\ndefinition. ’Well, I feel like saying that, and I want you to feel\nlike saying it, and shall continue to say it until I get you to\nagree.’ Where is there any contradiction? Whatever truth may be\nsaid to be, that is the kind of truth which the saying can be held\nto carry. The TEMPER which a saying may comport is an extra-logical\nmatter. It may indeed be hotter in some individual absolutist than\nin a humanist, but it need not be so in another. And the humanist,\nfor his part, is perfectly consistent in compassing sea and land to\nmake one proselyte, if his nature be enthusiastic enough.",
        "’But how can you be enthusiastic over any view of things which you\nknow to have been partly made by yourself, and which is liable to\nalter during the next minute? How is any heroic devotion to the\nideal of truth possible under such paltry conditions?’",
        "This is just another of those objections by which the anti-humanists\nshow their own comparatively slack hold on the realities of\nthe situation. If they would only follow the pragmatic method and\nask: ’What is truth KNOWN-AS? What does its existence stand for in\nthe way of concrete goods?’–they would see that the name of it is\nthe inbegriff of almost everything that is valuable in our lives.\nThe true is the opposite of whatever is instable, of whatever is\npractically disappointing, of whatever is useless, of whatever is\nlying and unreliable, of whatever is unverifiable and\nunsupported, of whatever is inconsistent and contradictory, of\nwhatever is artificial and eccentric, of whatever is unreal in the\nsense of being of no practical account. Here are pragmatic reasons\nwith a vengeance why we should turn to truth–truth saves us from a\nworld of that complexion. What wonder that its very name awakens\nloyal feeling! In particular what wonder that all little provisional\nfool’s paradises of belief should appear contemptible in comparison\nwith its bare pursuit! When absolutists reject humanism because they\nfeel it to be untrue, that means that the whole habit of their\nmental needs is wedded already to a different view of reality, in\ncomparison with which the humanistic world seems but the whim of a\nfew irresponsible youths. Their own subjective apperceiving mass is\nwhat speaks here in the name of the eternal natures and bids them\nreject our humanism–as they apprehend it. Just so with us\nhumanists, when we condemn all noble, clean-cut, fixed,\neternal, rational, temple-like systems of philosophy. These\ncontradict the DRAMATIC TEMPERAMENT of nature, as our dealings with\nnature and our habits of thinking have so far brought us to conceive\nit. They seem oddly personal and artificial, even when not\nbureaucratic and professional in an absurd degree. We turn from them\nto the great unpent and unstayed wilderness of truth as we feel it\nto be constituted, with as good a conscience as rationalists\nare moved by when they turn from our wilderness into their neater\nand cleaner intellectual abodes. [Footnote: I cannot forbear quoting\nas an illustration of the contrast between humanist and rationalist\ntempers of mind, in a sphere remote from philosophy, these remarks\non the Dreyfus ’affaire,’ written by one who assuredly had\nnever heard of humanism or pragmatism. ’Autant que la Revolution,\n\"l’Affaire” est desormais une de nos “origines.” Si elle n’a pas\nfait ouvrir le gouffre, c’est elle du moins qui a rendu patent et\nvisible le long travail souterrain qui, silencieusement,\navait prepare la separation entre nos deux camps d’aujourd’hui, pour\necarter enfin, d’un coup soudain, la France des traditionalistes\n(poseurs de principes, chercheurs d’unite, constructeurs de systemes\na priori) el la France eprise du fait positif et de libre examen;–\nla France revolutionnaire et romantique si l’on veut, celle qui met\ntres haut l’individu, qui ne veut pas qu’un juste perisse, fut-ce\npour sauver la nation, et qui cherche la verite dans toutes ses\nparties aussi bien que dans une vue d’ensemble ... Duclaux ne\npouvait pas concevoir qu’on preferat quelque chose a la verite.\nMais il voyait autour de lui de fort honnetes gens qui, mettant\nen balance la vie d’un homme et la raison d’Etat, lui avouaient de\nquel poids leger ils jugeaient une simple existence\nindividuelle, pour innocente qu’elle fut. C’etaient des\nclassiques, des gens a qui l’ensemble seul importe.’ La Vie de\nEmile Duclaux, par Mme. Em. D., Laval, 1906, pp. 243, 247-248.]",
        "This is surely enough to show that the humanist does not ignore the\ncharacter of objectivity and independence in truth. Let me turn next\nto what his opponents mean when they say that to be true, our\nthoughts must ’correspond.’",
        "The vulgar notion of correspondence here is that the thoughts must\nCOPY the reality–cognitio fit per assimiliationem cogniti\net cognoscentis; and philosophy, without having ever fairly sat down\nto the question, seems to have instinctively accepted this idea:\npropositions are held true if they copy the eternal thought; terms\nare held true if they copy extra-mental realities. Implicitly, I\nthink that the copy-theory has animated most of the criticisms\nthat have been made on humanism.",
        "A priori, however, it is not self-evident that the sole business of\nour mind with realities should be to copy them. Let my reader\nsuppose himself to constitute for a time all the reality there is in\nthe universe, and then to receive the announcement that another\nbeing is to be created who shall know him truly. How will he\nrepresent the knowing in advance? What will he hope it to be? I\ndoubt extremely whether it could ever occur to him to fancy it as a\nmere copying. Of what use to him would an imperfect second edition\nof himself in the new comer’s interior be? It would seem pure waste\nof a propitious opportunity. The demand would more probably be for\nsomething absolutely new. The reader would conceive the knowing\nhumanistically, ’the new comer,’ he would say, ’must TAKE ACCOUNT OF\nMY PRESENCE BY REACTING ON IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT GOOD WOULD ACCRUE\nTO US BOTH. If copying be requisite to that end, let there be\ncopying; otherwise not.’ The essence in any case would not be\nthe copying, but the enrichment of the previous world.",
        "I read the other day, in a book of Professor Eucken’s, a phrase,\n’Die erhohung des vorgefundenen daseins,’ which seems to\nbe pertinent here. Why may not thought’s mission be to increase and\nelevate, rather than simply to imitate and reduplicate, existence?\nNo one who has read Lotze can fail to remember his striking comment\non the ordinary view of the secondary qualities of matter, which\nbrands them as ’illusory’ because they copy nothing in the thing.\nThe notion of a world complete in itself, to which thought comes as\na passive mirror, adding nothing to fact, Lotze says is irrational.\nRather is thought itself a most momentous part of fact, and the\nwhole mission of the pre-existing and insufficient world of matter\nmay simply be to provoke thought to produce its far more precious\nsupplement.",
        "’Knowing,’ in short, may, for aught we can see beforehand to the\ncontrary, be ONLY ONE WAY OF GETTING INTO FRUITFUL RELATIONS WITH\nREALITY whether copying be one of the relations or not.",
        "It is easy to see from what special type of knowing the copy-theory\narose. In our dealings with natural phenomena the great point is to\nbe able to foretell. Foretelling, according to such a writer as\nSpencer, is the whole meaning of intelligence. When Spencer’s ’law\nof intelligence’ says that inner and outer relations must\n’correspond,’ it means that the distribution of terms in our inner\ntime-scheme and space-scheme must be an exact copy of\nthe distribution in real time and space of the real terms. In strict\ntheory the mental terms themselves need not answer to the real terms\nin the sense of severally copying them, symbolic mental terms being\nenough, if only the real dates and places be copied. But in our\nordinary life the mental terms are images and the real ones are\nsensations, and the images so often copy the sensations, that we\neasily take copying of terms as well as of relations to be the\nnatural significance of knowing. Meanwhile much, even of this common\ndescriptive truth, is couched in verbal symbols. If our symbols\nFIT the world, in the sense of determining our expectations rightly,\nthey may even be the better for not copying its terms.",
        "It seems obvious that the pragmatic account of all this routine of\nphenomenal knowledge is accurate. Truth here is a relation, not\nof our ideas to non-human realities, but of conceptual parts of our\nexperience to sensational parts. Those thoughts are true which\nguide us to BENEFICIAL INTERACTION with sensible particulars as they\noccur, whether they copy these in advance or not.",
        "From the frequency of copying in the knowledge of phenomenal fact,\ncopying has been supposed to be the essence of truth in\nmatters rational also. Geometry and logic, it has been supposed,\nmust copy archetypal thoughts in the Creator. But in these abstract\nspheres there is no need of assuming archetypes. The mind is free to\ncarve so many figures out of space, to make so many numerical\ncollections, to frame so many classes and series, and it can analyze\nand compare so endlessly, that the very superabundance of the\nresulting ideas makes us doubt the ’objective’ pre-existence of\ntheir models. It would be plainly wrong to suppose a God whose\nthought consecrated rectangular but not polar co-ordinates, or\nJevons’s notation but not Boole’s. Yet if, on the other hand, we\nassume God to have thought in advance of every POSSIBLE flight of\nhuman fancy in these directions, his mind becomes too much like\na Hindoo idol with three heads, eight arms and six breasts, too much\nmade up of superfoetation and redundancy for us to wish to copy it,\nand the whole notion of copying tends to evaporate from these\nsciences. Their objects can be better interpreted as being created\nstep by step by men, as fast as they successively conceive them.",
        "If now it be asked how, if triangles, squares, square roots, genera,\nand the like, are but improvised human ’artefacts,’ their\nproperties and relations can be so promptly known to be ’eternal,’\nthe humanistic answer is easy. If triangles and genera are of our\nown production we can keep them invariant. We can make them\n’timeless’ by expressly decreeing that on THE THINGS WE MEAN time\nshall exert no altering effect, that they are intentionally and it\nmay be fictitiously abstracted from every corrupting real associate\nand condition. But relations between invariant objects will\nthemselves be invariant. Such relations cannot be happenings, for by\nhypothesis nothing shall happen to the objects. I have tried to\nshow in the last chapter of my Principles of Psychology [Footnote:\nVol. ii, pp. 641 ff.] that they can only be relations of comparison.\nNo one so far seems to have noticed my suggestion, and I am too\nignorant of the development of mathematics to feel very confident of\nmy own view. But if it were correct it would solve the difficulty\nperfectly. Relations of comparison are matters of direct inspection.\nAs soon as mental objects are mentally compared, they are perceived\nto be either like or unlike. But once the same, always the same,\nonce different, always different, under these timeless conditions.\nWhich is as much as to say that truths concerning these man-made\nobjects are necessary and eternal. We can change our conclusions\nonly by changing our data first.",
        "The whole fabric of the a priori sciences can thus be treated as a\nman-made product. As Locke long ago pointed out, these sciences have\nno immediate connection with fact. Only IF a fact can be humanized\nby being identified with any of these ideal objects, is what\nwas true of the objects now true also of the facts. The truth itself\nmeanwhile was originally a copy of nothing; it was only a relation\ndirectly perceived to obtain between two artificial mental\nthings. [Footnote: Mental things which are realities of course\nwithin the mental world.]",
        "We may now glance at some special types of knowing, so as to see\nbetter whether the humanistic account fits. On the mathematical and\nlogical types we need not enlarge further, nor need we return at\nmuch length to the case of our descriptive knowledge of the course\nof nature. So far as this involves anticipation, tho that MAY mean\ncopying, it need, as we saw, mean little more than ’getting ready’\nin advance. But with many distant and future objects, our practical\nrelations are to the last degree potential and remote. In no sense\ncan we now get ready for the arrest of the earth’s revolution by the\ntidal brake, for instance; and with the past, tho we suppose\nourselves to know it truly, we have no practical relations at all.\nIt is obvious that, altho interests strictly practical have been the\noriginal starting-point of our search for true\nphenomenal descriptions, yet an intrinsic interest in the bare\ndescribing function has grown up. We wish accounts that shall be\ntrue, whether they bring collateral profit or not. The\nprimitive function has developed its demand for mere exercise. This\ntheoretic curiosity seems to be the characteristically human\ndifferentia, and humanism recognizes its enormous scope. A true idea\nnow means not only one that prepares us for an actual perception. It\nmeans also one that might prepare us for a merely possible\nperception, or one that, if spoken, would suggest possible\nperceptions to others, or suggest actual perceptions which the\nspeaker cannot share. The ensemble of perceptions thus thought of as\neither actual or possible form a system which it is obviously\nadvantageous to us to get into a stable and consistent shape; and\nhere it is that the common-sense notion of permanent beings finds\ntriumphant use. Beings acting outside of the thinker explain, not\nonly his actual perceptions, past and future, but his possible\nperceptions and those of every one else. Accordingly they gratify\nour theoretic need in a supremely beautiful way. We pass from our\nimmediate actual through them into the foreign and the potential,\nand back again into the future actual, accounting for innumerable\nparticulars by a single cause. As in those circular panoramas, where\na real foreground of dirt, grass, bushes, rocks and a broken-down\ncannon is enveloped by a canvas picture of sky and earth and of a\nraging battle, continuing the foreground so cunningly that the\nspectator can detect no joint; so these conceptual objects, added to\nour present perceptual reality, fuse with it into the whole\nuniverse of our belief. In spite of all berkeleyan criticism, we do\nnot doubt that they are really there. Tho our discovery of any one\nof them may only date from now, we unhesitatingly say that it not\nonly IS, but WAS there, if, by so saying, the past appears connected\nmore consistently with what we feel the present to be. This is\nhistoric truth. Moses wrote the Pentateuch, we think, because if he\ndidn’t, all our religious habits will have to be undone. Julius\nCaesar was real, or we can never listen to history again. Trilobites\nwere once alive, or all our thought about the strata is at\nsea. Radium, discovered only yesterday, must always have existed, or\nits analogy with other natural elements, which are permanent, fails.\nIn all this, it is but one portion of our beliefs reacting on\nanother so as to yield the most satisfactory total state of mind.\nThat state of mind, we say, sees truth, and the content of its\ndeliverances we believe.",
        "Of course, if you take the satisfactoriness concretely, as something\nfelt by you now, and if, by truth, you mean truth taken\nabstractly and verified in the long run, you cannot make them\nequate, for it is notorious that the temporarily satisfactory is\noften false. Yet at each and every concrete moment, truth for\neach man is what that man ’troweth’ at that moment with the maximum\nof satisfaction to himself; and similarly, abstract truth, truth\nverified by the long run, and abstract satisfactoriness, long-run\nsatisfactoriness, coincide. If, in short, we compare concrete with\nconcrete and abstract with abstract, the true and the\nsatisfactory do mean the same thing. I suspect that a certain\nmuddling of matters hereabouts is what makes the general philosophic\npublic so impervious to humanism’s claims.",
        "The fundamental fact about our experience is that it is a process of\nchange. For the ’trower’ at any moment, truth, like the visible area\nround a man walking in a fog, or like what George Eliot calls ’the\nwall of dark seen by small fishes’ eyes that pierce a span in the\nwide Ocean,’ is an objective field which the next moment enlarges\nand of which it is the critic, and which then either suffers\nalteration or is continued unchanged. The critic sees both the first\ntrower’s truth and his own truth, compares them with each other, and\nverifies or confutes. HIS field of view is the reality independent\nof that earlier trower’s thinking with which that thinking ought to\ncorrespond. But the critic is himself only a trower; and if the\nwhole process of experience should terminate at that instant, there\nwould be no otherwise known independent reality with which HIS\nthought might be compared.",
        "The immediate in experience is always provisionally in this\nsituation. The humanism, for instance, which I see and try so\nhard to defend, is the completest truth attained from my point of\nview up to date. But, owing to the fact that all experience is a\nprocess, no point of view can ever be THE last one. Every one is\ninsufficient and off its balance, and responsible to later points of\nview than itself. You, occupying some of these later points in your\nown person, and believing in the reality of others, will not agree\nthat my point of view sees truth positive, truth timeless, truth\nthat counts, unless they verify and confirm what it sees.",
        "You generalize this by saying that any opinion, however\nsatisfactory, can count positively and absolutely as true only so\nfar as it agrees with a standard beyond itself; and if you then\nforget that this standard perpetually grows up endogenously inside\nthe web of the experiences, you may carelessly go on to say that\nwhat distributively holds of each experience, holds also\ncollectively of all experience, and that experience as such and in\nits totality owes whatever truth it may be possessed-of to its\ncorrespondence with absolute realities outside of its own being.\nThis evidently is the popular and traditional position. From\nthe fact that finite experiences must draw support from one another,\nphilosophers pass to the notion that experience uberhaupt must\nneed an absolute support. The denial of such a notion by humanism\nlies probably at the root of most of the dislike which it incurs.",
        "But is this not the globe, the elephant and the tortoise over again?\nMust not something end by supporting itself? Humanism is willing to\nlet finite experience be self-supporting. Somewhere being must\nimmediately breast nonentity. Why may not the advancing front of\nexperience, carrying its immanent satisfactions and\ndissatisfactions, cut against the black inane as the luminous orb of\nthe moon cuts the caerulean abyss? Why should anywhere the world be\nabsolutely fixed and finished? And if reality genuinely grows,\nwhy may it not grow in these very determinations which here and now\nare made?",
        "In point of fact it actually seems to grow by our mental\ndeterminations, be these never so ’true.’ Take the ’great bear’ or\n’dipper’ constellation in the heavens. We call it by that name, we\ncount the stars and call them seven, we say they were seven before\nthey were counted, and we say that whether any one had ever noted\nthe fact or not, the dim resemblance to a long-tailed (or long-\nnecked?) animal was always truly there. But what do we mean by this\nprojection into past eternity of recent human ways of thinking? Did\nan ’absolute’ thinker actually do the counting, tell off the stars\nupon his standing number-tally, and make the bear-comparison, silly\nas the latter is? Were they explicitly seven, explicitly bear-like,\nbefore the human witness came? Surely nothing in the truth of\nthe attributions drives us to think this. They were only implicitly\nor virtually what we call them, and we human witnesses first\nexplicated them and made them ’real.’ A fact virtually pre-exists\nwhen every condition of its realization save one is already there.\nIn this case the condition lacking is the act of the counting and\ncomparing mind. But the stars (once the mind considers them)\nthemselves dictate the result. The counting in no wise modifies\ntheir previous nature, and, they being what and where they are, the\ncount cannot fall out differently. It could then ALWAYS be\nmade. NEVER could the number seven be questioned, IF THE QUESTION\nONCE WERE RAISED.",
        "We have here a quasi-paradox. Undeniably something comes by the\ncounting that was not there before. And yet that something was\nALWAYS TRUE. In one sense you create it, and in another sense you\nFIND it. You have to treat your count as being true beforehand, the\nmoment you come to treat the matter at all.",
        "Our stellar attributes must always be called true, then; yet none\nthe less are they genuine additions made by our intellect to the\nworld of fact. Not additions of consciousness only, but additions of\n’content.’ They copy nothing that pre-existed, yet they agree with\nwhat pre-existed, fit it, amplify it, relate and connect it with a\n’wain,’ a number-tally, or what not, and build it out. It seems to\nme that humanism is the only theory that builds this case out in the\ngood direction, and this case stands for innumerable other kinds of\ncase. In all such eases, odd as it may sound, our judgment may\nactually be said to retroact and to enrich the past.",
        "Our judgments at any rate change the character of FUTURE reality by\nthe acts to which they lead. Where these acts are acts expressive\nof trust,–trust, e.g., that a man is honest, that our health is\ngood enough, or that we can make a successful effort,–which\nacts may be a needed antecedent of the trusted things becoming true.\nProfessor Taylor says [Footnote: In an article criticising\nPragmatism (as he conceives it) in the McGill University\nQuarterly published at Montreal, for May, 1904.] that our trust is\nat any rate UNTRUE WHEN IT IS MADE, i. e; before the action; and I\nseem to remember that he disposes of anything like a faith in the\ngeneral excellence of the universe (making the faithful person’s\npart in it at any rate more excellent) as a ’lie in the soul.’\nBut the pathos of this expression should not blind us to the\ncomplication of the facts. I doubt whether Professor Taylor would\nhimself be in favor of practically handling trusters of these kinds\nas liars. Future and present really mix in such emergencies, and one\ncan always escape lies in them by using hypothetic forms. But Mr.\nTaylor’s attitude suggests such absurd possibilities of practice\nthat it seems to me to illustrate beautifully how self-\nstultifying the conception of a truth that shall merely register a\nstanding fixture may become. Theoretic truth, truth of passive\ncopying, sought in the sole interests of copying as such, not\nbecause copying is GOOD FOR SOMETHING, but because copying ought\nschlechthin to be, seems, if you look at it coldly, to be an\nalmost preposterous ideal. Why should the universe, existing in\nitself, also exist in copies? How CAN it be copied in the solidity\nof its objective fulness? And even if it could, what would\nthe motive be? ’Even the hairs of your head are numbered.’ Doubtless\nthey are, virtually; but why, as an absolute proposition, OUGHT the\nnumber to become copied and known? Surely knowing is only one way of\ninteracting with reality and adding to its effect.",
        "The opponent here will ask: ’Has not the knowing of truth any\nsubstantive value on its own account, apart from the collateral\nadvantages it may bring? And if you allow theoretic satisfactions to\nexist at all, do they not crowd the collateral satisfactions out of\nhouse and home, and must not pragmatism go into bankruptcy, if she\nadmits them at all?’ The destructive force of such talk disappears\nas soon as we use words concretely instead of abstractly, and ask,\nin our quality of good pragmatists, just what the famous\ntheoretic needs are known as and in what the\nintellectual satisfactions consist.",
        "Are they not all mere matters of CONSISTENCY–and emphatically NOT\nof consistency between an absolute reality and the mind’s copies of\nit, but of actually felt consistency among judgments, objects, and\nhabits of reacting, in the mind’s own experienceable world? And\nare not both our need of such consistency and our pleasure in it\nconceivable as outcomes of the natural fact that we are beings that\ndo develop mental HABITS–habit itself proving adaptively beneficial\nin an environment where the same objects, or the same kinds of\nobjects, recur and follow ’law’? If this were so, what would have\ncome first would have been the collateral profits of habit as such,\nand the theoretic life would have grown up in aid of these. In point\nof fact, this seems to have been the probable case. At life’s\norigin, any present perception may have been ’true’–if such a\nword could then be applicable. Later, when reactions became\norganized, the reactions became ’true’ whenever expectation was\nfulfilled by them. Otherwise they were ’false’ or ’mistaken’\nreactions. But the same class of objects needs the same kind of\nreaction, so the impulse to react consistently must gradually have\nbeen established, and a disappointment felt whenever the results\nfrustrated expectation. Here is a perfectly plausible germ for all\nour higher consistencies. Nowadays, if an object claims from us a\nreaction of the kind habitually accorded only to the opposite class\nof objects, our mental machinery refuses to run smoothly. The\nsituation is intellectually unsatisfactory.",
        "Theoretic truth thus falls WITHIN the mind, being the accord of some\nof its processes and objects with other processes and objects–\n ’accord’ consisting here in well-definable relations. So long as\nthe satisfaction of feeling such an accord is denied us, whatever\ncollateral profits may seem to inure from what we believe in are but\nas dust in the balance–provided always that we are highly\norganized intellectually, which the majority of us are not. The\namount of accord which satisfies most men and women is merely the\nabsence of violent clash between their usual thoughts and\nstatements and the limited sphere of sense-perceptions in which\ntheir lives are cast. The theoretic truth that most of us think we\n’ought’ to attain to is thus the possession of a set of predicates\nthat do not explicitly contradict their subjects. We preserve it as\noften as not by leaving other predicates and subjects out.",
        "In some men theory is a passion, just as music is in others. The\nform of inner consistency is pursued far beyond the line at\nwhich collateral profits stop. Such men systematize and classify and\nschematize and make synoptical tables and invent ideal objects for\nthe pure love of unifying. Too often the results, glowing with\n’truth’ for the inventors, seem pathetically personal and artificial\nto bystanders. Which is as much as to say that the purely theoretic\ncriterion of truth can leave us in the lurch as easily as any other\ncriterion, and that the absolutists, for all their pretensions,\nare ’in the same boat’ concretely with those whom they attack.",
        "I am well aware that this paper has been rambling in the extreme.\nBut the whole subject is inductive, and sharp logic is hardly yet in\norder. My great trammel has been the non-existence of any\ndefinitely stated alternative on my opponents’ part. It may conduce\nto clearness if I recapitulate, in closing, what I conceive the main\npoints of humanism to be. They are these:–",
        "1. An experience, perceptual or conceptual, must conform to reality\nin order to be true.",
        "2. By ’reality’ humanism means nothing more than the other\nconceptual or perceptual experiences with which a given present\nexperience may find itself in point of fact mixed up.\n[Footnote: This is meant merely to exclude reality of an\n’unknowable’ sort, of which no account in either perceptual\nor conceptual terms can be given. It includes of course any\namount if empirical reality independent of the knower.\nPragmatism, is thus ’epistemologically’ realistic in its account.]",
        "3. By ’conforming,’ humanism means taking account-of in such a way\nas to gain any intellectually and practically satisfactory result.",
        "4. To ’take account-of’ and to be ’satisfactory’ are terms that\nadmit of no definition, so many are the ways in which these\nrequirements can practically be worked out.",
        "5. Vaguely and in general, we take account of a reality by\npreserving it in as unmodified a form as possible. But, to be then\nsatisfactory, it must not contradict other realities outside of it\nwhich claim also to be preserved. That we must preserve all the\nexperience we can and minimize contradiction in what we preserve, is\nabout all that can be said in advance.",
        "6. The truth which the conforming experience embodies may be a\npositive addition to the previous reality, and later judgments\nmay have to conform to it. Yet, virtually at least, it may have been\ntrue previously. Pragmatically, virtual and actual truth mean the\nsame thing: the possibility of only one answer, when once the\nquestion is raised.",
        "[Footnote: Extract from an article entitled ’A World of Pure\nExperience,’ in the Journal of Philosophy, etc., September 29,1904.]",
        " Throughout the history of philosophy the subject and its object\nhave been treated as absolutely discontinuous entities; and\nthereupon the presence of the latter to the former, or\nthe ’apprehension’ by the former of the latter, has assumed a\nparadoxical character which all sorts of theories had to be invented\nto overcome. Representative theories put a mental ’representation,’\n’image,’ or ’content’ into the gap, as a sort of intermediary.\nCommonsense theories left the gap untouched, declaring our mind able\nto clear it by a self-transcending leap. Transcendentalist theories\nleft it impossible to traverse by finite knowers, and brought an\nabsolute in to perform the saltatory act. All the while, in the very\nbosom of the finite experience, every conjunction required to make\nthe relation intelligible is given in full. Either the knower and\nthe known are:",
        "(1) the self-same piece of experience taken twice over in different\ncontexts; or they are",
        "(2) two pieces of ACTUAL experience belonging to the same subject,\nwith definite tracts of conjunctive transitional experience\nbetween them; or",
        "(3) the known is a POSSIBLE experience either of that subject or\nanother, to which the said conjunctive transitions WOULD lead,\nif sufficiently prolonged.",
        "To discuss all the ways in which one experience may function as the\nknower of another, would be incompatible with the limits of\nthis essay. I have treated of type 1, the kind of knowledge called\nperception, in an article in the Journal of Philosophy, for\nSeptember 1, 1904, called ’Does consciousness exist?’ This is the\ntype of case in which the mind enjoys direct ’acquaintance’ with a\npresent object. In the other types the mind has ’knowledge-about’\nan object not immediately there. Type 3 can always formally and\nhypothetically be reduced to type 2, so that a brief description of\nthat type will now put the present reader sufficiently at my point\nof view, and make him see what the actual meanings of the\nmysterious cognitive relation may be.",
        "Suppose me to be sitting here in my library at Cambridge, at ten\nminutes’ walk from ’Memorial Hall,’ and to be thinking truly of\nthe latter object. My mind may have before it only the name, or it\nmay have a clear image, or it may have a very dim image of the\nhall, but such an intrinsic difference in the image makes no\ndifference in its cognitive function. Certain extrinsic phenomena,\nspecial experiences of conjunction, are what impart to the image, be\nit what it may, its knowing office.",
        "For instance, if you ask me what hall I mean by my image, and I can\ntell you nothing; or if I fail to point or lead you towards the\nHarvard Delta; or if, being led by you, I am uncertain whether the\nHall I see be what I had in mind or not; you would rightly deny that\nI had ’meant’ that particular hall at all, even tho my mental image\nmight to some degree have resembled it. The resemblance would\ncount in that case as coincidental merely, for all sorts of things\nof a kind resemble one another in this world without being held for\nthat reason to take cognizance of one another.",
        "On the other hand, if I can lead you to the hall, and tell you of\nits history and present uses; if in its presence I feel my idea,\nhowever imperfect it may have been, to have led hither and to be now\nTERMINATED; if the associates of the image and of the felt hall\nrun parallel, so that each term of the one context corresponds\nserially, as I walk, with an answering term of the other; why then\nmy soul was prophetic, and my idea must be, and by common consent\nwould be, called cognizant of reality. That percept was what I\nMEANT, for into it my idea has passed by conjunctive experiences of\nsameness and fulfilled intention. Nowhere is there jar, but every\nlater moment continues and corroborates an earlier one.",
        "In this continuing and corroborating, taken in no transcendental\nsense, but denoting definitely felt transitions, LIES ALL THAT THE\nKNOWING OF A PERCEPT BY AN IDEA CAN POSSIBLY CONTAIN OR SIGNIFY.\nWherever such transitions are felt, the first experience KNOWS the\nlast one. Where they do not, or where even as possibles they can\nnot, intervene, there can be no pretence of knowing. In this latter\ncase the extremes will be connected, if connected at all, by\ninferior relations–bare likeness or succession, or by ’withness’\nalone. Knowledge of sensible realities thus comes to life inside the\ntissue of experience. It is MADE; and made by relations that unroll\nthemselves in time. Whenever certain intermediaries are given, such\nthat, as they develop towards their terminus, there is\nexperience from point to point of one direction followed, and\nfinally of one process fulfilled, the result is that THEIR STARTING-\nPOINT THEREBY BECOMES A KNOWER AND THEIR TERMINUS AN OBJECT MEANT\nOR KNOWN. That is all that knowing (in the simple case considered)\ncan be known-as, that is the whole of its nature, put into\nexperiential terms. Whenever such is the sequence of our experiences\nwe may freely say that we had the terminal object ’in mind’ from the\noutset, even altho AT the outset nothing was there in us but a flat\npiece of substantive experience like any other, with no self-\ntranscendency about it, and no mystery save the mystery of coming\ninto existence and of being gradually followed by other pieces of\nsubstantive experience, with conjunctively transitional\nexperiences between. That is what we MEAN here by the object’s being\n’in mind.’ Of any deeper more real way of its being in mind we have\nno positive conception, and we have no right to discredit our actual\nexperience by talking of such a way at all.",
        "I know that many a reader will rebel at this. ’Mere intermediaries,’\nhe will say, ’even tho they be feelings of continuously\ngrowing fulfilment, only SEPARATE the knower from the known, whereas\nwhat we have in knowledge is a kind of immediate touch of the one\nby the other, an “apprehension” in the etymological sense of the\nword, a leaping of the chasm as by lightning, an act by which\ntwo terms are smitten into one over the head of their distinctness.\nAll these dead intermediaries of yours are out of each other, and\noutside of their termini still.’",
        "But do not such dialectic difficulties remind us of the dog dropping\nhis bone and snapping at its image in the water? If we knew any\nmore real kind of union aliunde, we might be entitled to brand all\nour empirical unions as a sham. But unions by continuous\ntransition are the only ones we know of, whether in this matter of a\nknowledge-about that terminates in an acquaintance, whether in\npersonal identity, in logical prediction through the copula ’is,’ or\nelsewhere. If anywhere there were more absolute unions, they could\nonly reveal themselves to us by just such conjunctive results. These\nare what the unions are worth, these are all that we can ever\npractically mean by union, by continuity. Is it not time to\nrepeat what Lotze said of substances, that to act like one is to be\none? Should we not say here that to be experienced as continuous is\nto be really continuous, in a world where experience and reality\ncome to the same thing? In a picture gallery a painted hook will\nserve to hang a painted chain by, a painted cable will hold a\npainted ship. In a world where both the terms and their distinctions\nare affairs of experience, conjunctions that are experienced must be\nat least as real as anything else. They will be ’absolutely’ real\nconjunctions, if we have no transphenomenal absolute ready,\nto derealize the whole experienced world by, at a stroke.",
        "So much for the essentials of the cognitive relation where the\nknowledge is conceptual in type, or forms knowledge ’about’ an\nobject. It consists in intermediary experiences (possible, if not\nactual) of continuously developing progress, and, finally, of\nfulfilment, when the sensible percept which is the object is\nreached. The percept here not only VERIFIES the concept, proves its\nfunction of knowing that percept to be true, but the percept’s\nexistence as the terminus of the chain of intermediaries CREATES the\nfunction. Whatever terminates that chain was, because it now proves\nitself to be, what the concept ’had in mind.’",
        "The towering importance for human life of this kind of knowing lies\nin the tact that an experience that knows another can figure as its\nREPRESENTATIVE, not in any quasi-miraculous ’epistemological’ sense,\nbut in the definite, practical sense of being its substitute in\nvarious operations, sometimes physical and sometimes mental, which\nlead us to its associates and results. By experimenting on our\nideas of reality, we may save ourselves the trouble of experimenting\non the real experiences which they severally mean. The ideas form\nrelated systems, corresponding point for point to the systems which\nthe realities form; and by letting an ideal term call up its\nassociates systematically, we may be led to a terminus which\nthe corresponding real term would have led to in case we had\noperated on the real world. And this brings us to the general\nquestion of substitution.",
        "What, exactly, in a system of experiences, does the ’substitution’\nof one of them for another mean?",
        "According to my view, experience as a whole is a process in time,\nwhereby innumerable particular terms lapse and are superseded\nby others that follow upon them by transitions which, whether\ndisjunctive or conjunctive in content, are themselves experiences,\nand must in general be accounted at least as real as the terms which\nthey relate. What the nature of the event called ’superseding’\nsignifies, depends altogether on the kind of transition\nthat obtains. Some experiences simply abolish their predecessors\nwithout continuing them in any way. Others are felt to increase or\nto enlarge their meaning, to carry out their purpose, or to bring us\nnearer to their goal. They ’represent’ them, and may fulfil their\nfunction better than they fulfilled it themselves. But to ’fulfil a\nfunction’ in a world of pure experience can be conceived and defined\nin only one possible way. In such a world transitions and arrivals\n(or terminations) are the only events that happen, tho they happen\nby so many sorts of path. The only function that one experience can\nperform is to lead into another experience; and the only fulfilment\nwe can speak of is the reaching of a certain experienced end. When\none experience leads to (or can lead to) the same end as another,\nthey agree in function. But the whole system of experiences as they\nare immediately given presents itself as a quasi-chaos through which\none can pass out of an initial term in many directions and yet\nend in the same terminus, moving from next to next by a great many\npossible paths.",
        "Either one of these paths might be a functional substitute for\nanother, and to follow one rather than another might on occasion be\nan advantageous thing to do. As a matter of fact, and in a general\nway, the paths that run through conceptual experiences, that\nis, through ’thoughts’ or ’ideas’ that ’know’ the things in which\nthey terminate, are highly advantageous paths to follow. Not only do\nthey yield inconceivably rapid transitions; but, owing to the\n’universal’ character [Footnote: Of which all that need be said in\nthis essay is that it also an be conceived as functional, and\ndefined in terms of transitions, or of the possibility of such.]\nwhich they frequently possess, and to their capacity for association\nwith one another in great systems, they outstrip the tardy\nconsecutions of the things themselves, and sweep us on towards our\nultimate termini in a far more labor-saving way than the following\nof trains of sensible perception ever could. Wonderful are the\nnew cuts and the short-circuits the thought-paths make. Most\nthought-paths, it is true, are substitutes for nothing actual; they\nend outside the real world altogether, in wayward fancies,\nutopias, fictions or mistakes. But where they do re-enter reality\nand terminate therein, we substitute them always; and with these\nsubstitutes we pass the greater number of our hours. [Footnote: This\nis why I called our experiences, taken all together, a quasi-chaos.\nThere is vastly more discontinuity in the sum total of experiences\nthan we commonly suppose. The objective nucleus of every man’s\nexperience, his own body, is, it is true, a continuous percept; and\nequally continuous as a percept (though we may be inattentive to it)\nis the material environment of that body, changing by gradual\ntransition when the body moves. But the distant parts of the\nphysical world are at all times absent from us, and form conceptual\nobjects merely, into the perceptual reality of which our life\ninserts itself at points discrete and relatively rare. Round their\nseveral objective nuclei, partly shared and common partly discrete\nof the real physical world, innumerable thinkers, pursuing their\nseveral lines of physically true cogitation, trace paths that\nintersect one another only at discontinuous perceptual points, and\nthe rest of the time are quite incongruent; and around all the\nnuclei of shared ’reality’ floats the vast cloud of experiences that\nare wholly subjective, that are non-substitutional, that find not\neven an eventual ending for themselves in the perceptual world–the\nmere day-dreams and joys and sufferings and wishes of the individual\nminds. These exist WITH one another, indeed, and with the objective\nnuclei, but out of them it is probable that to all eternity no\ninter-related system of any kind will ever be made.]",
        "Whosoever feels his experience to be something substitutional even\nwhile he has it, may be said to have an experience that\nreaches beyond itself. From inside of its own entity it says ’more,’\nand postulates reality existing elsewhere. For the\ntranscendentalist, who holds knowing to consist in a salto\nmotale across an ’epistemological chasm,’ such an idea presents no\ndifficulty; but it seems at first sight as if it might be\ninconsistent with an empiricism like our own. Have we not explained\nthat conceptual knowledge is made such wholly by the existence of\nthings that fall outside of the knowing experience itself–by\nintermediary experiences and by a terminus that fulfils?",
        "Can the knowledge be there before these elements that constitute its\nbeing have come? And, if knowledge be not there, how can\nobjective reference occur?",
        "The key to this difficulty lies in the distinction between knowing\nas verified and completed, and the same knowing as in transit and on\nits way. To recur to the Memorial Hall example lately used, it is\nonly when our idea of the Hall has actually terminated in\nthe percept that we know ’for certain’ that from the beginning it\nwas truly cognitive of THAT. Until established by the end of the\nprocess, its quality of knowing that, or indeed of knowing anything,\ncould still be doubted; and yet the knowing really was there, as the\nresult now shows. We were VIRTUAL knowers of the Hall long before we\nwere certified to have been its actual knowers, by the percept’s\nretroactive validating power. Just so we are ’mortal’ all the time,\nby reason of the virtuality of the inevitable event which will make\nus so when it shall have come.",
        "Now the immensely greater part of all our knowing never gets beyond\nthis virtual stage. It never is completed or nailed down. I\nspeak not merely of our ideas of imperceptibles like ether-waves or\ndissociated ’ions,’ or of ’ejects’ like the contents of our\nneighbors’ minds; I speak also of ideas which we might verify if\nwe would take the trouble, but which we hold for true altho\nunterminated perceptually, because nothing says ’no’ to us, and\nthere is no contradicting truth in sight. TO CONTINUE\nTHINKING UNCHALLENGED IS, NINETY-NINE TIMES OUT OF A HUNDRED, OUR\nPRACTICAL SUBSTITUTE FOR KNOWING IN THE COMPLETED SENSE. As each\nexperience runs by cognitive transition into the next one, and\nwe nowhere feel a collision with what we elsewhere count as truth or\nfact, we commit ourselves to the current as if the port were sure.\nWe live, as it, were, upon the front edge of an advancing wave-\ncrest, and our sense of a determinate direction in falling forward\nis all we cover of the future of our path. It is as if a\ndifferential quotient should be conscious and treat itself as an\nadequate substitute for a traced-out curve. Our experience, inter\nalia, is of variations of rate and of direction, and lives in these\ntransitions more than in the journey’s end. The experiences of\ntendency are sufficient to act upon–what more could we have DONE\nat those moments even if the later verification comes complete?",
        "This is what, as a radical empiricist, I say to the charge that the\nobjective reference which is so flagrant a character of our\nexperiences involves a chasm and a mortal leap. A\npositively conjunctive transition involves neither chasm nor leap.\nBeing the very original of what we mean by continuity, it makes a\ncontinuum wherever it appears. Objective reference is an incident of\nthe fact that so much of our experience comes as an insufficient\nand consists of process and transition. Our fields of experience\nhave no more definite boundaries than have our fields of view. Both\nare fringed forever by a MORE that continuously develops, and that\ncontinuously supersedes them as life proceeds. The relations,\ngenerally speaking, are as real here as the terms are, and the only\ncomplaint of the transcendentalist’s with which I could at all\nsympathize would be his charge that, by first making knowledge to\nconsist in external relations as I have done, and by then confessing\nthat nine-tenths of the time these are not actually but only\nvirtually there, I have knocked the solid bottom out of the whole\nbusiness, and palmed off a substitute of knowledge for the genuine\nthing. Only the admission, such a critic might say, that our ideas\nare self-transcendent and ’true’ already; in advance of the\nexperiences that are to terminate them, can bring solidity back to\nknowledge in a world like this, in which transitions and\nterminations are only by exception fulfilled.",
        "This seems to me an excellent place for applying the pragmatic\nmethod. What would the self-transcendency affirmed to exist in\nadvance of all experiential mediation or termination, be KNOWN-AS?\nWhat would it practically result in for US, were it true?",
        "It could only result in our orientation, in the turning of our\nexpectations and practical tendencies into the right path; and the\nright path here, so long as we and the object are not yet face to\nface (or can never get face to face, as in the case of ejects),\nwould be the path that led us into the object’s\nnearest neighborhood. Where direct acquaintance is\nlacking, ’knowledge about’ is the next best thing, and an\nacquaintance with what actually lies about the ’object, and is most\nclosely related to it, puts such knowledge within our grasp. Ether-\nwaves and your anger, for example, are things in which my thoughts\nwill never PERCTEPTUALLY terminate, but my concepts of them lead me\nto their very brink, to the chromatic fringes and to the hurtful\nwords and deeds which are their really next effects.",
        "Even if our ideas did in themselves possess the postulated self-\ntranscendency, it would still remain true that their putting us\ninto possession of such effects WOULD BE THE SOLE CASH-VALUE OF THE\nSELF-TRANSCENDENCY FOR US. And this cash-value, it is needless to\nsay, is verbatim et liberatim what our empiricist account pays in.\nOn pragmatist principles therefore, a dispute over self-\ntranscendency is a pure logomachy. Call our concepts of ejective\nthings self-transcendent or the reverse, it makes no difference, so\nlong as we don’t differ about the nature of that exalted virtue’s\nfruits–fruits for us, of course, humanistic fruits.",
        "The transcendentalist believes his ideas to be self-transcendent\nonly because he finds that in fact they do bear fruits. Why need\nhe quarrel with an account of knowledge that insists on naming this\neffect? Why not treat the working of the idea from next to next\nas the essence of its self-transcendency? Why insist that knowing is\na static relation out of time when it practically seems so much\na function of our active life? For a thing to be valid, says Lotze,\nis the same as to make itself valid. When the whole universe seems\nonly to be making itself valid and to be still incomplete (else why\nits ceaseless changing?) why, of all things, should knowing be\nexempt? Why should it not be making itself valid like everything\nelse? That some parts of it may be already valid or verified beyond\ndispute; the empirical philosopher, of course, like any one else,\nmay always hope.",

        "Humanism is a ferment that has ’come to stay.’ It is not a single\nhypothesis or theorem, and it dwells on no new facts. It is rather a\nslow shifting in the philosophic perspective, making things appear\nas from a new centre of interest or point of sight. Some writers are\nstrongly conscious of the shifting, others half unconscious, even\nthough their own vision may have undergone much change. The result\nis no small confusion in debate, the half-conscious humanists often\ntaking part against the radical ones, as if they wished to count\nupon the other side. [Footnote: Professor Baldwin, for example. His\naddress ’Selective Thinking’ (Psychological Review, January, 1898,\nreprinted in his volume, ’Development and Evolution’) seems to me an\nunusually well written pragmatic manifesto. Nevertheless in ’The\nLimits of Pragmatism’ (ibid; January, 1904), he (much less clearly)\njoins in the attack.]",
        "If humanism really be the name for such a shifting of perspective,\nit is obvious that the whole scene of the philosophic stage\nwill change in some degree if humanism prevails. The emphasis of\nthings, their foreground and background distribution, their sizes\nand values, will not keep just the same. [Footnote: The\nethical changes, it seems to me, are beautifully made evident in\nProfessor Dewey’s series of articles, which will never get the\nattention they deserve till they are printed in a book. I mean: ’The\nSignificance of Emotions,’ Psychological Review, vol. ii, 13; ’The\nReflex Arc Concept in Psychology,’ ibid; iii, 357; ’Psychology and\nSocial Practice,’ ibid., vii, 105; ’Interpretation of Savage Mind,’\nibid; ix, 2l7; ’Green’s Theory of the Moral Motive,’ Philosophical\nReview, vol. i, 593; ’Self-realization as the Moral Ideal,’ ibid;\nii, 652; ’The Psychology of Effort,’ ibid; vi, 43; ’The Evolutionary\nMethod as Applied to Morality,’ ibid; xi, 107,353; ’Evolution and\nEthics,’ Monist, vol. viii, 321; to mention only a few.] If such\npervasive consequences be involved in humanism, it is clear that no\npains which philosophers may take, first in defining it, and then in\nfurthering, checking, or steering its progress, will be thrown away.",
        "It suffers badly at present from incomplete definition. Its most\nsystematic advocates, Schiller and Dewey, have published\nfragmentary programmes only; and its bearing on many vital\nphilosophic problems has not been traced except by adversaries who,\nscenting heresies in advance, have showered blows on doctrines–\nsubjectivism and scepticism, for example–that no good humanist\nfinds it necessary to entertain. By their still greater reticences,\nthe anti-humanists have, in turn, perplexed the humanists. Much of\nthe controversy has involved the word ’truth.’ It is always good in\ndebate to know your adversary’s point of view authentically. But the\ncritics of humanism never define exactly what the word ’truth’\nsignifies when they use it themselves. The humanists have to guess\nat their view; and the result has doubtless been much beating of the\nair. Add to all this, great individual differences in both camps,\nand it becomes clear that nothing is so urgently needed, at the\nstage which things have reached at present, as a sharper\ndefinition by each side of its central point of view.",
        "Whoever will contribute any touch of sharpness will help us to make\nsure of what’s what and who is who. Any one can contribute such a\ndefinition, and, without it, no one knows exactly where he stands.\nIf I offer my own provisional definition of humanism now and here,\nothers may improve it, some adversary may be led to define his own\ncreed more sharply by the contrast, and a certain quickening of the\ncrystallization of general opinion may result.",
        "The essential service of humanism, as I conceive the situation, is\nto have seen that THO ONE PART OF OUR EXPERIENCE MAY LEAN\nUPON ANOTHER PART TO MAKE IT WHAT IT IS IN ANY ONE OF SEVERAL\nASPECTS IN WHICH IT MAY BE CONSIDERED, EXPERIENCE AS A WHOLE IS\nSELF-CONTAINING AND LEANS ON NOTHING. Since this formula\nalso expresses the main contention of transcendental idealism, it\nneeds abundant explication to make it unambiguous. It seems, at\nfirst sight, to confine itself to denying theism and pantheism. But,\nin fact, it need not deny either; everything would depend on the\nexegesis; and if the formula ever became canonical, it would\ncertainly develop both right-wing and left-wing interpreters. I\nmyself read humanism theistically and pluralistically. If there be a\nGod, he is no absolute all-experiencer, but simply the experiencer\nof widest actual conscious span. Read thus, humanism is for me a\nreligion susceptible of reasoned defence, tho I am well aware how\nmany minds there are to whom it can appeal religiously only when it\nhas been monistically translated. Ethically the pluralistic form of\nit takes for me a stronger hold on reality than any other philosophy\nI know of–it being essentially a SOCIAL philosophy, a philosophy of\n’CO,’ in which conjunctions do the work. But my primary reason for\nadvocating it is its matchless intellectual economy. It gets rid,\nnot only of the standing ’problems’ that monism engenders (’problem\nof evil,’ ’problem of freedom,’ and the like), but of other\nmetaphysical mysteries and paradoxes as well.",
        "It gets rid, for example, of the whole agnostic controversy, by\nrefusing to entertain the hypothesis of trans-empirical reality at\nall. It gets rid of any need for an absolute of the bradleyan type\n(avowedly sterile for intellectual purposes) by insisting that the\nconjunctive relations found within experience are faultlessly real.\nIt gets rid of the need of an absolute of the roycean type\n(similarly sterile) by its pragmatic treatment of the problem of\nknowledge. As the views of knowledge, reality and truth imputed to\nhumanism have been those so far most fiercely attacked, it is in\nregard to these ideas that a sharpening of focus seems most urgently\nrequired. I proceed therefore to bring the views which I impute to\nhumanism in these respects into focus as briefly as I can.",
        "If the central humanistic thesis, printed above in italics, be\naccepted, it will follow that, if there be any such thing at all as\nknowing, the knower and the object known must both be portions of\nexperience. One part of experience must, therefore, either",
        "(1) Know another part of experience–in other words, parts must, as\nProfessor Woodbridge says, [Footnote: In Science, November 4,\n1904, p. 599.] represent ONE ANOTHER instead of representing\nrealities outside of ’consciousness’–this case is that of\nconceptual knowledge; or else",
        "(2) They must simply exist as so many ultimate THATS or facts of\nbeing, in the first instance; and then, as a secondary\ncomplication, and without doubling up its entitative singleness, any\none and the same THAT in experience must figure alternately as a\nthing known and as a knowledge of the thing, by reason of two\ndivergent kinds of context into which, in the general course of\nexperience, it gets woven.

        "This second case is that of sense-perception. There is a stage of\nthought that goes beyond common sense, and of it I shall say\nmore presently; but the common-sense stage is a perfectly definite\nhalting-place of thought, primarily for purposes of action; and, so\nlong as we remain on the common-sense stage of thought, object and\nsubject FUSE in the fact of ’presentation’ or sense-perception-\nthe pen and hand which I now SEE writing, for example, ARE the\nphysical realities which those words designate. In this case there\nis no self-transcendency implied in the knowing. Humanism, here, is\nonly a more comminuted IDENTITATSPHILOSOPHIE.",
        "In case (1), on the contrary, the representative experience DOES\nTRANSCEND ITSELF in knowing the other experience that is its object.\nNo one can talk of the knowledge of the one by the other without\nseeing them as numerically distinct entities, of which the one lies\nbeyond the other and away from it, along some direction and with\nsome interval, that can be definitely named. But, if the talker be\na humanist, he must also see this distance-interval concretely and\npragmatically, and confess it to consist of other\nintervening experiences–of possible ones, at all events, if not of\nactual. To call my present idea of my dog, for example, cognitive of\nthe real dog means that, as the actual tissue of experience is\nconstituted, the idea is capable of leading into a chain of other\nexperiences on my part that go from next to next and terminate at\nlast in vivid sense-perceptions of a jumping, barking, hairy body.\nThose ARE the real dog, the dog’s full presence, for my common\nsense. If the supposed talker is a profound philosopher, altho they\nmay not BE the real dog for him, they MEAN the real dog, are\npractical substitutes for the real dog, as the representation was a\npractical substitute for them, that real dog being a lot of atoms,\nsay, or of mind-stuff, that lie WHERE the sense-perceptions lie in\nhis experience as well as in my own.",
        "The philosopher here stands for the stage of thought that goes\nbeyond the stage of common sense; and the difference is simply\nthat he ’interpolates’ and ’extrapolates,’ where common sense does\nnot. For common sense, two men see the same identical real dog.\nPhilosophy, noting actual differences in their perceptions points\nout the duality of these latter, and interpolates something between\nthem as a more real terminus–first, organs, viscera, etc.; next,\ncells; then, ultimate atoms; lastly, mind-stuff perhaps. The\noriginal sense-termini of the two men, instead of coalescing with\neach other and with the real dog-object, as at first supposed, are\nthus held by philosophers to be separated by invisible realities\nwith which, at most, they are conterminous.",
        "Abolish, now, one of the percipients, and the interpolation changes\ninto ’extrapolation.’ The sense-terminus of the remaining\npercipient is regarded by the philosopher as not quite reaching\nreality. He has only carried the procession of experiences, the\nphilosopher thinks, to a definite, because practical, halting-\nplace somewhere on the way towards an absolute truth that lies\nbeyond.",
        "The humanist sees all the time, however, that there is no absolute\ntranscendency even about the more absolute realities\nthus conjectured or believed in. The viscera and cells are only\npossible percepts following upon that of the outer body. The atoms\nagain, tho we may never attain to human means of perceiving them,\nare still defined perceptually. The mind-stuff itself is conceived\nas a kind of experience; and it is possible to frame the hypothesis\n(such hypotheses can by no logic be excluded from philosophy) of two\nknowers of a piece of mind-stuff and the mind-stuff itself becoming\n’confluent’ at the moment at which our imperfect knowing might pass\ninto knowing of a completed type. Even so do you and I habitually\nconceive our two perceptions and the real dog as confluent, tho only\nprovisionally, and for the common-sense stage of thought. If my pen\nbe inwardly made of mind-stuff, there is no confluence NOW between\nthat mind-stuff and my visual perception of the pen. But conceivably\nthere might come to be such. confluence; for, in the case of my\nHAND, the visual sensations and the inward feelings of the hand, its\nmind-stuff, so to speak, are even now as confluent as any two things\ncan be.",
        "There is, thus, no breach in humanistic epistemology. Whether\nknowledge be taken as ideally perfected, or only as true enough to\npass muster for practice, it is hung on one continuous scheme.\nReality, howsoever remote, is always defined as a terminus\nwithin the general possibilities of experience; and what knows it is\ndefined as an experience THAT ’REPRESENTS’ IT, IN THE SENSE OF BEING\nSUBSTITUTABLE FOR IT IN OUR THINKING because it leads to the same\nassociates, OR IN THE SENSE OF ’POINTING TO IT THROUGH A CHAIN OF\nOTHER EXPERIENCES THAT EITHER INTERVENE OR MAY INTERVENE.",
        "Absolute reality here bears the same relation to sensation as\nsensation bears to conception or imagination. Both are provisional\nor final termini, sensation being only the terminus at which the\npractical man habitually stops, while the philosopher projects a\n’beyond,’ in the shape of more absolute reality. These termini, for\nthe practical and the philosophical stages of thought respectively,\nare self-supporting. They are not ’true’ of anything else,\nthey simply ARE, are REAL. They ’lean on nothing,’ as my italicized\nformula said. Rather does the whole fabric of experience lean on\nthem, just as the whole fabric of the solar system, including many\nrelative positions, leans, for its absolute position in space, on\nany one of its constituent stars. Here, again, one gets a new\nIDENTITATSPHILOSOPHIE in pluralistic form.",
        "If I have succeeded in making this at all clear (tho I fear that\nbrevity and abstractness between them may have made me fail), the\nreader will see that the ’truth’ of our mental operations must\nalways be an intra-experiential affair. A conception is\nreckoned true by common sense when it can be made to lead to a\nsensation. The sensation, which for common sense is not so much\n’true’ as ’real,’ is held to be PROVISIONALLY true by the\nphilosopher just in so far as it COVERS (abuts at, or occupies the\nplace of) a still more absolutely real experience, in the\npossibility of which, to some remoter experient, the\nphilosopher finds reason to believe.",
        "Meanwhile what actually DOES count for true to any individual\ntrower, whether he be philosopher or common man, is always a result\nof his APPERCEPTIONS. If a novel experience, conceptual or sensible,\ncontradict too emphatically our pre-existent system of beliefs,\nin ninety-nine cases out of a hundred it is treated as false. Only\nwhen the older and the newer experiences are congruous enough to\nmutually apperceive and modify each other, does what we treat as an\nadvance in truth result. In no case, however, need truth consist in\na relation between our experiences and something archetypal or\ntrans-experiential. Should we ever reach absolutely terminal\nexperiences, experiences in which we all agreed, which were\nsuperseded by no revised continuations, these would not be TRUE,\nthey would be REAL, they would simply BE, and be indeed the angles,\ncorners, and linchpins of all reality, on which the truth of\neverything else would be stayed. Only such OTHER things as led to\nthese by satisfactory conjunctions would be ’true.’\nSatisfactory connection of some sort with such termini is all\nthat the word ’truth’ means. On the common-stage of thought sense-\npresentations serve as such termini. Our ideas and concepts and\nscientific theories pass for true only so far as they harmoniously\nlead back to the world of sense.",
        "I hope that many humanists will endorse this attempt of mine to\ntrace the more essential features of that way of viewing things. I\nfeel almost certain that Messrs. Dewey and Schiller will do so. If\nthe attackers will also take some slight account of it, it may be\nthat discussion will be a little less wide of the mark than it\nhas hitherto been.",
        "[Footnote: Reprint from the Journal of Philosophy, July 18,1907.]",
        " My failure in making converts to my conception of truth seems, if I\nmay judge by what I hear in conversation, almost complete.\nAn ordinary philosopher would feel disheartened, and a common\ncholeric sinner would curse God and die, after such a reception. But\ninstead of taking counsel of despair, I make bold to vary my\nstatements, in the faint hope that repeated droppings may wear upon\nthe stone, and that my formulas may seem less obscure if surrounded\nby something more of a ’mass’ whereby to apperceive them.",
        "For fear of compromising other pragmatists, whoe’er they be, I will\nspeak of the conception which I am trying to make intelligible, as\nmy own conception. I first published it in the year 1885, in the\nfirst article reprinted in the present book. Essential theses of\nthis article were independently supported in 1893 and 1895\nby Professor D. S. Miller [Footnote: Philosophical Review, vol. ii,\np. 408, and Psychological Review, vol. ii, p. 533.] and were\nrepeated by me in a presidential address on ’The knowing of things\ntogether’ [Footnote: The relevant parts of which are printed above,\np. 43.] in 1895. Professor Strong, in an article in the Journal of\nPhilosophy, etc., [Footnote: Vol. i, p. 253.] entitled ’A\nnaturalistic theory of the reference of thought to reality,’ called\nour account ’the James-Miller theory of cognition,’ and, as I\nunderstood him, gave it his adhesion. Yet, such is the difficulty of\nwriting clearly in these penetralia of philosophy, that each of\nthese revered colleagues informs me privately that the account of\ntruth I now give–which to me is but that earlier statement more\ncompletely set forth–is to him inadequate, and seems to leave the\ngist of real cognition out. If such near friends disagree, what can\nI hope from remoter ones, and what from unfriendly critics?",
        "Yet I feel so sure that the fault must lie in my lame forms of\nstatement and not in my doctrine, that I am fain to try once more\nto express myself.",
        "Are there not some general distinctions which it may help us to\nagree about in advance? Professor Strong distinguishes between what\nhe calls ’saltatory’ and what he calls ’ambulatory’ relations.\n’Difference,’ for example, is saltatory, jumping as it were\nimmediately from one term to another, but ’distance’ in time or\nspace is made out of intervening parts of experience through which\nwe ambulate in succession. Years ago, when T. H. Green’s ideas were\nmost influential, I was much troubled by his criticisms of english\nsensationalism. One of his disciples in particular would always say\nto me, ’Yes! TERMS may indeed be possibly sensational in origin; but\nRELATIONS, what are they but pure acts of the intellect coming upon\nthe sensations from above, and of a higher nature?’ I well remember\nthe sudden relief it gave me to perceive one day that SPACE-\nrelations at any rate were homogeneous with the terms between which\nthey mediated. The terms were spaces, and the relations were other\nintervening spaces. [Footnote: See my Principles of Psychology, vol.\nii, pp. 148-153.] For the Greenites space-relations had\nbeen saltatory, for me they became thenceforward ambulatory.",
        "Now the most general way of contrasting my view of knowledge with\nthe popular view (which is also the view of most epistemologists) is\nto call my view ambulatory, and the other view saltatory; and the\nmost general way of characterizing the two views is by saying\nthat my view describes knowing as it exists concretely, while the\nother view only describes its results abstractly taken.",
        "I fear that most of my recalcitrant readers fail to recognize that\nwhat is ambulatory in the concrete may be taken so abstractly as\nto appear saltatory. Distance, for example, is made abstract by\nemptying out whatever is particular in the concrete intervals–it is\nreduced thus to a sole ’difference,’ a difference of ’place,’ which\nis a logical or saltatory distinction, a so-called ’pure relation.’",
        "The same is true of the relation called ’knowing,’ which may connect\nan idea with a reality. My own account of this relation is\nambulatory through and through. I say that we know an object by\nmeans of an idea, whenever we ambulate towards the object under the\nimpulse which the idea communicates. If we believe in so-called\n’sensible’ realities, the idea may not only send us towards its\nobject, but may put the latter into our very hand, make it\nour immediate sensation. But, if, as most reflective people opine,\nsensible realities are not ’real’ realities, but only their\nappearances, our idea brings us at least so far, puts us in touch\nwith reality’s most authentic appearances and substitutes. In any\ncase our idea brings us into the object’s neighborhood, practical or\nideal, gets us into commerce with it, helps us towards its closer\nacquaintance, enables us to foresee it, class it, compare it, deduce\nit,–in short, to deal with it as we could not were the idea not in\nour possession.",
        "The idea is thus, when functionally considered, an instrument for\nenabling us the better to HAVE TO DO with the object and to act\nabout it. But it and the object are both of them bits of the general\nsheet and tissue of reality at large; and when we say that the idea\nleads us towards the object, that only means that it carries us\nforward through intervening tracts of that reality into the object’s\ncloser neighborhood, into the midst of its associates at least, be\nthese its physical neighbors, or be they its logical congeners only.\nThus carried into closer quarters, we are in an improved\nsituation as regards acquaintance and conduct; and we say that\nthrough the idea we now KNOW the object better or more truly.",
        "My thesis is that the knowing here is MADE by the ambulation through\nthe intervening experiences. If the idea led us nowhere, or FROM\nthat object instead of towards it, could we talk at all of its\nhaving any cognitive quality? Surely not, for it is only when taken\nin conjunction with the intermediate experiences that it gets\nrelated to THAT PARTICULAR OBJECT rather than to any other part of\nnature. Those intermediaries determine what particular\nknowing function it exerts. The terminus they guide us to tells us\nwhat object it ’means,’ the results they enrich us with ’verify’ or\n’refute’ it. Intervening experiences are thus as\nindispensable foundations for a concrete relation of cognition as\nintervening space is for a relation of distance. Cognition, whenever\nwe take it concretely, means determinate ’ambulation,’ through\nintermediaries, from a terminus a quo to, or towards, a terminus ad\nquem. As the intermediaries are other than the termini,\nand connected with them by the usual associative bonds (be these\n’external’ or be they logical, i.e., classificatory, in character),\nthere would appear to be nothing especially unique about the\nprocesses of knowing. They fall wholly within experience; and we\nneed use, in describing them, no other categories than those which\nwe employ in describing other natural processes.",
        "But there exist no processes which we cannot also consider\nabstractly, eviscerating them down to their essential skeletons or\noutlines; and when we have treated the processes of knowing thus, we\nare easily led to regard them as something altogether unparalleled\nin nature. For we first empty idea, object and intermediaries of all\ntheir particularities, in order to retain only a general scheme, and\nthen we consider the latter only in its function of giving a result,\nand not in its character of being a process. In this treatment the\nintermediaries shrivel into the form of a mere space of separation,\nwhile the idea and object retain only the logical distinctness of\nbeing the end-terms that are separated. In other words,\nthe intermediaries which in their concrete particularity form a\nbridge, evaporate ideally into an empty interval to cross, and then,\nthe relation of the end-terms having become saltatory, the whole\nhocus-pocus of Erkenntnistheorie begins, and goes on unrestrained by\nfurther concrete considerations. The idea, in ’meaning’ an object\nseparated by an ’epistemological chasm’ from itself, now executes\nwhat Professor Ladd calls a ’salto mortale’; in knowing the object’s\nnature, it now ’transcends’ its own. The object in turn becomes\n’present’ where it is really absent, etc.; until a scheme remains\nupon our hands, the sublime paradoxes of which some of us think that\nnothing short of an ’absolute’ can explain.",
        "The relation between idea and object, thus made abstract and\nsaltatory, is thenceforward opposed, as being more essential and\nprevious, to its own ambulatory self, and the more\nconcrete description is branded as either false or insufficient. The\nbridge of intermediaries, actual or possible, which in every real\ncase is what carries and defines the knowing, gets treated as an\nepisodic complication which need not even potentially be there. I\nbelieve that this vulgar fallacy of opposing abstractions to the\nconcretes from which they are abstracted, is the main reason why my\naccount of knowing is deemed so unsatisfactory, and I will\ntherefore say a word more on that general point.",
        "Any vehicle of conjunction, if all its particularities are\nabstracted from it, will leave us with nothing on our hands but the\noriginal disjunction which it bridged over. But to escape treating\nthe resultant self-contradiction as an achievement of dialectical\nprofundity, all we need is to restore some part, no matter\nhow small, of what we have taken away. In the case of the\nepistemological chasm the first reasonable step is to remember that\nthe chasm was filled with SOME empirical material,\nwhether ideational or sensational, which performed SOME bridging\nfunction and saved us from the mortal leap. Restoring thus the\nindispensable modicum of reality to the matter of our discussion, we\nfind our abstract treatment genuinely useful. We escape entanglement\nwith special cases without at the same time falling into gratuitous\nparadoxes. We can now describe the general features of cognition,\ntell what on the whole it DOES FOR US, in a universal way.",
        "We must remember that this whole inquiry into knowing grows up on a\nreflective level. In any real moment of knowing, what we\nare thinking of is our object, not the way in which we ourselves are\nmomentarily knowing it. We at this moment, as it happens, have\nknowing itself for our object; but I think that the reader will\nagree that his present knowing of that object is included only\nabstractly, and by anticipation, in the results he may reach. What\nhe concretely has before his mind, as he reasons, is some supposed\nobjective instance of knowing, as he conceives it to go on in some\nother person, or recalls it from his own past. As such, he, the\ncritic, sees it to contain both an idea and an object, and processes\nby which the knower is guided from the one towards the other. He\nsees that the idea is remote from the object, and that, whether\nthrough intermediaries or not, it genuinely HAS TO DO with it.\nHe sees that it thus works beyond its immediate being, and lays hold\nof a remote reality; it jumps across, transcends itself. It does all\nthis by extraneous aid, to be sure, but when the aid has come, it\nHAS done it and the result is secure. Why not talk of results by\nthemselves, then, without considering means? Why not treat the idea\nas simply grasping or intuiting the reality, of its having the\nfaculty anyhow, of shooting over nature behind the scenes\nand knowing things immediately and directly? Why need we always lug\nin the bridging?–it only retards our discourse to do so.",
        "Such abstract talk about cognition’s results is surely convenient;\nand it is surely as legitimate as it is convenient, SO LONG AS WE DO\nNOT FORGET OR POSITIVELY DENY, WHAT IT IGNORES. We may on occasion\nsay that our idea meant ALWAYS that particular object, that it led\nus there because it was OF it intrinsically and essentially. We may\ninsist that its verification follows upon that original\ncognitive virtue in it–and all the rest–and we shall do no harm so\nlong as we know that these are only short cuts in our thinking. They\nare positively true accounts of fact AS FAR AS THEY GO, only they\nleave vast tracts of fact out of the account, tracts of tact that\nhave to be reinstated to make the accounts literally true of any\nreal case. But if, not merely passively ignoring the intermediaries,\nyou actively deny them [Footnote: This is the fallacy which I have\ncalled ’vicious intellectualism’ in my book A Pluralistic Universe,\nLongmans, Green & Co., 1909.] to be even potential requisites for\nthe results you are so struck by, your epistemology goes to\nirremediable smash. You are as far off the track as an historian\nwould be, if, lost in admiration of Napoleon’s personal power, he\nwere to ignore his marshals and his armies, and were to accuse you\nof error in describing his conquests as effected by their means.\nOf such abstractness and one-sidedness I accuse most of the critics\nof my own account.",
        "In the second lecture of the book Pragmatism, I used the\nillustration of a squirrel scrambling round a tree-trunk to keep\nout of sight of a pursuing man: both go round the tree, but does the\nman go round the squirrel? It all depends, I said, on what you mean\nby going round.’ In one sense of the word the man ’goes round,’ in\nanother sense he does not. I settled the dispute by\npragmatically distinguishing the senses. But I told how\nsome disputants had called my distinction a shuffling evasion and\ntaken their stand on what they called ’plain honest English going-\nround.’",
        "In such a simple case few people would object to letting the term in\ndispute be translated into its concreter equivalents. But in\nthe case of a complex function like our knowing they act\ndifferently. I give full concrete particular value for the ideas of\nknowing in every case I can think of, yet my critics insist\nthat ’plain honest English knowing’ is left out of my account. They\nwrite as if the minus were on my side and the plus on theirs.",
        "The essence of the matter for me is that altho knowing can be both\nabstractly and concretely described, and altho the\nabstract descriptions are often useful enough, yet they are all\nsucked up and absorbed without residuum into the concreter ones, and\ncontain nothing of any essentially other or higher nature, which the\nconcrete descriptions can be justly accused of leaving behind.\nKnowing is just a natural process like any other. There is no\nambulatory process whatsoever, the results of which we may not\ndescribe, if we prefer to, in saltatory terms, or represent\nin static formulation. Suppose, e.g., that we say a man is\n’prudent.’ Concretely, that means that he takes out insurance,\nhedges in betting, looks before he leaps. Do such acts\nCONSTITUTE the prudence? ARE they the man qua prudent?",
        "Or is the prudence something by itself and independent of them? As a\nconstant habit in him, a permanent tone of character, it\nis convenient to call him prudent in abstraction from any one of his\nacts, prudent in general and without specification, and to say the\nacts follow from the pre-existing prudence. There are peculiarities\nin his psycho-physical system that make him act prudently; and there\nare tendencies to association in our thoughts that prompt some of\nthem to make for truth and others for error. But would the man be\nprudent in the absence of each and all of the acts? Or would the\nthoughts be true if they had no associative or impulsive\ntendencies? Surely we have no right to oppose static essences in\nthis way to the moving processes in which they live embedded.",
        "My bedroom is above my library. Does the ’aboveness’ here mean aught\nthat is different from the concrete spaces which have to be moved-\nthrough in getting from the one to the other? It means, you may say,\na pure topographic relation, a sort of architect’s plan among the\neternal essences. But that is not the full aboveness, it is only an\nabbreviated substitute that on occasion may lead my mind towards\ntruer, i.e., fuller, dealings with the real aboveness. It is not an\naboveness ante rem, it is a post rem extract from the aboveness in\nrebus. We may indeed talk, for certain conveniences, as if the\nabstract scheme preceded, we may say ’I must go up stairs because of\nthe essential aboveness,’ just as we may say that the man ’does\nprudent acts because of his ingrained prudence,’ or that our ideas\n’lead us truly because of their intrinsic truth.’ But this should\nnot debar us on other occasions from using completer forms of\ndescription. A concrete matter of fact always remains identical\nunder any form of description, as when we say of a line, now that it\nruns from left to right, and now that it runs from right to left.\nThese are but names of one and the same fact, one more expedient to\nuse at one time, one at another. The full facts of cognition,\nwhatever be the way in which we talk about them, even when we talk\nmost abstractly, stand inalterably given in the actualities and\npossibilities of the experience-continuum. [Footnote 1: The ultimate\nobject or terminus of a cognitive process may in certain instances\nlie beyond the direct experience of the particular cognizer, but it,\nof course, must exist as part of the total universe of experience\nwhose constitution, with cognition in it, the critic is discussing.]\nBut my critics treat my own more concrete talk as if IT were the\nkind that sinned by its inadequacy, and as if the full continuum\nleft something out.",
        "A favorite way of opposing the more abstract to the more concrete\naccount is to accuse those who favor the latter of\n’confounding psychology with logic.’ Our critics say that when we\nare asked what truth MEANS, we reply by telling only how it is\nARRIVED-AT. But since a meaning is a logical relation, static,\nindependent of time, how can it possibly be identified, they say,\nwith any concrete man’s experience, perishing as this does at the\ninstant of its production? This, indeed, sounds profound, but I\nchallenge the profundity. I defy any one to show any difference\nbetween logic and psychology here. The logical relation stands to\nthe psychological relation between idea and object only as saltatory\nabstractness stands to ambulatory concreteness. Both relations need\na psychological vehicle; and the ’logical’ one is simply the\n’psychological’ one disemboweled of its fulness, and reduced to a\nbare abstractional scheme.",
        "A while ago a prisoner, on being released, tried to assassinate the\njudge who had sentenced him. He had apparently succeeded\nin conceiving the judge timelessly, had reduced him to a bare\nlogical meaning, that of being his ’enemy and persecutor,’ by\nstripping off all the concrete conditions (as jury’s\nverdict, official obligation, absence of personal spite, possibly\nsympathy) that gave its full psychological character to the sentence\nas a particular man’s act in time. Truly the sentence WAS inimical\nto the culprit; but which idea of it is the truer one, that bare\nlogical definition of it, or its full psychological specification?\nThe anti-pragmatists ought in consistency to stand up for the\ncriminal’s view of the case, treat the judge as the latter’s logical\nenemy, and bar out the other conditions as so much\ninessential psychological stuff.",
        "A still further obstacle, I suspect, stands in the way of my\naccount’s acceptance. Like Dewey and like Schiller, I have had to\nsay that the truth of an idea is determined by its satisfactoriness.\nBut satisfactoriness is a subjective term, just as idea is; and\ntruth is generally regarded as ’objective.’ Readers who admit\nthat satisfactoriness is our only MARK of truth, the only sign that\nwe possess the precious article, will still say that the objective\nrelation between idea and object which the word ’truth’ points to is\nleft out of my account altogether. I fear also that the association\nof my poor name with the ’will to believe’ (which ’will,’ it seems\nto me, ought to play no part in this discussion) works against my\ncredit in some quarters. I fornicate with that unclean thing,\nmy adversaries may think, whereas your genuine truth-lover must\ndiscourse in huxleyan heroics, and feel as if truth, to be real\ntruth, ought to bring eventual messages of death to all\nour satisfactions. Such divergences certainly prove the complexity\nof the area of our discussion; but to my mind they also are based\non misunderstandings, which (tho with but little hope of success) I\nwill try to diminish by a further word of explanation.",
        "First, then, I will ask my objectors to define exactly what SORT of\nthing it is they have in mind when they speak of a truth that shall\nbe absolute, complete and objective; and then I will defy them to\nshow me any conceivable standing-room for such a kind of truth\noutside the terms of my own description. It will fall, as I contend,\nentirely within the field of my analysis.",
        "To begin with, it must obtain between an idea and a reality that is\nthe idea’s object; and, as a predicate, it must apply to the\nidea and not to the object, for objective realities are not TRUE, at\nleast not in the universe of discourse to which we are now confining\nourselves, for there they are taken as simply BEING, while the ideas\nare true OF them. But we can suppose a series of ideas to be\nsuccessively more and more true of the same object, and can ask what\nis the extreme approach to being absolutely true that the last idea\nmight attain to.",
        "The maximal conceivable truth in an idea would seem to be that it\nshould lead to an actual merging of ourselves with the object, to an\nutter mutual confluence and identification. On the common-sense\nlevel of belief this is what is supposed really to take place in\nsense-perception. My idea of this pen verifies itself through my\npercept; and my percept is held to BE the pen for the time being–\npercepts and physical realities being treated by common sense as\nidentical. But the physiology of the senses has criticised common\nsense out of court, and the pen ’in itself’ is now believed to lie\nbeyond my momentary percept. Yet the notion once suggested, of what\na completely consummated acquaintance with a reality might be like,\nremains over for our speculative purposes. TOTAL CONFLUX OF THE MIND\nWITH THE REALITY would be the absolute limit of truth, there could\nbe no better or more satisfying knowledge than that.",
        "Such total conflux, it is needless to say, is ALREADY EXPLICITLY\nPROVIDED FOR, AS A POSSIBILITY, IN MY ACCOUNT OF THE MATTER. If an\nidea should ever lead us not only TOWARDS, or UP TO, or AGAINST, a\nreality, but so close that we and the reality should MELT TOGETHER,\nit would be made absolutely true, according to me, by that\nperformance.",
        "In point of fact philosophers doubt that this ever occurs. What\nhappens, they think, is only that we get nearer and nearer to\nrealities, we approximate more and more to the all-satisfying limit;\nand the definition of actually, as distinguished from\nimaginably, complete and objective truth, can then only be that it\nbelongs to the idea that will lead us as CLOSE UP AGAINST THE OBJECT\nas in the nature of our experience is possible, literally NEXT\nto it, for instance.",
        "Suppose, now, there were an idea that did this for a certain\nobjective reality. Suppose that no further approach were possible,\nthat nothing lay between, that the next step would carry us right\nINTO the reality; then that result, being the next thing to conflux,\nwould make the idea true in the maximal degree that might be\nsupposed practically attainable in the world which we inhabit.",
        "Well, I need hardly explain that THAT DEGREE OF TRUTH IS ALSO\nPROVIDED FOR IN MY ACCOUNT OF THE MATTER. And if satisfactions are\nthe marks of truth’s presence, we may add that any less true\nsubstitute for such a true idea would prove less satisfactory.\nFollowing its lead, we should probably find out that we did not\nquite touch the terminus. We should desiderate a closer approach,\nand not rest till we had found it.",
        "I am, of course, postulating here a standing reality independent of\nthe idea that knows it. I am also postulating that satisfactions\ngrow pari passu with our approximation to such reality. [Footnote 1:\nSay, if you prefer to, that DISsatisfactions decrease pari passu\nwith such approximation. The approximation may be of any kind\nassignable–approximation in time or in space, or approximation in\nkind, which in common speech means ’copying.’] If my critics\nchallenge this latter assumption, I retort upon them with the\nformer. Our whole notion of a standing reality grows up in the form\nof an ideal limit to the series of successive termini to which\nour thoughts have led us and still are leading us. Each terminus\nproves provisional by leaving us unsatisfied. The truer idea is the\none that pushes farther; so we are ever beckoned on by the ideal\nnotion of an ultimate completely satisfactory terminus. I, for one,\nobey and accept that notion. I can conceive no other objective\nCONTENT to the notion of ideally perfect truth than that of\npenetration into such a terminus, nor can I conceive that the\nnotion would ever have grown up, or that true ideas would ever have\nbeen sorted out from false or idle ones, save for the greater sum\nof satisfactions, intellectual or practical, which the truer ones\nbrought with them. Can we imagine a man absolutely satisfied with an\nidea and with all its relations to his other ideas and to his\nsensible experiences, who should yet not take its content as a true\naccount of reality? The matter of the true is thus\nabsolutely identical with the matter of the satisfactory. You may\nput either word first in your ways of talking; but leave out that\nwhole notion of SATISFACTORY WORKING or LEADING (which is the\nessence of my pragmatistic account) and call truth a static logical\nrelation, independent even of POSSIBLE leadings or\nsatisfactions, and it seems to me you cut all ground from under you.",
        "I fear that I am still very obscure. But I respectfully implore\nthose who reject my doctrine because they can make nothing of\nmy stumbling language, to tell us in their own name–und zwar very\nconcretely and articulately!–just how the real, genuine and\nabsolutely ’objective’ truth which they believe in so profoundly, is\nconstituted and established. They mustn’t point to the ’reality’\nitself, for truth is only our subjective relation to realities. What\nis the nominal essence of this relation, its logical definition,\nwhether or not it be ’objectively’ attainable by mortals?",
        "Whatever they may say it is, I have the firmest faith that my\naccount will prove to have allowed for it and included it by\nanticipation, as one possible case in the total mixture of cases.\nThere is, in short, no ROOM for any grade or sort of truth outside\nof the framework of the pragmatic system, outside of that jungle of\nempirical workings and leadings, and their nearer or ulterior\nterminations, of which I seem to have written so unskilfully.",
        "[Footnote: Reprinted from the Journal of Philosophy, etc.,\nAugust 15, 1907 (vol. iv, p. 464).]",
        "Professor J. B. Pratt’s paper in the Journal of Philosophy for June\n6, 1907, is so brilliantly written that its misconception of\nthe pragmatist position seems doubly to call for a reply.",
        "He asserts that, for a pragmatist, truth cannot be a relation\nbetween an idea and a reality outside and transcendent of the idea,\nbut must lie ’altogether within experience,’ where it will need ’no\nreference to anything else to justify it’–no reference to the\nobject, apparently. The pragmatist must ’reduce everything\nto psychology,’ aye, and to the psychology of the immediate moment.\nHe is consequently debarred from saying that an idea that\neventually gets psychologically verified WAS already true before the\nprocess of verifying was complete; and he is equally debarred from\ntreating an idea as true provisionally so long as he only believes\nthat he CAN verify it whenever he will.",
        "Whether such a pragmatist as this exists, I know not, never having\nmyself met with the beast. We can define terms as we like; and\nif that be my friend Pratt’s definition of a pragmatist, I can only\nconcur with his anti-pragmatism. But, in setting up the weird\ntype, he quotes words from me; so, in order to escape being classed\nby some reader along with so asinine a being, I will reassert my own\nview of truth once more.",
        "Truth is essentially a relation between two things, an idea, on the\none hand, and a reality outside of the idea, on the other. This\nrelation, like all relations, has its fundamentum, namely, the\nmatrix of experiential circumstance, psychological as well as\nphysical, in which the correlated terms are found embedded. In\nthe case of the relation between ’heir’ and ’legacy’ the fundamentum\nis a world in which there was a testator, and in which there is now\na will and an executor; in the case of that between idea and object,\nit is a world with circumstances of a sort to make a satisfactory\nverification process, lying around and between the two terms. But\njust as a man may be called an heir and treated as one before the\nexecutor has divided the estate, so an idea may practically be\ncredited with truth before the verification process has been\nexhaustively carried out–the existence of the mass of\nverifying circumstance is enough. Where potentiality counts for\nactuality in so many other cases, one does not see why it may not so\ncount here. We call a man benevolent not only for his kind acts paid\nin, but for his readiness to perform others; we treat an idea as\n’luminous’ not only for the light it has shed, but for that\nwe expect it will shed on dark problems. Why should we not equally\ntrust the truth of our ideas? We live on credits everywhere; and\nwe use our ideas far oftener for calling up things connected with\ntheir immediate objects, than for calling up those objects\nthemselves. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred the only use\nwe should make of the object itself, if we were led up to it by our\nidea, would be to pass on to those connected things by its means. So\nwe continually curtail verification-processes, letting our belief\nthat they are possible suffice.",
        "What CONSTITUTES THE RELATION known as truth, I now say, is just the\nEXISTENCE IN THE EMPIRICAL WORLD OF THIS FUNDAMENTUM OF\nCIRCUMSTANCE SURROUNDING OBJECT AND IDEA and ready to be either\nshort-circuited or traversed at full length. So long as it exists,\nand a satisfactory passage through it between the object and\nthe idea is possible, that idea will both BE true, and will HAVE\nBEEN true of that object, whether fully developed verification has\ntaken place or not. The nature and place and affinities of\nthe object of course play as vital a part in making the particular\npassage possible as do the nature and associative tendencies of the\nidea; so that the notion that truth could fall altogether inside of\nthe thinker’s private experience and be something purely\npsychological, is absurd. It is BETWEEN the idea and the object that\nthe truth-relation is to be sought and it involves both terms.",
        "But the ’intellectualistic’ position, if I understand Mr. Pratt\nrightly, is that, altho we can use this fundamentum, this mass\nof go-between experience, for TESTING truth, yet the truth-relation\nin itself remains as something apart. It means, in Mr. Pratt’s\nwords, merely ’THIS SIMPLE THING THAT THE OBJECT OF WHICH ONE IS\nTHINKING IS AS ONE THINKS IT.’",
        "It seems to me that the word ’as,’ which qualifies the relation\nhere, and bears the whole ’epistemological’ burden, is anything but\nsimple. What it most immediately suggests is that the idea should be\nLIKE the object; but most of our ideas, being abstract concepts,\nbear almost no resemblance to their objects. The ’as’ must\ntherefore, I should say, be usually interpreted functionally, as\nmeaning that the idea shall lead us into the same quarters of\nexperience AS the object would. Experience leads ever on and on, and\nobjects and our ideas of objects may both lead to the same goals.\nThe ideas being in that case shorter cuts, we SUBSTITUTE them more\nand more for their objects; and we habitually waive direct\nverification of each one of them, as their train passes through our\nmind, because if an idea leads AS the object would lead, we can say,\nin Mr. Pratt’s words, that in so far forth the object is AS we think\nit, and that the idea, verified thus in so far forth, is true\nenough.",
        "Mr. Pratt will undoubtedly accept most of these facts, but he will\ndeny that they spell pragmatism. Of course, definitions are free to\nevery one; but I have myself never meant by the pragmatic view of\ntruth anything different from what I now describe; and inasmuch as\nmy use of the term came earlier than my friend’s, I think it ought\nto have the right of way. But I suspect that Professor\nPratt’s contention is not solely as to what one must think in order\nto be called a pragmatist. I am cure that he believes that the\ntruth-relation has something MORE in it than the fundamentum which I\nassign can account for. Useful to test truth by, the matrix of\ncircumstance, be thinks, cannot found the truth-relation in se, for\nthat is trans-empirical and ’saltatory.’",
        "Well, take an object and an idea, and assume that the latter is true\nof the former–as eternally and absolutely true as you like. Let the\nobject be as much ’as’ the idea thinks it, as it is possible for one\nthing to be ’as’ another. I now formally ask of Professor Pratt to\ntell what this ’as’-ness in itself CONSISTS in–for it seems to me\nthat it ought to consist in something assignable and describable,\nand not remain a pure mystery, and I promise that if he can assign\nany determination of it whatever which I cannot successfully refer\nto some specification of what in this article I have called the\nempirical fundamentum, I will confess my stupidity cheerfully, and\nwill agree never to publish a line upon this subject of truth again.",
        "Professor Pratt has returned to the charge in a whole book,\n[Footnote 1: J. B. Pratt: What is Pragmatism. New York, The\nMacmillan Company, 1909.–The comments I have printed were written\nin March, 1909, after some of the articles printed later in the\npresent volume.] which for its clearness and good temper deserves to\nsupersede all the rest of the anti-pragmatistic literature. I wish\nit might do so; for its author admits all MY essential contentions,\nsimply distinguishing my account of truth as ’modified’\npragmatism from Schiller’s and Dewey’s, which he calls pragmatism of\nthe ’radical’ sort. As I myself understand Dewey and Schiller, our\nviews absolutely agree, in spite of our different modes of\nstatement; but I have enough trouble of my own in life without\nhaving to defend my friends, so I abandon them provisionally to the\ntender mercy of Professor Pratt’s interpretations, utterly erroneous\ntho I deem these to be. My reply as regards myself can be\nvery short, for I prefer to consider only essentials, and Dr.\nPratt’s whole book hardly takes the matter farther than the article\nto which I retort in Part I of the present paper.",
        "He repeats the ’as’-formula, as if it were something that I, along\nwith other pragmatists, had denied, [Footnote: Op. cit., pp. 77-\n80.] whereas I have only asked those who insist so on its importance\nto do something more than merely utter it–to explicate it, for\nexample, and tell us what its so great importance consists in. I\nmyself agree most cordially that for an idea to be true the object\nmust be ’as’ the idea declares it, but I explicate the ’as’-ness as\nmeaning the idea’s verifiability.",
        "Now since Dr. Pratt denies none of these verifying ’workings’ for\nwhich I have pleaded, but only insists on their inability to serve\nas the fundamentum of the truth-relation, it seems that there is\nreally nothing in the line of FACT about which we differ, and that\nthe issue between us is solely as to how far the notion of\nworkableness or verifiability is an essential part of the notion of\n’trueness’–’trueness’ being Dr. Pratt’s present name for the\ncharacter of as-ness in the true idea. I maintain that there is no\nmeaning left in this notion of as-ness or trueness if no reference\nto the possibility of concrete working on the part of the idea is\nmade.",
        "Take an example where there can be no possible working. Suppose I\nhave an idea to which I give utterance by the vocable ’skrkl,’\nclaiming at the same time that it is true. Who now can say\nthat it is FALSE, for why may there not be somewhere in the\nunplumbed depths of the cosmos some object with which ’skrkl’ can\nagree and have trueness in Dr. Pratt’s sense? On the other hand who\ncan say that it is TRUE, for who can lay his hand on that object and\nshow that it and nothing else is what I MEAN by my word? But yet\nagain, who can gainsay any one who shall call my word utterly\nIRRELATIVE to other reality, and treat it as a bare fact in my mind,\ndevoid of any cognitive function whatever. One of these three\nalternatives must surely be predicated of it. For it not to be\nirrelevant (or not-cognitive in nature), an object of some kind must\nbe provided which it may refer to. Supposing that object provided,\nwhether ’skrkl’ is true or false of it, depends, according to\nProfessor Pratt, on no intermediating condition whatever. The\ntrueness or the falsity is even now immediately, absolutely, and\npositively there.",
        "I, on the other hand, demand a cosmic environment of some kind to\nestablish which of them is there rather than utter\nirrelevancy. [Footnote: Dr. Pratt, singularly enough, disposes of\nthis primal postulate of all pragmatic epistemology, by saying that\nthe pragmatist ’unconsciously surrenders his whole case by smuggling\nin the idea of a conditioning environment which determines whether\nor not the experience can work, and which cannot itself be\nidentified with the experience or any part of it’ (pp. 167-168). The\n’experience’ means here of course the idea, or belief; and the\nexpression ’smuggling in’ is to the last degree diverting. If any\nepistemologist could dispense with a conditioning environment, it\nwould seem to be the antipragmatist, with his immediate saltatory\ntrueness, independent of work done. The mediating pathway which the\nenvironment supplies is the very essence of the pragmatist’s\nexplanation.] I then say, first, that unless some sort of a\nnatural path exists between the ’skrkl’ and THAT object,\ndistinguishable among the innumerable pathways that run among all\nthe realities of the universe, linking them promiscuously with one\nanother, there is nothing there to constitute even the POSSIBILITY\nOF ITS REFERRING to that object rather than to any other.",
        "I say furthermore that unless it have some TENDENCY TO FOLLOW UP\nTHAT PATH, there is nothing to constitute its INTENTION to refer to\nthe object in question.",
        "Finally, I say that unless the path be strown with possibilities of\nfrustration or encouragement, and offer some sort of terminal\nsatisfaction or contradiction, there is nothing to constitute its\nagreement or disagreement with that object, or to constitute the as-\nness (or ’not-as-ness’) in which the trueness (or falseness) is\nsaid to consist.",
        "I think that Dr. Pratt ought to do something more than repeat the\nname ’trueness,’ in answer to my pathetic question whether\nthat there be not some CONSTITUTION to a relation as important as\nthis. The pathway, the tendency, the corroborating or contradicting\nprogress, need not in every case be experienced in full, but I don’t\nsee, if the universe doesn’t contain them among its possibilities of\nfurniture, what LOGICAL MATERIAL FOR DEFINING the trueness of\nmy idea is left. But if it do contain them, they and they only are\nthe logical material required.",
        "I am perplexed by the superior importance which Dr. Pratt attributes\nto abstract trueness over concrete verifiability in an idea, and\nI wish that he might be moved to explain. It is prior to\nverification, to be sure, but so is the verifiability for which I\ncontend prior, just as a man’s ’mortality’ (which is nothing but\nthe possibility of his death) is prior to his death, but it can\nhardly be that this abstract priority of all possibility to its\ncorrelative fact is what so obstinate a quarrel is about. I think it\nprobable that Dr. Pratt is vaguely thinking of something concreter\nthan this. The trueness of an idea must mean SOMETHING DEFINITE IN\nIT THAT DETERMINES ITS TENDENCY TO WORK, and indeed towards this\nobject rather than towards that. Undoubtedly there is something of\nthis sort in the idea, just as there is something in man\nthat accounts for his tendency towards death, and in bread that\naccounts for its tendency to nourish. What that something is in\nthe case of truth psychology tells us: the idea has associates\npeculiar to itself, motor as well as ideational; it tends by its\nplace and nature to call these into being, one after another;\nand the appearance of them in succession is what we mean by the\n’workings’ of the idea. According to what they are, does the\ntrueness or falseness which the idea harbored come to light. These\ntendencies have still earlier conditions which, in a general way,\nbiology, psychology and biography can trace. This whole chain of\nnatural causal conditions produces a resultant state of things in\nwhich new relations, not simply causal, can now be found, or\ninto which they can now be introduced,–the relations namely which\nwe epistemologists study, relations of adaptation, of\nsubstitutability, of instrumentality, of reference and of truth.",
        "The prior causal conditions, altho there could be no knowing of any\nkind, true or false, without them, are but preliminary to the\nquestion of what makes the ideas true or false when once their\ntendencies have been obeyed. The tendencies must exist in some shape\nanyhow, but their fruits are truth, falsity, or\nirrelevancy, according to what they concretely turn out to be. They\nare not ’saltatory’ at any rate, for they evoke their consequences\ncontiguously, from next to next only; and not until the final result\nof the whole associative sequence, actual or potential, is in our\nmental sight, can we feel sure what its epistemological\nsignificance, if it have any, may be. True knowing is, in fine, not\nsubstantially, in itself, or ’as such,’ inside of the idea from the\nfirst, any more than mortality AS SUCH is inside of the man,\nor nourishment AS SUCH inside of the bread. Something else is there\nfirst, that practically MAKES FOR knowing, dying or nourishing, as\nthe case may be. That something is the ’nature’ namely of the first\nterm, be it idea, man, or bread, that operates to start the causal\nchain of processes which, when completed, is the complex fact to\nwhich we give whatever functional name best fits the case. Another\nnature, another chain of cognitive workings; and then either another\nobject known or the same object known differently, will ensue.",
        "Dr. Pratt perplexes me again by seeming to charge Dewey and Schiller\n[Footnote: Page 200] (I am not sure that he charges me) with an\naccount of truth which would allow the object believed in not\nto exist, even if the belief in it were true. ’Since the truth of an\nidea,’ he writes, ’means merely the fact that the idea works, that\nfact is all that you mean when you say the idea is true’ (p. 206).\n’WHEN YOU SAY THE IDEA IS TRUE’–does that mean true for YOU, the\ncritic, or true for the believer whom you are describing? The\ncritic’s trouble over this seems to come from his taking the word\n’true’ irrelatively, whereas the pragmatist always means ’true for\nhim who experiences the workings.’ ’But is the object REALLY true or\nnot?’–the critic then seems to ask,–as if the pragmatist\nwere bound to throw in a whole ontology on top of his epistemology\nand tell us what realities indubitably exist. ’One world at a time,’\nwould seem to be the right reply here.",
        "One other trouble of Dr. Pratt’s must be noticed. It concerns the\n’transcendence’ of the object. When our ideas have worked so as\nto bring us flat up against the object, NEXT to it, ’is our relation\nto it then ambulatory or saltatory?’ Dr. Pratt asks. If YOUR\nheadache be my object, ’MY experiences break off where yours begin,’\nDr. Pratt writes, and ’this fact is of great importance, for it bars\nout the sense of transition and fulfilment which forms so important\nan element in the pragmatist description of knowledge–the sense of\nfulfilment due to a continuous passage from the original idea to the\nknown object. If this comes at all when I know your headache, it\ncomes not with the object, but quite on my side of\nthe “epistemological gulf.” The gulf is still there to be\ntranscended.’ (p. 158).",
        "Some day of course, or even now somewhere in the larger life of the\nuniverse, different men’s headaches may become confluent or be ’co-\nconscious.’ Here and now, however, headaches do transcend each other\nand, when not felt, can be known only conceptually. My idea is that\nyou really have a headache; it works well with what I see of your\nexpression, and with what I hear you say; but it doesn’t put me in\npossession of the headache itself. I am still at one remove, and the\nheadache ’transcends’ me, even tho it be in nowise transcendent of\nhuman experience generally. Bit the ’gulf’ here is that which the\npragmatist epistemology itself fixes in the very first words it\nuses, by saying there must be an object and an idea. The idea\nhowever doesn’t immediately leap the gulf, it only works from next\nto next so as to bridge it, fully or approximately. If it bridges\nit, in the pragmatist’s vision of his hypothetical universe, it can\nbe called a ’true’ idea. If it only MIGHT bridge it, but doesn’t, or\nif it throws a bridge distinctly AT it, it still has, in the\nonlooking pragmatist’s eyes, what Professor Pratt calls\n’trueness.’ But to ask the pragmatist thereupon whether, when it\nthus fails to coalesce bodily with the object, it is REALLY true or\nhas REAL trueness,–in other words whether the headache he\nsupposes, and supposes the thinker he supposes, to believe in, be a\nreal headache or not,–is to step from his hypothetical universe\nof discourse into the altogether different world of natural fact.",
        "[Footnote: Reprint from the Philosophical Review, January, 1908\n(vol. xvii, p. 1).]",
        " The account of truth given in my volume entitled Pragmatism,\ncontinues to meet with such persistent misunderstanding that I\nam tempted to make a final brief reply. My ideas may well deserve\nrefutation, but they can get none till they are conceived of in\ntheir proper shape. The fantastic character of the\ncurrent misconceptions shows how unfamiliar is the concrete point of\nview which pragmatism assumes. Persons who are familiar with a\nconception move about so easily in it that they understand each\nother at a hint, and can converse without anxiously attending to\ntheir P’s and Q’s. I have to admit, in view of the results, that we\nhave assumed too ready an intelligence, and consequently in many\nplaces used a language too slipshod. We should never have spoken\nelliptically. The critics have boggled at every word they could\nboggle at, and refused to take the spirit rather than the letter of\nour discourse. This seems to show a genuine unfamiliarity in the\nwhole point of view. It also shows, I think, that the second stage\nof opposition, which has already begun to express itself in the\nstock phrase that ’what is new is not true, and what is true not\nnew,’ in pragmatism, is insincere. If we said nothing in any degree\nnew, why was our meaning so desperately hard to catch? The\nblame cannot be laid wholly upon our obscurity of speech, for in\nother subjects we have attained to making ourselves understood. But\nrecriminations are tasteless; and, as far as I personally am\nconcerned, I am sure that some of the misconception I complain of is\ndue to my doctrine of truth being surrounded in that volume\nof popular lectures by a lot of other opinions not necessarily\nimplicated with it, so that a reader may very naturally have grown\nconfused. For this I am to blame,–likewise for omitting certain\nexplicit cautions, which the pages that follow will now in part\nsupply.",
        "First Misunderstanding: Pragmatism Is Only a Re-Editing Of\nPositivism.",
        "This seems the commonest mistake. Scepticism, positivism, and\nagnosticism agree with ordinary dogmatic rationalism in\npresupposing that everybody knows what the word ’truth’ means,\nwithout further explanation. But the former doctrines then either\nsuggest or declare that real truth, absolute truth, is inaccessible\nto us, and that we must fain put up with relative or phenomenal\ntruth as its next best substitute. By scepticism this is treated as\nan unsatisfactory state of affairs, while positivism and agnosticism\nare cheerful about it, call real truth sour grapes, and consider\nphenomenal truth quite sufficient for all our ’practical’ purposes.",
        "In point of fact, nothing could be farther from all this than what\npragmatism has to say of truth. Its thesis is an altogether\nprevious one. It leaves off where these other theories begin, having\ncontented itself with the word truth’s DEFINITION. ’No matter\nwhether any mind extant in the universe possess truth or not,’ it\nasks, ’what does the notion of truth signify IDEALLY?’ ’What kind of\nthings would true judgments be IN CASE they existed?’ The answer\nwhich pragmatism offers is intended to cover the most complete truth\nthat can be conceived of, ’absolute’ truth if you like, as well\nas truth of the most relative and imperfect description. This\nquestion of what truth would be like if it did exist, belongs\nobviously to a purely speculative field of inquiry. It is not a\ntheory about any sort of reality, or about what kind of knowledge is\nactually possible; it abstracts from particular terms altogether,\nand defines the nature of a possible relation between two of them.",
        "As Kant’s question about synthetic judgments had escaped previous\nphilosophers, so the pragmatist question is not only so subtile as\nto have escaped attention hitherto, but even so subtile, it would\nseem, that when openly broached now, dogmatists and sceptics\nalike fail to apprehend it, and deem the pragmatist to be treating\nof something wholly different. He insists, they say (I quote an\nactual critic), ’that the greater problems are insoluble by human\nintelligence, that our need of knowing truly is artificial and\nillusory, and that our reason, incapable of reaching the\nfoundations of reality, must turn itself exclusively\ntowards ACTION.’ There could not be a worse misapprehension.",
        "Second Misunderstanding: Pragmatism Is Primarily An Appeal To\nAction.",
        "The name ’pragmatism,’ with its suggestions of action, has been an\nunfortunate choice, I have to admit, and has played into the\nhands of this mistake. But no word could protect the doctrine from\ncritics so blind to the nature of the inquiry that, when Dr.\nSchiller speaks of ideas ’working’ well, the only thing they think\nof is their immediate workings in the physical environment, their\nenabling us to make money, or gain some similar\n’practical’ advantage. Ideas do work thus, of course, immediately or\nremotely; but they work indefinitely inside of the mental world\nalso. Not crediting us with this rudimentary insight, our critics\ntreat our view as offering itself exclusively to engineers, doctors,\nfinanciers, and men of action generally, who need some sort of\na rough and ready weltanschauung, but have no time or wit to study\ngenuine philosophy. It is usually described as a characteristically\nAmerican movement, a sort of bobtailed scheme of thought,\nexcellently fitted for the man on the street, who naturally hates\ntheory and wants cash returns immediately.",
        "It is quite true that, when the refined theoretic question that\npragmatism begins with is once answered, secondary corollaries of a\npractical sort follow. Investigation shows that, in the function\ncalled truth, previous realities are not the only independent\nvariables. To a certain extent our ideas, being realities, are\nalso independent variables, and, just as they follow other reality\nand fit it, so, in a measure, does other reality follow and fit\nthem. When they add themselves to being, they partly redetermine the\nexistent, so that reality as a whole appears incompletely definable\nunless ideas also are kept account of. This pragmatist\ndoctrine, exhibiting our ideas as complemental factors of reality,\nthrows open (since our ideas are instigators of our action) a wide\nwindow upon human action, as well as a wide license to\noriginality in thought. But few things could be sillier than to\nignore the prior epistemological edifice in which the window is\nbuilt, or to talk as if pragmatism began and ended at the\nwindow. This, nevertheless, is what our critics do almost without\nexception. They ignore our primary step and its motive, and make the\nrelation to action, which is our secondary achievement, primary.",
        "Third Misunderstanding: Pragmatists Cut Themselves Off From The\nRight to Believe in Ejective Realities.",
        "They do so, according to the critics, by making the truth of our\nbeliefs consist in their verifiability, and their verifiability in\nthe way in which they do work for us. Professor Stout, in his\notherwise admirable and hopeful review of Schiller in Mind for\nOctober, 1897, considers that this ought to lead Schiller (could he\nsincerely realize the effects of his own doctrine) to the absurd\nconsequence of being unable to believe genuinely in another\nman’s headache, even were the headache there. He can only\n’postulate’ it for the sake of the working value of the postulate to\nhimself. The postulate guides certain of his acts and leads\nto advantageous consequences; but the moment he understands fully\nthat the postulate is true ONLY (!) in this sense, it ceases (or\nshould cease) to be true for him that the other man really HAS a\nheadache. All that makes the postulate most precious then\nevaporates: his interest in his fellow-man ’becomes a veiled form\nof self-interest, and his world grows cold, dull, and heartless.’",
        "Such an objection makes a curious muddle of the pragmatist’s\nuniverse of discourse. Within that universe the pragmatist finds\nsome one with a headache or other feeling, and some one else who\npostulates that feeling. Asking on what condition the postulate is\n’true’ the pragmatist replies that, for the postulator at any rate,\nit is true just in proportion as to believe in it works in him the\nfuller sum of satisfactions. What is it that is satisfactory\nhere? Surely to BELIEVE in the postulated object, namely, in the\nreally existing feeling of the other man. But how (especially if the\npostulator were himself a thoroughgoing pragmatist) could it ever be\nsatisfactory to him NOT to believe in that feeling, so long as, in\nProfessor Stout’s words, disbelief ’made the world seem to him cold,\ndull, and heartless’? Disbelief would seem, on pragmatist\nprinciples, quite out of the question under such conditions,\nunless the heartlessness of the world were made probable already on\nother grounds. And since the belief in the headache, true for the\nsubject assumed in the pragmatist’s universe of discourse, is also\ntrue for the pragmatist who for his epitemologizing purposes has\nassumed that entire universe, why is it not true in that\nuniverse absolutely? The headache believed in is a reality there,\nand no extant mind disbelieves it, neither the critic’s mind nor his\nsubject’s! Have our opponents any better brand of truth in this real\nuniverse of ours that they can show us? [Footnote: I see here a\nchance to forestall a criticism which some one may make on Lecture\nIII of my Pragmatism, where, on pp. 96-100, I said that ’God’ and\n’Matter’ might be regarded as synonymous terms, so long as no\ndiffering future consequences were deducible from the two\nconceptions. The passage was transcribed from my address at the\nCalifornia Philosophical Union, reprinted in the Journal of\nPhilosophy, vol. i, p. 673. I had no sooner given the address than I\nperceived a flaw in that part of it; but I have left the passage\nunaltered ever since, because the flaw did not spoil its\nillustrative value. The flaw was evident when, as a case analogous\nto that of a godless universe, I thought of what I called an\n’automatic sweetheart,’ meaning a soulless body which should be\nabsolutely indistinguishable from a spiritually animated maiden,\nlaughing, talking, blushing, nursing us, and performing all feminine\noffices as tactfully and sweetly as if a soul were in her. Would\nany one regard her as a full equivalent? Certainly not, and\nwhy? Because, framed as we are, our egoism craves above all\nthings inward sympathy and recognition, love and admiration.\nThe outward treatment is valued mainly as an expression, as\na manifestation of the accompanying consciousness believed\nin. Pragmatically, then, belief in the automatic sweetheart\nwould not work, and is point of fact no one treats it as a\nserious hypothesis. The godless universe would be exactly\nsimilar. Even if matter could do every outward thing that God does,\nthe idea of it would not work as satisfactorily, because the\nchief call for a God on modern men’s part is for a being who will\ninwardly recognize them and judge them sympathetically. Matter\ndisappoints this craving of our ego, so God remains for most men the\ntruer hypothesis, and indeed remains so for definite pragmatic\nreasons.]",
        "So much for the third misunderstanding, which is but one\nspecification of the following still wider one.",
        "Fourth Misunderstanding: No Pragmatist Can Be a Realist in His\nEpistemology.",
        "This is supposed to follow from his statement that the truth of our\nbeliefs consists in general in their giving satisfaction. Of\ncourse satisfaction per se is a subjective condition; so the\nconclusion is drawn that truth falls wholly inside of the subject,\nwho then may manufacture it at his pleasure. True beliefs become\nthus wayward affections, severed from all responsibility to other\nparts of experience.",
        "It is difficult to excuse such a parody of the pragmatist’s opinion,\nignoring as it does every element but one of his universe of\ndiscourse. The terms of which that universe consists\npositively forbid any non-realistic interpretation of the function\nof knowledge defined there. The pragmatizing epistemologist posits\nthere a reality and a mind with ideas. What, now, he asks, can make\nthose ideas true of that reality? Ordinary epistemology contents\nitself with the vague statement that the ideas must ’correspond’ or\n’agree’; the pragmatist insists on being more concrete, and asks\nwhat such ’agreement’ may mean in detail. He finds first that the\nideas must point to or lead towards THAT reality and no other, and\nthen that the pointings and leadings must yield satisfaction as\ntheir result. So far the pragmatist is hardly less abstract than the\nordinary slouchy epistemologist; but as he defines himself\nfarther, he grows more concrete. The entire quarrel of the\nintellectualist with him is over his concreteness, intellectualism\ncontending that the vaguer and more abstract account is here the\nmore profound. The concrete pointing and leading are conceived by\nthe pragmatist to be the work of other portions of the same\nuniverse to which the reality and the mind belong,\nintermediary verifying bits of experience with which the mind at one\nend, and the reality at the other, are joined. The ’satisfaction,’\nin turn, is no abstract satisfaction ueberhaupt, felt by an\nunspecified being, but is assumed to consist of such satisfactions\n(in the plural) as concretely existing men actually do find in\ntheir beliefs. As we humans are constituted in point of fact, we\nfind that to believe in other men’s minds, in independent physical\nrealities, in past events, in eternal logical relations,\nis satisfactory. We find hope satisfactory. We often find it\nsatisfactory to cease to doubt. Above all we find CONSISTENCY\nsatisfactory, consistency between the present idea and the entire\nrest of our mental equipment, including the whole order of our\nsensations, and that of our intuitions of likeness and difference,\nand our whole stock of previously acquired truths.",
        "The pragmatist, being himself a man, and imagining in general no\ncontrary lines of truer belief than ours about the ’reality’ which\nhe has laid at the base of his epistemological discussion, is\nwilling to treat our satisfactions as possibly really true guides to\nit, not as guides true solely for US. It would seem here to be\nthe duty of his critics to show with some explicitness why, being\nour subjective feelings, these satisfactions can not yield\n’objective’ truth. The beliefs which they accompany ’posit’\nthe assumed reality, ’correspond’ and ’agree’ with it, and ’fit’ it\nin perfectly definite and assignable ways, through the sequent\ntrains of thought and action which form their verification, so\nmerely to insist on using these words abstractly instead of\nconcretely is no way of driving the pragmatist from the field,–\nhis more concrete account virtually includes his critic’s. If our\ncritics have any definite idea of a truth more objectively grounded\nthan the kind we propose, why do they not show it more articulately?\nAs they stand, they remind one of Hegel’s man who wanted\n’fruit,’ but rejected cherries, pears, and grapes, because they were\nnot fruit in the abstract. We offer them the full quart-pot, and\nthey cry for the empty quart-capacity.",
        "But here I think I hear some critic retort as follows: ’If\nsatisfactions are all that is needed to make truth, how about the\nnotorious fact that errors are so often satisfactory? And how about\nthe equally notorious fact that certain true beliefs may cause the\nbitterest dissatisfaction? Isn’t it clear that not the\nsatisfaction which it gives, but the relation of the belief TO THE\nREALITY is all that makes it true? Suppose there were no such\nreality, and that the satisfactions yet remained: would they not\nthen effectively work falsehood? Can they consequently be treated\ndistinctively as the truth-builders? It is the INHERENT RELATION TO\nREALITY of a belief that gives us that specific TRUTH-satisfaction,\ncompared with which all other satisfactions are the hollowest\nhumbug. The satisfaction of KNOWING TRULY is thus the only one which\nthe pragmatist ought to have considered. As a PSYCHOLOGICAL\nSENTIMENT, the anti-pragmatist gladly concedes it to him, but then\nonly as a concomitant of truth, not as a constituent. What\nCONSTITUTES truth is not the sentiment, but the purely logical or\nobjective function of rightly cognizing the reality, and the\npragmatist’s failure to reduce this function to lower values is\npatent.’",
        "Such anti-pragmatism as this seems to me a tissue of confusion. To\nbegin with, when the pragmatist says ’indispensable,’ it\nconfounds this with ’sufficient.’ The pragmatist calls satisfactions\nindispensable for truth-building, but I have everywhere called them\ninsufficient unless reality be also incidentally led to. If\nthe reality assumed were cancelled from the pragmatist’s universe of\ndiscourse, he would straightway give the name of falsehoods to the\nbeliefs remaining, in spite of all their satisfactoriness. For him,\nas for his critic, there can be no truth if there is nothing to be\ntrue about. Ideas are so much flat psychological surface unless\nsome mirrored matter gives them cognitive lustre. This is why as a\npragmatist I have so carefully posited ’reality’ AB INITIO, and\nwhy, throughout my whole discussion, I remain an epistemological\nrealist. [Footnote: I need hardly remind the reader that both sense-\npercepts and percepts of ideal relation (comparisons, etc.) should\nbe classed among the realities. The bulk of our mental\n’stock’ consists of truths concerning these terms.]",
        "The anti-pragmatist is guilty of the further confusion of imagining\nthat, in undertaking to give him an account of what truth\nformally means, we are assuming at the same time to provide a\nwarrant for it, trying to define the occasions when he can be sure\nof materially possessing it. Our making it hinge on a reality so\n’independent’ that when it comes, truth comes, and when it goes,\ntruth goes with it, disappoints this naive expectation, so he\ndeems our description unsatisfactory. I suspect that under this\nconfusion lies the still deeper one of not discriminating\nsufficiently between the two notions, truth and reality. Realities\nare not TRUE, they ARE; and beliefs are true OF them. But I suspect\nthat in the anti-pragmatist mind the two notions sometimes swap\ntheir attributes. The reality itself, I fear, is treated as if\n’true’ and conversely. Whoso tells us of the one, it is then\nsupposed, must also be telling us of the other; and a true idea must\nin a manner BE, or at least YIELD without extraneous aid, the\nreality it cognitively is possessed of.",
        "To this absolute-idealistic demand pragmatism simply opposes its non\npossumus. If there is to be truth, it says, both realities and\nbeliefs about them must conspire to make it; but whether there ever\nis such a thing, or how anyone can be sure that his own beliefs\npossess it, it never pretends to determine. That truth-satisfaction\npar excellence which may tinge a belief unsatisfactory in other\nways, it easily explains as the feeling of consistency with\nthe stock of previous truths, or supposed truths, of which one’s\nwhole past experience may have left one in possession.",
        "But are not all pragmatists sure that their own belief is right?\ntheir enemies will ask at this point; and this leads me to the",
        "Fifth Misunderstanding: What Pragmatists Say Is Inconsistent With\nTheir Saying So.",
        "A correspondent puts this objection as follows: ’When you say to\nyour audience, “pragmatism is the truth concerning truth,” the\nfirst truth is different from the second. About the first you and\nthey are not to be at odds; you are not giving them liberty to take\nor leave it according as it works satisfactorily or not for their\nprivate uses. Yet the second truth, which ought to describe and\ninclude the first, affirms this liberty. Thus the INTENT of your\nutterance seems to contradict the CONTENT of it.’",
        "General scepticism has always received this same classic refutation.\n’You have to dogmatize,’ the rationalists say to the sceptics,’\nwhenever you express the sceptical position; so your lives keep\ncontradicting your thesis.’ One would suppose that the impotence of\nso hoary an argument to abate in the slightest degree the amount of\ngeneral scepticism in the world might have led some rationalists\nthemselves to doubt whether these instantaneous logical refutations\nare such fatal ways, after all, of killing off live mental\nattitudes. General scepticism is the live mental attitude\nof refusing to conclude. It is a permanent torpor of the will,\nrenewing itself in detail towards each successive thesis that\noffers, and you can no more kill it off by logic than yon can\nkill off obstinacy or practical joking. This is why it is so\nirritating. Your consistent sceptic never puts his scepticism into a\nformal proposition,–he simply chooses it as a habit. He provokingly\nhangs back when he might so easily join us in saying yes, but he is\nnot illogical or stupid,–on the contrary, he often impresses us by\nhis intellectual superiority. This is the REAL scepticism that\nrationalists have to meet, and their logic does not even touch it.",
        "No more can logic kill the pragmatist’s behavior: his act of\nutterance, so far from contradicting, accurately exemplifies the\nmatter which he utters. What is the matter which he utters? In part,\nit is this, that truth, concretely considered, is an attribute of\nour beliefs, and that these are attitudes that follow satisfactions.\nThe ideas around which the satisfactions cluster are primarily only\nhypotheses that challenge or summon a belief to come and take its\nstand upon them. The pragmatist’s idea of truth is just such a\nchallenge. He finds it ultra-satisfactory to accept it, and takes\nhis own stand accordingly. But, being gregarious as they are, men\nseek to spread their beliefs, to awaken imitation, to infect others.\nWhy should not YOU also find the same belief satisfactory? thinks\nthe pragmatist, and forthwith endeavors to convert you. You and he\nwill then believe similarly; you will hold up your subject-end of a\ntruth, which will be a truth objective and irreversible if the\nreality holds up the object-end by being itself\npresent simultaneously. What there is of self-contradiction in all\nthis I confess I cannot discover. The pragmatist’s conduct in his\nown case seems to me on the contrary admirably to illustrate his\nuniversal formula; and of all epistemologists, he is perhaps the\nonly one who is irreproachably self-consistent.",
        "Sixth Misunderstanding: Pragmatism Explains Not What Truth Is, But\nOnly How It Is Arrived At.",
        "In point of fact it tells us both, tells us what it is incidentally\nto telling us how it is arrived at,–for what IS arrived at except\njust what the truth is? If I tell you how to get to the railroad\nstation, don’t I implicitly introduce you to the WHAT, to the being\nand nature of that edifice? It is quite true that the abstract WORD\n’how’ hasn’t the same meaning as the abstract WORD ’what,’ but in\nthis universe of concrete facts you cannot keep hows and\nwhats asunder. The reasons why I find it satisfactory to believe\nthat any idea is true, the HOW of my arriving at that belief, may be\namong the very reasons why the idea IS true in reality. If not, I\nsummon the anti-pragmatist to explain the impossibility\narticulately.",
        "His trouble seems to me mainly to arise from his fixed inability to\nunderstand how a concrete statement can possibly mean as much, or be\nas valuable, as an abstract one. I said above that the main quarrel\nbetween us and our critics was that of concreteness\nVERSUS abstractness. This is the place to develop that point\nfarther.",
        "In the present question, the links of experience sequent upon an\nidea, which mediate between it and a reality, form and for\nthe pragmatist indeed ARE, the CONCRETE relation of truth that may\nobtain between the idea and that reality. They, he says, are all\nthat we mean when we speak of the idea ’pointing’ to the reality,\n’fitting’ it, ’corresponding’ with it, or ’agreeing’ with it,–they\nor other similar mediating trains of verification. Such\nmediating events make the idea ’true.’ The idea itself, if it exists\nat all, is also a concrete event: so pragmatism insists that truth\nin the singular is only a collective name for truths in the plural,\nthese consisting always of series of definite events; and that what\nintellectualism calls the truth, the inherent truth, of any one such\nseries is only the abstract name for its truthfulness in act, for\nthe fact that the ideas there do lead to the supposed reality in a\nway that we consider satisfactory.",
        "The pragmatist himself has no objection to abstractions.\nElliptically, and ’for short,’ he relies on them as much as any one,\nending upon innumerable occasions that their comparative emptiness\nmakes of them useful substitutes for the overfulness of the facts he\nmeets, with. But he never ascribes to them a higher grade of\nreality. The full reality of a truth for him is always some process\nof verification, in which the abstract property of connecting ideas\nwith objects truly is workingly embodied. Meanwhile it is endlessly\nserviceable to be able to talk of properties abstractly and apart\nfrom their working, to find them the same in innumerable cases, to\ntake them ’out of time,’ and to treat of their relations to other\nsimilar abstractions. We thus form whole universes of platonic ideas\nante rem, universes in posse, tho none of them exists effectively\nexcept in rebus. Countless relations obtain there which nobody\nexperiences as obtaining,–as, in the eternal universe of musical\nrelations, for example, the notes of Aennchen von Tharau were a\nlovely melody long ere mortal ears ever heard them. Even so the\nmusic of the future sleeps now, to be awakened hereafter. Or, if we\ntake the world of geometrical relations, the thousandth decimal of\n’pi’ sleeps there, tho no one may ever try to compute it. Or, if\nwe take the universe of ’fitting,’ countless coats ’fit’ backs, and\ncountless boots ’fit’ feet, on which they are not practically\nFITTED; countless stones ’fit’ gaps in walls into which no one seeks\nto fit them actually. In the same way countless opinions ’fit’\nrealities, and countless truths are valid, tho no thinker\never thinks them.",
        "For the anti-pragmatist these prior timeless relations are the\npresupposition of the concrete ones, and possess the profounder\ndignity and value. The actual workings of our ideas in verification-\nprocesses are as naught in comparison with the ’obtainings’ of\nthis discarnate truth within them.",
        "For the pragmatist, on the contrary,–all discarnate truth is\nstatic, impotent, and relatively spectral, full truth being the\ntruth that energizes and does battle. Can any one suppose that the\nsleeping quality of truth would ever have been abstracted or have\nreceived a name, if truths had remained forever in that storage-\n vault of essential timeless ’agreements’ and had never been\nembodied in any panting struggle of men’s live ideas for\nverification? Surely no more than the abstract property of\n’fitting’ would have received a name, if in our world there had been\nno backs or feet or gaps in walls to be actually fitted. EXISTENTIAL\ntruth is incidental to the actual competition of opinions. ESSENTIAL\ntruth, the truth of the intellectualists, the truth with no one\nthinking it, is like the coat that fits tho no one has ever tried it\non, like the music that no ear has listened to. It is less real, not\nmore real, than the verified article; and to attribute a superior\ndegree of glory to it seems little more than a piece of perverse\nabstraction-worship. As well might a pencil insist that the outline\nis the essential thing in all pictorial representation, and chide\nthe paint-brush and the camera for omitting it, forgetting that\nTHEIR pictures not only contain the whole outline, but a hundred\nother things in addition. Pragmatist truth contains the whole of\nintellectualist truth and a hundred other things in addition.\nIntellectualist truth is then only pragmatist truth in posse.\nThat on innumerable occasions men do substitute truth in posse or\nverifiability, for verification or truth in act, is a fact to which\nno one attributes more importance than the pragmatist: he emphasizes\nthe practical utility of such a habit. But he does not on that\naccount consider truth in posse,–truth not alive enough ever to\nhave been asserted or questioned or contradicted, to be the\nmetaphysically prior thing, to which truths in act are tributary and\nsubsidiary. When intellectualists do this, pragmatism charges them\nwith inverting the real relation. Truth in posse MEANS only\ntruths in act; and he insists that these latter take precedence in\nthe order of logic as well as in that of being.",
        "Seventh Minunderstanding: Pragmatism Ignores the Theoretical\nInterest.",
        "This would seem to be an absolutely wanton slander, were not a\ncertain excuse to be found in the linguistic affinities of the word\n’pragmatism,’ and in certain offhand habits of speech of ours which\nassumed too great a generosity on our reader’s part. When we\nspoke of the meaning of ideas consisting “in their ’practical’\nconsequences”, or of the ’practical’ differences which our beliefs\nmake to us; when we said that the truth of a belief consists in\nits ’working’ value, etc.; our language evidently was too careless,\nfor by ’practical’ we were almost unanimously held to mean OPPOSED\nto theoretical or genuinely cognitive, and the consequence was\npunctually drawn that a truth in our eyes could have no relation to\nany independent reality, or to any other truth, or to anything\nwhatever but the acts which we might ground on it or the\nsatisfactions they might bring. The mere existence of the idea, all\nby itself, if only its results were satisfactory, would give full\ntruth to it, it was charged, in our absurd pragmatist epistemology.\nThe solemn attribution of this rubbish to us was also encouraged by\ntwo other circumstances. First, ideas ARE practically useful in the\nnarrow sense, false ideas sometimes, but most often ideas which we\ncan verify by the sum total of all their leadings, and the reality\nof whose objects may thus be considered established beyond\ndoubt. That these ideas should be true in advance of and apart from\ntheir utility, that, in other words, their objects should be\nreally there, is the very condition of their having that kind of\nutility,–the objects they connect us with are so important that the\nideas which serve as the objects’ substitutes grow important\nalso. This manner of their practical working was the first thing\nthat made truths good in the eyes of primitive men; and buried among\nall the other good workings by which true beliefs are\ncharacterized, this kind of subsequential utility remains.",
        "The second misleading circumstance was the emphasis laid by Schiller\nand Dewey on the fact that, unless a truth be relevant to the mind’s\nmomentary predicament, unless it be germane to the ’practical’\nsituation,–meaning by this the quite particular perplexity,–it is\nno good to urge it. It doesn’t meet our interests any better than a\nfalsehood would under the same circumstances. But why\nour predicaments and perplexities might not be theoretical here as\nwell as narrowly practical, I wish that our critics would explain.\nThey simply assume that no pragmatist CAN admit a genuinely\ntheoretic interest. Having used the phrase ’cash-value’ of an idea,\nI am implored by one correspondent to alter it, ’for every one\nthinks you mean only pecuniary profit and loss.’ Having said that\nthe true is ’the expedient in our thinking,’ I am rebuked in this\nwise by another learned correspondent:",
        "’The word expedient has no other meaning than that of self-interest.\nThe pursuit of this has ended by landing a number of officers\nof national banks in penitentiaries. A philosophy that leads to such\nresults must be unsound.’",
        "But the word ’practical’ is so habitually loosely used that more\nindulgence might have been expected. When one says that a sick\nman has now practically recovered, or that an enterprise has\npractically failed, one usually means I just the opposite of\npractically in the literal sense. One means that, altho untrue in\nstrict practice, what one says is true in theory, true virtually,\ncertain to be true. Again, by the practical one often means the\ndistinctively concrete, the individual, particular, and\neffective, as opposed to the abstract, general, and inert. To speak\nfor myself, whenever I have emphasized the practical nature of\ntruth, this is mainly what has been in my mind. ’Pragmata’\nare things in their plurality; and in that early California address,\nwhen I described pragmatism as holding that the meaning of any\nproposition can always be brought down to some\nparticular consequence in our future practical experience, whether\npassive or active, expressly added these qualifying words: the point\nlying rather in the fact that the experience must be particular than\nin the fact that it must be active,–by ’active’ meaning here\n’practical’ in the narrow literal sense. [Footnote: The ambiguity of\nthe word ’practical’ comes out well in these words of a recent\nwould-be reporter of our views: ’Pragmatism is an Anglo-Saxon\nreaction against the intellectualism and rationalism of the Latin\nmind.... Man, each individual man is the measure of things. He is\nable to conceive one but relative truths, that is to say, illusions.\nWhat these illusions are worth is revealed to him, not by general\ntheory, but by individual practice. Pragmatism, which consists\nin experiencing these illusions of the mind and obeying them\nby acting them out, is a PHILOSOPHY WITHOUT WORDS, a philosophy of\nGESTURES AND OF ACTS, which abandons what is general and olds only\nto what is particular.’ (Bourdeau, in Journal des. debats, October\n89, 1907.)] But particular consequences can perfectly well be of a\ntheoretic nature. Every remote fact which we infer from an idea is a\nparticular theoretic consequence which our mind practically works\ntowards. The loss of every old opinion of ours which we see that we\nshall have to give up if a new opinion be true, is a particular\ntheoretic as well as a particular practical consequence. After man’s\ninterest in breathing freely, the greatest of all his interests\n(because it never fluctuates or remits, as most of his\nphysical interests do), is his interest in consistency, in feeling\nthat what he now thinks goes with what he thinks on other occasions.\nWe tirelessly compare truth with truth for this sole purpose. Is the\npresent candidate for belief perhaps contradicted by principle\nnumber one? Is it compatible with fact number two? and so forth. The\nparticular operations here are the purely logical ones of analysis,\ndeduction, comparison, etc.; and altho general terms may be used ad\nlibitum, the satisfactory practical working of the candidate–idea\nconsists in the consciousness yielded by each successive theoretic\nconsequence in particular. It is therefore simply idiotic to repeat\nthat pragmatism takes no account of purely theoretic interests. All\nit insists on is that verity in act means VERIFICATIONS, and that\nthese are always particulars. Even in exclusively theoretic matters,\nit insists that vagueness and generality serve to verify nothing.",
        "Eighth Misunderstanding: Pragmatism Is Shut Up to Solipsism.",
        "I have already said something about this misconception under the\nthird and fourth heads, above, but a little more may be helpful. The\nobjection is apt to clothe itself in words like these: ’You make\ntruth to consist in every value except the cognitive value proper;\nyou always leave your knower at many removes (or, at the uttermost,\nat one remove) from his real object; the best you do is to let his\nideas carry him towards it; it remains forever outside of him,’ etc.",
        "I think that the leaven working here is the rooted intellectualist\npersuasion that, to know a reality, an idea must in some\ninscrutable fashion possess or be it. [Footnote: Sensations may,\nindeed, possess their objects or coalesce with them, as common sense\nsupposes that they do; and intuited differences between concepts may\ncoalesce with the ’eternal’ objective differences; but to simplify\nour discussion. here we can afford to abstract from these very\nspecial cases of knowing.] For pragmatism this kind of coalescence\nis inessential. As a rule our cognitions are only processes of mind\noff their balance and in motion towards real termini; and the\nreality of the termini, believed in by the states of mind in\nquestion, can be guaranteed only by some wider knower [Footnote: The\ntranscendental idealist thinks that, in some inexplicable way, the\nfinite states of mind are identical with the transfinite all-knower\nwhich he finds himself obliged to postulate in order to supply a\nfundamentum far the relation of knowing, as he apprehends it.\nPragmatists can leave the question of identity open; but they cannot\ndo without the wider knower any more than they can do without the\nreality, if they want to prove a case of knowing. They themselves\nplay the part of the absolute knower for the universe of discourse\nwhich serves them as material for epistemologizing. They warrant the\nreality there, and the subject’s true knowledge, there, of it.\nBut whether what they themselves say about that whole universe is\nobjectively true, i.e., whether the pragmatic theory of truth is\ntrue really, they cannot warrant,–they can only believe it To their\nhearers they can only propose it, as I propose it to my readers, as\nsomething to be verified ambulando, or by the way is which its\nconsequences may confirm it]. But if there is no reason extant in\nthe universe why they should be doubted, the beliefs are true in the\nonly sense in which anything can be true anyhow: they are\npractically and concretely true, namely. True in the mystical\nmongrel sense of an Identitatsphilosophie they need not be; nor is\nthere any intelligible reason why they ever need be true otherwise\nthan verifiably and practically. It is reality’s part to possess its\nown existence; it is thought’s part to get into ’touch’ with it by\ninnumerable paths of verification.",
        "I fear that the ’humanistic’ developments of pragmatism may cause a\ncertain difficulty here. We get at one truth only through the rest\nof truth; and the reality, everlastingly postulated as that which\nall our truth must keep in touch with, may never be given to us save\nin the form of truth other than that which we are now testing. But\nsince Dr. Schiller has shown that all our truths, even the most\nelemental, are affected by race-inheritance with a\nhuman coefficient, reality per se thus may appear only as a sort of\nlimit; it may be held to shrivel to the mere PLACE for an object,\nand what is known may be held to be only matter of our psyche that\nwe fill the place with. It must be confessed that pragmatism, worked\nin this humanistic way, is COMPATIBLE with solipsism. It joins\nfriendly hands with the agnostic part of kantism, with\ncontemporary agnosticism, and with idealism generally. But worked\nthus, it is a metaphysical theory about the matter of reality, and\nflies far beyond pragmatism’s own modest analysis of the nature of\nthe knowing function, which analysis may just as harmoniously be\ncombined with less humanistic accounts of reality. One\nof pragmatism’s merits is that it is so purely epistemological. It\nmust assume realities; but it prejudges nothing as to their\nconstitution, and the most diverse metaphysics can use it as\ntheir foundation. It certainly has no special affinity with\nsolipsism.",
        "As I look back over what I have written, much of it gives me a queer\nimpression, as if the obvious were set forth so condescendingly that\nreaders might well laugh at my pomposity. It may be, however, that\nconcreteness as radical as ours is not so obvious. The\nwhole originality of pragmatism, the whole point in it, is its use\nof the concrete way of seeing. It begins with concreteness, and\nreturns and ends with it. Dr. Schiller, with his two\n’practical’ aspects of truth, (1) relevancy to situation, and (2)\nsubsequential utility, is only filling the cup of concreteness to\nthe brim for us. Once seize that cup, and you cannot misunderstand\npragmatism. It seems as if the power of imagining the world\nconcretely MIGHT have been common enough to let our readers\napprehend us better, as if they might have read between our\nlines, and, in spite of all our infelicities of expression, guessed\na little more correctly what our thought was. But alas! this was not\non fate’s programme, so we can only think, with the German ditty:–",
        "   “Es waer’ zu schoen gewesen, Es hat nicht sollen sein.”",
        "[Footnote: Remarks at the meeting of the American Philosophical\nAssociation, Cornell University, December, 1907.]",
        "My account of truth is realistic, and follows the epistemological\ndualism of common sense. Suppose I say to you ’The thing exists’–\nis that true or not? How can you tell? Not till my statement has\ndeveloped its meaning farther is it determined as being true, false,\nor irrelevant to reality altogether. But if now you ask ’what\nthing?’ and I reply ’a desk’; if you ask ’where?’ and I point to a\nplace; if you ask ’does it exist materially, or only in\nimagination?’ and I say ’materially’; if moreover I say ’I mean that\ndesk’ and then grasp and shake a desk which you see just as I have\ndescribed it, you are willing to call my statement true. But you and\nI are commutable here; we can exchange places; and, as you go bail\nfor my desk, so I can go bail for yours.",
        "This notion of a reality independent of either of us, taken from\nordinary social experience, lies at the base of the pragmatist\ndefinition of truth. With some such reality any statement, in order\nto be counted true, must agree. Pragmatism defines ’agreeing’ to\nmean certain ways of ’working,’ be they actual or potential. Thus,\nfor my statement ’the desk exists’ to be true of a desk recognized\nas real by you, it must be able to lead me to shake your desk, to\nexplain myself by words that suggest that desk to your mind, to make\na drawing that is like the desk you see, etc. Only in such ways as\nthis is there sense in saying it agrees with THAT reality, only thus\ndoes it gain for me the satisfaction of hearing you corroborate me.\nReference then to something determinate, and some sort of adaptation\nto it worthy of the name of agreement, are thus constituent elements\nin the definition of any statement of mine as ’true’.",
        "You cannot get at either the reference or the adaptation without\nusing the notion of the workings. THAT the thing is, WHAT it is,\nand WHICH it is (of all the possible things with that what) are\npoints determinable only by the pragmatic method. The ’which’ means\na possibility of pointing, or of otherwise singling out the special\nobject; the ’what’ means choice on our part of an essential aspect\nto conceive it by (and this is always relative to what Dewey\ncalls our own ’situation’); and the ’that’ means our assumption of\nthe attitude of belief, the reality-recognizing attitude. Surely\nfor understanding what the word ’true’ means as applied to a\nstatement, the mention of such workings is indispensable. Surely if\nwe leave them out the subject and the object of the\ncognitive relation float-in the same universe, ’tis true–but\nvaguely and ignorantly and without mutual contact or mediation.",
        "Our critics nevertheless call the workings inessential. No\nfunctional possibilities ’make’ our beliefs true, they say; they are\ntrue inherently, true positively, born ’true’ as the Count of\nChambord was born ’Henri-Cinq.’ Pragmatism insists, on the contrary,\nthat statements and beliefs are thus inertly and statically true\nonly by courtesy: they practically pass for true; but you CANNOT\nDEFINE WHAT YOU MEAN by calling them true without referring to\ntheir functional possibilities. These give its whole LOGICAL CONTENT\nto that relation to reality on a belief’s part to which the name\n’truth’ is applied, a relation which otherwise remains one of mere\ncoexistence or bare withness.",
        "The foregoing statements reproduce the essential content of the\nlecture on Truth in my book PRAGMATISM. Schiller’s doctrine of\n’humanism,’ Dewey’s ’Studies in logical theory,’ and my own ’radical\nempiricism,’ all involve this general notion of truth as ’working,’\neither actual or conceivable. But they envelop it as only one detail\nin the midst of much wider theories that aim eventually at\ndetermining the notion of what ’reality’ at large is in its ultimate\nnature and constitution.",
        "[Footnote: Originally printed under the title of ’Truth versus\nTruthfulness,’ in the Journal of Philosophy.]",
        "My account of truth is purely logical and relates to its definition\nonly. I contend that you cannot tell what the WORD ’true’ MEANS,\nas applied to a statement, without invoking the CONCEPT OF THE\nSTATEMENTS WORKINGS.",
        "Assume, to fix our ideas, a universe composed of two things only:\nimperial Caesar dead and turned to clay, and me, saying\n’Caesar really existed.’ Most persons would naively deem truth to be\nthereby uttered, and say that by a sort of actio in distans my\nstatement had taken direct hold of the other fact.",
        "But have my words so certainly denoted THAT Caesar?–or so certainly\nconnoted HIS individual attributes? To fill out the complete measure\nof what the epithet ’true’ may ideally mean, my thought ought to\nbear a fully determinate and unambiguous ’one-to-one-relation’ to\nits own particular object. In the ultrasimple universe imagined the\nreference is uncertified. Were there two Caesars we shouldn’t know\nwhich was meant. The conditions of truth thus seem incomplete in\nthis universe of discourse so that it must be enlarged.",
        " Transcendentalists enlarge it by invoking an absolute mind which,\nas it owns all the facts, can sovereignly correlate them. If it\nintends that my statement SHALL refer to that identical Caesar, and\nthat the attributes I have in mind SHALL mean his attributes, that\nintention suffices to make the statement true.",
        " I, in turn, enlarge the universe by admitting finite intermediaries\nbetween the two original facts. Caesar HAD, and my statement HAS,\neffects; and if these effects in any way run together, a concrete\nmedium and bottom is provided for the determinate cognitive\nrelation, which, as a pure ACTIO IN DISTANS, seemed to float too\nvaguely and unintelligibly.",
        " The real Caesar, for example, wrote a manuscript of which I see a\nreal reprint, and say ’the Caesar I mean is the author of THAT.’\nThe workings of my thought thus determine both its denotative and\nits connotative significance more fully. It now defines itself as\nneither irrelevant to the real Caesar, nor false in what it suggests\nof him. The absolute mind, seeing me thus working towards Caesar\nthrough the cosmic intermediaries, might well say: ’Such workings\nonly specify in detail what I meant myself by the statement being\ntrue. I decree the cognitive relation between the two original facts\nto mean that just that kind of concrete chain of intermediaries\nexists or can exist.’",
        "But the chain involves facts prior to the statement the logical\nconditions of whose truth we are defining, and facts subsequent to\nit; and this circumstance, coupled with the vulgar employment of the\nterms truth and fact as synonyms, has laid my account open\nto misapprehension. ’How,’ it is confusedly asked, ’can Caesar’s\nexistence, a truth already 2000 years old, depend for its truth on\nanything about to happen now? How can my acknowledgment of it be\nmade true by the acknowledgment’s own effects? The effects may\nindeed confirm my belief, but the belief was made true already by\nthe fact that Caesar really did exist.’",
        "Well, be it so, for if there were no Caesar, there could, of course,\nbe no positive truth about him–but then distinguish between ’true’\nas being positively and completely so established, and ’true’ as\nbeing so only ’practically,’ elliptically, and by courtesy, in\nthe sense of not being positively irrelevant or UNtrue. Remember\nalso that Caesar’s having existed in fact may make a present\nstatement false or irrelevant as well as it may make it true, and\nthat in neither case does it itself have to alter. It being given,\nwhether truth, untruth, or irrelevancy shall be also given\ndepends on something coming from the statement itself. What\npragmatism contends for is that you cannot adequately DEFINE the\nsomething if you leave the notion of the statement’s functional\nworkings out of your account. Truth meaning agreement with reality,\nthe mode of the agreeing is a practical problem which the subjective\nterm of the relation alone can solve.",
        "Note. This paper was originally followed by a couple of\nparagraphs meant to conciliate the intellectualist opposition.\nSince you love the word ’true’ so, and since you despise so the\nconcrete working of our ideas, I said, keep the word ’truth’ for the\nsaltatory and incomprehensible relation you care so much for, and I\nwill say of thoughts that know their objects in an intelligible\nsense that they are ’truthful.’",
        "Like most offerings, this one has been spurned, so I revoke it,\nrepenting of my generosity. Professor Pratt, in his recent book,\ncalls any objective state of FACTS ’a truth,’ and uses the word\n’trueness’ in the sense of ’truth’ as proposed by me. Mr. Hawtrey\n(see below, page 281) uses ’correctness’ in the same sense. Apart\nfrom the general evil of ambiguous vocabularies, we may really\nforsake all hope, if the term ’truth’ is officially to lose its\nstatus as a property of our beliefs and opinions, and become\nrecognized as a technical synonym for ’fact.’",
        "[Footnote: Reprinted from the Journal of Philosophy, etc., 1906.]",
        "Professor W. A. Brown, in the Journal for August 15, approves my\npragmatism for allowing that a belief in the absolute may give\nholidays to the spirit, but takes me to task for the narrowness of\nthis concession, and shows by striking examples how great a power\nthe same belief may have in letting loose the strenuous life.",
        "I have no criticism whatever to make upon his excellent article, but\nlet me explain why ’moral holidays’ were the only gift of\nthe absolute which I picked out for emphasis. I was primarily\nconcerned in my lectures with contrasting the belief that the world\nis still in process of making with the belief that there is\nan ’eternal’ edition of it ready-made and complete. The former, or\n’pluralistic’ belief, was the one that my pragmatism favored.\nBoth beliefs confirm our strenuous moods. Pluralism actually demands\nthem, since it makes the world’s salvation depend upon the\nenergizing of its several parts, among which we are. Monism permits\nthem, for however furious they may be, we can always justify\nourselves in advance for indulging them by the thought that they\nWILL HAVE BEEN expressions of the absolute’s perfect life. By\nescaping from your finite perceptions to the conception of\nthe eternal whole, you can hallow any tendency whatever. Tho the\nabsolute DICTATES nothing, it will SANCTION anything and everything\nafter the fact, for whatever is once there will have to be regarded\nas an integral member of the universe’s perfection. Quietism and\nfrenzy thus alike receive the absolute’s permit to exist. Those of\nus who are naturally inert may abide in our resigned passivity;\nthose whose energy is excessive may grow more reckless still.\nHistory shows how easily both quietists and fanatics have drawn\ninspiration from the absolutistic scheme. It suits sick souls\nand strenuous ones equally well.",
        "One cannot say thus of pluralism. Its world is always vulnerable,\nfor some part may go astray; and having no ’eternal’ edition of\nit to draw comfort from, its partisans must always feel to some\ndegree insecure. If, as pluralists, we grant ourselves moral\nholidays, they can only be provisional breathing-spells, intended to\nrefresh us for the morrow’s fight. This forms one permanent\ninferiority of pluralism from the pragmatic point of view. It has no\nsaving message for incurably sick souls. Absolutism, among its other\nmessages, has that message, and is the only scheme that has it\nnecessarily. That constitutes its chief superiority and is the\nsource of its religious power. That is why, desiring to do it full\njustice, I valued its aptitude for moral-holiday giving so highly.\nIts claims in that way are unique, whereas its affinities with\nstrenuousness are less emphatic than those of the pluralistic\nscheme.",
        "In the last lecture of my book I candidly admitted this inferiority\nof pluralism. It lacks the wide indifference that absolutism shows.\nIt is bound to disappoint many sick souls whom absolutism can\nconsole. It seems therefore poor tactics for absolutists to make\nlittle of this advantage. The needs of sick souls are surely the\nmost urgent; and believers in the absolute should rather hold it to\nbe great merit in their philosophy that it can meet them so well.",
        "The pragmatism or pluralism which I defend has to fall back on a\ncertain ultimate hardihood, a certain willingness to live\nwithout assurances or guarantees. To minds thus willing to live on\npossibilities that are not certainties, quietistic religion, sure of\nsalvation ANY HOW, has a slight flavor of fatty degeneration about\nit which has caused it to be looked askance on, even in the church.\nWhich side is right here, who can say? Within religion, emotion is\napt to be tyrannical; but philosophy must favor the emotion that\nallies itself best with the whole body and drift of all the\ntruths in sight. I conceive this to be the more strenuous type of\nemotion; but I have to admit that its inability to let loose\nquietistic raptures is a serious deficiency in the pluralistic\nphilosophy which I profess.",
        "[Footnote: Reprint from the Journal of Philosophy for December 3,\n1908 (vol. v, p. 689), of a review of Le Pragmatisme et ses Diverses\nFormes Anglo-Americaines, by Marcel Hebert. (Paris: Librairie\ncritique Emile Nourry. 1908. Pp. 105.)]",
        "Professor Marcel Hebert is a singularly erudite and liberal thinker\n(a seceder, I believe, from the Catholic priesthood) and\nan uncommonly direct and clear writer. His book Le Divin is one of\nthe ablest reviews of the general subject of religious philosophy\nwhich recent years have produced; and in the small volume the title\nof which is copied above he has, perhaps, taken more pains not to do\ninjustice to pragmatism than any of its numerous critics. Yet the\nusual fatal misapprehension of its purposes vitiates his exposition\nand his critique. His pamphlet seems to me to form a worthy hook, as\nit were, on which to hang one more attempt to tell the reader what\nthe pragmatist account of truth really means.",
        "M. Hebert takes it to mean what most people take it to mean, the\ndoctrine, namely, that whatever proves subjectively expedient in\nthe way of our thinking is ’true’ in the absolute and unrestricted\nsense of the word, whether it corresponds to any objective state of\nthings outside of our thought or not. Assuming this to be the\npragmatist thesis, M. Hebert opposes it at length. Thought that\nproves itself to be thus expedient may, indeed, have every\nOTHER kind of value for the thinker, he says, but cognitive value,\nrepresentative value, VALEUR DE CONNAISSANCE PROPREMENT DITE, it has\nnot; and when it does have a high degree of general utility value,\nthis is in every case derived from its previous value in the way of\ncorrectly representing independent objects that have an\nimportant influence on our lives. Only by thus representing things\ntruly do we reap the useful fruits. But the fruits follow on the\ntruth, they do not constitute it; so M. Hebert accuses pragmatism of\ntelling us everything about truth except what it essentially is. He\nadmits, indeed, that the world is so framed that when men have true\nideas of realities, consequential utilities ensue in abundance; and\nno one of our critics, I think, has shown as concrete a sense of the\nvariety of these utilities as he has; but he reiterates that,\nwhereas such utilities are secondary, we insist on treating them\nas primary, and that the connaissance objective from which they draw\nall their being is something which we neglect, exclude, and\ndestroy. The utilitarian value and the strictly cognitive value of\nour ideas may perfectly well harmonize, he says–and in the main he\nallows that they do harmonize–but they are not logically identical\nfor that. He admits that subjective interests, desires, impulses may\neven have the active ’primacy’ in our intellectual life. Cognition\nawakens only at their spur, and follows their cues and aims; yet,\nwhen it IS awakened, it is objective cognition proper and not\nmerely another name for the impulsive tendencies themselves in the\nstate of satisfaction. The owner of a picture ascribed to Corot\ngets uneasy when its authenticity is doubted. He looks up its origin\nand is reassured. But his uneasiness does not make the\nproposition false, any more than his relief makes the\nproposition true, that the actual Corot was the painter. Pragmatism,\nwhich, according to M. Hebert, claims that our sentiments MAKE truth\nand falsehood, would oblige us to conclude that our minds exert no\ngenuinely cognitive function whatever.",
        "This subjectivist interpretation of our position seems to follow\nfrom my having happened to write (without supposing it necessary\nto explain that I was treating of cognition solely on its subjective\nside) that in the long run the true is the expedient in the way of\nour thinking, much as the good is the expedient in the way of our\nbehavior! Having previously written that truth means ’agreement with\nreality,’ and insisted that the chief part of the expediency of any\none opinion is its agreement with the rest of acknowledged truth, I\napprehended no exclusively subjectivistic reading of my meaning. My\nmind was so filled with the notion of objective reference that I\nnever dreamed that my hearers would let go of it; and the very\nlast accusation I expected was that in speaking of ideas and their\nsatisfactions, I was denying realities outside. My only wonder now\nis that critics should have found so silly a personage as I must\nhave seemed in their eyes, worthy of explicit refutation.",
        "The object, for me, is just as much one part of reality as the idea\nis another part. The truth of the idea is one relation of it to the\nreality, just as its date and its place are other relations. All\nthree relations CONSIST of intervening parts of the universe which\ncan in every particular case be assigned and catalogued, and\nwhich differ in every instance of truth, just as they differ with\nevery date and place.",
        "The pragmatist thesis, as Dr. Schiller and I hold it,–I prefer to\nlet Professor Dewey speak for himself,–is that the relation called\n’truth’ is thus concretely DEFINABLE. Ours is the only articulate\nattempt in the field to say positively what truth actually CONSISTS\nOF. Our denouncers have literally nothing to oppose to it as an\nalternative. For them, when an idea is true, it IS true, and there\nthe matter terminates; the word ’true’ being indefinable. The\nrelation of the true idea to its object, being, as they think,\nunique, it can be expressed in terms of nothing else, and needs only\nto be named for any one to recognize and understand it. Moreover it\nis invariable and universal, the same in every single instance of\ntruth, however diverse the ideas, the realities, and the other\nrelations between them may be.",
        "Our pragmatist view, on the contrary, is that the truth-relation is\na definitely experienceable relation, and therefore describable as\nwell as namable; that it is not unique in kind, and neither\ninvariable nor universal. The relation to its object that makes an\nidea true in any given instance, is, we say, embodied in\nintermediate details of reality which lead towards the object, which\nvary in every instance, and which in every instance can be\nconcretely traced. The chain of workings which an opinion sets up IS\nthe opinion’s truth, falsehood, or irrelevancy, as the case may\nbe. Every idea that a man has works some consequences in him, in the\nshape either of bodily actions or of other ideas. Through these\nconsequences the man’s relations to surrounding realities are\nmodified. He is carried nearer to some of them and farther from\nothers, and gets now the feeling that the idea has\nworked satisfactorily, now that it has not. The idea has put him\ninto touch with something that fulfils its intent, or it has not.",
        "This something is the MAN’S OBJECT, primarily. Since the only\nrealities we can talk about are such OBJECTS-BELIEVED-IN, the\npragmatist, whenever he says ’reality,’ means in the first instance\nwhat may count for the man himself as a reality, what he believes at\nthe moment to be such. Sometimes the reality is a concrete sensible\npresence. The idea, for example, may be that a certain door opens\ninto a room where a glass of beer may be bought. If opening the door\nleads to the actual sight and taste of the beer, the man calls the\nidea true. Or his idea may be that of an abstract relation, say of\nthat between the sides and the hypothenuse of a triangle, such a\nrelation being, of course, a reality quite as much as a glass\nof beer is. If the thought of such a relation leads him to draw\nauxiliary lines and to compare the figures they make, he may at\nlast, perceiving one equality after another, SEE the\nrelation thought of, by a vision quite as particular and direct as\nwas the taste of the beer. If he does so, he calls THAT idea, also,\ntrue. His idea has, in each case, brought him into closer touch with\na reality felt at the moment to verify just that idea. Each reality\nverifies and validates its own idea exclusively; and in each case\nthe verification consists in the satisfactorily-ending consequences,\nmental or physical, which the idea was able to set up. These\n’workings’ differ in every single instance, they never\ntranscend experience, they consist of particulars, mental or\nsensible, and they admit of concrete description in every individual\ncase. Pragmatists are unable to see what you can possibly MEAN by\ncalling an idea true, unless you mean that between it as a terminus\na quo in some one’s mind and some particular reality as a terminus\nad quem, such concrete workings do or may intervene. Their direction\nconstitutes the idea’s reference to that reality,\ntheir satisfactoriness constitutes its adaptation thereto, and the\ntwo things together constitute the ’truth’ of the idea for its\npossessor. Without such intermediating portions of concretely real\nexperience the pragmatist sees no materials out of which the\nadaptive relation called truth can be built up.",
        "The anti-pragmatist view is that the workings are but evidences of\nthe truth’s previous inherent presence in the idea, and that you can\nwipe the very possibility of them out of existence and still leave\nthe truth of the idea as solid as ever. But surely this is not a\ncounter-theory of truth to ours. It is the renunciation of all\narticulate theory. It is but a claim to the right to call certain\nideas true anyhow; and this is what I meant above by saying that\nthe anti-pragmatists offer us no real alternative, and that our\naccount is literally the only positive theory extant. What meaning,\nindeed, can an idea’s truth have save its power of adapting us\neither mentally or physically to a reality?",
        "How comes it, then, that our critics so uniformly accuse us of\nsubjectivism, of denying the reality’s existence? It comes, I think,\nfrom the necessary predominance of subjective language in our\nanalysis. However independent and elective realities may be, we can\ntalk about them, in framing our accounts of truth, only as so many\nobjects believed-in. But the process of experience leads men so\ncontinually to supersede their older objects by newer ones\nwhich they find it more satisfactory to believe in, that the notion\nof an ABSOLUTE reality inevitably arises as a grenzbegriff,\nequivalent to that of an object that shall never be superseded,\nand belief in which shall be endgueltig. Cognitively we thus live\nunder a sort of rule of three: as our private concepts represent the\nsense-objects to which they lead us, these being public realities\nindependent of the individual, so these sense-realities may, in\nturn, represent realities of a hypersensible order, electrons, mind-\nstuff. God, or what not, existing independently of all human\nthinkers. The notion of such final realities, knowledge of\nwhich would be absolute truth, is an outgrowth of our cognitive\nexperience from which neither pragmatists nor anti-pragmatists\nescape. They form an inevitable regulative postulate in every one’s\nthinking. Our notion of them is the most abundantly suggested and\nsatisfied of all our beliefs, the last to suffer doubt. The\ndifference is that our critics use this belief as their sole\nparadigm, and treat any one who talks of human realities as if he\nthought the notion of reality ’in itself’ illegitimate. Meanwhile,\nreality-in-itself, so far as by them TALKED OF, is only a human\nobject; they postulate it just as we postulate it; and if we are\nsubjectivists they are so no less. Realities in themselves can be\nthere FOR any one, whether pragmatist or anti-pragmatist, only by\nbeing believed; they are believed only by their notions appearing\ntrue; and their notions appear true only because they work\nsatisfactorily. Satisfactorily, moreover, for the\nparticular thinker’s purpose. There is no idea which is THE true\nidea, of anything. Whose is THE true idea of the absolute? Or to\ntake M. Hebert’s example, what is THE true idea of a picture which\nyou possess? It is the idea that most satisfactorily meets your\npresent interest. The interest may be in the picture’s place,\nits age, its ’tone,’ its subject, its dimensions, its authorship,\nits price, its merit, or what not. If its authorship by Corot have\nbeen doubted, what will satisfy the interest aroused in you at that\nmoment will be to have your claim to own a Corot confirmed; but, if\nyou have a normal human mind, merely calling it a Corot will\nnot satisfy other demands of your mind at the same time. For THEM to\nbe satisfied, what you learn of the picture must make smooth\nconnection with what you know of the rest of the system of reality\nin which the actual Corot played his part. M. Hebert accuses us of\nholding that the proprietary satisfactions of themselves suffice to\nmake the belief true, and that, so far as we are concerned, no\nactual Corot need ever have existed. Why we should be thus cut off\nfrom the more general and intellectual satisfactions, I know not;\nbut whatever the satisfactions may be, intellectual or proprietary,\nthey belong to the subjective side of the truth-relation. They found\nour beliefs; our beliefs are in realities; if no realities are\nthere, the beliefs are false but if realities are there, how they\ncan even be KNOWN without first being BELIEVED; or how BELIEVED\nexcept by our first having ideas of them that work satisfactorily,\npragmatists find it impossible to imagine. They also find\nit impossible to imagine what makes the anti-pragmatists’ dogmatic\n’ipse dixit’ assurance of reality more credible than the\npragmatists conviction based on concrete verifications. M. Hebert\nwill probably agree to this, when put in this way, so I do not see\nour inferiority to him in the matter of connaissance\nproprement dite.",
        "Some readers will say that, altho I may possibly believe in\nrealities beyond our ideas Dr. Schiller, at any rate, does not. This\nis a great misunderstanding, for Schiller’s doctrine and mine are\nidentical, only our exposition follow different directions. He\nstarts from the subjective pole of the chain, the individual with\nhis beliefs, as the more concrete and immediately given phenomenon.\n’An individual claims his belief to be true,’ Schiller says,\n’but what does he mean by true? and how does he establish the\nclaim?’ With these questions we embark on a psychological inquiry.\nTo be true, it appears, means, FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL, to work\nsatisfactorily for him; and the working and the satisfaction, since\nthey vary from case to case, admit of no universal description. What\nworks is true and represents a reality, for the individual for whom\nit works. If he is infallible, the reality is ’really’ there; if\nmistaken it is not there, or not there as he thinks it. We all\nbelieve, when our ideas work satisfactorily; but we don’t yet know\nwho of us is infallible; so that the problem of truth and that of\nerror are EBENBURTIG and arise out of the same situations. Schiller,\nremaining with the fallible individual, and treating only of\nreality-for-him, seems to many of his readers to ignore reality-in-\nitself altogether. But that is because he seeks only to tell us how\ntruths are attained, not what the content of those truths, when\nattained, shall be. It may be that the truest of all beliefs shall\nbe that in transsubjective realities. It certainly SEEMS the\ntruest for no rival belief is as voluminously satisfactory, and it\nis probably Dr. Schiller’s own belief; but he is not required, for\nhis immediate purpose, to profess it. Still less is he obliged to\nassume it in advance as the basis of his discussion.",
        "I, however, warned by the ways of critics, adopt different tactics.\nI start from the object-pole of the idea-reality chain and follow\nit in the opposite direction from Schiller’s. Anticipating the\nresults of the general truth-processes of mankind, I begin with the\nabstract notion of an objective reality. I postulate it, and ask on\nmy own account, I VOUCHING FOR THIS REALITY, what would make any one\nelse’s idea of it true for me as well as for him. But I find no\ndifferent answer from that which Schiller gives. If the other man’s\nidea leads him, not only to believe that the reality is there, but\nto use it as the reality’s temporary substitute, by letting it evoke\nadaptive thoughts and acts similar to those which the reality itself\nwould provoke, then it is true in the only intelligible sense,\ntrue through its particular consequences, and true for me as well as\nfor the man.",
        "My account is more of a logical definition; Schiller’s is more of a\npsychological description. Both treat an absolutely identical\nmatter of experience, only they traverse it in opposite ways.",
        "Possibly these explanations may satisfy M. Hebert, whose little\nbook, apart from the false accusation of subjectivism, gives a\nfairly instructive account of the pragmatist epistemology.",
        "Abstract concepts, such as elasticity, voluminousness,\ndisconnectedness, are salient aspects of our concrete experiences\nwhich we find it useful to single out. Useful, because we are then\nreminded of other things that offer those same aspects; and, if the\naspects carry consequences in those other things, we can return to\nour first things, expecting those same consequences to accrue.",
        "To be helped to anticipate consequences is always a gain, and such\nbeing the help that abstract concepts give us, it is obvious that\ntheir use is fulfilled only when we get back again into concrete\nparticulars by their means, bearing the consequences in our minds,\nand enriching our notion of the original objects therewithal.",
        "Without abstract concepts to handle our perceptual particulars by,\nwe are like men hopping on one foot. Using concepts along with the\nparticulars, we become bipedal. We throw our concept forward, get a\nfoothold on the consequence, hitch our line to this, and draw\nour percept up, travelling thus with a hop, skip and jump over the\nsurface of life at a vastly rapider rate than if we merely waded\nthrough the thickness of the particulars as accident rained\nthem down upon our heads. Animals have to do this, but men raise\ntheir heads higher and breathe freely in the upper conceptual air.",
        " The enormous esteem professed by all philosophers for the\nconceptual form of consciousness is easy to understand. From Plato’s\ntime downwards it has been held to be our sole avenue to essential\ntruth. Concepts are universal, changeless, pure; their relations\nare eternal; they are spiritual, while the concrete particulars\nwhich they enable us to handle are corrupted by the flesh. They are\nprecious in themselves, then, apart from their original use, and\nconfer new dignity upon our life.",
        "One can find no fault with this way of feeling about concepts so\nlong as their original function does not get swallowed up in\nthe admiration and lost. That function is of course to enlarge\nmentally our momentary experiences by ADDING to them the\nconsequences conceived; but unfortunately, that function is not only\ntoo often forgotten by philosophers in their reasonings, but is\noften converted into its exact opposite, and made a means of\ndiminishing the original experience by DENYING (implicitly or\nexplicitly) all its features save the one specially abstracted to\nconceive it by.",
        "This itself is a highly abstract way of stating my complaint, and it\nneeds to be redeemed from obscurity by showing instances of what is\nmeant. Some beliefs very dear to my own heart have been conceived in\nthis viciously abstract way by critics. One is the ’will\nto believe,’ so called; another is the indeterminism of certain\nfutures; a third is the notion that truth may vary with the\nstandpoint of the man who holds it. I believe that the perverse\nabuse of the abstracting function has led critics to employ false\narguments against these doctrines, and often has led their readers\nto false conclusions. I should like to try to save the situation, if\npossible, by a few counter-critical remarks.",
        "Let me give the name of ’vicious abstractionism’ to a way of using\nconcepts which may be thus described: We conceive a concrete\nsituation by singling out some salient or important feature in it,\nand classing it under that; then, instead of adding to its previous\ncharacters all the positive consequences which the new way of\nconceiving it may bring, we proceed to use our concept privatively;\nreducing the originally rich phenomenon to the naked suggestions of\nthat name abstractly taken, treating it as a case of ’nothing but’\nthat concept, and acting as if all the other characters from out of\nwhich the concept is abstracted were expunged. [Footnote: Let not\nthe reader confound the fallacy here described with legitimately\nnegative inferences such as those drawn in the mood ’celarent’ of\nthe logic-books.] Abstraction, functioning in this way, becomes a\nmeans of arrest far more than a means of advance in thought. It\nmutilates things; it creates difficulties and finds impossibilities;\nand more than half the trouble that metaphysicians and logicians\ngive themselves over the paradoxes and dialectic puzzles of the\nuniverse may, I am convinced, be traced to this relatively simple\nsource. THE VICIOUSLY PRIVATIVE EMPLOYMENT OF ABSTRACT CHARACTERS\nAND CLASS NAMES is, I am persuaded, one of the great original sins\nof the rationalistic mind.",
        "To proceed immediately to concrete examples, cast a glance at the\nbelief in ’free will,’ demolished with such specious\npersuasiveness recently by the skilful hand of Professor Fullerton.\n[Footnote: Popular Science Monthly, N. Y., vols. lviii and lix.]\nWhen a common man says that his will is free, what does he mean? He\nmeans that there are situations of bifurcation inside of his life in\nwhich two futures seem to him equally possible, for both have their\nroots equally planted in his present and his past. Either,\nif realized, will grow out of his previous motives, character and\ncircumstances, and will continue uninterruptedly the pulsations of\nhis personal life. But sometimes both at once are incompatible with\nphysical nature, and then it seems to the naive observer as if he\nmade a choice between them NOW, and that the question of which\nfuture is to be, instead of having been decided at the foundation of\nthe world, were decided afresh at every passing moment in I which\nfact seems livingly to grow, and possibility seems, in turning\nitself towards one act, to exclude all others.",
        "He who takes things at their face-value here may indeed be deceived.\nHe may far too often mistake his private ignorance of what\nis predetermined for a real indetermination of what is to be. Yet,\nhowever imaginary it may be, his picture of the situation offers no\nappearance of breach between the past and future. A train is the\nsame train, its passengers are the same passengers, its momentum is\nthe same momentum, no matter which way the switch which fixes its\ndirection is placed. For the indeterminist there is at all times\nenough past for all the different futures in sight, and\nmore besides, to find their reasons in it, and whichever future\ncomes will slide out of that past as easily as the train slides by\nthe switch. The world, in short, is just as CONTINUOUS WITH\nITSELF for the believers in free will as for the\nrigorous determinists, only the latter are unable to believe in\npoints of bifurcation as spots of really indifferent equilibrium or\nas containing shunts which there–and there only, NOT BEFORE–\n direct existing motions without altering their amount.",
        "Were there such spots of indifference, the rigorous determinists\nthink, the future and the past would be separated absolutely,\nfor, ABSTRACTLY TAKEN, THE WORD ’INDIFFERENT’ SUGGESTS DISCONNECTION\nSOLELY. Whatever is indifferent is in so far forth unrelated and\ndetached. Take the term thus strictly, and you see, they tell\nus, that if any spot of indifference is found upon the broad highway\nbetween the past and the future, then no connection of any sort\nwhatever, no continuous momentum, no identical passenger, no common\naim or agent, can be found on both sides of the shunt or\nswitch which there is moved. The place is an impassable chasm.",
        "Mr. Fullerton writes–the italics are mine–as follows:–",
        "’In so far as my action is free, what I have been, what I am, what I\nhave always done or striven to do, what I most earnestly wish\nor resolve to do at the present moment–these things can have NO\nMORE TO DO WITH ITS FUTURE REALIZATION THAN IF THEY HAD NO\nEXISTENCE.... The possibility is a hideous one; and surely even the\nmost ardent free-willist will, when he contemplates it frankly,\nexcuse me for hoping that if I am free I am at least not very\nfree, and that I may reasonably expect to find SOME degree of\nconsistency in my life and actions. ... Suppose that I have given a\ndollar to a blind beggar. Can I, if it is really an act of free-\nwill, be properly said to have given the money? Was it given because\nI was a man of tender heart, etc., etc.? ... What has all this to do\nwith acts of free-will? If they are free, they must not be\nconditioned by antecedent circumstances of any sort, by the\nmisery of the beggar, by the pity in the heart of the passer-by.\nThey must be causeless, not determined. They must drop from a clear\nsky out of the void, for just in so far as they can be accounted\nfor, they are not free.’ [Footnote: Loc. cit., vol. lviii, pp. 189,\n188.]",
        "Heaven forbid that I should get entangled here in a controversy\nabout the rights and wrongs of the free-will question at large, for\nI am only trying to illustrate vicious abstractionism by the conduct\nof some of the doctrine’s assailants. The moments of bifurcation,\nas the indeterminist seems to himself to experience them, are\nmoments both of re-direction and of continuation. But because in\nthe ’either–or’ of the re-direction we hesitate, the determinist\nabstracts this little element of discontinuity from the\nsuperabundant continuities of the experience, and cancels in\nits behalf all the connective characters with which the latter is\nfilled. Choice, for him, means henceforward DISconnection pure and\nsimple, something undetermined in advance IN ANY RESPECT WHATEVER,\nand a life of choices must be a raving chaos, at no two moments\nof which could we be treated as one and the same man. If Nero were\n’free’ at. the moment of ordering his mother’s murder, Mr. McTaggart\n[Footnote: Some Dogmas of Religion, p. 179.] assures us that no one\nwould have the right at any other moment to call him a bad man, for\nhe would then be an absolutely other Nero.",
        "A polemic author ought not merely to destroy his victim. He ought to\ntry a bit to make him feel his error–perhaps not enough to convert\nhim, but enough to give him a bad conscience and to weaken the\nenergy of his defence. These violent caricatures of men’s beliefs\narouse only contempt for the incapacity of their authors to see the\nsituations out of which the problems grow. To treat the negative\ncharacter of one abstracted element as annulling all the positive\nfeatures with which it coexists, is no way to change any\nactual indeterminist’s way of looking on the matter, tho it may make\nthe gallery applaud.",
        "Turn now to some criticisms of the ’will to believe,’ as another\nexample of the vicious way in which abstraction is currently\nemployed. The right to believe in things for the truth of which\ncomplete objective proof is yet lacking is defended by those who\napprehend certain human situations in their concreteness. In those\nsituations the mind has alternatives before it so vast that the full\nevidence for either branch is missing, and yet so significant\nthat simply to wait for proof, and to doubt while waiting, might\noften in practical respects be the same thing as weighing down the\nnegative side. Is life worth while at all? Is there any general\nmeaning in all this cosmic weather? Is anything being permanently\nbought by all this suffering? Is there perhaps a\ntransmundane experience in Being, something corresponding to a\n’fourth dimension,’ which, if we had access to it, might patch up\nsome of this world’s zerrissenheit and make things look more\nrational than they at first appear? Is there a superhuman\nconsciousness of which our minds are parts, and from which\ninspiration and help may come? Such are the questions in which the\nright to take sides practically for yes or no is affirmed by some of\nus, while others hold that this is methodologically inadmissible,\nand summon us to die professing ignorance and proclaiming the duty\nof every one to refuse to believe.",
        "I say nothing of the personal inconsistency of some of these\ncritics, whose printed works furnish exquisite illustrations of the\nwill to believe, in spite of their denunciations of it as a phrase\nand as a recommended thing. Mr. McTaggart, whom I will once more\ntake as an example, is sure that ’reality is rational and righteous’\nand ’destined sub specie temporis to become perfectly good’; and his\ncalling this belief a result of necessary logic has surely never\ndeceived any reader as to its real genesis in the gifted author’s\nmind. Mankind is made on too uniform a pattern for any of us to\nescape successfully from acts of faith. We have a lively vision of\nwhat a certain view of the universe would mean for us. We kindle\nor we shudder at the thought, and our feeling runs through our whole\nlogical nature and animates its workings. It CAN’T be that, we feel;\nit MUST be this. It must be what it OUGHT to be, and OUGHT to be\nthis; and then we seek for every reason, good or bad, to make this\nwhich so deeply ought to be, seem objectively the probable thing. We\nshow the arguments against it to be insufficient, so that it MAY be\ntrue; we represent its appeal to be to our whole nature’s loyalty\nand not to any emaciated faculty of syllogistic proof. We reinforce\nit by remembering the enlargement of our world by music, by thinking\nof the promises of sunsets and the impulses from vernal woods. And\nthe essence of the whole experience, when the individual swept\nthrough it says finally ’I believe,’ is the intense concreteness of\nhis vision, the individuality of the hypothesis before him, and\nthe complexity of the various concrete motives and perceptions that\nissue in his final state.",
        "But see now how the abstractionist treats this rich and intricate\nvision that a certain state of things must be true. He accuses\nthe believer of reasoning by the following syllogism:–",
        "All good desires must be fulfilled; The desire to believe this\nproposition is a good desire;",
        "Ergo, this proposition must be believed.",
        "He substitutes this abstraction for the concrete state of mind of\nthe believer, pins the naked absurdity of it upon him, and\neasily proves that any one who defends him must be the greatest fool\non earth. As if any real believer ever thought in this preposterous\nway, or as if any defender of the legitimacy of men’s concrete ways\nof concluding ever used the abstract and general premise, ’All\ndesires must be fulfilled’! Nevertheless, Mr. McTaggart solemnly and\nlaboriously refutes the syllogism in sections 47 to 57 of the above-\ncited book. He shows that there is no fixed link in the dictionary\nbetween the abstract concepts ’desire,’ ’goodness’ and ’reality’;\nand he ignores all the links which in the single concrete case the\nbeliever feels and perceives to be there! He adds:–",
        "’When the reality of a thing is uncertain, the argument encourages\nus to suppose that our approval of a thing can determine its\nreality. And when this unhallowed link has once been established,\nretribution overtakes us. For when the reality of the thing is\nindependently certain, we [then] have to admit that the reality of\nthe thing should determine our approval of that thing. I find it\ndifficult to imagine a more degraded position.’",
        "One here feels tempted to quote ironically Hegel’s famous equation\nof the real with the rational to his english disciple, who ends\nhis chapter with the heroic words:–",
        "’For those who do not pray, there remains the resolve that, so far\nas their strength may permit, neither the pains of death nor the\npains of life shall drive them to any comfort in that which they\nhold to be false, or drive them from any comfort [discomfort?] in\nthat which they hold to be true.’",
        "How can so ingenious-minded a writer fail to see how far over the\nheads of the enemy all his arrows pass? When Mr. McTaggart\nhimself believes that the universe is run by the dialectic energy of\nthe absolute idea, his insistent desire to have a world of that sort\nis felt by him to be no chance example of desire in general, but\nan altogether peculiar insight-giving passion to which, in this if\nin no other instance, he would be stupid not to yield. He obeys its\nconcrete singularity, not the bare abstract feature in it of being a\n’desire.’ His situation is as particular as that of an actress who\nresolves that it is best for her to marry and leave the stage, of\na priest who becomes secular, of a politician who abandons public\nlife. What sensible man would seek to refute the concrete decisions\nof such persons by tracing them to abstract premises, such as that\n’all actresses must marry,’ ’all clergymen must be laymen,’\n’all politicians should resign their posts’? Yet this type of\nrefutation, absolutely unavailing though it be for purposes of\nconversion, is spread by Mr. McTaggart through many pages of his\nbook. For the aboundingness of our real reasons he substitutes one\nnarrow point. For men’s real probabilities he gives a skeletonized\nabstraction which no man was ever tempted to believe.",
        "The abstraction in my next example is less simple, but is quite as\nflimsy as a weapon of attack. Empiricists think that truth in\ngeneral is distilled from single men’s beliefs; and the so-called\npragmatists ’go them one better’ by trying to define what it\nconsists in when it comes. It consists, I have elsewhere said,\nin such a working on the part of the beliefs as may bring the man\ninto satisfactory relations with objects to which these latter\npoint. The working is of course a concrete working in the actual\nexperience of human beings, among their ideas, feelings,\nperceptions, beliefs and acts, as well as among the physical things\nof their environment, and the relations must be understood as being\npossible as well as actual. In the chapter on truth of my book\nPragmatism I have taken pains to defend energetically this view.\nStrange indeed have been the misconceptions of it by its enemies,\nand many have these latter been. Among the most formidable-sounding\nonslaughts on the attempt to introduce some concreteness into our\nnotion of what the truth of an idea may mean, is one that has been\nraised in many quarters to the effect that to make truth grow in any\nway out of human opinion is but to reproduce that\nprotagorean doctrine that the individual man is ’the measure of all\nthings,’ which Plato in his immortal dialogue, the Thaeatetus, is\nunanimously said to have laid away so comfortably in its grave\ntwo thousand years ago. The two cleverest brandishers of this\nobjection to make truth concrete, Professors Rickert and\nMunsterberg, write in German, [Footnote: Munsterberg’s book has just\nappeared in an English version: The Eternal Values, Boston,\n1909.] and ’relativismus’ is the name they give to the heresy which\nthey endeavor to uproot.",
        "The first step in their campaign against ’relativismus’ is entirely\nin the air. They accuse relativists–and we pragmatists are typical\nrelativists–of being debarred by their self-adopted principles, not\nonly from the privilege which rationalist philosophers enjoy, of\nbelieving that these principles of their own are truth impersonal\nand absolute, but even of framing the abstract notion of such a\ntruth, in the pragmatic sense, of an ideal opinion in which all men\nmight agree, and which no man should ever wish to change. Both\ncharges fall wide of their mark. I myself, as a pragmatist, believe\nin my own account of truth as firmly as any rationalist can possibly\nbelieve in his. And I believe in it for the very reason that I have\nthe idea of truth which my learned adversaries contend that no\npragmatist can frame. I expect, namely, that the more fully\nmen discuss and test my account, the more they will agree that it\nfits, and the less will they desire a change. I may of course be\npremature in this confidence, and the glory of being truth final and\nabsolute may fall upon some later revision and correction of my\nscheme, which later will then be judged untrue in just the\nmeasure in which it departs from that finally\nsatisfactory formulation. To admit, as we pragmatists do, that we\nare liable to correction (even tho we may not expect it) involves\nthe use on our part of an ideal standard. Rationalists\nthemselves are, as individuals, sometimes sceptical enough to admit\nthe abstract possibility of their own present opinions being\ncorrigible and revisable to some degree, so the fact that the mere\nNOTION of an absolute standard should seem to them so important a\nthing to claim for themselves and to deny to us is not easy\nto explain. If, along with the notion of the standard, they could\nalso claim its exclusive warrant for their own fulminations now, it\nwould be important to them indeed. But absolutists like Rickert\nfreely admit the sterility of the notion, even in their own hands.\nTruth is what we OUGHT to believe, they say, even tho no man ever\ndid or shall believe it, and even tho we have no way of getting at\nit save by the usual empirical processes of testing our opinions by\none another and by facts. Pragmatically, then, this part of the\ndispute is idle. No relativist who ever actually walked the earth\n[Footnote: Of course the bugaboo creature called ’the sceptic’ in\nthe logic-books, who dogmatically makes the statement that\nno statement, not even the one he now makes, is true, is a\nmere mechanical toy–target for the rationalist shooting-gallery–\n hit him and he turns a summersault–yet he is the only sort of\nrelativist whom my colleagues appear able to imagine to exist.] has\ndenied the regulative character in his own thinking of the notion of\nabsolute truth. What is challenged by relativists is the pretence on\nany one’s part to have found for certain at any given moment what\nthe shape of that truth is. Since the better absolutists agree in\nthis, admitting that the proposition ’There is absolute truth’ is\nthe only absolute truth of which we can be sure, [Footnote:\nCompare Bickert’s Gegenstand der Erkentniss, pp. 187, 138.\nMunsterberg’s version of this first truth is that ’Es gibt eine\nWelt,’–see his Philosophie der Werte, pp. 38 and 74 And, after all,\nboth these philosophers confess in the end that the primal truth of\nwhich they consider our supposed denial so irrational is not\nproperly an insight at all, but a dogma adopted by the will which\nany one who turns his back on duty may disregard! But if it all\nreverts to ’the will to believe,’ pragmatists have that privilege as\nwell as their critics.] further debate is practically unimportant,\nso we may pass to their next charge.",
        "It is in this charge that the vicious abstractionism becomes most\napparent. The antipragmatist, in postulating absolute truth,\nrefuses to give any account of what the words may mean. For him they\nform a self-explanatory term. The pragmatist, on the\ncontrary, articulately defines their meaning. Truth absolute, he\nsays, means an ideal set of formulations towards which all opinions\nmay in the long run of experience be expected to converge. In this\ndefinition of absolute truth he not only postulates that there is a\ntendency to such convergence of opinions, to such ultimate\nconsensus, but he postulates the other factors of his definition\nequally, borrowing them by anticipation from the true conclusions\nexpected to be reached. He postulates the existence of opinions, he\npostulates the experience that will sift them, and the consistency\nwhich that experience will show. He justifies himself in these\nassumptions by saying that they are not postulates in the strict\nsense but simple inductions from the past extended to the future by\nanalogy; and he insists that human opinion has already reached a\npretty stable equilibrium regarding them, and that if its\nfuture development fails to alter them, the definition itself, with\nall its terms included, will be part of the very absolute truth\nwhich it defines. The hypothesis will, in short, have worked\nsuccessfully all round the circle and proved self-corroborative, and\nthe circle will be closed.",
        "The anti-pragmatist, however, immediately falls foul of the word\n’opinion’ here, abstracts it from the universe of life, and uses it\nas a bare dictionary-substantive, to deny the rest of the\nassumptions which it coexists withal. The dictionary says that an\nopinion is ’what some one thinks or believes.’ This\ndefinition leaves every one’s opinion free to be autogenous, or\nunrelated either to what any one else may think or to what the truth\nmay be.",
        "Therefore, continue our abstractionists, we must conceive it as\nessentially thus unrelated, so that even were a billion men to sport\nthe same opinion, and only one man to differ, we could admit no\ncollateral circumstances which might presumptively make it more\nprobable that he, not they, should be wrong. Truth, they say,\nfollows not the counting of noses, nor is it only another name for a\nmajority vote. It is a relation that antedates experience,\nbetween our opinions and an independent something which the\npragmatist account ignores, a relation which, tho the opinions of\nindividuals should to all eternity deny it, would still remain to\nqualify them as false. To talk of opinions without referring to this\nindependent something, the anti-pragmatist assures us, is to play\nHamlet with Hamlet’s part left out.",
        "But when the pragmatist speaks of opinions, does he mean any such\ninsulated and unmotived abstractions as are here supposed? Of course\nnot, he means men’s opinions in the flesh, as they have really\nformed themselves, opinions surrounded by their causes and\nthe influences they obey and exert, and along with the whole\nenvironment of social communication of which they are a part and out\nof which they take their rise. Moreover the ’experience’ which the\npragmatic definition postulates is the independent something which\nthe anti-pragmatist accuses him of ignoring. Already have men grown\nunanimous in the opinion that such experience is of an\nindependent reality, the existence of which all opinions\nmust acknowledge, in order to be true. Already do they agree that in\nthe long run it is useless to resist experience’s pressure; that the\nmore of it a man has, the better position he stands in, in respect\nof truth; that some men, having had more experience, are therefore\nbetter authorities than others; that some are also wiser by nature\nand better able to interpret the experience they have had; that it\nis one part of such wisdom to compare notes, discuss, and follow the\nopinion of our betters; and that the more systematically and\nthoroughly such comparison and weighing of opinions is pursued, the\ntruer the opinions that survive are likely to be. When the\npragmatist talks of opinions, it is opinions as they thus concretely\nand livingly and interactingly and correlatively exist that he has\nin mind; and when the anti-pragmatist tries to floor him because the\nword ’opinion’ can also be taken abstractly and as if it had no\nenvironment, he simply ignores the soil out of which the whole\ndiscussion grows. His weapons cut the air and strike no blow. No\none gets wounded in the war against caricatures of belief and\nskeletons of opinion of which the German onslaughts upon\n’relativismus’ consists. Refuse to use the word ’opinion’\nabstractly, keep it in its real environment, and the withers of\npragmatism remain unwrung. That men do exist who are ’opinionated,’\nin the sense that their opinions are self-willed, is unfortunately a\nfact that must be admitted, no matter what one’s notion of truth in\ngeneral may be. But that this fact should make it impossible for\ntruth to form itself authentically out of the life of opinion is\nwhat no critic has yet proved. Truth may well consist of\ncertain opinions, and does indeed consist of nothing but opinions,\ntho not every opinion need be true. No pragmatist needs to dogmatize\nabout the consensus of opinion in the future being right–he need\nonly postulate that it will probably contain more of truth than any\none’s opinion now.",
        "Mr. Bertrand Russell’s article entitled ’Transatlantic Truth,’\n[Footnote: In the Albany Review for January, 1908.] has all the\nclearness, dialectic subtlety, and wit which one expects from his\npen, but it entirely fails to hit the right point of view for\napprehending our position. When, for instance, we say that a\ntrue proposition is one the consequences of believing which are\ngood, he assumes us to mean that any one who believes a proposition\nto be true must first have made out clearly that its consequences be\ngood, and that his belief must primarily be in that fact,–an\nobvious absurdity, for that fact is the deliverance of a\nnew proposition, quite different from the first one and is,\nmoreover, a fact usually very hard to verify, it being ’far easier,’\nas Mr. Russell justly says, ’to settle the plain question of fact:\n\"Have popes always been infallible?\"’ than to settle the question\nwhether the effects of thinking them infallible are on the\nwhole good.’",
        "We affirm nothing as silly as Mr. Russell supposes. Good\nconsequences are not proposed by us merely as a sure sign, mark, or\ncriterion, by which truth’s presence is habitually ascertained, tho\nthey may indeed serve on occasion as such a sign; they are proposed\nrather as the lurking motive inside of every truth-claim, whether\nthe ’trower’ be conscious of such motive, or whether he obey it\nblindly. They are proposed as the causa existendi of our beliefs,\nnot as their logical cue or premise, and still less as their\nobjective deliverance or content. They assign the only intelligible\npractical meaning to that difference in our beliefs which our habit\nof calling them true or false comports.",
        "No truth-claimer except the pragmatist himself need ever be aware of\nthe part played in his own mind by consequences, and he himself is\naware of it only abstractly and in general, and may at any moment be\nquite oblivious of it with respect to his own beliefs.",
        "Mr. Russell next joins the army of those who inform their readers\nthat according to the pragmatist definition of the word ’truth’\nthe belief that A exists may be ’true’ even when A does not exist.\nThis is the usual slander repeated to satiety by our critics. They\nforget that in any concrete account of what is denoted by ’truth’ in\nhuman life, the word can only be used relatively to some\nparticular trower. Thus, I may hold it true that Shakespeare wrote\nthe plays that bear his name, and may express my opinion to a\ncritic. If the critic be both a pragmatist and a baconian, he will\nin his capacity of pragmatist see plain that the workings of my\nopinion, I being who I am, make it perfectly true for me, while\nin his capacity of baconian he still believes that Shakespeare never\nwrote the plays in question. But most anti-pragmatist critics take\nthe wont ’truth’ as something absolute, and easily play on their\nreader’s readiness to treat his OWE truths as the absolute ones. If\nthe reader whom they address believes that A does not exist,\nwhile we pragmatists show that those for whom tho belief that it\nexists works satisfactorily will always call it true, he easily\nsneers at the naivete of our contention, for is not then the belief\nin question ’true,’ tho what it declares as fact has, as the reader\nso well knows, no existence? Mr. Russell speaks of our statement as\nan ’attempt to get rid of fact’ and naturally enough considers it ’a\nfailure’ (p. 410). ’The old notion of truth reappears,’ he adds–\nthat notion being, of course, that when a belief is true, its\nobject does exist.",
        "It is, of course, BOUND to exist, on sound pragmatic principles.\nConcepts signify consequences. How is the world made different for\nme by my conceiving an opinion of mine under the concept ’true’?\nFirst, an object must be findable there (or sure signs of such an\nobject must be found) which shall agree with the opinion. Second,\nsuch an opinion must not be contradicted by anything else I am aware\nof. But in spite of the obvious pragmatist requirement that when I\nhave said truly that something exists, it SHALL exist, the\nslander which Mr. Russell repeats has gained the widest currency.",
        "Mr. Russell himself is far too witty and athletic a ratiocinator\nsimply to repeat the slander dogmatically. Being nothing if\nnot mathematical and logical, he must prove the accusation secundum\nartem, and convict us not so much of error as of absurdity. I\nhave sincerely tried to follow the windings of his mind in this\nprocedure, but for the life of me I can only see in it another\nexample of what I have called (above, p. 249) vicious\nabstractionism. The abstract world of mathematics and pure logic is\nso native to Mr. Russell that he thinks that we describers of the\nfunctions of concrete fact must also mean fixed mathematical terms\nand functions. A mathematical term, as a, b, c, x, y, sin., log., is\nself-sufficient, and terms of this sort, once equated, can\nbe substituted for one another in endless series without error. Mr.\nRussell, and also Mr. Hawtrey, of whom I shall speak presently, seem\nto think that in our mouth also such terms as ’meaning,’ ’truth,’\n’belief,’ ’object,’ ’definition,’ are self-sufficients with no\ncontext of varying relation that might be further asked about. What\na word means is expressed by its definition, isn’t it? The\ndefinition claims to be exact and adequate, doesn’t it? Then it can\nbe substituted for the word–since the two are identical–can’t it?\nThen two words with the same definition can be substituted for one\nanother, n’est–ce pas? Likewise two definitions of the same word,\nnicht wahr, etc., etc., till it will be indeed strange if you can’t\nconvict some one of self-contradiction and absurdity.",
        "The particular application of this rigoristic treatment to my own\nlittle account of truth as working seems to be something like what\nfollows. I say ’working’ is what the ’truth’ of our ideas means, and\ncall it a definition. But since meanings and things meant,\ndefinitions and things defined, are equivalent and\ninterchangeable, and nothing extraneous to its definition can be\nmeant when a term is used, it follows that who so calls an idea\ntrue, and means by that word that it works, cannot mean\nanything else, can believe nothing but that it does work, and in\nparticular can neither imply nor allow anything about its object or\ndeliverance. ’According to the pragmatists,’ Mr. Russell writes, ’to\nsay “it is true that other people exist” means “it is useful to\nbelieve that other people exist.” But if so, then these two\nphrases are merely different words for the same\nproposition; therefore when I believe the one, I believe the other’\n(p. 400). [Logic, I may say in passing, would seem to require Mr.\nRussell to believe them both at once, but he ignores\nthis consequence, and considers that other people exist’ and ’it is\nuseful to believe that they do EVEN IF THEY DON’T,’ must be\nidentical and therefore substitutable propositions in the pragmatist\nmouth.]",
        "But may not real terms, I now ask, have accidents not expressed in\ntheir definitions? and when a real value is finally substituted for\nthe result of an algebraic series of substituted definitions, do not\nall these accidents creep back? Beliefs have their objective\n’content’ or ’deliverance’ as well as their truth, and truth has its\nimplications as well as its workings. If any one believe that other\nmen exist, it is both a content of his belief and an implication of\nits truth, that they should exist in fact. Mr. Russell’s logic would\nseem to exclude, ’by definition,’ all such accidents as contents,\nimplications, and associates, and would represent us as translating\nall belief into a sort of belief in pragmatism itself–of\nall things! If I say that a speech is eloquent, and explain\n’eloquent’ as meaning the power to work in certain ways upon the\naudience; or if I say a book is original, and define ’original’ to\nmean differing from other books, Russell’s logic, if I follow it at\nall, would seem to doom me to agreeing that the speech is about\neloquence, and the book about other books. When I call a belief\ntrue, and define its truth to mean its workings, I certainly do not\nmean that the belief is a belief ABOUT the workings. It is a belief\nabout the object, and I who talk about the workings am a different\nsubject, with a different universe of discourse, from that of the\nbeliever of whose concrete thinking I profess to give an account.",
        "The social proposition ’other men exist’ and the pragmatist\nproposition ’it is expedient to believe that other men exist’ come\nfrom different universes of discourse. One can believe the second\nwithout being logically compelled to believe the first; one can\nbelieve the first without having ever heard of the second; or one\ncan believe them both. The first expresses the object of a belief,\nthe second tells of one condition of the belief’s power to maintain\nitself. There is no identity of any kind, save the term ’other men’\nwhich they contain in common, in the two propositions; and to\ntreat them as mutually substitutable, or to insist that we shall do\nso, is to give up dealing with realities altogether.",
        "Mr. Ralph Hawtrey, who seems also to serve under the banner of\nabstractionist logic, convicts us pragmatists of absurdity by\narguments similar to Mr. Russell’s. [Footnote: See The New\nQuarterly, for March, 1908.]",
        "As a favor to us and for the sake of the argument, he abandons the\nword ’true’ to our fury, allowing it to mean nothing but the\nfact that certain beliefs are expedient; and he uses the word\n’correctness’ (as Mr. Pratt uses the word ’trueness’) to designate a\nfact, not about the belief, but about the belief’s object,\nnamely that it is as the belief declares it. ’When therefore,’ he\nwrites, ’I say it is correct to say that Caesar is dead, I mean\n\"Caesar is dead.” This must be regarded as the definition of\ncorrectness.’ And Mr. Hawtrey then goes on to demolish me by the\nconflict of the definitions. What is ’true’ for the pragmatist\ncannot be what is ’correct,’ he says, ’for the definitions are not\nlogically interchangeable; or if we interchange them, we reach the\ntautology:",
        "“Caesar is dead” means “it is expedient to believe that Caesar is\ndead.” But what is it expedient to believe? Why, “that Caesar is\ndead.” A precious definition indeed of ’Caesar is dead.’",
        "Mr. Hawtrey’s conclusion would seem to be that the pragmatic\ndefinition of the truth of a belief in no way implies–what?–that\nthe believer shall believe in his own belief’s deliverance?–or that\nthe pragmatist who is talking about him shall believe in that\ndeliverance? The two cases are quite different. For the believer,\nCaesar must of course really exist; for the pragmatist critic he\nneed not, for the pragmatic deliverance belongs, as I have just\nsaid, to another universe of discourse altogether. When one argues\nby substituting definition for definition, one needs to stay in the\nsame universe.",
        "The great shifting of universes in this discussion occurs when we\ncarry the word ’truth’ from the subjective into the objective\nrealm, applying it sometimes to a property of opinions, sometimes to\nthe facts which the opinions assert. A number of writers, as Mr.\nRussell himself, Mr. G. E. Moore, and others, favor the unlucky word\n’proposition,’ which seems expressly invented to foster this\nconfusion, for they speak of truth as a property of ’propositions.’\nBut in naming propositions it is almost impossible not to use the\nword ’that.’",
        "THAT Caesar is dead, THAT virtue is its own reward, are\npropositions.",
        "I do not say that for certain logical purposes it may not be useful\nto treat propositions as absolute entities, with truth or falsehood\ninside of them respectively, or to make of a complex like ’that–\nCaesar–is–dead’ a single term and call it a ’truth.’ But the\n’that’ here has the extremely convenient ambiguity for those\nwho wish to make trouble for us pragmatists, that sometimes it means\nthe FACT that, and sometimes the BELIEF that, Caesar is no longer\nliving. When I then call the belief true, I am told that the truth\nmeans the fact; when I claim the fact also, I am told that my\ndefinition has excluded the fact, being a definition only of a\ncertain peculiarity in the belief–so that in the end I have no\ntruth to talk about left in my possession.",
        "The only remedy for this intolerable ambiguity is, it seems to me,\nto stick to terms consistently. ’Reality,’ ’idea’ or ’belief,’ and\nthe ’truth of the idea or belief,’ which are the terms I have\nconsistently held to, seem to be free from all objection.",
        "Whoever takes terms abstracted from all their natural settings,\nidentifies them with definitions, and treats the latter more\nalgebraico, not only risks mixing universes, but risks fallacies\nwhich the man in the street easily detects. To prove ’by definition’\nthat the statement ’Caesar exists’ is identical with a statement\nabout ’expediency’ because the one statement is ’true’ and the other\nis about ’true statements,’ is like proving that an omnibus is\na boat because both are vehicles. A horse may be defined as a beast\nthat walks on the nails of his middle digits. Whenever we see a\nhorse we see such a beast, just as whenever we believe a ’truth’ we\nbelieve something expedient. Messrs. Russell and Hawtrey, if they\nfollowed their antipragmatist logic, would have to say here that we\nsee THAT IT IS such a beast, a fact which notoriously no one sees\nwho is not a comparative anatomist.",
        "It almost reconciles one to being no logician that one thereby\nescapes so much abstractionism. Abstractionism of the worst sort\ndogs Mr. Russell in his own trials to tell positively what the word\n’truth’ means. In the third of his articles on Meinong, in Mind,\nvol. xiii, p. 509 (1904), he attempts this feat by limiting the\ndiscussion to three terms only, a proposition, its content, and an\nobject, abstracting from the whole context of associated\nrealities in which such terms are found in every case of actual\nknowing. He puts the terms, thus taken in a vacuum, and made into\nbare logical entities, through every possible permutation\nand combination, tortures them on the rack until nothing is left of\nthem, and after all this logical gymnastic, comes out with the\nfollowing portentous conclusion as what he believes to be the\ncorrect view: that there is no problem at all in truth and\nfalsehood, that some propositions are true and some false, just as\nsome roses are red and some white, that belief is a certain attitude\ntowards propositions, which is called knowledge when they are true,\nerror when they are false’–and he seems to think that when once\nthis insight is reached the question may be considered closed\nforever!",
        "In spite of my admiration of Mr. Russell’s analytic powers, I wish,\nafter reading such an article, that pragmatism, even had it no\nother function, might result in making him and other similarly\ngifted men ashamed of having used such powers in such abstraction\nfrom reality. Pragmatism saves us at any rate from such diseased\nabstractionism as those pages show.",
        "P. S. Since the foregoing rejoinder was written an article on\nPragmatism which I believe to be by Mr. Russell has appeared in the\nEdinburgh Review for April, 1909. As far as his discussion of the\ntruth-problem goes, altho he has evidently taken great pains to be\nfair, it seems to me that he has in no essential respect improved\nupon his former arguments. I will therefore add nothing further, but\nsimply refer readers who may be curious to pp. 272-280 of the said\narticle.",
        "After correcting the proofs of all that precedes I imagine a\nresidual state of mind on the part of my reader which may still keep\nhim unconvinced, and which it may be my duty to try at least to\ndispel. I can perhaps be briefer if I put what I have to say in\ndialogue form. Let then the anti-pragmatist begin:–",
        "Anti-Pragmatist:–You say that the truth of an idea is constituted\nby its workings. Now suppose a certain state of facts, facts for\nexample of antediluvian planetary history, concerning which the\nquestion may be asked:",
        "’Shall the truth about them ever be known?’ And suppose (leaving the\nhypothesis of an omniscient absolute out of the account) that we\nassume that the truth is never to be known. I ask you now, brother\npragmatist, whether according to you there can be said to be\nany truth at all about such a state of facts. Is there a truth, or\nis there not a truth, in cases where at any rate it never comes\nto be known?",
        "Pragmatist:–Why do you ask me such a question?",
        "Anti-Prag.:–Because I think it puts you in a bad dilemma.",
        "Prag.:–How so?",
        "Anti-Prag.:–Why, because if on the one hand you elect to say that\nthere is a truth, you thereby surrender your whole pragmatist\ntheory. According to that theory, truth requires ideas and workings\nto constitute it; but in the present instance there is supposed to\nbe no knower, and consequently neither ideas nor workings can exist.\nWhat then remains for you to make your truth of?",
        "Prag.:–Do you wish, like so many of my enemies, to force me to make\nthe truth out of the reality itself? I cannot: the truth is\nsomething known, thought or said about the reality, and consequently\nnumerically additional to it. But probably your intent is something\ndifferent; so before I say which horn of your dilemma I choose, I\nask you to let me hear what the other horn may be.",
        "Anti-Prag.:–The other horn is this, that if you elect to say that\nthere is no truth under the conditions assumed, because there are\nno ideas or workings, then you fly in the face of common sense.\nDoesn’t common sense believe that every state of facts must in\nthe nature of things be truly statable in some kind of a\nproposition, even tho in point of fact the proposition should never\nbe propounded by a living soul?",
        "Prag.:–Unquestionably common sense believes this, and so do I.\nThere have been innumerable events in the history of our planet of\nwhich nobody ever has been or ever will be able to give an account,\nyet of which it can already be said abstractly that only one sort of\npossible account can ever be true. The truth about any such event is\nthus already generically predetermined by the event’s nature; and\none may accordingly say with a perfectly good conscience that it\nvirtually pre-exists. Common sense is thus right in its instinctive\ncontention.",
        "Anti-Prag.:–Is this then the horn of the dilemma which you stand\nfor? Do you say that there is a truth even in cases where it\nshall never be known?",
        "Prag.:–Indeed I do, provided you let me hold consistently to my own\nconception of truth, and do not ask me to abandon it for something\nwhich I find impossible to comprehend.–You also believe, do you\nnot, that there is a truth, even in cases where it never shall\nbe known?",
        "Anti-Prag.:–I do indeed believe so.",
        "Prag.:–Pray then inform me in what, according to you, this truth\nregarding the unknown consists.",
        "Anti-Prag.:–Consists?–pray what do you mean by ’consists’? It\nconsists in nothing but itself, or more properly speaking it\nhas neither consistence nor existence, it obtains, it holds.",
        "Prag.:–Well, what relation does it bear to the reality of which it\nholds?",
        "Anti-Prag.:-How do you mean, ’what relation’? It holds of it, of\ncourse; it knows it, it represents it.",
        "Prag.:–Who knows it? What represents it?",
        "Anti-Prag.:–The truth does; the truth knows it; or rather not\nexactly that, but any one knows it who possesses the truth. Any true\nidea of the reality represents the truth concerning it.",
        "Prag.:–But I thought that we had agreed that no knower of it, nor\nany idea representing it was to be supposed.",
        "Anti-Prag.:–Sure enough!",
        "Prag.:–Then I beg you again to tell me in what this truth consists,\nall by itself, this tertium quid intermediate between the facts per\nse, on the one hand, and all knowledge of them, actual or potential,\non the other. What is the shape of it in this third estate? Of\nwhat stuff, mental, physical, or ’epistemological,’ is it built?\nWhat metaphysical region of reality does it inhabit?",
        "Anti-Prag.:–What absurd questions! Isn’t it enough to say that it\nis true that the facts are so-and-so, and false that they are\notherwise?",
        "Prag.:–’It’ is true that the facts are so-and-so–I won’t yield to\nthe temptation of asking you what is true; but I do ask you\nwhether your phrase that ’it is true that’ the facts are so-and-so\nreally means anything really additional to the bare being so-and-so\nof the facts themselves.",
        "Anti-Prag.:–It seems to mean more than the bare being of the facts.\nIt is a sort of mental equivalent for them, their\nepistemological function, their value in noetic terms. Prag.:–A\nsort of spiritual double or ghost of them, apparently! If so, may I\nask you where this truth is found.",
        "Anti-Prag.:–Where? where? There is no ’where’–it simply obtains,\nabsolutely obtains.",
        "Prag.:–Not in any one’s mind?",
        "Anti-Prag.:–No, for we agreed that no actual knower of the truth\nshould be assumed.",
        "Prag.:–No actual knower, I agree. But are you sure that no notion\nof a potential or ideal knower has anything to do with forming this\nstrangely elusive idea of the truth of the facts in your mind?",
        "Anti-Prag.:–Of course if there be a truth concerning the facts,\nthat truth is what the ideal knower would know. To that extent you\ncan’t keep the notion of it and the notion of him separate. But it\nis not him first and then it; it is it first and then him, in my\nopinion.",
        "Prag.:–But you still leave me terribly puzzled as to the status of\nthis so-called truth, hanging as it does between earth and\nheaven, between reality and knowledge, grounded in the reality, yet\nnumerically additional to it, and at the same time antecedent to any\nknower’s opinion and entirely independent thereof. Is it as\nindependent of the knower as you suppose? It looks to me terribly\ndubious, as if it might be only another name for a potential as\ndistinguished from an actual knowledge of the reality. Isn’t your\ntruth, after all, simply what any successful knower would have to\nknow in case he existed? And in a universe where no knowers were\neven conceivable would any truth about the facts there as something\nnumerically distinguishable from the facts themselves, find a place\nto exist in? To me such truth would not only be non-existent, it\nwould be unimaginable, inconceivable.",
        "Anti-Prag.:–But I thought you said a while ago that there is a\ntruth of past events, even tho no one shall ever know it.",
        "Prag.:–Yes, but you must remember that I also stipulated for\npermission to define the word in my own fashion. The truth of\nan event, past, present, or future, is for me only another name for\nthe fact that if the event ever does get known, the nature of the\nknowledge is already to some degree predetermined. The truth which\nprecedes actual knowledge of a fact means only what any possible\nknower of the fact will eventually find himself necessitated to\nbelieve about it. He must believe something that will bring him into\nsatisfactory relations with it, that will prove a decent\nmental substitute for it. What this something may be is of course\npartly fixed already by the nature of the fact and by the sphere of\nits associations. This seems to me all that you can clearly mean\nwhen you say that truth pre-exists to knowledge. It is knowledge\nanticipated, knowledge in the form of possibility merely.",
        "Anti-Prag.:–But what does the knowledge know when it comes? Doesn’t\nit know the truth? And, if so, mustn’t the truth be distinct from\neither the fact or the knowledge?",
        "Prag.:–It seems to me that what the knowledge knows is the fact\nitself, the event, or whatever the reality may be. Where you\nsee three distinct entities in the field, the reality, the knowing,\nand the truth, I see only two. Moreover, I can see what each of my\ntwo entities is known-as, but when I ask myself what your third\nentity, the truth, is known-as, I can find nothing distinct from the\nreality on the one hand, and the ways in which it may be known on\nthe other. Are you not probably misled by common language, which has\nfound it convenient to introduce a hybrid name, meaning sometimes a\nkind of knowing and sometimes a reality known, to apply to either of\nthese things interchangeably? And has philosophy anything to gain by\nperpetuating and consecrating the ambiguity? If you call the object\nof knowledge ’reality,’ and call the manner of its being cognized\n’truth,’ cognized moreover on particular occasions, and\nvariously, by particular human beings who have their various\nbusinesses with it, and if you hold consistently to this\nnomenclature, it seems to me that you escape all sorts of trouble.",
        "Anti-Prag.:–Do you mean that you think you escape from my dilemma?",
        "Prag.:–Assuredly I escape; for if truth and knowledge are terms\ncorrelative and interdependent, as I maintain they are,\nthen wherever knowledge is conceivable truth is\nconceivable, wherever knowledge is possible truth is possible,\nwherever knowledge is actual truth is actual. Therefore when you\npoint your first horn at me, I think of truth actual, and say it\ndoesn’t exist. It doesn’t; for by hypothesis there is no knower, no\nideas, no workings. I agree, however, that truth possible or virtual\nmight exist, for a knower might possibly be brought to birth; and\ntruth conceivable certainly exists, for, abstractly taken, there\nis nothing in the nature of antediluvian events that should make the\napplication of knowledge to them inconceivable. Therefore when\nyou try to impale me on your second horn, I think of the truth in\nquestion as a mere abstract possibility, so I say it does exist, and\nside with common sense.",
        "Do not these distinctions rightly relieve me from embarrassment? And\ndon’t you think it might help you to make them yourself?",
        "Anti-Prag.:–Never!–so avaunt with your abominable hair-splitting\nand sophistry! Truth is truth; and never will I degrade it by\nidentifying it with low pragmatic particulars in the way you\npropose.",
        "Prag.:–Well, my dear antagonist, I hardly hoped to convert an\neminent intellectualist and logician like you; so enjoy, as long as\nyou live, your own ineffable conception. Perhaps the rising\ngeneration will grow up more accustomed than you are to that\nconcrete and empirical interpretation of terms in which the\npragmatic method consists. Perhaps they may then wonder how so\nharmless and natural an account of truth as mine could have found\nsuch difficulty in entering the minds of men far more intelligent\nthan I can ever hope to become, but wedded by education and\ntradition to the abstractionist manner of thought.",
