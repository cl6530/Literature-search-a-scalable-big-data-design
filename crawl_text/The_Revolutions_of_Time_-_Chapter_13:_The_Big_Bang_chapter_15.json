        "The Munams and I were all awoken at the same time late the next morning\nby a loud trumpet blast that shook the very air around us with its\nintense bass. For the first moment of our consciousness we were all\ndazed and could not fully comprehend the situation, and for a brief time\nwe all sat unsteadily around the beach where we had fallen asleep. As we\ngrew more awake, we began to understand what had happened, or at least I\ndid, and I was frightened when I looked around and saw where the trumpet\nblast had come from: the entire Zardovian and Canitaurian armies were\nassembled around us, having somehow crossed over to the mainland in the\nnight, while we slept peacefully, unaware of their presence.",
        "My first thought was for myself, and what would become of me in the\nwrath brought on by my escape, but that soon vanished when I thought of\nthe Munams, for they were the enemies of those on Daem, even more so\nthan those on Daem were to each other. We were completely surrounded,\nwith the ocean on one side and the Zards and Canitaurs circling us in\nthe front, the former on the left and the latter on the right. All of\nthem were equipped for war, with swords, spears, and shields held firmly\nin their hands, and thick, leather armor stretched across their chests.\nThe Canitaurs had especially come prepared, for they had brought all of\ntheir atomic anionizers with them, enough combined fire power to level\nthe entire world several times over.",
        "Within five minutes, all of the Munams had assembled behind me and\nRamma, who stood between them and the Daemians. They huddled closely\ntogether and quaked slightly in fear, for they evidently thought that\ntheir plans had been discovered and their enemies had come for revenge.\nI, myself, thought that they had come for me, and Ramma’s opinion could\nnot be guessed, for he was a statesman first and foremost, and when his\npeople were in need he rose to the occasion with all the power and grace\nallotted to mortal beings.",
        "Wagner and Bernibus broke the Canitaur’s ranks and drew near to us in\nthe center, as did the King from the Zard’s. They reached us in silence,\nand for a long moment there was no talking, for all present knew that\nsomething grave was about to happen, something that would decide the\nfate of the men of this age, whether they would pass or fail the test.\nBernibus looked at me with entreating eyes, showing his sorrow at my\nrecapture and asking for forgiveness, but I had none to give him, for he\nhad done no wrong to need it. He had no power among the Canitaurs, but\nwas only a titled commoner, more like Wagner’s groom than counsel.",
        "I noticed that the Canitaurs were not wearing their anti-electron suits,\nwhich was strange, for they had brought a few hundred atomic anionizers,\nthough I didn’t question them about it, for the answer was evident\nenough when I had given it some thought: the Zards had no such suits,\nand were afraid that the Canitaurs would destroy them and Munams at the\nsame time, for while they were allies against foreigners, they still did\nnot trust each other. I still wore my suit given me for the raid on\nNunami, though I had forgotten about it due to its comfort. That made me\nthe only person on the earth still wearing one, the only one safe from\nthe anionizers.",
        "It was an overcast morning, and the air was damp with a cold, wet wind\nthat blew in forlornly. The ocean’s steady swoosh added to the scene,\nmaking it as depressing as the night before was joyous, and in the\nbluish half light all was colorless and hopeless. At length the King\nspoke, saying, “My dear Jehu, I am very disappointed in you. Not only\ndid you flee from us irresponsibly, but you destroyed the Temple of Time\nand the altar to Temis. Without the White Eagle, the prophecy says that\nthere is no hope for humanity.”",
        "Wagner added, “And now the only way left to bring about the completion\nof the world once more is to sacrifice you using the old methods.” This\nhe said with evident pleasure, no longer feigning to be my friend.",
        "Here Bernibus entered the dialog, throwing away his timidness with one\nquick motion and saying to Wagner, “You scoundrel! You said that we came\nto retrieve Jehu, not to sacrifice him. How is it that you lied to me in\nsuch a manner?”",
        "“You fool,” Wagner said, “If I had had my way, you would have been dead\nlong ago. You have no authority here, so begone.”",
        "Bernibus grew angrier, a terrifying state for a Canitaur to be in, and\nhe was a strong and powerful one at that, though his meek nature had\nhidden it before. “You would never dare to kill me in the open, you\ncoward, the council would banish you,” he said.",
        "Here the King joined in once more, laughing, “He wouldn’t, no, but I\nwould. Do you really think that we found your outpost on our own, oh\nBernibus the ’deputy kibitzer’? You know that we have no tracking\nability, and least of all in your own territory.”",
        "Bernibus grew more enraged, and the King was spurred on by it.",
        "“Oh yes, you know what I speak of. Your brother-in-law told us where you\nand your wife were living, and not only that, for he also told us when\nyou would be there.”",
        "Bernibus became even more flushed with anger and vehemently asked\nWagner, “Why, you heartless brute? What could you possibly value more\nthan your own sister’s life?”",
        "“It was a pledge to the Zards of our intention to abide by the\nagreement, what more precious thing could I give then my own sister?” He\nspoke calmly and spitefully, enjoying the end of his long charade of\nnicety, “Besides, the council was falling for her peace talk, as they\nalways give great heed to every member of the royal family, and I was\nnot strong enough at that time to control them, as I do now.\nUnfortunately for me you were out at the moment of the attack and able\nto escape, but still it was a favorable outcome,” Wagner said, sneering\nat Bernibus’ outrage.",
        "But Bernibus was not to be taken lightly, and neither was he to let the\nlove of his life go undefended. He leapt at Wagner and grabbed the\nremote to the atomic anionizers from his belt, where it was always\nclipped. Wagner tried to get it back, but Bernibus was too strong and\nhurled him to the ground. Then he took a few steps backwards and stood\nhis ground far enough from everyone to have at least a moment to react\nbefore they could reach him. He held the remote out towards Wagner,\npointing it at him as if it were itself a weapon, with his thumb and\nforefinger in position to set it off at a moment’s notice.",
        "“Bow before me now, Wagner, or I shall destroy us all,” he demanded with\na grim smile that showed his resolution.",
        "Wagner did as he commanded and fell to his knees in front of Bernibus,\nsaying in the same gentle, appeasing voice that he had first used on me,\n“My dear Bernibus, do not be rash, do not act in anger. Let’s talk this\nover, and see ... and see if we can’t find a peaceful solution,” his\nfear of death evidently caused him to stammer.",
        "“You fool, do you think that I haven’t heard that voice a thousand times\nbefore? Do you think that I will fall for your same trick once more?”",
        "Wagner put his face to the ground and groveled like the filthy swine\nthat he was, for he knew full well that if Bernibus set off the atomic\nanionizers he would die. His life was completely out of his hands and\nthere was nothing that he could do to reclaim it, except to beg for\nforgiveness. This he did, saying, “Bernibus, you do not understand, the\nsituation was more complex than you realize, and I had no choice but to\nact as I did. Do you not think that it was as hard on me as yourself?\nShe was my sister, my only sibling. But there was no other way, I had to\nput the advancement of our people over the life of anyone, even my own\nsister, as you must do now, putting the advancement of our people over\npetty differences.”",
        "Here the King interjected, “Bernibus, do not act rashly, I beg of you,\nfor if you set off the anionizers, than all is lost. Do you not realize\nthat if you do that, all that we have worked for all of our lives is\nlost?”",
        "It was Bernibus’ turn to sneer, and he did, raising the skin above his\nteeth and scowling fiercely at the King. “What is it that we have worked\nfor all of our lives? Do you still not understand? You and Wagner plot\nto return the world to its former glory, each by his own way, but take a\nlook around you. The trees on Daem are taller and stronger than any\nknown before, the grasses are thicker and livelier, the waters are purer\nand cleaner, the wind is fresher. You know no suffering. The prophecy\nhad nothing to do with you, and nothing at all to do with the\nrestoration of the world! Can you not see that what you have is far more\nthan you have need of, that there is no desire left unfilled in your\nlives, except that of ultimate power? This world does not need to be\nrestored. Only your hearts have need of that.",
        "“The prophecy was given for the Munams, who were left stranded here in\nthis desert wasteland, while across the ocean they could see the great\nparadise of Daem, the great paradise that you took for granted. There is\nto be no restoration of Daem to its original form, but a restoration of\nthe Munams to Daem. You struggle to restore Daem, but have no compassion\nfor the suffering of humanity across the sea. You are the fools, not me,\nand you are the ones who have brought us all to the very brink of\ndestruction, to the ice ages which you have tried so hard to prevent. Do\nyou not see that Daem is already the paradise, that the only thing that\nit needs for completion is the residence of the Munams? Jehu is not our\nkinsman redeemer at all, he is theirs.” Here Bernibus seemed to lose his\nanger and passion and become meek once more, saying humbly, “You have\ndestroyed the life of one whom I held more dear than myself, but that is\npast, and I will not destroy us all for vengeance.",
        "“Zards, Canitaurs, and Munams, hear me now and listen to my words,” he\ncontinued, speaking to the amassed groups of the armies that had been\nlistening closely to his words, “We are not separate people at all, we\nare not different races. We are not Zards, or Canitaurs, or Munams, we\nare Daemians, and it is time that we came together, to help each other\ninstead of hindering. Look at how much blood has been shed, how many\nlives have been lost, must we all be drowned in the blood of our\nbrothers before we realize that we are one people? Must we suffer more\nthan we already have in an attempt to undo what has already been done?\nMore pain will not negate the pain that has already been felt, it will\nonly result in more suffering than we have known up to this time. My\nfriends, we need not look for our redemption in the past, for it has\ngone and though it influences us, we are not bound to its suffering. And\nwe need not look for our redemption in the future, for it is not yet\nhere, and when it comes it will only be what we make it. Instead let us\nlook for our redemption in the present, where it can be found, let us\nput aside our hate and our divisions and become one flesh and blood, one\nbody. People of Daem, let us live in peace!” As he said this, the Zards\nand the Canitaurs and the Munams all let out a joyous shout of\nagreement, and there was seen on every face a remnant of the happiness\nthat had so long alluded them in their wars.",
        "To emphasize his point of harmony and trust, Bernibus dropped the remote\nto the atomic anionizers to the ground. But it would never land. Wagner\nleapt forward from his groveling position and grabbed for it as it fell,\nreaching out with all his strength. There was a sudden silence that\novertook everyone as they saw what was happening. Bernibus looked down\nand saw Wagner leap, but he was too late to prevent him from reaching\nthe remote. There was no noise at all, for everyone looked in horror at\nWagner’s plunging form. As if in slow motion, his hand wrapped around\nthe remote and he squeezed it so as not to let it go. But as he did so,\nthere was a loud beeping sound that came from his fist: he had triggered\nthe anionizers.",
        "The eager faces of everyone there, of everyone alive on the earth, was\nturned towards Wagner. The remote had a five second delay built into it,\nand those five seconds were the longest of my life. Bernibus’ eyes met\nmine, and we experienced an intra-personal deja vu, the converging of\nthe presents of two minds. His face showed the depths of his being in\nthat split second, and he was peaceful. Though he was about to be\ndestroyed, he had no fear, no regrets, and in those five seconds, while\nWagner and the King were frightened and frantic at their impending doom,\nBernibus was as calm as ever. As I looked Bernibus in the eyes, I could\nhear Wagner break the dead silence with a shrill scream that echoed\nacross the horizon and ripped through the hearts of every hearer. When\nfaced with death he had no courage, no strength to face the unknown\nbeyond the veil that separates life from death.",
        "As I turned and cast my eyes across the horizon, I saw the faces of\nhundreds of men, whether Zard, Canitaur, or Munam, and written on\neveryone of them was a great despair, for they stood unprotected in the\npresence of death. It was like the calm before the storm, those five\nseconds, and through them time seemed to stop, to be non-existent, and\nthere was not a sound to be heard, except for Wagner’s scream. Oh, what\nanguish was written on the faces of all around, standing defenselessly\nbefore the end with neither will nor way to stop its terrible approach,\noh, what fear filled their eyes as their mortality was made manifest\nbefore them like a vulture’s approach, oh, the pain, as fate stood\nbefore their distraught faces and silently whispered, “And to dust shalt\nthou return.”",
        "But then even that was silenced. There was no noise. As I looked upon\nthem they were destroyed, before my very eyes they breathed their last\nand were no more. One moment they were normal and healthy, and the next\nthey disintegrated, falling into little heaps of limp skin and bones. In\nthat moment I felt a horror such as I have never felt before, a complete\nloneliness, like a night that never ends. There was no one, nothing,\naround me. The force of the blast had leveled the already flat terrain\ncompletely. The ocean was suddenly solidified into the same lifeless,\ninorganic mass that the land had become. Across the channel, Daem was no\nmore. There were no more trees, no more grasses, no more cities, no more\nmountains, everything was leveled, decimated. The sky began to turn a\ndark, bloody red, and the sun was hidden behind it. Like a disease it\nspread across the horizon, devouring the light hearted blue and leaving\nonly red: lifeless, deathless red. There was no wind, no sound. I was\nall alone, I alone had survived the blast because of my anti-electron\nsuit. I gazed in absolute horror across the field where only seconds\nbefore thousands souls had been congregated. I looked at its emptiness\nand I saw nothing, for there was nothing. They were all dead. Every\nsingle one of them.",
