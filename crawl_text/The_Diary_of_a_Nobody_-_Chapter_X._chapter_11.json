        "Reflections.  I make another Good Joke.  Am annoyed at the constant\nserving-up of the “Blanc-Mange.”  Lupin expresses his opinion of\nWeddings.  Lupin falls out with Daisy Mutlar.",
        "\nNovember 16. - Woke about twenty times during the night, with\nterrible thirst.  Finished off all the water in the bottle, as well\nas half that in the jug.  Kept dreaming also, that last night’s\nparty was a failure, and that a lot of low people came without\ninvitation, and kept chaffing and throwing things at Mr. Perkupp,\ntill at last I was obliged to hide him in the box-room (which we\nhad just discovered), with a bath-towel over him.  It seems absurd\nnow, but it was painfully real in the dream.  I had the same dream\nabout a dozen times.",
        "Carrie annoyed me by saying:  “You know champagne never agrees with\nyou.”  I told her I had only a couple of glasses of it, having kept\nmyself entirely to port.  I added that good champagne hurt nobody,\nand Lupin told me he had only got it from a traveller as a favour,\nas that particular brand had been entirely bought up by a West-End\nclub.",
        "I think I ate too heartily of the “side dishes,” as the waiter\ncalled them.  I said to Carrie:  “I wish I had put those ’side\ndishes’ ASIDE.”  I repeated this, but Carrie was busy, packing up\nthe teaspoons we had borrowed of Mrs. Cummings for the party.  It\nwas just half-past eleven, and I was starting for the office, when\nLupin appeared, with a yellow complexion, and said:  “Hulloh! Guv.,\nwhat priced head have you this morning?”  I told him he might just\nas well speak to me in Dutch.  He added:  “When I woke this\nmorning, my head was as big as Baldwin’s balloon.”  On the spur of\nthe moment I said the cleverest thing I think I have ever said;\nviz.:  “Perhaps that accounts for the paraSHOOTING pains.”  We\nroared.",
        "November 17. - Still feel tired and headachy!  In the evening\nGowing called, and was full of praise about our party last\nWednesday.  He said everything was done beautifully, and he enjoyed\nhimself enormously.  Gowing can be a very nice fellow when he\nlikes, but you never know how long it will last.  For instance, he\nstopped to supper, and seeing some BLANC-MANGE on the table,\nshouted out, while the servant was in the room:  “Hulloh!  The\nremains of Wednesday?”",
        "November 18. - Woke up quite fresh after a good night’s rest, and\nfeel quite myself again.  I am satisfied a life of going-out and\nSociety is not a life for me; we therefore declined the invitation\nwhich we received this morning to Miss Bird’s wedding.  We only met\nher twice at Mrs. James’, and it means a present.  Lupin said:  “I\nam with you for once.  To my mind a wedding’s a very poor play.\nThere are only two parts in it - the bride and bridegroom.  The\nbest man is only a walking gentleman.  With the exception of a\ncrying father and a snivelling mother, the rest are SUPERS who have\nto dress well and have to PAY for their insignificant parts in the\nshape of costly presents.”  I did not care for the theatrical\nslang, but thought it clever, though disrespectful.",
        "I told Sarah not to bring up the BLANC-MANGE again for breakfast.\nIt seems to have been placed on our table at every meal since\nWednesday.  Cummings came round in the evening, and congratulated\nus on the success of our party.  He said it was the best party he\nhad been to for many a year; but he wished we had let him know it\nwas full dress, as he would have turned up in his swallow-tails.\nWe sat down to a quiet game of dominoes, and were interrupted by\nthe noisy entrance of Lupin and Frank Mutlar.  Cummings and I asked\nthem to join us.  Lupin said he did not care for dominoes, and\nsuggested a game of “Spoof.”  On my asking if it required counters,\nFrank and Lupin in measured time said:  “One, two, three; go!  Have\nyou an estate in Greenland?”  It was simply Greek to me, but it\nappears it is one of the customs of the “Holloway Comedians” to do\nthis when a member displays ignorance.",
        "In spite of my instructions, that BLANC-MANGE was brought up again\nfor supper.  To make matters worse, there had been an attempt to\ndisguise it, by placing it in a glass dish with jam round it.\nCarrie asked Lupin if he would have some, and he replied:  “No\nsecond-hand goods for me, thank you.”  I told Carrie, when we were\nalone, if that BLANC-MANGE were placed on the table again I should\nwalk out of the house.",
        "November 19, Sunday. - A delightfully quiet day.  In the afternoon\nLupin was off to spend the rest of the day with the Mutlars.  He\ndeparted in the best of spirits, and Carrie said:  “Well, one\nadvantage of Lupin’s engagement with Daisy is that the boy seems\nhappy all day long.  That quite reconciles me to what I must\nconfess seems an imprudent engagement.”",
        "Carrie and I talked the matter over during the evening, and agreed\nthat it did not always follow that an early engagement meant an\nunhappy marriage.  Dear Carrie reminded me that we married early,\nand, with the exception of a few trivial misunderstandings, we had\nnever had a really serious word.  I could not help thinking (as I\ntold her) that half the pleasures of life were derived from the\nlittle struggles and small privations that one had to endure at the\nbeginning of one’s married life.  Such struggles were generally\noccasioned by want of means, and often helped to make loving\ncouples stand together all the firmer.",
        "Carrie said I had expressed myself wonderfully well, and that I was\nquite a philosopher.",
        "We are all vain at times, and I must confess I felt flattered by\nCarrie’s little compliment.  I don’t pretend to be able to express\nmyself in fine language, but I feel I have the power of expressing\nmy thoughts with simplicity and lucidness.  About nine o’clock, to\nour surprise.  Lupin entered, with a wild, reckless look, and in a\nhollow voice, which I must say seemed rather theatrical, said:\n“Have you any brandy?”  I said:  “No; but here is some whisky.\"\nLupin drank off nearly a wineglassful without water, to my horror.",
        "We all three sat reading in silence till ten, when Carrie and I\nrose to go to bed.  Carrie said to Lupin:  “I hope Daisy is well?”",
        "Lupin, with a forced careless air that he must have picked up from\nthe “Holloway Comedians,” replied:  “Oh, Daisy?  You mean Miss\nMutlar.  I don’t know whether she is well or not, but please NEVER\nTO MENTION HER NAME AGAIN IN MY PRESENCE.”",
