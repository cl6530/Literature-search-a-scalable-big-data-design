        "People and Prospects of the Philippines",
        "Blackwood’s magazine for August, 1818, has an account of conditions\nin Manila and the Philippines from data given by an English merchant\nwho left the Islands in 1798 after twenty years’ residence in which\nhe accumulated a fortune.",
        "“Your first question, with respect to the Spanish population, must\nrefer to native Spaniards only; as their numerous descendants, through\nall the variety of half-castes, would include one third at least of\nthe whole population of Luconia (i.e., Luzon–A. C.)",
        "“Of native Spaniards, accordingly, settled in the Philippine Islands,\nthe total number may be stated at 2,000 not military. The military,\nincluding all descriptions, men and officers, are about 2,500,\nout of which number the native regiments are officered These last,\nin 1796-7, were almost entirely composed of South Americans and were\nreckoned at 5,000 men, making a military force of about 7,500.",
        "“The castes bearing a mixture of the Spanish blood are in Luconia\nalone at least 200,000. The Sangleys, or Chinese descendants, are\nupwards of 20,000, and Indians, who call themselves the original\nTagalas, about 340,000, making a total population in that island of\nabout 600,000 souls. What may be the respective numbers in the other\nPhilippine Islands I never had any opportunity of learning.”",
        "(This opinion, of a day when it was not desired to disparage the\npeople, gives an idea of the mixed blood of the Filipinos which, in the\nopinion of the ethnologists, like Ratzel, is a source of strength. It\nclasses them with the English and Americans. One danger of the present\nappears in over-emphasizing the Malay blood, just as in Spanish times\na real loss seems to have come from the contempt toward the Chinese\nwhich led to minimizing and concealing a most creditable ancestry.",
        "Prejudice in the past called all trouble makers mestizos, but today’s\nstudy is showing that trouble maker meant man who would stand up for\nhis rights; one must not forget that mestizo was used as a reproach,\nthat the leaders of the people were really typical of the people. By\nthe old injustice those who were mediocre were called natives and\nwhoever rose above his fellows was claimed as a Spaniard, but a\nfairer way would seem to be to consider Filipinos all born in the\nPhilippines.–C.).",
        "The Cornhill magazine in the late ’70s had a contribution by the then\nBritish Consul, Mr. Palgreave, on “Malay Life in the Philippines,\"\nthat makes more understandable the reputation of the islands, which\nbefore the opening of the Suez were a health resort for Japan,\nthe China coast and India. It also shows a fairness to the people\nuncommon in the Spanish-inspired writings of his day.",
        "“Dull indeed must be his soul, unsympathetic his nature who can see\nthe forests and mountains of Luzon, Queen of the Eastern Isles, fade\naway into dim violet outlines on the fast receding horizon without\nsome pang of longing regret. Not the Aegean, not the West Indian,\nnot the Samoan, not any rival in manifold beauties of earth, sea and\nsky the Philippine Archipelago. Pity that for the Philippines no word\nlimner of note exists. The chiefest, the almost exceptional spell of\nthe Philippines, is situated, not in the lake or volcano, forest or\nplain, but in the races that form the bulk of the island population.",
        "“I said ’almost exceptional’ because rarely is an intra-tropical\npeople a satisfactory one to eye or mind. But this cannot be\nsaid of the Philippine Malays who in bodily formation and mental\ncharacteristics alike, may fairly claim a place, not among middling\nones merely, but among almost the higher names inscribed on the world’s\nnational scale. A concentrated, never-absent self-respect, an habitual\nself-restraint in word and deed, very rarely broken except when extreme\nprovocation induces the transitory but fatal frenzy known as ’amok,’\nand an inbred courtesy, equally diffused through all classes, high or\nlow, unfailing decorum, prudence, caution, quiet cheerfulness, ready\nhospitality and a correct, though not inventive taste. His family is\na pleasing sight, much subordination and little constraint, unison in\ngradation, liberty–not license. Orderly children, respected parents,\nwomen subject but not oppressed, men ruling but not despotic, reverence\nwith kindness, obedience in affection, these form lovable pictures,\nnot by any means rare in the villages of the eastern isles.” (Here\nagain comes the necessity of combatting the popular impression that the\nPhilippines is a tropical land peopled by Malays. The modification of\nclimate from being an ocean archipelago suggests that these islands are\nreally subtropical, while mixture of blood joined with three centuries\nof European civilization makes the term Malay misleading.–C.)",
        "PART VII",
        "Filipino Merchants of the Early 1890s",
        "F. Karuth, F. R. G. S., (President of an English corporation interested\nin Philippine mining) about 1894, wrote:",
        "“Few outside the comparatively narrow circle who are directly\ninterested in the commerce and resources of the Philippine Islands\nknow anything about them. The Philippine merchants are a rather\nclose community which only in the last decade or so has expanded its\ndiameter a little. There are a number of very old established firms\namongst them, several of them being British.... Amongst them also\nare firms–perhaps as far as wealth and local influence go, the most\nimportant firms–whose chiefs are partly at least of native blood.",
