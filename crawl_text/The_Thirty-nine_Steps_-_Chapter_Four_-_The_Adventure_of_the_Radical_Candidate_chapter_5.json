        "You may picture me driving that 40 h.p.  car for all she was worth\nover the crisp moor roads on that shining May morning; glancing\nback at first over my shoulder, and looking anxiously to the next\nturning; then driving with a vague eye, just wide enough awake to\nkeep on the highway.  For I was thinking desperately of what I had\nfound in Scudder’s pocket-book.",
        "The little man had told me a pack of lies.  All his yarns about the\nBalkans and the Jew-Anarchists and the Foreign Office Conference\nwere eyewash, and so was Karolides.  And yet not quite, as you\nshall hear.  I had staked everything on my belief in his story, and\nhad been let down; here was his book telling me a different tale,\nand instead of being once-bitten-twice-shy, I believed it absolutely.",
        "Why, I don’t know.  It rang desperately true, and the first yarn, if\nyou understand me, had been in a queer way true also in spirit.  The\nfifteenth day of June was going to be a day of destiny, a bigger\ndestiny than the killing of a Dago.  It was so big that I didn’t blame\nScudder for keeping me out of the game and wanting to play a lone\nhand.  That, I was pretty clear, was his intention.  He had told me\nsomething which sounded big enough, but the real thing was so\nimmortally big that he, the man who had found it out, wanted it all\nfor himself.  I didn’t blame him.  It was risks after all that he was\nchiefly greedy about.",
        "The whole story was in the notes–with gaps, you understand,\nwhich he would have filled up from his memory.  He stuck down\nhis authorities, too, and had an odd trick of giving them all a\nnumerical value and then striking a balance, which stood for the\nreliability of each stage in the yarn.  The four names he had printed\nwere authorities, and there was a man, Ducrosne, who got five out\nof a possible five; and another fellow, Ammersfoort, who got three.\nThe bare bones of the tale were all that was in the book–these,\nand one queer phrase which occurred half a dozen times inside\nbrackets.  ’(Thirty-nine steps)’ was the phrase; and at its last time of\nuse it ran–’(Thirty-nine steps, I counted them–high tide 10.17\np.m.)’.  I could make nothing of that.",
        "The first thing I learned was that it was no question of preventing\na war.  That was coming, as sure as Christmas: had been arranged,\nsaid Scudder, ever since February 1912.  Karolides was going to be\nthe occasion.  He was booked all right, and was to hand in his\nchecks on June 14th, two weeks and four days from that May\nmorning.  I gathered from Scudder’s notes that nothing on earth\ncould prevent that.  His talk of Epirote guards that would skin their\nown grandmothers was all billy-o.",
        "The second thing was that this war was going to come as a\nmighty surprise to Britain.  Karolides’ death would set the Balkans\nby the ears, and then Vienna would chip in with an ultimatum.\nRussia wouldn’t like that, and there would be high words.  But\nBerlin would play the peacemaker, and pour oil on the waters, till\nsuddenly she would find a good cause for a quarrel, pick it up, and\nin five hours let fly at us.  That was the idea, and a pretty good one\ntoo.  Honey and fair speeches, and then a stroke in the dark.  While\nwe were talking about the goodwill and good intentions of Germany\nour coast would be silently ringed with mines, and submarines\nwould be waiting for every battleship.",
        "But all this depended upon the third thing, which was due to\nhappen on June 15th.  I would never have grasped this if I hadn’t\nonce happened to meet a French staff officer, coming back from\nWest Africa, who had told me a lot of things.  One was that, in\nspite of all the nonsense talked in Parliament, there was a real\nworking alliance between France and Britain, and that the two\nGeneral Staffs met every now and then, and made plans for joint\naction in case of war.  Well, in June a very great swell was coming\nover from Paris, and he was going to get nothing less than a\nstatement of the disposition of the British Home Fleet on mobilization.\nAt least I gathered it was something like that; anyhow, it was\nsomething uncommonly important.",
        "But on the 15th day of June there were to be others in London–\nothers, at whom I could only guess.  Scudder was content to call\nthem collectively the ’Black Stone’.  They represented not our Allies,\nbut our deadly foes; and the information, destined for France, was\nto be diverted to their pockets.  And it was to be used, remember–\nused a week or two later, with great guns and swift torpedoes,\nsuddenly in the darkness of a summer night.",
        "This was the story I had been deciphering in a back room of a\ncountry inn, overlooking a cabbage garden.  This was the story that\nhummed in my brain as I swung in the big touring-car from glen to glen.",
        "My first impulse had been to write a letter to the Prime Minister,\nbut a little reflection convinced me that that would be useless.  Who\nwould believe my tale?  I must show a sign, some token in proof,\nand Heaven knew what that could be.  Above all, I must keep going\nmyself, ready to act when things got riper, and that was going to be\nno light job with the police of the British Isles in full cry after me\nand the watchers of the Black Stone running silently and swiftly on\nmy trail.",
        "I had no very clear purpose in my journey, but I steered east by\nthe sun, for I remembered from the map that if I went north I\nwould come into a region of coalpits and industrial towns.  Presently\nI was down from the moorlands and traversing the broad haugh of\na river.  For miles I ran alongside a park wall, and in a break of the\ntrees I saw a great castle.  I swung through little old thatched\nvillages, and over peaceful lowland streams, and past gardens blazing\nwith hawthorn and yellow laburnum.  The land was so deep in\npeace that I could scarcely believe that somewhere behind me were\nthose who sought my life; ay, and that in a month’s time, unless I\nhad the almightiest of luck, these round country faces would be\npinched and staring, and men would be lying dead in English fields.",
        "About mid-day I entered a long straggling village, and had a\nmind to stop and eat.  Half-way down was the Post Office, and on\nthe steps of it stood the postmistress and a policeman hard at work\nconning a telegram.  When they saw me they wakened up, and the\npoliceman advanced with raised hand, and cried on me to stop.",
        "I nearly was fool enough to obey.  Then it flashed upon me that\nthe wire had to do with me; that my friends at the inn had come to an\nunderstanding, and were united in desiring to see more of me, and\nthat it had been easy enough for them to wire the description of me\nand the car to thirty villages through which I might pass.  I released\nthe brakes just in time.  As it was, the policeman made a claw at the\nhood, and only dropped off when he got my left in his eye.",
        "I saw that main roads were no place for me, and turned into the\nbyways.  It wasn’t an easy job without a map, for there was the risk\nof getting on to a farm road and ending in a duck-pond or a stable-\nyard, and I couldn’t afford that kind of delay.  I began to see what\nan ass I had been to steal the car.  The big green brute would be the\nsafest kind of clue to me over the breadth of Scotland.  If I left it\nand took to my feet, it would be discovered in an hour or two and\nI would get no start in the race.",
        "The immediate thing to do was to get to the loneliest roads.\nThese I soon found when I struck up a tributary of the big river,\nand got into a glen with steep hills all about me, and a corkscrew\nroad at the end which climbed over a pass.  Here I met nobody, but\nit was taking me too far north, so I slewed east along a bad track\nand finally struck a big double-line railway.  Away below me I saw\nanother broadish valley, and it occurred to me that if I crossed it I\nmight find some remote inn to pass the night.  The evening was now\ndrawing in, and I was furiously hungry, for I had eaten nothing since\nbreakfast except a couple of buns I had bought from a baker’s cart.\njust then I heard a noise in the sky, and lo and behold there was\nthat infernal aeroplane, flying low, about a dozen miles to the south\nand rapidly coming towards me.",
        "I had the sense to remember that on a bare moor I was at the\naeroplane’s mercy, and that my only chance was to get to the leafy\ncover of the valley.  Down the hill I went like blue lightning,\nscrewing my head round, whenever I dared, to watch that damned\nflying machine.  Soon I was on a road between hedges, and dipping\nto the deep-cut glen of a stream.  Then came a bit of thick wood\nwhere I slackened speed.",
        "Suddenly on my left I heard the hoot of another car, and realized\nto my horror that I was almost up on a couple of gate-posts through\nwhich a private road debouched on the highway.  My horn gave an\nagonized roar, but it was too late.  I clapped on my brakes, but my\nimpetus was too great, and there before me a car was sliding\nathwart my course.  In a second there would have been the deuce of\na wreck.  I did the only thing possible, and ran slap into the hedge\non the right, trusting to find something soft beyond.",
        "But there I was mistaken.  My car slithered through the hedge\nlike butter, and then gave a sickening plunge forward.  I saw what\nwas coming, leapt on the seat and would have jumped out.  But a\nbranch of hawthorn got me in the chest, lifted me up and held me,\nwhile a ton or two of expensive metal slipped below me, bucked\nand pitched, and then dropped with an almighty smash fifty feet to\nthe bed of the stream.",
        "Slowly that thorn let me go.  I subsided first on the hedge, and then\nvery gently on a bower of nettles.  As I scrambled to my feet a hand\ntook me by the arm, and a sympathetic and badly scared voice\nasked me if I were hurt.",
        "I found myself looking at a tall young man in goggles and a\nleather ulster, who kept on blessing his soul and whinnying\napologies.  For myself, once I got my wind back, I was rather glad\nthan otherwise.  This was one way of getting rid of the car.",
        "’My blame, Sir,’ I answered him.  ’It’s lucky that I did not add\nhomicide to my follies.  That’s the end of my Scotch motor tour,\nbut it might have been the end of my life.’",
        "He plucked out a watch and studied it.  ’You’re the right sort of\nfellow,’ he said.  ’I can spare a quarter of an hour, and my house is\ntwo minutes off.  I’ll see you clothed and fed and snug in bed.\nWhere’s your kit, by the way?  Is it in the burn along with the car?’",
        "’It’s in my pocket,’ I said, brandishing a toothbrush.  ’I’m a\nColonial and travel light.’",
        "’A Colonial,’ he cried.  ’By Gad, you’re the very man I’ve been\npraying for.  Are you by any blessed chance a Free Trader?’",
        "’I am,’ said I, without the foggiest notion of what he meant.",
        "He patted my shoulder and hurried me into his car.  Three minutes\nlater we drew up before a comfortable-looking shooting box set\namong pine-trees, and he ushered me indoors.  He took me first to a\nbedroom and flung half a dozen of his suits before me, for my own\nhad been pretty well reduced to rags.  I selected a loose blue serge,\nwhich differed most conspicuously from my former garments, and\nborrowed a linen collar.  Then he haled me to the dining-room,\nwhere the remnants of a meal stood on the table, and announced\nthat I had just five minutes to feed.  ’You can take a snack in your\npocket, and we’ll have supper when we get back.  I’ve got to be at\nthe Masonic Hall at eight o’clock, or my agent will comb my hair.’",
        "I had a cup of coffee and some cold ham, while he yarned away\non the hearth-rug.",
        "’You find me in the deuce of a mess, Mr–by-the-by, you\nhaven’t told me your name.  Twisdon?  Any relation of old Tommy\nTwisdon of the Sixtieth?  No?  Well, you see I’m Liberal Candidate\nfor this part of the world, and I had a meeting on tonight at\nBrattleburn–that’s my chief town, and an infernal Tory stronghold.\nI had got the Colonial ex-Premier fellow, Crumpleton, coming to\nspeak for me tonight, and had the thing tremendously billed and\nthe whole place ground-baited.  This afternoon I had a wire from\nthe ruffian saying he had got influenza at Blackpool, and here am I\nleft to do the whole thing myself.  I had meant to speak for ten\nminutes and must now go on for forty, and, though I’ve been\nracking my brains for three hours to think of something, I simply\ncannot last the course.  Now you’ve got to be a good chap and help\nme.  You’re a Free Trader and can tell our people what a wash-out\nProtection is in the Colonies.  All you fellows have the gift of the\ngab–I wish to Heaven I had it.  I’ll be for evermore in your debt.’",
        "I had very few notions about Free Trade one way or the other,\nbut I saw no other chance to get what I wanted.  My young gentleman\nwas far too absorbed in his own difficulties to think how odd\nit was to ask a stranger who had just missed death by an ace and\nhad lost a 1,000-guinea car to address a meeting for him on the spur\nof the moment.  But my necessities did not allow me to contemplate\noddnesses or to pick and choose my supports.",
        "’All right,’ I said.  ’I’m not much good as a speaker, but I’ll tell\nthem a bit about Australia.’",
        "At my words the cares of the ages slipped from his shoulders,\nand he was rapturous in his thanks.  He lent me a big driving coat–\nand never troubled to ask why I had started on a motor tour\nwithout possessing an ulster–and, as we slipped down the dusty\nroads, poured into my ears the simple facts of his history.  He was\nan orphan, and his uncle had brought him up–I’ve forgotten the\nuncle’s name, but he was in the Cabinet, and you can read his\nspeeches in the papers.  He had gone round the world after leaving\nCambridge, and then, being short of a job, his uncle had advised\npolitics.  I gathered that he had no preference in parties.  ’Good\nchaps in both,’ he said cheerfully, ’and plenty of blighters, too.  I’m\nLiberal, because my family have always been Whigs.’  But if he was\nlukewarm politically he had strong views on other things.  He\nfound out I knew a bit about horses, and jawed away about the\nDerby entries; and he was full of plans for improving his shooting.\nAltogether, a very clean, decent, callow young man.",
        "As we passed through a little town two policemen signalled us to\nstop, and flashed their lanterns on us.",
        "’Beg pardon, Sir Harry,’ said one.  ’We’ve got instructions to\nlook out for a car, and the description’s no unlike yours.’",
        "’Right-o,’ said my host, while I thanked Providence for the\ndevious ways I had been brought to safety.  After that he spoke no\nmore, for his mind began to labour heavily with his coming speech.\nHis lips kept muttering, his eye wandered, and I began to prepare\nmyself for a second catastrophe.  I tried to think of something to say\nmyself, but my mind was dry as a stone.  The next thing I knew we\nhad drawn up outside a door in a street, and were being welcomed\nby some noisy gentlemen with rosettes.\nThe hall had about five hundred in it, women mostly, a lot of\nbald heads, and a dozen or two young men.  The chairman, a\nweaselly minister with a reddish nose, lamented Crumpleton’s absence,\nsoliloquized on his influenza, and gave me a certificate as a\n’trusted leader of Australian thought’.  There were two policemen at\nthe door, and I hoped they took note of that testimonial.  Then Sir\nHarry started.",
        "I never heard anything like it.  He didn’t begin to know how to\ntalk.  He had about a bushel of notes from which he read, and when\nhe let go of them he fell into one prolonged stutter.  Every now and\nthen he remembered a phrase he had learned by heart, straightened\nhis back, and gave it off like Henry Irving, and the next moment he\nwas bent double and crooning over his papers.  It was the most\nappalling rot, too.  He talked about the ’German menace’, and said\nit was all a Tory invention to cheat the poor of their rights and\nkeep back the great flood of social reform, but that ’organized\nlabour’ realized this and laughed the Tories to scorn.  He was all for\nreducing our Navy as a proof of our good faith, and then sending\nGermany an ultimatum telling her to do the same or we would\nknock her into a cocked hat.  He said that, but for the Tories,\nGermany and Britain would be fellow-workers in peace and reform.\nI thought of the little black book in my pocket!  A giddy lot Scudder’s\nfriends cared for peace and reform.",
        "Yet in a queer way I liked the speech.  You could see the niceness\nof the chap shining out behind the muck with which he had been\nspoon-fed.  Also it took a load off my mind.  I mightn’t be much of\nan orator, but I was a thousand per cent better than Sir Harry.",
        "I didn’t get on so badly when it came to my turn.  I simply told\nthem all I could remember about Australia, praying there should be\nno Australian there–all about its labour party and emigration and\nuniversal service.  I doubt if I remembered to mention Free Trade,\nbut I said there were no Tories in Australia, only Labour and\nLiberals.  That fetched a cheer, and I woke them up a bit when I\nstarted in to tell them the kind of glorious business I thought could\nbe made out of the Empire if we really put our backs into it.",
        "Altogether I fancy I was rather a success.  The minister didn’t like\nme, though, and when he proposed a vote of thanks, spoke of Sir\nHarry’s speech as ’statesmanlike’ and mine as having ’the eloquence\nof an emigration agent’.",
        "When we were in the car again my host was in wild spirits at\nhaving got his job over.  ’A ripping speech, Twisdon,’ he said.\n’Now, you’re coming home with me.  I’m all alone, and if you’ll\nstop a day or two I’ll show you some very decent fishing.’",
        "We had a hot supper–and I wanted it pretty badly–and then\ndrank grog in a big cheery smoking-room with a crackling wood\nfire.  I thought the time had come for me to put my cards on the\ntable.  I saw by this man’s eye that he was the kind you can trust.",
        "’Listen, Sir Harry,’ I said.  ’I’ve something pretty important to\nsay to you.  You’re a good fellow, and I’m going to be frank.\nWhere on earth did you get that poisonous rubbish you talked tonight?’",
        "His face fell.  ’Was it as bad as that?’ he asked ruefully.  ’It did\nsound rather thin.  I got most of it out of the PROGRESSIVE MAGAZINE\nand pamphlets that agent chap of mine keeps sending me.  But you\nsurely don’t think Germany would ever go to war with us?’",
        "’Ask that question in six weeks and it won’t need an answer,’ I\nsaid.  ’If you’ll give me your attention for half an hour I am going\nto tell you a story.’",
        "I can see yet that bright room with the deers’ heads and the old\nprints on the walls, Sir Harry standing restlessly on the stone curb\nof the hearth, and myself lying back in an armchair, speaking.  I\nseemed to be another person, standing aside and listening to my\nown voice, and judging carefully the reliability of my tale.  It was\nthe first time I had ever told anyone the exact truth, so far as I\nunderstood it, and it did me no end of good, for it straightened out\nthe thing in my own mind.  I blinked no detail.  He heard all about\nScudder, and the milkman, and the note-book, and my doings in\nGalloway.  Presently he got very excited and walked up and down\nthe hearth-rug.",
        "’So you see,’ I concluded, ’you have got here in your house the\nman that is wanted for the Portland Place murder.  Your duty is to\nsend your car for the police and give me up.  I don’t think I’ll get\nvery far.  There’ll be an accident, and I’ll have a knife in my ribs an\nhour or so after arrest.  Nevertheless, it’s your duty, as a law-abiding\ncitizen.  Perhaps in a month’s time you’ll be sorry, but you have no\ncause to think of that.’",
        "He was looking at me with bright steady eyes.  ’What was your\njob in Rhodesia, Mr Hannay?’ he asked.",
        "’Mining engineer,’ I said.  ’I’ve made my pile cleanly and I’ve had\na good time in the making of it.’",
        "’Not a profession that weakens the nerves, is it?’",
        "I laughed.  ’Oh, as to that, my nerves are good enough.’  I took\ndown a hunting-knife from a stand on the wall, and did the old\nMashona trick of tossing it and catching it in my lips.  That wants a\npretty steady heart.",
        "He watched me with a smile.  ’I don’t want proof.  I may be an ass\non the platform, but I can size up a man.  You’re no murderer and\nyou’re no fool, and I believe you are speaking the truth.  I’m going\nto back you up.  Now, what can I do?’",
        "’First, I want you to write a letter to your uncle.  I’ve got to get\nin touch with the Government people sometime before the 15th of June.’",
        "He pulled his moustache.  ’That won’t help you.  This is Foreign\nOffice business, and my uncle would have nothing to do with it.\nBesides, you’d never convince him.  No, I’ll go one better.  I’ll write\nto the Permanent Secretary at the Foreign Office.  He’s my godfather,\nand one of the best going.  What do you want?’",
        "He sat down at a table and wrote to my dictation.  The gist of it\nwas that if a man called Twisdon (I thought I had better stick to\nthat name) turned up before June 15th he was to entreat him\nkindly.  He said Twisdon would prove his bona fides by passing the\nword ’Black Stone’ and whistling ’Annie Laurie’.",
        "’Good,’ said Sir Harry.  ’That’s the proper style.  By the way,\nyou’ll find my godfather–his name’s Sir Walter Bullivant–down\nat his country cottage for Whitsuntide.  It’s close to Artinswell on\nthe Kenner.  That’s done.  Now, what’s the next thing?’",
        "’You’re about my height.  Lend me the oldest tweed suit you’ve\ngot.  Anything will do, so long as the colour is the opposite of the\nclothes I destroyed this afternoon.  Then show me a map of the\nneighbourhood and explain to me the lie of the land.  Lastly, if\nthe police come seeking me, just show them the car in the glen.  If\nthe other lot turn up, tell them I caught the south express after your\nmeeting.’",
        "He did, or promised to do, all these things.  I shaved off the\nremnants of my moustache, and got inside an ancient suit of what I\nbelieve is called heather mixture.  The map gave me some notion of\nmy whereabouts, and told me the two things I wanted to know–\nwhere the main railway to the south could be joined and what were\nthe wildest districts near at hand.\nAt two o’clock he wakened me from my slumbers in the\nsmoking-room armchair, and led me blinking into the dark starry\nnight.  An old bicycle was found in a tool-shed and handed over to me.",
        "’First turn to the right up by the long fir-wood,’ he enjoined.  ’By\ndaybreak you’ll be well into the hills.  Then I should pitch the\nmachine into a bog and take to the moors on foot.  You can put in a\nweek among the shepherds, and be as safe as if you were in New\nGuinea.’",
        "I pedalled diligently up steep roads of hill gravel till the skies\ngrew pale with morning.  As the mists cleared before the sun, I\nfound myself in a wide green world with glens falling on every side\nand a far-away blue horizon.  Here, at any rate, I could get early\nnews of my enemies.",
