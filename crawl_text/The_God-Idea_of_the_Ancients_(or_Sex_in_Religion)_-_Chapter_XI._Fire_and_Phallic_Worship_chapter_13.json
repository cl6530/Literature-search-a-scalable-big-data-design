        "Although earth, air, water, and the sun were long venerated as\nobjects of worship, as containing the life principle, in process\nof time it is observed that fire attracted the highest regard of\nhuman beings, and on their altars the sacred flame, said to have\nbeen kindled from heaven, was kept burning uninterruptedly from\nyear to year, and from age to age, by bends of priests “whose\nspecial duty it was to see that the sacred flame was never\nextinguished.”  The office of the vestal virgins in Rome was to\npreserve the holy fire.  The Egyptians, and in fact all the\nearlier civilized nations, knew that force proceeds from the sun,\nhence the frequent appearance of this orb among their symbols of\nlife.  Indeed there is not a country on the globe in which, at\nsome time, divine honors have not been paid to fire and to light.",
        "The Hindoos, “believing fire to be the essence of all active\npower in Nature, kept perpetual lamps burning in the innermost\nrecesses of their pagodas and temples, and in the sacred edifices\nof the Greeks and Barbarians fires were preserved for the same\nreason.”",
        "The festival of lamps, which was once universal throughout Egypt,\nstill prevails in China.  On the evening of the fifteenth day of\nthe first month in the year, every person is compelled to place\nbefore his door a lantern or light, such lights differing in size\nand expense according to the degree of wealth or poverty of those\nto whom they belong.  Light was the symbol of Muth (Perceptive\nWisdom).  Among the Persians, the Egyptians, the Mexicans, the\nJews, the Etruscans, the Greeks, and the Romans, fire was\nvenerated as the essence of the Deity; and, at the present time,\nin Thibet, in China, in Japan, and in portions of Africa, it\nstill forms an important part of worship. The Hebrew writings\nshow conclusively that not only the Jews but all the surrounding\nnations were fire-worshippers, and that their sacrifices were not\ninfrequently to the God of Fire.  Of this Forlong says:",
        "“When Rome was rearing temples to the fame and worship of Fire,\nwe find the prophets of Israel occasionally denouncing the\nwickedness of its worship by their own and the nations around\nthem; nevertheless, even to Christ’s time Molok always had his\nofferings of children.\"[100]",

        "It is believed that Abraham introduced fire-worship among the\nJews from Ur in Mesopotamia, a land in which lights are still\nvenerated, and fire altars are worshipped as containing the\nDeity.",
        "The real essence of fire which was identical with the\nlife-principle was holy.  The “Lord” of the Israelites was in the\nfire which descended on Mt. Sinai, Exodus xix., 18.  “The bush\nburned with fire and the bush was not consumed,” Exodus iii., 2. \nWhether the signification of “bush” is the same as “grove,” I\nknow not, but Josephus assures us that the bush was holy before\nthe flame appeared in it.  Because of its sacred character, it\nbecame the receptacle for the burning “Lord” of the Jews.  The\nark, the religious emblem which Moses bore aloft, was simply a\nfire altar on which the fire must continually burn.  The fact\nwill doubtless be observed that although the ark and the bush\n(female emblems) were invested with a certain degree of sanctity,\nthey were nevertheless only receptacles for the substance within\nthem.",
        "At the same time that the Jews kept sacred or holy fires\ncontinually burning on their altars, they carried about a serpent\non a pole representing it to be the “healer of nations.”  They\nalso kept a phallic emblem in a box, chest, or ark which they\nworshipped as the “God of Hosts,” the “Life Giver,” etc.  It has\nbeen observed that although the Jews frequently lost their ark,\nthey were never without their serpent-pole.  At a certain stage\nin the religious development of mankind all the temples in Africa\nand Western Asia were dedicated to Vulcan the fire god or the\n“Lord of Fire,” to whom all furnaces were sacred.  The principal\nfestivals in honor of this Deity took place in the spring, at the\nEaster season, and on the 23d of August, when it is said that the\nlicentiousness practiced in the temples compared with those of\nthe “Harvest Homes” of Europe when the sun was in Libra and the\nharvest had been garnered in.  Vulcan was the “God of\nfornication” or of passion.",
        "These excesses, which remained unchecked down to the fourth\ncentury before Christ, are said to have somewhat abated after the\nrise of the Stoic philosophy.",
        "Various philosophers of early historic times as well as many of\nthe early fathers in the Christian church believed that God was a\ncorporeal substance which in some way is manifested through fire.",
        "In Egypt, during the early ages of Christianity, “a great dispute\ntook place among the monks on the question, whether God is\ncorporeal.”  Tertullian declared that “God is fire\"; Origen, that\n“he is a subtle fire\"; and various others that “he is body.”",
        "There is little doubt that in early historic ages the Persians,\nwho had undertaken to purify their religion, were the strongest\nand purest sect of this cult; they were in fact the genuine\nworshippers of the pure creative principles which they believed\nresided in fire.",
        "We have observed that force or spirit was originally regarded as\na part of Nature, or in other words that it was a manifestation\nof, or an outflowing from matter, but so soon as it began to be\nconsidered as something apart from Nature, there at once arose a\ndesire for some corporeal object to represent this unseen and\noccult principle.",
        "During many of the ages of fire-worship, holy fire, although a\nmaterial substance, seems to have been too subtle to clearly\nrepresent the god-idea, hence everywhere the worship of the\nserpent is found to be interwoven with it.  In fact, so closely\nare serpent, fire, pillar, and other phallic faiths intermingled\nthat it is impossible to separate them.",
        "The Persians are by some writers said to have been the earliest\nfire-worshippers: by others the truth of this statement is\ndenied, while many claim, and indeed the Maji themselves\ndeclared, that they never worshipped fire at all in any other\nmanner than as an emblem of the divine principle which they\nbelieved resided within it.  It is probable, however, from the\nevidence at hand, that they, like all the other nations of the\nglobe, prior to the reformation led by Zarathustra and his\ndaughter, had lost or nearly forgotten the profound ideas\nconnected with the worship of Nature.",
        "Passion, symbolized by fire, is declared by various writers to\nhave been the first idol, but later research has proved the\nfalsity of this assumption.  It is true that at an early age of\nhuman experience the creative processes were worshipped, but such\nworship involved scientific and, I might say, spiritualized\nconceptions of the operations of Nature which in time were\naltogether lost sight of.  Gross phallicism is clearly the result\nof degeneration, and of a lapse into sensuality and superstition.",
        "I think no one can study the facts connected with fire and light\nas the Deity in the various countries in which this worship\nprevailed, without perceiving the change it gradually underwent\nduring later ages, and the grossness of the ideas which became\nconnected with it as compared with an earlier age when mankind\n“had no temples, but worshipped in the open air, on the tops of\nmountains.”",
        "In another portion of this work we have observed that in the\nrites connected with the worship of Cybele (Light or Wisdom),\nalthough phallic symbols were in use, the ceremonies were\nabsolutely pure, and that throughout all the earlier ages her\nworship remained free from the abominations which characterized\nthe worship of later times.",
        "At what time in the history of the human race the organs of\ngeneration first began to appear as emblems of the Deity is not\nknown.  Within the earliest cave temples, those hewn from the\nsolid rock, sculptured representations of these objects are still\nto be observed.  Although until a comparatively recent period\ntheir true significance has been unknown, there is little doubt\nat the present time that they were originally used as symbols of\nfertility, or as emblems typifying the processes of Nature, and\nthat at some remote period of the world’s history they were\nworshipped as the Creator, or, at least, as representations of\nthe creative agencies in the universe.",
        "Concerning the origin and character of the people who executed\nthem there is scarcely a trace in written history.  Through the\nunravelling of extinct tongues, however, the monumental records\nof the ancient nations of the globe have been deciphered, and the\nsystem of religious symbolism in use among them is now\nunderstood.",
        "A small volume by various writers, printed in London some years\nago, entitled A Comparative View of the Ancient Monuments of\nIndia, says:",
        "“Those who have penetrated into the abstruseness of Indian\nmythology, find that in these temples was practiced a worship\nsimilar to that practiced by all the several nations of the\nworld, in their earliest as well as their most enlightened\nperiods.  It was paid to the Phallus by the Asiatics, to Priapus\nby the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, to Baal-Peor by the\nCanaanites and idolatrous Jews.  The figure is seen on the fascia\nwhich runs round the circus of Nismes, and over the portal of the\nCathedral of Toulouse, and several churches of Bordeaux.”",
        "Of the Lingham and Yoni and their universal acceptance as\nreligious emblems, Barlow remarks that it was a “worship which\nwould appear to have made the tour of the globe and to have left\ntraces of its existence where we might least expect to find it.” \nIn referring to the “sculptured indecencies” connected with\nreligious rites, which, being wrought in imperishable stone, have\nbeen preserved in India and other parts of the East, Forlong says\nthat when occurring in the temples or other sacred places they\nare at the present time evidently very puzzling to the pious\nIndians, and in their attempts to explain them they say they are\nplaced there “in fulfilment of vows,” or that they have been\nwrought there “as punishments for sins of a sexual nature,\ncommitted by those who executed or paid for them.”  It is,\nhowever, the opinion of Forlong that they are simply connected\nwith an older and purer worship–a worship which involved the\nunion of the sex principles as the foundation of their god-idea.",
        "Regarding the cause for the “indecent” sculptures of the Orissa\ntemples, the same writer quotes the following from Baboo\nRagendralala Mitra, in his work on the Antiquities of Orissa.",
        "“A vitiated taste aided by general prevalence of immorality might\nat first sight appear to be the most likely one; but I can not\nbelieve that libidiousness, however depraved, would ever think of\nselecting fanes dedicated to the worship of God, as the most\nappropriate for its manifestations; for it is worthy of remark\nthat they occur almost exclusively on temples and their attached\nporches, and never on enclosing walls, gateways, and other\nnon-religious structures.  Our ideas of propriety, according to\nVoltaire, lead us to suppose that a ceremony (like the worship of\nPriapus) which appears to us infamous, could only be invented by\nlicentiousness; but it is impossible to believe that depravity of\nmanners would ever have led among any people to the establishment\nof religious ceremonies.  It is probable, on the contrary, that\nthis custom was first introduced in times of simplicity–that the\nfirst thought was to honor the Deity in the symbol of life which\nit has given us; such a ceremony may have excited licentiousness\namong youths, and have appeared ridiculous to men of education in\nmore refined, more corrupt, and more enlightened times, but it\nnever had its origin in such feelings.  .  .  .  It is out of the\nquestion therefore to suppose that a general prevalence of vice\nwould of itself, without the authority of priests and scriptures,\nsuffice to lead to the defilement of holy temples.\"[101]",
        "[101] Rivers of Life, vol. i., p. 275.",
        "Originally the Ionians, as their name indicates, were Yoni\nworshippers, i. e., they belonged to the sect which was driven\nout of India because of their stubborn refusal to worship the\nmale energy as the Creator.  During the later ages of their\nhistory, at a time when their religion had degenerated into a\nlicensed system of vice and corruption, and after their temples\nhad become brothels in which, in the name of religion, were\npracticed the most debasing ceremonies, the Greeks became ashamed\nof their ancient worship, and, like the Jews, ashamed also of\ntheir name.",
        "It is believed that the Greeks received from Egypt, or the East,\ntheir first theological conceptions of God and religion.  These\nideas",
        "“were veiled in symbols, significant of a primitive monotheism;\nthese, at a later period, being translated into symbolical or\nallegorical language, were by the poets transformed into epic or\nnarrative myths, in which the original subject symbolized was\nalmost effaced, whilst the allegorical expressions were received\ngenerally in a literal sense.  Hence, to the many, the meaning of\nthe ancient doctrine was lost, and was communicated only to the\nfew, under the strictest secrecy in the mysteries of Eleusis and\nSamothrace.  Thus there was a popular theology to suit the\npeople, and a rational theology reserved for the educated, the\nsymbolical language in both being the same, but the meaning of it\nbeing taken differently.  In course of time, as knowledge makes\nits way among the people, and religious enlightenment with it,\nmuch of what had been received literally will relapse into its\noriginal figurative or symbolical meaning.  Reason will resume\nher supremacy, and stereotyped dogmas will fall like pagan idols\nbefore advancing truth.\"[102]",

        "Although, during the later ages of the human career, the higher\ntruths taught by an earlier race were lost, still a slight hint\nof the beauty and purity of the more ancient worship may be\ntraced through most of the ages of the history of religion.  Even\namong the profligate Greeks, the mysteries of Eleusis, celebrated\nin the temple of Ceres, were always respected.  Care should be\ntaken, however, not to confound these remnants of pure Nature-\nworship with that of the courtesan Venus, whose adoration, during\nthe degenerate days of Greece, represented only the lowest and\nmost corrupt conception of the female energy.",
        "Down to a late date in the annals of Athens there was celebrated\na religious festival called Thesmophoria.  The name of this\nfestival is derived from one of the cognomens of Ceres–the\ngoddess “who first gave laws and made life orderly.”  Ceres was\nthe divinity adored by the Amazons, and is essentially the same\nas the Egyptian Isis.  She represents universal female Nature. \nThe Thesmophorian rites, which are believed by most writers to\nhave been introduced into Greece directly from Thrace, were\nperformed by “virgins distinguished for probity in life, who\ncarried about in procession sacred books upon their heads.”",
        "Inman, in his Ancient Faiths, quotes an oracle of Apollo, from\nSpencer, to the effect that “Rhea the Mother of the Blessed, and\nthe Queen of the Gods, loved assemblages of women.”  As this\nfestival is in honor of Female Nature, the various female\nattributes are adored as deities, Demeter being the first named\nby the worshippers.  After a long season of fasting, and “after\nsolemn reflection on the mysteries of life, women splendidly\nattired in white garments assemble and scatter flowers in honor\nof the Great Mother.”",
        "The food partaken of by the devotees at these festivals was\ncakes, very similar in shape to those which were offered to the\nQueen of Heaven by the women of Judah in the days of Jeremiah, an\noffering which it will be remembered so displeased that prophet\nthat a curse was pronounced upon the entire people.",
        "As the strictest secrecy prevailed among the initiated respecting\nthese rites, the exact nature of the symbols employed at the\nThesmophorian festivals is not known; it is believed, however,\nthat it was the female emblem of generation, and that this\nfestival was held in honor of that event which from the earliest\ntimes had been prophesied by those who believed in the superior\nimportance of the female, namely, that unaided by the male power,\na woman would bring forth, and that this manifestation of female\nsufficiency would forever settle the question of the ascendancy\nof the female principle.  Through a return of the ancient ideas\nof purity and peace, mankind would be redeemed from the\nwretchedness and misery which had been the result of the decline\nof female power.  The dual idea entertained in the Thesmophorian\nworship is observed in the fact that although Ceres, the Great\nMother, was the principal Deity honored, Proserpine, the child,\nwas also comprehended, and with its Mother worshipped as part of\nthe Creator.  Thus we observe that down to a late date in the\nhistory of Grecian mythology the idea of a Holy Mother with her\nchild had not altogether disappeared as a representation of the\ngod-idea.",
        "To prove the worthiness of the ideas connected with the\nEleusinian mysteries it is stated that “there is not an instance\non record that the honor of initiation was ever obtained by a\nvery bad man.”",
        "In Rome these mysteries took another name and were called “the\nrites of Bona Dea,” which was but another name for Ceres.  As\nevidence of their purity we have the following:",
        "“All the distinguished Roman authors speak of these rites and in\nterms of profound respect.  Horace denounces the wretch who\nshould attempt to reveal the secrets of these rites; Virgil\nmentions these mysteries with great respect; and Cicero alludes\nto them with a greater reverence than either of the poets we have\nnamed.  Both the Greeks and the Romans punished any insult\noffered to these mysteries with the most persevering\nvindictiveness.  Alcibiades was charged with insulting these\nreligious rites, and although the proof of his offense was quite\ndoubtful, yet he suffered for it for years in exile and misery,\nand it must be allowed that he was the most popular man of his\nage.\"[103]",
        "[103] Chambers’s Edinburgh Journal.",
        "In Greece, the celebration of the Eleusinian mysteries was in the\nhands of the Emolpidae, one of the oldest and most respected\nfamilies of antiquity.  At Carthage, there were celebrated the\nPhiditia, religious solemnities similar to those already\ndescribed in Greece.  During the two or three days upon which\nthese festivals were celebrated, public feasts were prepared at\nwhich the youth were instructed by their elders in the state\nconcerning the principles which were to govern their conduct in\nafter life; truth, inward purity, and virtue being set forth as\nessentials to true manhood.  In later times, after these\nfestivals had found their way to Rome, they gradually succumbed\nto the immorality which prevailed, and at last, when their former\nexalted significance had been forgotten, they were finally sunk\ninto “the licentiousness of enjoyment, and the innocence of mirth\nwas superseded by the uproar of riot and vice! Such were the\nSaturnalia.”",
        "From the facts connected with the mysteries of Eleusis and the\nThesmophorian rites, it is evident that in its earlier stages\nNature-worship was absolutely free from the impurities which came\nto be associated with it in later times.  As the organs of\ngeneration had not originally been wholly disgraced and outraged,\nit is not unlikely that when the so-called “sculptured\nindecencies” appeared on the walls of the temples they were\nregarded as no more an offense against propriety and decency than\nwas the reappearance of the cross, the emblem of life, in later\ntimes, among orthodox Christians.",
        "Neither is it probable, in an age in which nothing that is\nnatural was considered indecent, and before the reproductive\nenergies had become degraded, that these symbols were any more\nsuggestive of impurity than are the Easter offerings upon our\nchurch altars at the present time.  Whatever may now be the\nsignificance of these offerings to those who present them, sure\nit is that they once, together with other devices connected with\nNature-worship, were simply emblems of fertility–symbols of a\nrisen and fructifying sun which by its gladdening rays re-creates\nand makes all things new again.",
        "If we carefully study the religion of past ages we will discover\nsomething more than a hint of an age when the generative\nfunctions were regarded as a sacred expression of creative power,\nand when the reproductive organs had not through over-stimulation\nand abuse been tabooed as objects altogether impure and unholy,\nand as things too disgraceful to be mentioned above a whisper. \nIndeed there is much evidence going to show that in an earlier\nage of the world’s history the degradation of mankind, through\nthe abuse of the creative functions, had not been accomplished,\nand the ills of life resulting from such abuse were unknown.",
        "We may reasonably believe that those instincts in the female\nwhich are correlated with maternal affection and which were\nacquired by her as a protection to the germ, or, in other words,\nthose characters which Nature has developed in the female to\ninsure the safety and well-being of offspring, and which in a\npurer and more natural stage of human existence acted as cheeks\nupon the energies of the male, were not easily or quickly\nsubdued; but when through subjection to the animal nature of man\nthese instincts or characters had been denied their natural\nexpression, and woman had become simply the instrument of man’s\npleasure, the comparatively pure worship of the organs of\ngeneration as symbols of creative power began to give place to\nthe deification of these members simply as emblems of desire, or\nas instruments for the stimulation of passion.",
        "We are assured that on the banks of the Ganges, the very cradle\nof religion, are still to be found various remnants of the most\nancient form of Nature-worship–that there are still to be\nobserved “certain high places sacred to more primitive ideas than\nthose represented by Vedic gods.”",
        "Here devout worshippers believe that the androgynous God of\nfertility, or Nature, still manifests itself to the faithful. \nClose beside these more ancient shrines are others representing a\nsomewhat later development of religious faith–shrines, by means\nof which are indicated some of the processes involved in the\nearlier growth of the god-idea.  Not far removed from these are\nto be found, also, numerous temples or places of worship\nbelonging to a still later faith–a faith in which are revealed\nthe “awakening and stimulation of every sensuous feeling, and\nwhich has drowned in infamy every noble impulse developed in\nhuman nature.”",
        "Of the depravity of the Jews and the immorality practiced in\ntheir religious rites, Forlong says:",
        "“No one can study their history, liberated from the blindness\nwhich our Christian up-bringing and associations cast over us,\nwithout seeing that the Jews were probably the grossest\nworshippers among all those Ophi–Phallo–Solar devotees who then\ncovered every land and sea, from the sources of the Nile and\nEuphrates to all over the Mediterranean coasts and isles.  These\nimpure faiths seem to have been very strictly maintained by Jews\nup to Hezekiah’s days, and by none more so than by dissolute\nSolomon and his cruel, lascivious bandit-father, the\nbrazen-faced adulterer and murderer, who broke his freely\nvolunteered oath, and sacrificed six innocent sons of his king to\nhis Javah.”",
        "Of Solomon he says that he devoted his energies and some little\nwealth “to rearing phallic and Solophallic shrines over all the\nhigh places around him, and especially in front of Jerusalem, and\non and around the Mount of Olives.”  On each side of the entrance\nto his celebrated temple, under the great phallic spire which\nformed the portico, were two handsome columns over fifty feet\nhigh, by the side of which were the sun God Belus and his\nchariots.",
        "In a description of this temple it is represented as being one\nhundred and twenty feet long and forty feet broad, while the\nporch, a phallic emblem, “was a huge tower, forty feet long,\ntwenty feet broad, and two hundred and forty feet high.”  We are\nassured by Forlong that Solomon’s temple was like hundreds\nobserved in the East, except that its walls were a little higher\nthan those usually seen, and the phallic spire out of proportion\nto the size of the structure.  “The Jewish porch is but the\nobelisk which the Egyptian placed beside his temple; the Boodhist\npillars which stood all around their Dagobas; the pillars of\nHercules, which stood near the Phoenician temple; and the spire\nwhich stands beside the Christian Church.\"[104]",
        "[104] Forlong, Rivers of Life, vol. i., p. 219.",
        "The rites and ceremonies observed in the worship of Baal-Peor are\nnot of a character to be described in these pages:  it is perhaps\nsufficient to state that by them the fact is clearly established\nthat profligacy, regulated and controlled by the priestly order\nas part and parcel of religion, was not confined to the Gentiles;\nbut, on the contrary, that the religious observances of the Jews\nprior to the Babylonian captivity were even more gross than were\nthose of the Assyrians or the Hindoos.",
        "These impure faiths arose at a time when man as the sole creator\nof offspring became god, when the natural instincts of woman were\nsubdued, and when passion as the highest expression of the divine\nforce came to be worshipped as the most important attribute of\nhumanity.",
        "The extent to which these faiths have influenced later religious\nbelief and observances is scarcely realized by those who have not\ngiven special attention to this subject.",
        "It has been stated that in the time of Solon, law-giver of\nAthens, there were twenty temples in the various cities of Greece\ndedicated to Venus the courtesan, within which were practiced, in\nthe name of religion, the most infamous rites and the most\nshameless self-abandonment; and that throughout Europe, down to a\nlate period in the history of the race, religious festivals were\ncelebrated at certain seasons of the year, at which the\nceremonies performed in honor of the god of fornication were of\nthe grossest nature, and at which the Bacchanalian orgies were\nonly equalled by those practiced in the religious temples of\nBabylon.",
        "It is impossible longer to conceal the fact that passion,\nsymbolized by a serpent, an upright stone, and by the male and\nfemale organs of generation, the male appearing as the “giver of\nlife,” the female as a necessary appendage to it, constituted the\ngod-idea of mankind for at least four thousand years; and,\ninstead of being confined to the earlier ages of that period, we\nshall presently see that phallic worship had not disappeared,\nunder Christianity, as late and even later than the sixteenth\ncentury.",
        "Such has been the result of the ascendancy gained by the grosser\nelements in human nature: the highest idea of the Infinite\npassion symbolized by the organs of generation, while the\nprincipal rites connected with its worship are scenes of\ndebauchery and self-abasement.",
        "At the present time it is by no means difficult to trace the\ngrowth of the god-idea.  First, as we have seen, a system of pure\nNature-worship appeared under the symbol of a Mother and child. \nIn process of time this particular form of worship was supplanted\nby a religion under which the male principle is seen to be in the\nascendancy over the female.  Later a more complicated system of\nNature-worship is observed in which the underlying principles are\nconcealed, or are understood only by the initiated.  Lastly,\nthese philosophical and recondite principles are forgotten and\nthe symbols themselves receive the adoration which once belonged\nto the Creator.  The change which the ideas concerning womanhood\nunderwent from the time when the natural feminine characters and\nqualities were worshipped as God, to the days of Solon the\nGrecian law-giver, when women had become merely tools or slaves\nfor the use and pleasure of men, is forcibly shown by a\ncomparison of the character ascribed to the female deities at the\ntwo epochs mentioned.  Athene who in an earlier age had\nrepresented Wisdom had in the age of Solon degenerated into a\npatroness of heroes; but even as a Goddess of war her patronage\nwas as nought compared with that of the courtesan Venus, at whose\nshrine “every man in Greece worshipped.”",
        "The extent to which women, in the name of religion, have been\ndegraded, and the part which in the past they have been compelled\nto assume in the worship of passion may not at the present time\nbe disguised, as facts concerning this subject are well\nauthenticated.  In a former work,[105] attention has been\ndirected to the religious rites of Babylon, the city in which it\nwill be remembered the Tower of Belus was situated.  Here women\nof all conditions and ranks were obliged, once in their life, to\nprostitute themselves in the temple for hire to any stranger who\nmight demand such service, which revenue was appropriated by the\npriests to be applied to sacred uses.  This act it will be\nremembered was a religious obligation imposed by religious\nteachers and enforced by priestly rule.  It was a sacrifice to\nthe god of passion.  A similar custom prevailed in Cyprus.",
        "[105] See Evolution of Woman, p. 228.",
        "Most of the temples of the later Hindoos had bands of consecrated\nwomen called the “Women of the Idol.”  These victims of the\npriests were selected in their infancy by Brahmins for the beauty\nof their persons, and were trained to every elegant\naccomplishment that could render them attractive and which would\ninsure success in the profession which they exercised at once for\nthe pleasure and profit of the priesthood.  They were never\nallowed to desert the temple; and the offspring of their\npromiscuous embraces were, if males, consecrated to the service\nof the Deity in the ceremonies of this worship, and, if females,\neducated in the profession of their mothers.[106]",
        "[106] Maurice, Indian Antiquities, vol. i.",
        "That prostitution was a religious observance, which was practiced\nin Eastern temples, cannot in the face of accessible facts be\ndoubted.  Regarding this subject, Inman says:",
        "“To us it is inconceivable, that the indulgence of passion could\nbe associated with religion, but so it was.  The words expressive\nof ’sanctuary,’ ’consecrated,’ and ’sodomites’ are in the Hebrew\nessentially the same.  It is amongst the Hindoos of to-day as it\nwas in the Greece and Italy of classic times; and we find that\n’holy woman’ is a title given to those who devote their bodies to\nbe used for hire, which goes to the service of the temple.”",
        "The extent to which ages of corruption have vitiated the purer\ninstincts of human nature, and the degree to which centuries of\nsensuality and superstition have degraded the nature of man, may\nbe noticed at the present time in the admissions which are\nfrequently made by male writers regarding the change which during\nthe history of the race has taken place in the god-idea.  None of\nthe attributes of women, not even that holy instinct–maternal\nlove, can by many of them be contemplated apart from the ideas of\ngrossness which have attended the sex-functions during the ages\nsince women first became enslaved.  As an illustration of this we\nhave the following from an eminent philologist of recent times, a\nwriter whose able efforts in unravelling religious myths bear\ntestimony to his mental strength and literary ability.",
        "“The Chaldees believed in a celestial virgin who had purity of\nbody, loveliness of person, and tenderness of affection, and she\nwas one to whom the erring sinner could appeal with more chance\nof success than to a stern father.  She was portrayed as a mother\nwith a child in her arms, and every attribute ascribed to her\nshowing that she was supposed to be as fond as any earthly female\never was.\"[107]",
        "[107] Inman, Ancient Faiths, vol. i., p. 59.",
        "After thus describing the early Chaldean Deity, who, although a\npure and spotless virgin, was nevertheless worshipped as a\nmother, or as the embodiment of the altruistic principles\ndeveloped in mankind, this writer goes on to say: “The worship of\nthe woman by man naturally led to developments which our\nCOMPARATIVELY SENSITIVE NATURES [the italics are mine] shun as\nbeing opposed to all religious feeling,” which sentiment clearly\nreveals the inability of this writer to estimate womanhood, or\neven motherhood, apart from the sensualized ideas which during\nthe ages in which passion has been the recognized god have\ngathered about it.",
        "The purity of life and the high stage of civilization reached by\nan ancient people, and the fact that these conditions were\nreached under pure Nature-worship, or when the natural attributes\nof the female were regarded as the highest expression of the\ndivine in the human, prove that it was neither the appreciation\nnor the deification of womanhood which “led to developments which\nsensitive natures shun as being opposed to all religious\nfeeling,” but, on the contrary, that it was the lack of such\nappreciation which stimulated the lower nature of man and\nencouraged every form of sensuality and superstition.  In other\nwords, it was the subjection of the natural female instincts and\nthe deification of brute passion during the later ages of human\nhistory which have degraded religion and corrupted human nature.",
        "Although at the present time it is quite impossible for scholars\nto veil the fact that the god-idea was originally worshipped as\nfemale, still, most modern writers who deal with this subject\nseem unable to understand the state of human society which must\nhave existed when the instincts, qualities, and characters\npeculiar to the female constitution were worshipped as divine. \nSo corrupt has human nature become through over-stimulation and\nindulgence of the lower propensities, that it seems impossible\nfor those who have thus far dealt with this subject to perceive\nin the earlier conceptions of a Deity any higher idea than that\nconveyed to their minds at the present time by the sexual\nattributes and physical functions of females–namely, their\ncapacity to bring forth, coupled with the power to gratify the\nanimal instincts of males, functions which women share with the\nlower orders of life.",
        "The fact that by an ancient race woman was regarded as the head\nor crown of creation, that she was the first emanation from the\nDeity, or, more properly speaking, that she represented\nPerceptive Wisdom, seems at the present time not to be\ncomprehended, or at least not acknowledged.  The more recently\ndeveloped idea, that she was designed as an appendage to man, and\ncreated specially for his use and pleasure,–a conception which\nis the direct result of the supremacy of the lower instincts over\nthe higher faculties,–has for ages been taught as a religious\ndoctrine which to doubt involves the rankest heresy.",
        "The androgynous Venus of the earlier ages, a deity which although\nfemale was figured with a beard to denote that within her were\nembraced the masculine powers, embodied a conception of universal\nwomanhood and the Deity widely different from that entertained in\nthe later ages of Greece, at a time when Venus the courtesan\nrepresented all the powers and capacities of woman considered\nworthy of deification.",
        "To such an extent, in later ages, have all our ideas of the\nInfinite become masculinized that in extant history little except\noccasional hints is to be found of the fact that during\nnumberless ages of human existence the Supreme Creator was\nworshipped as female.",
        "One has only to study the Greek character to anticipate the\nmanner in which any subject pertaining to women would be treated\nby that arrogant and conceited race; and, as until recently most\nof our information concerning the past has come through Greek\nsources, the distorted and one-sided view taken of human events,\nand the contempt with which the feminine half of society has been\nregarded, are in no wise surprising.  We must bear in mind the\nfact, however, that the Greeks were but the degenerate\ndescendants of the highly civilized peoples whom they were\npleased to term “barbarians,” and that they knew less of the\norigin and character of the gods which they worshipped, and which\nthey had borrowed from other countries, than is known of them at\nthe present time.",
        "About 600 years B.C., we may believe that mankind had sunk to the\nlowest depth of human degradation, since which time humanity has\nbeen slowly retracting its course; not, however, with any degree\nof continuity or regularity, nor without lapses, during which for\nhundreds of years the current seemed to roll backward.  Indeed\nwhen we review the history of the intervening ages, and note the\nextent to which passion, prejudice, and superstition have been in\nthe ascendancy over reason and judgment, we may truly say: “The\nfathers have eaten sour grapes and the children’s teeth have been\nset on edge.”",
