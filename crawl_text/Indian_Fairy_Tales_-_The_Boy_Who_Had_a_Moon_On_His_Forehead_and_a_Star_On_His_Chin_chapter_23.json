        "In a country were seven daughters of poor parents, who used to come\ndaily to play under the shady trees in the King’s garden with the\ngardener’s daughter; and daily she used to say to them, “When I am\nmarried I shall have a son. Such a beautiful boy as he will be has\nnever been seen. He will have a moon on his forehead and a star on his\nchin.” Then her playfellows used to laugh at her and mock her.",
        "But one day the King heard her telling them about the beautiful boy she\nwould have when she was married, and he said to himself he should like\nvery much to have such a son; the more so that though he had already\nfour Queens he had no child. He went, therefore, to the gardener and\ntold him he wished to marry his daughter. This delighted the gardener\nand his wife, who thought it would indeed be grand for their daughter\nto become a princess. So they said “Yes” to the King, and invited all\ntheir friends to the wedding. The King invited all his, and he gave the\ngardener as much money as he wanted. Then the wedding was held with\ngreat feasting and rejoicing.",
        "A year later the day drew near on which the gardener’s daughter was to\nhave her son; and the King’s four other Queens came constantly to see\nher. One day they said to her, “The King hunts every day; and the time\nis soon coming when you will have your child. Suppose you fell ill\nwhilst he was out hunting and could therefore know nothing of your\nillness, what would you do then?”",
        "When the King came home that evening, the gardener’s daughter said to\nhim, “Every day you go out hunting. Should I ever be in trouble or sick\nwhile you are away, how could I send for you?” The King gave her a\nkettle-drum which he placed near the door for her, and he said to her,\n“Whenever you want me, beat this kettle-drum. No matter how far away I\nmay be, I shall hear it, and will come at once to you.”",
        "Next morning when the King had gone out to hunt, his four other Queens\ncame to see the gardener’s daughter. She told them all about her\nkettle-drum. “Oh,” they said, “do drum on it just to see if the King\nreally will come to you.”",
        "“No, I will not,” she said; “for why should I call him from his hunting\nwhen I do not want him?”",
        "“Don’t mind interrupting his hunting,” they answered. “Do try if he\nreally will come to you when you beat your kettle-drum.” So at last,\njust to please them, she beat it, and the King stood before her.",
        "“Why have you called me?” he said. “See, I have left my hunting to come\nto you.”",
        "“I want nothing,” she answered; “I only wished to know if you really\nwould come to me when I beat my drum.”",
        "“Very well,” answered the King; “but do not call me again unless you\nreally need me.” Then he returned to his hunting.",
        "The next day, when the King had gone out hunting as usual, the four\nQueens again came to see the gardener’s daughter. They begged and\nbegged her to beat her drum once more, “just to see if the King will\nreally come to see you this time.” At first she refused, but at last\nshe consented. So she beat her drum, and the King came to her. But when\nhe found she was neither ill nor in trouble, he was angry, and said to\nher, “Twice I have left my hunting and lost my game to come to you when\nyou did not need me. Now you may call me as much as you like, but I\nwill not come to you,” and then he went away in a rage.",
        "The third day the gardener’s daughter fell ill, and she beat and beat\nher kettle-drum; but the King never came. He heard her kettle-drum, but\nhe thought, “She does not really want me; she is only trying to see if\nI will go to her.”",
        "Meanwhile the four other Queens came to her, and they said, “Here it is\nthe custom before a child is born to bind its mother’s eyes with a\nhandkerchief that she may not see it just at first. So let us bind your\neyes.” She answered, “Very well, bind my eyes.” The four wives then\ntied a handkerchief over them.",
        "Soon after, the gardener’s daughter had a beautiful little son, with a\nmoon on his forehead and a star on his chin, and before the poor mother\nhad seen him, the four wicked Queens took the boy to the nurse and said\nto her, “Now you must not let this child make the least sound for fear\nhis mother should hear him; and in the night you must either kill him,\nor else take him away, so that his mother may never see him. If you\nobey our orders, we will give you a great many rupees.” All this they\ndid out of spite. The nurse took the little child and put him into a\nbox, and the four Queens went back to the gardener’s daughter.",
        "First they put a stone into her boy’s little bed, and then they took\nthe handkerchief off her eyes and showed it her, saying, “Look! this is\nyour son!” The poor girl cried bitterly, and thought, “What will the\nKing say when he finds no child?” But she could do nothing.",
        "When the King came home; he was furious at hearing his youngest wife,\nthe gardener’s daughter, had given him a stone instead of the beautiful\nlittle son she had promised him. He made her one of the palace\nservants, and never spoke to her.",
        "In the middle of the night the nurse took the box in which was the\nbeautiful little prince, and went out to a broad plain in the jungle.\nThere she dug a hole, made the fastenings of the box sure, and put the\nbox into the hole, although the child in it was still alive. The King’s\ndog, whose name was Shankar, had followed her to see what she did with\nthe box. As soon as she had gone back to the four Queens (who gave her\na great many rupees), the dog went to the hole in which she had put the\nbox, took the box out, and opened it. When he saw the beautiful little\nboy, he was very much delighted and said, “If it pleases Khuda that\nthis child should live, I will not hurt him; I will not eat him, but I\nwill swallow him whole and hide him in my stomach.” This he did.",
        "After six months had passed, the dog went by night to the jungle, and\nthought, “I wonder whether the boy is alive or dead.” Then he brought\nthe child out of his stomach and rejoiced over his beauty. The boy was\nnow six months old. When Shankar had caressed and loved him, he\nswallowed him again for another six months. At the end of that time he\nwent once more by night to the broad jungle-plain. There he brought up\nthe child out of his stomach (the child was now a year old), and\ncaressed and petted him a great deal, and was made very happy by his\ngreat beauty.",
        "But this time the dog’s keeper had followed and watched the dog; and he\nsaw all that Shankar did, and the beautiful little child, so he ran to\nthe four Queens and said to them, “Inside the King’s dog there is a\nchild! the loveliest child! He has a moon on his forehead and a star on\nhis chin. Such a child has never been seen!” At this the four wives\nwere very much frightened, and as soon as the King came home from\nhunting they said to him, “While you were away your dog came to our\nrooms, and tore our clothes and knocked about all our things. We are\nafraid he will kill us.” “Do not be afraid,” said the King. “Eat your\ndinner and be happy. I will have the dog shot to-morrow morning.”",
        "Then he ordered his servants to shoot the dog at dawn, but the dog\nheard him, and said to himself, “What shall I do? The King intends to\nkill me. I don’t care about that, but what will become of the child if\nI am killed? He will die. But I will see if I cannot save him.”",
        "So when it was night, the dog ran to the King’s cow, who was called\nSuri, and said to her, “Suri, I want to give you something, for the\nKing has ordered me to be shot to-morrow. Will you take great care of\nwhatever I give you?”",
        "“Let me see what it is,” said Suri, “I will take care of it if I can.\"\nThen they both went together to the wide plain, and there the dog\nbrought up the boy. Suri was enchanted with him. “I never saw such a\nbeautiful child in this country,” she said. “See, he has a moon on his\nforehead and a star on his chin. I will take the greatest care of him.\"\nSo saying she swallowed the little prince. The dog made her a great\nmany salaams, and said, “To-morrow I shall die;” and the cow then went\nback to her stable.",
        "Next morning at dawn the dog was taken to the jungle and shot.",
        "The child now lived in Suri’s stomach; and when one whole year had\npassed, and he was two years old, the cow went out to the plain, and\nsaid to herself, “I do not know whether the child is alive or dead. But\nI have never hurt it, so I will see.” Then she brought up the boy; and\nhe played about, and Suri was delighted; she loved him and caressed\nhim, and talked to him. Then she swallowed him, and returned to her\nstable.",
        "At the end of another year she went again to the plain and brought up\nthe child. He played and ran about for an hour to her great delight,\nand she talked to him and caressed him. His great beauty made her very\nhappy. Then she swallowed him once more and returned to her stable. The\nchild was now three years old.",
        "But this time the cowherd had followed Suri, and had seen the wonderful\nchild and all she did to it. So he ran and told the four Queens, “The\nKing’s cow has a beautiful boy inside her. He has a moon on his\nforehead and a star on his chin. Such a child has never been seen\nbefore!”",
        "At this the Queens were terrified. They tore their clothes and their\nhair and cried. When the King came home at evening, he asked them why\nthey were so agitated. “Oh,” they said, “your cow came and tried to\nkill us; but we ran away. She tore our hair and our clothes.” “Never\nmind,” said the King. “Eat your dinner and be happy. The cow shall be\nkilled to-morrow morning.”",
        "Now Suri heard the King give this order to the servants, so she said to\nherself, “What shall I do to save the child?” When it was midnight, she\nwent to the King’s horse called Katar, who was very wicked, and quite\nuntameable. No one had ever been able to ride him; indeed no one could\ngo near him with safety, he was so savage. Suri said to this horse,\n“Katar, will you take care of something that I want to give you,\nbecause the King has ordered me to be killed to-morrow?”",
        "“Good,” said Katar; “show me what it is.” Then Suri brought up the\nchild, and the horse was delighted with him. “Yes,” he said, “I will\ntake the greatest care of him. Till now no one has been able to ride\nme, but this child shall ride me.” Then he swallowed the boy, and when\nhe had done so, the cow made him many salaams, saying, “It is for this\nboy’s sake that I am to die.” The next morning she was taken to the\njungle and there killed.",
        "The beautiful boy now lived in the horse’s stomach, and he stayed in it\nfor one whole year. At the end of that time the horse thought, “I will\nsee if this child is alive or dead.” So he brought him up; and then he\nloved him, and petted him, and the little prince played all about the\nstable, out of which the horse was never allowed to go. Katar was very\nglad to see the child, who was now four years old. After he had played\nfor some time, the horse swallowed him again. At the end of another\nyear, when the boy was five years old, Katar brought him up again,\ncaressed him, loved him, and let him play about the stable as he had\ndone a year before. Then the horse swallowed him again.",
        "But this time the groom had seen all that happened, and when it was\nmorning, and the King had gone away to his hunting, he went to the four\nwicked Queens, and told them all he had seen, and all about the\nwonderful, beautiful child that lived inside the King’s horse Katar. On\nhearing the groom’s story the four Queens cried, and tore their hair\nand clothes, and refused to eat. When the King returned at evening and\nasked them why they were so miserable, they said, “Your horse Katar\ncame and tore our clothes, and upset all our things, and we ran away\nfor fear he should kill us.”",
        "“Never mind,” said the King. “Only eat your dinner and be happy. I will\nhave Katar shot to-morrow.” Then he thought that two men unaided could\nnot kill such a wicked horse, so he ordered his servants to bid his\ntroop of sepoys shoot him.",
        "So the next day the King placed his sepoys all round the stable, and he\ntook up his stand with them; and he said he would himself shoot any one\nwho let his horse escape.",
        "Meanwhile the horse had overheard all these orders. So he brought up\nthe child and said to him, “Go into that little room that leads out of\nthe stable, and you will find in it a saddle and bridle which you must\nput on me. Then you will find in the room some beautiful clothes such\nas princes wear; these you must put on yourself; and you must take the\nsword and gun you will find there too. Then you must mount on my back.\"\nNow Katar was a fairy-horse, and came from the fairies’ country, so he\ncould get anything he wanted; but neither the King nor any of his\npeople knew this.",
        "When all was ready, Katar burst out of his stable, with the prince on\nhis back, rushed past the King himself before the King had time to\nshoot him, galloped away to the great jungle-plain, and galloped about\nall over it. The King saw his horse had a boy on his back, though he\ncould not see the boy distinctly. The sepoys tried in vain to shoot the\nhorse; he galloped much too fast; and at last they were all scattered\nover the plain. Then the King had to give it up and go home; and the\nsepoys went to their homes. The King could not shoot any of his sepoys\nfor letting his horse escape, for he himself had let him do so.",
        "Then Katar galloped away, on, and on, and on; and when night came they\nstayed under a tree, he and the King’s son. The horse ate grass, and\nthe boy wild fruits which he found in the jungle. Next morning they\nstarted afresh, and went far, and far, till they came to a jungle in\nanother country, which did not belong to the little prince’s father,\nbut to another king. Here Katar said to the boy, “Now get off my back.\"\nOff jumped the prince. “Unsaddle me and take off my bridle; take off\nyour beautiful clothes and tie them all up in a bundle with your sword\nand gun.” This the boy did. Then the horse gave him some poor, common\nclothes, which he told him to put on. As soon as he was dressed in them\nthe horse said, “Hide your bundle in this grass, and I will take care\nof it for you. I will always stay in this jungle-plain, so that when\nyou want me you will always find me. You must now go away and find\nservice with some one in this country.”",
        "This made the boy very sad. “I know nothing about anything,” he said.\n“What shall I do all alone in this country?”",
        "“Do not be afraid,” answered Katar. “You will find service, and I will\nalways stay here to help you when you want me. So go, only before you\ngo, twist my right ear.” The boy did so, and his horse instantly became\na donkey. “Now twist your right ear,” said Katar. And when the boy had\ntwisted it, he was no longer a handsome prince, but a poor, common-\nlooking, ugly man; and his moon and star were hidden.",
        "Then he went away further into the country, until he came to a grain\nmerchant of the country, who asked him who he was. “I am a poor man,\"\nanswered the boy, “and I want service.” “Good,” said the grain\nmerchant, “you shall be my servant.”",
        "Now the grain merchant lived near the King’s palace, and one night at\ntwelve o’clock the boy was very hot; so he went out into the King’s\ncool garden, and began to sing a lovely song. The seventh and youngest\ndaughter of the King heard him, and she wondered who it was who could\nsing so deliciously. Then she put on her clothes, rolled up her hair,\nand came down to where the seemingly poor common man was lying singing.\n“Who are you? where do you come from?” she asked.",
        "But he answered nothing.",
        "“Who is this man who does not answer when I speak to him?” thought the\nlittle princess, and she went away. On the second night the same thing\nhappened, and on the third night too. But on the third night, when she\nfound she could not make him answer her, she said to him, “What a\nstrange man you are not to answer me when I speak to you.” But still he\nremained silent, so she went away.",
        "The next day, when he had finished his work, the young prince went to\nthe jungle to see his horse, who asked him, “Are you quite well and\nhappy?” “Yes, I am,” answered the boy. “I am servant to a grain\nmerchant. The last three nights I have gone into the King’s garden and\nsung a song, and each night the youngest princess has come to me and\nasked me who I am, and whence I came, and I have answered nothing. What\nshall I do now?” The horse said, “Next time she asks you who you are,\ntell her you are a very poor man, and came from your own country to\nfind service here.”",
        "The boy then went home to the grain merchant, and at night, when every\none had gone to bed, he went to the King’s garden and sang his sweet\nsong again. The youngest princess heard him, got up, dressed, and came\nto him. “Who are you? Whence do you come?” she asked.",
        "“I am a very poor man,” he answered. “I came from my own country to\nseek service here, and I am now one of the grain merchant’s servants.\"\nThen she went away. For three more nights the boy sang in the King’s\ngarden, and each night the princess came and asked him the same\nquestions as before, and the boy gave her the same answers.",
        "Then she went to her father, and said to him, “Father, I wish to be\nmarried; but I must choose my husband myself.” Her father consented to\nthis, and he wrote and invited all the Kings and Rajas in the land,\nsaying, “My youngest daughter wishes to be married, but she insists on\nchoosing her husband herself. As I do not know who it is she wishes to\nmarry, I beg you will all come on a certain day, for her to see you and\nmake her choice.”",
        "A great many Kings, Rajas, and their sons accepted this invitation and\ncame. When they had all arrived, the little princess’s father said to\nthem, “To-morrow morning you must all sit together in my garden” (the\nKing’s garden was very large), “for then my youngest daughter will come\nand see you all, and choose her husband. I do not know whom she will\nchoose.”",
        "The youngest princess ordered a grand elephant to be ready for her the\nnext morning, and when the morning came, and all was ready, she dressed\nherself in the most lovely clothes, and put on her beautiful jewels;\nthen she mounted her elephant, which was painted blue. In her hand she\ntook a gold necklace.",
        "Then she went into the garden where the Kings, Rajas, and their sons\nwere seated. The boy, the grain merchant’s servant, was also in the\ngarden: not as a suitor, but looking on with the other servants.",
        "The princess rode all round the garden, and looked at all the Kings and\nRajas and princes, and then she hung the gold necklace round the neck\nof the boy, the grain merchant’s servant. At this everybody laughed,\nand the Kings were greatly astonished. But then they and the Rajas\nsaid, “What fooling is this?” and they pushed the pretended poor man\naway, and took the necklace off his neck, and said to him, “Get out of\nthe way, you poor, dirty man. Your clothes are far too dirty for you to\ncome near us!” The boy went far away from them, and stood a long way\noff to see what would happen.",
        "Then the King’s youngest daughter went all round the garagain, holding\nher gold necklace in her hand, and once more she hung it round the\nboy’s neck. Every one laughed at her and said, “How can the King’s\ndaughter think of marrying this poor, common man!” and the Kings and\nthe Rajas, who had come as suitors, all wanted to turn him out of the\ngarden. But the princess said, “Take care! take care! You must not turn\nhim out. Leave him alone.” Then she put him on her elephant, and took\nhim to the palace.",
        "The Kings and Rajas and their sons were very much astonished, and said,\n“What does this mean? The princess does not care to marry one of us,\nbut chooses that very poor man!” Her father then stood up, and said to\nthem all, “I promised my daughter she should marry any one she pleased,\nand as she has twice chosen that poor, common man, she shall marry\nhim.” And so the princess and the boy were married with great pomp and\nsplendour: her father and mother were quite content with her choice;\nand the Kings, the Rajas and their sons, all returned to their homes.",
        "Now the princess’s six sisters had all married rich princes, and they\nlaughed at her for choosing such a poor ugly husband as hers seemed to\nbe, and said to each other, mockingly, “See! our sister has married\nthis poor, common man!” Their six husbands used to go out hunting every\nday, and every evening they brought home quantities of all kinds of\ngame to their wives, and the game was cooked for their dinner and for\nthe King’s; but the husband of the youngest princess always stayed at\nhome in the palace, and never went out hunting at all. This made her\nvery sad, and she said to herself, “My sisters’ husbands hunt every\nday, but my husband never hunts at all.”",
        "At last she said to him, “Why do you never go out hunting as my\nsisters’ husbands do every day, and every day they bring home\nquantities of all kinds of game? Why do you always stay at home,\ninstead of doing as they do?”",
        "One day he said to her, “I am going out to-day to eat the air.”",
        "“Very good,” she answered; “go, and take one of the horses.”",
        "“No,” said the young prince, “I will not ride, I will walk.” Then he\nwent to the jungle-plain where he had left Katar, who all this time had\nseemed to be a donkey, and he told Katar everything. “Listen,” he said;\n“I have married the youngest princess; and when we were married\neverybody laughed at her for choosing me, and said, ’What a very poor,\ncommon man our princess has chosen for her husband!’ Besides, my wife\nis very sad, for her six sisters’ husbands all hunt every day, and\nbring home quantities of game, and their wives therefore are very proud\nof them. But I stay at home all day, and never hunt. To-day I should\nlike to hunt very much.”",
        "“Well,” said Katar, “then twist my left ear;” and as soon as the boy\nhad twisted it, Katar was a horse again, and not a donkey any longer.\n“Now,” said Katar, “twist your left ear, and you will see what a\nbeautiful young prince you will become.” So the boy twisted his own\nleft ear, and there he stood no longer a poor, common, ugly man, but a\ngrand young prince with a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin.\nThen he put on his splendid clothes, saddled and bridled Katar, got on\nhis back with his sword and gun, and rode off to hunt.",
        "He rode very far, and shot a great many birds and a quantity of deer.\nThat day his six brothers-in-law could find no game, for the beautiful\nyoung prince had shot it all. Nearly all the day long these six princes\nwandered about looking in vain for game; till at last they grew hungry\nand thirsty, and could find no water, and they had no food with them.\nMeanwhile the beautiful young prince had sat down under a tree, to dine\nand rest, and there his six brothers-in-law found him. By his side was\nsome delicious water, and also some roast meat.",
        "When they saw him the six princes said to each other, “Look at that\nhandsome prince. He has a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin.\nWe have never seen such a prince in this jungle before; he must come\nfrom another country.” Then they came up to him, and made him many\nsalaams, and begged him to give them some food and water. “Who are\nyou?” said the young prince. “We are the husbands of the six elder\ndaughters of the King of this country,” they answered; “and we have\nhunted all day, and are very hungry and thirsty.” They did not\nrecognise their brother-in-law in the least.",
        "“Well,” said the young prince, “I will give you something to eat and\ndrink if you will do as I bid you.” “We will do all you tell us to do,\"\nthey answered, “for if we do not get water to drink, we shall die.\"\n“Very good,” said the young prince. “Now you must let me put a red-hot\npice on the back of each of you, and then I will give you food and\nwater. Do you agree to this?” The six princes consented, for they\nthought, “No one will ever see the mark of the pice, as it will be\ncovered by our clothes; and we shall die if we have no water to drink.\"\nThen the young prince took six pice, and made them red-hot in the fire;\nhe laid one on the back of each of the six princes, and gave them good\nfood and water. They ate and drank; and when they had finished they\nmade him many salaams and went home.",
        "The young prince stayed under the tree till it was evening; then he\nmounted his horse and rode off to the King’s palace. All the people\nlooked at him as he came riding along, saying, “What a splendid young\nprince that is! He has a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin.\"\nBut no one recognised him. When he came near the King’s palace, all the\nKing’s servants asked him who he was; and as none of them knew him, the\ngate-keepers would not let him pass in. They all wondered who he could\nbe, and all thought him the most beautiful prince that had ever been\nseen.",
        "At last they asked him who he was. “I am the husband of your youngest\nprincess,” he answered.",
        "“No, no, indeed you are not,” they said; “for he is a poor, common-\nlooking, and ugly man.”",
        "“But I am he,” answered the prince; only no one would believe him.",
        "“Tell us the truth,” said the servants; “who are you?”",
        "“Perhaps you cannot recognise me,” said the young prince, “but call the\nyoungest princess here. I wish to speak to her.” The servants called\nher, and she came. “That man is not my husband,” she said at once. “My\nhusband is not nearly as handsome as that man. This must be a prince\nfrom another country.”",
        "Then she said to him, “Who are you? Why do you say you are my husband?”",
        "“Because I am your husband. I am telling you the truth,” answered the\nyoung prince.",
        "“No you are not, you are not telling me the truth,” said the little\nprincess. “My husband is not a handsome man like you. I married a very\npoor, common-looking man.”",
        "“That is true,” he answered, “but nevertheless I am your husband. I was\nthe grain merchant’s servant; and one hot night I went into your\nfather’s garden and sang, and you heard me, and came and asked me who I\nwas and where I came from, and I would not answer you. And the same\nthing happened the next night, and the next, and on the fourth I told\nyou I was a very poor man, and had come from my country to seek service\nin yours, and that I was the grain merchant’s servant. Then you told\nyour father you wished to marry, but must choose your own husband; and\nwhen all the Kings and Rajas were seated in your father’s garden, you\nsat on an elephant and went round and looked at them all; and then\ntwice hung your gold necklace round my neck, and chose me. See, here is\nyour necklace, and here are the ring and the handkerchief you gave me\non our wedding day.”",
        "Then she believed him, and was very glad that her husband was such a\nbeautiful young prince. “What a strange man you are!” she said to him.\n“Till now you have been poor, and ugly, and common-looking. Now you are\nbeautiful and look like a prince; I never saw such a handsome man as\nyou are before; and yet I know you must be my husband.” Then she\nworshipped God and thanked him for letting her have such a husband. “I\nhave,” she said, “a beautiful husband. There is no one like him in this\ncountry. He has a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin.” Then\nshe took him into the palace, and showed him to her father and mother\nand to every one. They all said they had never seen any one like him,\nand were all very happy. And the young prince lived as before in the\nKing’s palace with his wife, and Katar lived in the King’s stables.",
        "One day, when the King and his seven sons-in-law were in his court-\nhouse, and it was full of people, the young prince said to him, “There\nare six thieves here in your court-house.” “Six thieves!” said the\nKing. “Where are they? Show them to me.” “There they are,” said the\nyoung prince, pointing to his six brothers-in-law. The King and every\none else in the court-house were very much astonished, and would not\nbelieve the young prince. “Take off their coats,” he said, “and then\nyou will see for yourselves that each of them has the mark of a thief\non his back.” So their coats were taken off the six princes, and the\nKing and everybody in the court-house saw the mark of the red-hot pice.\nThe six princes were very much ashamed, but the young prince was very\nglad. He had not forgotten how his brothers-in-law had laughed at him\nand mocked him when he seemed a poor, common man.",
        "Now, when Katar was still in the jungle, before the prince was married,\nhe had told the boy the whole story of his birth, and all that had\nhappened to him and his mother. “When you are married,” he said to him,\n“I will take you back to your father’s country.” So two months after\nthe young prince had revenged himself on his brothers-in-law, Katar\nsaid to him, “It is time for you to return to your father. Get the King\nto let you go to your own country, and I will tell you what to do when\nwe get there.”",
        "The prince always did what his horse told him to do; so he went to his\nwife and said to her, “I wish very much to go to my own country to see\nmy father and mother.” “Very well,” said his wife; “I will tell my\nfather and mother, and ask them to let us go.” Then she went to them,\nand told them, and they consented to let her and her husband leave\nthem. The King gave his daughter and the young prince a great many\nhorses, and elephants, and all sorts of presents, and also a great many\nsepoys to guard them. In this grand state they travelled to the\nprince’s country, which was not a great many miles off. When they\nreached it they pitched their tents on the same plain in which the\nprince had been left in his box by the nurse, where Shankar and Suri\nhad swallowed him so often.",
        "When the King, his father, the gardener’s daughter’s husband, saw the\nprince’s camp, he was very much alarmed, and thought a great King had\ncome to make war on him. He sent one of his servants, therefore, to ask\nwhose camp it was. The young prince then wrote him a letter, in which\nhe said, “You are a great King. Do not fear me. I am not come to make\nwar on you. I am as if I were your son. I am a prince who has come to\nsee your country and to speak with you. I wish to give you a grand\nfeast, to which every one in your country must come–men and women, old\nand young, rich and poor, of all castes; all the children, fakirs, and\nsepoys. You must bring them all here to me for a week, and I will feast\nthem all.”",
        "The King was delighted with this letter, and ordered all the men,\nwomen, and children of all castes, fakirs, and sepoys, in his country\nto go to the prince’s camp to a grand feast the prince would give them.\nSo they all came, and the King brought his four wives too. All came, at\nleast all but the gardener’s daughter. No one had told her to go to the\nfeast, for no one had thought of her.",
        "When all the people were assembled, the prince saw his mother was not\nthere, and he asked the King, “Has every one in your country come to my\nfeast?”",
        "“Yes, every one,” said the King.",
        "“Are you sure of that?” asked the prince.",
        "“Quite sure,” answered the King.",
        "“I am sure one woman has not come,” said the prince. “She is your\ngardener’s daughter, who was once your wife and is now a servant in\nyour palace.”",
        "“True,” said the King, “I had forgotten her.” Then the prince told his\nservants to take his finest palanquin and to fetch the gardener’s\ndaughter. They were to bathe her, dress her in beautiful clothes and\nhandsome jewels, and then bring her to him in the palanquin.",
        "While the servants were bringing the gardener’s daughter, the King\nthought how handsome the young prince was; and he noticed particularly\nthe moon on his forehead and the star on his chin, and he wondered in\nwhat country the young prince was born.",
        "And now the palanquin arrived bringing the gardener’s daughter, and the\nyoung prince went himself and took her out of it, and brought her into\nthe tent. He made her a great many salaams. The four wicked wives\nlooked on and were very much surprised and very angry. They remembered\nthat, when they arrived, the prince had made them no salaams, and since\nthen had not taken the least notice of them; whereas he could not do\nenough for the gardener’s daughter, and seemed very glad to see her.",
        "When they were all at dinner, the prince again made the gardener’s\ndaughter a great many salaams, and gave her food from all the nicest\ndishes. She wondered at his kindness to her, and thought, “Who is this\nhandsome prince, with a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin? I\nnever saw any one so beautiful. What country does he come from?”",
        "Two or three days were thus passed in feasting, and all that time the\nKing and his people were talking about the prince’s beauty, and\nwondering who he was.",
        "One day the prince asked the King if he had any children. “None,” he\nanswered.",
        "“Do you know who I am?” asked the prince.",
        "“No,” said the King. “Tell me who you are.”",
        "“I am your son,” answered the prince, “and the gardener’s daughter is\nmy mother.”",
        "The King shook his head sadly. “How can you be my son,” he said, “when\nI have never had any children?”",
        "“But I am your son,” answered the prince. “Your four wicked Queens told\nyou the gardener’s daughter had given you a stone and not a son; but it\nwas they who put the stone in my little bed, and then they tried to\nkill me.”",
        "The King did not believe him. “I wish you were my son,” he said; “but as\nI never had a child, you cannot be my son.” “Do you remember your dog\nShankar, and how you had him killed? And do you remember your cow Suri,\nand how you had her killed too? Your wives made you kill them because\nof me. And,” he said, taking the King to Katar, “do you know whose\nhorse that is?”",
        "The King looked at Katar, and then said, “That is my horse, Katar.\"\n“Yes,” said the prince. “Do you not remember how he rushed past you out\nof his stable with me on his back?” Then Katar told the King the prince\nwas really his son, and told him all the story of his birth, and of his\nlife up to that moment; and when the King found the beautiful prince\nwas indeed his son, he was so glad, so glad. He put his arms round him\nand kissed him and cried for joy.",
        "“Now,” said the King, “you must come with me to my palace, and live\nwith me always.”",
        "“No,” said the prince, “that I cannot do. I cannot go to your palace. I\nonly came here to fetch my mother; and now that I have found her, I\nwill take her with me to my father-in-law’s palace. I have married a\nKing’s daughter, and we live with her father.”",
        "“But now that I have found you, I cannot let you go,” said his father.\nYou and your wife must come and live with your mother and me in my\npalace.”",
        "“That we will never do,” said the prince, “unless you will kill your\nfour wicked Queens with your own hand. If you will do that, we will\ncome and live with you.”",
        "So the King killed his Queens, and then he and his wife, the gardener’s\ndaughter, and the prince and his wife, all went to live in the King’s\npalace, and lived there happily together for ever after; and the King\nthanked God for giving him such a beautiful son, and for ridding him of\nhis four wicked wives.",
        "Katar did not return to the fairies’ country, but stayed always with\nthe young prince, and never left him.",
