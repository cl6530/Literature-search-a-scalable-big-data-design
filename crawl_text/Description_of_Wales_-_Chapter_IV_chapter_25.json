        "Their ambitious seizure of lands, and dissensions among brothers",
        "This nation is, above all others, addicted to the digging up of\nboundary ditches, removing the limits, transgressing landmarks, and\nextending their territory by every possible means.  So great is\ntheir disposition towards this common violence, that they scruple\nnot to claim as their hereditary right, those lands which are held\nunder lease, or at will, on condition of planting, or by any other\ntitle, even although indemnity had been publicly secured on oath to\nthe tenant by the lord proprietor of the soil.  Hence arise suits\nand contentions, murders and conflagrations, and frequent\nfratricides, increased, perhaps, by the ancient national custom of\nbrothers dividing their property amongst each other.  Another heavy\ngrievance also prevails; the princes entrust the education of their\nchildren to the care of the principal men of their country, each of\nwhom, after the death of his father, endeavours, by every possible\nmeans, to exalt his own charge above his neighbours.  From which\ncause great disturbances have frequently arisen amongst brothers,\nand terminated in the most cruel and unjust murders; and on which\naccount friendships are found to be more sincere between foster-\nbrothers, than between those who are connected by the natural ties\nof brotherhood.  It is also remarkable, that brothers shew more\naffection to one another when dead, than when living; for they\npersecute the living even unto death, but revenge the deceased with\nall their power.",
