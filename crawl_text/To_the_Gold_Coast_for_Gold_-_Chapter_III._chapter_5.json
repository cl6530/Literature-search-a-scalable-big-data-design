        "A FORTNIGHT AT MADEIRA.",
        "I passed Christmas week at the ’Flower of the Wavy Field;’ and, in the\nsociety of old and new friends, found nothing of that sameness and\nmonotony against which so many, myself included, have whilom\ndeclaimed. The truth is that most places breed ennui for an idle\nman. Nor is the climate of Madeira well made for sedentary purposes: it\nis apter for one who loves to flâner, or, as Victor Hugo has it,\nerrer songeant.",
        "Having once described Funchal at some length, I see no reason to repeat\nthe dose; and yet, as Miss Ellen M. Taylor’s book shows,",
        "[Footnote: Madeira: its Scenery, and how to see it. Stanford,\nLondon, 1878. This is an acceptable volume, all the handbooks being out\nof print. I reviewed it in the Academy July 22, 1882.]",
        "the subject, though old and well-worn, can still bear a successor to the\nexcellent White and Johnson handbook.",
        "[Footnote: Mr. Johnson still survives; not so the well-known Madeiran\nnames Bewick, (Sir Frederick) Pollock, and Lowe (Rev, R. T.) The latter\nwas drowned in 1873, with his wife, in the s.s. Liberia, Captain\nLowry. The steamer went down in the Bay of Biscay, it is supposed from a\ncollision. I sailed with Captain Lowry (s.s. Athenian) in January\n1863, when St. George’s steeple was rocking over Liverpool: he was\nnearly washed into the lee scuppers, and a quartermaster was swept\noverboard during a bad squall. I found him an excellent seaman, and I\ndeeply regretted his death.]",
        " As early as 1827 ’The Rambler in Madeira’ (Mr. Lyall) proclaimed the\n theme utterly threadbare, in consequence of ’every traveller opening\n his quarto (?) with a short notice of it;’ and he proceeded at once to\n indite a fair-sized octavo. Humboldt said something of the same sort in\n his ’Personal Narrative,’ and forthwith wrote the worst description of\n the capital and the ’Pike’ of Tenerife that any traveller has ever\n written of any place. He confesses to having kept a meagre diary, not\n intending to publish a mere book of travels, and drew his picture\n probably from recollection and diminutive note-books.",
        "I found Funchal open-hearted and open-handed as ever; and the pleasure\nof my stay was marred only by two considerations, both purely\npersonal. Elysian fields and green countries do not agree with all\ntemperaments. Many men are perfectly and causelessly miserable in the\ndamp heats of Western India and the Brazil. We must in their case simply\nreverse the Wordsworthian dictum,",
        "  Not melancholy–no, for it is green.",
        "They are perfectly happy in the Arabian desert, and even in Tenerife,\nwhere others feel as if living perpetually on the verge of high fever.",
        "To this ’little misery’ were added the displeasures of memory. Our last\nlong visit was in 1863, when the Conde de Farrobo ruled the land, and\nwhen the late Lord Brownlow kept open house at the beautiful Vigia. I\nneed hardly say that we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves: the impressions of\nthat good old time were deep and durable.",
        "Amongst other things, Governor Farrobo indulged his fair friends with a\ndisplay of the old jogo de canas, or running at the ring. The\nPraça Academica had been rigged out to serve as a tilting-yard, with a\ncentral alley of palisading and two ’stands,’ grand and little. The\npurpose was charitable, and the performers were circus-horses, mounted\nby professionals and amateurs, who thus ’renowned it’ before the public\nand their damas. The circlet, hanging to a line, equalled the\ndiameter of a small boy’s hat; and when the ’knight’ succeeded in\nbearing it off upon his pole, he rode up to be decorated by the hands of\na very charming person with a ribbon-baudrière of Bath dimensions\nand rainbow colours. Prizes were banal as medals after a modern war, and\nperhaps for the same purpose–to prevent unchristian envy, hatred, and\nmalice. Almost any trooper in an Anglo-Indian cavalry regiment would\nhave done better; but then he would have couched his bamboo spear\nproperly and would have put out his horse to speed–an idea which seemed\nto elude the Madeiran mind. The fête ended with a surprise less\nexpensive than that with which the Parisian restaurant astonishes the\ntravelling Britisher. A paper chandelier was suspended between two\nposts, of course to be knocked down, when out sprang an angry\nhunch-backed dwarf, who abused and fiercely struck at all straight backs\nwithin reach.",
        "Madeira is celebrated for excursions, which, however, are enjoyable only\nin finest weather. Their grand drawback is inordinate expense; you may\nvisit the whole seaboard of Morocco, and run to Tenerife and return for\nthe sum spent in a week of Madeiran travel. The following tour to the\nnorth of the island was marked out for us by the late Mr. Bewick; his\nreadiness to oblige, his extensive local knowledge, and his high\nscientific attainments caused his loss to be long felt in the Isle of\nWood. ’You make on the first day Santa Anna, on the opposite coast, a\nsix to eight hours’ stage by horse or hammock, passing through the grand\nscenery of the valleys Metade, Meiometade, and Ribeiro Frio.",
        "[Footnote: Most of these places are given in Views (26) in the\nMadeiras, &c., by the Rev. James Bulwer. London, Rivington, 1829. He\nalso wrote Rambles in Madeira and in Portugal in 1826.]",
        " The next day takes you to Pico Ruivo, Rothhorn, Puy Rouge, or Red Peak,\n the loftiest in the island, whose summit commands a view of a hundred\n hills, and you again night at Santa Anna. The third stage is to the\n rocky gorge of São Vicente, which abounds in opportunities for\n neck-breaking. The next is a long day with a necessary guide to the\n Paül da Serra, the “Marsh of the Wold,” and the night is passed at\n Seixal, on the north-west coast, famous for its corniche-road. The\n fifth day conducts you along-shore to Ponta Delgada, and the last leads\n from this “Thin Point” through the Grand Curral back to Funchal.’",
        "I mention this excursion that the traveller may carefully avoid it in\nwinter, especially when we attempted the first part, February being the\nvery worst month. After many days of glorious weather the temper of the\natmosphere gave way; the mercury fell to 28.5, and we were indulged with\na succession of squalls and storms, mists and rain. The elemental rage,\nit is true, was that of your southern coquette, sharp, but short, and\nbroken by intervals of a loving relapse into caress. In the uplands and\non the northern coast, however, it shows the concentrated spleen and\ngloom of a climate in high European latitudes.",
        "We contented ourselves with the Caminho do Meio, the highway supposed to\nbisect the island, and gradually rising to the Rocket Road (Caminho\ndo Foguete) with a pleasant slope of 23°, or 1 in 2 1/3. These roads\nare heavy on the three h’s–head, heart, and hand. We greatly enjoyed\nthe view from the famous Levada, the watercourse or leat-road of Santa\nLuzia, with its scatter of noble quintas,",
        "[Footnote: The country-house is called a quinta, or fifth,\nbecause that is the proportion of produce paid by the tenant to the\nproprietor.]",
        "St. Lucy’s, St. Anne’s, Quinta Davies, Palmeira, and Til. Nossa Senhora\ndo Monte, by Englishmen misnamed ’the Convent,’ and its break-arm\nslide-down, in basket-sleighs, is probably as well known, if not better\nknown, to the reader than St. Paul’s, City. Here we found sundry\nvotaries prostrating themselves before a dark dwarf ’Lady’ with jewelled\nhead and spangled jupe: not a few were crawling on their knees up the\ncruel cobble-stones of the mount. On the right yawned the ’Little\nCurral,’ as our countrymen call the Curral das Romeiras (of the\nPilgrimesses); it is the head of the deluging torrent-bed, João\nGomes. Well worth seeing is this broken punch-bowl, with its wild steep\ngap; and, if the traveller want a vertiginous walk, let him wend his way\nalong the mid-height of the huge tongue which protrudes itself from the\ngorge to the valley-mouth.",
        "Near the refuge-house called the Poizo, some 4,500 feet above sea-level,\na road to the right led us to Comacha, where stood Mr. Edward Hollway’s\nsummer quinta. It occupies a ridge-crest of a transverse rib\nprojected southerly, or seawards, from the central range which, trending\neast-west, forms the island dorsum. Hence its temperature is 60° (F.)\nwhen the conservatory upon the bay shows 72°. Below it, 1,800 feet high,\nand three miles north-east of the city, lies the Palheiro do Ferreiro\n(’blacksmith’s straw-hut’), the property of the once wealthy Carvalhal\nhouse. The name of these ’Lords of the Oak-ground’ is locally\nfamous. Chronicles mention a certain Count Antonio who flourished, or\nrather ’larked,’ circa A.D. 1500. In those days the land bore giants and\nheroes, and Madeiran blood had not been polluted by extensive\nmiscegenation with the negro. Anthony, who was feller than More of More\nHall, rode with ungirthed saddle over the most dangerous achadas\n(ledges); a single buffet of this furious knight smashed a wild boar,\nand he could lift his horse one palm off the ground by holding to a tree\nbranch. The estate has been wilfully wasted by certain of his\ndescendants. Comacha, famous for picnics, is a hamlet rich in seclusion\nand fine air; it might be utilised by those who, like the novel-heroes\nof Thackeray and Bulwer, deliberately sit down to vent themselves in a\nbook.",
        "Pico Ruivo was a distressing failure. We saw nothing save a Scotch mist,\nwhich wetted us to the bones; and we shivered standing in a slush of\nsnow which would have been quite at home in Upper Norwood. On this\ntopmost peak were found roots of the Madeiran cedar (Juniperus\nOxycedrus), showing that at one time the whole island was well\nwooded.",
        "We need not believe in the seven years’ fire; but the contrast of the\nsouthern coast with the northern, where the forests primaeval of\nLauraceae and Myrtaceae still linger, shows the same destructive process\nwhich injured Ireland and ruined Iceland. The peculiarity of these\nuplands, within certain limits, is that the young spring-verdure clothes\nthem before it appears in the lower and warmer levels. Here they catch a\nsunshine untarnished by watery vapour.",
        "During our short trip and others subsequent many a little village showed\nus the Madeiran peasant pure and simple. Both sexes are distressingly\nplain; I saw only one pretty girl amongst them. Froggy faces, dark\nskins, and wiry hair are the rule; the reason being that in the good old\ndays a gentleman would own some eighty slaves. [Footnote: As early as\n1552 the total of African imports amounted to 2,700.] But they are an\nindustrious and reproductive race.",
        "[Footnote: The following note of the census of 1878 was given to me by\nmy kind colleague, Mr. Consul Hayward:–",
        "Miss Taylor (Madeira, p. 58) reduces to 33,000–evidently a\nmisprint–this population about four times as dense as that of\nPortugal.]",
        "Many Madeirans highly distinguished themselves in the Dutch-Brazilian\nwars, especially the ’Castriota Lusitano.’ His name is unknown; he\nchanged it when he left his islet home, the townlet Santa Cruz. These\nislanders were the model ’navvies’ of the age before steam: Albuquerque\napplied for Madeirans when he formed the barbarous project of diverting\nthe Nile to the Red Sea. Their descendants are beggars from the cradle;\nbut they beg with a good grace, and not with a curse or an insult like\nthe European ’asker’ when refused: moreover, the mendicant pest is not\nnow over-prevalent. In the towns they cheat and pilfer; they gamble in\nthe streets; they drink hard on Saturdays and Sundays, and at times they\nmurder one another. Liquor is cheap; a bottle of aguardente or\ncaxaça (new raw rum) costs only fivepence, and the second\ndistillation ninepence. I heard of one assault upon an English girl, but\nstrangers are mostly safe amongst them. Their extreme civility,\ndocility, and good temper, except when spoilt by foreigners, makes it a\npleasure to deal with them. They touch their hats with a frank smile,\nnot the Spanish scowl near Gibraltar, or of Santa Cruz, Tenerife. The\nmen are comparatively noiseless; a bawling voice startles you like a\npistol-shot. I rarely heard a crying child or a scolding woman offering\n’eau bénite à la Xantippe;’ even the cocks and hens tied to old shoes\ncackle with reserve. The climate tames everything from Dom to\ndonkey. Except in January and February it is still, intensely still–the\nvery leaves seem to hang motionless. This softness shows itself\nespecially in the language, which has none of the abruptness of European\nPortuguese. The sound is a drawling singsong; the articulation is\npeculiar, and the vocabulary is in some points confined to the Island.",
        "The country people, an active, agile, unmuscular race, mostly preserve\nthe old national dress. Some men still wear, and both sexes once wore,\nthe ridiculous carapuça, or funnel-cap with a rat-tail for a\ntassel. The rest of the toilet consists of homespun cottons, shirts and\nknickerbockers, with buff shoes or boots broad-soled and heelless. The\ntraveller who prefers walking should always use this chaussure,\nand the ’little girl in topboots’ is still a standing joke. The women\naffect parti-coloured petticoats of home-made baize or woollen stuff,\ndyed blue, scarlet, brown, or orange; a scalloped cape of the same\nmaterial bound with some contrasting hue; and a white or coloured\nhead-kerchief, sometimes topped by the carapuça, but rarely by\nthe vulgar ’billycock’ of the Canaries. In the villages crimson shawls\nand capes are general, and they cover the head like mantillas.",
        "The peasant’s cot is of the simplest, and those in the plantations\nsuggest African huts. Even the best houses, except when copied from the\nEnglish, are scantily furnished; and little beyond a roof is absolutely\nwanted. The home of the cazeiro, or peasant tenant practically\nirremovable, is whitewashed and thatched, the straw forming a crest\nalong the ridge. It covers only one room, converted by a curtain into\n’but’ and ’ben.’ A parental bed, a rickety table, and two or three\nstools or settles compose the necessaries; the ornaments are the saints\nhanging to the walls, and for windows there are shutters with a sliding\npanel. The feeding apparatus consists of a kind of quern for grinding\ncorn, especially maize,",
        "[Foonote: The word is of doubtful origin, generally derived from the\nHaytian mahiz. But in northern Europe mayse (Irish maise)\nbread, and the Old High German maz (Hind. mans) means meat]",
        "which, however, is now too dear for general use; sundry vegetable\nbaskets, and an iron pot for boiling fish and porridge, arums\n(Inhame), and koko (Colocasia esculenta). They have some\npeculiar dishes, such as the bolo de mel, a ginger cake eaten at\nChristmas, and the famous carne de vinho e alhos (meat of wine\nand garlic). The latter is made by marinating pork in vinegar with\ngarlic and the herb called oragão (origanum, or wild marjoram);\nit is eaten broiled, and even Englishmen learn to appreciate a dish\nwhich is said to conversar. The stewed fowl with rice is also\nnational. As everywhere in Portugal, bacalháo,",
        "[Footnote: Brevoort derives the word from baculus, the stick\nwhich keeps the fish open; others from the German boloh, fish. In\n1498 Seb. Cabot speaks of ’great fishes which the natives call\nBaccalaos.’ He thus makes the word ’Indian;’ whereas Dr. Kohl, when\nnoticing the cod-fisheries of Europe, declares that in Germany it is\nBackljau. Mr. O. Crawford (Portugal, Old and New. London:\nC. Kegan Paul, 1880) rightly notes that ’bacalháo’ applies equally to\nthe fresh fish and the dried fish.]",
        "or dried cod-fish, cooked with garlic or onions, is deservedly a\nfavourite: it contains more nourishment than beef. There is superior\noriginality amongst the doces (sweetmeats) for which Madeira was\nonce world-famous; and in the queques (cakes), such as\nlagrimas-cakes, cocoanut-cakes, and rabanadas, the Moorish\n’rabanat,’ slabs of wheat bread soaked in milk, fried in olive oil, and\nspread with honey. The drink is water, or, at best, agua-pé, the\nlast straining of the grape. Many peasants, who use no stimulant during\nthe day, will drink on first rising a dram para espantar o Diabo\n(to frighten the Devil), as do the Congoese paramatar o bicho (to\nkill the worm).",
        "Here cleanliness is not next to godliness. People bathe only in\nhot weather–the rule of man and the lower mammalia. A quick and\nintelligent race they are, like the Spaniards and Bedawi Arabs, a\ncontradiction in religious matters: the Madeiran believes in little or\nnothing, yet he hates a Calvinista like the very fiend. They have\nlost, as the census shows, something of their extreme ignorance, and\nhave abated their worst superstitions since the expulsion of the Jesuits\nby Pombal (1759), and the reforms of 1820, 1828, and 1835. In the latter\nyear Dom Pedro suppressed monkeries and nunneries by disallowing masses,\nand by pensioning the holy tenantry with 9 dols. per mensem, afterwards,\nreduced to 5 dols. In 1863 the bishop, Dom Patricio Xavier de Moura, did\nhis best to abolish the pretty refocaria (the hearth-lighter),\nwho, as Griraldus hath it, extinguished more virtue than she lit fires;\nand now the rectory is seldom gladdened by the presence of noisy little\nnephews and nieces. The popular morals, using the word in its limited\nsense, were peculiar. The number of espostos que não se sabe quem,\nsão seus pais (fatherless foundlings) outnumbered those born de\nlegitimo matrimonio; and few of the gudewives prided themselves upon\nabsolute fidelity. This flaw, which in England would poison all domestic\naffection, was not looked upon in a serious light by the islandry. The\npriesthood used to lament the degeneracy of the age and sigh for the\nfine times of foros e fogos, the rights and fires of an\nauto-da-fé. The shepherds have now learned to move with the times\nand to secure the respect of their sheep. Imagine being directed to\nParadise by a reverend man who gravely asks you where and what Hanover\nis.",
        "Another important change is being brought about by the emigrant. During\nthe last few years the old rule has been relaxed, and whole families\nhave wandered abroad in search of fortune. Few Madeirans in these days\nship for the Brazil, once the land of their predilection. They prefer\nCape Town, Honolulu, the Antilles, and especially Demerara; and now the\n’Demerarista’ holds the position of the ’Brasileiro’ in Portugal and the\n’Indio’ or ’Indiano’ of the Canaries: in time he will buy up half the\nisland.",
        "In 1862 we hired rowing and sailing boats to visit the southern coast\neast and west of Funchal. For the last twelvemonth Mr. Blandy’s\nsteam-tug Falcão has carried travellers to and fro: it is a great\nconvenience to the lazy sightseer, who cares only to view the outside of\nthings, and here the outsides are the only things worth viewing.",
        "We will begin with the western trip to Paül do Mar, affording a grand\nprospect of basaltic pillars and geological dykes, and of the three\nfeatures–rocky, sylvan, and floral. Steaming by the mouth of the wady\nor ravine Sao João, whose decayed toy forts, S. Lazaro and the\npalace-battery, are still cumbered with rusty cannon, we pass under the\ncliff upon whose brow stand some of the best buildings. These are the\nPrincess Dona Maria Amelia’s Hospicio, or Consumptive Hospital,\nbuilt on Mr. Lamb’s plans and now under management of the French\nsoeurs, whose gull wings are conspicuous at Funchal; the Asylo,\nor Poor-house, opened in 1847 for the tempering of mendicancy; and\nfacing it, in unpleasant proximity, the Portuguese cemetery, decorated\nas to its entrance with sundry skulls and cross-bones, and showing its\ntall cypresses to the bay. Here comes the Quinta (Comtesse) Lambert,\nonce occupied by Queen Adelaide. The owner doubled the rent;\nconsequently Las Angustías (the Agonies), as it was called from\nan old chapel, has been unrented for the last two years. A small\npleasaunce overhanging a perpendicular cliff, and commanding a glorious\nview, shows the Quinta da Vigia, lately bought by Mr. Hollway for\n8,000l., and let at 500l. to 1,000l, a year. Nothing more\ncharming than its grounds, which attracted H.I.M. of Austria, and\nnow the charming Countess Tyszkiewicz. Landward it faces the Rua\nda Imperatriz, which leads to the ’Loo Fields.’",
        "The study of basaltic pillars at once begins: Loo Fort is partly built\nupon them. Beyond Vigia cliff we pass in succession three jagged\nisland-rocks, called ’gurgulhos,’ or black-beetles (curculio),\nwhich, like the opposite foreshore, admirably show the formation. As a\nrule the columns are quadrangular; I saw but few pentagons and\nhexagons. We cast a look at a spouter of circular shape, the Forja, and\nthe Forno, a funnel-formed blowing-rock. The cliff is pierced with a\nmultitude of caves, large and small, and their regular arches look as if\nthe ejected matter, as happens with lava, had cooled and solidified\nabove, while still flowing out in a fiery torrent below. Mostly,\nhowever, they are the work of wind and water.",
        "Then comes the old Gurgulho Fort–a dwarf square, partly thatched and\nconverted into a private dwelling. It lies below Signal Hill, with its\ndwarf ruined tower, a lumpy parasitic crater whose western slopes have\nbeen ruined by disforesting. Between the two runs the New Road, which\nowes its being to the grape-famine of 1852. It is the ’Rotten Row’ of\nFunchal, where horses tread the earth instead of skating and sliding\nover the greased pebbles; and where fair amazons charge upon you like\nIndian irregular cavalry. Five miles long, it is the only level line of\nany extent in Madeira, and it wants but one thing–prolongation. The\nlion in the path, however, is Cape Girâo, which would cost a treasure to\n’tunnel’ or to cut into a corniche.",
        "The next feature is the Ponta da Cruz, a fantastic slice of detached\nbasalt. Here, at the southernmost point of the island, the Descobridores\nplanted a cross, and every boatman doffs his cap to its little iron\ndescendant. Beyond it comes the Praia Formosa, a long line of shingle\nwashed down by a deep ravine. All these brooks have the same origin, and\ntheir extent increases the importance of the wady. In 1566 the French\npirates under De Montluc, miscalled heretics (hereges Ugnotas)\nlanded here, as, indeed, every enemy should. The colour of ’Fair Reach’\nis ashen grey, scolloped with cinder-black where the creamy foam breaks:\nfor beauty it wants only golden sands, and for use a few bathing\nmachines.",
        "The next notable feature is the Ribeira dos Soccorridos (’River of the\nRescued’), where two of the Zargo’s lads were with difficulty saved from\nthe violent stream then flowing. It is now provided with a long\nbridge-causeway of three arches, approached by a chapel, Nossa Senhora\ndas Victorias, whose tiled and pillared porch reminds one of\nIstria. This bed is the drain of the Grand Curral, called by the people\n’Das Freiras,’ because the holy women here took refuge from the\nplundering French ’Lutherans.’ The favourite picnic-ground is reached in\nthree hours from Funchal by two roads, both winding amongst the\npap-shaped hillocks which denote parasitic cones, and both abutting upon\nthe ravine-side, east and west. The latter, skirting the Pico dos Bodes\n(of he-goats), a tall cone seen from near Funchal, and sentinelling the\ngreat gap, is the joy-for-ever of midshipmites. To the horror of the\nburriqueiro, or syce, they gallop hired screws, high-heeled as their\ngrandams, over paths at which an English stag would look twice; and for\na dollar they secure as much chance of a broken limb, if not of ’going\nto pot with a young lady’ (Captain Basil Hall’s phrase), as reasonable\nbeings can expect.",
        "The Grand Curral is the central vent of a volcano originally submarine,\nand, like the Peak of Tenerife, of the age miocene. Fossils of that\nepoch have been found upon the crater-walls of both. Subsequent\nmovements capped it with subaerial lavas and conglomerates; and wind and\nweather, causing constant degradation, deepened the bowl and almost\nobliterated signs of igneous action. This is general throughout Madeira;\nthe only craters still noticed by guide-books are the Lagos (Lake) de\nSanto Antonio da Serra, east of Funchal and west of Machico, 500 feet\nacross by 150 deep; and, secondly, the Fanal to the north-west, about\n5,000 feet above sea-level. The Curral floor, smooth and bald, is cut by\na silvery line of unsunned rivulet which at times must swell to a\ntorrent; and little white cots like egg-shells are scattered around the\nnormal parish-church, Nossa Senhora do Livramento. The basin-walls, some\n2,000 feet high and pinnacled by the loftiest peaks in the island, are\nprofusely dyked and thickly and darkly forested; and in the bright blue\nair, flecked with woolpack, Manta, the buzzard, and frequent kestrels\npass to and fro like flies.",
        "Beyond the Soccorridos lies the charming valley of Camara dos Lobos,\npopularly Cama di Lobos,",
        "[Footnote: It is placed west instead of east of Cape Girao in the\nConoise Handbook of Madeira, by the Rev. J. M. Rendell. London:\nKegan Paul and Co., 1881.]",
        "the lair of the sea-wolves, or seals. With its vivid lines of\nsugar-cane, its terraces, its fine remains of forest vegetation, and its\ndistances of golden lights, of glazed blue half-lights, and of purple\nshades, it looks like a stage-rake, a décor de théatre.\nTunny-fishing, wine-making, and sugar-boiling have made it,\nfrom a ’miserable place,’ a wealthy townlet whose tall white houses\nwould not disgrace a city; two manufactories show their craft by heaps\nof bagasse, or trash; and the deep shingly bay, defended by a\ngurgulho of basaltic pillars, is covered with piscator’s gear and\nwith gaily painted green boats. ’Seal’s Lair’ was the model district of\nwine-production, like its neighbour on the north-western upland,\nCampanario, famous for its huge Spanish chestnut: both were, however,\nwasted by the oidium of 1852. In 1863 it partially recovered, under the\nfree use of sulphur; but now it has been ravaged by the more dangerous\nphylloxera, which is spreading far faster than Mr. Henry Vizetelly\nsupposes.",
        "[Footnote: Facts about Port and Madeira, by Henry Vizetelly, who\nvisited the island in 1877. The papers first appeared in the (old\noriginal) Pall Mall Gazette (August 26-September 4,1877), and then were\npublished in a volume by Ward and Lock, 1880]",
        "The only cure of this pest known to Madeira is the troublesome and\nexpensive process practised by a veteran oenologist, Mr. Leacock.",
        "He bares every vine-root, paints it with turpentine and resin, and\ncarefully manures the plant to restore its stamina. Mr. Taylor, of\nFunchal, has successfully defended the vines about his town-house by the\nsimple tonic of compost. But the Lobos people have, methinks, done\nwisely to uproot the infected plant wholesale: indeed, from this point\nto the furthest west we hardly saw a vine-stock. They have supplied its\nplace with garden-stuff, an article which always finds a ready sale. The\nisland is annually visited by at least 500 English ships, and there is a\nsteady demand for ’green meat.’ I am not aware that beet-root, one of\nthe best antiscorbutics, has been extensively tried.",
        "Off Cama di Lobos is the best tunny-fishing. It is practised quite\ndifferently from the Mediterranean style; here the labyrinth of nets is\nsupplanted by the line of 300 fathoms. At night the bright fires on\nboard the fishing-canoes make travellers suspect that spears, grains, or\nharpoons are used. This, however, is not the case; line-fishing is\nuniversal, and the lights serve mostly for signals.",
        "From Cama di Lobos the huge hill-shoulder to the west, whose face, Cabo\nGirão, must be ascended by a rough, steep incline. Far easier to view\nthe scene from a boat. Cape ’Turn Again’ is the furthest occidental\npoint reached by the far-famed exploration of O Zargo. The profile\nsuggests it to be the northern half of a dome once regular and complete,\nbut cut in two, as a cake might be, by time and the elements. It has the\nname of being the ’highest sea-wall in the world’ (1,934 feet); if so,\nlittle Madeira can boast her ’unicum.’  Beaching the summit, you either\nstand up regardant or you peer couchant, as your nerves incline, down a\nheight whose merit is to be peculiarly high. Facetious picnickers roll\nover the edge-rocks which may kill the unfortunates gathering\ngrass–dreadful trade!–upon the dizzy ledges. There are also quarrymen\nwho extract cantaria-slabs for sills and copings from the four\nsquare apertures which look afar like mortice-holes; and a fine marbled\nstone, white, blue, and ruddy, has been taken from this part of the\ncliff-face. Finally, there is a little knot of tiny huts which sticks\nlike a wasp-nest to the very foot of the huge wall.",
        "Seen from the deep indigo-blue water, that turns leek-green in the\nshallows, Cape Girão (’they turn’) is a grand study of volcanic\ndykes. They are of all sizes, from a rope to a cable multiplied a\nthousandfold; and they stand out in boldest dado-relief where the soft\nbackground of tufa, or laterite, has been crumbled away by rain and\nstorm-blast. Some writers have described them as ramifying like a tree\nand its branches, and crossing and interlacing like the ties of a\nbuilding; as if sundry volcanic vents had a common centre below. I saw\nnothing of this kind. The dykes of light grey material, sometimes\nhollowed out and converted into gutters by falling water, appeared to\nhave been shot up in distinct lines, and the only crossing was where a\nslip or a fault occurred.",
        "A front view of Cape Girão shows that it is supported on either side,\neast and west, by buttresses of a darker rock: the eastern dip at an\nangle of 45°, the western range between 20° above and 40° below. The\ngreat central upheaval seems to have pushed its way through these older\nstrata, once straight, now inclined. The layers of the more modern\nformation–lavas and scoriae–are horizontal; sheets of sub-columnar,\ncompact basalt have been spread upon and have crushed down to\npaper-thickness their beds of bright red tufa, here and there white with\na saline effervescence. Of such distinct superimpositions we counted in\none place five; there may have been many more. All are altered soils, as\nis shown by remains of trees and decayed vegetation.",
        "Beyond Cabo Girão the scenery is grand enough, but monotonous in the\nextreme. The island is girt by a sea-wall, more or less perpendicular;\nfrom this coping there is a gentle upslope, the marvellous terracing for\ncultivation being carried up to the mountain-tops. The lower levels are\neverywhere dotted with white farmhouses and brown villages. The colours\nof the wall are the grey of basalt, the purple of volcanic\nconglomerates, and the bright reds and yellows of tufas. Here and there,\nhowever, a thread of water pouring from the summit, or bursting from the\nflank, fills a cavity which it has worn and turned for itself; and from\nthis reservoir the industrious peasant has diverted sufficient to\nirrigate his dwarf terraced plots of cane, bananas, yams, or other\nvegetables; not a drop of the precious fluid is wasted, and beds are\nlaid out wherever the vivifying influence can extend. The water-race\ndown the wall is shown by mosses and lichens, pellitories, and\nrock-plants; curtains and hangers; slides, shrubs, and weepers of the\nmost vivid green, which give life and beauty to the sternest stone.",
        "The only breaks in this regular coast-wall are the spines and spurs\nprotruding seawards; the caverns in which the surges break and roar, and\nthe ribeiras or ravines whose heads are far inland, and whose\nlines show grey second distances and blue third distances. At their\nmouths lie the sea-beaches and the settlements: the latter, with their\ntowered churches and their large whitewashed houses, look more like\ndetached bits of city than our notion of villages. Other places are\nbuilt upon heaps of débris washed down from the heights, which\nhold out no promise of not falling again. The huts scattered amidst the\ncultivation remind one of nothing but Africa. In some places, too, a\nsoft layer of tufa has been hollowed for man’s abode, suggesting, like\nthe caves, a fine old smuggling-trade. As many as eight doors may be\ncounted side by side. In other places a rock-ledge, or even a detached\nboulder, has been converted into a house by masonry-walls. We shall\nseldom see these savageries on the eastern coast of the island.",
        "The seafaring settlements are connected with the interior by breakneck\npaths and by rude steps, slippery with green moss. The people seem to\ndelight in standing, like wild goats, upon the dizziest of ’jumpy’\npeaks; we see boys perched like birds upon impossible places, and men\nwalking along precipice-faces apparently pathless. The villages are\njoined to one another by roads which attempt to follow the sea-line; the\nchasms are spanned by the flimsiest wooden bridges, and the cliff is\ntunnelled or cut into a corniche.",
        "After disembarking passengers at Ponta d’Agua and Ribeira Nova we passed\nthe great landslip of 1805, Lugar do Baixo. The heap of ruins has long\nbeen greened over. The cause was evidently a waterfall which now\ndescends freely; it must have undermined the cliff, which in time would\ngive way. So in the Brazil they use water instead of blasting powder: a\ntrench is dug behind the slice of highland to be removed; this is filled\nby the rains and the pressure of the column throws the rock bodily\ndown. We shall find this cheap contrivance useful when ’hydraulicking’\nthe auriferous clays of the Gold Coast.",
        "Then we came to Ponta do Sol, the only remarkable site on the trip,\nfamous for bodice-making and infamous for elephantiasis. Here a huge\ncolumn of curiously contorted basalt has been connected by a solid\nhigh-arched causeway with the cliff, which is equally remarkable,\nshowing a central boss of stone with lines radiating quaquaversally.\nThere are outer steps and an inner flight leading under\na blind archway, the latter supplied with a crane. The landing in the\nlevadia, or surf, is abominable and a life-boat waits accidents\noutside. It works with the heavy Madeiran oars, square near the grip and\nprovided with a board into whose hole the pin fits. The townlet, capital\nof the ’comarca,’ fronted by its little Alameda and a strip of beach\nupon which I should prefer to debark, shows a tall factory-chimney,\nnoting the sugar-works of Wilhabram Bros. There is a still larger\nestablishment at the Serra d’Agoa in the Arco [Footnote: Arco\n(bow, arch) is locally applied to a ridge or to the district bounded by\nit.] da Calheta (Arch of the Creeklet), a property of the Visconde de\nCalçada. The guide-books mention iron pyrites and specular iron in small\nquantities behind Ponta do Sol.",
        "Passing the deep ravine, Ribeiro Fundo, and the Ponta da Galéra, with\nits rooky spur, we sighted Jardim do Mar, a village on a mound of\ndébris with black walls of dry stone defending the terraces from\nsurf and spray. The furthest point, where we halted half an hour, is\n’Paül do Mar’ (Swamp of the Sea), apparently a misnomer. It is the port\nof the Fajãa da Ovelha (Ewe’s landslip), whose white tenements we see\nperched on the estreito, or tall horizon-slope. The large\nharbour-town is backed by a waterfall which may prove disastrous to it;\nits lands were formerly famous for the high-priced malvasia\nCandida–Candia malmsey.",
        "The day had been delightful, ’June weather’ in fickle April. The sea was\nsmooth as glass, and the skies, sunny in the morning and starry at\nnight, were canopied during the day by clouds banking up from the\nsouth-east. The western wind blew crisp and cold. This phase of climate\noften lasts till the end of June, and renders early summer endurable at\nMadeira. The steam-tug was more punctual going than coming. She left\nFunchal at 9 A.M., reached Paül do Mar at half-past twelve, covering\nsome twenty-one direct knots; and returned to her moorings, crowded with\npassengers, at half-past five, instead of half-past four. My companion,\nM. Dahse, and I agreed that the coast was well worth seeing.",
        "It would hardly be fair to leave Madeira without a visit to Machico, the\nscene of Machim’s apocryphal death. The realists derive the name from\nAlgarvan Monchique. I have made it on foot, on horseback, and by boat,\nbut never so comfortably as when on board the steam-tug\nFalcão. Garajáo, whose ruddy rocks of volcanic tufa, embedding\nbits of lava, probably entitled it ’Brazenhead,’ is worth inspecting\nfrom the sea. Possibly the classic term ’Purple Islands’ may have arisen\nfrom the fiery red hue of the volcanic cliffs seen at the sunset\nhour. Like Girão, the middle block of Tern Point is horizontally\nstratified, while the western abutment slopes to the water. Eastward,\nhowever, there has been immense degradation; half the dome has been\nshaken down and washed away; while a succession of upheavals and\nearthquakes has contorted the strata in the strangest manner. Seen from\nFunchal, the profile of Garajáo is that of an elephant’s head, the\nmahaut sitting behind it in the shape of a red-brown boss, the expanded\nhead of a double dyke seaming the tufas of the eastern face. We\ndistinguish on the brow two ’dragons,’ puny descendants of the\naboriginal monsters. Beyond Garajáo the shore falls flat, and the upland\nsoil is red as that of Devonshire. It is broken by the Ponta da\nOliveira, where there is ne’er an olive-tree, and by the grim ravine of\nPorto de Caniço o Bispo, the ’bishop’ being a basaltic pillar with mitre\nand pontifical robes sitting in a cave of the same material. I find a\nbetter episkopos at Ponta da Atalaia, ’Sentinel Point.’ Head,\nprofile, and shoulders are well defined; the hands rest upon the knees,\nand the plaited folds of the dress are well expressed by the basaltic\ncolumns of the central upheaval. Beyond Porto Novo do Cal, with its old\nfort and its limekiln, is the chapel of São Pedro, famous for its\nromeiro, ’pattern’ or pilgrimage for St. Peter’s Day. June 29 is\nkept even at Funchal by water-excursions; it is homage enough to pay a\npenny and to go round the ships.",
        "We anchored and screamed abominably off Santa Cruz, the capital of its\n’comarca.’ The townlet lies on the left of a large ravine, whose upper\nbed contains the Madre d’Agoa, or water-reservoir. The settlement,\nfronted by its line of trees, the Alameda, and by its broad beach\nstrewed with boats, consists of white, red, and yellow houses, one-,\ntwo-, and three-storied; of a white-steepled church and of a new\nmarket-place. East of it, and facing south, lies the large house of ’the\nSquire’ (Mr. H. B. Blandy), a villa whose feet are washed by the waves;\nthe garden shows the lovely union, here common, of pine and palm. The\nlatter, however, promises much and performs little, refusing, like the\nolive, to bear ripe fruit. Beyond the Squire’s is the hotel, approached\nby a shady avenue: it is the most comfortable in the island after the\nfour of Funchal.",
        "[Footnote: There are only two other country inns, both on the northern\ncoast. The first is at Santa Anna, some 20 miles north-north-east of the\ncapital; the second at São Vicente, to the north-west. All three are\nkept by natives of Madeira. Unless you write to warn the owners that you\nare coming, the first will be a ’banyan-day,’ the second comfortable\nenough. This must be expected; it is the Istrian ’Città Nuova, chi porta\ntrova.’]",
        "Santa Cruz has a regular spring-season; and the few residents of the\ncapital frequent it to enjoy the sea-breeze, which to-day (April 23)\nblows a trifle too fresh.",
        "We then pass the Ponta da Queimada, whose layers of basalt are deeply\ncaverned, and we open the Bay of Machico. The site, a broad, green and\nriant valley, with a high background, is softer and gayer than that of\nFunchal. It has been well sketched in ’Views in the Madeiras,’ and by\nthe Norwegian artist Johan F. Eckersberg in folio, with letterpress by\nMr. Johnson of the guide-book. The ’Falcon’ anchors close to the\nlanding-stairs, under a grim, grey old fort, O Desembarcadouro,\noriginally a tower, and now apparently a dwelling-place. The\ndébarcadère has the usual lamp and the three iron chains intended\nto prevent accidents.",
        "The prosperous little fishing-village, formerly the capital of\nthe Tristam, lies as usual upon a wady, the S. Gonsales, and\nconsists of a beach, an Alameda, a church with a square tower, and some\ngood houses. Twenty years ago the people had almost forgotten a story\nwhich named the settlement; and the impromptu cicerone carried strangers\nwho sought the scene of Machim’s death to the Quinta de Santa Anna,",
        "[Footnote: Here Mr. White made some of his meteorological\nobservations. VOL. I.]",
        "well situated upon a land-tongue up the valley; to the parish church,\nwhich was in a state of chronic repair, and in fact to every place but\nthe right. The latter is now supposed to be the little Ermida\n(chapel) de N. S. da Visitação. with its long steps and\nwall-belfry on the beach and the left jaw of the wady: it is a mere\nhumbug, for the original building was washed away by the flood of\n1803. In those days, too, visitors vainly asked for the ’remains of\nMachim’s cross, collected and deposited here by Robert Page, 1825.’  Now\na piece of it is shown in frame. About 1863 I was told that a member of\nthe family, whose name, it is said, still survives about Bristol, wished\nto mark the site by a monument–decidedly encouraging to\nGretna-Greenism.",
        "From Machico Bay we see the Fora and other eastern outliers which form\nthe Madeiran hatchet-handle. Some enthusiasts prolong the trip to what\nis called the ’Fossil-bed,’ whose mere agglomerations of calcareous\nmatter are not fossils at all. The sail, however, gives fine views of\nthe ’Deserters’ (Desertas), beginning with the ’Ship Rock,’ a\nstack or needle mistaken in fogs for a craft under sail. Next to it lies\nthe Ilheu Chão, the Northern or Table Deserta, not unlike Alderney or a\nPérigord pie. Deserta Grande has midway precipices 2,000 feet high,\nbisected by a lateral valley, where the chief landing is. Finally, Cu de\nBugio (as Cordeyro terms it) is in plan a long thin strip, and in\nelevation a miniature of its big brother, with the additions of sundry\njags and peaks.",
        "The group is too windy for cereals, but it grows spontaneously orchil\nand barilla (Mesembryanthemum nodiflorum), burnt for soda. Few\nstrangers visit it, and many old residents have never attempted the\nexcursion. It is not, however, unknown to sportsmen, who land–with\nleave–upon the main island and shoot the handsome ’Deserta petrels,’\nthe cagarras (Puffinus major, or sheerwater), the rabbits,\nthe goats that have now run wild, and possibly a seal. A poisonous\nspider is here noticed by the guide-books, and the sea supplies the\nedible pulvo (octopus) and the dreaded urgamanta. This\nhuge ray (?) enwraps the swimmer in its mighty double flaps and drags\nhim to the bottom, paralysing him by the wet shroud and the dreadful\nstare of its hideous eyes.",
