        "PREFACE",
        "I am unwilling to present this narrative to the public without a\nfew words in explanation of my reasons for publishing it.  Since\nMr. Cooper’s Pilot and Red Rover, there have been so many stories\nof sea-life written, that I should really think it unjustifiable\nin me to add one to the number without being able to give reasons\nin some measure warranting me in so doing.",
        "With the single exception, as I am quite confident, of Mr. Ames’s\nentertaining, but hasty and desultory work, called “Mariner’s Sketches,\"\nall the books professing to give life at sea have been written by persons\nwho have gained their experience as naval officers, or passengers,\nand of these, there are very few which are intended to be taken as\nnarratives of facts.",
        "Now, in the first place, the whole course of life, and daily duties,\nthe discipline, habits and customs of a man-of-war are very different\nfrom those of the merchant service; and in the next place, however\nentertaining and well written these books may be, and however accurately\nthey may give sea-life as it appears to their authors, it must still be\nplain to every one that a naval officer, who goes to sea as a gentleman,\n“with his gloves on,” (as the phrase is,) and who associated only with\nhis fellow-officers, and hardly speaks to a sailor except through a\nboatswain’s mate, must take a very different view of the whole matter\nfrom that which would be taken by a common sailor.",
        "Besides the interest which every one must feel in exhibitions of\nlife in those forms in which he himself has never experienced it;\nthere has been, of late years, a great deal of attention directed\ntoward common seamen, and a strong sympathy awakened in their behalf.\nYet I believe that, with the single exception which I have mentioned,\nthere has not been a book written, professing to give their life and\nexperiences, by one who has been of them, and can know what their\nlife really is.  A voice from the forecastle has hardly yet been\nheard.",
        "In the following pages I design to give an accurate and authentic\nnarrative of a little more than two years spent as a common sailor,\nbefore the mast, in the American merchant service.  It is written\nout from a journal which I kept at the time, and from notes which\nI made of most of the events as they happened; and in it I have\nadhered closely to fact in every particular, and endeavored to give\neach thing its true character.  In so doing, I have been obliged\noccasionally to use strong and coarse expressions, and in some\ninstances to give scenes which may be painful to nice feelings;\nbut I have very carefully avoided doing so, whenever I have not\nfelt them essential to giving the true character of a scene.\nMy design is, and it is this which has induced me to publish the\nbook, to present the life of a common sailor at sea as it really\nis,–the light and the dark together.",
        "There may be in some parts a good deal that is unintelligible to\nthe general reader; but I have found from my own experience, and\nfrom what I have heard from others, that plain matters of fact in\nrelation to customs and habits of life new to us, and descriptions\nof life under new aspects, act upon the inexperienced through the\nimagination, so that we are hardly aware of our want of technical\nknowledge.  Thousands read the escape of the American frigate\nthrough the British channel, and the chase and wreck of the Bristol\ntrader in the Red Rover, and follow the minute nautical manoeuvres\nwith breathless interest, who do not know the name of a rope in the\nship; and perhaps with none the less admiration and enthusiasm for\ntheir want of acquaintance with the professional detail.",
        "In preparing this narrative I have carefully avoided incorporating\ninto it any impressions but those made upon me by the events as\nthey occurred, leaving to my concluding chapter, to which I shall\nrespectfully call the reader’s attention, those views which have\nbeen suggested to me by subsequent reflection.",
        "These reasons, and the advice of a few friends, have led me to give this\nnarrative to the press.  If it shall interest the general reader, and\ncall more attention to the welfare of seamen, or give any information\nas to their real condition, which may serve to raise them in the rank\nof beings, and to promote in any measure their religious and moral\nimprovement, and diminish the hardships of their daily life, the end\nof its publication will be answered.",
