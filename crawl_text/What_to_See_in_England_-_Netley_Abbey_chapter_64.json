        "Netley is a small village on Southampton Water, about 3 miles south-east\nof the town of Southampton. It is famous for the ruins of Netley Abbey,\nwhich are not far from the shore, in a wooded and picturesque nook. The\nabbey is supposed to have been founded by Peter des Roches, Bishop of\nWinchester in Henry III.’s reign, and the monks belonged to the\nCistercian order. It was neither a rich nor famous establishment, and\nthe monks possessed but one book, Cicero’s Treaty on Rhetoric. Since\nthe Dissolution the abbey has belonged to many different families. Only\nthe walls are now standing, but enough remains to show how beautiful it\nonce was. The buildings formed a square of which the south wall of the\nchurch formed the side opposite the entrance. Various buildings in\nconnection with the monastery formed the rest of the quadrangle, which\nwas known as Fountain Court. The kitchen is still roofed in, although it\nhas lost its stone groining. Other buildings are, conjecturally, the\nbuttery and the refectory. Near the kitchen is a curious underground\npassage leading to the castle (erected by Henry VIII.), which stands\nnearer the shore than the abbey. It is thought to be a drain.",
        "The church is of cruciform shape, in Early English style. Though the\nwest end is now in a very ruinous condition, the great east window is\nfairly well preserved. It has two lights, and is very beautifully\nproportioned. Outside the court is the garden, with lawns and trees, too\noften desecrated by picnic parties, and the ponds that supplied the\nmonks with fish are now choked up. It is said that a carpenter who\nbought the materials of the church from Sir Bartlet Lucy was warned in a\ndream by a monk not to destroy the building. He paid no heed, and was\nkilled by the west window falling on him.",
