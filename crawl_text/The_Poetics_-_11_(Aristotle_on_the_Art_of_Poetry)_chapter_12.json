        "\nA Peripety is the change from one state of things within the play to\nits opposite of the kind described, and that too in the way we are\nsaying, in the probable or necessary sequence of events; as it is for\ninstance in Oedipus: here the opposite state of things is produced\nby the Messenger, who, coming to gladden Oedipus and to remove his\nfears as to his mother, reveals the secret of his birth. And in\nLynceus: just as he is being led off for execution, with Danaus at\nhis side to put him to death, the incidents preceding this bring it\nabout that he is saved and Danaus put to death. A Discovery is, as the\nvery word implies, a change from ignorance to knowledge, and thus to\neither love or hate, in the personages marked for good or evil\nfortune. The finest form of Discovery is one attended by Peripeties,\nlike that which goes with the Discovery in Oedipus. There are no\ndoubt other forms of it; what we have said may happen in a way in\nreference to inanimate things, even things of a very casual kind; and\nit is also possible to discover whether some one has done or not done\nsomething. But the form most directly connected with the Plot and the\naction of the piece is the first-mentioned. This, with a Peripety,\nwill arouse either pity or fear—actions of that nature being what\nTragedy is assumed to represent; and it will also serve to bring about\nthe happy or unhappy ending. The Discovery, then, being of persons, it\nmay be that of one party only to the other, the latter being already\nknown; or both the parties may have to discover themselves. Iphigenia,\nfor instance, was discovered to Orestes by sending the letter; and\nanother Discovery was required to reveal him to Iphigenia.",
        "Two parts of the Plot, then, Peripety and Discovery, are on matters of\nthis sort. A third part is Suffering; which we may define as an action\nof a destructive or painful nature, such as murders on the stage,\ntortures, woundings, and the like. The other two have been already\nexplained.",
