        "The Shanty",
        "He had none but the poorest of tools, but he set about building a\nshanty. He was not a resourceful boy. His effort to win the book\nhad been an unusual one for him, as his instincts were not at all\ncommercial. When that matter came to the knowledge of the Home\nGovernment, he was rebuked for doing “work unworthy of a gentleman’s\nson” and forbidden under frightful penalties “ever again to resort to\nsuch degrading ways of raising money.”",
        "They gave him no money, so he was penniless. Most boys would have\npossessed themselves somehow of a good axe and spade. He had neither.\nAn old plane blade, fastened to a stick with nails, was all the axe\nand spade he had, yet with this he set to work and offset its poorness\nas a tool by dogged persistency. First, he selected the quietest\nspot near the spring–a bank hidden by a mass of foliage. He knew no\nspecial reason for hiding it, beyond the love of secrecy. He had\nread in some of his books “how the wily scouts led the way through a\npathless jungle, pulled aside a bough and there revealed a comfortable\ndwelling that none without the secret could possibly have discovered,\"\nso it seemed very proper to make it a complete mystery–a sort of\nsecret panel in the enchanted castle–and so picture himself as the\nwily scout leading his wondering companions to the shanty, though, of\ncourse, he had not made up his mind to reveal his secret to any one.\nHe often wished he could have the advantage of Rad’s strong arms and\nefficacious tools; but the workshop incident was only one of many that\ntaught him to leave his brother out of all calculation.",
        "Mother Earth is the best guardian of a secret, and Yan with his crude\nspade began by digging a hole in the bank. The hard blue clay made the\nwork slow, but two holidays spent in steady labour resulted in a hole\nseven feet wide and about four feet into the bank.",
        "In this he set about building the shanty. Logs seven or eight feet\nlong must be got to the place–at least twenty-five or thirty would\nbe needed, and how to cut and handle them with his poor axe was a\nquestion. Somehow, he never looked for a better axe. The half-formed\nnotion that the Indians had no better was sufficient support, and he\nstruggled away bravely, using whatever ready sized material he could\nfind. Each piece as he brought it was put into place. Some boys would\nhave gathered the logs first and built it all at once, but that\nwas not Yan’s way; he was too eager to see the walls rise. He had\npainfully and slowly gathered logs enough to raise the walls three\nrounds, when the question of a door occurred to him. This, of course,\ncould not be cut through the logs in the ordinary way; that required\nthe best of tools. So he lifted out all the front logs except the\nlowest, replacing them at the ends with stones and blocks to sustain\nthe sides. This gave him the sudden gain of two logs, and helped the\nrest of the walls that much. The shanty was now about three feet high,\nand no two logs in it were alike: some were much too long, most were\ncrooked and some were half rotten, for the simple reason that these\nwere the only ones he could cut. He had exhausted the logs in the\nneighbourhood and was forced to go farther. Now he remembered seeing\none that might do, half a mile away on the home trail (they were\nalways “trails\"; he never called them “roads” or “paths”). He went\nafter this, and to his great surprise and delight found that it was\none of a dozen old cedar posts that had been cut long before and\nthrown aside as culls, or worthless. He could carry only one at a\ntime, so that to bring each one meant a journey of a mile, and the\npost got woefully heavy each time before that mile was over. To\nget those twelve logs he had twelve miles to walk. It took several\nSaturdays, but he stuck doggedly to it. Twelve good logs completed\nhis shanty, making it five feet high and leaving three logs over for\nrafters. These he laid flat across, dividing the spaces equally. Over\nthem he laid plenty of small sticks and branches till it was thickly\ncovered. Then he went down to a rank, grassy meadow and, with his\nknife, cut hay for a couple of hours. This was spread thickly on the\nroof, to be covered with strips of Elm bark then on top of all he\nthrew the clay dug from the bank, piling it well back, stamping on it,\nand working it down at the edges. Finally, he threw rubbish and leaves\nover it, so that it was confused with the general tangle.",
        "Thus the roof was finished, but the whole of the front was open. He\ndreaded the search for more logs, so tried a new plan. He found,\nfirst, some sticks about six feet long and two or three inches\nthrough. Not having an axe to sharpen and drive them, he dug pairs of\nholes a foot deep, one at each end and another pair near the middle of\nthe front ground log.",
        "Into each of these he put a pair of upright sticks, leading up to the\neave log, one inside and one outside of it, then packed the earth\naround them in the holes. Next, he went to the brook-side and cut a\nnumber of long green willow switches about half an inch thick at the\nbutt. These switches he twisted around the top of each pair of stakes\nin a figure 8, placing them to hold the stake tight against the bottom\nand top logs at the front.",
        "Down by the spring he now dug a hole and worked water and clay\ntogether into mortar, then with a trowel cut out of a shingle, and\nmortar carried in an old bucket, he built a wall within the stakes,\nusing sticks laid along the outside and stones set in mud till the\nfront was closed up, except a small hole for a window and a large hole\nfor a door.",
        "Now he set about finishing the inside. He gathered moss in the woods\nand stuffed all the chinks in the upper parts, and those next the\nground he filled with stones and earth. Thus the shanty was finished;\nbut it lacked a door.",
        "The opening was four feet high and two feet wide, so in the woodshed\nat home he cut three boards, each eight inches wide and four feet\nhigh, but he left at each end of one a long point. Doing this at home\ngave him the advantage of a saw. Then with these and two shorter\nboards, each two feet long and six inches wide, he sneaked out to\nGlenyan, and there, with some nails and a stone for a hammer, he\nfastened them together into a door. In the ground log he pecked a hole\nbig enough to receive one of the points and made a corresponding hole\nin the under side of the top log. Then, prying up the eave log, he put\nthe door in place, let the eave log down again, and the door was hung.\nA string to it made an outside fastening when it was twisted around a\nprojecting snag in the wall, and a peg thrust into a hole within made\nan inside fastener. Some logs, with fir boughs and dried grass, formed\na bunk within. This left only the window, and for lack of better cover\nhe fastened over it a piece of muslin brought from home. But finding\nits dull white a jarring note, he gathered a quart of butternuts, and\nwatching his chance at home, he boiled the cotton in water with the\nnuts and so reduced it to a satisfactory yellowish brown.",
        "His final task was to remove all appearance of disturbance and to\nfully hide the shanty in brush and trailing vines. Thus, after weeks\nof labour, his woodland home was finished. It was only five feet high\ninside, six feet long and six feet wide–dirty and uncomfortable–but\nwhat a happiness it was to have it.",
        "Here for the first time in his life he began to realize something\nof the pleasure of single-handed achievement in the line of a great\nambition.",
