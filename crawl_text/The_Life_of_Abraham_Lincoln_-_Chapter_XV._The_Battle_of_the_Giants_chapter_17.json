        "\nAbraham Lincoln (1809-1865)\n16th President of the United States",
        "\n\n",
        "The admiring friends of Douglas had given him the nickname of “the\nlittle giant.” To this he was fairly entitled. Physically he was very\nlittle. Intellectually he was a giant. He was in 1858 perhaps the most\nprominent man in the United States. He was the unquestioned leader of\nthe dominant party. He had been so long in public life that he was\nfamiliar with every public question, while upon the burning question of\nslavery he was the leader.",
        "Lincoln was a giant physically, and it soon became evident that he was\nno less intellectually. These two men soon were to come together in a\nseries of joint debates. It was manifest that this would be a battle of\nintellectual giants. No other such debates have ever occurred in the\nhistory of the country.",
        "Events led up to this rapidly and with the certainty of fate. In 1854\nLincoln had been candidate for the senate to succeed Shields, but his\nparty had been outwitted and he was compelled to substitute Trumbull.\nIn 1856 he was the logical candidate for governor, but he was of\nopinion that the cause would be better served permanently by placing an\nanti-slavery democrat in nomination. This was done and Bissell was\nelected. Now in 1858 the senatorial term of Douglas was about to expire\nand a successor would be chosen. Douglas was the candidate of his own\nparty. The republicans turned naturally and spontaneously to Lincoln,\nfor it would be no light task to defeat so strong an opponent.",
        "The republican convention met in Springfield on the 16th of June.\nLincoln was by acclamation nominated “as the first and only choice” of\nthe republican party for United States senator. The above time-honored\nphrase was used sincerely on that occasion. There was great enthusiasm,\nabsolute unanimity.",
        "On the evening of the following day he addressed the convention in a\nspeech which has become historic. His opening words were:",
        "“If we could first know where we are and whither we are tending, we\ncould better judge what to do and how to do it. We are now far into the\nfifth year since a policy was initiated, with the avowed object and\nconfident promise of putting an end to the slavery agitation. Under the\noperation of that policy, that agitation has not only not ceased, but\nhas constantly augmented. In my opinion it will not cease until a\ncrisis shall have been reached and passed. ’A house divided against\nitself cannot stand.’ I believe this government cannot endure\npermanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be\ndissolved–I do not expect the house to fall–but I do expect it will\ncease to be divided. It will become all one thing or all the other.\nEither the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it,\nand place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is\nin the course of ultimate extinction; or its advocates will push it\nforward till it shall become alike lawful in all the states, old as\nwell as new, North as well as South.”",
        "This speech came quickly to be known as “the house-divided-against-\nitself speech.” By that name it is still known. Concluding he said:\n“Our cause, then, must be entrusted to and conducted by its own\nundoubted friends, those whose hands are free, whose hearts are in the\nwork, who do care for the result.... The result is not doubtful. We\nshall not fail. If we stand firm we shall not fail. Wise counsels may\naccelerate or mistakes delay it, but sooner or later the victory is\nsure to come.” This was a strong speech, delivered before an audience\nof men of unusual ability, delegates who represented all parts of the\nstate. It was in no wise a harangue. It was entirely thoughtful and\nstrictly logical. The effect of it was to intensify the enthusiasm, and\nto spread it all through the state. It was a speech that Douglas could\nnot ignore, though he might misrepresent it. This he did by raising the\ncharge of sectionalism against his adversary.",
        "About three weeks later, on the 9th of July, Douglas made an elaborate\nspeech in Chicago. Lincoln was in the audience. It was unofficially\narranged that he should reply. He did so the following evening. A week\nlater a similar thing occurred in Springfield. Douglas made a speech in\nthe afternoon to which Lincoln replied in the evening. Shortly after\nthis Lincoln wrote Douglas a letter proposing a series of joint\ndiscussions, or challenging him to a series of joint debates. Douglas\nreplied in a patronizing and irritating tone, asked for a slight\nadvantage in his own favor, but he accepted the proposal. He did not do\nit in a very gracious manner, but he did it. They arranged for seven\ndiscussions in towns, the locations being scattered fairly over the\nentire territory of the state.",
        "If Illinois had before been “the cynosure of neighboring eyes,” much\nmore was it so now. Lincoln was by no means the most prominent anti-\nslavery man, but he was the only man in a position to beard his rival.\nThe proposed debates excited not only the interest of the state and the\nneighboring states, but from the East and the South all minds were\nturned to this tournament. It was not a local discussion; it was a\nnational and critical question that was at issue. The interest was no\nless eager in New York, Washington, and Charleston than in\nIndianapolis, Milwaukee, and St. Louis.",
        "The two men had been neighbors for many years. They were together\nmembers of the legislature, first in Vandalia and then in Springfield.\nThey had frequently met socially in Springfield. Both paid marked\nattentions to the same young lady. Both had served in Washington City.\nDouglas was for most of his life an officeholder, so that in one way or\nanother Lincoln would be brought into association with him. But though\nthey met so frequently it is not probable that, before this time,\neither recognized in the other his supreme antagonist. After the repeal\nof the Missouri Compromise Lincoln had, as already related, discussed\nDouglas with great plainness of speech. This had been twice repeated in\nthis year. But these were, comparatively speaking, mere incidents. The\ngreat contest was to be in the debates.",
        "In the outset, Douglas had the advantage of prestige. Nothing succeeds\nlike success. Douglas had all his life had nothing but success. He\ntwice had missed the nomination for presidency, but he was still the\nmost formidable man in the senate. He was very popular in his own\nstate. He was everywhere greeted by large crowds, with bands of music\nand other demonstrations. He always traveled in a special car and often\nin a special train, which was freely placed at his disposal by the\nIllinois Central Railway. Lincoln traveled by accommodation train,\nfreight train, or wagon, as best he could. As both the men were\neveryday speaking independently between the debates, this question of\ntransportation was serious. The inconveniences of travel made a great\ndrain upon the nervous force and the health. One day when the freight\ntrain bearing Lincoln was side-tracked to let his rival’s special train\nroll by, he good-humoredly remarked that Douglas “did not smell any\nroyalty in this car.”",
        "Another fact which gave Douglas the advantage was the friendship and\nsympathy of Horace Greeley and others, who had much influence with the\nparty of Lincoln. Douglas had broken with Buchanan’s administration on\na question relating to Kansas. The iniquity of the powers at Washington\nwent so far that even Douglas rebelled. This led Greeley and others to\nthink that Douglas had in him the making of a good republican if he was\nonly treated with sufficient consideration. Accordingly, all of that\ninfluence was bitterly thrown in opposition to Lincoln.",
        "The methods of the two men were as diverse as their bodily appearance.\nDouglas was a master of what the ancient Greeks would have called\n“making the worse appear the better reason.” He was able to misstate\nhis antagonist’s position so shrewdly as to deceive the very elect. And\nwith equal skill he could escape from the real meaning of his own\nstatements. Lincoln’s characterization is apt: “Judge Douglas is\nplaying cuttlefish–a small species of fish that has no mode of\ndefending himself when pursued except by throwing out a black fluid\nwhich makes the water so dark the enemy cannot see it, and thus it\nescapes.”",
        "Lincoln’s method was to hold the discussion down to the point at issue\nwith clear and forcible statement. He arraigned the iniquity of slavery\nas an offense against God. He made the phrase “all men” of the\nDeclaration of Independence include the black as well as the white.\nSaid he: “There is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled\nto all the natural rights enumerated in the Declaration of\nIndependence–the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of\nhappiness.... In the right to eat the bread, without the leave of\nanybody else, which his own hand earns, he is my equal, and the equal\nof Judge Douglas, and the equal of every living man.” He quoted\nJefferson’s remark, “I tremble for my country when I remember that God\nis just.” Mercilessly he analyzed Douglas’s speeches and exposed his\nsophistry.",
        "The forensic ability of the two men is suggestively indicated by the\nremark of a lady who heard them speak, and afterward said: “I can\nrecall only one fact of the debates, that I felt so sorry for Lincoln\nwhile Douglas was speaking, and then so sorry for Douglas while\nLincoln was speaking.”",
        "These debates occupied seven different evenings of three hours each.\nThe speeches were afterwards published in book form and had a wide\ncirculation. These speeches, numbering twenty-one in all, filled a\nlarge volume. It is not the purpose of this chapter to give an outline\nof the debates, it is only to give a general idea of their result. But\nout of them came one prominent fact, which so influenced the careers of\nthe two men that it must be briefly recorded. This went by the name of\n“the Freeport doctrine.”",
        "In the first debate Douglas had asked Lincoln a series of questions.\nThe villainy of these questions was in the innuendo. They began, “I\ndesire to know whether Lincoln stands to-day, as he did in 1854, in\nfavor of,” etc. Douglas then quoted from the platform of a convention\nwhich Lincoln had not attended, and with which he had nothing to do.\nLincoln denied these insinuations, and said that he had never favored\nthose doctrines; but the trick succeeded, and the impression was made\nthat Douglas had cornered him. The questions, to all intents and\npurposes, were a forgery. This forgery was quickly exposed by a Chicago\npaper, and the result was not helpful to Douglas. It was made manifest\nthat he was not conducting the debates in a fair and manly way.",
        "Further than this, the fact that these questions had been asked gave\nLincoln, in turn, the right to ask questions of Douglas. This right he\nused. For the next debate, which was to be at Freeport, he prepared,\namong others, the following question: “Can the people of a United\nStates territory, in any lawful way, against the wish of any citizen of\nthe United States, exclude slavery from its limits prior to the\nformation of a state constitution?” If this were answered “No,” it\nwould alienate the citizens of Illinois. If it were answered “Yes,” it\nwould alienate the democrats of the South.",
        "On the way to Freeport he met a number of friends and took counsel of\nthem. When he read question number two, the one above quoted, his\nfriends earnestly and unanimously advised him not to put that question.\n“If you do,” said they, “you never can be senator.” To which Lincoln\nreplied: “Gentlemen, I am killing larger game. If Douglas answers, he\ncan never be President, and the battle of 1860 is worth a hundred of\nthis.”",
        "It is not probable that Lincoln expected to be in 1860 the nominee of\nthe republican party. But he did see the danger of the election of\nDouglas to the presidency. He was willing to surrender the senatorial\nelection to save the country from a Douglas administration. The\nsacrifice was made. The prediction proved true. Lincoln lost the\nsenatorship, Douglas lost the presidency.",
        "The popular verdict, as shown in the election, was in favor of Lincoln.\nThe republicans polled 125,430 votes; the Douglas democrats, 121,609,\nand the Buchanan democrats, 5,071. But the apportionment of the\nlegislative districts was such that Douglas had a majority on the joint\nballot of the legislature. He received 54 votes to 46 for Lincoln. This\nsecured his reelection to the senate.",
        "The popular verdict outside the state of Illinois was in favor of\nLincoln. The republican party circulated the volume containing the full\nreport of the speeches. It does not appear that the democrats did so.\nThis forces the conclusion that the intellectual and moral victory was\non the side of Lincoln.",
        "There is a pathetic sequel to this. The campaign had been very arduous\non Lincoln. Douglas had made 130 speeches in 100 days, not counting\nSundays. Lincoln had made probably about the same number. These were\nnot brief addresses from a railway car, but fully elaborated speeches.\nThe labors commenced early in July and continued through the heat of\nthe summer. With Lincoln the inadequate means of travel added to the\ndraft upon his strength. At the end of all came the triumphant election\nof his rival. Add to this the fact that the next day he received a\nletter from the republican committee saying that their funds would not\nmeet the bills, and asking for an additional contribution. The rest is\nbest told in Lincoln’s own words:",
        "“Yours of the 15th is just received. I wrote you the same day. As to\nthe pecuniary matter, I am willing to pay according to my ability, but\nI am the poorest hand living to get others to pay. I have been on\nexpense so long without earning anything that I am absolutely without\nmoney now for even household purposes. Still, if you can put up $250\nfor me towards discharging the debt of the committee, I will allow it\nwhen you and I settle the private matter between us. This, with what I\nhave already paid, and with an outstanding note of mine, will exceed my\nsubscription of $500. This, too, is exclusive of my ordinary expenses\nduring the campaign, all which, being added to my loss of time and\nbusiness, bears pretty heavily on one no better off in world’s goods\nthan I; but as I had the post of honor, it is not for me to be over-\nnice. You are feeling badly–’And this, too, shall pass away.’ Never\nfear.”",
