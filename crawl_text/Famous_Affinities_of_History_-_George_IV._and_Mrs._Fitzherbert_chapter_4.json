        "In the last decade of the eighteenth century England was perhaps\nthe most brilliant nation of the world. Other countries had been\nhumbled by the splendid armies of France and were destined to be\nstill further humbled by the emperor who came from Corsica. France\nhad begun to seize the scepter of power; yet to this picture there\nwas another side–fearful want and grievous poverty and the\nhorrors of the Revolution. Russia was too far away, and was still\nconsidered too barbarous, for a brilliant court to flourish there.\nPrussia had the prestige that Frederick the Great won for her, but\nshe was still a comparatively small state. Italy was in a\ncondition of political chaos; the banks of the Rhine were running\nblood where the Austrian armies faced the gallant Frenchmen under\nthe leadership of Moreau. But England, in spite of the loss of her\nAmerican colonies, was rich and prosperous, and her invincible\nfleets were extending her empire over the seven seas.",
        "At no time in modern England has the court at London seen so much\nreal splendor or such fine manners. The royalist emigres who fled\nfrom France brought with them names and pedigrees that were older\nthan the Crusades, and many of them were received with the\nfrankest, freest English hospitality. If here and there some\nmarquis or baron of ancient blood was perforce content to teach\nmusic to the daughters of tradesmen in suburban schools,\nnevertheless they were better off than they had been in France,\nharried by the savage gaze-hounds of the guillotine. Afterward,\nin the days of the Restoration, when they came back to their\nestates, they had probably learned more than one lesson from the\nbouledogues of Merry England, who had little tact, perhaps, but\nwho were at any rate kindly and willing to share their goods with\npinched and poverty-stricken foreigners.",
        "The court, then, as has been said, was brilliant with notables\nfrom Continental countries, and with the historic wealth of the\npeerage of England. Only one cloud overspread it; and that was the\nmental condition of the king. We have become accustomed to think\nof George III as a dull creature, almost always hovering on the\nverge of that insanity which finally swept him into a dark\nobscurity; but Thackeray’s picture of him is absurdly untrue to\nthe actual facts. George III. was by no means a dullard, nor was\nhe a sort of beefy country squire who roved about the palace\ngardens with his unattractive spouse.",
        "Obstinate enough he was, and ready for a combat with the rulers of\nthe Continent or with his self-willed sons; but he was a man of\nbrains and power, and Lord Rosebery has rightly described him as\nthe most striking constitutional figure of his time. Had he\nretained his reason, and had his erratic and self-seeking son not\nsucceeded him during his own lifetime, Great Britain might very\npossibly have entered upon other ways than those which opened to\nher after the downfall of Napoleon.",
        "The real center of fashionable England, however, was not George\nIII., but rather his son, subsequently George IV., who was made\nPrince of Wales three days after his birth, and who became prince\nregent during the insanity of the king. He was the leader of the\nsocial world, the fit companion of Beau Brummel and of a choice\ncircle of rakes and fox-hunters who drank pottle-deep. Some called\nhim “the first gentleman of Europe.” Others, who knew him better,\ndescribed him as one who never kept his word to man or woman and\nwho lacked the most elementary virtues.",
        "Yet it was his good luck during the first years of his regency to\nbe popular as few English kings have ever been. To his people he\ntypified old England against revolutionary France; and his youth\nand gaiety made many like him. He drank and gambled; he kept packs\nof hounds and strings of horses; he ran deeply into debt that he\nmight patronize the sports of that uproarious day. He was a\ngallant “Corinthian,” a haunter of dens where there were prize-\nfights and cock-fights, and there was hardly a doubtful resort in\nLondon where his face was not familiar.",
        "He was much given to gallantry–not so much, as it seemed, for\nwantonness, but from sheer love of mirth and chivalry. For a time,\nwith his chosen friends, such as Fox and Sheridan, he ventured\ninto reckless intrigues that recalled the amours of his\npredecessor, Charles II. He had by no means the wit and courage of\nCharles; and, indeed, the house of Hanover lacked the outward show\nof chivalry which made the Stuarts shine with external splendor.\nBut he was good-looking and stalwart, and when he had half a dozen\nrobust comrades by his side he could assume a very manly\nappearance. Such was George IV. in his regency and in his prime.\nHe made that period famous for its card-playing, its deep\ndrinking, and for the dissolute conduct of its courtiers and\nnoblemen no less than for the gallantry of its soldiers and its\nmomentous victories on sea and land. It came, however, to be seen\nthat his true achievements were in reality only escapades, that\nhis wit was only folly, and his so-called “sensibility” was but\nsham. He invented buckles, striped waistcoats, and flamboyant\ncollars, but he knew nothing of the principles of kingship or the\nlaws by which a state is governed.",
        "The fact that he had promiscuous affairs with women appealed at\nfirst to the popular sense of the romantic. It was not long,\nhowever, before these episodes were trampled down into the mire of\nvulgar scandal.",
        "One of the first of them began when he sent a letter, signed\n“Florizel,” to a young actress, “Perdita” Robinson. Mrs. Robinson,\nwhose maiden name was Mary Darby, and who was the original of\nfamous portraits by Gainsborough and Reynolds, was a woman of\nbeauty, talent, and temperament. George, wishing in every way to\nbe “romantic,” insisted upon clandestine meetings on the Thames at\nKew, with all the stage trappings of the popular novels–cloaks,\nveils, faces hidden, and armed watchers to warn her of approaching\ndanger. Poor Perdita took this nonsense so seriously that she gave\nup her natural vocation for the stage, and forsook her husband,\nbelieving that the prince would never weary of her.",
        "He did weary of her very soon, and, with the brutality of a man of\nsuch a type, turned her away with the promise of some money; after\nwhich he cut her in the Park and refused to speak to her again. As\nfor the money, he may have meant to pay it, but Perdita had a long\nstruggle before she succeeded in getting it. It may be assumed\nthat the prince had to borrow it and that this obligation formed\npart of the debts which Parliament paid for him.",
        "It is not necessary to number the other women whose heads he\nturned. They are too many for remembrance here, and they have no\nspecial significance, save one who, as is generally believed,\nbecame his wife so far as the church could make her so. An act of\n1772 had made it illegal for any member of the English royal\nfamily to marry without the permission of the king. A marriage\ncontracted without the king’s consent might be lawful in the eyes\nof the church, but the children born of it could not inherit any\nclaim to the throne.",
        "It may be remarked here that this withholding of permission was\nstrictly enforced. Thus William IV., who succeeded George IV., was\nmarried, before his accession to the throne, to Mrs. Jordan\n(Dorothy Bland). Afterward he lawfully married a woman of royal\nbirth who was known as Queen Adelaide.",
        "There is an interesting story which tells how Queen Victoria came\nto be born because her father, the Duke of Kent, was practically\nforced to give up a morganatic union which he greatly preferred to\na marriage arranged for him by Parliament. Except the Duke of\nCambridge, the Duke of Kent was the only royal duke who was likely\nto have children in the regular line. The only daughter of George\nIV. had died in childhood. The Duke of Cumberland was for various\nreasons ineligible; the Duke of Clarence, later King William IV.,\nwas almost too old; and therefore, to insure the succession, the\nDuke of Kent was begged to marry a young and attractive woman, a\nprincess of the house of Saxe-Coburg, who was ready for the honor.\nIt was greatly to the Duke’s credit that he showed deep and\nsincere feeling in this matter. As he said himself in effect:",
        "“This French lady has stood by me in hard times and in good times,\ntoo–why should I cast her off? She has been more than a wife to\nme. And what do I care for your plans in Parliament? Send over for\none of the Stuarts–they are better men than the last lot of our\nfellows that you have had!”",
        "In the end, however, he was wearied out and was persuaded to\nmarry, but he insisted that a generous sum should be settled on\nthe lady who had been so long his true companion, and to whom, no\ndoubt, he gave many a wistful thought in his new but unfamiliar\nquarters in Kensington Palace, which was assigned as his\nresidence.",
        "Again, the second Duke of Cambridge, who died only a few years\nago, greatly desired to marry a lady who was not of royal rank,\nthough of fine breeding and of good birth. He besought his young\ncousin, as head of the family, to grant him this privilege of\nmarriage; but Queen Victoria stubbornly refused. The duke was\nmarried according to the rites of the church, but he could not\nmake his wife a duchess. The queen never quite forgave him for his\npartial defiance of her wishes, though the duke’s wife–she was\nusually spoken of as Mrs. FitzGeorge–was received almost\neverywhere, and two of her sons hold high rank in the British army\nand navy, respectively.",
        "The one real love story in the life of George IV. is that which\ntells of his marriage with a lady who might well have been the\nwife of any king. This was Maria Anne Smythe, better known as Mrs.\nFitzherbert, who was six years older than the young prince when\nshe first met him in company with a body of gentlemen and ladies\nin 1784.",
        "Maria Fitzherbert’s face was one which always displayed its best\nadvantages. Her eyes were peculiarly languishing, and, as she had\nalready been twice a widow, and was six years his senior, she had\nthe advantage over a less experienced lover. Likewise, she was a\nCatholic, and so by another act of Parliament any marriage with\nher would be illegal. Yet just because of all these different\nobjections the prince was doubly drawn to her, and was willing to\nsacrifice even the throne if he could but win her.",
        "His father, the king, called him into the royal presence and said:",
        "“George, it is time that you should settle down and insure the\nsuccession to the throne.”",
        "“Sir,” replied the prince, “I prefer to resign the succession and\nlet my brother have it, and that I should live as a private\nEnglish gentleman.”",
        "Mrs. Fitzherbert was not the sort of woman to give herself up\nreadily to a morganatic connection. Moreover, she soon came to\nlove Prince George too well to entangle him in a doubtful alliance\nwith one of another faith than his. Not long after he first met\nher the prince, who was always given to private theatricals, sent\nmessengers riding in hot haste to her house to tell her that he\nhad stabbed himself, that he begged to see her, and that unless\nshe came he would repeat the act. The lady yielded, and hurried to\nCarlton House, the prince’s residence; but she was prudent enough\nto take with her the Duchess of Devonshire, who was a reigning\nbeauty of the court.",
        "The scene which followed was theatrical rather than impressive.–\nThe prince was found in his sleeping-chamber, pale and with his\nruffles blood-stained. He played the part of a youthful and love-\nstricken wooer, vowing that he would marry the woman of his heart\nor stab himself again. In the presence of his messengers, who,\nwith the duchess, were witnesses, he formally took the lady as his\nwife, while Lady Devonshire’s wedding-ring sealed the troth. The\nprince also acknowledged it in a document.",
        "Mrs. Fitzherbert was, in fact, a woman of sound sense. Shortly\nafter this scene of melodramatic intensity her wits came back to\nher, and she recognized that she had merely gone through a\nmeaningless farce. So she sent back the prince’s document and the\nring and hastened to the Continent, where he could not reach her,\nalthough his detectives followed her steps for a year.",
        "At the last she yielded, however, and came home to marry the\nprince in such fashion as she could–a marriage of love, and\nsurely one of morality, though not of parliamentary law. The\nceremony was performed “in her own drawing-room in her house in\nLondon, in the presence of the officiating Protestant clergyman\nand two of her own nearest relatives.”",
        "Such is the serious statement of Lord Stourton, who was Mrs.\nFitzherbert’s cousin and confidant. The truth of it was never\ndenied, and Mrs. Fitzherbert was always treated with respect, and\neven regarded as a person of great distinction. Nevertheless, on\nmore than one occasion the prince had his friends in Parliament\ndeny the marriage in order that his debts might be paid and new\nallowances issued to him by the Treasury.",
        "George certainly felt himself a husband. Like any other married\nprince, he set himself to build a palace for his country home.\nWhile in search of some suitable spot he chanced to visit the\n“pretty fishing-village” of Brighton to see his uncle, the Duke of\nCumberland. Doubtless he found it an attractive place, yet this\nmay have been not so much because of its view of the sea as for\nthe reason that Mrs. Fitzherbert had previously lived there.",
        "However, in 1784 the prince sent down his chief cook to make\narrangements for the next royal visit. The cook engaged a house on\nthe spot where the Pavilion now stands, and from that time\nBrighton began to be an extremely fashionable place. The court\ndoctors, giving advice that was agreeable, recommended their royal\npatient to take sea-bathing at Brighton. At once the place sprang\ninto popularity.",
        "At first the gentry were crowded into lodging-houses and the\naccommodations were primitive to a degree. But soon handsome\nvillas arose on every side; hotels appeared; places of amusement\nwere opened. The prince himself began to build a tasteless but\nshowy structure, partly Chinese and partly Indian in style, on the\nfashionable promenade of the Steyne.",
        "During his life with Mrs. Fitzherbert at Brighton the prince held\nwhat was practically a court. Hundreds of the aristocracy came\ndown from London and made their temporary dwellings there; while\nthousands who were by no means of the court made the place what is\nnow popularly called “London by the Sea.” There were the Duc de\nChartres, of France; statesmen and rakes, like Fox, Sheridan, and\nthe Earl of Barrymore; a very beautiful woman, named Mrs. Couch, a\nfavorite singer at the opera, to whom the prince gave at one time\njewels worth ten thousand pounds; and a sister of the Earl of\nBarrymore, who was as notorious as her brother. She often took the\npresident’s chair at a club which George’s friends had organized\nand which she had christened the Hell Fire Club.",
        "Such persons were not the only visitors at Brighton. Men of much\nmore serious demeanor came down to visit the prince and brought\nwith them quieter society. Nevertheless, for a considerable time\nthe place was most noted for its wild scenes of revelry, into\nwhich George frequently entered, though his home life with Mrs.\nFitzherbert at the Pavilion was a decorous one.",
        "No one felt any doubt as to the marriage of the two persons, who\nseemed so much like a prince and a princess. Some of the people of\nthe place addressed Mrs. Fitzherbert as “Mrs. Prince.” The old\nking and his wife, however, much deplored their son’s relation\nwith her. This was partly due to the fact that Mrs. Fitzherbert\nwas a Catholic and that she had received a number of French nuns\nwho had been driven out of France at the time of the Revolution.\nBut no less displeasure was caused by the prince’s racing and\ndicing, which swelled his debts to almost a million pounds, so\nthat Parliament and, indeed, the sober part of England were set\nagainst him.",
        "Of course, his marriage to Mrs. Fitzherbert had no legal status;\nnor is there any reason for believing that she ever became a\nmother. She had no children by her former two husbands, and Lord\nStourton testified positively that she never had either son or\ndaughter by Prince George. Nevertheless, more than one American\nclaimant has risen to advance some utterly visionary claim to the\nEnglish throne by reason of alleged descent from Prince George and\nMrs. Fitzherbert.",
        "Neither William IV. nor Queen Victoria ever spent much time at\nBrighton. In King William’s case it was explained that the\ndampness of the Pavilion did not suit him; and as to Queen\nVictoria, it was said that she disliked the fact that buildings\nhad been erected so as to cut off the view of the sea. It is quite\nlikely, however, that the queen objected to the associations of\nthe place, and did not care to be reminded of the time when her\nuncle had lived there so long in a morganatic state of marriage.",
        "At length the time came when the king, Parliament, and the people\nat large insisted that the Prince of Wales should make a legal\nmarriage, and a wife was selected for him in the person of\nCaroline, daughter of the Duke of Brunswick. This marriage took\nplace exactly ten years after his wedding with the beautiful and\ngentle-mannered Mrs. Fitzherbert. With the latter he had known\nmany days and hours of happiness. With Princess Caroline he had no\nhappiness at all.",
        "Prince George met her at the pier to greet her. It is said that as\nhe took her hand he kissed her, and then, suddenly recoiling, he\nwhispered to one of his friends:",
        "“For God’s sake, George, give me a glass of brandy!”",
        "Such an utterance was more brutal and barbaric than anything his\nbride could have conceived of, though it is probable, fortunately,\nthat she did not understand him by reason of her ignorance of\nEnglish.",
        "We need not go through the unhappy story of this unsympathetic,\nneglected, rebellious wife. Her life with the prince soon became\none of open warfare; but instead of leaving England she remained\nto set the kingdom in an uproar. As soon as his father died and he\nbecame king, George sued her for divorce. Half the people sided\nwith the queen, while the rest regarded her as a vulgar creature\nwho made love to her attendants and brought dishonor on the\nEnglish throne. It was a sorry, sordid contrast between the young\nPrince George who had posed as a sort of cavalier and this now\nfurious gray old man wrangling with his furious German wife.",
        "Well might he look back to the time when he met Perdita in the\nmoonlight on the Thames, or when he played the part of Florizel,\nor, better still, when he enjoyed the sincere and disinterested\nlove of the gentle woman who was his wife in all but legal status.\nCaroline of Brunswick was thrust away from the king’s coronation.\nShe took a house within sight of Westminster Abbey, so that she\nmight make hag-like screeches to the mob and to the king as he\npassed by. Presently, in August, 1821, only a month after the\ncoronation, she died, and her body was taken back to Brunswick for\nburial.",
        "George himself reigned for nine years longer. When he died in 1830\nhis executor was the Duke of Wellington. The duke, in examining\nthe late king’s private papers, found that he had kept with the\ngreatest care every letter written to him by his morganatic wife.\nDuring his last illness she had sent him an affectionate missive\nwhich it is said George “read eagerly.” Mrs. Fitzherbert wished\nthe duke to give up her letters; but he would do so only in return\nfor those which he had written to her.",
        "It was finally decided that it would be best to burn both his and\nhers. This work was carried out in Mrs. Fitzherbert’s own house by\nthe lady, the duke, and the Earl of Albemarle.",
        "Of George it may be said that he has left as memories behind him\nonly three things that will be remembered. The first is the\nPavilion at Brighton, with its absurdly oriental decorations, its\nminarets and flimsy towers. The second is the buckle which he\ninvented and which Thackeray has immortalized with his biting\nsatire. The last is the story of his marriage to Maria\nFitzherbert, and of the influence exercised upon him by the\naffection of a good woman.",
