        "Time ran on; thousands of pounds were offered in reward, for the\ndeath of Sir Danvers was resented as a public injury; but Mr. Hyde\nhad disappeared out of the ken of the police as though he had never\nexisted. Much of his past was unearthed, indeed, and all\ndisreputable: tales came out of the man’s cruelty, at once so\ncallous and violent; of his vile life, of his strange associates,\nof the hatred that seemed to have surrounded his career; but of his\npresent whereabouts, not a whisper. From the time he had left the\nhouse in Soho on the morning of the murder, he was simply blotted\nout; and gradually, as time drew on, Mr. Utterson began to recover\nfrom the hotness of his alarm, and to grow more at quiet with\nhimself. The death of Sir Danvers was, to his way of thinking, more\nthan paid for by the disappearance of Mr. Hyde. Now that that evil\ninfluence had been withdrawn, a new life began for Dr. Jekyll. He\ncame out of his seclusion, renewed relations with his friends,\nbecame once more their familiar guest and entertainer; and whilst he had always been, known for\ncharities, he was now no less distinguished for religion. He was\nbusy, he was much in the open air, he did good; his face seemed to\nopen and brighten, as if with an inward consciousness of service;\nand for more than two months, the doctor was at peace.",
        "On the 8th of January Utterson had dined at the doctor’s with a\nsmall party; Lanyon had been there; and the face of the host had\nlooked from one to the other as in the old days when the trio were\ninseparable friends. On the 12th, and again on the 14th, the door\nwas shut against the lawyer. “The doctor was confined to the\nhouse,” Poole said, “and saw no one.” On the 15th, he tried again,\nand was again refused; and having now been used for the last two\nmonths to see his friend almost daily, he found this return of\nsolitude to weigh upon his spirits. The fifth night he had in Guest\nto dine with him; and the sixth he betook himself to Dr. Lanyon’s.",
        "There at least he was not denied admittance; but when he came in,\nhe was shocked at the change which had taken place in the doctor’s\nappearance. He had his death-warrant written legibly upon his face.\nThe rosy man had grown pale; his flesh had fallen away; he was\nvisibly balder and older; and yet it was not so much, these tokens\nof a swift physical decay that arrested the lawyer’s notice, as a\nlook in the eye and quality of manner that seemed to testify to some deep-seated terror of the mind. It was unlikely that the\ndoctor should fear death; and yet that was what Utterson was\ntempted to suspect. “Yes,” he thought; “he is a doctor, he must\nknow his own state and that his days are counted; and the knowledge\nis more than he can bear.” And yet when Utterson remarked on his\nill-looks, it was with an air of greatness that Lanyon declared\nhimself a doomed man.",
        "“I have had a shock,” he said, “and I shall never recover. It is a\nquestion of weeks. Well, life has been pleasant; I liked it; yes,\nsir, I used to like it. I sometimes think if we knew all, we should\nbe more glad to get away.”",
        "“Jekyll is ill, too,” observed Utterson. “Have you seen him?”",
        "But Lanyon’s face changed, and he held up a trembling hand. “I wish\nto see or hear no more of Dr. Jekyll,” he said in a loud, unsteady\nvoice. “I am quite done with that person; and I beg that you will\nspare me any allusion to one whom I regard as dead.”",
        "“Tut-tut,” said Mr. Utterson; and then after a considerable pause,\"\nCan’t I do anything?” he inquired. “We are three very old friends,\nLanyon; we shall not live to make others.”",
        "“Nothing can be done,” returned Lanyon; “ask himself.” ",
        "He will not see me,” said the lawyer.",
        "“I am not surprised at that,” was the reply. “Some day, Utterson,\nafter I am dead, you may perhaps come to learn the right and wrong of this. I cannot tell\nyou. And in the meantime, if you can sit and talk with me of other\nthings, for God’s sake, stay and do so; but if you cannot keep clear\nof this accursed topic, then, in God’s name, go, for I cannot bear\nit.”",
        "As soon as he got home, Utterson sat down and wrote to Jekyll,\ncomplaining of his exclusion from the house, and asking the cause\nof this unhappy break with Lanyon; and the next day brought him a\nlong answer, often very pathetically worded, and sometimes darkly\nmysterious in drift. The quarrel with Lanyon was incurable. “I do\nnot blame our old friend,” Jekyll wrote, “but I share his view\nthat we must never meet. I mean from henceforth to lead a life of\nextreme seclusion; you must not be surprised, nor must you doubt\nmy friendship, if my door is often shut even to you. You must\nsuffer me to go my own dark way. I have brought on myself a\npunishment and a danger that I cannot name. If I am the chief of\nsinners, I am the chief of sufferers also. I could not think that\nthis earth contained a place for sufferings and terrors so\nunmanning; and you can do but one thing, Utterson, to lighten\nthis destiny, and that is to respect my silence.” Utterson was\namazed; the dark influence of Hyde had been withdrawn, the doctor\nhad returned to his old tasks and amities; a week ago, the\nprospect had smiled with every promise of a cheerful and an\nhonoured age; and now in a moment, friendship, and peace of mind, and the whole\ntenor of his life were wrecked. So great and unprepared a change\npointed to madness; but in view of Lanyon’s manner and words,\nthere must lie for it some deeper ground.",
        "A week afterwards Dr. Lanyon took to his bed, and in something\nless than a fortnight he was dead. The night after the funeral,\nat which he had been sadly affected, Utterson locked the door of\nhis business room, and sitting there by the light of a melancholy\ncandle, drew out and set before him an envelope addressed by the\nhand and sealed with the seal of his dead friend. “PRIVATE: for\nthe hands of G. J. Utterson ALONE and in case of his predecease\nto be destroyed unread,” so it was emphatically superscribed; and\nthe lawyer dreaded to behold the contents. “I have buried one\nfriend to-day,” he thought: “what if this should cost me\nanother?” And then he condemned the fear as a disloyalty, and\nbroke the seal. Within there was another enclosure, likewise\nsealed, and marked upon the cover as “not to be opened till the\ndeath or disappearance of Dr. Henry Jekyll.” Utterson could not\ntrust his eyes. Yes, it was disappearance; here again, as in the\nmad will which he had long ago restored to its author, here again\nwere the idea of a disappearance and the name of Henry Jekyll\nbracketed. But in the will, that idea had sprung from the\nsinister suggestion of the man Hyde; it was set there with a purpose all too plain and\nhorrible. Written by the hand of Lanyon, what should it mean? A\ngreat curiosity came on the trustee, to disregard the prohibition\nand dive at once to the bottom of these mysteries; but\nprofessional honour and faith to his dead friend were stringent\nobligations; and the packet slept in the inmost corner of his\nprivate safe.",
        "It is one thing to mortify curiosity, another to conquer it; and\nit may be doubted if, from that day forth, Utterson desired the\nsociety of his surviving friend with the same eagerness. He\nthought of him kindly; but his thoughts were disquieted and\nfearful. He went to call indeed; but he was perhaps relieved to\nbe denied admittance; perhaps, in his heart, he preferred to\nspeak with Poole upon the doorstep and surrounded by the air and\nsounds of the open city, rather than to be admitted into that\nhouse of voluntary bondage, and to sit and speak with its\ninscrutable recluse. Poole had, indeed, no very pleasant news to\ncommunicate. The doctor, it appeared, now more than ever confined\nhimself to the cabinet over the laboratory, where he would\nsometimes even sleep; he was out of spirits, he had grown very\nsilent, he did not read; it seemed as if he had something on his\nmind. Utterson became so used to the unvarying character of these\nreports, that he fell off little by little in the frequency of\nhis visits.",
