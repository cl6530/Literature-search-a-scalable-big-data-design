        "It is well known that previous to the war of the Revolution the whole of\nthe western portion of Pennsylvania was inhabited by different Indian\ntribes. Of these, the Delawares were the friends of the whites, and,\nafter the commencement of the great struggle, took part with the United\nStates. The Iroquois, on the contrary, were the friends and allies of\nthe mother-country.",
        "Very few white settlers had ventured beyond the Susquehanna. The\nnumerous roving bands of Shawanoes, Nanticokes, etc., although at times\nprofessing friendship with the Americans and acting in concert with the\nDelawares or Lenape as allies, at others suffered themselves to be\nseduced by their neighbors, the Iroquois, to show a most sanguinary\nspirit of hostility.",
        "For this reason, the life of the inhabitants of the frontier was one of\nconstant peril and alarm. Many a scene of dismal barbarity was enacted,\nas the history of the times testifies, and even those who felt\nthemselves in some measure protected by their immediate neighbors, the\nDelawares, never lost sight of the caution required by their exposed\nsituation.",
        "The vicinity of the military garrison at Pittsburg–or Fort Pitt, as it\nwas then called–gave additional security to those who had pushed\nfarther west, among the fertile valleys of the Alleghany and\nMonongahela. Among these were the family of Mr. Lytle, who, some years\nprevious to the opening of our story, had removed from Baltimore to\nPath Valley, near Carlisle, and subsequently settled himself on the\nbanks of Plum River, a tributary of the Alleghany. Here, with his wife\nand five children, he had continued to live in comfort and security,\nundisturbed by any hostile visit, and only annoyed by occasional false\nalarms from his more timorous neighbors, who, having had more experience\nin frontier life, were prone to anticipate evil, as well as to magnify\nevery appearance of danger.",
        "On a bright afternoon in the autumn of 1779, two children of Mr. Lytle,\na girl of nine, and her brother, two years younger, were playing in a\nlittle dingle or hollow in the rear of their father’s house. Some large\ntrees, which had been recently felled, were lying here and there, still\nuntrimmed of their branches, and many logs, prepared for fuel, were\nscattered around. Upon one of these the children, wearied with their\nsports, seated themselves, and to beguile the time they fell into\nconversation upon a subject that greatly perplexed them.",
        "While playing in the same place a few hours previous, they had imagined\nthey saw an Indian lurking behind one of the fallen trees. The Indians\nof the neighborhood were in the habit of making occasional visits to the\nfamily, and they had become familiar and even affectionate with many of\nthem, but this seemed a stranger, and after the first hasty glance they\nfled in alarm to the house.",
        "Their mother chid them for the report they brought, which she endeavored\nto convince them was without foundation. “You know,” said she, “you are\nalways alarming us unnecessarily: the neighbors’ children have\nfrightened you to death. Go back to your play, and learn to be more\ncourageous.”",
        "So the children returned to their sports, hardly persuaded by their\nmother’s arguments. While they were thus seated upon the trunk of the\ntree, their discourse was interrupted by the note, apparently, of a\nquail not far off.",
        "“Listen,” said the boy, as a second note answered the first; “do you\nhear that?”",
        "“Yes,” was the reply, and, after a few moments’ silence, “do you not\nhear a rustling among the branches of the tree yonder?”",
        "“Perhaps it is a squirrel–but look! what is that? Surely I saw\nsomething red among the branches. It looked like a fawn popping up its\nhead.”",
        "At this moment, the children, who had been gazing so intently in the\ndirection of the fallen tree that all other objects were forgotten, felt\nthemselves seized from behind and pinioned in an iron grasp. What were\ntheir horror and dismay to find themselves in the arms of savages, whose\nterrific countenances and gestures plainly showed them to be enemies!",
        "They made signs to the children to be silent, on pain of death, and\nhurried them off, half dead with terror, in a direction leading from\ntheir father’s habitation. After travelling some distance in profound\nsilence, the severity of their captors somewhat relaxed, and as night\napproached the party halted, after adopting the usual precautions to\nsecure themselves against a surprise.",
        "In an agony of uncertainty and terror, torn from their beloved home and\nparents, and anticipating all the horrors with which the rumors of the\ntimes had invested a captivity among the Indians–perhaps even a\ntorturing death–the poor children could no longer restrain their grief,\nbut gave vent to sobs and lamentations.",
        "Their distress appeared to excite the compassion of one of the party, a\nman of mild aspect, who approached and endeavored to soothe them. He\nspread them a couch of the long grass which grew near the\nencamping-place, offered them a portion of his own stock of dried meat\nand parched corn, and gave them to understand by signs that no farther\nevil was intended them.",
        "These kindly demonstrations were interrupted by the arrival of another\nparty of the enemy, bringing with them the mother of the little\nprisoners, with her youngest child, an infant of three months old.",
        "It had so happened that the father of the family, with his serving-men,\nhad gone early in the day to a raising at a few miles’ distance, and\nthe house had thus been left without a defender. The long period of\ntranquillity which they had enjoyed, free from all molestation or alarm\nfrom the savages, had thrown the settlers quite off their guard, and\nthey had recently laid aside some of the caution they had formerly\ndeemed necessary.",
        "These Indians, by lying in wait, had found the favorable moment for\nseizing the defenceless family and making them prisoners. Judging from\ntheir paint, and other marks by which the early settlers learned to\ndistinguish the various tribes, Mrs. Lytle conjectured that those into\nwhose hands she and her children had fallen were Senecas. Nor was she\nmistaken. It was a party of that tribe who had descended from their\nvillage with the intention of falling upon some isolated band of their\nenemies, the Delawares, but failing in this, had made themselves amends\nby capturing a few white settlers.",
        "It is to be attributed to the generally mild disposition of this tribe,\ntogether with the magnanimous character of the chief who accompanied the\nparty, that their prisoners in the present instance escaped the fate of\nmost of the Americans who were so unhappy as to fall into the hands of\nthe Iroquois.",
        "The children learned from their mother that she was profoundly ignorant\nof the fate of their remaining brother and sister, a boy of six and a\nlittle girl of four years of age, but she was in hopes they had made\ngood their escape with the servant-girl, who had likewise disappeared\nfrom the commencement.",
        "After remaining a few hours to recruit the exhausted frames of the\nprisoners, the savages again started on their march, one of the older\nIndians offering to relieve the mother from the burden of her infant,\nwhich she had hitherto carried in her arms. Pleased with the unexpected\nkindness, she resigned to him her tender charge.",
        "Thus they pursued their way, the savage who carried the infant lingering\nsomewhat behind the rest of the party, until, finding a spot convenient\nfor his purpose, he grasped his innocent victim by the feet, and, with\none whirl, to add strength to the blow, dashed out its brains against a\ntree. Leaving the body upon the spot, he rejoined the party.",
        "The mother, unsuspicious of what had passed, regarded him earnestly as\nhe reappeared without the child–then gazed wildly around on the rest of\nthe group. Her beloved little one was not there. Its absence spoke its\nfate; but, suppressing the shriek of agony, for she knew that the lives\nof the remaining ones depended upon her firmness in that trying hour,\nshe drew them yet closer to her and pursued her melancholy way without a\nword spoken or a question asked.",
        "From the depths of her heart she cried unto Him who is able to save, and\nHe comforted her with hopes of deliverance for the surviving ones, for\nshe saw that if blood had been their sole object the scalps of herself\nand her children would have been taken upon the spot where they were\nmade prisoners.",
        "She read too in the eyes of one who was evidently the commander of the\nparty an expression more merciful than she had even dared to hope.\nParticularly had she observed his soothing manner and manifest\npartiality towards her eldest child, the little girl of whom we have\nspoken, and she built many a bright hope of escape or ransom upon these\nslender foundations.",
        "After a toilsome and painful march of many days, the party reached the\nSeneca village, upon the head-waters of the Alleghany, near what is now\ncalled Olean Point. On their arrival the chief, their conductor, who was\ndistinguished by the name of the Big White Man[42] led his prisoners\nto the principal lodge. This was occupied by his mother, the widow of\nthe head-chief of that band, and who was called by them the Old Queen.",
        "On entering her presence, her son presented her the little girl,\nsaying,–",
        "“My mother, I bring you a child to supply the place of my brother, who\nwas killed by the Lenape six moons ago. She shall dwell in my lodge, and\nbe to me a sister. Take the white woman and her children and treat them\nkindly–our father will give us many horses and guns to buy them back\nagain.”",
        "He referred to the British Indian Agent of his tribe, Colonel Johnson,\nan excellent and benevolent gentleman, who resided at Port Niagara, on\nthe British side of the river of that name.",
        "The old queen fulfilled the injunctions of her son. She received the\nprisoners, and every comfort was provided them that her simple and\nprimitive mode of life rendered possible.",
        "We must now return to the place and period at which our story commences.",
        "Late in the evening of that day the father returned to his dwelling. All\nwithin and around was silent and desolate. No trace of a living creature\nwas to be found throughout the house or grounds. His nearest neighbors\nlived at a considerable distance, but to them he hastened, frantically\ndemanding tidings of his family.",
        "As he aroused them from their slumbers, one and another joined him in\nthe search, and at length, at the house of one of them, was found the\nservant-maid who had effected her escape. Her first place of refuge, she\nsaid, had been a large brewing-tub in an outer kitchen, under which she\nhad, at the first alarm, secreted herself until the departure of the\nIndians, who were evidently in haste, gave her an opportunity of fleeing\nto a place of safety. She could give no tidings of her mistress and the\nchildren, except that they had not been murdered in her sight or\nhearing.",
        "At length, having scoured the neighborhood without success, Mr. Lytle\nremembered an old settler who lived alone, far up the valley. Thither he\nand his friends immediately repaired, and from him they learned that,\nbeing at work in his field just before sunset, he had seen a party of\nstrange Indians passing at a short distance from his cabin. As they\nwound along the brow of the hill, he could perceive that they had\nprisoners with them–a woman and a child. The woman he knew to be a\nwhite, as she carried her infant in her arms, instead of upon her back,\nafter the manner of the savages.",
        "Day had now begun to break, for the night had been passed in fruitless\nsearches, and the agonized father, after a consultation with his kind\nfriends and neighbors, accepted their offer to accompany him to Fort\nPitt to ask advice and assistance of the commandant and Indian Agent at\nthat place.",
        "Proceeding down the valley, as they approached a hut which the night\nbefore they had found apparently deserted, they were startled by\nobserving two children standing upon the high bank in front of it. The\ndelighted father recognized two of his missing flock, but no tidings\ncould they give him of their mother and the other lost ones. Their story\nwas simple and touching.",
        "They were playing in the garden, when they were alarmed by seeing the\nIndians enter the yard near the house. Unperceived by them, the brother,\nwho was but six years of age, helped his little sister over the fence\ninto a field overrun with bushes of the blackberry and wild raspberry.\nThey concealed themselves among these for awhile, and then, finding all\nquiet, they attempted to force their way to the side of the field\nfarthest from the house. Unfortunately, the little girl in her play in\nthe garden had pulled off her shoes and stockings, and the briers\ntearing and wounding her tender feet, she with difficulty could refrain\nfrom crying out. Her brother took off his stockings and put them on her\nfeet. He attempted, too, to protect them with his shoes, but they were\ntoo large, and kept slipping off, so that she could not wear them. For a\ntime, they persevered in making what they considered their escape from\ncertain death, for, as I have said, the children had been taught, by the\ntales they had heard, to regard all strange Indians as ministers of\ntorture, and of horrors worse than death. Exhausted with pain and\nfatigue, the poor little girl at length declared she could go no\nfarther.",
        "“Then, Maggie,” said her brother, “I must kill you, for I cannot let\nyou be killed by the Indians.”",
        "“Oh, no, Thomas!” pleaded she, “do not, pray do not kill me! I do not\nthink the Indians will find us.”",
        "“Oh, yes, they will, Maggie, and I could kill you so much easier than\nthey would.’”",
        "For a long time he endeavored to persuade her, and even looked about for\na stick sufficiently large for his purpose; but despair gave the little\ncreature strength, and she promised her brother that she would neither\ncomplain nor falter, if he would assist her in making her way out of the\nfield.",
        "The idea of the little boy that he could save his sister from savage\nbarbarity by taking her life himself, shows what tales of horror the\nchildren of the early settlers were familiar with.",
        "After a few more efforts, they made their way out of the field, into an\nuninclosed pasture-ground, where, to their great delight, they saw some\ncows feeding. They recognized them as belonging to Granny Myers, an old\nwoman who lived at some little distance, but in what direction from the\nplace they then were, they were utterly ignorant.",
        "With a sagacity beyond his years, the boy said,–",
        "“Let us hide ourselves till sunset, when the cows will go home, and we\nwill follow them.”",
        "They did so, but, to their dismay, when they reached Granny Myers’s they\nfound the house deserted. The old woman had been called by some business\ndown the valley, and did not return that night.",
        "Tired and hungry, they could go no farther, but, after an almost\nfruitless endeavor to get some milk from the cows, they laid themselves\ndown to sleep under an old bedstead that stood behind the house. Their\nfather and his party had caused them additional terror in the night. The\nshouts and calls which had been designed to arouse the inmates of the\nhouse, they had mistaken for the whoop of the Indians, and, not being\nable to distinguish friends from foes, they had crept close to one\nanother, as far out of sight as possible. When found the following\nmorning, they were debating what course to take next, for safety.",
        "The commandant at Fort Pitt entered warmly into the affairs of Mr.\nLytle, and readily furnished him with a detachment of soldiers, to aid\nhim and his friends in the pursuit of the marauders. Some circumstances\nhaving occurred to throw suspicion upon the Senecas, the party soon\ndirected their search among the villages of that tribe.",
        "Their inquiries were prosecuted in various directions, and always with\ngreat caution, for all the tribes of the Iroquois, or, as they pompously\ncalled themselves, the Five Nations, being allies of Great Britain, were\ninveterate in their hostility to the Americans. Thus, some time elapsed\nbefore the father with his attendants reached the village of the Big\nWhite Man.",
        "A treaty was immediately entered into for the ransom of the captives,\nwhich was easily accomplished in regard to Mrs. Lytle and the younger\nchild. But no offers, no entreaties, no promises, could procure the\nrelease of the little Eleanor, the adopted child of the tribe. “No,” the\nchief said, “she was his sister; he had taken her to supply the place of\nhis brother who was killed by the enemy–she was dear to him, and he\nwould not part with her.”",
        "Finding every effort unavailing to shake this resolution, the father was\ncompelled to take his sorrowful departure with such of his beloved ones\nas he had had the good fortune to recover.",
        "We will not attempt to depict the grief of parents compelled thus to\ngive up a darling child, and to leave her in the hands of savages, whom\nuntil now they had too much reason to regard as merciless. But there was\nno alternative. Commending her to the care of their heavenly Father, and\ncheered by the manifest tenderness with which she had thus far been\ntreated, they set out on their melancholy journey homeward, trusting\nthat some future effort would be more effectual for the recovery of\ntheir little girl.",
        "Having placed his family in safety at Pittsburg, Mr. Lytle, still\nassisted by the commandant and the Indian Agent, undertook an expedition\nto the frontier to the residence of the British Agent, Colonel Johnson.\nHis representation of the case warmly interested the feelings of that\nbenevolent officer, who promised him to spare no exertions in his\nbehalf. This promise he religiously performed. He went in person to the\nvillage of the Big White Man, as soon as the opening of the spring\npermitted, and offered him many splendid presents of guns and horses,\nbut the chief was inexorable.",
        "Time rolled on, and every year the hope of recovering the little captive\nbecame more faint. She, in the mean time, continued to wind herself more\nand more closely around the heart of her Indian brother. Nothing could\nexceed the consideration and affection with which she was treated, not\nonly by himself, but by his mother, the Old Queen. All their stock of\nbrooches and wampum was employed in the decoration of her person. The\nprincipal seat and the most delicate viands were invariably reserved for\nher, and no efforts were spared to promote her happiness, and to render\nher forgetful of her former home and kindred.",
        "Thus, though she had beheld, with a feeling almost amounting to despair,\nthe departure of her parents and dear little brother, and had for a long\ntime resisted every attempt at consolation, preferring even death to a\nlife of separation from all she loved, yet time, as it ever does,\nbrought its soothing balm, and she at length grew contented and happy.",
        "From her activity and the energy of her character, qualities for which\nshe was remarkable to the latest period of her life, the name was given\nher of The Ship under full sail.",
        "The only drawback to the happiness of the little prisoner, aside from\nher longings after her own dear home, was the enmity she encountered\nfrom the wife of the Big White Man. This woman, from the day of her\narrival at the village, and adoption into the family as a sister, had\nconceived for her the greatest animosity, which, at first, she had the\nprudence to conceal from the observation of her husband.",
        "It was perhaps natural that a wife should give way to some feelings of\njealousy at seeing her own place in the heart of her husband usurped by\nthe child of their enemy, the American. But these feelings were\naggravated by a bad and vindictive temper, and by the indifference with\nwhich her husband listened to her complaints and murmurings.",
        "As she had no children of her own to engage her attention, her mind was\nthe more engrossed and inflamed with her fancied wrongs, and with\ndevising means for their redress. An opportunity of attempting the\nlatter was not long wanting.",
        "During the absence of the Big White Man upon some war-party or\nhunting-excursion, his little sister was taken ill with fever and ague.\nShe was nursed with the utmost tenderness by the Old Queen; and the wife\nof the chief, to lull suspicion, and thereby accomplish her purpose,\nwas likewise unwearied in her assiduities to the little favorite.",
        "One afternoon, during the temporary absence of the Old Queen, her\ndaughter-in-law entered the lodge with a bowl of something she had\nprepared, and, stooping down to the mat on which the child lay, said, in\nan affectionate accent,–",
        "“Drink, my sister, I have brought you that which will drive this fever\nfar from you.”",
        "On raising her head to reply, the little girl perceived a pair of eyes\npeeping through a crevice in the lodge, and fixed upon her with a very\npeculiar and significant expression. With the quick perception acquired\npartly from nature and partly from her intercourse with this people, she\nreplied, faintly,–",
        "“Set it down, my sister. When this fit of the fever has passed, I will\ndrink your medicine.”",
        "The squaw, too cautious to use importunity, busied herself about in the\nlodge for a short time, then withdrew to another, near at hand.\nMeantime, the bright eyes continued peering through the opening, until\nthey had watched their object fairly out of sight; then a low voice, the\nvoice of a young friend and playfellow, spoke:",
        "“Do not drink that which your brother’s wife has brought you. She hates\nyou, and is only waiting an opportunity to rid herself of you. I have\nwatched her all the morning, and have seen her gathering the most deadly\nroots and herbs. I knew for whom they were intended, and came hither to\nwarn you.”",
        "“Take the bowl,” said the little invalid, “and carry it to my mother’s\nlodge.”",
        "This was accordingly done. The contents of the bowl were found to\nconsist principally of a decoction of the root of the May-apple, the\nmost deadly poison known among the Indians.",
        "It is not in the power of language to describe the indignation that\npervaded the little community when this discovery was made known. The\nsquaws ran to and fro, as is their custom when excited, each vying with\nthe other in heaping invectives upon the culprit. No further punishment\nwas, however, for the present inflicted upon her, but, the first burst\nof rage over, she was treated with silent abhorrence.",
        "The little patient was removed to the lodge of the Old Queen, and\nstrictly guarded, while her enemy was left to wander in silence and\nsolitude about the fields and woods, until the return of her husband\nshould determine her punishment.",
        "In a few days, the excursion being over, the Big White Man and his party\nreturned to the village. Contrary to the usual custom of savages, he did\nnot, in his first transport at learning the attempt on the life of his\nlittle sister, take summary vengeance on the offender. He contented\nhimself with banishing her from his lodge, never to return, and\ncondemning her to hoe corn in a distant part of the large field or\ninclosure which served the whole community for a garden.",
        "Although she would still show her vindictive disposition whenever, by\nchance, the little girl with her companions wandered into that vicinity,\nby striking at her with her hoe, or by some other spiteful\nmanifestation, yet she was either too well watched, or stood too much in\nawe of her former husband, to repeat the attempt upon his sister’s life.",
        "Four years had now elapsed since the capture of little Nelly. Her heart\nwas by nature warm and affectionate, so that the unbounded tenderness of\nthose she dwelt among had called forth a corresponding feeling in her\nheart. She regarded the chief and his mother with love and reverence,\nand had so completely learned their language and customs as almost to\nhave forgotten her own.",
        "So identified had she become with the tribe, that the remembrance of her\nhome and family had nearly faded from her memory; all but her\nmother–her mother, whom she had loved with a strength of affection\nnatural to her warm and ardent character, and to whom her heart still\nclung with a fondness that no time or change could destroy.",
        "The peace of 1783 between Great Britain and the United States now took\nplace. A general pacification of the Indian tribes was the consequence,\nand fresh hopes were renewed in the bosoms of Mr. and Mrs. Lytle.",
        "They removed with their family to Fort Niagara, near which, on the\nAmerican side, was the Great Council-Fire of the Senecas. Colonel\nJohnson readily undertook a fresh negotiation with the chief, but, in\norder to make sure every chance of success, he again proceeded in person\nto the village of the Big White Man.",
        "His visit was most opportune. It was the “Feast of the Green Corn,” when\nhe arrived among them. This observance, which corresponds so strikingly\nwith the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles that, together with other customs,\nit has led many to believe the Indian nations the descendants of the\nlost ten tribes of Israel, made it a season of general joy and\nfestivity. All other occupations were suspended to give place to social\nenjoyment in the open air or in arbors formed of the green branches of\nthe trees. Every one appeared in his gala-dress. That of the little\nadopted child consisted of a petticoat of blue broadcloth, bordered with\ngay-colored ribbons; a sack or upper garment of black silk, ornamented\nwith three rows of silver brooches, the centre ones from the throat to\nthe hem being of large size, and those from the shoulders down being no\nlarger than a shilling-piece, and set as closely as possible. Around\nher neck were innumerable strings of white and purple wampum–an Indian\nornament manufactured from the inner surface of the muscle-shell. Her\nhair was clubbed behind and loaded with beads of various colors.\nLeggings of scarlet cloth, and moccasins of deer-skin embroidered with\nporcupine-quills, completed her costume.",
        "Colonel Johnson was received with all the consideration due to his\nposition, and to the long friendship that had subsisted between him and\nthe tribe.",
        "Observing that the hilarity of the festival had warmed and opened all\nhearts, he took occasion in an interview with the chief to expatiate\nupon the parental affection which had led the father and mother of his\nlittle sister to give up their friends and home, and come hundreds of\nmiles away, in the single hope of sometimes looking upon and embracing\nher. The heart of the chief softened as he listened to this\nrepresentation, and he was induced to promise that at the Grand Council\nsoon to be held at Fort Niagara, on the British side of the river, he\nwould attend, bringing his little sister with him.",
        "He exacted a promise, however, from Colonel Johnson, that not only no\neffort should be made to reclaim the child, but that even no proposition\nto part with her should be offered him.",
        "The time at length arrived when, her heart bounding with joy, little\nNelly was placed on horseback to accompany her Indian brother to the\nGreat Council of the Senecas. She had promised him that she would never\nleave him without his permission, and he relied confidently on her word\nthus given.",
        "As the chiefs and warriors arrived in successive bands to meet their\nFather, the agent, at the council-fire, how did the anxious hearts of\nthe parents beat with alternate hope and fear! The officers of the fort\nhad kindly given them quarters for the time being, and the ladies, whose\nsympathies were strongly excited, had accompanied the mother to the\nplace of council, and joined in her longing watch for the first\nappearance of the band from the Alleghany River.",
        "At length they were discerned, emerging from the forest on the opposite\nor American side. Boats were sent across by the commanding officer, to\nbring the chief and his party. The father and mother, attended by all\nthe officers and ladies, stood upon the grassy bank awaiting their\napproach. They had seen at a glance that the little captive was with\nthem.",
        "When about to enter the boat, the chief said to some of his young men,\n“Stand here with the horses, and wait until I return.”",
        "He was told that the horses should be ferried across and taken care of.",
        "“No,” said he; “let them wait.”",
        "He held his darling by the hand until the river was passed–until the\nboat touched the bank–until the child sprang forward into the arms of\nthe mother from whom she had been so long separated.",
        "When the chief witnessed that outburst of affection, he could withstand\nno longer.",
        "“She shall go,” said he. “The mother must have her child again. I will\ngo back alone.”",
        "With one silent gesture of farewell he turned and stepped on board the\nboat. No arguments or entreaties could induce him to remain at the\ncouncil, but, having gained the other side of the Niagara, he mounted\nhis horse, and with his young men was soon lost in the depths of the\nforest.",
        "After a sojourn of a few weeks at Niagara, Mr. Lytle, dreading lest the\nresolution of the Big White Man should give way, and measures be taken\nto deprive him once more of his child, came to the determination of\nagain changing his place of abode. He therefore took the first\nopportunity of crossing Lake Erie with his family, and settled himself\nin the neighborhood of Detroit, where he continued afterwards to reside.",
        "Little Nelly saw her friend the chief no more, but she never forgot\nhim. To the day of her death she remembered with tenderness and\ngratitude her brother the Big White Man, and her friends and playfellows\namong the Senecas.",
