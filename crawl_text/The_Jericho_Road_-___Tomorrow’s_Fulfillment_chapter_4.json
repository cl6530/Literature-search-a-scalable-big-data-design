        "  *   *   In the long years liker must they grow;\n  The man be more of woman, she of man;\n  He gain in sweetness and in moral height,\n  Nor lose the wrestling thews that throw the world;\n  She mental breadth, nor fail in childward care–\n  Till at the last she set herself to man,\n  Like perfect music unto noble words;\n  And so these twain, upon the skirts of time,\n  Sit side by side, full summed in all their powers,\n  Self-reverent each and reverencing each.\n  Then reign the world’s great bridals, chaste and calm;\n  Then springs the crowning race of human kind.",
