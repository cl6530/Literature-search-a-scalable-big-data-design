        "Robert awoke the next morning, well physically, but depressed\nmentally. He believed that a great battle–and a great victory for the\nAnglo-American army–was coming, and he would have no part in it. The\nlosses of Braddock’s defeat and the taking of Fort William Henry by\nMontcalm would be repaired, once more the flag of his native land and\nof his ancestral land, would be triumphant, but he would be merely\na spectator, even if he were as much as that. It was a bitter\nreflection, and again he thought of escape. But no plan seemed\npossible. He was held as firmly in the center of an army, as if he\nwere in the jaws of a powerful vise. Nor was it possible for Tayoga,\nhowever great his skill and daring, to reach him there. He strove\nto be philosophical, but it is hard for youth to reconcile itself at\nfirst, though it may soon forget.",
        "Breakfast was given to him, and he was permitted to go outside the\ntent into a small open space, though not beyond. On all sides of him\nstretched the impassable lines of the French army. There were several\nother prisoners within the enclosure, a ranger, a hunter, and three or\nfour farmers who had been taken in forays farther south.",
        "The fresh air and the brilliant sunshine revived Robert’s spirits. He\nlooked eagerly about him, striving to divine the French intentions,\nbut he could make nothing of them. He knew, however, upon reflection,\nthat this would be so. The French would not put any prisoners in a\nposition to obtain information that would be of great value in the\npossible event of escape.",
        "He undertook to talk with the other prisoners, but they were a\nmelancholy lot, not to be cheered. They were all thinking of a long,\nin truth, an indefinite, imprisonment in Canada, and they mourned.\nMany people had been taken into Canada by French and Indians in former\nforays and had been lost forever.",
        "Robert turned away from his comrades and sat down on a stone, where\nhe speculated idly on what was passing about him. He believed that the\nFrench would withdraw to Crown Point, at least, and might retreat all\nthe way to Canada, leaving Lake Champlain, as well as Lake George, to\nthe complete control of the Anglo-American forces. He expected to see\npreparations to that effect, and, when he saw none, he concluded that\nthey were merely postponed for a day or two. So far as he could judge,\nthe aspect of the French army was leisurely. He did not observe any\nsigns of trepidation, but then, withdrawal was always easy in the\ngreat North American wilderness. There was yet plenty of time for it.",
        "He noticed a complete absence of Indians, and the fact struck him with\ngreat surprise. While he was advancing various theories to account\nfor it, young Captain Louis de Galissonnière came, and greeted him\ncordially.",
        "“I hope you understand that we French know how to treat a prisoner,\"\nhe said.",
        "“I’ve nothing of which to complain,” replied Robert. “This is the\nsecond time that I’ve been with you, and on this occasion, as on the\nfirst, I seem to be more of a guest than a captive.”",
        "“You’re the special prisoner of Colonel de St. Luc, who stands\nextremely high with the Marquis de Montcalm. The colonel wishes you to\nbe treated well and seems to favor you. Why is it?”",
        "“Frankly, I don’t know, but I learned long since that he was a most\nchivalrous foe. I suppose I am to be sent into Canada along with the\nother prisoners?”",
        "“I suppose so, but there is no way for you to go just now.”",
        "“Why can’t I go with your army?”",
        "“With our army?”",
        "“It retreats, of course, before our overwhelming force.”",
        "De Galissonnière laughed.",
        "“You are disposed to be facetious,” he said. “You will observe that we\nare not retreating. You see no preparations to do so, but that’s all\nI will tell you. More would be valuable information for the enemy,\nshould you escape.”",
        "“I’ve warned Colonel de St. Luc that I mean to escape in due time. I\ndon’t like to reject such noble hospitality as you’re showing me, but\nmy duty to my country demands it.”",
        "Robert was now in a most excellent humor. His sanguine temperament\nwas asserting itself to the full. What he wished to see he saw. He was\nslipping away from the French; and he was advancing with the English\nand Americans to a great and brilliant victory. His face was flushed\nand his eyes sparkled. De Galissonnière looked at him curiously, but\nsaid nothing.",
        "“I observe one very significant fact,” continued Robert.",
        "“What is that?”",
        "“I see no Indians, who are usually so numerous about your camps. You\nneedn’t tell me what has happened, but I’ve been among Indians a great\ndeal. I know their ways, and I’ll tell you. They see that yours is a\nlost cause, and they’ve deserted you. Now, isn’t that so?”",
        "The young Frenchman was silent, but it was the turn of his face to\nflush.",
        "“I didn’t expect you to answer me in words,” continued Robert,\ntriumphantly, “but I can see. The Indians never fight in a battle that\nthey consider lost before it’s joined, and you know as well as I do,\nCaptain de Galissonnière, that if the Marquis de Montcalm awaits our\nattack his army will be destroyed.”",
        "“I do not know it at all.”",
        "Then Robert felt ashamed because he had been led away by his\nenthusiasm, and apologized for a speech that might have seemed\nboastful to the young Frenchman, who had been so kind to him. But De\nGalissonnière, with his accustomed courtesy, said it was nothing, and\nwhen he left, presently, both were in the best of humors.",
        "Robert, convinced that he had been right about the Indians, watched\nfor them as the morning went on, but he never saw a single warrior.\nThere could be no doubt now that they had gone, and while he could not\nconsider them chivalric they were at least wise.",
        "The next familiar face that he beheld was one far from welcome to him.\nIt was that of a man who happened to pass near the enclosure and who\nstopped suddenly when he caught sight of Robert. He was in civilian\ndress, but he was none other than Achille Garay, that spy whose secret\nmessage had been wrested from him in the forest by Robert and Tayoga.",
        "The gaze that Garay bent upon Robert was baleful. His capture by the\nthree and the manner in which he had been compelled to disclose the\nletter had been humiliating, and Robert did not doubt that the man\nwould seek revenge. He shivered a little, feeling that as a prisoner\nhe was in a measure helpless. Then his back stiffened.",
        "“I’m glad to see, Garay, that you’re where you belong–with the\nFrench,” he called out. “I hope you didn’t suffer any more from hunger\nin the woods when Willet, the Onondaga and I let you go.”",
        "The spy came closer, and his look was so full of venom that young\nLennox, despite himself, shuddered.",
        "“Time makes all things even,” he said. “I don’t forget how you and\nyour friends held me in your power in the forest, but here you are a\nprisoner. I have a good chance to make the score even.”",
        "Robert remembered also how this man had attempted his life in Albany,\nfor some reason that he could not yet fathom, and he felt that he\nwas now, and, in very truth, a most dangerous enemy. Nevertheless, he\nreplied, quietly:",
        "“That was an act of war. You were carrying a message for the enemy.\nWe were wholly within our rights when we forced you to disclose the\npaper.”",
        "“It makes no difference,” said Garay. “I owe you and your comrades a\ndebt and I shall pay it.”",
        "Robert turned his back on him and walked to the other side of the\nenclosure. When he turned around, five minutes later, Garay was gone.\nBut Robert felt uncomfortable. Here was a man who did not have the\ngallantry and chivalry that marked so many of the French. If he could\nhe would strike some great blow.",
        "He strove to dismiss Garay from his mind, and, in his interest in what\nwas going on about him, he finally succeeded. He saw Frenchmen and\nCanadians leaving the camp and others returning. His knowledge of war\nmade him believe that those coming had been messengers sent forth to\nwatch the Anglo-American army, and those going were dispatched on the\nsame service. Their alarm must be great, he reflected pleasantly,\nand none could bring to Montcalm any reassuring news. Once he saw\nMontcalm, and once St. Luc, but neither spoke to him.",
        "He and his comrades, the other prisoners, slept that night in the\nopen, the weather being warm. A blanket was allotted to every one by\ntheir captors, and Robert, long used to unlimited fresh air, preferred\nthe outside to the inside of a tent. Nothing disturbed his slumbers,\nbut he expected that the French retreat would begin the next day. On\nthe contrary, Montcalm stayed in his camp, nor was there any sign of\nwithdrawal on the second and third days, or on others that came. He\ninferred then that the advance of Abercrombie had been delayed,\nand the French were merely hanging on until their retreat became\ncompulsory.",
        "He had been in the camp about a week, and as he saw no more of Garay\nhe concluded that the man had been sent away on some errand. It\nwas highly probable that he was now in the south spying upon the\nAnglo-American army. It was for just such duties that he was fitted.\nThen he began to think of him less and less.",
        "His old impatience and keen disappointment because he was a prisoner\nwhen such great days were coming, returned with doubled vigor. He\nchafed greatly and looked around again for an opportunity to escape,\nbut did not see the remotest possibility of it. After all, he must\nreconcile himself. His situation could be far worse. He was well\ntreated, and some of the French leaders, while official enemies, were\npersonal friends.",
        "His mind also dwelled upon the singular fact that the French army did\nnot retreat. He tried to glean something from De Galissonnière, who\ntalked with him several times, but the young captain would not depart\nfrom generalities. He invariably shut up, tight, when they approached\nany detail of the present military situation.",
        "A dark night came with much wind and threat of rain. Robert thought\nthat he and his fellow captives would have to ask the shelter of\ntents, but the rain passed farther to the west, though the heavy\ndarkness remained. He was glad, as the weather was now oppressively\nwarm, and he greatly preferred to sleep on a blanket in the open air.",
        "The night was somewhat advanced when he lay down. The other prisoners\nwere asleep already. He had not found any kindred minds among them,\nand, as they were apathetic, he had not talked with them much. Now,\nhe did not miss them at all as he lay on his blanket and watched the\nwavering lights of the camp. It was still quite dark, with a moaning\nwind, but his experience of weather told him that the chance of\nrain was gone. Far in the west, lightning flickered and low thunder\ngrumbled there now and then, but in the camp everything was dry. Owing\nto the warmth, the fires used for cooking had been permitted to burn\nout, and the whole army seemed at peace.",
        "Robert himself shared this feeling of rest. The storm, passing so far\naway, soothed and lulled him. It was pleasant to lie there, unharmed,\nand witness its course at a far point. He dozed a while, fell asleep,\nand awoke again in half an hour. Nothing had changed. There was still\nan occasional flicker of lightning and mutter of thunder and the\ndarkness remained heavy. He could dimly see the forms of his comrades\nlying on their blankets. Not one of them stirred. They slept heavily\nand he rather envied them. They had little imagination, and, when one\nwas in bad case, he was lucky to be without it.",
        "The figure lying nearest him he took to be that of the hunter, a\ntaciturn man who talked least of them all, and again Robert felt envy\nbecause he could lose all care so thoroughly and so easily in sleep.\nThe man was as still and unconcerned as one of the mountain peaks that\nlooked down upon them. He would imitate him, and although sleep might\nbe unwilling, he would conquer it. A resolute mind could triumph over\nanything.",
        "He shut his eyes and his will was so strong that he held them shut\na full ten minutes, although sleep did not come. When he opened them\nagain he thought that the hunter had moved a little. After all, the\nman was mortal, and had human emotions. He was not an absolute log.",
        "“Tilden!” he called–Tilden was the hunter’s name.",
        "But Tilden did not stir, nor did he respond in any way when he called\na second time. He had been mistaken. He had given the man too much\ncredit. He was really a log, a dull, apathetic fellow to whom the\nextraordinary conditions around them made no appeal. He would not\nspeak to him again as long as they were prisoners together, and,\nclosing his eyes anew, he resolutely wooed slumber once more.",
        "Robert’s hearing was not so wonderfully keen as Tayoga’s, but it was\nvery keen, nevertheless, and as he lay, eyes shut, something impinged\nupon the drums of his ears. It was faint, but it did not seem to be a\npart of the usual sounds of the night. His ear at once registered an\nalarm on his brain.",
        "His eyes opened. The man whom he had taken to be the hunter was\nbending over him, and, dark though it was, he distinctly saw the gleam\nof a knife in his hand. His first feeling, passing in a flash, was one\nof vague wonderment that anybody should menace him in such a manner,\nand then he saw the lowering face of Garay. He had been a fool to\nforget him. With a convulsive and powerful effort he threw his body to\none side, and, when the knife fell, the blade missed him by an inch.",
        "Then Robert sprang to his feet, but Garay, uttering an angry\nexclamation at his missed stroke, did not attempt another. Instead,\nagile as a cat, he ran lightly away, and disappeared in the darkness\nof the camp. Robert sat down, somewhat dazed. It had all been an\naffair of a minute, and it was hard for him to persuade himself that\nit was real. His comrades still slept soundly, and the camp seemed as\npeaceful as ever.",
        "For a time Robert could not decide what to do. He knew that he had\nbeen threatened by a formidable danger, and that instinct, more than\nanything else, had saved him. He was almost prepared to believe that\nTayoga’s Tododaho, looking down from his remote star, had intervened\nin his behalf.",
        "The question solved itself. Although he knew that Garay had made\na foul attempt upon his life he had no proof. His story would seem\nhighly improbable. Moreover, he was a prisoner, while Garay was one\nof the French. Nobody would believe his tale. He must keep quiet and\nwatch. He was glad to see that the night was now lightening. Garay\nwould not come back then, at least. But Robert was sure that he would\nrepeat the attack some time or other. Revenge was a powerful motive,\nand he undoubtedly had another as strong. He must guard against Garay\nwith all his five senses.",
        "The night continued to brighten. The lightning ceased to flicker,\nthe storm had blown itself out in the distance, and a fine moon and a\nmyriad of stars came out. Things in the camp became clearly visible,\nand, feeling that Garay would attempt nothing more at such a time,\nRobert closed his eyes again. He soon slept, and did not awaken until\nall the other prisoners were up.",
        "“Mr. Tilden,” he said to the hunter, “I offer you my sincere\napologies.”",
        "“Apologies,” said the hunter in surprise. “What for?”",
        "“Because I mistook a much worse man for you. You didn’t know anything\nabout it at the time, but I did it, and I’m sorry I wronged you so\nmuch, even in thought.”",
        "The hunter touched his forehead. Clearly the misfortunes of the young\nprisoner were weighing too heavily upon him. One must endure captivity\nbetter than that.",
        "“Don’t take it so hard, Mr. Lennox,” he said. “It’s not like being in\nthe hands of the Indians, and there is always the chance of escape.”",
        "De Galissonnière visited him again that morning, and Robert, true to\nhis resolution, said nothing of Garay. The captain did not speak of\nthe Anglo-American army, but Robert judged from his manner that he was\nhighly expectant. Surely, Abercrombie was about to advance, and\nthe retreat of Montcalm could not be more than a day away. De\nGalissonnière stayed only ten minutes, and then Robert was left to his\nown devices. He tried to talk to Tilden, but the hunter lapsed again\ninto an apathetic state, and, having little success, he fell back on\nhis own thoughts and what his eyes might behold.",
        "In the afternoon he saw Montcalm at some distance, talking with St.\nLuc and Bourlamaque, and then he saw a man whose appearance betokened\nhaste and anxiety approach them. Robert did not know it then, but it\nwas the able and daring French partisan, Langy, and he came out of the\nforest with vital news.",
        "Meanwhile Langy saluted Montcalm with the great respect that his\nsuccesses had won from all the French. When the Marquis turned his\nkeen eye upon him he knew at once that his message, whatever it might\nbe, was of supreme importance.",
        "“What is it, Monsieur Langy?”",
        "“A report on the movements of the enemy.”",
        "“Come to my tent and tell me of it fully, and do you, St. Luc and\nBourlamaque, come with me also. You should hear everything.”",
        "They went into the tent and all sat down. St. Luc’s eyes never left\nthe partisan, Langy. He saw that the man was full of his news, eager\nto tell it, and was impressed with its importance. He knew Langy even\nbetter than Montcalm did. Few were more skillful in the forest, and he\nhad a true sense of proportion that did not desert him under stress.\nHis eyes traveled over the partisan’s attire, and there his own great\nskill as a ranger told him much. His garments were disarranged. Burrs\nand one or two little twigs were clinging to them. Obviously he had\ncome far and in haste. The thoughts of St. Luc, and, in truth, the\nthoughts of all of them, went to the Anglo-American army.",
        "“Speak, Monsieur Langy,” said Montcalm. “I can see that you have come\nswiftly, and you would not come so without due cause.”",
        "“I wish to report to you, sir,” said Langy, “that the entire army of\nthe enemy is now embarked on the Lake of the Holy Sacrament, and is\nadvancing against us.”",
        "Montcalm’s eyes sparkled. His warlike soul leaped up at the thought of\nspeedy battle that was being offered. A flame was lighted also in\nSt. Luc’s blood, and Bourlamaque was no less eager. It was no lack of\nvalor and enterprise that caused the French to lose their colonies in\nNorth America.",
        "“You know this positively?” asked the commander-in-chief.",
        "“I have seen it with my own eyes.”",
        "“Tell it as you saw it.”",
        "“I lay in the woods above the lake with my men, and I saw the British\nand Americans go into their boats, a vast flock of them. They are all\nafloat on the lake at this moment, and are coming against us.”",
        "“Could you make a fair estimate of their numbers?”",
        "“I obtained the figures with much exactitude from one or two\nstragglers that we captured on the land. My eyes confirm these\nfigures. There are about seven thousand of the English regulars, and\nabout nine thousand of the American colonials.”",
        "“So many as that! Five to one!”",
        "“You tell us they are all in boats,” said St. Luc. “How many of these\nboats contain their artillery?”",
        "“They have not yet embarked the cannon. As nearly as we can gather,\nthe guns will not come until the army is at Ticonderoga.”",
        "“What?”",
        "“It is as I tell you,” replied Langy to St. Luc. “The guns cannot come\nup the lake until a day or two after the army is landed. Their\nforce is so great that they do not seem to think they will need the\nartillery.”",
        "St. Luc, his face glowing, turned to Montcalm.",
        "“Sir,” he said, “I made to you the prophecy that some chance, some\nglorious chance, would yet help us, and that chance has come. Their\nvery strength has betrayed them into an error that may prove fatal.\nDespising us, they give us our opportunity. No matter how great the\nodds, we can hold earthworks and abattis against them, unless they\nbring cannon, or, at least we may make a great attempt at it.”",
        "The swarthy face of Montcalm was illumined by the light from his eyes.",
        "“I verily believe that your gallant soul speaks truth, Chevalier de\nSt. Luc!” he exclaimed. “I said once that we would stand and I say it\nagain. We’ll put all to the hazard. Since they come without cannon\nwe do have our chance. Go, Langy, and take your needed rest. You have\nserved us well. And now we’ll have the others here and talk over our\npreparations.”",
        "The engineers Lotbiniére and Le Mercier were, as before, zealous\nfor battle at Ticonderoga, and their opinion counted for much with\nMontcalm. De Levis, held back by the vacillating Vaudreuil, had not\nyet come from Montreal, and the swiftest of the Canadian paddlers was\nsent down Lake Ticonderoga in a canoe to hurry him on. Then the entire\nbattalion of Berry went to work at once with spade and pick and ax\nto prepare a breastwork and abattis, stretching a line of defense in\nfront of the fort, and not using the fort itself.",
        "Robert saw the Frenchmen attack the trees with their axes and the\nearth with their spades, and he divined at once the news that\nLangy had brought. The Anglo-American army was advancing. His heart\nthrobbed. Victory and rescue were at hand.",
        "“Mr. Tilden,” he said to the hunter, “listen to the ring of the ax and\nthe thud of the spade!”",
        "“Aye, I hear ’em,” was the apathetic reply; “but they don’t interest\nme. I’m a prisoner.”",
        "“But it may mean that you won’t be a prisoner much longer. The French\nare fortifying, and they’ve gone to work with so much haste and energy\nthat it shows an imminent need. There’s only one conclusion to be\ndrawn from it. They’re expecting our army and a prompt attack.”",
        "Tilden began to show interest.",
        "“On my life, I think you’re right,” he said.",
        "And yet Montcalm changed his mind again at the last moment. Two\nveteran officers, Montguy and Bernès, pointed out to him that his\npresent position was dominated by the adjacent heights, and in order\nto escape that danger he resolved to retreat a little. He broke up his\ncamp late in the afternoon of the next day, part of the army fell back\nthrough the woods more than a mile, and the rest of it withdrew in\nboats on the lake to the same point.",
        "Robert and his comrades were carried with the army on land to the\nfort. There he became separated from the others, and remained in the\nrear, but luckily for his wishes, on a mount where he could see most\nthat was passing, though his chance of escape was as remote as ever.",
        "He stood on the rocky peninsula of Ticonderoga. Behind him the great\nlake, Champlain, stretched far into north and south. To the west the\nground sloped gently upward a half mile and then sank again. On each\nside of the ridge formed thus was low ground, and the ridge presented\nitself at once to the military eye as a line of defense. Hugues, one\nof his officers, had already recommended it to Montcalm, and men under\ntwo of his engineers, Desandrouin and Pontleroy, were now at work\nthere.",
        "The final line of defense was begun at dawn, and Robert, whom no one\ndisturbed, witnessed a scene of prodigious energy. The whole French\narmy threw itself heart and soul into the task. The men, hot under the\nJuly sun, threw aside their coats, and the officers, putting their own\nhands to the work, did likewise. There was a continuous ring of axes,\nand the air resounded with the crash of trees falling in hundreds and\nthousands.",
        "The tops and ends of the boughs were cut off the trees, the ends left\nthus were sharpened and the trees were piled upon one another with the\nsharp ends facing the enemy who was to come.",
        "Robert watched as these bristling rows grew to a height of at least\nnine feet, and then he saw the men build on the inner side platforms\non which they could stand and fire over the crest, without exposing\nanything except their heads. In front of the abattis more trees with\nsharpened boughs were spread for a wide space, the whole field with\nits stumps and trees, looking as if a mighty hurricane had swept over\nit.",
        "Robert was soldier enough to see what a formidable obstruction was\nbeing raised, but he thought the powerful artillery of the attacking\narmy would sweep it away or level it. He did not know that the big\nguns were being left behind. In truth, Langy’s first news that the\ncannon would not be embarked upon the lake was partly wrong. The\nloading of the cannon was delayed, but after the British and Americans\nreached their landing and began the march across country for the\nattack, the guns, although brought down the lake, were left behind as\nnot needed. But the French knew all these movements, and whether the\ncannon were left at one point or another, it was just the same to\nthem, so long as they were not used in the assault.",
        "Robert’s intense mortification that he should be compelled to lie idle\nand witness the efforts of his enemies returned, but no matter how he\nchafed he could see no way out of it. Then his absorption in what was\ngoing on about him made him forget his personal fortunes.",
        "The setting for the great drama was wild and picturesque in the\nextreme. On one side stretched the long, gleaming lake, a lake of\nwildness and beauty associated with so much of romance and peril in\nAmerican story. Over them towered the crest of the peak later known\nas Defiance. To the south and west was Lake George, the Iroquois\nAndiatarocte, that gem of the east, and, on all sides, save Champlain,\ncircled the forest, just beginning to wither under the fierce summer\nsun.",
        "The energy of the French did not diminish. Stronger and stronger grew\nabattis and breastwork, the whole becoming a formidable field over\nwhich men might charge to death. But Robert only smiled to himself.\nAbercrombie’s mighty array of cannon would smash everything and then\nthe brave infantry, charging through the gaps, would destroy the\nFrench army. The French, he knew, were brave and skillful, but their\ndoom was sure. Once St. Luc spoke to him. The chevalier had thrown off\nhis coat also, and he had swung an ax with the best.",
        "“I am sorry, Mr. Lennox,” he said, “that we have not had time to send\nyou away, but as you can see, our operations are somewhat hurried.\nChance put you here, and here you will have to stay until all is\nover.”",
        "“I see that you are expecting an army,” said Robert, “and I infer from\nall these preparations that it will soon be upon you.”",
        "“It is betraying no military secret to admit that it is even so.\nAbercrombie will soon be at hand.”",
        "“And I am surprised that you should await him. I judge that he has\nsufficient force to overwhelm you.”",
        "“We are never beaten before battle. The Marquis de Montcalm would not\nstay, unless he had a fair chance of success.”",
        "Robert was silent and St. Luc quickly went back to his work. All day\nthe men toiled, and when the sun went down, they were still at their\ntask. The ring of axes and the crash of falling trees resounded\nthrough the dark. Part of the soldiers put their kettles and pots on\nthe fires, but the others labored on. In the night came the valiant\nDe Levis with his men, and Montcalm gave him a heartfelt welcome. De\nLevis was a host in himself, and Montcalm felt that he was just in\ntime. He expected the battle on the morrow. His scouts told him that\nAbercrombie would be at hand, but without his artillery. The Marquis\nlooked at the formidable abattis, the rows and rows of trees,\npresenting their myriad of spiked ends, and hope was alive in his\nheart. He regretted once more the absence of the Indians who had been\nled away by the sulky Tandakora, but victory, won with their help,\ndemanded a fearful price, as he had learned at William Henry.",
        "Montcalm, St. Luc, De Levis, Bourlamaque, Lotbiniére and other trusted\nofficers held a consultation far in the night. An important event\nhad occurred already. A scouting force of French and Canadians under\nTrepezec and Langy had been trapped by rangers under Rogers and troops\nunder Fitch and Lyman. The French and Canadians were cut to pieces,\nbut in the battle the gallant young Lord Howe, the real leader of the\nAnglo-American army, had been killed. He had gone forward with the\nvanguard, exposing himself rashly, perhaps, and his life was the\nforfeit. Immediate confusion in the Anglo-American councils followed,\nand Montcalm and his lieutenants had noticed the lack of precision and\ndirectness.",
        "Robert did not see the French officers going to the council, but\nhe knew that the French army meant to stay. Even while the men were\ncutting down the trees he could not persuade himself wholly that\nMontcalm would fight there at Ticonderoga, but as the night advanced\nhis last faint doubt disappeared. He would certainly witness a great\nbattle on the morrow.",
        "He could not sleep. Every nerve in him seemed to be alive. One vivid\npicture after another floated before his mind. The lake behind him\ngrew dim. Before him were the camp fires of the French, the wooden\nwall, the dark line of the forest and hills, and the crest of Defiance\nlooking solemnly down on them. Although held firmly there, within\nlines which one could not pass, nobody seemed to take any notice of\nhim. He could rest or watch as he chose, and he had no choice but to\nwatch.",
        "He saw the French lie down on their arms, save for the numerous\nsentinels posted everywhere, and after a while, though most of the\nnight was gone, the ring of axes and the fall of trees ceased.\nThere was a hum of voices but that too died in time, and long after\nmidnight, with his back against a tree, he dozed a little while.",
        "He was awakened by a premonition, a warning out of the dark, and\nopening his eyes he saw Garay slinking near. He did not know whether\nthe spy meant another attempt upon his life, but, standing up, he\nstared at him intently. Garay shrank away and disappeared in the\nfurther ranges of the camp. Robert somehow was not afraid. The man\nwould not make such a trial again at so great a risk, and his mind\nturned back to its preoccupation, the great battle that was coming.",
        "Near morning he dozed again for an hour or so, but he awoke before the\nsummer dawn. All his faculties were alive, and his body attuned when\nhe saw the sun rise, bringing with it the momentous day.",
