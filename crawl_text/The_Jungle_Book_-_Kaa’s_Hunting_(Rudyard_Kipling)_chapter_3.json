        "  His spots are the joy of the Leopard: his horns are the\n     Buffalo’s pride.\n  Be clean, for the strength of the hunter is known by the\n     gloss of his hide.\n  If ye find that the Bullock can toss you, or the heavy-browed\n     Sambhur can gore;\n  Ye need not stop work to inform us: we knew it ten seasons\n     before.\n  Oppress not the cubs of the stranger, but hail them as Sister\n     and Brother,\n  For though they are little and fubsy, it may be the Bear is\n     their mother.\n  “There is none like to me!” says the Cub in the pride of his\n     earliest kill;\n  But the jungle is large and the Cub he is small.  Let him\n     think and be still.\n                                 Maxims of Baloo",
        "All that is told here happened some time before Mowgli was turned\nout of the Seeonee Wolf Pack, or revenged himself on Shere Khan\nthe tiger.  It was in the days when Baloo was teaching him the Law\nof the Jungle.  The big, serious, old brown bear was delighted to\nhave so quick a pupil, for the young wolves will only learn as\nmuch of the Law of the Jungle as applies to their own pack and\ntribe, and run away as soon as they can repeat the Hunting Verse\n–\"Feet that make no noise; eyes that can see in the dark; ears\nthat can hear the winds in their lairs, and sharp white teeth, all\nthese things are the marks of our brothers except Tabaqui the\nJackal and the Hyaena whom we hate.”  But Mowgli, as a man-cub,\nhad to learn a great deal more than this.  Sometimes Bagheera the\nBlack Panther would come lounging through the jungle to see how\nhis pet was getting on, and would purr with his head against a\ntree while Mowgli recited the day’s lesson to Baloo.  The boy\ncould climb almost as well as he could swim, and swim almost as\nwell as he could run.  So Baloo, the Teacher of the Law, taught\nhim the Wood and Water Laws: how to tell a rotten branch from a\nsound one; how to speak politely to the wild bees when he came\nupon a hive of them fifty feet above ground; what to say to Mang\nthe Bat when he disturbed him in the branches at midday; and how\nto warn the water-snakes in the pools before he splashed down\namong them.  None of the Jungle People like being disturbed, and\nall are very ready to fly at an intruder.  Then, too, Mowgli was\ntaught the Strangers’ Hunting Call, which must be repeated aloud\ntill it is answered, whenever one of the Jungle-People hunts\noutside his own grounds.  It means, translated, “Give me leave to\nhunt here because I am hungry.”  And the answer is, “Hunt then for\nfood, but not for pleasure.”",
        "All this will show you how much Mowgli had to learn by heart,\nand he grew very tired of saying the same thing over a hundred\ntimes.  But, as Baloo said to Bagheera, one day when Mowgli had\nbeen cuffed and run off in a temper, “A man’s cub is a man’s cub,\nand he must learn all the Law of the Jungle.”",
        "“But think how small he is,” said the Black Panther, who would\nhave spoiled Mowgli if he had had his own way.  “How can his\nlittle head carry all thy long talk?”",
        "“Is there anything in the jungle too little to be killed?  No.\nThat is why I teach him these things, and that is why I hit him,\nvery softly, when he forgets.”",
        "“Softly!  What dost thou know of softness, old Iron-feet?\"\nBagheera grunted.  “His face is all bruised today by thy–\nsoftness.  Ugh.”",
        "“Better he should be bruised from head to foot by me who love\nhim than that he should come to harm through ignorance,” Baloo\nanswered very earnestly.  “I am now teaching him the Master Words\nof the Jungle that shall protect him with the birds and the Snake\nPeople, and all that hunt on four feet, except his own pack.  He\ncan now claim protection, if he will only remember the words, from\nall in the jungle.  Is not that worth a little beating?”",
        "“Well, look to it then that thou dost not kill the man-cub.\nHe is no tree trunk to sharpen thy blunt claws upon.  But what are\nthose Master Words?  I am more likely to give help than to ask it\"\n–Bagheera stretched out one paw and admired the steel-blue,\nripping-chisel talons at the end of it–\"still I should like to\nknow.”",
        "“I will call Mowgli and he shall say them–if he will.\nCome, Little Brother!”",
        "“My head is ringing like a bee tree,” said a sullen little\nvoice over their heads, and Mowgli slid down a tree trunk very\nangry and indignant, adding as he reached the ground: “I come for\nBagheera and not for thee, fat old Baloo!”",
        "“That is all one to me,” said Baloo, though he was hurt and\ngrieved.  “Tell Bagheera, then, the Master Words of the Jungle\nthat I have taught thee this day.”",
        "“Master Words for which people?” said Mowgli, delighted to\nshow off.  “The jungle has many tongues.  I know them all.”",
        "“A little thou knowest, but not much.  See, O Bagheera, they\nnever thank their teacher.  Not one small wolfling has ever come\nback to thank old Baloo for his teachings.  Say the word for the\nHunting-People, then–great scholar.”",
        "“We be of one blood, ye and I,” said Mowgli, giving the words\nthe Bear accent which all the Hunting People use.",
        "“Good.  Now for the birds.”",
        "Mowgli repeated, with the Kite’s whistle at the end of the\nsentence.",
        "“Now for the Snake-People,” said Bagheera.",
        "The answer was a perfectly indescribable hiss, and Mowgli\nkicked up his feet behind, clapped his hands together to applaud\nhimself, and jumped on to Bagheera’s back, where he sat sideways,\ndrumming with his heels on the glossy skin and making the worst\nfaces he could think of at Baloo.",
        "“There–there!  That was worth a little bruise,” said the\nbrown bear tenderly.  “Some day thou wilt remember me.”  Then he\nturned aside to tell Bagheera how he had begged the Master Words\nfrom Hathi the Wild Elephant, who knows all about these things,\nand how Hathi had taken Mowgli down to a pool to get the Snake\nWord from a water-snake, because Baloo could not pronounce it, and\nhow Mowgli was now reasonably safe against all accidents in the\njungle, because neither snake, bird, nor beast would hurt him.",
        "“No one then is to be feared,” Baloo wound up, patting his big\nfurry stomach with pride.",
        "“Except his own tribe,” said Bagheera, under his breath; and\nthen aloud to Mowgli, “Have a care for my ribs, Little Brother!\nWhat is all this dancing up and down?”",
        "Mowgli had been trying to make himself heard by pulling at\nBagheera’s shoulder fur and kicking hard.  When the two listened\nto him he was shouting at the top of his voice, “And so I shall\nhave a tribe of my own, and lead them through the branches all day\nlong.”",
        "“What is this new folly, little dreamer of dreams?” said\nBagheera.",
        "“Yes, and throw branches and dirt at old Baloo,” Mowgli went\non.  “They have promised me this.  Ah!”",
        "“Whoof!”  Baloo’s big paw scooped Mowgli off Bagheera’s back,\nand as the boy lay between the big fore-paws he could see the Bear\nwas angry.",
        "“Mowgli,” said Baloo, “thou hast been talking with the\nBandar-log–the Monkey People.”",
        "Mowgli looked at Bagheera to see if the Panther was angry too,\nand Bagheera’s eyes were as hard as jade stones.",
        "“Thou hast been with the Monkey People–the gray apes–the\npeople without a law–the eaters of everything.  That is great\nshame.”",
        "“When Baloo hurt my head,” said Mowgli (he was still on his\nback), “I went away, and the gray apes came down from the trees\nand had pity on me.  No one else cared.”  He snuffled a little.",
        "“The pity of the Monkey People!” Baloo snorted.  “The\nstillness of the mountain stream!  The cool of the summer sun!\nAnd then, man-cub?”",
        "“And then, and then, they gave me nuts and pleasant things to\neat, and they–they carried me in their arms up to the top of\nthe trees and said I was their blood brother except that I had no\ntail, and should be their leader some day.”",
        "“They have no leader,” said Bagheera.  “They lie.  They have\nalways lied.”",
        "“They were very kind and bade me come again.  Why have I never\nbeen taken among the Monkey People?  They stand on their feet as I\ndo.  They do not hit me with their hard paws.  They play all day.\nLet me get up!  Bad Baloo, let me up!  I will play with them\nagain.”",
        "“Listen, man-cub,” said the Bear, and his voice rumbled like\nthunder on a hot night.  “I have taught thee all the Law of the\nJungle for all the peoples of the jungle–except the Monkey-Folk\nwho live in the trees.  They have no law.  They are outcasts.\nThey have no speech of their own, but use the stolen words which\nthey overhear when they listen, and peep, and wait up above in\nthe branches.  Their way is not our way.  They are without\nleaders.  They have no remembrance.  They boast and chatter and\npretend that they are a great people about to do great affairs in\nthe jungle, but the falling of a nut turns their minds to laughter\nand all is forgotten.  We of the jungle have no dealings with\nthem.  We do not drink where the monkeys drink; we do not go where\nthe monkeys go; we do not hunt where they hunt; we do not die\nwhere they die.  Hast thou ever heard me speak of the Bandar-log\ntill today?”",
        "“No,” said Mowgli in a whisper, for the forest was very still\nnow Baloo had finished.",
        "“The Jungle-People put them out of their mouths and out of\ntheir minds.  They are very many, evil, dirty, shameless, and they\ndesire, if they have any fixed desire, to be noticed by the Jungle\nPeople.  But we do not notice them even when they throw nuts and\nfilth on our heads.”",
        "He had hardly spoken when a shower of nuts and twigs spattered\ndown through the branches; and they could hear coughings and\nhowlings and angry jumpings high up in the air among the thin\nbranches.",
        "“The Monkey-People are forbidden,” said Baloo, “forbidden to\nthe Jungle-People.  Remember.”",
        "“Forbidden,” said Bagheera, “but I still think Baloo should\nhave warned thee against them.”",
        "“I–I?  How was I to guess he would play with such dirt.\nThe Monkey People!  Faugh!”",
        "A fresh shower came down on their heads and the two trotted\naway, taking Mowgli with them.  What Baloo had said about the\nmonkeys was perfectly true.  They belonged to the tree-tops, and as\nbeasts very seldom look up, there was no occasion for the monkeys\nand the Jungle-People to cross each other’s path.  But whenever\nthey found a sick wolf, or a wounded tiger, or bear, the monkeys\nwould torment him, and would throw sticks and nuts at any beast\nfor fun and in the hope of being noticed.  Then they would howl\nand shriek senseless songs, and invite the Jungle-People to climb\nup their trees and fight them, or would start furious battles over\nnothing among themselves, and leave the dead monkeys where the\nJungle-People could see them.  They were always just going to have\na leader, and laws and customs of their own, but they never did,\nbecause their memories would not hold over from day to day, and so\nthey compromised things by making up a saying, “What the\nBandar-log think now the jungle will think later,” and that\ncomforted them a great deal.  None of the beasts could reach them,\nbut on the other hand none of the beasts would notice them, and\nthat was why they were so pleased when Mowgli came to play with\nthem, and they heard how angry Baloo was.",
        "They never meant to do any more–the Bandar-log never mean\nanything at all; but one of them invented what seemed to him a\nbrilliant idea, and he told all the others that Mowgli would be a\nuseful person to keep in the tribe, because he could weave sticks\ntogether for protection from the wind; so, if they caught him,\nthey could make him teach them.  Of course Mowgli, as a\nwoodcutter’s child, inherited all sorts of instincts, and used to\nmake little huts of fallen branches without thinking how he came\nto do it.  The Monkey-People, watching in the trees, considered\nhis play most wonderful.  This time, they said, they were really\ngoing to have a leader and become the wisest people in the jungle\n–so wise that everyone else would notice and envy them.\nTherefore they followed Baloo and Bagheera and Mowgli through the\njungle very quietly till it was time for the midday nap, and\nMowgli, who was very much ashamed of himself, slept between the\nPanther and the Bear, resolving to have no more to do with the\nMonkey People.",
        "The next thing he remembered was feeling hands on his legs and\narms–hard, strong, little hands–and then a swash of branches\nin his face, and then he was staring down through the swaying\nboughs as Baloo woke the jungle with his deep cries and Bagheera\nbounded up the trunk with every tooth bared.  The Bandar-log\nhowled with triumph and scuffled away to the upper branches where\nBagheera dared not follow, shouting: “He has noticed us!  Bagheera\nhas noticed us.  All the Jungle-People admire us for our skill and\nour cunning.”  Then they began their flight; and the flight of the\nMonkey-People through tree-land is one of the things nobody can\ndescribe.  They have their regular roads and crossroads, up hills\nand down hills, all laid out from fifty to seventy or a hundred\nfeet above ground, and by these they can travel even at night if\nnecessary.  Two of the strongest monkeys caught Mowgli under the\narms and swung off with him through the treetops, twenty feet at a\nbound.  Had they been alone they could have gone twice as fast,\nbut the boy’s weight held them back.  Sick and giddy as Mowgli was\nhe could not help enjoying the wild rush, though the glimpses of\nearth far down below frightened him, and the terrible check and\njerk at the end of the swing over nothing but empty air brought\nhis heart between his teeth.  His escort would rush him up a tree\ntill he felt the thinnest topmost branches crackle and bend under\nthem, and then with a cough and a whoop would fling themselves\ninto the air outward and downward, and bring up, hanging by their\nhands or their feet to the lower limbs of the next tree.\nSometimes he could see for miles and miles across the still green\njungle, as a man on the top of a mast can see for miles across the\nsea, and then the branches and leaves would lash him across the\nface, and he and his two guards would be almost down to earth\nagain.  So, bounding and crashing and whooping and yelling, the\nwhole tribe of Bandar-log swept along the tree-roads with Mowgli\ntheir prisoner.",
        "For a time he was afraid of being dropped.  Then he grew angry\nbut knew better than to struggle, and then he began to think.  The\nfirst thing was to send back word to Baloo and Bagheera, for, at\nthe pace the monkeys were going, he knew his friends would be left\nfar behind.  It was useless to look down, for he could only see\nthe topsides of the branches, so he stared upward and saw, far\naway in the blue, Rann the Kite balancing and wheeling as he kept\nwatch over the jungle waiting for things to die.  Rann saw that\nthe monkeys were carrying something, and dropped a few hundred\nyards to find out whether their load was good to eat.  He whistled\nwith surprise when he saw Mowgli being dragged up to a treetop and\nheard him give the Kite call for–\"We be of one blood, thou and\nI.”  The waves of the branches closed over the boy, but Chil\nbalanced away to the next tree in time to see the little brown\nface come up again.  “Mark my trail!” Mowgli shouted.  “Tell\nBaloo of the Seeonee Pack and Bagheera of the Council Rock.”",
        "“In whose name, Brother?” Rann had never seen Mowgli before,\nthough of course he had heard of him.",
        "“Mowgli, the Frog.  Man-cub they call me!  Mark my tra-il!”",
        "The last words were shrieked as he was being swung through the\nair, but Rann nodded and rose up till he looked no bigger than a\nspeck of dust, and there he hung, watching with his telescope eyes\nthe swaying of the treetops as Mowgli’s escort whirled along.",
        "“They never go far,” he said with a chuckle.  “They never do\nwhat they set out to do.  Always pecking at new things are the\nBandar-log.  This time, if I have any eye-sight, they have pecked\ndown trouble for themselves, for Baloo is no fledgling and\nBagheera can, as I know, kill more than goats.”",
        "So he rocked on his wings, his feet gathered up under him, and\nwaited.",
        "Meantime, Baloo and Bagheera were furious with rage and grief.\nBagheera climbed as he had never climbed before, but the thin\nbranches broke beneath his weight, and he slipped down, his claws\nfull of bark.",
        "“Why didst thou not warn the man-cub?” he roared to poor\nBaloo, who had set off at a clumsy trot in the hope of overtaking\nthe monkeys.  “What was the use of half slaying him with blows if\nthou didst not warn him?”",
        "“Haste!  O haste!  We–we may catch them yet!”  Baloo\npanted.",
        "“At that speed!  It would not tire a wounded cow.  Teacher of\nthe Law–cub-beater–a mile of that rolling to and fro would\nburst thee open.  Sit still and think!  Make a plan.  This is no\ntime for chasing.  They may drop him if we follow too close.”",
        "“Arrula!  Whoo!  They may have dropped him already, being\ntired of carrying him.  Who can trust the Bandar-log?  Put dead\nbats on my head!  Give me black bones to eat!  Roll me into the\nhives of the wild bees that I may be stung to death, and bury me\nwith the Hyaena, for I am most miserable of bears!  Arulala!\nWahooa!  O Mowgli, Mowgli!  Why did I not warn thee against the\nMonkey-Folk instead of breaking thy head?  Now perhaps I may have\nknocked the day’s lesson out of his mind, and he will be alone in\nthe jungle without the Master Words.”",
        "Baloo clasped his paws over his ears and rolled to and fro\nmoaning.",
        "“At least he gave me all the Words correctly a little time\nago,” said Bagheera impatiently.  “Baloo, thou hast neither memory\nnor respect.  What would the jungle think if I, the Black Panther,\ncurled myself up like Ikki the Porcupine, and howled?”",
        "“What do I care what the jungle thinks?  He may be dead by\nnow.”",
        "“Unless and until they drop him from the branches in sport, or\nkill him out of idleness, I have no fear for the man-cub.  He is\nwise and well taught, and above all he has the eyes that make the\nJungle-People afraid.  But (and it is a great evil) he is in the\npower of the Bandar-log, and they, because they live in trees,\nhave no fear of any of our people.”  Bagheera licked one forepaw\nthoughtfully.",
        "“Fool that I am!  Oh, fat, brown, root-digging fool that I\nam,” said Baloo, uncoiling himself with a jerk, “it is true what\nHathi the Wild Elephant says: `To each his own fear’; and they,\nthe Bandar-log, fear Kaa the Rock Snake.  He can climb as well as\nthey can.  He steals the young monkeys in the night.  The whisper\nof his name makes their wicked tails cold.  Let us go to Kaa.”",
        "“What will he do for us?  He is not of our tribe, being\nfootless–and with most evil eyes,” said Bagheera.",
        "“He is very old and very cunning.  Above all, he is always\nhungry,” said Baloo hopefully.  “Promise him many goats.”",
        "“He sleeps for a full month after he has once eaten.  He may\nbe asleep now, and even were he awake what if he would rather kill\nhis own goats?”  Bagheera, who did not know much about Kaa, was\nnaturally suspicious.",
        "“Then in that case, thou and I together, old hunter, might\nmake him see reason.”  Here Baloo rubbed his faded brown shoulder\nagainst the Panther, and they went off to look for Kaa the Rock\nPython.",
        "They found him stretched out on a warm ledge in the afternoon\nsun, admiring his beautiful new coat, for he had been in\nretirement for the last ten days changing his skin, and now he was\nvery splendid–darting his big blunt-nosed head along the\nground, and twisting the thirty feet of his body into fantastic\nknots and curves, and licking his lips as he thought of his dinner\nto come.",
        "“He has not eaten,” said Baloo, with a grunt of relief, as\nsoon as he saw the beautifully mottled brown and yellow jacket.\n“Be careful, Bagheera!  He is always a little blind after he has\nchanged his skin, and very quick to strike.”",
        "Kaa was not a poison snake–in fact he rather despised the\npoison snakes as cowards–but his strength lay in his hug, and\nwhen he had once lapped his huge coils round anybody there was no\nmore to be said.  “Good hunting!” cried Baloo, sitting up on his\nhaunches.  Like all snakes of his breed Kaa was rather deaf, and\ndid not hear the call at first.  Then he curled up ready for any\naccident, his head lowered.",
        "“Good hunting for us all,” he answered.  “Oho, Baloo, what\ndost thou do here?  Good hunting, Bagheera.  One of us at least\nneeds food.  Is there any news of game afoot?  A doe now, or even\na young buck?  I am as empty as a dried well.”",
        "“We are hunting,” said Baloo carelessly.  He knew that you\nmust not hurry Kaa.  He is too big.",
        "“Give me permission to come with you,” said Kaa.  “A blow more\nor less is nothing to thee, Bagheera or Baloo, but I–I have to\nwait and wait for days in a wood-path and climb half a night on\nthe mere chance of a young ape.  Psshaw!  The branches are not\nwhat they were when I was young.  Rotten twigs and dry boughs are\nthey all.”",
        "“Maybe thy great weight has something to do with the matter,\"\nsaid Baloo.",
        "“I am a fair length–a fair length,” said Kaa with a little\npride.  “But for all that, it is the fault of this new-grown\ntimber.  I came very near to falling on my last hunt–very near\nindeed–and the noise of my slipping, for my tail was not tight\nwrapped around the tree, waked the Bandar-log, and they called me\nmost evil names.”",
        "“Footless, yellow earth-worm,” said Bagheera under his\nwhiskers, as though he were trying to remember something.",
        "“Sssss!  Have they ever called me that?” said Kaa.",
        "“Something of that kind it was that they shouted to us last\nmoon, but we never noticed them.  They will say anything–even\nthat thou hast lost all thy teeth, and wilt not face anything\nbigger than a kid, because (they are indeed shameless, these\nBandar-log)–because thou art afraid of the he-goat’s horns,\"\nBagheera went on sweetly.",
        "Now a snake, especially a wary old python like Kaa, very\nseldom shows that he is angry, but Baloo and Bagheera could see\nthe big swallowing muscles on either side of Kaa’s throat ripple\nand bulge.",
        "“The Bandar-log have shifted their grounds,” he said quietly.\n“When I came up into the sun today I heard them whooping among the\ntree-tops.”",
        "“It–it is the Bandar-log that we follow now,” said Baloo,\nbut the words stuck in his throat, for that was the first time in\nhis memory that one of the Jungle-People had owned to being\ninterested in the doings of the monkeys.",
        "“Beyond doubt then it is no small thing that takes two such\nhunters–leaders in their own jungle I am certain–on the\ntrail of the Bandar-log,” Kaa replied courteously, as he swelled\nwith curiosity.",
        "“Indeed,” Baloo began, “I am no more than the old and\nsometimes very foolish Teacher of the Law to the Seeonee\nwolf-cubs, and Bagheera here–”",
        "“Is Bagheera,” said the Black Panther, and his jaws shut with\na snap, for he did not believe in being humble.  “The trouble is\nthis, Kaa.  Those nut-stealers and pickers of palm leaves have\nstolen away our man-cub of whom thou hast perhaps heard.”",
        "“I heard some news from Ikki (his quills make him\npresumptuous) of a man-thing that was entered into a wolf pack,\nbut I did not believe.  Ikki is full of stories half heard and\nvery badly told.”",
        "“But it is true.  He is such a man-cub as never was,” said\nBaloo.  “The best and wisest and boldest of man-cubs–my own\npupil, who shall make the name of Baloo famous through all the\njungles; and besides, I–we–love him, Kaa.”",
        "“Ts!  Ts!” said Kaa, weaving his head to and fro.  “I also\nhave known what love is.  There are tales I could tell that–”",
        "“That need a clear night when we are all well fed to praise\nproperly,” said Bagheera quickly.  “Our man-cub is in the hands of\nthe Bandar-log now, and we know that of all the Jungle-People they\nfear Kaa alone.”",
        "“They fear me alone.  They have good reason,” said Kaa.\n“Chattering, foolish, vain–vain, foolish, and chattering, are\nthe monkeys.  But a man-thing in their hands is in no good luck.\nThey grow tired of the nuts they pick, and throw them down.  They\ncarry a branch half a day, meaning to do great things with it, and\nthen they snap it in two.  That man-thing is not to be envied.\nThey called me also–`yellow fish’ was it not?”",
        "“Worm–worm–earth-worm,” said Bagheera, “as well as other\nthings which I cannot now say for shame.”",
        "“We must remind them to speak well of their master.  Aaa-ssp!\nWe must help their wandering memories.  Now, whither went they\nwith the cub?”",
        "“The jungle alone knows.  Toward the sunset, I believe,” said\nBaloo.  “We had thought that thou wouldst know, Kaa.”",
        "“I?  How?  I take them when they come in my way, but I do not\nhunt the Bandar-log, or frogs–or green scum on a water-hole,\nfor that matter.”",
        "“Up, Up!  Up, Up!  Hillo!  Illo!  Illo, look up, Baloo of the\nSeeonee Wolf Pack!”",
        "Baloo looked up to see where the voice came from, and there\nwas Rann the Kite, sweeping down with the sun shining on the\nupturned flanges of his wings.  It was near Rann’s bedtime, but he\nhad ranged all over the jungle looking for the Bear and had missed\nhim in the thick foliage.",
        "“What is it?” said Baloo.",
        "“I have seen Mowgli among the Bandar-log.  He bade me tell\nyou.  I watched.  The Bandar-log have taken him beyond the river\nto the monkey city–to the Cold Lairs.  They may stay there for\na night, or ten nights, or an hour.  I have told the bats to watch\nthrough the dark time.  That is my message.  Good hunting, all you\nbelow!”",
        "“Full gorge and a deep sleep to you, Rann,” cried Bagheera.\n“I will remember thee in my next kill, and put aside the head for\nthee alone, O best of kites!”",
        "“It is nothing.  It is nothing.  The boy held the Master Word.\nI could have done no less,” and Rann circled up again to his\nroost.",
        "“He has not forgotten to use his tongue,” said Baloo with a\nchuckle of pride.  “To think of one so young remembering the\nMaster Word for the birds too while he was being pulled across\ntrees!”",
        "“It was most firmly driven into him,” said Bagheera.  “But I\nam proud of him, and now we must go to the Cold Lairs.”",
        "They all knew where that place was, but few of the Jungle\nPeople ever went there, because what they called the Cold Lairs\nwas an old deserted city, lost and buried in the jungle, and\nbeasts seldom use a place that men have once used.  The wild boar\nwill, but the hunting tribes do not.  Besides, the monkeys lived\nthere as much as they could be said to live anywhere, and no\nself-respecting animal would come within eyeshot of it except in\ntimes of drought, when the half-ruined tanks and reservoirs held a\nlittle water.",
        "“It is half a night’s journey–at full speed,” said\nBagheera, and Baloo looked very serious.  “I will go as fast as I\ncan,” he said anxiously.",
        "“We dare not wait for thee.  Follow, Baloo.  We must go on the\nquick-foot–Kaa and I.”",
        "“Feet or no feet, I can keep abreast of all thy four,” said\nKaa shortly.  Baloo made one effort to hurry, but had to sit down\npanting, and so they left him to come on later, while Bagheera\nhurried forward, at the quick panther-canter.  Kaa said nothing,\nbut, strive as Bagheera might, the huge Rock-python held level\nwith him.  When they came to a hill stream, Bagheera gained,\nbecause he bounded across while Kaa swam, his head and two feet of\nhis neck clearing the water, but on level ground Kaa made up the\ndistance.",
        "“By the Broken Lock that freed me,” said Bagheera, when\ntwilight had fallen, “thou art no slow goer!”",
        "“I am hungry,” said Kaa.  “Besides, they called me speckled\nfrog.”",
        "“Worm–earth-worm, and yellow to boot.”",
        "“All one.  Let us go on,” and Kaa seemed to pour himself along\nthe ground, finding the shortest road with his steady eyes, and\nkeeping to it.",
        "In the Cold Lairs the Monkey-People were not thinking of\nMowgli’s friends at all.  They had brought the boy to the Lost\nCity, and were very much pleased with themselves for the time.\nMowgli had never seen an Indian city before, and though this was\nalmost a heap of ruins it seemed very wonderful and splendid.\nSome king had built it long ago on a little hill.  You could still\ntrace the stone causeways that led up to the ruined gates where\nthe last splinters of wood hung to the worn, rusted hinges.  Trees\nhad grown into and out of the walls; the battlements were tumbled\ndown and decayed, and wild creepers hung out of the windows of the\ntowers on the walls in bushy hanging clumps.",
        "A great roofless palace crowned the hill, and the marble of\nthe courtyards and the fountains was split, and stained with red\nand green, and the very cobblestones in the courtyard where the\nking’s elephants used to live had been thrust up and apart by\ngrasses and young trees.  From the palace you could see the rows\nand rows of roofless houses that made up the city looking like\nempty honeycombs filled with blackness; the shapeless block of\nstone that had been an idol in the square where four roads met;\nthe pits and dimples at street corners where the public wells once\nstood, and the shattered domes of temples with wild figs sprouting\non their sides.  The monkeys called the place their city, and\npretended to despise the Jungle-People because they lived in the\nforest.  And yet they never knew what the buildings were made for\nnor how to use them.  They would sit in circles on the hall of the\nking’s council chamber, and scratch for fleas and pretend to be\nmen; or they would run in and out of the roofless houses and\ncollect pieces of plaster and old bricks in a corner, and forget\nwhere they had hidden them, and fight and cry in scuffling crowds,\nand then break off to play up and down the terraces of the king’s\ngarden, where they would shake the rose trees and the oranges in\nsport to see the fruit and flowers fall.  They explored all the\npassages and dark tunnels in the palace and the hundreds of little\ndark rooms, but they never remembered what they had seen and what\nthey had not; and so drifted about in ones and twos or crowds\ntelling each other that they were doing as men did.  They drank at\nthe tanks and made the water all muddy, and then they fought over\nit, and then they would all rush together in mobs and shout:\n“There is no one in the jungle so wise and good and clever and\nstrong and gentle as the Bandar-log.”  Then all would begin again\ntill they grew tired of the city and went back to the tree-tops,\nhoping the Jungle-People would notice them.",
        "Mowgli, who had been trained under the Law of the Jungle, did\nnot like or understand this kind of life.  The monkeys dragged him\ninto the Cold Lairs late in the afternoon, and instead of going to\nsleep, as Mowgli would have done after a long journey, they joined\nhands and danced about and sang their foolish songs.  One of the\nmonkeys made a speech and told his companions that Mowgli’s\ncapture marked a new thing in the history of the Bandar-log, for\nMowgli was going to show them how to weave sticks and canes\ntogether as a protection against rain and cold.  Mowgli picked up\nsome creepers and began to work them in and out, and the monkeys\ntried to imitate; but in a very few minutes they lost interest and\nbegan to pull their friends’ tails or jump up and down on all\nfours, coughing.",
        "“I wish to eat,” said Mowgli.  “I am a stranger in this part\nof the jungle.  Bring me food, or give me leave to hunt here.”",
        "Twenty or thirty monkeys bounded away to bring him nuts and\nwild pawpaws.  But they fell to fighting on the road, and it was\ntoo much trouble to go back with what was left of the fruit.\nMowgli was sore and angry as well as hungry, and he roamed through\nthe empty city giving the Strangers’ Hunting Call from time to\ntime, but no one answered him, and Mowgli felt that he had reached\na very bad place indeed.  “All that Baloo has said about the\nBandar-log is true,” he thought to himself.  “They have no Law, no\nHunting Call, and no leaders–nothing but foolish words and\nlittle picking thievish hands.  So if I am starved or killed here,\nit will be all my own fault.  But I must try to return to my own\njungle.  Baloo will surely beat me, but that is better than\nchasing silly rose leaves with the Bandar-log.”",
        "No sooner had he walked to the city wall than the monkeys\npulled him back, telling him that he did not know how happy he\nwas, and pinching him to make him grateful.  He set his teeth and\nsaid nothing, but went with the shouting monkeys to a terrace\nabove the red sandstone reservoirs that were half-full of rain\nwater.  There was a ruined summer-house of white marble in the\ncenter of the terrace, built for queens dead a hundred years ago.\nThe domed roof had half fallen in and blocked up the underground\npassage from the palace by which the queens used to enter.  But\nthe walls were made of screens of marble tracery–beautiful\nmilk-white fretwork, set with agates and cornelians and jasper and\nlapis lazuli, and as the moon came up behind the hill it shone\nthrough the open work, casting shadows on the ground like black\nvelvet embroidery.  Sore, sleepy, and hungry as he was, Mowgli\ncould not help laughing when the Bandar-log began, twenty at a\ntime, to tell him how great and wise and strong and gentle they\nwere, and how foolish he was to wish to leave them.  “We are\ngreat.  We are free.  We are wonderful.  We are the most wonderful\npeople in all the jungle!  We all say so, and so it must be true,\"\nthey shouted.  “Now as you are a new listener and can carry our\nwords back to the Jungle-People so that they may notice us in\nfuture, we will tell you all about our most excellent selves.\"\nMowgli made no objection, and the monkeys gathered by hundreds and\nhundreds on the terrace to listen to their own speakers singing\nthe praises of the Bandar-log, and whenever a speaker stopped for\nwant of breath they would all shout together: “This is true; we\nall say so.”  Mowgli nodded and blinked, and said “Yes” when they\nasked him a question, and his head spun with the noise.  “Tabaqui\nthe Jackal must have bitten all these people,” he said to himself,\n“and now they have madness.  Certainly this is dewanee, the\nmadness.  Do they never go to sleep?  Now there is a cloud coming\nto cover that moon.  If it were only a big enough cloud I might\ntry to run away in the darkness.  But I am tired.”",
        "That same cloud was being watched by two good friends in the\nruined ditch below the city wall, for Bagheera and Kaa, knowing\nwell how dangerous the Monkey-People were in large numbers, did\nnot wish to run any risks.  The monkeys never fight unless they\nare a hundred to one, and few in the jungle care for those odds.",
        "“I will go to the west wall,” Kaa whispered, “and come down\nswiftly with the slope of the ground in my favor.  They will not\nthrow themselves upon my back in their hundreds, but–”",
        "“I know it,” said Bagheera.  “Would that Baloo were here, but\nwe must do what we can.  When that cloud covers the moon I shall\ngo to the terrace.  They hold some sort of council there over the\nboy.”",
        "“Good hunting,” said Kaa grimly, and glided away to the west\nwall.  That happened to be the least ruined of any, and the big\nsnake was delayed awhile before he could find a way up the stones.\nThe cloud hid the moon, and as Mowgli wondered what would come\nnext he heard Bagheera’s light feet on the terrace.  The Black\nPanther had raced up the slope almost without a sound and was\nstriking–he knew better than to waste time in biting–right\nand left among the monkeys, who were seated round Mowgli in\ncircles fifty and sixty deep.  There was a howl of fright and\nrage, and then as Bagheera tripped on the rolling kicking bodies\nbeneath him, a monkey shouted: “There is only one here!  Kill him!\nKill.”  A scuffling mass of monkeys, biting, scratching, tearing,\nand pulling, closed over Bagheera, while five or six laid hold of\nMowgli, dragged him up the wall of the summerhouse and pushed him\nthrough the hole of the broken dome.  A man-trained boy would have\nbeen badly bruised, for the fall was a good fifteen feet, but\nMowgli fell as Baloo had taught him to fall, and landed on his\nfeet.",
        "“Stay there,” shouted the monkeys, “till we have killed thy\nfriends, and later we will play with thee–if the Poison-People\nleave thee alive.”",
        "“We be of one blood, ye and I,” said Mowgli, quickly giving\nthe Snake’s Call.  He could hear rustling and hissing in the\nrubbish all round him and gave the Call a second time, to make\nsure.",
        "“Even ssso!  Down hoods all!” said half a dozen low voices\n(every ruin in India becomes sooner or later a dwelling place of\nsnakes, and the old summerhouse was alive with cobras).  “Stand\nstill, Little Brother, for thy feet may do us harm.”",
        "Mowgli stood as quietly as he could, peering through the open\nwork and listening to the furious din of the fight round the Black\nPanther–the yells and chatterings and scufflings, and\nBagheera’s deep, hoarse cough as he backed and bucked and twisted\nand plunged under the heaps of his enemies.  For the first time\nsince he was born, Bagheera was fighting for his life.",
        "“Baloo must be at hand; Bagheera would not have come alone,\"\nMowgli thought.  And then he called aloud: “To the tank, Bagheera.\nRoll to the water tanks.  Roll and plunge!  Get to the water!”",
        "Bagheera heard, and the cry that told him Mowgli was safe gave\nhim new courage.  He worked his way desperately, inch by inch,\nstraight for the reservoirs, halting in silence.  Then from the\nruined wall nearest the jungle rose up the rumbling war-shout of\nBaloo.  The old Bear had done his best, but he could not come\nbefore.  “Bagheera,” he shouted, “I am here.  I climb!  I haste!\nAhuwora!  The stones slip under my feet!  Wait my coming, O most\ninfamous Bandar-log!”  He panted up the terrace only to disappear\nto the head in a wave of monkeys, but he threw himself squarely on\nhis haunches, and, spreading out his forepaws, hugged as many as\nhe could hold, and then began to hit with a regular bat-bat-bat,\nlike the flipping strokes of a paddle wheel.  A crash and a splash\ntold Mowgli that Bagheera had fought his way to the tank where the\nmonkeys could not follow.  The Panther lay gasping for breath, his\nhead just out of the water, while the monkeys stood three deep on\nthe red steps, dancing up and down with rage, ready to spring upon\nhim from all sides if he came out to help Baloo.  It was then that\nBagheera lifted up his dripping chin, and in despair gave the\nSnake’s Call for protection–\"We be of one blood, ye and I\"–\nfor he believed that Kaa had turned tail at the last minute.  Even\nBaloo, half smothered under the monkeys on the edge of the\nterrace, could not help chuckling as he heard the Black Panther\nasking for help.",
        "Kaa had only just worked his way over the west wall, landing\nwith a wrench that dislodged a coping stone into the ditch.  He\nhad no intention of losing any advantage of the ground, and coiled\nand uncoiled himself once or twice, to be sure that every foot of\nhis long body was in working order.  All that while the fight with\nBaloo went on, and the monkeys yelled in the tank round Bagheera,\nand Mang the Bat, flying to and fro, carried the news of the great\nbattle over the jungle, till even Hathi the Wild Elephant\ntrumpeted, and, far away, scattered bands of the Monkey-Folk woke\nand came leaping along the tree-roads to help their comrades in\nthe Cold Lairs, and the noise of the fight roused all the day\nbirds for miles round.  Then Kaa came straight, quickly, and\nanxious to kill.  The fighting strength of a python is in the\ndriving blow of his head backed by all the strength and weight of\nhis body.  If you can imagine a lance, or a battering ram, or a\nhammer weighing nearly half a ton driven by a cool, quiet mind\nliving in the handle of it, you can roughly imagine what Kaa was\nlike when he fought.  A python four or five feet long can knock a\nman down if he hits him fairly in the chest, and Kaa was thirty\nfeet long, as you know.  His first stroke was delivered into the\nheart of the crowd round Baloo.  It was sent home with shut mouth\nin silence, and there was no need of a second.  The monkeys\nscattered with cries of–\"Kaa!  It is Kaa!  Run!  Run!”",
        "Generations of monkeys had been scared into good behavior by\nthe stories their elders told them of Kaa, the night thief, who\ncould slip along the branches as quietly as moss grows, and steal\naway the strongest monkey that ever lived; of old Kaa, who could\nmake himself look so like a dead branch or a rotten stump that the\nwisest were deceived, till the branch caught them.  Kaa was\neverything that the monkeys feared in the jungle, for none of them\nknew the limits of his power, none of them could look him in the\nface, and none had ever come alive out of his hug.  And so they\nran, stammering with terror, to the walls and the roofs of the\nhouses, and Baloo drew a deep breath of relief.  His fur was much\nthicker than Bagheera’s, but he had suffered sorely in the fight.\nThen Kaa opened his mouth for the first time and spoke one long\nhissing word, and the far-away monkeys, hurrying to the defense of\nthe Cold Lairs, stayed where they were, cowering, till the loaded\nbranches bent and crackled under them.  The monkeys on the walls\nand the empty houses stopped their cries, and in the stillness\nthat fell upon the city Mowgli heard Bagheera shaking his wet\nsides as he came up from the tank.  Then the clamor broke out\nagain.  The monkeys leaped higher up the walls.  They clung around\nthe necks of the big stone idols and shrieked as they skipped\nalong the battlements, while Mowgli, dancing in the summerhouse,\nput his eye to the screenwork and hooted owl-fashion between his\nfront teeth, to show his derision and contempt.",
        "“Get the man-cub out of that trap; I can do no more,” Bagheera\ngasped.  “Let us take the man-cub and go.  They may attack again.”",
        "“They will not move till I order them.  Stay you sssso!”  Kaa\nhissed, and the city was silent once more.  “I could not come\nbefore, Brother, but I think I heard thee call\"–this was to\nBagheera.",
        "“I–I may have cried out in the battle,” Bagheera answered.\n“Baloo, art thou hurt?",
        "“I am not sure that they did not pull me into a hundred little\nbearlings,” said Baloo, gravely shaking one leg after the other.\n“Wow! I am sore.  Kaa, we owe thee, I think, our lives–Bagheera\nand I.”",
        "“No matter.  Where is the manling?”",
        "“Here, in a trap.  I cannot climb out,” cried Mowgli.  The\ncurve of the broken dome was above his head.",
        "“Take him away.  He dances like Mao the Peacock.  He will\ncrush our young,” said the cobras inside.",
        "“Hah!” said Kaa with a chuckle, “he has friends everywhere,\nthis manling.  Stand back, manling.  And hide you, O Poison\nPeople.  I break down the wall.”",
        "Kaa looked carefully till he found a discolored crack in the\nmarble tracery showing a weak spot, made two or three light taps\nwith his head to get the distance, and then lifting up six feet of\nhis body clear of the ground, sent home half a dozen full-power\nsmashing blows, nose-first.  The screen-work broke and fell away\nin a cloud of dust and rubbish, and Mowgli leaped through the\nopening and flung himself between Baloo and Bagheera–an arm\naround each big neck.",
        "“Art thou hurt?” said Baloo, hugging him softly.",
        "“I am sore, hungry, and not a little bruised.  But, oh, they\nhave handled ye grievously, my Brothers!  Ye bleed.”",
        "“Others also,” said Bagheera, licking his lips and looking at\nthe monkey-dead on the terrace and round the tank.",
        "“It is nothing, it is nothing, if thou art safe, oh, my pride\nof all little frogs!” whimpered Baloo.",
        "“Of that we shall judge later,” said Bagheera, in a dry voice\nthat Mowgli did not at all like.  “But here is Kaa to whom we owe\nthe battle and thou owest thy life.  Thank him according to our\ncustoms, Mowgli.”",
        "Mowgli turned and saw the great Python’s head swaying a foot\nabove his own.",
        "“So this is the manling,” said Kaa.  “Very soft is his skin,\nand he is not unlike the Bandar-log.  Have a care, manling, that I\ndo not mistake thee for a monkey some twilight when I have newly\nchanged my coat.”",
        "“We be one blood, thou and I,” Mowgli answered.  “I take my\nlife from thee tonight.  My kill shall be thy kill if ever thou\nart hungry, O Kaa.”",
        "“All thanks, Little Brother,” said Kaa, though his eyes\ntwinkled.  “And what may so bold a hunter kill?  I ask that I may\nfollow when next he goes abroad.”",
        "“I kill nothing,–I am too little,–but I drive goats\ntoward such as can use them.  When thou art empty come to me and\nsee if I speak the truth.  I have some skill in these [he held out\nhis hands], and if ever thou art in a trap, I may pay the debt\nwhich I owe to thee, to Bagheera, and to Baloo, here.  Good\nhunting to ye all, my masters.”",
        "“Well said,” growled Baloo, for Mowgli had returned thanks\nvery prettily.  The Python dropped his head lightly for a minute\non Mowgli’s shoulder.  “A brave heart and a courteous tongue,\"\nsaid he.  “They shall carry thee far through the jungle, manling.\nBut now go hence quickly with thy friends.  Go and sleep, for the\nmoon sets, and what follows it is not well that thou shouldst\nsee.”",
        "The moon was sinking behind the hills and the lines of\ntrembling monkeys huddled together on the walls and battlements\nlooked like ragged shaky fringes of things.  Baloo went down to\nthe tank for a drink and Bagheera began to put his fur in order,\nas Kaa glided out into the center of the terrace and brought his\njaws together with a ringing snap that drew all the monkeys’ eyes\nupon him.",
        "“The moon sets,” he said.  “Is there yet light enough to see?”",
        "From the walls came a moan like the wind in the tree-tops–\n“We see, O Kaa.”",
        "“Good.  Begins now the dance–the Dance of the Hunger of\nKaa.  Sit still and watch.”",
        "He turned twice or thrice in a big circle, weaving his head\nfrom right to left.  Then he began making loops and figures of\neight with his body, and soft, oozy triangles that melted into\nsquares and five-sided figures, and coiled mounds, never resting,\nnever hurrying, and never stopping his low humming song.  It grew\ndarker and darker, till at last the dragging, shifting coils\ndisappeared, but they could hear the rustle of the scales.",
        "Baloo and Bagheera stood still as stone, growling in their\nthroats, their neck hair bristling, and Mowgli watched and\nwondered.",
        "“Bandar-log,” said the voice of Kaa at last, “can ye stir foot\nor hand without my order?  Speak!”",
        "“Without thy order we cannot stir foot or hand, O Kaa!”",
        "“Good!  Come all one pace nearer to me.”",
        "The lines of the monkeys swayed forward helplessly, and Baloo\nand Bagheera took one stiff step forward with them.",
        "“Nearer!” hissed Kaa, and they all moved again.",
        "Mowgli laid his hands on Baloo and Bagheera to get them away,\nand the two great beasts started as though they had been waked\nfrom a dream.",
        "“Keep thy hand on my shoulder,” Bagheera whispered.  “Keep it\nthere, or I must go back–must go back to Kaa.  Aah!”",
        "“It is only old Kaa making circles on the dust,” said Mowgli.\n“Let us go.”  And the three slipped off through a gap in the walls\nto the jungle.",
        "“Whoof!” said Baloo, when he stood under the still trees\nagain.  “Never more will I make an ally of Kaa,” and he shook\nhimself all over.",
        "“He knows more than we,” said Bagheera, trembling.  “In a\nlittle time, had I stayed, I should have walked down his throat.”",
        "“Many will walk by that road before the moon rises again,\"\nsaid Baloo.  “He will have good hunting–after his own fashion.”",
        "“But what was the meaning of it all?” said Mowgli, who did not\nknow anything of a python’s powers of fascination.  “I saw no more\nthan a big snake making foolish circles till the dark came.  And\nhis nose was all sore.  Ho!  Ho!”",
        "“Mowgli,” said Bagheera angrily, “his nose was sore on thy\naccount, as my ears and sides and paws, and Baloo’s neck and\nshoulders are bitten on thy account.  Neither Baloo nor Bagheera\nwill be able to hunt with pleasure for many days.”",
        "“It is nothing,” said Baloo; “we have the man-cub again.”",
        "“True, but he has cost us heavily in time which might have\nbeen spent in good hunting, in wounds, in hair–I am half\nplucked along my back–and last of all, in honor.  For,\nremember, Mowgli, I, who am the Black Panther, was forced to call\nupon Kaa for protection, and Baloo and I were both made stupid as\nlittle birds by the Hunger Dance.  All this, man-cub, came of thy\nplaying with the Bandar-log.”",
        "“True, it is true,” said Mowgli sorrowfully.  “I am an evil\nman-cub, and my stomach is sad in me.”",
        "“Mf!  What says the Law of the Jungle, Baloo?”",
        "Baloo did not wish to bring Mowgli into any more trouble, but\nhe could not tamper with the Law, so he mumbled: “Sorrow never\nstays punishment.  But remember, Bagheera, he is very little.”",
        "“I will remember.  But he has done mischief, and blows must be\ndealt now.  Mowgli, hast thou anything to say?”",
        "“Nothing.  I did wrong.  Baloo and thou are wounded.  It is\njust.”",
        "Bagheera gave him half a dozen love-taps from a panther’s\npoint of view (they would hardly have waked one of his own cubs),\nbut for a seven-year-old boy they amounted to as severe a beating\nas you could wish to avoid.  When it was all over Mowgli sneezed,\nand picked himself up without a word.",
        "“Now,” said Bagheera, “jump on my back, Little Brother, and we\nwill go home.”",
        "One of the beauties of Jungle Law is that punishment settles\nall scores.  There is no nagging afterward.",
        "Mowgli laid his head down on Bagheera’s back and slept so\ndeeply that he never waked when he was put down in the home-cave.",
