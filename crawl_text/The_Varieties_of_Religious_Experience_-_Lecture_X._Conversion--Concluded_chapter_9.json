        "In this lecture we have to finish the subject of Conversion,\nconsidering at first those striking instantaneous instances of\nwhich Saint Paul’s is the most eminent, and in which, often amid\ntremendous emotional excitement or perturbation of the senses, a\ncomplete division is established in the twinkling of an eye\nbetween the old life and the new.  Conversion of this type is an\nimportant phase of religious experience, owing to the part which\nit has played in Protestant theology, and it behooves us to study\nit conscientiously on that account.",
        "I think I had better cite two or three of these cases before\nproceeding to a more generalized account.  One must know concrete\ninstances first; for, as Professor Agassiz used to say, one can\nsee no farther into a generalization than just so far as one’s\nprevious acquaintance with particulars enables one to take it in.",
        "I will go back, then, to the case of our friend Henry Alline, and\nquote his report of the 26th of March, 1775, on which his poor\ndivided mind became unified for good.",
        "“As I was about sunset wandering in the fields lamenting my\nmiserable lost and undone condition, and almost ready to sink\nunder my burden, I thought I was in such a miserable case as\nnever any man was before.  I returned to the house, and when I\ngot to the door, just as I was stepping off the threshold, the\nfollowing impressions came into my mind like a powerful but small\nstill voice.  You have been seeking, praying, reforming,\nlaboring, reading, hearing, and meditating, and what have you\ndone by it towards your salvation?  Are you any nearer to\nconversion now than when you first began?  Are you any more\nprepared for heaven, or fitter to appear before the impartial bar\nof God, than when you first began to seek?",
        "“It brought such conviction on me that I was obliged to say that\nI did not think I was one step nearer than at first, but as much\ncondemned, as much exposed, and as miserable as before. I cried\nout within myself, O Lord God, I am lost, and if thou, O Lord,\ndost not find out some new way, I know nothing of, I shall never\nbe saved, for the ways and methods I have prescribed to myself\nhave all failed me, and I am willing they should fail. O Lord,\nhave mercy! O Lord, have mercy!",
        "“These discoveries continued until I went into the house and sat\ndown.  After I sat down, being all in confusion, like a drowning\nman that was just giving up to sink, and almost in an agony, I\nturned very suddenly round in my chair, and seeing part of an old\nBible lying in one of the chairs, I caught hold of it in great\nhaste; and opening it without any premeditation, cast my eyes on\nthe 38th Psalm, which was the first time I ever saw the word of\nGod:  it took hold of me with such power that it seemed to go\nthrough my whole soul, so that it seemed as if God was praying\nin, with, and for me.  About this time my father called the\nfamily to attend prayers; I attended, but paid no regard to what\nhe said in his prayer, but continued praying in those words of\nthe Psalm.  Oh, help me, help me! cried I, thou Redeemer of\nsouls, and save me, or I am gone forever; thou canst this night,\nif thou pleasest, with one drop of thy blood atone for my sins,\nand appease the wrath of an angry God.  At that instant of time\nwhen I gave all up to him to do with me as he pleased, and was\nwilling that God should rule over me at his pleasure, redeeming\nlove broke into my soul with repeated scriptures, with such power\nthat my whole soul seemed to be melted down with love, the burden\nof guilt and condemnation was gone, darkness was expelled, my\nheart humbled and filled with gratitude, and my whole soul, that\nwas a few minutes ago groaning under mountains of death, and\ncrying to an unknown God for help, was now filled with immortal\nlove, soaring on the wings of faith,<215> freed from the chains\nof death and darkness, and crying out, My Lord and my God; thou\nart my rock and my fortress, my shield and my high tower, my\nlife, my joy, my present and my everlasting portion.  Looking up,\nI thought I saw that same light [he had on more than one previous\noccasion seen subjectively a bright blaze of light], though it\nappeared different; and as soon as I saw it, the design was\nopened to me, according to his promise, and I was obliged to cry\nout:  Enough, enough, O blessed God! The work of conversion, the\nchange, and the manifestations of it are no more disputable than\nthat light which I see, or anything that ever I saw.",
        "“In the midst of all my joys, in less than half an hour after my\nsoul was set at liberty, the Lord discovered to me my labor in\nthe ministry and call to preach the gospel.  I cried out, Amen,\nLord, I’ll go; send me, send me.  I spent the greatest part of\nthe night in ecstasies of joy, praising and adoring the Ancient\nof Days for his free and unbounded grace.  After I had been so\nlong in this transport and heavenly frame that my nature seemed\nto require sleep, I thought to close my eyes for a few moments;\nthen the devil stepped in, and told me that if I went to sleep, I\nshould lose it all, and when I should awake in the morning I\nwould find it to be nothing but a fancy and delusion. I\nimmediately cried out, O Lord God, if I am deceived, undeceive\nme.",
        "“I then closed my eyes for a few minutes, and seemed to be\nrefreshed with sleep; and when I awoke, the first inquiry was,\nWhere is my God?  And in an instant of time, my soul seemed awake\nin and with God, and surrounded by the arms of everlasting love. \nAbout sunrise I arose with joy to relate to my parents what God\nhad done for my soul, and declared to them the miracle of God’s\nunbounded grace.  I took a Bible to show them the words that were\nimpressed by God on my soul the evening before; but when I came\nto open the Bible, it appeared all new to me.",
        "“I so longed to be useful in the cause of Christ, in preaching\nthe gospel, that it seemed as if I could not rest any longer, but\ngo I must and tell the wonders of redeeming love.  I lost all \ntaste for carnal pleasures, and carnal company, and was enabled\nto forsake them.\"[120]",
        "[120] Life and Journals, Boston, 1806, pp. 31-40, abridged.",
        "Young Mr. Alline, after the briefest of delays, and with no\nbook-learning but his Bible, and no teaching save that of his own\nexperience, became a Christian minister, and thenceforward his\nlife was fit to rank, for its austerity and single-mindedness,\nwith that of the most devoted saints.  But happy as he became in\nhis strenuous way, he never got his taste for even the most\ninnocent carnal pleasures back.  We must class him, like Bunyan\nand Tolstoy, amongst those upon whose soul the iron of melancholy\nleft a permanent imprint.  His redemption was into another\nuniverse than this mere natural world, and life remained for him\na sad and patient trial.  Years later we can find him making such\nan entry as this in his diary:  “On Wednesday the 12th I preached\nat a wedding, and had the happiness thereby to be the means of\nexcluding carnal mirth.”",
        "The next case I will give is that of a correspondent of Professor\nLeuba, printed in the latter’s article, already cited, in vol. \nvi.  of the American Journal of Psychology.  This subject was an\nOxford graduate, the son of a clergyman, and the story resembles\nin many points the classic case of Colonel Gardiner, which\neverybody may be supposed to know. Here it is, somewhat\nabridged:–",
        "“Between the period of leaving Oxford and my conversion I never\ndarkened the door of my father’s church, although I lived with\nhim for eight years, making what money I wanted by journalism,\nand spending it in high carousal with any one who would sit with\nme and drink it away.  So I lived, sometimes drunk for a week\ntogether, and then a terrible repentance, and would not touch a\ndrop for a whole month.",
        "“In all this period, that is, up to thirty-three years of age, I\nnever had a desire to reform on religious grounds.  But all my \npangs were due to some terrible remorse I used to feel after a\nheavy carousal, the remorse taking the shape of regret after my\nfolly in wasting my life in such a way–a man of superior talents\nand education.  This terrible remorse turned me gray in one\nnight, and whenever it came upon me I was perceptibly grayer the\nnext morning.  What I suffered in this way is beyond the\nexpression of words.  It was hell-fire in all its most dreadful\ntortures.  Often did I vow that if I got over ’this time’ I would\nreform.  Alas, in about three days I fully recovered, and was as\nhappy as ever.  So it went on for years, but, with a physique\nlike a rhinoceros, I always recovered, and as long as I let drink\nalone, no man was as capable of enjoying life as I was.",
        "“I was converted in my own bedroom in my father’s rectory house\nat precisely three o’clock in the afternoon of a hot July day\n(July 13, 1886).  I was in perfect health, having been off from\nthe drink for nearly a month.  I was in no way troubled about my\nsoul.  In fact, God was not in my thoughts that day.  A young\nlady friend sent me a copy of Professor Drummond’s Natural Law in\nthe Spiritual World, asking me my opinion of it as a literary\nwork only.  Being proud of my critical talents and wishing to\nenhance myself in my new friend’s esteem, I took the book to my\nbedroom for quiet, intending to give it a thorough study, and\nthen write her what I thought of it.  It was here that God met me\nface to face, and I shall never forget the meeting.  ’He that\nhath the Son hath life eternal, he that hath not the Son hath not\nlife.’  I had read this scores of times before, but this made all\nthe difference.  I was now in God’s presence and my attention was\nabsolutely ’soldered’ on to this verse, and I was not allowed to\nproceed with the book till I had fairly considered what these\nwords really involved.  Only then was I allowed to proceed,\nfeeling all the while that there was another being in my bedroom,\nthough not seen by me.  The stillness was very marvelous, and I\nfelt supremely happy.  It was most unquestionably shown me, in\none second of time, that I had never touched the Eternal:  and\nthat if I died then, I must inevitably be lost. I was undone.  I\nknew it as well as I now know I am saved.  The Spirit of God\nshowed it me in ineffable love; there was no terror in it; I felt\nGod’s love so powerfully upon me that only a mighty sorrow crept\nover me that I had lost all through my own folly; and what was I\nto do?  What could I do?  I did not repent even; God never asked\nme to repent.  All I felt was ’I am undone,’ and God cannot help\nit, although he loves me.  No fault on the part of the Almighty. \nAll the time I was supremely happy:  I felt like a little child\nbefore his father.  I had done wrong, but my Father did not scold\nme, but loved me most wondrously.  Still my doom was sealed.  I\nwas lost to a certainty, and being naturally of a brave\ndisposition I did not quail under it, but deep sorrow\nfor the past, mixed with regret for what I had lost, took hold\nupon me, and my soul thrilled within me to think it was all over.\nThen there crept in upon me so gently, so lovingly, so\nunmistakably, a way of escape, and what was it after all?  The\nold, old story over again, told in the simplest way:  ’There is\nno name under heaven whereby ye can be saved except that of the\nLord Jesus Christ.’ No words were spoken to me; my soul seemed to\nsee my Saviour in the spirit, and from that hour to this, nearly\nnine years now, there has never been in my life one doubt that\nthe Lord Jesus Christ and God the Father both worked upon me that\nafternoon in July, both differently, and both in the most perfect\nlove conceivable, and I rejoiced there and then in a conversion\nso astounding that the whole village heard of it in less than\ntwenty-four hours.",
        "“But a time of trouble was yet to come.  The day after my\nconversion I went into the hay-field to lend a hand with the\nharvest, and not having made any promise to God to abstain or\ndrink in moderation only, I took too much and came home drunk. \nMy poor sister was heart-broken; and I felt ashamed of myself and\ngot to my bedroom at once, where she followed me weeping\ncopiously.  She said I had been converted and fallen away\ninstantly.  But although I was quite full of drink (not muddled,\nhowever), I knew that God’s work begun in me was not going to be\nwasted.  About midday I made on my knees the first prayer before\nGod for twenty years.  I did not ask to be forgiven; I felt that\nwas no good, for I would be sure to fall again.  Well, what did I\ndo?  I committed myself to him in the profoundest belief that my\nindividuality was going to be destroyed, that he would take all\nfrom me, and I was willing.  In such a <219> surrender lies the\nsecret of a holy life.  From that hour drink has had no terrors\nfor me:  I never touch it, never want it.  The same thing\noccurred with my pipe:  after being a regular smoker from my\ntwelfth year the desire for it went at once, and has never\nreturned.  So with every known sin, the deliverance in each case\nbeing permanent and complete.  I have had no temptation since\nconversion, God seemingly having shut out Satan from that course\nwith me.  He gets a free hand in other ways, but never on sins of\nthe flesh.  Since I gave up to God all ownership in my own life,\nhe has guided me in a thousand ways, and has opened my path in a\nway almost incredible to those who do not enjoy the blessing of a\ntruly surrendered life.”",
        "So much for our graduate of Oxford, in whom you notice the\ncomplete abolition of an ancient appetite as one of the\nconversion’s fruits.",
        "The most curious record of sudden conversion with which I am\nacquainted is that of M. Alphonse Ratisbonne, a free-thinking\nFrench Jew, to Catholicism, at Rome in 1842.  In a letter to a\nclerical friend, written a few months later, the convert gives a\npalpitating account of the circumstances.[121] The predisposing\nconditions appear to have been slight.  He had an elder brother\nwho had been converted and was a Catholic priest.  He was himself\nirreligious, and nourished an antipathy to the apostate brother\nand generally to his “cloth.”  Finding himself at Rome in his\ntwenty-ninth year, he fell in with a French gentleman who tried\nto make a proselyte of him, but who succeeded no farther after\ntwo or three conversations than to get him to hang (half\njocosely) a religious medal round his neck, and to accept and\nread a copy of a short prayer to the Virgin.  M. Ratisbonne\nrepresents his own part in the conversations as having been of a\nlight and chaffing order; but he notes the fact that for some\ndays he was unable to banish the words of the prayer from his\nmind, and that the night before the crisis he had a sort of\nnightmare, in the imagery of which a black cross with no Christ\nupon it figured.  Nevertheless, until noon of the next day he was\nfree in mind and spent the time in trivial conversations.  I now\ngive his own words.",
        "[121] My quotations are made from an Italian translation of this\nletter in the Biografia del sig. M. A. Ratisbonne, Ferrara, 1843,\nwhich I have to thank Monsignore D. O’Connell of Rome for\nbringing to my notice.  I abridge the original.",
        "“If at this time any one had accosted me, saying:  ’Alphonse, in\na quarter of an hour you shall be adoring Jesus Christ as your\nGod and Saviour; you shall lie prostrate with your face upon the\nground in a humble church; you shall be smiting your breast at\nthe foot of a priest; you shall pass the carnival in a college of\nJesuits to prepare yourself to receive baptism, ready to give\nyour life for the Catholic faith; you shall renounce the world\nand its pomps and pleasures; renounce your fortune, your hopes,\nand if need be, your betrothed; the affections of your family,\nthe esteem of your friends, and your attachment to the Jewish\npeople; you shall have no other aspiration than to follow Christ\nand bear his cross till death;’–if, I say, a prophet had come to\nme with such a prediction, I should have judged that only one\nperson could be more mad than he–whosoever, namely, might\nbelieve in the possibility of such senseless folly becoming true.",
        "And yet that folly is at present my only wisdom, my sole\nhappiness.",
        "“Coming out of the cafe I met the carriage of Monsieur B. [the\nproselyting friend].  He stopped and invited me in for a drive,\nbut first asked me to wait for a few minutes whilst he attended\nto some duty at the church of San Andrea delle Fratte.  Instead\nof waiting in the carriage, I entered the church myself to look\nat it.  The church of San Andrea was poor, small, and empty; I\nbelieve that I found myself there almost alone.  No work of art\nattracted my attention; and I passed my eyes mechanically over\nits interior without being arrested by any particular thought.  I\ncan only remember an entirely black dog which went trotting and\nturning before me as I mused.  In an instant the dog had\ndisappeared, the whole church had vanished, I no longer saw\nanything, . . . or more truly I saw, O my God, one thing alone. \n“Heavens, how can I speak of it?  Oh no! human words cannot\nattain to expressing the inexpressible.  Any description, however\nsublime it might be, could be but a profanation of the\nunspeakable truth.",
        "“I was there prostrate on the ground, bathed in my tears, with my\nheart beside itself, when M. B. called me back to life.  I could\nnot reply to the questions which followed from him one upon the\nother.  But finally I took the medal which I had on my breast,\nand with all the effusion of my soul I kissed the image of the\nVirgin, radiant with grace, which it bore.  Oh, indeed, it was\nShe! It was indeed She! [What he had seen had been a vision of\nthe Virgin.]",
        "“I did not know where I was:  I did not know whether I was\nAlphonse or another.  I only felt myself changed and believed\nmyself another me; I looked for myself in myself and did not find\nmyself.  In the bottom of my soul I felt an explosion of the most\nardent joy; I could not speak; I had no wish to reveal what had\nhappened.  But I felt something solemn and sacred within me which\nmade me ask for a priest.  I was led to one; and there alone,\nafter he had given me the positive order, I spoke as best I\ncould, kneeling, and with my heart still trembling.  I could give\nno account to myself of the truth of which I had acquired a\nknowledge and a faith.  All that I can say is that in an instant\nthe bandage had fallen from my eyes, and not one bandage only,\nbut the whole manifold of bandages in which I had been brought\nup.  One after another they rapidly disappeared, even as the mud\nand ice disappear under the rays of the burning sun.",
        "“I came out as from a sepulchre, from an abyss of darkness; and I\nwas living, perfectly living.  But I wept, for at the bottom of\nthat gulf I saw the extreme of misery from which I had been saved\nby an infinite mercy; and I shuddered at the sight of my\niniquities, stupefied, melted, overwhelmed with wonder and with\ngratitude.  You may ask me how I came to this new insight, for\ntruly I had never opened a book of religion nor even read a\nsingle page of the Bible, and the dogma of original sin is either\nentirely denied or forgotten by the Hebrews of to-day, so that I\nhad thought so little about it that I doubt whether I ever knew\nits name.  But how came I, then, to this perception of it?  I can\n<222> answer nothing save this, that on entering that church I\nwas in darkness altogether, and on coming out of it I saw the\nfullness of the light.  I can explain the change no better than\nby the simile of a profound sleep or the analogy of one born\nblind who should suddenly open his eyes to the day.  He sees, but\ncannot define the light which bathes him and by means of which he\nsees the objects which excite his wonder.  If we cannot explain\nphysical light, how can we explain the light which is the truth\nitself?  And I think I remain within the limits of veracity when\nI say that without having any knowledge of the letter of\nreligious doctrine, I now intuitively perceived its sense and\nspirit. Better than if I saw them, I FELT those hidden things; I\nfelt them by the inexplicable effects they produced in me.  It\nall happened in my interior mind, and those impressions, more\nrapid than thought shook my soul, revolved and turned it, as it\nwere, in another direction, towards other aims, by other paths. \nI express myself badly.  But do you wish, Lord, that I should\ninclose in poor and barren words sentiments which the heart alone\ncan understand?”",
        "I might multiply cases almost indefinitely, but these will\nsuffice to show you how real, definite, and memorable an event a\nsudden conversion may be to him who has the experience.\nThroughout the height of it he undoubtedly seems to himself a\npassive spectator or undergoer of an astounding process performed\nupon him from above.  There is too much evidence of this for any\ndoubt of it to be possible.  Theology, combining this fact with\nthe doctrines of election and grace, has concluded that the\nspirit of God is with us at these dramatic moments in a\npeculiarly miraculous way, unlike what happens at any other\njuncture of our lives.  At that moment, it believes, an\nabsolutely new nature is breathed into us, and we become\npartakers of the very substance of the Deity.",
        "That the conversion should be instantaneous seems called for on\nthis view, and the Moravian Protestants appear to have been the\nfirst to see this logical consequence.  The Methodists soon\nfollowed suit, practically if not dogmatically, and a short time\nere his death, John Wesley wrote:–",
        "“In London alone I found 652 members of our Society who were\nexceeding clear in their experience, and whose testimony I could\nsee no reason to doubt.  And every one of these (without a single\nexception) has declared that his deliverance from sin was\ninstantaneous; that the change was wrought in a moment.  Had half\nof these, or one third, or one in twenty, declared it was\nGRADUALLY wrought in THEM, I should have believed this, with\nregard to THEM, and thought that SOME were gradually sanctified\nand some instantaneously.  But as I have not found, in so long a\nspace of time, a single person speaking thus, I cannot but\nbelieve that sanctification is commonly, if not always, an\ninstantaneous work.\"[122]",
        "[122] Tyerman’s Life of Wesley, i. 463.",
        "All this while the more usual sects of Protestantism have set no\nsuch store by instantaneous conversion.  For them as for the\nCatholic Church, Christ’s blood, the sacraments, and the\nindividual’s ordinary religious duties are practically supposed\nto suffice to his salvation, even though no acute crisis of\nself-despair and surrender followed by relief should be\nexperienced.  For Methodism, on the contrary, unless there have\nbeen a crisis of this sort, salvation is only offered, not\neffectively received, and Christ’s sacrifice in so far forth is\nincomplete.  Methodism surely here follows, if not the healthier-\nminded, yet on the whole the profounder spiritual instinct. The\nindividual models which it has set up as typical and worthy of\nimitation are not only the more interesting dramatically, but\npsychologically they have been the more complete.",
        "In the fully evolved Revivalism of Great Britain and America we\nhave, so to speak, the codified and stereotyped procedure to\nwhich this way of thinking has led.  In spite of the\nunquestionable fact that saints of the once-born type exist, that\nthere may be a gradual growth in holiness without a cataclysm; in\nspite of the obvious leakage (as one may say) of much mere\nnatural goodness into the scheme of salvation; revivalism has\nalways assumed that only its own type of religious experience can\nbe perfect; you must first be nailed on the cross of natural\ndespair and agony, and then in the twinkling of an eye be\nmiraculously released.",
        "It is natural that those who personally have traversed such an\nexperience should carry away a feeling of its being a miracle\nrather than a natural process.  Voices are often heard, lights\nseen, or visions witnessed; automatic motor phenomena occur; and\nit always seems, after the surrender of the personal will, as if\nan extraneous higher power had flooded in and taken possession. \nMoreover the sense of renovation, safety, cleanness, rightness,\ncan be so marvelous and jubilant as well to warrant one’s belief\nin a radically new substantial nature.",
        "“Conversion,” writes the New England Puritan, Joseph Alleine, “is\nnot the putting in a patch of holiness; but with the true convert\nholiness is woven into all his powers, principles, and practice. \nThe sincere Christian is quite a new fabric, from the foundation\nto the top-stone.  He is a new man, a new creature.”",
        "And Jonathan Edwards says in the same strain:  “Those gracious\ninfluences which are the effects of the Spirit of God are\naltogether supernatural–are quite different from anything that\nunregenerate men experience.  They are what no improvement, or\ncomposition of natural qualifications or principles will ever\nproduce; because they not only differ from what is natural, and\nfrom everything that natural men experience in degree and\ncircumstances, but also in kind, and are of a nature far more\nexcellent. From hence it follows that in gracious affections\nthere are [also] new perceptions and sensations entirely\ndifferent in their nature and kind from anything experienced by\nthe [same] saints before they were sanctified. . . .  The\nconceptions which the saints have of the loveliness of God, and\nthat kind of delight which they experience in it, are quite\npeculiar, and entirely different from anything which a natural\nman can possess, or of which he can form any proper notion.”",
        "And that such a glorious transformation as this ought of\nnecessity to be preceded by despair is shown by Edwards in\nanother passage.",
        "“Surely it cannot be unreasonable,” he says, “that before God\ndelivers us from a state of sin and liability to everlasting woe,\nhe should give us some considerable sense of the evil from which\nhe delivers us, in order that we may know and feel the importance\nof salvation, and be enabled to appreciate the value of what God\nis pleased to do for us.  As those who are saved are successively\nin two extremely different states–first in a state of\ncondemnation and then in a state of justification and\nblessedness–and as God, in the salvation of men, deals with them\nas rational and intelligent creatures, it appears agreeable to\nthis wisdom, that those who are saved should be made sensible of\ntheir Being, in those two different states.  In the first place,\nthat they should be made sensible of their state of condemnation;\nand afterwards, of their state of deliverance and happiness.”",
        "Such quotations express sufficiently well for our purpose the\ndoctrinal interpretation of these changes.  Whatever part\nsuggestion and imitation may have played in producing them in men\nand women in excited assemblies, they have at any rate been in\ncountless individual instances an original and unborrowed\nexperience.  Were we writing the story of the mind from the\npurely natural-history point of view, with no religious interest\nwhatever, we should still have to write down man’s liability to\nsudden and complete conversion as one of his most curious\npeculiarities.",
        "What, now, must we ourselves think of this question?  Is an\ninstantaneous conversion a miracle in which God is present as he\nis present in no change of heart less strikingly abrupt? Are\nthere two classes of human beings, even among the apparently\nregenerate, of which the one class really partakes of Christ’s\nnature while the other merely seems to do so?  Or, on the\ncontrary, may the whole phenomenon of regeneration, even in these\nstartling instantaneous examples, possibly be a strictly natural\nprocess, divine in its fruits, of course, but in one case more\nand in another less so, and neither more nor less divine in its\nmere causation and mechanism than any other process, high or low,\nof man’s interior life?",
        "Before proceeding to answer this question, I must ask you to\nlisten to some more psychological remarks.  At our last lecture,\nI explained the shifting of men’s centres of personal energy\nwithin them and the lighting up of new crises of emotion.  I\nexplained the phenomena as partly due to explicitly conscious\nprocesses of thought and will, but as due largely also to the\nsubconscious incubation and maturing of motives deposited by the\nexperiences of life.  When ripe, the results hatch out, or burst\ninto flower.  I have now to speak of the subconscious region, in\nwhich such processes of flowering may occur, in a somewhat less\nvague way.  I only regret that my limits of time here force me to\nbe so short.",
        "The expression “field of consciousness” has but recently come\ninto vogue in the psychology books.  Until quite lately the unit\nof mental life which figured most was the single “idea,” supposed\nto be a definitely outlined thing.  But at present psychologists\nare tending, first, to admit that the actual unit is more\nprobably the total mental state, the entire wave of consciousness\nor field of objects present to the thought at any time; and,\nsecond, to see that it is impossible to outline this wave, this\nfield, with any definiteness.",
        "As our mental fields succeed one another, each has its centre of\ninterest, around which the objects of which we are less and less\nattentively conscious fade to a margin so faint that its limits\nare unassignable.  Some fields are narrow fields and some are\nwide fields.  Usually when we have a wide field we rejoice, for\nwe then see masses of truth together, and often get glimpses of\nrelations which we divine rather than see, for they shoot beyond\nthe field into still remoter regions of objectivity, regions\nwhich we seem rather to be about to perceive than to perceive\nactually.  At other times, of drowsiness, illness, or fatigue,\nour fields may narrow almost to a point, and we find ourselves\ncorrespondingly oppressed and contracted.",
        "Different individuals present constitutional differences in this\nmatter of width of field.  Your great organizing geniuses are men\nwith habitually vast fields of mental vision, in which a whole\nprogramme of future operations will appear dotted out at once,\nthe rays shooting far ahead into definite directions of advance. \nIn common people there is never this magnificent inclusive view\nof a topic.  They stumble along, feeling their way, as it were,\nfrom point to point, and often stop entirely.  In certain\ndiseased conditions consciousness is a mere spark, without memory\nof the past or thought of the future, and with the present\nnarrowed down to some one simple emotion or sensation of the\nbody.",
        "The important fact which this “field” formula commemorates is the\nindetermination of the margin.  Inattentively realized as is the\nmatter which the margin contains, it is nevertheless there, and\nhelps both to guide our behavior and to determine the next\nmovement of our attention.  It lies around us like a “magnetic\nfield,” inside of which our centre of energy turns like a\ncompass-needle, as the present phase of consciousness alters into\nits successor.  Our whole past store of memories floats beyond\nthis margin, ready at a touch to come in; and the entire mass of\nresidual powers, impulses, and knowledges that constitute our\nempirical self stretches continuously beyond it.  So vaguely\ndrawn are the outlines between what is actual and what is only\npotential at any moment of our conscious life, that it is always\nhard to say of certain mental elements whether we are conscious\nof them or not.",
        "The ordinary psychology, admitting fully the difficulty of\ntracing the marginal outline, has nevertheless taken for <228>\ngranted, first, that all the consciousness the person now has, be\nthe same focal or marginal, inattentive or attentive, is there in\nthe “field” of the moment, all dim and impossible to assign as\nthe latter’s outline may be; and, second, that what is absolutely\nextra-marginal is absolutely non-existent. and cannot be a fact\nof consciousness at all.",
        "And having reached this point, I must now ask you to recall what\nI said in my last lecture about the subconscious life.  I said,\nas you may recollect, that those who first laid stress upon these\nphenomena could not know the facts as we now know them.  My first\nduty now is to tell you what I meant by such a statement.",
        "I cannot but think that the most important step forward that has\noccurred in psychology since I have been a student of that\nscience is the discovery, first made in 1886, that, in certain\nsubjects at least, there is not only the consciousness of the\nordinary field, with its usual centre and margin, but an addition\nthereto in the shape of a set of memories, thoughts, and feelings\nwhich are extra-marginal and outside of the primary consciousness\naltogether, but yet must be classed as conscious facts of some\nsort, able to reveal their presence by unmistakable signs.  I\ncall this the most important step forward because, unlike the\nother advances which psychology has made, this discovery has\nrevealed to us an entirely unsuspected peculiarity in the\nconstitution of human nature.  No other step forward which\npsychology has made can proffer any such claim as this.",
        "In particular this discovery of a consciousness existing beyond\nthe field, or subliminally as Mr. Myers terms it, casts light on\nmany phenomena of religious biography.  That is why I have to\nadvert to it now, although it is naturally impossible for me in\nthis place to give you any account of the evidence on which the\nadmission of such a consciousness is based.  You will find it set\nforth in many recent books, Binet’s Alterations of\nPersonality[123] being perhaps as good a one as any to recommend.",
        "[123] Published in the International Scientific Series.",
        "The human material on which the demonstration has been made has\nso far been rather limited and, in part at least, eccentric,\nconsisting of unusually suggestible hypnotic subjects, and of\nhysteric patients.  Yet the elementary mechanisms of our life are\npresumably so uniform that what is shown to be true in a marked\ndegree of some persons is probably true in some degree of all,\nand may in a few be true in an extraordinarily high degree.",
        "The most important consequence of having a strongly developed\nultra-marginal life of this sort is that one’s ordinary fields of\nconsciousness are liable to incursions from it of which the\nsubject does not guess the source, and which, therefore, take for\nhim the form of unaccountable impulses to act, or inhibitions of\naction, of obsessive ideas, or even of hallucinations of sight or\nhearing.  The impulses may take the direction of automatic speech\nor writing, the meaning of which the subject himself may not\nunderstand even while he utters it; and generalizing this\nphenomenon, Mr. Myers has given the name of automatism, sensory\nor motor, emotional or intellectual, to this whole sphere of\neffects, due to “up-rushes” into the ordinary consciousness of\nenergies originating in the subliminal parts of the mind.",
        "The simplest instance of an automatism is the phenomenon of\npost-hypnotic suggestion, so-called.  You give to a hypnotized\nsubject, adequately susceptible, an order to perform some\ndesignated act–usual or eccentric, it makes no difference–\nafter he wakes from his hypnotic sleep. Punctually, when the\nsignal comes or the time elapses upon which you have told him\nthat the act must ensue, he performs it;–but in so doing he has\nno recollection of your suggestion, and he always trumps up an\nimprovised pretext for his behavior if the act be of an eccentric\nkind.  It may even be suggested to a subject to have a vision or\nto hear a voice at a certain interval after waking, and when the\ntime comes the vision is seen or the voice heard, with no inkling\non the subject’s part of its source.",
        "In the wonderful explorations by Binet, Janet, Breuer, Freud,\nMason, Prince, and others, of the subliminal consciousness of\npatients with hysteria, we have revealed to us whole systems of\nunderground life, in the shape of memories of a painful sort\nwhich lead a parasitic existence, buried outside of the primary\nfields of consciousness, and making irruptions thereinto with\nhallucinations, pains, convulsions, paralyses of feeling and of\nmotion, and the whole procession of symptoms of hysteric disease\nof body and of mind.  Alter or abolish by suggestion these\nsubconscious memories, and the patient immediately gets well. \nHis symptoms were automatisms, in Mr. Myers’s sense of the word. \nThese clinical records sound like fairy-tales when one first\nreads them, yet it is impossible to doubt their accuracy; and,\nthe path having been once opened by these first observers,\nsimilar observations have been made elsewhere.  They throw, as I\nsaid, a wholly new light upon our natural constitution.",
        "And it seems to me that they make a farther step inevitable.\nInterpreting the unknown after the analogy of the known, it seems\nto me that hereafter, wherever we meet with a phenomenon of\nautomatism, be it motor impulses, or obsessive idea, or\nunaccountable caprice, or delusion, or hallucination, we are\nbound first of all to make search whether it be not an explosion,\ninto the fields of ordinary consciousness, of ideas elaborated\noutside of those fields in subliminal regions of the mind.  We\nshould look, therefore, for its source in the Subject’s\nsubconscious life.  In the hypnotic cases, we ourselves create\nthe source by our suggestion, so we know it directly.  In the\nhysteric cases, the lost memories which are the source have to be\nextracted from the patient’s Subliminal by a number of ingenious\nmethods, for an account of which you must consult the books.  In\nother pathological cases, insane delusions, for example, or\npsychopathic obsessions, the source is yet to seek, but by\nanalogy it also should be in subliminal regions which\nimprovements in our methods may yet conceivably put on tap. There\nlies the mechanism logically to be assumed–but the assumption\ninvolves a vast program of work to be done in the way of\nverification, in which the religious experiences of man must play\ntheir part.[124]",
        "[124] The reader will here please notice that in my exclusive\nreliance in the last lecture on the subconscious “incubation” of\nmotives deposited by a growing experience, I followed the method\nof employing accepted principles of explanation as far as one\ncan.  The subliminal region, whatever else it may be, is at any\nrate a place now admitted by psychologists to exist for the\naccumulation of vestiges of sensible experience (whether\ninattentively or attentively registered), and for their\nelaboration according to ordinary psychological or logical laws\ninto results that end by attaining such a “tension\"that they may\nat times enter consciousness with something like a burst.  It\nthus is “scientific” to interpret all otherwise unaccountable\ninvasive alterations of consciousness as results of the tension\nof subliminal memories reaching the bursting-point.  But candor\nobliges me to confess that there are occasional bursts into\nconsciousness of results of which it is not easy to demonstrate\nany prolonged subconscious incubation.  Some of the cases I used\nto illustrate the sense of presence of the unseen in Lecture III\nwere of this order (compare pages 59, 60, 61, 66); and we\nshall see other experiences of the kind when we come to the\nsubject of mysticism.  The case of Mr. Bradley, that of M.\nRatisbonne, possibly that of Colonel Gardiner, possibly that of\nsaint Paul, might not be so easily explained in this simple way. \nThe result, then, would have to be ascribed either to a merely\nphysiological nerve storm, a “discharging lesion” like that of\nepilepsy; or, in case it were useful and rational, as in the two\nlatter cases named, to some more mystical or theological\nhypothesis. I make this remark in order that the reader may\nrealize that the subject is really complex.  But I shall keep\nmyself as far as possible at present to the more “scientific\"\nview; and only as the plot thickens in subsequent lectures shall\nI consider the question of its absolute sufficiency as an\nexplanation of all the facts.  That subconscious incubation\nexplains a great number of them, there can be no doubt.",
        "And thus I return to our own specific subject of instantaneous\nconversions.  You remember the cases of Alline, Bradley,\nBrainerd, and the graduate of Oxford converted at three in the\nafternoon.  Similar occurrences abound, some with and some\nwithout luminous visions, all with a sense of astonished\nhappiness, and of being wrought on by a higher control.  If,\nabstracting altogether from the question of their value for the\nfuture spiritual life of the individual, we take them on their\npsychological side exclusively, so many peculiarities in them\nremind us of what we find outside of conversion that we are\ntempted to class them along with other automatisms, and to\nsuspect that what makes the difference between a sudden and a\ngradual convert is not necessarily the presence of divine miracle\nin the case of one and of something less divine in that of the\nother, but rather a simple psychological peculiarity, the fact,\nnamely, that in the recipient of the more instantaneous grace we\nhave one of those Subjects who are in possession of a large\nregion in which mental work can go on subliminally, and from\nwhich invasive experiences, abruptly upsetting the equilibrium of\nthe primary consciousness, may come.",
        "I do not see why Methodists need object to such a view. Pray go\nback and recollect one of the conclusions to which I sought to\nlead you in my very first lecture.  You may remember how I there\nargued against the notion that the worth of a thing can be\ndecided by its origin.  Our spiritual judgment, I said, our\nopinion of the significance and value of a human event or\ncondition, must be decided on empirical grounds exclusively.  If\nthe fruits for life of the state of conversion are good, we ought\nto idealize and venerate it, even though it be a piece of natural\npsychology; if not, we ought to make short work with it, no\nmatter what supernatural being may have infused it.",
        "Well, how is it with these fruits?  If we except the class of\npreeminent saints of whom the names illumine history, and \nconsider only the usual run of “saints,” the shopkeeping\nchurch-members and ordinary youthful or middle-aged recipients of\ninstantaneous conversion, whether at revivals or in the\nspontaneous course of methodistic growth, you will probably agree\nthat no splendor worthy of a wholly supernatural creature\nfulgurates from them, or sets them apart from the mortals who\nhave never experienced that favor. Were it true that a suddenly\nconverted man as such is, as Edwards says,[125] of an entirely\ndifferent kind from a natural man, partaking as he does directly\nof Christ’s substance, there surely ought to be some exquisite\nclass-mark, some distinctive radiance attaching even to the\nlowliest specimen of this genus, to which no one of us could\nremain insensible, and which, so far as it went, would prove him\nmore excellent than ever the most highly gifted among mere\nnatural men.  But notoriously there is no such radiance. \nConverted men as a class are indistinguishable from natural men;\nsome natural men even excel some converted men in their fruits;\nand no one ignorant of doctrinal theology could guess by mere\nevery-day inspection of the “accidents” of the two groups of\npersons before him, that their substance differed as much as\ndivine differs from human substance.",
        "[125] Edwards says elsewhere:  “I am bold to say that the work of\nGod in the conversion of one soul, considered together with the\nsource foundation, and purchase of it, and also the benefit, end,\nand eternal issue of it, is a more glorious work of God than the\ncreation of the whole material universe.”",
        "The believers in the non-natural character of sudden conversion\nhave had practically to admit that there is no unmistakable\nclass-mark distinctive of all true converts.  The super-normal\nincidents, such as voices and visions and overpowering\nimpressions of the meaning of suddenly presented scripture texts,\nthe melting emotions and tumultuous affections connected with the\ncrisis of change, may all come by way of nature, or worse still,\nbe counterfeited by Satan.  The real witness of the spirit to the\nsecond birth is to be found only in the disposition of the\ngenuine child of God, the permanently patient heart, the love of\nself eradicated.  And this, it has to be admitted, is also found\nin those who pass no crisis, and may even be found outside of\nChristianity altogether.",
        "Throughout Jonathan Edwards’s admirably rich and delicate\ndescription of the supernaturally infused condition, in his\nTreatise on Religious Affections, there is not one decisive\ntrait, not one mark, that unmistakably parts it off from what may\npossibly be only an exceptionally high degree of natural\ngoodness.  In fact, one could hardly read a clearer argument than\nthis book unwittingly offers in favor of the thesis that no chasm\nexists between the orders of human excellence, but that here as\nelsewhere, nature shows continuous differences, and generation\nand regeneration are matters of degree.",
        "All which denial of two objective classes of human beings\nseparated by a chasm must not leave us blind to the extraordinary\nmomentousness of the fact of his conversion to the individual\nhimself who gets converted.  There are higher and lower limits of\npossibility set to each personal life.  If a flood but goes above\none’s head, its absolute elevation becomes a matter of small\nimportance; and when we touch our own upper limit and live in our\nown highest centre of energy, we may call ourselves saved, no\nmatter how much higher some one else’s centre may be.  A small\nman’s salvation will always be a great salvation and the greatest\nof all facts FOR HIM, and we should remember this when the fruits\nof our ordinary evangelicism look discouraging.  Who knows how\nmuch less ideal still the lives of these spiritual grubs and\nearthworms, these Crumps and Stigginses, might have been, if such\npoor grace as they have received had never touched them at\nall?[126]",
        "[126] Emerson writes:  “When we see a soul whose acts are regal, \ngraceful and pleasant as roses, we must thank God that such\nthings can be and are, and not turn sourly on the angel and say: \nCrump is a better man, with his grunting resistance to all his\nnative devils.”  True enough.  Yet Crump may really be the better\nCRUMP, for his inner discords and second birth; and your\nonce-born “regal” character though indeed always better than poor\nCrump, may fall far short of what he individually might be had he\nonly some Crump-like capacity for compunction over his own\npeculiar diabolisms, graceful and pleasant and invariably\ngentlemanly as these may be.",
        "<235> If we roughly arrange human beings in classes, each class\nstanding for a grade of spiritual excellence, I believe we shall\nfind natural men and converts both sudden and gradual in all the\nclasses.  The forms which regenerative change effects have, then,\nno general spiritual significance, but only a psychological\nsignificance.  We have seen how Starbuck’s laborious statistical\nstudies tend to assimilate conversion to ordinary spiritual\ngrowth.  Another American psychologist, Prof. George A. Coe,[127]\nhas analyzed the cases of seventy-seven converts or ex-candidates\nfor conversion, known to him, and the results strikingly confirm\nthe view that sudden conversion is connected with the possession\nof an active subliminal self.  Examining his subjects with\nreference to their hypnotic sensibility and to such automatisms\nas hypnagogic hallucinations, odd impulses, religious dreams\nabout the time of their conversion, etc., he found these\nrelatively much more frequent in the group of converts whose\ntransformation had been “striking,” “striking” transformation\nbeing defined as a change which, though not necessarily\ninstantaneous, seems to the subject of it to be distinctly\ndifferent from a process of growth, however rapid.\"[128]\nCandidates for conversion at revivals are, as you know, often\ndisappointed:  they experience nothing striking.  Professor Coe\nhad a number of persons of this class among his seventy-seven\nsubjects, and they almost all, when tested by hypnotism, proved\nto belong to a subclass which he calls “spontaneous,” that is,\nfertile in self-suggestions, as distinguished from a “passive\"\nsubclass, to which most of the subjects of striking\ntransformation belonged.  His inference is that self-suggestion\nof impossibility had prevented the influence upon these persons\nof an environment which, on the more “passive” subjects, had\neasily brought forth the effects they looked for.  Sharp\ndistinctions are difficult in these regions, and Professor Coe’s\nnumbers are small.  But his methods were careful, and the results\ntally with what one might expect; and they seem, on the whole, to\njustify his practical conclusion, which is that if you should\nexpose to a converting influence a subject in whom three factors\nunite:  first, pronounced emotional sensibility; second, tendency\nto automatisms; and third, suggestibility of the passive type;\nyou might then safely predict the result:  there would be a\nsudden conversion, a transformation of the striking kind.",
        "[127] In his book, The Spiritual Life, New York, 1900.",
        "[128] Op. cit., p. 112.",
        "Does this temperamental origin diminish the significance of the\nsudden conversion when it has occurred?  Not in the least, as\nProfessor Coe well says; for “the ultimate test of religious\nvalues is nothing psychological, nothing definable in terms of\nHOW IT HAPPENS, but something ethical, definable only in terms of\nWHAT IS ATTAINED.\"[129]",
        "[129] Op. cit., p. 144",
        "As we proceed farther in our inquiry we shall see that what is\nattained is often an altogether new level of spiritual vitality,\na relatively heroic level, in which impossible things have become\npossible, and new energies and endurances are shown.  The\npersonality is changed, the man is born anew, whether or not his\npsychological idiosyncrasies are what give the particular shape\nto his metamorphosis.  “Sanctification” is the technical name of\nthis result; and erelong examples of it shall be brought before\nyou.  In this lecture I have still only to add a few remarks on\nthe assurance and peace which fill the hour of change itself.",
        "One word more, though, before proceeding to that point, lest the\nfinal purpose of my explanation of suddenness by subliminal\nactivity be misunderstood.  I do indeed believe that if the\nSubject have no liability to such subconscious activity, or if\nhis conscious fields have a hard rind of a margin that resists\nincursions from beyond it, his conversion must he gradual if it\noccur, and must resemble any simple growth into new habits.  His\npossession of a developed subliminal self, and of a leaky or\npervious margin, is thus a conditio sine qua non of the Subject’s\nbecoming converted in the instantaneous way.  But if you, being\northodox Christians, ask me as a psychologist whether the\nreference of a phenomenon to a subliminal self does not exclude\nthe notion of the direct presence of the Deity altogether, I have\nto say frankly that as a psychologist I do not see why it\nnecessarily should.  The lower manifestations of the Subliminal,\nindeed, fall within the resources of the personal subject:  his\nordinary sense-material, inattentively taken in and\nsubconsciously remembered and combined, will account for all his\nusual automatisms.  But just as our primary wide-awake\nconsciousness throws open our senses to the touch of things\nmaterial so it is logically conceivable that IF THERE BE higher\nspiritual agencies that can directly touch us, the psychological\ncondition of their doing so MIGHT BE our possession of a\nsubconscious region which alone should yield access to them.  The\nhubbub of the waking life might close a door which in the dreamy\nSubliminal might remain ajar or open.",
        "Thus that perception of external control which is so essential a\nfeature in conversion might, in some cases at any rate, be\ninterpreted as the orthodox interpret it:  forces transcending\nthe finite individual might impress him, on condition of his\nbeing what we may call a subliminal human specimen.  But in any\ncase the VALUE of these forces would have to be determined by\ntheir effects, and the mere fact of their transcendency would of\nitself establish no presumption that they were more divine than\ndiabolical.",
        "I confess that this is the way in which I should rather see the\ntopic left lying in your minds until I come to a much later\nlecture, when I hope once more to gather these dropped threads\ntogether into more definitive conclusions.  The notion of a\nsubconscious self certainly ought not at this point of our\ninquiry to be held to EXCLUDE all notion of a higher penetration.",
        "If there be higher powers able to impress us, they may get access\nto us only through the subliminal door. (See below, p. 506 ff.)",
        "Let us turn now to the feelings which immediately fill the hour\nof the conversion experience.  The first one to be noted is just\nthis sense of higher control.  It is not always, but it is very\noften present.  We saw examples of it in Alline, Bradley,\nBrainerd, and elsewhere.  The need of such a higher controlling\nagency is well expressed in the short reference which the eminent\nFrench Protestant Adolphe Monod makes to the crisis of his own\nconversion.  It was at Naples in his early manhood, in the summer\nof 1827.",
        "“My sadness,” he says, “was without limit, and having got entire\npossession of me, it filled my life from the most indifferent\nexternal acts to the most secret thoughts, and corrupted at their\nsource my feelings, my judgment, and my happiness.  It was then\nthat I saw that to expect to put a stop to this disorder by my\nreason and my will, which were themselves diseased, would be to\nact like a blind man who should pretend to correct one of his\neyes by the aid of the other equally blind one.  I had then no\nresource save in some INFLUENCE FROM WITHOUT.  I remembered the\npromise of the Holy Ghost; and what the positive declarations of\nthe Gospel had never succeeded in bringing home to me, I learned\nat last from necessity, and believed, for the first time in my\nlife, in this promise, in the only sense in which it answered the\nneeds of my soul, in that, namely, of a real external\nsupernatural action, capable of giving me thoughts, and taking\nthem away from me, and exerted on me by a God as truly master of\nmy heart as he is of the rest of nature. Renouncing then all\nmerit, all strength, abandoning all my personal resources, and\nacknowledging no other title to his mercy than my own utter\nmisery, I went home and threw myself on my knees and prayed as I\nnever yet prayed in my life.  From this day onwards a new\ninterior life began for me:  not that my melancholy had\ndisappeared, but it had lost its sting.  Hope had entered into my\nheart, and once entered on the path, the God of Jesus Christ, to\nwhom I then had learned to give myself up, little by little did\nthe rest.\"[130]",
        "[130] I piece together a quotation made by W. Monod, in his book\nla Vie, and a letter printed in the work:  Adolphe Monod:  I,.\nSouvenirs de sa Vie, 1885, p. 433.",
        "It is needless to remind you once more of the admirable congruity\nof Protestant theology with the structure of the mind as shown in\nsuch experiences.  In the extreme of melancholy the self that\nconsciously is can do absolutely nothing. It is completely\nbankrupt and without resource, and no works it can accomplish\nwill avail.  Redemption from such subjective conditions must be a\nfree gift or nothing, and grace through Christ’s accomplished\nsacrifice is such a gift.",
        "“God,” says Luther, “is the God of the humble, the miserable, the\noppressed, and the desperate, and of those that are brought even\nto nothing; and his nature is to give sight to the blind, to\ncomfort the broken-hearted, to justify sinners, to save the very\ndesperate and damned.  Now that pernicious and pestilent opinion\nof man’s own righteousness, which will not be a sinner, unclean,\nmiserable, and damnable, but righteous and holy, suffereth not\nGod to come to his own natural and proper work.  Therefore God\nmust take this maul in hand (the law, I mean) to beat in pieces\nand bring to nothing this beast with her vain confidence, that\nshe may so learn at length by her own misery that she is utterly\nforlorn and damned.  But here lieth the difficulty, that when a\nman is terrified and cast down, he is so little able to raise\nhimself up again and say, ’Now I am bruised and afflicted enough;\nnow is the time of grace; now is the time to hear Christ.’  The\nfoolishness of man’s heart is so great that then he rather\nseeketh to himself more laws to satisfy his conscience.  ’If I\nlive,’ saith he, ’I will amend my life:  I will do this, I will\ndo that.’  But here, except thou do the quite contrary, except\nthou send Moses away with his law, and in these terrors and this\nanguish lay hold upon Christ who died for thy sins, look for no\nsalvation.  Thy cowl, thy shaven crown, thy chastity, thy\nobedience, thy poverty, thy works, thy merits?  what shall all\nthese do?  what shall the law of Moses avail?  If I, wretched and\ndamnable sinner, through works or merits could have loved the Son\nof God, and so come to him, what needed he to deliver himself for\nme?  If I, being a wretch and damned sinner, could be redeemed by\nany other price, what needed the Son of God to be given?  But\nbecause there was no other price, therefore he delivered neither\nsheep, ox, gold, nor silver, but even God himself, entirely and\nwholly ’for me,’ even ’for me,’ I say, a miserable, wretched\nsinner.  Now, therefore, I take comfort and apply this to MYSELF.",
        "And this manner of applying is the very true force and power of\nfaith.  For he died NOT to justify the righteous, but the\nUN-righteous, and to make THEM the children of God.\"[131]",

        "That is, the more literally lost you are, the more literally you\nare the very being whom Christ’s sacrifice has already saved. \nNothing in Catholic theology, I imagine, has ever spoken to sick\nsouls as straight as this message from Luther’s personal\nexperience.  As Protestants are not all sick souls, of course\nreliance on what Luther exults in calling the dung of one’s\nmerits, the filthy puddle of one’s own righteousness, has come to\nthe front again in their religion; but the adequacy of his view\nof Christianity to the deeper parts of our human mental structure\nis shown by its wildfire contagiousness when it was a new and\nquickening thing.",
        "Faith that Christ has genuinely done his work was part of \nwhat Luther meant by faith, which so far is faith in a fact\nintellectually conceived of.  But this is only one part of\nLuther’s faith, the other part being far more vital.  This other\npart is something not intellectual but immediate and intuitive,\nthe assurance, namely, that I, this individual I, just as I\nstand, without one plea, etc., am saved now and forever. [132]\nProfessor Leuba is undoubtedly right in contending that the\nconceptual belief about Christ’s work, although so often\nefficacious and antecedent, is really accessory and\nnon-essential, and that the “joyous conviction” can also come by\nfar other channels than this conception.  It is to the joyous\nconviction itself, the assurance that all is well with one, that\nhe would give the name of faith par excellence.  “When the sense\nof estrangement,” he writes, “fencing man about in a narrowly\nlimited ego, breaks down, the individual finds himself ’at one\nwith all creation.’ He lives in the universal life; he and man,\nhe and nature, he and God, are one.  That state of confidence,\ntrust, union with all things, following upon the achievement of\nmoral unity, is the Faith-state.  Various dogmatic beliefs\nsuddenly, on the advent of the faith-state, acquire a character\nof certainty, assume a new reality, become an object of faith. \nAs the ground of assurance here is not rational, argumentation is\nirrelevant.  But such conviction being a mere casual offshoot of\nthe faith-state, it is a gross error to imagine that the chief\npractical value of the faith-state is its power to stamp with the\nseal of reality certain particular theological conceptions.[133]\nOn the contrary, its value lies solely in the fact that it is the\npsychic correlate of a biological growth reducing contending\ndesires to one direction; a growth which expresses itself in new\naffective states and new reactions; in larger, nobler, more\nChrist-like activities.  The ground of the specific assurance in\nreligious dogmas is then an affective experience.  The objects of\nfaith may even be preposterous; the affective stream will float\nthem along, and invest them with unshakable certitude.  The more\nstartling the affective experience, the less explicable it seems,\nthe easier it is to make it the carrier of unsubstantiated\nnotions.\"[134]",

        "“Whilst I was reading the evangelical treatise, I was soon struck\nby an expression:  ’the finished work of Christ.’ ’Why,’ I asked\nof myself, ’does the author use these terms?  Why does he not say\n“the atoning work”?’ Then these words, ’It is finished,’\npresented themselves to my mind.  ’What is it that is finished?’\nI asked, and in an instant my mind replied:  ’A perfect expiation\nfor sin; entire satisfaction has been given; the debt has been\npaid by the Substitute. Christ has died for our sins; not for\nours only, but for those of all men.  If, then, the entire work\nis finished, all the debt paid, what remains for me to do?’ In\nanother instant the light was shed through my mind by the Holy\nGhost, and the joyous conviction was given me that nothing more\nwas to be done, save to fall on my knees, to accept this Saviour\nand his love, to praise God forever.”  Autobiography of Hudson\nTaylor.  I translate back into English from the French\ntranslation of Challand (Geneva, no date), the original not being\naccessible.",
        "[133] Tolstoy’s case was a good comment on those words.  There\nwas almost no theology in his conversion.  His faith-state was\nthe sense come back that life was infinite in its moral\nsignificance.",
        "[134] American Journal of Psychology, vii. 345-347, abridged.",
        "The characteristics of the affective experience which, to avoid\nambiguity, should, I think, be called the state of assurance\nrather than the faith-state, can be easily enumerated, though it\nis probably difficult to realize their intensity, unless one has\nbeen through the experience one’s self.",
        "The central one is the loss of all the worry, the sense that all\nis ultimately well with one, the peace, the harmony, the\nWILLINGNESS TO BE, even though the outer conditions should remain\nthe same.  The certainty of God’s “grace,” of “justification,\"\n“salvation,” is an objective belief that usually accompanies the\nchange in Christians; but this may be entirely lacking and yet\nthe affective peace remain the same–you will recollect the case\nof the Oxford graduate:  and many might be given where the\nassurance of personal salvation <243> was only a later result. \nA passion of willingness, of acquiescence, of admiration, is the\nglowing centre of this state of mind.",
        "The second feature is the sense of perceiving truths not known\nbefore.  The mysteries of life become lucid, as Professor Leuba\nsays; and often, nay usually, the solution is more or less\nunutterable in words.  But these more intellectual phenomena may\nbe postponed until we treat of mysticism.",
        "A third peculiarity of the assurance state is the objective\nchange which the world often appears to undergo.  “An appearance\nof newness beautifies every object,” the precise opposite of that\nother sort of newness, that dreadful unreality and strangeness in\nthe appearance of the world, which is experienced by melancholy\npatients, and of which you may recall my relating some\nexamples.[135] This sense of clean and beautiful newness within\nand without is one of the commonest entries in conversion\nrecords. Jonathan Edwards thus describes it in himself:–",
        "[135] Above, p. 150.",
        "“After this my sense of divine things gradually increased, and\nbecame more and more lively, and had more of that inward\nsweetness.  The appearance of everything was altered; there\nseemed to be, as it were, a calm, sweet cast, or appearance of\ndivine glory, in almost everything.  God’s excellency, his\nwisdom, his purity and love, seemed to appear in everything; in\nthe sun, moon, and stars; in the clouds and blue sky; in the\ngrass, flowers, and trees; in the water and all nature; which\nused greatly to fix my mind.  And scarce anything, among all the\nworks of nature, was so sweet to me as thunder and lightning;\nformerly nothing had been so terrible to me.  Before, I used to\nbe uncommonly terrified with thunder, and to be struck with\nterror when I saw a thunderstorm rising; but now, on the\ncontrary, it rejoices me.\"[136]",
        "[136] Dwight:  Life of Edwards, New York, 1830, p. 61, abridged.",
        "<244> Billy Bray, an excellent little illiterate English\nevangelist, records his sense of newness thus:–",
        "“I said to the Lord:  ’Thou hast said, they that ask shall\nreceive, they that seek shall find, and to them that knock the\ndoor shall be opened, and I have faith to believe it.’ In an\ninstant the Lord made me so happy that I cannot express what I\nfelt.  I shouted for joy.  I praised God with my whole heart. . .\n. I think this was in November, 1823, but what day of the month\nI do not know.  I remember this, that everything looked new to\nme, the people, the fields, the cattle, the trees.  I was like a\nnew man in a new world.  I spent the greater part of my time in\npraising the Lord.\"[137]",
        "[137] W. F. Bourne:  The King’s Son, a Memoir of Billy Bray,\nLondon, Hamilton, Adams & Co., 1887, p. 9.",
        "Starbuck and Leuba both illustrate this sense of newness by\nquotations.  I take the two following from Starbuck’s manuscript\ncollection.  One, a woman, says:–",
        "“I was taken to a camp-meeting, mother and religious friends\nseeking and praying for my conversion.  My emotional nature was\nstirred to its depths; confessions of depravity and pleading with\nGod for salvation from sin made me oblivious of all surroundings.\nI plead for mercy, and had a vivid realization of forgiveness and\nrenewal of my nature.  When rising from my knees I exclaimed,\n’Old things have passed away, all things have become new.’ It was\nlike entering another world, a new state of existence.  Natural\nobjects were glorified, my spiritual vision was so clarified that\nI saw beauty in every material object in the universe, the woods\nwere vocal with heavenly music; my soul exulted in the love of\nGod, and I wanted everybody to share in my joy.”",
        "The next case is that of a man:–",
        "“I know not how I got back into the encampment, but found myself\nstaggering up to Rev. ––’s Holiness tent–and as it was full of\nseekers and a terrible noise inside, some groaning, some\nlaughing, and some shouting, and by a large oak, ten feet from\nthe tent, I fell on my face by a bench, and tried to pray, and\nevery time I would call on God, something like a man’s hand would\nstrangle me by choking.  I don’t know whether there were any one\naround or near me or not.  I thought I should surely die if I did\nnot get help, but just as often as I would pray, that unseen hand\nwas felt on my throat and my breath squeezed off. Finally\nsomething said:  ’Venture on the atonement, for you will die\nanyway if you don’t.’  So I made one final struggle to call on\nGod for mercy, with the same choking and strangling, determined\nto finish the sentence of prayer for Mercy, if I did strangle and\ndie, and the last I remember that time was falling back on the\nground with the same unseen hand on my throat.  I don’t know how\nlong I lay there or what was going on.  None of my folks were\npresent.  When I came to myself, there were a crowd around me\npraising God.  The very heavens seemed to open and pour down rays\nof light and glory.  Not for a moment only, but all day and\nnight, floods of light and glory seemed to pour through my soul,\nand oh, how I was changed, and everything became new.  My horses\nand hogs and even everybody seemed changed.”",
        "This man’s case introduces the feature of automatisms, which in\nsuggestible subjects have been so startling a feature at revivals\nsince, in Edwards’s, Wesley’s and Whitfield’s time, these became\na regular means of gospel-propagation.  They were at first\nsupposed to be semi-miraculous proofs of “power” on the part of\nthe Holy Ghost; but great divergence of opinion quickly arose\nconcerning them.  Edwards, in his Thoughts on the Revival of\nReligion in New England, has to defend them against their\ncritics; and their value has long been matter of debate even\nwithin the revivalistic denominations.[138] They undoubtedly have\nno essential spiritual significance, and although their presence\nmakes his conversion more memorable to the convert, it has never\nbeen proved that converts who show them are more persevering or\nfertile in good fruits than those whose change of heart has had\nless violent accompaniments.  On the whole, unconsciousness,\nconvulsions, visions, involuntary vocal utterances, and\nsuffocation, must be simply ascribed to the subject’s having a\nlarge subliminal region, involving nervous instability. This is\noften the subject’s own view of the matter afterwards.  One of\nStarbuck’s correspondents writes, for instance:–",
        "[138] Consult William B. Sprague:  Lectures on Revivals of\nReligion, New York, 1832, in the long Appendix to which the\nopinions of a large number of ministers are given.",
        "“I have been through the experience which is known as conversion.\nMy explanation of it is this:  the subject works his emotions up\nto the breaking point, at the same time resisting their physical\nmanifestations, such as quickened pulse, etc., and then suddenly\nlets them have their full sway over his body.  The relief is\nsomething wonderful, and the pleasurable effects of the emotions\nare experienced to the highest degree.”",
        "There is one form of sensory automatism which possibly deserves\nspecial notice on account of its frequency.  I refer to\nhallucinatory or pseudo-hallucinatory luminous phenomena,\nphotisms, to use the term of the psychologists.  Saint Paul’s\nblinding heavenly vision seems to have been a phenomenon of this\nsort; so does Constantine’s cross in the sky.  The last case but\none which I quoted mentions floods of light and glory.  Henry\nAlline mentions a light, about whose externality he seems\nuncertain.  Colonel Gardiner sees a blazing light.  President\nFinney writes:–",
        "“All at once the glory of God shone upon and round about me in a\nmanner almost marvelous. . . . A light perfectly ineffable shone\nin my soul, that almost prostrated me on the ground. . . . This\nlight seemed like the brightness of the sun in every direction. \nIt was too intense for the eyes. . . . I think I knew something\nthen, by actual experience, of that light that prostrated Paul on\nthe way to Damascus.  It was surely a light such as I could not\nhave endured long.\"[139]",
        "[139] Memoirs, p. 34",
        "Such reports of photisms are indeed far from uncommon. Here is\nanother from Starbuck’s collection, where the light appeared\nevidently external:–",
        "“I had attended a series of revival services for about two weeks\noff and on.  Had been invited to the altar several times, all the\ntime becoming more deeply impressed, when finally I decided I\nmust do this, or I should be lost.  Realization of conversion was\nvery vivid, like a ton’s weight being lifted from my heart; a\nstrange light which seemed to light up the whole room (for it was\ndark); a conscious supreme bliss which caused me to repeat ’Glory\nto God’ for a long time.  Decided to be God’s child for life, and\nto give up my pet ambition, wealth and social position.  My\nformer habits of life hindered my growth somewhat, but I set\nabout overcoming these systematically, and in one year my whole\nnature was changed, i. e., my ambitions were of a different\norder.”",
        "Here is another one of Starbuck’s cases, involving a luminous\nelement:–",
        "“I had been clearly converted twenty-three years before, or\nrather reclaimed.  My experience in regeneration was then clear\nand spiritual, and I had not backslidden.  But I experienced\nentire sanctification on the 15th day of March, 1893, about\neleven o’clock in the morning.  The particular accompaniments of\nthe experience were entirely unexpected.  I was quietly sitting\nat home singing selections out of Pentecostal Hymns.  Suddenly\nthere seemed to be a something sweeping into me and inflating my\nentire being–such a sensation as I had never experienced before.",
        "When this experience came, I seemed to be conducted around a\nlarge, capacious, well-lighted room.  As I walked with my\ninvisible conductor and looked around, a clear thought was coined\nin my mind, ’They are not here, they are gone.’  As soon as the\nthought was definitely formed in my mind, though no word was\nspoken, the Holy Spirit impressed me that I was surveying my\nown soul.  Then, for the first time in all my life, did I know\nthat I was cleansed from all sin, and filled with the fullness of\nGod.”",
        "Leuba quotes the case of a Mr. Peek, where the luminous affection\nreminds one of the chromatic hallucinations produced by the\nintoxicant cactus buds called mescal by the Mexicans:–",
        "“When I went in the morning into the fields to work, the glory of\nGod appeared in all his visible creation.  I well remember we\nreaped oats, and how every straw and head of the oats seemed, as\nit were, arrayed in a kind of rainbow glory, or to glow, if I may\nso express it, in the glory of God.\"[140]",
        "[140] These reports of sensorial photism shade off into what are\nevidently only metaphorical accounts of the sense of new\nspiritual illumination, as, for instance, in Brainerd’s\nstatement:  “As I was walking in a thick grove, unspeakable glory\nseemed to open to the apprehension of my soul.  I do not mean any\nexternal brightness, for I saw no such thing, nor any imagination\nof a body of light in the third heavens, or anything of that\nnature, but it was a new inward apprehension or view that I had\nof God.”",
        "In a case like this next one from Starbuck’s manuscript\ncollection the lighting up of the darkness is probably also\nmetaphorical:–",
        "“One Sunday night, I resolved that when I got home to the ranch\nwhere I was working, I would offer myself with my faculties and\nall to God to be used only by and for him. . . .  It was raining\nand the roads were muddy; but this desire grew so strong that I\nkneeled down by the side of the road and told God all about it,\nintending then to get up and go on.  Such a thing as any special\nanswer to my prayer never entered my mind, having been converted\nby faith, but still being most undoubtedly saved.  Well, while I\nwas praying, I remember holding out my hands to God and telling\nhim they should work for him, my feet walk for him, my tongue\nspeak for him, etc., etc., if he would only use me as his\ninstrument and give me a satisfying experience–when suddenly the\ndarkness of the night seemed lit up–I felt, realized, knew, that\nGod heard and answered my prayer. Deep happiness came over me; I\nfelt I was accepted into the inner circle of God’s loved ones.”",
        "In the following case also the flash of light is metaphorical:–",
        "“A prayer meeting had been called for at close of evening\nservice. The minister supposed me impressed by his discourse (a\nmistake–he was dull).  He came and, placing his hand upon my\nshoulder, said:  ’Do you not want to give your heart to God?’  I\nreplied in the affirmative.  Then said he, ’Come to the front\nseat.’  They sang and prayed and talked with me.  I experienced\nnothing but unaccountable wretchedness. They declared that the\nreason why I did not ’obtain peace’ was because I was not willing\nto give up all to God.  After about two hours the minister said\nwe would go home.  As usual, on retiring, I prayed.  In great\ndistress, I at this time simply said, ’Lord, I have done all I\ncan, I leave the whole matter with thee.’  Immediately, like a\nflash of light, there came to me a great peace, and I arose and\nwent into my parents’ bedroom and said, ’I do feel so wonderfully\nhappy.’  This I regard as the hour of conversion.  It was the\nhour in which I became assured of divine acceptance and favor. \nSo far as my life was concerned, it made little immediate\nchange.”",
        "The most characteristic of all the elements of the conversion\ncrisis, and the last one of which I shall speak, is the ecstasy\nof happiness produced.  We have already heard several accounts of\nit, but I will add a couple more.  President Finney’s is so vivid\nthat I give it at length:–",
        "“All my feelings seemed to rise and flow out; and the utterance\nof my heart was, ’I want to pour my whole soul out to God.’ The\nrising of my soul was so great that I rushed into the back room\nof the front office, to pray.  There was no fire and no light in\nthe room; nevertheless it appeared to me as if it were perfectly\nlight.  As I went in and shut the door after me, it seemed as if\nI met the Lord Jesus Christ face to face.  It did not occur to me\nthen, nor did it for some time afterwards, that it was wholly a\nmental state.  On the contrary, it seemed to me that I saw him as\nI would see any other man.  He said nothing but looked at me in\nsuch a manner as to break me right down at his feet.  I have\nalways since regarded this as a most remarkable state of mind;\nfor it seemed to me a reality that he stood before me, and I fell\ndown at his feet and poured out my soul to him.  I wept aloud\nlike a child, and made such confessions as I could with my choked\nutterance.  It seemed to me that I bathed his feet with my tears;\nand yet I had no distinct impression that I touched him, that I\nrecollect.  I must have continued in this state for a good while,\nbut my mind was too absorbed with the interview to recollect\nanything that I said.  But I know, as soon as my mind became calm\nenough to break off from the interview, I returned to the front\noffice, and found that the fire that I had made of large wood was\nnearly burned out.  But as I turned and was about to take a seat\nby the fire, I received a mighty baptism of the Holy Ghost. \nWithout any expectation of it, without ever having the thought in\nmy mind that there was any such thing for me, without any\nrecollection that I had ever heard the thing mentioned by any\nperson in the world, the Holy Spirit descended upon me in a\nmanner that seemed to go through me, body and soul.  I could feel\nthe impression, like a wave of electricity, going through and\nthrough me.  Indeed, it seemed to come in waves and waves of\nliquid love; for I could not express it in any other way.  It\nseemed like the very breath of God.  I can recollect distinctly\nthat it seemed to fan me, like immense wings.",
        "“No words can express the wonderful love that was shed abroad in\nmy heart.  I wept aloud with joy and love; and I do not know but\nI should say I literally bellowed out the unutterable gushings of\nmy heart.  These waves came over me, and over me, and over me,\none after the other, until I recollect I cried out, ’I shall die\nif these waves continue to pass over me.’  I said, ’Lord, I\ncannot bear any more;’ yet I had no fear of death.",
        "“How long I continued in this state, with this baptism continuing\nto roll over me and go through me, I do not know.  But I know it\nwas late in the evening when a member of my choir –for I was the\nleader of the choir–came into the office to see me.  He was a\nmember of the church.  He found me in this state of loud weeping,\nand said to me, ’Mr. Finney, what ails you?’  I could make him no\nanswer for some time.  He then said, ’Are you in pain?’ I\ngathered myself up as best I could, and replied, ’No, but so\nhappy that I cannot live.’”",
        "I just now quoted Billy Bray; I cannot do better than give his\nown brief account of his post-conversion feelings:–",
        "“I can’t help praising the Lord.  As I go along the street, I\nlift up one foot, and it seems to say ’Glory’; and I lift up the\nother, and it seems to say ’Amen’; and so they keep up like that\nall the time I am walking.\"[141]",
        "[141] I add in a note a few more records:–",
        "“One morning, being in deep distress, fearing every moment I\nshould drop into hell, I was constrained to cry in earnest for\nmercy, and the Lord came to my relief, and delivered my soul from\nthe burden and guilt of sin.  My whole frame was in a tremor from\nhead to foot, and my soul enjoyed sweet peace.  The pleasure I\nthen felt was indescribable.  The happiness lasted about three\ndays, during which time I never spoke to any person about my\nfeelings.”  Autobiography of Dan Young, edited by W. P.\nStrickland, New York, 1860.",
        "“In an instant there rose up in me such a sense of God’s taking\ncare of those who put their trust in him that for an hour all the\nworld was crystalline, the heavens were lucid, and I sprang to my\nfeet and began to cry and laugh.”  H. W. Beecher, quoted by\nLeuba.",
        "“My tears of sorrow changed to joy, and I lay there praising God\nin such ecstasy of joy as only the soul who experiences it can\nrealize.” –\"I cannot express how I felt.  It was as if I had\nbeen in a dark dungeon and lifted into the light of the sun.  I\nshouted and I sang praise unto him who loved me and washed me\nfrom my sins.  I was forced to retire into a secret place, for\nthe tears did flow, and I did not wish my shopmates to see me,\nand yet I could not keep it a secret.\"–\"I experienced joy almost\nto weeping.\"–\"I felt my face must have shone like that of Moses.",
        "I had a general feeling of buoyancy.  It was the greatest joy it\nwas ever my lot to experience.\"–\"I wept and laughed alternately.",
        "I was as light as if walking on air.  I felt as if I had gained\ngreater peace and happiness than I had ever expected to\nexperience.” Starbuck’s correspondents.",
        "One word, before I close this lecture, on the question of the\ntransiency or permanence of these abrupt conversions. Some of\nyou, I feel sure, knowing that numerous backslidings and relapses\ntake place, make of these their apperceiving mass for\ninterpreting the whole subject, and dismiss it with a pitying\nsmile at so much “hysterics.”  Psychologically, as well as\nreligiously, however, this is shallow.  It misses the point of\nserious interest, which is not so much the duration as the nature\nand quality of these shiftings of character to higher levels. \nMen lapse from every level–we need no statistics to tell us\nthat.  Love is, for instance, well known not to be irrevocable,\nyet, constant or inconstant, it reveals new flights and reaches\nof ideality while it lasts.  These revelations form its\nsignificance to men and women, whatever be its duration.  So\nwith the conversion experience:  that it should for even a short\ntime show a human being what the high- water mark of his\nspiritual capacity is, this is what constitutes its\nimportance–an importance which backsliding cannot diminish,\nalthough persistence might increase it.  As a matter of fact, all\nthe more striking instances of conversion, all those, for\ninstance, which I have quoted, HAVE been permanent.  The case of\nwhich there might be most doubt, on account of its suggesting so\nstrongly an epileptoid seizure, was the case of M. Ratisbonne. \nYet I am informed that Ratisbonne’s whole future was shaped by\nthose few minutes. He gave up his project of marriage, became a\npriest, founded at Jerusalem, where he went to dwell, a mission\nof nuns for the conversion of the Jews, showed no tendency to use\nfor egotistic purposes the notoriety given him by the peculiar\ncircumstances of his conversion–which, for the rest, he could\nseldom refer to without tears–and in short remained an exemplary\nson of the Church until he died, late in the 80’s, if I remember\nrightly.",
        "The only statistics I know of, on the subject of the duration of\nconversions, are those collected for Professor Starbuck by Miss\nJohnston.  They embrace only a hundred persons, evangelical\nchurch-members, more than half being Methodists.  According to\nthe statement of the subjects themselves, there had been\nbacksliding of some sort in nearly all the cases, 93 per cent. of\nthe women, 77 per cent. of the men.  Discussing the returns more\nminutely, Starbuck finds that only 6 per cent. are relapses from\nthe religious faith which the conversion confirmed, and that the\nbacksliding complained of is in most only a fluctuation in the\nardor of sentiment.  Only six of the hundred cases report a\nchange of faith.  Starbuck’s conclusion is that the effect of\nconversion is to bring with it “a changed attitude towards life,\nwhich is fairly constant and permanent, although the feelings\nfluctuate. . . . In other words, the persons who have passed\nthrough conversion, having once taken a stand for the religious\nlife, tend to feel themselves identified with it, no matter how\nmuch their religious enthusiasm declines.\"[142]",
