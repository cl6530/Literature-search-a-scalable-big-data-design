        "There was once a boy in the County Mayo; Guleesh was his name. There\nwas the finest rath a little way off from the gable of the house,\nand he was often in the habit of seating himself on the fine grass\nbank that was running round it. One night he stood, half leaning\nagainst the gable of the house, and looking up into the sky, and\nwatching the beautiful white moon over his head. After he had been\nstanding that way for a couple of hours, he said to himself: “My\nbitter grief that I am not gone away out of this place altogether.\nI’d sooner be any place in the world than here. Och, it’s well for\nyou, white moon,” says he, “that’s turning round, turning round, as\nyou please yourself, and no man can put you back. I wish I was the\nsame as you.”",
        "Hardly was the word out of his mouth when he heard a great noise\ncoming like the sound of many people running together, and talking,\nand laughing, and making sport, and the sound went by him like a\nwhirl of wind, and he was listening to it going into the rath.\n“Musha, by my soul,” says he, “but ye’re merry enough, and I’ll\nfollow ye.”",
        "What was in it but the fairy host, though he did not know at first\nthat it was they who were in it, but he followed them into the rath.\nIt’s there he heard the fulparnee, and the folpornee, the\nrap-lay-hoota, and the roolya-boolya, that they had there,\nand every man of them crying out as loud as he could: “My horse,\nand bridle, and saddle! My horse, and bridle, and saddle!”",
        "“By my hand,” said Guleesh, “my boy, that’s not bad. I’ll imitate\nye,” and he cried out as well as they: “My horse, and bridle, and\nsaddle! My horse, and bridle, and saddle!” And on the moment there\nwas a fine horse with a bridle of gold, and a saddle of silver,\nstanding before him. He leaped up on it, and the moment he was on\nits back he saw clearly that the rath was full of horses, and of\nlittle people going riding on them.",
        "Said a man of them to him: “Are you coming with us to-night,\nGuleesh?”",
        "“I am surely,” said Guleesh.",
        "“If you are, come along,” said the little man, and out they went all\ntogether, riding like the wind, faster than the fastest horse ever\nyou saw a-hunting, and faster than the fox and the hounds at his\ntail.",
        "The cold winter’s wind that was before them, they overtook her, and\nthe cold winter’s wind that was behind them, she did not overtake\nthem. And stop nor stay of that full race, did they make none, until\nthey came to the brink of the sea.",
        "Then every one of them said: “Hie over cap! Hie over cap!” and that\nmoment they were up in the air, and before Guleesh had time to\nremember where he was, they were down on dry land again, and were\ngoing like the wind.",
        "At last they stood still, and a man of them said to Guleesh:\n“Guleesh, do you know where you are now?”",
        "“Not a know,” says Guleesh.",
        "“You’re in France, Guleesh,” said he. “The daughter of the king of\nFrance is to be married to-night, the handsomest woman that the sun\never saw, and we must do our best to bring her with us; if we’re\nonly able to carry her off; and you must come with us that we may be\nable to put the young girl up behind you on the horse, when we’ll be\nbringing her away, for it’s not lawful for us to put her sitting\nbehind ourselves. But you’re flesh and blood, and she can take a\ngood grip of you, so that she won’t fall off the horse. Are you\nsatisfied, Guleesh, and will you do what we’re telling you?”",
        "“Why shouldn’t I be satisfied?” said Guleesh. “I’m satisfied,\nsurely, and anything that ye will tell me to do I’ll do it without\ndoubt.”",
        "They got off their horses there, and a man of them said a word that\nGuleesh did not understand, and on the moment they were lifted up,\nand Guleesh found himself and his companions in the palace. There\nwas a great feast going on there, and there was not a nobleman or a\ngentleman in the kingdom but was gathered there, dressed in silk and\nsatin, and gold and silver, and the night was as bright as the day\nwith all the lamps and candles that were lit, and Guleesh had to\nshut his two eyes at the brightness. When he opened them again and\nlooked from him, he thought he never saw anything as fine as all he\nsaw there. There were a hundred tables spread out, and their full of\nmeat and drink on each table of them, flesh-meat, and cakes and\nsweetmeats, and wine and ale, and every drink that ever a man saw.\nThe musicians were at the two ends of the hall, and they were\nplaying the sweetest music that ever a man’s ear heard, and there\nwere young women and fine youths in the middle of the hall, dancing\nand turning, and going round so quickly and so lightly, that it put\na soorawn in Guleesh’s head to be looking at them. There were\nmore there playing tricks, and more making fun and laughing, for\nsuch a feast as there was that day had not been in France for twenty\nyears, because the old king had no children alive but only the one\ndaughter, and she was to be married to the son of another king that\nnight. Three days the feast was going on, and the third night she\nwas to be married, and that was the night that Guleesh and the\nsheehogues came, hoping, if they could, to carry off with them the\nking’s young daughter.",
        "Guleesh and his companions were standing together at the head of the\nhall, where there was a fine altar dressed up, and two bishops\nbehind it waiting to marry the girl, as soon as the right time\nshould come. Now nobody could see the sheehogues, for they said a\nword as they came in, that made them all invisible, as if they had\nnot been in it at all.",
        "“Tell me which of them is the king’s daughter,” said Guleesh, when\nhe was becoming a little used to the noise and the light.",
        "“Don’t you see her there away from you?” said the little man that he\nwas talking to.",
        "Guleesh looked where the little man was pointing with his finger,\nand there he saw the loveliest woman that was, he thought, upon the\nridge of the world. The rose and the lily were fighting together in\nher face, and one could not tell which of them got the victory. Her\narms and hands were like the lime, her mouth as red as a strawberry\nwhen it is ripe, her foot was as small and as light as another one’s\nhand, her form was smooth and slender, and her hair was falling down\nfrom her head in buckles of gold. Her garments and dress were woven\nwith gold and silver, and the bright stone that was in the ring on\nher hand was as shining as the sun.",
        "Guleesh was nearly blinded with all the loveliness and beauty that\nwas in her; but when he looked again, he saw that she was crying,\nand that there was the trace of tears in her eyes. “It can’t be,\"\nsaid Guleesh, “that there’s grief on her, when everybody round her\nis so full of sport and merriment.”",
        "“Musha, then, she is grieved,” said the little man; “for it’s\nagainst her own will she’s marrying, and she has no love for the\nhusband she is to marry. The king was going to give her to him three\nyears ago, when she was only fifteen, but she said she was too\nyoung, and requested him to leave her as she was yet. The king gave\nher a year’s grace, and when that year was up he gave her another\nyear’s grace, and then another; but a week or a day he would not\ngive her longer, and she is eighteen years old to-night, and it’s\ntime for her to marry; but, indeed,” says he, and he crooked his\nmouth in an ugly way–\"indeed, it’s no king’s son she’ll marry, if I\ncan help it.”",
        "Guleesh pitied the handsome young lady greatly when he heard that,\nand he was heart-broken to think that it would be necessary for her\nto marry a man she did not like, or, what was worse, to take a nasty\nsheehogue for a husband. However, he did not say a word, though he\ncould not help giving many a curse to the ill-luck that was laid out\nfor himself, to be helping the people that were to snatch her away\nfrom her home and from her father.",
        "He began thinking, then, what it was he ought to do to save her, but\nhe could think of nothing. “Oh! if I could only give her some help\nand relief,” said he, “I wouldn’t care whether I were alive or dead;\nbut I see nothing that I can do for her.”",
        "He was looking on when the king’s son came up to her and asked her\nfor a kiss, but she turned her head away from him. Guleesh had\ndouble pity for her then, when he saw the lad taking her by the soft\nwhite hand, and drawing her out to dance. They went round in the\ndance near where Guleesh was, and he could plainly see that there\nwere tears in her eyes.",
        "When the dancing was over, the old king, her father, and her mother\nthe queen, came up and said that this was the right time to marry\nher, that the bishop was ready, and it was time to put the wedding-\nring on her and give her to her husband.",
        "The king took the youth by the hand, and the queen took her\ndaughter, and they went up together to the altar, with the lords and\ngreat people following them.",
        "When they came near the altar, and were no more than about four\nyards from it, the little sheehogue stretched out his foot before\nthe girl, and she fell. Before she was able to rise again he threw\nsomething that was in his hand upon her, said a couple of words, and\nupon the moment the maiden was gone from amongst them. Nobody could\nsee her, for that word made her invisible. The little maneen\nseized her and raised her up behind Guleesh, and the king nor no one\nelse saw them, but out with them through the hall till they came to\nthe door.",
        "Oro! dear Mary! it’s there the pity was, and the trouble, and the\ncrying, and the wonder, and the searching, and the rookawn,\nwhen that lady disappeared from their eyes, and without their seeing\nwhat did it. Out of the door of the palace they went, without being\nstopped or hindered, for nobody saw them, and, “My horse, my bridle,\nand saddle!” says every man of them. “My horse, my bridle, and\nsaddle!” says Guleesh; and on the moment the horse was standing\nready caparisoned before him. “Now, jump up, Guleesh,” said the\nlittle man, “and put the lady behind you, and we will be going; the\nmorning is not far off from us now.”",
        "Guleesh raised her up on the horse’s back, and leaped up himself\nbefore her, and, “Rise, horse,” said he; and his horse, and the\nother horses with him, went in a full race until they came to the\nsea.",
        "“Hie over cap!” said every man of them.",
        "“Hie over cap!” said Guleesh; and on the moment the horse rose under\nhim, and cut a leap in the clouds, and came down in Erin.",
        "They did not stop there, but went of a race to the place where was\nGuleesh’s house and the rath. And when they came as far as that,\nGuleesh turned and caught the young girl in his two arms, and leaped\noff the horse.",
        "“I call and cross you to myself, in the name of God!” said he; and\non the spot, before the word was out of his mouth, the horse fell\ndown, and what was in it but the beam of a plough, of which they had\nmade a horse; and every other horse they had, it was that way they\nmade it. Some of them were riding on an old besom, and some on a\nbroken stick, and more on a bohalawn or a hemlock-stalk.",
        "The good people called out together when they heard what Guleesh\nsaid:",
        "“Oh! Guleesh, you clown, you thief, that no good may happen you, why\ndid you play that trick on us?”",
        "But they had no power at all to carry off the girl, after Guleesh\nhad consecrated her to himself.",
        "“Oh! Guleesh, isn’t that a nice turn you did us, and we so kind to\nyou? What good have we now out of our journey to France. Never mind\nyet, you clown, but you’ll pay us another time for this. Believe us,\nyou’ll repent it.”",
        "“He’ll have no good to get out of the young girl,” said the little\nman that was talking to him in the palace before that, and as he\nsaid the word he moved over to her and struck her a slap on the side\nof the head. “Now,” says he, “she’ll be without talk any more; now,\nGuleesh, what good will she be to you when she’ll be dumb? It’s time\nfor us to go–but you’ll remember us, Guleesh!”",
        "When he said that he stretched out his two hands, and before Guleesh\nwas able to give an answer, he and the rest of them were gone into\nthe rath out of his sight, and he saw them no more.",
        "He turned to the young woman and said to her: “Thanks be to God,\nthey’re gone. Would you not sooner stay with me than with them?” She\ngave him no answer. “There’s trouble and grief on her yet,” said\nGuleesh in his own mind, and he spoke to her again: “I am afraid\nthat you must spend this night in my father’s house, lady, and if\nthere is anything that I can do for you, tell me, and I’ll be your\nservant.”",
        "The beautiful girl remained silent, but there were tears in her\neyes, and her face was white and red after each other.",
        "“Lady,” said Guleesh, “tell me what you would like me to do now. I\nnever belonged at all to that lot of sheehogues who carried you away\nwith them. I am the son of an honest farmer, and I went with them\nwithout knowing it. If I’ll be able to send you back to your father\nI’ll do it, and I pray you make any use of me now that you may\nwish.”",
        "He looked into her face, and he saw the mouth moving as if she was\ngoing to speak, but there came no word from it.",
        "“It cannot be,” said Guleesh, “that you are dumb. Did I not hear you\nspeaking to the king’s son in the palace to-night? Or has that devil\nmade you really dumb, when he struck his nasty hand on your jaw?”",
        "The girl raised her white smooth hand, and laid her finger on her\ntongue, to show him that she had lost her voice and power of speech,\nand the tears ran out of her two eyes like streams, and Guleesh’s\nown eyes were not dry, for as rough as he was on the outside he had\na soft heart, and could not stand the sight of the young girl, and\nshe in that unhappy plight.",
        "He began thinking with himself what he ought to do, and he did not\nlike to bring her home with himself to his father’s house, for he\nknew well that they would not believe him, that he had been in\nFrance and brought back with him the king of France’s daughter, and\nhe was afraid they might make a mock of the young lady or insult\nher.",
        "As he was doubting what he ought to do, and hesitating, he chanced\nto remember the priest. “Glory be to God,” said he, “I know now what\nI’ll do; I’ll bring her to the priest’s house, and he won’t refuse\nme to keep the lady and care for her.” He turned to the lady again\nand told her that he was loth to take her to his father’s house, but\nthat there was an excellent priest very friendly to himself, who\nwould take good care of her, if she wished to remain in his house;\nbut that if there was any other place she would rather go, he said\nhe would bring her to it.",
        "She bent her head, to show him she was obliged, and gave him to\nunderstand that she was ready to follow him any place he was going.\n“We will go to the priest’s house, then,” said he; “he is under an\nobligation to me, and will do anything I ask him.”",
        "They went together accordingly to the priest’s house, and the sun\nwas just rising when they came to the door. Guleesh beat it hard,\nand as early as it was the priest was up, and opened the door\nhimself. He wondered when he saw Guleesh and the girl, for he was\ncertain that it was coming wanting to be married they were.",
        "“Guleesh, Guleesh, isn’t it the nice boy you are that you can’t wait\ntill ten o’clock or till twelve, but that you must be coming to me\nat this hour, looking for marriage, you and your sweetheart? You\nought to know that I can’t marry you at such a time, or, at all\nevents, can’t marry you lawfully. But ubbubboo!” said he, suddenly,\nas he looked again at the young girl, “in the name of God, who have\nyou here? Who is she, or how did you get her?”",
        "“Father,” said Guleesh, “you can marry me, or anybody else, if you\nwish; but it’s not looking for marriage I came to you now, but to\nask you, if you please, to give a lodging in your house to this\nyoung lady.”",
        "The priest looked at him as though he had ten heads on him; but\nwithout putting any other question to him, he desired him to come\nin, himself and the maiden, and when they came in, he shut the door,\nbrought them into the parlour, and put them sitting.",
        "“Now, Guleesh,” said he, “tell me truly who is this young lady, and\nwhether you’re out of your senses really, or are only making a joke\nof me.”",
        "“I’m not telling a word of lie, nor making a joke of you,” said\nGuleesh; “but it was from the palace of the king of France I carried\noff this lady, and she is the daughter of the king of France.”",
        "He began his story then, and told the whole to the priest, and the\npriest was so much surprised that he could not help calling out at\ntimes, or clapping his hands together.",
        "When Guleesh said from what he saw he thought the girl was not\nsatisfied with the marriage that was going to take place in the\npalace before he and the sheehogues broke it up, there came a red\nblush into the girl’s cheek, and he was more certain than ever that\nshe had sooner be as she was–badly as she was–than be the married\nwife of the man she hated. When Guleesh said that he would be very\nthankful to the priest if he would keep her in his own house, the\nkind man said he would do that as long as Guleesh pleased, but that\nhe did not know what they ought to do with her, because they had no\nmeans of sending her back to her father again.",
        "Guleesh answered that he was uneasy about the same thing, and that\nhe saw nothing to do but to keep quiet until they should find some\nopportunity of doing something better. They made it up then between\nthemselves that the priest should let on that it was his brother’s\ndaughter he had, who was come on a visit to him from another county,\nand that he should tell everybody that she was dumb, and do his best\nto keep every one away from her. They told the young girl what it\nwas they intended to do, and she showed by her eyes that she was\nobliged to them.",
        "Guleesh went home then, and when his people asked him where he had\nbeen, he said that he had been asleep at the foot of the ditch, and\nhad passed the night there.",
        "There was great wonderment on the priest’s neighbours at the girl\nwho came so suddenly to his house without any one knowing where she\nwas from, or what business she had there. Some of the people said\nthat everything was not as it ought to be, and others, that Guleesh\nwas not like the same man that was in it before, and that it was a\ngreat story, how he was drawing every day to the priest’s house, and\nthat the priest had a wish and a respect for him, a thing they could\nnot clear up at all.",
        "That was true for them, indeed, for it was seldom the day went by\nbut Guleesh would go to the priest’s house, and have a talk with\nhim, and as often as he would come he used to hope to find the young\nlady well again, and with leave to speak; but, alas! she remained\ndumb and silent, without relief or cure. Since she had no other\nmeans of talking, she carried on a sort of conversation between\nherself and himself, by moving her hand and fingers, winking her\neyes, opening and shutting her mouth, laughing or smiling, and a\nthousand other signs, so that it was not long until they understood\neach other very well. Guleesh was always thinking how he should send\nher back to her father; but there was no one to go with her, and he\nhimself did not know what road to go, for he had never been out of\nhis own country before the night he brought her away with him. Nor\nhad the priest any better knowledge than he; but when Guleesh asked\nhim, he wrote three or four letters to the king of France, and gave\nthem to buyers and sellers of wares, who used to be going from place\nto place across the sea; but they all went astray, and never a one\ncame to the king’s hand.",
        "This was the way they were for many months, and Guleesh was falling\ndeeper and deeper in love with her every day, and it was plain to\nhimself and the priest that she liked him. The boy feared greatly at\nlast, lest the king should really hear where his daughter was, and\ntake her back from himself, and he besought the priest to write no\nmore, but to leave the matter to God.",
        "So they passed the time for a year, until there came a day when\nGuleesh was lying by himself, on the grass, on the last day of the\nlast month in autumn, and he was thinking over again in his own mind\nof everything that happened to him from the day that he went with\nthe sheehogues across the sea. He remembered then, suddenly, that it\nwas one November night that he was standing at the gable of the\nhouse, when the whirlwind came, and the sheehogues in it, and he\nsaid to himself: “We have November night again to-day, and I’ll\nstand in the same place I was last year, until I see if the good\npeople come again. Perhaps I might see or hear something that would\nbe useful to me, and might bring back her talk again to Mary\"–that\nwas the name himself and the priest called the king’s daughter, for\nneither of them knew her right name. He told his intention to the\npriest, and the priest gave him his blessing.",
        "Guleesh accordingly went to the old rath when the night was\ndarkening, and he stood with his bent elbow leaning on a grey old\nflag, waiting till the middle of the night should come. The moon\nrose slowly; and it was like a knob of fire behind him; and there\nwas a white fog which was raised up over the fields of grass and all\ndamp places, through the coolness of the night after a great heat in\nthe day. The night was calm as is a lake when there is not a breath\nof wind to move a wave on it, and there was no sound to be heard but\nthe cronawn of the insects that would go by from time to\ntime, or the hoarse sudden scream of the wild-geese, as they passed\nfrom lake to lake, half a mile up in the air over his head; or the\nsharp whistle of the golden and green plover, rising and lying,\nlying and rising, as they do on a calm night. There were a thousand\nthousand bright stars shining over his head, and there was a little\nfrost out, which left the grass under his foot white and crisp.",
        "He stood there for an hour, for two hours, for three hours, and the\nfrost increased greatly, so that he heard the breaking of the\ntraneens under his foot as often as he moved. He was thinking,\nin his own mind, at last, that the sheehogues would not come that\nnight, and that it was as good for him to return back again, when\nhe heard a sound far away from him, coming towards him, and he\nrecognised what it was at the first moment. The sound increased,\nand at first it was like the beating of waves on a stony shore, and\nthen it was like the falling of a great waterfall, and at last it was like\na loud storm in the tops of the trees, and then the whirlwind burst\ninto the rath of one rout, and the sheehogues were in it.",
        "It all went by him so suddenly that he lost his breath with it, but\nhe came to himself on the spot, and put an ear on himself, listening\nto what they would say.",
        "Scarcely had they gathered into the rath till they all began\nshouting, and screaming, and talking amongst themselves; and then\neach one of them cried out: “My horse, and bridle, and saddle! My\nhorse, and bridle, and saddle!” and Guleesh took courage, and called\nout as loudly as any of them: “My horse, and bridle, and saddle! My\nhorse, and bridle, and saddle!” But before the word was well out of\nhis mouth, another man cried out: “Ora! Guleesh, my boy, are you\nhere with us again? How are you getting on with your woman? There’s\nno use in your calling for your horse to-night. I’ll go bail you\nwon’t play such a trick on us again. It was a good trick you played\non us last year?”",
        "“It was,” said another man; “he won’t do it again.”",
        "“Isn’t he a prime lad, the same lad! to take a woman with him that\nnever said as much to him as, ’How do you do?’ since this time last\nyear!” says the third man.",
        "“Perhaps be likes to be looking at her,” said another voice.",
        "“And if the omadawn only knew that there’s an herb growing up\nby his own door, and if he were to boil it and give it to her, she’d\nbe well,” said another voice.",
        "“That’s true for you.”",
        "“He is an omadawn.”",
        "“Don’t bother your head with him; we’ll be going.”",
        "“We’ll leave the bodach as he is.”",
        "And with that they rose up into the air, and out with them with one\nroolya-boolya the way they came; and they left poor Guleesh\nstanding where they found him, and the two eyes going out of his\nhead, looking after them and wondering.",
        "He did not stand long till he returned back, and he thinking in his\nown mind on all he saw and heard, and wondering whether there was\nreally an herb at his own door that would bring back the talk to the\nking’s daughter. “It can’t be,” says he to himself, “that they would\ntell it to me, if there was any virtue in it; but perhaps the\nsheehogue didn’t observe himself when he let the word slip out of\nhis mouth. I’ll search well as soon as the sun rises, whether\nthere’s any plant growing beside the house except thistles and\ndockings.”",
        "He went home, and as tired as he was he did not sleep a wink until\nthe sun rose on the morrow. He got up then, and it was the first\nthing he did to go out and search well through the grass round about\nthe house, trying could he get any herb that he did not recognise.\nAnd, indeed, he was not long searching till he observed a large\nstrange herb that was growing up just by the gable of the house.",
        "He went over to it, and observed it closely, and saw that there were\nseven little branches coming out of the stalk, and seven leaves\ngrowing on every brancheen of them; and that there was a\nwhite sap in the leaves. “It’s very wonderful,” said he to himself,\n“that I never noticed this herb before. If there’s any virtue in an\nherb at all, it ought to be in such a strange one as this.”",
        "He drew out his knife, cut the plant, and carried it into his own\nhouse; stripped the leaves off it and cut up the stalk; and there\ncame a thick, white juice out of it, as there comes out of the sow-\nthistle when it is bruised, except that the juice was more like oil.",
        "He put it in a little pot and a little water in it, and laid it on\nthe fire until the water was boiling, and then he took a cup, filled\nit half up with the juice, and put it to his own mouth. It came into\nhis head then that perhaps it was poison that was in it, and that\nthe good people were only tempting him that he might kill himself\nwith that trick, or put the girl to death without meaning it. He put\ndown the cup again, raised a couple of drops on the top of his\nfinger, and put it to his mouth. It was not bitter, and, indeed, had\na sweet, agreeable taste. He grew bolder then, and drank the full of\na thimble of it, and then as much again, and he never stopped till\nhe had half the cup drunk. He fell asleep after that, and did not\nwake till it was night, and there was great hunger and great thirst\non him.",
        "He had to wait, then, till the day rose; but he determined, as soon\nas he should wake in the morning, that he would go to the king’s\ndaughter and give her a drink of the juice of the herb.",
        "As soon as he got up in the morning, he went over to the priest’s\nhouse with the drink in his hand, and he never felt himself so bold\nand valiant, and spirited and light, as he was that day, and he was\nquite certain that it was the drink he drank which made him so\nhearty.",
        "When he came to the house, he found the priest and the young lady\nwithin, and they were wondering greatly why he had not visited them\nfor two days.",
        "He told them all his news, and said that he was certain that there\nwas great power in that herb, and that it would do the lady no hurt,\nfor he tried it himself and got good from it, and then he made her\ntaste it, for he vowed and swore that there was no harm in it.",
        "Guleesh handed her the cup, and she drank half of it, and then fell\nback on her bed and a heavy sleep came on her, and she never woke\nout of that sleep till the day on the morrow.",
        "Guleesh and the priest sat up the entire night with her, waiting\ntill she should awake, and they between hope and unhope, between\nexpectation of saving her and fear of hurting her.",
        "She awoke at last when the sun had gone half its way through the\nheavens. She rubbed her eyes and looked like a person who did not\nknow where she was. She was like one astonished when she saw Guleesh\nand the priest in the same room with her, and she sat up doing her\nbest to collect her thoughts.",
        "The two men were in great anxiety waiting to see would she speak, or\nwould she not speak, and when they remained silent for a couple of\nminutes, the priest said to her: “Did you sleep well, Mary?”",
        "And she answered him: “I slept, thank you.”",
        "No sooner did Guleesh hear her talking than he put a shout of joy\nout of him, and ran over to her and fell on his two knees, and said:\n“A thousand thanks to God, who has given you back the talk; lady of\nmy heart, speak again to me.”",
        "The lady answered him that she understood it was he who boiled that\ndrink for her, and gave it to her; that she was obliged to him from\nher heart for all the kindness he showed her since the day she first\ncame to Ireland, and that he might be certain that she never would\nforget it.",
        "Guleesh was ready to die with satisfaction and delight. Then they\nbrought her food, and she ate with a good appetite, and was merry\nand joyous, and never left off talking with the priest while she was\neating.",
        "After that Guleesh went home to his house, and stretched himself on\nthe bed and fell asleep again, for the force of the herb was not all\nspent, and he passed another day and a night sleeping. When he woke\nup he went back to the priest’s house, and found that the young lady\nwas in the same state, and that she was asleep almost since the time\nthat he left the house.",
        "He went into her chamber with the priest, and they remained watching\nbeside her till she awoke the second time, and she had her talk as\nwell as ever, and Guleesh was greatly rejoiced. The priest put food\non the table again, and they ate together, and Guleesh used after\nthat to come to the house from day to day, and the friendship that\nwas between him and the king’s daughter increased, because she had\nno one to speak to except Guleesh and the priest, and she liked\nGuleesh best.",
        "So they married one another, and that was the fine wedding they had,\nand if I were to be there then, I would not be here now; but I heard\nit from a birdeen that there was neither cark nor care, sickness nor\nsorrow, mishap nor misfortune on them till the hour of their death,\nand may the same be with me, and with us all!",
