        "Tell we now no further / how they here did fare.\nKnights more high in spirit / saw ye journey ne’er\nIn so stately fashion / to the land of e’er a king.\nOf arms and rich attire / lacked they never anything.",
        "1507",
        "At Rhine the lordly monarch / equipped his warriors well,\nA thousand knights and sixty, / as I did hear tell,\nAnd eke nine thousand squires / toward the festivity.\nWhom they did leave behind them / anon must mourn full grievously.",
        "1508",
        "As at Worms across the courtyard / equipment full they bore\nSpake there of Speyer / a bishop old and hoar\nUnto Lady Ute: / “Our friends have mind to fare\nUnto the festivity; / may God their honor have in care.”",
        "1509",
        "Then spake unto her children / Ute the noble dame:\n“At home ye here should tarry, / ye knights full high in fame.\nMe dreamt but yester even / a case of direst need,\nHow that in this country / all the feathered fowl were dead.”",
        "1510",
        "“Who recketh aught of dreamings,\" / Hagen then replied,\n“Distraught is sure his counsel / when trouble doth betide,\nOr he would of his honor / have a perfect care.\nI counsel that my master / straight to take his leave prepare.",
        "1511",
        "“Gladly shall we journey / into Etzel’s land;\nThere at their master’s service / may good knights ready stand,\nFor that we there shall witness / Kriemhild’s festivity.\"\nThat Hagen gave such counsel, / rue anon full sore did he.",
        "1512",
        "Yet in sooth far other / than this had been his word,\nHad not with bitter mocking / Gernot his anger stirred.\nHe spake to him of Siegfried / whom Kriemhild loved so,\nAnd said: “Therefore the journey / would Hagen willingly forego.”",
        "1513",
        "Then spake of Tronje Hagen: / “Through fear I nothing do.\nWhenever will ye, Masters, / set straight your hand thereto,\nWith you I’ll gladly journey / unto Etzel’s land.\"\nMany a shield and helmet / there hewed anon his mighty hand.",
        "1514",
        "The ships stood ready waiting, / whereunto ample store\nOf clothing for the journey / men full many bore,\nNor had they time for resting / till shades of even fell.\nAnon in mood full joyous / bade they friends at home farewell.",
        "1515",
        "Tents full large and many / arose upon the green,\nYonder side Rhine river. / But yet the winsome queen\nCaressed the doughty monarch / that night, and still did pray\nThat far from Etzel’s country / among his kinsmen might he stay.",
        "1516",
        "When sound of flute and trumpet / arose at break of day,\nA signal for their parting, / full soon they took their way.\nEach lover to his bosom / did friend more fondly press:\nKing Etzel’s wife full many / did part anon in dire distress.",
        "1517",
        "The sons of stately Ute, / a good knight had they,\nA brave man and a faithful. / When they would thence away,\nApart unto the monarch / did he his mind reveal,\nAnd spake: “That ye will journey, / may I naught but sorrow feel.”",
        "1518",
        "Hight the same was Rumold, / a man of doughty hand.\nHe spake: “To whom now leave ye / people here and land?\nO that never any / might alter your intent!\nSmall good, methinks, may follow / message e’er by Kriemhild sent.”",
        "1519",
        "“The land to thee entrusted / and eke my child shall be,\nAnd tender care of ladies, / –so hast command from me.\nWhene’er thou seest weeping, / do there thy comfort give.\nYea, trust we free from sorrow / at hand of Etzel’s wife to live.”",
        "1520",
        "For knight and royal master / the chargers ready were,\nAs with fond embracing / parted many there,\nWho long in joy together / a merry life had led.\nBy winsome dame full many / therefor must bitter tear be shed.",
        "1521",
        "As did those doughty warriors / into the saddle spring,\nMight full many a lady / be seen there sorrowing;\nFor told them well their spirit / that thus so long to part\nDid bode a dire peril, / the which must ever cloud the heart.",
        "1522",
        "As mounted stood the valiant / thanes of Burgundy,\nMight ye a mickle stirring / in that country see,\nBoth men and women weeping / on either riverside.\nYet pricked they gaily forward, / let what might their folk betide.",
        "1523",
        "The Nibelungen warriors / in hauberks bright arrayed\nWent with them, a thousand, / while at home behind them stayed\nFull many a winsome lady, / whom saw they nevermore.\nThe wounds of doughty Siegfried / still grieved the Lady Kriemhild sore.",
        "1524",
        "Their journey they directed / onward to the Main,\nUp through East Frankish country, / the men of Gunther’s train\nThither led by Hagen, / who well that country knew;\nMarshal to them was Dankwart, / a knight of Burgundy full true.",
        "1525",
        "On from East Frankish country / to Schwanefeld they went,\nA train of valiant warriors / of high accomplishment,\nThe monarchs and their kinsmen, / all knights full worthy fame.\nUpon the twelfth morning / the king unto the Danube came.",
        "1526",
        "The knight of Tronje, Hagen, / the very van did lead,\nEver to the Nibelungen / a surest help in need.\nFirst the thane full valiant / down leapt upon the ground,\nAnd straightway then his charger / fast unto a tree he bound.",
        "1527",
        "Flooded were the waters / and ne’er a boat was near,\nWhereat began the Nibelungen / all in dread to fear\nThey ne’er might cross the river, / so mighty was the flood.\nDismounted on the shore, / full many a stately knight then stood.",
        "1528",
        "“Ill may it,” spake then Hagen, / “fare here with thee,\nLord of Rhine river. / Now thyself mayst see\nHow flooded are the waters, / and swift the current flows.\nI ween, before the morrow / here many a goodly knight we lose.”",
        "1529",
        "“How wilt reproach me, Hagen?\" / the lofty monarch spake.\nI pray thee yet all comfort / not from our hearts to take.\nThe ford shalt thou discover / whereby we may pass o’er,\nHorse and equipment bringing / safely unto yonder shore.”",
        "1530",
        "“In sooth, not I,” quoth Hagen, / “am yet so weary grown\nOf life, that in these waters / wide I long to drown.\nEre that, shall warriors sicken / in Etzel’s far country\nBeneath my own arm stricken: / –’tis my intent full certainly.",
        "1531",
        "“Here tarry by the water, / ye gallant knights and good,\nThe while I seek the boatmen / myself along the flood,\nWho will bring us over / into Gelfrat’s land.\"\nWith that the doughty Hagen / took his trusty shield in hand.",
        "1532",
        "He cap-a-pie was armed, / as thus he strode away,\nUpon his head a helmet / that gleamed with brilliant ray,\nAnd o’er his warlike harness / a sword full broad there hung,\nThat on both its edges / did fiercely cut, in battle swung.",
        "1533",
        "He sought to find the boatmen / if any might be near,\nWhen sound of falling waters / full soon upon his ear.\nBeside a rippling fountain, / where ran the waters cool,\nA group of wise mermaidens / did bathe themselves within the pool.",
        "1534",
        "Ware of them soon was Hagen / and stole in secret near,\nBut fast away they hurried / when they the sound did hear.\nThat they at all escaped him, / filled they were with glee.\nThe knight did take their clothing, / yet wrought none other injury.",
        "1535",
        "Then spake the one mermaiden, / Hadburg that hight:\n“Hagen, knight full noble, / tell will we thee aright,\nAn wilt thou, valiant warrior, / our garments but give o’er,\nWhat fortune may this journey / to Hunland have for thee in store.”",
        "1536",
        "They hovered there before him / like birds above the flood,\nWherefore did think the warrior / that tell strange things they could,\nAnd all the more believed he / what they did feign to say,\nAs to his eager question / in ready manner answered they.",
        "1537",
        "Spake one: “Well may ye journey / to Etzel’s country.\nThereto my troth I give thee / in full security\nThat ne’er in any kingdom / might high guests receive\nSuch honors as there wait you, / –this may ye in sooth believe.”",
        "1538",
        "To hear such speech was Hagen / in sooth right glad of heart;\nHe gave to them their garments, / and straightway would depart.\nBut when in strange attire / they once more were dight,\nTold they of the journey / into Etzel’s land aright.",
        "1539",
        "Spake then the other mermaid, / Siegelind that hight:\n“I warn thee, son of Aldrian, / Hagen valiant knight,\n’Twas but to gain her clothing / my cousin falsely said,\nFor, comest thou to Hunland, / sorely shalt thou be betrayed.",
        "1540",
        "“Yea, that thou turnest backward / is fitter far, I ween;\nFor but your death to compass / have all ye warriors keen\nReceived now the bidding / unto Etzel’s land.\nWhose doth thither journey, / death leadeth surely by the hand.”",
        "1541",
        "Thereto gave answer Hagen: / “False speech hath here no gain.\nHow might it ever happen / that we all were slain\nAfar in Etzel’s country / through hate of any man?\"\nTo tell the tale more fully / unto him she then began.",
        "1542",
        "Spake again the other: / “The thing must surely be,\nThat of you never any / his home again shall see,\nSave only the king’s chaplain; / well do we understand\nThat he unscathed returneth / unto royal Gunther’s land.”",
        "1543",
        "Then spake the valiant Hagen / again in angry way:\n“Unto my royal masters / ’twere little joy to say\nThat we our lives must forfeit / all in Hunland.\nNow show us, wisest woman, / how pass we safe to yonder strand.”",
        "1544",
        "She spake: “Since from thy purposed / journey thou wilt not turn,\nWhere upward by the water / a cabin stands, there learn\nWithin doth dwell a boatman, / nor other find thou mayst.\"\nNo more did Hagen question, / but strode away from there in haste.",
        "1545",
        "As went he angry-minded / one from afar did say:\n“Now tarry still, Sir Hagen; / why so dost haste away?\nGive ear yet while we tell thee / how thou reachest yonder strand.\nMaster here is Else, / who doth rule this borderland.",
        "1546",
        "“Hight is his brother Gelfrat, / and is a thane full rare,\nLord o’er Bavarian country. / Full ill with you ’twill fare,\nWill ye pass his border. / Watchful must ye be,\nAnd eke with the ferryman / ’twere well to walk right modestly.",
        "1547",
        "“He is so angry-minded / that sure thy bane ’twill be,\nWilt thou not show the warrior / all civility.\nWilt thou that he transport thee, / give all the boatman’s due.\nHe guardeth well the border / and unto Gelfrat is full true.",
        "1548",
        "“If he be slow to answer, / then call across the flood\nThat thy name is Amelrich. / That was a knight full good,\nWho for a feud did sometime / go forth from out this land.\nThe ferryman will answer, / when he the name doth understand.",
        "1549",
        "Hagen high of spirit / before those women bent,\nNor aught did say, but silent / upon his way he went.\nAlong the shore he wandered / till higher by the tide\nOn yonder side the river / a cabin standing he espied.",
        "1550",
        "He straight began a calling / across the flood amain.\n“Now fetch me over, boatman,\" / cried the doughty thane.\n“A golden armband ruddy / I’ll give to thee for meed.\nKnow that to make this crossing / I in sooth have very need.”",
        "1551",
        "Not fitting ’twas high ferryman / his service thus should give,\nAnd recompense from any / seldom might he receive;\nEke were they that served him / full haughty men of mood.\nStill alone stood Hagen / on the hither side the flood.",
        "1552",
        "Then cried he with such power / the wave gave back the sound,\nFor in strength far-reaching / did the knight abound:\n“Fetch me now, for Amelrich, / Else’s man, am I,\nThat for feud outbroken / erstwhile from this land did fly.”",
        "1553",
        "Full high upon his sword-point / an armband did he hold,\nFair and shining was it / made of ruddy gold,\nThe which he offered to him / for fare to Gelfrat’s land.\nThe ferryman high-hearted / himself did take the oar in hand.",
        "1554",
        "To do with that same boatman / was ne’er a pleasant thing;\nThe yearning after lucre / yet evil end doth bring.\nHere where thought he Hagen’s / gold so red to gain,\nMust he by the doughty / warrior’s fierce sword be slain.",
        "1555",
        "With might across the river / his oar the boatman plied,\nBut he who there was named / might nowhere be espied.\nHis rage was all unbounded / when he did Hagen find,\nAnd loud his voice resounded / as thus he spake his angry mind:",
        "1556",
        "“Thou mayst forsooth be called / Amelrich by name:\nWhom I here did look for, / no whit art thou the same.\nBy father and by mother / brother he was to me.\nSince me thou thus hast cozened, / so yet this side the river be.”",
        "1557",
        "“Nay, by highest Heaven,\" / Hagen did declare.\n“Here am I a stranger / that have good knights in care.\nNow take in friendly manner / here my offered pay,\nAnd guide me o’er the ferry; / my favor hast thou thus alway.”",
        "1558",
        "Whereat replied the boatman: / “The thing may never be.\nThere are that to my masters / do bear hostility;\nWherefore I never stranger / do lead into this land.\nAs now thy life thou prizest, / step straightway out upon the strand.”",
        "1559",
        "“Deny me not,” quoth Hagen, / “for sad in sooth my mood.\nTake now for remembrance / this my gold so good,\nAnd carry men a thousand / and horses to yonder shore.\"\nQuoth in rage the boatman: / “Such thing will happen nevermore.”",
        "1560",
        "Aloft he raised an oar / that mickle was and strong,\nAnd dealt such blow on Hagen, / (but rued he that ere long,)\nThat in the boat did stumble / that warrior to his knee.\nIn sooth so savage boatman / ne’er did the knight of Tronje see.",
        "1561",
        "With thought the stranger’s anger / the more to rouse anew,\nHe swung a mighty boat-pole / that it in pieces flew\nUpon the crown of Hagen;– / he was a man of might.\nThereby did Else’s boatman / come anon to sorry plight.",
        "1562",
        "Full sore enraged was Hagen, / as quick his hand he laid\nUpon his sword where hanging / he found the trusty blade.\nHis head he struck from off him / and flung into the tide.\nKnown was soon the story / to the knights of Burgundy beside.",
        "1563",
        "While the time was passing / that he the boatman slew,\nThe waters bore him downward, / whereat he anxious grew.\nEre he the boat had righted / began his strength to wane,\nSo mightily was pulling / royal Gunther’s doughty thane.",
        "1564",
        "Soon he yet had turned it, / so rapid was his stroke,\nUntil the mighty oar / beneath his vigor broke.\nAs strove he his companions / upon the bank to gain,\nNo second oar he found him. / Yet soon the same made fast again.",
        "1565",
        "With quickly snatched shield-strap, / a fine and narrow band.\nDownward where stood a forest / he sought again the land,\nAnd there his master found he / standing upon the shore.\nIn haste came forth to meet him / many a stately warrior more.",
        "1566",
        "The gallant knight they greeted / with right hearty mood.\nWhen in the boat perceived they / reeking still the blood\nThat from the wound had issued / where Hagen’s sword did swing,\nScarce could his companions / bring to an end their questioning.",
        "1567",
        "When that royal Gunther / the streaming blood did see\nWithin the boat there running, / straightway then spake he:\n“Where is now the ferryman, / tell me, Hagen, pray?\nBy thy mighty prowess / his life, I ween, is ta’en away.”",
        "1568",
        "Thereto replied he falsely: / “When the boat I found\nWhere slopeth a wild meadow, / I the same unbound.\nHereabout no ferryman / I to-day have seen,\nNor ever cause of sorrow / unto any have I been.”",
        "1569",
        "The good knight then of Burgundy, / the gallant Gernot, spake:\n“Dear friends full many, fear I, / the flood this day will take,\nSince we of the boatmen / none ready here may find\nTo guide us o’er the current. / ’Tis mickle sorrow to my mind.”",
        "1570",
        "Full loudly cried then Hagen: / “Lay down upon the grass,\nYe squires, the horse equipments. / I ween a time there was,\nMyself was best of boatmen / that dwelt the Rhine beside.\nTo Gelfrat’s country trow I / to bring you safely o’er the tide.”",
        "1571",
        "That they might come the sooner / across the running flood,\nDrove they in the horses. / Their swimming, it was good,\nFor of them never any / beneath the waves did sink,\nThough many farther downward / must struggle sore to gain the brink.",
        "1572",
        "Their treasure and apparel / unto the boat they bore,\nSince by no means the journey / thought they to give o’er.\nHagen was director, / and safely reached the strand\nWith many a stalwart warrior / bound unto the unknown land.",
        "1573",
        "Gallant knights a thousand / first he ferried o’er,\nWhereafter came his own men. / Of others still were more,\nFor squires full nine thousand / he led unto that land.\nThat day no whit was idle / that valiant knight of Tronje’s hand.",
        "1574",
        "When he them all in safety / o’er the flood had brought,\nOf that strange story / the valiant warrior thought,\nWhich erstwhile had told him / those women of the sea.\nLost thereby the chaplain’s / life well-nigh was doomed to be.",
        "1575",
        "Beside his priestly baggage / he saw the chaplain stand,\nUpon the holy vestments / resting with his hand.\nNo whit was that his safety; / when Hagen him did see,\nMust the priest full wretched / suffer sorest injury.",
        "1576",
        "From out the boat he flung him / ere might the thing be told,\nWhereat they cried together: / “Hold, O Master, hold!\"\nSoon had the youthful Giselher / to rage thereat begun,\nAnd mickle was his sorrow / that Hagen yet the thing had done.",
        "1577",
        "Then outspake Sir Gernot, / knight of Burgundy:\n“What boots it thee, Sir Hagen, / that thus the chaplain die?\nDared any else to do it, / thy wrath ’twould sorely stir.\nWherein the priest’s offending, / thus thy malice to incur?”",
        "1578",
        "To swim the chaplain struggled. / He thought him yet to free,\nIf any but would help him. / Yet such might never be,\nFor that the doughty Hagen / full wrathful was of mood,\nHe sunk him to the bottom, / whereat aghast each warrior stood.",
        "1579",
        "When that no help forthcoming / the wretched priest might see,\nHe sought the hither shore, / and fared full grievously.\nThough failed his strength in swimming, / yet helped him God’s own hand,\nThat he came securely / back again unto the land.",
        "1580",
        "Safe yonder stood the chaplain / and shook his dripping dress.\nThereby perceived Hagen / how true was none the less\nThe story that did tell him / the strange women of the sea.\nThought he: “Of these good warriors / soon the days must ended be.”",
        "1581",
        "When that the boat was emptied, / and complete their store\nAll the monarch’s followers / had borne upon the shore,\nHagen smote it to pieces / and cast it on the flood,\nWhereat in mickle wonder / the valiant knights around him stood.",
        "1582",
        "“Wherefore dost this, brother,\" / then Sir Dankwart spake;\n“How shall we cross the river / when again we make\nOur journey back from Hunland, / riding to the Rhine?\"\nBehold how Hagen bade him / all such purpose to resign.",
        "1583",
        "Quoth the knight of Tronje: / “This thing is done by me,\nThat if e’er coward rideth / in all our company,\nWho for lack of courage / from us away would fly,\nHe beneath these billows / yet a shameful death must die.”",
        "1584",
        "One there journeyed with them / from the land of Burgundy,\nThat was a knight of valor, / Volker by name was he.\nHe spake in cunning manner / whate’er might fill his mind,\nAnd aught was done by Hagen / did the Fiddler fitting find.",
        "1585",
        "Ready stood their chargers, / the carriers laden well;\nAt passage of the river / was there naught to tell\nOf scathe to any happened, / save but the king’s chaplain.\nAfoot must he now journey / back unto the Rhine again.",
