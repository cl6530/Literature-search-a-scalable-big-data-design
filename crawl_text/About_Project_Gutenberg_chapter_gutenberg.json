        "The books featured on this site are based on the original Project Gutenberg e-texts.\nProject Gutenberg was started back in 1971 by Michael Hart at the\nUniversity of Illinois, who was given an operator's account with free time to spent\nXerox Sigma V mainframe. Michael wanted to do something worthwhile, and got\ninterested in storage, retrieval and searching of what was available on paper in libraries.\n",
        "Michael's idea was this; once a computer is stored digitally, then everyone around the world\ncan make an easy copy of it. So the electronic texts (e-texts, or eTexts) were intended to\nbe stored in the easiest possible way; \"Plain Vanilla ASCII\" (ASCII\nfor \"American Standard Code for Information Interchange\"). Furthermore, the goal\nis to produce a text 99.9% accurate – there is no need to make it perfect. The etext\nshould be the foundation for others to build upon.",
        "My intent is to take the etexts available and convert them to HTML (to be more exact, XHTML1.0 Strict – served as content-type \"text/html\" for now).\nI believe this to be the format of the future, as it's simple, yet includes basic structures like \"heading\",\n\"emphasis\" and so on. XHTML Strict is also device-independet; I deliver a stylesheet for screen and print,\nbut it can easily be override or ignored, leaving only the basic structure. My goal is to create the simplest\nversion with an easily readable layout (e.g. you won't find any background-images imitating real-world paper,\nlike on many other ebooks websites). \"Plain Vanilla HTML\", if you want, because I find the \"Plain Vanilla ASCII\"\nsomewhat hard to read online. My second goal is to not only make the texts available online, but to also\nensure they are stored in a way so to be easily found by search-engines. It's rare that one would want to\ndo a complete reading session on todays computers (this might change in the future), but it's very possible\nthat someone is looking for the origin of a phrase, or detailed information on a given topic, and doesn't find\nthe right information online. That's why Authorama includes features like search-term highlighting upon\narriving on a sub-chapter of a book from a search-engine.\n",
