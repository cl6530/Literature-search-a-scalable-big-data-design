        "  Our Baron excels Baron Tott beyond all comparison, yet fails in\n  part of his attempt–Gets into disgrace with the Grand Seignior,\n  who orders his head to be cut off–Escapes, and gets on board a\n  vessel, in which he is carried to Venice–Baron Tott’s origin,\n  with some account of that great man’s parents–Pope Ganganelli’s\n  amour–His Holiness fond of shell-fish.",
        "Baron de Tott, in his Memoirs, makes as great a parade of a single act\nas many travellers whose whole lives have been spent in seeing the\ndifferent parts of the globe; for my part, if I had been blown from\nEurope to Asia from the mouth of a cannon, I should have boasted less\nof it afterwards than he has done of only firing off a Turkish piece\nof ordnance. What he says of this wonderful gun, as near as my memory\nwill serve me, is this:–\"The Turks had placed below the castle, and\nnear the city, on the banks of Simois, a celebrated river, an enormous\npiece of ordnance cast in brass, which would carry a marble ball of\neleven hundred pounds weight. I was inclined,” says Tott, “to fire it,\nbut I was willing first to judge of its effect; the crowd about me\ntrembled at this proposal, as they asserted it would overthrow not\nonly the castle, but the city also; at length their fears in part\nsubsided, and I was permitted to discharge it. It required not less\nthan three hundred and thirty pounds’ weight of powder, and the ball\nweighed, as before mentioned, eleven hundredweight. When the engineer\nbrought the priming, the crowds who were about me retreated back as\nfast as they could; nay, it was with the utmost difficulty I persuaded\nthe Pacha, who came on purpose, there was no danger: even the engineer\nwho was to discharge it by my direction was considerably alarmed. I\ntook my stand on some stone-work behind the cannon, gave the signal,\nand felt a shock like that of earthquake! At the distance of three\nhundred fathom the ball burst into three pieces; the fragments crossed\nthe strait, rebounded on the opposite mountain, and left the surface\nof the water all in a foam through the whole breadth of the channel.”",
        "This, gentlemen, is, as near as I can recollect, Baron Tott’s account\nof the largest cannon in the known world. Now, when I was there not\nlong since, the anecdote of Tott’s firing this tremendous piece was\nmentioned as a proof of that gentleman’s extraordinary courage.",
        "I was determined not to be outdone by a Frenchman, therefore took this\nvery piece upon my shoulder, and, after balancing it properly, jumped\ninto the sea with it, and swam to the opposite shore, from whence I\nunfortunately attempted to throw it back into its former place. I say\nunfortunately, for it slipped a little in my hand just as I was about\nto discharge it, and in consequence of that it fell into the middle of\nthe channel, where it now lies, without a prospect of ever recovering\nit: and notwithstanding the high favour I was in with the Grand\nSeignior, as before mentioned, this cruel Turk, as soon as he heard of\nthe loss of his famous piece of ordnance, issued an order to cut off\nmy head. I was immediately informed of it by one of the Sultanas, with\nwhom I was become a great favourite, and she secreted me in her\napartment while the officer charged with my execution was, with his\nassistants, in search of me.",
        "That very night I made my escape on board a vessel bound to Venice,\nwhich was then weighing anchor to proceed on her voyage.",
        "The last story, gentlemen, I am not fond of mentioning, as I\nmiscarried in the attempt, and was very near losing my life into the\nbargain: however, as it contains no impeachment of my honour, I would\nnot withhold it from you.",
        "Now, gentlemen, you all know me, and can have no doubt of my veracity.\nI will entertain you with the origin of this same swaggering, bouncing\nTott.",
        "His reputed father was a native of Berne, in Switzerland; his\nprofession was that of a surveyor of the streets, lanes, and alleys,\nvulgarly called a scavenger. His mother was a native of the mountains\nof Savoy, and had a most beautiful large wen on her neck, common to\nboth sexes in that part of the world; she left her parents when young,\nand sought her fortune in the same city which gave his father birth;\nshe maintained herself while single by acts of kindness to our sex,\nfor she never was known to refuse them any favour they asked, provided\nthey did but pay her some compliment beforehand. This lovely couple\nmet by accident in the street, in consequence of their being both\nintoxicated, for by reeling to one centre they threw each other down;\nthis created mutual abuse, in which they were complete adepts; they\nwere both carried to the watch-house, and afterwards to the house of\ncorrection; they soon saw the folly of quarrelling, made it up, became\nfond of each other, and married; but madam returning to her old\ntricks, his father, who had high notions of honour, soon separated\nhimself from her; she then joined a family who strolled about with a\npuppet-show. In time she arrived at Rome, where she kept an oyster-\nstand. You have all heard, no doubt of Pope Ganganelli, commonly\ncalled Clement XIV.: he was remarkably fond of oysters. One Good\nFriday, as he was passing through this famous city in state, to assist\nat high mass at St. Peter’s Church, he saw this woman’s oysters (which\nwere remarkably fine and fresh); he could not proceed without tasting\nthem. There were about five thousand people in his train; he ordered\nthem all to stop, and sent word to the church he could not attend mass\ntill next day; then alighting from his horse (for the Pope always\nrides on horseback upon these occasions) he went into her stall, and\nate every oyster she had there, and afterwards retired into the cellar\nwhere she had a few more. This subterraneous apartment was her\nkitchen, parlour, and bed-chamber. He liked his situation so much that\nhe discharged all his attendants, and to make short of the story, His\nHoliness passed the whole night there! Before they parted he gave her\nabsolution, not only for every sin she had, but all she might\nhereafter commit.",
        "Now, gentlemen, I have his mother’s word for it (and her honour\ncannot be doubted), that Baron Tott is the fruit of that amour. When\nTott was born, his mother applied to His Holiness, as the father of\nher child; he immediately placed him under the proper people, and as\nhe grew up gave him a gentleman’s education, had him taught the use of\narms, procured him promotion in France, and a title, and when he died\nhe left him a good estate.",
