        "AND TROUBLES",
        "SHEPHERDS of people, had need know the\ncalendars of tempests in state; which are commonly greatest, when things grow to equality; as\nnatural tempests are greatest about the Equinoctia.  And as there are certain hollow blasts of wind,\nand secret swellings of seas before a tempest, so\nare there in states:",
        "Libels and licentious discourses against the state,\nwhen they are frequent and open; and in like sort,\nfalse news often running up and down, to the disadvantage of the state, and hastily embraced; are\namongst the signs of troubles.  Virgil, giving the\npedigree of Fame, saith, she was sister to the Giants:",
        "Illam Terra parens, irra irritata deorum,\nExtremam (ut perhibent) Coeo Enceladoque sororem\nProgenuit.-",
        "As if fames were the relics of seditions past; but\nthey are no less, indeed, the preludes of seditions to\ncome.  Howsoever he noteth it right, that seditious\ntumults, and seditious fames, differ no more but\nas brother and sister, masculine and feminine; especially if it come to that, that the best actions of\na state, and the most plausible, and which ought\nto give greatest contentment, are taken in ill sense,\nand traduced: for that shows the envy great, as\nTacitus saith; conflata magna invidia, seu bene\nseu male gesta premunt.  Neither doth it follow,\nthat because these fames are a sign of troubles, that\nthe suppressing of them with too much severity,\nshould be a remedy of troubles.  For the despising\nof them, many times checks them best; and the\ngoing about to stop them, doth but make a wonder\nlong-lived.  Also that kind of obedience, which\nTacitus speaketh of, is to be held suspected: Erant\nin officio, sed tamen qui mallent mandata imperantium interpretari quam exequi; disputing, excusing, cavilling upon mandates and directions, is\na kind of shaking off the yoke, and assay of disobedience; especially if in those disputings, they\nwhich are for the direction, speak fearfully and\ntenderly, and those that are against it, audaciously.",
        "Also, as Machiavel noteth well, when princes,\nthat ought to be common parents, make themselves as a party, and lean to a side, it is as a boat,\nthat is overthrown by uneven weight on the one\nside; as was well seen, in the time of Henry the\nThird of France; for first, himself entered league\nfor the extirpation of the Protestants; and presently after, the same league was turned upon himself.  For when the authority of princes, is made\nbut an accessory to a cause, and that there be other\nbands, that tie faster than the band of sovereignty,\nkings begin to be put almost out of possession.",
        "Also, when discords, and quarrels, and factions\nare carried openly and audaciously, it is a sign the\nreverence of government is lost.  For the motions\nof the greatest persons in a government, ought to\nbe as the motions of the planets under primum\nmobile; according to the old opinion: which is,\nthat every of them, is carried swiftly by the\nhighest motion, and softly in their own motion.\nAnd therefore, when great ones in their own\nparticular motion, move violently, and, as Tacitus\nexpresseth it well, liberius quam ut imperantium meminissent; it is a sign the orbs are out\nof frame.  For reverence is that, wherewith princes\nare girt from God; who threateneth the dissolving\nthereof; Solvam cingula regum.",
        "So when any of the four pillars of government,\nare mainly shaken, or weakened (which are religion, justice, counsel, and treasure), men had need\nto pray for fair weather.  But let us pass from this\npart of predictions (concerning which, nevertheless, more light may be taken from that which\nfolloweth); and let us speak first, of the materials\nof seditions; then of the motives of them; and\nthirdly of the remedies.",
        "Concerning the materials of seditions.  It is a\nthing well to be considered; for the surest way to\nprevent seditions (if the times do bear it) is to take\naway the matter of them.  For if there be fuel prepared, it is hard to tell, whence the spark shall\ncome, that shall set it on fire.  The matter of seditions is of two kinds: much poverty, and much discontentment.  It is certain, so many overthrown\nestates, so many votes for troubles.  Lucan noteth\nwell the state of Rome before the Civil War,",
        "Hinc usura vorax, rapidumque in tempore foenus,\nHinc concussa fides, et multis utile bellum.",
        "This same multis utile bellum, is an assured and\ninfallible sign, of a state disposed to seditions and\ntroubles.  And if this poverty and broken estate in\nthe better sort, be joined with a want and necessity\nin the mean people, the danger is imminent and\ngreat.  For the rebellions of the belly are the worst.\nAs for discontentments, they are, in the politic\nbody, like to humors in the natural, which are apt\nto gather a preternatural heat, and to inflame.\nAnd let no prince measure the danger of them by\nthis, whether they be just or unjust: for that were\nto imagine people, to be too reasonable; who do\noften spurn at their own good: nor yet by this,\nwhether the griefs whereupon they rise, be in fact\ngreat or small: for they are the most dangerous\ndiscontentments, where the fear is greater than\nthe feeling.  Dolendi modus, timendi non item.\nBesides, in great oppressions, the same things that\nprovoke the patience, do withal mate the courage;\nbut in fears it is not so.  Neither let any prince, or\nstate, be secure concerning discontentments, because they have been often, or have been long, and\nyet no peril hath ensued: for as it is true, that every\nvapor or fume doth not turn into a storm; so it is\nnevertheless true, that storms, though they blow\nover divers times, yet may fall at last; and, as the\nSpanish proverb noteth well, The cord breaketh at\nthe last by the weakest pull.",
        "The causes and motives of seditions are, innovation in religion; taxes; alteration of laws and customs; breaking of privileges; general oppression;\nadvancement of unworthy persons; strangers;\ndearths; disbanded soldiers; factions grown desperate; and what soever, in offending people,\njoineth and knitteth them in a common cause.",
        "For the remedies; there may be some general\npreservatives, whereof we will speak: as for the\njust cure, it must answer to the particular disease;\nand so be left to counsel, rather than rule.",
        "The first remedy or prevention is to remove, by\nall means possible, that material cause of sedition\nwhereof we spake; which is, want and poverty in\nthe estate.  To which purpose serveth the opening,\nand well-balancing of trade; the cherishing of\nmanufactures; the banishing of idleness; the repressing of waste, and excess, by sumptuary laws;\nthe improvement and husbanding of the soil; the\nregulating of prices of things vendible; the moderating of taxes and tributes; and the like.  Generally,\nit is to be foreseen that the population of a kingdom (especially if it be not mown down by wars)\ndo not exceed the stock of the kingdom, which\nshould maintain them.  Neither is the population\nto be reckoned only by number; for a smaller number, that spend more and earn less, do wear out an\nestate sooner, than a greater number that live\nlower, and gather more.  Therefore the multiplying of nobility, and other degrees of quality, in an\nover proportion to the common people, doth speedily bring a state to necessity; and so doth likewise\nan overgrown clergy; for they bring nothing to\nthe stock; and in like manner, when more are bred\nscholars, than preferments can take off .",
        "It is likewise to be remembered, that forasmuch\nas the increase of any estate must be upon the\nforeigner (for whatsoever is somewhere gotten, is\nsomewhere lost), there be but three things, which\none nation selleth unto another; the commodity as\nnature yieldeth it; the manufacture; and the vecture, or carriage.  So that if these three wheels go,\nwealth will flow as in a spring tide.  And it cometh\nmany times to pass, that materiam superabit opus;\nthat the work and carriage is more worth than the\nmaterial, and enricheth a state more; as is notably\nseen in the Low-Countrymen, who have the best\nmines above ground, in the world.",
        "Above all things, good policy is to be used, that\nthe treasure and moneys, in a state, be not gathered into few hands.  For otherwise a state may\nhave a great stock, and yet starve.  And money is\nlike muck, not good except it be spread.  This is\ndone, chiefly by suppressing, or at least keeping\na strait hand, upon the devouring trades of usury,\ningrossing great pasturages, and the like.",
        "For removing discontentments, or at least the\ndanger of them; there is in every state (as we\nknow) two portions of subjects; the noblesse and\nthe commonalty.  When one of these is discontent,\nthe danger is not great; for common people are of\nslow motion, if they be not excited by the greater\nsort; and the greater sort are of small strength,\nexcept the multitude be apt, and ready to move of\nthemselves.  Then is the danger, when the greater\nsort, do but wait for the troubling of the waters\namongst the meaner, that then they may declare\nthemselves.  The poets feign, that the rest of the\ngods would have bound Jupiter; which he hearing\nof, by the counsel of Pallas, sent for Briareus, with\nhis hundred hands, to come in to his aid.  An emblem, no doubt, to show how safe it is for monarchs, to make sure of the good will of common\npeople.  To give moderate liberty for griefs and discontentments to evaporate (so it be without too\ngreat insolency or bravery), is a safe way.  For he\nthat turneth the humors back, and maketh the\nwound bleed inwards, endangereth malign ulcers,\nand pernicious imposthumations.",
        "The part of Epimetheus mought well become\nPrometheus, in the case of discontentments: for\nthere is not a better provision against them.  Epimetheus, when griefs and evils flew abroad, at last\nshut the lid, and kept hope in the bottom of the\nvessel.  Certainly, the politic and artificial nourishing, and entertaining of hopes, and carrying men\nfrom hopes to hopes, is one of the best antidotes\nagainst the poison of discontentments.  And it is a\ncertain sign of a wise government and proceeding,\nwhen it can hold men’s hearts by hopes, when it\ncannot by satisfaction; and when it can handle\nthings, in such manner, as no evil shall appear so\nperemptory, but that it hath some outlet of hope;\nwhich is the less hard to do, because both particular persons and factions, are apt enough to flatter\nthemselves, or at least to brave that, which they\nbelieve not.",
        "Also the foresight and prevention, that there be\nno likely or fit head, whereunto discontented persons may resort, and under whom they may join,\nis a known, but an excellent point of caution.  I\nunderstand a fit head, to be one that hath greatness and reputation; that hath confidence with\nthe discontented party, and upon whom they turn\ntheir eyes; and that is thought discontented, in his\nown particular: which kind of persons, are either\nto be won, and reconciled to the state, and that in\na fast and true manner; or to be fronted with some\nother, of the same party, that may oppose them,\nand so divide the reputation.  Generally, the dividing and breaking, of all factions and combinations\nthat are adverse to the state, and setting them at\ndistance, or at least distrust, amongst themselves,\nis not one of the worst remedies.  For it is a desperate case, if those that hold with the proceeding of\nthe state, be full of discord and faction, and those\nthat are against it, be entire and united.",
        "I have noted, that some witty and sharp\nspeeches, which have fallen from princes, have\ngiven fire to seditions.  Caesar did himself infinite\nhurt in that speech, Sylla nescivit literas, non potuit dictare; for it did utterly cut off that hope,\nwhich men had entertained, that he would at one\ntime or other give over his dictatorship.  Galba undid himself by that speech, legi a se militem, non\nemi; for it put the soldiers out of hope of the donative.  Probus likewise, by that speech, Si vixero,\nnon opus erit amplius Romano imperio militibus;\na speech of great despair for the soldiers.  And\nmany the like.  Surely princes had need, in tender\nmatters and ticklish times, to beware what they\nsay; especially in these short speeches, which fly\nabroad like darts, and are thought to be shot out of\ntheir secret intentions.  For as for large  discourses,\nthey are flat things, and not so much noted.",
        "Lastly, let princes, against all events, not be\nwithout some great person, one or rather more, of\nmilitary valor, near unto them, for the repressing\nof seditions in their beginnings.  For without that,\nthere useth to be more trepidation in court upon\nthe first breaking out of troubles, than were fit.\nAnd the state runneth the danger of that which\nTacitus saith; Atque is habitus animorum fuit, ut\npessimum facinus auderent pauci, plures vellent,\nomnes paterentur.  But let such military persons be\nassured, and well reputed of, rather than factious\nand popular; holding also good correspondence\nwith the other great men in the state; or else the\nremedy, is worse than the disease.",
