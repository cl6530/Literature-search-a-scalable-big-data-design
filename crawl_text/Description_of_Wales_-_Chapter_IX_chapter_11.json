        "Not addicted to gluttony or drunkenness, this people who incur no\nexpense in food or dress, and whose minds are always bent upon the\ndefence of their country, and on the means of plunder, are wholly\nemployed in the care of their horses and furniture.  Accustomed to\nfast from morning till evening, and trusting to the care of\nProvidence, they dedicate the whole day to business, and in the\nevening partake of a moderate meal; and even if they have none, or\nonly a very scanty one, they patiently wait till the next evening;\nand, neither deterred by cold nor hunger, they employ the dark and\nstormy nights in watching the hostile motions of their enemies.",
