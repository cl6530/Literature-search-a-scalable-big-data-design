        "For a week past we have had the most wretched weather: but this\nto me is a blessing; for, during my residence here, not a single\nfine day has beamed from the heavens, but has been lost to me by\nthe intrusion of somebody. During the severity of rain, sleet,\nfrost, and storm, I congratulate myself that it cannot be worse\nindoors than abroad, nor worse abroad than it is within doors; and\nso I become reconciled. When the sun rises bright in the morning,\nand promises a glorious day, I never omit to exclaim, “There, now,\nthey have another blessing from Heaven, which they will be sure\nto destroy: they spoil everything, — health, fame, happiness,\namusement; and they do this generally through folly, ignorance,\nor imbecility, and always, according to their own account, with\nthe best intentions!” I could often beseech them, on my bended\nknees, to be less resolved upon their own destruction.",
