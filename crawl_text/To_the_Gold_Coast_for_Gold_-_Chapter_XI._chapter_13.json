        "SIERRA LEONE: THE CHANGE FOR THE BETTER.",
        "After a pleasant run, not in a ’sultry and tedious Pacific,’\ncovering 490 miles from Bathurst, we sighted a heavy cloud banking up\nthe southern horizon. As we approached it resolved itself into its three\ncomponent parts, the airy, the earthy, and the watery; and it turned out\nto be our destination. The old frowze of warm, water-laden nimbus was\nthere; everything looked damp and dank, lacking sweetness and\nsightliness; the air wanted clearing, the ground cleaning, and the sea\nwashing. Such on January 17, 1882, was the first appearance of the\nredoubtable Sierra Leone. It was a contrast to the description by the\nlearned and painstaking Winterbottom. [Footnote: An Account of the\nNative Africans im the Neighbourhood of Sierra Leone, etc. London,\nHatchard, 1803.] ’On a nearer approach the face of the country assumes a\nmore beautiful aspect. The rugged appearance of these mountains is\nsoftened by the lively verdure with which they are constantly crowned\n(?); their majestic forms (?), irregularly advancing and receding,\noccasion huge masses of light and shade to be projected from their\nsides, which add a degree of picturesque grandeur to the scene.’",
        "And first of the name. Pedro de Cintra (1480), following Soeiro da Costa\n(1462-63), is said to have applied ’Sierra Leone’ to the mountain-block\nin exchange for the ’Romarong’ of its Timni owners. He did nothing of\nthe kind: our English term is a mere confusion of two neo-Latin tongues,\n’Sierra’ being Spanish and ’Leone’ Italian. The Portuguese called it\nSerra da Leôa (of the Lioness), not ’Lion Hill.’  [Footnote: So the late\nKeith Johnston, Africa, who assigns to the apex a height of 2,500\nfeet.] Hence Milton is hardly worse than his neighbours when he writes–",
        "  Notus and Afer, black with thund’rous clouds\n  From Serraliona;",
        "and the old French ’Serrelionne’ was the most correct translation. The\nreason is disputed; some invoke the presence of the Queen of the Cats,\nothers the leonine rumbling of the re-echoed thunder. The latter\nsuggested the Montes Claros of the Portuguese. Cà da Mosto in 1505 tells\nus that the explorers ’gave the name of Sierra Leone to the mountain on\naccount of the roaring of thunder heard from the top, which is always\nburied in clouds.’ But the traveller, entering the roadstead, may see in\nthe outline of Leicester Cone a fashion of maneless lion or lioness\ncouchant with averted head, the dexter paw protruding in the shape of a\nground-bulge and the contour of the back and crupper tapering off\nnorth-eastwards. At any rate, it is as fair a resemblance as the French\nlion of Bastia and the British lion of ’Gib.’ Meanwhile those marvellous\nbeings the ’mammies’ call ’the city’ ’Sillyown,’ and the pretty, naughty\nmulatto lady married to the Missing Link termed it ’Sa Leone.’ I shall\ntherefore cleave to the latter, despite ’Mammy Gumbo’s’ box inscribed\n’Sa leone.’",
        "Presently the lighthouse, four to five miles distant from the anchorage,\nwas seen nestling at the base of old Cabo Ledo, the ’Glad Head,’ the\nTimni ’Miyinga,’ now Cape ’Sa Leone.’ Round this western point the sea\nand the discharge of two rivers run like a mill-race. According to\nBarbot (ii. 1) ’the natives call Cabo Ledo (not Liedo) or Tagrin (Cape\nSa Leone) ’Hesperi Cornu,’ the adjoining peoples (who are lamp-black)\nLeucsethiopes, and the mountain up the country Eyssadius Mons.’ All the\nmerest conjecture! Mr. Secretary Griffith, of whom more presently, here\nfinds the terminus of the Periplus of Hanno, the Carthaginian, in the\nsixth century B.C., and the far-famed gorilla-land. [Footnote: This I\nemphatically deny. Hanno describes an eruption, not a bush-fire, and Sa\nLeone never had a volcano within historic times. There is no range fit\nto be called Theôn Ochema (Vehicle of the Gods), which Ptolemy places on\nthe site of Camarones Peak, and there is no Notou Keras, or Horn of the\nSouth. Lastly, there is no island that could support the gorilla: we\nmust go further south for one, to Camarones and Corisoo in the Bight of\nBenin.]",
        "Formerly the red-tipped lantern-tower had attached to it a bungalow,\nwhere invalids resorted for fresh air; it has now fallen to pieces, and\ntwo iron seats have taken its place. Over this western end of the\npeninsula’s northern face the play of the sea-breeze is strong and\nregular; and the wester and north-wester blow, as at Freetown, fifty\ndays out of sixty. The run-in from this point is picturesque in clear\nweather, and it must have been beautiful before the luxuriant forest was\nfelled for fuel, and the land was burnt for plantations which were never\nplanted. A few noble trees linger beside and behind the lighthouse,\nfilling one with regret for the wanton destruction of their\nkind. Lighthouse Hillock, which commands the approach to the port, and\nwhich would sweep the waters as far as the Sá Leone River, will be\nprovided with powerful batteries before the next maritime war. And we\nmust not forget that Sá Leone is our only harbour of refuge, where a\nfleet can water and refit, between the Gambia and the Cape of Good Hope.",
        "The northern face of the Sá Leone peninsula is fretted with little\ncreeks and inlets, bights and lagoons, which were charming in a state of\nnature. Pirate’s Bay, the second after the lighthouse, is a fairy scene\nunder a fine sky; with its truly African tricolor, its blue waters\nreflecting air, its dwarf cliffs of laterite bespread with vivid\nleek-green, and its arc of golden yellow sand, upon which the feathery\ntops of the cocoa-palms look like pins planted in the ground. To the\ntravelled man the view suggests many a nook in the Pacific islands. The\nbathing is here excellent: natural breakwaters of black rock exclude the\nshark. The place derives its gruesome name from olden days, when the\nsmooth waters and the abundant fish and fruit tempted the fiery\nfilibusters to a relache. It was given in 1726 by Mr. Smith, surveyor to\nthe Royal African Company, after Roberts the pirate, who buried ’his\nloot’ in the Isles de Los, had burned an English ship. There is also a\ntradition that Drake chose it for anchoring.",
        "Beyond Pirate’s Bay, and separated by a bushy and wooded point, lies\nAberdeen Creek, a long reach extending far into the interior, and\nmaking, after heavy rains, this portion of the country",
        "  Both land and island twice a day.",
        "The whole site of Sa Leone is quasi-insular. Bunce or Bunch River to the\nnorth, and Calamart or Calmont, usually called Campbell’s Creek, from\nthe south, are said to meet at times behind the mountain-mass; and at\nall seasons a portage of a mile enables canoes to paddle round the\nhill-curtain behind Freetown. This conversion of peninsula into islet is\nby no means rare in the alluvial formations further south.",
        "Aberdeen Creek abounds in sunken rocks, which do not, however, prevent a\nferry-boat crossing it. Governor Rowe began a causeway to connect it\nwith the next village, and about a third of the length has already been\ndone by convict labour. Aberdeen village is a spread of low thatched\nhuts, lining half-cleared roads by courtesy called streets. Murray Town\nand Congo Town bring us to King Tom’s Point. Here is the old Wesleyan\nCollege, a large whitewashed bungalow with shingled roof, upper\njalousies, and lower arches; the band of verdure in front being\ndefended from the waves by a dwarf sea-wall and a few trees still\nlingering around it. The position is excellent: the committee, however,\nsold it because the distance was too great for the boys to walk, and\nbought a fitter place near Battery Point. Thus it became one of the many\nGovernment stores. A deep indentation now shows Upper Town or Kru Town,\nheaps of little thatched hovels divided by remnants of bush. It is,\ndespite its brook, one of the impurest sites in the colony: nothing can\nteach a Kruman cleanliness; a Slav village is neatness itself compared\nwith his. This foul colony settled early in Sá Leone, and in 1816 an\nordinance was passed enabling it to buy its bit of land. The present\nchief is ’King’ Tom Peter, who is also a first-class police-constable\nunder the Colonial Grovernment; and his subjects hold themselves far\nsuperior to their brethren in the old home down coast. ’We men work for\ncash-money; you men work for waist-cloth.’ Again ’pig-iron and tenpenny\nnails!’",
        "Beyond this point, at a bend of the bight, we anchor a few hundred feet\nfrom the shore, and we command a front view of roadstead and ’city.’\nSt. George’s Bay, the older ’Baie de France,’ would be impossible but\nfor the Middle Ground, the Scarcies Bank, and other huge shoals of sand\npinned down by rocks which defend the roadstead from the heavy send of\nthe sea. It is supplied with a tide-rip by the Tagrin, Mitomba, Rokel,\nor Rokelle, the Sá Leone River, which Barbot makes the ancients term Nia\n(Nia), and which the Timni tribe call Robung Dakell, or Stream of\nScales. Hence some identify it with Pliny’s ’flumen Bambotum crocodilis\net hippopotamis refertum.’ Its northern bank is the low Bullom shore, a\nlong flat line of mud and mangrove, on which all the fevers, Tertiana,\nQuartana, and Co., hold their court. The sea-facing dot is Leopard,\nanciently Leopold, Island, where it is said a leopard was once seen: it\nis, however, a headland connected by a sandspit with the leeward-most\npoint of the coast. The Bullom country takes a name after its tribe. A\nscore of years ago I was told they were wild as wild can be: now the\nchief, Alimami (El-Imám) Sanúsi, hospitably receives white faces at his\ncapital, Callamondia. Moreover, a weekly post passes through Natunu to\nKaikonki via Yongro, Proboh, and Bolloh.",
        "Inland (east) of the Bulloms, or lowlanders, dwell the Timnis, who drove\nto seaward the quondam lords of the land. Kissy, Sherbro, and Casamansa\nare all named from their ’Reguli.’ They retain a few traditional words,\nsuch as ’potu,’ meaning a European: similarly in Central Africa the King\nof Portugal is entitled Mueneputo. Butter is also ’Mantinka,’ the\nLusitanian Mantêiga, and a candle is Kandirr. Although ’the\nreligion of Islam seems likely to diffuse itself peaceably over the\nwhole district in which the colony (Sá Leone) is situated, carrying with\nit those advantages which seem ever to have attended its victory over\nnegro superstition,’ [Footnote: Report of Directors of Sierra Leone\nCompany to the House of Commons, quoted by Winterbottom and the\nRev. Mr. Macbriar.] the tribe has remained pagan.",
        "Buttressing the southern shore of the Rokel’s débouchure is a dwarf\nGhaut, a broken line of sea-subtending highlands, stretching\nsouth-south-east some eighteen miles from Cape Sá Leone to Cape\nShilling. Inland of these heights the ground is low. The breadth of the\npeninsula is about twelve miles, which would give it an area of 300\nsquare miles, larger than the Isle of Wight. There are, besides it, the\nKwiah (Quiah) country, British Sherbro, an important annexation dated\n1862; the Isles de Los, the Bananas, and a strip of land on the Bullom\nshore,–additions which more than treble the old extent.",
        "The peninsula is distinctly volcanic, and subject to earthquakes: the\nseismic movement of 1858 extended to the Gold Coast, and was a precursor\nof the ruins of 1862. [Footnote: For the older earthquakes see\nWinterbottom, i, 34-5.] Its appearance, however, is rather that of a\nsandstone region, the effect of the laterite or volcanic mud which, in\nlong past ages, has been poured over the plutonic ejections; and the\nsoftly rounded contours, with here and there a lumpy cone, a tongue of\nland, and a gentle depression, show the long-continued action of water\nand weather. This high background, which arrests the noxious vapours of\nthe lowlands and of the Bullom shore, and which forbids a thorough\ndraught, is the fons malorum, the grand cause of the fevers and malaria\nfor which the land has an eternal ill fame. The ’Sultan’ of the Ghauts\nis Regent Mountain, or Sugarloaf Peak, a kind of lumpy ’parrot’s beak’\nwhich rises nearly 3,000 feet above sea-level: one rarely sees even its\nbase. The trip to the summit occupies two days; and here wild coffee is\nsaid to flourish, as it does at Kwiah and other parts of the\nlowland. The ’Wazir’ is Wilberforce, which supports sundry hamlets set\nin dense bush; and Leicester Cone, the lioness-hill, ranks third. The\nfew reclaimed patches, set in natural shrubbery, are widely scattered:\nthe pure, unsophisticated African is ever ashamed of putting hand to hoe\nor plough; and, where the virgin soil would grow almost everything, we\ncannot see a farm and nothing is rarer than a field. Firing the bush\nalso has been unwisely allowed: hence the destruction of much valuable\ntimber and produce; for instance, tallow-trees and saponaceous\nnut-trees, especially the Pentadesma butyracea, and the noble\nforest which once clothed the land from Sá Leone to the Niger.",
        "Looking towards the Rokel River, we see the Fourah Bay and College, a\nlarge and handsome building, now terribly out of repair. This\nestablishment, the ’Farran’s House’ of old maps, is well known to\nreaders of propagandist works; it opened on February 18, 1828, with six\npupils, one of whom was the ’boy Ajai,’ now Bishop Crowther of the Niger\nterritory. The Church Missionary Society has spent upon it a small\ntreasury of money; at present it ranks as a manner of university, having\nbeen affiliated in May 1876 to that of Durham. Sealed papers are sent\nout from England, but perhaps the local examiners are easy distributors\nof B.A.s and so forth to the golden youth of Sá Leone. It is free to\nall, irrespective of religious denomination, a liberal concession which\ndoes it high honour. The academical twelve-month has three terms; and\nthere are three scholarships, each worth 40l. per annum, open for\ncompetition every year. Not bad for a maximum of sixteen students, whose\ntotal is steadily diminishing. College evening-classes are held for the\nbenefit of those who must work by day; and charges are exceedingly\nmoderate, the admission fee being 10s. 6d. The Society\nproposes, they say, to give it up. It may be wanted half a century\nhence. [Footnote: An annual report is published. Those curious on the\nsubject will consult it.]",
        "West of Fourah College, and separated, longo intervallo, by an\napparently unbroken bush, is Bishop’s Court, where the Right Reverend\nlives as long as he can or will. Nearer the ’city’ lies the deep little\nbight called Susan or Sawpit Bay. It is also known as Destruction Bay–a\ngloomy name–where ships caught carrying ’bales,’ or ’dry goods,’ or\n’blackbirds,’ were broken up. Twenty years ago traces of their ruins\nwere still seen. Susan is now provided with a large factory: here\n’factories’ do not manufacture. A host of boats and dug-outs, a\nswarm of natives like black ants, a long wooden jetty, and some very\ntall houses denote the place where Messrs. Randall and Fisher store and\nsell their Kola-nuts. This astringent, the Gora of old writers\n(Sterculia acuminata), acts in Africa like the Brazilian Guaraná,\nthe Kát (Catha edulis) of southern Arabia, the Betel-nut of\nHindostan, and the opium of China, against which certain bigots, with\nall the presumption of utter ignorance, have been, and still are, waging\nan absurd war. Sá Leone exported 3,445l. worth of Kola-nuts in\n1860; in 1870 10,400l.; and, in 1880, 24,422l. The demand\ntherefore increases and will increase. [Footnote: Mr. Griffith says,\n’The Mohammedans of Africa have a singular belief that if they die with\na portion of this nut in their stomach their everlasting happiness is\nsecured.’ This must be some fanciful Christian tale. Amongst them,\nhowever, the red Kola, when sent to the stranger, denotes war, the white\nKola peace.]",
        "In Susan Bay there is a good coal-shed with a small supply for the use\nof the colonial steamer. A store of compressed coal is on the town-front\nand heaps used to lie about King Tom’s Point. A hulk was proposed and\nrefused. It is now intended to increase the quantity, for the benefit of\nfuture companies, especially the ’Castle Line,’ which talks of sending\ntheir steamers to Sá Leone. I hope they will so do; more competition is\nmuch wanted. But the coal-depôt may prove dangerous. The mineral in the\ntropics produces by its exhalations fatal fevers, especially that\nexaggerated form of bilious-remittent popularly known as ’Yellow Jack.’\nIt is certain that in places like West Indian St. Thomas the\nneighbourhood of the coal-sheds is more unhealthy, without apparent\nreason, than the sites removed from it.",
        "And now we reach Freetown proper, which may be called Cathedral-Town or\nJail-Town. At a distance the ’Liverpool’ or ’London of West Africa,’ as\nthe lieges wildly entitle it, is not unpicturesque; but the style of\nbeauty is that of a baronial castle on the Rhine with an unpensioned\nproprietor, ruinous and tumbledown. After Las Palmas and Santa Cruz it\nlooks like a dingy belle who has seen better and younger days; and who,\nmoreover, has forgotten her paint. She has suffered severely from the\nabolition of the export slave-trade, in whose palmy times she supplied\nmany a squadron, and she will not be comforted for the loss.",
        "The colours of the houses are various; plain white is rare, and the\nprevailing tints are the light-brick of the fresh laterite and the dark\nrusty ochre of the old. But all are the same in one point, the mildewed,\ncankered, gangrened aspect, contrasting so unfavourably with the\nwhitewashed port-towns of the Arabs. The upper stories of wood-work\nbased on masonry, the fronting piazzas or galleries, the huge\nplank-balconies, and the general use of shingle roofs–in fact, the\nquantity of tinder-timber, reminding one of olden Cairo, are real risks:\nsome of the best houses have been destroyed by fire; and, as in\nValparaiso and the flue-warmed castles of England, it is only a question\nof time when the inmates will be houseless. Thanks to the form of\nground, the townlet is well laid out, with a gradual rake towards the\nbay. But there is no marine parade, and the remarkably uneven\nhabitations crowd towards the water-front, like those of Eastern ports,\nthinning off and losing style inland. The best are placed to catch the\n’Doctor,’ or sea-breeze: here, as at Zanzibar, the temperature out of\nthe wind becomes unendurable.",
        "Freetown lies upon a gentle declivity, a slope of laterite and diluvium\nwashed down from the higher levels. The ground is good for drainage, but\nthe soft and friable soil readily absorbs the deluging torrents of rain,\nand as readily returns them to the air in the shape of noxious\nvapours. The shape is triangular. The apex is ’Tower Hill,’ so named\nfrom a ruined martello, supposed to have been built by the Dutch, and\ntill lately used for stores. The barracks, which lodge one of the West\nIndia regiments, are six large blocks crowning the hill-crest and girt\nwith a low and loopholed wall. In winter, or rather in the December\nsummer, the slopes are clad in fine golden stubbles, the only spectacle\nof the kind which this part of the coast affords. Though not more than\nfour hundred feet or so above sea-level, the barracks are free from\nyellow fever; and in the years when the harbour-town has been almost\ndepopulated the only fatal cases were those brought up from\nbelow. Moreover, the disease did not spread. The officers’ quarters,\nwith cool and lofty rooms, twenty feet high, are surrounded by shady and\nairy piazzas or verandahs, where the wind, when there is any, must find\nits way. For many years they had jalousies and half-windows\ninstead of glass, which forced the inmates to sit in outer darkness\nduring tornadoes and the Rains. The garrison, like the town, owes an\neternal debt of gratitude to Governor J. Pope Henessy. Seeing the main\nwant of Sá Leone, he canalised in 1872, with the good aid of\nMr. Engineer Jenkins, a fine fountain rising below ’Heddle’s Farm,’\nenabling the barracks to have a swimming-bath and the townsfolk to lay\non, through smaller pipes, a fair supply of filtered water. For this\nalone he amply deserves a statue; but colonies, like republics, are\nrarely grateful.",
        "The sea-front of the triangle, whose lowest houses are sprinkled by the\nwave-spray, is bounded on the east by Battery Point. It is a grassy flat\nwith a few fine trees, and benches ever black with the native\nlounger. Here the regimental band plays on Wednesdays; an occasional\ncircus pitches its tents, and ’beauty and fashion’ flock to see and be\nseen. The many are on foot; the few use Bath-chairs or machilas,\n–fautenils hung to a pole. The only carriage in the place\nbelongs to the Governor, and he lost no time in losing one of\nhis horses. Riding is apparently unknown.",
        "The Battery is the old Fort Falconbridge. A worm-eaten gun or two, far\nmore dangerous to those in rear than to those in front, rises en\nbarbette. The affair would fall in half an hour before the mildest\nof gunboats. Yet by fortifying three points at an expense of some 6,000£\nto 8,000£ Sá Leone might be decently defended. The first is Lighthouse\nPoint, along which ships entering and leaving perforce must run; the\nsecond would be King Tom’s Point, flanking the harbour-front; and the\nthird would be Johnson’s Battery, where salutes are now fired, a work\nlying above Government House upon a spur of Barrack Hill. Needless to\nsay all three would want the heaviest guns.",
        "Running the eye west of the Battery, a few wooden houses or sheds, some\nof them overhanging the dwarf cliff, the black rocks, and the red-yellow\nsands, lead to Taylor’s warehouses, a huge pile of laterite still\nunfinished. Here the traditional ’man and boy’ may sometimes be seen\nworking in the cooler and more comfortable hours. Beyond it, on a level\nwith the water, stands the new camber, where we shall land. Then comes\nthe huge block built by Mr. Charles Heddle, of Hoy, who by grace of a\nlarge fortune, honourably made at Freetown, has become proprietor of a\nnoble château and broad lands in France. It has now been converted into\nthe Crown commissariat-store. The sea-frontage has a clear fall of\neighty feet, whereas, from the street behind the wooden upper story, it\nappears below the average height. Very mean are the custom-house and\nadjoining coal-shed. Governor ’Dangan’s Wharf,’ a contemptible jetty,\nand its puny lighthouse have at length made way for a quay, along which\nships, despite sunken rocks, were expected to lie; but the sea soon\nbroke down the perpendicular wall, and now it is being rebuilt with a\n’batter.’ A hollow square behind it shows the workmen blasting the\nmaterial, a fine-grained grey granite, which seems here, as at Axim, to\nbe the floor-rock of the land. No wonder that the new harbour-works have\ncost already 70,000l., of which 50,637l. are still owed,\nand that the preposterous wharfage-duty is 10s. per ton. To avoid\nthis and the harbour-dues, ships anchor, whenever they safely can, in\nthe offing, where the shoals are Nature’s breakwaters. West of the\nquarry-hollow, in my day a little grassy square, are the old\nCommissariat-quarters, now a bonded warehouse. This building is also a\nlong low cottage viewed from inland, and a tall, grim structure seen\nfrom the sea. On a higher level stands St. George’s, once a church, but\nyears ago promoted to a cathedral-dignity, making Freetown proud as\nBarchester Towers. We shall presently pass it and its caricature, the\npert little Wesleyan church to its east. The extreme west of the\ntriangle-base is occupied by the gaol. No longer a ’barn-like structure\nfaced by a black wall,’ it is a lengthy scatter of detached buildings,\nlarge enough to accommodate half the population, and distinguished by\nits colour, a light ashen grey. Behind this projecting site lies King\nJimmy’s Bridge, a causeway through whose central arch a stream of\nsparkling water winds its way seawards.",
        "Below King Jimmy’s Bridge is the only antiquity which Sá Leone\nknows. Here, according to some, Sir Francis Drake, the discoverer of\nCalifornia and her gold, the gallant knight of whom the Virgin Queen\nsaid that ’his actions did him more honour than his title,’ left his\nname upon the buttress of primitive rock. Others have (correctly?)\nattributed the inscription to Sir John Hawkins, the old naval worthy\nwhose name still blossoms in the dust at Sá Leone as the ’first slaver.’\nThe waters and the tramp of negro feet have obliterated the epigraph,\nwhich was, they say, legible forty years ago. The rock is covered with\ngriffonages; and here some well-cut square letters easily read–",
        "Near this ’written rock’ is King James’s Well, a pure stream which in\nformer times supplied the shipping.",
        "The scene in the harbour is by no means lively, although the three or\nfour dismantled merchant-craft, dreary as the settlement, have now\ndisappeared. A little white-painted colonial steamer, a dwarf\npaddle-wheeler, the Prince of Wales, lies moping and solitary off\nfoul Krutown Bay. At times a single gunboat puts in an appearance. There\nmay be a French steamer with a blue anchor on a white flag bound for\nSherbro, or the Isles de Los; and a queer Noah’s Ark kind of craft,\nbelonging to Mr. Broadhurst, a partner in Randall and Fisher’s, runs to\nthe river Scarcies and others. These are the grandees of the waters. The\nmiddle class is composed of Porto Loko [Footnote: Porto Loko–not\nLocco–derives its name from a locust-tree, whose fruit is an ingredient\nin ’palaver sauce;’ and Winterbottom (I.4), who calls it Logo, derives\nthe word from the land of that name.] boats, which affect the streams\nand estuaries. Originally canoes, they were improved to the\nfelucca-type of the Portuguese, and the hulls reminded Cameron and\nmyself of the Zanzibarian ’Mtepe.’ A strong standing-awning of wood\noccupies the sternward third; the masts number two or three, with a\nshort jib, and there are six oars on each side, worked by men on foot,\nwho alternately push and pull–a thoroughly novel process in rowing.\nThe Sá Leone boats which carry passengers on shore are carefully named,\nbut apparently never washed: they want the sunshades of the Bathurst\ncraft. The commonalty of the sea is the host of dug-outs, in which the\nsable fisherman, indolently thrown back, props his feet upon the\ngunwales and attaches a line to each big toe. These men land little more\nthan enough for their own subsistence, and the market-supply is\ninfinitesimal compared with what industry and proper appliances might\nproduce.",
        "The background of the ’city’ is a green curtain of grass and\nfruit-trees, amongst which predominate the breadfruit, an early\nintroduction; the prim dark mango, somewhat like an orange multiplied by\ntwo, or three, and palms, ever present in equinoctial lowlands. On the\nheights above the settlement there is room for cool country-seats, where\nEuropean exiles might live comparatively safe from fever and the more\ndeadly dysentery. A white lodge peeping from a densely wooded\nmountain-flank, originally Carnes’s Farm and now Heddle’s Farm, was\ncalled Mount Oriel (Oriole?) by Mrs. Melville, the wife of a pensioned\njudge of the Mixed Customs Court, who lived here seven years. Her sketch\nof a sojourn upon the Lioness Range is not tempting: young gentlemen who\nintend leading brides to the deadly peninsula should hide the book from\ntheir fair intendeds. I cannot, however, but admire the ’word-painting’\nof the scenery and the fidelity of those descriptions concerning which I\nhave a right to form an opinion. The book [Footnote: A Residence in\nSierra Leone. By a Lady. London: Murray, 1849.] was edited by the late\nMrs. Caroline Norton.",
        "Though not more than 550 feet above sea-level, the climate of Heddle’s\nFarm is said to be wholly different from that of the lower town. The\nproperty was bought by Government for a song, and now it occasionally\nlodges a sick governor or a convalescent officer. During my last visit\nthe Sa Leonites spoke of building a sanatorium at Wilberforce village,\nalias Signal Hill, where a flag announces the approach of vessels. The\ntenement rose to nearly the first story, when it stopped short for want\nof funds. Now they talk of a white regiment being stationed at the\n’White Man’s Grave,’ and propose barracks high up the hills beyond sight\nof the town-frontage. The site was pointed out to me where the\nartillery-range now is, and beyond where a dwarf thatch shows the\nmusketry-ground of the West India regiment. We shall sight from afar,\nwhen steaming out southwards, the three white dots which represent\nquarters on Leicester Cone; now they are hidden in frowsy\nfog-clouds. But all these heights have one and the same\ndisadvantage. You live in a Scotch mist, you breathe as much water as\nair, and you exchange fever and dysentery for rheumatism, and lumbago,\nand all that dire cohort.",
        "Presently the health-officer with his blue flag gave us pratique, and\nthe fort-adjutant with his red flag carried off our only soldier. The\nlatter, with a hospitality rare, it is to be hoped, in British\nregiments, would hardly recognise his quondam shipmates. We were duly\ninterviewed, in most civilised style, by a youth who does this work for\nMr. George A. Freeman, manager of the ’West African Reporter.’  Then the\ns.s. Senegal was attacked and captured by a host of sable\nvisitors, some coming to greet their friends, other to do a little\nbusiness in the washing and the shoreboat lines.",
        "The washerwoman lost no time in showing up, although her charges have\nbeen greatly reduced. She formerly demanded nearly treble as much as in\nLondon; now, however, she makes only sixteen to twenty shillings a\nmonth, not bad pay in a place where living costs threepence, and\ncomfortable living sixpence, a day. These nymphs of the wash-tub are\npainfully familiar and plain. The dress is a bright cotton foulard bound\non like the anatomy of a turban and garnished, as were our grandmothers’\nnightcaps, with huge front bows. Gaudy shawls cover white cotton\njackets; and skirts of bright, showy longcloth suggest the parrot or the\ncockatoo. The ornaments are large gold earrings and necklaces of beads\nor coral. I could not but remark the difference of tone. There was none\nof the extreme ’bumptiousness’ and pugnacious impudence of twenty years\nago; indeed, the beach-boys, nowhere a promising class, were rather\ncivil than otherwise. Not a single allusion to the contrast of ’white\nniggahs and black gen’lemen.’ Nor did the unruly, disorderly African\ncharacter ever show itself, as formerly it often did, by fisticuffing,\nhair-pulling, and cursing, with a mixture of English and Dark-Continent\nideas and phraseology, whose tout ensemble was really portentous.",
        "The popular voice ascribes this immense change for the better to the\nenergetic action of Governor S. Rowe (1876); and if so his statue\ndeserves to stand beside that of Pope Henessy. We could not fairly\ncomplain of the inordinate noise, which would have been the death of\na sick traveller. Niger cannot speak without bawling. The charge for\nlanding was only threepence; en revanche the poor fellows\nstole every little thing they could, including my best meerschaum.",
        "Cameron and I went ashore to hire Krumen for the Gold Coast, and herein\nwe notably failed. We disembarked at the camber, a huge pile of masonry,\nwhose weight upon an insecure foundation has already split the sea-wall\nin more than one place. The interior also is silting up so fast that it\nwill constantly require dredging to admit boats. In fact, the colony\nmust deeply repent not having patronised Mr. Jenkins’s project of a\nT-headed pier, on one side of which landing would have been practicable\nin all weathers.",
        "The sun, despite the mist, seemed to burn our backs, and the glare from\nthe red clay soil roasted our eyes as we toiled up the ramp, bad as\nthose of ’Gib.,’ which leads to Water Street, the lower line subtending\nthe shore. Here we could inspect St. George’s Cathedral, built, they\nsay, at a cost of 10,000l. to 15,000l., which would be\nreduced to 5,000l. in England–contracts in such ’colonies’ cost\nmore than stone and slate. The general aspect is that of its Bombay\nbrother, and the order is called, I believe, neo-Gothic, the last insult\nto ecclesiastical architecture. A single rusty tower, with\ntoy-battlements, pins down along ridge-back, evidently borrowed from a\nbarn; the light yellow-wash is mildewed and weather-stained, and the\nwindows show unseemly holes. Surely Bishop Cheetham could have afforded\na few panes of glass when exchanging his diocese for a rectory in\nEngland. Let me here note that the Catholic bishop at Goa and elsewhere\nis expected to die at his post, and that there is an over-worldly look\nin this Protestant form of the ’nolo episcopari.’ East of the cathedral,\nand uncompromisingly ’Oriented’ to the north, stands the unfinished\nshell of a Wesleyan chapel, suggesting that caricature which has\nintruded itself into the shadow of York Minster. Some 5,000l.\nwere spent upon this article by the locals; but the home committee\nwisely determined that it should not be finished, and now they propose\nto pull it down for building-material.",
        "We then entered the fruit and vegetable market, a neat and well-paved\nbazar, surmounted by a flying roof and pierced for glass windows. The\ndead arches in the long walls are externally stone and internally\nbrick. The building was full of fat middle-aged negresses, sitting at\nsquat before their ’blyes,’ or round baskets, which contained a variety\nand confusion of heterogeneous articles. The following is a list almost\nas disorderly as the collection itself.",
        "There were pins and needles, yarn and thread, that have taken the place\nof the wilder thorn and fibre; all kinds of small hardware;\nlooking-glasses in lacquered frames; beads of sorts, cowries and reels\nof cotton; pots of odorous pomatum and shea-butter nuts; feathers of the\nplantain-bird and country snuff-boxes of a chestnut-like fruit (a\nstrychnine?) from which the powder is inhaled, more majorum,\nthrough a quill; physic-nuts (tiglium, or croton), a favourite\nbut painful native remedy; horns of the goat and antelope, possibly\nintended for fetish ’medicine;’ blue-stone, colcothar and other\ndrugs. Amongst the edibles appeared huge achatinae, which make an\nexcellent soup, equal to that of the French snail; ground-nuts; very\npoor rice of four varieties, large and small, red and dark; cheap\nginger, of which the streets are at times redolent, and which makes good\nhome-brewed ’pop;’ the Kolá-nut, here worth a halfpenny and at Bathurst\na penny each; the bitter Kolá, a very different article from the\nesculent; skewered rôts of ground-hog, a rodent that can climb,\ndestroy vegetables, and bite hard if necessary; dried bats and rats,\nwhich the African as well as the Chinese loves, and fish cuits au\nsoleil, preferred when ’high,’ to use the mildest adjective. From\nthe walls hung dry goods, red woollen nightcaps and comforters,\nleopards’ and monkeys’ skins, and the pelt of an animal which might have\nbeen a gazelle.",
        "Upon the long counters or tables were displayed the fruits and\nvegetables. The former were the custard-apple or sweet-sop (Annona\nsquamosa), the sour-sop (A. muricata), the Madeiran\nchirimoya, (A. cherimolia), citrons, sweet and sour limes,\nand oranges, sweet and bitter, grown in the mountains; bananas\n(M. paradisiaca), the staff of life on the Gold Coast, and\nplantains (M. sapientum), the horse-plantains of India;\n[Footnote: The West Indian plantain is apparently unknown or unused]\npine-apples more than half wild; mangoes terribly turpentiney unless the\ntrunk be gashed to let out the gum; ’monkey-plums’ or ’apples’ and\n’governor’s plums.’ The common guavas are rank and harsh, but the\n’strawberry guava,’ as it is locally called, has a delicate, subacid\nflavour not easily equalled. The aguacáte, or alligator-pear\n(Persea gratissima), which was not ’introduced by the\nBasel missionaries from the West Indies,’ is inferior to the\nMexican. Connoisseurs compare its nutty flavour with that of the\nfilbert, and eat it with pepper, salt, and the sauce of Worcester, whose\nfortune was made by the nice conduct of garlic. The papaw [Footnote: The\nleaves are rubbed on meat to make it tender, and a drop of milk from the\nyoung fruit acts as a vermifuge.] should be cooked as a vegetable and\nstuffed with forced meat; the flesh of the granadilla, which resembles\nit, is neglected, while the seeds and their surroundings are flavoured\nwith sherry and sugar. There is an abundance of the Eriobotrya\nJaponica, in Madeira called the loquat and elsewhere the Japanese\nmedlar: it grows wild in the Brazil, where the people distil from\nit. [Footnote: I cannot yet decide whether its birthplace is Japan or\nSouth America, whose plants have now invaded Western India and greatly\naltered the vegetation.]",
        "The chief vegetables were the watercress, grown in private gardens;\nonions, large and mild as the Spanish; calavances, or beans;\nokras or gumbos, the bhendi of India (Hibiscus\nesculentus), the best thickening for soup; bengwas, or\negg-plants; yams (Dioscorea bulbifera) of sorts; bitter Cassada\n(Jatropha manihot) and the sweet variety (Jatropha\njanipha); garlic; kokos (Colocasia esculenta); potatoes,\nwhich the steamers are beginning to bring from England, not from\nMadeira; tomatoes like musket-balls, but very sweet and wholesome; and\nthe batata, (Convolvulus patatus, or sweet potato), which\nwhilom made ’kissing comfits.’  The edibles consisted of’ fufu’\n(plantain-paste); of ’cankey,’ a sour pudding of maize-flour; of\nginger-cake; of cassava-balls finely levigated, and of sweetened\n’agadi,’ native bread in lumps, wrapped up in plantain-leaves. Toddy was\nthe usual drink offered for sale.",
        "The butchers’ yard, near the market, is no longer a ’ragged and\nuncleanly strip of ground.’ The long-horned cattle, small, mostly\nhumpless, and resembling the brindled and dun Alderney cow, are driven\nin from the Pulo (Fulah) country. I have described the beef as tasting\nnot unlike what one imagines a knacker’s establishment to produce, and\nsince that time I have found but scant improvement. It is sold on\nalternate days with mutton, the former costing 6d., the latter\n9d. a pound. Veal, so bad in England and so good in Southern\nEurope, is unknown. The long, lean, hairy black-and-white sheep do not\nsupply an excellent article. Goats and kids are plentiful, and the flesh\nwould be good if it had any taste. Hogs abound, as in Ireland; but no\none eats pork, for the best of reasons. The poultry-list comprises\nsmall tough fowls (l0d. to 2s.), partridges, ducks (2s.\n6d.), geese, especially the spur-winged from Sherbro,\nand the Muscovy or Manilla duck–a hard-fleshed, insipid bird, whose old\nhome was South American Paraguay–turkeys (10s. to 15s.),\nand the arripiada, or frizzly chicken, whose feathers stand on\nend. Milk is scarce and dear. Englishmen raw in the tropics object to\nmilch-goats and often put up with milch-pigs, which are said to be here\nkept for the purpose. I need not tell all the old tale, ’Goat he go die;\npig he go for bush,’ &c. Butter (1s. 8d. in 2-lb. tins) is\noily and rancid, with the general look of cartgrease, in this tropical\ntemperature. It is curious that the Danish and Irish dairies cannot\nsupply the West African public with a more toothsome article.",
        "Near the meat-market is the double row of houses with shops upon the\nground-floor, not unlike a Banyan’s street in outer Bombay, but smaller,\ndirtier, meaner far. Here the stranger can buy dry goods and a few\ncuriosities of Mandenga manufacture–grigris (teraphim or charms), bows,\nspears, and saddles and bridles like those of the Somal, both perfectly\nuseless to white men. The leather, however, is excellent as the\nMoroccan, and the work dates from the days when the Saracens pushed\nsouthwards from the Mediterranean to the Niger-valley. Wild animals are\nat times offered for sale, but Darkey has heard exaggerated accounts of\nprices paid in England for grey parrots, palm-birds, monkeys,\nbush-antelopes, mongooses, ground-pigs, and other ’small deer’ brought\nfrom the rivulets behind Freetown. Sundry snakes were offered for sale,\nthe Mandenga, 4 to 5 feet long, with black marks upon a yellow ground,\nand the spitting serpent, between 5 and 6 feet long, with a long head,\nalso dark above and silvery grey below. I doubted the fact of its\nejecting saliva till assured by the Rev. John Milum that two\nmissionaries at Lagos, Messieurs J. B. Wood and David, had suffered\nseverely from inflamed eyes after the contemptuous ophine\ncrachat. All along the coast is a cerastes (horned snake), whose\narmature is upon the snout and whose short fat form suggests the\npuff-adder. The worst is a venomous-looking cobra, or hooded viper, with\nflat, cordate head, broad like all the more ferocious species. It is the\nonly thanatophid whose bite I will not undertake to cure. We carried on\nthe A.S.S. Winnebah, for the benefit of Mr. Cross, of Liverpool,\na big black ape, which the Sá Leonites called a ’black chimpanzee.’\nThough badly wounded she had cost 27l., and died after a few days\nof the cage. The young chimpanzees were valued at 61.",
        "I looked in vain for the old inn, the only thing in the place, a dirty\nhovel, kept, in 1862, by a Liberian negro, inscribed ’Lunch-house’ on a\nsign-board flanked by the Union Jack and the U.S. ’oysters and\ngridiron.’ Nothing has succeeded to this ’American hotel,’ and visitors\nmust depend upon the hospitality of acquaintances. A Frenchman lately\nopened a Gasthaus, and lost no time in becoming bankrupt. There\nis, however, a manner of boarding-house kept by a Mrs. King.",
        "Turning south from Water Street, we passed the Wilberforce, or rather\nthe ’Willyfoss,’ memorial, a colossal scandal noticed by every visitor\nat Sá Leone, a ’folly’ which has cost 3,000l. Its condition is\nexactly what it was two decads ago–a chapel-like shell of dingy, mouldy\nlaterite with six lancet-windows and metal pillars. Its case is a\ncomplicated concern. The ecclesiastical authorities wanted it for their\npurposes, and so did the secular civilians, and so did the military. At\nlast the Sá Leonites, hopeless of obtaining a Government grant, have set\non foot a subscription which reached 500l.–some say 700l.\nThere are, therefore, certain fitful signs of activity, and\nbricks and fire-bricks now cumber the ground; but it is all a ’flash\nin the pan.’ The present purpose is to make it a library, in place of\nthe fine old collection which went to the dogs. It is also to serve as a\nlecture-room. But who is there in the ’African Liverpool’ that can\nlecture? What is he to lecture about? Who will stand or sit out being\nlectured?",
        "Immediately beyond this grim and grisly reminiscence are the neat\ndwelling-house and the store of the Honourable Mr. Sybille Boyle, so\nnamed from a ship and from her captain, R.N., who served in the\npreventive squadron about 1824. He is an unofficial member of Council\nand a marked exception to the rule of the ’Liberateds.’ Everybody has a\ngood word to say of him. The establishment is the regular colonial,\nwhere you can buy anything between a needle and a sheet-anchor. Bottled\nale is not wanting, and thus steamer-passengers learn to congregate in\nthe back parlour.",
        "We then walked to the top of Gloucester Street, expecting to see the\nDuke of Edinburgh’s memorial. I left it an arch of sticks and timber\nspanning this main cross-line, which leads to Government House. The\ntemporary was to be supplanted by a permanent marble arc de\ntriomphe, commemorating the auspicious occasion when the black\ncolony first looked upon a live white Royal Highness. At once\n700l. was subscribed, and only 800l. was wanting; but all\nthose interested in the matter died, and the 350l. which remained\nin the chest was, I believe, transferred to the ’Willyfoss.’  The august\nday is still kept as a public holiday, for the people are, after their\nfashion, loyal-mouthed in the extreme. But the memorial is clean\nforgotten, and men stare if you ask about it. Half-way up the street is\nthe post-office, whose white chief is not a whit more civil than the\nnegro head in 1862.",
        "Upon this highly interesting spot we stood awhile to note the\npeculiarities of the place and its position. The soil is a loose clay,\ndeep-red or brown, impregnated with iron and, where unclothed with\nhumus, cold and infertile, as the spontaneous aloe shows. The subsoil is\nlaterite, also highly ferruginous. Soft and working well with the axe\nwhile it retains the quarry-water, it soon hardens by exposure; and,\nthus weathered, it forms the best and ugliest of the local building\nmaterials. Embedded in the earth’s surface are blocks and boulders\napparently erratic, dislodged or washed down from the upper heights,\nwhere similar masses are seen. Many are scattered, as if by an eruption;\nothers lie in slab or dome shape upon the shore. The shape is usually\nspheroidal, and the material hypersthene (a hard and close-grained\nbluish granite) or diorite, greenstone-trap blackened by sun and\nrain. In the few cuttings of the higher levels I afterwards remarked\nthat detached ’hardheads’ are puddinged into the friable laterite; but I\nnowhere found the granitic floor-rock protruding above ground. The\nboulders are treated by ditching and surrounding with a hot fire for\nforty-eight hours; cold water, not vinegar, is then poured upon them,\nand causes the heated material suddenly to contract and fracture, when\nit can easily be removed. Magnetic iron also occurs, and specimens have\nbeen sent to England; but veins have not yet been discovered.",
        "Our walk had furnished us with a tolerable idea of ’the city’s’ plan,\nwithout referring to the printed affair. Fronting north with westing, it\nis divided into squares, blocks, and insulae, after the fashion of a\nchessboard. This is one of the oldest as well as the newest mode of\ndistributions. The temples of the classical gods, being centrally\nsituated, required for general view broad, straight approaches. From\nWashington to Buenos Ayres the modern cities of the New World have\nreverted to this ancient system without other reason but a love of\nregularity and simplicity. Here the longer streets flank the sea and the\nshorter run at right angles up the inner slopes. Both are bright red\nlines worn in the vegetation between the houses. The ribbons of green\nare the American or Bahama grass; fine, silky, and creeping along the\nground, it is used to stuff mattresses, and it forms a good substitute\nfor turf. When first imported it was neglected, cut away, and nearly\nkilled out; now it is encouraged, because its velvety plots relieve the\nglaring red surface, it keeps off the ’bush,’ and it clears the surface\nof all other vegetation. Looking upon the city below, we were surprised\nto see the dilapidation of the tenements. Some have tumbled down; others\nwere tumbling down; many of those standing were lumber or board shanties\ncalled ’quarter-frames’ and ’ground-floors;’ sundry large piles rose\ngrisly and fire-charred, and the few good houses looked quite\nmodern. But what can be expected in a place where Europeans never expect\nto outstay the second year, and where Africans, who never yet worked\nwithout compulsion, cannot legally be compelled to work?",
        "We then walked up to Government House, the Fort Thornton of old charts,\nwhose roof, seen from the sea, barely tops the dense curtain of tree and\nshrubbery that girds and hangs around it. Passing under a cool and shady\navenue of mangoes and figs, and the archway, guarded by a porter’s lodge\nand a detachment of the three hundred local police, we came in sight of\nthe large, rambling residence, built piecemeal, like many an English\ncountry-house. There is little to recommend it save the fine view of the\nsea and the surrounding shrubbery-ground. I can well understand how,\nwith the immense variety of flower and fruit suddenly presented to his\neyes, the gentleman fresh from England required six months to recover\nthe free and full use of all his senses and faculties.",
        "A policeman–no longer a Zouave of the West Indian corps–took in our\ncards, and we introduced ourselves to Captain A. E. Havelock,\n’Governor-in-Chief of Sierra Leone and the Gambia.’ He is No. 47 since\nCaptain Day, R.N., first ruled in A.D. 1803. I had much to say to him\nabout sundry of his predecessors. Captain Havelock, who dates only from\n1881, has the reputation of being slightly ’black.’ The Neri and the\nBianchi factions here represent the Buffs and Blues of a land further\nnorth. He is yet in the heyday of popularity, when, in the consecrated\nphrase, the ruler ’gains golden opinions.’ But colonial judgments are\nfickle, and mostly in extremes. After this smiling season the weather\nlowers, the storm breaks, and all is elemental rage, when from being a\nmanner of demigod the unhappy ruler gradually becomes one of the\n’meanest and basest of men.’ Absit omen!",
        "We returned at sunset to Government House and spent a pleasant\nevening. The ’smokes’ had vanished, and with them the frowse and\nhomeliness of morning. The sun, with rays of lilac red, set over a\npanorama of townlet, land, and sea, to which distance added many a\ncharm. Mingling afar with the misty horizon, the nearer waters threw\nout, by their golden and silvery sheen, the headlands, capes, and\ntongues stretching in long perspective below, while the Sugarloaf,\nfather of mountains, rose in solitary grandeur high above his subject\nhills. On the nearer slope of Signal Hill we saw the first of the\ndestructive bush-burnings. They are like prairie-fires in these lands,\nand sometimes they gird Freetown with a wall of flame. Complexion is all\nin all to Sá Leone, and she showed for a few moments a truly beautiful\nprospect.",
        "The Governor has had the courage to bring out Mrs. Havelock, and she has\nhad the courage to stand firm against a rainy season. The climate is\nsimply the worst on the West Coast, despite the active measures of\nsanitation lately taken, the Department of Public Health, the ordinances\nof the Colonial Government in 1879, and the excellent water with which\nthe station is now provided. On a clear sunny day the charnel-house, I\nrepeat, is lovely, mais c’est la mort; it is the terrible beauty\nof death. Mrs. Melville says, with full truth, ’I felt amidst all the\nglory of tropic sunlight and everlasting verdure a sort of ineffable\ndread connected with the climate.’ Even when leaving the ’pestilent\nshore’ she was ’haunted by the shadowy presence.’ This is womanly, but a\nlittle reflection must suggest it to man.",
        "Even half a century ago opinions differed concerning the climate of the\ncolony. Dr. Madden could obtain only contradictory accounts. [Footnote:\nSee Wanderings in West Africa, for details, vol. i. p. 275.]\nThere is a tradition of a Chief Justice applying to the Colonial Office\nfor information touching his pension, the clerks could not answer him,\nand he presently found that none of his predecessors had lived to claim\nit. Mr. Judge Rankin was of opinion that its ill-fame was maintained by\n’policy on the one hand and by ignorance of truth on the other.’ But\nMr. Judge died a few days after. So with Dr. Macpherson, of the African\nColonial Corps. It appears ill-omened to praise the place; and, after\nrepeated visits to it, I no longer wonder that the ’Medical Gazette’ of\nApril 14, 1838, affirmed, ’No statistical writer has yet tried to give\nthe minutest fraction representing the chance of a surgeon’s return from\nSierra Leone.’",
        "On the other hand, Mrs. Falconbridge, whose husband was sent out from\nEngland on colonial business in 1791, and who wrote the first ’lady’s\nbook’ upon the Coast, pointed out at the beginning that sickness was due\nquite as much to want of care as to the climate. In 1830 Mr. John\nCormack, merchant and resident since 1800, stated to a Committee of the\nHouse of Commons that out of twenty-six Europeans in his service seven\nhad died, seven had remained in Africa, and of twelve who returned to\nEngland all save two or three were in good health. We meet with a\nmedical opinion as early as 1836 that ’not one-fourth of the deaths\nresults merely from climate.’ Cases of old residents are quoted–for\ninstance, Governor Kenneth Macaulay, a younger brother of Zachary\nMacaulay, who resisted it for twenty years; Mr. Reffall for fifteen\nyears, and sundry other exceptions.",
        "In this section of the nineteenth century it is the custom to admit that\nthe climate is bad and dangerous; but that it has often been made the\nscape-goat of European recklessness and that much of the sickness and\ndeath might be avoided. The improvement is attributed to the use of\nquinine, unknown to the early settlers, and much is expected from\nsanatoria and from planting the blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus),\nwhich failed, owing to the carelessness and ignorance of the planters. A\npractical appreciation of the improvement is shown by the Star Life\nAssurance Society, which has reduced to five per cent. its former very\nheavy rates. Lastly, the bad health of foreigners is accounted for by\nthe fact that they leave their own country for a climate to which they\nare not accustomed, where the social life and the habits of the people\nare so different from their own, and yet that they continue doing all\nthings as in England.",
        "But how stand the facts at the white man’s Red Grave? Mrs. Havelock and\nthe wife of the officer commanding the garrison are the only Europeans\nin the colony, whereas a score of years ago I remember half a\ndozen. Even the warmest apologisers for the climate will not expose\ntheir wives to it, preferring to leave them at home or in\nMadeira. During last March there were five deaths of white men–that is,\nmore than a third–out of a total of 163. What would the worst of\nEnglish colonies say to a mortality of 350 per thousand per annum? Of\ncourse we are told that it is exceptional, and the case of the insurance\nsocieties is quoted. But they forget to tell us the reason. A mail\nsteamer now calls at Freetown once a week, and the invalid is sent home\nby the first opportunity. Similarly a silly East Indian statistician\nproved, from the rare occurrence of fatal cases, Aden to be one of the\nhealthiest stations under ’the Company.’ He ignored the fact that even a\nscratch justified the surgeons in shipping a man off on sick leave.",
        "I quite agree with the view of Mr. Frederick Evans: [Footnotes: The\nColonies and India, Dec. 24, 1881.] ’Let anyone anxious to test the\nnature of the climate go to Kew Gardens and sit for a week or two in one\nof the tropical houses there; he may be assured that he will by no means\nfeel in robust health when he leaves.’ The simile is perfect. Europeans\nliving in Africa like Europeans as regards clothing and diet are, I\nbelieve, quite right. We tried grass-cloth, instead of broadcloth, in\nWestern India, when general rheumatism was the result. In the matter of\nmeat and drink the Englishman cannot do better than adhere to his old\nmode of life as much as possible, with a few small modifications. Let\nhim return to the meal-times of Queen Elizabeth’s day–",
        "and especially shun the 9 A.M. breakfast, which leads to a heavy tiffin\nat 1 P.M., the hottest and most trying section of the day. With respect\nto diet, if he drinks a bottle of claret in England let him reduce\nhimself in Africa to a pint ’cut’ with, water; if he eats a pound of\nmeat he should be contented with eight ounces and an extra quantity of\nfruit and vegetables. In medicine let him halve his cathartics and\ndouble his dose of tonics.",
        "From its topographical as well as its geographical position the climate\nof Freetown is oppressively hot, damp, and muggy. The annual mean is\n79.5° Fahr.; the usual temperature of the dwellings is from 78° to 86°\nFahr. Its year is divided into two seasons, the Dries and the Rains. The\nwet season begins in May and ends with November; for the last five years\nthe average downfall has been 155 inches, five times greater than in\nrainy England. These five months are times of extreme discomfort. The\ndamp heat, despite charcoal fires in the houses and offices, mildews\neverything–clothes, weapons, books, man himself. It seems to exhaust\nall the positive electricity of the nervous system, and it makes the\npatient feel utterly miserable. It also fills the air with noxious\nvapours during the short bursts of sunshine perpendicularly rained down,\nand breeds a hateful brood of what the Portuguese call immundicies–a\nfoul ’insect-youth.’ Only the oldest residents prefer the wet to the dry\nmonths. The Rains end in the sickliest season of the year, when the sun,\nnow getting the upper hand, sucks the miasmatic vapours from the soil\nand distributes them to mankind in the shape of ague and fever,\ndysentery, and a host of diseases. The Dries last from November to\nApril, often beginning with tornadoes and ending with the Harmatan,\nsmokes or scirocco. The climate is then not unlike Bombay, except that\nit lacks the mild East Indian attempt at a winter, and that barometric\npressure hardly varies.",
        "During my last visit to Sá Leone I secured a boat, and, accompanied by\nDr. Lovegrove, of the A.S.S. Armenian, set out to inspect the\nlower bed of the Rokel and the islands which it waters. Passing along\nFourah Bay, we remarked in the high background a fine brook, cold,\nclear, and pure, affording a delicious bath; it is almost dry in the\nDries, and swells to a fiumara during the Rains. Its extent was then a\ndiminutive rivulet tumbling some hundreds of feet down a shelving bed\ninto Granville Bay, the break beyond Fourah. On the way we passed\nseveral Timni boats, carrying a proportionately immense amount of\n’muslin.’ Of old the lords of the land, they still come down the river\nwith rice and cocoa-nuts from the Kwiah (Quiah) country, from Porto\nLoko, from Waterloo, and other places up stream. They not unfrequently\nconsole themselves for their losses by a little hard fighting; witness\ntheir defence of the Modúka stockade in 1861, when four officers and\ntwenty-three of our men were wounded. [Footnote: Wanderings in West\nAfrica, vol. i pp. 246-47.] Some of the boats are heavy row-barges\nwith a framework of sticks for a stern-awning; an old Mandenga, with\ncottony beard, sits at each helm. They row simplices munditiis.\nAt Sá Leone men are punished for not wearing overalls, and\nthus the ’city’ becomes a rag-fair. The Timni men are dark negroids\nwith the slightest infusion of Semitic blood; some had coated their\neyebrows and part of their faces with chalk for ophthalmia. They\nappeared to be merry fellows enough; and they are certainly the only men\nin the colony who ever pretend to work. A Government official harshly\nsays of them, ’I would willingly ascribe to the nearest of our\nneighbours and their representatives in Freetown, of whom there are\nmany, some virtues if they possessed any; but, unfortunately, taken as a\npeople, they have been truly described by able and observant writers as\ndishonest and depraved.’ Mr. Secretary evidently forgets the\n’civilising’ and infectious example of Sá Leone, versus the\nculture of El-Islam.",
        "Arrived at Bishopscourt, we disembarked and visited the place. Here in\nold days ’satisfaction’ was given and taken; and a satirical medico\ndeclared that forty years of rencontres had not produced a single\ncasualty. He was more witty than wise; I heard of one gentleman who had\nbeen ’paraded’ and ’winged.’ Old Granville Town, which named the bay,\nhas completely disappeared; the ruins of the last house are gone from\nthe broad grassy shelf upon which the first colonists built their homes.",
        "From Granville Bay the traveller may return by the ’Kissy Road.’ Once it\nwas the pet promenade, the Corso, the show-walk of Freetown; now it has\nbecome a Tottenham Court Road, to which Water, Oxford, and Westmoreland\nStreets are preferred. The vegetation becomes splendid, running up to\nthe feet of the hills, which swell suddenly from the shelf-plain. The\napproach to Sá Leone is heralded by a row of shops even smaller and\nmeaner than those near the market-place. There are whole streets of\nthese rabbit-hutches, whose contents ’mammy,’ when day is done, carries\nhome in a ’bly’-basket upon her head, possibly leaving ’titty’ to mount\nguard upon the remnant. The stock in trade may represent a capital of\n4l., and the profits 1s. a day. Yet ’daddy’ styles himself\nmerchant, gets credit, and spends his evenings conversing and smoking\ncigars–as a gentleman should–with his commercial friends.",
        "Passing the easternmost end of the peninsula, and sailing along the\nBullom (’lowland’) shores, we verified Dr. Blyden’s assertion that this\n’home of fevers’ shows no outward and visible sign of exceeding\nunhealthiness. The soil is sandy, the bush is comparatively thin, and\nthe tall trees give it the aspect of a high and dry land. We then turned\nnorth-east and skirted Tasso Island, a strip of river-holm girt with a\nwall of mangroves. It had an old English fort, founded in 1695; the\nfactors traded with the Pulo (Fulah) country for slaves, ivory, and\ngold. It was abandoned after being taken by Van Ruyter, when he restored\nto the Dutch West Indian Company the conquests of Commodore Holmes. The\nrich soil in 1800 supported a fine cotton plantation, and here\nMr. Heddle kept a ’factory.’ The villagers turned out to gaze, not\nhabited like the Wolofs of Albreda, but clad in shady hats and seedy\npantaloons.",
        "After clearing Tasso we advanced merrily, and at the end of two hours’\nand a half actual sailing and pulling we landed upon Bance, which some\ncall Bence’s Island. A ruined jetty with two rusty guns, buried like\nposts, projected from the sand-strip; and a battery, where nine cannon\nstill linger, defended the approach. There is a similar beach to the\nnorth-east, with admirable bathing in the tepid, brackish waves and a\nfine view of the long leonine Sierra. The outlying rocks, capped with\nguano, look like moored boats and awnings. The sea-breeze was delicious;\nthe lapping, dazzling stream made sweet music, and the huge cotton-trees\nwith laminar buttresses gave most grateful shade.",
        "The island resembles Gambian James multiplied by four or five. Behind\nthe battery are the ruins of a huge building, like the palaces of old\nGoa, vast rooms, magazines, barracoons, underground vaults, and all\nmanner of contrivances for the good comfort and entertainment of the\nslaver and the slave. A fine promenade of laterite, which everywhere\nabout Sá Leone builds the best of roads, and a strip of jungle rich in\nthe Guilandina Bonduc, whose medicinal properties are well known\nto the people, leads to the long-deserted graveyard. We pass an old well\nwith water thirty-five feet deep, and enter the enceinte, that\ncontains four tombs; the marble tablets, which would soon disappear in\nIndia for the benefit of curry-stuffs, here remain intact. One long home\nwas tenanted by ’Thomas Knight, Esquire, born in the county of Surrey,\nwho acted eighteen years as agent for the proprietors of this island,\nand who died on August 27 of 1785,’ beloved, of course, by\neverybody. Second came the ’honourable sea-Captain Hiort, born in 1746,\nmarried in 1771 to the virtuous lady Catherine Schive, and died in 1783,\nleaving two good-natured daughters, which his soul is in the hands of\nGod.’ The third was Mr. John Tittle, who departed life in 1776; and the\nlast was Captain Josiah Dory, a ’man of upright character,’ who\nmigrated to the many in 1765.",
        "Barbot (ii. 1) describes Bance’s Island as defended by a small fort on a\nsteep rock of difficult access, ascended only by a sort of stairs cut in\nthe stone, and acting as the store-house of the Royal African\nCompany. The low walls of lime and ashlar had a round ’flanker’ with\nfive guns, a curtain with embrasures for four large cannon, and a\nplatform just before it for six guns, all well mounted. The only good\nbuildings were the slave-booths. Winterbottom, who places it over\neighteen miles above St. George’s Bay (Baie de France) and north\nof Tasso Island, thus describes Bance: ’This is a small barren island\nconsiderably elevated, with a dry, gravelly soil; but being placed as it\nwere in the midst of an archipelago of low marshy islands, the breeze,\nfrom whatever quarter it blows, is impregnated with moisture and marsh\neffluvia, which render it sickly. The air also is very much heated, and\nthe thermometer generally stands 4° or 5° higher on this island than it\ndoes at Freetown.’",
        "We regained the steamer shortly after dark, delighted with our picnic\nand resolved always to take the same advantage of all halts. In those\ndays the interior was most interesting. The rivers Scarcies, Nunez, and\nPonga were unknown; the equestrian Susu tribe had never been visited;\nand, the Timbo country, the great centre whence arise the Niger, the\nRokel, and the Senegal, awaited exploration.",
