        "The reader is aware that the young king of Scots, after his escape from\nWorcester, had returned to Paris, defeated but not disgraced. The spirit\nand courage which he had displayed were taken as an earnest of future\nand more successful efforts; and the perilous adventures which he had\nencountered threw a romantic interest round the character of the royal\nexile. But in Paris he found himself without money or credit, followed by a\ncrowd of faithful dependants, whose indigence condemned them to suffer the\nmost painful privations. His mother, Henrietta, herself in no very opulent\ncircumstances, received him into her house and to her table; after the\nlapse of six months, the French king settled on him a monthly allowance\nof six thousand francs;[1] and to this were added the casual supplies\nfurnished by the loyalty of his adherents in England, and his share of the\nprizes made by the cruisers under his flag.[2] Yet, with all these aids, he",

        "Yet, poor as he was, Charles had been advised to keep up the name and\nappearance of a court. He had his lord-keeper, his chancellor of the\nexchequer, his privy councillors, and most of the officers allotted to\na royal establishment; and the eagerness of pursuit, the competition of\nintrigue with which these nominal dignities were sought by the exiles,\nfurnish scenes which cannot fail to excite the smile or the pity of an\nindifferent spectator. But we should remember that they were the only\nobjects left open to the ambition of these men; that they offered scanty,\nyet desirable, salaries to their poverty; and that they held out the\npromise of more substantial benefits on the restoration of the king, an\nevent which, however distant it might seem to the apprehension of others,\nwas always near in the belief of the more ardent royalists.[2]",

Ormond owed the distinction to\nthe lustre of his family, the princely fortune which he had lost in the\nroyal cause, his long though unsuccessful services in Ireland, and the high\nestimation in which he had been held by the late monarch. In talent and\napplication Hyde was superior to any of his colleagues. Charles I. had\nappointed him chancellor of the exchequer, and counsellor to the young\nprince; and the son afterwards confirmed by his own choice the judgment of\nhis father. Hyde had many enemies; whether it was that by his hasty and\nimperious temper he gave cause of offence, or that unsuccessful suitors,\naware of his influence with the king, attributed to his counsels the\nfailure of their petitions. But he was not wanting in his own defences; the\nintrigues set on foot to remove him from the royal ear were defeated by his\naddress; and the charges brought against him of disaffection and treachery\nwere so victoriously refuted, as to overwhelm the accuser with confusion\nand disgrace.[1]",
        "The expectations, however, which Charles had raised by his conduct in\nEngland were soon disappointed. He seemed to lose sight of his three\nkingdoms amidst the gaieties of Paris. His pleasures and amusements\nengrossed his attention; it was with difficulty that he could be drawn to\nthe consideration of business; and, if he promised to devote a few hours on\neach Friday to the writing of letters and the signature of despatches, he\noften discovered sufficient reasons to free himself from the burthen.[2]\nBut that which chiefly distressed",

This was Lucy Walters, or Barlow, the mother of a child, afterwards\nthe celebrated duke of Monmouth, of whom Charles believed himself to be\nthe father.[1] Ormond and Hyde laboured to dissolve this disgraceful\nconnection. They represented to the king the injury which it did to the\nroyal cause in England, where the appearances at least of morality were so\nhighly respected; and, after several temporary separations, they prevailed\non Walters to accept[a] an annuity of four hundred pounds, and to repair\nwith her child to her native country. But Cromwell sent her back to France;\nand she returned[b] to Paris, where by her lewdness she forfeited the royal\nfavour, and shortened her own days.

The reason alleged for this application was that the power of\nCromwell was drawing to a close, and the most tempting offers had been made\nto Charles by the Presbyterians: but the Presbyterians were the most cruel\nenemies of the Catholics, and he would not owe his restoration to them,\ntill he had sought and been refused the aid of the Catholic powers.

It is not, however, improbable that\nthese applications, with the arguments by which they were supported, had\na baneful influence on the mind of the king.

By the Spanish ministers\nthe proposal was entertained, but with their accustomed slowness. They had\nto consult the cabinet at Madrid; they were unwilling to commit themselves\nso far as to cut off all hope of reconciliation with the protector; and\nthey had already accepted the offers of another enemy to Cromwell, whose\naid, in the opinion of Don Alonzo, the late ambassador, was preferable to\nthat of the exiled king.[1]",
        "This enemy was Colonel Sexby. He had risen from the ranks to the office of\nadjutant-general in the parliamentary army; and his contempt of danger\nand enthusiasm for liberty had so far recommended him to the notice of\nCromwell, that the adjutant was occasionally honoured with a place in\nthe councils, and a share in the bed, of the lord-general. But Sexby had\nattached himself to the cause, not to the man; and his admiration, as soon\nas Cromwell apostatized from his former principles, was converted into the\nmost deadly hatred. On the expulsion of the long parliament, he joined\nWildman and the Levellers: Wildman was apprehended; but Sexby eluded the\nvigilance of the",

In the month of May,\n1655, he repaired to the court at Brussels. To the archduke and the count\nof Fuensaldagna, he revealed[a] the real object of the secret expedition\nunder Venables and Penn; and offered the aid of the English Levellers for\nthe destruction of a man, the common enemy of the liberties of his country\nand of the rights of Spain. They were a numerous and determined band of\npatriots; they asked no other aid than money and the co-operation of the\nEnglish and Irish troops in the Spanish service; and they were ready, for\nsecurity, to deliver a strong maritime fortress into the hands of their\nallies. Fuensaldagna hesitated to give a positive answer before an actual\nrupture had taken place; and at his recommendation Sexby proceeded\nto Madrid. At first he was received with coldness; but the news from\nHispaniola established his credit; the value of his information was now\nacknowledged; he obtained the sum of forty thousand crowns for the use of\nhis party, and an assurance was given that, as soon as they should be in\npossession of the port which he had named, six thousand men should sail[b]\nfrom Flanders to their assistance. Sexby returned to Antwerp, transmitted\nseveral large sums to his adherents, and, though Cromwell at length\nobtained information of the intrigue, though the last remittance of eight\nhundred pounds had been seized, the intrepid Leveller crossed over[c] to\nEngland, made his arrangements with his associates, and returned[d] in\nsafety to the continent.[1]",

Sexby declared[b] that he had no\nobjection to a limited monarchy, provided it were settled by a free\nparliament. He believed that his friends would have none; but he advised\nthat, at the commencement of the attempt, the royalists should make no\nmention of the king, but put forth as their object the destruction of the\nusurper and the restoration of public liberty. Charles, on the other hand,\nwas willing to make use of the services of Sexby; but he did not believe\nthat his means were equal to his professions, and he saw reason to infer,\nfrom the advice which he had given, that his associates were enemies to\nroyalty.[1]",
        "The negotiation between the king and the Spanish ministers began to alarm\nboth Cromwell and Mazarin. The cardinal anticipated the defection of the\nBritish and Irish regiments in the French service; the protector foresaw\nthat they would probably be employed in a descent upon England. It was\nresolved to place the duke of York in opposition to his brother. That\nyoung prince had served with his regiment during four campaigns, under\nthe Marshal Turenne; his pay as colonel, and his pension of six thousand\npistoles, amply provided for his wants; and his bravery in the field had\ngained him the esteem of the general, and rendered him the idol of his\ncountrymen.

He obeyed; his departure[a] was followed by the resignation of\nmost of the British and Irish officers in the French army; and, in many\ninstances, the men followed the example of their leaders. Defeated in this\ninstance, Cromwell and Mazarin had recourse to another intrigue, of which\nthe secret springs are concealed from our sight. It was insinuated by some\npretended friend to Don Juan, the new governor of the Netherlands, that\nlittle reliance was to be placed on James, who was sincerely attached to\nFrance, and governed by Sir John Berkeley, the secret agent of the French\ncourt, and the known enemy of Hyde and his party. In consequence, the real\ncommand of the royal forces was given to Marsin, a foreigner; an oath of\nfidelity to Spain was, with the consent of Charles, exacted[b] from the\nofficers and soldiers; and in a few days James was first requested and then\ncommanded[c] by his brother to dismiss Berkeley. The young prince did not\nrefuse; but he immediately followed[d] Berkeley into Holland with the\nintention of passing through Germany into France. His departure was hailed\nwith joy by Cromwell, who wrote a congratulatory letter to Mazarin on the\nsuccess of this intrigue; it was an object of dismay to Charles, who by\nmessengers entreated and commanded[e] James to return. At Breda, the prince\nappeared to hesitate. He soon afterwards retraced his steps to Bruges, on\na promise that the past should be forgotten; Berkeley followed; and the\ntriumph of the fugitives was completed by the elevation of the obnoxious\nfavourite to the peerage.[1]",

There were the\npapists and Cavaliers, who had already risen, and were again ready to rise\nin favour of Charles Stuart. There were the Levellers, who had sent an\nagent to the court of Madrid, and the Fifth-monarchy-men, who sought an\nunion with the Levellers against him, “a reconciliation between Herod and\nPilate, that Christ might be put to death.” The remedies–though in this\npart of his speech he digressed so frequently as to appear loth to come to\nthe remedies–were, to prosecute the war abroad, and strengthen the hands\nof the government at home; to lose no time in questions of inferior moment,\nor less urgent necessity, but to inquire into the state of the revenue, and\nto raise ample supplies.",

Some there\nwere who pretended that king and chief magistrate were synonymous; but\nno one had yet ventured to substitute one word for the other in the\nScriptures, where so many covenants, promises, and precepts are annexed to\nthe title of king.

The two houses\nof parliament were restored; but, as if it were meant to allude to his\npast conduct, he was bound to leave to the House of Commons the right of\nexamining the qualifications and determining the claims of the several\nrepresentatives.

The yearly revenue was fixed at one million three\nhundred thousand pounds, of which no part was to be raised by a land-tax;\nand of this sum one million was devoted to the support of the army and\nnavy, and three hundred thousand pounds to the expenses of the civil list;\nbut, on the remonstrance of the protector, that with so small a revenue it\nwould be impossible to continue the war, an additional grant of six\nhundred thousand pounds was voted for the three following years.

        "between France and England was renewed for another year; three thousand\nmen, drafted from different regiments, were sent by the protector to supply\nthe deficiency in the number of his forces; and the combined army opened\nthe campaign with the siege of Dunkirk. By the Spaniards the intelligence\nwas received with surprise and apprehension. Deceived by false information,\nthey had employed all their efforts to provide for the safety of Cambray.\nThe repeated warnings given by Charles had been neglected; the extensive\nworks at Dunkirk remained in an unfinished state; and the defence of the\nplace had been left to its ordinary garrison of no more than one thousand\nmen, and these but scantily supplied with stores and provisions. To repair\nhis error, Don Juan, with the consent of his mentor, the Marquess Caracena,\nresolved to hazard a battle; and, collecting a force of six thousand\ninfantry and four thousand cavalry, encamped between the village of Zudcote\nand the lines of the besiegers. But Turenne, aware of the defective\norganization of the Spanish armies, resolved to prevent the threatened\nattack; and the very next morning, before the Spanish cannon and ammunition\nhad reached the camp, the allied force was seen advancing in battle array.\nDon Juan hastily placed his men along a ridge of sand-hills which extended\nfrom the sea coast to the canal, giving the command of the right wing to\nthe duke of York, of the left to the prince of Condé, and reserving\nthe centre to himself. The battle was begun by the English, who found\nthemselves opposed to their countryman, the duke of York. They were led\nby Major-General Morgan; for Lockhart, who acted both as ambassador and\ncommander-in-chief, was confined by indisposition to his carriage. Their\nardour to distinguish themselves in the presence of the two rival nations\ncarried them considerably in advance of their allies; but, having halted\nto gain breath at the foot of the opposite sand-hill, they mounted with\nimpetuosity, received the fire of the enemy, and, at the point of the pike,\ndrove them from their position. The duke immediately charged at the head\nof the Spanish cavalry; but one half of his men were mowed down by a\nwell-directed fire of musketry; and James himself owed the preservation of\nhis life to the temper of his armour. The advantage, however, was dearly\npurchased: in Lockhart’s regiment scarcely an officer remained to take the\ncommand.",
        "By this time the action had commenced on the left, where the prince of\nCondé, after some sharp fighting, was compelled to retreat by the bank of\nthe canal. The centre was never engaged; for the regiment, on its\nextreme left, seeing itself flanked by the French in pursuit of Condé,\nprecipitately abandoned its position, and the example was successively\nimitated by the whole line. But, in the meanwhile, the duke of York had\nrallied his broken infantry, and while they faced the English, he charged\nthe latter in flank at the head of his company of horse-guards. Though\nthrown into disorder, they continued to fight, employing the butt-ends of\ntheir muskets against the swords of their adversaries, and in a few minutes\nseveral squadrons of French cavalry arrived to their aid. James was\nsurrounded; and, in despair of saving himself by flight, he boldly assumed\nthe character of a French officer; rode at the head of twenty troopers\ntoward the right of their army; and, carefully threading the different\ncorps, arrived without exciting suspicion at the bank of the canal, by\nwhich he speedily effected his escape to Furnes.[1] The victory on the part\nof the allies was complete. The Spanish cavalry made no effort to protect\nthe retreat of their infantry; every regiment of which was successively\nsurrounded by the pursuers, and compelled to surrender. By Turenne and his\nofficers the chief merit of this brilliant success was cheerfully allotted\nto the courage and steadiness of the English regiments; at Whitehall it was\nattributed to the prayers of the lord-protector, who, on that very day,\nobserved with his council a solemn fast to implore the blessing of heaven\non the operations of the allied army.[2]",

At home he had discovered,\ndefeated, and punished all the conspiracies against him; abroad, his army\nhad gained laurels in the field; his fleets swept the seas; his friendship\nwas sought by every power; and his mediation was employed in settling the\ndifferences between both Portugal and Holland, and the king of Sweden\nand the elector of Brandenburg.

Though the last parliament had made\nprovision, ample provision, as it was then thought, for the splendour of\nhis establishment, and for all the charges of the war, he had already\ncontracted enormous debts; his exchequer was frequently drained to the last\nshilling; and his ministers were compelled to go a-begging–such is the\nexpression of the secretary of state–for the temporary loan of a few\nthousand pounds, with the cheerless anticipation of a refusal.[1] He\nlooked on the army, the greater part of which he had quartered in the\nneighbourhood of the metropolis, as his chief–his only support against his\nenemies; and while the soldiers were comfortably clothed and fed, he might\nwith confidence rely on their attachment; but now that their pay was in\narrear, he had reason to apprehend that discontent might induce them to\nlisten to the suggestions of those officers who sought to subvert his\npower. On former occasions, indeed, he had relieved himself from similar\nembarrassments by the imposition of taxes by his own authority; but this\npractice was so strongly reprobated in the petition and advice, and he had\nrecently abjured it with so much solemnity, that he dared not repeat\nthe experiment. He attempted to raise a loan among the merchants and\ncapitalists in the city; but his credit and popularity were gone; he had,\nby plunging into",

But Cromwell, like the first Charles, had learned to dread\nthe very name of a parliament. Three of these assemblies he had moulded\naccording to his own plan, and yet not one of them could he render\nobsequious to his will. Urged, however, by the ceaseless importunities of\nThurloe, he appointed[a] nine councillors to inquire into the means of\ndefeating the intrigues of the republicans in a future parliament; the\nmanner of raising a permanent revenue from the estates of the royalists;\nand the best method of determining the succession to the protectorate.

In his public speeches, he perpetually reminded them that, if\nreligion was not the original cause of the late civil war, yet, God “soon\nbrought it to that issue;” that amidst the strife of battle, and the\ndifficulties and dangers of war, the reward to which they looked was\nfreedom of conscience; that this freedom to its full extent they enjoyed\nunder his government, though they could never obtain it till they had\nplaced the supreme authority in his hands.[1] The merit which he thus\narrogated to himself was admitted to be his due by the great body of the\nsaints; it became the spell by which he rendered them blind to his ambition\nand obedient to his will; the engine with which he raised, and afterwards\nsecured, the fabric of his greatness.",
        "On the subject of civil freedom, the protector could not assume so bold\na tone. He acknowledged, indeed, its importance; it was second only to\nreligious freedom; but if second, then, in the event of competition, it\nought to yield to the first. He contended that, under his government, every\nprovision had been made for the preservation of the rights of individuals,\nso far as was consistent with the safety of the whole nation. He had\nreformed the Chancery, he had laboured to abolish the abuses of the law, he\nhad placed learned and upright judges on the bench, and he had been careful\nin all ordinary cases that impartial justice should be administered between\nthe parties. This indeed was true; but it was also true that by his orders\nmen were arrested and committed without lawful cause; that juries\nwere packed; that prisoners, acquitted at their trial, were sent into\nconfinement beyond the",

        "Some writers have maintained that Cromwell dissembled in religion as well\nas in politics; and that, when he condescended to act the part of the\nsaint, he assumed for interested purposes a character which he otherwise\ndespised. But this supposition is contradicted by the uniform tenor of his\nlife. Long before he turned his attention to the disputes between the king\nand the parliament, religious enthusiasm had made a deep impression on his\nmind;[2] it continually manifested itself during his long career, both in\nthe senate and the field; and it was strikingly displayed in his speeches\nand prayers on the last evening of his",

If he believed that the cause in which he had embarked\nwas the cause of God, he also believed that God had chosen him to be the\nsuccessful champion of that cause. Thus the honour of God was identified\nwith his own advancement, and the arts, which his policy suggested, were\nsanctified in his eyes by the ulterior object at which he aimed–the\ndiffusion of godliness, and the establishment of the reign of Christ among\nmankind.[1]",
