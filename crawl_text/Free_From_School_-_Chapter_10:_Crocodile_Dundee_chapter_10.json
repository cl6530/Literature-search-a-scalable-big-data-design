        "December was the most eagerly awaited month of my one year sabbatical.\nAll decks had finally been cleared for my long awaited trip to the\nCrocodile Bank at Mamallapuram. Nearly three months earlier my dad had\nwritten to Romulus Whitaker the legendary snakeman who now runs the\nCroc Bank asking whether I could spend some time there. There had been\nno reply largely because Rom travels quite a bit but also because, as I\ndiscovered, writing replies to letters is about the last thing these\nanimal-dedicated persons have time for.",
        "I was in fact beginning to feel quite frustrated thinking that my trip\nwould not work out when Srilata Swaminadhan (with whom we stayed in\nJaipur) told my father that her sister lived at Mamallapuram and would\nhelp out. Phone calls back and forth and finally it was all organised.\nI was overjoyed when my dad’s phone call came to Uncle Mano’s house\nsaying I could go.",
        "Babu, Uncle Mano’s nephew, reached me by bus to the Croc Bank on the\n9th of December and I spent one glorious month there, the nearest I got\nto living in the wild. Although I was supposed to return home for\nChristmas I begged to be let off and was in the seventh heaven when my\nparents agreed. In fact I enjoyed my stay so much, that in March, I\nreturned to the Croc Bank again (for a brief while), as that was the\nbreeding season for crocodiles.",
        "The Croc Bank is situated at Mamallapuram which is about 37 kms from\nChennai. It is a huge place with a beach just behind it.",
        "Croc Bank is home to thousands of crocodiles, all of them housed in\npits of varying sizes with sloping walls to enable water to collect at\nthe centre so that the crocs can sunbathe on the upper part of the\nslopes. Some of the huge crocodiles have individual pits but usually\nthe species is kept separately, male and female further separated from\neach other. A large enclosure divided into several sections houses the\nbaby crocs.",
        "In addition to crocodiles, snakes also have a significant position at\nCroc Bank for snakes were Director Romulus Whitaker’s first love, and\nhe is still known as the Snakeman, having founded Madras Snake Park\nseveral years ago. There is, in fact, a big snake pit at the Croc Bank,\nin which various kinds of snakes are kept. Here, snake venom is\nextracted from the snakes by the Irulas. There is a separate fee for\nvisitors for entering the snake area. While the poisonous snakes are\nkept in pots in a snake room, the King Cobras, of course, have special\nseparate rooms.",
        "Croc Bank also has enclosures and pits for various kinds of turtles and\nlarge aquariums with fish in them.",
        "At one end of the campus is the library, well stocked with books and\nmagazines on all these creatures. Adjacent to it are the residential\nquarters of researchers and guests (there were mainly foreigners at the\ntime I was there) who come to stay at Croc Bank from time to time. The\nresidential quarters are quite simple but comfortable. Each room has a\nbed, desk and table, and an attached bath and toilet. I occupied one of\nthese rooms during my stay here.",
        "The Irula families live in a separate area close to where the Snake\npits are located. The permanent staff which includes the Director,\nDeputy Directory and others have their own individual houses located in\nvarious places within the Croc Bank.",
        "During my stay I became good friends with many of the people at the\nCroc Bank including the six foot tall Director, Romulus Whitaker, whom\neveryone calls Rom; his wife, Zai Whitaker; their sons Samir and\nNikhil; Harry Andrews, the Deputy Director who hails from Kerala;\nRomaine, his wife and their son Tharak, Gerry the snake-catcher from\nBangalore and many others.",
        "My stay at Croc bank was exciting throughout and I learnt a lot. For\nthe first few days, I was given my first assignment i.e., treating a\n2-foot long turtle with infected skin. I used to apply ointment to its\nfeet and then put on some bandage. The next day, before repeating the\ntreatment, I had to feed the turtle with cabbage in water.",
        "From turtles, I moved to big lizards i.e. monitor lizards and Green\nIguanas. The Green Iguana I handled was quite big-about the size of an\naverage dachshund. His tail measured two to three times the length of\nhis body if not more. From head to tail, he must have been about two\nand a half metres long. But he had been in captivity for so long that\nhe was very friendly, though he had sharp claws and a spiny back and\nhead. Sometimes, when I used to guide special guests around, I would\ntake him out so that they could have a feel of his sandpapery skin. I\nwas surprised when Harry, the deputy director, told me the Iguana was\nas old as I was.",
        "Sometimes, I also handled monitor lizards. They were very strong, had\nsharp claws and a very bad bite. Every time I jumped into the pit to\nhandle them they would rush into the water. I soon learned to be quick\nenough, and would get them before they could reach the water. Once they\nwere cornered they would whip their tails about and inflate their\nnecks, hissing dangerously. Of course, you had a few of them running up\ntrees and then you couldn’t do anything about it. I soon discovered\nthat though it looked scarier, it was easier to catch them in the\nwater.",
        "The croc bank is filled with pits. Each of these pits is an enclosure\nvarying in size, depending on the size and type of reptile, and the\nnumber of them in it. Every pit has a pond of sorts filled with water\nfor the reptiles to swim in or to drink. Most of the crocodile pits\nwere bare, but the monitor lizard pits were usually filled with trees\nwhich they could climb to the highest branches. The branch ends were\nkept within the range of the pits so that the monitor lizards did not\nget out by trying to climb other trees or jumping out from the high\nbranches.",
        "The ponds of the monitor lizards were almost waist deep with dark murky\nwater and you had to feel around until you touched the head, leg or\nbody of the monitor (they are less likely to bite in water). Then I\nwould feel around till I got the tail, slowly lift it to the surface\nand grab the neck under the water. Their necks were so huge that I\ncould hardly get my fingers round them. On land, catching them by\ngrabbing the tail was much faster, but one had to avoid the biting head\nby quickly grabbing the neck.",
        "Once, when the Croc Bank staff wanted to get some monitors down from\nthe trees, they just took a long stick and pushed them over from the\nheight of almost a two storey building. They fell on the ground but\nsuffered no damage and just continued running around. I recall the day\nGerry challenged Nikhil “the bodybuilder” to pull a monitor lizard that\nwas half out of a burrow. At first he thought the monitor’s tail would\nbreak but though he tugged with all his might his rippling muscles\ncouldn’t move an inch of the monitor.",
        "In the mornings, I helped the workers clean the croc pits, a task which\nI thoroughly enjoyed. We would jump into the pits with big sticks and\nchase all the crocs into the water. Then we would clean out the croc\nshit and the left overs of their food which included a lot of bones.\nThis exercise was usually done with a male worker first chasing the\ncrocs into the water. Then the remaining 3 to 4 women would help with\nbrooms, baskets and spades. Occasionally, we would have a crocodile\nwanting us to get out of his pit instead. No matter how hard you hit\nhim on his nose he would chase you around until he would finally give\nin, so to speak, and dash into the water with a big splash or\nsometimes, glide gracefully to where he could join his friends who\nsometimes numbered a thousand! (The Croc Bank had around seven thousand\ncrocs at the time I was there.)",
        "I also had occasion to participate a few times in the operations\ninvolved in shifting crocodiles from one location to another. That was\nquite an adventure in itself!",
        "One day Rom and Harry decided to shift the largest male Gharial in the\nCroc Bank from one pit to another as it had broken its upper jaw in a\nfight with another male during the previous breeding season.",
        "Normally you try to catch a croc by throwing a sort of a small anchor\nin and when the croc latches on to it you try and pull it out. Once it\nis out, about 10-15 people quickly jump and sit on it. (That’s the only\nway to prevent a croc from getting back into water!). With its mouth\nbound by rubber bands, the croc is then rolled onto a ladder, bound to\nit, lifted and carried to the pit that it has to be transferred to. An\naverage adult croc is about 250 kg and about two to three metres long.\nIt takes 15-20 people to carry it.",
        "Once it is released in the pool the ropes and rubber bands are removed\nand the last unfortunate or brave man, depending on how you look at it,\nmakes a run for his life over the edge of the pond onto the safety of\ndry land.",
        "As we were transferring the male Gharial into a female mugger pit,\nHarry jokingly yelled: “What do you think we will get-a Ghammer?” Of\ncourse crocs only mate with others of their own species and there is no\nway a Gharial and mugger will get together. We were in fact\ntransferring the male here in order to give it a period of rest and\nrecovery from fighting with other males.",
        "Another time the exercise was because `Jaws III’ needed female company.\nJaws III is the biggest captive salt water crocodile in India. He is\nabout 16 feet and ranks may be, 3rd or 4th in the world in terms of his\nlength. Therefore, after Part II of `The Great White Man-eating Shark’\nwas produced, called Jaws II, the Croc Bank rightly decided to name its\ncrocodile `Jaws III’.",
        "Jaws III was a loner and would kill anything including other crocs\nwhich fell into his pit. So he lived a lonely, if majestic life.\nWhenever we jumped into his pit to clean it he would come charging at\nus even if he was in the water. He seemed to give us more exercise than\nall of us put together gave him. Anyway, the Croc Bank, after ten\nyears, finally felt it was time to find a him bride. Since he had on\nmore than one occasion bashed his head against a wall sensing a female\nin the opposite pit, we knew he was ready!",
        "The first female we caught was about to be thrown into his pit when I\nasked to examine her. (I had just learnt how to sex them). I began to\nfeel inside the crocodile and felt a hemipenis! “It’s a male,” I\nshouted. “Can’t be,” said Gerry, “let me check.” After a few seconds\nthere was a reassuring nod from Gerry: “Yes, Rom, it’s a male!”",
        "“Rahul, Champion Sexer,” cried Gerry.",
        "One cannot tell if crocs are male or female by their outward\nappearance. So, at the Croc Bank, after crocs grow to a certain length\nthey are sexed and markings are made on their scales. But workers can\nsometimes make mistakes while sexing small crocs. That’s perhaps how\nthe error occurred with the first bride we got for Jaws. I can’t\nimagine the plight of the poor chap had he been put in the pit with\nJaws. He would have been turned into minced meat in minutes.",
        "After that episode we physically examined every supposed female we\ncaught to be doubly sure of not making any error and found that most of\nthe supposed females turned out to be males! By then, most of the crocs\nhad run into the deepest part of the pond and we had hardly any crocs\nto choose a female from. Rom suggested chasing the females out of the\nwater onto the land, but that’s not easy at all. So he came up with\nanother idea.",
        "We got some iron gates and tied them together with a thick mesh net\nover it all. Then we had to wade into the green water with the net in\nfront of us. This would effectively push the crocs from the deep water\nonto the land. But the best of plans can go haywire and, instead, the\nreverse started happening. The crocs from the land started coming into\nthe water colliding with those being driven out by us. Thereafter there\nwas general commotion in the water and all the crocs started thrashing\nabout. One almost got my neighbour’s hand. I could feel the crocs at my\nfeet through the iron mesh that I held grimly onto. However we finally\naccomplished our dangerous mission and when we had driven a sufficient\nnumbers onto the land we were able to select a female for Jaws.",
        "Imagine Jaws’ surprise when he saw a companion after all those years.\nShe was exactly half his size in length and width. Perhaps he was just\nvery excited or maybe it was due to a normal state of male aggression,\nwe don’t know, because he just caught the hapless female croc between\nhis huge jaws and thrashed her about. “Croc barbecue is delicious”,\nsaid Tharak expecting the poor creature to perish any moment.\nFortunately or unfortunately, his wish was not fulfilled. The female\nsurvived although with quite a few bloody marks. Thereafter she kept\nher distance from the water as any sane creature would, avoiding Jaws\nlike the plague.",
        "Much later, when I visited Croc Bank a second time, it was the breeding\nseason and there were a few nests to be excavated everyday. Each nest\nwould occupy about the space of a medium size basket. Each egg was at\nleast three times the size of a hen’s egg and they usually numbered\naround 30 to 35. Every female-and each one of these measured from about\n2 m to 3.5 m-would determinedly guard her nest, refusing to budge when\nwe tried to chase her into the water in order to clean the pit.",
        "There is now a problem of excess population of the mugger crocodiles\nat the Croc Bank partly because they breed twice as much at the croc\nbank compared to in the wild and also due to their high survival rate.\nIn the wild, at the most, one or two survive out of the 30-35 eggs as\nmany are lost to predators, etc., but here due to artificial\nincubation, special enclosures, etc., a large number tend to survive.\nTherefore the croc bank has stopped all breeding of this species which\nmeant that we had a surfeit of eggs for breakfast! We used to scramble\nthe salty eggs and finish them off with sauce, although a larger number\nused to be sent raw for the monitor lizards’ breakfast.",
        "I sometimes went snake hunting with the Irulas. The Irulas are tribals\nthat are expert at snake catching. They formerly caught snakes for the\nsnake skin industry. After the ban, they went out of business and found\nit difficult to make a living because they did not own land and did not\nknow how to cultivate fields or do any trade at all. After the croc\nbank opened they were back in the business they excelled in, but this\ntime it was to save people and snakes with snake venom extraction.",
        "Carrying only a crowbar and a few cloth bags, they would set out,\noverturning every bush and digging any hole that showed signs of a\nsnake in it. Their crowbar had three uses, namely: (1) to shine light\ninto the burrow; (2) to dig the hole and (3) to handle the snake.\nDuring my outings with the dark, short, curly haired snake hunters, we\ncaught striped keelbacks, ratsnakes and also black scorpions.",
        "Apart from snakes the Irulas also caught rats. These rats, which\ndestroy crops and fields, build their burrows within the bunds. After\ncatching the rats, the Irulas would take away the rice which the rats\nhad stowed away and cook it to eat with the field rat meat. These\noutings were long, hot and tiring but I found them nonetheless\nenjoyable.",
        "The Irulas also taught me a lot about snake handling. I learnt to\nhandle the four poisonous snakes of India (the “Big Four”, i.e. Cobras,\nCommon Kraits, Russel’s Vipers, Saw-scaled Vipers) and also Pit Vipers\nand Pythons.",
        "Snakes were kept in mud pots that were placed in the snake room (no\ndifferent from an ordinary bedroom). Outside, a board merely announced:\n`Danger: Snakes Loose’. This was done to discourage intruders. But\nreally speaking, snakes were let loose only under supervision. There\nwas a small canal of water outside to prevent ants from entering the\nroom. (You may not believe it but ants can reduce a snake to a\nskeleton.) Next, there was a little space outside the room and about 1\nto 2 metres after, a smooth wall, about a metre high. I used to remove\nthe snakes from their pots, put them to drink water in the canal and\nthen clean the pots. During this exercise I would take the opportunity\nto improve my skills at handling the snakes. Basically one has to hold\nthe tail with one hand and control the snake using the snake hook (a\nlong stick with an iron hook at the end) with the other.",
        "Bites! That’s practically the first question anyone asks me when I talk\nof my croc bank vacation. Did I get bitten? Yes, several times, mostly\nby accident. But sometimes I allowed myself to be bitten just for the\nheck of it. I recall once when a ratsnake gave me a bite on the nose. I\ntried to prevent Rom seeing it but he found out soon enough by the\nblood on my shirt. A bite from a ratsnake is not painful but it bleeds\nlike a leaking tap. “Don’t worry, Rahul,” Rom said cheerfully, “the\nvenom will not take effect for another half an hour.” (Ratsnakes are\nnon-poisonous.)",
        "Another time I was getting a picture taken of myself with a baby\ncrocodile when it turned round and bit me. That was quite bad! Imagine\na sawing machine running over your hand. But I was cool, and happy that\nI had been bitten by a crocodile!",
        "Then I was dumb enough to try the bite of a wall lizard that Gerry had\ncaught to feed to his pit vipers. The scar, still on my hand, reminds\nme also of the chequered keelback bite I got in Pune (the one which got\nso bad that I couldn’t wear my watch for a few days).",
        "And on the last day of my stay at Croc Bank the red-eared turtle which\nI was taking away as my gift and souvenir from Croc Bank bit me so bad\nthat I could see my flesh and I could barely use my hand for a few\ndays.",
        "Now when I look back I think I was collecting bites in much the same\nway that some people collect trophies. Although this may appear quite a\nfoolish thing to do and perhaps it was too (some of the bites were\nquite painful), one good thing did come out of all those bites. I have\nno paranoid fear of such bites any longer. I am very careful when I\nhandle reptiles and take all the precautions that I have been taught\nbut I know that I would not be terror stricken should I get bitten and\nwould know what remedial steps to take.",
        "Apart from my practical studies, there was a huge library at the Croc\nBank where I would browse through several books on crocs, snakes,\nmonitors, turtles, the works. It was always with great pleasure that I\nwould search for information about something that I had learnt or seen\nthat day. And the best part is that although I didn’t have to memorize\nthe facts for any examination, nothing of what I read has gone out of\nmy head.",
        "And then, there was always time for fun. Sometimes I would go to\nHarry’s house where Tharaq and I played music or recorded songs. Other\ntimes, I would watch a movie at Rom’s. There was time for barbecues of\nfield rats, froglegs, frankfurters, parrot fish, chicken and beef,\nrounded off with chocolate cake. The beach at the back was for swimming\nduring the day and catching crabs during the night.",
        "One of the interesting happenings at the time that I was there was the\narrival of a film team from the magazine National Geographic to film\nthe King Cobras at the Bank. I became one of the many hands-on they had\nfor the job: I would assist in various ways like holding the flash,\nhelping with the setting up of shots, catching and re-catching the\nfrogs as they scampered off during the numerous retakes.",
        "One lazy afternoon Tharaq suggested a haircut for me. My hair was by\nthen really long. In fact I had not put a scissor to it since the\nbeginning of my sabbatical. So now it stood nearly at shoulder length.\nHe told me he had one and a half months’ experience in hair cutting. I\nwas thus persuaded to take up his offer of a “free” haircut in the\n“latest style”.",
        "I explained in great detail to Tharaq how I wanted it cut and he\nnodded attentively making a few suggestions here and there. Then he\nstarted to work with the scissors, cutting and shaving here and there.\nWhen he announced that he had finished he produced a mirror and I\nlooked into the face of an unrecognisable Rahul with a hairstyle of\ntriangles sitting amidst shaved parts and a long strand of hair in the\nfront. I looked crazier than any rock star! It was only then that I\nlearnt that Tharaq did not know the ABC of haircutting, much less\nhairstyling and that he had just had a great time experimenting on my\nhead.",
        "Anyway I decided that now was a good time to try out the “bald look\"\nand so I got to a proper barber and had my hair shaved off completely.\nIt was truly liberating. I took several pictures of myself at this time\nwith the reptiles at the croc bank to remember my days here and also to\nrecord for posterity my new look.",
        "I felt truly sorry when it was time for me to leave Croc Bank. I\npromised everyone that I’d be back soon. I carried a souvenir with me-a\nred-eared turtle (which I still have) and some turtle eggs.",
        "I travelled through the night on a bus to Bangalore. At my foot was the\nturtle in a box and I had left a small opening for her to breathe.\nSuddenly I noticed that the turtle was out and was already making for\nthe door of the bus. I quickly caught her and put her back without any\nof the sleeping passengers noticing it except for a dear old lady who\nsmiled and said, “Dropped your water bottle, son?”",
        "Field Work Notes:\nCrocodiles",
        "Living millions of years before man, but today facing extinction...with\nmany myths about them and very little known about their nature. Many\nare considered dangerous. None are considered useful. Who are these\ncreatures? They are called crocodiles, alligators and lizards.",
        "There are 21 species of crocodiles and alligators in the world.",
        "Three species of crocodiles are found in India, namely:",
        "1) the Gharials-which are fish-eating crocodiles;",
        "2) the Muggers; and",
        "3) the Salt-water crocodiles.",
        "The biggest and the most dangerous of all crocodiles in the world is\nthe salt water crocodile, which can grow upto 25 feet. It is the only\ncrocodile that can live in the sea for a long time. The Nile crocodile\nof Africa is yet another deadly species. Fossils of three other extinct\nspecies of crocodiles have also been found in India.",
        "These cold blooded animals have evolved with dinosaurs millions of\nyears ago and are more closely related to birds than to snakes or\nreptiles. Being cold blooded they control their body temperature by\nseeking shady, sunny spots or different levels in water. They often\nbask with their jaws open, which probably helps them to keep cool.",
        "Their eyes, nose and ears are positioned in a straight line along with\nhead and snout. They have good eyesight and a good sense of smell, and\ncan hear very well. Their tail is very strong and helps them in\nswimming. They have a very low metabolic rate and thus need to hunt\nonly every few days. They can decrease their metabolic rate and stay\nunder water for a long time. Alligators have been known to stay under\nwater for upto 6 hours. They do not make any unnecessary movements but\ncan move very fast even on land when necessary. Small salties can\ngallop at a speed of 48 kph for short distances.",
        "Crocodiles are found in large and small rivers, lakes, mangroves, and\nin brackish and fresh water. When a baby crocodile hatches, it is just\nabout three quarters of a foot (25-30 cms) in length. In a few years it\nmatures into an adult. Maturity depends upon size rather than on age.\nGenerally males mature slower than females.",
        "In the wild, a female will take between 5-7 years to mature whereas\nmales will take 9-11 years. Gharials take longer to mature; about 8-10\nyears for the female and 12 years for the male. In captivity, such as\nin the Madras Crocodile Bank, females mature in four years and males in\nfive.",
        "The average size for maturity for a Mugger is-male (2 metres) and\nfemale (1.6 metres). Males of Gharials and Salties mature at three and\na half metres and females at three metres.",
        "Mugger crocodiles breed in between February and April. Salties breed in\nApril and Gharials between the last week of March to the second week of\nApril.",
        "Breeding depends on environmental conditions. In the breeding season\nmales often fight for the right to court with several females. During\ncourtship each pair may blow bubbles, rub noses, raise their snout and\nperiodically submerge and re-emerge. Different species show different\ncourtship displays. Gharials, for example, often court each other by\nmaking a loud buzzing sound. Mating occurs under water with the male\nmounted on top of the female.",
        "The average gestation period is between 35-60 days. The gestation for a\nMugger is 35-40 days and for Gharials and Salties, 40-65 days. The\ntemperature at which eggs are incubated and the moisture content of the\nenvironment (humidity) influence the sex within the embryo.",
        "Crocodiles will either dig a hole about 30 cms deep or pile up leaves\nto incubate their eggs. They sometime splash water on the nest to\ncontrol the temperature. In mugger crocs, females are exclusively\nproduced at constant temperature of 28¡C through 31¡C. At 32.5¡C only\nmales are produced. Both sexes in varying proportion are produced at\n31.5 to 33¡C.",
        "The female guards the nest. At the time of hatching the young start\ncroaking so the mother (sometimes even the father) digs open the nest.\nThen she cracks some of the eggs with her teeth to set free the young\nand carries them to the water in her mouth. The adult crocodiles\ncontinue to guard the young until they are about 5-7 months old.",
        "Crocodiles have many uses in nature’s ecosystem. They help keep the\nenvironment clean by eating the carcasses that would otherwise rot.\nThey capture the diseased, wounded and weaker prey thus letting only\nthe strongest survive and thus maintaining a healthy population and\nkeeping up the genetic quality of their prey species.",
        "In the dry season, wallows and tunnels dug by crocs provide essential\nwater for other animals, turtles and fish. Many animals depend upon\ncrocs for food for e.g. the sacred Ibis and monitor lizard will eat the\neggs of the Nile crocodile. Crocs are also exceptionally resistant to\ndisease and thus may be of great use in medical research.",
