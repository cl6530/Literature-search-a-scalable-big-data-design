        "  They were standing under a tree, each with an arm round the\nother’s neck, and Alice knew which was which in a moment, because\none of them had ’DUM’ embroidered on his collar, and the other\n’DEE.’  ’I suppose they’ve each got “TWEEDLE” round at the back\nof the collar,’ she said to herself.",
        "  They stood so still that she quite forgot they were alive,\nand she was just looking round to see if the word “TWEEDLE” was\nwritten at the back of each collar, when she was startled by a\nvoice coming from the one marked ’DUM.’",
        "",
        "  ’If you think we’re wax-works,’ he said, ’you ought to pay, you\nknow.  Wax-works weren’t made to be looked at for nothing, nohow!’",
        "  ’Contrariwise,’ added the one marked ’DEE,’ ’if you think we’re\nalive, you ought to speak.’",
        "  ’I’m sure I’m very sorry,’ was all Alice could say; for the words\nof the old song kept ringing through her head like the ticking\nof a clock, and she could hardly help saying them out loud:–",
        "            ’Tweedledum and Tweedledee\n              Agreed to have a battle;\n            For Tweedledum said Tweedledee\n              Had spoiled his nice new rattle.",
        "            Just then flew down a monstrous crow,\n              As black as a tar-barrel;\n            Which frightened both the heroes so,\n              They quite forgot their quarrel.’",
        "  ’I know what you’re thinking about,’ said Tweedledum:  ’but it\nisn’t so, nohow.’",
        "  ’Contrariwise,’ continued Tweedledee, ’if it was so, it might\nbe; and if it were so, it would be; but as it isn’t, it ain’t.\nThat’s logic.’",
        "  ’I was thinking,’ Alice said very politely, ’which is the best\nway out of this wood:  it’s getting so dark.  Would you tell me,\nplease?’",
        "  But the little men only looked at each other and grinned.",
        "  They looked so exactly like a couple of great schoolboys, that\nAlice couldn’t help pointing her finger at Tweedledum, and saying\n’First Boy!’",
        "  ’Nohow!’ Tweedledum cried out briskly, and shut his mouth up\nagain with a snap.",
        "  ’Next Boy!’ said Alice, passing on to Tweedledee, though she\nfelt quite certain he would only shout out ’Contrariwise!’ and so\nhe did.",
        "  ’You’ve been wrong!’ cried Tweedledum.  ’The first thing in a\nvisit is to say “How d’ye do?” and shake hands!’  And here the\ntwo brothers gave each other a hug, and then they held out the\ntwo hands that were free, to shake hands with her.",
        "  Alice did not like shaking hands with either of them first, for\nfear of hurting the other one’s feelings; so, as the best way out\nof the difficulty, she took hold of both hands at once:  the next\nmoment they were dancing round in a ring.  This seemed quite\nnatural (she remembered afterwards), and she was not even\nsurprised to hear music playing:  it seemed to come from the tree\nunder which they were dancing, and it was done (as well as she\ncould make it out) by the branches rubbing one across the other,\nlike fiddles and fiddle-sticks.",
        "  ’But it certainly WAS funny,’ (Alice said afterwards, when she\nwas telling her sister the history of all this,) ’to find myself\nsinging “HERE WE GO ROUND THE MULBERRY BUSH.”  I don’t know when\nI began it, but somehow I felt as if I’d been singing it a long\nlong time!’",
        "  The other two dancers were fat, and very soon out of breath.\n’Four times round is enough for one dance,’ Tweedledum panted\nout, and they left off dancing as suddenly as they had begun:\nthe music stopped at the same moment.",
        "  Then they let go of Alice’s hands, and stood looking at her for\na minute:  there was a rather awkward pause, as Alice didn’t know\nhow to begin a conversation with people she had just been dancing\nwith.  ’It would never do to say “How d’ye do?” NOW,’ she said to\nherself:  ’we seem to have got beyond that, somehow!’",
        "  ’I hope you’re not much tired?’ she said at last.",
        "  ’Nohow.  And thank you VERY much for asking,’ said Tweedledum.",
        "  ’So much obliged!’ added Tweedledee.  ’You like poetry?’",
        "  ’Ye-es, pretty well–SOME poetry,’ Alice said doubtfully.\n’Would you tell me which road leads out of the wood?’",
        "  ’What shall I repeat to her?’ said Tweedledee, looking round at\nTweedledum with great solemn eyes, and not noticing Alice’s question.",
        "  ’\"THE WALRUS AND THE CARPENTER” is the longest,’ Tweedledum\nreplied, giving his brother an affectionate hug.",
        "  Tweedledee began instantly:",
        "                ’The sun was shining–’",
        "  Here Alice ventured to interrupt him.  ’If it’s VERY long,’ she\nsaid, as politely as she could, ’would you please tell me first\nwhich road–’",
        "  Tweedledee smiled gently, and began again:",
        "            ’The sun was shining on the sea,\n              Shining with all his might:\n            He did his very best to make\n              The billows smooth and bright–\n            And this was odd, because it was\n              The middle of the night.",
        "            The moon was shining sulkily,\n              Because she thought the sun\n            Had got no business to be there\n              After the day was done–\n            “It’s very rude of him,” she said,\n              “To come and spoil the fun!”",
        "            The sea was wet as wet could be,\n              The sands were dry as dry.\n            You could not see a cloud, because\n              No cloud was in the sky:\n            No birds were flying over head–\n              There were no birds to fly.",
        "            The Walrus and the Carpenter\n              Were walking close at hand;\n            They wept like anything to see\n              Such quantities of sand:\n            “If this were only cleared away,\"\n              They said, “it WOULD be grand!”",
        "            “If seven maids with seven mops\n              Swept it for half a year,\n            Do you suppose,” the Walrus said,\n              “That they could get it clear?\"\n            “I doubt it,” said the Carpenter,\n              And shed a bitter tear.",
        "            “O Oysters, come and walk with us!\"\n              The Walrus did beseech.\n            “A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,\n              Along the briny beach:\n            We cannot do with more than four,\n              To give a hand to each.”",
        "            The eldest Oyster looked at him.\n              But never a word he said:\n            The eldest Oyster winked his eye,\n              And shook his heavy head–\n            Meaning to say he did not choose\n              To leave the oyster-bed.",
        "            But four young oysters hurried up,\n              All eager for the treat:\n            Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,\n              Their shoes were clean and neat–\n            And this was odd, because, you know,\n              They hadn’t any feet.",
        "            Four other Oysters followed them,\n              And yet another four;\n            And thick and fast they came at last,\n              And more, and more, and more–\n            All hopping through the frothy waves,\n              And scrambling to the shore.",
        "            The Walrus and the Carpenter\n              Walked on a mile or so,\n            And then they rested on a rock\n              Conveniently low:\n            And all the little Oysters stood\n              And waited in a row.",
        "            “The time has come,” the Walrus said,\n              “To talk of many things:\n            Of shoes–and ships–and sealing-wax–\n              Of cabbages–and kings–\n            And why the sea is boiling hot–\n              And whether pigs have wings.”",
        "            “But wait a bit,” the Oysters cried,\n              “Before we have our chat;\n            For some of us are out of breath,\n              And all of us are fat!\"\n            “No hurry!” said the Carpenter.\n              They thanked him much for that.",
        "            “A loaf of bread,” the Walrus said,\n              “Is what we chiefly need:\n            Pepper and vinegar besides\n              Are very good indeed–\n            Now if you’re ready Oysters dear,\n              We can begin to feed.”",
        "            “But not on us!” the Oysters cried,\n              Turning a little blue,\n            “After such kindness, that would be\n              A dismal thing to do!\"\n            “The night is fine,” the Walrus said\n              “Do you admire the view?",
        "            “It was so kind of you to come!\n              And you are very nice!\"\n            The Carpenter said nothing but\n              “Cut us another slice:\n            I wish you were not quite so deaf–\n              I’ve had to ask you twice!”",
        "            “It seems a shame,” the Walrus said,\n              “To play them such a trick,\n            After we’ve brought them out so far,\n              And made them trot so quick!\"\n            The Carpenter said nothing but\n              “The butter’s spread too thick!”",
        "            “I weep for you,” the Walrus said.\n              “I deeply sympathize.\"\n            With sobs and tears he sorted out\n              Those of the largest size.\n            Holding his pocket handkerchief\n              Before his streaming eyes.",
        "            “O Oysters,” said the Carpenter.\n              “You’ve had a pleasant run!\n            Shall we be trotting home again?\"\n              But answer came there none–\n            And that was scarcely odd, because\n              They’d eaten every one.’",
        "  ’I like the Walrus best,’ said Alice:  ’because you see he was\na LITTLE sorry for the poor oysters.’",
        "  ’He ate more than the Carpenter, though,’ said Tweedledee.\n’You see he held his handkerchief in front, so that the Carpenter\ncouldn’t count how many he took:  contrariwise.’",
        "  ’That was mean!’ Alice said indignantly.  ’Then I like the\nCarpenter best–if he didn’t eat so many as the Walrus.’",
        "  ’But he ate as many as he could get,’ said Tweedledum.",
        "  This was a puzzler.  After a pause, Alice began, ’Well!  They\nwere BOTH very unpleasant characters–’  Here she checked\nherself in some alarm, at hearing something that sounded to her\nlike the puffing of a large steam-engine in the wood near them,\nthough she feared it was more likely to be a wild beast.\n’Are there any lions or tigers about here?’ she asked timidly.",
        "  ’It’s only the Red King snoring,’ said Tweedledee.",
        "  ’Come and look at him!’ the brothers cried, and they each took\none of Alice’s hands, and led her up to where the King was sleeping.",
        "  ’Isn’t he a LOVELY sight?’ said Tweedledum.",
        "  Alice couldn’t say honestly that he was.  He had a tall red\nnight-cap on, with a tassel, and he was lying crumpled up into a\nsort of untidy heap, and snoring loud–’fit to snore his head\noff!’ as Tweedledum remarked.",
        "  ’I’m afraid he’ll catch cold with lying on the damp grass,’\nsaid Alice, who was a very thoughtful little girl.",
        "  ’He’s dreaming now,’ said Tweedledee:  ’and what do you think\nhe’s dreaming about?’",
        "  Alice said ’Nobody can guess that.’",
        "  ’Why, about YOU!’ Tweedledee exclaimed, clapping his hands\ntriumphantly.  ’And if he left off dreaming about you, where do\nyou suppose you’d be?’",
        "  ’Where I am now, of course,’ said Alice.",
        "  ’Not you!’ Tweedledee retorted contemptuously.  ’You’d be\nnowhere.  Why, you’re only a sort of thing in his dream!’",
        "  ’If that there King was to wake,’ added Tweedledum, ’you’d go\nout–bang!–just like a candle!’",
        "  ’I shouldn’t!’ Alice exclaimed indignantly.  ’Besides, if I’M\nonly a sort of thing in his dream, what are YOU, I should like to\nknow?’",
        "  ’Ditto’ said Tweedledum.",
        "  ’Ditto, ditto’ cried Tweedledee.",
        "  He shouted this so loud that Alice couldn’t help saying, ’Hush!\nYou’ll be waking him, I’m afraid, if you make so much noise.’",
        "  ’Well, it no use YOUR talking about waking him,’ said\nTweedledum, ’when you’re only one of the things in his dream.\nYou know very well you’re not real.’",
        "  ’I AM real!’ said Alice and began to cry.",
        "  ’You won’t make yourself a bit realler by crying,’ Tweedledee\nremarked:  ’there’s nothing to cry about.’",
        "  ’If I wasn’t real,’ Alice said–half-laughing though her\ntears, it all seemed so ridiculous–’I shouldn’t be able to\ncry.’",
        "  ’I hope you don’t suppose those are real tears?’  Tweedledum\ninterrupted in a tone of great contempt.",
        "  ’I know they’re talking nonsense,’ Alice thought to herself:\n’and it’s foolish to cry about it.’  So she brushed away her\ntears, and went on as cheerfully as she could.  ’At any rate I’d\nbetter be getting out of the wood, for really it’s coming on very\ndark.  Do you think it’s going to rain?’",
        "  Tweedledum spread a large umbrella over himself and his\nbrother, and looked up into it.  ’No, I don’t think it is,’ he\nsaid:  ’at least–not under HERE.  Nohow.’",
        "  ’But it may rain OUTSIDE?’",
        "  ’It may–if it chooses,’ said Tweedledee:  ’we’ve no\nobjection.  Contrariwise.’",
        "  ’Selfish things!’ thought Alice, and she was just going to say\n’Good-night’ and leave them, when Tweedledum sprang out from\nunder the umbrella and seized her by the wrist.",
        "  ’Do you see THAT?’ he said, in a voice choking with passion,\nand his eyes grew large and yellow all in a moment, as he pointed\nwith a trembling finger at a small white thing lying under the\ntree.",
        "  ’It’s only a rattle,’ Alice said, after a careful examination\nof the little white thing.  ’Not a rattleSNAKE, you know,’ she\nadded hastily, thinking that he was frightened:  ’only an old\nrattle–quite old and broken.’",
        "  ’I knew it was!’ cried Tweedledum, beginning to stamp about\nwildly and tear his hair.  ’It’s spoilt, of course!’  Here he\nlooked at Tweedledee, who immediately sat down on the ground, and\ntried to hide himself under the umbrella.",
        "  Alice laid her hand upon his arm, and said in a soothing tone,\n’You needn’t be so angry about an old rattle.’",
        "  ’But it isn’t old!’ Tweedledum cried, in a greater fury than\never.  ’It’s new, I tell you–I bought it yesterday–my nice\nnew RATTLE!’ and his voice rose to a perfect scream.",
        "  All this time Tweedledee was trying his best to fold up the\numbrella, with himself in it:  which was such an extraordinary\nthing to do, that it quite took off Alice’s attention from the\nangry brother.  But he couldn’t quite succeed, and it ended in\nhis rolling over, bundled up in the umbrella, with only his head\nout:  and there he lay, opening and shutting his mouth and his\nlarge eyes–’looking more like a fish than anything else,’\nAlice thought.",
        "  ’Of course you agree to have a battle?’ Tweedledum said in a\ncalmer tone.",
        "  ’I suppose so,’ the other sulkily replied, as he crawled out of\nthe umbrella:  ’only SHE must help us to dress up, you know.’",
        "  So the two brothers went off hand-in-hand into the wood, and\nreturned in a minute with their arms full of things–such as\nbolsters, blankets, hearth-rugs, table-cloths, dish-covers and\ncoal-scuttles.  ’I hope you’re a good hand at pinning and tying\nstrings?’ Tweedledum remarked.  ’Every one of these things has\ngot to go on, somehow or other.’",
        "  Alice said afterwards she had never seen such a fuss made about\nanything in all her life–the way those two bustled about–\nand the quantity of things they put on–and the trouble they\ngave her in tying strings and fastening buttons–’Really\nthey’ll be more like bundles of old clothes than anything else,\nby the time they’re ready!’ she said to herself, as she arranged a\nbolster round the neck of Tweedledee, ’to keep his head from\nbeing cut off,’ as he said.",
        "  ’You know,’ he added very gravely, ’it’s one of the most\nserious things that can possibly happen to one in a battle–to\nget one’s head cut off.’",
        "  Alice laughed aloud:  but she managed to turn it into a cough,\nfor fear of hurting his feelings.",
        "  ’Do I look very pale?’ said Tweedledum, coming up to have his\nhelmet tied on.  (He CALLED it a helmet, though it certainly\nlooked much more like a saucepan.)",
        "  ’Well–yes–a LITTLE,’ Alice replied gently.",
        "  ’I’m very brave generally,’ he went on in a low voice:  ’only\nto-day I happen to have a headache.’",
        "  ’And I’VE got a toothache!’ said Tweedledee, who had overheard\nthe remark.  ’I’m far worse off than you!’",
        "  ’Then you’d better not fight to-day,’ said Alice, thinking it a\ngood opportunity to make peace.",
        "  ’We MUST have a bit of a fight, but I don’t care about going on\nlong,’ said Tweedledum.  ’What’s the time now?’",
        "  Tweedledee looked at his watch, and said ’Half-past four.’",
        "  ’Let’s fight till six, and then have dinner,’ said Tweedledum.",
        "  ’Very well,’ the other said, rather sadly:  ’and SHE can watch\nus–only you’d better not come VERY close,’ he added:  ’I\ngenerally hit everything I can see–when I get really excited.’",
        "  ’And I hit everything within reach,’ cried Tweedledum,\n’whether I can see it or not!’",
        "  Alice laughed.  ’You must hit the TREES pretty often, I should\nthink,’ she said.",
        "  Tweedledum looked round him with a satisfied smile.  ’I don’t suppose,’\nhe said, ’there’ll be a tree left standing, for ever so far round,\nby the time we’ve finished!’",
        "  ’And all about a rattle!’ said Alice, still hoping to make them\na LITTLE ashamed of fighting for such a trifle.",
        "  ’I shouldn’t have minded it so much,’ said Tweedledum, ’if it\nhadn’t been a new one.’",
        "  ’I wish the monstrous crow would come!’ thought Alice.",
        "  ’There’s only one sword, you know,’ Tweedledum said to his\nbrother:  ’but you can have the umbrella–it’s quite as sharp.\nOnly we must begin quick.  It’s getting as dark as it can.’",
        "  ’And darker.’ said Tweedledee.",
        "  It was getting dark so suddenly that Alice thought there must\nbe a thunderstorm coming on.  ’What a thick black cloud that is!’\nshe said.  ’And how fast it comes!  Why, I do believe it’s got\nwings!’",
        "  ’It’s the crow!’ Tweedledum cried out in a shrill voice of\nalarm:  and the two brothers took to their heels and were out of\nsight in a moment.",
        "  Alice ran a little way into the wood, and stopped under a large\ntree.  ’It can never get at me HERE,’ she thought:  ’it’s far too\nlarge to squeeze itself in among the trees.  But I wish it wouldn’t\nflap its wings so–it makes quite a hurricane in the wood–\nhere’s somebody’s shawl being blown away!’",
