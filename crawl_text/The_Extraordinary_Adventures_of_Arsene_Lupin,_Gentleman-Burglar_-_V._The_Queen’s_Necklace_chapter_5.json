        "Two or three times each year, on occasions of unusual importance,\nsuch as the balls at the Austrian Embassy or the soirees of Lady\nBillingstone, the Countess de Dreux-Soubise wore upon her white\nshoulders “The Queen’s Necklace.”",
        "It was, indeed, the famous necklace, the legendary necklace that\nBohmer and Bassenge, court jewelers, had made for Madame Du Barry;\nthe veritable necklace that the Cardinal de Rohan-Soubise intended\nto give to Marie-Antoinette, Queen of France; and the same that the\nadventuress Jeanne de Valois, Countess de la Motte, had pulled to\npieces one evening in February, 1785, with the aid of her husband\nand their accomplice, Retaux de Villette.",
        "To tell the truth, the mounting alone was genuine. Retaux de\nVillette had kept it, whilst the Count de la Motte and his wife\nscattered to the four winds of heaven the beautiful stones so\ncarefully chosen by Bohmer. Later, he sold the mounting to Gaston\nde Dreux-Soubise, nephew and heir of the Cardinal, who re-purchased\nthe few diamonds that remained in the possession of the English\njeweler, Jeffreys; supplemented them with other stones of the same\nsize but of much inferior quality, and thus restored the marvelous\nnecklace to the form in which it had come from the hands of Bohmer\nand Bassenge.",
        "For nearly a century, the house of Dreux-Soubise had prided itself\nupon the possession of this historic jewel. Although adverse\ncircumstances had greatly reduced their fortune, they preferred to\ncurtail their household expenses rather than part with this relic\nof royalty. More particularly, the present count clung to it as a\nman clings to the home of his ancestors. As a matter of prudence,\nhe had rented a safety-deposit box at the Credit Lyonnais in which\nto keep it. He went for it himself on the afternoon of the day on\nwhich his wife wished to wear it, and he, himself, carried it back\nnext morning.",
        "On this particular evening, at the reception given at the Palais de\nCastille, the Countess achieved a remarkable success; and King\nChristian, in whose honor the fete was given, commented on her\ngrace and beauty. The thousand facets of the diamond sparkled and\nshone like flames of fire about her shapely neck and shoulders, and\nit is safe to say that none but she could have borne the weight of\nsuch an ornament with so much ease and grace.",
        "This was a double triumph, and the Count de Dreux was highly elated\nwhen they returned to their chamber in the old house of the\nfaubourg Saint-Germain. He was proud of his wife, and quite as\nproud, perhaps, of the necklace that had conferred added luster to\nhis noble house for generations. His wife, also, regarded the\nnecklace with an almost childish vanity, and it was not without\nregret that she removed it from her shoulders and handed it to her\nhusband who admired it as passionately as if he had never seen it\nbefore. Then, having placed it in its case of red leather, stamped\nwith the Cardinal’s arms, he passed into an adjoining room which\nwas simply an alcove or cabinet that had been cut off from their\nchamber, and which could be entered only by means of a door at the\nfoot of their bed. As he had done on previous occasions, he hid it\non a high shelf amongst hat-boxes and piles of linen. He closed\nthe door, and retired.",
        "Next morning, he arose about nine o’clock, intending to go to the\nCredit Lyonnais before breakfast. He dressed, drank a cup of\ncoffee, and went to the stables to give his orders. The condition\nof one of the horses worried him. He caused it to be exercised in\nhis presence. Then he returned to his wife, who had not yet left\nthe chamber. Her maid was dressing her hair. When her husband\nentered, she asked:",
        "“Are you going out?”",
        "“Yes, as far as the bank.”",
        "“Of course. That is wise.”",
        "He entered the cabinet; but, after a few seconds, and without any\nsign of astonishment, he asked:",
        "“Did you take it, my dear?”",
        "“What?....No, I have not taken anything.”",
        "“You must have moved it.”",
        "“Not at all. I have not even opened that door.”",
        "He appeared at the door, disconcerted, and stammered, in a scarcely\nintelligible voice:",
        "“You haven’t....It wasn’t you?....Then....”",
        "She hastened to his assistance, and, together, they made a thorough\nsearch, throwing the boxes to the floor and overturning the piles\nof linen. Then the count said, quite discouraged:",
        "“It is useless to look any more. I put it here, on this shelf.”",
        "“You must be mistaken.”",
        "“No, no, it was on this shelf--nowhere else.”",
        "They lighted a candle, as the room was quite dark, and then carried\nout all the linen and other articles that the room contained. And,\nwhen the room was emptied, they confessed, in despair, that the\nfamous necklace had disappeared. Without losing time in vain\nlamentations, the countess notified the commissary of police, Mon.\nValorbe, who came at once, and, after hearing their story, inquired\nof the count:",
        "“Are you sure that no one passed through your chamber during the\nnight?”",
        "“Absolutely sure, as I am a very light sleeper. Besides, the\nchamber door was bolted, and I remember unbolting it this morning\nwhen my wife rang for her maid.”",
        "“And there is no other entrance to the cabinet?”",
        "“None.”",
        "“No windows?”",
        "“Yes, but it is closed up.”",
        "“I will look at it.”",
        "Candles were lighted, and Mon. Valorbe observed at once that the\nlower half of the window was covered by a large press which was,\nhowever, so narrow that it did not touch the casement on either\nside.",
        "“On what does this window open?”",
        "“A small inner court.”",
        "“And you have a floor above this?”",
        "“Two; but, on a level with the servant’s floor, there is a close\ngrating over the court. That is why this room is so dark.”",
        "When the press was moved, they found that the window was fastened,\nwhich would not have been the case if anyone had entered that way.",
        "“Unless,” said the count, “they went out through our chamber.”",
        "“In that case, you would have found the door unbolted.”",
        "The commissary considered the situation for a moment, then asked\nthe countess:",
        "“Did any of your servants know that you wore the necklace last\nevening?”",
        "“Certainly; I didn’t conceal the fact. But nobody knew that it was\nhidden in that cabinet.”",
        "“No one?”",
        "“No one....unless....”",
        "“Be quite sure, madam, as it is a very important point.”",
        "She turned to her husband, and said:",
        "“I was thinking of Henriette.”",
        "“Henriette? She didn’t know where we kept it.”",
        "“Are you sure?”",
        "“Who is this woman Henriette?” asked Mon. Valorbe.",
        "“A school-mate, who was disowned by her family for marrying beneath\nher. After her husband’s death, I furnished an apartment in this\nhouse for her and her son. She is clever with her needle and has\ndone some work for me.”",
        "“What floor is she on?”",
        "“Same as ours....at the end of the corridor....and I think....\nthe window of her kitchen....”",
        "“Opens on this little court, does it not?”",
        "“Yes, just opposite ours.”",
        "Mon. Valorbe then asked to see Henriette. They went to her\napartment; she was sewing, whilst her son Raoul, about six years\nold, was sitting beside her, reading. The commissary was surprised\nto see the wretched apartment that had been provided for the woman.\nIt consisted of one room without a fireplace, and a very small room\nthat served as a kitchen. The commissary proceeded to question\nher. She appeared to be overwhelmed on learning of the theft.\nLast evening she had herself dressed the countess and placed the\nnecklace upon her shoulders.",
        "“Good God!” she exclaimed, “it can’t be possible!”",
        "“And you have no idea? Not the least suspicion? Is it possible\nthat the thief may have passed through your room?”",
        "She laughed heartily, never supposing that she could be an object\nof suspicion.",
        "“But I have not left my room. I never go out. And, perhaps, you\nhave not seen?”",
        "She opened the kitchen window, and said:",
        "“See, it is at least three metres to the ledge of the opposite\nwindow.”",
        "“Who told you that we supposed the theft might have been committed\nin that way?”",
        "“But....the necklace was in the cabinet, wasn’t it?”",
        "“How do you know that?”",
        "“Why, I have always known that it was kept there at night. It had\nbeen mentioned in my presence.”",
        "Her face, though still young, bore unmistakable traces of sorrow\nand resignation. And it now assumed an expression of anxiety as if\nsome danger threatened her. She drew her son toward her. The\nchild took her hand, and kissed it affectionately.",
        "When they were alone again, the count said to the commissary:",
        "“I do not suppose you suspect Henriette. I can answer for her.\nShe is honesty itself.”",
        "“I quite agree with you,” replied Mon. Valorbe. “At most, I\nthought there might have been an unconscious complicity. But I\nconfess that even that theory must be abandoned, as it does not\nhelp solve the problem now before us.”",
        "The commissary of police abandoned the investigation, which was now\ntaken up and completed by the examining judge. He questioned the\nservants, examined the condition of the bolt, experimented with the\nopening and closing of the cabinet window, and explored the little\ncourt from top to bottom. All was in vain. The bolt was intact.\nThe window could not be opened or closed from the outside.",
        "The inquiries especially concerned Henriette, for, in spite of\neverything, they always turned in her direction. They made a\nthorough investigation of her past life, and ascertained that,\nduring the last three years, she had left the house only four\ntimes, and her business, on those occasions, was satisfactorily\nexplained. As a matter of fact, she acted as chambermaid and\nseamstress to the countess, who treated her with great strictness\nand even severity.",
        "At the end of a week, the examining judge had secured no more\ndefinite information than the commissary of police. The judge\nsaid:",
        "“Admitting that we know the guilty party, which we do not, we are\nconfronted by the fact that we do not know hoe the theft was\ncommitted. We are brought face to face with two obstacles: a door\nand a window--both closed and fastened. It is thus a double\nmystery. How could anyone enter, and, moreover, how could any one\nescape, leaving behind him a bolted door and a fastened window?”",
        "At the end of four months, the secret opinion of the judge was that\nthe count and countess, being hard pressed for money, which was\ntheir normal condition, had sold the Queen’s Necklace. He closed\nthe investigation.",
        "The loss of the famous jewel was a severe blow to the Dreux-\nSoubise. Their credit being no longer propped up by the reserve\nfund that such a treasure constituted, they found themselves\nconfronted by more exacting creditors and money-lenders. They were\nobliged to cut down to the quick, to sell or mortgage every article\nthat possessed any commercial value. In brief, it would have been\ntheir ruin, if two large legacies from some distant relatives had\nnot saved them.",
        "Their pride also suffered a downfall, as if they had lost a\nquartering from their escutcheon. And, strange to relate, it was\nupon her former schoolmate, Henriette, that the countess vented her\nspleen. Toward her, the countess displayed the most spiteful\nfeelings, and even openly accused her. First, Henriette was\nrelegated to the servants’ quarters, and, next day, discharged.",
        "For some time, the count and countess passed an uneventful life.\nThey traveled a great deal. Only one incident of record occurred\nduring that period. Some months after the departure of Henriette,\nthe countess was surprised when she received and read the following\nletter, signed by Henriette:",
        "“Madame,\"\n“I do not know how to thank you; for it was you, was it not, who\nsent me that? It could not have been anyone else. No one but you\nknows where I live. If I am wrong, excuse me, and accept my\nsincere thanks for your past favors....”",
        "What did the letter mean? The present or past favors of the\ncountess consisted principally of injustice and neglect. Why,\nthen, this letter of thanks?",
        "When asked for an explanation, Henriette replied that she had\nreceived a letter, through the mails, enclosing two bank-notes of\none thousand francs each. The envelope, which she enclosed with\nher reply, bore the Paris post-mark, and was addressed in a\nhandwriting that was obviously disguised. Now, whence came those\ntwo thousand francs? Who had sent them? And why had they sent\nthem?",
        "Henriette received a similar letter and a like sum of money twelve\nmonths later. And a third time; and a fourth; and each year for a\nperiod of six years, with this difference, that in the fifth and\nsixth years the sum was doubled. There was another difference:\nthe post-office authorities having seized one of the letters under\nthe pretext that it was not registered, the last two letters were\nduly sent according to the postal regulations, the first dated from\nSaint-Germain, the other from Suresnes. The writer signed the\nfirst one, “Anquety\"; and the other, “Pechard.” The addresses that\nhe gave were false.",
        "At the end of six years, Henriette dies, and the mystery remained\nunsolved.",
        "All these events are known to the public. The case was one of\nthose which excite public interest, and it was a strange\ncoincidence that this necklace, which had caused such a great\ncommotion in France at the close of the eighteenth century, should\ncreate a similar commotion a century later. But what I am about to\nrelate is known only to the parties directly interested and a few\nothers from whom the count exacted a promise of secrecy. As it is\nprobable that some day or other that promise will be broken, I have\nno hesitation in rending the veil and thus disclosing the key to\nthe mystery, the explanation of the letter published in the morning\npapers two days ago; an extraordinary letter which increased, if\npossible, the mists and shadows that envelope this inscrutable\ndrama.",
        "Five days ago, a number of guests were dining with the Count de\nDreux-Soubise. There were several ladies present, including his\ntwo nieces and his cousin, and the following gentlemen: the\npresident of Essaville, the deputy Bochas, the chevalier Floriani,\nwhom the count had known in Sicily, and General Marquis de\nRouzieres, and old club friend.",
        "After the repast, coffee was served by the ladies, who gave the\ngentlemen permission to smoke their cigarettes, provided they would\nnot desert the salon. The conversation was general, and finally\none of the guests chanced to speak of celebrated crimes. And that\ngave the Marquis de Rouzieres, who delighted to tease the count, an\nopportunity to mention the affair of the Queen’s Necklace, a\nsubject that the count detested.",
        "Each one expressed hi own opinion of the affair; and, of course,\ntheir various theories were not only contradictory but impossible.",
        "“And you, monsieur,” said the countess to the chevalier Floriani,\n“what is your opinion?”",
        "“Oh! I--I have no opinion, madame.”",
        "All the guests protested; for the chevalier had just related in an\nentertaining manner various adventures in which he had participated\nwith his father, a magistrate at Palermo, and which established his\njudgment and taste in such manners.",
        "“I confess,” said he, “I have sometimes succeeded in unraveling\nmysteries that the cleverest detectives have renounced; yet I do\nnot claim to be Sherlock Holmes. Moreover, I know very little\nabout the affair of the Queen’s Necklace.”",
        "Everybody now turned to the count, who was thus obliged, quite\nunwillingly, to narrate all the circumstances connected with the\ntheft. The chevalier listened, reflected, asked a few questions,\nand said:",
        "“It is very strange....at first sight, the problem appears to be a\nvery simple one.”",
        "The count shrugged his shoulders. The others drew closer to the\nchevalier, who continued, in a dogmatic tone:",
        "“As a general rule, in order to find the author of a crime or a\ntheft, it is necessary to determine how that crime or theft was\ncommitted, or, at least, how it could have been committed. In the\npresent case, nothing is more simple, because we are face to face,\nnot with several theories, but with one positive fact, that is to\nsay: the thief could only enter by the chamber door or the window\nof the cabinet. Now, a person cannot open a bolted door from the\noutside. Therefore, he must have entered through the window.”",
        "“But it was closed and fastened, and we fount it fastened\nafterward,” declared the count.",
        "“In order to do that,” continued Floriani, without heeding the\ninterruption, “he had simply to construct a bridge, a plank or a\nladder, between the balcony of the kitchen and the ledge of the\nwindow, and as the jewel-case---”",
        "“But I repeat that the window was fastened,” exclaimed the count,\nimpatiently.",
        "This time, Floriani was obliged to reply. He did so with\nthe greatest tranquility, as if the objection was the most\ninsignificant affair in the world.",
        "“I will admit that it was; but is there not a transom in the upper\npart of the window?”",
        "“How do you know that?”",
        "“In the first place, that was customary in houses of that date;\nand, in the second place, without such a transom, the theft cannot\nbe explained.”",
        "“Yes, there is one, but it was closed, the same as the window.\nConsequently, we did not pay attention to it.”",
        "“That was a mistake; for, if you had examined it, you would have\nfound that it had been opened.”",
        "“But how?”",
        "“I presume that, like all others, it opens by means of a wire with\na ring on the lower end.”",
        "“Yes, but I do not see---”",
        "“Now, through a hole in the window, a person could, by the aid of\nsome instrument, let us say a poker with a hook at the end, grip\nthe ring, pull down, and open the transom.”",
        "The count laughed and said:",
        "“Excellent! excellent! Your scheme is very cleverly constructed,\nbut you overlook one thing, monsieur, there is no hole in the\nwindow.”",
        "“There was a hole.”",
        "“Nonsense, we would have seen it.”",
        "“In order to see it, you must look for it, and no one has looked.\nThe hole is there; it must be there, at the side of the window, in\nthe putty. In a vertical direction, of course.”",
        "The count arose. He was greatly excited. He paced up and down the\nroom, two or three times, in a nervous manner; then, approaching\nFloriani, said:",
        "“Nobody has been in that room since; nothing has been changed.”",
        "“Very well, monsieur, you can easily satisfy yourself that my\nexplanation is correct.”",
        "“It does not agree with the facts established by the examining\njudge. You have seen nothing, and yet you contradict all that we\nhave seen and all that we know.”",
        "Floriani paid no attention to the count’s petulance. He simply\nsmiled and said:",
        "“Mon Dieu, monsieur, I submit my theory; that is all. If I am\nmistaken, you can easily prove it.”",
        "“I will do so at once....I confess that you assurance---”",
        "The count muttered a few more words; then suddenly rushed to the\ndoor and passed out. Not a word was uttered in his absence; and\nthis profound silence gave the situation an air of almost tragic\nimportance. Finally, the count returned. He was pale and nervous.\nHe said to his friends, in a trembling voice:",
        "“I beg your pardon....the revelations of the chevalier were so\nunexpected....I should never have thought....”",
        "His wife questioned him, eagerly:",
        "“Speak....what is it?”",
        "He stammered: “The hole is there, at the very spot, at the side of\nthe window---”",
        "He seized the chevalier’s arm, and said to him in an imperious\ntone:",
        "“Now, monsieur, proceed. I admit that you are right so far, but\nnow....that is not all....go on....tell us the rest of it.”",
        "Floriani disengaged his arm gently, and, after a moment, continued:",
        "“Well, in my opinion, this is what happened. The thief, knowing\nthat the countess was going to wear the necklace that evening, had\nprepared his gangway or bridge during you absence. He watched you\nthrough the window and saw you hide the necklace. Afterward, he\ncut the glass and pulled the ring.”",
        "“Ah! but the distance was so great that it would be impossible for\nhim to reach the window-fastening through the transom.”",
        "“Well, then, if he could not open the window by reaching through\nthe transom, he must have crawled through the transom.”",
        "“Impossible; it is too small. No man could crawl through it.”",
        "“Then it was not a man,” declared Floriani.",
        "“What!”",
        "“If the transom is too small to admit a man, it must have been a\nchild.”",
        "“A child!”",
        "“Did you not say that your friend Henriette had a son?”",
        "“Yes; a son named Raoul.”",
        "“Then, in all probability, it was Raoul who committed the theft.”",
        "“What proof have you of that?”",
        "“What proof! Plenty of it....For instance---”",
        "He stopped, and reflected for a moment, then continued:",
        "“For instance, that gangway or bridge. It is improbable that the\nchild could have brought it in from outside the house and carried\nit away again without being observed. He must have used something\nclose at hand. In the little room used by Henriette as a kitchen,\nwere there not some shelves against the wall on which she placed\nher pans and dishes?”",
        "“Two shelves, to the best of my memory.”",
        "“Are you sure that those shelves are really fastened to the wooden\nbrackets that support them? For, if they are nor, we could be\njustified in presuming that the child removed them, fastened them\ntogether, and thus formed his bridge. Perhaps, also, since there\nwas a stove, we might find the bent poker that he used to open the\ntransom.”",
        "Without saying a word, the count left the room; and, this time,\nthose present did not feel the nervous anxiety they had experienced\nthe first time. They were confident that Floriani was right, and\nno one was surprised when the count returned and declared:",
        "“It was the child. Everything proves it.”",
        "“You have seen the shelves and the poker?”",
        "“Yes. The shelves have been unnailed, and the poker is there yet.”",
        "But the countess exclaimed:",
        "“You had better say it was his mother. Henriette is the guilty\nparty. She must have compelled her son---”",
        "“No,” declared the chevalier, “the mother had nothing to do with\nit.”",
        "“Nonsense! they occupied the same room. The child could not have\ndone it without the mother’s knowledge.”",
        "“True, they lived in the same room, but all this happened in the\nadjoining room, during the night, while the mother was asleep.”",
        "“And the necklace?” said the count. “It would have been found\namongst the child’s things.”",
        "“Pardon me! He had been out. That morning, on which you found him\nreading, he had just come from school, and perhaps the commissary\nof police, instead of wasting his time on the innocent mother,\nwould have been better employed in searching the child’s desk\namongst his school-books.”",
        "“But how do you explain those two thousand francs that Henriette\nreceived each year? Are they not evidence of her complicity?”",
        "“If she had been an accomplice, would she have thanked you for that\nmoney? And then, was she not closely watched? But the child,\nbeing free, could easily go to a neighboring city, negotiate with\nsome dealer and sell him one diamond or two diamonds, as he might\nwish, upon condition that the money should be sent from Paris, and\nthat proceeding could be repeated from year to year.”",
        "An indescribable anxiety oppressed the Dreux-Soubise and their\nguests. There was something in the tone and attitude of Floriani--\nsomething more that the chevalier’s assurance which, from the\nbeginning, had so annoyed the count. There was a touch of irony,\nthat seemed rather hostile than sympathetic. But the count\naffected to laugh, as he said:",
        "“All that is very ingenious and interesting, and I congratulate you\nupon your vivid imagination.”",
        "“No, not at all,” replied Floriani, with the utmost gravity, “I\nimagine nothing. I simply describe the events as they must have\noccurred.”",
        "“But what do you know about them?”",
        "“What you yourself have told me. I picture to myself the life of\nthe mother and child down there in the country; the illness of the\nmother, the schemes of and inventions of the child sell the\nprecious stones in order to save his mother’s life, or, at least,\nsoothe her dying moments. Her illness overcomes her. She dies.\nYears roll on. The child becomes a man; and then--and now I will\ngive my imagination a free rein--let us suppose that the man feels a\ndesire to return to the home of his childhood, that he does so, and\nthat he meets there certain people who suspect and accuse his\nmother....do you realize the sorrow and anguish of such an\ninterview in the very house wherein the original drama was played?”",
        "His words seemed to echo for a few seconds in the ensuing silence,\nand one could read upon the faces of the Count and Countess de\nDreux a bewildered effort to comprehend his meaning and, at the\nsame time, the fear and anguish of such a comprehension. The count\nspoke at last, and said:",
        "“Who are you, monsieur?”",
        "“I? The chevalier Floriani, whom you met at Palermo, and whom you\nhave been gracious enough to invite to your house on several\noccasions.”",
        "“Then what does this story mean?”",
        "“Oh! nothing at all! It is simply a pastime, so far as I am\nconcerned. I endeavor to depict the pleasure that Henriette’s son,\nif he still lives, would have in telling you that he was the guilty\nparty, and that he did it because his mother was unhappy, as she\nwas on the point of losing the place of a....servant, by which she\nlived, and because the child suffered at sight of his mother’s\nsorrow.”",
        "He spoke with suppressed emotion, rose partially and inclined\ntoward the countess. There could be no doubt that the chevalier\nFloriani was Henriette’s son. His attitude and words proclaimed\nit. Besides, was it not his obvious intention and desire to be\nrecognized as such?",
        "The count hesitated. What action would he take against the\naudacious guest? Ring? Provoke a scandal? Unmask the man who had\nonce robbed him? But that was a long time ago! And who would\nbelieve that absurd story about the guilty child? No; better far\nto accept the situation, and pretend not to comprehend the true\nmeaning of it. So the count, turning to Floriani, exclaimed:",
        "“Your story is very curious, very entertaining; I enjoyed it much.\nBut what do you think has become of this young man, this model son?\nI hope he has not abandoned the career in which he made such a\nbrilliant debut.”",
        "“Oh! certainly not.”",
        "“After such a debut! To steal the Queen’s Necklace at six years of\nage; the celebrated necklace that was coveted by Marie-Antoinette!”",
        "“And to steal it,” remarked Floriani, falling in with the count’s\nmood, “without costing him the slightest trouble, without anyone\nthinking to examine the condition of the window, or to observe that\nthe window-sill was too clean--that window-sill which he had wiped\nin order to efface the marks he had made in the thick dust. We\nmust admit that it was sufficient to turn the head of a boy at that\nage. It was all so easy. He had simply to desire the thing, and\nreach out his hand to get it.”",
        "“And he reached out his hand.”",
        "“Both hands,” replied the chevalier, laughing.",
        "His companions received a shock. What mystery surrounded the life\nof the so-called Floriani? How wonderful must have been the life\nof that adventurer, a thief at six years of age, and who, to-day,\nin search of excitement or, at most, to gratify a feeling of\nresentment, had come to brave his victim in her own house,\naudaciously, foolishly, and yet with all the grace and delicacy of\na courteous guest!",
        "He arose and approached the countess to bid her adieu. She\nrecoiled, unconsciously. He smiled.",
        "“Oh! Madame, you are afraid of me! Did I pursue my role of parlor-\nmagician a step too far?”",
        "She controlled herself, and replied, with her accustomed ease:",
        "“Not at all, monsieur. The legend of that dutiful son interested\nme very much, and I am pleased to know that my necklace had such a\nbrilliant destiny. But do you not think that the son of that\nwoman, that Henriette, was the victim of hereditary influence in\nthe choice of his vocation?”",
        "He shuddered, feeling the point, and replied:",
        "“I am sure of it; and, moreover, his natural tendency to crime must\nhave been very strong or he would have been discouraged.”",
        "“Why so?”",
        "“Because, as you must know, the majority of the diamonds were\nfalse. The only genuine stones were the few purchased from the\nEnglish jeweler, the others having been sold, one by one, to meet\nthe cruel necessities of life.”",
        "“It was still the Queen’s Necklace, monsieur,” replied the\ncountess, haughtily, “and that is something that he, Henriette’s\nson, could not appreciate.”",
        "“He was able to appreciate, madame, that, whether true or false,\nthe necklace was nothing more that an object of parade, an emblem\nof senseless pride.”",
        "The count made a threatening gesture, but his wife stopped him.",
        "“Monsieur,” she said, “if the man to whom you allude has the\nslightest sense of honor---”",
        "She stopped, intimidated by Floriani’s cool manner.",
        "“If that man has the slightest sense of honor,” he repeated.",
        "She felt that she would not gain anything by speaking to him in\nthat manner, and in spite of her anger and indignation, trembling\nas she was from humiliated pride, she said to him, almost politely:",
        "“Monsieur, the legend says that Retaux de Villette, when in\npossession of the Queen’s Necklace, did not disfigure the mounting.\nHe understood that the diamonds were simply the ornament, the\naccessory, and that the mounting was the essential work, the\ncreation of the artist, and he respected it accordingly. Do you\nthink that this man had the same feeling?”",
        "“I have no doubt that the mounting still exists. The child\nrespected it.”",
        "“Well, monsieur, if you should happen to meet him, will you tell\nhim that he unjustly keeps possession of a relic that is the\nproperty and pride of a certain family, and that, although the\nstones have been removed, the Queen’s necklace still belongs to the\nhouse of Dreux-Soubise. It belongs to us as much as our name or\nour honor.”",
        "The chevalier replied, simply:",
        "“I shall tell him, madame.”",
        "He bowed to her, saluted the count and the other guests, and\ndeparted.",
        "Four days later, the countess de Dreux found upon the table in her\nchamber a red leather case bearing the cardinal’s arms. She opened\nit, and found the Queen’s Necklace.",
        "But as all things must, in the life of a man who strives for unity\nand logic, converge toward the same goal--and as a little\nadvertising never does any harm--on the following day, the `Echo de\nFrance’ published these sensational lines:",
        "“The Queen’s Necklace, the famous historical jewelry stolen from\nthe family of Dreux-Soubise, has been recovered by Arsene Lupin,\nwho hastened to restore it to its rightful owner. We cannot too\nhighly commend such a delicate and chivalrous act.”",
