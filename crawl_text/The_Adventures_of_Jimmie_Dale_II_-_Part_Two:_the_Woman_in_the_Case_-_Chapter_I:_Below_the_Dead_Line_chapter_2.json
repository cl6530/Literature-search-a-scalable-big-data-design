        "Whisperings!  Always whisperings, low, sibilant, floating errantly\nfrom all sides, until they seemed a component part of the drug-laden\natmosphere itself.  And occasionally another sound: the soft SLAP-\nSLAP of loose-slippered feet, the faint rustle of equally loose-\nfitting garments.  And everywhere the sweet, sickish smell of opium.\nIt was Chang Foo’s, simply a cellar or two deeper in Chang Foo’s\nthan that in which Dago Jim had quarrelled once–and died!",
        "Larry the Bat, vicious-faced, unkempt, disreputable, lay sprawled\nout on one of the dive’s bunks, an opium pipe beside him.  But Larry\nthe Bat was not smoking; instead, his ear was pressed closely\nagainst the boarding that formed the rather flimsy partition at the\nside of the bunk.  One heard many things in Chang Foo’s if one cared\nto listen–if one could first win one’s way through the carefully\nguarded gateway, that to the uninitiated offered nothing more\ninteresting than the entrance to a Chinese tea-shop, and an\nuninviting one at that!",
        "HAD HE BEEN FOLLOWED IN HERE?  He had been shadowed for the last\nhour; of that, at least, he was certain.  Why?  By whom?  For an\nhour he had dodged in and out through the dens of the underworld, as\nonly one who was at home there and known to all could do–and at\nlast he had taken refuge in Chang Foo’s like a fox burrowing deep\ninto its hole.",
        "Few could find their way into the most infamous opium den in all New\nYork, where not only the poppy ruled as master, but where crime was\nhatched, ay, and carried to its ghastly consummation, sometimes, as\nwell; and of those few, not one but was of the underworld itself.\nAnd it was that fact which held his muscles strained and rigid now\nunder the miserable rags that covered them, and it was that which\nkept the keen, quick brain alert and active, every faculty keyed up\nand tense.  If it were the police, he had little to fear, for they\ncould not force their way in without warning; but if it were the\nunderworld, he was in imminent peril, and had done little better\nthan run himself into a trap from which there was no escape.",
        "“DEATH TO THE GRAY SEAL!\"–he had heard that whispered more than\nonce in this very place.  Who knew at what moment the role of Larry\nthe Bat would be uncovered, and the underworld, where now he held so\nhigh a place, would be at his throat like a pack of snarling wolves!\nWho had been shadowing him during the last hour?",
        "Whisperings!  Nothing tangible!  He could catch no words.  Only the\nnever-ending whisperings of gathered groups here and there–and\nsometimes the clink of coin where some game was in progress.",
        "The curtain before his bunk was drawn suddenly aside–and Larry the\nBat’s fingers, where his hand was carelessly hidden by his body\ntightened upon his automatic.",
        "“Smokee some more?”",
        "The fingers relaxed.  It was only Sam Wah, one of the attendants.",
        "“Nix!” said Larry the Bat, in a slightly muddled tone.  “Got\nenough.”",
        "The curtain fell into place again.  Larry the Bat’s lips set in a\nthin smile.  Ultimately it made little difference whether it was the\npolice or the underworld!  The smile grew thinner.  It was the flip\nof a coin, that was all!  With one there was the death house at Sing\nSing for the Gray Seal; with the other–well, there were many ways,\nfrom a shot or a knife thrust in the open street, to his murder in\nsome hidden dive like this of Chang Foo’s, for instance, where he\nnow was–the Gray Seal was responsible for the occupancy of too many\npenitentiary cells by those of the underworld to look for any other\nfate!",
        "He raised himself up sharply on his elbow.  A shrill, high note,\nlike the scream of a parrakeet, rang out a second time.  He tore the\ncurtain aside, and jumped to his feet.  All around him, in the\ntwinkling of an eye, Chinamen in fluttering blouses, chattering like\nmagpies, mingled with snarling, cursing whites, were running madly.\nA voice, prefaced with an oath, bawled out behind him, as he sprang\nforward and joined the rush:",
        "“Beat it!  De cops!  Beat it!”",
        "The police!  A raid!  Was it for HIM?  From rooms, an amazing number\nof them, more forms rushed out, joined, divided, separated, and\ndashed, some this way, some that, along branching passageways.\nThere had been raids before, the police had begun to change their\nminds about Chang Foo’s, but Chang Foo’s was not an easy place to\nraid.  House after house in that quarter of Chinese laundries, of\ntea shops, of chop-suey joints, opened one into the other through\nsecret passages in the cellars.  Larry the Bat plunged down a\nstaircase, and halted in the darkness of a cellar, drawing back\nagainst the wall while the flying feet of his fellow fugitives\nscurried by him.",
        "Was it for HIM, this raid?  If not, the police had not a hope of\ngetting him if he kept his head; for back in Chang Foo’s proper,\nwhich would be quite closed off now, Chang Foo would be blandly\nsubmitting to arrest, offering himself as a sort of glorified\nsacrifice while the police confiscated opium and fan-tan layouts.\nIf the police had no other purpose than that in mind, Chang Foo\nwould simply pay a fine; the next night the place would be in full\nblast again; and Chang Foo, higher than ever in the confidence of\nthe underworld’s aristocracy, would reap his reward–and that would\nbe all there was to it.",
        "But was that all?  The raid had followed significantly close upon\nthe heels of his entry into Chang Foo’s.  Larry the Bat began to\nmove forward again.  He dared not follow the others, and, later on,\nwhen quiet was restored, issue out into the street from any one of\nthe various houses in which he might temporarily have taken refuge.\nThere was a chance in that, a chance that the police might be more\nzealous than usual, even if he particularly was not their game–and\nhe could take no chance.  Arrest for Larry the Bat, even on\nsuspicion, could have but one conclusion–not a pleasant one–the\ndisclosure that Larry the Bat was not Larry the Bat at all, but\nJimmie Dale, the millionaire club-man, and, to complete a fatal\ntriplication, that Larry the Bat and Jimmie Dale was the Gray Seal\nupon whose head was fixed a price!",
        "All was silence around him now, except that from overhead came\noccasionally the muffled tread of feet.  He felt his way along into\na black, narrow passage, emerged into a second cellar, swept the\nplace with a single, circling gleam from a pocket flashlight, passed\na stairway that led upward, reached the opposite wall, and, dropping\non hands and knees, crawled into what, innocently enough, appeared\nto be the opening of a coal bin.",
        "He knew Chang Foo’s well–as he knew the ins and outs of every den\nand place he frequented, knew them as a man knows such things when\nhis life at any moment might hang upon his knowledge.",
        "He was in another passage now, and this, in a few steps, brought him\nto a door.  Here he halted, and stood for a full five minutes,\nabsolutely motionless, absolutely still, listening.  There was\nnothing–not a sound.  He tried the door cautiously.  It was locked.\nThe slim, sensitive, tapering fingers of Jimmie Dale, unrecognisable\nnow in the grimy digits of Larry the Bat, felt tentatively over the\nlock.  To fingers that seemed in their tips to possess all the human\nsenses, that time and again in their delicate touch upon the dial of\na safe had mocked at human ingenuity and driven the police into\nimpotent frenzy, this was a pitiful thing.  From his pocket came a\nsmall steel instrument that was quickly and deftly inserted in the\nkeyhole.  There was a click, the door swung open, and Jimmie Dale,\nalias Larry the Bat, stepped outside into a back yard half a block\naway from the entrance to Chang Foo’s.",
        "Again he listened.  There did not appear to be any unusual\nexcitement in the neighbourhood.  From open windows above him and\nfrom adjoining houses came the ordinary, commonplace sounds of\nvoices talking and laughing, even the queer, weird notes of a\nChinese chant.  He stole noiselessly across the yard, out into the\nlane, and made his way rapidly along to the cross street.",
        "In a measure, now, he was safe; but one thing, a very vital thing,\nremained to be done.  It was absolutely necessary that he should\nknow whether he was the quarry that the police had been after in the\nraid, if it was the police who had been shadowing him all evening.\nIf it was the police, there was but one meaning to it–Larry the Bat\nwas known to be the Gray Seal, and a problem perilous enough in any\naspect confronted him.  Dare he risk the Sanctuary–for the clothes\nof Jimmie Dale?  Or was it safer to burglarise, as he had once done\nbefore, his own mansion on Riverside Drive?",
        "His thoughts were running riot, and he frowned, angry with himself.\nThere was time enough to think of that when he knew that it was the\npolice against whom he had to match his wits.",
        "Well in the shadow of the buildings, he moved swiftly along the side\nstreet until he came to the corner of the street on which, halfway\ndown the block, fronted Chang Foo’s tea-shop.  A glance in that\ndirection, and Jimmie Dale drew a breath of relief.  A patrol wagon\nwas backed up to the curb, and a half dozen officers were busy\nloading it with what was evidently Chang Foo’s far from meagre stock\nof gambling appurtenances; while Chang Foo himself, together with\nSam Wah and another attendant, were in the grip of two other\nofficers, waiting possibly for another patrol wagon.  There was a\ncrowd, too, but the crowd was at a respectful distance–on the\nopposite side of the street.",
        "Jimmie Dale still hugged the corner.  A man swaggered out from a\ndoorway, quite close to Chang Foo’s, and came on along the street.\nAs the other reached the corner, Jimmie Dale sidled forward.",
        "“’Ello, Chick!” he said, out of the corner of his mouth.  “Wot’s de\nlay?”",
        "“’Ello, Larry!” returned the other.  “Aw, nuthin’!  De nutcracker on\nChang, dat’s all.”",
        "“I t’ought mabbe dey was lookin’ for some guy dat was in dere,\"\nobserved Jimmie Dale.",
        "“Nuthin’ doin’!” the other answered.  “I was in dere meself.  De\nwhole mob beat it clean, an’ de bulls never batted an eye.  Didn’t\nyouse pipe me make me get-away outer Shanghai’s a minute ago?  De\nbulls never went nowhere except into Chang’s.  Dere’s a new\nlootenant in de precinct inaugeratin’ himself, dat’s all.  S’long,\nLarry–I gotta date.”",
        "“S’long, Chick!” responded Jimmie Dale–and started slowly back\nalong the cross street.",
        "It was not the police, then, who were interested in his movements!\nThen who?  He shook his head with a little, savage, impotent\ngesture.  One thing was clear: it was too early to risk a return to\nthe Sanctuary and attempt the rehabilitation of Jimmie Dale.  If any\none was on the hunt for Larry the Bat, the Sanctuary would be the\nlast place to be overlooked.",
        "He turned the next corner, hesitated a moment in front of a garishly\nlighted dance hall, and finally shuffled in through the door, made\nhis way across the floor, nodding here and there to the elite of\ngangland, and, with a somewhat arrogant air of proprietorship, sat\ndown at a table in the corner.  Little better than a tramp in\nappearance, certainly the most disreputable-looking object in the\nplace, even the waiter who approached him accorded him a certain\ncurious deference–was not Larry the Bat the most celebrated dope\nfiend below the dead line?",
        "“Gimme a mug o’ suds!” ordered Jimmie Dale, and sprawled royally\nback in his chair.",
        "Under the rim of his slouch hat, pulled now far over his eyes, he\nsearched the faces around him.  If he had been asked to pick the\nactors for a revel from the scum of the underworld, he could not\nhave improved upon the gathering.  There were perhaps a hundred men\nand women in the room, the majority dancing, and, with the exception\nof a few sight-seeing slummers, they were men and women whose\nacquaintance with the police was intimate but not cordial–far from\ncordial.",
        "Jimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders, and sipped at the glass that had\nbeen set before him.  It was grimly ironic that he should be, not\nonly there, but actually a factor and a part of the underworld’s\nintimate life!  He, Jimmie Dale, a wealthy man, a member of New\nYork’s exclusive clubs, a member of New York’s most exclusive\nsociety!  It was inconceivable.  He smiled sardonically.  Was it?\nWell, then, it was none the less true.  His life unquestionably was\none unique, apart from any other man’s, but it was, for all that,\nactual and real.",
        "There had been three years of it now–since SHE had come into his\nlife.  Jimmie Dale slouched down a little in his chair.  The ice was\nthin, perilously thin, that he was skating on now.  Each letter,\nwith its demand upon him to match his wits against police or\nunderworld, or against both combined, perhaps, made that peril a\nlittle greater, a little more imminent–if that were possible, when\nalready his life was almost literally carried, daily, hourly, in his\nhand.  Not that he rebelled against it; it was worth the price that\nsome day he expected he must pay–the price of honour, wealth, a\nname disgraced, ruin, death.  Was he quixotic?  Immoderately so?  He\nsmiled gravely.  Perhaps.  But he would do it all over again if the\nchoice were his.  There were those who blessed the name of the Gray\nSeal, as well as those who cursed it.  And there was the Tocsin!",
        "Who was she?  He did not know, but he knew that he had come to love\nher, come to care for her, and that she had come to mean everything\nin life to him.  He had never seen her, to know her face.  He had\nnever seen her face, but he knew her voice–ay, he had even held her\nfor a moment, the moment of wildest happiness he had ever known, in\nhis arms.  That night when he had entered his library, his own\nparticular den in his own house, and in the darkness had found her\nthere–found her finally through no effort of his own, when he had\nsearched so fruitlessly for years to find her, using every resource\nat his command to find her!  And she, because she had come of her\nown volition, relying upon him, had held him in honour to let her go\nas she had come–without looking upon her face!  Exquisite irony!\nBut she had made him a promise then–that the work of the Gray Seal\nwas nearly over–that soon there would be an end to the mystery that\nsurrounded her–that he should know all–that he should know HER.",
        "He smiled again, but it was a twisted smile on the mechanically\nmisshapen lips of Larry the Bat.  NEARLY over!  Who knew?  That\n“nearly” might be too late!  Even tonight he had been shadowed, was\nskulking even now in this place as a refuge.  Who knew?  Another\nhour, and the newsboys might be shrieking their “Uxtra!  Uxtra!  De\nGray Seal caught!  De millionaire Jimmie Dale de Jekyll an’ Hyde of\nreal life!”",
        "Jimmie Dale straightened up suddenly in his seat.  There was a\nshout, an oath bawled out high above the riot of noise, a chorus of\nfeminine shrieks from across the room.  What was the matter with the\nunderworld to-night?  He seemed fated to find nothing but centres of\ndisturbance– first a raid at Chang Foo’s, and now this.  What was\nthe matter here?  They were stampeding toward him from the other\nside of the room.  There was the roar of a revolver shot–another.\nBlack Ike!  He caught an instant’s glimpse of the gunman’s distorted\nface through the crowd.  That was it probably–a row over some moll.",
        "And then, as Jimmie Dale lunged up from his chair to his feet to\nescape the rush, pandemonium itself seemed to break loose.  Yells,\nshots, screams, and oaths filled the air.  The crowd surged this way\nand that.  Tables were overturned and sent crashing to the floor.\nAnd then came sudden darkness, as some one of the attendants in\nmisguided excitability switched off the lights.",
        "The darkness but served to increase the panic, not allay it.  With a\nsavage snap of his jaws, Jimmie Dale swung from his table in the\ncorner with the intention of making his way out by a side door\nbehind him–it was a case of the police again, and the patrolman\noutside would probably be pulling a riot call by now.  And the\npolice–  He stopped suddenly, as though he had been struck.  An\nenvelope, thrust there out of the darkness, was in his hand; and her\nvoice, HERS, the Tocsin’s, was sounding in his ears:",
        "“Jimmie!  Jimmie!  I’ve been trying all evening to catch you!\nQuick!  Get to the Sanctuary and change your clothes.  There’s not\nan instant to lose!  It’s for my sake to-night!”",
        "And then a surging mob was around him on every side, and, pushing,\njostling, half lifting him at times from his feet, carried him\nforward with its rush, and with him in its midst burst through the\ndoor and out into the street.",
