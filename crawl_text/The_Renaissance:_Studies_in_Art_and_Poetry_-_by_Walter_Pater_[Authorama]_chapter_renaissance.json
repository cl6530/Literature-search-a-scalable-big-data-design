        "[vii] Many attempts have been made by writers on art and poetry to\ndefine beauty in the abstract, to express it in the most general\nterms, to find some universal formula for it.  The value of these\nattempts has most often been in the suggestive and penetrating\nthings said by the way.  Such discussions help us very little to\nenjoy what has been well done in art or poetry, to discriminate\nbetween what is more and what is less excellent in them, or to use\nwords like beauty, excellence, art, poetry, with a more precise\nmeaning than they would otherwise have.  Beauty, like all other\nqualities presented to human experience, is relative; and the\ndefinition of it becomes unmeaning and useless in proportion to\nits abstractness.  To define beauty, not in the most abstract but in\nthe most concrete terms possible, to find not its universal\nformula, but the formula which expresses most adequately this or\nthat [viii] special manifestation of it, is the aim of the true student\nof aesthetics.",
        "“To see the object as in itself it really is,” has been justly said to\nbe the aim of all true criticism whatever, and in aesthetic\ncriticism the first step towards seeing one’s object as it really is,\nis to know one’s own impression as it really is, to discriminate it,\nto realise it distinctly.  The objects with which aesthetic criticism\ndeals–music, poetry, artistic and accomplished forms of human\nlife–are indeed receptacles of so many powers or forces: they\npossess, like the products of nature, so many virtues or qualities.\nWhat is this song or picture, this engaging personality presented\nin life or in a book, to me?  What effect does it really produce on\nme?  Does it give me pleasure?  and if so, what sort or degree of\npleasure?  How is my nature modified by its presence, and under\nits influence?  The answers to these questions are the original\nfacts with which the aesthetic critic has to do; and, as in the study\nof light, of morals, of number, one must realise such primary data\nfor one’s self, or not at all.  And he who experiences these\nimpressions strongly, and drives directly at the discrimination\nand analysis of them, has no need to trouble himself with the\nabstract question what beauty is in itself, or what its exact\nrelation to truth or [ix] experience–metaphysical questions, as\nunprofitable as metaphysical questions elsewhere.  He may pass\nthem all by as being, answerable or not, of no interest to him.",
        "The aesthetic critic, then, regards all the objects with which he\nhas to do, all works of art, and the fairer forms of nature and\nhuman life, as powers or forces producing pleasurable sensations,\neach of a more or less peculiar or unique kind.  This influence he\nfeels, and wishes to explain, by analysing and reducing it to its\nelements.  To him, the picture, the landscape, the engaging\npersonality in life or in a book, La Gioconda, the hills of Carrara,\nPico of Mirandola, are valuable for their virtues, as we say, in\nspeaking of a herb, a wine, a gem; for the property each has of\naffecting one with a special, a unique, impression of pleasure.\nOur education becomes complete in proportion as our\nsusceptibility to these impressions increases in depth and variety.\nAnd the function of the aesthetic critic is to distinguish, to\nanalyse, and separate from its adjuncts, the virtue by which a\npicture, a landscape, a fair personality in life or in a book,\nproduces this special impression of beauty or pleasure, to indicate\nwhat the source of that impression is, and under what conditions\nit is experienced.  His end is reached when he has disengaged that\n[x] virtue, and noted it, as a chemist notes some natural element,\nfor himself and others; and the rule for those who would reach\nthis end is stated with great exactness in the words of a recent\ncritic of Sainte-Beuve:–De se borner a connaitre de pres les\nbelles choses, et a s’en nourrir en exquis amateurs, en\nhumanistes accomplis.",
        "What is important, then, is not that the critic should possess a\ncorrect abstract definition of beauty for the intellect, but a certain\nkind of temperament, the power of being deeply moved by the\npresence of beautiful objects.  He will remember always that\nbeauty exists in many forms.  To him all periods, types, schools\nof taste, are in themselves equal.  In all ages there have been\nsome excellent workmen, and some excellent work done.  The\nquestion he asks is always:–In whom did the stir, the genius, the\nsentiment of the period find itself?  where was the receptacle of\nits refinement, its elevation, its taste?  “The ages are all equal,\"\nsays William Blake, “but genius is always above its age.”",
        "Often it will require great nicety to disengage this virtue from the\ncommoner elements with which it may be found in combination.\nFew artists, not Goethe or Byron even, work quite cleanly,\ncasting off all debris, and leaving us only what the heat of their\nimagination has wholly [xi] fused and transformed.  Take, for\ninstance, the writings of Wordsworth.  The heat of his genius,\nentering into the substance of his work, has crystallised a part,\nbut only a part, of it; and in that great mass of verse there is much\nwhich might well be forgotten.  But scattered up and down it,\nsometimes fusing and transforming entire compositions, like the\nStanzas on Resolution and Independence, or the Ode on the\nRecollections of Childhood, sometimes, as if at random,\ndepositing a fine crystal here or there, in a matter it does not\nwholly search through and transmute, we trace the action of his\nunique, incommunicable faculty, that strange, mystical sense of a\nlife in natural things, and of man’s life as a part of nature,\ndrawing strength and colour and character from local influences,\nfrom the hills and streams, and from natural sights and sounds.\nWell!  that is the virtue, the active principle in Wordsworth’s\npoetry; and then the function of the critic of Wordsworth is to\nfollow up that active principle, to disengage it, to mark the degree\nin which it penetrates his verse.",
        "The subjects of the following studies are taken from the history\nof the Renaissance, and touch what I think the chief points in that\ncomplex, many-sided movement.  I have explained in the first of\nthem what I understand by the word, [xii] giving it a much wider\nscope than was intended by those who originally used it to denote\nthat revival of classical antiquity in the fifteenth century which\nwas only one of many results of a general excitement and\nenlightening of the human mind, but of which the great aim and\nachievements of what, as Christian art, is often falsely opposed to\nthe Renaissance, were another result.  This outbreak of the human\nspirit may be traced far into the middle age itself, with its motives\nalready clearly pronounced, the care for physical beauty, the\nworship of the body, the breaking down of those limits which the\nreligious system of the middle age imposed on the heart and the\nimagination.  I have taken as an example of this movement, this\nearlier Renaissance within the middle age itself, and as an\nexpression of its qualities, two little compositions in early\nFrench; not because they constitute the best possible expression\nof them, but because they help the unity of my series, inasmuch\nas the Renaissance ends also in France, in French poetry, in a\nphase of which the writings of Joachim du Bellay are in many\nways the most perfect illustration.  The Renaissance, in truth, put\nforth in France an aftermath, a wonderful later growth, the\nproducts of which have to the full that subtle and delicate\nsweetness which belongs to a refined and comely [xiii]\ndecadence, just as its earliest phases have the freshness which\nbelongs to all periods of growth in art, the charm of ascesis, of\nthe austere and serious girding of the loins in youth.",
        "But it is in Italy, in the fifteenth century, that the interest of the\nRenaissance mainly lies,–in that solemn fifteenth century which\ncan hardly be studied too much, not merely for its positive results\nin the things of the intellect and the imagination, its concrete\nworks of art, its special and prominent personalities, with their\nprofound aesthetic charm, but for its general spirit and character,\nfor the ethical qualities of which it is a consummate type.",
        "The various forms of intellectual activity which together make\nup the culture of an age, move for the most part from different\nstarting-points, and by unconnected roads.  As products of the\nsame generation they partake indeed of a common character, and\nunconsciously illustrate each other; but of the producers\nthemselves, each group is solitary, gaining what advantage or\ndisadvantage there may be in intellectual isolation.  Art and\npoetry, philosophy and the religious life, and that other life of\nrefined pleasure and action in the conspicuous places of the\nworld, are each of them confined to its own circle of ideas, and\nthose who prosecute either of them are generally little [xiv]\ncurious of the thoughts of others.  There come, however, from\ntime to time, eras of more favourable conditions, in which the\nthoughts of men draw nearer together than is their wont, and the\nmany interests of the intellectual world combine in one complete\ntype of general culture.  The fifteenth century in Italy is one of\nthese happier eras, and what is sometimes said of the age of\nPericles is true of that of Lorenzo:–it is an age productive in\npersonalities, many-sided, centralised, complete.  Here, artists\nand philosophers and those whom the action of the world has\nelevated and made keen, do not live in isolation, but breathe a\ncommon air, and catch light and heat from each other’s thoughts.\nThere is a spirit of general elevation and enlightenment in which\nall alike communicate.  The unity of this spirit gives unity to all\nthe various products of the Renaissance; and it is to this intimate\nalliance with the mind, this participation in the best thoughts\nwhich that age produced, that the art of Italy in the fifteenth\ncentury owes much of its grave dignity and influence.",
        "I have added an essay on Winckelmann, as not incongruous with\nthe studies which precede it, because Winckelmann, coming in\nthe eighteenth century, really belongs in spirit to an earlier age.\nBy his enthusiasm for the things of the intellect [xv] and the\nimagination for their own sake, by his Hellenism, his life-long\nstruggle to attain the Greek spirit, he is in sympathy with the\nhumanists of a previous century.  He is the last fruit of the\nRenaissance, and explains in a striking way its motive and\ntendencies.",

        "[1] THE history of the Renaissance ends in France, and carries us\naway from Italy to the beautiful cities of the country of the Loire.\nBut it was in France also, in a very important sense, that the\nRenaissance had begun.  French writers, who are fond of\nconnecting the creations of Italian genius with a French origin,\nwho tell us how Saint Francis of Assisi took not his name only,\nbut all those notions of chivalry and romantic love which so\ndeeply penetrated his thoughts, from a French source, how\nBoccaccio borrowed the outlines of his stories from the old\nFrench fabliaux, and how Dante himself expressly connects the\norigin of the art of miniature-painting with the city of Paris, have\noften dwelt on this notion of a Renaissance in the end of the\ntwelfth and the beginning of the thirteenth century, a Renaissance\nwithin the limits of the middle age itself–a brilliant, but in part\nabortive effort to do for human life and the human mind what\nwas afterwards done in the fifteenth.  The word Renaissance,\nindeed, is now generally used to denote not [2] merely the revival\nof classical antiquity which took place in the fifteenth century,\nand to which the word was first applied, but a whole complex\nmovement, of which that revival of classical antiquity was but\none element or symptom.  For us the Renaissance is the name of\na many-sided but yet united movement, in which the love of the\nthings of the intellect and the imagination for their own sake, the\ndesire for a more liberal and comely way of conceiving life, make\nthemselves felt, urging those who experience this desire to search\nout first one and then another means of intellectual or imaginative\nenjoyment, and directing them not only to the discovery of old\nand forgotten sources of this enjoyment, but to the divination of\nfresh sources thereof–new experiences, new subjects of poetry,\nnew forms of art.  Of such feeling there was a great outbreak in\nthe end of the twelfth and the beginning of the following century.\nHere and there, under rare and happy conditions, in Pointed\narchitecture, in the doctrines of romantic love, in the poetry of\nProvence, the rude strength of the middle age turns to sweetness;\nand the taste for sweetness generated there becomes the seed of\nthe classical revival in it, prompting it constantly to seek after the\nsprings of perfect sweetness in the Hellenic world.  And coming\nafter a long period in which this instinct had been crushed, that\ntrue “dark age,” in which so many sources of  intellectual and\nimaginative enjoyment had [3] actually disappeared, this\noutbreak is rightly called a Renaissance, a revival.",
        "Theories which bring into connexion with each other modes of\nthought and feeling, periods of taste, forms of art and poetry,\nwhich the narrowness of men’s minds constantly tends to oppose\nto each other, have a great stimulus for the intellect, and are\nalmost always worth understanding.  It is so with this theory of a\nRenaissance within the middle age, which seeks to establish a\ncontinuity between the most characteristic work of that period,\nthe sculpture of Chartres, the windows of Le Mans, and the work\nof the later Renaissance, the work of Jean Cousin and Germain\nPilon, thus healing that rupture between the middle age and the\nRenaissance which has so often been exaggerated.  But it is not\nso much the ecclesiastical art of the middle age, its sculpture and\npainting–work certainly done in a great measure for pleasure’s\nsake, in which even a secular, a rebellious spirit often betrays\nitself–but rather its profane poetry, the poetry of Provence, and\nthe magnificent after-growth of that poetry in Italy and France,\nwhich those French writers have in view when they speak of this\nmedieval Renaissance.  In that poetry, earthly passion, with its\nintimacy, its freedom, its variety–the liberty of the heart–makes\nitself felt; and the name of Abelard, the great scholar and the\ngreat lover, connects the expression of this liberty of heart with\nthe free [4] play of human intelligence around all subjects\npresented to it, with the liberty of the intellect, as that age\nunderstood it.",
        "Every one knows the legend of Abelard, a legend hardly less\npassionate, certainly not less characteristic of the middle age,\nthan the legend of Tannhauser; how the famous and comely\nclerk, in whom Wisdom herself, self-possessed, pleasant, and\ndiscreet, seemed to sit enthroned, came to live in the house of a\ncanon of the church of Notre-Dame, where dwelt a girl, Heloise,\nbelieved to be the old priest’s orphan niece; how the old priest\nhad testified his love for her by giving her an education then\nunrivalled, so that rumour asserted that, through the knowledge\nof languages, enabling her to penetrate into the mysteries of the\nolder world, she had become a sorceress, like the Celtic\ndruidesses; and how as Abelard and Heloise sat together at home\nthere, to refine a little further on the nature of abstract ideas,\n\"Love made himself of the party with them.”  You conceive the\ntemptations of the scholar, who, in such dreamy tranquillity, amid\nthe bright and busy spectacle of the “Island,” lived in a world of\nsomething like shadows; and that for one who knew so well how\nto assign its exact value to every abstract thought, those restraints\nwhich lie on the consciences of other men had been relaxed.  It\nappears that he composed many verses in the vulgar tongue:\nalready the young men sang them on the quay below the house.\nThose songs, says M. de Remusat, [5] were probably in the taste\nof the Trouveres, “of whom he was one of the first in date, or, so\nto speak, the predecessor.”  It is the same spirit which has\nmoulded the famous “letters,” written in the quaint Latin of the\nmiddle age.",
        "At the foot of that early Gothic tower, which the next generation\nraised to grace the precincts of Abelard’s school, on the\n\"Mountain of Saint Genevieve,” the historian Michelet sees in\nthought “a terrible assembly; not the hearers of Abelard alone,\nfifty bishops, twenty cardinals, two popes, the whole body of\nscholastic philosophy; not only the learned Heloise, the teaching\nof languages, and the Renaissance; but Arnold of Brescia–that is\nto say, the revolution.”  And so from the rooms of this shadowy\nhouse by the Seine side we see that spirit going abroad, with its\nqualities already well defined, its intimacy, its languid sweetness,\nits rebellion, its subtle skill in dividing the elements of human\npassion, its care for physical beauty, its worship of the body,\nwhich penetrated the early literature of Italy, and finds an echo\neven in Dante.",
        "That Abelard is not mentioned in the Divine Comedy may appear\na singular omission to the reader of Dante, who seems to have\ninwoven into the texture of his work whatever had impressed him\nas either effective in colour or spiritually significant among the\nrecorded incidents of actual life.  Nowhere in his great poem do\nwe find the name, nor so much as an allusion to the story of [6]\none who had left so deep a mark on the philosophy of which\nDante was an eager student, of whom in the Latin Quarter, and\nfrom the lips of scholar or teacher in the University of Paris,\nduring his sojourn among them, he can hardly have failed to hear.\nWe can only suppose that he had indeed considered the story and\nthe man, and abstained from passing judgment as to his place in\nthe scheme of “eternal justice.”",
        "In the famous legend of Tannhauser, the erring knight makes his\nway to Rome, to seek absolution at the centre of Christian\nreligion.  “So soon,” thought and said the Pope, “as the staff in\nhis hand should bud and blossom, so soon might the soul of\nTannhauser be saved, and no sooner\"; and it came to pass not\nlong after that the dry wood of a staff which the Pope had carried\nin his hand was covered with leaves and flowers.  So, in the\ncloister of Godstow, a petrified tree was shown of which the nuns\ntold that the fair Rosamond, who had died among them, had\ndeclared that, the tree being then alive and green, it would be\nchanged into stone at the hour of her salvation.  When Abelard\ndied, like Tannhauser, he was on his way to Rome.  What might\nhave happened had he reached his journey’s end is uncertain; and\nit is in this uncertain twilight that his relation to the general\nbeliefs of his age has always remained.  In this, as in other things,\nhe prefigures the character of the Renaissance, that movement in\n[7] which, in various ways, the human mind wins for itself a new\nkingdom of feeling and sensation and thought, not opposed to but\nonly beyond and independent of the spiritual system then actually\nrealised.  The opposition into which Abelard is thrown, which\ngives its colour to his career, which breaks his soul to pieces, is a\nno less subtle opposition than that between the merely\nprofessional, official, hireling ministers of that system, with their\nignorant worship of system for its own sake, and the true child of\nlight, the humanist, with reason and heart and senses quick, while\ntheirs were almost dead.  He reaches out towards, he attains,\nmodes of ideal living, beyond the prescribed limits of that\nsystem, though in essential germ, it may be, contained within it.\nAs always happens, the adherents of the poorer and narrower\nculture had no sympathy with, because no understanding of, a\nculture richer and more ample than their own.  After the\ndiscovery of wheat they would still live upon acorns–apres\nl’invention du ble ils voulaient encore vivre du gland; and would\nhear of no service to the higher needs of humanity with\ninstruments not of their forging.",
        "But the human spirit, bold through those needs, was too strong\nfor them.  Abelard and Heloise write their letters–letters with a\nwonderful outpouring of soul–in medieval Latin; and Abelard,\nthough he composes songs in the vulgar tongue, writes also in\nLatin those [8] treatises in which he tries to find a ground of\nreality below the abstractions of philosophy, as one bent on\ntrying all things by their congruity with human experience, who\nhad felt the hand of Heloise, and looked into her eyes, and tested\nthe resources of humanity in her great and energetic nature.  Yet\nit is only a little later, early in the thirteenth century, that French\nprose romance begins; and in one of the pretty volumes of the\nBibliotheque Elzevirienne some of the most striking fragments of\nit may be found, edited with much intelligence.  In one of these\nthirteenth-century stories, Li Amitiez de Ami et Amile, that free\nplay of human affection, of the claims of which Abelard’s story is\nan assertion, makes itself felt in the incidents of a great\nfriendship, a friendship pure and generous, pushed to a sort of\npassionate exaltation, and more than faithful unto death.  Such\ncomradeship, though instances of it are to be found everywhere,\nis still especially a classical motive; Chaucer expressing the\nsentiment of it so strongly in an antique tale, that one knows not\nwhether the love of both Palamon and Arcite for Emelya, or of\nthose two for each other, is the chiefer subject of the Knight’s\nTale–",
        "What reader does not refer something of the [9] bitterness of that\ncry to the spoiling, already foreseen, of the fair friendship, which\nhad made the prison of the two lads sweet hitherto with its daily\noffices?",
        "The friendship of Amis and Amile is deepened by the romantic\ncircumstance of an entire personal resemblance between the two\nheroes, through which they pass for each other again and again,\nand thereby into many strange adventures; that curious interest of\nthe Doppelganger, which begins among the stars with the\nDioscuri, being entwined in and out through all the incidents of\nthe story, like an outward token of the inward similitude of their\nsouls.  With this, again, is connected, like a second reflection of\nthat inward similitude, the conceit of two marvellously beautiful\ncups, also exactly like each other–children’s cups, of wood, but\nadorned with gold and precious stones.  These two cups, which\nby their resemblance help to bring the friends together at critical\nmoments, were given to them by the Pope, when he baptized\nthem at Rome, whither the parents had taken them for that\npurpose, in gratitude for their birth.  They cross and recross very\nstrangely in the narrative, serving the two heroes almost like\nliving things, and with that well-known effect of a beautiful\nobject, kept constantly before the eye in a story or poem, of\nkeeping sensation well awake, and giving a certain air of\nrefinement to all the scenes into which it enters.  That sense of\nfate, which [10] hangs so much of the shaping of human life on\ntrivial objects, like Othello’s strawberry handkerchief, is thereby\nheightened, while witness is borne to the enjoyment of beautiful\nhandiwork by primitive people, their simple wonder at it, so that\nthey give it an oddly significant place among the factors of a\nhuman history.",
        "Amis and Amile, then, are true to their comradeship through all\ntrials; and in the end it comes to pass that at a moment of great\nneed Amis takes the place of Amile in a tournament for life or\ndeath.  “After this it happened that a leprosy fell upon Amis, so\nthat his wife would not approach him, and wrought to strangle\nhim.  He departed therefore from his home, and at last prayed his\nservants to carry him to the house of Amile\"; and it is in what\nfollows that the curious strength of the piece shows itself:–",
        "“His servants, willing to do as he commanded, carried him to the\nplace where Amile was; and they began to sound their rattles\nbefore the court of Amile’s house, as lepers are accustomed to\ndo.  And when Amile heard the noise he commanded one of his\nservants to carry meat and bread to the sick man, and the cup\nwhich was given to him at Rome filled with good wine.  And\nwhen the servant had done as he was commanded, he returned\nand said, Sir, if I had not thy cup in my hand, I should believe\nthat the cup which the sick man has was thine, for they are alike,\nthe [11] one to the other, in height and fashion.  And Amile said,\nGo quickly and bring him to me.  And when Amis stood before\nhis comrade Amile demanded of him who he was, and how he\nhad gotten that cup.  I am of Briquain le Chastel, answered Amis,\nand the cup was given to me by the Bishop of Rome, who\nbaptized me.  And when Amile heard that, he knew that it was his\ncomrade Amis, who had delivered him from death, and won for\nhim the daughter of the King of France to be his wife.  And\nstraightway he fell upon him, and began weeping greatly, and\nkissed him.  And when his wife heard that, she ran out with her\nhair in disarray, weeping and distressed exceedingly, for she\nremembered that it was he who had slain the false Ardres.  And\nthereupon they placed him in a fair bed, and said to him, Abide\nwith us until God’s will be accomplished in thee, for all we have\nis at thy service.  So he and the two servants abode with them.",
        "“And it came to pass one night, when Amis and Amile lay in one\nchamber without other companions, that God sent His angel\nRaphael to Amis, who said to him, Amis, art thou asleep?  And\nhe, supposing that Amile had called him, answered and said, I am\nnot asleep, fair comrade!  And the angel said to him, Thou hast\nanswered well, for thou art the comrade of the heavenly citizens.-\n-I am Raphael, the angel of our Lord, and am come to tell thee\nhow thou mayest be [12] healed; for thy prayers are heard.  Thou\nshalt bid Amile, thy comrade, that he slay his two children and\nwash thee in their blood, and so thy body shall be made whole.\nAnd Amis said to him, Let not this thing be, that my comrade\nshould become a murderer for my sake.  But the angel said, It is\nconvenient that he do this.  And thereupon the angel departed.",
        "“And Amile also, as if in sleep, heard those words; and he awoke\nand said, Who is it, my comrade, that hath spoken with thee?\nAnd Amis answered, No man; only I have prayed to our Lord, as\nI am accustomed.  And Amile said, Not so!  but some one hath\nspoken with thee.  Then he arose and went to the door of the\nchamber; and finding it shut he said, Tell me, my brother, who it\nwas said those words to thee to-night.  And Amis began to weep\ngreatly, and told him that it was Raphael, the angel of the Lord,\nwho had said to him, Amis, our Lord commands thee that thou\nbid Amile slay his two children, and wash thee in their blood, and\nso thou shalt be healed of thy leprosy.  And Amile was greatly\ndisturbed at those words, and said, I would have given to thee my\nman-servants and my maid-servants and all my goods, and thou\nfeignest that an angel hath spoken to thee that I should slay my\ntwo children.  And immediately Amis began to weep, and said, I\nknow that I have spoken to thee a terrible thing, but constrained\nthereto; I pray thee cast me not away [13] from the shelter of thy\nhouse.  And Amile answered that what he had covenanted with\nhim, that he would perform, unto the hour of his death: But I\nconjure thee, said he, by the faith which there is between me and\nthee, and by our comradeship, and by the baptism we received\ntogether at Rome, that thou tell me whether it was man or angel\nsaid that to thee.  And Amis answered again, So truly as an angel\nhath spoken to me this night, so may God deliver me from my\ninfirmity!",
        "“Then Amile began to weep in secret, and thought within\nhimself: If this man was ready to die before the king for me, shall\nI not for him slay my children?  Shall I not keep faith with him\nwho was faithful to me even unto death?  And Amile tarried no\nlonger, but departed to the chamber of his wife, and bade her go\nhear the Sacred Office.  And he took a sword, and went to the bed\nwhere the children were lying, and found them asleep.  And he\nlay down over them and began to weep bitterly and said, Hath\nany man yet heard of a father who of his own will slew his\nchildren?  Alas, my children!  I am no longer your father, but\nyour cruel murderer.",
        "“And the children awoke at the tears of their father, which fell\nupon them; and they looked up into his face and began to laugh.\nAnd as they were of the age of about three years, he said, Your\nlaughing will be turned into tears, for your innocent blood must\nnow be shed, [14] and therewith he cut off their heads.  Then he\nlaid them back in the bed, and put the heads upon the bodies, and\ncovered them as though they slept: and with the blood which he\nhad taken he washed his comrade, and said, Lord Jesus Christ!\nwho hast commanded men to keep faith on earth, and didst heal\nthe leper by Thy word!  cleanse now my comrade, for whose love\nI have shed the blood of my children.",
        "“Then Amis was cleansed of his leprosy.  And Amile clothed his\ncompanion in his best robes; and as they went to the church to\ngive thanks, the bells, by the will of God, rang of their own\naccord.  And when the people of the city heard that, they ran\ntogether to see the marvel.  And the wife of Amile, when she saw\nAmis and Amile coming, asked which of the twain was her\nhusband, and said, I know well the vesture of them both, but I\nknow not which of them is Amile.  And Amile said to her, I am\nAmile, and my companion is Amis, who is healed of his sickness.\nAnd she was full of wonder, and desired to know in what manner\nhe was healed.  Give thanks to our Lord, answered Amile, but\ntrouble not thyself as to the manner of the healing.",
        "“Now neither the father nor the mother had yet entered where the\nchildren were; but the father sighed heavily, because they were\ndead, and the mother asked for them, that they might rejoice\ntogether; but Amile said, Dame!  let [15] the children sleep.  And\nit was already the hour of Tierce.  And going in alone to the\nchildren to weep over them, he found them at play in the bed;\nonly, in the place of the sword-cuts about their throats was as it\nwere a thread of crimson.  And he took them in his arms and\ncarried them to his wife and said, Rejoice greatly, for thy children\nwhom I had slain by the commandment of the angel are alive,\nand by their blood is Amis healed.”",
        "There, as I said, is the strength of the old French story.  For the\nRenaissance has not only the sweetness which it derives from the\nclassical world, but also that curious strength of which there are\ngreat resources in the true middle age.  And as I have illustrated\nthe early strength of the Renaissance by the story of Amis and\nAmile, a story which comes from the North, in which a certain\nracy Teutonic flavour is perceptible, so I shall illustrate that other\nelement, its early sweetness, a languid excess of sweetness even,\nby another story printed in the same volume of the Bibliotheque\nElzevirienne, and of about the same date, a story which comes,\ncharacteristically, from the South, and connects itself with the\nliterature of Provence.",
        "The central love-poetry of Provence, the poetry of the Tenson and\nthe Aubade, of Bernard de Ventadour and Pierre Vidal, is poetry\nfor the few, for the elect and peculiar people of the [16] kingdom\nof sentiment.  But below this intenser poetry there was probably a\nwide range of literature, less serious and elevated, reaching, by\nlightness of form and comparative homeliness of interest, an\naudience which the concentrated passion of those higher lyrics\nleft untouched.  This literature has long since perished, or lives\nonly in later French or Italian versions.  One such version, the\nonly representative of its species, M. Fauriel thought he detected\nin the story of Aucassin and Nicolette, written in the French of\nthe latter half of the thirteenth century, and preserved in a unique\nmanuscript, in the national library of Paris; and there were\nreasons which made him divine for it a still more ancient\nancestry, traces in it of an Arabian origin, as in a leaf lost out of\nsome early Arabian Nights.*  The little book loses none of its\ninterest through the criticism which finds in it only a traditional\nsubject, handed on by one people to another; for after passing\nthus from hand to hand, its outline is still clear, its surface\nuntarnished; and, like many other stories, books, literary and\nartistic conceptions of the middle age, it has come to [17] have in\nthis way a sort of personal history, almost as full of risk and\nadventure as that of its own heroes.  The writer himself calls the\npiece a cantefable, a tale told in prose, but with its incidents and\nsentiment helped forward by songs, inserted at irregular intervals.\nIn the junctions of the story itself there are signs of roughness and\nwant of skill, which make one suspect that the prose was only put\ntogether to connect a series of songs–a series of songs so moving\nand attractive that people wished to heighten and dignify their\neffect by a regular framework or setting.  Yet the songs\nthemselves are of the simplest kind, not rhymed even, but only\nimperfectly assonant, stanzas of twenty or thirty lines apiece, all\nending with a similar vowel sound.  And here, as elsewhere in\nthat early poetry, much of the interest lies in the spectacle of the\nformation of a new artistic sense.  A novel art is arising, the\nmusic of rhymed poetry, and in the songs of Aucassin and\nNicolette, which seem always on the point of passing into true\nrhyme, but which halt somehow, and can never quite take flight,\nyou see people just growing aware of the elements of a new\nmusic in their possession, and anticipating how pleasant such\nmusic might become.",
        "The piece was probably intended to be recited by a company of\ntrained performers, many of whom, at least for the lesser parts,\nwere probably children.  The songs are introduced by the rubric,\n[18] Or se cante (ici on chante); and each division of prose by\nthe rubric, Or dient et content et fabloient (ici on conte).  The\nmusical notes of a portion of the songs have been preserved; and\nsome of the details are so descriptive that they suggested to M.\nFauriel the notion that the words had been accompanied\nthroughout by dramatic action.  That mixture of simplicity and\nrefinement which he was surprised to find in a composition of the\nthirteenth century, is shown sometimes in the turn given to some\npassing expression or remark; thus, “the Count de Garins was old\nand frail, his time was over\"–Li quens Garins de Beaucaire\nestoit vix et frales; si avoit son tans trespasse.  And then, all is so\nrealised!  One sees the ancient forest, with its disused roads\ngrown deep with grass, and the place where seven roads meet–u\na forkeut set cemin qui s’en vont par le pais; we hear the light-\nhearted country people calling each other by their rustic names,\nand putting forward, as their spokesman, one among them who is\nmore eloquent and ready than the rest–li un qui plus fu enparles\ndes autres; for the little book has its burlesque element also, so\nthat one hears the faint, far-off laughter still.  Rough as it is, the\npiece certainly possesses this high quality of poetry, that it aims\nat a purely artistic effect.  Its subject is a great sorrow, yet it\nclaims to be a thing of joy and refreshment, to be entertained not\nfor its matter only, but chiefly for its manner, it is cortois, it tells\nus, et bien assis.",
        "[19] For the student of manners, and of the old French language\nand literature, it has much interest of a purely antiquarian order.\nTo say of an ancient literary composition that it has an\nantiquarian interest, often means that it has no distinct aesthetic\ninterest for the reader of to-day.  Antiquarianism, by a purely\nhistorical effort, by putting its object in perspective, and setting\nthe reader in a certain point of view, from which what gave\npleasure to the past is pleasurable for him also, may often add\ngreatly to the charm we receive from ancient literature.  But the\nfirst condition of such aid must be a real, direct, aesthetic charm\nin the thing itself.  Unless it has that charm, unless some purely\nartistic quality went to its original making, no merely antiquarian\neffort can ever give it an aesthetic value, or make it a proper\nsubject of aesthetic criticism.  This quality, wherever it exists, it\nis always pleasant to define, and discriminate from the sort of\nborrowed interest which an old play, or an old story, may very\nlikely acquire through a true antiquarianism.  The story of\nAucassin and Nicolette has something of this quality.  Aucassin,\nthe only son of Count Garins of Beaucaire, is passionately in love\nwith Nicolette, a beautiful girl of unknown parentage, bought of\nthe Saracens, whom his father will not permit him to marry.  The\nstory turns on the adventures of these two lovers, until at the end\nof the piece their mutual fidelity is rewarded.  These [20]\nadventures are of the simplest sort, adventures which seem to be\nchosen for the happy occasion they afford of keeping the eye of\nthe fancy, perhaps the outward eye, fixed on pleasant objects, a\ngarden, a ruined tower, the little hut of flowers which Nicolette\nconstructs in the forest whither she escapes from her enemies, as\na token to Aucassin that she has passed that way.  All the charm\nof the piece is in its details, in a turn of peculiar lightness and\ngrace given to the situations and traits of sentiment, especially in\nits quaint fragments of early French prose.",
        "All through it one feels the influence of that faint air of\noverwrought delicacy, almost of wantonness, which was so\nstrong a characteristic of the poetry of the Troubadours.  The\nTroubadours themselves were often men of great rank; they\nwrote for an exclusive audience, people of much leisure and great\nrefinement, and they came to value a type of personal beauty\nwhich has in it but little of the influence of the open air and\nsunshine.  There is a languid Eastern deliciousness in the very\nscenery of the story, the full-blown roses, the chamber painted in\nsome mysterious manner where Nicolette is imprisoned, the cool\nbrown marble, the almost nameless colours, the odour of plucked\ngrass and flowers.  Nicolette herself well becomes this scenery,\nand is the best illustration of the quality I mean–the beautiful,\nweird, foreign girl, whom the [21] shepherds take for a fay, who\nhas the knowledge of simples, the healing and beautifying\nqualities of leaves and flowers, whose skilful touch heals\nAucassin’s sprained shoulder, so that he suddenly leaps from the\nground; the mere sight of whose white flesh, as she passed the\nplace where he lay, healed a pilgrim stricken with sore disease, so\nthat he rose up, and returned to his own country.  With this girl\nAucassin is so deeply in love that he forgets all knightly duties.\nAt last Nicolette is shut up to get her out of his way, and perhaps\nthe prettiest passage in the whole piece is the fragment of prose\nwhich describes her escape:–",
        "“Aucassin was put in prison, as you have heard, and Nicolette\nremained shut up in her chamber.  It was summer-time, in the\nmonth of May, when the days are warm and long and clear, and\nthe nights coy and serene.",
        "“One night Nicolette, lying on her bed, saw the moon shine clear\nthrough the little window, and heard the nightingale sing in the\ngarden, and then came the memory of Aucassin, whom she so\nmuch loved.  She thought of the Count Garins of Beaucaire, who\nmortally hated her, and, to be rid of her, might at any moment\ncause her to be burned or drowned.  She perceived that the old\nwoman who kept her company was asleep; she rose and put on\nthe fairest gown she had; she took the bed-clothes [22] and the\ntowels, and knotted them together like a cord, as far as they\nwould go.  Then she tied the end to a pillar of the window, and let\nherself slip down quite softly into the garden, and passed straight\nacross it, to reach the town.",
        "“Her hair was yellow in small curls, her smiling eyes blue-green,\nher face clear and feat, the little lips very red, the teeth small and\nwhite; and the daisies which she crushed in passing, holding her\nskirt high behind and before, looked dark against her feet; the girl\nwas so white!",
        "“She came to the garden-gate and opened it, and walked through\nthe streets of Beaucaire, keeping on the dark side of the way to be\nout of the light of the moon, which shone quietly in the sky.  She\nwalked as fast as she could, until she came to the tower where\nAucassin was.  The tower was set about with pillars, here and\nthere.  She pressed herself against one of the pillars, wrapped\nherself closely in her mantle, and putting her face to a chink of\nthe tower, which was old and ruined, she heard Aucassin crying\nbitterly within, and when she had listened awhile she began to\nspeak.”",
        "But scattered up and down through this lighter matter, always\ntinged with humour and often passing into burlesque, which\nmakes up the general substance of the piece, there are morsels of\na different quality, touches of some intenser sentiment, coming it\nwould seem from [23] the profound and energetic spirit of the\nProvencal poetry itself, to which the inspiration of the book has\nbeen referred.  Let me gather up these morsels of deeper colour,\nthese expressions of the ideal intensity of love, the motive which\nreally unites together the fragments of the little composition.\nDante, the perfect flower of ideal love, has recorded how the\ntyranny of that “Lord of terrible aspect” became actually\nphysical, blinding his senses, and suspending his bodily forces.\nIn this, Dante is but the central expression and type of\nexperiences known well enough to the initiated, in that passionate\nage.  Aucassin represents this ideal intensity of passion–",
        "the slim, tall, debonair, dansellon, as the singers call him, with\nhis curled yellow hair, and eyes of vair, who faints with love, as\nDante fainted, who rides all day through the forest in search of\nNicolette, while the thorns tear his flesh, so that one might have\ntraced him by the blood upon the grass, and who weeps at\neventide because he has not found her, who has the malady of his\nlove, and neglects all knightly duties.  Once he is induced to put\nhimself at the head of his people, that they, seeing him before\nthem, might have more heart to defend themselves; then a song\nrelates how the sweet, grave figure goes forth to battle, in dainty,\ntight-laced [24] armour.  It is the very image of the Provencal\nlove-god, no longer a child, but grown to pensive youth, as Pierre\nVidal met him, riding on a white horse, fair as the morning, his\nvestment embroidered with flowers.  He rode on through the\ngates into the open plain beyond.  But as he went, that great\nmalady of his love came upon him.  The bridle fell from his\nhands; and like one who sleeps walking, he was carried on into\nthe midst of his enemies, and heard them talking together how\nthey might most conveniently kill him.",
        "One of the strongest characteristics of that outbreak of the reason\nand the imagination, of that assertion of the liberty of the heart, in\nthe middle age, which I have termed a medieval Renaissance,\nwas its antinomianism, its spirit of rebellion and revolt against\nthe moral and religious ideas of the time.  In their search after the\npleasures of the senses and the imagination, in their care for\nbeauty, in their worship of the body, people were impelled\nbeyond the bounds of the Christian ideal; and their love became\nsometimes a strange idolatry, a strange rival religion.  It was the\nreturn of that ancient Venus, not dead, but only hidden for a time\nin the caves of the Venusberg, of those old pagan gods still going\nto and fro on the earth, under all sorts of disguises.  And this\nelement in the middle age, for the most part ignored by those\nwriters who have treated it pre-eminently as the [25] “Age of\nFaith\"–this rebellious and antinomian element, the recognition of\nwhich has made the delineation of the middle age by the writers\nof the Romantic school in France, by Victor Hugo for instance in\nNotre-Dame de Paris, so suggestive and exciting–is found alike\nin the history of Abelard and the legend of Tannhauser.  More\nand more, as we come to mark changes and distinctions of temper\nin what is often in one all-embracing confusion called the middle\nage, that rebellion, that sinister claim for liberty of heart and\nthought, comes to the surface.  The Albigensian movement,\nconnected so strangely with the history of Provencal poetry, is\ndeeply tinged with it.  A touch of it makes the Franciscan order,\nwith its poetry, its mysticism, its “illumination,” from the point of\nview of religious authority, justly suspect.  It influences the\nthoughts of those obscure prophetical writers, like Joachim of\nFlora, strange dreamers in a world of flowery rhetoric of that\nthird and final dispensation of a “spirit of freedom,” in which law\nshall have passed away.  Of this spirit Aucassin and Nicolette\ncontains perhaps the most famous expression: it is the answer\nAucassin gives when he is threatened with the pains of hell, if he\nmakes Nicolette his mistress.  A creature wholly of affection and\nthe senses, he sees on the way to paradise only a feeble and worn-\nout company of aged priests, “clinging day and night to the\nchapel altars,” barefoot or [26] in patched sandals.  With or even\nwithout Nicolette, “his sweet mistress whom he so much loves,\"\nhe, for his part, is ready to start on the way to hell, along with\n\"the good scholars,” as he says, and the actors, and the fine\nhorsemen dead in battle, and the men of fashion,* and “the fair\ncourteous ladies who had two or three chevaliers apiece beside\ntheir own true lords,” all gay with music, in their gold, and silver,\nand beautiful furs–\"the vair and the grey.”",
        "But in the House Beautiful the saints too have their place; and the\nstudent of the Renaissance has this advantage over the student of\nthe emancipation of the human mind in the Reformation, or the\nFrench Revolution, that in tracing the footsteps of humanity to\nhigher levels, he is not beset at every turn by the inflexibilities\nand antagonisms of some well-recognised controversy, with\nrigidly defined opposites, exhausting the intelligence and limiting\none’s sympathies.  The opposition of the professional defenders\nof a mere system to that more sincere and generous play of the\nforces of human mind and character, which I have noted as the\nsecret of Abelard’s struggle, is indeed always powerful.  But the\nincompatibility with one another of souls really “fair” is not\nessential; and within the enchanted region of the Renaissance,\none needs not be for ever on [27] one’s guard.  Here there are no\nfixed parties, no exclusions: all breathes of that unity of culture in\nwhich whatsoever things are comely” are reconciled, for the\nelevation and adorning of our spirits.  And just in proportion as\nthose who took part in the Renaissance become centrally\nrepresentative of it, just so much the more is this condition\nrealised in them.  The wicked popes, and the loveless tyrants,\nwho from time to time became its patrons, or mere speculators in\nits fortunes, lend themselves easily to disputations, and, from this\nside or that, the spirit of controversy lays just hold upon them.\nBut the painter of the Last Supper, with his kindred, lives in a\nland where controversy has no breathing-place.  They refuse to\nbe classified.  In the story of Aucassin and Nicolette, in the\nliterature which it represents, the note of defiance, of the\nopposition of one system to another, is sometimes harsh.  Let me\nconclude then with a morsel from Amis and Amile, in which the\nharmony of human interests is still entire.  For the story of the\ngreat traditional friendship, in which, as I said, the liberty of the\nheart makes itself felt, seems, as we have it, to have been written\nby a monk–La vie des saints martyrs Amis et Amile.  It was not\ntill the end of the seventeenth century that their names were\nfinally excluded from the martyrology; and their story ends with\nthis monkish miracle of earthly comradeship, more than faithful\nunto death:–",
        "[28] “For, as God had united them in their lives in one accord, so\nthey were not divided in their death, falling together side by side,\nwith a host of other brave men, in battle for King Charles at\nMortara, so called from that great slaughter.  And the bishops\ngave counsel to the king and queen that they should bury the\ndead, and build a church in that place; and their counsel pleased\nthe king greatly.  And there were built two churches, the one by\ncommandment of the king in honour of Saint Oseige, and the\nother by commandment of the queen in honour of Saint Peter.",
        "“And the king caused the two chests of stone to be brought in the\nwhich the bodies of Amis and Amile lay; and Amile was carried\nto the church of Saint Peter, and Amis to the church of Saint\nOseige; and the other corpses were buried, some in one place and\nsome in the other.  But lo! next morning, the body of Amile in his\ncoffin was found lying in the church of Saint Oseige, beside the\ncoffin of Amis his comrade.  Behold then this wondrous amity,\nwhich by death could not be dissevered!",
        "“This miracle God did, who gave to His disciples power to\nremove mountains.  And by reason of this miracle the king and\nqueen remained in that place for a space of thirty days, and\nperformed the offices of the dead who were slain, and honoured\nthe said churches with great [29] gifts.  And the bishop ordained\nmany clerks to serve in the church of Saint Oseige, and\ncommanded them that they should guard duly, with great\ndevotion, the bodies of the two companions, Amis and Amile.”",
        "1872.",
        "16. *Recently, Aucassin and Nicolette has been edited and\ntranslated into English, with much graceful scholarship, by Mr. F.\nW. Bourdillon.  Still more recently we have had a translation–a\npoet’s translation–from the ingenious and versatile pen of Mr.\nAndrew Lang.  The reader should consult also the chapter on\n\"The Out-door Poetry,” in Vernon Lee’s most interesting\nEuphorion; being Studies of the Antique and Mediaeval in the\nRenaissance, a work abounding in knowledge and insight on the\nsubjects of which it treats.",

        "[30] NO account of the Renaissance can be complete without\nsome notice of the attempt made by certain Italian scholars of the\nfifteenth century to reconcile Christianity with the religion of\nancient Greece.  To reconcile forms of sentiment which at first\nsight seem incompatible, to adjust the various products of the\nhuman mind to one another in one many-sided type of intellectual\nculture, to give humanity, for heart and imagination to feed upon,\nas much as it could possibly receive, belonged to the generous\ninstincts of that age.  An earlier and simpler generation had seen\nin the gods of Greece so many malignant spirits, the defeated but\nstill living centres of the religion of darkness, struggling, not\nalways in vain, against the kingdom of light.  Little by little, as\nthe natural charm of pagan story reasserted itself over minds\nemerging out of barbarism, the religious significance which had\nonce belonged to it was lost sight of, and it came to be regarded\nas the subject of a purely artistic or poetical treatment.  But it was\ninevitable that from time to time minds should [31] arise, deeply\nenough impressed by its beauty and power to ask themselves\nwhether the religion of Greece was indeed a rival of the religion\nof Christ; for the older gods had rehabilitated themselves, and\nmen’s allegiance was divided.  And the fifteenth century was an\nimpassioned age, so ardent and serious in its pursuit of art that it\nconsecrated everything with which art had to do as a religious\nobject.  The restored Greek literature had made it familiar, at\nleast in Plato, with a style of expression concerning the earlier\ngods, which had about it something of the warmth and unction of\na Christian hymn.  It was too familiar with such language to\nregard mythology as a mere story; and it was too serious to play\nwith a religion.",
        "“Let me briefly remind the reader\"–says Heine, in the Gods in\nExile, an essay full of that strange blending of sentiment which is\ncharacteristic of the traditions of the middle age concerning the\npagan religions–\"how the gods of the older world, at the time of\nthe definite triumph of Christianity, that is, in the third century,\nfell into painful embarrassments, which greatly resembled certain\ntragical situations of their earlier life.  They now found\nthemselves beset by the same troublesome necessities to which\nthey had once before been exposed during the primitive ages, in\nthat revolutionary epoch when the Titans broke out of the custody\nof Orcus, and, piling Pelion on Ossa, scaled [32] Olympus.\nUnfortunate gods!  They had then to take flight ignominiously,\nand hide themselves among us here on earth, under all sorts of\ndisguises.  The larger number betook themselves to Egypt, where\nfor greater security they assumed the forms of animals, as is\ngenerally known.  Just in the same way, they had to take flight\nagain, and seek entertainment in remote hiding-places, when\nthose iconoclastic zealots, the black brood of monks, broke down\nall the temples, and pursued the gods with fire and curses.  Many\nof these unfortunate emigrants, now entirely deprived of shelter\nand ambrosia, must needs take to vulgar handicrafts, as a means\nof earning their bread.  Under these circumstances, many whose\nsacred groves had been confiscated, let themselves out for hire as\nwood-cutters in Germany, and were forced to drink beer instead\nof nectar.  Apollo seems to have been content to take service\nunder graziers, and as he had once kept the cows of Admetus, so\nhe lived now as a shepherd in Lower Austria.  Here, however,\nhaving become suspected on account of his beautiful singing, he\nwas recognised by a learned monk as one of the old pagan gods,\nand handed over to the spiritual tribunal.  On the rack he\nconfessed that he was the god Apollo; and before his execution\nhe begged that he might be suffered to play once more upon the\nlyre, and to sing a song.  And he played so touchingly, and sang\nwith such magic, and was withal so [33] beautiful in form and\nfeature, that all the women wept, and many of them were so\ndeeply impressed that they shortly afterwards fell sick.  Some\ntime afterwards the people wished to drag him from the grave\nagain, that a stake might be driven through his body, in the belief\nthat he had been a vampire, and that the sick women would by\nthis means recover.  But they found the grave empty.”",
        "The Renaissance of the fifteenth century was, in many things,\ngreat rather by what it designed than by what it achieved.  Much\nwhich it aspired to do, and did but imperfectly or mistakenly, was\naccomplished in what is called the eclaircissement of the\neighteenth century, or in our own generation; and what really\nbelongs to the revival of the fifteenth century is but the leading\ninstinct, the curiosity, the initiatory idea.  It is so with this very\nquestion of the reconciliation of the religion of antiquity with the\nreligion of Christ.  A modern scholar occupied by this problem\nmight observe that all religions may be regarded as natural\nproducts, that, at least in their origin, their growth, and decay,\nthey have common laws, and are not to be isolated from the other\nmovements of the human mind in the periods in which they\nrespectively prevailed; that they arise spontaneously out of the\nhuman mind, as expressions of the varying phases of its\nsentiment concerning the unseen world; that every intellectual\nproduct must be judged from the point of [34] view of the age\nand the people in which it was produced.  He might go on to\nobserve that each has contributed something to the development\nof the religious sense, and ranging them as so many stages in the\ngradual education of the human mind, justify the existence of\neach.  The basis of the reconciliation of the religions of the world\nwould thus be the inexhaustible activity and creativeness of the\nhuman mind itself, in which all religions alike have their root,\nand in which all alike are reconciled; just as the fancies of\nchildhood and the thoughts of old age meet and are laid to rest, in\nthe experience of the individual.",
        "Far different was the method followed by the scholars of the\nfifteenth century.  They lacked the very rudiments of the historic\nsense, which, by an imaginative act, throws itself back into a\nworld unlike one’s own, and estimates every intellectual creation\nin its connexion with the age from which it proceeded.  They had\nno idea of development, of the differences of ages, of the process\nby which our race has been “educated.”  In their attempts to\nreconcile the religions of the world, they were thus thrown back\nupon the quicksand of allegorical interpretation.  The religions of\nthe world were to be reconciled, not as successive stages in a\nregular development of the religious sense, but as subsisting side\nby side, and substantially in agreement with one another.  And\nhere the first necessity was to misrepresent the language, the\nconceptions, the sentiments, it was [35] proposed to compare and\nreconcile.  Plato and Homer must be made to speak agreeably to\nMoses.  Set side by side, the mere surfaces could never unite in\nany harmony of design.  Therefore one must go below the\nsurface, and bring up the supposed secondary, or still more\nremote meaning,–that diviner signification held in reserve, in\nrecessu divinius aliquid, latent in some stray touch of Homer, or\nfigure of speech in the books of Moses.",
        "And yet as a curiosity of the human mind, a “madhouse-cell,” if\nyou will, into which we may peep for a moment, and see it at\nwork weaving strange fancies, the allegorical interpretation of the\nfifteenth century has its interest.  With its strange web of\nimagery, its quaint conceits, its unexpected combinations and\nsubtle moralising, it is an element in the local colour of a great\nage.  It illustrates also the faith of that age in all oracles, its desire\nto hear all voices, its generous belief that nothing which had ever\ninterested the human mind could wholly lose its vitality.  It is the\ncounterpart, though certainly the feebler counterpart, of that\npractical truce and reconciliation of the gods of Greece with the\nChristian religion, which is seen in the art of the time.  And it is\nfor his share in this work, and because his own story is a sort of\nanalogue or visible equivalent to the expression of this purpose in\nhis writings, that something of a general interest still belongs to\nthe name of Pico della Mirandola, [36] whose life, written by his\nnephew Francis, seemed worthy, for some touch of sweetness in\nit, to be translated out of the original Latin by Sir Thomas More,\nthat great lover of Italian culture, among whose works the life of\nPico, Earl of Mirandola, and a great lord of Italy, as he calls\nhim, may still be read, in its quaint, antiquated English.",
        "Marsilio Ficino has told us how Pico came to Florence.  It was\nthe very day–some day probably in the year 1482–on which\nFicino had finished his famous translation of Plato into Latin, the\nwork to which he had been dedicated from childhood by Cosmo\nde’ Medici, in furtherance of his desire to resuscitate the\nknowledge of Plato among his fellow-citizens.  Florence indeed,\nas M. Renan has pointed out, had always had an affinity for the\nmystic and dreamy philosophy of Plato, while the colder and\nmore practical philosophy of Aristotle had flourished in Padua,\nand other cities of the north; and the Florentines, though they\nknew perhaps very little about him, had had the name of  the\ngreat idealist often on their lips.  To increase this knowledge,\nCosmo had founded the Platonic academy, with periodical\ndiscussions at the Villa Careggi.  The fall of Constantinople in\n1453, and the council in 1438 for the reconciliation of the Greek\nand Latin Churches, had brought to Florence many a needy\nGreek scholar.  And now the work was completed, the door of the\nmystical temple lay open to all who could construe Latin, and the\n[37] scholar rested from his labour; when there was introduced\ninto his study, where a lamp burned continually before the bust of\nPlato, as other men burned lamps before their favourite saints, a\nyoung man fresh from a journey, “of feature and shape seemly\nand beauteous, of stature goodly and high, of flesh tender and\nsoft, his visage lovely and fair, his colour white, intermingled\nwith comely reds, his eyes grey, and quick of look, his teeth\nwhite and even, his hair yellow and abundant,” and trimmed with\nmore than the usual artifice of the time.",
        "It is thus that Sir Thomas More translates the words of the\nbiographer of Pico, who, even in outward form and appearance,\nseems an image of that inward harmony and completeness, of\nwhich he is so perfect an example.  The word mystic has been\nusually derived from a Greek word which signifies to shut, as if\none shut one’s lips brooding on what cannot be uttered; but the\nPlatonists themselves derive it rather from the act of shutting the\neyes, that one may see the more, inwardly.  Perhaps the eyes of\nthe mystic Ficino, now long past the midway of life, had come to\nbe thus half-closed; but when a young man, not unlike the\narchangel Raphael, as the Florentines of that age depicted him in\nhis wonderful walk with Tobit, or Mercury, as he might have\nappeared in a painting by Sandro Botticelli or Piero di Cosimo,\nentered his chamber, he seems to have thought there was\nsomething not wholly earthly about [38] him; at least, he ever\nafterwards believed that it was not without the co-operation of the\nstars that the stranger had arrived on that day.  For it happened\nthat they fell into a conversation, deeper and more intimate than\nmen usually fall into at first sight.  During this conversation\nFicino formed the design of devoting his remaining years to the\ntranslation of Plotinus, that new Plato, in whom the mystical\nelement in the Platonic philosophy had been worked out to the\nutmost limit of vision and ecstasy; and it is in dedicating this\ntranslation to Lorenzo de’ Medici that Ficino has recorded these\nincidents.",
        "It was after many wanderings, wanderings of the intellect as well\nas physical journeys, that Pico came to rest at Florence.  Born in\n1463, he was then about twenty years old.  He was called\nGiovanni at baptism, Pico, like all his ancestors, from Picus,\nnephew of the Emperor Constantine, from whom they claimed to\nbe descended, and Mirandola from the place of his birth, a little\ntown afterwards part of the duchy of Modena, of which small\nterritory his family had long been the feudal lords.  Pico was the\nyoungest of the family, and his mother, delighting in his\nwonderful memory, sent him at the age of fourteen to the famous\nschool of law at Bologna.  From the first, indeed, she seems to\nhave had some presentiment of his future fame, for, with a faith\nin omens characteristic of her time, she believed [39] that a\nstrange circumstance had happened at the time of Pico’s birth–\nthe appearance of a circular flame which suddenly vanished\naway, on the wall of the chamber where she lay.  He remained\ntwo years at Bologna; and then, with an inexhaustible, unrivalled\nthirst for knowledge, the strange, confused, uncritical learning of\nthat age, passed through the principal schools of Italy and France,\npenetrating, as he thought, into the secrets of all ancient\nphilosophies, and many Eastern languages.  And with this flood\nof erudition came the generous hope, so often disabused, of\nreconciling the philosophers with one another, and all alike with\nthe Church.  At last he came to Rome.  There, like some knight-\nerrant of philosophy, he offered to defend nine hundred bold\nparadoxes, drawn from the most opposite sources, against all\ncomers.  But the pontifical court was led to suspect the orthodoxy\nof some of these propositions, and even the reading of the book\nwhich contained them was forbidden by the Pope.  It was not\nuntil 1493 that Pico was finally absolved, by a brief of Alexander\nthe Sixth.  Ten years before that date he had arrived at Florence;\nan early instance of those who, after following the vain hope of\nan impossible reconciliation from system to system, have at last\nfallen back unsatisfied on the simplicities of their childhood’s\nbelief.",
        "The oration which Pico composed for the opening of this\nphilosophical tournament still [40] remains; its subject is the\ndignity of human nature, the greatness of man.  In common with\nnearly all medieval speculation, much of Pico’s writing has this\nfor its drift; and in common also with it, Pico’s theory of that\ndignity is founded on a misconception of the place in nature both\nof the earth and of man.  For Pico the earth is the centre of the\nuniverse: and around it, as a fixed and motionless point, the sun\nand moon and stars revolve, like diligent servants or ministers.\nAnd in the midst of all is placed man, nodus et vinculum mundi,\nthe bond or copula of the world, and the “interpreter of nature”:\nthat famous expression of Bacon’s really belongs to Pico.  Tritum\nest in scholis, he says, esse hominem minorem mundum, in quo\nmixtum ex elementis corpus et spiritus coelestis et plantarum\nanima vegetalis et brutorum sensus et ratio et angelica mens et\nDei similitudo conspicitur:–\"It is a commonplace of the schools\nthat man is a little world, in which we may discern a body\nmingled of earthy elements, and ethereal breath, and the\nvegetable life of plants, and the senses of the lower animals, and\nreason, and the intelligence of angels, and a likeness to God.”",
        "A commonplace of the schools!  But perhaps it had some new\nsignificance and authority, when men heard one like Pico\nreiterate it; and, false as its basis was, the theory had its use.  For\nthis high dignity of man, thus bringing the dust under his feet into\nsensible communion with the [41] thoughts and affections of the\nangels, was supposed to belong to him, not as renewed by a\nreligious system, but by his own natural right.  The proclamation\nof it was a counterpoise to the increasing tendency of medieval\nreligion to depreciate man’s nature, to sacrifice this or that\nelement in it, to make it ashamed of itself, to keep the degrading\nor painful accidents of it always in view.  It helped man onward\nto that reassertion of himself, that rehabilitation of human nature,\nthe body, the senses, the heart, the intelligence, which the\nRenaissance fulfils.  And yet to read a page of one of Pico’s\nforgotten books is like a glance into one of those ancient\nsepulchres, upon which the wanderer in classical lands has\nsometimes stumbled, with the old disused ornaments and\nfurniture of a world wholly unlike ours still fresh in them.  That\nwhole conception of nature is so different from our own.  For\nPico the world is a limited place, bounded by actual crystal walls,\nand a material firmament; it is like a painted toy, like that map or\nsystem of the world, held, as a great target or shield, in the hands\nof the creative Logos, by whom the Father made all things, in one\nof the earlier frescoes of the Campo Santo at Pisa.  How different\nfrom this childish dream is our own conception of nature, with its\nunlimited space, its innumerable suns, and the earth but a mote in\nthe beam; how different the strange new awe, or superstition,\nwith which it fills our minds!  “The silence of those infinite\nspaces,” [42] says Pascal, contemplating a starlight night, the\nsilence of those infinite spaces terrifies me”:– Le silence eternel de\nces espaces infinis m’effraie.",
        "He was already almost wearied out when he came to Florence.\nHe had loved much and been beloved by women, “wandering\nover the crooked hills of delicious pleasure\"; but their reign over\nhim was over, and long before Savonarola’s famous “bonfire of\nvanities,” he had destroyed those love-songs in the vulgar tongue,\nwhich would have been so great a relief to us, after the scholastic\nprolixity of his Latin writings.  It was in another spirit that he\ncomposed a Platonic commentary, the only work of his in Italian\nwhich has come down to us, on the “Song of Divine Love\"–\nsecondo la mente ed opinione dei Platonici–\"according to the\nmind and opinion of the Platonists,” by his friend Hieronymo\nBeniveni, in which, with an ambitious array of every sort of\nlearning, and a profusion of imagery borrowed indifferently from\nthe astrologers, the Cabala, and Homer, and Scripture, and\nDionysius the Areopagite, he attempts to define the stages by\nwhich the soul passes from the earthly to the unseen beauty.  A\nchange indeed had passed over him, as if the chilling touch of the\nabstract and disembodied beauty Platonists profess to long for\nwere already upon him.  Some sense of this, perhaps, coupled\nwith that over-brightness which in the popular imagination\nalways betokens an early [43] death, made Camilla Rucellai, one\nof those prophetic women whom the preaching of Savonarola had\nraised up in Florence, declare, seeing him for the first time, that\nhe would depart in the time of lilies–prematurely, that is, like the\nfield-flowers which are withered by the scorching sun almost as\nsoon as they are sprung up.  He now wrote down those thoughts\non the religious life which Sir Thomas More turned into English,\nand which another English translator thought worthy to be added\nto the books of the Imitation.  “It is not hard to know God,\nprovided one will not force oneself to define Him”:–has been\nthought a great saying of Joubert’s.  “Love God,” Pico writes to\nAngelo Politian, “we rather may, than either know Him, or by\nspeech utter Him.  And yet had men liefer by knowledge never\nfind that which they seek, than by love possess that thing, which\nalso without love were in vain found.”",
        "Yet he who had this fine touch for spiritual things did not–and in\nthis is the enduring interest of his story–even after his\nconversion, forget the old gods.  He is one of the last who\nseriously and sincerely entertained the claim on men’s faith of the\npagan religions; he is anxious to ascertain the true significance of\nthe obscurest legend, the lightest tradition concerning them.\nWith many thoughts and many influences which led him in that\ndirection, [44] he did not become a monk; only he became\ngentle and patient in disputation; retaining “somewhat of the old\nplenty, in dainty viand and silver vessel,” he gave over the\ngreater part of his property to his friend, the mystical poet\nBeniveni, to be spent by him in works of charity, chiefly in the\nsweet charity of providing marriage-dowries for the peasant girls\nof Florence.  His end came in 1494, when, amid the prayers and\nsacraments of Savonarola, he died of fever, on the very day on\nwhich Charles the Eighth entered Florence, the seventeenth of\nNovember, yet in the time of lilies–the lilies of the shield of\nFrance, as the people now said, remembering Camilla’s\nprophecy.  He was buried in the conventual church of Saint\nMark, in the hood and white frock of the Dominican order.",
        "It is because the life of Pico, thus lying down to rest in the\nDominican habit, yet amid thoughts of the older gods, himself\nlike one of those comely divinities, reconciled indeed to the new\nreligion, but still with a tenderness for the earlier life, and\ndesirous literally to “bind the ages each to each by natural piety\"-\n-it is because this life is so perfect a parallel to the attempt made\nin his writings to reconcile Christianity with the ideas of\npaganism, that Pico, in spite of the scholastic character of those\nwritings, is really interesting.  Thus, in the Heptaplus, or\nDiscourse on the Seven Days of the Creation, he endeavours to\nreconcile the [45] accounts which pagan philosophy had given of\nthe origin of the world with the account given in the books of\nMoses–the Timaeus of Plato with the book of Genesis.  The\nHeptaplus is dedicated to Lorenzo the Magnificent, whose\ninterest, the preface tells us, in the secret wisdom of Moses is\nwell known.  If Moses seems in his writings simple and even\npopular, rather than either a philosopher or a theologian, that is\nbecause it was an institution with the ancient philosophers, either\nnot to speak of divine things at all, or to speak of them\ndissemblingly: hence their doctrines were called mysteries.\nTaught by them, Pythagoras became so great a “master of\nsilence,” and wrote almost nothing, thus hiding the words of God\nin his heart, and speaking wisdom only among the perfect.  In\nexplaining the harmony between Plato and Moses, Pico lays hold\non every sort of figure and analogy, on the double meanings of\nwords, the symbols of the Jewish ritual, the secondary meanings\nof obscure stories in the later Greek mythologists.  Everywhere\nthere is an unbroken system of correspondences.  Every object in\nthe terrestrial world is an analogue, a symbol or counterpart, of\nsome higher reality in the starry heavens, and this again of some\nlaw of the angelic life in the world beyond the stars.  There is the\nelement of fire in the material world; the sun is the fire of heaven;\nand in the super-celestial world there is the fire of [46] the\nseraphic intelligence.  “But behold how they differ!  The\nelementary fire burns, the heavenly fire vivifies, the super-\ncelestial fire loves.”  In this way, every natural object, every\ncombination of natural forces, every accident in the lives of men,\nis filled with higher meanings.  Omens, prophecies, supernatural\ncoincidences, accompany Pico himself all through life.  There are\noracles in every tree and mountain-top, and a significance in\nevery accidental combination of the events of life.",
        "This constant tendency to symbolism and imagery gives Pico’s\nwork a figured style, by which it has some real resemblance to\nPlato’s, and he differs from other mystical writers of his time by\na genuine desire to know his authorities at first hand.  He reads\nPlato in Greek, Moses in Hebrew, and by this his work really\nbelongs to the higher culture.  Above all, we have a constant\nsense in reading him, that his thoughts, however little their\npositive value may be, are connected with springs beneath them\nof deep and passionate emotion; and when he explains the grades\nor steps by which the soul passes from the love of a physical\nobject to the love of unseen beauty, and unfolds the analogies\nbetween this process and other movements upward of human\nthought, there is a glow and vehemence in his words which\nremind one of the manner in which his own brief existence\nflamed itself away.",
        "I said that the Renaissance of the fifteenth [47] century was, in\nmany things, great rather by what it designed or aspired to do,\nthan by what it actually achieved.  It remained for a later age to\nconceive the true method of effecting a scientific reconciliation\nof Christian sentiment with the imagery, the\tlegends, the theories\nabout the world, of pagan poetry and philosophy.  For that age\nthe only possible reconciliation was an imaginative one, and\nresulted from the efforts of artists, trained in Christian schools, to\nhandle pagan subjects; and of this artistic reconciliation work like\nPico’s was but the feebler counterpart.  Whatever philosophers\nhad to say on one side or the other, whether they\nwere successful or not in their attempts to reconcile the old to the\nnew, and to justify the expenditure of so much care and thought\non the dreams of a dead faith, the imagery of the Greek\treligion,\nthe direct charm of its story, were by artists valued and cultivated\nfor their own sake.  Hence a new sort of mythology, with a tone\nand qualities of its own.  When the ship-load of sacred earth from\nthe soil of Jerusalem was mingled with the common clay in the\nCampo Santo at Pisa, a new flower grew up from it, unlike any\nflower men had seen before, the anemone with its concentric\nrings of strangely blended colour, still to be found by those who\nsearch long enough for it, in the long grass of the Maremma.  Just\nsuch a strange flower was that mythology of the Italian\nRenaissance, which grew up from the mixture of two traditions,\ntwo [48] sentiments, the sacred and the profane.  Classical story\nwas regarded as so much imaginative material to be received and\nassimilated.  It did not come into men’s minds to ask curiously of\nscience, concerning the origin of such story, its primary form and\nimport, its meaning for those who projected it.  The thing sank\ninto their minds, to issue forth again with all the tangle about it of\nmedieval sentiment and ideas.  In the Doni Madonna in the\nTribune of the Uffizii, Michelangelo actually brings the pagan\nreligion, and with it the unveiled human form, the sleepy-looking\nfauns of a Dionysiac revel, into the presence of the Madonna, as\nsimpler painters had introduced there other products of the earth,\nbirds or flowers, while he has given to that Madonna herself\nmuch of the uncouth energy of the older and more primitive\n\"Mighty Mother.”",
        "This picturesque union of contrasts, belonging properly to the art\nof the close of the fifteenth century, pervades, in Pico della\nMirandola, an actual person, and that is why the figure of Pico is\nso attractive.  He will not let one go; he wins one on, in spite of\none’s self, to turn again to the pages of his forgotten books,\nalthough we know already that the actual solution proposed in\nthem will satisfy us as little as perhaps it satisfied him.  It is said\nthat in his eagerness for mysterious learning he once paid a great\nsum for a collection of cabalistic manuscripts, which turned out\nto be forgeries; and [49] the story might well stand as a parable of\nall he ever seemed to gain in the way of actual knowledge.  He\nhad sought knowledge, and passed from system to system, and\nhazarded much; but less for the sake of positive knowledge than\nbecause he believed there was a spirit of order and beauty in\nknowledge, which would come down and unite what men’s\nignorance had divided, and renew what time had made dim.  And\nso, while his actual work has passed away, yet his own qualities\nare still active, and himself remains, as one alive in the grave,\ncaesiis et vigilibus oculis, as his biographer describes him, and\nwith that sanguine, clear skin, decenti rubore interspersa, as with\nthe light of morning upon it; and he has a true place in that group\nof great Italians who fill the end of the fifteenth century with their\nnames, he is a true humanist.  For the essence of humanism is\nthat belief of which he seems never to have doubted, that nothing\nwhich has ever interested living men and women can wholly lose\nits vitality–no language they have spoken, nor oracle beside\nwhich they have hushed their voices, no dream which has once\nbeen entertained by actual human minds, nothing about which\nthey have ever been passionate, or expended time and zeal.",
        "1871.",
        "[50] IN Leonardo’s treatise on painting only one contemporary is\nmentioned by name–Sandro Botticelli.  This pre-eminence may\nbe due to chance only, but to some will rather appear a result of\ndeliberate judgment; for people have begun to find out the charm\nof Botticelli’s work, and his name, little known in the last\ncentury, is quietly becoming important.  In the middle of the\nfifteenth century he had already anticipated much of that\nmeditative subtlety, which is sometimes supposed peculiar to the\ngreat imaginative workmen of its close.  Leaving the simple\nreligion which had occupied the followers of Giotto for a century,\nand the simple naturalism which had grown out of it, a thing of\nbirds and flowers only, he sought inspiration in what to him were\nworks of the modern world, the writings of Dante and Boccaccio,\nand in new readings of his own of classical stories: or, if he\npainted religious incidents, painted them with an under-current of\noriginal sentiment, which touches you as the real matter of the\npicture through the veil of its ostensible subject.  What [51] is the\npeculiar sensation, what is the peculiar quality of pleasure, which\nhis work has the property of exciting in us, and which we cannot\nget elsewhere?  For this, especially when he has to speak of a\ncomparatively unknown artist, is always the chief question which\na critic has to answer.",
        "In an age when the lives of artists were full of adventure, his life\nis almost colourless.  Criticism indeed has cleared away much of\nthe gossip which Vasari accumulated, has touched the legend of\nLippo and Lucrezia, and rehabilitated the character of Andrea del\nCastagno.  But in Botticelli’s case there is no legend to dissipate.\nHe did not even go by his true name: Sandro is a nickname, and\nhis true name is Filipepi, Botticelli being only the name of the\ngoldsmith who first taught him art.  Only two things happened to\nhim, two things which he shared with other artists:–he was\ninvited to Rome to paint in the Sistine Chapel, and he fell in later\nlife under the influence of Savonarola, passing apparently almost\nout of men’s sight in a sort of religious melancholy, which lasted\ntill his death in 1515, according to the received date.  Vasari says\nthat he plunged into the study of Dante, and even wrote a\ncomment on the Divine Comedy.  But it seems strange that he\nshould have lived on inactive so long; and one almost wishes that\nsome document might come to light, which, fixing the date of his\ndeath earlier, might relieve one, in thinking of him, of his\ndejected old age.",
        "[52] He is before all things a poetical painter, blending the charm\nof story and sentiment, the medium of the art of poetry, with the\ncharm of line and colour, the medium of abstract painting.  So he\nbecomes the illustrator of Dante.  In a few rare examples of the\nedition of 1481, the blank spaces, left at the beginning of every\ncanto for the hand of the illuminator, have been filled, as far as\nthe nineteenth canto of the Inferno, with impressions of engraved\nplates, seemingly by way of experiment, for in the copy in the\nBodleian Library, one of the three impressions it contains has\nbeen printed upside down, and much awry, in the midst of the\nluxurious printed page.  Giotto, and the followers of Giotto, with\ntheir almost childish religious aim, had not learned to put that\nweight of meaning into outward things, light, colour, everyday\ngesture, which the poetry of the Divine Comedy involves, and\nbefore the fifteenth century Dante could hardly have found an\nillustrator.  Botticelli’s illustrations are crowded with incident,\nblending, with a naive carelessness of pictorial propriety, three\nphases of the same scene into one plate.  The grotesques, so often\na stumbling-block to painters, who forget that the words of a\npoet, which only feebly present an image to the mind, must be\nlowered in key when translated into visible form, make one regret\nthat he has not rather chosen for illustration the more subdued\nimagery of the Purgatorio.  Yet in the [53] scene of those who\n\"go down quick into hell,” there is an inventive force about the\nfire taking hold on the upturned soles of the feet, which proves\nthat the design is no mere translation of Dante’s words, but a true\npainter’s vision; while the scene of the Centaurs wins one at\nonce, for, forgetful of the actual circumstances of their\nappearance, Botticelli has gone off with delight on the thought of\nthe Centaurs themselves, bright, small creatures of the woodland,\nwith arch baby faces and mignon forms, drawing tiny bows.",
        "Botticelli lived in a generation of naturalists, and he might have\nbeen a mere naturalist among them.  There are traces enough in\nhis work of that alert sense of outward things, which, in the\npictures of that period, fills the lawns with delicate living\ncreatures, and the hillsides with pools of water, and the pools of\nwater with flowering reeds.  But this was not enough for him; he\nis a visionary painter, and in his visionariness he resembles\nDante.  Giotto, the tried companion of Dante, Masaccio,\nGhirlandajo even, do but transcribe, with more or less refining,\nthe outward image; they are dramatic, not visionary painters; they\nare almost impassive spectators of the action before them.  But\nthe genius of which Botticelli is the type usurps the data before it\nas the exponent of ideas, moods, visions of its own; in this\ninterest it plays fast and loose with those data, rejecting some and\n[54] isolating others, and always combining them anew.  To him,\nas to Dante, the scene, the colour, the outward image or gesture,\ncomes with all its incisive and importunate reality; but awakes in\nhim, moreover, by some subtle law of his own structure, a mood\nwhich it awakes in no one else, of which it is the double or\nrepetition, and which it clothes, that all may share it, with visible\ncircumstance.",
        "But he is far enough from accepting the conventional orthodoxy\nof Dante which, referring all human action to the simple formula\nof purgatory, heaven and hell, leaves an insoluble element of\nprose in the depths of Dante’s poetry.  One picture of his, with\nthe portrait of the donor, Matteo Palmieri, below, had the credit\nor discredit of attracting some shadow of ecclesiastical censure.\nThis Matteo Palmieri, (two dim figures move under that name in\ncontemporary history,) was the reputed author of a poem, still\nunedited, La Citta Divina, which represented the human race as\nan incarnation of those angels who, in the revolt of Lucifer, were\nneither for Jehovah nor for His enemies, a fantasy of that earlier\nAlexandrian philosophy about which the Florentine intellect in\nthat century was so curious.  Botticelli’s picture may have been\nonly one of those familiar compositions in which religious\nreverie has recorded its impressions of the various forms of\nbeatified existence–Glorias, as they were called, like that [55] in\nwhich Giotto painted the portrait of Dante; but somehow it was\nsuspected of embodying in a picture the wayward dream of\nPalmieri, and the chapel where it hung was closed.  Artists so\nentire as Botticelli are usually careless about philosophical\ntheories, even when the philosopher is a Florentine of the\nfifteenth century, and his work a poem in terza rima.  But\nBotticelli, who wrote a commentary on Dante, and became the\ndisciple of Savonarola, may well have let such theories come and\ngo across him.  True or false, the story interprets much of the\npeculiar sentiment with which he infuses his profane and sacred\npersons, comely, and in a certain sense like angels, but with a\nsense of displacement or loss about them–the wistfulness of\nexiles, conscious of a passion and energy greater than any known\nissue of them explains, which runs through all his varied work\nwith a sentiment of ineffable melancholy.",
        "So just what Dante scorns as unworthy alike of heaven and hell,\nBotticelli accepts, that middle world in which men take no side in\ngreat conflicts, and decide no great causes, and make great\nrefusals.  He thus sets for himself the limits within which art,\nundisturbed by any moral ambition, does its most sincere and\nsurest work.  His interest is neither in the untempered goodness\nof Angelico’s saints, nor the untempered evil of Orcagna’s\nInferno; but with men and women, in their mixed and uncertain\ncondition, always [56] attractive, clothed sometimes by passion\nwith a character of loveliness and energy, but saddened\nperpetually by the shadow upon them of the great things from\nwhich they shrink.  His morality is all sympathy; and it is this\nsympathy, conveying into his work somewhat more than is usual\nof the true complexion of humanity, which makes him, visionary\nas he is, so forcible a realist.",
        "It is this which gives to his Madonnas their unique expression\nand charm.  He has worked out in them a distinct and peculiar\ntype, definite enough in his own mind, for he has painted it over\nand over again, sometimes one might think almost mechanically,\nas a pastime during that dark period when his thoughts were so\nheavy upon him.  Hardly any collection of note is without one of\nthese circular pictures, into which the attendant angels depress\ntheir heads so naively.  Perhaps you have sometimes wondered\nwhy those peevish-looking Madonnas, conformed to no\nacknowledged or obvious type of beauty, attract you more and\nmore, and often come back to you when the Sistine Madonna and\nthe Virgins of Fra Angelico are forgotten.  At first, contrasting\nthem with those, you may have thought that there was something\nin them mean or abject even, for the abstract lines of the face\nhave little nobleness, and the colour is wan.  For with Botticelli\nshe too, though she holds in her hands the “Desire of all nations,\"\nis one of those who [57] are neither for Jehovah nor for His\nenemies; and her choice is on her face.  The white light on it is\ncast up hard and cheerless from below, as when snow lies upon\nthe ground, and the children look up with surprise at the strange\nwhiteness of the ceiling.  Her trouble is in the very caress of the\nmysterious child, whose gaze is always far from her, and who has\nalready that sweet look of devotion which men have never been\nable altogether to love, and which still makes the born saint an\nobject almost of suspicion to his earthly brethren.  Once, indeed,\nhe guides her hand to transcribe in a book the words of her\nexaltation, the Ave, and the Magnificat, and the Gaude Maria,\nand the young angels, glad to rouse her for a moment from her\ndejection, are eager to hold the inkhorn and to support the book.\nBut the pen almost drops from her hand, and the high cold words\nhave no meaning for her, and her true children are those others,\namong whom, in her rude home, the intolerable honour came to\nher, with that look of wistful inquiry on their irregular faces\nwhich you see in startled animals–gipsy children, such as those\nwho, in Apennine villages, still hold out their long brown arms to\nbeg of you, but on Sundays become enfants du choeur, with their\nthick black hair nicely combed, and fair white linen on their\nsunburnt throats.",
        "What is strangest is that he carries this sentiment into classical\nsubjects, its most complete [58] expression being a picture in the\nUffizii, of Venus rising from the sea, in which the grotesque\nemblems of the middle age, and a landscape full of its peculiar\nfeeling, and even its strange draperies, powdered all\tover in\nthe Gothic manner with a quaint conceit\tof daisies, frame a figure\nthat reminds you of the faultless nude studies of Ingres.  At first,\nperhaps, you are attracted only by a quaintness of design, which\nseems to recall all at once whatever you have read of Florence in\nthe fifteenth century; afterwards you may think that this\nquaintness must be incongruous with the subject, and that the\ncolour is cadaverous or at least cold.  And yet, the more you\ncome to understand what imaginative colouring really is, that all\ncolour is no mere delightful quality of natural things, but a spirit\nupon them by which they become expressive to the spirit, the\nbetter you will like this peculiar quality of colour; and you will\nfind that quaint design of Botticelli’s a more direct inlet into the\nGreek temper than the works of the Greeks themselves even of\nthe finest period.  Of the Greeks as they really were, of their\ndifference from ourselves, of the aspects of their outward life, we\nknow far more than Botticelli, or his most learned\ncontemporaries; but for us long familiarity has taken off the edge\nof the lesson, and we are hardly conscious of what we owe to the\nHellenic spirit.  But in pictures like this of Botticelli’s you have a\nrecord of\tthe first impression made [59] by it on minds\nturned back towards it, in almost painful aspiration, from a world\nin which it had been ignored so long; and in the passion, the\nenergy, the industry of realisation, with which Botticelli carries\nout his intention, is the exact measure of the legitimate influence\nover the human mind of the imaginative system of which this is\nperhaps the central myth.  The light is indeed cold–mere sunless\ndawn; but a later painter would have cloyed you with sunshine;\nand you can see the better for that quietness in the morning air\neach long promontory, as it slopes down to the water’s edge.\nMen go forth to their labours until the evening; but she is awake\nbefore them, and you might think that the sorrow in her face was\nat the thought of the whole long day of love yet to come.  An\nemblematical figure of the wind blows hard across the grey\nwater, moving forward the dainty-lipped shell on which she sails,\nthe sea “showing his teeth,” as it moves, in thin lines of foam,\nand sucking in, one by one, the falling roses, each severe in\noutline, plucked off short at the stalk, but embrowned a little, as\nBotticelli’s flowers always are.  Botticelli meant all this imagery\nto be altogether pleasurable; and it was partly an incompleteness\nof resources, inseparable from the art of that time, that subdued\nand chilled it.  But this predilection for minor tones counts also;\nand what is unmistakable is the sadness with which he has\nconceived the goddess [60] of pleasure, as the depositary of a\ngreat power over the lives of men.",
        "I have said that the peculiar character of Botticelli is the result of\na blending in him of a sympathy for humanity in its uncertain\ncondition, its attractiveness, its investiture at rarer moments in a\ncharacter of loveliness and energy, with his consciousness of the\nshadow upon it of the great things from which it shrinks, and that\nthis conveys into his work somewhat more than painting usually\nattains of the true complexion of humanity.  He paints the story\nof the goddess of pleasure in other episodes besides that of her\nbirth from the sea, but never without some shadow of death in the\ngrey flesh and wan flowers.  He paints Madonnas, but they shrink\nfrom the pressure of the divine child, and plead in unmistakable\nundertones for a warmer, lower humanity.  The same figure–\ntradition connects it with Simonetta, the Mistress of Giuliano de’\nMedici–appears again as Judith, returning home across the hill\ncountry, when the great deed is over, and the moment of\nrevulsion come, when the olive branch in her hand is becoming a\nburthen; as Justice, sitting on a throne, but with a fixed look of\nself-hatred which makes the sword in her hand seem that of a\nsuicide; and again as Veritas, in the allegorical picture of\nCalumnia, where one may note in passing the suggestiveness of\nan accident which identifies the image of Truth with the person\nof Venus. [61] We might trace the same sentiment through his\nengravings; but his share in them is doubtful, and the object of\nthis brief study has been attained, if I have defined aright the\ntemper in which he worked.",
        "But, after all, it may be asked, is a painter like Botticelli–a\nsecondary painter, a proper subject for general criticism?  There\nare a few great painters, like Michelangelo or Leonardo, whose\nwork has become a force in general culture, partly for this very\nreason that they have absorbed into themselves all such workmen\nas Sandro Botticelli; and, over and above mere technical or\nantiquarian criticism, general criticism may be very well\nemployed in that sort of interpretation which adjusts the position\nof these men to general culture, whereas smaller men can be the\nproper subjects only of technical or antiquarian treatment.  But,\nbesides those great men, there is a certain number of artists who\nhave a distinct faculty of their own by which they convey to us a\npeculiar quality of pleasure which we cannot get elsewhere; and\nthese too have their place in general culture, and must be\ninterpreted to it by those who have felt their charm strongly, and\nare often the object of a special diligence and a consideration\nwholly affectionate, just because there is not about them the\nstress of a great name and authority.  Of this select number\nBotticelli is one.  He has the freshness, the uncertain and diffident\npromise, [62] which belong to the earlier Renaissance itself, and\nmake it perhaps the most interesting period in the history of the\nmind.  In studying his work one begins to understand to how\ngreat a place in human culture the art of Italy had been called.",
        "1870.",
        "[63] THE Italian sculptors of the earlier half of the fifteenth\ncentury are more than mere forerunners of the great masters of its\nclose, and often reach perfection, within the\tnarrow limits which\nthey chose to impose on their work.  Their sculpture shares with\nthe paintings of Botticelli and the churches of Brunelleschi that\nprofound expressiveness, that intimate impress of an indwelling\nsoul, which is the peculiar fascination of the art of Italy in that\ncentury.  Their works have been much neglected, and often\nalmost hidden away amid the frippery of modern decoration, and\nwe come with some surprise on the places where their fire still\nsmoulders.  One longs to penetrate into the lives of the men who\nhave given expression to so much power and sweetness.  But it is\npart of the reserve, the austere dignity and simplicity of their\nexistence, that their histories are for the most part lost, or told but\nbriefly.  From their lives, as from their work, all tumult of sound\nand colour has passed away.  Mino, the Raphael of sculpture,\nMaso del Rodario, whose works add a further grace to [64] the\nchurch of Como, Donatello even,–one asks in vain for more than\na shadowy outline of their actual days.",
        "Something more remains of Luca della Robbia; something more\nof a history, of outward changes and fortunes, is expressed\nthrough his work.  I suppose nothing brings the real air of a\nTuscan town so vividly to mind as those pieces of pale blue and\nwhite earthenware, by which he is best known, like fragments of\nthe milky sky itself, fallen into the cool streets, and breaking into\nthe darkened churches.  And no work is less imitable: like Tuscan\nwine, it loses its savour when moved from its birthplace, from the\ncrumbling walls where it was first placed.  Part of the charm of\nthis work, its grace and purity and finish of expression, is\ncommon to all the Tuscan sculptors of the fifteenth century; for\nLuca was first of all a worker in marble, and his works in terra\ncotta only transfer to a different material the principles of his\nsculpture.",
        "These Tuscan sculptors of the fifteenth century worked for the\nmost part in low relief, giving even to their monumental effigies\nsomething of its depression of surface, getting into them by this\nmeans a pathetic suggestion of the wasting and etherealisation of\ndeath.  They are haters of all heaviness and emphasis, of\nstrongly-opposed light and shade, and seek their means of\ndelineation among those last refinements of shadow, which are\nalmost invisible except in a strong [65] light, and which the finest\npencil can hardly follow.  The whole essence of their work is\nexpression, the passing of a smile over the face of a child, the\nripple of the air on a still day over the curtain of a window ajar.",
        "What is the precise value of this system of sculpture, this low\nrelief?  Luca della Robbia, and the other sculptors of the school\nto which he belongs, have before them the universal problem of\ntheir art; and this system of low relief is the means by which they\nmeet and overcome the special limitation of sculpture.",
        "That limitation results from the material and other necessary\nconditions of all sculptured work, and consists in the tendency of\nsuch work to a hard realism, a one-sided presentment of mere\nform, that solid material frame which only motion can relieve, a\nthing of heavy shadows, and an individuality of expression\npushed to caricature.  Against this tendency to the hard\npresentment of mere form trying vainly to compete with the\nreality of nature itself, all noble sculpture constantly struggles;\neach great system of sculpture resisting it in its own way,\netherealising, spiritualising, relieving its stiffness, its heaviness,\nand death.  The use of colour in sculpture is but an unskilful\ncontrivance to effect, by borrowing from another art, what the\nnobler sculpture effects by strictly appropriate means.",
        "To get not colour, but the equivalent of colour; to secure the\nexpression and the play of life; to [66] expand the too firmly\nfixed individuality of pure, unrelieved, uncoloured form:–this is\nthe problem which the three great styles in sculpture have solved\nin three different ways.",
        "Allgemeinheit–breadth, generality, universality,–is the word\nchosen by Winckelmann, and after him by Goethe and many\nGerman critics, to express that law of the most excellent Greek\nsculptors, of Pheidias and his pupils, which prompted them\nconstantly to seek the type in the individual, to abstract and\nexpress only what is structural and permanent, to purge from the\nindividual all that belongs only to him, all the accidents, the\nfeelings and actions of the special moment, all that (because in its\nown nature it endures but for a moment) is apt to look like a\nfrozen thing if one arrests it.",
        "In this way their works came to be like some subtle extract or\nessence, or almost like pure thoughts or ideas: and hence the\nbreadth of humanity in them, that detachment from the conditions\nof a particular place or people, which has carried their influence\nfar beyond the age which produced them, and insured them\nuniversal acceptance.",
        "That was the Greek way of relieving the hardness and\nunspirituality of pure form.  But it involved to a certain degree\nthe sacrifice of what we call expression; and a system of\nabstraction which aimed always at the broad and general type, at\nthe purging away from the [67] individual of what belonged only\nto him, and of the mere accidents of a particular time and place,\nimposed upon the range of effects open to the Greek sculptor\nlimits somewhat narrowly defined.  When Michelangelo came,\ntherefore, with a genius spiritualised by the reverie of the middle\nage, penetrated by its spirit of inwardness and introspection,\nliving not a mere outward life like the Greek, but a life full of\nintimate experiences, sorrows, consolations, a system which\nsacrificed so much of what was inward and unseen could not\nsatisfy him.  To him, lover and student of Greek sculpture as he\nwas, work which did not bring what was inward to the surface,\nwhich was not concerned with individual expression, with\nindividual character and feeling, the special history of the special\nsoul, was not worth doing at all.",
        "And so, in a way quite personal and peculiar to himself, which\noften is, and always seems, the effect of accident, he secured for\nhis work individuality and intensity of expression, while he\navoided a too heavy realism, that tendency to harden into\ncaricature which the representation of feeling in sculpture is apt\nto display.  What time and accident, its centuries of darkness\nunder the furrows of the “little Melian farm,” have done with\nsingular felicity of touch for the Venus of Melos, fraying its\nsurface and softening its lines, so that some spirit in the thing\nseems always on the point of breaking out, as though [68] in it\nclassical sculpture had advanced already one step into the\nmystical Christian age, its expression being in the whole range of\nancient work most like that of Michelangelo’s own:–this effect\nMichelangelo gains by leaving nearly all his sculpture in a\npuzzling sort of incompleteness, which suggests rather than\nrealises actual form.  Something of the wasting of that snow-\nimage which he moulded at the command of Piero de’ Medici,\nwhen the snow lay one night in the court of the Pitti palace,\nalmost always lurks about it, as if he had determined to make the\nquality of a task, exacted from him half in derision, the pride of\nall his work.  Many have wondered at that incompleteness,\nsuspecting, however, that Michelangelo himself loved and was\nloath to change it, and feeling at the same time that they too\nwould lose something if the half-realised form ever quite\nemerged from the stone, so rough-hewn here, so delicately\nfinished there; and they have wished to fathom the charm of this\nincompleteness.  Well!  That incompleteness is Michelangelo’s\nequivalent for colour in sculpture; it is his way of etherealising\npure form, of relieving its stiff realism, and communicating to it\nbreath, pulsation, the effect of life.  It was a characteristic too\nwhich fell in with his peculiar temper and mode of living, his\ndisappointments and hesitations.  And it was in reality perfect\nfinish.  In this way he combines the utmost amount of passion\nand intensity with [69] the sense of a yielding and flexible life: he\ngets not vitality merely, but a wonderful force of expression.",
        "Midway between these two systems–the system of the Greek\nsculptors and the system of Michelangelo–comes the system of\nLuca della Robbia and the other Tuscan sculptors of the fifteenth\ncentury, partaking both of the Allgemeinheit of the Greeks, their\nway of extracting certain select elements only of pure form and\nsacrificing all the rest, and the studied incompleteness of\nMichelangelo, relieving that sense of intensity, passion, energy,\nwhich might otherwise have stiffened into caricature.  Like\nMichelangelo, these sculptors fill their works with intense and\nindividualised expression.  Their noblest works are the careful\nsepulchral portraits of particular persons–the monument of Conte\nUgo in the Badia of Florence, of the youthful Medea Colleoni,\nwith the wonderful, long throat, in the chapel on the cool north\nside of the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore at Bergamo–\nmonuments such as abound in the churches of Rome,\ninexhaustible in suggestions of repose, of a subdued Sabbatic joy,\na kind of sacred grace and refinement.  And these elements of\ntranquillity, of repose, they unite to an intense and individual\nexpression by a system of conventionalism as skilful and subtle\nas that of the Greeks, repressing all such curves as indicate solid\nform, and throwing the whole into low relief.",
        "[70] The life of Luca, a life of labour and frugality, with no\nadventure and no excitement except what belongs to the trial of\nnew artistic processes, the struggle with new artistic difficulties,\nthe solution of purely artistic problems, fills the first seventy\nyears of the fifteenth century.  After producing many works in\nmarble for the Duomo and the Campanile of Florence, which\nplace him among the foremost masters of the sculpture of his age,\nhe became desirous to realise the spirit and manner of that\nsculpture, in a humbler material, to unite its science, its exquisite\nand expressive system of low relief, to the homely art of pottery,\nto introduce those high qualities into common things, to adorn\nand cultivate daily household life.  In this he is profoundly\ncharacteristic of the Florence of that century, of that in it which\nlay below its superficial vanity and caprice, a certain old-world\nmodesty and seriousness and simplicity.  People had not yet\nbegun to think that what was good art for churches was not so\ngood, or less fitted, for their own houses.  Luca’s new work was\nin plain white earthenware at first, a mere rough\nimitation of the costly, laboriously wrought marble, finished in a\nfew hours.  But on this humble path he found his way to a fresh\nsuccess, to another artistic grace.  The fame of the oriental\npottery, with its strange, bright colours–colours of art, colours\nnot to be attained in the natural stone–mingled with the tradition\nof the old Roman [71] pottery of the neighbourhood.  The little\nred, coral-like jars of Arezzo, dug up in that district from time to\ntime, are much prized.  These colours haunted Luca’s fancy.  “He\nstill continued seeking something more,” his biographer says of\nhim; “and instead of making his figures of baked earth simply\nwhite, he added the further invention of giving them colour, to\nthe astonishment and delight of all who beheld them\"–Cosa\nsingolare, e multo utile per la state!–a curious thing, and very\nuseful for summer-time, full of coolness and repose for hand and\neye.  Luca loved the form of various fruits, and wrought them\ninto all sorts of marvellous frames and garlands, giving them\ntheir natural colours, only subdued a little, a little paler than\nnature.",
        "I said that the art of Luca della Robbia possessed in an unusual\nmeasure that special characteristic which belongs to all the work-\nmen of his school, a characteristic which, even in the absence of\nmuch positive information about their actual history, seems to\nbring those work-men themselves very near to us.  They bear the\nimpress of a personal quality, a profound+ expressiveness, what\nthe French call intimite, by which is meant some subtler sense of\noriginality–the seal on a man’s work of what is most inward and\npeculiar in his moods, and manner of apprehension: it is what we\ncall expression, carried to its highest intensity of degree.  That\ncharacteristic is rare in poetry, rarer still [72] in art, rarest of all in\nthe abstract art of sculpture; yet essentially, perhaps, it is the\nquality which alone makes work in the imaginative order really\nworth having at all.  It is because the works of the artists of the\nfifteenth century possess this quality in an unmistakable way that\none is anxious to know all that can be known about them and\nexplain to one’s self the secret of their charm.",
        "1872.",
        "71. +The Macmillan edition’s misprint “profund” is here\ncorrected to “profound,” the spelling of the 1901 edition.",
        "[73] CRITICS of Michelangelo have sometimes spoken as if the\nonly characteristic of his genius were a wonderful strength,\nverging, as in the things of the imagination great strength always\ndoes, on what is singular or strange.  A certain strangeness,\nsomething of the blossoming of the aloe, is indeed an element in\nall true works of art: that they shall excite or surprise us is\nindispensable.  But that they shall give pleasure and exert a\ncharm over us is indispensable too; and this strangeness must be\nsweet also–a lovely strangeness.  And to the true admirers of\nMichelangelo this is the true type of the Michelangelesque–\nsweetness and strength, pleasure with surprise, an energy of\nconception which seems at every moment about to break through\nall the conditions of comely form, recovering, touch by touch, a\nloveliness found usually only in the simplest natural things–ex\nforti dulcedo.",
        "In this way he sums up for them the whole character of medieval\nart itself in that which distinguishes it most clearly from classical\nwork, the presence of a convulsive energy in it, becoming [74]\nin lower hands merely monstrous or forbidding, and felt, even in\nits most graceful products, as a subdued quaintness or grotesque.\nYet those who feel this grace or sweetness in Michelangelo might\nat the first moment be puzzled if they were asked wherein\nprecisely such quality resided.  Men of inventive temperament–\nVictor Hugo, for instance, in whom, as in Michelangelo, people\nhave for the most part been attracted or repelled by the strength,\nwhile few have understood his sweetness–have sometimes\nrelieved conceptions of merely moral or spiritual greatness, but\nwith little aesthetic charm of their own, by lovely accidents or\naccessories, like the butterfly which alights on the blood-stained\nbarricade in Les Miserables, or those sea-birds for whom the\nmonstrous Gilliatt comes to be as some wild natural thing, so that\nthey are no longer afraid of him, in Les Travailleurs de la Mer.\nBut the austere genius of Michelangelo will not depend for its\nsweetness on any mere accessories like these.  The world of\nnatural things has almost no existence for him; “When one speaks\nof him,” says Grimm, “woods, clouds, seas, and mountains\ndisappear, and only what is formed by the spirit of man remains\nbehind\"; and he quotes a few slight words from a letter of his to\nVasari as the single expression in all he has left of a feeling for\nnature.  He has traced no flowers, like those with which Leonardo\nstars [75] over his gloomiest rocks; nothing like the fret-work of\nwings and flames in which Blake frames his most startling\nconceptions.  No forest-scenery like Titian’s fills his\nbackgrounds, but only blank ranges of rock, and dim vegetable\nforms as blank as they, as in a world before the creation of the\nfirst five days.",
        "Of the whole story of the creation he has painted only the\ncreation of the first man and woman, and, for him at least, feebly,\nthe creation of light.  It belongs to the quality of his genius thus\nto concern itself almost exclusively with the making of man.  For\nhim it is not, as in the story itself, the last and crowning act of a\nseries of developments, but the first and unique act, the creation\nof life itself in its supreme form, off-hand and immediately, in the\ncold and lifeless stone.  With him the beginning of life has all the\ncharacteristics of resurrection; it is like the recovery of suspended\nhealth or animation, with its gratitude, its effusion, and\neloquence.  Fair as the young men of the Elgin marbles, the\nAdam of the Sistine Chapel is unlike them in a total absence of\nthat balance and completeness which express so well the\nsentiment of a self-contained, independent life.  In that languid\nfigure there is something rude and satyr-like, something akin to\nthe rugged hillside on which it lies.  His whole form is gathered\ninto an expression of mere expectancy and reception; he has\nhardly strength enough to lift his finger [76] to touch the finger of\nthe creator; yet a touch of the finger-tips will suffice.",
        "This creation of life–life coming always as relief or recovery,\nand always in strong contrast with the rough-hewn mass in which\nit is kindled–is in various ways the motive of all his work,\nwhether its immediate subject be Pagan or Christian, legend or\nallegory; and this, although at least one-half of his work was\ndesigned for the adornment of tombs–the tomb of Julius, the\ntombs of the Medici.  Not the Judgment but the Resurrection is\nthe real subject of his last work in the Sistine Chapel; and his\nfavourite Pagan subject is the legend of Leda, the delight of the\nworld breaking from the egg of a bird.  As I have already pointed\nout, he secures that ideality of expression which in Greek\nsculpture depends on a delicate system of abstraction, and in\nearly Italian sculpture on lowness of relief, by an incompleteness,\nwhich is surely not always undesigned, and which, as I think, no\none regrets, and trusts to the spectator to complete the half-\nemergent form.  And as his persons have something of the\nunwrought stone about them, so, as if to realise the expression by\nwhich the old Florentine records describe a sculptor–master of\nlive stone–with him the very rocks seem to have life.  They have\nbut to cast away the dust and scurf that they may rise and stand\non their feet.  He loved the very quarries of Carrara, those strange\ngrey peaks which even at mid-day [77] convey into any scene\nfrom which they are visible something of the solemnity and\nstillness of evening, sometimes wandering among them month\nafter month, till at last their pale ashen colours seem to have\npassed into his painting; and on the crown of the head of the\nDavid there still remains a morsel of uncut stone, as if by one\ntouch to maintain its connexion with the place from which it was\nhewn.",
        "And it is in this penetrative suggestion of life that the secret of\nthat sweetness of his is to be found.  He gives us indeed no lovely\nnatural objects like Leonardo or Titian, but only the coldest, most\nelementary shadowing of rock or tree; no lovely draperies and\ncomely gestures of life, but only the austere truths of human\nnature; “simple persons\"–as he replied in his rough way to the\nquerulous criticism of Julius the Second, that there was no gold\non the figures of the Sistine Chapel–\"simple persons, who wore\nno gold on their garments\"; but he penetrates us with a feeling of\nthat power which we associate with all the warmth and fulness of\nthe world, the sense of which brings into one’s thoughts a swarm\nof birds and flowers and insects.  The brooding spirit of life itself\nis there; and the summer may burst out in a moment.",
        "He was born in an interval of a rapid mid-night journey in March,\nat a place in the neighbourhood of Arezzo, the thin, clear air of\nwhich was then thought to be favourable to the [78] birth of\nchildren of great parts.  He came of a race of grave and dignified\nmen, who, claiming kinship with the family of Canossa, and\nsome colour of imperial blood in their veins, had, generation after\ngeneration, received honourable employment under the\ngovernment of Florence.  His mother, a girl of nineteen years, put\nhim out to nurse at a country house among the hills of Settignano,\nwhere every other inhabitant is a worker in the marble quarries,\nand the child early became familiar with that strange first stage in\nthe sculptor’s art.  To this succeeded the influence of the sweetest\nand most placid master Florence had yet seen, Domenico\nGhirlandajo.  At fifteen he was at work among the curiosities of\nthe garden of the Medici, copying and restoring antiques,\nwinning the condescending notice of the great Lorenzo.  He knew\ntoo how to excite strong hatreds; and it was at this time that in a\nquarrel with a fellow-student he received a blow on the face\nwhich deprived him for ever of the comeliness of outward form.",
        "It was through an accident that he came to study those works of\nthe early Italian sculptors which suggested much of his own\ngrandest work, and impressed it with so deep a sweetness.  He\nbelieved in dreams and omens.  One of his friends dreamed twice\nthat Lorenzo, then lately dead, appeared to him in grey and dusty\napparel.  To Michelangelo this dream seemed to portend the\ntroubles which afterwards really came, and with [79] the\nsuddenness which was characteristic of all his movements, he left\nFlorence.  Having occasion to pass through Bologna, he\nneglected to procure the little seal of red wax which the stranger\nentering Bologna must carry on the thumb of his right hand.  He\nhad no money to pay the fine, and would have been thrown into\nprison had not one of the magistrates interposed.  He remained in\nthis man’s house a whole year, rewarding his hospitality by\nreadings from the Italian poets whom he loved.  Bologna, with its\nendless colonnades and fantastic leaning towers, can never have\nbeen one of the lovelier cities of Italy.  But about the portals of its\nvast unfinished churches and its dark shrines, half hidden by\nvotive flowers and candles, lie some of the sweetest works of the\nearly Tuscan sculptors, Giovanni da Pisa and Jacopo della\nQuercia, things as winsome as flowers; and the year which\nMichelangelo spent in copying these works was not a lost year.\nIt was now, on returning to Florence, that he put forth that unique\npresentment of Bacchus, which expresses, not the mirthfulness of\nthe god of wine, but his sleepy seriousness, his enthusiasm, his\ncapacity for profound dreaming.  No one ever expressed more\ntruly than Michelangelo the notion of inspired sleep, of faces\ncharged with dreams.  A vast fragment of marble had long lain\nbelow the Loggia of Orcagna, and many a sculptor had had his\nthoughts of a design which should just fill this famous block of\n[80] stone, cutting the diamond, as it were, without loss.  Under\nMichelangelo’s hand it became the David which stood till lately\non the steps of the Palazzo Vecchio, when it was replaced below\nthe Loggia.  Michelangelo was now thirty years old, and his\nreputation was established.  Three great works fill the remainder\nof his life–three works often interrupted, carried on through a\nthousand hesitations, a thousand disappointments, quarrels with\nhis patrons, quarrels with his family, quarrels perhaps most of all\nwith himself–the Sistine Chapel, the Mausoleum of Julius the\nSecond, and the Sacristy of San Lorenzo.",
        "In the story of Michelangelo’s life the strength, often turning to\nbitterness, is not far to seek.  A discordant note sounds\nthroughout it which almost spoils the music.  He “treats the Pope\nas the King of France himself would not dare to treat him”: he\ngoes along the streets of Rome “like an executioner,” Raphael\nsays of him.  Once he seems to have shut himself up with the\nintention of starving himself to death.  As we come, in reading\nhis life, on its harsh, untempered incidents, the thought again and\nagain arises that he is one of those who incur the judgment of\nDante, as having “wilfully lived in sadness.”  Even his tenderness\nand pity are embittered by their strength.  What passionate\nweeping in that mysterious figure which, in the Creation of\nAdam, crouches below the image of the Almighty, as he comes\nwith the forms of things to be, woman [81] and her progeny, in\nthe fold of his garment!  What a sense of wrong in those two\ncaptive youths, who feel the chains like scalding water on their\nproud and delicate flesh!  The idealist who became a reformer\nwith Savonarola, and a republican superintending the fortification\nof Florence–the nest where he was born, il nido ove naqqu’io, as\nhe calls it once, in a sudden throb of affection–in its last struggle\nfor liberty, yet believed always that he had imperial blood in his\nveins and was of the kindred of the great Matilda, had within the\ndepths of his nature some secret spring of indignation or sorrow.\nWe know little of his youth, but all tends to make one believe in\nthe vehemence of its passions.  Beneath the Platonic calm of the\nsonnets there is latent a deep delight in carnal form and colour.\nThere, and still more in the madrigals, he often falls into the\nlanguage of less tranquil affections; while some of them have the\ncolour of penitence, as from a wanderer returning home.  He who\nspoke so decisively of the supremacy in the imaginative world of\nthe unveiled human form had not been always, we may think, a\nmere Platonic lover.  Vague and wayward his loves may have\nbeen; but they partook of the strength of his nature, and\nsometimes, it may be, would by no means become music, so that\nthe comely order of his days was quite put out: par che amaro\nogni mio dolce io senta.",
        "But his genius is in harmony with itself; and [82] just as in the\nproducts of his art we find resources of sweetness within their\nexceeding strength, so in his own story also, bitter as the ordinary\nsense of it may be, there are select pages shut in among the rest–\npages one might easily turn over too lightly, but which yet\nsweeten the whole volume.  The interest of Michelangelo’s\npoems is that they make us spectators of this struggle; the\nstruggle of a strong nature to adorn and attune itself; the struggle\nof a desolating passion, which yearns to be resigned and sweet\nand pensive, as Dante’s was.  It is a consequence of the\noccasional and informal character of his poetry, that it brings us\nnearer to himself, his own mind and temper, than any work done\nonly to support a literary reputation could possibly do.  His letters\ntell us little that is worth knowing about him–a few poor quarrels\nabout money and commissions.  But it is quite otherwise with\nthese songs and sonnets, written down at odd moments,\nsometimes on the margins of his sketches, themselves often\nunfinished sketches, arresting some salient feeling or\nunpremeditated idea as it passed.  And it happens that a true\nstudy of these has become within the last few years for the first\ntime possible.  A few of the sonnets circulated widely in\nmanuscript, and became almost within Michelangelo’s own\nlifetime a subject of academical discourses.  But they were first\ncollected in a volume in 1623 by the great-nephew of\nMichelangelo, Michelangelo Buonarroti the younger.  He omitted\n[83] much, re-wrote the sonnets in part, and sometimes\ncompressed two or more compositions into one, always losing\nsomething of the force and incisiveness of the original.  So the\nbook remained, neglected even by Italians themselves in the last\ncentury, through the influence of that French taste which despised\nall compositions of the kind, as it despised and neglected Dante.\n\"His reputation will ever be on the increase, because he is so little\nread,” says Voltaire of Dante.–  But in 1858 the last of the\nBuonarroti bequeathed to the municipality of Florence the\ncuriosities of his family.  Among them was a precious volume\ncontaining the autograph of the sonnets.  A learned Italian, Signor\nCesare Guasti, undertook to collate this autograph with other\nmanuscripts at the Vatican and elsewhere, and in 1863 published\na true version of Michelangelo’s poems, with dissertations and a\nparaphrase.*",
        "People have often spoken of these poems as if they were a\nmere cry of distress, a lover’s complaint over the obduracy of\nVittoria Colonna.  But those who speak thus forget that though it\nis quite possible that Michelangelo had seen Vittoria, that\nsomewhat shadowy figure, as early as 1537, yet their closer\nintimacy did not begin till about the year 1542, when\nMichelangelo was nearly seventy years old.  Vittoria herself, an\nardent neo-catholic, vowed to perpetual widowhood since the\nnews [84] had reached her, seventeen years before, that her\nhusband, the youthful and princely Marquess of Pescara, lay dead\nof the wounds he had received in the battle of Pavia, was then no\nlonger an object of great passion.  In a dialogue written by the\npainter, Francesco d’ Ollanda, we catch a glimpse of them\ntogether in an empty church at Rome, one Sunday afternoon,\ndiscussing indeed the characteristics of various schools of art, but\nstill more the writings of Saint Paul, already following the ways\nand tasting the sunless pleasures of weary people, whose care for\nexternal things is slackening.  In a letter still extant he regrets that\nwhen he visited her after death he had kissed her hands only.  He\nmade, or set to work to make, a crucifix for her use, and two\ndrawings, perhaps in preparation for it, are now in Oxford.  From\nallusions in the sonnets, we may divine that when they first\napproached each other he had debated much with himself\nwhether this last passion would be the most unsoftening, the most\ndesolating of all–un dolce amaro, un si e no mi muovi.  Is it\ncarnal affection, or, del suo prestino stato (of Plato’s ante-natal\nstate) il raggio ardente?  The older, conventional criticism,\ndealing with the text of 1623, had lightly assumed that all or\nnearly all the sonnets were actually addressed to Vittoria herself;\nbut Signor Guasti finds only four, or at most five, which can be\nso attributed on genuine authority.  Still, there are reasons which\nmake him assign the majority of them to [85] the period between\n1542 and 1547, and we may regard the volume as a record of this\nresting-place in Michelangelo’s story.  We know how Goethe\nescaped from the stress of sentiments too strong for him by\nmaking a book about them; and for Michelangelo, to write down\nhis passionate thoughts at all, to express them in a sonnet, was\nalready in some measure to command, and have his way with\nthem–",
        "It was just because Vittoria raised no great passion that the space\nin his life where she reigns has such peculiar suavity; and the\nspirit of the sonnets is lost if we once take them out of that\ndreamy atmosphere in which men have things as they will,\nbecause the hold of all outward things upon them is faint and\nuncertain.  Their prevailing tone is a calm and meditative\nsweetness.  The cry of distress is indeed there, but as a mere\nresidue, a trace of bracing chalybeate salt, just discernible in the\nsong which rises like a clear, sweet spring from a charmed space\nin his life.",
        "This charmed and temperate space in Michelangelo’s life,\nwithout which its excessive strength would have been so\nimperfect, which saves him from the judgment of Dante on those\nwho “wilfully lived in sadness,” is then a well-defined period\nthere, reaching from the year 1542 to the year 1547, the year of\nVittoria’s death.  In [86] it the lifelong effort to tranquillise his\nvehement emotions by withdrawing them into the region of ideal\nsentiment, becomes successful; and the significance of Vittoria is,\nthat she realises for him a type of affection which even in\ndisappointment may charm and sweeten his spirit.",
        "In this effort to tranquillise and sweeten life by idealising its\nvehement sentiments, there were two great traditional types,\neither of which an Italian of the sixteenth century might have\nfollowed.  There was Dante, whose little book of the Vita Nuova\nhad early become a pattern of imaginative love, maintained\nsomewhat feebly by the later followers of Petrarch; and, since\nPlato had become something more than a name in Italy by the\npublication of the Latin translation of his works by Marsilio\nFicino, there was the Platonic tradition also.  Dante’s belief in the\nresurrection of the body, through which, even in heaven, Beatrice\nloses for him no tinge of flesh-colour, or fold of raiment even;\nand the Platonic dream of the passage of the soul through one\nform of life after another, with its passionate haste to escape from\nthe burden of bodily form altogether; are, for all effects of art or\npoetry, principles diametrically opposite.  Now it is the Platonic\ntradition rather than Dante’s that has moulded Michelangelo’s\nverse.  In many ways no sentiment could have been less like\nDante’s love for Beatrice than Michelangelo’s for Vittoria\nColonna.  Dante’s comes in early youth: Beatrice [87] is a child,\nwith the wistful, ambiguous vision of a child, with a character\nstill unaccentuated by the influence of outward circumstances,\nalmost expressionless.  Vittoria, on the other hand, is a woman\nalready weary, in advanced age, of grave intellectual qualities.\nDante’s story is a piece of figured work, inlaid with lovely\nincidents.  In Michelangelo’s poems, frost and fire are almost the\nonly images–the refining fire of the goldsmith; once or twice the\nphoenix; ice melting at the fire; fire struck from the rock which it\nafterwards consumes.  Except one doubtful allusion to a journey,\nthere are almost no incidents.  But there is much of the bright,\nsharp, unerring skill, with which in boyhood he gave the look of\nage to the head of a faun by chipping a tooth from its jaw with a\nsingle stroke of the hammer.  For Dante, the amiable and devout\nmaterialism of the middle age sanctifies all that is presented by\nhand and eye; while Michelangelo is always pressing forward\nfrom the outward beauty–il bel del fuor che agli occhi piace, to\napprehend the unseen beauty; trascenda nella forma universale–\nthat abstract form of beauty, about which the Platonists reason.\nAnd this gives the impression in him of something flitting and\nunfixed, of the houseless and complaining spirit, almost\nclairvoyant through the frail and yielding flesh.  He accounts for\nlove at first sight by a previous state of existence–la dove io t’\namai prima.",
        "And yet there are many points in which he [88] is really like\nDante, and comes very near to the original image, beyond those\nlater and feebler followers in the wake of Petrarch.  He learns\nfrom Dante rather than from Plato, that for lovers, the surfeiting\nof desire–ove gran desir gran copia affrena, is a state less happy\nthan poverty with abundance of hope–una miseria di speranza\npiena.  He recalls him in the repetition of the words gentile and\ncortesia, in the personification of Amor, in the tendency to dwell\nminutely on the physical effects of the presence of a beloved\nobject on the pulses and the heart.  Above all, he resembles Dante\nin the warmth and intensity of his political utterances, for the lady\nof one of his noblest sonnets was from the first understood to be\nthe city of Florence; and he avers that all must be asleep in\nheaven, if she, who was created “of angelic form,” for a thousand\nlovers, is appropriated by one alone, some Piero, or Alessandro\nde’ Medici.  Once and again he introduces Love and Death, who\ndispute concerning him.  For, like Dante and all the nobler souls\nof Italy, he is much occupied with thoughts of the grave, and his\ntrue mistress is death,–death at first as the worst of all sorrows\nand disgraces, with a clod of the field for its brain; afterwards,\ndeath in its high distinction, its detachment from vulgar needs,\nthe angry stains of life and action escaping fast.",
        "Some of those whom the gods love die young.  This man,\nbecause the gods loved him, lingered [89] on to be of immense,\npatriarchal age, till the sweetness it had taken so long to secrete\nin him was found at last.  Out of the strong came forth sweetness,\nex forti dulcedo.  The world had changed around him.  The “new\ncatholicism” had taken the place of the Renaissance.  The spirit\nof the Roman Church had changed: in the vast world’s cathedral\nwhich his skill had helped to raise for it, it looked stronger than\never.  Some of the first members of the Oratory were among his\nintimate associates.  They were of a spirit as unlike as possible\nfrom that of Lorenzo, or Savonarola even.  The opposition of the\nReformation to art has been often enlarged upon; far greater was\nthat of the Catholic revival.  But in thus fixing itself in a frozen\northodoxy, the Roman Church had passed beyond him, and he\nwas a stranger to it.  In earlier days, when its beliefs had been in a\nfluid state, he too might have been drawn into the controversy.\nHe might have been for spiritualising the papal sovereignty, like\nSavonarola; or for adjusting the dreams of Plato and Homer with\nthe words of Christ, like Pico of Mirandola.  But things had\nmoved onward, and such adjustments were no longer possible.\nFor himself, he had long since fallen back on that divine ideal,\nwhich above the wear and tear of creeds has been forming itself\nfor ages as the possession of nobler souls.  And now he began to\nfeel the soothing influence which since that time the Roman [90]\nChurch has often exerted over spirits too independent to be its\nsubjects, yet brought within the neighbourhood of its action;\nconsoled and tranquillised, as a traveller might be, resting for one\nevening in a strange city, by its stately aspect and the sentiment\nof its many fortunes, just because with those fortunes he has\nnothing to do.  So he lingers on; a revenant, as the French say, a\nghost out of another age, in a world too coarse to touch his faint\nsensibilities very closely; dreaming, in a worn-out society,\ntheatrical in its life, theatrical in its art, theatrical even in its\ndevotion, on the morning of the world’s history, on the primitive\nform of man, on the images under which that primitive world had\nconceived of spiritual forces.",
        "I have dwelt on the thought of Michelangelo as thus lingering\nbeyond his time in a world not his own, because, if one is to\ndistinguish the peculiar savour of his work, he must be\napproached, not through his followers, but through his\npredecessors; not through the marbles of Saint Peter’s, but\nthrough the work of the sculptors of the fifteenth century over the\ntombs and altars of Tuscany.  He is the last of the Florentines, of\nthose on whom the peculiar sentiment of the Florence of Dante\nand Giotto descended: he is the consummate representative of the\nform that sentiment took in the fifteenth century with men like\nLuca Signorelli and Mino [91] da Fiesole.  Up to him the\ntradition of sentiment is unbroken, the progress towards surer and\nmore mature methods of expressing that sentiment continuous.\nBut his professed disciples did not share this temper; they are in\nlove with his strength only, and seem not to feel his grave and\ntemperate sweetness.  Theatricality is their chief characteristic;\nand that is a quality as little attributable to Michelangelo as to\nMino or Luca Signorelli.  With him, as with them, all is serious,\npassionate, impulsive.",
        "This discipleship of Michelangelo, this dependence of his on the\ntradition of the Florentine schools, is nowhere seen more clearly\nthan in his treatment of the Creation.  The Creation of Man had\nhaunted the mind of the middle age like a dream; and weaving it\ninto a hundred carved ornaments of capital or doorway, the\nItalian sculptors had early impressed upon it that pregnancy of\nexpression which seems to give it many veiled meanings.  As\nwith other artistic conceptions of the middle age, its treatment\nbecame almost conventional, handed on from artist to artist, with\nslight changes, till it came to have almost an independent and\nabstract existence of its own.  It was characteristic of the\nmedieval mind thus to give an independent traditional existence\nto a special pictorial conception, or to a legend, like that of\nTristram or Tannhauser, or even to the very thoughts and\nsubstance of a book, like the Imitation, so that no single workman\ncould [92] claim it as his own, and the book, the image, the\nlegend, had itself a legend, and its fortunes, and a personal\nhistory; and it is a sign of the medievalism of Michelangelo, that\nhe thus receives from tradition his central conception, and does\nbut add the last touches, in transferring it to the frescoes of the\nSistine Chapel.",
        "But there was another tradition of those earlier, more serious\nFlorentines, of which Michelangelo is the inheritor, to which he\ngives the final expression, and which centres in the sacristy of\nSan Lorenzo, as the tradition of the Creation centres in the\nSistine Chapel.  It has been said that all the great Florentines\nwere preoccupied with death.  Outre-tombe!  Outre-tombe!–is\nthe burden of their thoughts, from Dante to Savonarola.  Even the\ngay and licentious Boccaccio gives a keener edge to his stories by\nputting them in the mouths of a party of people who had taken\nrefuge in a country-house from the danger of death by plague.  It\nwas to this inherited sentiment, this practical decision that to be\npreoccupied with the thought of death was in itself dignifying,\nand a note of high quality, that the seriousness of the great\nFlorentines of the fifteenth century was partly due; and it was\nreinforced in them by the actual sorrows of their times.  How\noften, and in what various ways, had they seen life stricken down,\nin their streets and houses La bella Simonetta dies in early youth,\nand is borne to the grave with uncovered face.  The [93] young\nCardinal Jacopo di Portogallo dies on a visit to Florence–insignis\nforma fui et mirabili modestia–his epitaph dares to say.  Antonio\nRossellino carves his tomb in the church of San Miniato, with\ncare for the shapely hands and feet, and sacred attire; Luca della\nRobbia puts his skyiest works there; and the tomb of the youthful\nand princely prelate became the strangest and most beautiful\nthing in that strange and beautiful place.  After the execution of\nthe Pazzi conspirators, Botticelli is employed to paint their\nportraits.  This preoccupation with serious thoughts and sad\nimages might easily have resulted, as it did, for instance, in the\ngloomy villages of the Rhine, or in the overcrowded parts of\nmedieval Paris, as it still does in many a village of the Alps, in\nsomething merely morbid or grotesque, in the Danse Macabre of\nmany French and German painters, or the grim inventions of\nDurer.  From such a result the Florentine masters of the fifteenth\ncentury were saved by the nobility of their Italian culture, and\nstill more by their tender pity for  the thing itself.  They must\noften have leaned over the lifeless body, when all was at length\nquiet and smoothed out.  After death, it is said, the traces of\nslighter and more superficial dispositions disappear; the lines\nbecome more simple and dignified; only the abstract lines\nremain, in a great indifference.  They came thus to see death in its\ndistinction.  Then following it perhaps one [94] stage further,\ndwelling for a moment on the point where all this transitory\ndignity must break up, and discerning with no clearness a new\nbody, they paused just in time, and abstained, with a sentiment of\nprofound pity.",
        "Of all this sentiment Michelangelo is the achievement; and, first\nof all, of pity.  Pieta, pity, the pity of the Virgin Mother over the\ndead body of Christ, expanded into the pity of all mothers over\nall dead sons, the entombment, with its cruel “hard stones”:–this\nis the subject of his predilection.  He has left it in many forms,\nsketches, half-finished designs, finished and unfinished groups of\nsculpture; but always as a hopeless, rayless, almost heathen\nsorrow–no divine sorrow, but mere pity and awe at the stiff limbs\nand colourless lips.  There is a drawing of his at Oxford, in which\nthe dead body has sunk to the earth between the mother’s feet,\nwith the arms extended over her knees.  The tombs in the sacristy\nof San Lorenzo are memorials, not of any of the nobler and\ngreater Medici, but of Giuliano, and Lorenzo the younger,\nnoticeable chiefly for their somewhat early death.  It is mere\nhuman nature therefore which has prompted the sentiment here.\nThe titles assigned traditionally to the four symbolical figures,\nNight and Day, The Twilight and The Dawn, are far too definite\nfor them; for these figures come much nearer to the mind and\nspirit of their author, and are a more direct expression [95] of his\nthoughts, than any merely symbolical conceptions could possibly\nhave been.  They concentrate and express, less by way of definite\nconceptions than by the touches, the promptings of a piece of\nmusic, all those vague fancies, misgivings, presentiments, which\nshift and mix and are defined and fade again, whenever the\nthoughts try to fix themselves with sincerity on the conditions\nand surroundings of the disembodied spirit.  I suppose no one\nwould come to the sacristy of San Lorenzo for consolation; for\nseriousness, for solemnity, for dignity of impression, perhaps, but\nnot for consolation.  It is a place neither of consoling nor of\nterrible thoughts, but of vague and wistful speculation.  Here,\nagain, Michelangelo is the disciple not so much of Dante as of\nthe Platonists.  Dante’s belief in immortality is formal, precise\nand firm, almost as much so as that of a child, who thinks the\ndead will hear if you cry loud enough.  But in Michelangelo you\nhave maturity, the mind of the grown man, dealing cautiously and\ndispassionately with serious things; and what hope he has is\nbased on the consciousness of ignorance–ignorance of man,\nignorance of the nature of the mind, its origin and capacities.\nMichelangelo is so ignorant of the spiritual world, of the new\nbody and its laws, that he does not surely know whether the\nconsecrated Host may not be the body of Christ.  And of all that\nrange of sentiment he is the poet, a poet still alive, and in [96]\npossession of our inmost thoughts–dumb inquiry over the relapse\nafter death into the formlessness which preceded life, the change,\nthe revolt from that change, then the correcting, hallowing,\nconsoling rush of pity; at last, far off, thin and vague, yet not\nmore vague than the most definite thoughts men have had\nthrough three centuries on a matter that has been so near their\nhearts, the new body–a passing light, a mere intangible, external\neffect, over those too rigid, or too formless faces; a dream that\nlingers a moment, retreating in the dawn, incomplete, aimless,\nhelpless; a thing with faint hearing, faint memory, faint power of\ntouch; a breath, a flame in the doorway, a feather in the wind.",
        "The qualities of the great masters in art or literature, the\ncombination of those qualities, the laws by which they moderate,\nsupport, relieve each other, are not peculiar to them; but most\noften typical standards, or revealing instances of the laws by\nwhich certain aesthetic effects are produced.  The old masters\nindeed are simpler; their characteristics are written larger, and are\neasier to read, than the analogues of them in all the mixed,\nconfused productions of the modern mind.  But when once we\nhave succeeded in defining for ourselves those characteristics,\nand the law of their combination, we have acquired a standard or\nmeasure which helps us to put in its right place many a vagrant\ngenius, many an unclassified talent, many precious though\nimperfect [97] products of art.  It is so with the components of the\ntrue character of Michelangelo.  That strange interfusion of\nsweetness and strength is not to be found in those who claimed to\nbe his followers; but it is found in many of those who worked\nbefore him, and in many others down to our own time, in William\nBlake, for instance, and Victor Hugo, who, though not of his\nschool, and unaware, are his true sons, and help us to understand\nhim, as he in turn interprets and justifies them.  Perhaps this is the\nchief use in studying old masters.",
        "1871.",
        "[98] IN Vasari’s life of Leonardo da Vinci as we now read it there are\nsome variations from the first edition.  There, the painter who has\nfixed the outward type of Christ for succeeding centuries was a\nbold speculator, holding lightly by other men’s beliefs, setting\nphilosophy above Christianity.  Words of his, trenchant enough\nto justify this impression, are not recorded, and would have been\nout of keeping with a genius of which one characteristic is the\ntendency to lose itself in a refined and graceful mystery.  The\nsuspicion was but the time-honoured mode in which the world\nstamps its appreciation of one who has thoughts for himself\nalone, his high indifference, his intolerance of the common forms\nof things; and in the second edition the image was changed into\nsomething fainter and more conventional.  But it is still by a\ncertain mystery in his work, and something enigmatical beyond\nthe usual measure of great men, that he fascinates, or perhaps half\nrepels.  His life is one of sudden [99] revolts, with intervals in\nwhich he works not at all, or apart from the main scope of his\nwork.  By a strange fortune the pictures on which his more\npopular fame rested disappeared early from the world, like the\nBattle of the Standard; or are mixed obscurely with the product\nof meaner hands, like the Last Supper.  His type of beauty is so\nexotic that it fascinates a larger number than it delights, and\nseems more than that of any other artist to reflect ideas and views\nand some scheme of the world within; so that he seemed to his\ncontemporaries to be the possessor of some unsanctified and\nsecret wisdom; as to Michelet and others to have anticipated\nmodern ideas.  He trifles with his genius, and crowds all his chief\nwork into a few tormented years of later life; yet he is so\npossessed by his genius that he passes unmoved through the most\ntragic events, overwhelming his country and friends, like one\nwho comes across them by chance on some secret errand.",
        "His legend, as the French say, with the anecdotes which every\none remembers, is one of the most brilliant chapters of Vasari.\nLater writers merely copied it, until, in 1804, Carlo Amoretti\napplied to it a criticism which left hardly a date fixed, and not one\nof those anecdotes untouched.  The various questions thus raised\nhave since that time become, one after another, subjects of\nspecial study, and mere antiquarianism has in this direction little\nmore to do.  For others remain the editing of [100] the thirteen\nbooks of his manuscripts, and the separation by technical\ncriticism of what in his reputed works is really his, from what is\nonly half his, or the work of his pupils.  But a lover of strange\nsouls may still analyse for himself the impression made on him\nby those works, and try to reach through it a definition of the\nchief elements of Leonardo’s genius.  The legend, as corrected\nand enlarged by its critics, may now and then intervene to support\nthe results of this analysis.",
        "His life has three divisions–thirty years at Florence, nearly\ntwenty years at Milan, then nineteen years of wandering, till he\nsinks to rest under the protection of Francis the First at the\nChateau de Clou.  The dishonour of illegitimacy hangs over his\nbirth.  Piero Antonio, his father, was of a noble Florentine house,\nof Vinci in the Val d’Arno, and Leonardo, brought up delicately\namong the true children of that house, was the love-child of his\nyouth, with the keen, puissant nature such children often have.\nWe see him in his boyhood fascinating all men by his beauty,\nimprovising music and songs, buying the caged birds and setting\nthem free, as he walked the streets of Florence, fond of odd bright\ndresses and spirited horses.",
        "From his earliest years he designed many objects, and\nconstructed models in relief, of which Vasari mentions some of\nwomen smiling.  His father, pondering over this promise in the\n[101] child, took him to the workshop of Andrea del Verrocchio,\nthen the most famous artist in Florence.  Beautiful objects lay\nabout there–reliquaries, pyxes, silver images for the pope’s\nchapel at Rome, strange fancy-work of the middle age, keeping\nodd company with fragments of antiquity, then but lately\ndiscovered.  Another student Leonardo may have seen there–a\nlad into whose soul the level light and aerial illusions of Italian\nsunsets had passed, in after days famous as Perugino.  Verrocchio\nwas an artist of the earlier Florentine type, carver, painter, and\nworker in metals, in one; designer, not of pictures only, but of all\nthings for sacred or household use, drinking-vessels, ambries,\ninstruments of music, making them all fair to look upon, filling\nthe common ways of life with the reflexion of some far-off\nbrightness; and years of patience had refined his hand till his\nwork was now sought after from distant places.",
        "It happened that Verrocchio was employed by the brethren of\nVallombrosa to paint the Baptism of Christ, and Leonardo was\nallowed to finish an angel in the left-hand corner.  It was one of\nthose moments in which the progress of a great thing–here, that\nof the art of Italy–presses hard on the happiness of an individual,\nthrough whose discouragement and decrease, humanity, in more\nfortunate persons, comes a step nearer to its final success.",
        "For beneath the cheerful exterior of the mere [102] well-paid\ncraftsman, chasing brooches for the copes of Santa Maria\nNovella, or twisting metal screens for the tombs of the Medici,\nlay the ambitious desire to expand the destiny of Italian art by a\nlarger knowledge and insight into things, a purpose in art not\nunlike Leonardo’s still unconscious purpose; and often, in the\nmodelling of drapery, or of a lifted arm, or of hair cast back from\nthe face, there came to him something of the freer manner and\nricher humanity of a later age.  But in this Baptism the pupil had\nsurpassed the master; and Verrocchio turned away as one\nstunned, and as if his sweet earlier work must thereafter be\ndistasteful to him, from the bright animated angel of Leonardo’s\nhand.",
        "The angel may still be seen in Florence, a space of sunlight in the\ncold, laboured old picture; but the legend is true only in\nsentiment, for painting had always been the art by which\nVerrocchio set least store.  And as in a sense he anticipates\nLeonardo, so to the last Leonardo recalls the studio of\nVerrocchio, in the love of beautiful toys, such as the vessel of\nwater for a mirror, and lovely needle-work about the implicated\nhands in the Modesty and Vanity, and of reliefs, like those\ncameos which in the Virgin of the Balances hang all round the\ngirdle of Saint Michael, and of bright variegated stones, such as\nthe agates in the Saint Anne, and in a hieratic preciseness and\ngrace, as of a sanctuary swept and [103] garnished.  Amid all the\ncunning and intricacy of his Lombard manner this never left him.\nMuch of it there must have been in that lost picture of Paradise,\nwhich he prepared as a cartoon for tapestry, to be woven in the\nlooms of Flanders.  It was the perfection of the older Florentine\nstyle of miniature-painting, with patient putting of each leaf upon\nthe trees and each flower in the grass, where the first man and\nwoman were standing.",
        "And because it was the perfection of that style, it awoke in\nLeonardo some seed of discontent which lay in the secret places\nof his nature.  For the way to perfection is through a series of\ndisgusts; and this picture–all that he had done so far in his life at\nFlorence–was after all in the old slight manner.  His art, if it was\nto be something in the world, must be weighted with more of the\nmeaning of nature and purpose of humanity.  Nature was “the\ntrue mistress of higher intelligences.”  He plunged, then, into the\nstudy of nature.  And in doing this he followed the manner of the\nolder students; he brooded over the hidden virtues of plants and\ncrystals, the lines traced by the stars as they moved in the sky,\nover the correspondences which exist between the different\norders of living things, through which, to eyes opened, they\ninterpret each other; and for years he seemed to those about him\nas one listening to a voice, silent for other men.",
        "[104] He learned here the art of going deep, of tracking the\nsources of expression to their subtlest retreats, the power of an\nintimate presence in the things he handled.  He did not at once or\nentirely desert his art; only he was no longer the cheerful,\nobjective painter, through whose soul, as through clear glass, the\nbright figures of Florentine life, only made a little mellower and\nmore pensive by the transit, passed on to the white wall.  He\nwasted many days in curious tricks of design, seeming to lose\nhimself in the spinning of intricate devices of line and colour.  He\nwas smitten with a love of the impossible–the perforation of\nmountains, changing the course of rivers, raising great buildings,\nsuch as the church of San Giovanni, in the air; all those feats for\nthe performance of which natural magic professed to have the\nkey.  Later writers, indeed, see in these efforts an anticipation of\nmodern mechanics; in him they were rather dreams, thrown off\nby the overwrought and labouring brain.  Two ideas were\nespecially confirmed in him, as reflexes of things that had\ntouched his brain in childhood beyond the depth of other\nimpressions–the smiling of women and the motion of great\nwaters.",
        "And in such studies some interfusion of the extremes of beauty\nand terror shaped itself, as an image that might be seen and\ntouched, in the mind of this gracious youth, so fixed that for the\nrest of his life it never left him.  As if catching [105] glimpses of\nit in the strange eyes or hair of chance people, he would follow\nsuch about the streets of Florence till the sun went down, of\nwhom many sketches of his remain.  Some of these are full of a\ncurious beauty, that remote beauty which may be apprehended\nonly by those who have sought it carefully; who, starting with\nacknowledged types of beauty, have refined as far upon these, as\nthese refine upon the world of common forms.  But mingled\ninextricably with this there is an element of mockery also; so that,\nwhether in sorrow or scorn, he caricatures Dante even.  Legions\nof grotesques sweep under his hand; for has not nature too her\ngrotesques–the rent rock, the distorting lights of evening on\nlonely roads, the unveiled structure of man in the embryo, or the\nskeleton?",
        "All these swarming fancies unite in the Medusa of the Uffizii.\nVasari’s story of an earlier Medusa, painted on a wooden shield,\nis perhaps an invention; and yet, properly told, has more of the air\nof truth about it than anything else in the whole legend.  For its\nreal subject is not the serious work of a man, but the experiment\nof a child.  The lizards and glow-worms and other strange small\ncreatures which haunt an Italian vineyard bring before one the\nwhole picture of a child’s life in a Tuscan dwelling–half castle,\nhalf farm–and are as true to nature as the pretended\nastonishment [106] of the father for whom the boy has prepared\na surprise.  It was not in play that he painted that other Medusa,\nthe one great picture which he left behind him in Florence.  The\nsubject has been treated in various ways; Leonardo alone cuts to\nits centre; he alone realises it as the head of a corpse, exercising\nits powers through all the circumstances of death.  What may be\ncalled the fascination of corruption penetrates in every touch its\nexquisitely finished beauty.  About the dainty lines of the cheek\nthe bat flits unheeded.  The delicate snakes seem literally\nstrangling each other in terrified struggle to escape from the\nMedusa brain.  The hue which violent death always brings with it\nis in the features; features singularly massive and grand, as we\ncatch them inverted, in a dexterous foreshortening, crown\nforemost, like a great calm stone against which the wave of\nserpents breaks.",
        "The science of that age was all divination, clairvoyance,\nunsubjected to our exact modern formulas, seeking in an instant\nof vision to concentrate a thousand experiences.  Later writers,\nthinking only of the well-ordered treatise on painting which a\nFrenchman, Raffaelle du Fresne, a hundred years afterwards,\ncompiled from Leonardo’s bewildered manuscripts, written\nstrangely, as his manner was, from right to left, have imagined a\nrigid order in his inquiries.  But this rigid order would have been\nlittle in [107] accordance with the restlessness of his character;\nand if we think of him as the mere reasoner who subjects design\nto anatomy, and composition to mathematical rules, we shall\nhardly have that impression which those around Leonardo\nreceived from him.  Poring over his crucibles, making\nexperiments with colour, trying, by a strange variation of the\nalchemist’s dream, to discover the secret, not of an elixir to make\nman’s natural life immortal, but of giving immortality to the\nsubtlest and most delicate effects of painting, he seemed to them\nrather the sorcerer or the magician, possessed of curious secrets\nand a hidden knowledge, living in a world of which he alone\npossessed the key.  What his philosophy seems to have been most\nlike is that of Paracelsus or Cardan; and much of the spirit of the\nolder alchemy still hangs about it, with its confidence in short\ncuts and odd byways to knowledge.  To him philosophy was to\nbe something giving strange swiftness and double sight, divining\nthe sources of springs beneath the earth or of expression beneath\nthe human countenance, clairvoyant of occult gifts in common or\nuncommon things, in the reed at the brook-side, or the star which\ndraws near to us but once in a century.  How, in this way, the\nclear purpose was overclouded, the fine chaser’s hand perplexed,\nwe but dimly see; the mystery which at no point quite lifts from\nLeonardo’s life is deepest here.  But it is [108] certain that at one\nperiod of his life he had almost ceased to be an artist.",
        "The year 1483–the year of the birth of Raphael and the thirty-\nfirst of Leonardo’s life–is fixed as the date of his visit to Milan\nby the letter in which he recommends himself to Ludovico\nSforza, and offers to tell him, for a price, strange secrets in the art\nof war.  It was that Sforza who murdered his young nephew by\nslow poison, yet was so susceptible of religious impressions that\nhe blended mere earthly passion with a sort of religious\nsentimentalism, and who took for his device the mulberry-tree–\nsymbol, in its long delay and sudden yielding of flowers and fruit\ntogether, of a wisdom which economises all forces for an\nopportunity of sudden and sure effect.  The fame of Leonardo had\ngone before him, and he was to model a colossal statue of\nFrancesco, the first Duke of Milan.  As for Leonardo himself, he\ncame not as an artist at all, or careful of the fame of one; but as a\nplayer on the harp, a strange harp of silver of his own\nconstruction, shaped in some curious likeness to a horse’s skull.\nThe capricious spirit of Ludovico was susceptible also to the\npower of music, and Leonardo’s nature had a kind of spell in it.\nFascination is always the word descriptive of him.  No portrait of\nhis youth remains; but all tends to make us believe that up to this\ntime some charm of voice and aspect, strong enough to balance\nthe disadvantage of his birth, had [109] played about him.  His\nphysical strength was great; it was said that he could bend a\nhorseshoe like a coil of lead.",
        "The Duomo, work of artists from beyond the Alps, so fantastic to\nthe eye of a Florentine used to the mellow, unbroken surfaces of\nGiotto and Arnolfo, was then in all its freshness; and below, in\nthe streets of Milan, moved a people as fantastic, changeful, and\ndreamlike.  To Leonardo least of all men could there be anything\npoisonous in the exotic flowers of sentiment which grew there.  It\nwas a life of brilliant sins and exquisite amusements: Leonardo\nbecame a celebrated designer of pageants; and it suited the\nquality of his genius, composed, in almost equal parts, of\ncuriosity and the desire of beauty, to take things as they came.",
        "Curiosity and the desire of beauty–these are the two elementary\nforces in Leonardo’s genius; curiosity often in conflict with the\ndesire of beauty, but generating, in union with it, a type of subtle\nand curious grace.",
        "The movement of the fifteenth century was twofold; partly the\nRenaissance, partly also the coming of what is called the\n\"modern spirit,” with its realism, its appeal to experience.  It\ncomprehended a return to antiquity, and a return to nature.\nRaphael represents the return to antiquity, and Leonardo the\nreturn to nature.  In this return to nature, he was seeking to satisfy\na boundless curiosity by her perpetual surprises, [110] a\nmicroscopic sense of finish by her finesse, or delicacy of\noperation, that subtilitas naturae which Bacon notices.  So we\nfind him often in intimate relations with men of science,–with\nFra Luca Paccioli the mathematician, and the anatomist Marc\nAntonio della Torre.  His observations and experiments fill\nthirteen volumes of manuscript; and those who can judge\ndescribe him as anticipating long before, by rapid intuition, the\nlater ideas of science.  He explained the obscure light of the\nunilluminated part of the moon, knew that the sea had once\ncovered the mountains which contain shells, and of the gathering\nof the equatorial waters above the polar.",
        "He who thus penetrated into the most secret parts of nature\npreferred always the more to the less remote, what, seeming\nexceptional, was an instance of law more refined, the\nconstruction about things of a peculiar atmosphere and mixed\nlights.  He paints flowers with such curious felicity that different\nwriters have attributed to him a fondness for particular flowers,\nas Clement the cyclamen, and Rio the jasmin; while, at Venice,\nthere is a stray leaf from his portfolio dotted all over with studies\nof violets and the wild rose.  In him first appears the taste for\nwhat is bizarre or recherche in landscape; hollow places full of\nthe green shadow of bituminous rocks, ridged reefs of trap-rock\nwhich cut the water into quaint sheets of light,–their exact\nantitype is in our own western seas; all the [111] solemn effects\nof moving water.  You may follow it springing from its distant\nsource among the rocks on the heath of the Madonna of the\nBalances, passing, as a little fall, into the treacherous calm of the\nMadonna of the Lake, as a goodly river next, below the cliffs of\nthe Madonna of the Rocks, washing the white walls of its distant\nvillages, stealing out in a network of divided streams in La\nGioconda to the seashore of the Saint Anne–that delicate place,\nwhere the wind passes like the hand of some fine etcher over the\nsurface, and the untorn shells are lying thick upon the sand, and\nthe tops of the rocks, to which the waves never rise, are green\nwith grass, grown fine as hair.  It is the landscape, not of dreams\nor of fancy, but of places far withdrawn, and hours selected from\na thousand with a miracle of finesse.  Through Leonardo’s\nstrange veil of sight things reach him so; in no ordinary night or\nday, but as in faint light of eclipse, or in some brief interval of\nfalling rain at daybreak, or through deep water.",
        "And not into nature only; but he plunged also into human\npersonality, and became above all a painter of portraits; faces of a\nmodelling more skilful than has been seen before or since,\nembodied with a reality which almost amounts to illusion, on the\ndark air.  To take a character as it was, and delicately sound its\nstops, suited one so curious in observation, curious in invention.\nHe painted thus the portraits of Ludovico’s [112] mistresses,\nLucretia Crivelli and Cecilia Galerani the poetess, of Ludovico\nhimself, and the Duchess Beatrice.  The portrait of Cecilia\nGalerani is lost, but that of Lucretia Crivelli has been identified\nwith La Belle Feroniere of the Louvre, and Ludovico’s pale,\nanxious face still remains in the Ambrosian library.  Opposite is\nthe portrait of Beatrice d’Este, in whom Leonardo seems to have\ncaught some presentiment of early death, painting her precise and\ngrave, full of the refinement of the dead, in sad earth-coloured\nraiment, set with pale stones.",
        "Sometimes this curiosity came in conflict with the desire of\nbeauty; it tended to make him go too far below that outside of\nthings in which art really begins and ends.  This struggle between\nthe reason and its ideas, and the senses, the desire of beauty, is\nthe key to Leonardo’s life at Milan–his restlessness, his endless\nre-touchings, his odd experiments with colour.  How much must\nhe leave unfinished, how much recommence!  His problem was\nthe transmutation of ideas into images.  What he had attained so\nfar had been the mastery of that earlier Florentine style, with its\nnaive and limited sensuousness.  Now he was to entertain in this\nnarrow medium those divinations of a humanity too wide for it,\nthat larger vision of the opening world, which is only not too\nmuch for the great, irregular art of Shakespeare; and everywhere\nthe effort is visible in the work of his hands.  This agitation, this\n[113] perpetual delay, give him an air of weariness and ennui.  To\nothers he seems to be aiming at an impossible effect, to do\nsomething that art, that painting, can never do.  Often the\nexpression of physical beauty at this or that point seems strained\nand marred in the effort, as in those heavy German foreheads–\ntoo heavy and German for perfect beauty.",
        "For there was a touch of Germany in that genius which, as\nGoethe said, had “thought itself weary\"–mude sich gedacht.\nWhat an anticipation of modern Germany, for instance, in that\ndebate on the question whether sculpture or painting is the nobler\nart!*  But there is this difference between him and the German,\nthat, with all that curious science, the German would have\nthought nothing more was needed.  The name of Goethe himself\nreminds one how great for the artist may be the danger of\novermuch science; how Goethe, who, in the Elective Affinities\nand the first part of Faust, does transmute ideas into images, who\nwrought many such transmutations, did not invariably find the\nspell-word, and in the second part of Faust presents us with a\nmass of science which has almost no artistic character at all.  But\nLeonardo will never work till the happy moment comes–that\nmoment of bien-etre, which to imaginative men is a moment of\ninvention.  On this he waits with [114] a perfect patience; other\nmoments are but a preparation, or after-taste of it.  Few men\ndistinguish between them as jealously as he.  Hence so many\nflaws even in the choicest work.  But for Leonardo the distinction\nis absolute, and, in the moment of bien-etre, the alchemy\ncomplete: the idea is stricken into colour and imagery: a cloudy\nmysticism is refined to a subdued and graceful mystery, and\npainting pleases the eye while it satisfies the soul.",
        "This curious beauty is seen above all in his drawings, and in these\nchiefly in the abstract grace of the bounding lines.  Let us take\nsome of these drawings, and pause over them awhile; and, first,\none of those at Florence–the heads of a woman and a little child,\nset side by side, but each in its own separate frame.  First of all,\nthere is much pathos in the reappearance, in the fuller curves of\nthe face of the child, of the sharper, more chastened lines of the\nworn and older face, which leaves no doubt that the heads are\nthose of a little child and its mother.  A feeling for maternity is\nindeed always characteristic of Leonardo; and this feeling is\nfurther indicated here by the half-humorous pathos of the\ndiminutive, rounded shoulders of the child.  You may note a like\npathetic power in drawings of a young man, seated in a stooping\nposture, his face in his hands, as in sorrow; of a slave sitting in an\nuneasy inclined attitude, in some brief interval of rest; of a small\nMadonna and Child, [115] peeping sideways in half-reassured\nterror, as a mighty griffin with batlike wings, one of Leonardo’s\nfinest inventions, descends suddenly from the air to snatch up a\ngreat wild beast wandering near them.  But note in these, as that\nwhich especially belongs to art, the contour of the young man’s\nhair, the poise of the slave’s arm above his head, and the curves\nof the head of the child, following the little skull within, thin and\nfine as some sea-shell worn by the wind.",
        "Take again another head, still more full of sentiment, but of a\ndifferent kind, a little drawing in red chalk which every one will\nremember who has examined at all carefully the drawings by old\nmasters at the Louvre.  It is a face of doubtful sex, set in the\nshadow of its own hair, the cheek-line in high light against it,\nwith something voluptuous and full in the eye-lids and the lips.\nAnother drawing might pass for the same face in childhood, with\nparched and feverish lips, but much sweetness in the loose, short-\nwaisted childish dress, with necklace and bulla, and in the\ndaintily bound hair.  We might take the thread of suggestion\nwhich these two drawings offer, when thus set side by side, and,\nfollowing it through the drawings at Florence, Venice, and Milan,\nconstruct a sort of series, illustrating better than anything else\nLeonardo’s type of womanly beauty.  Daughters of Herodias,\nwith their fantastic head-dresses knotted and folded so strangely\nto leave the [116] dainty oval of the face disengaged, they are not\nof the Christian family, or of Raphael’s.  They are the\nclairvoyants, through whom, as through delicate instruments, one\nbecomes aware of the subtler forces of nature, and the modes of\ntheir action, all that is magnetic in it, all those finer conditions\nwherein material things rise to that subtlety of operation which\nconstitutes them spiritual, where only the final nerve and the\nkeener touch can follow.  It is as if in certain significant examples\nwe actually saw those forces at their work on human flesh.\nNervous, electric, faint always with some inexplicable faintness,\nthese people seem to be subject to exceptional conditions, to feel\npowers at work in the common air unfelt by others, to become, as\nit were, the receptacle of them, and pass them on to us in a chain\nof secret influences.",
        "But among the more youthful heads there is one at Florence\nwhich Love chooses for its own–the head of a young man, which\nmay well be the likeness of Andrea Salaino, beloved of Leonardo\nfor his curled and waving hair–belli capelli ricci e inanellati–\nand afterwards his favourite pupil and servant.  Of all the\ninterests in living men and women which may have filled his life\nat Milan, this attachment alone is recorded.  And in return\nSalaino identified himself so entirely with Leonardo, that the\npicture of Saint Anne, in the Louvre, has been attributed to him.\nIt illustrates Leonardo’s usual choice of pupils, men [117] of\nsome natural charm of person or intercourse like Salaino, or men\nof birth and princely habits of life like Francesco Melzi–men\nwith just enough genius to be capable of initiation into his secret,\nfor the sake of which they were ready to efface their own\nindividuality.  Among them, retiring often to the villa of the\nMelzi at Canonica al Vaprio, he worked at his fugitive\nmanuscripts and sketches, working for the present hour, and for a\nfew only, perhaps chiefly for himself.  Other artists have been as\ncareless of present or future applause, in self-forgetfulness, or\nbecause they set moral or political ends above the ends of art; but\nin him this solitary culture of beauty seems to have hung upon a\nkind of self-love, and a carelessness in the work of art of all but\nart itself.  Out of the secret places of a unique temperament he\nbrought strange blossoms and fruits hitherto unknown; and for\nhim, the novel impression conveyed, the exquisite effect woven,\ncounted as an end in itself–a perfect end.",
        "And these pupils of his acquired his manner so thoroughly, that\nthough the number of Leonardo’s authentic works is very small\nindeed, there is a multitude of other men’s pictures through\nwhich we undoubtedly see him, and come very near to his genius.\nSometimes, as in the little picture of the Madonna of the\nBalances, in which, from the bosom of His mother, Christ weighs\nthe pebbles of the brook against the sins of men, we have a hand,\nrough enough by [118] contrast, working upon some fine hint or\nsketch of his.  Sometimes, as in the subjects of the Daughter of\nHerodias and the Head of John the Baptist, the lost originals have\nbeen re-echoed and varied upon again and again by Luini and\nothers.  At other times the original remains, but has been a mere\ntheme or motive, a type of which the accessories might be\nmodified or changed; and these variations have but brought out\nthe more the purpose, or expression of the original.  It is so with\nthe so-called Saint John the Baptist of the Louvre–one of the few\nnaked figures Leonardo painted–whose delicate brown flesh and\nwoman’s hair no one would go out into the wilderness to seek,\nand whose treacherous smile would have us understand\nsomething far beyond the outward gesture or circumstance.  But\nthe long, reedlike cross in the hand, which suggests Saint John\nthe Baptist, becomes faint in a copy at the Ambrosian Library,\nand disappears altogether in another version, in the Palazzo\nRosso at Genoa.  Returning from the latter to the original, we are\nno longer surprised by Saint John’s strange likeness to the\nBacchus which hangs near it, and which set Theophile Gautier\nthinking of Heine’s notion of decayed gods, who, to maintain\nthemselves, after the fall of paganism, took employment in the\nnew religion.  We recognise one of those symbolical inventions\nin which the ostensible subject is used, not as matter for definite\npictorial realisation, but as the starting-point of a [119] train of\nsentiment, subtle and vague as a piece of music.  No one ever\nruled over the mere subject in hand more entirely than Leonardo,\nor bent it more dexterously to purely artistic ends.  And so it\ncomes to pass that though he handles sacred subjects continually,\nhe is the most profane of painters; the given person or subject,\nSaint John in the Desert, or the Virgin on the knees of Saint\nAnne, is often merely the pretext for a kind of work which carries\none altogether beyond the range of its conventional associations.",
        "About the Last Supper, its decay and restorations, a whole\nliterature has risen up, Goethe’s pensive sketch of its sad fortunes\nbeing perhaps the best.  The death in childbirth of the Duchess\nBeatrice was followed in Ludovico by one of those paroxysms of\nreligious feeling which in him were constitutional.  The low,\ngloomy Dominican church of Saint Mary of the Graces had been\nthe favourite oratory of Beatrice.  She had spent her last days\nthere, full of sinister presentiments; at last it had been almost\nnecessary to remove her from it by force; and now it was here\nthat mass was said a hundred times a day for her repose.  On the\ndamp wall of the refectory, oozing with mineral salts, Leonardo\npainted the Last Supper.  Effective anecdotes were told about it,\nhis retouchings and delays.  They show him refusing to work\nexcept at the moment of invention, scornful of any one who\nsupposed that art could be a work of mere industry and rule,\n[120] often coming the whole length of Milan to give a single\ntouch.  He painted it, not in fresco, where all must be impromptu,\nbut in oils, the new method which he had been one of the first to\nwelcome, because it allowed of so many after-thoughts, so\nrefined a working out of perfection.  It turned out that on a\nplastered wall no process could have been less durable.  Within\nfifty years it had fallen into decay.  And now we have to turn\nback to Leonardo’s own studies, above all to one drawing of the\ncentral head at the Brera, which, in a union of tenderness and\nseverity in the face-lines, reminds one of the monumental work\nof Mino da Fiesole, to trace it as it was.",
        "Here was another effort to lift a given subject out of the range of\nits traditional associations.  Strange, after all the mystic\ndevelopments of the middle age, was the effort to see the\nEucharist, not as the pale Host of the altar, but as one taking\nleave of his friends.  Five years afterwards the young Raphael, at\nFlorence, painted it with sweet and solemn effect in the refectory\nof Saint Onofrio; but still with all the mystical unreality of the\nschool of Perugino.  Vasari pretends that the central head was\nnever finished.  But finished or unfinished, or owing part of its\neffect to a mellowing decay, the head of Jesus does but\nconsummate the sentiment of the whole company–ghosts\nthrough which you see the wall, faint as the shadows of the [121]\nleaves upon the wall on autumn afternoons.  This figure is but the\nfaintest, the most spectral of them all.",
        "The Last Supper was finished in 1497; in 1498 the French\nentered Milan, and whether or not the Gascon bowmen used it as\na mark for their arrows, the model of Francesco Sforza certainly\ndid not survive.  What, in that age, such work was capable of\nbeing–of what nobility, amid what racy truthfulness to fact–we\nmay judge from the bronze statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni on\nhorseback, modelled by Leonardo’s master, Verrocchio (he died\nof grief, it was said, because, the mould accidentally failing, he\nwas unable to complete it), still standing in the piazza of Saint\nJohn and Saint Paul at Venice.  Some traces of the thing may\nremain in certain of Leonardo’s drawings, and perhaps also, by a\nsingular circumstance, in a far-off town of France.  For Ludovico\nbecame a prisoner, and ended his days at Loches in Touraine.\nAfter many years of captivity in the dungeons below, where all\nseems sick with barbarous feudal memories, he was allowed at\nlast, it is said, to breathe fresher air for awhile in one of the rooms\nof the great tower still shown, its walls covered with strange\npainted arabesques, ascribed by tradition to his hand, amused a\nlittle, in this way, through the tedious years.  In those vast\nhelmets and human faces and pieces of armour, among which, in\ngreat letters, the [122] motto Infelix Sum is woven in and out, it is\nperhaps not too fanciful to see the fruit of a wistful after-\ndreaming over Leonardo’s sundry experiments on the armed\nfigure of the great duke, which had occupied the two so much\nduring the days of their good fortune at Milan.",
        "The remaining years of Leonardo’s life are more or less years of\nwandering.  From his brilliant life at court he had saved nothing,\nand he returned to Florence a poor man.  Perhaps necessity kept\nhis spirit excited: the next four years are one prolonged rapture or\necstasy of invention.  He painted now the pictures of the Louvre,\nhis most authentic works, which came there straight from the\ncabinet of Francis the First, at Fontainebleau.  One picture of his,\nthe Saint Anne–not the Saint Anne of the Louvre, but a simple\ncartoon, now in London–revived for a moment a sort of\nappreciation more common in an earlier time, when good pictures\nhad still seemed miraculous.  For two days a crowd of people of\nall qualities passed in naive excitement through the chamber\nwhere it hung, and gave Leonardo a taste of the “triumph” of\nCimabue.  But his work was less with the saints than with the\nliving women of Florence.  For he lived still in the polished\nsociety that he loved, and in the houses of Florence, left perhaps a\nlittle subject to light thoughts by the death of Savonarola–the\nlatest gossip (1869) is of an [123] undraped Monna Lisa, found in\nsome out-of-the-way corner of the late Orleans collection–he\nsaw Ginevra di Benci, and Lisa, the young third wife of\nFrancesco del Giocondo.  As we have seen him using incidents of\nsacred story, not for their own sake, or as mere subjects for\npictorial realisation, but as a cryptic language for fancies all his\nown, so now he found a vent for his thought in taking one of\nthese languid women, and raising her, as Leda or Pomona, as\nModesty or Vanity, to the seventh heaven of symbolical\nexpression.",
        "La Gioconda is, in the truest sense, Leonardo’s masterpiece, the\nrevealing instance of his mode of thought and work.  In\nsuggestiveness, only the Melancholia of Durer is comparable to\nit; and no crude symbolism disturbs the effect of its subdued and\ngraceful mystery.  We all know the face and hands of the figure,\nset in its marble chair, in that circle of fantastic rocks, as in some\nfaint light under sea.  Perhaps of all ancient pictures time has\nchilled it least.*  As often happens with works in which invention\nseems to reach its limit, there is an element in it given to, not\ninvented by, the master.  In that inestimable folio of drawings,\nonce in the possession of Vasari, were certain designs by\nVerrocchio, faces of such impressive beauty that Leonardo in his\nboyhood copied them [124] many times.  It is hard not to connect\nwith these designs of the elder, by-past master, as with its\ngerminal principle, the unfathomable smile, always with a touch\nof something sinister in it, which plays over all Leonardo’s work.\nBesides, the picture is a portrait.  From childhood we see this\nimage defining itself on the fabric of his dreams; and but for\nexpress historical testimony, we might fancy that this was but his\nideal lady, embodied and beheld at last.  What was the\nrelationship of a living Florentine to this creature of his thought?\nBy what strange affinities had the dream and the person grown up\nthus apart, and yet so closely together?  Present from the first\nincorporeally in Leonardo’s brain, dimly traced in the designs of\nVerrocchio, she is found present at last in Il Giocondo’s house.\nThat there is much of mere portraiture in the picture is attested by\nthe legend that by artificial means, the presence of mimes and\nflute-players, that subtle expression was protracted on the face.\nAgain, was it in four years and by renewed labour never really\ncompleted, or in four months and as by stroke of magic, that the\nimage was projected?",
        "The presence that rose thus so strangely beside the waters, is\nexpressive of what in the ways of a thousand years men had come\nto desire.  Hers is the head upon which all “the ends of the world\nare come,” and the eyelids are a little [125] weary.  It is a beauty\nwrought out from within upon the flesh, the deposit, little cell by\ncell, of strange thoughts and fantastic reveries and exquisite\npassions.  Set it for a moment beside one of those white Greek\ngoddesses or beautiful women of antiquity, and how would they\nbe troubled by this beauty, into which the soul with all its\nmaladies has passed!  All the thoughts and experience of the\nworld have etched and moulded there, in that which they have of\npower to refine and make expressive the outward form, the\nanimalism of Greece, the lust of Rome, the mysticism of the\nmiddle age with its spiritual ambition and imaginative loves, the\nreturn of the Pagan world, the sins of the Borgias.  She is older\nthan the rocks among which she sits; like the vampire, she has\nbeen dead many times, and learned the secrets of the grave; and\nhas been a diver in deep seas, and keeps their fallen day about\nher; and trafficked for strange webs with Eastern merchants;\nand, as Leda, was the mother of Helen of Troy, and, as Saint\nAnne, the mother of Mary; and all this has been to her but as the\nsound of lyres and flutes, and lives only in the delicacy with\nwhich it has moulded the changing lineaments, and tinged the\neyelids and the hands.  The fancy of a perpetual life, sweeping\ntogether ten thousand experiences, is an old one; and modern\nphilosophy has conceived the idea of humanity as wrought upon\nby, and summing up in itself, all modes of thought and life.\nCertainly [126] Lady Lisa might stand as the embodiment of the\nold fancy, the symbol of the modern idea.",
        "During these years at Florence Leonardo’s history is the history\nof his art; for himself, he is lost in the bright cloud of it.  The\noutward history begins again in 1502, with a wild journey\nthrough central Italy, which he makes as the chief engineer of\nCaesar Borgia.  The biographer, putting together the stray jottings\nof his manuscripts, may follow him through every day of it, up\nthe strange tower of Siena, elastic like a bent bow, down to the\nseashore at Piombino, each place appearing as fitfully as in a\nfever dream.",
        "One other great work was left for him to do, a work all trace of\nwhich soon vanished, The Battle of the Standard, in which he had\nMichelangelo for his rival.  The citizens of Florence, desiring to\ndecorate the walls of the great council-chamber, had offered the\nwork for competition, and any subject might be chosen from the\nFlorentine wars of the fifteenth century.  Michelangelo chose for\nhis cartoon an incident of the war with Pisa, in which the\nFlorentine soldiers, bathing in the Arno, are surprised by the\nsound of trumpets, and run to arms.  His design has reached us\nonly in an old engraving, which helps us less perhaps than our\nremembrance of the background of his Holy Family in the Uffizii\nto imagine in what superhuman form, [127] such as might have\nbeguiled the heart of an earlier world, those figures ascended out\nof the water.  Leonardo chose an incident from the battle of\nAnghiari, in which two parties of soldiers fight for a standard.\nLike Michelangelo’s, his cartoon is lost, and has come to us only\nin sketches, and in a fragment of Rubens.  Through the accounts\ngiven we may discern some lust of terrible things in it, so that\neven the horses tore each other with their teeth.  And yet one\nfragment of it, in a drawing of his at Florence, is far different–a\nwaving field of lovely armour, the chased edgings running like\nlines of sunlight from side to side.  Michelangelo was twenty-\nseven years old; Leonardo more than fifty; and Raphael, then\nnineteen years of age, visiting Florence for the first time, came\nand watched them as they worked.",
        "We catch a glimpse of Leonardo again, at Rome in 1514,\nsurrounded by his mirrors and vials and furnaces, making strange\ntoys that seemed alive of wax and quicksilver.  The hesitation\nwhich had haunted him all through life, and made him like one\nunder a spell, was upon him now with double force.  No one had\never carried political indifferentism farther; it had always been\nhis philosophy to “fly before the storm\"; he is for the Sforzas, or\nagainst them, as the tide of their fortune turns.  Yet now, in the\npolitical society of Rome, he came [128] to be suspected of secret\nFrench sympathies.  It paralysed him to find himself among\nenemies; and he turned wholly to France, which had long courted\nhim.",
        "France was about to become an Italy more Italian than Italy itself.\nFrancis the First, like Lewis the Twelfth before him, was\nattracted by the finesse of Leonardo’s work; La Gioconda was\nalready in his cabinet, and he offered Leonardo the little Chateau\nde Clou, with its vineyards and meadows, in the pleasant valley\nof the Masse, just outside the walls of the town of Amboise,\nwhere, especially in the hunting season, the court then frequently\nresided.  A Monsieur Lyonard, peinteur du Roy pour Amboyse–\nso the letter of Francis the First is headed.  It opens a prospect,\none of the most interesting in the history of art, where, in a\npeculiarly blent atmosphere, Italian art dies away as a French\nexotic.",
        "Two questions remain, after much busy antiquarianism,\nconcerning Leonardo’s death–the question of the exact form of\nhis religion, and the question whether Francis the First was\npresent at the time.  They are of about equally little importance in\nthe estimate of Leonardo’s genius.  The directions in his will\nconcerning the thirty masses and the great candles for the church\nof Saint Florentin are things of course, their real purpose being\nimmediate and practical; and on no theory of religion could these\nhurried offices be of much consequence.  We forget them in\nspeculating [129] how one who had been always so desirous of\nbeauty, but desired it always in such precise and definite forms,\nas hands or flowers or hair, looked forward now into the vague\nland, and experienced the last curiosity.",

        "[130] IT is the mistake of much popular criticism to regard\npoetry, music, and painting–all the various products of art–as but\ntranslations into different languages of one and the same fixed\nquantity of imaginative thought, supplemented by certain\ntechnical qualities of colour, in painting; of sound, in music; of\nrhythmical words, in poetry.  In this way, the sensuous element in\nart, and with it almost everything in art that is essentially artistic,\nis made a matter of indifference; and a clear apprehension of the\nopposite principle–that the sensuous material of each art brings\nwith it a special phase or quality of beauty, untranslatable into the\nforms of any other, an order of impressions distinct in kind–is the\nbeginning of all true aesthetic criticism.  For, as art addresses not\npure sense, still less the pure intellect, but the “imaginative\nreason” through the senses, there are differences of kind in\naesthetic beauty, corresponding to the differences in kind of the\ngifts of sense themselves. Each art, therefore, having its own\npeculiar and untranslatable sensuous charm, has its own [131]\nspecial mode of reaching the imagination, its own special\nresponsibilities to its material.  One of the functions of aesthetic\ncriticism is to define these limitations; to estimate the degree in\nwhich a given work of art fulfils its responsibilities to its special\nmaterial; to note in a picture that true pictorial charm, which is\nneither a mere poetical thought or sentiment, on the one hand, nor\na mere result of communicable technical skill in colour or design,\non the other; to define in a poem that true poetical quality, which\nis neither descriptive nor meditative merely, but comes of an\ninventive handling of rhythmical language, the element of song in\nthe singing; to note in music the musical charm, that essential\nmusic, which presents no words, no matter of sentiment or\nthought, separable from the special form in which it is conveyed\nto us.",
        "To such a philosophy of the variations of the beautiful, Lessing’s\nanalysis of the spheres of sculpture and poetry, in the Laocoon,\nwas an important contribution.  But a true appreciation of these\nthings is possible only in the light of a whole system of such art-\ncasuistries.  Now painting is the art in the criticism of which this\ntruth most needs enforcing, for it is in popular judgments on\npictures that the false generalisation of all art into forms of poetry\nis most prevalent.  To suppose that all is mere technical\nacquirement in delineation or touch, working through [132] and\naddressing itself to the intelligence, on the one side, or a merely\npoetical, or what may be called literary interest, addressed also to\nthe pure intelligence, on the other:–this is the way of most\nspectators, and of many critics, who have never caught sight all\nthe time of that true pictorial quality which lies between, unique\npledge, as it is, of the possession of the pictorial gift, that\ninventive or creative handling of pure line and colour, which, as\nalmost always in Dutch painting, as often also in the works of\nTitian or Veronese, is quite independent of anything definitely\npoetical in the subject it accompanies.  It is the drawing–the\ndesign projected from that peculiar pictorial temperament or\nconstitution, in which, while it may possibly be ignorant of true\nanatomical proportions, all things whatever, all poetry, all ideas\nhowever abstract or obscure, float up as visible scene or image: it\nis the colouring–that weaving of light, as of just perceptible gold\nthreads, through the dress, the flesh, the atmosphere, in Titian’s\nLace-girl, that staining of the whole fabric of the thing with a\nnew, delightful physical quality.  This drawing, then–the\narabesque traced in the air by Tintoret’s flying figures, by\nTitian’s forest branches; this colouring–the magic conditions of\nlight and hue in the atmosphere of Titian’s Lace-girl, or Rubens’s\nDescent from the Cross:–these essential pictorial qualities must\nfirst of all delight the sense, delight it as [133] directly and\nsensuously as a fragment of Venetian glass; and through this\ndelight alone become the vehicle of whatever poetry or science\nmay lie beyond them in the intention of the composer.  In its\nprimary aspect, a great picture has no more definite message for\nus than an accidental play of sunlight and shadow for a few\nmoments on the wall or floor: is itself, in truth, a space of such\nfallen light, caught as the colours are in an Eastern carpet, but\nrefined upon, and dealt with more subtly and exquisitely than by\nnature itself.  And this primary and essential condition fulfilled,\nwe may trace the coming of poetry into painting, by fine\ngradations upwards; from Japanese fan-painting, for instance,\nwhere we get, first, only abstract colour; then, just a little\ninterfused sense of the poetry of flowers; then, sometimes,\nperfect flower-painting; and so, onwards, until in Titian we have,\nas his poetry in the Ariadne, so actually a touch of true childlike\nhumour in the diminutive, quaint figure with its silk gown, which\nascends the temple stairs, in his picture of the Presentation of the\nVirgin, at Venice.",
        "But although each art has thus its own specific order of\nimpressions, and an untranslatable charm, while a just\napprehension of the ultimate differences of the arts is the\nbeginning of aesthetic criticism; yet it is noticeable that, in its\nspecial mode of handling its given material, each art may be\nobserved to pass into the [134] condition of some other art, by\nwhat German critics term an Anders-streben–a partial alienation\nfrom its own limitations, through which the arts are able, not\nindeed to supply the place of each other, but reciprocally to lend\neach other new forces.",
        "Thus some of the most delightful music seems to be always\napproaching to figure, to pictorial definition.  Architecture, again,\nthough it has its own laws–laws esoteric enough, as the true\narchitect knows only too well–yet sometimes aims at fulfilling\nthe conditions of a picture, as in the Arena chapel; or of\nsculpture, as in the flawless unity of Giotto’s tower at Florence;\nand often finds a true poetry, as in those strangely twisted\nstaircases of the chateaux of the country of the Loire, as if it were\nintended that among their odd turnings the actors in a theatrical\nmode of life might pass each other unseen; there being a poetry\nalso of memory and of the mere effect of time, by which\narchitecture often profits greatly.  Thus, again, sculpture aspires\nout of the hard limitation of pure form towards colour, or its\nequivalent; poetry also, in many ways, finding guidance from the\nother arts, the analogy between a Greek tragedy and a work of\nGreek sculpture, between a sonnet and a relief, of French poetry\ngenerally with the art of engraving, being more than mere figures\nof speech; and all the arts in common aspiring towards the\nprinciple of music; music being the typical, or ideally\nconsummate [135] art, the object of the great Anders-streben of\nall art, of all that is artistic, or partakes of artistic qualities.",
        "All art constantly aspires towards the condition of music.  For\nwhile in all other kinds of art it is possible to distinguish the\nmatter from the form, and the understanding can always make\nthis distinction, yet it is the constant effort of art to obliterate it.\nThat the mere matter of a poem, for instance, its subject, namely,\nits given incidents or situation–that the mere matter of a picture,\nthe actual circumstances of an event, the actual topography of a\nlandscape–should be nothing without the form, the spirit, of the\nhandling, that this form, this mode of handling, should become an\nend in itself, should penetrate every part of the matter: this is\nwhat all art constantly strives after, and achieves in different\ndegrees.",
        "This abstract language becomes clear enough, if we think of\nactual examples.  In an actual landscape we see a long white\nroad, lost suddenly on the hill-verge.  That is the matter of one of\nthe etchings of M. Alphonse Legros: only, in this etching, it is\ninformed by an indwelling solemnity of expression, seen upon it\nor half-seen, within the limits of an exceptional moment, or\ncaught from his own mood perhaps, but which he maintains as\nthe very essence of the thing, throughout his work.  Sometimes a\nmomentary tint of stormy light may invest a homely or too\nfamiliar scene with a character which might well have been [136]\ndrawn from the deep places of the imagination.",
        "Then we might say that this particular effect of light, this sudden\ninweaving of gold thread through the texture of the haystack, and\nthe poplars, and the grass, gives the scene artistic qualities, that it\nis like a picture.  And such tricks of circumstance are commonest\nin landscape which has little salient character of its own; because,\nin such scenery, all the material details are so easily absorbed by\nthat informing expression of passing light, and elevated,\nthroughout their whole extent, to a new and delightful effect by\nit.  And hence the superiority, for most conditions of the\npicturesque, of a river-side in France to a Swiss valley, because,\non the French river-side, mere topography, the simple material,\ncounts for so little, and, all being very pure, untouched, and\ntranquil in itself, mere light and shade have such easy work in\nmodulating it to one dominant tone.  The Venetian landscape, on\nthe other hand, has in its material conditions much which is hard,\nor harshly definite; but the masters of the Venetian school have\nshown themselves little burdened by them.  Of its Alpine\nbackground they retain certain abstracted elements only, of cool\ncolour and tranquillising line; and they use its actual details, the\nbrown windy turrets, the straw-coloured fields, the forest\narabesques, but as the notes of a music which duly accompanies\nthe presence of their men and women, presenting us with the\n[137] spirit or essence only of a certain sort of landscape–a\ncountry of the pure reason or half-imaginative memory.",
        "Poetry, again, works with words addressed in the first instance to\nthe pure intelligence; and it deals, most often, with a definite\nsubject or situation.  Sometimes it may find a noble and quite\nlegitimate function in the conveyance of moral or political\naspiration, as often in the poetry of Victor Hugo.  In such\ninstances it is easy enough for the understanding to distinguish\nbetween the matter and the form, however much the matter, the\nsubject, the element which is addressed to the mere intelligence,\nhas been penetrated by the informing, artistic spirit.  But the ideal\ntypes of poetry are those in which this distinction is reduced to its\nminimum; so that lyrical poetry, precisely because in it we are\nleast able to detach the matter from the form, without a deduction\nof something from that matter itself, is, at least artistically, the\nhighest and most complete form of poetry.  And the very\nperfection of such poetry often appears to depend, in part, on a\ncertain suppression or vagueness of mere subject, so that the\nmeaning reaches us through ways not distinctly traceable by the\nunderstanding, as in some of the most imaginative compositions\nof William Blake, and often in Shakespeare’s songs, as pre-\neminently in that song of Mariana’s page in Measure for\nMeasure, in which the kindling force and poetry of the whole\n[138] play seems to pass for a moment into an actual strain of\nmusic.",
        "And this principle holds good of all things that partake in any\ndegree of artistic qualities, of the furniture of our houses, and of\ndress, for instance, of life itself, of gesture and speech, and the\ndetails of daily intercourse; these also, for the wise, being\nsusceptible of a suavity and charm, caught from the way in which\nthey are done, which gives them a worth in themselves.  Herein,\nagain, lies what is valuable and justly attractive, in what is called\nthe fashion of a time, which elevates the trivialities of speech,\nand manner, and dress, into “ends in themselves,” and gives them\na mysterious grace and attractiveness in the doing of them.",
        "Art, then, is thus always striving to be independent of the mere\nintelligence, to become a matter of pure perception, to get rid of\nits responsibilities to its subject or material; the ideal examples of\npoetry and painting being those in which the constituent elements\nof the composition are so welded together, that the material or\nsubject no longer strikes the intellect only; nor the form, the eye\nor the ear only; but form and matter, in their union or identity,\npresent one single effect to the “imaginative reason,” that\ncomplex faculty for which every thought and feeling is twin-born\nwith its sensible analogue or symbol.",
        "It is the art of music which most completely [139] realises this\nartistic ideal, this perfect identification of matter and form.  In its\nconsummate moments, the end is not distinct from the means, the\nform from the matter, the subject from the expression; they\ninhere in and completely saturate each other; and to it, therefore,\nto the condition of its perfect moments, all the arts may be\nsupposed constantly to tend and aspire.  In music, then, rather\nthan in poetry, is to be found the true type or measure of\nperfected art.  Therefore, although each art has its\nincommunicable element, its untranslatable order of impressions,\nits unique mode of reaching the “imaginative reason,” yet the arts\nmay be represented as continually struggling after the law or\nprinciple of music, to a condition which music alone completely\nrealises; and one of the chief functions of aesthetic criticism,\ndealing with the products of art, new or old, is to estimate the\ndegree in which each of those products approaches, in this sense,\nto musical law.",
        "By no school of painters have the necessary limitations of the art\nof painting been so unerringly though instinctively apprehended,\nand the essence of what is pictorial in a picture so justly\nconceived, as by the school of Venice; and the train of thought\nsuggested in what has been now said is, perhaps, a not unfitting\nintroduction to a few pages about Giorgione, who, though much\nhas been taken by recent criticism from [140] what was reputed\nto be his work, yet, more entirely than any other painter, sums up,\nin what we know of himself and his art, the spirit of the Venetian\nschool.",
        "The beginnings of Venetian painting link themselves to the last,\nstiff, half-barbaric splendours of Byzantine decoration, and are\nbut the introduction into the crust of marble and gold on the walls\nof the Duomo of Murano, or of Saint Mark’s, of a little more of\nhuman expression.  And throughout the course of its later\ndevelopment, always subordinate to architectural effect, the work\nof the Venetian school never escaped from the influence of its\nbeginnings.  Unassisted, and therefore unperplexed, by\nnaturalism, religious mysticism, philosophical theories, it had no\nGiotto, no Angelico, no Botticelli.  Exempt from the stress of\nthought and sentiment, which taxed so severely the resources of\nthe generations of Florentine artists, those earlier Venetian\npainters, down to Carpaccio and the Bellini, seem never for a\nmoment to have been so much as tempted to lose sight of the\nscope of their art in its strictness, or to forget that painting must\nbe before all things decorative, a thing for the eye, a space of\ncolour on the wall, only more dexterously blent than the marking\nof its precious stone or the chance interchange of sun and shade\nupon it:–this, to begin and end with; whatever higher matter of\nthought, or poetry, or religious reverie might play its part therein,\n[141] between.  At last, with final mastery of all the technical\nsecrets of his art, and with somewhat more than “a spark of the\ndivine fire” to his share, comes Giorgione.  He is the inventor of\ngenre, of those easily movable pictures which serve neither for\nuses of devotion, nor of allegorical or historic teaching–little\ngroups of real men and women, amid congruous furniture or\nlandscape–morsels of actual life, conversation or music or play,\nbut refined upon or idealised, till they come to seem like glimpses\nof life from afar.  Those spaces of more cunningly blent colour,\nobediently filling their places, hitherto, in a mere architectural\nscheme, Giorgione detaches from the wall.  He frames them by\nthe hands of some skilful carver, so that people may move them\nreadily and take with them where they go, as one might a poem in\nmanuscript, or a musical instrument, to be used, at will, as a\nmeans of self-education, stimulus or solace, coming like an\nanimated presence, into one’s cabinet, to enrich the air as with\nsome choice aroma, and, like persons, live with us, for a day or a\nlifetime.  Of all art such as this, art which has played so large a\npart in men’s culture since that time, Giorgione is the initiator.\nYet in him too that old Venetian clearness or justice, in the\napprehension of the essential limitations of the pictorial art, is\nstill undisturbed.  While he interfuses his painted work with a\nhigh-strung sort of poetry, caught directly from a singularly rich\nand high-strung [142] sort of life, yet in his selection of subject,\nor phase of subject, in the subordination of mere subject to\npictorial design, to the main purpose of a picture, he is typical of\nthat aspiration of all the arts towards music, which I have\nendeavoured to explain,–towards the perfect identification of\nmatter and form.",
        "Born so near to Titian, though a little before him, that these two\ncompanion pupils of the aged Giovanni Bellini may almost be\ncalled contemporaries, Giorgione stands to Titian in something\nlike the relationship of Sordello to Dante, in Browning’s poem.\nTitian, when he leaves Bellini, becomes, in turn, the pupil of\nGiorgione.  He lives in constant labour more than sixty years\nafter Giorgione is in his grave; and with such fruit, that hardly\none of the greater towns of Europe is without some fragment of\nhis work.  But the slightly older man, with his so limited actual\nproduct (what remains to us of it seeming, when narrowly\nexplained, to reduce itself to almost one picture, like Sordello’s\none fragment of lovely verse), yet expresses, in elementary\nmotive and principle, that spirit–itself the final acquisition of all\nthe long endeavours of Venetian art–which Titian spreads over\nhis whole life’s activity.",
        "And, as we might expect, something fabulous and illusive has\nalways mingled itself in the brilliancy of Giorgione’s fame.  The\nexact relationship to him of many works–drawings, [143]\nportraits, painted idylls–often fascinating enough, which in\nvarious collections went by his name, was from the first\nuncertain.  Still, six or eight famous pictures at Dresden, Florence\nand the Louvre, were with no doubt attributed to him, and in\nthese, if anywhere, something of the splendour of the old\nVenetian humanity seemed to have been preserved.  But of those\nsix or eight famous pictures it is now known that only one is\ncertainly from Giorgione’s hand.  The accomplished science of\nthe subject has come at last, and, as in other instances, has not\nmade the past more real for us, but assured us only that we\npossess less of it than we seemed to possess.  Much of the work\non which Giorgione’s immediate fame depended, work done for\ninstantaneous effect, in all probability passed away almost within\nhis own age, like the frescoes on the facade of the fondaco dei\nTedeschi at Venice, some crimson traces of which, however, still\ngive a strange additional touch of splendour to the scene of the\nRialto.  And then there is a barrier or borderland, a period about\nthe middle of the sixteenth century, in passing through which the\ntradition miscarries, and the true outlines of Giorgione’s work\nand person are obscured.  It became fashionable for wealthy\nlovers of art, with no critical standard of authenticity, to collect\nso-called works of Giorgione, and a multitude of imitations came\ninto circulation.  And now, in the “new [144] Vasari,\"* the great\ntraditional reputation, woven with so profuse demand on men’s\nadmiration, has been scrutinised thread by thread; and what\nremains of the most vivid and stimulating of Venetian masters, a\nlive flame, as it seemed, in those old shadowy times, has been\nreduced almost to a name by his most recent critics.",
        "Yet enough remains to explain why the legend grew up above the\nname, why the name attached itself, in many instances, to the\nbravest work of other men.  The Concert in the Pitti Palace, in\nwhich a monk, with cowl and tonsure, touches the keys of a\nharpsichord, while a clerk, placed behind him, grasps the handle\nof the viol, and a third, with cap and plume, seems to wait upon\nthe true interval for beginning to sing, is undoubtedly\nGiorgione’s.  The outline of the lifted finger, the trace of the\nplume, the very threads of the fine linen, which fasten themselves\non the memory, in the moment before they are lost altogether in\nthat calm unearthly glow, the skill which has caught the waves of\nwandering sound, and fixed them for ever on the lips and hands–\nthese are indeed the master’s own; and the criticism which, while\ndismissing so much hitherto believed to be Giorgione’s, has\nestablished the claims of this one picture, has left it among the\nmost precious things in the world of art.",
        "It is noticeable that the “distinction” of this [145] Concert, its\nsustained evenness of perfection, alike in design, in execution,\nand in choice of personal type, becomes for the “new Vasari” the\nstandard of Giorgione’s genuine work.  Finding here sufficient to\nexplain his influence, and the true seal of mastery, its authors\nassign to Pellegrino da San Daniele the Holy Family in the\nLouvre, in consideration of certain points where it comes short of\nthis standard.  Such shortcoming, however, will hardly diminish\nthe spectator’s enjoyment of a singular charm of liquid air, with\nwhich the whole picture seems instinct, filling the eyes and lips,\nthe very garments, of its sacred personages, with some wind-\nsearched brightness and energy; of which fine air the blue peak,\nclearly defined in the distance, is, as it were, the visible pledge.\nSimilarly, another favourite picture in the Louvre, the subject of a\ndelightful sonnet by a poet* whose own painted work often comes\nto mind as one ponders over these precious things–the Fete\nChampetre, is assigned to an imitator of Sebastian del Piombo;\nand the Tempest, in the Academy at Venice, to Paris Bordone, or\nperhaps to “some advanced craftsman of the sixteenth century.\"\nFrom the gallery at Dresden, the Knight embracing a Lady, where\nthe knight’s broken gauntlets seem to mark some well-known\npause in a story we would willingly hear the rest of, is conceded\nto “a Brescian hand,” and Jacob meeting Rachel to [146] a pupil\nof Palma.  And then, whatever their charm, we are called on to\ngive up the Ordeal, and the Finding of Moses with its jewel-like\npools of water, perhaps to Bellini.",
        "Nor has the criticism, which thus so freely diminishes the number\nof his authentic works, added anything important to the well-\nknown outline of the life and personality of the man: only, it has\nfixed one or two dates, one or two circumstances, a little more\nexactly.  Giorgione was born before the year 1477, and spent his\nchildhood at Castelfranco, where the last crags of the Venetian\nAlps break down romantically, with something of parklike grace,\nto the plain.  A natural child of the family of the Barbarelli by a\npeasant-girl of Vedelago, he finds his way early into the circle of\nnotable persons–people of courtesy.  He is initiated into those\ndifferences of personal type, manner, and even of dress, which\nare best understood there–that “distinction” of the Concert of the\nPitti Palace.  Not far from his home lives Catherine of Cornara,\nformerly Queen of Cyprus; and, up in the towers which still\nremain, Tuzio Costanzo, the famous condottiere–a picturesque\nremnant of medieval manners, amid a civilisation rapidly\nchanging.  Giorgione paints their portraits; and when Tuzio’s son,\nMatteo, dies in early youth, adorns in his memory a chapel in the\nchurch of Castelfranco, painting on this occasion, perhaps, the\naltar-piece, foremost among his authentic [147] works, still to be\nseen there, with the figure of the warrior-saint, Liberale, of which\nthe original little study in oil, with the delicately gleaming, silver-\ngrey armour, is one of the greater treasures of the National\nGallery.  In that figure, as in some other knightly personages\nattributed to him, people have supposed the likeness of the\npainter’s own presumably gracious presence.  Thither, at last, he\nis himself brought home from Venice, early dead, but celebrated.\nIt happened, about his thirty-fourth year, that in one of those\nparties at which he entertained his friends with music, he met a\ncertain lady of whom he became greatly enamoured, and “they\nrejoiced greatly,” says Vasari, “the one and the other, in their\nloves.”  And two quite different legends concerning it agree in\nthis, that it was through this lady he came by his death; Ridolfi\nrelating that, being robbed of her by one of his pupils, he died of\ngrief at the double treason; Vasari, that she being secretly\nstricken of the plague, and he making his visits to her as usual,\nGiorgione took the sickness from her mortally, along with her\nkisses, and so briefly departed.",
        "But, although the number of Giorgione’s extant works has been\nthus limited by recent criticism, all is not done when the real and\nthe traditional elements in what concerns him have been\ndiscriminated; for, in what is connected with a great name, much\nthat is not real is often very stimulating.  For the aesthetic\nphilosopher, [148] therefore, over and above the real Giorgione\nand his authentic extant works, there remains the Giorgionesque\nalso–an influence, a spirit or type in art, active in men so\ndifferent as those to whom many of his supposed works are really\nassignable.  A veritable school, in fact, grew together out of all\nthose fascinating works rightly or wrongly attributed to him; out\nof many copies from, or variations on him, by unknown or\nuncertain workmen, whose drawings and designs were, for\nvarious reasons, prized as his; out of the immediate impression he\nmade upon his contemporaries, and with which he continued in\nmen’s minds; out of many traditions of subject and treatment,\nwhich really descend from him to our own time, and by retracing\nwhich we fill out the original image.  Giorgione thus becomes a\nsort of impersonation of Venice itself, its projected reflex or\nideal, all that was intense or desirable in it crystallising about the\nmemory of this wonderful young man.",
        "And now, finally, let me illustrate some of the characteristics of\nthis School of Giorgione, as we may call it, which, for most of us,\nnotwithstanding all that negative criticism of the “new Vasari,\"\nwill still identify itself with those famous pictures at Florence, at\nDresden and Paris.  A certain artistic ideal is there defined for us-\n-the conception of a peculiar aim and procedure in art, which we\nmay understand as the Giorgionesque, [149] wherever we find it,\nwhether in Venetian work generally, or in work of our own time.\nOf this the Concert, that undoubted work of Giorgione in the Pitti\nPalace, is the typical instance, and a pledge authenticating the\nconnexion of the school, and the spirit of the school, with the\nmaster.",
        "I have spoken of a certain interpenetration of the matter or\nsubject of a work of art with the form of it, a condition realised\nabsolutely only in music, as the condition to which every form of\nart is perpetually aspiring.  In the art of painting, the attainment\nof this ideal condition, this perfect interpenetration of the subject\nwith the elements of colour and design, depends, of course, in\ngreat measure, on dexterous choice of that subject, or phase of\nsubject; and such choice is one of the secrets of Giorgione’s\nschool.  It is the school of genre, and employs itself mainly with\n\"painted idylls,” but, in the production of this pictorial poetry,\nexercises a wonderful tact in the selecting of such matter as lends\nitself most readily and entirely to pictorial form, to complete\nexpression by drawing and colour.  For although its productions\nare painted poems, they belong to a sort of poetry which tells\nitself without an articulated story.  The master is pre-eminent for\nthe resolution, the ease and quickness, with which he reproduces\ninstantaneous motion–the lacing-on of armour, with the head\nbent back so stately–the fainting lady–the embrace, rapid as the\nkiss, caught with death itself from dying [150] lips–some\nmomentary conjunction of mirrors and polished armour and still\nwater, by which all the sides of a solid image are exhibited at\nonce, solving that casuistical question whether painting can\npresent an object as completely as sculpture.  The sudden act, the\nrapid transition of thought, the passing expression–this he arrests\nwith that vivacity which Vasari has attributed to him, il fuoco\nGiorgionesco, as he terms it.  Now it is part of the ideality of the\nhighest sort of dramatic poetry, that it presents us with a kind of\nprofoundly significant and animated instants, a mere gesture, a\nlook, a smile, perhaps–some brief and wholly concrete moment–\ninto which, however, all the motives, all the interests and effects\nof a long history, have condensed themselves, and which seem to\nabsorb past and future in an intense consciousness of the present.\nSuch ideal instants the school of Giorgione selects, with its\nadmirable tact, from that feverish, tumultuously coloured world\nof the old citizens of Venice–exquisite pauses in time, in which,\narrested thus, we seem to be spectators of all the fulness of\nexistence, and which are like some consummate extract or\nquintessence of life.",
        "It is to the law or condition of music, as I said, that all art like this\nis really aspiring; and, in the school of Giorgione, the perfect\nmoments of music itself, the making or hearing of music, song or\nits accompaniment, are themselves prominent as subjects.  On\nthat background [151] of the silence of Venice, so impressive to\nthe modern visitor, the world of Italian music was then forming.\nIn choice of subject, as in all besides, the Concert of the Pitti\nPalace is typical of everything that Giorgione, himself an\nadmirable musician, touched with his influence.  In sketch or\nfinished picture, in various collections, we may follow it through\nmany intricate variations–men fainting at music; music at the\npool-side while people fish, or mingled with the sound of the\npitcher in the well, or heard across running water, or among the\nflocks; the tuning of instruments; people with intent faces, as if\nlistening, like those described by Plato in an ingenious passage of\nthe Republic, to detect the smallest interval of musical sound, the\nsmallest undulation in the air, or feeling for music in thought on a\nstringless instrument, ear and finger refining themselves\ninfinitely, in the appetite for sweet sound; a momentary touch of\nan instrument in the twilight, as one passes through some\nunfamiliar room, in a chance company.",
        "In these then, the favourite incidents of Giorgione’s school,\nmusic or the musical intervals in our existence, life itself is\nconceived as a sort of listening–listening to music, to the reading\nof Bandello’s novels, to the sound of water, to time as it flies.\nOften such moments are really our moments of play, and we are\nsurprised at the unexpected blessedness of what may seem our\n[152] least important part of time; not merely because play is in\nmany instances that to which people really apply their own best\npowers, but also because at such times, the stress of our servile,\neveryday attentiveness being relaxed, the happier powers in\nthings without are permitted free passage, and have their way\nwith us.  And so, from music, the school of Giorgione passes\noften to the play which is like music; to those masques in which\nmen avowedly do but play at real life, like children “dressing\nup,” disguised in the strange old Italian dresses, parti-coloured, or\nfantastic with embroidery and furs, of which the master was so\ncurious a designer, and which, above all the spotless white linen\nat wrist and throat, he painted so dexterously.",
        "But when people are happy in this thirsty land water will not be\nfar off; and in the school of Giorgione, the presence of water–the\nwell, or marble-rimmed pool, the drawing or pouring of water, as\nthe woman pours it from a pitcher with her jewelled hand in the\nFete Champetre, listening, perhaps, to the cool sound as it falls,\nblent with the music of the pipes–is as characteristic, and almost\nas suggestive, as that of music itself.  And the landscape feels,\nand is glad of it also–a landscape full of clearness, of the effects\nof water, of fresh rain newly passed through the air, and collected\ninto the grassy channels.  The air, moreover, in the school of\nGiorgione, seems as vivid as the people who breathe [153] it, and\nliterally empyrean, all impurities being burnt out of it, and no\ntaint, no floating particle of anything but its own proper elements\nallowed to subsist within it.",
        "Its scenery is such as in England we call “park scenery,” with\nsome elusive refinement felt about the rustic buildings, the choice\ngrass, the grouped trees, the undulations deftly economised for\ngraceful effect.  Only, in Italy all natural things are as it were\nwoven through and through with gold thread, even the cypress\nrevealing it among the folds of its blackness.  And it is with gold\ndust, or gold thread, that these Venetian painters seem to work,\nspinning its fine filaments, through the solemn human flesh,\naway into the white plastered walls of the thatched huts.  The\nharsher details of the mountains recede to a harmonious distance,\nthe one peak of rich blue above the horizon remaining but as the\nsensible warrant of that due coolness which is all we need ask\nhere of the Alps, with their dark rains and streams.  Yet what real,\nairy space, as the eye passes from level to level, through the long-\ndrawn valley in which Jacob embraces Rachel among the flocks!\nNowhere is there a truer instance of that balance, that modulated\nunison of landscape and persons–of the human image and its\naccessories–already noticed as characteristic of the Venetian\nschool, so that, in it, neither personage nor scenery is ever a mere\npretext for the other.",
        "[154] Something like this seems to me to be the vraie verite about\nGiorgione, if I may adopt a serviceable expression, by which the\nFrench recognise those more liberal and durable impressions\nwhich, in respect of any really considerable person or subject,\nanything that has at all intricately occupied men’s attention, lie\nbeyond, and must supplement, the narrower range of the strictly\nascertained facts about it.  In this, Giorgione is but an illustration\nof a valuable general caution we may abide by in all criticism.\nAs regards Giorgione himself, we have indeed to take note of all\nthose negations and exceptions, by which, at first sight, a “new\nVasari” seems merely to have confused our apprehension of a\ndelightful object, to have explained away in our inheritance from\npast time what seemed of high value there.  Yet it is not with a\nfull understanding even of those exceptions that one can leave off\njust at this point.  Properly qualified, such exceptions are but a\nsalt of genuineness in our knowledge; and beyond all those\nstrictly ascertained facts, we must take note of that indirect\ninfluence by which one like Giorgione, for instance, enlarges his\npermanent efficacy and really makes himself felt in our culture.\nIn a just impression of that, is the essential truth, the vraie verite,\nconcerning him.",

        "[155] IN the middle of the sixteenth century, when the spirit of\nthe Renaissance was everywhere, and people had begun to look\nback with distaste on the works of the middle age, the old Gothic\nmanner had still one chance more, in borrowing something from\nthe rival which was about to supplant it.  In this way there was\nproduced, chiefly in France, a new and peculiar phase of taste\nwith qualities and a charm of its own, blending the somewhat\nattenuated grace of Italian ornament with the general outlines of\nNorthern design.  It created the Chateau de Gaillon, as you may\nstill see it in the delicate engravings of Israel Silvestre–a Gothic\ndonjon veiled faintly by a surface of dainty Italian traceries–\nChenonceaux, Blois, Chambord, and the church of Brou.  In\npainting, there came from Italy workmen like Maitre Roux and\nthe masters of the school of Fontainebleau, to have their later\nItalian voluptuousness attempered by the naive and silvery\nqualities of the native style; and it was characteristic of these\npainters that they were most successful in painting on glass, an\nart so [156] essentially medieval.  Taking it up where the middle\nage had left it, they found their whole work among the last\nsubtleties of colour and line; and keeping within the true limits of\ntheir material, they got quite a new order of effects from it, and\nfelt their way to refinements on colour never dreamed of by those\nolder workmen, the glass-painters of Chartres or Le Mans.  What\nis called the Renaissance in France is thus not so much the\nintroduction of a wholly new taste ready-made from Italy, but\nrather the finest and subtlest phase of the middle age itself, its last\nfleeting splendour and temperate Saint Martin’s summer.  In\npoetry, the Gothic spirit in France had produced a thousand\nsongs; so in the Renaissance, French poetry too did but borrow\nsomething to blend with a native growth, and the poems of\nRonsard, with their ingenuity, their delicately figured surfaces,\ntheir slightness, their fanciful combinations of rhyme, are the\ncorrelative of the traceries of the house of Jacques Coeur at\nBourges, or the Maison de Justice at Rouen.",
        "There was indeed\tsomething in the native French taste naturally\nakin to that Italian finesse.  The characteristic of French work had\nalways been a certain nicety, a remarkable daintiness of hand,\nune nettete remarquable d’execution.  In the paintings of\nFrancois Clouet, for example, or rather of the Clouets–for there\nwas a whole family of them–painters remarkable for [157] their\nresistance to Italian influences, there is a silveriness of colour and\na clearness of expression which distinguish them very definitely\nfrom their Flemish neighbours, Hemling or the Van Eycks.  And\nthis nicety is not less characteristic of old French poetry.  A light,\naerial delicacy, a simple elegance–une nettete remarquable\nd’execution: these are essential characteristics alike of Villon’s\npoetry, and of the Hours of Anne of Brittany.  They are\ncharacteristic too of a hundred French Gothic carvings and\ntraceries.  Alike in the old Gothic cathedrals, and in their\ncounterpart, the old Gothic chansons de geste, the rough and\nponderous mass becomes, as if by passing for a moment into\nhappier conditions, or through a more gracious stratum of air,\ngraceful and refined, like the carved ferneries on the granite\nchurch at Folgoat, or the lines which describe the fair priestly\nhands of Archbishop Turpin, in the song of Roland; although\nbelow both alike there is a fund of mere Gothic strength, or\nheaviness.*",
        "Now Villon’s songs and Clouet’s painting are like these.  It is the\nhigher touch making itself felt here and there, betraying itself,\nlike nobler blood in a lower stock, by a fine line or gesture or\nexpression, the turn of a wrist, the tapering of a finger.  In\nRonsard’s time that rougher [158] element seemed likely to\npredominate.  No one can turn over the pages of Rabelais without\nfeeling how much need there was of softening, of castigation.  To\neffect this softening is the object of the revolution in poetry\nwhich is connected with Ronsard’s name.  Casting about for the\nmeans of thus refining upon and saving the character of French\nliterature, he accepted that influx of Renaissance taste, which,\nleaving the buildings, the language, the art, the poetry of France,\nat bottom, what they were, old French Gothic still, gilds their\nsurfaces with a strange, delightful, foreign aspect passing over all\nthat Northern land, in itself neither deeper nor more permanent\nthan a chance effect of light.  He reinforces, he doubles the\nFrench daintiness by Italian finesse.  Thereupon, nearly all the\nforce and all the seriousness of French work disappear; only the\nelegance, the aerial touch, the perfect manner remain.  But this\nelegance, this manner, this daintiness of execution are\nconsummate, and have an unmistakable aesthetic value.",
        "So the old French chanson, which, like the old northern Gothic\nornament, though it sometimes refined itself into a sort of weird\nelegance, was often, in its essence, something rude and formless,\nbecame in the hands of Ronsard a Pindaric ode.  He gave it\nstructure, a sustained system, strophe and antistrophe, and taught\nit a changefulness and variety of metre which keep the curiosity\nalways excited, so that the very aspect of it, as it [159] lies\nwritten on the page, carries the eye lightly onwards, and of which\nthis is a good instance:–",
        "That is not by Ronsard, but by Remy Belleau, for Ronsard soon\ncame to have a school.  Six other poets threw in their lot with him\nin his literary revolution,–this Remy Belleau, Antoine de Baif,\nPontus de Tyard, Etienne Jodelle, Jean Daurat, and lastly Joachim\ndu Bellay; and with that strange love of emblems which is\ncharacteristic of the time, which covered all the works of Francis\nthe First with the salamander, and all the works of Henry the\nSecond with the double crescent, and all the works of Anne of\nBrittany with the knotted cord, they called themselves the Pleiad;\nseven in all, although, as happens with the celestial Pleiad, if you\nscrutinise this constellation of poets more carefully you may find\nthere a great number of minor stars.",
        "The first note of this literary revolution was [160] struck by\nJoachim du Bellay in a little tract written at the early age of\ntwenty-four, which coming to us through three centuries seems of\nyesterday, so full is it of those delicate critical distinctions which\nare sometimes supposed peculiar to modern writers.  The piece\nhas for its title La Deffense et Illustration de la langue\nFrancoyse; and its problem is how to illustrate or ennoble the\nFrench language, to give it lustre.",
        "We are accustomed to speak of the varied critical and creative\nmovement of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries as the\nRenaissance, and because we have a single name for it we may\nsometimes fancy that there was more unity in the thing itself than\nthere really was.  Even the Reformation, that other great\nmovement of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, had far less\nunity, far less of combined action, than is at first sight supposed;\nand the Renaissance was infinitely less united, less conscious of\ncombined action, than the Reformation.  But if anywhere the\nRenaissance became conscious, as a German philosopher might\nsay, if ever it was understood as a systematic movement by those\nwho took part in it, it is in this little book of Joachim du Bellay’s,\nwhich it is impossible to read without feeling the excitement, the\nanimation, of change, of discovery.  “It is a remarkable fact,\"\nsays M. Sainte-Beuve, “and an inversion of what is true of other\nlanguages, that, in French, prose has always had the precedence\nover poetry.”  Du Bellay’s prose [161] is perfectly transparent,\nflexible, and chaste.  In many ways it is a more characteristic\nexample of the culture of the Pleiad than any of its verse; and\nthose who love the whole movement of which the Pleiad is a\npart, for a weird foreign grace in it, and may be looking about for\na true specimen of it, cannot have a better than Joachim du Bellay\nand this little treatise of his.",
        "Du Bellay’s object is to adjust the existing French culture to the\nrediscovered classical culture; and in discussing this problem,\nand developing the theories of the Pleiad, he has lighted upon\nmany principles of permanent truth and applicability.  There were\nsome who despaired of the French language altogether, who\nthought it naturally incapable of the fulness and elegance of\nGreek and Latin–cette elegance et copie qui est en la langue\nGreque et Romaine–that science could be adequately discussed,\nand poetry nobly written, only in the dead languages.  “Those\nwho speak thus,” says Du Bellay,  “make me think of the relics\nwhich one may only see through a little pane of glass, and must\nnot touch with one’s hands.  That is what these people do with all\nbranches of culture, which they keep shut up in Greek and Latin\nbooks, not permitting one to see them otherwise, or transport\nthem out of dead words into those which are alive, and wing their\nway daily through the mouths of men.”  “Languages,” he says\nagain, “are not born like plants and trees, some naturally feeble\nand sickly, [162] others healthy and strong and apter to bear the\nweight of men’s conceptions, but all their virtue is generated in\nthe world of choice and men’s freewill concerning them.\nTherefore, I cannot blame too strongly the rashness of some of\nour countrymen, who being anything rather than Greeks or\nLatins, depreciate and reject with more than stoical disdain\neverything written in French; nor can I express my surprise at the\nodd opinion of some learned men who think that our vulgar\ntongue is wholly incapable of erudition and good literature.”",
        "It was an age of translations.  Du Bellay himself translated two\nbooks of the Aeneid, and other poetry, old and new, and there\nwere some who thought that the translation of the classical\nliterature was the true means of ennobling the French language:–\nstrangers are ever favourites with us–nous favorisons toujours les\netrangers.  Du Bellay moderates their expectations.  “I do not\nbelieve that one can learn the right use of them\"–he is speaking\nof figures and ornament in language–\"from translations, because\nit is impossible to reproduce them with the same grace with\nwhich the original author used them.  For each language has I\nknow not what peculiarity of its own; and if you force yourself to\nexpress the naturalness (le naif) of this in another language,\nobserving the law of translation,–not to expatiate beyond the\nlimits of the author himself, your words will be constrained,\n[163] cold and ungraceful.”  Then he fixes the test of all good\ntranslation:–\"To prove this, read me Demosthenes and Homer in\nLatin, Cicero and Virgil in French, and see whether they produce\nin you the same affections which you experience in reading those\nauthors in the original.”",
        "In this effort to ennoble the French language, to give it grace,\nnumber, perfection, and as painters do to their pictures, that last,\nso desirable, touch–cette derniere main que nous desirons-what\nDu Bellay is really pleading for is his mother-tongue, the\nlanguage, that is, in which one will have the utmost degree of\nwhat is moving and passionate.  He recognised of what force the\nmusic and dignity of languages are, how they enter into the\ninmost part of things; and in pleading for the cultivation of the\nFrench language, he is pleading for no merely scholastic interest,\nbut for freedom, impulse, reality, not in literature only, but in\ndaily communion of speech.  After all, it was impossible to have\nthis impulse in Greek and Latin, dead languages shut up in books\nas in reliquaries–peris et mises en reliquaires de livres.  By aid\nof this starveling stock–pauvre plante et vergette–of the French\nlanguage, he must speak delicately, movingly, if he is ever to\nspeak so at all: that, or none, must be for him the medium of what\nhe calls, in one of his great phrases, le discours fatal des choses\nmondaines–that discourse about affairs which decides men’s\nfates.  And it is his patriotism [164] not to despair of it; he sees it\nalready perfect in all elegance and beauty of words–parfait en\ntoute elegance et venuste de paroles.",
        "Du Bellay was born in the disastrous year 1525, the year of the\nbattle of Pavia, and the captivity of Francis the First.  His parents\ndied early, and to him, as the younger son, his mother’s little\nestate, ce petit Lire, the beloved place of his birth, descended.  He\nwas brought up by a brother only a little older than himself; and\nleft to themselves, the two boys passed their lives in day-dreams\nof military glory.  Their education was neglected; “The time of\nmy youth,” says Du Bellay, “was lost, like the flower which no\nshower waters, and no hand cultivates.”  He was just twenty\nyears old when the elder brother died, leaving Joachim to be the\nguardian of his child.  It was with regret, with a shrinking sense\nof incapacity, that he took upon him the burden of this\nresponsibility.  Hitherto he had looked forward to the profession\nof a soldier, hereditary in his family.  But at this time a sickness\nattacked him which brought him cruel sufferings, and seemed\nlikely to be mortal.  It was then for the first time that he read the\nGreek and Latin poets.  These studies came too late to make him\nwhat he so much desired to be, a trifler in Greek and Latin verse,\nlike so many others of his time now forgotten; instead, they made\nhim a lover of his own homely native tongue, that poor starveling\nstock of the French [165] language.  It was through this fortunate\nshort-coming in his education that he became national and\nmodern; and he learned afterwards to look back on that wild\ngarden of his youth with only a half regret.  A certain Cardinal du\nBellay was the successful member of the family, a man often\nemployed in high official business.  To him the thoughts of\nJoachim turned when it became necessary to choose a profession,\nand in 1552 he accompanied the Cardinal to Rome.  He remained\nthere nearly five years, burdened with the weight of affairs, and\nlanguishing with home-sickness.  Yet it was under these\ncircumstances that his genius yielded its best fruits.  From Rome,\nso full of pleasurable sensation for men of an imaginative\ntemperament such as his, with all the curiosities of the\nRenaissance still fresh in it, his thoughts went back painfully,\nlongingly, to the country of the Loire, with its wide expanse of\nwaving corn, its homely pointed roofs of grey slate, and its far-\noff scent of the sea.  He reached home at last, but only to die\nthere, quite suddenly, one wintry day, at the early age of thirty-\nfive.",
        "Much of Du Bellay’s poetry illustrates rather the age and school\nto which he belonged than his own temper and genius.  As with\nthe writings of Ronsard and the other poets of the Pleiad, its\ninterest depends not so much on the impress of individual genius\nupon it, as on the [166] circumstance that it was once poetry a la\nmode, that it is part of the manner of a time–a time which made\nmuch of manner, and carried it to a high degree of perfection.  It\nis one of the decorations of an age which threw a large part of its\nenergy into the work of decoration.  We feel a pensive pleasure in\ngazing on these faded adornments, and observing how a group of\nactual men and women pleased themselves long ago.  Ronsard’s\npoems are a kind of epitome of his age.  Of one side of that age, it\nis true, of the strenuous, the progressive, the serious movement,\nwhich was then going on, there is little; but of the catholic side,\nthe losing side, the forlorn hope, hardly a figure is absent.  The\nQueen of Scots, at whose desire Ronsard published his odes,\nreading him in her northern prison, felt that he was bringing back\nto her the true flavour of her early days in the court of Catherine\nat the Louvre, with its exotic Italian gaieties.  Those who disliked\nthat poetry, disliked it because they found that age itself\ndistasteful.  The poetry of Malherbe came, with its sustained style\nand weighty sentiment, but with nothing that set people singing;\nand the lovers of such poetry saw in the poetry of the Pleiad only\nthe latest trumpery of the middle age.  But the time arrived when\nthe school of Malherbe also had had its day; and the\nRomanticists, who in their eagerness for excitement, for strange\nmusic and imagery, went back to the works of the middle age,\naccepted the Pleiad too [167] with the rest; and in that new\nmiddle age which their genius has evoked, the poetry of the\nPleiad has found its place.  At first, with Malherbe, you may\nthink it, like the architecture, the whole mode of life, the very\ndresses of that time, fantastic, faded, rococo.  But if you look\nlong enough to understand it, to conceive its sentiment, you will\nfind that those wanton lines have a spirit guiding their caprices.\nFor there is style there; one temper has shaped the whole; and\neverything that has style, that has been done as no other man or\nage could have done it, as it could never, for all our trying, be\ndone again, has its true value and interest.  Let us dwell upon it\nfor a moment, and try to gather from it that special flower, ce\nfleur particulier, which Ronsard himself tells us every garden\nhas.",
        "It is poetry not for the people, but for a confined circle, for\ncourtiers, great lords and erudite persons, people who desire to be\nhumoured, to gratify a certain refined voluptuousness they have\nin them.  Ronsard loves, or dreams that he loves, a rare and\npeculiar type of beauty, la petite pucelle Angevine, with golden\nhair and dark eyes.  But he has the ambition not only of being a\ncourtier and a lover, but a great scholar also; he is anxious about\northography, about the letter e Grecque, the true spelling of Latin\nnames in French writing, and the restoration of the letter i to its\nprimitive liberty–del’ i voyelle en sa premiere liberte.  His poetry\nis full of quaint, [168] remote learning.  He is just a little\npedantic, true always to his own express judgment, that to be\nnatural is not enough for one who in poetry desires to produce\nwork worthy of immortality.  And therewithal a certain number\nof Greek words, which charmed Ronsard and his circle by their\ngaiety and daintiness, and a certain air of foreign elegance about\nthem, crept into the French language; as there were other strange\nwords which the poets of the Pleiad forged for themselves, and\nwhich had only an ephemeral existence.",
        "With this was united the desire to taste a more exquisite and\nvarious music than that of the older French verse, or of the\nclassical poets.  The music of the measured, scanned verse of\nLatin and Greek poetry is one thing; the music of the rhymed,\nunscanned verse of Villon and the old French poets, la poesie\nchantee, is another.  To combine these two kinds of music in a\nnew school of French poetry, to make verse which should scan\nand rhyme as well, to search out and harmonise the measure of\nevery syllable, and unite it to the swift, flitting, swallow-like\nmotion of rhyme, to penetrate their poetry with a double music–\nthis was the ambition of the Pleiad.  They are insatiable of music,\nthey cannot have enough of it; they desire a music of greater\ncompass perhaps than words can possibly yield, to drain out the\nlast drops of sweetness which a certain note or accent contains.",
        "[169] It was Goudimel, the serious and protestant Goudimel, who\nset Ronsard’s songs to music; but except in this eagerness for\nmusic the poets of the Pleiad seem never quite in earnest.  The\nold Greek and Roman mythology, which the great Italians had\nfound a motive so weighty and severe, becomes with them a mere\ntoy.  That “Lord of terrible aspect,” Amor, has become Love the\nboy, or the babe.  They are full of fine railleries; they delight in\ndiminutives, ondelette, fontelette, doucelette, Cassandrette.\nTheir loves are only half real, a vain effort to prolong the\nimaginative loves of the middle age beyond their natural lifetime.\nThey write love-poems for hire.  Like that party of people who\ntell the tales in Boccaccio’s Decameron, they form a circle which\nin an age of great troubles, losses, anxieties, can amuse itself with\nart, poetry, intrigue.  But they amuse themselves with wonderful\nelegance.  And sometimes their gaiety becomes satiric, for, as\nthey play, real passions insinuate themselves, and at least the\nreality of death.  Their dejection at the thought of leaving this fair\nabode of our common daylight–le beau sejour du commun jour–\nis expressed by them with almost wearisome reiteration.  But\nwith this sentiment too they are able to trifle.  The imagery of\ndeath serves for delicate ornament, and they weave into the airy\nnothingness of their verses their trite reflections on the vanity\n[170] of life.  Just so the grotesque details of the charnel-house\nnest themselves, together with birds and flowers and the fancies\nof the pagan mythology, in the traceries of the architecture of that\ntime, which wantons in its graceful arabesques with the images of\nold age and death.",
        "Ronsard became deaf at sixteen; and it was this circumstance\nwhich finally determined him to be a man of letters instead of a\ndiplomatist, significantly, one might fancy, of a certain premature\nagedness, and of the tranquil, temperate sweetness appropriate to\nthat, in the school of poetry which he founded.  Its charm is that\nof a thing not vigorous or original, but full of the grace which\ncomes of long study and reiterated refinements, and many steps\nrepeated, and many angles worn down, with an exquisite\nfaintness, une fadeur exquise, a certain tenuity and caducity, as\nfor those who can bear nothing vehement or strong; for princes\nweary of love, like Francis the First, or of pleasure, like Henry\nthe Third, or of action, like Henry the Fourth.  Its merits are those\nof the old,–grace and finish, perfect in minute detail.  For these\npeople are a little jaded, and have a constant desire for a subdued\nand delicate excitement, to warm their creeping fancy a little.\nThey love a constant change of rhyme in poetry, and in their\nhouses that strange, fantastic interweaving of thin, reed-like lines,\nwhich are a kind of rhetoric in architecture.",
        "[171] But the poetry of the Pleiad is true not only to the\nphysiognomy of its age, but also to its country–ce pays du\nVendomois–the names and scenery of which so often recur in it:-\n-the great Loire, with its long spaces of white sand; the little river\nLoir; the heathy, upland country, with its scattered pools of water\nand waste road-sides, and retired manors, with their crazy old\nfeudal defences half fallen into decay; La Beauce, where the vast\nrolling fields seem to anticipate the great western sea itself.  It is\nfull of the traits of that country.  We see Du Bellay and Ronsard\ngardening, or hunting with their dogs, or watch the pastimes of a\nrainy day; and with all this is connected a domesticity, a\nhomeliness and simple goodness, by which the Northern country\ngains upon the South.  They have the love of the aged for\nwarmth, and understand the poetry of winter; for they are not far\nfrom the Atlantic, and the west wind which comes up from it,\nturning the poplars white, spares not this new Italy in France.  So\nthe fireside often appears, with the pleasures of the frosty season,\nabout the vast emblazoned chimneys of the time, and with a\nbonhomie as of little children, or old people.",
        "It is in Du Bellay’s Olive, a collection of sonnets in praise of a\nhalf-imaginary lady, Sonnetz a la louange d’Olive, that these\ncharacteristics are most abundant.  Here is a perfectly crystallised\nexample:–",
        "[172]",
        "That he is thus a characteristic specimen of the poetical taste of\nthat age, is indeed Du Bellay’s chief interest.  But if his work is\nto have the highest sort of interest, if it is to do something more\nthan satisfy curiosity, if it is to have an aesthetic as distinct from\nan historical value, it is not enough for a poet to have been the\ntrue child of his age, to have conformed to its aesthetic\nconditions, and by so conforming to have charmed and stimulated\nthat age; it is necessary that there should be perceptible in his\nwork something individual, inventive, unique, the impress there\nof the writer’s own temper and personality.  This impress M.\nSainte-Beuve thought he found in the Antiquites de Rome, and\nthe Regrets, which he ranks as what has been called poesie\nintime, that intensely modern sort of poetry in which the writer\nhas for his aim the portraiture of his own most intimate moods,\nand [173] to take the reader into his confidence.  That age had\nother instances of this intimacy of sentiment: Montaigne’s Essays\nare full of it, the carvings of the church of Brou are full of it.  M.\nSainte-Beuve has perhaps exaggerated the influence of this\nquality in Du Bellay’s Regrets; but the very name of the book has\na touch of Rousseau about it, and reminds one of a whole\ngeneration of self-pitying poets in modern times.  It was in the\natmosphere of Rome, to him so strange and mournful, that these\npale flowers grew up.  For that journey to Italy, which he\ndeplored as the greatest misfortune of his life, put him in full\npossession of his talent, and brought out all its originality.  And\nin effect you do find intimacy, intimite, here.  The trouble of his\nlife is analysed, and the sentiment of it conveyed directly to our\nminds; not a great sorrow or passion, but only the sense of loss in\npassing days, the ennui of a dreamer who must plunge into the\nworld’s affairs, the opposition between actual life and the ideal, a\nlonging for rest, nostalgia, home-sickness–that pre-eminently\nchildish, but so suggestive sorrow, as significant of the final\nregret of all human creatures for the familiar earth and limited\nsky.",
        "The feeling for landscape is often described as a modern one; still\nmore so is that for antiquity, the sentiment of ruins.  Du Bellay\nhas this sentiment.  The duration of the hard, sharp outlines of\nthings is a grief to him, and passing his wearisome [174] days\namong the ruins of ancient Rome, he is consoled by the thought\nthat all must one day end, by the sentiment of the grandeur of\nnothingness–la grandeur du rien.  With a strange touch of far-off\nmysticism, he thinks that the great whole–le grand tout–into\nwhich all other things pass and lose themselves, ought itself\nsometimes to perish and pass away.  Nothing less can relieve his\nweariness.  From the stately aspects of Rome his thoughts went\nback continually to France, to the smoking chimneys of his little\nvillage, the longer twilight of the North, the soft climate of\nAnjou–La douceur Angevine; yet not so much to the real France,\nwe may be sure, with its dark streets and roofs of rough-hewn\nslate, as to that other country, with slenderer towers, and more\nwinding rivers, and trees like flowers, and with softer sunshine on\nmore gracefully-proportioned fields and ways, which the fancy of\nthe exile, and the pilgrim, and of the schoolboy far from home,\nand of those kept at home unwillingly, everywhere builds up\nbefore or behind them.",
        "He came home at last, through the Grisons, by slow journeys;\nand there, in the cooler air of his own country, under its skies of\nmilkier blue, the sweetest flower of his genius sprang up.  There\nhave been poets whose whole fame has rested on one poem, as\nGray’s on the Elegy in a Country Churchyard, or Ronsard’s, as\nmany critics have thought, on the eighteen lines of [175] one\nfamous ode.  Du Bellay has almost been the poet of one poem;\nand this one poem of his is an Italian product transplanted into\nthat green country of Anjou; out of the Latin verses of Andrea\nNavagero, into French.  But it is a composition in which the\nmatter is almost nothing, and the form almost everything; and the\nform of the poem as it stands, written in old French, is all Du\nBellay’s own.  It is a song which the winnowers are supposed to\nsing as they winnow the corn, and they invoke the winds to lie\nlightly on the grain.",
        "[176]",
        "That has, in the highest degree, the qualities, the value, of the\nwhole Pleiad school of poetry, of the whole phase of taste from\nwhich that school derives–a certain silvery grace of fancy, nearly\nall the pleasure of which is in the surprise at the happy and\ndexterous way in which a thing slight in itself is handled.  The\nsweetness of it is by no means to be got at by crushing, as you\ncrush wild herbs to get at their perfume.  One seems to hear the\nmeasured motion of the fans, with a child’s pleasure on coming\nacross the incident for the first time, in one of those great barns of\nDu Bellay’s own country, La Beauce, the granary of France.  A\nsudden light transfigures some trivial thing, a weather-vane, a\nwind-mill, a winnowing fan, the dust in the barn door.  A\nmoment–and the thing has vanished, because it was pure effect;\nbut it leaves a relish behind it, a longing that the accident may\nhappen again.",

        "GOETHE’S fragments of art-criticism contain a few pages of\nstrange pregnancy on the character of Winckelmann.  He speaks\nof the teacher who had made his career possible, but whom he\nhad never seen, as of an abstract type of culture, consummate,\ntranquil, withdrawn already into the region of ideals, yet retaining\ncolour from the incidents of a passionate intellectual life.\nHe classes him with certain works of art, possessing an\ninexhaustible gift of suggestion, to which criticism may return\nagain and again with renewed freshness.  Hegel, in his lectures on\nthe Philosophy of Art, estimating the work of his predecessors,\nhas also passed a remarkable judgment on Winckelmann’s\nwritings:–\"Winckelmann, by contemplation of the ideal works of\nthe ancients, received a sort of inspiration, through which he\nopened a new sense for the study of art.  He is to be regarded as\none of those who, in the sphere of art, have known how to initiate\na new organ for the human spirit.”  That it has [178] given a new\nsense, that it has laid open a new organ, is the highest that can be\nsaid of any critical effort.  It is interesting then to ask what kind\nof man it was who thus laid open a new organ.  Under what\nconditions was that effected?",
        "Johann Joachim Winckelmann was born at Stendal, in\nBrandenburg, in the year 1717.  The child of a poor tradesman,\nhe passed through many struggles in early youth, the memory of\nwhich ever remained in him as a fitful cause of dejection.  In\n1763, in the full emancipation of his spirit, looking over the\nbeautiful Roman prospect, he writes–\"One gets spoiled here; but\nGod owed me this; in my youth I suffered too much.”  Destined\nto assert and interpret the charm of the Hellenic spirit, he served\nfirst a painful apprenticeship in the tarnished intellectual world of\nGermany in the earlier half of the eighteenth century.  Passing out\nof that into the happy light of the antique, he had a sense of\nexhilaration almost physical.  We find him as a child in the dusky\nprecincts of a German school, hungrily feeding on a few\ncolourless books.  The master of this school grows blind;\nWinckelmann becomes his famulus.  The old man would have\nhad him study theology.  Winckelmann, free of the master’s\nlibrary,\tchooses rather to become familiar with the Greek\nclassics.  Herodotus and Homer win, with their “vowelled\"\nGreek, his warmest enthusiasm; whole nights of fever are\ndevoted to them; disturbing dreams of an [179] Odyssey of his\nown come to him.  “He felt in himself,” says Madame de Stael,\n\"an ardent attraction towards the south.  In German imaginations\neven now traces are often to be found of that love of the sun, that\nweariness of the North (cette fatigue du nord), which carried the\nnorthern peoples away into the countries of the South.  A fine sky\nbrings to birth sentiments not unlike the love of one’s\nFatherland.”",
        "To most of us, after all our steps towards it, the antique world, in\nspite of its intense outlines, its own perfect self-expression, still\nremains faint and remote.  To him, closely limited except on the\nside of the ideal, building for his dark poverty “a house not made\nwith hands,” it early came to seem more real than the present.  In\nthe fantastic plans of foreign travel continually passing through\nhis mind, to Egypt, for instance, and to France, there seems\nalways to be rather a wistful sense of something lost to be\nregained, than the desire of discovering anything new.  Goethe\nhas told us how, in his eagerness actually to handle the antique,\nhe became interested in the insignificant vestiges of it which the\nneighbourhood of Strasburg afforded.  So we hear of\nWinckelmann’s boyish antiquarian wanderings among the ugly\nBrandenburg sandhills.  Such a conformity between himself and\nWinckelmann, Goethe would have gladly noted.",
        "At twenty-one he enters the University of Halle, to study\ntheology, as his friends desire; [180] instead, he becomes the\nenthusiastic translator of Herodotus.  The condition of Greek\nlearning in German schools and universities had fallen, and there\nwere no professors at Halle who could satisfy his sharp,\nintellectual craving.  Of his professional education he always\nspeaks with scorn, claiming to have been his own teacher from\nfirst to last.  His appointed teachers did not perceive that a new\nsource of culture was within their hands.  Homo vagus et\ninconstans!–one of them pedantically reports of the future\npilgrim to Rome, unaware on which side his irony was whetted.\nWhen professional education confers nothing but irritation on a\nSchiller, no one ought to be surprised; for Schiller, and such as\nhe, are primarily spiritual adventurers.  But that Winckelmann,\nthe votary of the gravest of intellectual traditions, should get\nnothing but an attempt at suppression from the professional\nguardians of learning, is what may well surprise us.",
        "In 1743 he became master of a school at Seehausen.  This was the\nmost wearisome period of his life.  Notwithstanding a success in\ndealing with children, which seems to testify to something simple\nand primeval in his nature, he found the work of teaching very\ndepressing.  Engaged in this work, he writes that he still has\nwithin him a longing desire to attain to the knowledge of beauty–\nsehnlich wunschte zur Kenntniss des Schonen zu gelangen.  He\nhad to shorten his nights, [181] sleeping only four hours, to gain\ntime for reading.  And here Winckelmann made a step forward in\nculture.  He multiplied his intellectual force by detaching from it\nall flaccid interests.  He renounced mathematics and law, in\nwhich his reading had been considerable,–all but the literature of\nthe arts.  Nothing was to enter into his life unpenetrated by its\ncentral enthusiasm.  At this time he undergoes the charm of\nVoltaire.  Voltaire belongs to that flimsier, more artificial,\nclassical tradition, which Winckelmann was one day to supplant,\nby the clear ring, the eternal outline, of the genuine antique.  But\nit proves the authority of such a gift as Voltaire’s that it allures\nand wins even those born to supplant it.  Voltaire’s impression on\nWinckelmann was never effaced; and it gave him a consideration\nfor French literature which contrasts with his contempt for the\nliterary products of Germany.  German literature transformed,\nsiderealised, as we see it in Goethe, reckons Winckelmann\namong its initiators.  But Germany at that time presented nothing\nin which he could have anticipated Iphigenie, and the formation\nof an effective classical tradition in German literature.",
        "Under this purely literary influence, Winckelmann protests\nagainst Christian Wolff and the philosophers.  Goethe, in\nspeaking of this protest, alludes to his own obligations to\nEmmanuel Kant.  Kant’s influence over the [182] culture of\nGoethe, which he tells us could not have been resisted by him\nwithout loss, consisted in a severe limitation to the concrete.  But\nhe adds, that in born antiquaries, like Winckelmann, a constant\nhandling of the antique, with its eternal outline, maintains that\nlimitation as effectually as a critical philosophy.  Plato, however,\nsaved so often for his redeeming literary manner, is excepted\nfrom Winckelmann’s proscription of the philosophers.  The\nmodern student most often meets Plato on that side which seems\nto pass beyond Plato into a world no longer pagan, based upon\nthe conception of a spiritual life.  But the element of affinity\nwhich he presents to Winckelmann is that which is wholly Greek,\nand alien from the Christian world, represented by that group of\nbrilliant youths in the Lysis, still uninfected by any spiritual\nsickness, finding the end of all endeavour in the aspects of the\nhuman form, the continual stir and motion of a comely human\nlife.",
        "This new-found interest in Plato’s dialogues could not fail to\nincrease his desire to visit the countries of the classical tradition.\n\"It is my misfortune,” he writes, “ that I was not born to great\nplace, wherein I might have had cultivation, and the opportunity\nof following my instinct and forming myself.”  A visit to Rome\nprobably was already designed, and he silently preparing for it.\nCount Bunau, the author of a historical work then of note, had\ncollected at Nothenitz a [183] valuable library, now part of the\nlibrary of Dresden.  In 1748 Winckelmann wrote to Bunau in\nhalting French:–He is emboldened, he says, by Bunau’s\nindulgence for needy men of letters.  He desires only to devote\nhimself to study, having never allowed himself to be dazzled by\nfavourable prospects in the Church.  He hints at his doubtful\nposition “in a metaphysical age, by which humane literature is\ntrampled under foot.  At present,” he goes on, “little value is set\non Greek literature, to which I have devoted myself so far as I\ncould penetrate, when good books are so scarce and expensive.\"\nFinally, he desires a place in some corner of Bunau’s library.\n\"Perhaps, at some future time, I shall become more useful to the\npublic, if, drawn from obscurity in whatever way, I can find\nmeans to maintain myself in the capital.”",
        "Soon afterwards we find Winckelmann in the library at\nNothenitz.  Thence he made many visits to the collection of\nantiquities at Dresden.  He became acquainted with many artists,\nabove all with Oeser, Goethe’s future friend and master, who,\nuniting a high culture with the practical knowledge of art, was\nfitted to minister to Winckelmann’s culture.  And now a new\nchannel of communion with the Greek life was opened for him.\nHitherto he had handled the words only of Greek poetry, stirred\nindeed and roused by them, yet divining beyond the words some\nunexpressed pulsation of sensuous life.  Suddenly [184] he is in\ncontact with that life, still fervent in the relics of plastic art.\nFilled as our culture is with the classical spirit, we can hardly\nimagine how deeply the human mind was moved, when, at the\nRenaissance, in the midst of a frozen world, the buried fire of\nancient art rose up from under the soil.  Winckelmann here\nreproduces for us the earlier sentiment of the Renaissance.  On a\nsudden the imagination feels itself free.  How facile and direct, it\nseems to say, is this life of the senses and the understanding,\nwhen once we have apprehended it!  Here, surely, is that more\nliberal mode of life we have been seeking so long, so near to us\nall the while.  How mistaken and roundabout have been our\nefforts to reach it by mystic passion, and monastic reverie; how\nthey have deflowered the flesh; how little have they really\nemancipated us!  Hermione melts from her stony posture, and the\nlost proportions of life right themselves.  Here, then, in vivid\nrealisation we see the native tendency of Winckelmann to escape\nfrom abstract theory to intuition, to the exercise of sight and\ntouch.  Lessing, in the Laocoon, has theorised finely on the\nrelation of poetry to sculpture; and philosophy may give us\ntheoretical reasons why not poetry but sculpture should be the\nmost sincere and exact expression of the Greek ideal.  By a\nhappy, unperplexed dexterity, Winckelmann solves the question\nin the concrete.  It is what Goethe calls his Gewahrwerden der\ngriechischen Kunst, his finding of Greek art.",
        "[185] Through the tumultuous richness of Goethe’s culture, the\ninfluence of Winckelmann is always discernible, as the strong,\nregulative under-current of a clear, antique motive.  “One learns\nnothing from him,” he says to Eckermann, “but one becomes\nsomething.”  If we ask what the secret of this influence was,\nGoethe himself will tell us–wholeness, unity with one’s self,\nintellectual integrity.  And yet these expressions, because they fit\nGoethe, with his universal culture, so well, seem hardly to\ndescribe the narrow, exclusive interest of Winckelmann.\nDoubtless Winckelmann’s perfection is a narrow perfection: his\nfeverish nursing of the one motive of his life is a contrast to\nGoethe’s various energy.  But what affected Goethe, what\ninstructed him and ministered to his culture, was the integrity, the\ntruth to its type, of the given force.  The development of this\nforce was the single interest of Winckelmann, unembarrassed by\nanything else in him.  Other interests, practical or intellectual,\nthose slighter talents and motives not supreme, which in most\nmen are the waste part of nature, and drain away their vitality, he\nplucked out and cast from him.  The protracted longing of his\nyouth is not a vague, romantic longing: he knows what he longs\nfor, what he wills.  Within its severe limits his enthusiasm burns\nlike lava.  “You know,” says Lavater, speaking of\nWinckelmann’s countenance, “that I consider ardour and\nindifference by no means incompatible in the [186] same\ncharacter.  If ever there was a striking instance of that union, it is\nin the countenance before us.”  “A lowly childhood,” says\nGoethe, “insufficient instruction in youth, broken, distracted\nstudies in early manhood, the burden of school-keeping!  He was\nthirty years old before he enjoyed a single favour of fortune: but\nso soon as he had attained to an adequate condition of freedom,\nhe appears before us consummate and entire, complete in the\nancient sense.”",
        "But his hair is turning grey, and he has not yet reached the south.\nThe Saxon court had become Roman Catholic, and the way to\nfavour at Dresden was through Roman ecclesiastics.  Probably\nthe thought of a profession of the papal religion was not new to\nWinckelmann.  At one time he had thought of begging his way to\nRome, from cloister to cloister, under the pretence of a\ndisposition to change his faith.  In 1751, the papal nuncio,\nArchinto, was one of the visitors at Nothenitz.  He suggested\nRome as the fitting stage for Winckelmann’s accomplishments,\nand held out the hope of a place in the Pope’s library.  Cardinal\nPassionei, charmed with Winckelmann’s beautiful Greek writing,\nwas ready to play the part of Maecenas, if the indispensable\nchange were made.  Winckelmann accepted the bribe, and visited\nthe nuncio at Dresden.  Unquiet still at the word “profession,” not\nwithout a struggle, he joined the Roman Church, July the 11th,\n1754.",
        "[187] Goethe boldly pleads that Winckelmann was a pagan, that\nthe landmarks of Christendom meant nothing to him.  It is clear\nthat he intended to deceive no one by his disguise; fears of the\ninquisition are sometimes visible during his life in Rome; he\nentered Rome notoriously with the works of Voltaire in his\npossession; the thought of what Count Bunau might be thinking\nof him seems to have been his greatest difficulty.  On the other\nhand, he may have had a sense of a certain antique and as it were\npagan grandeur in the Roman Catholic religion.  Turning from\nthe crabbed Protestantism, which had been the ennui of his youth,\nhe might reflect that while Rome had reconciled itself to the\nRenaissance, the Protestant principle in art had cut off Germany\nfrom the supreme tradition of beauty.  And yet to that transparent\nnature, with its simplicity as of the earlier world, the loss of\nabsolute sincerity must have been a real loss.  Goethe\nunderstands that Winckelmann had made this sacrifice.  Yet at\nthe bar of the highest criticism, perhaps, Winckelmann may be\nabsolved.  The insincerity of his religious profession was only\none incident of a culture in which the moral instinct, like the\nreligious or political, was merged in the artistic.  But then the\nartistic interest was that, by desperate faithfulness to which\nWinckelmann was saved from the mediocrity, which, breaking\nthrough no bounds, moves ever in a bloodless routine, and misses\nits one [188] chance in the life of the spirit and the intellect.\nThere have been instances of culture developed by every high\nmotive in turn, and yet intense at every point; and the aim of our\nculture should be to attain not only as intense but as complete a\nlife as possible.  But often the higher life is only possible at all,\non condition of the selection of that in which one’s motive is\nnative and strong; and this selection involves the renunciation of\na crown reserved for others.  Which is better?–to lay open a new\nsense, to initiate a new organ for the human spirit, or to cultivate\nmany types of perfection up to a point which leaves us still\nbeyond the range of their transforming power?  Savonarola is one\ntype of success; Winckelmann is another; criticism can reject\nneither, because each is true to itself.  Winckelmann himself\nexplains the motive of his life when he says, “It will be my\nhighest reward, if posterity acknowledges that I have written\nworthily.”",
        "For a time he remained at Dresden.  There his first book\nappeared, Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek Works of Art in\nPainting and Sculpture.  Full of obscurities as it was, obscurities\nwhich baffled but did not offend Goethe when he first turned to\nart-criticism, its purpose was direct–an appeal from the artificial\nclassicism of the day to the study of the antique.  The book was\nwell received, and a pension supplied through the king’s\nconfessor.  In September 1755 he started for Rome, in the\ncompany of a young [189] Jesuit.  He was introduced to Raphael\nMengs, a painter then of note, and found a home near him, in the\nartists’ quarter, in a place where he could “overlook, far and\nwide, the eternal city.”  At first he was perplexed with the sense\nof being a stranger on what was to him, spiritually, native soil.\n\"Unhappily,” he cries in French, often selected by him as the\nvehicle of strong feeling, “I am one of those whom the Greeks\ncall opsimatheis.+–I have come into the world and into Italy too\nlate.”  More than thirty years afterwards, Goethe also, after many\naspirations and severe preparation of mind, visited Italy.  In early\nmanhood, just as he too was finding Greek art, the rumour of that\ntrue artist’s life of Winckelmann in Italy had strongly moved\nhim.  At Rome, spending a whole year drawing from the antique,\nin preparation for Iphigenie, he finds the stimulus of\nWinckelmann’s memory ever active.  Winckelmann’s Roman life\nwas simple, primeval, Greek.  His delicate constitution permitted\nhim the use only of bread and wine.  Condemned by many as a\nrenegade, he had no desire for places of honour, but only to see\nhis merits acknowledged, and existence assured to him.  He was\nsimple without being niggardly; he desired to be neither poor nor\nrich.",
        "Winckelmann’s first years in Rome present all the elements of an\nintellectual situation of the highest interest.  The beating of the\nsoul against its bars, the sombre aspect, the alien traditions,*\n[190] the still barbarous literature of Germany, are afar off;\nbefore him are adequate conditions of culture, the sacred soil\nitself, the first tokens of the advent of the new German literature,\nwith its broad horizons, its boundless intellectual promise.\nDante, passing from the darkness of the Inferno, is filled with a\nsharp and joyful sense of light, which makes him deal with it, in\nthe opening of the Purgatorio, in a wonderfully touching and\npenetrative way.  Hellenism, which is the principle pre-eminently\nof intellectual light (our modern culture may have more colour,\nthe medieval spirit greater heat and profundity, but Hellenism is\npre-eminent for light), has always been most effectively\nconceived by those who have crept into it out of an intellectual\nworld in which the sombre elements predominate.  So it had been\nin the ages of the Renaissance.  This repression, removed at last,\ngave force and glow to Winckelmann’s native affinity to the\nHellenic spirit.  “There had been known before him,” says\nMadame de Stael, “learned men who might be consulted like\nbooks; but no one had, if I may say so, made himself a pagan for\nthe purpose of penetrating antiquity.”  “One is always a poor\nexecutant of conceptions not one’s own.\"–On execute mal ce\nqu’on n’a pas concu soi-meme*–are true in their measure of\nevery genuine enthusiasm.  Enthusiasm,–that, in the broad\nPlatonic sense of the Phaedrus, was the secret of [191] his\ndivinatory Power over the Hellenic world.  This enthusiasm,\ndependent as it is to a great degree on bodily temperament, has a\npower of re-enforcing the purer emotions of the intellect with an\nalmost physical excitement.  That his affinity with Hellenism was\nnot merely intellectual, that the subtler threads of temperament\nwere inwoven in it, is proved by his romantic, fervent friendships\nwith young men.  He has known, he says, many young men more\nbeautiful than Guido’s archangel.  These friendships, bringing\nhim into contact with the pride of human form, and staining the\nthoughts with its bloom, perfected his reconciliation to the spirit\nof Greek sculpture.  A letter on taste, addressed from Rome to a\nyoung nobleman, Friedrich von Berg, is the record of such a\nfriendship.",
        "“I shall excuse my delay,” he begins, “in fulfilling my promise of an\nessay on the taste for beauty in works of art, in the words of Pindar.\nHe says to Agesidamus, a youth of Locri–idea te kalon, hora te\nkekramenon–whom he had kept waiting for an intended ode, that a debt\npaid with usury is the end of reproach.  This may win your good-nature\non behalf of my present essay, which has turned out far more detailed\nand circumstantial than I had at first intended.  “It is from yourself\nthat the subject is taken.  Our intercourse has been short, too short\nboth for you and me; but the first time I saw you, the affinity of our\nspirits was revealed to me: [192] your culture proved that my hope was\nnot groundless; and I found in a beautiful body a soul created for\nnobleness, gifted with the sense of beauty.  My parting from you was\ntherefore one of the most painful in my life; and that this feeling\ncontinues our common friend is witness, for your separation from me\nleaves me no hope of seeing you again.  Let this essay be a memorial\nof our friendship, which, on my side, is free from every selfish\nmotive, and ever remains subject and dedicate to yourself alone.”",
        "The following passage is characteristic–",
        "“As it is confessedly the beauty of man which is to be conceived\nunder one general idea, so I have noticed that those who are\nobservant of beauty only in women, and are moved little or not at\nall by the beauty of men, seldom have an impartial, vital, inborn\ninstinct for beauty in art.  To such persons the beauty of Greek art\nwill ever seem wanting, because its supreme beauty is rather\nmale than female.  But the beauty of art demands a higher\nsensibility than the beauty of nature, because the beauty of art,\nlike tears shed at a play, gives no pain, is without life, and must\nbe awakened and repaired by culture.  Now, as the spirit of\nculture is much more ardent in youth than in manhood, the\ninstinct of which I am speaking must be exercised and directed to\nwhat is beautiful, before that age is reached, at which one would\nbe afraid to confess that one had no taste for it.”",
        "[193] Certainly, of that beauty of living form which regulated\nWinckelmann’s friendships, it could not be said that it gave no\npain.  One notable friendship, the fortune of which we may trace\nthrough his letters, begins with an antique, chivalrous letter in\nFrench, and ends noisily in a burst of angry fire.  Far from\nreaching the quietism, the bland indifference of art, such\nattachments are nevertheless more susceptible than any others of\nequal strength of a purely intellectual culture.  Of passion, of\nphysical excitement, they contain only just so much as stimulates\nthe eye to the finest delicacies of colour and form.  These\nfriendships, often the caprices of a moment, make\nWinckelmann’s letters, with their troubled colouring, an\ninstructive but bizarre addition to the History of Art, that shrine of\ngrave and mellow light around the mute Olympian family.  The\nimpression which Winckelmann’s literary life conveyed to those\nabout him was that of excitement, intuition, inspiration, rather\nthan the contemplative evolution of general principles.  The\nquick, susceptible enthusiast, betraying his temperament even in\nappearance, by his olive complexion, his deep-seated, piercing\neyes, his rapid movements, apprehended the subtlest principles of\nthe Hellenic manner, not through the understanding, but by\ninstinct or touch.  A German biographer of Winckelmann has\ncompared him to Columbus.  That is not the aptest of comparisons;\nbut it reminds one of  [194] a passage in which Edgar Quinet\ndescribes the great discoverer’s famous voyage.  His science was\noften at fault; but he had a way of estimating at once the slightest\nindication of land, in a floating weed or passing bird; he seemed\nactually to come nearer to nature than other men.  And that world\nin which others had moved with so much embarrassment, seems\nto call out in Winckelmann new senses fitted to deal with it.  He\nis in touch with it; it penetrates him, and becomes part of his\ntemperament.  He remodels his writings with constant renewal of\ninsight; he catches the thread of a whole sequence of laws in\nsome hollowing of the hand, or dividing of the hair; he seems to\nrealise that fancy of the reminiscence of a forgotten knowledge\nhidden for a time in the mind itself; as if the mind of one, lover\nand philosopher at once in some phase of pre-existence–philosophesas\npote met’ erotos.+–fallen into a new cycle, were beginning its\nintellectual career over again, yet with a certain power of\nanticipating its results.  So comes the truth of Goethe’s judgments\non his works; they are a life, a living thing, designed for those who\nare alive–ein Lebendiges fur die Lebendigen geschrieben, ein\nLeben selbst.",
        "In 1758 Cardinal Albani, who had formed in his Roman villa a\nprecious collection of antiquities, became Winckelmann’s patron.\nPompeii had just opened its treasures; Winckelmann [195]\ngathered its first-fruits.  But his plan of a visit to Greece remained\nunfulfilled.  From his first arrival in Rome he had kept the\nHistory of Ancient Art ever in view.  All his other writings were a\npreparation for that.  It appeared, finally, in 1764; but even after\nits publication Winckelmann was still employed in perfecting it.\nIt is since his time that many of the most significant examples of\nGreek art have been submitted to criticism.  He had seen little or\nnothing of what we ascribe to the age of Pheidias; and his\nconception of Greek art tends, therefore, to put the mere elegance\nof the imperial society of ancient Rome in place of the severe and\nchastened grace of the palaestra.  For the most part he had to\npenetrate to Greek art through copies, imitations, and later\nRoman art itself; and it is not surprising that this turbid medium\nhas left in Winckelmann’s actual results much that a more\nprivileged criticism can correct.",
        "He had been twelve years in Rome.  Admiring Germany had\nmade many calls to him.  At last, in 1768, he set out to revisit the\ncountry of his birth; and as he left Rome, a strange, inverted\nhome-sickness, a strange reluctance to leave it at all, came over\nhim.  He reached Vienna.  There he was loaded with honours and\npresents: other cities were awaiting him.  Goethe, then nineteen\nyears old, studying art at Leipsic, was expecting his coming, with\nthat wistful eagerness which marked his youth, when the news\n[196] of Winckelmann’s murder arrived.  All his “weariness of\nthe North” had revived with double force.  He left Vienna,\nintending to hasten back to Rome, and at Trieste a delay of a few\ndays occurred.  With characteristic openness, Winckelmann had\nconfided his plans to a fellow-traveller, a man named Arcangeli,\nand had shown him the gold medals received at Vienna.\nArcangeli’s avarice was aroused.  One morning he entered\nWinckelmann’s room, under pretence of taking leave.\nWinckelmann was then writing “memoranda for the future editor\nof the History of Art,” still seeking the perfection of his great\nwork.  Arcangeli begged to see the medals once more.  As\nWinckelmann stooped down to take them from the chest, a cord\nwas thrown round his neck.  Some time afterwards, a child with\nwhose companionship Winckelmann had beguiled his delay,\nknocked at the door, and receiving no answer, gave the alarm.\nWinckelmann was found dangerously wounded, and died a few\nhours later, after receiving the last sacraments.  It seemed as if the\ngods, in reward for his devotion to them, had given him a death\nwhich, for its swiftness and its opportunity, he might well have\ndesired.  “He has,” says Goethe, “the advantage of figuring in the\nmemory of posterity, as one eternally able and strong; for the\nimage in which one leaves the world is that in which one moves\namong the shadows.”  Yet, perhaps, it is not fanciful to regret that\nhis proposed [197] meeting with Goethe never took place.\nGoethe, then in all the pregnancy of his wonderful youth, still\nunruffled by the “press and storm” of his earlier manhood, was\nawaiting Winckelmann with a curiosity of the worthiest kind.  As\nit was, Winckelmann became to him something like what Virgil\nwas to Dante.  And Winckelmann, with his fiery friendships, had\nreached that age and that period of culture at which emotions\nhitherto fitful, sometimes concentrate themselves in a vital,\nunchangeable relationship.  German literary history seems to\nhave lost the chance of one of those famous friendships, the very\ntradition of which becomes a stimulus to culture, and exercises an\nimperishable influence.",
        "In one of the frescoes of the Vatican, Raphael has commemorated\nthe tradition of the Catholic religion.  Against a space of tranquil\nsky, broken in upon by the beatific vision, are ranged the great\npersonages of Christian history, with the Sacrament in the midst.\nAnother fresco of Raphael in the same apartment presents a very\ndifferent company, Dante alone appearing in both.  Surrounded\nby the muses of Greek mythology, under a thicket of laurel, sits\nApollo, with the sources of Castalia at his feet.  On either side are\ngrouped those on whom the spirit of Apollo descended, the\nclassical and Renaissance poets, to whom the waters of Castalia\n[198] come down, a river making glad this other “city of God.\"\nIn this fresco it is the classical tradition, the orthodoxy of taste,\nthat Raphael commemorates.  Winckelmann’s intellectual history\nauthenticates the claims of this tradition in human culture.  In the\ncountries where that tradition arose, where it still lurked about its\nown artistic relics, and changes of language had not broken its\ncontinuity, national pride might sometimes light up anew an\nenthusiasm for it.  Aliens might imitate that enthusiasm, and\nclassicism become from time to time an intellectual fashion.  But\nWinckelmann was not further removed by language, than by\nlocal aspects and associations, from those vestiges of the classical\nspirit; and he lived at a time when, in Germany, classical studies\nwere out of favour.  Yet, remote in time and place, he feels after\nthe Hellenic world, divines those channels of ancient art, in\nwhich its life still circulates, and, like Scyles, the half-barbarous\nyet Hellenising king, in the beautiful story of Herodotus, is\nirresistibly attracted by it.  This testimony to the authority of the\nHellenic tradition, its fitness to satisfy some vital requirement of\nthe intellect, which Winckelmann contributes as a solitary man of\ngenius, is offered also by the general history of the mind.  The\nspiritual forces of the past, which have prompted and informed\nthe culture of a succeeding age, live, indeed, within that culture,\nbut with an absorbed, underground life.  The Hellenic element\nalone [199] has not been so absorbed, or content with this\nunderground life; from time to time it has started to the surface;\nculture has been drawn back to its sources to be clarified and\ncorrected.  Hellenism is not merely an absorbed element in our\nintellectual life; it is a conscious tradition in it.",
        "Again, individual genius works ever under conditions of time and\nplace: its products are coloured by the varying aspects of nature,\nand type of human form, and outward manners of life.  There is\nthus an element of change in art; criticism must never for a\nmoment forget that “the artist is the child of his time.”  But\nbesides these conditions of time and place, and independent of\nthem, there is also an element of permanence, a standard of taste,\nwhich genius confesses.  This standard is maintained in a purely\nintellectual tradition.  It acts upon the artist, not as one of the\ninfluences of his own age, but through those artistic products of\nthe previous generation which first excited, while they directed\ninto a particular channel, his sense of beauty.  The supreme\nartistic products of succeeding generations thus form a series of\nelevated points, taking each from each the reflection of a strange\nlight, the source of which is not in the atmosphere around and\nabove them, but in a stage of society remote from ours.  The\nstandard of taste, then, was fixed in Greece, at a definite\nhistorical period.  A tradition for all succeeding generations, it\noriginates in a spontaneous [200] growth out of the influences of\nGreek society.  What were the conditions under which this ideal,\nthis standard of artistic orthodoxy, was generated?  How was\nGreece enabled to force its thought upon Europe?",
        "Greek art, when we first catch sight of it, is entangled with Greek\nreligion.  We are accustomed to think of Greek religion as the\nreligion of art and beauty, the religion of which the Olympian\nZeus and the Athena Polias are the idols, the poems of Homer the\nsacred books.  Thus Cardinal Newman speaks of “the classical\npolytheism which was gay and graceful, as was natural in a\ncivilised age.”  Yet such a view is only a partial one.  In it the eye\nis fixed on the sharp, bright edge of high Hellenic culture, but\nloses sight of the sombre world across which it strikes.  Greek\nreligion, where we can observe it most distinctly, is at once a\nmagnificent ritualistic system, and a cycle of poetical\nconceptions.  Religions, as they grow by natural laws out of\nman’s life, are modified by whatever modifies his life.  They\nbrighten under a bright sky, they become liberal as the social\nrange widens, they grow intense and shrill in the clefts of human\nlife, where the spirit is narrow and confined, and the stars are\nvisible at noonday; and a fine analysis of these differences is one\nof the gravest functions of religious criticism.  Still, the broad\nfoundation, in mere human nature, of all religions as they exist\nfor the greatest number, [201] is a universal pagan sentiment, a\npaganism which existed before the Greek religion, and has\nlingered far onward into the Christian world, ineradicable, like\nsome persistent vegetable growth, because its seed is an element\nof the very soil out of which it springs.",
        "This pagan sentiment measures the sadness with which the\nhuman mind is filled, whenever its thoughts wander far from\nwhat is here, and now.  It is beset by notions of irresistible natural\npowers, for the most part ranged against man, but the secret also\nof his fortune, making the earth golden and the grape fiery for\nhim.  He makes gods in his own image, gods smiling and flower-\ncrowned, or bleeding by some sad fatality, to console him by\ntheir wounds, never closed from generation to generation.  It is\nwith a rush of home-sickness that the thought of death presents\nitself.  He would remain at home for ever on the earth if he could.\nAs it loses its colour and the senses fail, he clings ever closer to\nit; but since the mouldering of bones and flesh must go on to the\nend, he is careful for charms and talismans, which may chance to\nhave some friendly power in them, when the inevitable shipwreck\ncomes.  Such sentiment is a part of the eternal basis of all\nreligions, modified indeed by changes of time and place, but\nindestructible, because its root is so deep in the earth of man’s\nnature.  The breath of religious initiators passes over them; a few\n\"rise up with wings as eagles,” [202] but the broad level of\nreligious life is not permanently changed.  Religious progress,\nlike all purely spiritual progress, is confined to a few.  This\nsentiment attaches itself in the earliest times to certain usages of\npatriarchal life, the kindling of fire, the washing of the body, the\nslaughter of the flock, the gathering of harvest, holidays and\ndances.  Here are the beginnings of a ritual, at first as occasional\nand unfixed as the sentiment which it expresses, but destined to\nbecome the permanent element of religious life.  The usages of\npatriarchal life change; but this germ of ritual remains, promoted\nnow with a consciously religious motive, losing its domestic\ncharacter, and therefore becoming more and more inexplicable\nwith each generation.  Such pagan worship, in spite of local\nvariations, essentially one, is an element in all religions.  It is the\nanodyne which the religious principle, like one administering\nopiates to the incurable, has added to the law which makes life\nsombre for the vast majority of mankind.",
        "More definite religious conceptions come from other sources, and\nfix themselves upon this ritual in various ways, changing it, and\ngiving it new meanings.  In Greece they were derived from\nmythology, itself not due to a religious source at all, but\ndeveloping in the course of time into a body of religious\nconceptions, entirely human in form and character.  To the\nunprogressive ritual element it brought these conceptions, itself-\nhe pterou dynamis, the power of the wing–an element [203] of\nrefinement, of ascension, with the promise of an endless destiny.\nWhile the ritual remains unchanged, the aesthetic element, only\naccidentally connected with it, expands with the freedom and\nmobility of the things of the intellect.  Always, the fixed element\nis the religious observance; the fluid, unfixed element is the\nmyth, the religious conception.  This religion is itself pagan, and\nhas in any broad view of it the pagan sadness.  It does not at\nonce, and for the majority, become the higher Hellenic religion.\nThe country people, of course, cherish the unlovely idols of an\nearlier time, such as those which Pausanias found still devoutly\npreserved in Arcadia.  Athenaeus tells the story of one who,\ncoming to a temple of Latona, had expected to find some worthy\npresentment of the mother of Apollo, and laughed on seeing only\na shapeless wooden figure.  The wilder people have wilder gods,\nwhich, however, in Athens, or Corinth, or Lacedaemon, changing\never with the worshippers in whom they live and move and have\ntheir being, borrow something of the lordliness and distinction of\nhuman nature there.  Greek religion too has its mendicants, its\npurifications, its antinomian mysticism, its garments offered to\nthe gods, its statues worn with kissing, its exaggerated\nsuperstitions for the vulgar only, its worship of sorrow, its\naddolorata, its mournful mysteries.  Scarcely a wild or\nmelancholy note of the medieval church but was anticipated by\nGreek polytheism!  What should [204] we have thought of the\nvertiginous prophetess at the very centre of Greek religion?  The\nsupreme Hellenic culture is a sharp edge of light across this\ngloom.  The fiery, stupefying wine becomes in a happier climate\nclear and exhilarating.  The Dorian worship of Apollo, rational,\nchastened, debonair, with his unbroken daylight, always opposed\nto the sad Chthonian divinities, is the aspiring element, by force\nand spring of which Greek religion sublimes itself.  Out of Greek\nreligion, under happy conditions, arises Greek art, to minister to\nhuman culture.  It was the privilege of Greek religion to be able\nto transform itself into an artistic ideal.",
        "For the thoughts of the Greeks about themselves, and their\nrelation to the world generally, were ever in the happiest\nreadiness to be transformed into objects for the senses.  In this\nlies the main distinction between Greek art and the mystical art of\nthe Christian middle age, which is always struggling to express\nthoughts beyond itself.  Take, for instance, a characteristic work\nof the middle age, Angelico’s Coronation of the Virgin, in the\ncloister of Saint Mark’s at Florence.  In some strange halo of a\nmoon Jesus and the Virgin Mother are seated, clad in mystical\nwhite raiment, half shroud, half priestly linen.  Jesus, with rosy\nnimbus and the long pale hair–tanquam lana alba et tanquam\nnix–of the figure in the Apocalypse, with slender finger-tips is\nsetting a crown of pearl on the head of Mary, who, [205] corpse-\nlike in her refinement, is bending forward to receive it, the light\nlying like snow upon her forehead.  Certainly, it cannot be said of\nAngelico’s fresco that it throws into a sensible form our highest\nthoughts about man and his relation to the world; but it did not do\nthis adequately even for Angelico.  For him, all that is outward or\nsensible in his work–the hair like wool, the rosy nimbus, the\ncrown of pearl–is only the symbol or type of a really\ninexpressible world, to which he wishes to direct the thoughts; he\nwould have shrunk from the notion that what the eye\napprehended was all.  Such forms of art, then, are inadequate to\nthe matter they clothe; they remain ever below its level.\nSomething of this kind is true also of oriental art.  As in the\nmiddle age from an exaggerated inwardness, so in the East from a\nvagueness, a want of definition, in thought, the matter presented\nto art is unmanageable, and the forms of sense struggle vainly\nwith it.  The many-headed gods of the East, the orientalised,\nmany-breasted Diana of Ephesus, like Angelico’s fresco, are at\nbest overcharged symbols, a means of hinting at an idea which art\ncannot fitly or completely express, which still remains in the\nworld of shadows.",
        "But take a work of Greek art,–the Venus of Melos.  That is in no\nsense a symbol, a suggestion, of anything beyond its own\nvictorious fairness.  The mind begins and ends with the finite\nimage, yet loses no part of the spiritual motive. [206] That motive\nis not lightly and loosely attached to the sensuous form, as its\nmeaning to an allegory, but saturates and is identical with it.  The\nGreek mind had advanced to a particular stage of self-reflexion,\nbut was careful not to pass beyond it.  In oriental thought there is\na vague conception of life everywhere, but no true appreciation\nof itself by the mind, no knowledge of the distinction of man’s\nnature: in its consciousness of itself, humanity is still confused\nwith the fantastic, indeterminate life of the animal and vegetable\nworld.  In Greek thought, on the other hand, the “lordship of the\nsoul” is recognised; that lordship gives authority and divinity to\nhuman eyes and hands and feet; inanimate nature is thrown into\nthe background.  But just there Greek thought finds its happy\nlimit; it has not yet become too inward; the mind has not yet\nlearned to boast its independence of the flesh; the spirit has not\nyet absorbed everything with its emotions, nor reflected its own\ncolour everywhere.  It has indeed committed itself to a train of\nreflexion which must end in defiance of form, of all that is\noutward, in an exaggerated idealism.  But that end is still distant:\nit has not yet plunged into the depths of religious mysticism.",
        "This ideal art, in which the thought does not outstrip or lie\nbeyond the proper range of its sensible embodiment, could not\nhave arisen out of a phase of life that was uncomely or poor.\nThat delicate pause in Greek reflexion was joined, by [207] some\nsupreme good luck, to the perfect animal nature of the Greeks.\nHere are the two conditions of an artistic ideal.  The influences\nwhich perfected the animal nature of the Greeks are part of the\nprocess by which “the ideal” was evolved.  Those “Mothers\"\nwho, in the second part of Faust, mould and remould the typical\nforms that appear in human history, preside, at the beginning of\nGreek culture, over such a concourse of happy physical\nconditions as ever generates by natural laws some rare type of\nintellectual or spiritual life.  That delicate air, “nimbly and\nsweetly recommending itself” to the senses, the finer aspects of\nnature, the finer lime and clay of the human form, and modelling\nof the dainty framework of the human countenance:–these are\nthe good luck of the Greek when he enters upon life.  Beauty\nbecomes a distinction, like genius, or noble place.",
        "“By no people,” says Winckelmann, “has beauty been so highly\nesteemed as by the Greeks.  The priests of a youthful Jupiter at\nAegae, of the Ismenian Apollo, and the priest who at Tanagra led\nthe procession of Mercury, bearing a lamb upon his shoulders,\nwere always youths to whom the prize of beauty had been\nawarded.  The citizens of Egesta erected a monument to a certain\nPhilip, who was not their fellow-citizen, but of Croton, for his\ndistinguished beauty; and the people made offerings at it.  In an\nancient song, ascribed to Simonides or Epicharmus, [208] of\nfour wishes, the first was health, the second beauty.  And as\nbeauty was so longed for and prized by the Greeks, every\nbeautiful person sought to become known to the whole people by\nthis distinction, and above all to approve himself to the artists,\nbecause they awarded the prize; and this was for the artists an\noccasion for having supreme beauty ever before their eyes.\nBeauty even gave a right to fame; and we find in Greek histories\nthe most beautiful people distinguished.  Some were famous for\nthe beauty of one single part of their form; as Demetrius\nPhalereus, for his beautiful eyebrows, was called Charito-\nblepharos.  It seems even to have been thought that the\nprocreation of beautiful children might be promoted by prizes.\nThis is shown by the existence of contests for beauty, which in\nancient times were established by Cypselus, King of Arcadia, by\nthe river Alpheus; and, at the feast of Apollo of Philae, a prize\nwas offered to the youths for the deftest kiss.  This was decided\nby an umpire; as also at Megara, by the grave of Diocles.  At\nSparta, and at Lesbos, in the temple of Juno, and among the\nParrhasii, there were contests for beauty among women.  The\ngeneral esteem for beauty went so far, that the Spartan women set\nup in their bedchambers a Nireus, a Narcissus, or a Hyacinth, that\nthey might bear beautiful children.”",
        "So, from a few stray antiquarianisms, a few [209] faces cast up\nsharply from the waves, Winckelmann, as his manner was,\ndivines the temperament of the antique world, and that in which it\nhad delight.  It has passed away with that distant age, and we may\nventure to dwell upon it.  What sharpness and reality it has is the\nsharpness and reality of suddenly arrested life.  The Greek system\nof gymnastics originated as part of a religious ritual.  The\nworshipper was to recommend himself to the gods by becoming\nfleet and fair, white and red, like them.  The beauty of the\npalaestra, and the beauty of the artist’s workshop, reacted on one\nanother.  The youth tried to rival his gods; and his increased\nbeauty passed back into them.–\"I take the gods to witness, I had\nrather have a fair body than a king’s crown\"–Omnymi pantas theous\nme helesthai an ten basileos archen anti tou kalos einai+–that\nis the form in which one age of the world chose the higher life.–\nA perfect world, if the gods could have seemed for ever only fleet\nand fair, white and red!  Let us not regret that this unperplexed\nyouth of humanity, satisfied with the vision of itself, passed, at\nthe due moment, into a mournful maturity; for already the deep joy\nwas in store for the spirit, of finding the ideal of that youth still\nred with life in the grave.",
        "It followed that the Greek ideal expressed itself pre-eminently in\nsculpture.  All art has a sensuous element, colour, form, sound–in\npoetry a dexterous recalling of these, together with the profound,\njoyful sensuousness of motion, and each [210] of them may be a\nmedium for the ideal: it is partly accident which in any individual\ncase makes the born artist, poet, or painter rather than sculptor.\nBut as the mind itself has had an historical development, one\nform of art, by the very limitations of its material, may be more\nadequate than another for the expression of any one phase of that\ndevelopment.  Different attitudes of the imagination have a native\naffinity with different types of sensuous form, so that they\ncombine together, with completeness and ease.  The arts may\nthus be ranged in a series, which corresponds to a series of\ndevelopments in the human mind itself.  Architecture, which\nbegins in a practical need, can only express by vague hint or\nsymbol the spirit or mind of the artist.  He closes his sadness over\nhim, or wanders in the perplexed intricacies of things, or projects\nhis purpose from him clean-cut and sincere, or bares himself to\nthe sunlight.  But these spiritualities, felt rather than seen, can but\nlurk about architectural form as volatile effects, to be gathered\nfrom it by reflexion.  Their expression is, indeed, not really\nsensuous at all.  As human form is not the subject with which it\ndeals, architecture is the mode in which the artistic effort centres,\nwhen the thoughts of man concerning himself are still indistinct,\nwhen he is still little preoccupied with those harmonies, storms,\nvictories, of the unseen and intellectual world, which, wrought\nout into the bodily form, give it an interest and significance\n[211] communicable to it alone.  The art of Egypt, with its\nsupreme architectural effects, is, according to Hegel’s beautiful\ncomparison, a Memnon waiting for the day, the day of the Greek\nspirit, the humanistic spirit, with its power of speech.",
        "Again, painting, music, and poetry, with their endless power of\ncomplexity, are the special arts of the romantic and modern ages.\nInto these, with the utmost attenuation of detail, may be\ntranslated every delicacy of thought and feeling, incidental to a\nconsciousness brooding with delight over itself.  Through their\ngradations of shade, their exquisite intervals, they project in an\nexternal form that which is most inward in passion or sentiment.\nBetween architecture and those romantic arts of painting, music,\nand poetry, comes sculpture, which, unlike architecture, deals\nimmediately with man, while it contrasts with the romantic arts,\nbecause it is not self-analytical.  It has to do more exclusively\nthan any other art with the human form, itself one entire medium\nof spiritual expression, trembling, blushing, melting into dew,\nwith inward excitement.  That spirituality which only lurks about\narchitecture as a volatile effect, in sculpture takes up the whole\ngiven material, and penetrates it with an imaginative motive; and\nat first sight sculpture, with its solidity of form, seems a thing\nmore real and full than the faint, abstract world of poetry or\npainting.  Still the fact is the reverse.  Discourse and action show\nman as he is, more directly than the play of [212] the muscles and\nthe moulding of the flesh; and over these poetry has command.\nPainting, by the flushing of colour in the face and dilatation of\nlight in the eye–music, by its subtle range of tones–can refine\nmost delicately upon a single moment of passion, unravelling its\nsubtlest threads.",
        "But why should sculpture thus limit itself to pure form?  Because,\nby this limitation, it becomes a perfect medium of expression for\none peculiar motive of the imaginative intellect.  It therefore\nrenounces all those attributes of its material which do not forward\nthat motive.  It has had, indeed, from the beginning an unfixed\nclaim to colour; but this element of colour in it has always been\nmore or less conventional, with no melting or modulation of\ntones, never permitting more than a very limited realism.  It was\nmaintained chiefly as a religious tradition.  In proportion as the\nart of sculpture ceased to be merely decorative, and subordinate\nto architecture, it threw itself upon pure form.  It renounces the\npower of expression by lower or heightened tones.  In it, no\nmember of the human form is more significant than the rest; the\neye is wide, and without pupil; the lips and brow are hardly less\nsignificant than hands, and breasts, and feet.  But the limitation of\nits resources is part of its pride: it has no backgrounds, no sky or\natmosphere, to suggest and interpret a train of feeling; a little of\nsuggested motion, and much of pure light on its gleaming\nsurfaces, with pure form–only these.",
        "[213] And it gains more than it loses by this limitation to its own\ndistinguishing motives; it unveils man in the repose of his\nunchanging characteristics.  That white light, purged from the\nangry, blood-like stains of action and passion, reveals, not what is\naccidental in man, but the tranquil godship in him, as opposed to\nthe restless accidents of life.  The art of sculpture records the first\nnaive, unperplexed recognition of man by himself; and it is a\nproof of the high artistic capacity of the Greeks, that they\napprehended and remained true to these exquisite limitations, yet,\nin spite of them, gave to their creations a mobile, a vital,\nindividuality.",
        "Heiterkeit–blitheness or repose, and Allgemeinheit–generality or\nbreadth, are, then, the supreme characteristics of the Hellenic\nideal.  But that generality or breadth has nothing in common with\nthe lax observation, the unlearned thought, the flaccid execution,\nwhich have sometimes claimed superiority in art, on the plea of\nbeing “broad” or “general.”  Hellenic breadth and generality\ncome of a culture minute, severe, constantly renewed, rectifying\nand concentrating its impressions into certain pregnant types.",
        "The basis of all artistic genius lies in the power of conceiving\nhumanity in a new and striking way, of putting a happy world of\nits own creation in place of the meaner world of our common\ndays, generating around itself an atmosphere with a novel power\nof refraction, selecting, transforming, recombining the images it\ntransmits, according to [214] the choice of the imaginative\nintellect.  In exercising this power, painting and poetry have a\nvariety of subject almost unlimited.  The range of characters or\npersons open to them is as various as life itself; no character,\nhowever trivial, misshapen, or unlovely, can resist their magic.\nThat is because those arts can accomplish their function in the\nchoice and development of some special situation, which lifts or\nglorifies a character, in itself not poetical.  To realise this\nsituation, to define, in a chill and empty atmosphere, the focus\nwhere rays, in themselves pale and impotent, unite and begin to\nburn, the artist may have, indeed, to employ the most cunning\ndetail, to complicate and refine upon thought and passion a\nthousand-fold.  Let us take a brilliant example from the poems of\nRobert Browning.  His poetry is pre-eminently the poetry of\nsituations.  The characters themselves are always of secondary\nimportance; often they are characters in themselves of little\ninterest; they seem to come to him by strange accidents from the\nends of the world.  His gift is shown by the way in which he\naccepts such a character, throws it into some situation, or\napprehends it in some delicate pause of life, in which for a\nmoment it becomes ideal.  In the poem entitled Le Byron de nos\nJours, in his Dramatis Personae, we have a single moment of\npassion thrown into relief after this exquisite fashion.  Those two\njaded Parisians are not intrinsically interesting: they begin to\ninterest us only [215] when thrown into a choice situation.  But to\ndiscriminate that moment, to make it appreciable by us, that we\nmay “find” it, what a cobweb of allusions, what double and treble\nreflexions of the mind upon itself, what an artificial light is\nconstructed and broken over the chosen situation; on how fine a\nneedle’s point that little world of passion is balanced!  Yet, in\nspite of this intricacy, the poem has the clear ring of a central\nmotive.  We receive from it the impression of one imaginative\ntone, of a single creative act.",
        "To produce such effects at all requires all the resources of\npainting, with its power of indirect expression, of subordinate but\nsignificant detail, its atmosphere, its foregrounds and\nbackgrounds. To produce them in a pre-eminent degree requires\nall the resources of poetry, language in its most purged form, its\nremote associations and suggestions, its double and treble lights.\nThese appliances sculpture cannot command.  In it, therefore, not\nthe special situation, but the type, the general character of the\nsubject to be delineated, is all-important.  In poetry and painting,\nthe situation predominates over the character; in sculpture, the\ncharacter over the situation.  Excluded by the proper limitation of\nits material from the development of exquisite situations, it has to\nchoose from a select number of types intrinsically interesting–\ninteresting, that is, independently of any special situation into\nwhich they may be thrown.  Sculpture [216] finds the secret of its\npower in presenting these types, in their broad, central, incisive\nlines.  This it effects not by accumulation of detail, but by\nabstracting from it.  All that is accidental, all that distracts the\nsimple effect upon us of the supreme types of humanity, all traces\nin them of the commonness of the world, it gradually purges\naway.",
        "Works of art produced under this law, and only these, are really\ncharacterised by Hellenic generality or breadth.  In every\ndirection it is a law of restraint.  It keeps passion always below\nthat degree of intensity at which it must necessarily be transitory,\nnever winding up the features to one note of anger, or desire, or\nsurprise.  In some of the feebler allegorical designs of the middle\nage, we find isolated qualities portrayed as by so many masks; its\nreligious art has familiarised us with faces fixed immovably into\nblank types of placid reverie.  Men and women, again, in the\nhurry of life, often wear the sharp impress of one absorbing\nmotive, from which it is said death sets their features free.  All\nsuch instances may be ranged under the grotesque; and the\nHellenic ideal has nothing in common with the grotesque.  It\nallows passion to play lightly over the surface of the individual\nform, losing thereby nothing of its central impassivity, its depth\nand repose.  To all but the highest culture, the reserved faces of\nthe gods will ever have something of insipidity.",
        "[217] Again, in the best Greek sculpture, the archaic immobility\nhas been stirred, its forms are in motion; but it is a motion ever\nkept in reserve, and very seldom committed to any definite\naction.  Endless as are the attitudes of Greek sculpture, exquisite\nas is the invention of the Greeks in this direction, the actions or\nsituations it permits are simple and few.  There is no Greek\nMadonna; the goddesses are always childless.  The actions\nselected are those which would be without significance, except in\na divine person–binding on a sandal or preparing for the bath.\nWhen a more complex and significant action is permitted, it is\nmost often represented as just finished, so that eager expectancy\nis excluded, as in the image of Apollo just after the slaughter of\nthe Python, or of Venus with the apple of Paris already in her\nhand.  The Laocoon, with all that patient science through which it\nhas triumphed over an almost unmanageable subject, marks a\nperiod in which sculpture has begun to aim at effects legitimate,\nbecause delightful, only in painting.",
        "The hair, so rich a source of expression in painting, because,\nrelatively to the eye or the lip, it is mere drapery, is withdrawn\nfrom attention; its texture, as well as its colour, is lost, its\narrangement but faintly and severely indicated, with no broken or\nenmeshed light.  The eyes are wide and directionless, not fixing\nanything with their gaze, nor riveting the brain to any special\n[218] external object, the brows without hair.  Again, Greek\nsculpture deals almost exclusively with youth, where the\nmoulding of the bodily organs is still as if suspended between\ngrowth and completion, indicated but not emphasised; where the\ntransition from curve to curve is so delicate and elusive, that\nWinckelmann compares it to a quiet sea, which, although we\nunderstand it to be in motion, we nevertheless regard as an image\nof repose; where, therefore, the exact degree of development is so\nhard to apprehend.  If a single product only of Hellenic art were\nto be saved in the wreck of all beside, one might choose perhaps\nfrom the “beautiful multitude” of the Panathenaic frieze, that line\nof youths on horseback, with their level glances, their proud,\npatient lips, their chastened reins, their whole bodies in exquisite\nservice.  This colourless, unclassified purity of life, with its\nblending and interpenetration of intellectual, spiritual, and\nphysical elements, still folded together, pregnant with the\npossibilities of a whole world closed within it, is the highest\nexpression of the indifference which lies beyond all that is\nrelative or partial.  Everywhere there is the effect of an awaking,\nof a child’s sleep just disturbed.  All these effects are united in a\nsingle instance–the adorante of the museum of Berlin, a youth\nwho has gained the wrestler’s prize, with hands lifted and open,\nin praise for the victory.  Fresh, unperplexed, it is the image of a\nman as he springs first from the sleep of nature, his white light\n[219] taking no colour from any one-sided experience.  He is\ncharacterless, so far as character involves subjection to the\naccidental influences of life.",
        "“This sense,” says Hegel, “for the consummate modelling of\ndivine and human forms was pre-eminently at home in Greece.\nIn its poets and orators, its historians and philosophers, Greece\ncannot be conceived from a central point, unless one brings, as a\nkey to the understanding of it, an insight into the ideal forms of\nsculpture, and regards the images of statesmen and philosophers,\nas well as epic and dramatic heroes, from the artistic point of\nview.  For those who act, as well as those who create and think,\nhave, in those beautiful days of Greece, this plastic character.\nThey are great and free, and have grown up on the soil of their\nown individuality, creating themselves out of themselves, and\nmoulding themselves to what they were, and willed to be.  The\nage of Pericles was rich in such characters; Pericles himself,\nPheidias, Plato, above all Sophocles, Thucydides also, Xenophon\nand Socrates, each in his own order, the perfection of one\nremaining undiminished by that of the others.  They are ideal\nartists of themselves, cast each in one flawless mould, works of\nart, which stand before us as an immortal presentment of the\ngods.  Of this modelling also are those bodily works of art, the\nvictors in the Olympic games; yes! and even Phryne, who, as the\nmost beautiful of women, [220] ascended naked out of the water,\nin the presence of assembled Greece.”",
        "This key to the understanding of the Greek spirit, Winckelmann\npossessed in his own nature, itself like a relic of classical\nantiquity, laid open by accident to our alien, modern atmosphere.\nTo the criticism of that consummate Greek modelling he brought\nnot only his culture but his temperament.  We have seen how\ndefinite was the leading motive of that culture; how, like some\ncentral root-fibre, it maintained the well-rounded unity of his life\nthrough a thousand distractions.  Interests not his, nor meant for\nhim, never disturbed him.  In morals, as in criticism, he followed\nthe clue of instinct, of an unerring instinct.  Penetrating into the\nantique world by his passion, his temperament, he enunciated no\nformal principles, always hard and one-sided.  Minute and\nanxious as his culture was, he never became one-sidedly self-\nanalytical.  Occupied ever with himself, perfecting himself and\ndeveloping his genius, he was not content, as so often happens\nwith such natures, that the atmosphere between him and other\nminds should be thick and clouded; he was ever jealously\nrefining his meaning into a form, express, clear, objective.  This\ntemperament he nurtured and invigorated by friendships which\nkept him always in direct contact with the spirit of youth.  The\nbeauty of the Greek statues was a sexless beauty: the statues of\nthe gods had the least traces of sex. [221] Here there is a moral\nsexlessness, a kind of ineffectual wholeness of nature, yet with a\ntrue beauty and significance of its own.",
        "One result of this temperament is a serenity–Heiterkeit–which\ncharacterises Winckelmann’s handling of the sensuous side of\nGreek art.  This serenity is, perhaps, in great measure, a negative\nquality: it is the absence of any sense of want, or corruption, or\nshame.  With the sensuous element in Greek art he deals in the\npagan manner; and what is implied in that?  It has been\nsometimes said that art is a means of escape from “the tyranny of\nthe senses.”  It may be so for the spectator: he may find that the\nspectacle of supreme works of art takes from the life of the senses\nsomething of its turbid fever.  But this is possible for the\nspectator only because the artist, in producing those works, has\ngradually sunk his intellectual and spiritual ideas in sensuous\nform.  He may live, as Keats lived, a pure life; but his soul, like\nthat of Plato’s false astronomer, becomes more and more\nimmersed in sense, until nothing which lacks the appeal to sense\nhas interest for him.  How could such an one ever again endure\nthe greyness of the ideal or spiritual world?  The spiritualist is\nsatisfied as he watches the escape of the sensuous elements from\nhis conceptions; his interest grows, as the dyed garment bleaches\nin the keener air.  But the artist steeps his thought again and again\ninto the fire of colour.  To the Greek this immersion in [222] the\nsensuous was, religiously, at least, indifferent.  Greek\nsensuousness, therefore, does not fever the conscience: it is\nshameless and childlike.  Christian asceticism, on the other hand,\ndiscrediting the slightest touch of sense, has from time to time\nprovoked into strong emphasis the contrast or antagonism to\nitself, of the artistic life, with its inevitable sensuousness.–I did\nbut taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine\nhand, and lo! I must die.–It has sometimes seemed hard to\npursue that life without something of conscious disavowal of a\nspiritual world; and this imparts to genuine artistic interests a\nkind of intoxication.  From this intoxication Winckelmann is free:\nhe fingers those pagan marbles with unsinged hands, with no\nsense of shame or loss.  That is to deal with the sensuous side of\nart in the pagan manner.",
        "The longer we contemplate that Hellenic ideal, in which man is at\nunity with himself, with his physical nature, with the outward\nworld, the more we may be inclined to regret that he should ever\nhave passed beyond it, to contend for a perfection that makes the\nblood turbid, and frets the flesh, and discredits the actual world\nabout us.  But if he was to be saved from the ennui which ever\nattaches itself to realisation, even the realisation of the perfect\nlife, it was necessary that a conflict should come, that some\nsharper note should grieve the existing harmony, and the spirit\nchafed by it beat out at last only a larger and profounder music.\n[223] In Greek tragedy this conflict has begun: man finds himself\nface to face with rival claims.  Greek tragedy shows how such a\nconflict may be treated with serenity, how the evolution of it may\nbe a spectacle of the dignity, not of the impotence, of the human\nspirit.  But it is not only in tragedy that the Greek spirit showed\nitself capable of thus bringing joy out of matter in itself full of\ndiscouragements.  Theocritus too strikes often a note of romantic\nsadness.  But what a blithe and steady poise, above these\ndiscouragements, in a clear and sunny stratum of the air!",
        "Into this stage of Greek achievement Winckelmann did not enter.\nSupreme as he is where his true interest lay, his insight into the\ntypical unity and repose of the highest sort of sculpture seems to\nhave involved limitation in another direction.  His conception of\nart excludes that bolder type of it which deals confidently and\nserenely with life, conflict, evil.  Living in a world of exquisite\nbut abstract and colourless form, he could hardly have conceived\nof the subtle and penetrative, yet somewhat grotesque art of the\nmodern world.  What would he have thought of Gilliatt, in Victor\nHugo’s Travailleurs de la Mer, or of the bleeding mouth of\nFantine in the first part of Les Miserables, penetrated as those\nbooks are with a sense of beauty, as lively and transparent as that\nof a Greek?  Nay, a sort of preparation for the romantic temper is\nnoticeable even within the limits of the Greek ideal itself, [224]\nwhich for his part Winckelmann failed to see.  For Greek religion\nhas not merely its mournful mysteries of Adonis, of Hyacinthus,\nof Demeter, but it is conscious also of the fall of earlier divine\ndynasties.  Hyperion gives way to Apollo, Oceanus to Poseidon.\nAround the feet of that tranquil Olympian family still crowd the\nweary shadows of an earlier, more formless, divine world.  The\nplacid minds even of Olympian gods are troubled with thoughts\nof a limit to duration, of inevitable decay, of dispossession.\nAgain, the supreme and colourless abstraction of those divine\nforms, which is the secret of their repose, is also a premonition of\nthe fleshless, consumptive refinements of the pale, medieval\nartists.  That high indifference to the outward, that impassivity,\nhas already a touch of the corpse in it: we see already Angelico\nand the Master of the Passion in the artistic future.  The\nsuppression of the sensuous, the shutting of the door upon it, the\nascetic interest, may be even now foreseen.  Those abstracted\ngods, “ready to melt out their essence fine into the winds,” who\ncan fold up their flesh as a garment, and still remain themselves,\nseem already to feel that bleak air, in which like Helen of Troy,\nthey wander as the spectres of the middle age.",
        "Gradually, as the world came into the church, an artistic interest,\nnative in the human soul, reasserted its claims.  But Christian art\nwas still dependent on pagan examples, building the [225] shafts\nof pagan temples into its churches, perpetuating the form of the\nbasilica, in later times working the disused amphitheatres as\nstone quarries.  The sensuous expression of ideas which\nunreservedly discredit the world of sense, was the delicate\nproblem which Christian art had before it.  If we think of\nmedieval painting, as it ranges from the early German schools,\nstill with something of the air of the charnel-house about them, to\nthe clear loveliness of Perugino, we shall see how that problem\nwas solved.  In the very “worship of sorrow” the native blitheness\nof art asserted itself.  The religious spirit, as Hegel says, “smiled\nthrough its tears.”  So perfectly did the young Raphael infuse that\nHeiterkeit, that pagan blitheness, into religious works, that his\npicture of Saint Agatha at Bologna became to Goethe a step in\nthe evolution of Iphigenie.*  But in proportion as the gift of\nsmiling was found once more, there came also an aspiration\ntowards that lost antique art, some relics of which Christian art\nhad buried in itself, ready to work wonders when their day came.",
        "The history of art has suffered as much as any history by\ntrenchant and absolute divisions.  Pagan and Christian art are\nsometimes harshly opposed, and the Renaissance is represented\nas a fashion which set in at a definite period.  That is the\nsuperficial view: the deeper view is that which preserves the\nidentity of European culture. [226] The two are really continuous;\nand there is a sense in which it may be said that the Renaissance\nwas an uninterrupted effort of the middle age, that it was ever\ntaking place.  When the actual relics of the antique were restored\nto the world, in the view of the Christian ascetic it was as if an\nancient plague-pit had been opened.  All the world took the\ncontagion of the life of nature and of the senses.  And now it was\nseen that the medieval spirit too had done something for the new\nfortunes of the antique.  By hastening the decline of art, by\nwithdrawing interest from it and yet keeping unbroken the thread\nof its traditions, it had suffered the human mind to repose itself,\nthat when day came it might awake, with eyes refreshed, to those\nancient, ideal forms.",
        "The aim of a right criticism is to place Winckelmann in an\nintellectual perspective, of which Goethe is the foreground.  For,\nafter all, he is infinitely less than Goethe; and it is chiefly because\nat certain points he comes in contact with Goethe, that criticism\nentertains consideration of him.  His relation to modern culture is\na peculiar one.  He is not of the modern world; nor is he wholly\nof the eighteenth century, although so much of his outer life is\ncharacteristic of it.  But that note of revolt against the eighteenth\ncentury, which we detect in Goethe, was struck by Winckelmann.\nGoethe illustrates a union of the Romantic spirit, in its adventure,\nits variety, its profound subjectivity of soul, with Hellenism,\n[227] in its transparency, its rationality, its desire of beauty–that\nmarriage of Faust and Helena, of which the art of the nineteenth\ncentury is the child, the beautiful lad Euphorion, as Goethe\nconceives him, on the crags, in the “splendour of battle and in\nharness as for victory,” his brows bound with light.*  Goethe\nillustrates, too, the preponderance in this marriage of the Hellenic\nelement; and that element, in its true essence, was made known to\nhim by Winckelmann.",
        "Breadth, centrality, with blitheness and repose, are the marks of\nHellenic culture.  Is such culture a lost art?  The local, accidental\ncolouring of its own age has passed from it; and the greatness that\nis dead looks greater when every link with what is slight and\nvulgar has been severed.  We can only see it at all in the\nreflected, refined light which a great education creates for us.\nCan we bring down that ideal into the gaudy, perplexed light of\nmodern life?",
        "Certainly, for us of the modern world, with its conflicting claims,\nits entangled interests, distracted by so many sorrows, with many\npreoccupations, so bewildering an experience, the problem of\nunity with ourselves, in blitheness and repose, is far harder than it\nwas for the Greek within the simple terms of antique life.  Yet,\nnot less than ever, the intellect demands completeness, centrality.\nIt is this which Winckelmann imprints on the imagination of\n[228] Goethe, at the beginning of life, in its original and simplest\nform, as in a fragment of Greek art itself, stranded on that\nlittered, indeterminate shore of Germany in the eighteenth\ncentury.  In Winckelmann, this type comes to him, not as in a\nbook or a theory, but more importunately, because in a passionate\nlife, in a personality.  For Goethe, possessing all modern\ninterests, ready to be lost in the perplexed currents of modern\nthought, he defines, in clearest outline, the eternal problem of\nculture–balance, unity with one’s self, consummate Greek\nmodelling.",
        " It could no longer be solved, as in Phryne ascending naked out of\nthe water, by perfection of bodily form, or any joyful union with\nthe external world: the shadows had grown too long, the light too\nsolemn, for that.  It could hardly be solved, as in Pericles or\nPheidias, by the direct exercise of any single talent: amid the\nmanifold claims of our modern intellectual life, that could only\nhave ended in a thin, one-sided growth.  Goethe’s Hellenism was\nof another order, the Allgemeinheit and Heiterkeit, the\ncompleteness and serenity, of a watchful, exigent intellectualism.\nIm Ganzen, Guten, Wahren, resolut zu leben:–is Goethe’s\ndescription of his own higher life; and what is meant by life in\nthe whole–im Ganzen?  It means the life of one for whom, over\nand over again, what was once precious has become indifferent.\nEvery one who aims at the life of culture is met by many forms of\nit, arising out [229] of the intense, laborious, one-sided\ndevelopment of some special talent.  They are the brightest\nenthusiasms the world has to show: and it is not their part to\nweigh the claims which this or that alien form of genius makes\nupon them.  But the proper instinct of self-culture cares not so\nmuch to reap all that those various forms of genius can give, as to\nfind in them its own strength.  The demand of the intellect is to\nfeel itself alive.  It must see into the laws, the operation, the\nintellectual reward of every divided form of culture; but only that\nit may measure the relation between itself and them.  It struggles\nwith those forms till its secret is won from each, and then lets\neach fall back into its place, in the supreme, artistic view of life.\nWith a kind of passionate coldness, such natures rejoice to be\naway from and past their former selves, and above all, they are\njealous of that abandonment to one special gift which really\nlimits their capabilities.  It would have been easy for Goethe,\nwith the gift of a sensuous nature, to let it overgrow him.  It\ncomes easily and naturally, perhaps, to certain “other-worldly\"\nnatures to be even as the Schone Seele, that ideal of gentle\npietism, in Wilhelm Meister: but to the large vision of Goethe,\nthis seemed to be a phase of life that a man might feel all round,\nand leave behind him.  Again, it is easy to indulge the\ncommonplace metaphysical instinct.  But a taste for metaphysics\nmay be one of those things which we must renounce, if we [230]\nmean to mould our lives to artistic perfection.  Philosophy serves\nculture, not by the fancied gift of absolute or transcendental\nknowledge, but by suggesting questions which help one to detect\nthe passion, and strangeness, and dramatic contrasts of life.",
        "But Goethe’s culture did not remain “behind the veil”: it ever\nemerged in the practical functions of art, in actual production.\nFor him the problem came to be:–Can the blitheness and\nuniversality of the antique ideal be communicated to artistic\nproductions, which shall contain the fulness of the experience of\nthe modern world?  We have seen that the development of the\nvarious forms of art has corresponded to the development of the\nthoughts of man concerning humanity, to the growing revelation\nof the mind to itself.  Sculpture corresponds to the unperplexed,\nemphatic outlines of Hellenic humanism; painting to the mystic\ndepth and intricacy of the middle age; music and poetry have\ntheir fortune in the modern world.",
        "Let us understand by poetry all literary production which attains\nthe power of giving pleasure by its form, as distinct from its\nmatter.  Only in this varied literary form can art command that\nwidth, variety, delicacy of resources, which will enable it to deal\nwith the conditions of modern life.  What modern art has to do in\nthe service of culture is so to rearrange the details of modern life,\nso to reflect it, that it may satisfy the spirit. [231] And what does\nthe spirit need in the face of modern life?  The sense of freedom.\nThat naive, rough sense of freedom, which supposes man’s will\nto be limited, if at all, only by a will stronger than his, he can\nnever have again.  The attempt to represent it in art would have\nso little verisimilitude that it would be flat and uninteresting.  The\nchief factor in the thoughts of the modern mind concerning itself\nis the intricacy, the universality of natural law, even in the moral\norder.  For us, necessity is not, as of old, a sort of mythological\npersonage without us, with whom we can do warfare.  It is rather\na magic web woven through and through us, like that magnetic\nsystem of which modern science speaks, penetrating us with a\nnetwork, subtler than our subtlest nerves, yet bearing in it the\ncentral forces of the world.  Can art represent men and women in\nthese bewildering toils so as to give the spirit at least an\nequivalent for the sense of freedom?  Certainly, in Goethe’s\nromances, and even more in the romances of Victor Hugo, we\nhave high examples of modern art dealing thus with modern life,\nregarding that life as the modern mind must regard it, yet\nreflecting upon it blitheness and repose.  Natural laws we shall\nnever modify, embarrass us as they may; but there is still\nsomething in the nobler or less noble attitude with which we\nwatch their fatal combinations.  In those romances of Goethe and\nVictor Hugo, in some excellent work done after them, this [232]\nentanglement, this network of law, becomes the tragic situation,\nin which certain groups of noble men and women work out for\nthemselves a supreme Denouement.  Who, if he saw through all,\nwould fret against the chain of circumstance which endows one at\nthe end with those great experiences?",

        "[233] TO regard all things and principles of things as inconstant\nmodes or fashions has more and more become the tendency of modern\nthought.  Let us begin with that which is without–our physical\nlife.  Fix upon it in one of its more exquisite intervals, the\nmoment, for instance, of delicious recoil from the flood of water\nin summer heat.  What is the whole physical life in that moment\nbut a combination of natural elements to which science gives\ntheir names?  But those elements, phosphorus and lime and\ndelicate fibres, are present not in the human body alone: we\ndetect them in places most remote from it.  Our physical life is a\nperpetual motion of them–the passage of the blood, the waste\nand repairing of the lenses of the eye, [234] the modification of\nthe tissues of the brain under every ray of light and sound–\nprocesses which science reduces to simpler and more elementary\nforces.  Like the elements of which we are composed, the action\nof these forces extends beyond us: it rusts iron and ripens corn.\nFar out on every side of us those elements are broadcast, driven\nin many currents; and birth and gesture and death and the\nspringing of violets from the grave are but a few out of ten\nthousand resultant combinations.  That clear, perpetual outline of\nface and limb is but an image of ours, under which we group\nthem–a design in a web, the actual threads of which pass out\nbeyond it.  This at least of flamelike our life has, that it is but the\nconcurrence, renewed from moment to moment, of forces parting\nsooner or later on their ways.",
        "Or if we begin with the inward world of thought and feeling, the\nwhirlpool is still more rapid, the flame more eager and devouring.\nThere it is no longer the gradual darkening of the eye, the gradual\nfading of colour from the wall–movements of the shore-side,\nwhere the water flows down indeed, though in apparent rest–but\nthe race of the mid-stream, a drift of momentary acts of sight and\npassion and thought.  At first sight experience seems to bury us\nunder a flood of external objects, pressing upon us with a sharp\nand importunate reality, calling us out of ourselves in a thousand\nforms of action.  But when [235] reflexion begins to play upon\nthese objects they are dissipated under its influence; the cohesive\nforce seems suspended like some trick of magic; each object is\nloosed into a group of impressions–colour, odour, texture–in the\nmind of the observer.  And if we continue to dwell in thought on\nthis world, not of objects in the solidity with which language\ninvests them, but of impressions, unstable, flickering,\ninconsistent, which burn and are extinguished with our\nconsciousness of them, it contracts still further: the whole scope\nof observation is dwarfed into the narrow chamber of the\nindividual mind.  Experience, already reduced to a group of\nimpressions, is ringed round for each one of us by that thick wall\nof personality through which no real voice has ever pierced on its\nway to us, or from us to that which we can only conjecture to be\nwithout.  Every one of those impressions is the impression of the\nindividual in his isolation, each mind keeping as a solitary\nprisoner its own dream of a world.  Analysis goes a step farther\nstill, and assures us that those impressions of the individual mind\nto which, for each one of us, experience dwindles down, are in\nperpetual flight; that each of them is limited by time, and that as\ntime is infinitely divisible, each of them is infinitely divisible\nalso; all that is actual in it being a single moment, gone while we\ntry to apprehend it, of which it may ever be more truly said that it\nhas ceased to be than that it is.  [236] To such a tremulous wisp\nconstantly re-forming itself on the stream, to a single sharp\nimpression, with a sense in it, a relic more or less fleeting, of\nsuch moments gone by, what is real in our life fines itself down.\nIt is with this movement, with the passage and dissolution of\nimpressions, images, sensations, that analysis leaves off–that\ncontinual vanishing away, that strange, perpetual weaving and\nunweaving of ourselves.",
        "Philosophiren, says Novalis, ist dephlegmatisiren, vivificiren.+\nThe service of philosophy, of speculative culture, towards the\nhuman spirit, is to rouse, to startle it to a life of constant and\neager observation.  Every moment some form grows perfect in\nhand or face; some tone on the hills or the sea is choicer than the\nrest; some mood of passion or insight or intellectual excitement is\nirresistibly real and attractive to us,–for that moment only.  Not\nthe fruit of experience, but experience itself, is the end.  A\ncounted number of pulses only is given to us of a variegated,\ndramatic life.  How may we see in them all that is to seen in them\nby the finest senses?  How shall we pass most swiftly from point\nto point, and be present always at the focus where the greatest\nnumber of vital forces unite in their purest energy?",
        "To burn always with this hard, gemlike flame, to maintain this\necstasy, is success in life.  In a sense it might even be said that\nour failure is to form habits: for, after all, habit is relative to a\n[237] stereotyped world, and meantime it is only the roughness of\nthe eye that makes any two persons, things, situations, seem\nalike.  While all melts under our feet, we may well grasp at any\nexquisite passion, or any contribution to knowledge that seems by\na lifted horizon to set the spirit free for a moment, or any stirring\nof the senses, strange dyes, strange colours, and curious odours,\nor work of the artist’s hands, or the face of one’s friend.  Not to\ndiscriminate every moment some passionate attitude in those\nabout us, and in the very brilliancy of their gifts some tragic\ndividing of forces on their ways, is, on this short day of frost and\nsun, to sleep before evening.  With this sense of the splendour of\nour experience and of its awful brevity, gathering all we are into\none desperate effort to see and touch, we shall hardly have time\nto make theories about the things we see and touch.  What we\nhave to do is to be for ever curiously testing new opinions and\ncourting new impressions, never acquiescing in a facile\northodoxy of Comte, or of Hegel, or of our own.  Philosophical\ntheories or ideas, as points of view, instruments of criticism, may\nhelp us to gather up what might otherwise pass unregarded by us.\n\"Philosophy is the microscope of thought.”  The theory or idea or\nsystem which requires of us the sacrifice of any part of this\nexperience, in consideration of some interest into which we\ncannot enter, or some abstract theory we have not identified with\nourselves, [238] or of what is only conventional, has no real\nclaim upon us.",
        "One of the most beautiful passages of Rousseau is that in the\nsixth book of the Confessions, where he describes the awakening\nin him of the literary sense.  An undefinable taint of death had\nclung always about him, and now in early manhood he believed\nhimself smitten by mortal disease.  He asked himself how he\nmight make as much as possible of the interval that remained;\nand he was not biassed by anything in his previous life when he\ndecided that it must be by intellectual excitement, which he found\njust then in the clear, fresh writings of Voltaire.  Well!  we are all\ncondamnes, as Victor Hugo says: we are all under sentence of\ndeath but with a sort of indefinite reprieve–les hommes sont tous\ncondamnes a mort avec des sursis indefinis: we have an interval,\nand then our place knows us no more.  Some spend this interval\nin listlessness, some in high passions, the wisest, at least among\n\"the children of this world,” in art and song.  For our one chance\nlies in expanding that interval, in getting as many pulsations as\npossible into the given time.  Great passions may give us this\nquickened sense of life, ecstasy and sorrow of love, the various\nforms of enthusiastic activity, disinterested or otherwise, which\ncome naturally to many of us.  Only be sure it is passion–that it\ndoes yield you this fruit of a quickened, multiplied\nconsciousness. [239] Of such wisdom, the poetic passion, the\ndesire of beauty, the love of art for its own sake, has most.  For\nart comes to you proposing frankly to give nothing but the\nhighest quality to your moments as they pass, and simply for\nthose moments’ sake.",
