        "London was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several\nmonths in this wonderful and celebrated city.  Clerval desired the\nintercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this\ntime, but this was with me a secondary object; I was principally\noccupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the\ncompletion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of\nintroduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the most\ndistinguished natural philosophers.",
        "If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness,\nit would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure.  But a blight had\ncome over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of\nthe information they might give me on the subject in which my interest\nwas so terribly profound.  Company was irksome to me; when alone, I\ncould fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of\nHenry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory\npeace.  But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to\nmy heart.  I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my\nfellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and\nJustine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled\nmy soul with anguish.",
        "But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive\nand anxious to gain experience and instruction.  The difference of\nmanners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of\ninstruction and amusement.  He was also pursuing an object he had long\nhad in view.  His design was to visit India, in the belief that he had\nin his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had\ntaken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of\nEuropean colonization and trade.  In Britain only could he further the\nexecution of his plan.  He was forever busy, and the only check to his\nenjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind.  I tried to conceal this\nas much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures\nnatural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by\nany care or bitter recollection.  I often refused to accompany him,\nalleging another engagement, that I might remain alone.  I now also\nbegan to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this\nwas to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling\non the head.  Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme\nanguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips\nto quiver, and my heart to palpitate.",
        "After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person\nin Scotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva.  He mentioned\nthe beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not\nsufficient allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north\nas Perth, where he resided.  Clerval eagerly desired to accept this\ninvitation, and I, although I abhorred society, wished to view again\nmountains and streams and all the wondrous works with which Nature\nadorns her chosen dwelling-places.  We had arrived in England at the\nbeginning of October, and it was now February.  We accordingly\ndetermined to commence our journey towards the north at the expiration\nof another month.  In this expedition we did not intend to follow the\ngreat road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford, Matlock, and the\nCumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of this tour\nabout the end of July.  I packed up my chemical instruments and the\nmaterials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some\nobscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.",
        "We quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days at\nWindsor, rambling in its beautiful forest.  This was a new scene to us\nmountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of\nstately deer were all novelties to us.",
        "From thence we proceeded to Oxford.  As we entered this city our minds\nwere filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted\nthere more than a century and a half before.  It was here that Charles\nI had collected his forces.  This city had remained faithful to him,\nafter the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of\nParliament and liberty.  The memory of that unfortunate king and his\ncompanions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and\nson, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they\nmight be supposed to have inhabited.  The spirit of elder days found a\ndwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps.  If these\nfeelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of\nthe city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration.\nThe colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost\nmagnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows\nof exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters,\nwhich reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and\ndomes, embosomed among aged trees.",
        "I enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the\nmemory of the past and the anticipation of the future.  I was formed\nfor peaceful happiness.  During my youthful days discontent never\nvisited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by ennui, the sight of what\nis beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in\nthe productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate\nelasticity to my spirits.  But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has\nentered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what\nI shall soon cease to be–a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity,\npitiable to others and intolerable to myself.",
        "We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs\nand endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most\nanimating epoch of English history.  Our little voyages of discovery\nwere often prolonged by the successive objects that presented\nthemselves.  We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the\nfield on which that patriot fell.  For a moment my soul was elevated\nfrom its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas\nof liberty and self sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments\nand the remembrancers.  For an instant I dared to shake off my chains\nand look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten\ninto my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my\nmiserable self.",
        "We left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next\nplace of rest.  The country in the neighbourhood of this village\nresembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but\neverything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of\ndistant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my\nnative country.  We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets\nof natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same\nmanner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix.  The latter name\nmade me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit\nMatlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.",
        "From Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in\nCumberland and Westmorland.  I could now almost fancy myself among the\nSwiss mountains.  The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the\nnorthern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the\nrocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me.  Here also we\nmade some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into\nhappiness.  The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than\nmine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found\nin his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have\nimagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his\ninferiors.  “I could pass my life here,” said he to me; “and among\nthese mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine.”",
        "But he found that a traveller’s life is one that includes much pain\namidst its enjoyments.  His feelings are forever on the stretch; and\nwhen he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit\nthat on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again\nengages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.",
        "We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland\nand conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period\nof our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them\nto travel on.  For my own part I was not sorry.  I had now neglected my\npromise for some time, and I feared the effects of the daemon’s\ndisappointment.  He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance\non my relatives.  This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment\nfrom which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace.  I waited\nfor my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was\nmiserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I\nsaw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to\nread and ascertain my fate.  Sometimes I thought that the fiend\nfollowed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my\ncompanion.  When these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry\nfor a moment, but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the\nfancied rage of his destroyer.  I felt as if I had committed some great\ncrime, the consciousness of which haunted me.  I was guiltless, but I\nhad indeed drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that\nof crime.",
        "I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might\nhave interested the most unfortunate being.  Clerval did not like it so\nwell as Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing\nto him.  But the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh,\nits romantic castle and its environs, the most delightful in the world,\nArthur’s Seat, St. Bernard’s Well, and the Pentland Hills compensated\nhim for the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. But\nI was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.",
        "We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew’s, and\nalong the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us.\nBut I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into\ntheir feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and\naccordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland\nalone.  “Do you,” said I, “enjoy yourself, and let this be our\nrendezvous.  I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with\nmy motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short\ntime; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more\ncongenial to your own temper.”",
        "Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to\nremonstrate.  He entreated me to write often.  “I had rather be with\nyou,” he said, “in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch\npeople, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear  friend, to return,\nthat I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in\nyour absence.”",
        "Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of\nScotland and finish my work in solitude.  I did not doubt but that the\nmonster followed me and would discover himself to me when I should have\nfinished, that he might receive his companion.  With this resolution I\ntraversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of the remotest of\nthe Orkneys as the scene of my labours.  It was a place fitted for such\na work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were continually\nbeaten upon by the waves.  The soil was barren, scarcely affording\npasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its inhabitants,\nwhich consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave\ntokens of their miserable fare.  Vegetables and bread, when they\nindulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured\nfrom the mainland, which was about five miles distant.",
        "On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of\nthese was vacant when I arrived.  This I hired.  It contained but two\nrooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable\npenury.  The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the\ndoor was off its hinges.  I ordered it to be repaired, bought some\nfurniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have\noccasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been\nbenumbed by want and squalid poverty.  As it was, I lived ungazed at\nand unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes\nwhich I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations\nof men.",
        "In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening,\nwhen the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea to\nlisten to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet.  It was a\nmonotonous yet ever-changing scene.  I thought of Switzerland; it was\nfar different from this desolate and appalling landscape.  Its hills\nare covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the\nplains.  Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when\ntroubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively\ninfant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean.",
        "In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but\nas I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and\nirksome to me.  Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my\nlaboratory for several days, and at other times I toiled day and night\nin order to complete my work.  It was, indeed, a filthy process in\nwhich I was engaged.  During my first experiment, a kind of\nenthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my\nmind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes\nwere shut to the horror of my proceedings.  But now I went to it in\ncold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands.",
        "Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in\na solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from\nthe actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I\ngrew restless and nervous.  Every moment I feared to meet my\npersecutor.  Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing\nto raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so much\ndreaded to behold.  I feared to wander from the sight of my fellow\ncreatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion.",
        "In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably\nadvanced.  I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager\nhope, which I dared not trust myself to question but which was\nintermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken\nin my bosom.",
