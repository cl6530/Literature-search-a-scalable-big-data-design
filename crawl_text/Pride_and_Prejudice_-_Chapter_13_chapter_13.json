        "“I hope, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were\nat breakfast the next morning, “that you have ordered a good\ndinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to\nour family party.”",
        "“Who do you mean, my dear?  I know of nobody that is coming,\nI am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in–and\nI hope my dinners are good enough for her.  I do not believe\nshe often sees such at home.”",
        "“The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.”",
        "Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled.  “A gentleman and a stranger!  It is\nMr. Bingley, I am sure!  Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad\nto see Mr. Bingley.  But–good Lord! how unlucky!  There is not\na bit of fish to be got to-day.  Lydia, my love, ring the bell–I\nmust speak to Hill this moment.”",
        "“It is not Mr. Bingley,” said her husband; “it is a person whom\nI never saw in the whole course of my life.”",
        "This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of\nbeing eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at\nonce.",
        "After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus\nexplained:",
        "“About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight\nago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and\nrequiring early attention.  It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who,\nwhen I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he\npleases.”",
        "“Oh! my dear,” cried his wife, “I cannot bear to hear that\nmentioned.  Pray do not talk of that odious man.  I do think it is\nthe hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed\naway from your own children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I\nshould have tried long ago to do something or other about it.”",
        "Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail.\nThey had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject\non which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she\ncontinued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an\nestate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man\nwhom nobody cared anything about.",
        "“It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,” said Mr. Bennet,\n“and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting\nLongbourn.  But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps\nbe a little softened by his manner of expressing himself.”",
        "“No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent\nof him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.  I hate such\nfalse friends.  Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as\nhis father did before him?”",
        "“Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on\nthat head, as you will hear.”",
        "“Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent,\n15th October.",
        "“Dear Sir,–",
        "“The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late\nhonoured father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I\nhave had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished\nto heal the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own\ndoubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory\nfor me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always\npleased him to be at variance.–’There, Mrs. Bennet.’–My\nmind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having\nreceived ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to\nbe distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady\nCatherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose\nbounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory\nof this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean\nmyself with grateful respect towards her ladyship, and be ever\nready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted\nby the Church of England.  As a clergyman,  moreover, I feel it\nmy duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all\nfamilies within in the reach of my influence; and on these\ngrounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are highly\ncommendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the\nentail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your\nside, and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch.\nI cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of\ninjuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for\nit, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every\npossible amends–but of this hereafter.  If you should have\nno objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself\nthe satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday,\nNovember 18th, by four o’clock, and shall probably trespass on\nyour hospitality till the Saturday se’ennight following, which I\ncan do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from\nobjecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that\nsome other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.–I\nremain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and\ndaughters, your well-wisher and friend,",
        "“William Collins”",
        "“At four o’clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making\ngentleman,” said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter.  “He\nseems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon\nmy word, and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance,\nespecially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let\nhim come to us again.”",
        "“There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however,\nand if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be\nthe person to discourage him.”",
        "“Though it is difficult,” said Jane, “to guess in what way he can\nmean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is\ncertainly to his credit.”",
        "Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for\nLady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying,\nand burying his parishioners whenever it were required.",
        "“He must be an oddity, I think,” said she.  “I cannot make him\nout.–There is something very pompous in his style.–And what\ncan he mean by apologising for being next in the entail?–We\ncannot suppose he would help it if he could.–Could he be a\nsensible man, sir?”",
        "“No, my dear, I think not.  I have great hopes of finding him\nquite the reverse.  There is a mixture of servility and\nself-importance in his letter, which promises well.  I am\nimpatient to see him.”",
        "“In point of composition,” said Mary, “the letter does not seem\ndefective.  The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly\nnew, yet I think it is well expressed.”",
        "To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were\nin any degree interesting.  It was next to impossible that their\ncousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some\nweeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a\nman in any other colour.  As for their mother, Mr. Collins’s\nletter had done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing\nto see him with a degree of composure which astonished her\nhusband and daughters.",
        "Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with\ngreat politeness by the whole family.  Mr. Bennet indeed said\nlittle; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins\nseemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be\nsilent himself.  He was a tall, heavy-looking young man of\nfive-and-twenty.  His air was grave and stately, and his\nmanners were very formal.  He had not been long seated before\nhe complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of\ndaughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in\nthis instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added,\nthat he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed\nof in marriage.  This gallantry was not much to the taste of\nsome of his hearers; but Mrs. Bennet, who quarreled with no\ncompliments, answered most readily.",
        "“You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it\nmay prove so, for else they will be destitute enough.  Things are\nsettled so oddly.”",
        "“You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.”",
        "“Ah! sir, I do indeed.  It is a grievous affair to my poor girls,\nyou must confess.  Not that I mean to find fault with you, for\nsuch things I know are all chance in this world.  There is no\nknowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed.”",
        "“I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,\nand could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of\nappearing forward and precipitate.  But I can assure the young\nladies that I come prepared to admire them.  At present I will\nnot say more; but, perhaps, when we are better acquainted–”",
        "He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled\non each other.  They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins’s\nadmiration.  The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture,\nwere examined and praised; and his commendation of everything\nwould have touched Mrs. Bennet’s heart, but for the mortifying\nsupposition of his viewing it all as his own future property.\nThe dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to\nknow to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking\nwas owing.  But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who\nassured him with some asperity that they were very well able to\nkeep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in\nthe kitchen.  He begged pardon for having displeased her.  In a\nsoftened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he\ncontinued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour.",
