        "  Pays a visit during the siege of Gibraltar to his old friend\n  General Elliot–Sinks a Spanish man-of-war–Wakes an old woman on\n  the African coast–Destroys all the enemy’s cannon; frightens the\n  Count d’Artois, and sends him to Paris–Saves the lives of two\n  English spies with the identical sling that killed Goliath; and\n  raises the siege.",
        "During the late siege of Gibraltar I went with a provision-fleet,\nunder Lord Rodney’s command, to see my old friend General Elliot, who\nhas, by his distinguished defence of that place, acquired laurels that\ncan never fade. After the usual joy which generally attends the\nmeeting of old friends had subsided, I went to examine the state of\nthe garrison, and view the operations of the enemy, for which purpose\nthe General accompanied me. I had brought a most excellent refracting\ntelescope with me from London, purchased of Dollond, by the help of\nwhich I found the enemy were going to discharge a thirty-six pounder\nat the spot where we stood. I told the General what they were about;\nhe looked through the glass also, and found my conjectures right. I\nimmediately, by his permission, ordered a forty-eight pounder to be\nbrought from a neighbouring battery, which I placed with so much\nexactness (having long studied the art of gunnery) that I was sure of\nmy mark.",
        "I continued watching the enemy till I saw the match placed at the\ntouch-hole of their piece; at that very instant I gave the signal for\nour gun to be fired also.",
        "About midway between the two pieces of cannon the balls struck each\nother with amazing force, and the effect was astonishing! The enemy’s\nball recoiled back with such violence as to kill the man who had\ndischarged it, by carrying his head fairly off, with sixteen others\nwhich it met with in its progress to the Barbary coast, where its\nforce, after passing through three masts of vessels that then lay in a\nline behind each other in the harbour, was so much spent, that it only\nbroke its way through the roof of a poor labourer’s hut, about two\nhundred yards inland, and destroyed a few teeth an old woman had left,\nwho lay asleep upon her back with her mouth open. The ball lodged in\nher throat. Her husband soon after came home, and endeavoured to\nextract it; but finding that impracticable, by the assistance of a\nrammer he forced it into her stomach. Our ball did excellent service;\nfor it not only repelled the other in the manner just described, but,\nproceeding as I intended it should, it dismounted the very piece of\ncannon that had just been employed against us, and forced it into the\nhold of the ship, where it fell with so much force as to break its way\nthrough the bottom. The ship immediately filled and sank, with above a\nthousand Spanish sailors on board, besides a considerable number of\nsoldiers. This, to be sure, was a most extraordinary exploit; I will\nnot, however, take the whole merit to myself; my judgment was the\nprincipal engine, but chance assisted me a little; for I afterwards\nfound, that the man who charged our forty-eight pounder put in, by\nmistake, a double quantity of powder, else we could never have\nsucceeded so much beyond all expectation, especially in repelling the\nenemy’s ball.",
        "General Elliot would have given me a commission for this singular\npiece of service; but I declined everything, except his thanks, which\nI received at a crowded table of officers at supper on the evening of\nthat very day.",
        "As I am very partial to the English, who are beyond all doubt a brave\npeople, I determined not to take my leave of the garrison till I had\nrendered them another piece of service, and in about three weeks an\nopportunity presented itself. I dressed myself in the habit of a\nPopish priest, and at about one o’clock in the morning stole out of\nthe garrison, passed the enemy’s lines, and arrived in the middle of\ntheir camp, where I entered the tent in which the Prince d’Artois was,\nwith the commander-in-chief, and several other officers, in deep\ncouncil, concerting a plan to storm the garrison next morning. My\ndisguise was my protection; they suffered me to continue there,\nhearing everything that passed, till they went to their several beds.\nWhen I found the whole camp, and even the sentinels, were wrapped up\nin the arms of Morpheus, I began my work, which was that of\ndismounting all their cannon (above three hundred pieces), from forty-\neight to twenty-four pounders, and throwing them three leagues into\nthe sea. Having no assistance, I found this the hardest task I ever\nundertook, except swimming to the opposite shore with the famous\nTurkish piece of ordnance, described by Baron de Tott in his Memoirs,\nwhich I shall hereafter mention. I then piled all the carriages\ntogether in the centre of the camp, which, to prevent the noise of the\nwheels being heard, I carried in pairs under my arms; and a noble\nappearance they made, as high at least as the rock of Gibraltar. I\nthen lighted a match by striking a flint stone, situated twenty feet\nfrom the ground (in an old wall built by the Moors when they invaded\nSpain), with the breech of an iron eight-and-forty pounder, and so set\nfire to the whole pile. I forgot to inform you that I threw all their\nammunition-waggons upon the top.",
        "Before I applied the lighted match I had laid the combustibles at the\nbottom so judiciously, that the whole was in a blaze in a moment. To\nprevent suspicion I was one of the first to express my surprise. The\nwhole camp was, as you may imagine, petrified with astonishment: the\ngeneral conclusion was, that their sentinels had been bribed, and that\nseven or eight regiments of the garrison had been employed in this\nhorrid destruction of their artillery. Mr. Drinkwater, in his account\nof this famous siege, mentions the enemy sustaining a great loss by a\nfire which happened in their camp, but never knew the cause; how\nshould he? as I never divulged it before (though I alone saved\nGibraltar by this night’s business), not even to General Elliot. The\nCount d’Artois and all his attendants ran away in their fright, and\nnever stopped on the road till they reached Paris, which they did in\nabout a fortnight; this dreadful conflagration had such an effect upon\nthem that they were incapable of taking the least refreshment for\nthree months after, but, chameleon-like, lived upon the air.",
        "If any gentleman will say he doubts the truth of this story, I will\nfine him a gallon of brandy and make him drink it at one draught.",
        "About two months after I had done the besieged this service, one\nmorning, as I sat at breakfast with General Elliot, a shell (for I had\nnot time to destroy their mortars as well as their cannon) entered the\napartment we were sitting in; it lodged upon our table: the General,\nas most men would do, quitted the room directly; but I took it up\nbefore it burst, and carried it to the top of the rock, when, looking\nover the enemy’s camp, on an eminence near the sea-coast I observed a\nconsiderable number of people, but could not, with my naked eye,\ndiscover how they were employed. I had recourse again to my telescope,\nwhen I found that two of our officers, one a general, the other a\ncolonel, with whom I spent the preceding evening, and who went out\ninto the enemy’s camp about midnight as spies, were taken, and then\nwere actually going to be executed on a gibbet. I found the distance\ntoo great to throw the shell with my hand, but most fortunately\nrecollecting that I had the very sling in my pocket which assisted\nDavid in slaying Goliath, I placed the shell in it, and immediately\nthrew it in the midst of them: it burst as it fell, and destroyed all\npresent, except the two culprits, who were saved by being suspended so\nhigh, for they were just turned off: however, one of the pieces of the\nshell fled with such force against the foot of the gibbet, that it\nimmediately brought it down. Our two friends no sooner felt terra\nfirma than they looked about for the cause; and finding their guards,\nexecutioner, and all, had taken it in their heads to die first, they\ndirectly extricated each other from their disgraceful cords, and then\nran down to the sea-shore, seized a Spanish boat with two men in it,\nand made them row to one of our ships, which they did with great\nsafety, and in a few minutes after, when I was relating to General\nElliot how I had acted, they both took us by the hand, and after\nmutual congratulations we retired to spend the day with festivity.",
