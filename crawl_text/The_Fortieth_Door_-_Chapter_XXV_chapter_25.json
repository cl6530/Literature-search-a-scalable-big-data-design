        "IN CAIRO",
        "“It’s good news!” said Miss Jeffries with bright positives.",
        "It was her response to Andrew McLean’s greeting that evening. He\nhad made rather a tardy appearance at the hotel, for there had\nbeen an important dinner with an important bank official passing\nthrough Cairo to escape from, but he arrived at last, looking\nextraordinarily well in his very best dinner clothes.",
        "And Miss Jeffries, for all her harassment of suspense, was no woeful\nobject in a vivacious blue evening frock with silvery gleams.",
        "“He’s safe–absolutely safe,” McLean confirmed.",
        "He expected radiance. Miss Jeffries’ expression was arrested\njudgment.",
        "“Safe–where?”",
        "“At his camp ... I just returned–just in time to dine. I motored\nout this morning.”",
        "“Oh!... It took your whole day. I am so sorry!” For a moment the\ngirl appeared to concentrate her sympathetic interest upon McLean.",
        "“You must simply hate me,” she told him repentantly, dropping into\none of the chairs in the drawing-room corner she had long been\nguarding. “Do sit down and tell me all the horrid details....–Uncle\nand Aunt are in the Lounge, and I should like you to meet them, but\nthey’ll be there forever and I do want to hear first.... Was it\nfearfully hot?”",
        "“Oh, rather,” murmured the young man, confused by this change of\ninterest. “I mean, that’s quite the usual thing, isn’t it, for\ndeserts? I got up a good breeze going, for I was a bit wrought up,\nyou know–not a soul in Cairo had seen Jack since that day.”",
        "“And he was out at his camp,” said Jinny thoughtfully. “How–how\nlong had he been there?”",
        "“He says he started that night,” said McLean non-committally.",
        "“Oh!... That night.... That was rather sudden, wasn’t it?”",
        "“Jack’s sudden, you know,” mentioned his friend uncomfortably. “And\nhe had a lot of finds to pack up for transport–they are taking\ntheir stuff to the museum and Jack had been away so long, here in\nthe city–”",
        "“No wonder I didn’t hear then!” said the girl with a laugh in which\nit would have taken an acuter ear than McLean’s to detect the secret\nclamor of chagrin and humiliation.",
        "Of course she had wanted Jack to be safe.... But he might have\nbeen ill–or away on some official summons–",
        "Just back at his diggings. Gone off on an impulse, with no thought\nto let her know....",
        "And she had rushed to McLean with her silly worries and her anxious\nconcern which he had probably taken for a tender interest....",
        "Heaven knows what disillusionizing thing Jack had said to him that\nday!... Men were too hateful.",
        "And now McLean had come dutifully to report that the man she was so\nworried about was quite well and busy, thank you, only he had\noverlooked any friendship for her, and so had sent no word–",
        "In Jinny’s ears was the rush of the furies’ wings. But on Jinny’s\nlips was a proud little smile, and her bright look was a shining\nshield for the wounds of the spirit.",
        "“That is a comfort,” she said with pleasant, friendly warmth. “You\ndon’t know how horridly responsible I felt! Really, Jack ought to\nhave let me know–but that’s Jack all over. He’s never grown up.”",
        "“He’s not had much time,” returned McLean from the height of his\ntwenty-nine years.",
        "“He never will,” said Jinny sagely, “not until–well, not until\nhe meets some girl, you know, who will make him feel really\nresponsible.”",
        "It occurred unhappily to McLean that the girl Jack had been meeting\nso assiduously of late had certainly not added to his claims to\nresponsibility!",
        "Steadily he guarded silence. There are ice fields, on Mont Blanc,\nwhere a whisper precipitates an avalanche, and McLean had no\nintention of starting anything in his friend’s slippery field of\naffairs.",
        "“I have spent more time,” Miss Jeffries was confiding brightly, for\nthose imperative reasons of her own so obscure to the bewildered\nyoung man, “introducing Jack to nice girls–but it never takes! Not\nseriously. He’s a perfectly dear friend, but he doesn’t care\nanything really about girls–and he does need somebody to get him\nout of his antiquities and his dusty old diggings ... But of course\nyou think I am a sentimental thing!”",
        "McLean did not tell her what he thought. He was still fascinatedly\nengrossed with her revelation of the impeccable Platonic basis of\nher friendship. His mood of complicated emotion lightened and\nbrightened and at the same time an amazed wonder unfolded its\nastonishment.",
        "He marveled at his friend. To turn to something fantastic, something\nbizarre–for so he thought of that veiled girl of the harem–when he\nhad this Miss Jeffries for a friend–but probably the young lady\nherself had never given him the least encouragement. Women are not\neasily moved to romance for men they have always regarded as\nbrothers and he could see that her feeling for Jack was the warm,\nhonest, sisterly affection of utter frankness.",
        "The worse for Jack. For now there seemed no ministering angel to\nmend his troubled future.",
        "It was not only Ryder’s troubled future that troubled McLean–it\nwas also Ryder’s troubled present. He was very far from easy in his\nmind about him. After that mystifying performance in the tomb he had\nnot wanted to leave without a frank explanation, but there had been\nno moment for revelation; Thatcher had hung about them and Hamdi\nBey, of all men, had requested a place in McLean’s motor for the\nreturn to Cairo.",
        "And that dinner engagement had pressed. He could have abandoned it\nfor any real reason, but Jack had assured him that there was none.",
        "“Get the old devil out of here,” had been Jack’s furious appeal,\nreferring to Hamdi. “Deny everything to him. Only get him out.”",
        "And McLean had got him out.",
        "The sheik and his followers after a murmurous conference with the\nbey had galloped off; the police had turned towards their post and\nHamdi had accompanied McLean to the nearest village and his waiting\nmotor.",
        "Clearly he had wanted to talk to McLean and McLean was not sorry for\nthe opportunity to exchange implications. The bey had unfolded his\nsympathetic friendship for the sheik; McLean had unfolded a cold\nsurprise that anything so disgraceful should be attributed to such a\nprominent archaeologist. The bey had produced the evidence and\nMcLean had produced a skeptical wonder, and then a thoughtful wonder\nif the British government had not better take the matter up and sift\nit, for the benefit of all concerned.",
        "Clearly the thing could not go on. Ryder could not accept such a\nrumor against his reputation. Yes, he thought he would advise Ryder\nto take the matter up.",
        "And there he perceived that even the suave and politic Hamdi\nsquirmed. Doubtless to the Turk, McLean represented British prestige\nand political power and all sorts of unknown influence.... And\nnative testimony, while voluable and unscrupulous, had a way of\noffering confused discrepancies to the coldly questioning\ninvestigators of the law.",
        "And with no real evidence against Ryder–",
        "The matter of the sheik’s daughter, McLean perceived, would be\ndropped. Unless the girl–whatever girl they sought–could be\ndiscovered.",
        "If Hamdi wished to pay off some score against the American he would\nchoose other weapons. McLean reflected upon the bey’s capacity for\nassassination or poisoning while he bade him farewell before the\ndark wall of his palace entrance.",
        "Between them had passed no reference to the bey’s recent loss. Since\nit would not have been etiquette for him to mention the bey’s wife,\nhe judged it equally inadvisable to refer to her ashes.",
        "The whole affair was so wrapped in darkness that he could not decide\nupon any creditable explanation. It would have to wait until he saw\nRyder in the next day or two–for Ryder had told him he would try to\nget in with his finds as soon as possible.",
        "But no matter how he tried to dismiss the matter from his mind he\nhad found himself asking, through the courses of that important\ndinner and now in the pauses of his conversation with Miss\nJeffries–Was there really some girl? Had he only dreamed that tense\nanxiety of Jack’s–had Jack led them on for his own young amusement?",
        "But it was not long possible to maintain an inner communion with\nJinny Jeffries for a vis-à-vis.",
        "A divided mind could not companion her swift flights and sudden\ntangents. Deriding now her silly anxieties and deploring McLean’s\nunnecessary trip, she had branched into the consideration of how\nbusy McLean must be–and McLean found himself somehow embarked in\nsketchy descriptions of the institution of which Miss Jeffries\nseemed to think he was the backbone and of its very interesting work\nthroughout the country.",
        "And as he had talked he found himself noticing things that he had\nnever noticed before about girls, the wave of bright hair against a\nflushed cheek, the dimples in a rounded arm, the slim grace of\ncrossed ankles and silver-slippered feet.",
        "“And you live all alone in that big house?” Jinny was murmuring.",
        "“Not exactly alone.” McLean smiled. “There’s Mohammed and Hassan and\nAbdullah and Alewa and Saord-el-Tawahi–”",
        "“What do you call him when you are in a hurry?” laughed the girl.",
        "It was a tremendously pleasant evening. He had expected constraint\nand secret embarrassment and he had discovered this delightful\ninterest and bright vivacity.",
        "And if beneath that interest and vivacity something lay forever\nstilled and chilled in Miss Jeffries’ breast–like a poor hidden\ncorpse beneath bright roses–why at two and twenty expectancies\nflourish so gayly that one lone bud is not long missed. And chagrin\nis sometimes a salutary transient shower, and self-confidence is all\nthe more delicate for a dimming cloud.",
        "Moreover McLean’s unconscious absorption was balm and blessing.",
        "When in startled realization of time and place he rose at last and\nshe murmured laughing, “And after all you never met Aunt and Uncle!\"\nhe felt a queer blush tingle his cheek bones and a daring impulse\nshape the thought aloud that in that case he must come again.",
        "“We’re here five days more,” said Jinny, the explicit.",
        "Thoughtfully he repeated, “Five days,” and said farewell.",
        "“Now if he decorously waits to the next to the last day–!” murmured\nJinny to herself, her opinion of the Scots race hanging in the\nbalance.",
        "He didn’t. But it was not the initiative of the Scots race which\nbrought him to her, late that very next afternoon, but a soiled\nlooking note which he held crumpled in his hand.",
        "He found her at tea upon the veranda with her aunt and uncle and\nwhile he made conversation with the Pendletons he gave Miss Jeffries\nthe note.",
        "“From our friend Ryder,” he said with forced lightness. “It explains\nitself.”",
        "But it certainly did not. It was a hasty scrawl to McLean, saying\nthat Ryder was on his way with the museum finds and sending this\nahead by runner, and that McLean must positively be at the Cairo\nMuseum to meet him at five and would he please stop on the way and\ncall at his hotel upon a Miss Jeffries and borrow a woman’s cloak\nand hat and veil, or if she wasn’t in, get them elsewhere.",
        "“What is it–another masquerade?” said Jinny blankly.",
        "McLean looked mutely at her and shook his head, but within him\nhorrific suspicion was raging like a forest fire.",
        "He continued his converse with the Pendletons while Jinny went for\nthe things; she returned with a small bag containing coat and hat\nand veil, and the announcement that she would go right over with\nhim.",
        "“If the things aren’t right I’ll know what he wants,” she declared,\nand then, smiling, “What do you suppose he is up to now?”",
        "McLean felt that he didn’t want to know. And most positively he\ndidn’t want her to know. But having lacked the instant inspiration\nto deny her, he could only acquiesce and wonder why he hadn’t\nthought up some brilliant excuse.",
        "He looked helplessly at the Pendletons, but they merely murmured\ntheir adieux and their independent niece accompanied McLean to his\nwaiting carriage as if it were the most natural thing in the world.",
        "The caravan was before them. A long line of camels was just turning\nin the gates and before the steps of a back entrance other camels,\nkneeling with that profound and squealing resentment with which even\nthe camel’s most exhausted moments oppose commands, were being\nrelieved of their huge loads by natives under the very minute and\nexact direction of Thatcher.",
        "And within the entrance a young man with rumpled dark hair and a\nthin, bronzed face flushed with impatience was imperiously conveying\nthe Arabs who were bearing the precious sarcophagi.",
        "Over his shoulder he caught sight of the two arrivals.",
        "“I asked for motors–and they furnished these!” he cried\ndisgustedly, gesturing at the enduring camels. “It took us all day\nthough we half killed the brutes.... Hello, Jinny, did you bring the\nthings?”",
        "With light casualness he accepted her appearance on the scene. That\nglitter in his bright hazel eyes was not for that. “Come in, both\nof you,” he called, plunging after his men.",
        "At the foot of the stairs McLean waited with Miss Jeffries until the\nmen had reached the top and deposited their burdens in the room and\nin the manner which Ryder was specifying so crisply, and then they\ncame mechanically up.",
        "McLean had the automatic feeling of a mere super in a well rehearsed\nscene. He had no idea of plot or appearance but his rôle of dumb\nsubservience was clearly defined.",
        "“You understand,” Ryder was calling to the men, “nothing more goes\nin this room. All else down stairs.... Come in,” he said hurriedly\nto his waiting friends, and shutting the door swiftly behind them,\n“of course–this doesn’t lock!” he muttered. “Jinny, you stand here,\ndo, and if any one tries to come in tell them they can’t.”",
        "“Tell them you say they can’t?” questioned Jinny a little\nhelplessly.",
        "“No–no–not that. Tell them you are using the room; tell them,\"\nsaid Ryder with very brisk and serious inspiration, “tell them your\npetticoat is coming off!”",
        "“Why Jack Ryder!” said Jinny indignantly.",
        "“Nonsense,” said he to her indignation. “Don’t you remember when\nyour aunt’s petticoat came off on the way to church? It happens.”",
        "“But it doesn’t run in families!”",
        "Her protest fell apparently upon the back of his head. He had\nturned to the last sarcophagus and was slipping his fingers beneath\nthe lid. “Here, Andy,” he said quickly. “I had it wedged so it\nwasn’t tight shut, but it’s been so infernally hot and dusty–”",
        "He was tremendously troubled. It was not the heat which had brought\nthose fine beads of moisture to his brow, white above the line of\nbrown, and drawn such a pale ring about his mouth. McLean saw that\nthe slim, wiry wrists which supported the case’s top were shaking.",
        "“Gently now,” he murmured and the lid was lifted and laid aside.",
        "The same dark, unstirring form of the tomb scene. The same dry,\ndusty little mummy.... But with hands strangely reckless for an\narchaeologist dealing with the priceless stuff of time Ryder tore at\nthose bandages; he unwrapped, he unwound, and in a lightning’s\nflash–",
        "To McLean’s tense, expectant nerves it was like a scene at the\npantomime. He had divined it; he had foreseen and yet there was the\nshock and eerie thrill of magic, the appealing unreality of the\nsupernatural in the revelation.",
        "In a wave of an enchanter’s wand the mummy was gone. And in its\nplace lay a Sleeping Beauty, the dark hair in sculptured closeness\nto the head, the long, black lashes sweeping the still cheeks.",
