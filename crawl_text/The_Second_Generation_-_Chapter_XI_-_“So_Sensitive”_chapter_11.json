        "Adelaide was about to go in search of her brother when he came hunting\nher. A good example perhaps excepted, there is no power for good equal to\na bad example. Arthur’s outburst before his mother and her, and in what\nseemed the very presence of the dead, had been almost as potent in\nturning Adelaide from bitterness as the influence her father’s\npersonality, her father’s character had got over her in his last illness.\nAnd now the very sight of her brother’s face, freely expressing his\nthoughts, since Ellen was not there to shame him, gave double force to\nthe feelings her mother’s denunciations had roused in her. “We’ve got to\nfight it, Del,” Arthur said, flinging himself down on the grass at her\nfeet. “I’ll see Torrey to-morrow morning.”",
        "Adelaide was silent.",
        "He looked fiercely at her. “You’re going to help me, aren’t you?”",
        "“I must have time to think,” she replied, bent on not provoking him to\ngreater fury.",
        "He raised himself to a sitting posture. “What has that Hargrave fellow\nbeen saying to you?” he cried. “You’ll have to break off with him. His\nfather–the old scoundrel!–got at father and took advantage of his\nillness and his religious superstition. I know just how it was done.\nWe’ll bring it all out.”",
        "Adelaide did not answer.",
        "“What did Dory say to you?” repeated Arthur.",
        "“He went as soon as I came out from mother,” she replied. She thought it\nbest not to tell him that Dory had stopped long enough to urge her to go\nto her brother, and to make and keep peace with him, no matter what he\nmight say to anger her. “Don’t you think,” she continued, “that you ought\nto see Janet and talk with her?”",
        "Artie sank back and stared somberly at the ground.",
        "“When is she coming?” asked his sister.",
        "“I don’t know,” he answered surlily. “Not at all, perhaps. The Whitneys\nwon’t especially care about having any of us in the family now.” He\nlooked furtively at Adelaide, as if he hoped she would protest that he\nwas mistaken, would show him that Janet would be unchanged.",
        "“Mrs. Whitney won’t,” said Adelaide. “But Janet–she’s different, I\nthink. She seems to be high-minded, and I believe she loves you.”",
        "Arthur looked relieved, though Adelaide was too honest to have been able\nto make her tone as emphatic as her words. Yes, Janet was indeed\nhigh-minded, he said to himself; did indeed love him. Her high-mindedness\nand the angel purity of her love had often made him uneasy, not to say\nuncomfortable. He hated to be at the trouble of pretenses; but Janet,\nliving on a far higher plan than he, had simply compelled it. To let her\nsee his human weaknesses, to let her suspect that he was not as\nhigh-minded as she told him he was, to strip from himself the saintly\nrobes and the diadem with which she had adorned him–well, he would put\nit off until after marriage, he had always told himself, and perhaps by\nthat time he would feel a little less like a sinner profaning a sanctuary\nwhen he kissed her. He had from time to time found in himself a sinful\nlonging that she were just a little less of an angel, just a little more\nof a fellow sinner–not too much, of course, for a man wants a pure wife,\na pure mother for his children. But, while the attitudes of worship and\nof saintliness were cramped, often severely so, still on the whole Arthur\nhad thought he was content with Janet just as she was.",
        "“Why don’t you go to Chicago and see her?” suggested Adelaide. “You ought\nto talk with her before anyone else has a chance. I wouldn’t put\nanything past her mother.”",
        "“That’s a good idea!” exclaimed Arthur, his face clearing before the\nprospect of action. “I’ll take the night train. Yes, I must be the one to\ntell her.”",
        "Adelaide had a sense of relief. Arthur would see Janet; Janet would\npour balm upon his wounds, would lift him up to a higher, more generous\nview. Then, whatever he might do would be done in the right spirit,\nwith respect for the memory of their father, with consideration for\ntheir mother.",
        "“You had better not see mother again until you come back,” she suggested.",
        "His face shadowed and shame came into it that was from the real Arthur\nRanger, the son of Hiram and Ellen. “I wish I hadn’t burst out as I did,\nDel,” he said. “I forgot everything in my own wrongs. I want to try to\nmake it all right with mother. I can’t believe that I said what I\nremember I did say before her who’d be glad to die for us.”",
        "“Everything’ll be all right when you come back, Artie,” she assured him.",
        "As they passed the outbuilding where the garden tools were kept they both\nglanced in. There stood the tools their father had always used in\npottering about the garden, above them his old slouch and old straw hats.\nArthur’s lip quivered; Adelaide caught her breath in a sob. “O Artie,\"\nshe cried brokenly, “He’s gone–gone–gone for ever.” And Artie sat on\nthe little bench just within the door and drew Del down beside him, and,\neach tightly in the other’s arms, they cried like the children that they\nwere, like the children that we all are in face of the great tragedy.",
        "A handsome and touching figure was Arthur Ranger as he left his cab and\nslowly ascended the lawn and the steps of the Whitney palace in the Lake\nDrive at eleven the next morning. His mourning garments were most\nbecoming to him, contrasting with the fairness of his hair, the blue of\nhis eyes, and the pallor of his skin. He looked big and strong and sad,\nand scrupulously fashionable, and very young.",
        "The Whitneys were leading in Chicago in building broad and ever broader\nthe barriers, not between rich and poor, but between the very, very rich\nand all the rest of the world. Mrs. Whitney had made a painstaking and\nreverent study of upper-class life in England and on the Continent, and\nwas endeavoring to use her education for the instruction of her\nassociates, and for the instilling of a proper awe into the multitude. To\nenter her door was at once to get the impression that one was receiving a\nhigh privilege. One would have been as greatly shocked as was Mrs.\nWhitney herself, could one have overheard “Charley” saying to her, as he\noccasionally did, with a grin which he strove to make as “common” as he\nknew how, “Really, Tillie, if you don’t let up a little on this putting\non dog, I’ll have to take to sneaking in by the back way. The butler’s a\nsight more of a gent than I am, and the housekeeper can give you points\non being a real, head-on-a-pole-over-the-shoulder lady.” A low fellow at\nheart was Charley Whitney, like so many of his similarly placed\ncompatriots, though he strove as hard as do they, almost as hard as his\nwife, to conceal the deficiencies due to early training in vulgarly\ndemocratic ways of living and thinking.",
        "Arthur, ushered by the excruciatingly fashionable butler into the\nsmallest of the series of reception salons, fell straightway into the\nmost melancholy spirits. He felt the black, icy shadow of the beginnings\nof doubt as to his right to admittance on terms of equality, now that his\ntitles to nobility had been torn from him and destroyed. He felt that he\nwas in grave danger of being soon mingled in the minds of his fashionable\nfriends and their servants with the vulgar herd, the respectable but\n“impossible” middle classes. Indeed, he was not sure that he didn’t\nreally belong among them. The sound of Janet’s subdued, most elegant\nrustle, drove out of his mind everything but an awful dread of what she\nwould say and think and feel when he had disclosed to her the hideous\ntruth. She came sweeping in, her eyes full of unshed tears, her manner a\nmodel of refined grief, sympathetic, soothing. She was tall and slim, a\nperfect figure of the long, lithe type; her face was small and fine and\ndreamy; her hair of an unusual straw color, golden, yet pale, too, like\nthe latest autumn leaves in the wan sun of November; her eyes were hazel,\nin strange and thrilling contrast to her hair. To behold her was to\nbehold all that man finds most fascinating in woman, but so illumined by\nthe soul within that to look on it with man’s eye for charms feminine\nseemed somewhat like casting sensuous glances upon beauty enmarbled in a\ntemple’s fane. Janet was human, but the human that points the way to\nsexless heaven.",
        "“Dear Artie!” she said gently. ’Dear Artie!” And she took both his\nhands and, as she looked at him, her tears fell. Arthur, in his new\nhumility of poverty, felt honored indeed that any loss of his could\ncause her matchless soul thus to droop upon its dazzling outer walls\nthe somber, showery insignia of grief. “But,” she went on, “you have\nhim still with you–his splendid, rugged character, the memory of all\nhe did for you.”",
        "Arthur was silent. They were seated now, side by side, and he was,\nsomewhat timidly, holding one of her hands.",
        "“He was so simple and so honest–such a man!” she continued. “Does it\nhurt you, dear, for me to talk about him?”",
        "“No–no,” he stammered, “I came to you–to–to–talk about him.” Then,\ndesperately, seizing her other hand and holding both tightly, “Janet,\nwould it make any difference with you if I–if I–no–What am I saying?\nJanet, I release you from our engagement. I–I–have no prospects,” he\nrushed on. “Father–They got round him and wheedled him into leaving\neverything to the college–to Tecumseh. I have nothing–I must give you\nup. I can’t ask you to wait–and–”",
        "He could not go on. He longed for the throbbing, human touch that beauty\nof hers could make so thrilling. But she slowly drew away her hands. Her\nexpression made him say:",
        "“What is it, Janet? What have I said that hurt you?”",
        "“Did you come,” she asked, in a strange, distant voice, “because you\nthought your not having money would make a difference with me?”",
        "“No,” he protested, in wild alarm. “It was only that I feel I–”",
        "“You feel that there could be a question of money between us?” she\ninterrupted.",
        "“Not between us, Janet,” he said eagerly; “but there is\nyour–your mother.”",
        "“I beg you,” she replied coldly, “not to speak of mamma in that way to\nme, even if you have such unjust thoughts of her.”",
        "Arthur looked at her uncertainly. He had an instinct, deep down, that\nthere was something wrong–something in her that he was not fathoming.\nBut in face of that cloud-dwelling beauty, he could only turn and look\nwithin himself. “I beg your pardon, dear,” he said. “You know so little\nof the practical side of life. You live so apart from it, so high above\nit, that I was afraid I’d be doing wrong by you if I did not put that\nside of it before you, too. But in the bottom of my heart I knew you\nwould stand by me.”",
        "She remained cold. “I don’t know whether I’m glad or sorry, Arthur, that\nyou let me see into your real self. I’ve often had doubts about our\nunderstanding each other, about our two natures being in that perfect\nharmony which makes the true marriage. But I’ve shut out those doubts as\ndisloyal to you. Now, you’ve forced me to see they were only too true!”",
        "“What do you mean, Janet? Of course, I’m not good enough for you–no one\nis, for that matter; but I love you, and–Do you care for me, Janet?”",
        "“Yes,” she replied mournfully. “But I must conquer it. O Arthur, Arthur!\"\nHer voice was tremulous now, and her strange hazel eyes streamed\nsorrowful reproach. “How could you think sordidly of what was sacred and\nholy to me, of what I thought was holy to us both? You couldn’t, if you\nhad been the man I imagined you were.”",
        "“Don’t blame a fellow for every loose word he utters when he’s all upset,\nJanet,” he pleaded. “Put yourself in my place. Suppose you found you\nhadn’t anything at all–found it out suddenly, when all along you had\nbeen thinking you’d never have to bother about money? Suppose you–But\nyou must know how the world, how all our friends, look on that sort of\nthing. And suppose you loved–just as I love you. Wouldn’t you go to her\nand hope she’d brace you up and make you feel that she really loved you\nand–all that? Wouldn’t you, Janet?”",
        "She looked sadly at him. “You don’t understand,” she said, her rosebud\nmouth drooping pathetically. “You can’t realize how you shook–how you\nshattered–my faith in you.”",
        "He caught her by the arms roughly. “Look here, Janet Whitney. Do you love\nme or don’t you? Do you intend to throw me over, now that I have lost my\nmoney, or do you intend to be all you’ve pretended to be?”",
        "The sadness in her sweet face deepened. “Let me go, Arthur,” she said\nquietly. “You don’t understand. You never will.”",
        "“Yes or no?” he demanded, shaking her. Then suddenly changing to\ntenderness, with all his longing for sympathy in his eyes and in his\nvoice, “Janet–dear–yes or no?”",
        "She looked away. “Don’t persist, Arthur,” she said, “or you will make me\nthink it is only my money that makes you, that made you, pretend to–to\ncare for me.”",
        "He drew back sharply. “Janet!” he exclaimed.",
        "“Of course, I don’t think so,” she continued, after a constrained\nsilence. “But I can’t find any other reason for your talking and acting\nas you have this morning.”",
        "He tried to see from her point of view. “Maybe it’s true,” he said, “that\nother things than our love have had too much to do with it, with both of\nus, in the past. But I love you for yourself alone, now, Janet. And, you\nhaven’t a fortune of your own, but only expectations–and they’re not\nalways realized, and in your case can’t be for many a year. So we don’t\nstart so unevenly. Give yourself to me, Janet. Show that you believe in\nme, and I know I shall not disappoint you.”",
        "Very manly his manner was as he said this, and brave and convincing was\nthe show of his latent, undeveloped powers in his features and voice.\nShe hesitated, then lowered her head, and, in a sad, gentle voice,\nsaid, “I don’t trust you, Arthur. You’ve cut away the foundation of\nlove. It would be fine and beautiful for us to start empty-handed and\nbuild up together, if we were in sympathy and harmony. But, doubting\nyou–I can’t.”",
        "Again he looked at her uneasily, suspicious, without knowing why or what.\nBut one thing was clear–to plead further with her would be\nself-degradation. “I have been tactless,” he said to her. “Probably, if I\nwere less in earnest, I should get on better. But, perhaps you will judge\nme more fairly when you think it over. I’ll say only one thing more. I\ncan’t give up hope. It’s about all I’ve got left–hope of you–belief in\nyou. I must cling to that. I’ll go now, Janet.”",
        "She said nothing, simply looked unutterable melancholy, and let her hand\nlie listlessly in his until he dropped it. He looked back at her when he\nreached the door. She seemed so sad that he was about to return to her\nside. She sighed heavily, gazed at him, and said, “Good-by, Arthur.\"\nAfter that he had no alternative. He went. “I must wait until she is\ncalm,” he said to himself. “She is so delicately strung.”",
        "As he was driving toward the hotel, his gloom in his face, he did not see\nMrs. Whitney dash past and give him an anxious searching glance, and sink\nback in her carriage reassured somewhat. She had heard that he was on the\nChicago express–had heard it from her masseuse, who came each morning\nbefore she was up. She had leaped to the telephone, had ordered a special\ntrain, and had got herself into it and off for her Chicago home by\nhalf-past eight. “That sentimental girl, full of high ideals–what mayn’t\nshe do!” she was muttering, almost beside herself with anxiety. “No doubt\nhe’ll try and induce her to run away with him.” And the rushing train\nseemed to creep and crawl.",
        "She burst into the house like a dignified whirlwind. “Where’s Miss\nJanet?” she demanded of the butler.",
        "“Still in the blue salon, ma’am, I think,” he replied. “Mr. Arthur\nRanger just left a few moments ago.”",
        "Clearing her surface of all traces of agitation, Mrs. Whitney went into\nthe presence of her daughter. “Mamma!” cried Janet, starting up. “Has\nanything happened?”",
        "“Nothing, nothing, dear,” replied her mother, kissing her tenderly. “I\nwas afraid my letter might have miscarried. And, when I heard that Arthur\nhad slipped away to Chicago, I came myself. I’ve brought you up so purely\nand innocently that I became alarmed lest he might lead you into some\nrash sentimentality. As I said in my letter, if Arthur had grown up into\na strong, manly character, I should have been eager to trust my daughter\nto him. But my doubts about him were confirmed by the will. And–he is\nsimply a fortune-hunter now.”",
        "Janet had hidden her face in her handkerchief. “Oh, no!” she exclaimed.\n“You wrong him, mother.”",
        "“You haven’t encouraged him, Janet!” cried Mrs. Whitney. “After what I’ve\nbeen writing you?”",
        "“The loss of his money hasn’t made any difference about him with me,\"\nsaid Janet, her pure, sweet face lighting up with the expression that\nmade her mother half-ashamed of her own worldliness.",
        "“Of course not! Of course not, Janet,” said she. “No child of mine could\nbe mercenary without being utterly false to my teachings.”",
        "Janet’s expression was respectful, yet not confirmatory. She had often\nprotested inwardly against the sordid views of life which her mother\nunconsciously held and veiled with scant decency in the family circle in\nher unguarded moments. But she had fought against the contamination, and\nproudly felt that her battle for the “higher plane” was successful.",
        "Her mother returned, somewhat awkwardly, to the main point. “I hope you\ndidn’t encourage him, Janet.”",
        "“I don’t wish to talk of it, mother,” was Janet’s reply. “I have not been\nwell, and all this has upset me.”",
        "Mrs. Whitney was gnawing her palms with her nails and her lip with her\nteeth. She could scarcely restrain herself from seizing her daughter and\nshaking the truth, whatever it was, out of her. But prudence and respect\nfor her daughter’s delicate soul restrained her.",
        "“You have made it doubly hard for me,” Janet went on. “Your writing me to\nstay away because there was doubt about Arthur’s material future–oh,\nmother, how could that make any difference? If I had not been feeling so\ndone, and if father hadn’t been looking to me to keep him company, I’d\nsurely have gone. For I hate to have my motive misunderstood.”",
        "“He has worked on her soft-heartedness and inexperience,” thought Mrs.\nWhitney, in a panic.",
        "“And when Arthur came to-day,” the girl continued, “I was ready to fly to\nhim.” She looked tragic. “And even when he repulsed me–”",
        "“Repulsed you!” exclaimed Mrs. Whitney. She laughed disagreeably. “He’s\nsubtler than I thought.”",
        "“Even when he repulsed me,” pursued Janet, “with his sordid way of\nlooking at everything, still I tried to cling to him, to shut my eyes.”",
        "Mrs. Whitney vented an audible sigh of relief. “Then you didn’t let him\ndeceive you!”",
        "“He shattered my last illusion,” said Janet, in a mournful voice.\n“Mother, I simply couldn’t believe in him, in the purity of his love. I\nhad to give him up.”",
        "Mrs. Whitney put her arms round her daughter and kissed her soothingly\nagain and again. “Don’t grieve, dear,” she said. “Think how much better\nit is that you should have found him out now than when it was too late.”",
        "And Janet shuddered.",
        "Ross dropped in at the house in the Lake Drive the next morning on his\nway East from the Howlands. As soon as he was alone with his mother, he\nasked, “How about Janet and Arthur?”",
        "Mrs. Whitney put on her exalted expression. “I’m glad you said nothing\nbefore Janet,” said she. “The child is so sensitive, and Arthur has given\nher a terrible shock. Men are so coarse; they do not appreciate the\ndelicateness of a refined woman. In this case, however, it was most\nfortunate. She was able to see into his true nature.”",
        "“Then she’s broken it off? That’s good.”",
        "“Be careful what you say to her,” his mother hastened to warn him. “You\nmight upset her mind again. She’s so afraid of being misunderstood.”",
        "“She needn’t be,” replied Ross dryly.",
        "And when he looked in on Janet in her sitting room to say good-by, he\nbegan with a satirical, “Congratulations, Jenny.”",
        "Jenny looked at him with wondering eyes. She was drooping like a sunless\nflower and was reading poetry out of a beautifully bound volume. “What is\nit, Ross?” she asked.",
        "“On shaking Artie so smoothly. Trust you to do the right thing at the\nright time, and in the right way. You’re a beauty, Jen, and no mistake,\"\nlaughed Ross. “I never saw your like. You really must marry a\ntitle–Madame la Duchesse! And nobody’s on to you but me. You aren’t\neven on to yourself!”",
        "Janet drew up haughtily and swept into her bedroom, closing the door with\nalmost coarse emphasis.",
