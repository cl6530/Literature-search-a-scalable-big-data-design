        "Day after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; and\nI could not collect the courage to recommence my work.  I feared the\nvengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my\nrepugnance to the task which was enjoined me.  I found that I could not\ncompose a female without again devoting several months to profound\nstudy and laborious disquisition.  I had heard of some discoveries\nhaving been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was\nmaterial to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my\nfather’s consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to\nevery pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an\nundertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to\nme.  A change indeed had taken place in me; my health, which had\nhitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when\nunchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably.  My\nfather saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts\ntowards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy,\nwhich every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring\nblackness overcast the approaching sunshine.  At these moments I took\nrefuge in the most perfect solitude.  I passed whole days on the lake\nalone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to the\nrippling of the waves, silent and listless.  But the fresh air and\nbright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure, and\non my return I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile\nand a more cheerful heart.",
        "It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father,\ncalling me aside, thus addressed me,",
        "“I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former\npleasures and seem to be returning to yourself.  And yet you are still\nunhappy and still avoid our society.  For some time I was lost in\nconjecture as to the cause of this, but yesterday an idea struck me,\nand if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it.  Reserve on such a\npoint would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us\nall.”",
        "I trembled violently at his exordium, and my father continued–\"I\nconfess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your marriage\nwith our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the stay\nof my declining years.  You were attached to each other from your\nearliest infancy; you studied together, and appeared, in dispositions\nand tastes, entirely suited to one another.  But so blind is the\nexperience of man that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my\nplan may have entirely destroyed it.  You, perhaps, regard her as your\nsister, without any wish that she might become your wife.  Nay, you may\nhave met with another whom you may love; and considering yourself as\nbound in honour to Elizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant\nmisery which you appear to feel.”",
        "“My dear father, reassure yourself.  I love my cousin tenderly and\nsincerely.  I never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my\nwarmest admiration and affection.  My future hopes and prospects are\nentirely bound up in the expectation of our union.”",
        "“The expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear Victor,\ngives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced.  If you\nfeel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast\na gloom over us.  But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so\nstrong a hold of your mind that I wish to dissipate.  Tell me,\ntherefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnization of the\nmarriage.  We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us\nfrom that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities. You\nare younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent\nfortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future\nplans of honour and utility that you may have formed.  Do not suppose,\nhowever, that I wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on\nyour part would cause me any serious uneasiness.  Interpret my words\nwith candour and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and\nsincerity.”",
        "I listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable\nof offering any reply.  I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of\nthoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion.  Alas!  To me\nthe idea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror and\ndismay.  I was bound by a solemn promise which I had not yet fulfilled\nand dared not break, or if I did, what manifold miseries might not\nimpend over me and my devoted family!  Could I enter into a festival\nwith this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the\nground?  I must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with\nhis mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from\nwhich I expected peace.",
        "I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to\nEngland or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers\nof that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable\nuse to me in my present undertaking.  The latter method of obtaining\nthe desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, I\nhad an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my\nloathsome task in my father’s house while in habits of familiar\nintercourse with those I loved.  I knew that a thousand fearful\naccidents might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale to\nthrill all connected with me with horror.  I was aware also that I\nshould often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the\nharrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my\nunearthly occupation.  I must absent myself from all I loved while thus\nemployed.  Once commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and I might be\nrestored to my family in peace and happiness.  My promise fulfilled,\nthe monster would depart forever.  Or (so my fond fancy imaged) some\naccident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my\nslavery forever.",
        "These feelings dictated my answer to my father.  I expressed a wish to\nvisit England, but concealing the true reasons of this request, I\nclothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while I\nurged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to\ncomply.  After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that\nresembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find\nthat I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey,\nand he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my\nreturn, have restored me entirely to myself.",
        "The duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or\nat most a year, was the period contemplated.  One paternal kind\nprecaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion.  Without\npreviously communicating with me, he had, in concert with Elizabeth,\narranged that Clerval should join me at Strasbourg.  This interfered\nwith the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at the\ncommencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be\nan impediment, and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved many\nhours of lonely, maddening reflection.  Nay, Henry might stand between\nme and the intrusion of my foe.  If I were alone, would he not at times\nforce his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to\ncontemplate its progress?",
        "To England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union\nwith Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return.  My father’s\nage rendered him extremely averse to delay.  For myself, there was one\nreward I promised myself from my detested toils–one consolation for\nmy unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when,\nenfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth and\nforget the past in my union with her.",
        "I now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted me\nwhich filled me with fear and agitation.  During my absence I should\nleave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and\nunprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my\ndeparture.  But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go, and\nwould he not accompany me to England?  This imagination was dreadful in\nitself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends.\nI was agonized with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of\nthis might happen.  But through the whole period during which I was the\nslave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of\nthe moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend\nwould follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his\nmachinations.",
        "It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native\ncountry.  My journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth\ntherefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of\nmy suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief.  It had\nbeen her care which provided me a companion in Clerval–and yet a man\nis blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman’s\nsedulous attention.  She longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousand\nconflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silent\nfarewell.",
        "I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly\nknowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around.\nI remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on\nit, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with\nme.  Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful\nand majestic scenes, but my eyes were fixed and unobserving.  I could\nonly think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy\nme whilst they endured.",
        "After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed\nmany leagues, I arrived at Strasbourg, where I waited two days for\nClerval.  He came.  Alas, how great was the contrast between us!  He\nwas alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of the\nsetting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new\nday.  He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and\nthe appearances of the sky.  “This is what it is to live,” he cried;\n“how I enjoy existence!  But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are\nyou desponding and sorrowful!” In truth, I was occupied by gloomy\nthoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden\nsunrise reflected in the Rhine.  And you, my friend, would be far more\namused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an\neye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections.  I, a\nmiserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to\nenjoyment.",
        "We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasbourg to\nRotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London.  During this\nvoyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns.\nWe stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from\nStrasbourg, arrived at Mainz.  The course of the Rhine below Mainz\nbecomes much more picturesque.  The river descends rapidly and winds\nbetween hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms.  We saw\nmany ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by\nblack woods, high and inaccessible.  This part of the Rhine, indeed,\npresents a singularly variegated landscape.  In one spot you view\nrugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with\nthe dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory,\nflourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river\nand populous towns occupy the scene.",
        "We travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the\nlabourers as we glided down the stream.  Even I, depressed in mind, and\nmy spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was\npleased.  I lay at the bottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the\ncloudless blue sky, I seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which I had\nlong been a stranger.  And if these were my sensations, who can\ndescribe those of Henry?  He felt as if he had been transported to\nfairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by man.  “I have\nseen,” he said, “the most beautiful scenes of my own country; I have\nvisited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the snowy mountains descend\nalmost perpendicularly to the water, casting black and impenetrable\nshades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance were it not\nfor the most verdant islands that believe the eye by their gay\nappearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind\ntore up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the\nwater-spout must be on the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury\nthe base of the mountain, where the priest and his mistress were\noverwhelmed by an avalanche and where their dying voices are still said\nto be heard amid the pauses of the nightly wind; I have seen the\nmountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud; but this country, Victor,\npleases me more than all those wonders.  The mountains of Switzerland\nare more majestic and strange, but there is a charm in the banks of\nthis divine river that I never before saw equalled.  Look at that\ncastle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the island,\nalmost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now\nthat group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village\nhalf hid in the recess of the mountain.  Oh, surely the spirit that\ninhabits and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than\nthose who pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the\nmountains of our own country.” Clerval!  Beloved friend!  Even now it\ndelights me to record your words and to dwell on the praise of which\nyou are so eminently deserving.  He was a being formed in the “very\npoetry of nature.” His wild and enthusiastic imagination was chastened\nby the sensibility of his heart.  His soul overflowed with ardent\naffections, and his friendship was of that devoted and wondrous nature\nthat the world-minded teach us to look for only in the imagination. But\neven human sympathies were not sufficient to satisfy his eager mind. \nThe scenery of external nature, which others regard only with\nadmiration, he loved with ardour:–",
        "     ––-The sounding cataract\n     Haunted him like a passion:  the tall rock,\n     The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,\n     Their colours and their forms, were then to him\n     An appetite; a feeling, and a love,\n     That had no need of a remoter charm,\n     By thought supplied, or any interest\n     Unborrow’d from the eye.",
        "                    [Wordsworth’s “Tintern Abbey”.]",
        "And where does he now exist?  Is this gentle and lovely being lost\nforever?  Has this mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful\nand magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the\nlife of its creator;–has this mind perished?  Does it now only exist\nin my memory?  No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and\nbeaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and\nconsoles your unhappy friend.",
        "Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight\ntribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart,\noverflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates.  I will\nproceed with my tale.",
        "Beyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved\nto post the remainder of our way, for the wind was contrary and the\nstream of the river was too gentle to aid us.  Our journey here lost\nthe interest arising from beautiful scenery, but we arrived in a few\ndays at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England.  It was on a\nclear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first saw the\nwhite cliffs of Britain.  The banks of the Thames presented a new\nscene; they were flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by\nthe remembrance of some story.  We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the\nSpanish Armada, Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich–places which I had\nheard of even in my country.",
        "At length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paul’s towering\nabove all, and the Tower famed in English history.",
