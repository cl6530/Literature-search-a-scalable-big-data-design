        "Judge Torrey succeeded Whitney as chairman of the overseers of Tecumseh\nand in the vacant trusteeship of the Ranger bequest. Soon Dr. Hargrave,\ninsisting that he was too old for the labors of the presidency of such a\nhuge and varied institution as the university had become, was made\nhonorary president, and his son, still in Europe, was elected chairman of\nthe faculty. Toward the middle of a fine afternoon in early September Dr.\nHargrave and his daughter-in-law drove to the railway station in the\nancient and roomy phaeton which was to Saint X as much part of his\npersonality as the aureole of glistening white hair that framed his\nmajestic head, or as the great plaid shawl that had draped his big\nshoulders with their student stoop every winter day since anyone could\nremember. Despite his long exposure to the temptation to sink into the\nemasculate life of unapplied intellect, mere talker and writer, and to\nadopt that life’s flabby ideals, he had remained the man of ideas, the\nman of action. His learning was all but universal, yet he had the rugged,\ndirect vigor of the man of affairs. His was not the knowledge that\nenfeebles, but the knowledge that empowers. As his son, the new executive\nof the university–with the figure of a Greek athlete, with positive\ncharacter, will as well as intellect, stamped upon his young\nface–appeared in the crowd, the onlookers had the sense that a\n“somebody” had arrived. Dory’s always was the air an active mind never\nfails to give; as Judge Torrey once said: “You’ve only got to look at him\nto see he’s the kind that does things, not the kind that tells how they\nused to be done or how they oughtn’t to be done.” Now there was in his\nface and bearing the subtly but surely distinguishing quality that comes\nonly with the strength a man gets when his fellows acknowledge his\nleadership, when he has seen the creations of his brain materialize in\nwork accomplished. Every successful man has this look, and shows it\naccording to his nature–the arrogant arrogantly; the well-balanced with\ntranquil unconsciousness.",
        "As he moved toward his father and Adelaide, her heart swelled with pride\nin him, with pride in her share in him. Ever since the sending of the\ncablegram to recall him, she had been wondering what she would feel at\nsight of him. Now she forgot all about her once-beloved self-analysis.\nShe was simply proud of him, enormously proud; other men seemed trivial\nbeside this personage. Also she was a little afraid; for, as their eyes\nmet, it seemed to her that his look of recognition and greeting was not\nso ardent as she was accustomed to associate with his features when\nturned toward her. But before she could be daunted by her misgiving it\nvanished; for he impetuously caught her in his arms and, utterly\nforgetting the onlookers, kissed her until every nerve in her body was\ntingling in the sweeping flame of that passion which his parting caress\nhad stirred to vague but troublesome restlessness. And she, too, forgot\nthe crowd, and shyly, proudly gave as well as received; so there began to\nvibrate between them the spark that clears brains and hearts of the fogs\nand vapors and keeps them clear. And it was not a problem in psychology\nthat was revealed to those admiring and envying spectators in the\nbrilliant September sunshine, but a man and a woman in love in the way\nthat has been “the way of a man with a maid” from the beginning; in love,\nand each looking worthy of the other’s love–he handsome in his blue\nserge, she beautiful in a light-brown fall dress with pale-gold facings,\nand the fluffy, feathery boa close round her fair young face.\nCivilization has changed methods, but not essentials; it is still not\nwhat goes on in the minds of a man and woman that counts, but what goes\non in their hearts and nerves.",
        "The old doctor did not in the least mind the momentary neglect of\nhimself. He had always assumed that his son and Del loved each other,\nthere being every reason why they should and no reason why they\nshouldn’t; he saw only the natural and the expected in this outburst\nwhich astonished and somewhat embarrassed them with the partial return of\nthe self-consciousness that had been their curse. He beamed on them from\neyes undimmed by half a century of toil, as bright under his shaggy white\nbrows as the first spring flowers among the snows. As soon as he had\nDory’s hand and his apparent attention, he said: “I hope you’ve been\ngetting your address ready on the train, as I suggested in my telegram.”",
        "“I’ve got it in my bag,” replied Dory.",
        "In the phaeton Del sat between them and drove. Dory forgot the honors he\nhad come home to receive; he had eyes and thoughts only for her, was\nimpatient to be alone with her, to reassure himself of the meaning of the\nblushes that tinted her smooth white skin and the shy glances that stole\ntoward him from the violet eyes under those long lashes of hers. Dr.\nHargrave resumed the subject that was to him paramount. “You see,\nTheodore, your steamer’s being nearly two days late brings you home just\na day before the installation. You’ll be delivering, your address at\neleven to-morrow morning.”",
        "“So I shall,” said Dory absently.",
        "“You say it’s ready. Hadn’t you better let me get it type-written for\nyou?”",
        "Dory opened the bag at his feet, gave his father a roll of paper. “Please\nlook it over, and make any changes you like.”",
        "Dr. Hargrave began the reading then and there. He had not finished the\nfirst paragraph when Dory interrupted with, “Why, Del, you’re passing\nour turning.”",
        "Del grew crimson. The doctor, without looking up or taking his mind off\nthe address, said: “Adelaide gave up Mrs. Dorsey’s house several weeks\nago. You are living with us.”",
        "Dory glanced at her quickly and away. She said nothing. “He’ll\nunderstand,” thought she–and she was right.",
        "Only those who have had experience of the older generation out West\nwould have suspected the pride, the affection, the delight hiding behind\nMartha Skeffington’s prim and formal welcome, or that it was not\nindifference but the unfailing instinct of a tender heart that made her\nsay, after a very few minutes: “Adelaide, don’t you think Dory’d like to\nlook at the rooms?”",
        "Del led the way, Dory several feet behind her–deliberately, lest he\nshould take that long, slender form of hers in his arms that he might\nagain feel her bosom swelling and fluttering against him, and her fine,\nthick, luminous hair caressing his temple and his cheek. Miss Skeffington\nhad given them the three large rooms on the second floor–the two Dory\nused to have and one more for Del. As he followed Del into the sitting\nroom he saw that there had been changes, but he could not note them. She\nwas not looking at him; she seemed to be in a dream, or walking with the\nslow deliberate steps one takes in an unfamiliar and perilous path.",
        "“That is still your bedroom,” said she, indicating one of the doors.\n“A stationary stand has been put in. Perhaps you’d like to freshen\nup a bit.”",
        "“A stationary stand,” he repeated, as if somewhat dazed before this\npractical detail. “Yes–I think so.”",
        "She hesitated, went into her room, not quite closing the door behind her.\nHe stared at it with a baffled look. “And,” he was thinking, “I imagined\nI had trained myself to indifference.” An object near the window caught\nhis eye–a table at which he could work standing. He recalled that he had\nseen its like in a big furniture display at Paris when they were there\ntogether, and that he had said he would get one for himself some day.\nThis hint that there might be more than mere matter in those surroundings\nset his eyes to roving. That revolving bookcase by the desk, the circular\nkind he had always wanted, and in it the books he liked to have at\nhand–Montaigne and Don Quixote, Shakespeare and Shelley and Swinburne,\nthe Encyclopedia, the statistical yearbooks; on top, his favorites among\nthe magazines. And the desk itself–a huge spread of cleared surface–an\nenormous blotting pad, an ink well that was indeed a well–all just what\nhe had so often longed for as he sat cramped at little desks where an\nattempt to work meant overflow and chaos of books and papers. And that\nbig inlaid box–it was full of his favorite cigarettes; and the\ndrop-light, and the green shade for the eyes, and the row of pencils\nsharpened as he liked them–",
        "He knocked at her door. “Won’t you come out here a moment?” cried he,\nputting it in that form because he had never adventured her intimate\nthreshold.",
        "No answer, though the door was ajar and she must have heard.",
        "“Please come out here,” he repeated.",
        "A pause; then, in her voice, shy but resolute, the single word, “Come!”",
