        "THE SPANISH ACCOUNT OF THE REPULSE OF NELSON FROM SANTA CRUZ DE TENERIFE.",
        "[Footnote: From the Relacion circumstanciada de la Defensa que hizo\nla Plaza de Santa Cruz, by M. Monteverde. Published in Madrid, 1798.]",
        "The following pages afford a circumstantial and, I believe, a fairly\ntrue account of an incident much glossed over by our naval\nhistorians. The subject is peculiarly interesting. At Santa Cruz, as at\nFontenoy, the Irish, whom harsh measures at home drove for protection to\nmore friendly lands, took ample share in the fighting which defeated\nEngland’s greatest sailor. Again, the short-sighted policy which sent to\nthe Crimea 20,000 British soldiers to play second instrument in concert\nwith 40,000 Frenchmen, thus lowering us in the eyes of Europe, made\nNelson oppose his 960 hands to more than eight times their number. The\nday may come when the attack shall be repeated. Now that steam has\nrendered fleets independent of south-west winds, it is to be hoped the\nassailant will prefer day to night, so that his divisions can\ncommunicate; that he will not land in the ’raging surf’ of the ebb-tide,\nand that he will attack the almost defenceless south instead of the\nwell-fortified north of the city.",
        "Already the heroic Island had inflicted partial or total defeat upon\nthree English admirals. [Footnote: Grand Canary also did her duty by\nbeating off, in October 1795, Drake’s strong squadron.] In April 1657\nthe Roundhead ’general at sea,’ Admiral Sir Robert Blake, of\nBridgewater, attempted to cut out the Spanish galleons freighted with\nMexican gold and with the silver of Peru. Of these the principal were\nthe Santo-Cristo, the Jesus-Maria, the Santo Sacramento,\nLa Concepcion, the San Juan, the Virgen de la Solitud,\nand the Nuestra Señora del Buen Socorro. This ’silver fleet’\nwas moored under the guns of the ’chief castle,’ San Cristobal,\nthe mean work at the root of the mole. The English were\npreparing to board, when the Captain-General, D. Diego de Egues, whom\nour histories call ’Diagues,’ ordered the fleet to be fired, after all\nthe treasure had been housed in the fort. A steady fight lasted three\nhours, during which the wife of the brave Governor, D. Estevan de la\nGuerra, distinguished herself. ’I shall not be useless here,’ she\nexclaimed when invited to leave the batteries; and this ’maid of\nTenerife’ continued to animate the garrison till the end. As was the\ncase with his great successor, Roundhead Blake’s failure proved to him\nfar better than a success. For his francesada, or coup de\ntête, Nelson expected to lose his commission, instead of which some\npopular freak flung to him honour and honours. So Protector Cromwell\nsent a valuable diamond ring to his ’general at sea,’ in token of esteem\non his part and that of his Parliament. Our histories, relying on the\nfact that a few weak batteries were silenced, claim for the Admiral a\npositive victory, despite his losses–fifty killed and 500 wounded.",
        "[Footnote: The late Mr. Hepworth Dixon (Life of Blake, p. 346)\ndescribes the open roadstead of Santa Cruz as a ’harbour shaped like a\nhorse-shoe, and defended at the north side of the entrance by a regular\ncastle.’ In p. 350 we also read of the bay and its entrance. Any\nhydrographic chart would have set him right.]",
        "In 1706, during the Spanish war of succession, Admiral Jennings sailed\ninto Santa Cruz bay–the old Bay of Anaga or Anago–and lay off San\nCristobal",
        "[Footnote: This work still remains. It is a parallelogram with four\nbastions in star-shape, fronting the sea, and an embrasured wall facing\nthe town. It began as a chapel, set up by De Lugo to N. S. de la\nConsolacion, and a tower was added in 1493. It was destroyed by the\nGuanches and rebuilt by Charles Quint: the present building assumed its\nshape in 1579. The main square, inland of San Cristobal, shows by a\nmarble cross where the conqueror planted with one hand a large affair of\nwood–hence Santa Cruz. The original is, or was till lately, in the\nCivil Hospital.]",
        "with twelve ships of the line. The Plaza was commanded, in the absence\nof the Captain-General, by the Corregidor, D. Antonio de Ayala, who\nassembled all the nobles in the castle’s lower rooms and swore them to\nloyalty. The English attempted to disembark, and were beaten back;\nwhereupon, as under Nelson, they sent a parliamentary and summoned the\nisland to surrender to the Archduke Charles of Austria. The envoy\ninformed the Governor, who is described by Dampier as sitting in a low,\ndark, uncarpeted room, adorned only with muskets and pikes, that Philip\nV. had lost Gibraltar, that Cadiz and Minorca had nearly fallen, and\nthat the American galleons in the port of Vigo had been burnt or\ncaptured by the English, whose army, entering Castile, had overrun\nAragon, Catalonia, and Valencia. The braves reply was, ’If Philip, our\nking, had lost his all in the Peninsula, these islands would still\nremain faithful to him.’ And the castle guns did such damage that the\nJennings squadron sailed away on the same evening.",
        "The third expedition, detached by Admmiral Sir John Jervis, afterwards\nEarl St. Vincent, to ’cut out a richly freighted Manilla ship,’ also\nresulted in a tremendous failure. Captain Brenton, to gratify national\ncomplacency, grossly exaggerates in his ’Naval History’ the difficulty\nof the enterprise. ’Of all places which ever came under our inspection\nnone, we conceive, is more invulnerable to attack or more easily\ndefended than Teneriffe.’ He forgets to mention its principal guard, the\nvalour of the inhabitants. And now to my translation.",
        "’At dawn on July 2, [Footnote: James (Naval History,\nvol. ii. p. 56) more correctly says July 20. So the Despatches, &c.,\nof Lord Nelson, Sir H. Nicholas, vol. ii. p. 429. The thanksgiving\nfor the victory took place on July 27, the fête of SS. Iago and\nCristobal.] 1797, the squadron [Footnote: The squadron was composed as\nfollows:–1. Theseus (74), Captain Ralph Willett Miller, carried\nthe Rear-Admiral’s flag; 2. Culloden (74), Commodore and Captain\nThos. Troubridge; 3. Zealous (74), Captain Sam. Hood;\n4. Leander (50), Captain Thos. Boulden Thomson, which joined on\nthe day before the attack. There were three frigates:–1. Seahorse\n(38), Captain Thos. Francis Fremantle; 2. Emerald (36), Captain\nJohn Waller; and 3. Terpsichore (32), Captain Richard Bowen; also\nthe Fox (cutter), Lieut. Commander John Gibson, and a mortar-boat\nor a bomb-ketch, probably a ship’s launch with a shell-gun.] of\nRear-Admiral Horatio Nelson, K.B., composed of nine ships, and\ncarrying a total of 393 guns, appeared off Santa Cruz, the port\nof Tenerife, Canarian archipelago. The enemy at once manned and\nput off his boats. One division of sixteen occupied our front; the\nother twenty-three took the direction of the Bufadero valley, a wild\ngap two or three miles to the north of the harbour.",
        "’An alarm signal was immediately made in the town, when the enemy\nreturned to his ships, and made his troops prepare to disembark. At ten\nA.M. the three frigates, towed by their boats, cast anchor out of\ncannon-shot, near the Bufadero; whilst the other vessels plied to\nwindward, [Footnote: At the time the weather was calm in the town, but a\nviolent levante, or east wind, prevented vessels from approaching the\nbay, where the lee shore is very dangerous.] and disembarked about 1,200\nmen on the beach of Valle Seco, between the town and the valley. This\nparty occupied the nearest hill before it could be attacked; its\nmovements showed an intention to seize the steep rocky scarp commanding\nthe Paso Alto–the furthest to the north of the town. [Footnote:\nNelson’s rough sketch, vol. ii. p. 434, shows that it had 26 guns. San\nCristobal de Paso Alto commands the large ravine called by the Guanches\n’Tahoide’ or ’Tejode,’ which is now defended by San Miguel. This is a\nsmall rockwork carrying six guns in two tiers, the upper en\nbarbette and the lower casemated.] Thus the enemy would have been\nenabled to land fresh troops during the night; and, after gaining the\nheights and roads leading to the town, to attack us in flank as well as\nin front.",
        "’Light troops were detached to annoy the invader, and they soon occupied\nthe passes with praiseworthy celerity and boldness. One party was led by\nthe Capitaine de Frégate Citizen Ponné [Footnote: James calls him Zavier\nPommier. He commanded the French brig Mutine (14), of 349 tons,\nwith a crew of 135. As he landed at Santa Cruz with 22 of his men on May\n28, 1797, the frigates Lively, Captain Benjamin Hallowell, and\nthe Minerva, Captain George Cockburn, descried the hostile\ncraft. Lieutenant Hardy, of the Minerva, supported by six\nofficers and their respective boats’ crews, boarded her as she lay at\nanchor. Despite the fire of the garrison and of a large ship in the\nroads, he carried her, after an hour’s work, safe out of gunshot. Only\n15 men were wounded, including Lieutenant Hardy. This officer was at\nonce put in command of the Mutine, which he had so gallantly\nwon.] and by the Lieutenant de Vaisseau Citizen Faust. Both officers,\nwho had been exchanged and restored at the same port, showed much\npresence of mind on this occasion, and on July 25 they applied to be\nposted at a dangerous point of attack–the beach to the south of the\ntown, near Puerto Caballas, beyond where the Lazaretto now lies. When\nthe enemy purposed assaulting a more central post, they came up at the\nmoment of the affair, ending in our victory.",
        "’A second party was composed of the Infantry Battalion of the Canaries,\n[Footnote: This battalion afterwards distinguished itself highly in the\nPeninsular war.] under Sub-Lieutenant Don Juan Sanchez. A third,\ncomposed of 70 recruits from the Banderas [Footnote: Bandera is a\nflag, a depôt, also a levy made by officers of Government.] of Havana\nand Cuba, was led by Second Lieutenant Don Pedro Castillo; a fourth\nnumbered seventeen artillerymen and two officers, Lieutenant Don Josef\nFeo and Sub-Lieutenant Don Francisco Dugi. A fifth, and the last, was of\ntwenty-five free chasseurs belonging to the town, and commanded by\nCaptains Don Felipe Viña and Don Luis Roman.",
        "’Our Commandant-General, H. E. Señor Don Juan Antonio Gutierrez,\n[Footnote: Not Gutteri, as James has it, nor ’Gutienez,’ as Mrs. Murray\nprefers.] was residing in the principal castle of San Cristobal. His\nstaff consisted of the commandants of the Royal Corps of Artillery and\nEngineers, Don Marcelo Estranio and Don Luis Margueli; of the Auditor of\nWar (an old office, the legal military adviser and judge), Don Vicente\nPatiño; of Lieutenant-Colonel Don Juan Creagh (locally pronounced\nCré-ah); of the Secretary of Inspection Captain Don Juan Creagh; of the\nSecretary to Government and Captain of Militia Don Guillermo de los\nReyes; of the Captain of Infantry Don Josef Victor Dominguez; of\nLieutenants Don Vicente Siera and Don Josef Calzadilla,\nTown-Adjutant–the latter three acting as aides-de-camp to his\nExcellency–and of the first officers of the Tobacco and Postal Bureaux,\nDon Juan Fernandez Uriarte and Don Gaspar de Fuentes.",
        "’The five parties before alluded to, numbering a total of 191, were, at\nhis own request, placed under Lieutenant-Colonel the Marquess de la\nFuente de las Palmas, commanding the division of chasseurs. The first to\nmount the hill nearest the enemy, he saw the increased force of the\nattacker, who had placed a 4-pounder in position; whereupon he sent for\nreinforcements and some pieces of cannon. Our Commandant-General, on\nreceipt of the message, ordered up four guns (3 and 4-pounders) with\nfifty men under a captain of the Infantry Battalion of the\nCanaries. Universal admiration was excited by the agility and\nintrepidity with which twenty militiamen of the Laguna Regiment, under\nthe chief of that corps, Florencio Gonsalez, scaled the cliffs, carrying\non their shoulders, besides their own arms and ammunition, the four guns\nand their appurtenances.",
        "’Meanwhile our troops replied bravely to the enemy’s deliberate fire of\nmusketry and field-pieces. As he sallied out to a spring in the Valle\nSeco, two of his men were killed by the French party and the levies of\nHavana and Cuba, whilst a third died of suffocation whilst scaling the\nheights. At the same time Lieutenant-Colonel Don Juan Creagh, commanding\nthe Infantry Battalion, accompanied by a volunteer, Don Vicente Siera,\nLieutenant of the local corps (fixo) of Cuba, led thirty of his\nmen and fifty Rozadores [Footnote: The insular name of an irregular\ncorps, now done away with. Literally taken, the word means sicklemen.]\nbelonging to the city of La Laguna. They proceeded across country in\norder to reconnoitre the enemy’s rear. Before nightfall they succeeded\nin occupying high ground in the same valley opposite the heights held by\nthe English, and in manning the defiles through which the latter must\npass on their way to the town.",
        "’As soon as the enemy saw these troops, he formed in five companies near\nhis field-gun. Lieutenant-Colonel Creagh was joined by some 500 men of\nthe Laguna militia, and their lieutenant, Don Nicholas Quintin Garcia,\nfollowed by the peasantry of the adjoining districts, under the Alcalde\nor Mayor of Taganana. These and all the other troops were liberally\nsupplied with provisions by the Ayuntamiento (municipality) of\nthe Island.",
        "’On the next morning (July 23) our scouts being sent down to the valley,\nfound that the enemy had disappeared during the night. Notwithstanding\nwhich, the Marquess de las Palmas ordered a deliberate fire to be kept\nup in case of surprise. Our General, when informed of the event,\nrecalled the troops. The Marquess, who unfortunately received a fall\nwhich kept him hors de combat for many days, [Footnote: I find\npencilled in the original volume, ’Que caida tam oportuna!’ (What a\nlucky fall!)] obeyed with his command at 5 P.M., leaving behind him\nthirty men under Don Felix Uriundo, second lieutenant of the Battalion\nof Canaries. Don Juan Creagh did the same with his men. But as the\nFrench commandant reported that some of the enemy were still lurking\nabout the place, our General-in-Chief directed Captain Don Santiago\nMadan, second adjutant of the same corps, to reconnoitre once more the\nValle Seco with 120 Rozadores. This duty was well performed, despite the\nroughness of the paths and the excessive heat of the sun.",
        "’The enemy’s squadron now seemed inclined to desist from its attempt. At\n6 A.M. of July 23 Rear-Admiral Nelson’s flagship, which, with the other\nships of the line, had kept in the offing, drew near, and signalled the\nfrigates to sheer off from the point and to rejoin the rest of the\nsquadron. These, however, at 3 P.M., allowed themselves to drop down the\ncoast towards the dangerous southern reaches between Barranco Hondo,\nbeyond the Quarantine-house and the village of Candelaria, distant a\nday’s march from Santa Cruz. To prevent their landing men, Captain Don\nAntonio Eduardo, and the special engineer, Don Manuel Madera,\nreconnoitred the shore about Puerto Caballas, to see if artillery could\nbe brought there. Meanwhile Sub-Lieutenant Don Cristobal Trinidad, of\nthe Guimar Regiment, watched, with fifty of his men, the coast near San\nIsidro, [Footnote: Here the landing is easiest.] which is not far from\nBarranco Hondo. The squadron, however, retired to such a distance that\nit could hardly be discerned from the town, as it bore S.E. 1/4 E.:\nnotwithstanding which, all preparations were made to give the enemy a\nwarm reception.",
        "’At daylight on July 24 the squadron again appeared, crowding on all\nsail to gain the weather-side. The look-out at Anaga Point, north of the\nisland, signalled three ships from that direction, and two to the south,\nwhere we could distinguish only one of fifteen guns, which was presently\njoined by the rest. At 6 P.M. the enemy anchored with his whole force on\nthe same ground which the frigates chose on the 22nd, and feinted to\nattack Paso Alto Fort. Our General and chiefs were not deceived.\nForeseeing that we should be assaulted in front, and to the\nright or south, [Footnote: The town of Santa Cruz runs due north and\nsouth in a right line; the bay affords no shelter to shipping, and the\nbeach is rocky.] they made their dispositions accordingly, without,\nhowever, neglecting to protect the left.",
        "’At 6 P.M. a frigate and the bomb-ketch approached Paso Alto, and the\nlatter opened fire upon the fort and the heights behind it. These\npositions were occupied by 56 men of the Battalion of the Canaries, 40\nRozadores, under Second Lieutenant Don Felix Uriundo, and 16\nartillerymen, commanded by Sub-Lieutenant of Militia Artillery Don Josef\nCambreleng. [Footnote: A Flemish name, I believe: the family is still in\nthe island.] Of 43 shells, however, only one fell in the fort, bursting\nin a place where straw for soldiers’ beds had been stored, and this,\nlike the others, did no damage. [Footnote: A fragment of this shell is\npreserved in the Fort Chapel for the edification of strangers.] Paso\nAlto, commanded by the Captain of the Royal Corps of Artillery, Don\nVicente Rosique, replied firmly. At the same time Don Juan del Castillo,\nsub-lieutenant of militia, with 16 men, reconnoitred, by H. E. the\nGovernor’s orders, the Valle Seco. The operation was boldly performed,\ndespite the darkness of night and other dangers; and our soldiers\nreturned with a prisoner, an Irish sailor of the Fox cutter, who\nhad swum off from his ship.",
        "’The enemy now prepared his force for the attack. One thousand five\nhundred men, [Footnote: James numbers 200 seamen and marines from each\nof the three line-of-battle ships, and 100 from each of the three\nfrigates, besides officers, servants, and a small detachment of Royal\nArtillery. This made a total of 1,000 to 1,060 men, commanded by\nCaptain, afterwards Admiral, Sir Thomas Troubridge, Bart. Nelson\n(Despatches, vol. ii. p. 43) says 600 to 700 men in the squadron\nboats, 180 on board the Fox, and about 70 or 80 in a captured\nboat; total, at most, 960.] as we were afterwards informed, well armed\nwith guns, pistols, pikes, swords, saws, and hatchets, and led by their\nbest officers, among whom was the Rear-Admiral, embarked in their\nboats. At 2.15 A.M. (July 25) they put off in the deepest silence. The\nfrigate of the Philippine Islands Company, anchored outside the shipping\nin the bay, discovered them when close alongside. Almost at the same\nmoment the Paso Alto Fort, under Lieutenant-Colonel Don Pedro de\nHigueras, and the Captain of Artillery Don Vicente Rosique, gave the\nsignal to the (saluting) battery of San Antonio [Footnote: This old\nwork, à fleur d’eau, still remains; and near it are the ruins of\nthe Bateria de los Melones, on land bought by the Davidson family.] in\nthe town, held by the Captain of Militia Artillery Don Patricio\nMadan. They alarmed the citizens by their fire, and the enemy attacked\nwith rare intrepidity.",
        "’The defence was gallantly kept up by the battery of San Miguel, under\nSub-Lieutenant of Artillery Don Josef Marrero; by the Castle of San\nPedro, [Footnote: The San Pedro battery dated from 1797. It defended the\nsouthern town with six embrasures and three guns en barbette. For\nmany years huge mortars and old guns lay outside this work.] under the\nCaptain of Artillery Don Francisco Tolosa; by the Provisional Battery de\nlos Melones, [Footnote: Now destroyed. It was, I have said, near the new\ncasemates north of the town.] under the Sergeant of Militia Juan\nEvangelista; by the Mole-battery, under Lieutenant of the Royal Corps of\nArtillery Don Joaquim Ruiz and Sub-Lieutenant of Militia Don Francisco\nDugi; by the Castle of San Cristobal, under the Captain of the Royal\nRegiment of Artillery and Brigade-Major Don Antonio Eduardo, who\ncommanded the central and right batteries, and Lieutenant of Militia\nArtillery Don Francisco Grandi, to whom were entrusted the defences on\nour left; by the battery of La Concepcion, [Footnote: Where the Custom\nHouse now is, in the middle of the town.] under Captain of the Royal\nRegiment of Artillery Don Clemente Falcon; and by that of San Telmo,\n[Footnote: Near the dirty little square south of the Custom House. The\nword is thus written throughout the Canary Islands; in Italy, Sant’\nElmo.] under the Captain of Militia Artillery Don Sebastian Yanez.",
        "’The rest of our line did not fire, because the enemy’s boats had not\npassed the Barranco, or stony watercourse, which divides the southern\nfrom the northern town. In the Castle of San Juan,",
        "[Footnote: It is the southernmost work, afterwards used as a\npowder-magazine. To the south of the town are also the Bateria de la\nRosa, near the coal-sheds, and the Santa Isabel work. The latter had 22\nfine brass guns, each of 13 centimètres, made at Seville, once a famous\nmanufactory.]",
        "however, Captain Don Diego Fernandez Calderia trained four guns to bear\nupon the beach, which was protected by the Laguna militia regiment,\nunder Lieutenant-Colonel Juan de Castro.",
        "’So hot and well-directed was our fire, that almost all the boats were\ndriven back, and the Fox cutter, with her commander and 382 of\nthe landing party–others said 450–also carrying a reserve store of\narms and ammunition, was sunk. [Footnote: Nelson, loc. cit., says\n180 men were in the Fox, and of these 97 were lost. So Captain\nBrenton, Naval History, says 97. In vol. ii. p. 84, speaking of\nTrafalgar, he informs us that the French ship Indomptable (84),\nM. Hubart, was wrecked off Rota, where her crew, said to be 1,500 men,\nall perished. Add, ’except M. Maffiote, of Tenerife, and about\n143 others.’] Rear-Admiral Nelson lost his right arm before he could\ntouch ground, and was compelled to return to his flag-ship, with the\nother officers of his boat all badly wounded. [Footnote: The grape-shot\nwas fired from the Castle of San Pedro; others opine from San Cristobal;\nand the Canarese say that a splinter of stone did the work. According to\nmost authorities, Nelson was half-way up the mole. James declares that\nNelson’s elbow was struck by a shot as he was drawing his sword and\nstepping out of his boat. In Nelson’s Despatches, loc. cit., we\nread that the ’mole was instantly stormed and carried, although defended\nby 400 or 500 men, and the guns–six 24-pounders–were spiked; but such\na heavy fire of musketry and grape-shot was kept up from the citadel and\nhouses at the head of the mole that we could not advance, and nearly all\nwere killed.’] The brave Captain Bowen was killed on the first step of\nthe Mole, a volley of grape tearing away his stomach. [Footnote: This\nofficer is said to have caused the expedition, by describing it to\nAdmiral Jervis and the British Government as an easy exploit. He had\npreviously cut out of this bay a Philippine Island frigate, El\nPrincipe Fernando; and he had with him, as guide, a Chinese\nprisoner, taken in that vessel. The guide was also killed. Captain\nBowen’s family made some exertions to recover certain small articles\nwhich he carried about him–watch, pistols, &c.–and failed. One pistol\nwas lost, and for the other its possessor modestly demanded 14l.]\nNineteen other Englishmen were struck down by a discharge of grape. The\ngun which fired it had, on that same night, been placed by the governor\nof the Castle of San Cristobal, Don Josef Monteverde, [Footnote: There\nis a note in my volume, ’Father of the adopted son, Miguelito Morales.’]\nat a new embrasure which he caused to be opened in the flank of the\nbastion. [Footnote: This part of the castle has now been altered, and\nmounted with brass 80-pounders.]  Thus it commanded the landing-place,\nwhere before there was dead ground. The enemy afterwards confessed that\nthe injury thus done was the first cause of his misfortunes.",
        "’Notwithstanding the Rear-Admiral’s wound and the enemy’s loss in men\nand chief officers, a single boat, carrying Captain and Commodore\nTroubridge, covered by the smoke and the darkness, landed at the Caleta\n[Footnote: ’Caleta’ means literally a cul de sac. At Santa Cruz\nit is applied to a rocky tract near the Custom-house Battery: in those\ndays it was the place where goods were disembarked.]  beach. At the same\ntime the main body of the English, who had escaped the grape of the\nCastle of San Cristobal and the batteries La Concepcion and San Telmo,\ndisembarked a little further south, at the Barranquillo del Aceyte,\n[Footnote: This ditch is now built over and converted into a drain. It\nruns a little above the present omnibus stables.] at the Butcheries, and\nat the Barranco Santo. [Footnote: Also called de la Cassona–’of the\nDog-fish’–that animal being often caught in a charco, or pool,\nin the broad watercourse. So those baptised in the parish church are\npopularly said to have been ’dipped in the waters of the Dog-fish\nPool.’] The levies of Havana and Cuba, posted in the Butcheries under\nSecond Lieutenant Don Pedro de Castilla, being unable to repulse the\nenemy’s superior force, retreated upon the Battalion of Infantry of the\nCanaries, consisting of 260 men and officers, including the\nmilitia. This corps, supported by two field-guns, [Footnote: In the\noriginal ’canones violentos,’ i.e. 4-pounders, 6-pounders, or\n8-pounders.] ably and energetically worked by the pilots, Nicolas Franco\nand Josef Garcia, did such damage that the English were in turn\ncompelled to fall back upon the beaches of the Barranco and the\nButcheries.",
        "’These were the only places where the enemy was able to gain a footing\nin the town. He marched in two columns, one, with drums beating, by the\nlittle square of the parish church (La Concepcion) to the convent of\nSanto Domingo, [Footnote: Afterwards pulled down to make room for a\ntheatre and a market-place.] and the other to the Plaza [Footnote: Plaza\nhere means the square behind the castle. In other places it applies to\nthe fortified part of the town.] of the San Cristobal castle. His plan\nof attack was to occupy the latter post, but he was driven back from the\nportcullis after losing one officer by the hot fire of the\nmilitia-Captain Don Esteban Benitez de Lugo. Thus driven back to the\nCaleta, the invaders marched along the street called “de las Tiendas.\"\n[Footnote: It is now the ’Cruz Verde.’ In those days it was the\nprincipal street; the Galle del Castello (holding at present that rank)\nthen showed only scattered houses.] They then drew up at the head of the\nsquare, maintaining a silence which was not broken by nine guns\ndischarged at them by the Captain of Laguna Chasseurs Don Fernando del\nHoyo, nor by the aspect of the two field-pieces ranged in front of them\nby the Mayor, who was present at all the most important points in the\ncentre of the line. The cause was discovered in an order afterwards\nfound in the pocket of Lieut. Robinson, R.M. It ran to this\neffect:–[Footnote: This and other official documents are translated\ninto English from the Spanish. According to our naval despatches and\nhistories the senior marine officer who commanded the whole detachment\nwas Captain Thomas Oldfleld, R.M. The ’Relacion circumstanciada’\ndeclares that the original is in the hands of Don Bernardo Cologan y\nFablon, another Irish-Spanish gentleman who united valour and\npatriotism. He was seen traversing, sabre in hand, the most dangerous\nplaces, encouraging the men and attending to the wounded so zealously\nthat he parted even with his shirt for bandaging their hurts.]",

        "’Lieutenant Robinson, R.M.",
        "’Standing at the head of the square, the enemy could observe that not\nfar from them was a provision-store, guarded by Don Juan Casalon and Don\nAntonio Power, [Footnote: The original has it ’Pouver,’ a misprint. The\nIrish-Spanish family of Power is well known in the Canaries.] the two\n“deputies of Abastos.” [Footnote: Now called regidores–officers\nwho are charged with distributing rations.]  The English seized it,\nwounding Dons Patricio Power and Casalon, who, after receiving two blows\nwith an axe, escaped. They then obliged, under parole, the deputy Power\nand Don Luis Fonspertius to conduct into the Castle a sergeant sent to\nparly. Our Commandant-General, when summoned to surrender the town\nwithin two minutes, under pain of its being burned, returned an answer\nworthy of his honour and gallantry. “Such a proposal,” he remarked,\n“requires no reply,” and in proof thereof he ordered the party to be\ndetained. [Footnote: According to James, who follows Troubridge’s\nreport, the sergeant was shot in the streets and no answer was\nreceived.]",
        "’Meanwhile our militiamen harassed the first column of the enemy,\ncompelling it, by street-fighting, to form up in the little squares of\nSanto Domingo and of the parish church. Our Commandant-General was\nstartled when he found that this position cut off direct communication\nbetween San Cristobal and the Battalion of the Canaries, whose fire,\nlike that of the militiamen on the right, suddenly ceased. But he was\nassured that the battalion was unbroken, and all the central posts\nexcept the Mole were supported, by the report of Lieutenant Don Vicente\nSiera: this officer had just attacked with 30 men of that battalion the\nenemy’s boats as they lay grounded at the mouth of the Barranco Santo,\ndislodging the defenders, who had taken shelter behind them, and making\nfive prisoners. The English were stopped at the narrow way near the base\nof the pier by the hot fire of the troops under Captain and Adjutant of\nChasseurs Don Luis Roman, the nine militiamen under Don Francisco Jorva,\nthe sergeant of the guard Domingo Mendez, and a recruit of the Havana\nlevy; these made forty-four prisoners, including six officers, whilst\ntwelve were wounded. Our Commandant-General was presently put out of all\ndoubt by Don Josef Monteverde. This governor of San Cristobal, when\ninformed that 2,000 Englishmen had entered the town, intending probably\nto attack the Castle with the scaling-ladders brought from their boats,\nresolved himself to inspect the whole esplanade, and accordingly\nreconnoitred the front and flank of the Citadel.",
        "’All our advantages were well-nigh lost by a report which spread through\nthe garrison when our firing ceased. A cry arose that our chief was\nkilled, and that as the English who had taken the town were marching\nupon La Laguna, they must be intercepted at the cuesta, or hill,\nbehind Santa Cruz. It is easy to conceive what a panic such rumours\nwould cause among badly armed and half-drilled militia. The report arose\nthus:–Our Commandant-General seeing the defenders of the battery at the\nfoot of the Mole retreating, and hearing them cry, “Que nos cortan!” (We\nare cut off!), sallied out with Don Juan Creagh and other officers, the\nPort Captain, the Town Adjutant, and the chief collector of the\ntobacco-tax. After ordering the corps of Chasseurs, 89 men and 9\nofficers, to fire, our chief returned, leaning upon the arm of Don Juan\nCreagh, and some inconsiderate person thought that he was\nwounded. Fortunately this indiscretion went no further than the Chasseur\nBattalion of the Canaries and the militiamen on our right.",
        "’When this battalion was not wanted in its former position it was\nordered to the square behind the Citadel. The movement was effected\nabout daybreak by Don Manuel Salcedo, Lieutenant of the King.\n[Footnote: An old title (now changed) given to the military governor of\nSanta Cruz and the second highest authority in the archipelago. Marshal\nO’Donnell was Teniente del Rey at Tenerife, and he was born in a house\nfacing the cross in the main square of Santa Cruz.] That officer had\nnever left his corps, patrolling with it along the beaches where the\nenemy disembarked, and he had sent to the barracks twenty-six prisoners,\nbesides three whom he captured at San Cristobal. When the battalion was\nformed up and no enemy appeared, the Adjutant-Major enquired about them\nin a loud voice. Meanwhile the Laguna militia, who in two divisions,\neach of 120 men, under Lieut.-Col. Don Juan Baptista de Castro, had been\nposted from San Telmo to the Grariton, [Footnote: Meaning a large\ngarita, or sentry-box. It is a place near the windmills to the\nsouth of the town.] were also ordered to the main square. In two\nseparate parties they marched, one in direct line, the other by upper\nstreets, to cut off the enemy’s retreat and place him between two\nfires. As the latter, however, entered the little square of Santo\nDomingo, their commander, Lieut.-Col. de Castro, hearing a confusion of\ntongues, mistook for Spaniards and Frenchmen the English who were\nholding it. Thereupon the enemy fired a volley, which killed him and a\nmilitiaman and wounded many, whilst several were taken prisoners.",
        "’The attackers presently manned the windows of Santo Domingo, and kept\nup a hot fire against our militiamen. They then determined to send an\nofficer of marines to our Commandant-General, once more demanding the\nsurrender of the town under the threat of burning it. At the order of\nLieut.-Col. Don Juan Guinther the parliamentary was conducted to the\nCitadel by Captain Don Santiago Madan. Our chief replied only that the\ncity had still powder, ball, and fighting men.",
        "’Thereupon the affair recommenced. One battalion came up with two\nfield-guns to support its friends, and several militiamen died\nhonourably, exposing themselves to the fire of an entrenched enemy. Our\nposition was further reinforced by the militia-pickets that had been\nskirmishing in the streets, and by the greater part of those who,\ndeceived by a false report, had retired to the slopes of La Laguna.",
        "’Already it was morning, when a squadron of five armed boats was seen\nmaking for our right. Our brave artillerymen had not the patience to let\nthem approach, but at once directed at them a hot fire, especially from\nthe Mole battery, under Don Francisco Grandi. That officer, accompanied\nby the second constable, Manuel Troncos, had just passed from the\nCitadel [Footnote: La Ciudadela, to the north of the mole, is not built,\nas we read in Colburn (U. S. Magazine, January 1864), on an\nartificial wall. It has a moat, casemates, loopholes, and twelve\nbouches à feu for plunging fire. The lines will connect with La\nLaguna and complete the defences of the capital.] to the battery in\nquestion, and had removed the spikes driven into the guns by Citoyen\nFrançois Martiney when he saw them abandoned. [Footnote: The English\ndiary shows that the Spaniards had spiked the guns.] The principal\nCastle and the Mole batteries, supported by that of La Concepcion,\nrained a shower of grape at a long range with such precision that three\nboats were sunk and the two others fell back upon the squadron. At the\nsame time the Port Captain and Flag Officer of the frigate ordered his\nmen to knock out the bottoms of eighteen boats which the enemy after his\nattack had left on the beach.",
        "’The English posted in the convent, seeing the destruction of their\nreinforcements, lost heart and persuaded the prior, Fray Carlos de Lugo,\nand the master, Fray Juan de Iriarte, to bear another message to our\nchief. The officer commanding the enemy’s troops declared himself ready\nto respect the lives and property of those about him provided that the\nRoyal Treasury and that of the Philippine Company were surrendered,\notherwise that he could not answer for the consequences.",
        "’This deputation received the same laconic reply as those preceding\nit. Seeing the firmness of our Commandant-General and the crowds of\npeasantry gathering from all parts, the enemy’s courage was damped, and\nhis second in command, Captain Samuel Hood, came out to parley. This\nofficer, perceiving that the Militiamen who had joined the Chasseurs\nwere preparing to attack, signalled with a white flag a cessation of\nhostilities, and our men were restrained by the orders of Don Fernando\ndel Hoyo. Both parties advanced to the middle of the bridge, where they\nwere met by Lieutenant-Colonel Don Juan Guinther, commanding the\nBattalion of the Canaries, who could speak many languages, and by the\nAdjutant-Major, Don Juan Battaler. These officers also withheld their\nmen, who were opening fire as they turned the corner of the street in\nwhich, a little before, Don Rafael Fernandez, a sub-lieutenant of the\nsame corps, had fallen, shot through the body, whilst heading an attack\nupon the enemy.",
        "’With a white flag and drums beating, the English officer, accompanied\nby those who had already parleyed with our Commandant-General, marched\nto the citadel. At the bridge of the street “de las Tiendas” he was met\nby the Lieutenant of the King, by the Sergeant-Major of the town, by\nLieutenant-Colonel Creagh, by Captain Madan, carrying the flag of truce,\nand by the Town Adjutant, who conducted him with eyes bandaged to the\npresence of our chief. Captain Hood did not hesitate again to demand\nsurrender, which was curtly refused. This decision, and the chances of\ndestruction in case of hostilities continuing, made him alter his\ntone. At length both chiefs came to terms. The instrument was written by\nCaptain Hood, and was at once ratified by Captain Thomas Troubridge,\ncommanding H.B.M.’s troops. The following is a copy of the ’Terms\nagreed upon with the Governor of the Canary Islands.",

        "’When Captain Hood suddenly sighted his implacable enemies the French,\nhe gave way to an outbreak of rage and violent exclamations, and he even\nmade a proposal which might have renewed hostilities had he failed to\ngive prompt satisfaction. He presently confessed to having gone too far\nand renewed his protestations to keep the conditions of peace.",
        "’Boats and two brigantines (island craft) were got ready to receive the\nBritish troops at the Mole.

They hardly knew how to\nexpress their sense of a treatment so different from what they had\nexpected. During their cruise from Cadiz their officers, hoping to make\nthem fight the better, told them that the Canarians were a ferocious\nrace who never gave quarter to the conquered.",

They\nexcused themselves on the plea that they must look after their men, upon\nwhom the wine had taken a strong effect, and deferred it till the\nmorrow. They also offered to be the bearers of the tidings announcing\nour success and to carry to Spain all letters entrusted to their\ncare. Our chief did not hesitate to commit to their charge, under\nparole, his official despatches to the Crown; and all the correspondence\nwas couched in terms so ingenuous that even the enemy could not but\nadmire so much moderation.",

One division of\nforty peasants was placed under the Marquess del Prado and the Viscount\nde Buenpaso, who both, though not military men, hastened to the town\nwhen the attack was no longer doubtful.

He was prevented from so doing by the voices\nof the attacking party posted in the little place. He therefore retired\nto the upper part of the town, and took post on the Convent-flank.

        "’No circumstantial account of our remarkable success would be complete\nwithout recording, in the highest and the most grateful terms, the zeal\nwith which the very noble the Municipality (ayuntamiento) of\nTenerife took part in winning our laurels. Since July 22, when the first\nalarm-signal was made at Santa Cruz, Don Josef de Castilla, the Chief\nMagistrate (Corregidor), with the nobility and men at arms\n(armas-tomar) assembled in force on the main square of La Laguna\n(Plaza del Adelantado). The Mayor (Alcalde Mayor), Don\nVicente Ortiz de Rivera, presided over the court (cabildo), at\nwhich were present all those members (regidores) who were not\npersonally serving against the enemy. These were the town deputies, Don\nLopo de la Guerra, Don Josef Saviñon, Don Antonio Riquel, Don Cayetano\nPereza, Don Francisco Fernandez Bello, Don Miguel de Laisequilla, and\nDon Juan Fernandez Calderin, with the Deputy Syndic-General, Don Filipe\nCarillo. Their meetings were also attended by other gentlemen and\nunder-officers (curiales), who were told off to their\nrespective duties according to the order laid down for defending the\nIsland. After making a careful survey of the bread and provisions in the\nmarket, also of the wheat and flour in the bakeries and of the reserve\nstores, they promptly supplied the country-people who crowded into the\ncity. Wind being at this season wanting for the mills, we were greatly\nassisted by a cargo of 3,000 barrels of flour taken before Madeira from\nan Anglo-American prize by the Buonaparte, a French privateer, who\nbrought her to our port. This supply sufficed for the militia stationed\non the heights of Taganana, in the Valle Seco, near the streams of the\nPunta del Hidalgo, Texina, Baxamar, the Valley of San Andrés, and lastly\nthe line of Santa Cruz, Guadamogete, and Candelaria, whose posts cover\nmore than twenty-four miles of coast between the north-west and the\nsouth of the island.",

Meanwhile, at the application\nof the Municipality to the venerable Vicar Ecclesiastic, and to the\nparish priests and superiors of the community (prelados), prayers\nwere offered up in the churches, and certain of the clergy collected\nfrom the neighbouring houses lint and bandages for the wounded. The\nsoldiers in the Paso Alto and Valle Seco received 100 pairs of slippers,\nfor which our Commandant-General had indented. Many peasants who had\napplied for and obtained guns, knives, and other weapons from the Laguna\narmoury were sent off to defend the northern part of the island. On the\nmain road descending to Santa Cruz the Chief Magistrate planted a\nprovisional battery with two field-pieces belonging to the Court of\nAldermen.

These stood during the office at the church\ndoor, and saluted with three volleys the elevation of the host.

The court, retiring with\nequal ceremony, gave a brilliant banquet to the officers of the\nbattalion, to the chiefs of the provincial regiments of La Laguna and\nGuimar, and to all their illustrious compatriots who had taken part in\nthe contest. Volleys and band performances saluted the three loyal and\npatriotic toasts–\"the King,” “the Commandant-General,” and “the\nDefenders of the Country.” The town, in sign of jubilee, was illuminated\nfor several successive nights.",

The ceremony took place\nin the parish church of Santa Cruz, and was repeated in the cathedral of\nGrand Canary and in the churches and convents of the other islands. The\nEcclesiastical Court of Tenerife ordered the Chapter of Music to sing a\nsolemn Te Deum, at which the municipal body attended. On the next day a\nmass of thanksgiving was said, with exposition of the Holy Sacrament\nthroughout the day, and a sermon was preached by the canon superior, Don\nJosef Icaza Cabrexas. Lastly, a very solemn funeral function, with\nmagnificent display, did due honour to their memory who for their\ncountry’s good had laid down their lives.’ Mrs. Elizabeth Murray, wife\nof H.B.M.’s Consul for Tenerife and author of an amusing book,\n[Footnote: Sixteen Years of an Artist’s Life in Morocco,\n&c. Hurst and Blackett, 1859. I quote from vol. i. chap. iv.] adds\ncertain local details concerning Nelson’s ill-fated attack. It is boldly\nstated that during the rash affair the Commandant-General and his staff\nremained safely inside the Castle of San Cristobal, and that when the\nEnglish forces captured the monastery the Spanish authorities resolved\nto surrender. This step was opposed by a sergeant, Manoel Cuera, who,\n’with more familiarity than is usual when soldiers are separated so far\nby their respective ranks, placed his hand upon the shoulder of his\ncommanding officer and said, “No, your Excellency, you shall not give up\nthe Plaza; we are not yet reduced to such a strait as that.\"’  Whereupon\nthe General, ’assuming his usual courage, followed his sergeant’s\nadvice, and continued the engagement till it was brought to a\ntermination equally honourable to Englishmen and Spaniards.’",
        "Mrs. Murray also declares that Captain Troubridge, when invested in the\nmonastery by superior numbers, placed before his men a line of\nprisoners, and that these being persons of influence, the assailants\nfired high; moreover that Colonel M(onteverde?), the commander of the\nisland troops, was an Italian who spoke bad Spanish, and kept shouting\nto his men, ’Condanate vois a matar a la Santisima Trinitate!’ The\nofficer sent to parley (Captain Hood) was, we are told, accompanied to\nthe citadel by a gentleman named Murphy, whom the English had taken\nprisoner. A panic (before mentioned) came from three militia officers,\nwho, mounting a single animal, rode off to La Laguna, assuring the\ncabildo and the townspeople that Santa Cruz had fallen. One of\nthis ’valiant triumvirate’ had succeeded to a large property on\ncondition of never disgracing his name, and after the flight he had the\ngrace to offer it to a younger brother who had distinguished himself in\nSouth America. The junior told him not to be a fool, and the property\nwas left to the proprietor’s children, ’his grandson being in possession\nof it at the present day.’",
        "The chapter ends with the fate of one O’Rooney, a merchant’s clerk who\ncast his lot with the Spaniards, and whom General Gutierrez sent with an\norder to the commandant of Paso Alto Fort. Being in liquor, he took the\nMarina, or shortest road; and, when questioned by the enemy, at once\ntold his errand. ’In those days and in such circumstances,’ writes the\nlively lady, ’soldiers were very speedy in their decisions, and the\nmarine who had challenged O’Rooney at once bayonetted him, while his\ncomrade rifled his pockets and appropriated his clothes.’",
        "Remains only to state that the colours of the unfortunate cutter\nFox and her boats are still in the chapel of Sant’ Iago, on the\nleft side of the Santa Cruz parish church, La Concepcion. Planted\nagainst the wall flanking the cross, in long coffin-like cases with\nglass fronts, they have been the object of marked attention on the part\nof sundry British middies.
