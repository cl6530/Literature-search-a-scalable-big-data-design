        "    Jehuda Halevi.–Charizi.",
        "Turning once more to the brighter condition of Jewish literature in\nSpain, we reach a man upon whom the whole vocabulary of praise and\naffection has been exhausted; a man of magnetic attractiveness, whom\ncontemporaries and successors have agreed to admire and to love. Jehuda\nHalevi was born in Toledo about 1085, the year in which Alfonso VI\nrecaptured the city from the Moors. It was a fit birth-place for the\ngreatest Jewish poet since Bible times. East and West met in Toledo. The\nscience of the East there found Western Christians to cultivate it. Jew,\nMoor, and Christian displayed there mutual toleration which existed\nnowhere else. In the midst of this favorable environment Jehuda Halevi\ngrew to early maturity. As a boy he won more than local fame as a\nversifier. At all festive occasions his verses were in demand. He wrote\nwedding odes, elegies on great men, eulogies of the living. His love\npoems, serenades, epigrams of this period, all display taste, elegance,\nand passion.",
        "The second period of Jehuda Halevi’s literary career was devoted to\nserious pursuits, to thoughts about life, and to practical work. He\nwrote his far-famed philosophical dialogue, the Cuzari, and earned his\nliving as a physician. He was not an enthusiastic devotee to medicine,\nhowever. “Toledo is large,” he wrote to a friend, “and my patients are\nhard masters. I, their slave, spend my days in serving their will, and\nconsume my years in healing their infirmities.” Before making up a\nprescription, he, like Sir Thomas Browne, used to say a prayer in which\nhe confessed that he had no great faith in the healing powers of his\nart. Jehuda Halevi was, indeed, dissatisfied with his life altogether.\n“My heart is in the East, but I am sunk in the West,” he lamented. He\nwas unhappy because his beloved was far from him; his lady-love was\nbeyond the reach of his earnest gaze. In Heine’s oft-quoted words,",
        "    She for whom the Rabbi languished\n    Was a woe-begone poor darling,\n    Desolation’s very image,\n    And her name–Jerusalem.",
        "The eager passion for one sight of Jerusalem grew on him, and dominated\nthe third portion of his life. At length nothing could restrain him; go\nhe would, though he die in the effort. And go he did, and die he did in\nthe effort. The news of his determination spread through Spain, and\neverywhere hands were held out to restrain him. But his heart lightened\nas the day of departure came. His poems written at this time are hopeful\nand full of cheery feeling. In Egypt, a determined attempt was made by\nthe Jews to keep him among them. But it was vain. Onward to Jerusalem:\nthis was his one thought. He tarried in Egypt but a short while, then he\npassed to Tyre and Damascus. At Damascus, in the year 1140 or\nthereabouts, he wrote the ode to Zion which made his name immortal, an\node in which he gave vent to all the intense passion which filled his\nsoul. The following are some stanzas taken from this address to\nJerusalem:",
        "    The glory of the Lord has been alway\n    Thy sole and perfect light;\n    Thou needest not the sun to shine by day,\n    Nor moon and stars to illumine thee by night.\n    I would that, where God’s spirit was of yore\n    Poured out unto thy holy ones, I might\n    There too my soul outpour!\n    The house of kings and throne of God wert thou,\n    How comes it then that now\n    Slaves fill the throne where sat thy kings before?",
        "    Oh! who will lead me on\n    To seek the spots where, in far distant years,\n    The angels in their glory dawned upon\n    Thy messengers and seers?",
        "    Oh! who will give me wings\n    That I may fly away,\n    And there, at rest from all my wanderings,\n    The ruins of my heart among thy ruins lay?",
        "    The Lord desires thee for his dwelling-place\n    Eternally, and bless’d\n    Is he whom God has chosen for the grace\n    Within thy courts to rest.\n    Happy is he that watches, drawing near,\n    Until he sees thy glorious lights arise,\n    And over whom thy dawn breaks full and clear\n    Set in the orient skies.\n    But happiest he, who, with exultant eyes,\n    The bliss of thy redeemed ones shall behold,\n    And see thy youth renewed as in the days of old.",
        "Soon after writing this Jehuda arrived near the Holy City. He was by her\nside at last, by the side of his beloved. Then, legend tells us, through\na gate an Arab horseman dashed forth: he raised his spear, and slew the\npoet, who fell at the threshold of his dear Jerusalem, with a song of\nZion on his lips.",
        "The new-Hebrew poetry did not survive him. Persecution froze the current\nof the Jewish soul. Poets, indeed, arose after Jehuda Halevi in Germany\nas in Spain. Sometimes, as in the hymns of the “German” Meir of\nRothenburg, a high level of passionate piety is reached. But it has well\nbeen said that “the hymns of the Spanish writers link man’s soul to his\nMaker: the hymns of the Germans link Israel to his God.” Only in Spain\nHebrew poetry was universal, in the sense in which the Psalms are\nuniversal. Even in Spain itself, the death of Jehuda Halevi marked the\nclose of this higher inspiration. The later Spanish poets, Charizi and\nZabara (middle and end of the twelfth century), were satirists rather\nthan poets, witty, sparkling, ready with quaint quips, but local and\nimitative in manner and subject. Zabara must receive some further notice\nin a later chapter because of his connection with medieval folk-lore. Of\nCharizi’s chief work, the Tachkemoni, it may be said that it is\nexcellent of its type. The stories which it tells in unmetrical rhyme\nare told in racy style, and its criticisms on men and things are clever\nand striking. As a literary critic also Charizi ranks high, and there is\nmuch skill in the manner in which he links together, round the person of\nhis hero, the various narratives which compose the Tachkemoni. The\nexperiences he relates are full of humor and surprises. As a\nphrase-maker, Charizi was peculiarly happy, his command of Hebrew being\nmasterly. But his most conspicuous claim to high rank lies in his\norigination of that blending of grim irony with bright wit which became\ncharacteristic of all Jewish humorists, and reached its climax in Heine.\nBut Charizi himself felt that his art as a Hebrew poet was decadent.\nGreat poets of Jewish race have risen since, but the songs they have\nsung have not been songs of Zion, and the language of their muse has not\nbeen the language of the Hebrew Bible.",
