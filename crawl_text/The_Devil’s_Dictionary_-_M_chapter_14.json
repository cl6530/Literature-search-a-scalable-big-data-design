        "MACE, n.  A staff of office signifying authority.  Its form, that of a \nheavy club, indicates its original purpose and use in dissuading from \ndissent.",
        "MACHINATION, n.  The method employed by one’s opponents in baffling \none’s open and honorable efforts to do the right thing.",
        "  So plain the advantages of machination\n  It constitutes a moral obligation,\n  And honest wolves who think upon’t with loathing\n  Feel bound to don the sheep’s deceptive clothing.\n  So prospers still the diplomatic art,\n  And Satan bows, with hand upon his heart.",
        "R.S.K.",
        "\nMACROBIAN, n.  One forgotten of the gods and living to a great age.  \nHistory is abundantly supplied with examples, from Methuselah to Old \nParr, but some notable instances of longevity are less well known.  A \nCalabrian peasant named Coloni, born in 1753, lived so long that he \nhad what he considered a glimpse of the dawn of universal peace.  \nScanavius relates that he knew an archbishop who was so old that he \ncould remember a time when he did not deserve hanging.  In 1566 a \nlinen draper of Bristol, England, declared that he had lived five \nhundred years, and that in all that time he had never told a lie.  \nThere are instances of longevity (macrobiosis) in our own country.  \nSenator Chauncey Depew is old enough to know better.  The editor of \nThe American, a newspaper in New York City, has a memory that goes \nback to the time when he was a rascal, but not to the fact.  The \nPresident of the United States was born so long ago that many of the \nfriends of his youth have risen to high political and military \npreferment without the assistance of personal merit.  The verses \nfollowing were written by a macrobian:",
        "  When I was young the world was fair\n      And amiable and sunny.\n  A brightness was in all the air,\n      In all the waters, honey.\n      The jokes were fine and funny,\n  The statesmen honest in their views,\n      And in their lives, as well,\n  And when you heard a bit of news\n      ’Twas true enough to tell.\n  Men were not ranting, shouting, reeking,\n  Nor women “generally speaking.”",
        "  The Summer then was long indeed:\n      It lasted one whole season!\n  The sparkling Winter gave no heed\n      When ordered by Unreason\n      To bring the early peas on.\n  Now, where the dickens is the sense\n      In calling that a year\n  Which does no more than just commence\n      Before the end is near?\n  When I was young the year extended\n  From month to month until it ended.\n  I know not why the world has changed\n      To something dark and dreary,\n  And everything is now arranged\n      To make a fellow weary.\n      The Weather Man — I fear he\n  Has much to do with it, for, sure,\n      The air is not the same:\n  It chokes you when it is impure,\n      When pure it makes you lame.\n  With windows closed you are asthmatic;\n  Open, neuralgic or sciatic.",
        "  Well, I suppose this new regime\n      Of dun degeneration\n  Seems eviler than it would seem\n      To a better observation,\n      And has for compensation\n  Some blessings in a deep disguise\n      Which mortal sight has failed\n  To pierce, although to angels’ eyes\n      They’re visible unveiled.\n  If Age is such a boon, good land!\n  He’s costumed by a master hand!",
        "Venable Strigg",
        "\nMAD, adj.  Affected with a high degree of intellectual independence; \nnot conforming to standards of thought, speech and action derived by \nthe conformants from study of themselves; at odds with the majority; \nin short, unusual.  It is noteworthy that persons are pronounced mad \nby officials destitute of evidence that themselves are sane.  For \nillustration, this present (and illustrious) lexicographer is no \nfirmer in the faith of his own sanity than is any inmate of any \nmadhouse in the land; yet for aught he knows to the contrary, instead \nof the lofty occupation that seems to him to be engaging his powers he \nmay really be beating his hands against the window bars of an asylum \nand declaring himself Noah Webster, to the innocent delight of many \nthoughtless spectators.",
        "MAGDALENE, n.  An inhabitant of Magdala.  Popularly, a woman found \nout.  This definition of the word has the authority of ignorance, Mary \nof Magdala being another person than the penitent woman mentioned by \nSt. Luke.  It has also the official sanction of the governments of \nGreat Britain and the United States.  In England the word is \npronounced Maudlin, whence maudlin, adjective, unpleasantly \nsentimental.  With their Maudlin for Magdalene, and their Bedlam for \nBethlehem, the English may justly boast themselves the greatest of \nrevisers.",
        "MAGIC, n.  An art of converting superstition into coin.  There are \nother arts serving the same high purpose, but the discreet \nlexicographer does not name them.",
        "MAGNET, n.  Something acted upon by magnetism.",
        "MAGNETISM, n.  Something acting upon a magnet.\n  The two definitions immediately foregoing are condensed from the \nworks of one thousand eminent scientists, who have illuminated the \nsubject with a great white light, to the inexpressible advancement of \nhuman knowledge.",
        "MAGNIFICENT, adj.  Having a grandeur or splendor superior to that to \nwhich the spectator is accustomed, as the ears of an ass, to a rabbit, \nor the glory of a glowworm, to a maggot.",
        "MAGNITUDE, n.  Size.  Magnitude being purely relative, nothing is \nlarge and nothing small.  If everything in the universe were increased \nin bulk one thousand diameters nothing would be any larger than it was \nbefore, but if one thing remain unchanged all the others would be \nlarger than they had been.  To an understanding familiar with the \nrelativity of magnitude and distance the spaces and masses of the \nastronomer would be no more impressive than those of the microscopist.  \nFor anything we know to the contrary, the visible universe may be a \nsmall part of an atom, with its component ions, floating in the life- \nfluid (luminiferous ether) of some animal.  Possibly the wee creatures \npeopling the corpuscles of our own blood are overcome with the proper \nemotion when contemplating the unthinkable distance from one of these \nto another.",
        "MAGPIE, n.  A bird whose thievish disposition suggested to someone \nthat it might be taught to talk.",
        "MAIDEN, n.  A young person of the unfair sex addicted to clewless \nconduct and views that madden to crime.  The genus has a wide \ngeographical distribution, being found wherever sought and deplored \nwherever found.  The maiden is not altogether unpleasing to the eye, \nnor (without her piano and her views) insupportable to the ear, though \nin respect to comeliness distinctly inferior to the rainbow, and, with \nregard to the part of her that is audible, bleating out of the field \nby the canary — which, also, is more portable.",
        "  A lovelorn maiden she sat and sang —\n      This quaint, sweet song sang she;\n  “It’s O for a youth with a football bang\n      And a muscle fair to see!\n              The Captain he\n              Of a team to be!\n  On the gridiron he shall shine,\n  A monarch by right divine,\n      And never to roast on it — me!”",
        "Opoline Jones",
        "\nMAJESTY, n.  The state and title of a king.  Regarded with a just \ncontempt by the Most Eminent Grand Masters, Grand Chancellors, Great \nIncohonees and Imperial Potentates of the ancient and honorable orders \nof republican America.",
        "MALE, n.  A member of the unconsidered, or negligible sex.  The male \nof the human race is commonly known (to the female) as Mere Man.  The \ngenus has two varieties:  good providers and bad providers.",
        "MALEFACTOR, n.  The chief factor in the progress of the human race.",
        "MALTHUSIAN, adj.  Pertaining to Malthus and his doctrines.  Malthus \nbelieved in artificially limiting population, but found that it could \nnot be done by talking.  One of the most practical exponents of the \nMalthusian idea was Herod of Judea, though all the famous soldiers \nhave been of the same way of thinking.",
        "MAMMALIA, n.pl.  A family of vertebrate animals whose females in a \nstate of nature suckle their young, but when civilized and enlightened \nput them out to nurse, or use the bottle.",
        "MAMMON, n.  The god of the world’s leading religion.  The chief temple \nis in the holy city of New York.",
        "  He swore that all other religions were gammon,\n  And wore out his knees in the worship of Mammon.",
        "Jared Oopf",
        "\nMAN, n.  An animal so lost in rapturous contemplation of what he \nthinks he is as to overlook what he indubitably ought to be.  His \nchief occupation is extermination of other animals and his own \nspecies, which, however, multiplies with such insistent rapidity as to \ninfest the whole habitable earh and Canada.",
        "  When the world was young and Man was new,\n      And everything was pleasant,\n  Distinctions Nature never drew\n      ’Mongst kings and priest and peasant.\n      We’re not that way at present,\n  Save here in this Republic, where\n      We have that old regime,\n  For all are kings, however bare\n      Their backs, howe’er extreme\n  Their hunger.  And, indeed, each has a voice\n  To accept the tyrant of his party’s choice.",
        "  A citizen who would not vote,\n      And, therefore, was detested,\n  Was one day with a tarry coat\n      (With feathers backed and breasted)\n      By patriots invested.\n  “It is your duty,” cried the crowd,\n      “Your ballot true to cast\n  For the man o’ your choice.”  He humbly bowed,\n      And explained his wicked past:\n  “That’s what I very gladly would have done,\n  Dear patriots, but he has never run.”",
        "Apperton Duke",
        "\nMANES, n.  The immortal parts of dead Greeks and Romans.  They were in \na state of dull discomfort until the bodies from which they had \nexhaled were buried and burned; and they seem not to have been \nparticularly happy afterward.",
        "MANICHEISM, n.  The ancient Persian doctrine of an incessant warfare \nbetween Good and Evil.  When Good gave up the fight the Persians \njoined the victorious Opposition.",
        "MANNA, n.  A food miraculously given to the Israelites in the \nwilderness.  When it was no longer supplied to them they settled \ndown and tilled the soil, fertilizing it, as a rule, with the bodies \nof the original occupants.",
        "MARRIAGE, n.  The state or condition of a community consisting of a \nmaster, a mistress and two slaves, making in all, two.",
        "MARTYR, n.  One who moves along the line of least reluctance to a \ndesired death.",
        "MATERIAL, adj.  Having an actual existence, as distinguished from an \nimaginary one.  Important.",
        "  Material things I know, or fell, or see;\n  All else is immaterial to me.",
        "Jamrach Holobom",
        "\nMAUSOLEUM, n.  The final and funniest folly of the rich.",
        "MAYONNAISE, n.  One of the sauces which serve the French in place of a \nstate religion.",
        "ME, pro.  The objectionable case of I.  The personal pronoun in \nEnglish has three cases, the dominative, the objectionable and the \noppressive.  Each is all three.",
        "MEANDER, n.  To proceed sinuously and aimlessly.  The word is the \nancient name of a river about one hundred and fifty miles south of \nTroy, which turned and twisted in the effort to get out of hearing \nwhen the Greeks and Trojans boasted of their prowess.",
        "MEDAL, n.  A small metal disk given as a reward for virtues, \nattainments or services more or less authentic.\n  It is related of Bismark, who had been awarded a medal for \ngallantly rescuing a drowning person, that, being asked the meaning of \nthe medal, he replied:  “I save lives sometimes.”  And sometimes he \ndidn’t.",

        "MEEKNESS, n.  Uncommon patience in planning a revenge that is worth \nwhile.",
        "  M is for Moses,\n      Who slew the Egyptian.\n  As sweet as a rose is\n  The meekness of Moses.\n  No monument shows his\n      Post-mortem inscription,\n  But M is for Moses\n      Who slew the Egyptian.",
        "The Biographical Alphabet",
        "MEERSCHAUM, n.  (Literally, seafoam, and by many erroneously supposed \nto be made of it.)  A fine white clay, which for convenience in \ncoloring it brown is made into tobacco pipes and smoked by the workmen \nengaged in that industry.  The purpose of coloring it has not been \ndisclosed by the manufacturers.",
        "  There was a youth (you’ve heard before,\n      This woeful tale, may be),\n  Who bought a meerschaum pipe and swore\n      That color it would he!",
        "  He shut himself from the world away,\n      Nor any soul he saw.\n  He smoke by night, he smoked by day,\n      As hard as he could draw.",
        "  His dog died moaning in the wrath\n      Of winds that blew aloof;\n  The weeds were in the gravel path,\n      The owl was on the roof.",

        "MIND, n.  A mysterious form of matter secreted by the brain.  Its \nchief activity consists in the endeavor to ascertain its own nature, \nthe futility of the attempt being due to the fact that it has nothing \nbut itself to know itself with.  From the Latin mens, a fact unknown \nto that honest shoe-seller, who, observing that his learned competitor \nover the way had displayed the motto “Mens conscia recti,” \nemblazoned his own front with the words “Men’s, women’s and children’s \nconscia recti.”",
        "MINE, adj.  Belonging to me if I can hold or seize it.",
        "MINISTER, n.  An agent of a higher power with a lower responsibility.  \nIn diplomacy and officer sent into a foreign country as the visible \nembodiment of his sovereign’s hostility.  His principal qualification \nis a degree of plausible inveracity next below that of an ambassador.",

        "MISCREANT, n.  A person of the highest degree of unworth.  \nEtymologically, the word means unbeliever, and its present \nsignification may be regarded as theology’s noblest contribution to \nthe development of our language.",
        "MISDEMEANOR, n.  An infraction of the law having less dignity than a \nfelony and constituting no claim to admittance into the best criminal \nsociety.",
        "  By misdemeanors he essays to climb\n  Into the aristocracy of crime.\n  O, woe was him! — with manner chill and grand\n  “Captains of industry” refused his hand,\n  “Kings of finance” denied him recognition\n  And “railway magnates” jeered his low condition.\n  He robbed a bank to make himself respected.\n  They still rebuffed him, for he was detected.",

        "MISFORTUNE, n.  The kind of fortune that never misses.",
        "MISS, n.  The title with which we brand unmarried women to indicate \nthat they are in the market.  Miss, Missis (Mrs.) and Mister (Mr.) are \nthe three most distinctly disagreeable words in the language, in sound \nand sense.  Two are corruptions of Mistress, the other of Master.  In \nthe general abolition of social titles in this our country they \nmiraculously escaped to plague us.  If we must have them let us be \nconsistent and give one to the unmarried man.  I venture to suggest \nMush, abbreviated to Mh.",
        "MOLECULE, n.  The ultimate, indivisible unit of matter.  It is \ndistinguished from the corpuscle, also the ultimate, indivisible unit \nof matter, by a closer resemblance to the atom, also the ultimate, \nindivisible unit of matter.  Three great scientific theories of the \nstructure of the universe are the molecular, the corpuscular and the \natomic.  A fourth affirms, with Haeckel, the condensation of \nprecipitation of matter from ether — whose existence is proved by the \ncondensation of precipitation.  The present trend of scientific \nthought is toward the theory of ions.  The ion differs from the \nmolecule, the corpuscle and the atom in that it is an ion.  A fifth \ntheory is held by idiots, but it is doubtful if they know any more \nabout the matter than the others.",
        "MONAD, n.  The ultimate, indivisible unit of matter.  (See \nMolecule.)  According to Leibnitz, as nearly as he seems willing to \nbe understood, the monad has body without bulk, and mind without \nmanifestation — Leibnitz knows him by the innate power of \nconsidering.  He has founded upon him a theory of the universe, which \nthe creature bears without resentment, for the monad is a gentlmean.  \nSmall as he is, the monad contains all the powers and possibilities \nneedful to his evolution into a German philosopher of the first class \n— altogether a very capable little fellow.  He is not to be \nconfounded with the microbe, or bacillus; by its inability to discern \nhim, a good microscope shows him to be of an entirely distinct \nspecies.",
        "MONARCH, n.  A person engaged in reigning.  Formerly the monarch \nruled, as the derivation of the word attests, and as many subjects \nhave had occasion to learn.  In Russia and the Orient the monarch has \nstill a considerable influence in public affairs and in the \ndisposition of the human head, but in western Europe political \nadministration is mostly entrusted to his ministers, he being \nsomewhat preoccupied with reflections relating to the status of his \nown head.",
        "MONARCHICAL GOVERNMENT, n.  Government.",
        "MONDAY, n.  In Christian countries, the day after the baseball game.",
        "MONEY, n.  A blessing that is of no advantage to us excepting when we \npart with it.  An evidence of culture and a passport to polite \nsociety.  Supportable property.",
        "MONKEY, n.  An arboreal animal which makes itself at home in \ngenealogical trees.",
        "MONOSYLLABIC, adj.  Composed of words of one syllable, for literary \nbabes who never tire of testifying their delight in the vapid compound \nby appropriate googoogling.  The words are commonly Saxon — that is \nto say, words of a barbarous people destitute of ideas and incapable \nof any but the most elementary sentiments and emotions.",
        "  The man who writes in Saxon\n  Is the man to use an ax on",
        "Judibras",
        "\nMONSIGNOR, n.  A high ecclesiastical title, of which the Founder of \nour religion overlooked the advantages.",
        "MONUMENT, n.  A structure intended to commemorate something which \neither needs no commemoration or cannot be commemorated.",
        "  The bones of Agammemnon are a show,\n  And ruined is his royal monument,",
        "but Agammemnon’s fame suffers no diminution in consequence.  The \nmonument custom has its reductiones ad absurdum in monuments “to the \nunknown dead” — that is to say, monuments to perpetuate the memory of \nthose who have left no memory.",
        "MORAL, adj.  Conforming to a local and mutable standard of right.  \nHaving the quality of general expediency.",
        "      It is sayd there be a raunge of mountaynes in the Easte, on \none syde of the which certayn conducts are immorall, yet on the other \nsyde they are holden in good esteeme; wherebye the mountayneer is much \nconveenyenced, for it is given to him to goe downe eyther way and act \nas it shall suite his moode, withouten offence.",
        "Gooke’s Meditations",
        "\nMORE, adj.  The comparative degree of too much.",
        "MOUSE, n.  An animal which strews its path with fainting women.  As in \nRome Christians were thrown to the lions, so centuries earlier in \nOtumwee, the most ancient and famous city of the world, female \nheretics were thrown to the mice.  Jakak-Zotp, the historian, the only \nOtumwump whose writings have descended to us, says that these martyrs \nmet their death with little dignity and much exertion.  He even \nattempts to exculpate the mice (such is the malice of bigotry) by \ndeclaring that the unfortunate women perished, some from exhaustion, \nsome of broken necks from falling over their own feet, and some from \nlack of restoratives.  The mice, he avers, enjoyed the pleasures of \nthe chase with composure.  But if “Roman history is nine-tenths \nlying,” we can hardly expect a smaller proportion of that rhetorical \nfigure in the annals of a people capable of so incredible cruelty to a \nlovely women; for a hard heart has a false tongue.",
        "MOUSQUETAIRE, n.  A long glove covering a part of the arm.  Worn in \nNew Jersey.  But “mousquetaire” is a might poor way to spell \nmuskeeter.",
        "MOUTH, n.  In man, the gateway to the soul; in woman, the outlet of \nthe heart.",
        "MUGWUMP, n.  In politics one afflicted with self-respect and addicted \nto the vice of independence.  A term of contempt.",
        "MULATTO, n.  A child of two races, ashamed of both.",
        "MULTITUDE, n.  A crowd; the source of political wisdom and virtue.  In \na republic, the object of the statesman’s adoration.  “In a multitude \nof consellors there is wisdom,” saith the proverb.  If many men of \nequal individual wisdom are wiser than any one of them, it must be \nthat they acquire the excess of wisdom by the mere act of getting \ntogether.  Whence comes it?  Obviously from nowhere — as well say \nthat a range of mountains is higher than the single mountains \ncomposing it.  A multitude is as wise as its wisest member if it obey \nhim; if not, it is no wiser than its most foolish.",
        "MUMMY, n.  An ancient Egyptian, formerly in universal use among modern \ncivilized nations as medicine, and now engaged in supplying art with \nan excellent pigment.  He is handy, too, in museums in gratifying the \nvulgar curiosity that serves to distinguish man from the lower \nanimals.",
        "  By means of the Mummy, mankind, it is said,\n  Attests to the gods its respect for the dead.\n  We plunder his tomb, be he sinner or saint,\n  Distil him for physic and grind him for paint,\n  Exhibit for money his poor, shrunken frame,\n  And with levity flock to the scene of the shame.\n  O, tell me, ye gods, for the use of my rhyme:\n  For respecting the dead what’s the limit of time?",
        "Scopas Brune",
        "\nMUSTANG, n.  An indocile horse of the western plains.  In English \nsociety, the American wife of an English nobleman.",
        "MYRMIDON, n.  A follower of Achilles — particularly when he didn’t \nlead.",
        "MYTHOLOGY, n.  The body of a primitive people’s beliefs concerning its \norigin, early history, heroes, deities and so forth, as distinguished \nfrom the true accounts which it invents later.",
