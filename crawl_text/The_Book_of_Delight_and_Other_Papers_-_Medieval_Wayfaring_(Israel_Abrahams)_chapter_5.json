        "Men leave their homes because they must, or because they will. The Hebrew\nhas experienced both motives for travelling. Irresistibly driven on by his\nown destiny and by the pressure of his fellow-men, the Jew was also gifted\nwith a double share of that curiosity and restlessness which often send men\nforth of their own free will on long and arduous journeys. He has thus\nplayed the part of the Wandering Jew from choice and from necessity. He\nloved to live in the whole world, and the whole world met him by refusing\nhim a single spot that he might call his very own.",
        "  Tribes of the wandering foot and weary breast,\n  How shall ye flee away and be at rest!\n  The wild-dove hath her nest, the fox her cave,\n  Mankind their country,–Israel but the grave!",
        "A sad chapter of medieval history is filled with the enforced wanderings of\nthe sons of Israel. The lawgiver prophesied well, “There shall be no rest\nfor the sole of thy foot.” But we are not concerned here with the victim of\nexpulsion and persecution. The wayfarer with whom we shall deal is the\ntraveller, and not the exile. He was moved by no caprice but his own. He\nwill excite our admiration, perhaps our sympathy, only rarely our tears.",
        "My subject, be it remembered, is not wayfarers, but wayfaring. Hence I am\nto tell you not the story of particular travellers, but the manner of their\ntravelling, the conditions under which they moved. Before leaving home, a\nJewish wayfarer of the Middle Ages was bound to procure two kinds of\npassport. In no country in those days was freedom of motion allowed to\nanyone. The Jew was simply a little more hampered than others. In England,\nthe Jew paid a feudal fine before he might cross the seas. In Spain, the\nsystem of exactions was very complete. No Jew could change his residence\nwithout a license even within his own town. But in addition to the\ninflictions of the Government, the Jews enacted voluntary laws of their\nown, forcing their brethren to obtain a congregational permit before\nstarting.",
        "The reasons for this restriction were simple. In the first place, no Jew\ncould be allowed to depart at will, and leave the whole burden of the royal\ntaxes on the shoulders of those who were left behind. Hence, in many parts\nof Europe and Asia, no Jew could leave without the express consent of the\ncongregation. Even when he received the consent, it was usually on the\nunderstanding that he would continue, in his absence, to pay his share of\nthe communal dues. Sometimes even women were included in this law, as, for\ninstance, if the daughter of a resident Jew married and settled elsewhere,\nshe was forced to contribute to the taxes of her native town a sum\nproportionate to her dowry, unless she emigrated to Palestine, in which\ncase she was free. A further cause why Jews placed restrictions on free\nmovement was moral and commercial. Announcements had to be made in the\nsynagogue informing the congregation that so-and-so was on the point of\ndeparture, and anyone with claims against him could obtain satisfaction. No\nclandestine or unauthorized departure was permissible. It must not be\nthought that these communal licenses were of no service to the traveller.\nOn the contrary, they often assured him a welcome in the next town, and in\nPersia were as good as a safe-conduct. No Mohammedan would have dared defy\nthe travelling order sealed by the Jewish Patriarch.",
        "Having obtained his two licenses, one from the Government and the other\nfrom the Synagogue, the traveller would have to consider his costume.\n“Dress shabbily” was the general Jewish maxim for the tourist. How\nnecessary this rule was, may be seen from what happened to Rabbi Petachiah,\nwho travelled from Prague to Nineveh, in 1175, or thereabouts. At Nineveh\nhe fell sick, and the king’s physicians attended him and pronounced his\ndeath certain. Now Petachiah had travelled in most costly attire, and in\nPersia the rule was that if a Jewish traveller died, the physicians took\nhalf his property. Petachiah saw through the real danger that threatened\nhim, so he escaped from the perilous ministrations of the royal doctors,\nhad himself carried across the Tigris on a raft, and soon recovered.\nClearly, it was imprudent of a Jewish traveller to excite the rapacity of\nkings or bandits by wearing rich dresses. But it was also desirable for the\nJew, if he could, to evade recognition as such altogether. Jewish opinion\nwas very sensible on this head. It did not forbid a Jew’s disguising\nhimself even as a priest of the Church, joining a caravan, and mumbling\nLatin hymns. In times of danger, he might, to save his life, don the turban\nand pass as a Mohammedan even in his home. Most remarkable concession of\nall, the Jewess on a journey might wear the dress of a man. The law of the\nland was equally open to reason. In Spain, the Jew was allowed to discard\nhis yellow badge while travelling; in Germany, he had the same privilege,\nbut he had to pay a premium for it. In some parts, the Jewish community as\na whole bought the right to travel and to discard the badge on journeys,\npaying a lump sum for the general privilege, and itself exacting a communal\ntax to defray the general cost. In Rome, the traveller was allowed to lodge\nfor ten days before resuming his hated badge. But, curiously enough, the\nlegal relaxation concerning the badge was not extended to the markets. The\nJew made the medieval markets, yet he was treated as an unwelcome guest, a\ncommodity to be taxed. This was especially so in Germany. In 1226, Bishop\nLorenz, of Breslau, ordered Jews who passed through his domain to pay the\nsame toll as slaves brought to market. The visiting Jew paid toll for\neverything; but he got part of his money back. He received a yellow badge,\nwhich he was forced to wear during his whole stay at the market, the\nfinances of which he enriched, indirectly by his trade, and directly by his\nhuge contributions to the local taxes.",
        "The Jewish traveller mostly left his wife at home. In certain circumstances\nhe could force her to go with him, as, for instance, if he had resolved to\nsettle in Palestine. On the other hand, the wife could prevent her husband\nfrom leaving her during the first year after marriage. It also happened\nthat families emigrated together. Mostly, however, the Jewess remained at\nhome, and only rarely did she join even the pilgrimage to Jerusalem. This\nis a striking contrast to the Christian custom, for it was the Christian\nwoman that was the most ardent pilgrim; in fact, pilgrimages to the Holy\nLand only became popular in Church circles because of the enthusiasm of\nHelena, mother of Constantine the Great, especially when, in 326, she found\nthe true cross. We, however, read of an aged Jewess who made a pilgrimage\nto all the cities of Europe, for the purpose of praying in the synagogues\non her route.",
        "We now know, from the Chronicle of Achimaaz, that Jews visited Jerusalem in\nthe tenth century. Aronius records a curious incident. Charles the Great,\nbetween the years 787 and 813, ordered a Jewish merchant, who often used to\nvisit Palestine and bring precious and unknown commodities thence to the\nWest, to hoax the Archbishop of Mainz, so as to lower the self-conceit of\nthis vain dilettante. The Jew thereupon sold him a mouse at a high price,\npersuading him that it was a rare animal, which he had brought with him\nfrom Judea. Early in the eleventh century there was a fully organized\nJewish community with a Beth-Din at Ramleh, some four hours’ drive from\nJaffa. But Jews did not visit Palestine in large numbers, until Saladin\nfinally regained the Holy City for Mohammedan rule, towards the end of the\ntwelfth century. From that time pilgrimages of Jews became more frequent;\nbut the real influx of Jews into Palestine dates from 1492, when many of\nthe Spanish exiles settled there, and formed the nucleus of the present\nSefardic population.",
        "On the whole, it may be said that in the Middle Ages the journey to\nPalestine was fraught with so much danger that it was gallantry that\ninduced men to go mostly without their wives. And, generally speaking, the\nJew going abroad to earn a living for his family, could not dream of\nallowing his wife to share the dangers and fatigues of the way. In Ellul,\n1146, Rabbi Simeon the Pious returned from England, where he had lived many\nyears, and betook himself to Cologne, thence to take ship home to Trier. On\nthe way, near Cologne, he was slain by Crusaders, because he refused\nbaptism. The Jewish community of Cologne bought the body from the citizens,\nand buried it in the Jewish cemetery.",
        "No doubt it was often a cruel necessity that separated husband and wife.\nThe Jewish law, even in lands where monogamy was not legally enforced, did\nnot allow the Jew, however, to console himself with one wife at home and\nanother abroad. Josephus, we know, had one wife in Tiberias and another in\nAlexandria, and the same thing is told us of royal officers in the Roman\nperiod; but the Talmudic legislation absolutely forbids such license, even\nthough it did not formally prohibit a man from having more than one wife at\nhome. We hear occasionally of the wife’s growing restive in her husband’s\nabsence and taking another husband. In 1272, Isaac of Erfurt went on a\ntrading journey, and though he was only gone from March 9, 1271, to July,\n1272, he found, on his return, that his wife had wearied of waiting for\nhim. Such incidents on the side of the wife were very rare; the number of\ncases in which wife-desertion occurred was larger. In her husband’s\nabsence, the wife’s lot, at best, was not happy. “Come back,” wrote one\nwife, “or send me a divorce.” “Nay,” replied the husband, “I can do\nneither. I have not yet made enough provision for us, so I cannot return.\nAnd, before Heaven, I love you, so I cannot divorce you.” The Rabbi advised\nthat he should give her a conditional divorce, a kindly device, which\nprovided that, in case the husband remained away beyond a fixed date, the\nwife was free to make other matrimonial arrangements. The Rabbis held that\ntravelling diminishes family life, property, and reputation. Move from\nhouse to house, and you lose a shirt; go from place to place, and you lose\na life–so ran the Rabbinic proverb. This subject might be enlarged upon,\nbut enough has been said to show that this breaking up of the family life\nwas one of the worst effects of the Jewish travels of the Middle Ages, and\neven more recent times.",
        "Whether his journey was devotional or commercial, the rites of religion\nformed part of the traveller’s preparations for the start. The Prayer for\nWayfarers is Talmudic in origin. It may be found in many prayer books, and\nI need not quote it. But one part of it puts so well, in a few pregnant\nwords, the whole story of danger, that I must reproduce them. On\napproaching a town, the Jew prayed, “May it be Thy will, O Lord, to bring\nme safely to this town.” When he had entered, he prayed, “May it be Thy\nwill, O Lord, to take me safely from this town.” And when he actually left,\nhe uttered similar words, pathetic and painfully significant.",
        "In the first century of the Christian era, much travelling was entailed by\nthe conveyance of the didrachmon, sent by each Jew to the Temple from\nalmost every part of the known world. Philo says of the Jews beyond the\nEuphrates: “Every year the sacred messengers are sent to convey large sums\nof gold and silver to the Temple, which have been collected from all the\nsubordinate Governments. They travel over rugged and difficult and almost\nimpassable roads, which, however, they look upon as level and easy,\ninasmuch as they serve to conduct them to piety.” And the road was made\neasy in other ways.",
        "It must often have been shortened to the imagination by the prevalent\nbelief that by supernatural aid the miles could be actually lessened. Rabbi\nNatronai was reported to be able to convey himself a several days’ journey\nin a single instant. So Benjamin of Tudela tells how Alroy, who claimed to\nbe the Messiah in the twelfth century, not only could make himself visible\nor invisible at will, but could cross rivers on his turban, and, by the aid\nof the Divine Name, could travel a ten days’ journey in ten hours. Another\nJewish traveller calmed the sea by naming God, another by writing the\nsacred Name on a shard, and casting it into the sea. “Have no care,” said\nhe, on another occasion, to his Arab comrade, as the shadows fell on a\nFriday afternoon, and they were still far from home, “have no care, we\nshall arrive before nightfall,” and, exercising his wonderworking powers,\nhe was as good as his word. We read in Achimaaz of the exploits of a\ntenth-century Jew who traversed Italy, working wonders, being received\neverywhere with popular acclamations. This was Aaron of Bagdad, son of a\nmiller, who, finding that a lion had eaten the mill-mule, caught the lion\nand made him do the grinding. His father sent him on his travels as a\npenalty for his dealings with magic: after three years he might return. Fie\nwent on board a ship, and assured the sailors that they need fear neither\nfoe nor storm, for he could use the Name. He landed at Gaeta in Italy,\nwhere he restored to human form the son of his host, whom a witch had\nturned into an ass. This was the beginning of many miracles. But he did not\nallow one place to monopolize him. Next we find him in Benvenuto. He goes\nto the synagogue, recognizes that a lad omits the name of God from his\nprayer, thus showing that he is dead! He goes to Oria, then to Bari, and so\nforth. Similar marvels were told in the Midrash, of travellers like Father\nJacob, and in the lives of Christian saints.",
        "But the Jew had a real means of shortening the way–by profitable and\nedifying conversation. “Do not travel with an Am ha-Arez,” the olden Rabbis\nadvised. Such a one, they held, was careless of his own safety, and would\nhardly be more careful of his companion’s life. But, besides, an Am\nha-Arez, using the word in its later sense of ignoramus, would be too dull\nfor edifying conversation, and one might as well or as ill journey alone as\nwith a boor. But “thou shalt speak of them by the way,” says Deuteronomy of\nthe commandments, and this (to say nothing of the danger) was one of the\nreasons why solitary travelling was disapproved. A man walking alone was\nmore likely to turn his mind to idle thoughts, than if he had a congenial\npartner to converse with, and the Mishnah is severe against him who turns\naside from his peripatetic study to admire a tree or a fallow. This does\nnot imply that the Jews were indifferent to the beauties of nature. Jewish\ntravellers often describe the scenery of the parts they visit, and\nPetachiah literally revels in the beautiful gardens of Persia, which he\npaints in vivid colors. Then, again, few better descriptions of a storm at\nsea have been written than those composed by Jehudah Halevi on his fatal\nvoyage to Palestine. Similarly, Charizi, another Jewish wayfarer, who\nlaughed himself over half the world, wrote verses as he walked, to relieve\nthe tedium. He is perhaps the most entertaining of all Jewish travellers.\nNothing is more amusing than his conscious habit of judging the characters\nof the men he saw by their hospitality, or the reverse, to himself. A more\nserious traveller, Maimonides, must have done a good deal of thinking on\nhorseback, to get through his ordinary day’s work and write his great\nbooks. In fact, he himself informs us that he composed part of his\nCommentary to the Mishnah while journeying by land and sea. In Europe, the\nRabbis often had several neighboring congregations under their care, and on\ntheir journeys to and fro took their books with them, and read in them at\nintervals. Maharil, on such journeys, always took note of the Jewish\ncustoms observed in different localities. He was also a most skilful and\nsuccessful Shadchan, or marriage-broker, and his extensive travels placed\nthis famous Rabbi in an excellent position for match-making. Certainly, the\nmarriages he effected were notoriously prosperous, and in his hands the\nShadchan system did the most good and the least harm of which it is\ncapable.",
        "Another type of short-distance traveller was the Bachur, or student. Not\nthat his journeys were always short, but he rarely crossed the sea. In the\nsecond century we find Jewish students in Galilee behaving as many Scotch\nyouths did before the days of Carnegie funds. These students would study in\nSepphoris in the winter, and work in the fields in summer. After the\nimpoverishment caused by the Bar-Cochba war, the students were glad to dine\nat the table of the wealthy Patriarch Judah I. In the medieval period there\nwere also such. These Bachurim, who, young as they were, were often\nmarried, accomplished enormous journeys on foot. They walked from the Rhine\nto Vienna, and from North Germany to Italy. Their privations on the road\nwere indescribable. Bad weather was naturally a severe trial. “Hearken not\nto the prayers of wayfarers,” was the petition of those who stayed at home.\nThis quaint Talmudic saying refers to the selfishness of travellers, who\nalways clamor for fine weather, though the farmer needs rain. Apart from\nthe weather, the Bachurim suffered much on the road. Their ordinary food\nwas raw vegetables culled from the fields; they drank nothing but water.\nThey were often accompanied by their teachers, who underwent the same\nprivations. Unlike their Talmudical precursors, they travelled much by\nnight, because it was safer, and also because they reserved the daylight\nfor study. The dietary laws make Jewish travelling particularly irksome. We\ndo, indeed, find Jews lodging at the ordinary inns, but they could not join\nthe general company at the table d’hôte. The Sabbath, too, was the cause\nof some discomfort, though the traveller always exerted his utmost efforts\nto reach a Jewish congregation by Friday evening, sometimes, as we have\nseen, with supernatural aid.",
        "We must interrupt this account of the Bachur to record a much earlier\ninstance of the awkward situation in which a pious Jewish traveller might\nfind himself because of the Sabbath regulations. In the very last year of\nthe fourth century, Synesius, of Cyrene, writing to his brother of his\nvoyage from Alexandria to Constantinople, supplies us with a quaint\ninstance of the manner in which the Sabbath affected Jewish travellers.\nSynesius uses a sarcastic tone, which must not be taken as seriously\nunfriendly. “His voyage homeward,” says Mr. Glover, “was adventurous.” It\nis a pity that space cannot be found for a full citation of Synesius’s\nenthralling narrative. His Jewish steersman is an entertaining character.\nThere were twelve members in the crew, the steersman making the thirteenth.\nMore than half, including the steersman, were Jews. “It was,” says\nSynesius, “the day which the Jews call the Preparation [Friday], and they\nreckon the night to the next day, on which they are not allowed to do any\nwork, but they pay it especial honor, and rest on it. So the steersman let\ngo the helm from his hands, when he thought the sun would have set on the\nland, and threw himself down, and ’What mariner should choose might trample\nhim!’ We did not at first understand the real reason, but took it for\ndespair, and went to him and besought him not to give up all hope yet. For\nin plain fact the big rollers still kept on, and the sea was at issue with\nitself. It does this when the wind falls, and the waves it has set going do\nnot fall with it, but, still retaining in full force the impulse that\nstarted them, meet the onset of the gale, and to its front oppose their\nown. Well, when people are sailing in such circumstances, life hangs, as\nthey say, by a slender thread. But if the steersman is a Rabbi into the\nbargain, what are one’s feelings? When, then, we understood what he meant\nin leaving the helm,–for when we begged him to save the ship from danger,\nhe went on reading his book,–we despaired of persuasion, and tried force.\nAnd a gallant soldier (for we have with us a good few Arabians, who belong\nto the cavalry) drew his sword, and threatened to cut his head off, if he\nwould not steer the ship. But in a moment he was a genuine Maccabee, and\nwould stick to his dogma. Yet when it was now midnight, he took his place\nof his own accord, ’for now,’ says he, ’the law allows me, as we are\nclearly in danger of our lives.’ At that the tumult begins again, moaning\nof men and screaming of women. Everybody began calling on Heaven, and\nwailing and remembering their dear ones. Amarantus alone was cheerful,\nthinking he was on the point of ruling out his creditors.” Amarantus was\nthe captain, who wished to die, because he was deep in debt. What with the\ndevil-may-care captain, the Maccabean steersman, and the critical onlooker,\nwho was a devoted admirer of Hypatia, rarely has wayfaring been conducted\nunder more delightful conditions. As is often the case in life, the humors\nof the scene almost obscure the fact that the lives of the actors were in\nreal danger. But all ended well. “As for us,” says Synesius further on, “as\nsoon as we reached the land we longed for, we embraced it as if it had been\na living mother. Offering, as usual, a hymn of gratitude to God, I added to\nit the recent misadventure from which we had unexpectedly been saved.”",
        "To return to our travelling Bachur of later centuries than Synesius’s\nRabbi-steersman. On the road, the student was often attacked, but, as\nhappened with the son of the great Asheri, who was waylaid by bandits near\nToledo, the robbers did not always get the best of the fight. The Bachur\ncould take his own part. One Jew gained much notoriety in 801 by conducting\nan elephant all the way from Haroun al-Rashid’s court as a present to\nCharlemagne, the king of the Franks. But the Rabbi suffered considerably\nfrom his religion on his journeys. Dr. Schechter tells us how the Gaon\nElijah got out of his carriage to say his prayer, and, as the driver knew\nthat the Rabbi would not interrupt his devotions, he promptly made off,\ncarrying away the Gaon’s property.",
        "But the account was not all on one side. If the Bachur suffered for his\nreligion, he received ample compensation. When he arrived at his\ndestination, he was welcomed right heartily. We read how cordially the\nSheliach Kolel was received in Algiers in the fifteenth to eighteenth\ncenturies. It was a great popular event, as is nowadays the visit of the\nAlliance inspector. This was not the case with all Jewish travellers,\nsome of whom received a very cold shoulder from their brethren. Why was\nthis? Chiefly because the Jews, as little as the rest of medieval peoples,\nrealized that progress and enlightenment are indissolubly bound up with the\nright of free movement. They regarded the right to move here and there at\nwill as a selfish privilege of the few, not the just right of all. But more\nthan that. The Jews were forced to live in special and limited Ghettos. It\nwas not easy to find room for newcomers. When a crisis arrived, such as the\nexpulsion of the Jews from Spain, then, except here and there, the Jews\nwere generous to a fault in providing for the exiles. Societies all over\nthe Continent and round the coast of the Mediterranean spent their time and\nmoney in ransoming the poor victims, who, driven from Spain, were enslaved\nby the captains of the vessels that carried them, and were then bought back\nto freedom by their Jewish brethren.",
        "This is a noble fact in Jewish history. But it is nevertheless true that\nJewish communities were reluctant in ordinary times to permit new\nsettlements. This was not so in ancient times. Among the Essenes, a\nnewcomer had a perfectly equal right to share everything with the old\ninhabitants. These Essenes were great travellers, going from city to city,\nprobably with propagandist aims. In the Talmudic law there are very clear\nrules on the subject of passers through a town or immigrants into it. By\nthat law persons staying in a place for less than thirty days were free\nfrom all local dues except special collections for the poor. He who stayed\nless than a year contributed to the ordinary poor relief, but was not taxed\nfor permanent objects, such as walling the town, defences, etc., nor did he\ncontribute to the salaries of teachers and officials, nor the building and\nsupport of synagogues. But as his duties were small, so were his rights.\nAfter a twelve months’ stay he became a “son of the city,” a full member of\nthe community. But in the Middle Ages, newcomers, as already said, were not\ngenerally welcome. The question of space was one important reason, for all\nnewcomers had to stay in the Ghetto. Secondly, the newcomer was not\namenable to discipline. Local custom varied much in the details both of\nJewish and general law. The new settler might claim to retain his old\ncustoms, and the regard for local custom was so strong that the claim was\noften allowed, to the destruction of uniformity and the undermining of\nauthority. To give an instance or two: A newcomer would insist that, as he\nmight play cards in his native town, he ought not to be expected to obey\npuritanical restrictions in the place to which he came. The result was that\nthe resident Jews would clamor against foreigners enjoying special\nprivileges, as in this way all attempts to control gambling might be\ndefeated. Or the newcomer would claim to shave his beard in accordance with\nhis home custom, but to the scandal of the town which he was visiting. The\nnative young men would imitate the foreigner, and then there would be\ntrouble. Or the settler would assert his right to wear colors and fashions\nand jewelry forbidden to native Jews. Again, the marriage problem was\ncomplicated by the arrival of insinuating strangers, who turned out to be\nmarried men masquerading as bachelors. Then as to public worship–the\ncongregation was often split into fragments by the independent services\norganized by foreign groups, and it would become necessary to prohibit its\nown members from attending the synagogues of foreign settlers. Then as to\ncommunal taxes: these were fixed annually on the basis of the population,\nand the arrival of newcomers seriously disturbed the equilibrium, led to\nfresh exactions by the Government, which it was by no means certain the new\nsettlers could or would pay, and which, therefore, fell on the shoulders of\nthe old residents.",
        "When we consider all these facts, we can see that the eagerness of the\nmedieval Jews to control the influx of foreign settlers was only in part\nthe result of base motives. And, of course, the exclusion was not permanent\nor rigid. In Rome, the Sefardic and the Italian Jews fraternally placed\ntheir synagogues on different floors of the same building. In some German\ntowns, the foreign synagogue was fixed in the same courtyard as the native.\nEverywhere foreign Jews abounded, and everywhere a generous welcome awaited\nthe genuine traveller.",
        "As to the travelling beggar, he was a perpetual nuisance. Yet he was\ntreated with much consideration. The policy with regard to him was, “Send\nthe beggar further,” and this suited the tramp, too. He did not wish to\nsettle, he wished to move on. He would be lodged for two days in the\ncommunal inn, or if, as usually happened, he arrived on Friday evening, he\nwould be billeted on some hospitable member, or the Shamash would look\nafter him at the public expense. It is not till the thirteenth century that\nwe meet regular envoys sent from Palestine to collect money.",
        "The genuine traveller, however, was an ever-welcome guest. If he came at\nfair time, his way was smoothed for him. The Jew who visited the fair was\nonly rarely charged local taxes by the Synagogue. He deserved a welcome,\nfor he not only brought wares to sell, but he came laden with new books.\nThe fair was the only book-market At other times the Jews were dependent on\nthe casual visits of travelling venders of volumes. Book-selling does not\nseem to have been a settled occupation in the Middle Ages. The merchant who\ncame to the fair also fulfilled another function–that of Shadchan. The day\nof the fair was, in fact, the crisis of the year. Naturally, the\nletter-carrier was eagerly received. In the early part of the eighteenth\ncentury the function of conveying the post was sometimes filled by\nJewesses.",
        "Even the ordinary traveller, who had no business to transact, would often\nchoose fair time for visiting new places, for he would be sure to meet\ninteresting people then. He, too, would mostly arrive on a Friday evening,\nand would beguile the Sabbath with reports of the wonders he had seen. In\nthe great synagogue of Sepphoris, Jochanan was discoursing of the great\npearl, so gigantic in size that the Eastern gates of the Temple were to be\nbuilt of the single gem. “Ay, ay,” assented an auditor, who had been a\nnotorious skeptic until he had become a shipwrecked sailor, “had not mine\nown eyes beheld such a pearl in the ocean-bed, I should not have believed\nit.” And so the medieval traveller would tell his enthralling tales. He\nwould speak of a mighty Jewish kingdom in the East, existing in idyllic\npeace and prosperity; he would excite his auditors with news of the latest\nMessiah; he would describe the river Sambatyon, which keeps the Sabbath,\nand, mingling truth with fiction, with one breath would truly relate how he\ncrossed a river on an inflated skin, and with the next breath romance about\nHillel’s tomb, how he had been there, and how he had seen a large hollow\nstone, which remains empty if a bad fellow enters, but at the approach of a\npious visitor fills up with sweet, pure water, with which he washes,\nuttering a wish at the same time, sure that it will come true. It is\nimpossible even to hint at all the wonders of the tombs. Jews were ardent\nbelievers in the supernatural power of sepulchres; they made pilgrimages to\nthem to pray and to beg favors. Jewish travellers’ tales of the Middle Ages\nare heavily laden with these legends. Of course, the traveller would also\nbring genuine news about his brethren in distant parts, and sober\ninformation about foreign countries, their ways, their physical\nconformation, and their strange birds and beasts. These stories were in the\nmain true. For instance, Petachiah tells of a flying camel, which runs\nfifteen times as fast as the fleetest horse. He must have seen an ostrich,\nwhich is still called the flying camel by Arabs. But we cannot linger over\nthis matter. Suffice it to say that, as soon as Sabbath was over, the\ntraveller’s narrative would be written out by the local scribe, and\ntreasured as one of the communal prizes. The traveller, on his part, often\nkept a diary, and himself compiled a description of his adventures. In some\ncongregations there was kept a Communal Note-Book, in which were entered\ndecisions brought by visiting Rabbis from other communities.",
        "The most welcome of guests, even more welcome than long-distance\ntravellers, or globe-trotters, were the Bachurim and travelling Rabbis. The\nTalmudic Rabbis were most of them travellers. Akiba’s extensive journeys\nwere, some think, designed to rouse the Jews of Asia Minor generally to\nparticipate in the insurrection against Hadrian. But my narrative must be\nat this point confined to the medieval students. For the Bachurim, or\nstudents, there was a special house in many communities, and they lived\ntogether with their teachers. In the twelfth century, the great academy of\nNarbonne, under Abraham ibn Daud, attracted crowds of foreign students.\nThese, as Benjamin of Tudela tells us, were fed and clothed at the communal\ncost. At Beaucaire, the students were housed and supported at the teacher’s\nexpense. In the seventeenth century, the students not only were paid small\nbursaries, but every household entertained one or more of them at table. In\nthese circumstances their life was by no means dull or monotonous. A Jewish\nstudent endures much, but he knows how to get the best out of life. This\noptimism, this quickness of humor, saved the Rabbi and his pupil from many\na melancholy hour. Take Abraham ibn Ezra, for instance. If ever a man was\nmarked out to be a bitter reviler of fate, it was he. But he laughed at\nfate. He gaily wandered from his native Spain over many lands penniless,\ntravelled with no baggage but his thoughts, visited Italy and France, and\neven reached London, where, perhaps, he died. Fortune ill-treated him, but\nhe found many joys. Wherever he went, patrons held out their hand.",
        "Travelling students found many such generous lovers of learning, who, with\ntheir wealth, encouraged their guests to write original works or copy out\nolder books, which the patrons then passed on to poor scholars in want of a\nlibrary. The legend is told, how the prophet Elijah visited Hebron, and was\nnot “called up” in the synagogue. Receiving no Aliyah on earth, he returned\nto his elevation in Heaven. It was thus imprudent to deny honor to angels\nunawares. Usually the scholar was treated as such a possible angel. When he\narrived, the whole congregation would turn out to meet him. He would be\ntaken in procession to the synagogue, where he would say the benediction\nha-Gomel, in thanks for his safety on the road. Perhaps he would address\nthe congregation, though he would do that rather in the school than in the\nsynagogue. Then a banquet would be spread for him. This banquet was called\none of the Seudoth Mitzvah, i.e. “commandment meals,” to which it was a\nduty of all pious men to contribute their money and their own attendance.\nIt would be held in the communal hall, used mostly for marriage feasts.\nWhen a wedding party came from afar, similar steps for general enjoyment\nwere taken. Men mounted on horseback went forth to welcome the bride, mimic\ntournaments were fought en route, torch-light processions were made if it\nwere night time, processions by boats if it were in Italy or by the Rhine,\na band of communal musicians, retained at general cost, played merry\nmarches, and everyone danced and joined in the choruses. These musicians\noften went from town to town, and the Jewish players were hired for Gentile\nparties, just as Jews employed Christian or Arab musicians to help make\nmerry on the Jewish Sabbaths and festivals.",
        "We need not wonder, then, that a traveller like Ibn Ezra was no croaker,\nbut a genial critic of life. He suffered, but he was light-hearted enough\nto compose witty epigrams and improvise rollicking wine songs. He was an\naccomplished chess player, and no doubt did something to spread the Eastern\ngame in Europe. Another service rendered by such travellers was the spread\nof learning by their translations. Their wanderings made them great\nlinguists, and they were thus able to translate medical, astronomical, and\nscientific works wherever they went. They were also sent by kings on\nmissions to collect new nautical instruments. Thus, the baculus, which\nhelped Columbus to discover America, was taken to Portugal by Jews, and a\nFrench Jew was its inventor. They were much in demand as travelling\ndoctors, being summoned from afar to effect specific cures. But they also\ncarried other delights with them. Not only were they among the troubadours,\nbut they were also the most famous of the travelling conteurs. It was the\nJews, like Berechiah, Charizi, Zabara, Abraham ibn Chasdai, and other\nincessant travellers, who helped to bring to Europe Æsop, Bidpai, the\nBuddhist legends, who “translated them from the Indian,” and were partly\nresponsible for this rich poetical gift to the Western world.",
        "Looking back on such a life, Ibn Ezra might well detect a Divine Providence\nin his own pains and sorrows. So, Jew-like, he retained his hope to the\nlast, and after his buffetings on the troubled seas of life, remembering\nthe beneficent results of his travels to others, if not to himself, he\ncould write in this faithful strain:",
        "  My hope God knoweth well,\n  My life He made full sweet;\n  Whene’er His servant fell,\n  God raised him to his feet.\n  Within the garment of His grace,\n  My faults He did enfold,\n  Hiding my sin, His kindly face\n  My God did ne’er withhold.\n  Requiting with fresh good,\n  My black ingratitude.",
        "There remain the great merchant travellers to be told about. They sailed\nover all the world, and brought to Europe the wares, the products, the\nluxuries of the East. They had their own peculiar dangers. Shipwreck was\nthe fate of others besides themselves, but they were peculiarly liable to\ncapture and sale as slaves. Foremost among their more normal hardships I\nshould place the bridge laws of the Middle Ages. The bridges were sometimes\npractically maintained by the Jewish tolls. In England, before 1290, a Jew\npaid a toll of a halfpenny on foot and a full penny on horseback–large\nsums in those days. A “dead Jew” paid eightpence. Burial was for a long\ntime lawful only in London, and the total toll paid for bringing a dead Jew\nto London over the various bridges must have been considerable. In the\nKurpfalz, for instance, the Jewish traveller had to pay the usual “white\npenny” for every mile, but also a heavy general fee for the whole journey.\nIf he was found without his ticket of leave, he was at once arrested. But\nit was when he came to a bridge that the exactions grew insufferable. The\nregulations were somewhat tricky, for the Jew was specially taxed only on\nSundays and the Festivals of the Church. But every other day was some\nSaint’s Festival, and while, in Mannheim, even on those days the Christian\ntraveller paid one kreuzer if he crossed the bridge on foot, and two if on\nhorseback, the Jew was charged four kreuzer if on foot, twelve if on a\nhorse, and for every beast of burden he, unlike the Christian wayfarer,\npaid a further toll of eight kreuzer. The Jewish quarter often lay near the\nriver, and Jews had great occasion for crossing the bridges, even for local\nneeds. In Venice, the Jewish quarter was naturally intersected by bridges;\nin Rome there was the pons Judeorum, which, no doubt, the Jews had to\nmaintain in repair. It must be remembered that many local Jewish\ncommunities paid a regular bridge tax which was not exacted from\nChristians, and when all this is considered, it will be seen that the\nJewish merchant needed to work hard and go far afield, if he was to get any\nprofit from his enterprises.",
        "Nevertheless, these Jews owned horses and caravans, and sailed their own\nships long before the time when great merchants, like the English Jew\nAntonio Fernandes Carvajal, traded in their own vessels between London and\nthe Canaries. We hear of Palestinian Jews in the third century and of\nItalian Jews in the fifth century with ships of their own. Jewish sailors\nabounded on the Mediterranean, which tended to become a Jewish lake. The\ntrade routes of the Jews were chiefly two. “By one route,” says Beazley,\n“they sailed from the ports of France and Italy to the Isthmus of Suez, and\nthence down the Red Sea to India and Farther Asia. By another course, they\ntransported the goods of the West to the Syrian coast; up the Orontes to\nAntioch; down the Euphrates to Bassora; and so along the Persian Gulf to\nOman and the Southern Ocean.” Further, there were two chief overland\nroutes. On the one side merchants left Spain, traversed the straits of\nGibraltar, went by caravan from Tangier along the northern fringe of the\ndesert, to Egypt, Syria, and Persia. This was the southern route. Then\nthere was the northern route, through Germany, across the country of the\nSlavs to the Lower Volga; thence, descending the river, they sailed across\nthe Caspian. Then the traveller proceeded along the Oxus valley to Balkh,\nand, turning north-east, traversed the country of the Tagazgaz Turks, and\nfound himself at last on the frontier of China. When one realizes the\nextent of such a journey, it is not surprising to hear that the greatest\nauthorities are agreed that in the Middle Ages, before the rise of the\nItalian trading republics, the Jews were the chief middlemen between Europe\nand Asia. Their vast commercial undertakings were productive of much good.\nNot only did the Jews bring to Europe new articles of food and luxury, but\nthey served the various States as envoys and as intelligencers. The great\nAnglo-Jewish merchant Carvajal provided Cromwell with valuable information,\nas other Jewish merchants had done to other rulers of whom they were loyal\nservants. In the fifteenth century Henry of Portugal applied to Jews for\nintelligence respecting the interior of Africa, and a little later John,\nking of the same land, derived accurate information respecting India from\ntwo Jewish travellers that had spent many years at Ormuz and Calcutta. But\nit is unnecessary to add more facts of this type. The Jewish merchant\ntraveller was no mere tradesman. He observed the country, especially did he\nnote the numbers and occupations of the Jews, their synagogues, their\nschools, their vices, and their virtues.",
        "In truth, the Jewish traveller, as he got farther from home, was more at\nhome than many of his contemporaries of other faiths when they were at\nhome. He kept alive that sense of the oneness of Judaism which could be\nmost strongly and completely achieved because there was no political bias\nto separate it into hostile camps.",
        "But the interest between the traveller and his home was maintained by\nanother bond. A striking feature of Jewish wayfaring life was the writing\nof letters home. The “Book of the Pious,” composed about 1200, says: “He\nthat departs from the city where his father and mother live, and travels to\na place of danger, and his father and mother are anxious on account of him;\nit is the bounden duty of the son to hire a messenger as soon as he can and\ndespatch a letter to his father and mother, telling them when he departs\nfrom the place of danger, that their anxiety may be allayed.” Twice a year\nall Jews wrote family letters, at the New Year and the Passover, and they\nsent special greetings on birthdays. But the traveller was the chief\nletter-writer. “O my father,” wrote the famous Obadiah of Bertinoro, in\n1488, “my departure from thee has caused thee sorrow and suffering, and I\nam inconsolable that I was forced to leave at the time when age was\ncreeping on thee. When I think of thy grey hairs, which I no longer see, my\neyes flow over with tears. But if the happiness of serving thee in person\nis denied to me, yet I can at least serve thee as thou desirest, by writing\nto thee of my journey, by pouring my soul out to thee, by a full narrative\nof what I have seen and of the state and manners of the Jews in all the\nplaces where I have dwelt.” After a long and valuable narrative, he\nconcludes in this loving strain: “I have taken me a house in Jerusalem near\nthe synagogue, and my window overlooks it. In the court where my house is,\nthere live five women, and only one other man besides myself. He is blind,\nand his wife attends to my needs. God be thanked, I have escaped the\nsickness which affects nearly all travellers here. And I entreat you, weep\nnot at my absence, but rejoice in my joy, that I am in the Holy City. I\ntake God to witness that here the thought of all my sufferings vanishes,\nand but one image is before my eyes, thy dear face, O my father. Let me\nfeel that I can picture that face to me, not clouded with tears, but lit\nwith joy. You have other children around you; make them your joy, and let\nmy letters, which I will ever and anon renew, bring solace to your age, as\nyour letters bring solace to me.”",
        "Much more numerous than the epistles of sons to fathers are the letters of\nfathers to their families. When these come from Palestine, there is the\nsame mingling of pious joy and human sorrow–joy to be in the Holy Land,\nsorrow to be separated from home. Another source of grief was the\ndesolation of Palestine.",
        "One such letter-writer tells sadly how he walked through the market at\nZion, thought of the past, and only kept back his tears lest the Arab\nonlookers should see and ridicule his sorrow. Yet another medieval\nletter-writer, Nachmanides, reaches the summit of sentiment in these lines,\nwhich I take from Dr. Schechter’s translation: “I was exiled by force from\nhome, I left my sons and daughters; and with the dear and sweet ones whom I\nbrought up on my knees, I left my soul behind me. My heart and my eyes will\ndwell with them forever. But O! the joy of a day in thy courts, O\nJerusalem! visiting the ruins of the Temple and crying over the desolate\nSanctuary; where I am permitted to caress thy stones, to fondle thy dust,\nand to weep over thy ruins. I wept bitterly, but found joy in my tears.”",
        "And with this thought in our mind we will take leave of our subject. It is\nthe traveller who can best discern, amid the ruins wrought by man, the hope\nof a Divine rebuilding. Over the heavy hills of strife, he sees the coming\ndawn of peace. The world must still pass through much tribulation before\nthe new Jerusalem shall arise, to enfold in its loving embrace all\ncountries and all men. But the traveller, more than any other, hastens the\ngood time. He overbridges seas, he draws nations nearer; he shows men that\nthere are many ways of living and of loving. He teaches them to be\ntolerant; he humanizes them by presenting their brothers to them. The\ntraveller it is who prepares a way in the wilderness, who makes straight in\nthe desert a highway for the Lord.",
