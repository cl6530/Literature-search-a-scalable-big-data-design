        "The knights by Bloedel summoned / soon armed and ready were,\nA thousand wearing hauberks / straightway did repair\nWhere Dankwart sat at table / with many a goodly squire.\nSoon knight on knight was seeking / in fiercest way to vent his ire.",
        "1922",
        "When there Sir Bloedel / strode unto the board,\nDankwart the marshal / thus spoke courteous word:\n“Unto this hall right welcome / good Sir Bloedel be.\nWhat business hast thou hither / is cause of wonder yet to me.”",
        "1923",
        "“No greeting here befits thee,\" / spake Bloedel presently,\n“For that this my coming / now thy end must be,\nThrough Hagen’s fault, thy brother, / who Siegfried erstwhile slew\nTo the Huns thou mak’st atonement, / and many another warrior too.”",
        "1924",
        "“But nay, but nay, Sir Bloedel,\" / Dankwart spake thereto,\n“For so should we have reason / our coming here to rue.\nA child I was and little / when Siegfried lost his life,\nNor know I why reproacheth / me the royal Etzel’s wife.”",
        "1925",
        "“In sooth I may the story / never fully tell.\nGunther and Hagen was it / by whom the deed befell.\nNow guard you well, ye strangers, / for doomed in sooth are ye,\nUnto Lady Kriemhild / must your lives now forfeit be.”",
        "1926",
        "“An so thou wilt desist not,\" / Dankwart declared,\n“Regret I my entreaty, / my toil were better spared.\"\nThe nimble thane and valiant / up from the table sprung,\nAnd drew a keen-edged weapon, / great in sooth that was and long.",
        "1927",
        "Then smote he with it Bloedel / such a sudden blow\nThat his head full sudden / before his feet lay low.\n“Be that thy wedding-dower,\" / the doughty Dankwart spake,\n“Along with bride of Nudung / whom thou would’st to thy bosom take.",
        "1928",
        "“To-morrow may she marry, / but some other one:\nWill he have bridal portion, / e’en so to him be done.\"\nA Hun that liked not treason / had given him to know\nHow that the queen upon him / thought to work so grievous woe.",
        "1929",
        "When the men of Bloedel / saw thus their master slain,\nTo fall upon the strangers / would they longer not refrain.\nWith swords swung high above them / upon the squires they flew\nIn a grimmest humor. / Soon many must that rashness rue.",
        "1930",
        "Full loudly cried then Dankwart / to all his company:\n“Behold ye, noble squires, / the fate that ours must be.\nNow quit yourselves with valor, / for evil is our pass,\nThough fair to us the summons / hither from Lady Kriemhild was!”",
        "1931",
        "They, too, reached down before them, / who no weapons bore,\nAnd each a massive footstool / snatched from off the floor,\nFor the Burgundian squires / no whit were they dismayed;\nAnd by the selfsame weapons / was many a dint in helmet made.",
        "1932",
        "How fierce they fought to shield them / the strangers one and all!\nE’en their armed foemen / drove they from the hall.\nOr smote dead within it / hundreds five or more;\nAll the valiant fighters / saw ye drenched with ruddy gore.",
        "1933",
        "Ere long the wondrous tidings / some messenger did tell\nUnto Etzel’s chieftain / –fierce did their anger swell–\nHow that slain was Bloedel / and knights full many a one;\nThe which had Hagen’s brother / with his lusty squires done.",
        "1934",
        "The Huns, by anger driven, / ere Etzel was aware,\nTwo thousand men or over, / did quick themselves prepare.\nThey fell upon those squires / –e’en so it had to be–\nAnd never any living / they left of all that company.",
        "1935",
        "A mickle host they faithless / unto those quarters brought,\nBut lustily the strangers / ’gainst their assailants fought.\nWhat booted swiftest valor? / Soon must all lie dead.\nA dire woe thereafter / on many a man was visited.",
        "1936",
        "Now may ye hear a wondrous / tale of honor told:\nOf squires full nine thousand / soon in death lay cold,\nAnd eke good knights a dozen / there of Dankwart’s band.\nForlorn ye saw him only / the last amid his foemen stand.",
        "1937",
        "The din at last was ended / and lulled the battle-sound,\nWhen the valiant Dankwart / did cast a glance around.\n“Alack for my companions,\" / cried he, “now from me reft.\nAlack that I now only / forlorn amid my foes am left.”",
        "1938",
        "The swords upon his body / fell full thick and fast,\nWhich rashness many a warrior’s / widow mourned at last.\nHis shield he higher lifted / and drew the strap more low:\nDown coats of ring-made armor / made he the ebbing blood to flow.",
        "1939",
        "“O woe is me!” spake Dankwart, / the son of Aldrian.\n“Now back, ye Hunnish fighters, / let me the open gain,\nThat the air give cooling / to me storm-weary wight.\"\nIn splendid valor moving / strode forward then anew the knight.",
        "1940",
        "As thus he battle-weary / through the hall’s portal sprang,\nWhat swords of new-come fighters / upon his helmet rang!\nThey who not yet had witnessed / what wonders wrought his hand,\nRashly rushed they forward / to thwart him of Burgundian land.",
        "1941",
        "“Now would to God,” quoth Dankwart, / “I found a messenger\nWho to my brother Hagen / might the tidings bear,\nThat ’fore host of foemen / in such sad case am I!\nFrom hence he’d surely help me, / or by my side he slain would lie.”",
        "1942",
        "Then Hunnish knights gave answer: / “Thyself the messenger\nShalt be, when to thy brother / thee a corse we bear.\nSo shall that thane of Gunther / first true sorrow know.\nUpon the royal Etzel / here hast thou wrought so grievous woe.”",
        "1943",
        "Quoth he: “Now leave such boasting / and yield me passage free,\nElse shall mail-rings a many / with blood bespattered be.\nMyself will tell the tidings / soon at Etzel’s court,\nAnd eke unto my masters / of this my travail make report.”",
        "1944",
        "Etzel’s men around him / belabored he so sore\nThat they at sword-point / durst not withstand him more.\nSpears shot into his shield he / so many there did stop\nThat he the weight unwieldy / must from out his hand let drop.",
        "1945",
        "Then thought they to subdue him / thus of his shield bereft,\nBut lo! the mighty gashes / wherewith he helmets cleft!\nMust there keen knights full many / before him stagger down,\nHigh praise the valiant Dankwart / thereby for his valor won.",
        "1946",
        "On right side and on left side / they still beset his way,\nYet many a one too rashly / did mingle in the fray.\nThus strode he ’mid the foemen / as doth in wood the boar\nBy yelping hounds beleaguered; / more stoutly fought he ne’er before.",
        "1947",
        "As there he went, his pathway / with reeking blood was wet.\nYea, never any hero / more bravely battled yet\nWhen by foes surrounded, / than he did might display.\nTo court did Hagen’s brother / with splendid valor make his way.",
        "1948",
        "When stewards and cup-bearers / heard how sword-blades rung,\nMany a brimming goblet / from their hands they flung\nAnd eke the viands ready / that they to table bore;\nThus many doughty foemen / withstood him where he sought the door.",
        "1949",
        "“How now, ye stewards?\" / cried the weary knight;\n“’Twere better that ye tended / rather your guests aright,\nBearing to lords at table / choice food that fitteth well,\nAnd suffered me these tidings / unto my masters dear to tell.”",
        "1950",
        "Whoe’er before him rashly / athwart the stairway sprung,\nOn him with blow so heavy / his mighty sword he swung,\nThat soon faint heart gave warning / before his path to yield.\nMickle wonder wrought he / where sword his doughty arm did wield.",
