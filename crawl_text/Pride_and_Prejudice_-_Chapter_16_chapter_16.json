        "As no objection was made to the young people’s engagement\nwith their aunt, and all Mr. Collins’s scruples of leaving Mr.\nand Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most\nsteadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins\nat a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of\nhearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham\nhad accepted their uncle’s invitation, and was then in the house.",
        "When this information was given, and they had all taken their\nseats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire,\nand he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the\napartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed\nhimself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a\ncomparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but\nwhen Mrs. Phillips understood from him what Rosings was, and\nwho was its proprietor–when she had listened to the description\nof only one of Lady Catherine’s drawing-rooms, and found that\nthe chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt\nall the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented\na comparison with the housekeeper’s room.",
        "In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her\nmansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble\nabode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily\nemployed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in\nMrs. Phillips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of\nhis consequence increased with what she heard, and who was\nresolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she\ncould.  To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,\nand who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and\nexamine their own indifferent imitations of china on the\nmantelpiece, the interval of waiting appeared very long.  It was\nover at last, however.  The gentlemen did approach, and when\nMr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had\nneither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with\nthe smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.  The officers of\nthe ––shire were in general a very creditable, gentlemanlike\nset, and the best of them were of the present party; but Mr.\nWickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air,\nand walk, as they were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy\nuncle Phillips, breathing port wine, who followed them into\nthe room.",
        "Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every\nfemale eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by\nwhom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in\nwhich he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only\non its being a wet night, made her feel that the commonest,\ndullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by\nthe skill of the speaker.",
        "With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and\nthe officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to\nthe young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at\nintervals a kind listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her\nwatchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.\nWhen the card-tables were placed, he had the opportunity of\nobliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.",
        "“I know little of the game at present,” said he, “but I shall be\nglad to improve myself, for in my situation in life–” Mrs. Phillips\nwas very glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his\nreason.",
        "Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he\nreceived at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia.  At first\nthere seemed danger of Lydia’s engrossing him entirely, for she\nwas a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond\nof lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the\ngame, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to\nhave attention for anyone in particular.  Allowing for the\ncommon demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure\nto talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him,\nthough what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be\ntold–the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy.  She dared\nnot even mention that gentleman.  Her curiosity, however, was\nunexpectedly relieved.  Mr. Wickham began the subject himself.\nHe inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after\nreceiving her answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long\nMr. Darcy had been staying there.",
        "“About a month,” said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the\nsubject drop, added, “He is a man of very large property in\nDerbyshire, I understand.”",
        "“Yes,” replied Mr. Wickham; “his estate there is a noble one.\nA clear ten thousand per annum.  You could not have met with a\nperson more capable of giving you certain information on that\nhead than myself, for I have been connected with his family in\na particular manner from my infancy.”",
        "Elizabeth could not but look surprised.",
        "“You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion,\nafter seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our\nmeeting yesterday.  Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”",
        "“As much as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth very warmly.\n“I have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think\nhim very disagreeable.”",
        "“I have no right to give my opinion,” said Wickham, “as to his\nbeing agreeable or otherwise.  I am not qualified to form one.  I\nhave known him too long and too well to be a fair judge.  It is\nimpossible for me to be impartial.  But I believe your opinion\nof him would in general astonish–and perhaps you would not\nexpress it quite so strongly anywhere else.  Here you are in your\nown family.”",
        "“Upon my word, I say no more here than I might say in any\nhouse in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield.  He is not at all\nliked in Hertfordshire.  Everybody is disgusted with his pride.\nYou will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone.”",
        "“I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a short\ninterruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated\nbeyond their deserts; but with him I believe it does not often\nhappen.  The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence,\nor frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him\nonly as he chooses to be seen.”",
        "“I should take him, even on my slight acquaintance, to be an\nill-tempered man.”  Wickham only shook his head.",
        "“I wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking,\n“whether he is likely to be in this country much longer.”",
        "“I do not at all know; but I heard nothing of his going away\nwhen I was at Netherfield.  I hope your plans in favour of the\n––shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”",
        "“Oh! no–it is not for me to be driven away by Mr. Darcy.  If\nhe wishes to avoid seeing me, he must go.  We are not on\nfriendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I\nhave no reason for avoiding him but what I might proclaim\nbefore all the world, a sense of very great ill-usage, and most\npainful regrets at his being what he is.  His father, Miss Bennet,\nthe late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed,\nand the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company\nwith this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a\nthousand tender recollections.  His behaviour to myself has been\nscandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and\neverything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and\ndisgracing the memory of his father.”",
        "Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened\nwith all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.",
        "Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton,\nthe neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all\nthat he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but\nvery intelligible gallantry.",
        "“It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he\nadded, “which was my chief inducement to enter the ––shire.\nI knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my\nfriend Denny tempted me further by his account of their\npresent quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent\nacquaintances Meryton had procured them.  Society, I own, is\nnecessary to me.  I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits\nwill not bear solitude.  I must have employment and society.\nA military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances\nhave now made it eligible.  The church ought to have been\nmy profession–I was brought up for the church, and I should at\nthis time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had\nit pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now.”",
        "“Indeed!”",
        "“Yes–the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation\nof the best living in his gift.  He was my godfather, and\nexcessively attached to me.  I cannot do justice to his kindness.\nHe meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it;\nbut when the living fell, it was given elsewhere.”",
        "“Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could that be?\nHow could his will be disregarded?  Why did you not seek legal\nredress?”",
        "“There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest\nas to give me no hope from law.  A man of honour could not have\ndoubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it–or to\ntreat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that\nI had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence–in\nshort anything or nothing.  Certain it is, that the living became\nvacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and\nthat it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that\nI cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve\nto lose it.  I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may have\nspoken my opinion of him, and to him, too freely.  I can recall\nnothing worse.  But the fact is, that we are very different sort\nof men, and that he hates me.”",
        "“This is quite shocking!  He deserves to be publicly disgraced.”",
        "“Some time or other he will be–but it shall not be by me.\nTill I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose him.”",
        "Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him\nhandsomer than ever as he expressed them.",
        "“But what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive?\nWhat can have induced him to behave so cruelly?”",
        "“A thorough, determined dislike of me–a dislike which I cannot\nbut attribute in some measure to jealousy.  Had the late Mr.\nDarcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better;\nbut his father’s uncommon attachment to me irritated him, I\nbelieve, very early in life.  He had not a temper to bear the sort of\ncompetition in which we stood–the sort of preference which\nwas often given me.”",
        "“I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this–though I have\nnever liked him.  I had not thought so very ill of him.  I had\nsupposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but\ndid not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge,\nsuch injustice, such inhumanity as this.”",
        "After a few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued,\n“I do remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the\nimplacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving\ntemper.  His disposition must be dreadful.”",
        "“I will not trust myself on the subject,” replied Wickham; “I\ncan hardly be just to him.”",
        "Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed,\n“To treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite\nof his father!”  She could have added, “A young man, too,\nlike you, whose very countenance may vouch for your being\namiable\"–but she contented herself with, “and one, too, who\nhad probably been his companion from childhood, connected\ntogether, as I think you said, in the closest manner!”",
        "“We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the\ngreatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the\nsame house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same\nparental care.  My father began life in the profession which\nyour uncle, Mr. Phillips, appears to do so much credit to–but\nhe gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy and\ndevoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property.\nHe was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate,\nconfidential friend.  Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself\nto be under the greatest obligations to my father’s active\nsuperintendence, and when, immediately before my father’s\ndeath, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for\nme, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of\ngratitude to him, as of his affection to myself.”",
        "“How strange!” cried Elizabeth.  “How abominable!  I wonder\nthat the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to\nyou!  If from no better motive, that he should not have been too\nproud to be dishonest–for dishonesty I must call it.”",
        "“It is wonderful,” replied Wickham, “for almost all his actions\nmay be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend.\nIt has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other\nfeeling.  But we are none of us consistent, and in his behaviour\nto me there were stronger impulses even than pride.”",
        "“Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”",
        "“Yes.  It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his\nmoney freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and\nrelieve the poor.  Family pride, and filial pride–for he is very\nproud of what his father was–have done this.  Not to appear to\ndisgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or\nlose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive.\nHe has also brotherly pride, which, with some brotherly\naffection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his\nsister, and you will hear him generally cried up as the most\nattentive and best of brothers.”",
        "“What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?”",
        "He shook his head.  “I wish I could call her amiable.  It gives\nme pain to speak ill of a Darcy.  But she is too much like her\nbrother–very, very proud.  As a child, she was affectionate\nand pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours\nand hours to her amusement.  But she is nothing to me now.\nShe is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I\nunderstand, highly accomplished.  Since her father’s death,\nher home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and\nsuperintends her education.”",
        "After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth\ncould not help reverting once more to the first, and saying:",
        "“I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley!  How can Mr.\nBingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe,\ntruly amiable, be in friendship with such a man?  How can they\nsuit each other?  Do you know Mr. Bingley?”",
        "“Not at all.”",
        "“He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man.  He cannot\nknow what Mr. Darcy is.”",
        "“Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses.  He\ndoes not want abilities.  He can be a conversible companion if he\nthinks it worth his while.  Among those who are at all his equals\nin consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the\nless prosperous.  His pride never deserts him; but with the rich\nhe is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and\nperhaps agreeable–allowing something for fortune and figure.”",
        "The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players\ngathered round the other table and Mr. Collins took his station\nbetween his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips.  The usual\ninquiries as to his success was made by the latter.  It had not\nbeen very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs. Phillips\nbegan to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with\nmuch earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that\nhe considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged that she\nwould not make herself uneasy.",
        "“I know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down\nto a card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and\nhappily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings\nany object.  There are undoubtedly many who could not say the\nsame, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed\nfar beyond the necessity of regarding little matters.”",
        "Mr. Wickham’s attention was caught; and after observing Mr.\nCollins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice\nwhether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the\nfamily of de Bourgh.",
        "“Lady Catherine de Bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given\nhim a living.  I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first\nintroduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her\nlong.”",
        "“You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady\nAnne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the\npresent Mr. Darcy.”",
        "“No, indeed, I did not.  I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine’s\nconnections.  I never heard of her existence till the day before\nyesterday.”",
        "“Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune,\nand it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two\nestates.”",
        "This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor\nMiss Bingley.  Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and\nuseless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself,\nif he were already self-destined for another.",
        "“Mr. Collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of Lady Catherine\nand her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related\nof her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in\nspite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited\nwoman.”",
        "“I believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied Wickham;\n“I have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that\nI never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and\ninsolent.  She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible\nand clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities\nfrom her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner,\nand the rest from the pride for her nephew, who chooses that\neveryone connected with him should have an understanding of\nthe first class.”",
        "Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it,\nand they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction\ntill supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies\ntheir share of Mr. Wickham’s attentions.  There could be no\nconversation in the noise of Mrs. Phillips’s supper party, but\nhis manners recommended him to everybody.  Whatever he said,\nwas said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully.  Elizabeth\nwent away with her head full of him.  She could think of nothing\nbut of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way\nhome; but there was not time for her even to mention his name\nas they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent.\nLydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had\nlost and the fish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the\ncivility of Mr. and Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in\nthe least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes\nat supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins,\nhad more to say than he could well manage before the carriage\nstopped at Longbourn House.",
