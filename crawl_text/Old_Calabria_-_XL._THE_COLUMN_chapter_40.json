        "“Two hours–three hours–four hours: according!”",
        "The boatmen are still eager for the voyage. It all depends, as before,\nupon the wind.",
        "And day   after day   the Ionian lies before us–immaculate, immutable.",
        "I determined to approach the column by land. A mule was discovered, and\nstarting from the “Concordia” rather late in the morning, reached the\ntemple-ruin in two hours to the minute. I might have been tempted to\nlinger by the way but for the intense sunshine and for the fact that the\nmuleteer was an exceptionally dull dog–a dusky youth of the taciturn\nand wooden-faced Spanish variety, whose anti-Hellenic profile irked me,\nin that landscape. The driving road ends at the cemetery. Thence onward\na pathway skirts the sea at the foot of the clay-hills; passes the\nsunken wells; climbs up and down steepish gradients and so attains the\nplateau at whose extremity stands the lighthouse, the column, and a few\nwhite bungalows–summer-residences of Cotrone citizens.",
        "A day of shimmering heat. . . .",
        "The ground is parched. Altogether, it is a poor and thinly peopled\nstretch of land between Cotrone and Capo Rizzuto. No wonder the wolves\nare famished. Nine days ago one of them actually ventured upon the road\nnear the cemetery, in daylight.",
        "Yet there is some plant-life, and I was pleased to see, emerging from\nthe bleak sand-dunes, the tufts of the well-known and conspicuous sea\nlily in full flower. Wishful to obtain a few blossoms, I asked the boy\nto descend from his mule, but he objected.",
        "“Non si toccano questi fiori,” he said. These flowers are not to be\ntouched.",
        "Their odour displeased him. Like the Arab, the uncultivated Italian is\ninsensitive to certain smells that revolt us; while he cannot endure, on\nthe other hand, the scent of some flowers. I have seen a man professing\nto feel faint at the odour of crushed geranium leaves. They are fiori\ndi morti, he says: planted (sometimes) in graveyards.",
        "The last remarkable antiquity found at this site, to my knowledge, is a\nstone vase, fished up some years ago out of the sea, into which it may\nhave fallen while being carried off by pious marauders for the purpose\nof figuring as font in some church (unless, indeed, the land has sunk at\nthis point, as there is some evidence to show). I saw it, shortly after\nits return to dry land, in a shed near the harbour of Cotrone; the\nTaranto museum has now claimed it. It is a basin of purple-veined\npavonazzetto marble. Originally a monolith, it now consists of two\nfragments; the third and smallest is still missing. This noble relic\nstands about 85 centimetres in height and measures some 215 centimetres\nin circumference; it was never completed, as can be seen by the rim,\nwhich is still partially in the rough. A similar vessel is figured, I\nbelieve, in Tischbein.",
        "The small villa-settlement on this promontory is deserted owing to lack\nof water, every drop of which has to be brought hither by sea from\nCotrone. One wonders why they have not thought of building a cistern to\ncatch the winter rains, if there are any; for a respectable stone crops\nup at this end of the peninsula.",
        "One often wonders at things. . . .",
        "The column has been underpinned and strengthened by a foundation of\ncement; rains of centuries had begun to threaten its base, and there was\nsome risk of a catastrophe. Near at hand are a few ancient walls of\nreticulated masonry in strangely leaning attitudes, peopled by black\ngoats; on the ground I picked up some chips of amphorse and vases, as\nwell as a fragment of the limb of a marble statue. The site of this\npillar, fronting the waves, is impressively forlorn. And it was rather\nthoughtful, after all, of the despoiling Bishop Lucifero to leave two of\nthe forty-eight columns standing upright on the spot, as a sample of the\nlocal Doric style. One has fallen to earth since his day. Nobody would\nhave complained at the time, if he had stolen all of them, instead of\nonly forty-six. I took a picture of the survivor; then wandered a little\napart, in the direction of the shore, and soon found myself in a\nsolitude of burning stones, a miniature Sahara.",
        "The temple has vanished, together with the sacred grove that once\nembowered it; the island of Calypso, where Swinburne took his ease (if\nsuch it was), has sunk into the purple realms of Glaucus; the corals and\nsea-beasts that writhed among its crevices are en-gulphed under mounds\nof submarine sand. There was life, once, at this promontory. Argosies\ntouched here, leaving priceless gifts; fountains flowed, and cornfields\nwaved in the genial sunshine. Doubtless there will be life again; earth\nand sea are only waiting for the enchanter’s wand.",
        "All now lies bare, swooning in summer stagnation.",
        "Calabria is not a land to traverse alone. It is too wistful and\nstricken; too deficient in those externals that conduce to comfort. Its\ncharms do not appeal to the eye of romance, and the man who would\nperambulate Magna Graecia as he does the Alps would soon regret his\nchoice. One needs something of that “human element” which delighted the\ngenteel photographer of Morano–comrades, in short; if only those sages,\nlike old Noia Molisi, who have fallen under the spell of its ancient\nglories. The joys of Calabria are not to be bought, like those of\nSwitzerland, for gold.",
        "Sir Giovati Battista di Noia Molisi, the last of his family and name,\nhaving no sons and being come to old age without further hope of\noffspring, has desired in the place of children to leave of himself an\neternal memory to mankind– to wit, this Chronicle of the most Ancient,\nMagnificent, and Faithful City of Cotrone. A worthier effort at\nself-perpetuation than that of Strangoli. . . .",
        "A sturgeon, he notes, was caught in 1593 by the Spanish Castellan of the\ntown. This nobleman, puzzling whom he could best honour with so rare a\ndainty, despatched it by means of a man on horseback to the Duke of\nNocera. The Duke was no less surprised than pleased; he thought mighty\nwell of the sturgeon and of the respectful consideration which prompted\nthe gift; and then, by another horseman, sent it to Noia Molisi’s own\nuncle, accompanied, we may conjecture, by some ceremonious compliment\nbefitting the occasion.",
        "A man of parts, therefore, our author’s uncle, to whom his Lordship of\nNocera sends table-delicacies by mounted messenger; and himself a mellow\ncomrade whom I am loath to leave; his pages are distinguished by a\npleasing absence of those saintly paraphernalia which hang like a fog\nathwart the fair sky of the south.",
        "Yet to him and to all of them I must bid good-bye, here and now. At this\nhour to-morrow I shall be far from Cotrone.",
        "Farewell to Capialbi, inspired bookworm! And to Lenormant.",
        "On a day like this, the scholar sailed at Bivona over a sea so unruffled\nthat the barque seemed to be suspended in air. The water’s surface, he\ntells us, is “unie comme une glace.” He sees the vitreous depths invaded\nby piercing sunbeams that light up its mysterious forests of algae, its\nrock-headlands and silvery stretches of sand; he peers down into these\n“prairies pelagiennes” and beholds all their wondrous fauna–the\nurchins, the crabs, the floating fishes and translucent medusae\n“semblables a des clochettes d’opale.” Then, realizing how this\n“population pullulante des petits animaux marins” must have impressed\nthe observing ancients, he goes on to touch–ever so lightly!–upon\nthose old local arts of ornamentation whereby sea-beasts and molluscs\nand aquatic plants were reverently copied by master-hand, not from dead\nspecimens, but “pris sur le vif et observes au milieu des eaux\"; he\nexplains how an entire school grew up, which drew its inspiration from\nthe dainty ... apes and movements of these frail creatures. This is au\nmeilleur Lenormant. His was a full-blooded yet discriminating zest of\nknowledge. One wonders what more was fermenting in that restlessly\ncurious brain, when a miserable accident ended his short life, after 120\ndays of suffering.",
        "So Italy proved fatal to him, as Greece to his father. But one of his\nhappiest moments must have been spent on the sea at Bivona, on that\nclear summer day–a day such as this, when every nerve tingles with joy\nof life.",
        "Meanwhile it is good to rest here, immovable but alert, in the\nbreathless hush of noon. Showers of benevolent heat stream down upon\nthis desolation; not the faintest wisp of vapour floats upon the\nhorizon; not a sail, not a ripple, disquiets the waters. The silence can\nbe felt. Slumber is brooding over the things of earth:",
        "Asleep are the peaks of the hills, and the vales,",
        "The promontories, the clefts,",
        "And all the creatures that move upon the black earth. . . .",
        "Such torrid splendour, drenching a land of austerut simplicity,\ndecomposes the mind into corresponding states of primal contentment and\nresilience. There arises before our phantasy a new perspective of human\naffairs; a suggestion of well-being wherein the futile complexities and\ndisharmonies of our age shall have no place. To discard these wrappings,\nto claim kinship with some elemental and robust archetype, lover of\nearth and sun-----",
        "How fair they are, these moments of golden equipoise!",
        "Yes; it is good to be merged awhile into these harshly-vibrant\nsurroundings, into the meridian glow of all things. This noontide is the\n“heavy” hour of the Greeks, when temples are untrodden by priest or\nworshipper. Controra they now call it–the ominous hour. Man and\nbeast are fettered in sleep, while spirits walk abroad, as at midnight.\nNon timebis a timore noctuno: a sagitta volante in aie: a negotio\nperambulante in tenebris: ab incursu et demonio meridiano. The midday\ndemon–that southern Haunter of calm blue spaces. . . .",
        "So may some enchantment of kindlier intent have crept over Phaedrus and\nhis friend, at converse in the noontide under the whispering plane-tree.\nAnd the genius dwelling about this old headland of the Column is candid\nand benign.",
        "This corner of Magna Graecia is a severely parsimonious manifestation of\nnature. Rocks and waters! But these rocks and waters are actualities;\nthe stuff whereof man is made. A landscape so luminous, so resolutely\nscornful of accessories, hints at brave and simple forms of expression;\nit brings us to the ground, where we belong; it medicines to the disease\nof introspection and stimulates a capacity which we are in danger of\nunlearning amid our morbid hyperborean gloom–the capacity for honest\ncontempt: contempt of that scarecrow of a theory which would have us\nneglect what is earthly, tangible. What is life well lived but a blithe\ndiscarding of primordial husks, of those comfortable intangibilities\nthat lurk about us, waiting for our weak moments?",
        "The sage, that perfect savage, will be the last to withdraw himself from\nthe influence of these radiant realities. He will strive to knit closer\nthe bond, and to devise a more durable and affectionate relationship\nbetween himself and them. Let him open his eyes. For a reasonable\nadjustment lies at his feet. From these brown stones that seam the\ntranquil Ionian, from this gracious solitude, he can carve out, and bear\naway into the cheerful din of cities, the rudiments of something clean\nand veracious and wholly terrestrial–some tonic philosophy that shall\nfoster sunny mischiefs and farewell regret.",
