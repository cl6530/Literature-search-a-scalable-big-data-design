        "It may be well before going further to gather together the results so\nfar reached.",
        "Browning was aware of the conflict of the religious and moral\nconsciousness, but he did not hesitate to give to each of them its most\nuncompromising utterance. And it is on this account that he is\ninstructive; for, whatever may be the value of compromise in practical\naffairs, there is no doubt that it has never done anything to advance\nhuman thought. His religion is an optimistic faith, a peaceful\nconsciousness of the presence of the highest in man, and therefore in\nall other things. Yet he does not hesitate to represent the moral life\nas a struggle with evil, and a movement through error towards a highest\ngood which is never finally realized. He sees that the contradiction is\nnot an absolute one, but that a good man is always both moral and\nreligious, and, in every good act he does, transcends their difference.\nHe knew that the ideal apart from the process is nothing, and that “a\nGod beyond the stars” is simply the unknowable. But he knew, too, that\nthe ideal is not merely the process, but also that which starts the\nprocess, guides it, and comes to itself through it. God, emptied of\nhuman elements, is a mere name; but, at the same time, the process of\nhuman evolution does not exhaust the idea of God. The process by itself,\ni.e., mere morality, is a conception of a fragment, a fiction of\nabstract thought; it is a movement which has no beginning or end; and in\nit neither the head nor the heart of man could find contentment. He is\ndriven by ethics into philosophy, and by morality into religion.",
        "It was in this way that Browning found himself compelled to trace back\nthe moral process to its origin, and to identify the moral law with the\nnature of God. It is this that gives value to his view of moral\nprogress, as reaching beyond death to a higher stage of being, for which\nman’s attainments in this life are only preliminary.",
        "  “What’s time? Leave Now for dogs and apes,\n  Man has Forever.\"[A]",
        "[Footnote A: Grammarian’s Funeral.]",
        "There are other “adventures brave and new” for man, “more lives yet,\"\nother ways of warfare, other depths of goodness and heights of love. The\npoet lifts the moral ideal into infinitude, and removes all limits to\nthe possibility and necessity of being good. Nay, the process itself is\ngood. Moral activity is its own bountiful reward; for moral progress,\nwhich means struggle, is the best thing in the world or out of it. To\nend such a process, to stop that activity, were therefore evil. But it\ncannot end, for it is the self-manifestation of the divine life. There\nis plenty of way to make, for the ideal is absolute goodness. The\nprocess cannot exhaust the absolute, and it is impossible that man\nshould be God. And yet this process is the process of the absolute, the\nworking of the ideal, the presence of the highest in man as a living\npower realizing itself in his acts and in his thoughts. And the absolute\ncannot fail; not in man, for the process is the evolution of his\nessential nature; and not in the world, for that is but the necessary\ninstrument of the evolution. By lifting the moral ideal of man to\ninfinitude, the poet has identified it with the nature of God, and made\nit the absolute law of things.",
        "Now, this idea of the identity of the human and the divine is a\nperfectly familiar Christian idea.",
        "  “Thence shall I, approved\n  A man, for aye removed\n  From the developed brute; a God though in the germ.\"[A]",
        "[Footnote A: Rabbi Ben Ezra.]",
        "This idea is involved in the ordinary expressions of religious thought.\nBut, nevertheless, both theology and philosophy shrink from giving to it\na clear and unembarrassed utterance. Instead of rising to the sublime\nboldness of the Nazarene Teacher, they set up prudential differences\nbetween God and man–differences not of degree only but of nature; and,\nin consequence, God is reduced into an unknowable absolute, and man is\nmade incapable not only of moral, but also of intellectual life. The\npoet himself has proved craven-hearted in this, as we shall see. He,\ntoo, sets up insurmountable barriers between the divine and the human,\nand thereby weakens both his religious and his moral convictions. His\nmoral inspiration is greatest just where his religious enthusiasm is\nmost intense. In Rabbi Ben Ezra, The Death in the Desert, and The\nRing and the Book, there prevails a constant sense of the community of\nGod and man within the realm of goodness; and the world itself, “with\nits dread machinery of sin and sorrow,” is made to join the great\nconspiracy, whose purpose is at once the evolution of man’s character,\nand the realization of the will of God.",
        "  “So, the All-Great, were the All-Loving too–\n  So, through the thunder comes a human voice\n  Saying, ’O heart I made, a heart beats here!\n  Face, my hands fashioned, see it in myself!\n  Thou hast no power nor may’st conceive of mine,\n  But love I gave thee, with myself to love,\n  And thou must love Me who have died for thee.’\"[A]",
        "[Footnote A: An Epistle from Karshish.]",
        "But, if we follow Browning’s thoughts in his later and more reflective\npoems, such as Ferishtah’s Fancies for instance, it will not be\npossible to hold that the poet altogether realized the importance for\nboth morality and religion alike, of the idea of the actual immanence of\nGod in man. In these poems he seems to have abandoned it in favour of\nthe hypotheses of a more timid philosophy. But, if his religious faith\nhad not been embarrassed by certain dogmatic presuppositions of which he\ncould not free himself, he might have met more successfully some of the\ndifficulties which later reflection revealed to him, and might have been\nable to set a true value on that “philosophy,” which betrayed his faith\nwhile appearing to support it.",
        "But, before trying to criticize the principle by means of which Browning\nsought to reconcile the moral and religious elements of human life, it\nmay be well to give it a more explicit and careful statement.",
        "What, then, is that principle of unity between the divine and the human?\nHow can we interpret the life of man as God’s life in man, so that man,\nin attaining the moral ideal proper to his own nature, is at the same\ntime fulfilling ends which may justly be called divine?",
        "The poet, in early life and in late life alike, has one answer to this\nquestion–an answer given with the confidence of complete conviction.\nThe meeting-point of God and man is love. Love, in other words, is, for\nthe poet, the supreme principle both of morality and religion. Love,\nonce for all, solves that contradiction between them which, both in\ntheory and in practice, has embarrassed the world for so many ages. Love\nis the sublimest conception attainable by man; a life inspired by it is\nthe most perfect form of goodness he can conceive; therefore, love is,\nat the same moment, man’s moral ideal, and the very essence of Godhood.\nA life actuated by love is divine, whatever other limitations it may\nhave. Such is the perfection and glory of this emotion, when it has been\ntranslated into a self-conscious motive, and become the energy of an\nintelligent will, that it lifts him who owns it to the sublimest height\nof being.",
        "  “For the loving worm within its clod,\n  Were diviner than a loveless God\n  Amid his worlds, I will dare to say.\"[A]",
        "[Footnote A: Christmas Eve.]",
        "So excellent is this emotion that, if man, who has this power to love,\ndid not find the same power in God, then man would excel Him, and the\ncreature and Creator change parts.",
        "  “Do I find love so full in my nature, God’s ultimate gift,\n  That I doubt His own love can compete with it? Here, the parts shift?\n  Here, the creature surpass the Creator,–the end what Began?\"[B]",
        "[Footnote B: Saul.]",
        "Not so, says David, and with him no doubt the poet himself. God is\nHimself the source and fulness of love.",
        "        “Tis Thou, God, that givest, ’tis I who receive:\n  In the first is the last, in Thy will is my power to believe.\n  All’s one gift.”",
        "  “Would I suffer for him that I love? So would’st Thou,–so wilt Thou!\n  So shall crown Thee, the topmost, ineffablest, uttermost crown–\n  And Thy love fill infinitude wholly, nor leave up nor down\n  One spot for the creature to stand in!\"[A]",
        "[Footnote A: Saul.]",
        "And this same love not only constitutes the nature of God and the moral\nideal of man, but it is also the purpose and essence of all created\nbeing, both animate and inanimate.",
        "                          “This world’s no blot for us,\n  Nor blank; it means intensely and means good.\"[B]",
        "[Footnote B: Fra Lippo Lippi.]",
        "  “O world, as God has made it! All is beauty:\n  And knowing this is love, and love is duty,\n  What further may be sought for or declared?”",
        "In this world then “all’s love, yet all’s law.” God permits nothing to\nbreak through its universal sway, even the very wickedness and misery of\nlife are brought into the scheme of good, and, when rightly understood,\nreveal themselves as its means.",
        "  “I can believe this dread machinery\n  Of sin and sorrow, would confound me else,\n  Devised–all pain, at most expenditure\n  Of pain by Who devised pain–to evolve,\n  By new machinery in counterpart,\n  The moral qualities of man–how else?–\n  To make him love in turn and be beloved,\n  Creative and self-sacrificing too,\n  And thus eventually Godlike.\"[C]",
        "[Footnote C: The Ring and the Book–The Pope, 1375-1383.]",
        "The poet thus brings the natural world, the history of man, and the\nnature of God, within the limits of the same conception. The idea of\nlove solves for Browning all the enigmas of human life and thought.",
        "          “The thing that seems\n  Mere misery, under human schemes,\n  Becomes, regarded by the light\n  Of love, as very near, or quite\n  As good a gift as joy before.\"[A]",
        "[Footnote A: Easter Day.]",
        "Taking Browning’s work as a whole, it is scarcely possible to deny that\nthis is at once the supreme motive of his art, and the principle on\nwhich his moral and religious doctrine rests. He is always strong and\nconvincing when he is dealing with this theme. It was evidently his own\ndeepest conviction, and it gave him the courage to face the evils of the\nworld, and the power as an artist to “contrive his music from its\nmoans.” It plays, in his philosophy of life, the part that Reason fills\nfor Hegel, or the Blind Will for Schopenhauer; and he is as fearless as\nthey are in reducing all phenomena into forms of the activity of his\nfirst principle. Love not only gave him firm footing amid the wash and\nwelter of the present world, where time spins fast, life fleets, and all\nis change, but it made him look forward with joy to “the immortal\ncourse\"; for, to him, all the universe is love-woven. All life is but\ntreading the “love-way,” and no wanderer can finally lose it. “The\nway-faring men, though fools, shall not err therein.”",
        "Since love has such an important place in Browning’s theory of life, it\nis necessary to see what he means by it. For love has had for different\nindividuals, ages and nations, a very different significance; and almost\nevery great poet has given it a different interpretation. And this is\nnot unnatural. For love is a passion which, beginning with youth and the\nhey-day of the blood, expands with the expanding life, and takes new\nforms of beauty and goodness at every stage. And this is equally true,\nwhether we speak of the individual or of the human race.",
        "Love is no accident in man’s history, nor a passing emotion. It is\nrather a constitutive element of man’s nature, fundamental and necessary\nas his intelligence. And, like everything native and constitutive, it is\nobedient to the law of evolution, which is the law of man’s being; and\nit passes, therefore, through ever varying forms. To it–if we may for\nthe moment make a distinction between the theoretical and practical\nlife, or between ideas and their causative potency–must be attributed\nthe constructive power which has built the world of morality, with its\nintangible but most real relations which bind man to man and age to age.\nIt is the author of the organic institutions which, standing between the\nindividual and the rudeness of nature, awaken in him the need, and give\nhim the desire and the faculty, of attaining higher things than physical\nsatisfaction. Man is meant to act as well as to think, to be virtuous as\nwell as to have knowledge. It is possible that reverence for the\nintellect may have led men, at times, to attribute the evolution of the\nrace too exclusively to the theoretic consciousness, forgetting that,\nalong with reason, there co-operates a twin power in all that is wisest\nand best in us, and that a heart which can love, is as essential a\npre-condition of all worthy attainment, as an intellect which can see.\nLove and reason[A] are equally primal powers in man, and they reflect\nmight into each other: for love increases knowledge, and knowledge love.\nIt is their combined power that gives interest and meaning to the facts\nof life, and transmutes them into a moral and intellectual order. They,\ntogether, are lifting man out of the isolation and chaos of subjectivity\ninto membership in a spiritual kingdom, where collision and exclusion\nare impossible, and all are at once kings and subjects.",
        "[Footnote A: It would be more correct to say the reason that is loving\nor the love that is rational; for, though there is distinction, there is\nno dualism.]",
        "And, just as reason is present as a transmuting power in the sensational\nlife of the infancy of the individual and race, so is love present\namidst the confused and chaotic activity of the life that knows no law\nother than its own changing emotions. Both make for order, and both grow\nwith it. Both love and reason have travelled a long way in the history\nof man. The patriot’s passion for his country, the enthusiasm of pity\nand helpfulness towards all suffering which marks the man of God, are as\nfar removed from the physical attraction of sex for sex, and the mere\nliking of the eye and ear, as is the intellectual power of the sage from\nthe vulpine cunning of the savage. “For,” as Emerson well said, “it is a\nfire that, kindling its first embers in the narrow nook of a private\nbosom, caught from a wandering spark out of another heart, glows and\nenlarges until it warms and beams upon multitudes of men and women, upon\nthe universal heart of all, and so lights up the world and all nature\nwith its generous flames.” Both love and reason alike pass through stage\nafter stage, always away from the particularity of selfishness and\nignorance, into larger and larger cycles of common truth and goodness,\ntowards the full realization of knowledge and benevolence, which is the\ninheritance of emancipated man. In this transition, the sensuous play of\nfeeling within man, and the sensitive responses to external stimuli, are\nmade more and more organic to ends which are universal, that is, to\nspiritual ends. Love, which in its earliest form, seems to be the\nnatural yearning of brute for brute, appearing and disappearing at the\nsuggestion of physical needs, passes into an idealized sentiment, into\nan emotion of the soul, into a principle of moral activity which\nmanifests itself in a permanent outflow of helpful deeds for man. It\nrepresents, when thus sublimated, one side at least of the expansion of\nthe self, which culminates when the world beats in the pulse of the\nindividual, and the joys and sorrows, the defeats and victories of\nmankind are felt by him as his own. It is no longer dependent merely on\nthe incitement of youth, grace, beauty, whether of body or character; it\ntranscends all limitations of sex and age, and finds objects on which it\ncan spend itself in all that God has made, even in that which has\nviolated its own law of life and become mean and pitiful. It becomes a\nlove of fallen humanity, and an ardour to save it by becoming the\nconscious and permanent motive of all men. The history of this evolution\nof love has been written by the poets. Every phase through which this\never-deepening emotion has passed, every form which this primary power\nhas taken in its growth, has received from them its own proper\nexpression. They have made even the grosser instincts lyric with beauty;\nand, ascending with their theme, they have sung the pure passion of soul\nfor soul, its charm and its strength, its idealism and heroism, up to\nthe point at which, in Browning, it transcends the limits of finite\nexistence, sheds all its earthly vesture, and becomes a spiritual\nprinciple of religious aspiration and self-surrender to God.",
        "Browning nowhere shows his native strength more clearly than in his\ntreatment of love. He has touched this world-old theme–which almost\nevery poet has handled, and handled in his highest manner–with that\nfreshness and insight, which is possible only to the inborn originality\nof genius. Other poets have, in some ways, given to love a more\nexquisite utterance, and rendered its sweetness, and tenderness, and\ncharm with a lighter grace. It may even be admitted that there are poets\nwhose verses have echoed more faithfully the fervour and intoxication of\npassion, and who have shown greater power of interpreting it in the\nlight of a mystic idealism. But, in one thing, Browning stands alone. He\nhas given to love a moral significance, a place and power amongst those\nsubstantial elements on which rest the dignity of man’s being and the\ngreatness of his destiny, in a way which is, I believe, without example\nin any other poet. And he has done this by means of that moral and\nreligious earnestness, which pervades all his poetry. The one object of\nsupreme interest to him is the development of the soul, and his\npenetrative insight revealed to him the power to love as the paramount\nfact in that development. To love, he repeatedly tells us, is the sole\nand supreme object of man’s life; it is the one lesson which he has to\nlearn on earth; and, love once learnt, in what way matters little, “it\nleaves completion in the soul.” Love we dare not, and, indeed, cannot\nabsolutely miss. No man can be absolutely selfish and be man.",
        "  “Beneath the veriest ash, there hides a spark of soul\n  Which, quickened by love’s breath, may yet pervade the whole\n  O’ the grey, and, free again, be fire; of worth the same,\n  Howe’er produced, for, great or little, flame is flame.\"[A]",
        "[Footnote A: Fifine at the Fair, xliii.]",
        "Love, once evoked, once admitted into the soul,",
        "                          “adds worth to worth,\n  As wine enriches blood, and straightway sends it forth,\n  Conquering and to conquer, through all eternity,\n  That’s battle without end.\"[B]",
        "[Footnote B: Ibid. liv.]",
        "This view of the significance of love grew on Browning as his knowledge\nof man’s nature and destiny became fuller and deeper, while, at the same\ntime, his trust in the intellect became less. Even in Paracelsus he\nreveals love, not as a sentiment or intoxicating passion, as one might\nexpect from a youthful poet, but as one of the great fundamental\n“faculties” of man. Love, “blind, oft-failing, half-enlightened,\noften-chequered trust,” though it be, still makes man",
        "  “The heir of hopes too fair to turn out false.”",
        "In that poem, love is definitely lifted by the poet to the level of\nknowledge. Intellectual gain, apart from love, is folly and futility,\nworthless for the individual and worthless to the race. “Mind is nothing\nbut disease,” Paracelsus cries in the bitterness of his disappointment,\n“and natural health is ignorance\"; and he asks of the mad poet who\n“loved too rashly,”",
        "  “Are we not halves of one dissevered world,\n  Whom this strange chance unites once more? Part? Never!\n  Till thou the lover, know; and I, the knower,\n  Love–until both are saved.\"[A]",
        "[Footnote A: Paracelsus.]",
        "And, at the end of the poem, Paracelsus, coming to an understanding with\nhimself as to the gain and loss of life, proclaims with his last\nstrength the truth he had missed throughout his great career, namely,\nthe supreme worth of love.",
        "  “I saw Aprile–my Aprile there!\n  And as the poor melodious wretch disburthened\n  His heart, and moaned his weakness in my ear,\n  I learned my own deep error; love’s undoing\n  Taught me the worth of love in man’s estate,\n  And what proportion love should hold with power\n  In his right constitution; love preceding\n  Power, and with much power, always much more love;\n  Love still too straitened in his present means,\n  And earnest for new power to set love free.”",
        "As long as he hated men, or, in his passionate pursuit of truth, was\nindifferent to their concerns, it was not strange that he saw no good in\nmen and failed to help them. Knowledge without love is not trueknowledge, but folly and weakness.",
        "But, great as is the place given to love in Paracelsus, it is far less\nthan that given to it in the poet’s later works. In Ferishtah’s\nFancies and La Saisiaz it is no longer rivalled by knowledge; nor\neven in Easter Day, where the voice beside the poet proclaiming that",
        "  “Life is done,\n  Time ends, Eternity’s begun,”",
        "gives a final pronouncement upon the purposes of the life of man. The\nworld of sense–of beauty and art, of knowledge and truth, are given to\nman, but none of them satisfy his spirit; they merely sting with hunger\nfor something better. “Deficiency gapes every side,” till love is known\nas the essence and worth of all things.",
        "                  “Is this thy final choice?\n  Love is the best? ’Tis somewhat late!\n  And all thou dost enumerate\n  Of power and beauty in the world,\n  The righteousness of love was curled\n  Inextricably round about.\n  Love lay within it and without,\n  To clasp thee,–but in vain! Thy soul\n  Still shrunk from Him who made the whole,\n  Still set deliberate aside\n  His love!–Now take love! Well betide\n  Thy tardy conscience!\"[A]",
        "[Footnote A: Easter Day.]",
        "In his later reflective poems, in which he deals with the problems of\nlife in the spirit of a metaphysician, seeking a definite answer to the\nquestions of the intelligence, he declares the reason for his preference\nof love to knowledge. In La Saisiaz he states that man’s love is God’s\ntoo, a spark from His central fire; but man’s knowledge is man’s only.\nKnowledge is finite, limited and tinged with sense. The truth we reach\nat best is only truth for us, relative, distorted. We are for ever\nkept from the fact which is supposed to be given; our intellects play\nabout it; sense and even intellect itself are interposing media, which\nwe must use, and yet, in using them, we only fool ourselves with\nsemblances. The poet has now grown so cautious that he will not declare\nhis own knowledge to be valid for any other man. David Hume could\nscarcely be more suspicious of the human intellect; nor Berkeley more\nsurely persuaded of the purely subjective nature of its attainments. In\nfact, the latter relied on human knowledge in a way impossible to\nBrowning, for he regarded it as the language of spirit speaking to\nspirit. Out of his experience, Browning says,",
        "                            “There crowds conjecture manifold.\n  But, as knowledge, this comes only,–things may be as I behold\n  Or may not be, but, without me and above me, things there are;\n  I myself am what I know not–ignorance which proves no bar\n  To the knowledge that I am, and, since I am, can recognize\n  What to me is pain and pleasure: this is sure, the rest–surmise.\"[A]",
        "[Footnote A: La Saisiaz.]",
        "Thought itself, for aught he knows, may be afflicted with a kind of\ncolour-blindness; and he knows no appeal when one affirms “green as\ngrass,” and another contradicts him with “red as grass.” Under such\ncircumstances, it is not strange that Browning should decline to speak\nexcept for himself, and that he will",
        "  “Nowise dare to play the spokesman for my brothers strong or weak,”",
        "or that he will far less presume to pronounce for God, and pretend that\nthe truth finds utterance from lips of clay–",
        "  “Pass off human lisp as echo of the sphere-song out of reach.”",
        "  “Have I knowledge? Confounded it shrivels at Wisdom laid bare!\n  Have I forethought? how purblind, how blank, to the Infinite Care!",
        "  “And thus looking within and around me, I ever renew\n  (With that stoop of the soul, which in bending upraises it too)\n  The submission of man’s nothing-perfect to God’s all-complete,\n  As by each new obeisance in spirit, I climb to His feet.\"[B]",
        "[Footnote B: Saul, III.]",
        "But David finds in himself one faculty so supreme in worth that he keeps\nit in abeyance–",
        "  “Lest, insisting to claim and parade in it, wot ye, I worst\n  E’en the Giver in one gift.–Behold, I could love if I durst!\n  But I sink the pretension as fearing a man may o’ertake\n  God’s own speed in the one way of love: I abstain for love’s sake.\"[A]",
        "[Footnote A: Saul, III.]",
        "This faculty of love, so far from being tainted with finitude, like\nknowledge; so far from being mere man’s, or a temporary and deceptive\npower given to man for temporary uses, by a Creator who has another\nineffably higher way of loving, as He has of truth, is itself divine. In\ncontrast with the activity of love, Omnipotence itself dwindles into\ninsignificance, and creation sinks into a puny exercise of power. Love,\nin a word, is the highest good; and, as such, it has all its worth in\nitself, and gives to all other things what worth they have. God Himself\ngains the “ineffable crown” by showing love and saving the weak. It is\nthe power divine, the central energy of God’s being.",
        "Browning never forgets this moral or religious quality of love. So pure\nis this emotion to the poet, “so perfect in whiteness, that it will not\ntake pollution; but, ermine-like, is armed from dishonour by its own\nsoft snow.” In the corruptest hearts, amidst the worst sensuality, love\nis still a power divine, making for all goodness. Even when it is\nkindled into flame by an illicit touch, and wars against the life of the\nfamily, which is its own product, its worth is supreme. He who has\nlearned to love in any way, has “caught God’s secret.” How he has caught\nit, whom he loves, whether or not he is loved in return, all these\nthings matter little. The paramount question on which hangs man’s fate\nis, has he learned to love another, any other, Fifine or Elvire. “She\nhas lost me,” said the unloved lover; “I have gained her. Her soul’s\nmine.”",
        "The supreme worth of love, the mere emotion itself, however called into\nactivity, secures it against all taint. No one who understands Browning\nin the least, can accuse him of touching with a rash hand the sanctity\nof the family; rather he places it on the basis of its own principle,\nand thereby makes for it the strongest defence. Such love as he speaks\nof, however irregular its manifestation or sensuous its setting, can\nnever be confounded with lust–\"hell’s own blue tint.” It is further\nremoved from lust even than asceticism. It has not even a negative\nattitude towards the flesh; but finds the flesh to be “stuff for\ntransmuting,” and reduces it to the uses of the spirit. The love which\nis sung by Browning is more pure and free, and is set in a higher\naltitude than anything that can be reached by the way of negation. It is\na consecration of the undivided self, so that “soul helps not flesh\nmore, than flesh helps soul.” It is not only a spiritual and divine\nemotion, but it also “shows a heart within blood-tinctured with a veined\nhumanity.”",
        "  “Be a God and hold me\n    With a charm!\n  Be a man and hold me\n    With thine arm!",
        "  “Teach me, only teach, Love!\n    As I ought\n  I will speak thy speech, Love!\n    Think thy thought–",
        "  “Meet, if thou require it,\n    Both demands,\n  Laying flesh and spirit\n    In thy hands.\"[A]",
        "[Footnote A: A Woman’s Last Word.]",
        "True love is always an infinite giving, which holds nothing back. It is\na spendthrift, magnificent in its recklessness, squandering the very\nessence of the self upon its object, and by doing so, in the end\nenriching the self beyond all counting. For in loving, the individual\nbecomes re-impersonated in another; the distinction of Me and Thee is\nswept away, and there pulses in two individuals one warm life.",
        "  “If two lives join, there is oft a scar\n    They are one and one with a shadowy third;\n  One near one is too far.",
        "  “A moment after, and hands unseen\n    Were hanging the night around us fast;\n  But we knew that a bar was broken between\n    Life and life: we were mixed at last\n  In spite of the mortal screen.\"[B]",
        "[Footnote B: By the Fireside.]",
        "The throwing down of the limits that wall a man within himself, the\nmingling of his own deepest interests with those of others, always marks\nlove; be it love of man for maid, parent for child, or patriot for his\ncountry. It opens an outlet into the pure air of the world of objects,\nand enables man to escape from the stuffed and poisonous atmosphere of\nhis narrow self. It is a streaming outwards of the inmost treasures of\nthe spirit, a consecration of its best activities to the welfare of\nothers. And when this is known to be the native quality and quintessence\nof love, no one can regard it anywhere, or at any time, as out of place.\n“Prize-lawful or prize-lawless” it is ever a flower, even though it\ngrow, like the love of the hero of Turf and Towers, in slime. Lust,\nfleshly desire, which has been too often miscalled love, is its worst\nperversion. Love spends itself for another, and seeks satisfaction only\nin another’s good. But last uses up others for its own worst purposes,\nwastes its object, and turns the current of life back inwards, into the\nslush and filth of selfish pleasure. The distinction between love and\nits perversion, which is impossible in the naive life of an animal,\nought to be clear enough to all, and probably is. Nor should the sexual\nimpulse in human beings be confused with fleshly desire, and treated as\nif it were merely natural, “the mere lust of life” common to all living\nthings,–\"that strive,” as Spinoza put it, “to persevere in existing.\"\nFor there is no purely natural impulse in man; all that he is, is\ntransfused with spirit, whether he will or no. He cannot act as a mere\nanimal, because he cannot leave his rational nature behind him.",
        "He cannot desire as an innocent brute desires: his desire is always love\nor lust. We have as little right to say that the wisdom of the sage is\nnothing but the purblind savagery of a Terra del Fuegian, as we have\nto assert that love is nothing but a sexual impulse. That impulse\nrather, when its potency is set free, will show itself, at first\nconfusedly, but with more and more clearness as it expands, to be the\nyearning of soul for soul. It puts us “in training for a love which\nknows not sex, nor person, nor partiality; but which seeks virtue and\nwisdom everywhere, to the end of increasing virtue and wisdom.” The\nheight to which this passion lifts man, is just what makes possible the\nfall into a sensuality and excess of brutishness, in comparison with\nwhich animal life is a paradise of innocence.",
        "If this is clearly recognized, many of the idle questions of casuistry\nthat are sometimes raised regarding sexual love and marriage will cease\nto trouble. For these questions generally presuppose the lowest possible\nview of this passion. Browning shows us how to follow with serene\nsecurity the pure light of the emotion of love, amidst all the confused\nlawlessness of lustful passion, and through all the intricacies of human\ncharacter. Love, he thinks, is never illicit, never unwise, except when\nit is disloyal to itself; it never ruins, but always strives to enrich\nits object. Bacon quotes with approval a saying “That it is impossible\nto love, and to be wise.” Browning asserts that it is impossible to love\nand not be wise. It is a power that, according to the Christian idea\nwhich the poet adopts, has infinite goodness for its source, and that,\neven in its meanest expression, is always feeling its way back to its\norigin, flowing again into the ocean whence it came.",
        "So sparklingly pure is this passion that it could exorcise the evil and\nturn old to new, even in the case of Léonce Miranda. At least Browning,\nin this poem, strives to show that, being true love, though the love of\nan unclean man for an unclean woman, it was a power at war with the\nsordid elements of that sordid life. Love has always the same potency,\nflame is always flame,",
        "      “no matter whence flame sprung,\n  From gums and spice, or else from straw and rottenness.\"[A]",
        "[Footnote A: Fifine at the Fair, lv.]",
        "      “Let her but love you,\n  All else you disregard! what else can be?\n  You know how love is incompatible\n  With falsehood–purifies, assimilates\n  All other passions to itself.\"[B]",
        "[Footnote B: Colombe’s Birthday.]",
        "  “Ne’er wrong yourself so far as quote the world\n  And say, love can go unrequited here!\n  You will have blessed him to his whole life’s end–\n  Low passions hindered, baser cares kept back,\n  All goodness cherished where you dwelt–and dwell.\"[C]",
        "[Footnote C: Ibid.]",
        "But, while love is always a power lifting a man upwards to the level of\nits own origin from whatever depths of degradation, its greatest potency\ncan reveal itself only in characters intrinsically pure, such as\nPompilia and Caponsacchi. Like mercy and every other spiritual gift, it\nis mightiest in the mighty. In the good and great of the earth love is\nveritably seen to be God’s own energy;",
        "    “Who never is dishonoured in the spark\n  He gave us from His fire of fires, and bade\n  Remember whence it sprang, nor be afraid\n      While that burns on, though all the rest grow dark.\"[A]",
        "[Footnote A: Any Wife to Any Husband, III.]",
        "It were almost an endless task to recount the ways in which Browning\nexhibits the moralizing power of love: how it is for him the\nquintessence of all goodness; the motive, and inspiring cause, of every\nact in the world that is completely right; and how, on that account, it\nis the actual working in the man of the ideal of all perfection. This\ndoctrine of love is, in my opinion, the richest vein of pure ore in\nBrowning’s poetry.",
        "But it remains to follow briefly our poet’s treatment of love in another\ndirection–as a principle present, not only in God as creative and\nredeeming Power, and in man as the highest motive and energy of the\nmoral life, but also in the outer world, in the “material” universe. In\nthe view of the poet, the whole creation is nothing but love incarnate,\na pulsation from the divine heart. Love is the source of all law and of\nall beauty. “Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night speaketh\nknowledge. There is no speech or language where their voice is not\nheard.” And our poet speaks as if he had caught the meaning of the\nlanguage, and believes that all things speak of love–the love of God.",
        "“I think,” says the heroine of the Inn Album,",
        "  “Womanliness means only motherhood;\n  All love begins and ends there,–roams enough,\n  But, having run the circle, rests at home.\"[A]",
        "[Footnote A: The Inn Album.]",
        "And Browning detects something of this motherhood everywhere. He finds\nit as",
        "                          “Some cause\n  Such as is put into a tree, which turns\n  Away from the north wind with what nest it holds.\"[B]",
        "[Footnote B: The Ring and the Book–Canon Caponsacchi, 1374-1376.]",
        "The Pope–who, if any one, speaks for Browning–declares that",
        "      “Brute and bird, reptile and the fly,\n  Ay and, I nothing doubt, even tree, shrub, plant\n  And flower o’ the field, are all in a common pact\n  To worthily defend the trust of trusts,\n  Life from the Ever Living.\"[C]",
        "[Footnote C: The Ring and the Book–The Pope, 1076-1081.]",
        "“Because of motherhood,” said the minor pope in Ivàn Ivànovitch,",
        "                                  “each male\n  Yields to his partner place, sinks proudly in the scale:\n  His strength owned weakness, wit–folly, and courage–fear,\n  Beside the female proved males’s mistress–only here\n  The fox-dam, hunger-pined, will slay the felon sire\n  Who dares assault her whelp.”",
        "The betrayal of the mother’s trust is the “unexampled sin,” which scares\nthe world and shames God.",
        "  “I hold that, failing human sense,\n  The very earth had oped, sky fallen, to efface\n  Humanity’s new wrong, motherhood’s first disgrace.\"[A]",
        "[Footnote A: Ivàn Ivànovitch.]",
        "This instinct of love, which binds brute-parent to brute-offspring, is a\nkind of spiritual law in the natural world: it, like all law, guarantees\nthe continuity and unity of the world, and it is scarcely akin to merely\nphysical attraction. No doubt its basis is physical; it has an organism\nof flesh and blood for its vehicle and instrument: but mathematical\nphysics cannot explain it, nor can it be detected by chemical tests.\nRather, with the poet, we are to regard brute affection as a kind of\nrude outline of human love; as a law in nature, which, when understood\nby man and adopted as his rule of conduct, becomes the essence and\npotency of his moral life.",
        "Thus Browning regards love as an omnipresent good. There is nothing, he\ntells us in Fifine, which cannot reflect it; even moral putridity\nbecomes phosphorescent, “and sparks from heaven transpierce earth’s\ncoarsest covertures.”",
        "  “There is no good of life but love–but love!\n  What else looks good, is some shade flung from love,\n  Love gilds it, gives it worth.\"[B]",
        "[Footnote B: In a balcony.]",
        "There is no fact which, if seen to the heart, will not prove itself to\nhave love for its purpose, and, therefore, for its substance. And it is\non this account that everything finds its place in a kosmos and that\nthere is",
        "  “No detail but, in place allotted it, was prime\n  And perfect.\"[A]",
        "[Footnote A: Fifine at the Fair. xxxi.]",
        "Every event in the history of the world and of man is explicable, as the\nbursting into new form of this elemental, all-pervading power. The\npermanence in change of nature, the unity in variety, the strength which\nclothes itself in beauty, are all manifestations of love. Nature is not\nmerely natural; matter and life’s minute beginnings, are more than they\nseem. Paracelsus said that he knew and felt",
        "                 “What God is, what we are,\n  What life is–how God tastes an infinite joy\n  In finite ways–one everlasting bliss,\n  From whom all being emanates, all power\n  Proceeds: in whom is life for evermore,\n  Yet whom existence in its lowest form\n  Includes.\"[B]",
        "[Footnote B: Paracelsus.]",
        "The scheme of love does not begin with man, he is rather its\nconsummation.",
        "  “Whose attributes had here and there\n  Been scattered o’er the visible world before,\n  Asking to be combined, dim fragments meant\n  To be united in some wondrous whole,\n  Imperfect qualities throughout creation,\n  Suggesting some one creature yet to make,\n  Some point where all those scattered rays should meet\n  Convergent in the faculties of man.",
        "  “Hints and previsions of which faculties,\n  Are strewn confusedly everywhere about\n  The inferior natures, and all lead up higher,\n  All shape out divinely the superior race,\n  The heir of hopes too fair to turn out false,\n  And man appears at last.\"[A]",
        "[Footnote A: Paracelsus.]",
        "Power, knowledge, love, all these are found in the world, in which",
        "            “All tended to mankind,\n  And, man produced, all has its end thus far:\n  But, in completed man begins anew\n  A tendency to God.\"[B]",
        "[Footnote B: Ibid.]",
        "For man, being intelligent, flings back his light on all that went\nbefore,",
        "  “Illustrates all the inferior grades, explains\n  Each back step in the circle.\"[C]",
        "[Footnote C: Ibid. 189.]",
        "He gives voice to the mute significance of Nature, and lets in the light\non its blind groping.",
        "    “Man, once descried, imprints for ever\n  His presence on all lifeless things.”",
        "And how is this interpretation achieved? By penetrating behind force,\npower, mechanism, and even intelligence, thinks the poet, to a purpose\nwhich is benevolent, a reason which is all embracing and rooted in love.\nThe magnificent failure of Paracelsus came from missing this last step.\nHis transcendent hunger for knowledge was not satisfied, not because\nhuman knowledge is essentially an illusion or mind disease, but because\nhis knowledge did not reach the final truth of things, which is love.\nFor love alone makes the heart wise, to know the secret of all being.\nThis is the ultimate hypothesis in the light of which alone man can\ncatch a glimpse of the general direction and intent of the universal\nmovement in the world and man. Dying, Paracelsus, taught by Aprile,\ncaught a glimpse of this elemental “love-force,” in which alone lies the\nclue to every problem, and the promise of the final satisfaction of the\nhuman spirit. Failing in this knowledge, man may know many things, but\nnothing truly; for all such knowledge stays with outward shows. It is\nlove alone that puts man in the right relation to his fellows and to the\nworld, and removes the distortion which fills life with sorrow, and\nmakes it",
        "            “Only a scene\n  Of degradation, ugliness and tears,\n  The record of disgraces best forgotten,\n  A sullen page in human chronicles\n  Fit to erase.\"[A]",
        "[Footnote A: Paracelsus.]",
        "But in the light of love, man “sees a good in evil, and a hope in ill\nsuccess,” and recognizes that mankind are",
        "  “All with a touch of nobleness, despite\n  Their error, upward tending all though weak;\n  Like plants in mines which never saw the sun,\n  But dream of him, and guess where he may be,\n  And do their best to climb and get to him.\"[B]",
        "[Footnote B: Ibid.]",
        "“All this I knew not,” adds Paracelsus, “and I failed. Let men take the\nlesson and press this lamp of love, ’God’s lamp, close to their\nbreasts’; its splendour, soon or late, will pierce the gloom,” and show\nthat the universe is a transparent manifestation of His beneficence.",
