        "On all sides so great sorrow / heard ye there around,\nThat palace and high tower / did from the wail resound.\nOf Bern a man of Dietrich / eke the same did hear,\nAnd speedily he hastened / the tidings to his lord to bear.",
        "2236",
        "Spake he unto his master: / “Sir Dietrich give me ear.\nWhat yet hath been my fortune, / never did I hear\nLamenting past all measure, / as at this hour hath been.\nScathe unto King Etzel / himself hath happened, I ween.",
        "2237",
        "“Else how might they ever / all show such dire need?\nThe king himself or Kriemhild, / one of them lieth dead,\nBy the doughty strangers / for sake of vengeance slain.\nUnmeasured is the weeping / of full many a stately thane.”",
        "2238",
        "Then spake of Bern Sir Dietrich: / “Ye men to me full dear,\nNow haste ye not unduly. / The deeds performed here\nBy the stranger warriors / show sore necessity.\nThat peace with them I blighted, / let it now their profit be.”",
        "2239",
        "Then spake the valiant Wolfhart: / “Thither will I run\nTo make question of it / what they now have done,\nAnd straight will tidings bring thee, / master full dear to me,\nWhen yonder I inform me, / whence may so great lamenting be.”",
        "2240",
        "Answer gave Sir Dietrich: / “Fear they hostility,\nThe while uncivil questioning / of their deed there be,\nLightly are stirred to anger / good warriors o’er the thing.\nYea, ’tis my pleasure, Wolfhart, / thou sparest them all such\n      questioning.",
        "2241",
        "Helfrich he then commanded / thither with speed to go\nThat from men of Etzel / he might truly know,\nOr from the strangers straightway, / what thing there had been.\nAs that, so sore lamenting / of people ne’er before was seen.",
        "2242",
        "Questioned then the messenger: / “What hath here been wrought?\"\nAnswered one among them: / “Complete is come to naught\nWhat of joy we cherished / here in Hunnish land.\nSlain here lieth Ruediger, / fallen ’neath Burgundian hand.",
        "2243",
        "“Of them that entered with him / not one doth longer live.\"\nNaught might ever happen / Helfrich more to grieve,\nNor ever told he tidings / so ruefully before.\nWeeping sore the message / unto Dietrich then he bore.",
        "2244",
        "“What the news thou bringst us?\" / Dietrich spake once more;\n“Yet, O doughty Helfrich, / wherefore dost weep so sore?\"\nAnswered the noble warrior: / “With right may I complain:\nYonder faithful Ruediger / lieth by the Burgundians slain.”",
        "2245",
        "The lord of Bern gave answer: / “God let not such thing be!\nThat were a mighty vengeance, / and eke the Devil’s glee.\nWhereby had ever Ruediger / from them deserved such ill?\nWell know I to the strangers / was ever well disposed his will.”",
        "2246",
        "Thereto gave answer Wolfhart: / “In sooth have they this done,\nTherefor their lives shall forfeit / surely, every one.\nAnd make we not requital, / our shame for aye it were;\nFull manifold our service / from hand of noble Ruediger.”",
        "2247",
        "Then bade the lord of Amelungen / the case more full to learn.\nHe sat within a casement / and did full sadly mourn.\nHe prayed then that Hildebrand / unto the strangers go,\nThat he from their own telling / of the case complete might know.",
        "2248",
        "The warrior keen in battle, / Master Hildebrand,\nNeither shield nor weapon / bore he in his hand,\nBut would in chivalrous manner / unto the strangers go.\nHis sister’s son reviled him / that he would venture thus to do.",
        "2249",
        "Spake in anger Wolfhart: / “Goest thou all weaponless,\nMust I of such action / free my thought confess:\nThou shalt in shameful fashion / hither come again;\nGoest thou armed thither, / will all from harm to thee refrain.”",
        "2250",
        "So armed himself the old man / at counsel of the young.\nEre he was ware of it, / into their armor sprung\nAll of Dietrich’s warriors / and stood with sword in hand.\nGrieved he was, and gladly / had turned them Master Hildebrand.",
        "2251",
        "He asked them whither would they. / “Thee company we’ll bear,\nSo may, perchance, less willing / Hagen of Tronje dare,\nAs so oft his custom, / to give thee mocking word.\"\nThe thane his leave did grant them / at last when he their speech had\n      heard.",
        "2252",
        "Keen Volker saw approaching, / in armor all arrayed,\nOf Bern the gallant warriors / that Dietrich’s word obeyed,\nWith sword at girdle hanging / and bearing shield in hand.\nStraight he told the tidings / to his masters of Burgundian land.",
        "2253",
        "Spake the doughty Fiddler: / “Yonder see I come near\nThe warriors of Dietrich / all clad in battle gear\nAnd decked their heads with helmets, / as if our harm they mean.\nFor us knights here homeless / approacheth evil end, I ween.”",
        "2254",
        "Meanwhile was come anigh them / Master Hildebrand.\nBefore his foot he rested / the shield he bore in hand,\nAnd soon began to question / the men of Gunther there:\n“Alack, ye gallant warriors, / what harm hath wrought you Ruediger?",
        "2255",
        "“Me did my master Dietrich / hither to you command:\nIf now the noble margrave / hath fallen ’neath the hand\nOf any knight among you, / as word to us is borne,\nSuch a mighty sorrow / might we never cease to mourn.”",
        "2256",
        "Then spake of Tronje Hagen: / “True is the tale ye hear.\nThough glad I were, if to you / had lied the messenger,\nAnd if the faithful Ruediger / still his life might keep,\nFor whom both man and woman / must ever now in sorrow weep!”",
        "2257",
        "When they for sooth the passing / of the hero knew,\nThose gallant knights bemoaned him / like faithful friends and true;\nOn Dietrich’s lusty warriors / saw ye fall the tear\nAdown the bearded visage, / for sad of heart in truth they were.",
        "2258",
        "Of Bern then a chieftain, / Siegstab, further cried:\n“Of all the mickle comfort / now an end is made,\nThat Ruediger erst prepared us / after our days of pain.\nThe joy of exiled people / here lieth by you warriors slain.”",
        "2259",
        "Then spake of Amelungen / the thane Wolfwein:\n“If that this day beheld I / dead e’en sire of mine,\nNo more might be my sorrow / than for this hero’s life.\nAlack! who bringeth comfort / now to the noble margrave’s wife?”",
        "2260",
        "Spake eke in angry humor / Wolfhart a stalwart thane:\n“Who now shall lead our army / on the far campaign,\nAs full oft the margrave / of old hath led our host?\nAlack! O noble Ruediger, / that in such manner thee we’ve lost!”",
        "2261",
        "Wolfbrand and Helfrich / and Helmnot with warriors all\nMourned there together / that he in death must fall.\nFor sobbing might not further / question Hildebrand.\nHe spake: “Now do, ye warriors, / according to my lord’s command.",
        "2262",
        "“Yield unto us Ruediger’s / corse from out the hall,\nIn whose death to sorrow / hath passed our pleasure all;\nAnd let us do him service / for friendship true of yore\nThat e’er for us he cherished / and eke for many a stranger more.",
        "2263",
        "“We too from home are exiles / like unto Ruediger.\nWhy keep ye us here waiting? / Him grant us hence to bear,\nThat e’en though death hath reft him / our service he receive,\nThough fairer had we paid it / the while the hero yet did live.”",
        "2264",
        "Thereto spake King Gunther: / “No service equal may\nThat which, when death hath reft him, / to friend a friend doth pay.\nHim deem I friend right faithful, / whoe’er the same may do.\nWell make ye here requital / for many a service unto you.”",
        "2265",
        "“How long shall we beseech you,\" / spake Wolfhart the thane;\n“Since he that best consoled us / by you now lieth slain,\nAnd we, alas, no longer / his living aid may have,\nGrant us hence to bear him / and lay the hero in his grave.”",
        "2266",
        "Thereto answered Volker: / “Thy prayer shall all deny.\nFrom out the hall thou take him, / where doth the hero lie\n’Neath deep wounds and mortal / in blood now smitten down.\nSo may by thee best service / here to Ruediger be shown.”",
        "2267",
        "Answered Wolfhart boldly: / “Sir Fiddleman, God wot\nThou shalt forbear to stir us, / for woe on us thou’st wrought.\nDurst I despite my master, / uncertain were thy life;\nYet must we here keep silence, / for he did bid us shun the strife.”",
        "2268",
        "Then spake again the Fiddler: / “’Tis all too much of fear,\nFor that a thing’s forbidden, / meekly to forbear.\nScarce may I deem it valor / worthy good knight to tell.\"\nWhat said his faithful comrade, / did please the doughty Hagen well.",
        "2269",
        "“For proof be not o’er-eager,\" / Wolfhart quick replied,\n“Else so I’ll tune thy fiddle / that when again ye ride\nAfar unto Rhine river, / sad tale thou tellest there.\nThy haughty words no longer / may I now with honor bear.”",
        "2270",
        "Spake once more the Fiddler: / “If e’er the harmony\nOf my fiddle-strings thou breakest, / thy helmet’s sheen shall be\nMade full dim of lustre / by stroke of this my hand,\nHowe’er fall out my journey / homeward to Burgundian land.”",
        "2271",
        "Then would he rush upon him / but that him did restrain\nHildebrand his uncle / who seized him amain.\n“I ween thou would’st be witless, / by youthful rage misled.\nMy master’s favor had’st thou / evermore thus forfeited.”",
        "2272",
        "“Let loose the lion, Master, / that doth rage so sore.\nIf but my sword may reach him,\" / spake Volker further more,\n“Though he the world entire / by his own might had slain,\nI’ll smite him that an answer / never may he chant again.”",
        "2273",
        "Thereat with anger straightway / the men of Bern were filled.\nWolfhart, thane right valiant, / grasped in haste his shield,\nAnd like to a wild lion / out before them sped.\nBy friends a goodly number / full quickly was he followed.",
        "2274",
        "Though by the hall went striding / ne’er so swift the thane,\nO’ertook him Master Hildebrand / ere he the steps might gain,\nFor nowise would he let him / be foremost in the fray.\nIn the stranger warriors / worthy foemen soon found they.",
        "2275",
        "Straight saw ye upon Hagen / rush Master Hildebrand,\nAnd sword ye heard give music / in each foeman’s hand.\nSore they were enraged, / as ye soon were ware,\nFor from their swinging broadswords / whirred the ruddy sparks in air.",
        "2276",
        "Yet soon the twain were parted / in the raging fight:\nThe men of Bern so turned it / by their dauntless might.\nEre long then was Hildebrand / from Hagen turned away,\nWhile that the doughty Wolfhart / the valiant Volker sought to slay.",
        "2277",
        "Upon the helm the Fiddler / he smote with blow so fierce\nThat the sword’s keen edges / unto the frame did pierce.\nWith mighty stroke repaid him / the valiant minstrel too,\nAnd so belabored Wolfhart / that thick the sparks around him flew.",
        "2278",
        "Hewing they made the fire / from mail-rings scintillate,\nFor each unto the other / bore a deadly hate.\nOf Bern the thane Wolfwein / at length did part the two,–\nWhich thing might none other / than man of mickle prowess do.",
        "2279",
        "Gunther, knight full gallant, / received with ready hand\nThere the stately warriors / of Amelungen land.\nEke did young Giselher / of many a helmet bright,\nWith blood all red and reeking, / cause to grow full dim the light.",
        "2280",
        "Dankwart, Hagen’s brother, / was a warrior grim.\nWhat erstwhile in combat / had been wrought by him\nAgainst the men of Etzel / seemed now as toying vain,\nAs fought with flaming ire / the son of valiant Aldrian.",
        "2281",
        "Ritschart and Gerbart, / Helfrich and Wichart\nHad oft in storm of battle / with valor borne their part,\nAs now ’fore men of Gunther / they did clear display.\nLikewise saw ye Wolfbrand / glorious amid the fray.",
        "2282",
        "There old Master Hildebrand / fought as he were wode.\nMany a doughty warrior / was stricken in the blood\nBy the sword that swinging / in Wolfhart’s hand was seen.\nThus took dire vengeance / for Ruediger those knights full keen.",
        "2283",
        "Havoc wrought Sir Siegstab / there with might and main.\nHo! in the hurly-burly / what helms he cleft in twain\nUpon the crowns of foemen, / Dietrich’s sister’s son!\nNe’er in storm of battle / had he more feats of valor done.",
        "2284",
        "When the doughty Volker / there aright had seen\nHow many a bloody rivulet / was hewn by Siegstab keen\nFrom out the well-wrought mail-rings, / the hero’s ire arose.\nQuick he sprang toward him, / Siegstab then his life must lose.",
        "2285",
        "Ere long time was over, / ’neath the Fiddler’s hand,\nWho of his art did give him / such share to understand\nThat beneath his broadsword / smitten to death he lay.\nOld Hildebrand avenged him / as bade his mighty arm alway.",
        "2286",
        "“Alack that knight so loved,\" / spake Master Hildebrand,\n“Here should thus lie fallen / ’neath Volker’s hand.\nNow lived his latest hour / in sooth this Fiddler hath.\"\nFilled was the hero Hildebrand / straightway with a mighty wrath.",
        "2287",
        "With might smote he Volker / that severed flew the band\nE’en to the hall’s wide limit / far on either hand\nFrom shield and eke from helmet / borne by the Fiddler keen;\nTherewith the doughty Volker / reft of life at last had been.",
        "2288",
        "Pressed eager to the combat / Dietrich’s warriors true,\nSmiting that the mail-rings / afar from harness flew,\nAnd that the broken sword-points / soaring aloft ye saw,\nThe while that reeking blood-stains / did they from riven helmets draw.",
        "2289",
        "There of Tronje Hagen / beheld Volker dead.\nIn that so bloody carnage / ’twas far the sorest need\nOf all that did befall him / in death of friend and man.\nAlack! for him what vengeance / Hagen then to wreak began!",
        "2290",
        "“Therefrom shall profit never / Master Hildebrand.\nSlain hath been here my helper / ’neath the warrior’s hand,\nThe best of feres in battle / that fortune ever sent.\"\nHis shield upraised he higher / and hewing through the throng he went.",
        "2291",
        "Next saw ye Dankwart / by doughty Helfrich slain,\nGunther and Giselher / did full sorely plain,\nWhen they beheld him fallen / where fiercely raged the fray.\nFor his death beforehand / dearly did his foemen pay.",
        "2292",
        "The while coursed Wolfhart / thither and back again,\nThrough Gunther’s men before him / hewing wide a lane.\nThrice in sooth returning / strode he down the hall,\nAnd many a lusty warrior / ’neath his doughty hand must fall.",
        "2293",
        "Soon the young Sir Giselher / cried aloud to him:\n“Alack, that I should ever / find such foeman grim!\nSir knight, so bold and noble, / now turn thee here to me.\nI trow to end thy coursing, / the which will I no longer see.”",
        "2294",
        "To Giselher then turned him / Wolfhart in the fight,\nAnd gaping wounds full many / did each the other smite.\nWith such a mighty fury / he to the monarch sped\nThat ’neath his feet went flying / the blood e’en high above his head.",
        "2295",
        "With rapid blows and furious / the son of Ute fair\nReceived the valiant Wolfhart / as came he to him there.\nHow strong soe’er the thane was, / his life must ended be.\nNever king so youthful / might bear himself more valiantly.",
        "2296",
        "Straight he smote Wolfhart / through well-made cuirass,\nThat from the wound all gaping / the flowing blood did pass.\nUnto death he wounded / Dietrich’s liegeman true,\nWhich thing in sooth might never / any save knight full gallant do.",
        "2297",
        "When the valiant Wolfhart / of the wound was ware,\nHis shield flung he from him / and high with hand in air\nRaised he a mighty weapon / whose keen edge failed not.\nThrough helmet and through mail-rings / Giselher with might he smote.",
        "2298",
        "Grimly each the other / there to death had done.\nOf Dietrich’s men no longer / lived there ever one.\nWhen old Master Hildebrand / Wolfhart’s fall had seen,\nIn all his life there never / such sorrow him befell, I ween.",
        "2299",
        "Fallen now were Gunther’s / warriors every one,\nAnd eke the men of Dietrich. / Hildebrand the while had gone\nWhere Wolfhart had fallen / down in pool of blood.\nIn his arms then clasped he / the warrior of dauntless mood.",
        "2300",
        "Forth from the hall to bear him / vainly did he try:\nBut all too great the burden / and there he still must lie.\nThe dying knight looked upward / from his bloody bed\nAnd saw how that full gladly / him his uncle thence had led.",
        "2301",
        "Spake he thus mortal wounded: / “Uncle full dear to me,\nNow mayst thou at such season / no longer helpful be.\nTo guard thee well from Hagen / indeed me seemeth good,\nFor bears he in his bosom / a heart in sooth of grimmest mood.",
        "2302",
        "“And if for me my kinsmen / at my death would mourn,\nUnto the best and nearest / by thee be message borne\nThat for me they weep not, / –of that no whit is need.\nAt hand of valiant monarch / here lie I gloriously dead.",
        "2303",
        "“Eke my life so dearly / within this hall I’ve sold,\nThat have sore cause for weeping / the wives of warriors bold.\nIf any make thee question, / then mayst thou freely say\nThat my own hand nigh hundred / warriors hath slain to-day.”",
        "2304",
        "Now was Hagen mindful / of the minstrel slain,\nFrom whom the valiant Hildebrand / erstwhile his life had ta’en.\nUnto the Master spake he: / “My woes shalt thou repay.\nFull many a warrior gallant / thou hast ta’en from us hence away.”",
        "2305",
        "He smote upon Hildebrand / that loud was heard the tone\nOf Balmung resounding / that erst did Siegfried own,\nBut Hagen bold did seize it / when he the hero slew.\nThe old warrior did guard him, / as he was knight of mettle true.",
        "2306",
        "Dietrich’s doughty liegeman / with broadsword did smite\nThat did cut full sorely, / upon Tronje’s knight;\nYet had the man of Gunther / never any harm.\nThrough his cuirass well-jointed / Hagen smote with mighty arm.",
        "2307",
        "Soon as his wound perceived / the aged Hildebrand,\nFeared he more of damage / to take from Hagen’s hand;\nAcross his back full deftly / his shield swung Dietrich’s man,\nAnd wounded deep, the hero / in flight ’fore Hagen’s fury ran.",
        "2308",
        "Now longer lived not any / of all that goodly train\nSave Gunther and Hagen, / doughty warriors twain.\nWith blood from wound down streaming / fled Master Hildebrand,\nWhom soon in Dietrich’s presence, / saw ye with saddest tidings stand.",
        "2309",
        "He found the chieftain sitting / with sorrow all distraught,\nYet mickle more of sadness / unto him he brought.\nWhen Dietrich saw how Hildebrand / cuirass all blood-red wore,\nWith fearful heart he questioned, / what the news to him he bore.",
        "2310",
        "“Now tell me, Master Hildebrand, / how thus wet thou be\nFrom thy life-blood flowing, / or who so harmeth thee.\nIn hall against the strangers / thou’st drawn thy sword, I ween.\n’Twere well my straight denial / here by these had honored been.”",
        "2311",
        "Replied he to his master: / “From Hagen cometh all.\nThis deep wound he smote me / there within the hall\nWhen I from his fury / thought to turn away.\n’Tis marvel that I living / saved me from the fiend this day.”",
        "2312",
        "Then of Bern spake Dietrich: / “Aright hast thou thy share,\nFor thou didst hear me friendship / unto these knights declare,\nAnd now the peace hast broken, / that I to them did give.\nIf my disgrace it were not, / by this hand no longer shouldst thou live.”",
        "2313",
        "“Now be not, Master Dietrich, / so sorely stirred to wrath.\nOn me and on my kinsmen / is wrought too great a scathe.\nThence sought we Ruediger / to bear all peacefully,\nThe which by men of Gunther / to us no whit would granted be.”",
        "2314",
        "“Ah, woe is me for sorrow! / Is Ruediger then dead,\nIn all my need there never / such grief hath happened.\nThe noble Gotelinde / is cousin fair to me.\nAlack for the poor orphans / that there in Bechelaren must be!”",
        "2315",
        "Grief and anguish filled him / o’er Ruediger thus slain,\nNor might at all the hero / the flowing tears restrain.\n“Alack for faithful helper / that death from me hath torn.\nKing Etzel’s trusty liegeman / never may I cease to mourn.",
        "2316",
        "“Canst thou, Master Hildebrand, / true the tidings say,\nWho might be the warrior / that Ruediger did slay?\"\n“That did the doughty Gernot / with mighty arm,” he said:\n“Eke at hand of Ruediger / lieth the royal hero dead.”",
        "2317",
        "Spake he again to Hildebrand: / “Now let my warriors know,\nThat straightway they shall arm them, / for thither will I go.\nAnd bid to fetch hither / my shining mail to me.\nMyself those knights will question / of the land of Burgundy.”",
        "2318",
        "“Who here shall do thee service?\" / spake Master Hildebrand;\n“All that thou hast yet living, / thou seest before thee stand.\nOf all remain I only; / the others, they are dead.\"\nAs was in sooth good reason, / filled the tale his soul with dread,",
        "2319",
        "For in his life did never / such woe to him befall.\nHe spake: “Hath death so reft me / of my warriors all,\nGod hath forsaken Dietrich, / ah me, a wretched wight!\nSometime a lofty monarch / I was, high throned in wealth and might.”",
        "2320",
        "“How might it ever happen?\" / Dietrich spake again,\n“That so worthy heroes / here should all be slain\nBy the battle-weary / strangers thus beset?\nIll fortune me hath chosen, / else death had surely spared them yet.",
        "2321",
        "“Since that fate not further / to me would respite give,\nThen tell me, of the strangers / doth any longer live?\"\nAnswered Master Hildebrand: / “God wot, never one\nSave Hagen, and beside him / Gunther lofty king alone.”",
        "2322",
        "“Alack, O faithful Wolfhart, / must I thy death now mourn,\nSoon have I cause to rue me / that ever I was born.\nSiegstab and Wolfwein / and eke Wolfbrand!\nWho now shall be my helpers / in the Amelungen land?",
        "2323",
        "“Helfrich, thane full valiant, / and is he likewise slain?\nFor Gerbart and Wichart / when shall I cease to plain?\nOf all my life’s rejoicing / is this the latest day.\nAlack that die for sorrow / never yet a mortal may!”",
