        "The arrival of a second fighting-machine drove us from\nour peephole into the scullery, for we feared that from his\nelevation the Martian might see down upon us behind our\nbarrier.  At a later date we began to feel less in danger of\ntheir eyes, for to an eye in the dazzle of the sunlight outside\nour refuge must have been blank blackness, but at first the\nslightest suggestion of approach drove us into the scullery\nin heart-throbbing retreat.  Yet terrible as was the danger we\nincurred, the attraction of peeping was for both of us irresist-\nible.  And I recall now with a sort of wonder that, in spite\nof the infinite danger in which we were between starvation\nand a still more terrible death, we could yet struggle bitterly\nfor that horrible privilege of sight.  We would race across the\nkitchen in a grotesque way between eagerness and the dread\nof making a noise, and strike each other, and thrust add kick,\nwithin a few inches of exposure.",
        "The fact is that we had absolutely incompatible dispositions\nand habits of thought and action, and our danger and isolation\nonly accentuated the incompatibility.  At Halliford I had al-\nready come to hate the curateâ€™s trick of helpless exclamation,\nhis stupid rigidity of mind.  His endless muttering monologue\nvitiated every effort I made to think out a line of action, and\ndrove me at times, thus pent up and intensified, almost to the\nverge of craziness.  He was as lacking in restraint as a silly\nwoman.  He would weep for hours together, and I verily\nbelieve that to the very end this spoiled child of life thought\nhis weak tears in some way efficacious.  And I would sit in\nthe darkness unable to keep my mind off him by reason of\nhis importunities.  He ate more than I did, and it was in vain\nI pointed out that our only chance of life was to stop in the\nhouse until the Martians had done with their pit, that in that\nlong patience a time might presently come when we should\nneed food.  He ate and drank impulsively in heavy meals at\nlong intervals.  He slept little.",
        "As the days wore on, his utter carelessness of any considera-\ntion so intensified our distress and danger that I had, much as\nI loathed doing it, to resort to threats, and at last to blows.\nThat brought him to reason for a time.  But he was one of\nthose weak creatures, void of pride, timorous, anaemic, hateful\nsouls, full of shifty cunning, who face neither God nor man,\nwho face not even themselves.",
        " It is disagreeable for me to recall and write these things,\nbut I set them down that my story may lack nothing.  Those\nwho have escaped the dark and terrible aspects of life will\nfind my brutality, my flash of rage in our final tragedy, easy\nenough to blame; for they know what is wrong as well as\nany, but not what is possible to tortured men.  But those who\nhave been under the shadow, who have gone down at last to\nelemental things, will have a wider charity.",
        "And while within we fought out our dark, dim contest of\nwhispers, snatched food and drink, and gripping hands and\nblows, without, in the pitiless sunlight of that terrible June,\nwas the strange wonder, the unfamiliar routine of the\nMartians in the pit.  Let me return to those first new experi-\nences of mine.  After a long time I ventured back to the\npeephole, to find that the new-comers had been reinforced\nby the occupants of no fewer than three of the fighting-\nmachines.  These last had brought with them certain fresh\nappliances that stood in an orderly manner about the cylinder.\nThe second handling-machine was now completed, and was\nbusied in serving one of the novel contrivances the big\nmachine had brought.  This was a body resembling a milk can\nin its general form, above which oscillated a pear-shaped\nreceptacle, and from which a stream of white powder flowed\ninto a circular basin below.",
        "The oscillatory motion was imparted to this by one tentacle\nof the handling-machine.  With two spatulate hands the\nhandling-machine was digging out and flinging masses of clay\ninto the pear-shaped receptacle above, while with another arm\nit periodically opened a door and removed rusty and black-\nened clinkers from the middle part of the machine.  Another\nsteely tentacle directed the powder from the basin along a\nribbed channel towards some receiver that was hidden from\nme by the mound of bluish dust.  From this unseen receiver a\nlittle thread of green smoke rose vertically into the quiet air.\nAs I looked, the handling-machine, with a faint and musical\nclinking, extended, telescopic fashion, a tentacle that had\nbeen a moment before a mere blunt projection, until its end\nwas hidden behind the mound of clay.  In another second it\nhad lifted a bar of white aluminium into sight, untarnished as\nyet, and shining dazzlingly, and deposited it in a growing stack\nof bars that stood at the side of the pit.  Between sunset and\nstarlight this dexterous machine must have made more than\na hundred such bars out of the crude clay, and the mound\nof bluish dust rose steadily until it topped the side of the\npit.",
        "The contrast between the swift and complex movements\nof these contrivances and the inert panting clumsiness of\ntheir masters was acute, and for days I had to tell myself\nrepeatedly that these latter were indeed the living of the two\nthings.",
        "The curate had possession of the slit when the first men\nwere brought to the pit.  I was sitting below, huddled up,\nlistening with all my ears.  He made a sudden movement\nbackward, and I, fearful that we were observed, crouched\nin a spasm of terror.  He came sliding down the rubbish and\ncrept beside me in the darkness, inarticulate, gesticulating,\nand for a moment I shared his panic.  His gesture suggested\na resignation of the slit, and after a little while my curiosity\ngave me courage, and I rose up, stepped across him, and\nclambered up to it.  At first I could see no reason for his\nfrantic behaviour.  The twilight had now come, the stars were\nlittle and faint, but the pit was illuminated by the flickering\ngreen fire that came from the aluminium-making.  The whole\npicture was a flickering scheme of green gleams and shifting\nrusty black shadows, strangely trying to the eyes.  Over and\nthrough it all went the bats, heeding it not at all.  The\nsprawling Martians were no longer to be seen, the mound\nof blue-green powder had risen to cover them from sight,\nand a fighting-machine, with its legs contracted, crumpled,\nand abbreviated, stood across the corner of the pit.  And\nthen, amid the clangour of the machinery, came a drifting\nsuspicion of human voices, that I entertained at first only\nto dismiss.",
        "I crouched, watching this fighting-machine closely, satisfy-\ning myself now for the first time that the hood did indeed\ncontain a Martian.  As the green flames lifted I could see the\noily gleam of his integument and the brightness of his eyes.\nAnd suddenly I heard a yell, and saw a long tentacle reach-\ning over the shoulder of the machine to the little cage that\nhunched upon its back.  Then something--something strug-\ngling violently--was lifted high against the sky, a black,\nvague enigma against the starlight; and as this black object\ncame down again, I saw by the green brightness that it was\na man.  For an instant he was clearly visible.  He was a stout,\nruddy, middle-aged man, well dressed; three days before,\nhe must have been walking the world, a man of considerable\nconsequence.  I could see his staring eyes and gleams of light\non his studs and watch chain.  He vanished behind the\nmound, and for a moment there was silence.  And then began\na shrieking and a sustained and cheerful hooting from the\nMartians.",
        "I slid down the rubbish, struggled to my feet, clapped\nmy hands over my ears, and bolted into the scullery.  The\ncurate, who had been crouching silently with his arms\nover his head, looked up as I passed, cried out quite loudly\nat my desertion of him, and came running after me.",
        "That night, as we lurked in the scullery, balanced between\nour horror and the terrible fascination this peeping had, al-\nthough I felt an urgent need of action I tried in vain to\nconceive some plan of escape; but afterwards, during the\nsecond day, I was able to consider our position with great\nclearness.  The curate, I found, was quite incapable of dis-\ncussion; this new and culminating atrocity had robbed him\nof all vestiges of reason or forethought.  Practically he had\nalready sunk to the level of an animal.  But as the saying\ngoes, I gripped myself with both hands.  It grew upon my\nmind, once I could face the facts, that terrible as our posi-\ntion was, there was as yet no justification for absolute despair.\nOur chief chance lay in the possibility of the Martians making\nthe pit nothing more than a temporary encampment.  Or\neven if they kept it permanently, they might not consider\nit necessary to guard it, and a chance of escape might be\nafforded us.  I also weighed very carefully the possibility of\nour digging a way out in a direction away from the pit,\nbut the chances of our emerging within sight of some\nsentinel fighting-machine seemed at first too great.  And I\nshould have had to do all the digging myself.  The curate\nwould certainly have failed me.",
        "It was on the third day, if my memory serves me right,\nthat I saw the lad killed.  It was the only occasion on which\nI actually saw the Martians feed.  After that experience I\navoided the hole in the wall for the better part of a day.\nI went into the scullery, removed the door, and spent some\nhours digging with my hatchet as silently as possible; but\nwhen I had made a hole about a couple of feet deep the\nloose earth collapsed noisily, and I did not dare continue.  I\nlost heart, and lay down on the scullery floor for a long time,\nhaving no spirit even to move.  And after that I abandoned\naltogether the idea of escaping by excavation.",
        "It says much for the impression the Martians had made\nupon me that at first I entertained little or no hope of our\nescape being brought about by their overthrow through any\nhuman effort.  But on the fourth or fifth night I heard a\nsound like heavy guns.",
        "It was very late in the night, and the moon was shining\nbrightly.  The Martians had taken away the excavating-\nmachine, and, save for a fighting-machine that stood in\nthe remoter bank of the pit and a handling-machine that\nwas buried out of my sight in a corner of the pit immedi-\nately beneath my peephole, the place was deserted by them.\nExcept for the pale glow from the handling-machine and the\nbars and patches of white moonlight the pit was in dark-\nness, and, except for the clinking of the handling-machine,\nquite still.  That night was a beautiful serenity; save for one\nplanet, the moon seemed to have the sky to herself.  I heard\na dog howling, and that familiar sound it was that made\nme listen.  Then I heard quite distinctly a booming ex-\nactly like the sound of great guns.  Six distinct reports I\ncounted, and after a long interval six again.  And that was\nall.",
