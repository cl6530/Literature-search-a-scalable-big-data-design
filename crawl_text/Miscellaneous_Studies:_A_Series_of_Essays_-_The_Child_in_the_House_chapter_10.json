        "[172] As Florian Deleal walked, one hot afternoon, he overtook by the\nwayside a poor aged man, and, as he seemed weary with the road,\nhelped him on with the burden which he carried, a certain distance.\nAnd as the man told his story, it chanced that he named the place, a\nlittle place in the neighbourhood of a great city, where Florian had\npassed his earliest years, but which he had never since seen, and,\nthe story told, went forward on his journey comforted.  And that\nnight, like a reward for his pity, a dream of that place came to\nFlorian, a dream which did for him the office of the finer sort of\nmemory, bringing its object to mind with a great clearness, yet, as\nsometimes happens in dreams, raised a little above itself, and above\nordinary retrospect.  The true aspect of the place, especially of the\nhouse there in which he had lived as a child, the fashion of its\ndoors, its hearths, its windows, the very scent upon the air of it,\nwas with him in sleep for a season; only, with tints more musically\nblent on wall [173] and floor, and some finer light and shadow\nrunning in and out along its curves and angles, and with all its\nlittle carvings daintier.  He awoke with a sigh at the thought of\nalmost thirty years which lay between him and that place, yet with a\nflutter of pleasure still within him at the fair light, as if it\nwere a smile, upon it.  And it happened that this accident of his\ndream was just the thing needed for the beginning of a certain design\nhe then had in view, the noting, namely, of some things in the story\nof his spirit–in that process of brain-building by which we are,\neach one of us, what we are.  With the image of the place so clear\nand favourable upon him, he fell to thinking of himself therein, and\nhow his thoughts had grown up to him.  In that half-spiritualised\nhouse he could watch the better, over again, the gradual expansion of\nthe soul which had come to be there–of which indeed, through the law\nwhich makes the material objects about them so large an element in\nchildren’s lives, it had actually become a part; inward and outward\nbeing woven through and through each other into one inextricable\ntexture–half, tint and trace and accident of homely colour and form,\nfrom the wood and the bricks; half, mere soul-stuff, floated thither\nfrom who knows how far.  In the house and garden of his dream he saw\na child moving, and could divide the main streams at least of\nthe winds that had played on [174] him, and study so the first stage\nin that mental journey.",
        "The old house, as when Florian talked of it afterwards he always\ncalled it, (as all children do, who can recollect a change of home,\nsoon enough but not too soon to mark a period in their lives) really\nwas an old house; and an element of French descent in its inmates–\ndescent from Watteau, the old court-painter, one of whose gallant\npieces still hung in one of the rooms–might explain, together with\nsome other things, a noticeable trimness and comely whiteness about\neverything there–the curtains, the couches, the paint on the walls\nwith which the light and shadow played so delicately; might explain\nalso the tolerance of the great poplar in the garden, a tree most\noften despised by English people, but which French people love,\nhaving observed a certain fresh way its leaves have of dealing with\nthe wind, making it sound, in never so slight a stirring of the air,\nlike running water.",
        "The old-fashioned, low wainscoting went round the rooms, and up the\nstaircase with carved balusters and shadowy angles, landing half-way\nup at a broad window, with a swallow’s nest below the sill, and the\nblossom of an old pear-tree showing across it in late April, against\nthe blue, below which the perfumed juice of the find of fallen fruit\nin autumn was so fresh.  At the next turning came the closet which\nheld on its deep shelves the best china.  Little angel [175] faces\nand reedy flutings stood out round the fireplace of the children’s\nroom.  And on the top of the house, above the large attic, where the\nwhite mice ran in the twilight–an infinite, unexplored wonderland of\nchildish treasures, glass beads, empty scent-bottles still sweet,\nthrum of coloured silks, among its lumber–a flat space of roof,\nrailed round, gave a view of the neighbouring steeples; for the\nhouse, as I said, stood near a great city, which sent up heavenwards,\nover the twisting weather-vanes, not seldom, its beds of rolling\ncloud and smoke, touched with storm or sunshine.  But the child of\nwhom I am writing did not hate the fog because of the crimson lights\nwhich fell from it sometimes upon the chimneys, and the whites which\ngleamed through its openings, on summer mornings, on turret or\npavement.  For it is false to suppose that a child’s sense of beauty\nis dependent on any choiceness or special fineness, in the objects\nwhich present themselves to it, though this indeed comes to be the\nrule with most of us in later life; earlier, in some degree, we see\ninwardly; and the child finds for itself, and with unstinted delight,\na difference for the sense, in those whites and reds through the\nsmoke on very homely buildings, and in the gold of the dandelions at\nthe road-side, just beyond the houses, where not a handful of earth\nis virgin and untouched, in the lack of better ministries to its\ndesire of beauty.",
        "[176] This house then stood not far beyond the gloom and rumours of\nthe town, among high garden-wall, bright all summer-time with Golden-\nrod, and brown-and-golden Wall-flower–Flos Parietis, as the\nchildren’s Latin-reading father taught them to call it, while he was\nwith them.  Tracing back the threads of his complex spiritual habit,\nas he was used in after years to do, Florian found that he owed to\nthe place many tones of sentiment afterwards customary with him,\ncertain inward lights under which things most naturally presented\nthemselves to him.  The coming and going of travellers to the town\nalong the way, the shadow of the streets, the sudden breath of the\nneighbouring gardens, the singular brightness of bright weather\nthere, its singular darknesses which linked themselves in his mind to\ncertain engraved illustrations in the old big Bible at home, the\ncoolness of the dark, cavernous shops round the great church, with\nits giddy winding stair up to the pigeons and the bells–a citadel of\npeace in the heart of the trouble–all this acted on his childish\nfancy, so that ever afterwards the like aspects and incidents never\nfailed to throw him into a well-recognised imaginative mood, seeming\nactually to have become a part of the texture of his mind.  Also,\nFlorian could trace home to this point a pervading preference in\nhimself for a kind of comeliness and dignity, an urbanity literally,\nin modes of life, which he connected with the pale [177] people of\ntowns, and which made him susceptible to a kind of exquisite\nsatisfaction in the trimness and well-considered grace of certain\nthings and persons he afterwards met with, here and there, in his way\nthrough the world.",
        "So the child of whom I am writing lived on there quietly; things\nwithout thus ministering to him, as he sat daily at the window with\nthe birdcage hanging below it, and his mother taught him to read,\nwondering at the ease with which he learned, and at the quickness of\nhis memory.  The perfume of the little flowers of the lime-tree fell\nthrough the air upon them like rain; while time seemed to move ever\nmore slowly to the murmur of the bees in it, till it almost stood\nstill on June afternoons.  How insignificant, at the moment, seem the\ninfluences of the sensible things which are tossed and fall and lie\nabout us, so, or so, in the environment of early childhood.  How\nindelibly, as we afterwards discover, they affect us; with what\ncapricious attractions and associations they figure themselves on the\nwhite paper, the smooth wax, of our ingenuous souls, as “with lead in\nthe rock for ever,” giving form and feature, and as it were assigned\nhouse-room in our memory, to early experiences of feeling and\nthought, which abide with us ever afterwards, thus, and not\notherwise.  The realities and passions, the rumours of the greater\nworld without, steal in upon us, each by its own special little\npassage-way, through the wall of custom [178] about us; and never\nafterwards quite detach themselves from this or that accident, or\ntrick, in the mode of their first entrance to us.  Our\nsusceptibilities, the discovery of our powers, manifold experiences–\nour various experiences of the coming and going of bodily pain, for\ninstance–belong to this or the other well-remembered place in the\nmaterial habitation–that little white room with the window across\nwhich the heavy blossoms could beat so peevishly in the wind, with\njust that particular catch or throb, such a sense of teasing in it,\non gusty mornings; and the early habitation thus gradually becomes a\nsort of material shrine or sanctuary of sentiment; a system of\nvisible symbolism interweaves itself through all our thoughts and\npassions; and irresistibly, little shapes, voices, accidents–the\nangle at which the sun in the morning fell on the pillow–become\nparts of the great chain wherewith we are bound.",
        "Thus far, for Florian, what all this had determined was a peculiarly\nstrong sense of home–so forcible a motive with all of us–prompting\nto us our customary love of the earth, and the larger part of our\nfear of death, that revulsion we have from it, as from something\nstrange, untried, unfriendly; though life-long imprisonment, they\ntell you, and final banishment from home is a thing bitterer still;\nthe looking forward to but a short space, a mere childish gouter and\ndessert of it, before the end, being so great a resource of [179]\neffort to pilgrims and wayfarers, and the soldier in distant\nquarters, and lending, in lack of that, some power of solace to the\nthought of sleep in the home churchyard, at least–dead cheek by dead\ncheek, and with the rain soaking in upon one from above.",
        "So powerful is this instinct, and yet accidents like those I have\nbeen speaking of so mechanically determine it; its essence being\nindeed the early familiar, as constituting our ideal, or typical\nconception, of rest and security.  Out of so many possible\nconditions, just this for you and that for me, brings ever the\nunmistakeable realisation of the delightful chez soi; this for the\nEnglishman, for me and you, with the closely-drawn white curtain and\nthe shaded lamp; that, quite other, for the wandering Arab, who folds\nhis tent every morning, and makes his sleeping-place among haunted\nruins, or in old tombs.",
        "With Florian then the sense of home became singularly intense, his\ngood fortune being that the special character of his home was in\nitself so essentially home-like.  As after many wanderings I have\ncome to fancy that some parts of Surrey and Kent are, for Englishmen,\nthe true landscape, true home-counties, by right, partly, of a\ncertain earthy warmth in the yellow of the sand below their gorse-\nbushes, and of a certain grey-blue mist after rain, in the hollows of\nthe hills there, welcome to fatigued eyes, and never seen farther\nsouth; so I think that the sort of [180] house I have described, with\nprecisely those proportions of red-brick and green, and with a just\nperceptible monotony in the subdued order of it, for its\ndistinguishing note, is for Englishmen at least typically home-life.\nAnd so for Florian that general human instinct was reinforced by this\nspecial home-likeness in the place his wandering soul had happened to\nlight on, as, in the second degree, its body and earthly tabernacle;\nthe sense of harmony between his soul and its physical environment\nbecame, for a time at least, like perfectly played music, and the\nlife led there singularly tranquil and filled with a curious sense of\nself-possession.  The love of security, of an habitually undisputed\nstanding-ground or sleeping-place, came to count for much in the\ngeneration and correcting of his thoughts, and afterwards as a\nsalutary principle of restraint in all his wanderings of spirit.  The\nwistful yearning towards home, in absence from it, as the shadows of\nevening deepened, and he followed in thought what was doing there\nfrom hour to hour, interpreted to him much of a yearning and regret\nhe experienced afterwards, towards he knew not what, out of strange\nways of feeling and thought in which, from time to time, his spirit\nfound itself alone; and in the tears shed in such absences there\nseemed always to be some soul-subduing foretaste of what his last\ntears might be.",
        "And the sense of security could hardly have [181] been deeper, the\nquiet of the child’s soul being one with the quiet of its home, a\nplace “inclosed” and “sealed.”  But upon this assured place, upon the\nchild’s assured soul which resembled it, there came floating in from\nthe larger world without, as at windows left ajar unknowingly, or\nover the high garden walls, two streams of impressions, the\nsentiments of beauty and pain–recognitions of the visible, tangible,\naudible loveliness of things, as a very real and somewhat tyrannous\nelement in them–and of the sorrow of the world, of grown people and\nchildren and animals, as a thing not to be put by in them.  From this\npoint he could trace two predominant processes of mental change in\nhim–the growth of an almost diseased sensibility to the spectacle of\nsuffering, and, parallel with this, the rapid growth of a certain\ncapacity of fascination by bright colour and choice form–the sweet\ncurvings, for instance, of the lips of those who seemed to him comely\npersons, modulated in such delicate unison to the things they said or\nsang,–marking early the activity in him of a more than customary\nsensuousness, “the lust of the eye,” as the Preacher says, which\nmight lead him, one day, how far!  Could he have foreseen the\nweariness of the way!  In music sometimes the two sorts of\nimpressions came together, and he would weep, to the surprise of\nolder people.  Tears of joy too the child knew, also to older\npeople’s surprise; real tears, once, of relief from long-strung,\n[182] childish expectation, when he found returned at evening, with\nnew roses in her cheeks, the little sister who had been to a place\nwhere there was a wood, and brought back for him a treasure of fallen\nacorns, and black crow’s feathers, and his peace at finding her again\nnear him mingled all night with some intimate sense of the distant\nforest, the rumour of its breezes, with the glossy blackbirds aslant\nand the branches lifted in them, and of the perfect nicety of the\nlittle cups that fell.  So those two elementary apprehensions of the\ntenderness and of the colour in things grew apace in him, and were\nseen by him afterwards to send their roots back into the beginnings\nof life.",
        "Let me note first some of the occasions of his recognition of the\nelement of pain in things–incidents, now and again, which seemed\nsuddenly to awake in him the whole force of that sentiment which\nGoethe has called the Weltschmerz, and in which the concentrated\nsorrow of the world seemed suddenly to lie heavy upon him.  A book\nlay in an old book-case, of which he cared to remember one picture–a\nwoman sitting, with hands bound behind her, the dress, the cap, the\nhair, folded with a simplicity which touched him strangely, as if not\nby her own hands, but with some ambiguous care at the hands of\nothers–Queen Marie Antoinette, on her way to execution–we all\nremember David’s drawing, meant merely to make her ridiculous.  The\nface [183] that had been so high had learned to be mute and\nresistless; but out of its very resistlessness, seemed now to call on\nmen to have pity, and forbear; and he took note of that, as he closed\nthe book, as a thing to look at again, if he should at any time\nfind himself tempted to be cruel.  Again, he would never quite forget\nthe appeal in the small sister’s face, in the garden under the\nlilacs, terrified at a spider lighted on her sleeve.  He could trace\nback to the look then noted a certain mercy he conceived always for\npeople in fear, even of little things, which seemed to make him,\nthough but for a moment, capable of almost any sacrifice of himself.\nImpressible, susceptible persons, indeed, who had had their sorrows,\nlived about him; and this sensibility was due in part to the tacit\ninfluence of their presence, enforcing upon him habitually the fact\nthat there are those who pass their days, as a matter of course, in a\nsort of “going quietly.”  Most poignantly of all he could recall, in\nunfading minutest circumstance, the cry on the stair, sounding\nbitterly through the house, and struck into his soul for ever, of an\naged woman, his father’s sister, come now to announce his death in\ndistant India; how it seemed to make the aged woman like a child\nagain; and, he knew not why, but this fancy was full of pity to him.\nThere were the little sorrows of the dumb animals too–of the white\nangora, with a dark tail like an ermine’s, and a face like a [184]\nflower, who fell into a lingering sickness, and became quite\ndelicately human in its valetudinarianism, and came to have a hundred\ndifferent expressions of voice–how it grew worse and worse, till it\nbegan to feel the light too much for it, and at last, after one wild\nmorning of pain, the little soul flickered away from the body, quite\nworn to death already, and now but feebly retaining it.",
        "So he wanted another pet; and as there were starlings about the\nplace, which could be taught to speak, one of them was caught, and he\nmeant to treat it kindly; but in the night its young ones could be\nheard crying after it, and the responsive cry of the mother-bird\ntowards them; and at last, with the first light, though not till\nafter some debate with himself, he went down and opened the cage, and\nsaw a sharp bound of the prisoner up to her nestlings; and therewith\ncame the sense of remorse,–that he too was become an accomplice in\nmoving, to the limit of his small power, the springs and handles of\nthat great machine in things, constructed so ingeniously to play\npain-fugues on the delicate nerve-work of living creatures.",
        "I have remarked how, in the process of our brain-building, as the\nhouse of thought in which we live gets itself together, like some\nairy bird’s-nest of floating thistle-down and chance straws, compact\nat last, little accidents have their consequence; and thus it\nhappened that, as he [185] walked one evening, a garden gate, usually\nclosed, stood open; and lo! within, a great red hawthorn in full\nflower, embossing heavily the bleached and twisted trunk and\nbranches, so aged that there were but few green leaves thereon–a\nplumage of tender, crimson fire out of the heart of the dry wood.\nThe perfume of the tree had now and again reached him, in the\ncurrents of the wind, over the wall, and he had wondered what might\nbe behind it, and was now allowed to fill his arms with the flowers–\nflowers enough for all the old blue-china pots along the chimney-\npiece, making fete in the children’s room.  Was it some periodic\nmoment in the expansion of soul within him, or mere trick of heat in\nthe heavily-laden summer air?",
        "But the beauty of the thing struck home to him feverishly; and in\ndreams all night he loitered along a magic roadway of crimson\nflowers, which seemed to open ruddily in thick, fresh masses about\nhis feet, and fill softly all the little hollows in the banks on\neither side.  Always afterwards, summer by summer, as the flowers\ncame on, the blossom of the red hawthorn still seemed to him\nabsolutely the reddest of all things; and the goodly crimson, still\nalive in the works of old Venetian masters or old Flemish tapestries,\ncalled out always from afar the recollection of the flame in those\nperishing little petals, as it pulsed gradually out of them, kept\nlong in the drawers of an old cabinet.",
        "[186] Also then, for the first time, he seemed to experience a\npassionateness in his relation to fair outward objects, an\ninexplicable excitement in their presence, which disturbed him, and\nfrom which he half longed to be free.  A touch of regret or desire\nmingled all night with the remembered presence of the red flowers,\nand their perfume in the darkness about him; and the longing for some\nundivined, entire possession of them was the beginning of a\nrevelation to him, growing ever clearer, with the coming of the\ngracious summer guise of fields and trees and persons in each\nsucceeding year, of a certain, at times seemingly exclusive,\npredominance in his interests, of beautiful physical things, a kind\nof tyranny of the senses over him.",
        "In later years he came upon philosophies which occupied him much in\nthe estimate of the proportion of the sensuous and the ideal elements\nin human knowledge, the relative parts they bear in it; and, in his\nintellectual scheme, was led to assign very little to the abstract\nthought, and much to its sensible vehicle or occasion.  Such\nmetaphysical speculation did but reinforce what was instinctive in\nhis way of receiving the world, and for him, everywhere, that\nsensible vehicle or occasion became, perhaps only too surely, the\nnecessary concomitant of any perception of things, real enough to be\nof any weight or reckoning, in his house of thought.  There were\ntimes when he could think of the [187] necessity he was under of\nassociating all thoughts to touch and sight, as a sympathetic link\nbetween himself and actual, feeling, living objects; a protest in\nfavour of real men and women against mere grey, unreal abstractions;\nand he remembered gratefully how the Christian religion, hardly less\nthan the religion of the ancient Greeks, translating so much of its\nspiritual verity into things that may be seen, condescends in part to\nsanction this infirmity, if so it be, of our human existence, wherein\nthe world of sense is so much with us, and welcomed this thought as a\nkind of keeper and sentinel over his soul therein.  But certainly, he\ncame more and more to be unable to care for, or think of soul but as\nin an actual body, or of any world but that wherein are water and\ntrees, and where men and women look, so or so, and press actual\nhands.  It was the trick even his pity learned, fastening those who\nsuffered in anywise to his affections by a kind of sensible\nattachments.  He would think of Julian, fallen into incurable\nsickness, as spoiled in the sweet blossom of his skin like pale\namber, and his honey-like hair; of Cecil, early dead, as cut off from\nthe lilies, from golden summer days, from women’s voices; and then\nwhat comforted him a little was the thought of the turning of the\nchild’s flesh to violets in the turf above him.  And thinking of the\nvery poor, it was not the things which most men care most for that he\nyearned to give them; [188] but fairer roses, perhaps, and power to\ntaste quite as they will, at their ease and not task-burdened, a\ncertain desirable, clear light in the new morning, through which\nsometimes he had noticed them, quite unconscious of it, on their way\nto their early toil.",
        "So he yielded himself to these things, to be played upon by them like\na musical instrument, and began to note with deepening watchfulness,\nbut always with some puzzled, unutterable longing in his enjoyment,\nthe phases of the seasons and of the growing or waning day, down even\nto the shadowy changes wrought on bare wall or ceiling–the light\ncast up from the snow, bringing out their darkest angles; the brown\nlight in the cloud, which meant rain; that almost too austere\nclearness, in the protracted light of the lengthening day, before\nwarm weather began, as if it lingered but to make a severer workday,\nwith the school-books opened earlier and later; that beam of June\nsunshine, at last, as he lay awake before the time, a way of gold-\ndust across the darkness; all the humming, the freshness, the perfume\nof the garden seemed to lie upon it–and coming in one afternoon in\nSeptember, along the red gravel walk, to look for a basket of yellow\ncrab-apples left in the cool, old parlour, he remembered it the more,\nand how the colours struck upon him, because a wasp on one bitten\napple stung him, and he felt the passion of [189] sudden, severe\npain.  For this too brought its curious reflexions; and, in relief\nfrom it, he would wonder over it–how it had then been with him–\npuzzled at the depth of the charm or spell over him, which lay, for a\nlittle while at least, in the mere absence of pain; once, especially,\nwhen an older boy taught him to make flowers of sealing-wax, and he\nhad burnt his hand badly at the lighted taper, and been unable to\nsleep.  He remembered that also afterwards, as a sort of typical\nthing–a white vision of heat about him, clinging closely, through\nthe languid scent of the ointments put upon the place to make it\nwell.",
        "Also, as he felt this pressure upon him of the sensible world, then,\nas often afterwards, there would come another sort of curious\nquestioning how the last impressions of eye and ear might happen to\nhim, how they would find him–the scent of the last flower, the soft\nyellowness of the last morning, the last recognition of some object\nof affection, hand or voice; it could not be but that the latest look\nof the eyes, before their final closing, would be strangely vivid;\none would go with the hot tears, the cry, the touch of the wistful\nbystander, impressed how deeply on one! or would it be, perhaps, a\nmere frail retiring of all things, great or little, away from one,\ninto a level distance?",
        "For with this desire of physical beauty mingled itself early the fear\nof death–the fear of death [190] intensified by the desire of\nbeauty.  Hitherto he had never gazed upon dead faces, as sometimes,\nafterwards, at the Morgue in Paris, or in that fair cemetery at\nMunich, where all the dead must go and lie in state before burial,\nbehind glass windows, among the flowers and incense and holy candles-\n-the aged clergy with their sacred ornaments, the young men in their\ndancing-shoes and spotless white linen–after which visits, those\nwaxen, resistless faces would always live with him for many days,\nmaking the broadest sunshine sickly.  The child had heard indeed of\nthe death of his father, and how, in the Indian station, a fever had\ntaken him, so that though not in action he had yet died as a soldier;\nand hearing of the “resurrection of the just,” he could think of him\nas still abroad in the world, somehow, for his protection–a grand,\nthough perhaps rather terrible figure, in beautiful soldier’s things,\nlike the figure in the picture of Joshua’s Vision in the Bible–and\nof that, round which the mourners moved so softly, and afterwards\nwith such solemn singing, as but a worn-out garment left at a\ndeserted lodging.  So it was, until on a summer day he walked with\nhis mother through a fair churchyard.  In a bright dress he rambled\namong the graves, in the gay weather, and so came, in one corner,\nupon an open grave for a child–a dark space on the brilliant grass–\nthe black mould lying heaped up round it, weighing down the little\njewelled [191] branches of the dwarf rose-bushes in flower.  And\ntherewith came, full-grown, never wholly to leave him, with the\ncertainty that even children do sometimes die, the physical horror of\ndeath, with its wholly selfish recoil from the association of lower\nforms of life, and the suffocating weight above.  No benign, grave\nfigure in beautiful soldier’s things any longer abroad in the world\nfor his protection! only a few poor, piteous bones; and above them,\npossibly, a certain sort of figure he hoped not to see.  For sitting\none day in the garden below an open window, he heard people talking,\nand could not but listen, how, in a sleepless hour, a sick woman had\nseen one of the dead sitting beside her, come to call her hence; and\nfrom the broken talk evolved with much clearness the notion that not\nall those dead people had really departed to the churchyard, nor were\nquite so motionless as they looked, but led a secret, half-fugitive\nlife in their old homes, quite free by night, though sometimes\nvisible in the day, dodging from room to room, with no great goodwill\ntowards those who shared the place with them.  All night the figure\nsat beside him in the reveries of his broken sleep, and was not quite\ngone in the morning–an odd, irreconcileable new member of the\nhousehold, making the sweet familiar chambers unfriendly and suspect\nby its uncertain presence.  He could have hated the dead he had\npitied so, for being [192] thus.  Afterwards he came to think of\nthose poor, home-returning ghosts, which all men have fancied to\nthemselves–the revenants–pathetically, as crying, or beating with\nvain hands at the doors, as the wind came, their cries\ndistinguishable in it as a wilder inner note.  But, always making\ndeath more unfamiliar still, that old experience would ever, from\ntime to time, return to him; even in the living he sometimes caught\nits likeness; at any time or place, in a moment, the faint atmosphere\nof the chamber of death would be breathed around him, and the image\nwith the bound chin, the quaint smile, the straight, stiff feet, shed\nitself across the air upon the bright carpet, amid the gayest\ncompany, or happiest communing with himself.",
        "To most children the sombre questionings to which impressions like\nthese attach themselves, if they come at all, are actually suggested\nby religious books, which therefore they often regard with much\nsecret distaste, and dismiss, as far as possible, from their habitual\nthoughts as a too depressing element in life.  To Florian such\nimpressions, these misgivings as to the ultimate tendency of the\nyears, of the relationship between life and death, had been suggested\nspontaneously in the natural course of his mental growth by a strong\ninnate sense for the soberer tones in things, further strengthened by\nactual circumstances; and religious sentiment, that [193] system of\nbiblical ideas in which he had been brought up, presented itself to\nhim as a thing that might soften and dignify, and light up as with a\n“lively hope,” a melancholy already deeply settled in him.  So he\nyielded himself easily to religious impressions, and with a kind of\nmystical appetite for sacred things; the more as they came to him\nthrough a saintly person who loved him tenderly, and believed that\nthis early pre-occupation with them already marked the child out for\na saint.  He began to love, for their own sakes, church lights, holy\ndays, all that belonged to the comely order of the sanctuary, the\nsecrets of its white linen, and holy vessels, and fonts of pure\nwater; and its hieratic purity and simplicity became the type of\nsomething he desired always to have about him in actual life.  He\npored over the pictures in religious books, and knew by heart the\nexact mode in which the wrestling angel grasped Jacob, how Jacob\nlooked in his mysterious sleep, how the bells and pomegranates were\nattached to the hem of Aaron’s vestment, sounding sweetly as he\nglided over the turf of the holy place.  His way of conceiving\nreligion came then to be in effect what it ever afterwards remained–\na sacred history indeed, but still more a sacred ideal, a\ntranscendent version or representation, under intenser and more\nexpressive light and shade, of human life and its familiar or\nexceptional incidents, birth, death, marriage, [194] youth, age,\ntears, joy, rest, sleep, waking–a mirror, towards which men might\nturn away their eyes from vanity and dullness, and see themselves\ntherein as angels, with their daily meat and drink, even, become a\nkind of sacred transaction–a complementary strain or burden, applied\nto our every-day existence, whereby the stray snatches of music in it\nre-set themselves, and fall into the scheme of some higher and more\nconsistent harmony.  A place adumbrated itself in his thoughts,\nwherein those sacred personalities, which are at once the reflex and\nthe pattern of our nobler phases of life, housed themselves; and this\nregion in his intellectual scheme all subsequent experience did but\ntend still further to realise and define.  Some ideal, hieratic\npersons he would always need to occupy it and keep a warmth there.\nAnd he could hardly understand those who felt no such need at all,\nfinding themselves quite happy without such heavenly companionship,\nand sacred double of their life, beside them.",
        "Thus a constant substitution of the typical for the actual took place\nin his thoughts.  Angels might be met by the way, under English elm\nor beech-tree; mere messengers seemed like angels, bound on celestial\nerrands; a deep mysticity brooded over real meetings and partings;\nmarriages were made in heaven; and deaths also, with hands of angels\nthereupon, to bear soul and body quietly asunder, each to its [195]\nappointed rest.  All the acts and accidents of daily life borrowed a\nsacred colour and significance; the very colours of things became\nthemselves weighty with meanings like the sacred stuffs of Moses’\ntabernacle, full of penitence or peace.  Sentiment, congruous in the\nfirst instance only with those divine transactions, the deep,\neffusive unction of the House of Bethany, was assumed as the due\nattitude for the reception of our every-day existence; and for a time\nhe walked through the world in a sustained, not unpleasurable awe,\ngenerated by the habitual recognition, beside every circumstance and\nevent of life, of its celestial correspondent.",
        "Sensibility–the desire of physical beauty–a strange biblical awe,\nwhich made any reference to the unseen act on him like solemn music–\nthese qualities the child took away with him, when, at about the age\nof twelve years, he left the old house, and was taken to live in\nanother place.  He had never left home before, and, anticipating much\nfrom this change, had long dreamed over it, jealously counting the\ndays till the time fixed for departure should come; had been a little\ncareless about others even, in his strong desire for it–when Lewis\nfell sick, for instance, and they must wait still two days longer.\nAt last the morning came, very fine; and all things–the very\npavement with its dust, at the roadside–seemed to have a white,\npearl-like lustre in them.  They were to travel by a [196] favourite\nroad on which he had often walked a certain distance, and on one of\nthose two prisoner days, when Lewis was sick, had walked farther than\never before, in his great desire to reach the new place.  They had\nstarted and gone a little way when a pet bird was found to have been\nleft behind, and must even now–so it presented itself to him–have\nalready all the appealing fierceness and wild self-pity at heart of\none left by others to perish of hunger in a closed house; and he\nreturned to fetch it, himself in hardly less stormy distress.  But as\nhe passed in search of it from room to room, lying so pale, with a\nlook of meekness in their denudation, and at last through that\nlittle, stripped white room, the aspect of the place touched him like\nthe face of one dead; and a clinging back towards it came over him,\nso intense that he knew it would last long, and spoiling all his\npleasure in the realisation of a thing so eagerly anticipated.  And\nso, with the bird found, but himself in an agony of home-sickness,\nthus capriciously sprung up within him, he was driven quickly away,\nfar into the rural distance, so fondly speculated on, of that\nfavourite country-road.",
