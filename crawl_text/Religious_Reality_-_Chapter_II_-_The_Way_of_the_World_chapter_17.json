        "The three traditional enemies of the Christian life are symbolized\nunder the headings of the World, the Flesh, and the Devil, and the\nclassification has a certain convenience. The “World” stands in this\nconnexion for human society in so far as it is organized apart from\nChrist. It is obvious that “the way of the world,” as represented by\nthe general outlook of conventional society, is in many respects in\nmanifest conflict with the principles of the Gospel. The existing\nsocial order is the product of a compromise between inherited\ninfluences and standards which are in a certain sense broadly\nChristian, and the natural man’s instinctive selfishness in matters\nboth individual and social. The conflict against the spirit of\nworldliness which should be one of the marks of a genuine Christian\nlife is beset by peculiar difficulties, precisely because in a society\nwhich is in some respects partially Christian the issues are confused.\nPublic opinion indubitably tolerates many things which should not be\ntolerated, and condones others which should not be condoned. But\npublic opinion approves much that is good, and does lip-service to a\nvariety of Christian ideals, even while reserving the reality of its\ndevotion for the worship of success and material comfort.",
        "Perhaps it may be said that the most fundamental characteristic of\nessentially “worldly” opinion is absence of idealism. Worldliness is\nthe principle of contentment with things as they are. Against\nworldliness, so defined, the Christian is committed to a conflict all\nalong the line, since even in those regions of life and conduct in\nwhich the standards recognized by the world are right and good so far\nas they go, “the good is the enemy of the best.” To rest content at\nany point with what has already been attained is fatal to all\nspiritual advance. It is, in effect, the death of the soul.",
        "Mr. William Temple has remarked that in the conflict of Christians\nagainst the Devil and the Flesh the public opinion of the Church, as\nvisibly organized, is on their side, but that in their conflict with\nthe World it is decidedly against them. That is an over-statement, but\nit conveys a truth. Undoubtedly the Church has made compromises with\nthe World, a fact which arises partly as the result of the inclusion\nwithin her fold of a large proportion of merely nominal members whose\nChristianity is no more than an inherited or conventional tradition. A\nfurther point of importance is this. Two thousand years is not a long\nperiod in relation to the scale of the world’s history as a whole, and\nChristianity is still a comparatively young religion. The problem of\nworldliness is mainly a problem of the relation of the Church to the\nsocial order; and there are reasons why it was natural that the\nworking out of the Christian ideal of conduct should first have been\ndeveloped in relation to the affairs of private and domestic life.",
        "Christians in the early days were a “little flock,” surrounded by a\nsociety whose standards and conventions and beliefs were frankly pagan\nand hostile. So long as these conditions obtained the issues were\nplain: the contrast in ideals between Church and World stood out sharp\nand clear. The world, it was held, was ready to perish, and destined\nat no distant date to do so. “The whole world,” writes S. John, “lieth\nin wickedness.” The Church stood apart as the spiritual brotherhood of\nGOD’S elect who were called to assist at the obsequies of a world\nwhich was in process of passing away. “The world passeth away, and the\nlust thereof: but he that doeth the will of GOD abideth for ever.”",
        "The words contain an eternal truth: but in their literal sense they\nexpressed a mistaken judgment. The world–that is, secular society–\ndid not pass away. It is with us still. For a period of some three\nhundred years it persecuted the Church. At the end of that period it\naccepted baptism, but not its implications. The Church has been\nengaged ever since in the task of attempting to Christianize the\nheathen within her own borders.",
        "The Church was outwardly secularized: and the minority who could not\ntolerate the secularization of her ideals took refuge in the hermit’s\ncell or in the cloister. In these retreats was developed the practice\nof Christianity as an art or science of individual sanctity, but at\nthe cost of a certain aloofness from the rough and tumble of workaday\nlife. The Christianity of the Middle Ages was fertilized from the\ncloister, with the result that the spiritual ideals even of those\nChristians who remained “in the world” tended to be coloured by the\nmonastic tradition. The Christian man of the world who took seriously\nthe practice of his religion aimed at reproducing at second hand the\nChristianity of the monk. The salvation of the individual soul tended\nto be regarded as the supreme end of Christian endeavour, rather than\nthe service of the brethren.",
        "The Reformation, when it came, did nothing to diminish this\nindividualism of the religious outlook, but rather accentuated it. The\nwhole emphasis of Protestantism was thrown upon the life of the\nindividual soul in relation to GOD, to the comparative neglect of the\nimportance of the conception of membership in the Church. To the\nordinary worldling the advent of Protestantism meant simply that he\nneed no longer trouble to go to Mass or to Confession. The Protestant\nwho took his religion seriously became a Puritan, a type resembling\nthe monk of Catholicism in his attempted isolation from the world, yet\nlacking the peculiar otherworldly mysticism of the monkish character\nat its best, and having a peculiar knack of making religion appear\nrepellent to the ordinary man.",
        "The emergence of the ideal of a genuinely social Christianity, aiming\nnot at escape from the world by way of flight, but at the deliberate\nconquest of the world for Christ by the resolute application of\nChristian standards to the ordinary life of men in society, is of\ncomparatively recent date. It began in this country with the writings\nof Kingsley and Maurice, and various living teachers both in England\nand in America have carried on their work. It is one of the\nmisfortunes of Germany that she has had no corresponding movement. As\na consequence we are confronted at the present time with the spectacle\nof various leaders of religious thought in Germany, too honest not to\nperceive the glaring contrasts between the way of the world and the\nprecepts of the Gospel, deliberately maintaining the position that\nChristianity is solely adapted to be a religion of private life, and\nthat Christian standards and ideals have no application as between\nclass and class, or as between nation and nation. To adopt such an\nattitude is to abandon all hope of the redemption of society. It is to\ncondemn the world in perpetuity to a fate of which the present war is\nthe appropriate symbol.",
        "The war is, in effect, a kind of sacrament of the power of Antichrist.\nIt is the outward and visible sign of the inward character and essence\nof a civilisation founded upon principles which are the opposite of\nthose of the Gospel. Neither men nor nations, in the world as we have\nknown it, have been wont to love their neighbours as themselves. The\nway of the world is, and has been, the way of selfishness.",
        "This is not any the less true because the world’s selfishness has been\nto a considerable extent unconscious, and has arisen rather from\nabsence of thought than from deliberate badness of heart. The world\ndoes not always realize how cruel are its ways towards the weak and\nthe socially unfortunate, or towards those who, for whatever reason,\ntransgress its code. For the world has a code of its own, both in\nmanners and in morals, though the basis of its code is convention, and\nits standard respectability rather than virtue. The world is very apt\nto show itself implacable towards those whom it regards as being\nbeyond its pale, and to exhibit, in effect, the spirit and temper\nwhich, when manifested in the religious sphere, we know and loathe as\nPharisaism. Pharisaism, like worldliness, has penetrated to an\nalarming extent into the Church of England.",
        "Parallel and proportionate to the world’s selfishness is its cynicism.\nThis also is largely unconscious. Lacking any true insight into\nspiritual realities, the world lacks vision and lacks hope. It\npresumes always that “the thing which has been, it is that which shall\nbe.” It beholds the evil that is done under the sun, and pronounces it\ninevitable. It fails to understand that to pronounce any evil\ninevitable is to be guilty of blasphemy against the GOD of heaven.",
        "Against the spirit of the worldly world, its selfishness and cynicism,\nits conventional judgments and shallowness of mind, the Christian is\ncalled deliberately to make war. The Church exists to be to the world\nand its ways a permanent challenge: to be the champion in all\ncircumstances and times of righteousness and truth; to insist upon\nbringing to bear on human life in all its relationships, both\ncorporate and individual, the spirit of brotherhood, which is the\nSpirit of Christ. It was a true instinct which led S. Ignatius Loyola\nto pray on behalf of the Order which he founded that it might be hated\nby the world. “Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.... If\nye were of the world, the world would love his own.” If the world does\nnot hate the Church it is not because the world has become Christian,\nbut because worldliness has taken possession of the Church. The world\nto-day regards the Church as not worth hating, as a negligible\nquantity. When the Church is once more ready to be crucified, then the\nopposition of the world will be revived, and the Church will suffer\nmartyrdom afresh.",
