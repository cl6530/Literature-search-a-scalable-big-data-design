        "As morning dawned and the poets slowly climbed out of the infernal region\nand stepped upon the isle from which the Mount of Purgatory rises, they\nwere accosted by an old man with long white hair and beard, Cato of Utica,\nwho demanded the reason of their coming, and only permitted them to remain\nwhen he heard that a lady from Heaven had given the command. Then he\nordered Vergil to lave the smoke of Hell from Dante’s face in the waves of\nthe sea, and to gird him with the reed of humility. As the sun rose a\nradiant angel, guiding a boat laden with souls, appeared, and the poets\nfell on their knees until he departed.",
        "As the newly-landed spirits questioned Vergil of the way up the mountain,\nDante recognized among them his beloved friend Casella, the musician, and\ntried in vain to embrace his spirit body. At Dante’s request, Casella\nbegan to sing, and the enchanted spirits were scattered only by the\nchiding voice of Cato.",
        "Vergil surveyed the insurmountable height before them, and hastened with\nDante to inquire the way of a troop of souls coming towards them. As they\ntalked, Dante recognized one, blond and smiling, with a gash over one\neyebrow and another over his heart. It was Manfredi, King of Apulia and\nSicily, who was slain at Benevento by Charles of Anjou, and, being under\nexcommunication, was not allowed Christian burial. He asked Dante to make\nhim happy by telling his daughter that by faith he was saved from eternal\ndestruction, but because of his sins he must spend thirty times the time\nthat his presumption had endured at the foot of the mount, unless his time\nwas shortened by the righteous prayers of his friends on earth.",
        "It was with the greatest difficulty that the poets clambered up the steep\nand narrow path to the next terrace, and only the assurance that the\nascent would grow easier as he neared the summit sustained Dante. As\nVergil explained to him while resting on the next terrace that the sun\nappeared on his left because Purgatory and Jerusalem were in different\nhemispheres, some one spoke, and turning they saw a group of persons in an\nattitude of indolence, among them a Florentine acquaintance, Belacqua, a\nmaker of musical instruments, who sat waiting the length of another\nlifetime for admission above because he had postponed conversion from time\nto time, through negligence.",
        "Proceeding, the poets met a concourse of souls who had suffered violent\ndeath, chanting the Miserere, who perceiving Dante to be living, sent\nmessages to their friends on earth. Among these were Giacopo del Cassero\nand Buonconte di Montefeltro, son of Dante’s friend, Guido di Montefeltro,\nwho fell in the battle of Campaldino, in which Dante had taken part.\nWounded in the neck, he fell, and had just time to breathe a prayer to\nMary, thus saving his soul from the Evil One, who was so incensed that,\nraising a great storm, he caused the rivers to overflow and sweep away the\nlifeless body, tearing from it the cross he had made with his arms in his\nlast agony, and burying it in the mire of the Arno. The third shade bade\nhim think of her when, returned home, he sang of his journey. She was Pia,\nborn at Sienna, who died at Maremma, by the hand of her husband.",
        "Dante at last managed to escape from these shades, who implored him to ask\nfor prayers for them on earth, and moved on with Vergil until they met the\nhaughty shade of Sordello, who clasped Vergil in his arms when he learned\nhe was a Mantuan. Touched by this expression of love for his native land,\nDante launched into an apostrophe to degenerate Italy, to that German\nAlbert who refused to save the country groaning under oppression, and to\nlost Florence, torn by internecine wars.",
        "When Sordello learned that the Mantuan shade was Vergil, he humbled\nhimself before him, and paid him reverence, asking eagerly in what part of\nthe underworld he dwelt. The sun was sinking, and as the poets could not\nascend by night, he urged them to pass the night with him. Leading them to\na vale carpeted with emerald grass and brilliant with flowers, he pointed\nout the shades singing “Salve Regina” as the Emperor Rudolph,–he who made\nan effort to heal sick Italy,–Philip III. of France, Charles I. of\nNaples, and Henry III. of England. As the hour of twilight approached,\nthat hour in which the sailor thinks of home, and the pilgrim thrills at\nthe sound of vesper bells, Dante beheld a shade arise, and lifting its\npalms begin to sing the vesper hymn. Soon two radiant angels clad in\ndelicate green descended from Heaven, holding flaming swords. These,\nSordello explained, were to keep off the serpent that threatened this fair\nvale at night.",
        "As the hour of night approached in which the swallow laments its woes,\nDante fell asleep on the grass and dreamed that he was Ganymede snatched\nfrom Mt. Ida by Jove’s eagle. Awaking, he found himself alone with Vergil\nin a strange place, with the sun two hours high. Lucia, symbolical of the\nenlightening grace of Heaven, had conveyed him to the spot and pointed out\nto Vergil the gate of Purgatory. Cheered and confident, he rose, and they\nwent together to the portal and mounted the three steps, the first of\nshining white marble, the second of purple stone, cracked and burnt, and\nthe third of flaming red porphyry. There, on the diamond threshold, sat an\nangel with a naked sword, clad in a robe of ashen gray, whose face was too\nbright to look upon. When Dante fell on his knees and implored entrance,\nthe angel imprinted on his forehead seven “P\"’s for the seven sins\n(Peccata), and opening the gate with the gold and silver keys, ushered\nthem into the mighty portals. “From Peter I have these keys. Me he\ninstructed to err rather in opening than in keeping shut. But see that ye\nlook not behind, or ye will at once return.”",
        "With much difficulty the two poets ascended the steep and winding path,\nand paused to view the wonderful sculptures on the embankment, that would\nput Nature herself to shame, so natural were they. Many examples of\nHumility were there portrayed,–the Virgin Mary, the Holy Ark, drawn by\noxen, the Psalmist dancing before the Lord, while Michal looked forth in\nscorn from her palace window, and Trajan, yielding to the widow’s prayer.\nAs they stood there, the souls came in sight. “Reader, attend not to the\nfashion of the torment, but think of what follows.” The unhappy ones crept\naround the terrace, bowed under a heavy burden of stones, and the most\npatient, as he bent under his burden, exclaimed, with tears, “I can do no\nmore!” As they walked they repeated the Lord’s Prayer, and kept their eyes\nfixed on the life-like sculptures on the floor of those who had suffered\nbefore them for the sins of pride: Lucifer, falling from Heaven; Briareus\nand Nimrod overcome by the bolts of Jove; Niobe, weeping among her dead\nchildren; Cyrus’s head taunted by Tomyris; Troy humbled in ashes.",
        "As Vergil approached the penitents to inquire the way to the next terrace,\nhe and Dante were invited to join the procession and talk with one who\ncould not lift his face enough to see them. This was Omberto, who had been\nslain by the Siennese for his unbearable pride. Dante also talked with his\nfriend Oderigi, an illuminator of manuscript, who now humbly acknowledged\nthat he was far surpassed by Franco Bolognese. “What is mundane glory?” he\nexclaimed, as he pointed out Provenzano Salvani, with whose fame Tuscany\nonce rang, but who barely escaped Hell by his voluntary humiliation for a\nfriend. “Lift up thy face!” commanded Vergil, as Dante walked with his\nhead bowed, absorbed in the floor-sculptures; and as he looked, the\nwhite-robed angel whose face was like “a tremulous flame” approached, and\nstruck Dante’s forehead with his wings. Dante marvelled at the ease with\nwhich he mounted, until his master explained that the heaviest sin, the\nsin that underlies all others, had fallen from him when the angel struck\nthe “P” from his forehead, and that the ascent would grow still lighter\nfrom terrace to terrace. “Blessed are the poor in spirit!” sung by sweet\nvoices, greeted the mounting poets.",
        "The second terrace was of livid stone unrelieved by any sculpture. The air\nwas full of voices inculcating charity and self-denial, and others\nlamenting the sin of envy. Here envy was punished, and here the sharpest\npain pierced Dante’s heart as he saw the penitents sit shoulder to\nshoulder against the cliff, robed in sackcloth of the same livid color,\ntheir eyelids, through which bitter tears trickled, sewed together with\nwire. Sapia of Sienna first greeted Dante and entreated him to pray for\nher. When she had told how, after having been banished from her city, she\nhad prayed that her townsman might be defeated by the Florentines, Dante\npassed on and spoke with Guido of Duca, who launched into an invective\nagainst Florence to his companion Rinieri. “The whole valley of the Arno\nis so vile that its very name should die. Wonder not at my tears, Tuscan,\nwhen I recall the great names of the past, and compare them with the curs\nwho have fallen heir to them. Those counts are happiest who have left no\nfamilies.” Guido himself was punished on this terrace because of his envy\nof every joyous man, and the spirit with whom he talked was Rinieri, whose\nline had once been highly honored. “Go, Tuscan,” exclaimed Guido, “better\nnow I love my grief than speech.” As the poets passed on, the air was\nfilled with the lamentations of sinful but now repentant spirits.",
        "Dazzled by the Angel’s splendor, the poets passed up the stairs to the\nthird terrace, Dante in the mean time asking an explanation of Guido’s\nwords on joint resolve and trust.",
        "“The less one thinks of another’s possessions,” replied his guide, “and\nthe more he speaks of ’our’ instead of ’my,’ the more of the Infinite Good\nflows towards him. If you thirst for further instruction, await the coming\nof Beatrice.”",
        "As they attained the next height, Dante, rapt in vision, saw the sweet\nMother questioning her Son in the Temple, saw Pisistratus, his queen, and\nthe martyred Stephen blessing his enemies in death. As he awoke, they\npassed on, to become involved in a thick cloud of smoke, through which it\nwas impossible to distinguish any object, and whose purpose was to purge\naway anger, the sin-cloud that veils the mortal eye.",
        "As they passed from the thick smoke into the sunset, Dante fell into a\ntrance, and saw Itys, Haman, and other notable examples of unbridled\nangers, and as the visions faded away, was blinded by the splendor of the\nangel guide who directed them to the fourth terrace. As they waited for\nthe dawn, Vergil answered Dante’s eager questions. “Love,” he said, “is\nthe seed of every virtue, and also of every act for which God punished\nman. Natural love is without error; but if it is bent on evil aims, if it\nlacks sufficiency, or if it overleaps its bounds and refuses to be\ngoverned by wise laws, it causes those sins that are punished on this\nmount. The defective love which manifests itself as slothfulness is\npunished on this terrace.”",
        "A troop of spirits rushed past them as morning broke, making up by their\nhaste for the sloth that had marked their lives on earth. As they hurried\non they urged themselves to diligence by cries of “In haste the mountains\nblessed Mary won!” “Caesar flew to Spain!” “Haste! Grace grows best in\nthose who ardor feel!” As the poet meditated on their words, he lapsed\ninto a dream in which he saw the Siren who drew brave mariners from their\ncourses; and even as he listened to her melodious song, he beheld her\nexposed by a saint-like lady, Lucia, or Illuminating Grace. Day dawned,\nthe Angel fanned the fourth “P” from his forehead, and the poet ascended\nto the fifth terrace, where lay the shades of the avaricious, prostrate on\nthe earth, weeping over their sins. They who in life had resolutely turned\ntheir gaze from Heaven and fixed it on the things of the earth, must now\ngrovel in the dust, denouncing avarice, and extolling the poor and liberal\nuntil the years have worn away their sin.",
        "Bending over Pope Adrian the Fifth, Dante heard his confession that he was\nconverted while he held the Roman shepherd’s staff. Then he learned how\nfalse a dream was life, but too late, alas! to escape this punishment. As\nDante spoke with the shade of Capet the elder, a mighty trembling shook\nthe mountain, which chilled his heart until he learned from the shade of\nStatius, whom they next met, that it was caused by the moving upward of a\npurified soul, his own, that had been undergoing purgation on this terrace\nfive hundred years and more. “Statius was I,” said the shade, “and my\ninspiration came from that bright fountain of heavenly fire, the Aeneid;\nit was my mother; to it I owe my fame. Gladly would I have added a year to\nmy banishment here, could I have known the Mantuan.” Vergil’s glance said\n“Be mute!” but Dante’s smile betrayed the secret, and Statius fell at\nVergil’s feet adoring. Statius had suffered for the sin of prodigality,\nwhich was punished, together with avarice, on this terrace.",
        "The three proceeded upward to the sixth terrace, the ascent growing easier\non the disappearance of the “P” of avarice from Dante’s forehead. Vergil\nand Statius moved on in loving conversation, Dante reverently following.\n“Your Pollio led me to Christianity,” said Statius, “but my cowardice\ncaused me long to conceal it. Prodigality brought me hither.”",
        "On the sixth terrace two trees stood in opposite parts of the pathway that\nthe gluttons were compelled to tread, the first with branches broad at the\ntop and tapering downward, so that it was impossible to mount it; upon it\nfell a fount of limpid water. From its branches a voice cried, “Of this\nfood ye shall have a scarcity. In the primal age, acorns furnished sweet\nfood and each rivulet seemed nectar.” Towards the next tree, grown from a\ntwig of the tree of knowledge, the gluttons stretched eager hands, but a\nvoice cried, “Pass on; approach not!” Such desire for food was excited by\nthese tempting fruits, that the gluttons were emaciated beyond\nrecognition. By his voice alone did Dante recognize his kinsman Forese,\nwhose time in Purgatory had been shortened by the prayers of his wife\nNella. Forese talked with Dante for a while on the affairs of Florence,\nand predicted the fall of his brother Corso Donati.",
        "The dazzling splendor of the angel of the seventh terrace warned them of\nhis approach, and, lightened of one more “P,” Dante and his companions\nclimbed to where two bands of spirits, lascivious on earth, moved through\npaths of purifying flames, stopping as they passed to greet each other,\nand singing penitential hymns. Here, Statius explained to Dante why the\nshades of the sixth terrace were lean from want of food when they\npossessed no longer their physical bodies. “After death the soul keeps its\nmemory, intelligence, and will more active than before, and as soon as it\nreaches either the banks of Acheron or the Tiber, a shade form is attached\nto it which acquires the soul’s semblance, and has every sense given it,\neven that of sight.”",
        "Guido Guinicelli, from out the flame-furnace, explained to Dante the\npunishments of the terrace: “Thus are our base appetites burned out that\nwe may enjoy future happiness,” and Arnaud the Troubadour, hating his past\nfollies, weeping and singing, implored Dante’s prayers. It was only by\ntelling him that the fire lay between him and Beatrice that Vergil\nprevailed on Dante to walk into the flames, which, though they tortured\nhim by the intensity of their heat, did not consume even his garments. As\nthey left the fire, the sun was setting, and they passed the night on the\nsteps of the next terrace, Statius and Vergil watching Dante as the\ngoatherds watch their flocks. In a dream the sleeping poet saw Leah,\nsymbolical of the active life, in contrast to her sister Rachel, of\ncontemplative life. On waking, Vergil told him that he would accompany him\nfurther, but not as a guide; henceforth his own free will must lead him.\n“Crowned, mitred, now thyself thou ’lt rule aright.”",
        "Dense green were the heavenly woodlands of the terrestrial paradise; sweet\nwere the bird songs, as sweet the songs of the whispering foliage; and on\nthe pleasant mead, beyond the dimpling waters of a stream so small that\nthree paces would span it, walked a beautiful lady, Matilda, gathering\nflowers and singing an enchanting melody. At Dante’s request, she came\nnearer, and explained to him that God had created the terrestrial paradise\nfrom which man was banished by his fault alone. To vex him it was raised\nto this height. Its atmosphere was not that of the earth below, but given\nit from the free sphere of ether. Here every plant had its origin; here\neach river had its virtue; Lethe destroyed the memory of sin; Eunoë\nrestored to the mind the memory of things good.",
        "As they talked, Hosannas were heard, and in the greatest splendor appeared\nthe Car of the Church Triumphant. First came the seven golden\ncandlesticks; following them, many people in resplendent white garments;\nnext, the four and twenty elders, lily crowned–the twenty-four books of\nthe Old Testament–singing to Beatrice “O blessed Thou!” Then four\nsix-winged, many-eyed living creatures described both by Ezekiel and John\nsurrounded the massive car drawn by the Gryphon, emblem of our Lord in his\ndivine and human nature, white, gold, and vermilion-hued, part lion, part\neagle, whose wings pierced the heavens.",
        "Three maidens, red, emerald, and white, the Theological Virtues, Faith,\nHope, and Charity, danced at the right wheel of the car; four clad in\npurple, Prudence, Justice, Fortitude, and Temperance, walked at the left\nwheel. With them came two old men, Luke and Paul; then four together,\nJames, Peter, John, and Jude, and last an aged man walking in slumber,\nSaint John, writer of the Revelation. These last were crowned with red\nroses and other tinted flowers. With a crash as of thunder, the car\nstopped before Dante, and a hundred angels, chanting, showered on it roses\nand lilies. In the midst of the shower, Beatrice descended, clad in a\ncrimson robe, with a green mantle and a white veil, and crowned with an\nolive wreath. Thrilling with his ancient love, Dante turned to Vergil to\nsustain him, but Vergil was gone. As he looked again, her eyes, less\nsevere from the veil that enveloped her, were fixed on him as she rebuked\nhim, and he was sustained only by the compassion in the sweet voices of\nthe angels, which soothed him until the tears rained down his cheeks.",
        "After her death, when she had arisen from flesh to spirit, Beatrice\ncomplained that her influence was dimmed, and that he had sought such\ndepths that she had been compelled to go to the gates of hell to implore\nVergil to bring him hither that he might learn his future sufferings if he\ndid not repent. As he answered her, blaming the things that had led him\naside with joys deceitful, he tried to gaze into her eyes, but stung with\npenitential thorns, fell senseless to the ground. Matilda, who stood by,\nseized him and plunged him into the river Lethe, that he might forget his\npast sin. Dripping, he was given to the four lovely maidens, who led him\nbefore Beatrice that he might look into her eyes, fixed on the Gryphon. A\nthousand longings held him fast while, “weary from ten years’ thirsting,\"\nhe gazed upon her lovely eyes, now unveiled in their full splendor.\nReproached at last by the seven virtues for his too intent gaze, Dante\nwatched the car move on to the Tree of Knowledge, to which its pole was\nattached by the Gryphon. Dante, lulled to sleep by the hymn, was aroused\nby Matilda, who pointed out to him the radiant Beatrice, sitting under a\ntree surrounded by the bright forms of her attendants. The other\nattendants of the car had followed the Gryphon to the skies.",
        "“Observe the car,” said Beatrice, “and write what thou hast seen when thou\nreturnest home.” As she spoke, the car was attacked in turn by the eagle\nof persecution, the fox of heresy, and the dragon of Islamism; these\ndriven away, it was disturbed by inward dissensions, the alliance between\nBoniface and Philip the Fair.",
        "Rising, Beatrice called Dante, Statius, and Matilda to her, and as they\nwalked upon that pleasant mead, she asked Dante the meaning of his\ncontinued silence. She explained the attacks on the chariot to him, but he\ndeclared that he could not understand her language. Then, at Beatrice’s\nnod, Matilda called him and Statius, and plunged them into Eunoë, whence\nhe rose regenerate, and prepared to mount to the stars.",
