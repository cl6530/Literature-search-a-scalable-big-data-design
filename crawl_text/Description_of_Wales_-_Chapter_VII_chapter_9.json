        "Origin of the names Cambria and Wales",
        "Cambria was so called from Camber, son of Brutus, for Brutus,\ndescending from the Trojans, by his grandfather, Ascanius, and\nfather, Silvius, led the remnant of the Trojans, who had long been\ndetained in Greece, into this western isle; and having reigned many\nyears, and given his name to the country and people, at his death\ndivided the kingdom of Wales between his three sons.  To his eldest\nson, Locrinus, he gave that part of the island which lies between\nthe rivers Humber and Severn, and which from him was called\nLoegria.  To his second son, Albanactus, he gave the lands beyond\nthe Humber, which took from him the name of Albania.  But to his\nyoungest son, Camber, he bequeathed all that region which lies\nbeyond the Severn, and is called after him Cambria; hence the\ncountry is properly and truly called Cambria, and its inhabitants\nCambrians, or Cambrenses.  Some assert that their name was derived\nfrom CAM and GRAECO, that is, distorted Greek, on account of the\naffinity of their languages, contracted by their long residence in\nGreece; but this conjecture, though plausible, is not well founded\non truth.",
        "The name of Wales was not derived from Wallo, a general, or\nWandolena, the queen, as the fabulous history of Geoffrey Arthurius\n(15) falsely maintains, because neither of these personages are to\nbe found amongst the Welsh; but it arose from a barbarian\nappellation.  The Saxons, when they seized upon Britain, called\nthis nation, as they did all foreigners, Wallenses; and thus the\nbarbarous name remains to the people and their country. (16)",
        "Having discoursed upon the quality and quantity of the land, the\ngenealogies of the princes, the sources of the rivers, and the\nderivation of the names of this country, we shall now consider the\nnature and character of the nation.",
