        "[Friars bulwark of Spanish rule.] If, therefore, it is the wish of\nthe government to retain the subjection of this colony, and raise\nit to the high degree of prosperity of which it is susceptible,\nthe first thing, in my opinion, that ought to be attended to is the\ngood organization of its spiritual administration. On this subject\nwe must not deceive ourselves. I again repeat, that as long as the\nlocal government, in consequence of the want of military forces,\nand owing to the scarcity of Europeans, does not in itself possess\nthe means of insuring obedience, no other alternative remains. It is\nnecessary to call in to its aid the powerful influence of religion,\nand to obtain from the Peninsula fresh supplies of missionaries. As\nin their nature the latter are essentially different from the other\npublic functionaries, it is well known they neither seek nor aspire to\nany remuneration for their labors, their only hope being to obtain,\nin the opinion of the community at large, that degree of respect to\nwhich they justly consider themselves entitled. Let, therefore, their\npre-eminences be retained to them: let them be treated with decorum;\nthe care and direction of the Indians confided to their charge, and\nthey always be found united in support of justice and the legitimate\nauthority.",
        "[Unwise to discredit priests.] Nothing is more unjust, and of nothing\nhave the spiritual directors of the provinces so much reason to\ncomplain, than the little discernment with which they have sometimes\nbeen judged and condemned, by causing the misconduct of some of their\nindividual members to affect the whole body. Hence is it that no one\ncan read without shame and indignation, the insidious suggestions and\nallusions, derogatory to their character, contained in the Regulations\nof Government framed at Manila in the year 1758, and which although\nmodified by orders of the king, are at the present moment still in\nforce, owing to the want of others, and found in a printed form in\nthe hands of every one. Granting that in some particular instances,\nreal causes of complaint might have existed, yet in the end, what\ndoes it matter if here and there a religious character has abused\nthe confidence reposed in him, as long as the spirit by which the\ngenerality of them are actuated, corresponds to the sanctity of their\nstate, and is besides conformable to the views of government? Why\nshould we be eternally running after an ideal of perfection which\ncan never be met with? Nor, indeed, is this necessary in the present\nconstruction of society.",
        "[Testimony in their behalf] If, however, any weight is to be attached\nto imposture with which, from personal motives, attempts have been\nmade to obscure the truth, and prejudice the public mind against\nthe regular clergy; or, if the just defense on which I have entered,\nshould be attributed to partiality or visionary impressions, let the\nArchives of the Colonial Department be opened, and we shall there\nfind the report drawn up by order of the king on November 26, 1804, by\nthe governor of the Philippine Islands, Don Rafael Maria de Aguilar,\nwith a view to convey information regarding the enquiries at that\ntime instituted respecting the reduction of the inhabitants of the\nIsland of Mindoro; a report extremely honorable to the regular clergy,\nand dictated by the experience that general had acquired during a\nperiod of more than twelve years he had governed. Therein also will\nbe seen the answer to the consultation addressed to his successor in\nthe command, Don Mariano Fernandez de Folgueras, under date of April\n25, 1809, in which he most earnestly beseeches the king to endeavor,\nby every possible means, to send out religious missionaries; deploring\nthe decline and want of order he had observed with his own eyes in the\ntowns administered by native clergymen, and pointing out the urgent\nnecessity of intrusting the spiritual government of these provinces\nto the dexterous management of the former. Testimonies of such weight\nare more than sufficient at once to refute the calumnies and contrary\nopinions put forth on this subject, and at the same time serve as\nirrefragable proofs of the scrupulous impartiality with which I have\nendeavored to discuss so delicate a matter.",
        "In a general point of view, I have alluded to the erroneous system,\nwhich during the last few years has been pursued by the government\nwith regard to the parish-curates employed in the interior, and also\nsufficiently pointed out the advantages reasonably to be expected\nif the government, acting on a different policy, or rather guided\nby other motives of state, instead of following the literal text\nof our Indian legislation, should come to the firm determination of\nindirectly divesting themselves of a small portion of their authority\nin favor of the religious laborers who are acting on the spot. Having\nsaid thus much, I shall proceed to such further details as are more\nimmediately connected with the present chapter.",
        "[Ecclesiastical Organization.] The ecclesiastical jurisdiction is\nexercised by the metropolitan archbishop of Manila, aided by the\nthree suffragans of Nueva Segovia, Nueva Caceres and Cebu.",
        "The archbishopric of Manila comprehends the provinces of Tondo,\nBulacan, Pampanga, Bataan, Cavite, Laguna de Bay, Zambales, Batangas,\nand the Island of Mindoro.",
        "The bishopric of Nueva Segovia comprehends the province of Pangasinan,\nthe missions of Ituy and Paniqui, the provinces of Ilocos, Cagayan,\nand the missions of the Batanes Islands.",
        "That of Nueva Caceres comprehends the provinces of Tayabas, Nueva\nEcija, Camarines and Albay.",
        "That of Cebu comprehends the Islands of Cebu and Bohol, Iloilo,\nCapiz and Antique, in the Island of Panay, the Islands of La Paragua,\nNegros and Samar, Misamis, Caraga and Zamboanga in that of Mindanao,\nand the Mariana Islands.",
        "The archbishop has a salary of $5,000 and the bishops $4,000 each. The\ncuracies exceed 500, and although all of them originally were in charge\nof persons belonging to the religious orders, owing to the expulsion\nof the Jesuits and the excessive scarcity of regular clergy, so many\nnative priests have gradually been introduced among them, that,\nat present, nearly half the towns are under their direction. The\nrest are administered by the religious orders of St. Augustine,\nSt. Dominic and St. Francis, in the following manner:",
        "                                                Towns.\n    The Augustinians                            88\n    The barefooted Augustinians (Recoletos)     52\n    The Dominicans                              57\n    The Franciscans                             96\n    Total                                      293",
        "It ought, however, to be observed, that since the detailed statement\nwas made out, from which the above extract has been taken, so many\nmembers of the religious orders have died, that it has been necessary\nto replace them in many towns with native clergymen, as a temporary\nexpedient, and till new missionaries shall arrive from Spain.",
        "[Dual supervision over friars.] The monastic curates are immediately\nsubject to their provincial superior, in the character of friars but\ndepend on the diocesan bishop in their quality of parish priests; and\nin like manner obey their own provincial vicars, as well as those of\nthe bishop. They are alternately eligible to the dignities of their\nown order, and generally promoted, or relieved from their ministry,\nat the discretion of the provincial chapter, or according to the final\ndetermination of the vice-patron or bishop, affixed to the triple\nlist presented to him. Besides the ordinary obligations attached to\nthe care of souls, they are enjoined to assist at the elections of\ngovernors and other officers of justice, in their respective towns,\nin order to inform the chief magistrate respecting the aptitude of\nthe persons proposed for election on the triple lists, and to point\nout the legal defects attributable to any of them. On this account,\nthey are not, however, allowed to interfere in the smallest degree\nwith any of these proceedings, and much less make a formal proposal,\nas most assuredly would be advisable if permitted so to do, in favor\nof any particular person or persons in their opinion fit for the\ndischarge of the above mentioned duties. It is their obligation to\nascertain the correctness of the tribute lists presented to them\nfor their examination and signature by the chief of the clans,\nby carefully comparing them with the registers kept in their own\ndepartment; and also to certify the general returns, without which\nrequisite the statements transmitted by the chief magistrates to\nthe accountant-general’s office are not admitted. Above all they\nare bound to affix their signatures to the effective payments made\nby the magistrate to their parishioners on account of daily labor,\nand to certify similarly the value of materials employed in public\nworks. Besides the above, they are continually called upon to draw\nup circumstantial reports, or declarations, required by the superior\ntribunals; they receive frequent injunctions to co-operate in the\nincrease of the king’s revenue and the encouragement of agriculture\nand industry; in a word, there is scarcely a thing to which their\nattention is not called, and to which it is not expected they should\ncontribute by their influence, directly or indirectly.",
        "[Allowances from treasury.] The royal treasury pays them an annual\nallowance equal to $180, in kind and money, for each five hundred\ntributes under their care, and this, added to the emoluments of the\nchurch, renders the total proceeds of a curacy generally equivalent\nto about from six to eight reals for each entire tribute; but\nfrom this allowance are to be deducted the expenses of coadjutors,\nsubsistence, servants, horses, and all the other charges arising\nout of the administration of such wearisome duties; nor are the\nparishioners under any other obligation than to provide the churches\nwith assistants, or sacristans and singers, and the curates with\nprovisions at tariff prices.",
        "[Need of more European clergy.] Finally, as from what has been above\nstated it would appear, that as many as five hundred religious persons\nare necessary for the spiritual administration of the interior towns\nand districts, besides the number requisite to do the duty and fill\nthe dignities of the respective orders and convents in the capital,\nindependent of which there ought to be a proportionate surplus,\napplicable to the progressive reduction of the infidel tribes\ninhabiting the uplands, as well as the preaching of the Gospel\nin China and Cochinchina, most assuredly, it would be expedient\nto assemble and keep together a body of no less than seven hundred\npersons, if it is the wish of the government, on a tolerable scale, to\nprovide for the wants of these remote missions. At the present moment\nthe number does not exceed three hundred, including superannuated,\nexempt from service, and lay-brothers, whilst the native clergymen\nin effective possession of curacies, and including substitutes,\ncoadjutors and weekly preachers, exceed one thousand. And as the\nlatter, in general unworthy of the priesthood, are rather injurious\nthan really serviceable to the state, it should not be deemed unjust\nif they were altogether deprived of the dignity of parish curates,\nand only allowed to exercise their functions in necessary cases, or by\nattaching them to the curacies in the quality of coadjutors. By this\nplan, at the same time that the towns would be provided with suitable\nand adequate ministers, the native clergymen would be distributed\nin a proper manner and placed near the religious persons charged\nto officiate, would acquire the necessary knowledge and decorum,\nand in the course of time might obtain character and respect among\ntheir countrymen.",
        "To many, a measure of this kind may, in some respects, appear harsh\nand arbitrary; but persons, practically acquainted with the subject\nand country, will deem it indispensable, and the only means that\ncan be resorted to, in order to stop the rapid decline remarkable in\nthis interesting department of public administration. Fortunately,\nno grounded objections can be alleged against it; nor is there any\ndanger of serious consequences resulting from the plan being carried\ninto effect. In vain would it be to argue that, if the reform is to\ntake place, a large number of priests would be reduced to beggary,\nowing to the want of occupation; because, as things now stand, many of\nthe religious curates employ three or four coadjutors, and, no doubt,\nthey would then gladly undertake to make provision for the remainder\nof those who may be thrown out of employment. On the other hand, with\nequal truth it may be observed that the inhabitants of the interior,\nfar from regretting, or taking part on behalf of the native clergy,\nwould celebrate, as a day of gladness and rejoicing, the removal of\nthe latter, in return for their beloved Castilian Fathers.",
        "[Restriction of native ordinations recommended.] In case the ideas\nabove suggested should be adopted in all their parts, it may be proper\nto add that an injunction ought to be laid on the reverend bishops\nin future to confer holy orders with more scrupulosity and economy,\nthan, unfortunately, heretofore has been the case; by representing to\nthem that, if, at certain periods the Popes have been influenced by\npowerful reasons not to insist on ordinations taking place in Europe,\nas was formerly the case, very weighty motives now equally urge the\ngovernment to decline, in the Philippine Islands, paying so much to\nreligious vocation, and to relax in the policy of raising the natives\nto the dignity of the priesthood.",
        "[Moro depredations.] Long have the inhabitants of the Philippines\ndeplored, and in vain remonstrated, against the ravages committed\non their coasts and settlements by the barbarous natives of the\nIslands of Mindanao, Basilan and Jolo, as well as by the Malanos,\nIlanos and Tirone Moros and others; and there is nothing that so much\ndeserves the attention, and interests the honor of the Captain-General\ncommanding in this quarter, as an early and efficient attempt to check\nand punish these cruel enemies. It is indeed true that, in the years\n1636 and 1638, General Don Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera, undertook in\nperson and happily carried into effect the reduction of the Sultan of\nMindanao and the conquest of the Island of Jolo, placing in the latter\na governor and establishing three military posts there; under the\nprotection of the garrisons of which, Christianity was considerably\nextended. It is equally true, that on the subsequent abandonment of\nthis important acquisition, owing to the government being compelled to\nattend to other urgent matters, the enemy acquired a greater degree of\naudacity, and the captain-general in command afterwards sent armaments\nto check his inroads. On one of these occasions, our troops obliged an\narmy of more than 5,000 Moros, who had closely beset the fortress of\nZamboanga, to raise the siege; and also in the years 1731 and 1734,\nfresh detachments of our men were landed on the Islands of Jolo,\nCapul and Basilan, and their success was followed by the destruction\nand ruin of the fortified posts, vessels, and settlements of those\nperfidious Mahometans. It is not, however, less certain that at the\nperiods above mentioned, the war was carried on rather from motives\nof punishment and revenge, and suggested by a sudden and passing zeal,\nthan in conformity to any progressive and well-combined system. Since\nthen these laudable military enterprises have been entirely neglected,\nas well on account of the indolence of some of the governors, as\nthe too great confidence placed in the protestations of friendship\nand treaties of peace with which, from time to time, the Sultans\nof Jolo and Mindanao have sought to lull them to sleep. Their want\nof sincerity is proved by the circumstance of the piracies of their\nrespective subjects not ceasing, the chiefs sometimes feigning they\nwere carried on without their license or knowledge; and, at others,\nexcusing themselves on the plea of their inability to restrain the\ninsolence of the Tirones and other independent tribes. Nevertheless,\nit is notorious that the above-mentioned sultans indirectly encouraged\nthe practice of privateering, by affording every aid in their power\nto those who fitted out vessels, and purchasing from the pirates all\nthe Christians they captured and brought to them.",
        "[A missionary’s appeal.] Father Juan Angeles, superior of the mission\nestablished in Jolo, at the request of Sultan Alimudin himself (or\nFerdinand I as he was afterwards unworthily called on being made a\nChristian with no other view than the better to gain the confidence\nof the Spaniards) in a report he sent to the government from the\nabove Island, under date of September 24, 1748, describing the\nSultan’s singular artifices to amuse him and frustrate the object\nof his mission, fully confirms all that has just been said, and,\non closing his report, makes use of the following remarkable words:",
        "“When is it we shall have had enough of treaties with these Moros, for\nhave we not before us the experience of more than one hundred years,\nduring which period of time, they have not kept a single article\nin any way burdensome to, or binding on, themselves? They will never\nobserve the conditions of peace, because their property consists in the\npossession of slaves, and with them they traffic, the same as other\nnations do with money. Sooner will the hawk release his prey from\nhis talons than they will put an end to their piracies. The cause of\ntheir being still unfaithful to Spain arises out of this matter having\nbeen taken up by fits and starts, and not in the serious manner it\nought to have been done. To make war on them, in an effectual manner,\nfleets must not be employed, but they must be attacked on land, and\nin their posts in the interior; for it is much more advisable at once\nto spend ten with advantage and in a strenuous manner to attain an\nimportant object than to lay out twenty by degrees and without fruit.”",
        "[Governmental lenience.] It is an undeniable fact that the government,\nlulled and deceived by the frequent embassies and submissive and\ncrouching letters which those fawning sultans have been in the habit\nof transmitting to them, instead of adopting the energetic measures\nurged by the above-mentioned missionary, have constantly endeavored\nto renew and secure the friendship of those chiefs, by means of\ntreaties and commercial relations; granting, with this view, ample\nlicenses to every one who ventured to ship merchandise to Jolo, and\nwinking at the traffic carried on by the governors of the fortress of\nZamboanga with the people of Mindanao; whilst the latter, on their\npart, sporting with our foolish credulity, have never ceased waging\na most destructive war against us, by attacking our towns situated\non the coast, not even excepting those of the Island of Luzon. They\nhave sometimes carried their audacity so far as to show themselves\nin the neighborhood of the capital itself, and at others taken up\ntheir temporary residence in the district of Mindoro and in places\nof the jurisdictions of Samar and Leyte; and in short, even dared\nto form an establishment or general deposit for their plunder in the\nIsland of Buras, where they quietly remained during the years 1797,\n1798 and 1799 to the great injury of our commerce and settlements.",
        "[Authority for war not lacking.] This want of exertion to remedy evils\nof so grievous a nature is the more to be deplored as the Philippine\ngovernors have at all times been fully authorized to carry on war,\nand promote the destruction of the Moros, under every sacrifice, and\nespecially by the royal orders and decrees of October 26, and November\n1, 1758, and July 31, 1766, in all of which his majesty recommends,\nin the most earnest manner, “the importance of punishing the audacity\nof the barbarous infidels, his majesty being desirous that, in order\nto maintain his subjects of the Philippines free from the piracies and\ncaptivity they so frequently experience, no expenses or pains should\nbe spared; it being further declared, that as this is an object deeply\naffecting the conscience of his majesty, he especially enjoins the\naforesaid government to observe his order; and finally, with a view\nto provide for the exigencies arising out of similar enterprises,\nthe viceroy of New Spain is instructed to attend to the punctual\nremittance, not only of the usual “situado,” or annual allowance,\nbut also of the additional sum of $70,000 in the first and succeeding\nyears, etc.” In a word, our monarchs, Ferdinand VI and Carlos III,\nomitted nothing that could in any way promote so important an object;\nwhether it is that the governors have disregarded such repeated orders\nfrom the sovereigns, or mistaken the means by which they were to be\ncarried into effect, certain it is that the unhappy inhabitants of\nthe Philippines have continued to be witnesses, and at the same time\nthe victims of the culpable apathy of those who have successively\nheld the command of these Islands within the last fifty or sixty years.",
        "[Native efforts for self-defence.] Abandoned therefore to their own\nresouces, and from time to time relieved by the presence of a few\ngunboats which, after scouring the coasts, have never been able\nto come up with the light and fast sailing vessels of the enemy,\nthe inhabitants of our towns and settlements have been under the\nnecessity of intrenching and fortifying themselves in the best way\nthey were able, by opening ditches and planting a breastwork of stakes\nand palisades, crowned with watch towers, or a wooden or stone castle;\nprecautions which sometimes are not sufficient against the nocturnal\nirruptions and robberies of the Moros, more especially when they come\nwith any strength and fire-arms, in general scarce among the natives.",
        "[Moro piratical craft.] The pancos, or prows, used by the Moros, are\nlight and simple vessels, built with numerous thin planks and ribs,\nwith a small draft of water; and being manned by dexterous rowers,\nthey appear and disappear from the horizon with equal celerity, flying\nor attacking, whenever they can do it with evident advantage. Some\nof those vessels are large, and fitted out with fifty, a hundred,\nand sometimes two hundred men. The shots of their scanty and defective\nartillery are very uncertain, because they generally carry their guns\nsuspended in slings; but they are to be dreaded, and are extremely\ndexterous in the management of the campilan, or sword, of which they\nwear the blades long and well tempered. When they have any attack\nof importance in view, they generally assemble to the number of\ntwo hundred galleys, or more, and even in their ordinary cruises,\na considerable number navigate together. As dread and the scarcity\nof inhabitants in the Bisayan Islands cause great ranges of the coast\nto be left unsettled, it is very easy for the Moros to find numerous\nlurking-places and strongholds whenever they are pressed, and their\nconstant practice, in these cases, is to enter the rivers, ground\ntheir vessels, and hide them among the mangroves and thick foliage,\nand fly with their arms to the mountains, thus almost always laughing\nat the efforts of their opponents, who seldom venture to follow them\ninto the thickets and morasses, where the musket is of no use and a\nsingle step cannot be taken with any security.",
        "[Outrages suffered.] The fatal consequences and ravages of this system\nof cruising and warfare round the Islands are incalculable. Besides\nplundering and burning the towns and settlements, these bloody\npirates put the old and helpless to the sword, destroy the cattle\nand plantations, and annually carry off to their own homes as many as\na thousand captives of both sexes, who, if they are poor and without\nhopes of being redeemed, are destined to drag out a miserable existence\namidst the most fatiguing and painful labor, sometimes accompanied\nwith torments. Such is the dread and apprehension of these seas that\nonly those navigate and carry on trade in them who are able to arm and\nman their vessels in a way corresponding to the great risks they have\nto run, or others whom want compels to disregard the imminent dangers\nwhich await them. Among the latter class, the Bisayans, or “painted\n(tattooed) natives,” are distinguished, an extremely warlike people of\nwhom great use might be made. Reared from their infancy amidst danger\nand battle, and greatly resembling the Moros in their features and\ndarkness of skin, they are equally alike in the agility with which\nthey manage the long sword and lance, and such is the courage and\nimplacable odium with which they treat their enemies that, if not taken\nby surprise, they sell their lives very dear, sacrificing themselves\nin a most heroic manner, rather than to be led away as captives.",
        "In order, however, that a more correct idea may be formed of the\nwicked policy and atrocious disposition of these Moros, and with a\nview to do away with the misconceptions of those who are of opinion\nthat incentives to trade, and other slow and indirect means ought\nto be employed for the purpose of overcoming them, it will suffice\nto quote the following examples among a number of others, even more\nrecent ones, which might equally be brought forward.",
        "[Instances of treachery.] In 1796, the governor of Zamboanga\ndispatched, with regular passports and under a safe conduct obtained\nfrom the Sultan of Mindanao, Lieutenant Don Pantaleon Arcillas,\nwith a sergeant, eight men, and a guide, in order to bring into\nthe fortress the cattle belonging to the king’s farm, which had\nstrayed away and got up in the lands of the above-mentioned Mahometan\nprince. Five days after their departure, whilst the lieutenant was\ntaking his meals at the house of a “Datu,” or chief, named Oroncaya,\nhe was suddenly surrounded by seventy Moros, who, seizing upon him,\nbound him to a tree and then flayed him alive, from the forehead to\nthe ankle. In this miserable and defenceless situation, the barbarous\n“Datu” wreaked his vengeance on his body by piercing it all over\nwith his “kris,” or dagger, and then ordered his skin to be hung up\non the pole of one of his ferocious banners.",
        "In the year 1798, whilst the schooner San José lay at anchor at\nTabitabi, near Jolo, the sons-in-law and nephews of the sultan went\nout to meet her in two large prows, exhibiting at the same time every\ndemonstration of peace, and, sending forward a small vessel with\nrefreshments, they invited the captain to come on board of them. The\nlatter, deceived by the apparent frankness and high rank of the Moros,\nwith the greatest good faith accepted the invitation, and proceeded on\nboard, accompanied by two sailors, with a view to make arrangements\nfor barter. Scarcely had they got on board of the large prow, when\nthey were surrounded and seized, and the captain, who was a Spaniard,\ncompelled to sign an order to his mate to deliver up the schooner,\nwhich he reluctantly did, under the hope of saving his own and his\ncompanions’ lives. The Moros proceeded on board the Spanish vessel,\nand, in the meantime, the two sailors were taken back to the boat,\nand there killed with daggers in the presence of all. The schooner’s\nsails were next hoisted, and she was brought into Jolo, where the cargo\nand crew were sold in sight of, and with the knowledge and consent of\nthe sultan; an atrocity for which he has always refused to give any\nsatisfaction to a nation, thus openly and barbarously outraged by his\nown relatives, and in defiance of the existing treaties of peace. Such\nis the cruel character, and such the execrable policy of the Moros\ngenerally inhabiting the Islands situated in the Philippine seas.",
        "[Growth of Moro power.] The most lamentable circumstance is, that\nthese infidel races, at all times to be dreaded, owing to their\nnumbers and savage ferocity, after the lapse of a century of almost\nuninterrupted prosperity, and encouraged also by our inattention,\nhave at length gradually attained so formidable a degree of power,\nthat their reduction now must be considered an extremely arduous and\nexpensive enterprise, although an object urgently requisite, and worthy\nof the greatness of a nation like ours. In order, however, that the\ndifficulties of so important an undertaking may be justly appreciated,\nit may be proper to observe that the Island of Mindanao alone, at\nthe present moment, contains a population equal, if not larger, than\nthat of Luzon, and the margins of the immense lake, situated in its\ncenter, are covered with well-built towns, filled with conveniences,\nthe fruits of their annual privateering, and of the traffic they\ncarry on with the inhabitants of the Island of Jolo. True it is,\nand it may be said, equally fortunate, that they are greatly divided\ninto parties, subject to a variety of “datus,” or independent chiefs,\nin name only inferior to the one who styles himself the sultan of the\nwhole Island. As, however, the fortresses and districts of Caraga,\nMisamis, and Zamboanga occupy nearly three parts of the circumference\nof the Island, these Moros freely possess no more than the southern\npart, commencing at about twenty-five leagues from Cape San Augustin,\nand ending in the vicinity of Zamboanga; so that the largest number\nof their naval armaments are fitted out and issued to sea, either by\nthe great river of Mindanao, or from some of the many bays and inlets\nsituated on the above extent of coast.",
        "[Jolo.] The Island of Jolo, although small compared with that of\nMindanao, is, nevertheless, in itself the most important, as well\nas the real hotbed of all the piracies committed. Its inhabitants,\naccording to the unanimous reports of captives and various merchants,\nin skill and valor greatly exceed the other Mahometans who infest\nthese seas. The sultan is absolute, and his subjects carry on trade\nwith Borneo, Celebes, and the other Malayan tribes scattered about\nthis great Archipelago. In the port of Jolo, as already noticed,\nsales are made of Christians captured by the other Moros. The Chinese\nof Amoy, as well as the Dutch and British, carry them manufactured\ngoods, opium and arms, receiving, in return, black pepper, bees’\nwax, balato, edible nests, tortoise-shell, mother-of-pearl, gold\ndust, pearls, etc., and from Manila also a vessel usually goes once\na year with goods; but all act with the greatest precaution in this\ndangerous traffic, guarding, as much as possible, against the insidious\nacts of that perfidious government. The great number of renegades,\nof all casts, who have successively naturalized themselves there;\nthe abundance of arms, and the prevailing opulence, have, in every\nrespect, contributed to render this Island a formidable and powerful\nstate. The capital is surrounded with forts and thick walls, and\nthe famous heights, standing near it, in case of emergency, afford a\nsecure asylum where the women can take refuge and the treasures of\nthe sultan and public be deposited, whilst in the plains below the\ncontest may be maintained by more than 50,000 combatants, already\nvery dexterous in the use of the musket and of a bold and courageous\ncharacter. The navy of these Islanders is also very respectable,\nfor, besides a great number of smaller prows and war-boats, they\nhave some of a large size, capable of carrying heavy artillery on\ntheir decks, mounted on corresponding carriages, and not suspended\nin slings as is the custom of the people of Mindanao. In a word,\nJolo is an Island governed by a system of administration extremely\nvigorous and decisive; dread and superstition sustain the throne of\nthe tyrant, and the fame of his greatness frequently brings to his\nfeet the ulemas, or missionaries of the Koran, even as far as from\nthe furthest margin of the Red Sea. The prince and people, unanimous\nin the implacable odium with which they view all Christians, cannot\nbe divided or kept on terms of peace; and if it is really wished to\nfree these seas from the evils and great dangers with which they are\nat all times threatened, it is necessary at once to strike at the\nroot, by landing and attacking the Jolonese in their strongholds,\nand break the charm by which they are held together.",
        "This, at least, is the constant and unshaken opinion of all\nexperienced persons and those versed in Philippine affairs; and if,\nby the substantial reasons and existing circumstances, I convince\nmyself sufficiently to openly recommend war to be undertaken against\nthe Moros and pushed with the utmost vigor, and more particularly\ncommencing the work by a formal invasion of Jolo; still, as I feel\nmyself incompetent to trace a precise plan, or to discuss the minute\ndetails more immediately connected with the object, I feel it necessary\nto confine myself to the pointing out, in general terms, of the means\nI judge most conducive to the happy issue of so arduous but important\nan enterprise, leaving the rest to more able and experienced hands.",
        "[Council of war recommended.] As a previous step, I conceive that\na council of war ought to be formed in Manila, composed of the\ncaptain-general, the commanders of the navy, artillery, and engineer\ndepartment, as well as of the regular corps, who, in conformity to\nall the antecedent information lodged in the secretary’s office for\nthe captain-generalship, and the previous report of some one of the\nex-governors of Zamboanga and the best informed missionaries, may be\nenabled to deliberate and proceed on to a mature examination of the\nwhole affair, taking into their special consideration everything\nregarding Jolo, its early reduction, the number of vessels and\nmen required for this purpose, the most advantageous points of\nattack, and the best season in which this can be carried into\nexecution. After all these matters have been determined upon, the\noperation in question ought to be connected with the other partial\nand general arrangements of the government, in order that a plan the\nbest adapted to localities and existing circumstances may be chosen,\nand without its being necessary to wait for the king’s approbation\nof the means resolved upon, owing to the distance of the court and\nthe necessity of acting with celerity. If, however, on account of\nthe deference in every respect due to the sovereign, it should be\nthought proper to reconcile his previous sanction with the necessity\nof acting without loss of time, the best mode would be to send from\nSpain an officer of high rank, fully authorized, who, as practised\non other occasions, might give his sanction, in the name of the king,\nto the resolutions adopted by the council of war, and take under his\nown immediate charge, if it should be so deemed expedient, the command\nof the expedition against Jolo, receiving the appointment of governor\nof the Island, as soon as the conquest should be carried into effect,\nas a just reward for his zeal and valor.",
        "[War popular in Philippines.] Supposing an uniformity of opinions to\nprevail with regard to the expediency of attempting the subjugation\nof Jolo, and supposing also the existence of the necessary funds to\nmeet the expenses of a corresponding armament, it may be positively\nrelied upon that the project would be extremely popular, and meet\nwith the entire concurrence and support of the Philippine Islands. The\nmilitary men, aware of the great riches known to exist in the proposed\ntheatre of operations, would emulously come forward to offer their\nservices, under a hope of sharing the booty, and the warlike natives\nof the Bisayas would be impelled on by their hatred to the Moros,\nand their ardent wishes to avenge the blood of their fathers and\nchildren. On the other hand, the abundance of regular and well\ndisciplined officers and troops, at present in the colony and the\nnumber of gun-boats found in the ports, a want of which, on other\noccasions, has always been experienced, will afford ample scope for\nthe equipment of a force competent to the important enterprise in\nview. In fact, if the operation is arranged in a systematic manner,\nand all the precautions and rules observed as are usual in cases of\nattacks premeditated against European and civilized establishments,\nthere is no reason to expect any other than a flattering and decisive\nresult, since, in reality, the whole would be directed against an\nenemy contemptible on account of his barbarism and his comparative\nignorance of the art of war.",
        "[Native assistance.] The preparations deemed necessary being made in\nManila, and the Bisayan auxiliaries assembled beforehand in Zamboanga,\nwith their arms and respective chiefs, the whole of the operation\nin question, it may be safely said, might be terminated within the\nperiod of three or four months. Supposing even 2,000 regular troops\nare destined for this expedition, with a corresponding train of field\npieces, and at the moment there should not be found in the Islands a\nsufficient number of larger vessels to embargo or freight for their\nconveyance, a competent quantity of coasters, galleys and small craft\nmight be met with at any time sufficiently capacious and secure to\ncarry the men. This substitute will be found the less inconvenient,\nbecause, as the navigation is to be performed among the Islands during\nthe prevalence of the north winds, usually a favorable and steady\nseason of the year, the voyage will consequently be safe and easy. It\nwill also be possible to arrive at the point agreed upon, as a general\nrendezvous, in twenty, or five-and-twenty days, which place, for many\nreasons, ought to be the fortress of Zamboanga, situated in front of\nJolo and at moderate distance from that Island; it being from this port\nthat, in former times, the Philippine governors usually sent out their\narmaments, destined to make war against the Basilanese and Jolonese.",
        "[Mindanao also needs attention.] As soon as this important and\nmemorable enterprise has been carried into effect, and the punishment\nand total subjugation of these faithless Mahometans completed and\nthe new conquest placed under a military authority, in the mean\ntime that the lands are distributing and arrangements making to\nestablish the civil administration, on the same plan followed in the\nother provinces of the Philippine government, the armament ought to\nreturn to Zamboanga with all possible speed; but, after stopping by\nthe way to reduce the small island of Basilan and leaving a fortress\nand garrison there. Immediately afterwards, and before the various\ntribes of Moros inhabiting the Island of Mindanao have been able to\nconcert among themselves and prepare for their defence, it would\nbe advisable to direct partial expeditions towards both flanks of\nZamboanga, for the purpose of burning the settlements of the natives\nand driving them from the shores into the interior. Forts ought then\nto be raised at the mouths of the inlets and rivers, and a fourth\ndistrict government formed in the southern part of the island; in such\nmanner that, by possession being taken of the coasts, the government\nand district of Zamboanga may be placed in contact with the new\none established on the one side, and on the other with the district\nof Misamis, also the new district with that of Caraga, the western\npart of which territory is already united to that of Misamis. Such,\nat least, was the opinion of Lieutenant-Colonel Don Mariano Tobias,\nan officer deservedly celebrated for his prudence and consummate skill\nin these matters, and this he substantially expressed in a council\nof war, held on August 28, 1778, for the purpose of deliberating on\nthe most advisable means to check the Moros, as appears by a long\nand intelligent report drawn upon this subject on April 26, 1800,\nby the adjutant-general of this colony, Don Rufino Suarez.",
        "In case it should be determined to adopt the means proposed by Colonel\nTobias, for the purpose of holding the Moros of Mindanao in check,\nand to which, unfortunately, due regard has not hitherto been paid,\nnotwithstanding the enterprise presents very few difficulties, owing\nto the little opposition to be expected from the infidel natives,\nthe latter would then be left completely surrounded and shut up in\nthe heart of the island, and their active system of privateering,\nwith which they have so many years infested these seas, entirely\ndestroyed. If, through the want of garrisons and population, it should\nnot, however, be possible to deprive them of all their outlets, by\nwhich means they would still be able occasionally to send some of\ntheir cruising vessels, nevertheless there would be facilities with\nwhich it would be possible to pursue and counteract the ravages of\nthe few pirates who might furtively escape out of some river, while\nnow they are fitted out, and well manned and armed to the number of\none and two hundred war-boats, openly in their ports.",
        "[A plan for future policing.] After the emporiums of slavery have\nbeen destroyed by the conquest of Jolo, and the other general\nmeasures adopted, as above pointed out, the government would then\nbe in a situation to turn its attention, with much greater ease,\nto the arrangement of all the other minor schemes of precaution and\nprotection suited to the difference of circumstances and locality,\nwithout the concurrence of which the work would be left imperfect,\nand in some degree the existence of those settled in the new\nestablishments rendered precarious. As, however, I am unprepared\nminutely to point out the nature of these measures, or distinctly\nto lay down a ground-work for future civilization and improvement,\nI shall merely observe, that what would then remain to be done would\nneither require any great capital, or present obstacles which might\nnot easily be overcome. The Moros being then concentrated in the\nIsland of Mindanao, and this completely surrounded on all sides by our\nforts and settlements, in the manner above described, the only enemies\nlet loose on these seas would be either the few who might, from time\nto time, elude the vigilance of our troops and district-commanders,\nor those who might have escaped from Jolo previous to its conquest,\nand taken up their abode in one or other of the Bisayas Islands; or,\nin short, such as are out cruising at the time our armament returns\nto Zamboanga and takes possession of the southern coast of Mindanao;\nin which case they would be compelled to resort to a roving life,\nestablishing, like the Jolo fugitives, temporary dwellings among the\nmangroves and thickets bordering on the shore.",
        "The principal objects then remaining for the attention of government\nwould be to guard and protect the towns and settlements established\non the coasts from the insults and inroads of banditti, impelled by\nnecessity or despair, and at the same time to promote the gradual\noverthrow or civilization of the dispersed remnant of Moorish\npopulation left in the Island. The cruising of the pirates being\nthus reduced to a space comprehended in an oblong circle formed by\nan imaginary line drawn from the southern extreme of the Island of\nLeyte, to the south-west point of Samar, which next running along\nthe north-west coast of Mindoro, on the outside of Tacao and Burias,\nand coming down to the west of Panay, Negros and Bohol, closes the\noval at the little island formed by the Strait of Panaon, about forty\ngunboats might be advantageously stationed in the narrowest passages\nfrom land to land; as, for example, in the Strait of San Juanico and\nother passes of a similar kind, well known to the local pilots. By this\nmeans, the limits would be gradually contracted. Various small naval\narmaments ought, at the same time, to keep cruising in the center\nof this circle, pursuing the Moros by sea and land, dislodging them\nfrom their strongholds and lurking places, and sending on those who\nmight be captured to the depot pointed out by government.",
        "[Feasibility of plans.] The first part of the plan would be the\nmore easily realized, as it is well-known that most of the districts\ncorresponding to the Bisayan tribes, including those of Camarines and\nAlbay, situated at the extremity of the island of Luzon, have several\ngunboats of their own, which might be used with great advantage. By\nmerely advancing and stationing them in such channels as the Moros\nmust necessarily pass, either in going out or returning, according to\nthe different monsoons, they would easily be checked, without removing\nthe gunboats to any great distance from their own coasts. As besides\nthe great advantages resulting from this plan and every one doing\nhis duty are apparent, no doubt numbers of natives would volunteer\ntheir services, more particularly if they were liberally rewarded,\nand their maintenance provided from the funds of the respective\ncommunities. Moreover, the points which at first should not be\nconsidered as sufficiently guarded might be strengthened by the king’s\ngunboats, and, indeed, in all of them it would be advisable to station\nsome of the latter, commanded by a select officer, to whose orders\nthe captains of the provincial gunboats ought to be made subservient.",
        "With regard to the second part, it will suffice to observe that the\ncaptain-generalship of the Philippine Islands already possesses as\nmany as seventy gunboats, besides a considerable number of gallies\nand launches, which altogether constitute a formidable squadron\nof light vessels; and, after deducting those deemed necessary for\nthe protection of Jolo and the new province to be established in\nMindanao, a sufficient number would still be left to carry into\nexecution all the objects proposed. At present, although the Moros\nnavigate in numerous divions, and with a confidence inspired by their\nundisturbed prosperity, a 24-pounder shot from one of our launches is\nnevertheless sufficient to put them to flight; what therefore may not\nbe expected when their forces shall be so greatly diminished and their\napprehensions increased, of being defeated and captured? Nevertheless,\nas it is not easy for our gunboats to come up with them, when giving\nchase, it would be advisable to add to our cruisers a temporary\nestablishment of prows and light vessels, manned by Bisayan Indians,\nwhich, by advancing on with the gallies, might attack the enemy and\ngive time for the gunboats to come up and decide the action. Besides as\nthe Bisayan Indians are perfectly acquainted with the mode of making\nwar on the Moros, the meaning of their signals and manoeuvers and\nthe kind of places on shore in which they take shelter when pursued\nat sea, the employment of such auxiliaries would be extremely useful.",
        "[Need of undivided leadership.] The whole of these defensive and\noffensive arrangements would, however, be ineffectual or incomplete\nin their results, if the most perfect union and concert is not\nestablished in every part, so that all should conspire to the same\nobject, although by distinct means. In order therefore that the\nnecessary harmony may be secured, it would be expedient to remove the\nchief authority nearer to the theater of war, by confiding all the\nnecessary instructions and powers to the person who might be selected\nfor the direction and command of the enterprise, after the general\nplan of operations had been regularly approved. Under this impression,\nand with a view to the better execution of all the details, it would\nbe advisable for the commanding officer, named by the government,\nto take up his headquarters in the Island of Panay, which, owing to\nits geographical situation, the great number of towns and inhabitants\ncontained in the three provinces into which it is divided, as well\nas other political reasons, is generally esteemed preferable for the\nobject in question, to the Island of Zebu, where, in former times,\nthe commanders of the province of the painted natives resided,\nas mentioned in the laws of the Indies. The center of action being\nplaced in Iloilo, a communication with the other points would thus\nmore easily be kept open, aid and relief might be sent more rapidly\nto the quarter where required, and, in a word, all the movements,\nof whatsoever kind they might be, would be executed with greater\nprecision and certainty of success. It would be unnecessary to\nadd that the provincial magistrates of Camarines and Albay ought to\nco-operate, with their fourteen gunboats and other smaller vessels, in\nthe measures adopted by the commander of the Bisayan establishment,\ndistributing their forces according to the orders given by him,\nand by undertaking to guard the straits of San Bernardino.",
        "[Paragua.] The Island of Paragua, at the head of which the\nprovincial jurisdiction of Calamianes is placed, is not included\nin the great circle, or chain of stations, above traced out, as\nwell in consequence of its great distance from the other islands,\nfor which reason it is not so much infested by the Moros, as because\nof its being at present nearly depopulated and uncultivated, and for\nthese reasons the attention of government ought not to be withdrawn\nfrom other more important points. With regard to that of Mindanao,\nthe necessity of keeping up along the whole of its immense coast, a\nline of castles and watch towers, has already been fully pointed out,\nmore especially in the vicinity of the bay of Panguil, to the north,\nand the mouths of the great river towards the south; the two points\nin which the enemies’ most formidable armaments are usually fitted\nout. Consequently, it would not be possible to expect the provincial\ncommanders stationed there would be able to disengage any part of\ntheir naval force, in order to place it at the disposal of the officer\ncommanding the Bisayan vessels. Indeed, it is obvious that it would be\nextremely important to afford the people of Mindanao every possible\nadditional aid, in vessels, troops and money, in order the better to\ncheck the sailing of partial divisions of the enemy, and thus prevent\nthe immense number of pirates, inhabiting the interior of the island,\nfrom breaking the fortified line, and again covering these seas, and\nwith redoubled fury carrying death and desolation along all the coasts.",
        "It would, in fact, be extremely desirable if, through the concerted\nmeasures and constant vigilance of the four chief magistrates\nintrusted with the command of the island, the future attempts of\nthe Mindanayans could be entirely counteracted, and their cruisers\naltogether kept within the line for a certain period of years; as by\nthus depriving them of the facilities to continue their old habits\nof life, these barbarous tribes would be eventually compelled to\nadopt other pursuits, either by ascending the mountainous parts of\nthe island, and shutting themselves up in the thick and impenetrable\nforests, with a view to preserve their independence; or, throwing\ndown their arms and devoting themselves to the peaceful cultivation\nof their lands. In the latter case, they would gradually lose their\npresent ferocious character; their regard for the conveniences and\nrepose of social life would increase; the contrast would be attended\nwith most favorable consequences, and in the course of time, the whole\nof the aboriginal natives of these islands would come into our laws\nand customs, and become confounded in the general mass of Philippine\nsubjects, owing allegiance to the king.",
        "Finally, it must be equally acknowledged that the Islands of Jolo,\nBasilan, Capul, and some of the other inferior ones, of which,\nas above pointed out, an union ought to be formed in the way of an\nadditional government, subordinate to the captain-general, would be\nable to co-operate in the war on no other plan than the one traced\nout for the provinces held in Mindanao; that is, by their gunboats\nbeing confided to the protection of their own coasts; though with\nthis difference, that if, in one instance, the main object would be\nto prevent the evasion of the enemy, in the other every effort must\nbe employed to guard against and repel their incursions when they\ndo appear. However complete the success of the armament, destined\nfor the reduction of Jolo, it may nevertheless be presumed, that the\nmountains would still continue to give shelter to hordes of fugitives,\nwho would take refuge in the fastnesses, and avail themselves of every\nopportunity to concert plans, or fly off to join their comrades in\nMindanao, in order to return, and through their aid, satisfy their\nthirst for vengeance, by surprising some fortress or settlement,\nor establishing themselves on some neglected and not well known\npoint. In consequence of this, the governor, commanding there,\nwould at first require the active co-operation of all his forces,\nfor the purpose of consolidating the new conquest, and causing his\nauthority to be respected throughout the island.",
        "[Importance of peace for Philippine progress.] These, in my opinion,\nare the true and secure means by which the enemies of the peace\nand prosperity of the Philippines may be humbled, their piracies\nprevented, and a basis laid for the future civilization of the\nremaining islands in this important Archipelago. To this sketch,\na number of other details and essential illustrations, no doubt,\nare wanting; and possibly, I may be accused of some inaccuracies, in\ndiscussing a topic, with which I candidly avow I cannot be considered\naltogether familiar. The plan and success of the enterprise must,\nhowever, greatly depend on military skill and talent; but as I have\nattempted no more than fairly to trace the general outline of the\nplan, and insist on the necessity of its adoption, my remarks, it\nis to be hoped, will serve to awaken a serious disposition to review\nand investigate the whole subject, a task that most assuredly ought\nto be confided to a competent and special council. Whatever defects\nI may involuntarily have fallen into, will then be corrected; at the\nsame time it ought not to appear strange that inexperienced persons\nshould presume to speak on matters connected with the public good,\nwhen we see them so much neglected by those whose more immediate duty\nit is to look after and promote them. At all events, dispassionate\nzeal has seldom done harm; and I again repeat, that my wish is not\nso much to see my own ideas adopted, as to urge the necessity of\ntheir being examined and digested. I am desirous that other sources\nof information on this subject should be explored, that practical men\nshould be called in, and that those in power should be induced to apply\nthemselves and devote their exertions to an object so highly deserving\nof their attention. In short, I am anxious that the pious injunctions\nof our monarchs should be fulfilled, and that the tears and blood of\nthe inhabitants of these neglected islands should cease to flow.",
        "Should the happy day ever arrive, when the inhabitants of these\nprovinces shall behold themselves free from the cruel scourge with\nwhich they have been desolated for so many years, they will bless the\nnation that has redeemed them from all their cares, they will tighten\ntheir relations with it, and deliver themselves up to its direction\nwithout reserve. The natives will then come down from the strong\nfastnesses they at present inhabit; they will clear fresh lands, and\nearnestly devote themselves to tillage and industry. Under the shadow\nof peace, population and commerce will increase; the Bisayan vessels\nwill then plough the ocean without the dread of other enemies than\nthe elements; and the Moros themselves of Mindanao (I say it with\nconfidence), straightened on all sides, and incessantly harassed\nby the Christians, but on the other hand witnessing the advantages\nand mildness of our laws, will at length submit to the dominion of\nthe monarchs of Spain, who will thus secure the quiet possession of\none of the most interesting portions of the habitable globe, and be\njustly entitled to the gratitude of all nations connected with China\nand India, for having put an end to a series of the most terrific\nplunder and captivity that ever disgraced the annals of any age.",
