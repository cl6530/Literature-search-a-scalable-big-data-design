        "  An encounter between the Baron’s nose and a door-post, with its\n  wonderful effects–Fifty brace of ducks and other fowl destroyed\n  by one shot–Flogs a fox out of his skin–Leads an old sow home in\n  a new way, and vanquishes a wild boar.",
        "It was some time before I could obtain a commission in the army, and\nfor several months I was perfectly at liberty to sport away my time\nand money in the most gentleman-like manner. You may easily imagine\nthat I spent much of both out of town with such gallant fellows as\nknew how to make the most of an open forest country. The very\nrecollection of those amusements gives me fresh spirits, and creates a\nwarm wish for a repetition of them. One morning I saw, through the\nwindows of my bed-room, that a large pond not far off was covered with\nwild ducks. In an instant I took my gun from the corner, ran down-\nstairs and out of the house in such a hurry, that I imprudently struck\nmy face against the door-post. Fire flew out of my eyes, but it did\nnot prevent my intention; I soon came within shot, when, levelling my\npiece, I observed to my sorrow, that even the flint had sprung from\nthe cock by the violence of the shock I had just received. There was\nno time to be lost. I presently remembered the effect it had on my\neyes, therefore opened the pan, levelled my piece against the wild\nfowls, and my fist against one of my eyes. [The Baron’s eyes have\nretained fire ever since, and appear particularly illuminated when he\nrelates this anecdote.] A hearty blow drew sparks again; the shot went\noff, and I killed fifty brace of ducks, twenty widgeons, and three\ncouple of teals. Presence of mind is the soul of manly exercises. If\nsoldiers and sailors owe to it many of their lucky escapes, hunters\nand sportsmen are not less beholden to it for many of their successes.\nIn a noble forest in Russia I met a fine black fox, whose valuable\nskin it would have been a pity to tear by ball or shot. Reynard stood\nclose to a tree. In a twinkling I took out my ball, and placed a good\nspike-nail in its room, fired, and hit him so cleverly that I nailed\nhis brush fast to the tree. I now went up to him, took out my hanger,\ngave him a cross-cut over the face, laid hold of my whip, and fairly\nflogged him out of his fine skin.",
        "Chance and good luck often correct our mistakes; of this I had a\nsingular instance soon after, when, in the depth of a forest, I saw a\nwild pig and sow running close behind each other. My ball had missed\nthem, yet the foremost pig only ran away, and the sow stood\nmotionless, as fixed to the ground. On examining into the matter, I\nfound the latter one to be an old sow, blind with age, which had taken\nhold of her pig’s tail, in order to be led along by filial duty. My\nball, having passed between the two, had cut his leading-string, which\nthe old sow continued to hold in her mouth; and as her former guide\ndid not draw her on any longer, she had stopped of course; I therefore\nlaid hold of the remaining end of the pig’s tail, and led the old\nbeast home without any further trouble on my part, and without any\nreluctance or apprehension on the part of the helpless old animal.",
        "Terrible as these wild sows are, yet more fierce and dangerous are the\nboars, one of which I had once the misfortune to meet in a forest,\nunprepared for attack or defence. I retired behind an oak-tree just\nwhen the furious animal levelled a side-blow at me, with such force,\nthat his tusks pierced through the tree, by which means he could\nneither repeat the blow nor retire. Ho, ho! thought I, I shall soon\nhave you now! and immediately I laid hold of a stone, wherewith I\nhammered and bent his tusks in such a manner, that he could not\nretreat by any means, and must wait my return from the next village,\nwhither I went for ropes and a cart, to secure him properly, and to\ncarry him off safe and alive, in which I perfectly succeeded.",
