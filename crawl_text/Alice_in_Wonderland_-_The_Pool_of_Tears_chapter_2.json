        "“Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was so much surprised,\nthat for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English). “Now\nI’m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-by,\nfeet!” (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost\nout of sight, they were getting so far off). “Oh, my poor little feet,\nI wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?\nI’m sure I shan’t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off\nto trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can—but\nI must be kind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk\nthe way I want to go! Let me see. I’ll give them a new pair of boots\nevery Christmas.”",
        "And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. “They\nmust go by the carrier,” she thought; “and how funny it’ll seem,\nsending presents to one’s own feet! And how odd the directions will\nlook!",
        "Oh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!”",
        "Just at this moment her head struck against the roof of the hall: in\nfact she was now rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took\nup the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.",
        "Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to\nlook through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more\nhopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.",
        "“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like\nyou” (she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way! Stop\nthis moment, I tell you!”",
        "But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there\nwas a large pool all round her, about four inches deep, and reaching\nhalf down the hall.",
        "After a time she heard a little pattering of feet. In the distance, and\nshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White\nRabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid-gloves\nin one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a\ngreat hurry, muttering to himself, as he came, “Oh! The Duchess, the\nDuchess! Oh! Won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!”",
        "",
        "Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one: so,\nwhen the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, “If\nyou please, Sir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white\nkid-gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard\nas he could go.",
        "Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she\nkept fanning herself all the time she went on talking. “Dear, dear!\nHow queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as\nusual. I wonder if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was\nI the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember\nfeeling a little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question\nis, ’Who in the world am I?’ Ah, that’s the great puzzle!”",
        "And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the\nsame age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of\nthem.",
        "“I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long\nringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t\nbe Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh, she knows such\na very little! Besides, she’s she, and I’m I, and—oh dear, how\npuzzling it all is! I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know.\nLet me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,\nand four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that\nrate! However, the Multiplication-Table doesn’t signify: let’s try\nGeography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of\nRome, and Rome—no, that’s all wrong, I’m certain! I must have been\nchanged for Mabel! I’ll try and say ’How doth the little—,’” and\nshe crossed her hands on her lap, as if she were saying lessons, and\nbegan to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the\nwords did not come the same as they used to do:—",
        "“I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice, and her\neyes filled with tears again as she went on, “I must be Mabel after\nall, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and\nhave next to no toys to play with, and oh, ever so many lessons to\nlearn! No, I’ve made up my mind about it: if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down\nhere! It’ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying, ’Come\nup again, dear!’ I shall only look up and say, ’Who am I, then? Tell\nme that first, and then, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if\nnot, I’ll stay down here till I am somebody else’—but, oh dear!\"\ncried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, “I do wish they would put\ntheir heads down! I am so very tired of being all alone here!”",
        "As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to\nsee that she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid-gloves\nwhile she was talking.",
        "“How can I have done that?” she thought. “I must be growing small\nagain.” She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and\nfound that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet\nhigh, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the\ncause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily,\njust in time to save herself from shrinking away altogether.",
        "“That was a narrow escape!” said Alice, a good deal frightened at\nthe sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence.\n“And now for the garden!” And she ran with all speed back to the\nlittle door; but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little\ngolden key was lying on the glass table as before, “and things are\nworse than ever,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so small as\nthis before, never! And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!”",
        "As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,\nsplash! she was up to her chin in salt-water.",
        "",
        "Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, “and in\nthat case I can go back by railway,” she said to herself. (Alice had\nbeen to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general\nconclusion that, wherever you go to on the English coast, you find a\nnumber of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the\nsand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging-houses, and behind them\na railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the\npool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.",
        "“I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about, trying\nto find her way out. “I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\nbeing drowned in my own tears! That will be a queer thing, to be\nsure! However, everything is queer to-day.”",
        "Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\noff, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\nit must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\nshe was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\nslipped in like herself.",
        "“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse?\nEverything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\nlikely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.” So she\nbegan: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired\nof swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the\nright way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing\nbefore, but she remembered having seen, in her brother’s Latin\nGrammar, “A mouse—of a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”)",
        "The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to\nwink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.",
        "“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice. “I dare say\nit’s a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.” (For with\nall her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long\nago anything had happened.)",
        "So she began again: “Où est ma chatte?” which was the first sentence\nin her French lesson-book.",
        "The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver\nall over with fright. “Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice hastily,\nafraid that she had hurt the poor animal’s feelings. “I quite forgot\nyou didn’t like cats.”",
        "“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse in a shrill, passionate voice. “Would\nyou like cats if you were me?”",
        "“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry\nabout it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah. I think you’d\ntake a fancy to cats, if you could only see her. She is such a dear\nquiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about\nin the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her\npaws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to\nnurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your\npardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all\nover, and she felt certain it must be really offended. “We won’t talk\nabout her any more, if you’d rather not.”",
        "“We, indeed!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of\nits tail. “As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always\nhated cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the name\nagain!”",
        "“I won’t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject\nof conversation. “Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse did\nnot answer, so Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a nice little\ndog, near our house, I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed\nterrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll\nfetch things when you throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its\ndinner, and all sorts of things—I can’t remember half of them—and it\nbelongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth\na hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats, and—oh dear!” cried\nAlice in a sorrowful tone, “I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!” For\nthe Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and\nmaking quite a commotion in the pool as it went.",
        "So she called softly after it, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\nwon’t talk about cats, or dogs either, if you don’t like them!” When\nthe Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its\nface was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said, in a\nlow trembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you\nmy history, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.”",
        "It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with\nthe birds and animals that had fallen into it: there was a Duck and a\nDodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures.",
        "Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.",
