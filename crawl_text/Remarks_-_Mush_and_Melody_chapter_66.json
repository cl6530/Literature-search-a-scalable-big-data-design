        "Lately I have been giving a good deal of attention to hygiene–in other\npeople. The gentle reader will notice that, as a rule, the man who gives\nthe most time and thought to this subject is an invalid himself; just as\nthe young theological student devotes his first sermon to the care of\nchildren, and the ward politician talks the smoothest on the subject of\nhow and when to plant ruta-bagas or wean a calf from the parent stem.",
        "Having been thrown into the society of physicians a great deal the past\ntwo years, mostly in the role of patient, I have given some study to the\nhuman form; its structure and idiosyncracies, as it were. Perhaps few men\nin the same length of time have successfully acquired a larger or more\nselect repertoire of choice diseases than I have. I do not say this\nboastfully. I simply desire to call the attention of our growing youth to\nthe glorious possibilities that await the ambitious and enterprising in\nthis line.",
        "Starting out as a poor boy, with few advantages in the way of disease, I\nhave resolutely carved my way up to the dizzy heights of fame as a chronic\ninvalid and drug-soaked relic of other days. I inherited no disease\nwhatever. My ancestors were poor and healthy. They bequeathed me no snug\nlittle nucleus of fashionable malaria such as other boys had. I was\nobliged to acquire it myself. Yet I was not discouraged. The results have\nshown that disease is not alone the heritage of the wealthy and the great.\nThe poorest of us may become eminent invalids if we will only go at it in\nthe right way. But I started out to say something on the subject of\nhealth, for there are still many common people who would rather be healthy\nand unknown than obtain distinction with some dazzling new disease.",
        "Noticing many years ago that imperfect mastication and dyspepsia walked\nhand in hand, so to speak, Mr. Gladstone adopted in his family a regular\nmastication scale; for instance, thirty-two bites for steak, twenty-two\nfor fish, and so forth. Now I take this idea and improve upon it. Two\nstatesmen can always act better in concert if they will do so.",
        "With Mr. Gladstone’s knowledge of the laws of health and my own musical\ngenius, I have hit on a way to make eating not only a duty, but a\npleasure. Eating is too frequently irksome. There is nothing about it to\nmake it attractive.",
        "What we need is a union of mush and melody, if I may be allowed that\nexpression. Mr. Gladstone has given us the graduated scale, so that we\nknow just what metre a bill of fare goes in as quick as we look at it. In\nthis way the day is not far distant when music and mastication will march\ndown through the dim vista of years together.",
        "The Baked Bean Chant, the Vermicelli Waltz, the Mush and Milk March, the\nsad and touchful Pumpkin Pie Refrain, the gay and rollicking Oxtail Soup\nGallop, and the melting Ice Cream Serenade will yet be common musical\nnames.",
        "Taking different classes of food, I have set them to music in such a way\nthat the meal, for instance, may open with a Soup Overture, to be followed\nby a Roast Beef March in C, and so on, closing with a kind of Mince Pie La\nSomnambula pianissimo in G. Space, of course, forbids an extended\ndescription of this idea as I propose to carry it out, but the conception\nis certainly grand. Let us picture the jaws of a whole family moving in\nexact time to a Strauss waltz on the silent remains of the late lamented\nhen, and we see at once how much real pleasure may be added to the process\nof mastication.",
