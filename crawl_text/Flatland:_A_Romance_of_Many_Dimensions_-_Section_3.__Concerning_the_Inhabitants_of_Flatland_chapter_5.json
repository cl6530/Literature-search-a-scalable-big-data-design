        "\nThe greatest length or breadth of a full grown inhabitant of Flatland\nmay be estimated at about eleven of your inches.  Twelve inches may be\nregarded as a maximum.",
        "Our Women are Straight Lines.",
        "Our Soldiers and Lowest Classes of Workmen are Triangles with two\nequal sides, each about eleven inches long, and a base or third side\nso short (often not exceeding half an inch) that they form\nat their vertices a very sharp and formidable angle.\nIndeed when their bases are of the most degraded type (not more than\nthe eighth part of an inch in size), they can hardly be distinguished\nfrom Straight Lines or Women; so extremely pointed are their vertices.\nWith us, as with you, these Triangles are distinguished from others\nby being called Isosceles; and by this name I shall refer to them\nin the following pages.",
        "Our Middle Class consists of Equilateral or Equal-Sided Triangles.",
        "Our Professional Men and Gentlemen are Squares (to which class\nI myself belong) and Five-Sided Figures or Pentagons.",
        "Next above these come the Nobility, of whom there are several degrees,\nbeginning at Six-Sided Figures, or Hexagons, and from thence rising\nin the number of their sides till they receive the honourable title\nof Polygonal, or many-sided.  Finally when the number of the sides\nbecomes so numerous, and the sides themselves so small,\nthat the figure cannot be distinguished from a circle,\nhe is included in the Circular or Priestly order; and this is\nthe highest class of all.",
        "It is a Law of Nature with us that a male child shall have\none more side than his father, so that each generation shall rise\n(as a rule) one step in the scale of development and nobility.\nThus the son of a Square is a Pentagon; the son of a Pentagon,\na Hexagon; and so on.",
        "But this rule applies not always to the Tradesmen, and still\nless often to the Soldiers, and to the Workmen; who indeed can hardly\nbe said to deserve the name of human Figures, since they have not\nall their sides equal.  With them therefore the Law of Nature\ndoes not hold; and the son of an Isosceles (i.e. a Triangle with\ntwo sides equal) remains Isosceles still.  Nevertheless,\nall hope is not shut out, even from the Isosceles, that his posterity\nmay ultimately rise above his degraded condition.  For, after a long\nseries of military successes, or diligent and skilful labours,\nit is generally found that the more intelligent among\nthe Artisan and Soldier classes manifest a slight increase\nof their third side or base, and a shrinkage of the two other sides.\nIntermarriages (arranged by the Priests) between the sons\nand daughters of these more intellectual members of the lower classes\ngenerally result in an offspring approximating still more to the type\nof the Equal-Sided Triangle.",
        "Rarely — in proportion to the vast numbers of Isosceles births —\nis a genuine and certifiable Equal-Sided Triangle produced\nfrom Isosceles parents.  [Note:  “What need of a certificate?\"\na Spaceland critic may ask:  “Is not the procreation of a Square Son\na certificate from Nature herself, proving the Equal-sidedness\nof the Father?”  I reply that no Lady of any position will marry\nan uncertified Triangle.  Square offspring has sometimes resulted\nfrom a slightly Irregular Triangle; but in almost every such case\nthe Irregularity of the first generation is visited on the third;\nwhich either fails to attain the Pentagonal rank, or relapses to\nthe Triangular.]  Such a birth requires, as its antecedents,\nnot only a series of carefully arranged intermarriages,\nbut also a long, continued exercise of frugality and self-control\non the part of the would-be ancestors of the coming Equilateral,\nand a patient, systematic, and continuous development\nof the Isosceles intellect through many generations.",
        "The birth of a True Equilateral Triangle from Isosceles parents\nis the subject of rejoicing in our country for many furlongs around.\nAfter a strict examination conducted by the Sanitary and Social Board,\nthe infant, if certified as Regular, is with solemn ceremonial\nadmitted into the class of Equilaterals.  He is then immediately\ntaken from his proud yet sorrowing parents and adopted by some\nchildless Equilateral, who is bound by oath never to permit the child\nhenceforth to enter his former home or so much as to look upon\nhis relations again, for fear lest the freshly developed organism may,\nby force of unconscious imitation, fall back again into\nhis hereditary level.",
        "The occasional emergence of an Equilateral from the ranks\nof his serf-born ancestors is welcomed, not only by\nthe poor serfs themselves, as a gleam of light and hope shed upon\nthe monotonous squalor of their existence, but also by the Aristocracy\nat large; for all the higher classes are well aware that\nthese rare phenomena, while they do little or nothing to vulgarize\ntheir own privileges, serve as a most useful barrier against\nrevolution from below.",
        "Had the acute-angled rabble been all, without exception,\nabsolutely destitute of hope and of ambition, they might have\nfound leaders in some of their many seditious outbreaks,\nso able as to render their superior numbers and strength too much\neven for the wisdom of the Circles.  But a wise ordinance of Nature\nhas decreed that, in proportion as the working-classes increase\nin intelligence, knowledge, and all virtue, in that same proportion\ntheir acute angle (which makes them physically terrible)\nshall increase also and approximate to the comparatively harmless\nangle of the Equilateral Triangle.  Thus, in the most brutal\nand formidable of the soldier class — creatures almost on a level\nwith women in their lack of intelligence — it is found that,\nas they wax in the mental ability necessary to employ\ntheir tremendous penetrating power to advantage, so do they wane\nin the power of penetration itself.",
        "How admirable is this Law of Compensation!  And how perfect a proof\nof the natural fitness and, I may almost say, the divine origin\nof the aristocratic constitution of the States in Flatland!\nBy a judicious use of this Law of Nature, the Polygons and Circles\nare almost always able to stifle sedition in its very cradle,\ntaking advantage of the irrepressible and boundless hopefulness\nof the human mind.  Art also comes to the aid of Law and Order.\nIt is generally found possible — by a little artificial\ncompression or expansion on the part of the State physicians —\nto make some of the more intelligent leaders of a rebellion\nperfectly Regular, and to admit them at once into\nthe privileged classes; a much larger number, who are still below\nthe standard, allured by the prospect of being ultimately ennobled,\nare induced to enter the State Hospitals, where they are kept\nin honourable confinement for life; one or two alone\nof the more obstinate, foolish, and hopelessly irregular are led\nto execution.",
        "Then the wretched rabble of the Isosceles, planless and leaderless,\nare either transfixed without resistance by the small body\nof their brethren whom the Chief Circle keeps in pay\nfor emergencies of this kind; or else more often, by means of\njealousies and suspicions skilfully fomented among them\nby the Circular party, they are stirred to mutual warfare,\nand perish by one another’s angles.  No less than one hundred\nand twenty rebellions are recorded in our annals, besides minor\noutbreaks numbered at two hundred and thirty-five;\nand they have all ended thus.",
