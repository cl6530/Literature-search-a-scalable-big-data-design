        "The next morning the sun came out early as bright as ever, and\nthen Peter appeared with the goats, and again the two children\nclimbed up together to the high meadows, and so it went on day\nafter day till Heidi, passing her life thus among the grass and\nflowers, was burnt brown with the sun, and grew so strong and\nhealthy that nothing ever ailed her. She was happy too, and\nlived from day to day as free and lighthearted as the little\nbirds that make their home among the green forest trees. Then the\nautumn came, and the wind blew louder and stronger, and the\ngrandfather would say sometimes, “To-day you must stay at home,\nHeidi; a sudden gust of the wind would blow a little thing like\nyou over the rocks into the valley below in a moment.”",
        "Whenever Peter heard that he must go alone he looked very\nunhappy, for he saw nothing but mishaps of all kinds ahead, and\ndid not know how he should bear the long dull day without Heidi.\nThen, too, there was the good meal he would miss, and besides\nthat the goats on these days were so naughty and obstinate that\nhe had twice the usual trouble with them, for they had grown so\naccustomed to Heidi’s presence that they would run in every\ndirection and refuse to go on unless she was with them. Heidi\nwas never unhappy, for wherever she was she found something to\ninterest or amuse her. She liked best, it is true, to go out\nwith Peter up to the flowers and the great bird, where there was\nso much to be seen, and so many experiences to go through among\nthe goats with their different characters; but she also found her\ngrandfather’s hammering and sawing and carpentering very\nentertaining, and if it should chance to be the day when the\nlarge round goat’s-milk cheese was made she enjoyed beyond\nmeasure looking on at this wonderful performance, and watching\nher grandfather, as with sleeves rolled back, he stirred the\ngreat cauldron with his bare arms. The thing which attracted her\nmost, however, was the waving and roaring of the three old fir\ntrees on these windy days. She would run away repeatedly from\nwhatever she might be doing, to listen to them, for nothing\nseemed so strange and wonderful to her as the deep mysterious\nsound in the tops of the trees. She would stand underneath them\nand look up, unable to tear herself away, looking and listening\nwhile they bowed and swayed and roared as the mighty wind rushed\nthrough them. There was no longer now the warm bright sun that\nhad shone all through the summer, so Heidi went to the cupboard\nand got out her shoes and stockings and dress, for it was\ngrowing colder every day, and when Heidi stood under the fir\ntrees the wind blew through her as if she was a thin little leaf,\nbut still she felt she could not stay indoors when she heard the\nbranches waving outside.",
        "Then it grew very cold, and Peter would come up early in the\nmorning blowing on his fingers to keep them warm. But he soon\nleft off coming, for one night there was a heavy fall of snow\nand the next morning the whole mountain was covered with it, and\nnot a single little green leaf was to be seen anywhere upon it.\nThere was no Peter that day, and Heidi stood at the little window\nlooking out in wonderment, for the snow was beginning again, and\nthe thick flakes kept falling till the snow was up to the\nwindow, and still they continued to fall, and the snow grew\nhigher, so that at last the window could not be opened, and she\nand her grandfather were shut up fast within the hut. Heidi\nthought this was great fun and ran from one window to the other\nto see what would happen next, and whether the snow was going to\ncover up the whole hut, so that they would have to light a lamp\nalthough it was broad daylight. But things did not get as bad as\nthat, and the next day, the snow having ceased, the grandfather\nwent out and shovelled away the snow round the house, and threw\nit into such great heaps that they looked like mountains standing\nat intervals on either side the hut. And now the windows and door\ncould be opened, and it was well it was so, for as Heidi and her\ngrandfather were sitting one afternoon on their three-legged\nstools before the fire there came a great thump at the door\nfollowed by several others, and then the door opened. It was\nPeter, who had made all that noise knocking the snow off his\nshoes; he was still white all over with it, for he had had to\nfight his way through deep snowdrifts, and large lumps of snow\nthat had frozen upon him still clung to his clothes. He had been\ndetermined, however, not to be beaten and to climb up to the\nhut, for it was a week now since he had seen Heidi.",
        "“Good-evening,” he said as he came in; then he went and placed\nhimself as near the fire as he could without saying another\nword, but his whole face was beaming with pleasure at finding\nhimself there. Heidi looked on in astonishment, for Peter was\nbeginning to thaw all over with the warmth, so that he had the\nappearance of a trickling waterfall.",
        "“Well, General, and how goes it with you?” said the grandfather,\n“now that you have lost your army you will have to turn to your\npen and pencil.”",
        "“Why must he turn to his pen and pencil?” asked Heidi\nimmediately, full of curiosity.",
        "“During the winter he must go to school,” explained her\ngrandfather, “and learn how to read and write; it’s a bit hard,\nalthough useful sometimes afterwards. Am I not right, General?”",
        "“Yes, indeed,” assented Peter.",
        "Heidi’s interest was now thoroughly awakened, and she had so\nmany questions to put to Peter about all that was to be done and\nseen and heard at school, and the conversation took so long that\nPeter had time to get thoroughly dry. Peter had always great\ndifficulty in putting his thoughts into words, and he found his\nshare of the talk doubly difficult to-day, for by the time he had\nan answer ready to one of Heidi’s questions she had already put\ntwo or three more to him, and generally such as required a whole\nlong sentence in reply.",
        "The grandfather sat without speaking during this conversation,\nonly now and then a twitch of amusement at the corners of his\nmouth showed that he was listening.",
        "“Well, now, General, you have been under fire for some time and\nmust want some refreshment, come and join us,” he said at last,\nand as he spoke he rose and went to fetch the supper out of the\ncupboard, and Heidi pushed the stools to the table. There was\nalso now a bench fastened against the wall, for as he was no\nlonger alone the grandfather had put up seats of various kinds\nhere and there, long enough to hold two persons, for Heidi had a\nway of always keeping close to her grandfather whether he was\nwalking, sitting or standing. So there was comfortable place for\nthem all three, and Peter opened his round eyes very wide when\nhe saw what a large piece of meat Alm-Uncle gave him on his thick\nslice of bread. It was a long time since Peter had had anything\nso nice to eat. As soon as the pleasant meal was over Peter\nbegan to get ready for returning home, for it was already growing\ndark. He had said his “good-night” and his thanks, and was just\ngoing out, when he turned again and said, “I shall come again\nnext Sunday, this day week, and grandmother sent word that she\nwould like you to come and see her one day.”",
        "It was quite a new idea to Heidi that she should go and pay\nanybody a visit, and she could not get it out of her head; so\nthe first thing she said to her grandfather the next day was, “I\nmust go down to see the grandmother to-day; she will be expecting\nme.”",
        "“The snow is too deep,” answered the grandfather, trying to put\nher off. But Heidi had made up her mind to go, since the\ngrandmother had sent her that message. She stuck to her\nintention and not a day passed but what in the course of it she\nsaid five or six times to her grandfather, “I must certainly go\nto-day, the grandmother will be waiting for me.”",
        "On the fourth day, when with every step one took the ground\ncrackled with frost and the whole vast field of snow was hard as\nice, Heidi was sitting on her high stool at dinner with the\nbright sun shining in upon her through the window, and again\nrepeated her little speech, “I must certainly go down to see the\ngrandmother to-day, or else I shall keep her waiting too long.”",
        "The grandfather rose from table, climbed up to the hay-loft and\nbrought down the thick sack that was Heidi’s coverlid, and said,\n“Come along then!” The child skipped out gleefully after him\ninto the glittering world of snow.",
        "The old fir trees were standing now quite silent, their branches\ncovered with the white snow, and they looked so lovely as they\nglittered and sparkled in the sunlight that Heidi jumped for joy\nat the sight and kept on calling out, “Come here, come here,\ngrandfather! The fir trees are all silver and gold!” The\ngrandfather had gone into the shed and he now came out dragging\na large hand-sleigh along with him; inside it was a low seat, and\nthe sleigh could be pushed forward and guided by the feet of the\none who sat upon it with the help of a pole that was fastened to\nthe side. After he had been taken round the fir trees by Heidi\nthat he might see their beauty from all sides, he got into the\nsleigh and lifted the child on to his lap; then he wrapped her\nup in the sack, that she might keep nice and warm, and put his\nleft arm closely round her, for it was necessary to hold her\ntight during the coming journey. He now grasped the pole with his\nright hand and gave the sleigh a push forward with his two feet.\nThe sleigh shot down the mountain side with such rapidity that\nHeidi thought they were flying through the air like a bird, and\nshouted aloud with delight. Suddenly they came to a standstill,\nand there they were at Peter’s hut. Her grandfather lifted her\nout and unwrapped her. “There you are, now go in, and when it\nbegins to grow dark you must start on your way home again.” Then\nhe left her and went up the mountain, pulling his sleigh after\nhim.",
        "Heidi opened the door of the hut and stepped into a tiny room\nthat looked very dark, with a fireplace and a few dishes on a\nwooden shelf; this was the little kitchen. She opened another\ndoor, and now found herself in another small room, for the place\nwas not a herdsman’s hut like her grandfather’s, with one large\nroom on the ground floor and a hay-loft above, but a very old\ncottage, where everything was narrow and poor and shabby. A\ntable was close to the door, and as Heidi stepped in she saw a\nwoman sitting at it, putting a patch on a waistcoat which Heidi\nrecognised at once as Peter’s. In the corner sat an old woman,\nbent with age, spinning. Heidi was quite sure this was the\ngrandmother, so she went up to the spinning-wheel and said, “Good-\nday, grandmother, I have come at last; did you think I was a long\ntime coming?”",
        "The woman raised her head and felt for the hand that the child\nheld out to her, and when she found it, she passed her own over\nit thoughtfully for a few seconds, and then said, “Are you the\nchild who lives up with Alm-Uncle, are you Heidi?”",
        "“Yes, yes,” answered Heidi, “I have just come down in the sleigh\nwith grandfather.”",
        "“Is it possible! Why your hands are quite warm! Brigitta, did Alm-\nUncle come himself with the child?”",
        "Peter’s mother had left her work and risen from the table and\nnow stood looking at Heidi with curiosity, scanning her from head\nto foot. “I do not know, mother, whether Uncle came himself; it\nis hardly likely, the child probably makes a mistake.”",
        "But Heidi looked steadily at the woman, not at all as if in any\nuncertainty, and said, “I know quite well who wrapped me in my\nbedcover and brought me down in the sleigh: it was grandfather.”",
        "“There was some truth then perhaps in what Peter used to tell us\nof Alm-Uncle during the summer, when we thought he must be\nwrong,” said grandmother; “but who would ever have believed that\nsuch a thing was possible? I did not think the child would live\nthree weeks up there. What is she like, Brigitta?”",
        "The latter had so thoroughly examined Heidi on all sides that\nshe was well able to describe her to her mother.",
        "“She has Adelaide’s slenderness of figure, but her eyes are dark\nand her hair curly like her father’s and the old man’s up there:\nshe takes after both of them, I think.”",
        "Heidi meanwhile had not been idle; she had made the round of the\nroom and looked carefully at everything there was to be seen.\nAll of a sudden she exclaimed, “Grandmother, one of your shutters\nis flapping backwards and forwards; grandfather would put a nail\nin and make it all right in a minute, or else it will break one\nof the panes some day; look, look, how it keeps on banging!”",
        "“Ah, dear child,” said the old woman, “I am not able to see it,\nbut I can hear that and many other things besides the shutter.\nEverything about the place rattles and creaks when the wind is\nblowing, and it gets inside through all the cracks and holes.\nThe house is going to pieces, and in the night, when the two\nothers are asleep, I often lie awake in fear and trembling,\nthinking that the whole place will give way and fall and kill us.\nAnd there is not a creature to mend anything for us, for Peter\ndoes not understand such work.”",
        "“But why cannot you see, grandmother, that the shutter is loose.\nLook, there it goes again, see, that one there!” And Heidi\npointed to the particular shutter.",
        "“Alas, child, it is not only that I cannot see–I can see,\nnothing, nothing,” said the grandmother in a voice of\nlamentation.",
        "“But if I were to go outside and put back the shutter so that\nyou had more light, then you could see, grandmother?”",
        "“No, no, not even then, no one can make it light for me again.”",
        "“But if you were to go outside among all the white snow, then\nsurely you would find it light; just come with me, grandmother,\nand I will show you.” Heidi took hold of the old woman’s hand to\nlead her along, for she was beginning to feel quite distressed\nat the thought of her being without light.",
        "“Let me be, dear child; it is always dark for me now; whether in\nsnow or sun, no light can penetrate my eyes.”",
        "“But surely it does in summer, grandmother,” said Heidi, more\nand more anxious to find some way out of the trouble, “when the\nhot sun is shining down again, and he says good-night to the\nmountains, and they all turn on fire, and the yellow flowers\nshine like gold, then, you will see, it will be bright and\nbeautiful for you again.”",
        "“Ah, child, I shall see the mountains on fire or the yellow\nflowers no more; it will never be light for me again on earth,\nnever.”",
        "At these words Heidi broke into loud crying. In her distress she\nkept on sobbing out, “Who can make it light for you again? Can\nno one do it? Isn’t there any one who can do it?”",
        "The grandmother now tried to comfort the child, but it was not\neasy to quiet her. Heidi did not often weep, but when she did\nshe could not get over her trouble for a long while. The\ngrandmother had tried all means in her power to allay the child’s\ngrief, for it went to her heart to hear her sobbing so bitterly.\nAt last she said, “Come here, dear Heidi, come and let me tell\nyou something. You cannot think how glad one is to hear a kind\nword when one can no longer see, and it is such a pleasure to me\nto listen to you while you talk. So come and sit beside me and\ntell me something; tell me what you do up there, and how\ngrandfather occupies himself. I knew him very well in old days;\nbut for many years now I have heard nothing of him, except\nthrough Peter, who never says much.”",
        "This was a new and happy idea to Heidi; she quickly dried her\ntears and said in a comforting voice, “Wait, grandmother, till I\nhave told grandfather everything, he will make it light for you\nagain, I am sure, and will do something so that the house will\nnot fall; he will put everything right for you.”",
        "The grandmother was silent, and Heidi now began to give her a\nlively description of her life with the grandfather, and of the\ndays she spent on the mountain with the goats, and then went on\nto tell her of what she did now during the winter, and how her\ngrandfather was able to make all sorts of things, seats and\nstools, and mangers where the hay was put for Little Swan and\nLittle Bear, besides a new large water-tub for her to bathe in\nwhen the summer came, and a new milk-bowl and spoon, and Heidi\ngrew more and more animated as she enumerated all the beautiful\nthings which were made so magically out of pieces of wood; she\nthen told the grandmother how she stood by him and watched all\nhe did, and how she hoped some day to be able to make the same\nherself.",
        "The grandmother listened with the greatest attention, only from\ntime to time addressing her daughter, “Do you hear that,\nBrigitta? Do you hear what she is saying about Uncle?”",
        "The conversation was all at once interrupted by a heavy thump on\nthe door, and in marched Peter, who stood stock-still, opening\nhis eyes with astonishment, when he caught sight of Heidi; then\nhis face beamed with smiles as she called out, “Good-evening,\nPeter.”",
        "“What, is the boy back from school already?” exclaimed the\ngrandmother in surprise. “I have not known an afternoon pass so\nquickly as this one for years. How is the reading getting on,\nPeter?”",
        "“Just the same,” was Peter’s answer.",
        "The old woman gave a little sigh. “Ah, well,” she said, “I hoped\nyou would have something different to tell me by this time, as\nyou are going to be twelve years old this February.”",
        "“What was it that you hoped he would have to tell you?” asked\nHeidi, interested in all the grandmother said.",
        "“I mean that he ought to have learnt to read a bit by now,\"\ncontinued the grandmother. “Up there on the shelf is an old\nprayer-book, with beautiful songs in it which I have not heard\nfor a long time and cannot now remember to repeat to myself, and\nI hoped that Peter would soon learn enough to be able to read\none of them to me sometimes; but he finds it too difficult.”",
        "“I must get a light, it is getting too dark to see,” said\nPeter’s mother, who was still busy mending his waistcoat. “I feel\ntoo as if the afternoon had gone I hardly know how.”",
        "Heidi now jumped up from her low chair, and holding out her hand\nhastily to the grandmother said, “Good-night, grandmother, if it\nis getting dark I must go home at once,” and bidding good-bye to\nPeter and his mother she went towards the door. But the\ngrandmother called out in an anxious voice, “Wait, wait, Heidi;\nyou must not go alone like that, Peter must go with you; and\ntake care of the child, Peter, that she does not fall, and don’t\nlet her stand still for fear she should get frozen, do you hear?\nHas she got anything warm to put around her throat?”",
        "“I have not anything to put on,” called back Heidi, “but I am\nsure I shall not be cold,” and with that she ran outside and\nwent off at such a pace that Peter had difficulty in overtaking\nher. The grandmother, still in distress, called out to her\ndaughter, “Run after her, Brigitta; the child will be frozen to\ndeath on such a night as this; take my shawl, run quickly!”",
        "Brigitta ran out. But the children had taken but a few steps\nbefore they saw the grandfather coming down to meet them, and in\nanother minute his long strides had brought him to their side.",
        "“That’s right, Heidi; you have kept your word,” said the\ngrandfather, and then wrapping the sack firmly round her he\nlifted her in his arms and strode off with her up the mountain.\nBrigitta was just in time to see him do all this, and on her\nreturn to the hut with Peter expressed her astonishment to the\ngrandmother. The latter was equally surprised, and kept on\nsaying, “God be thanked that he is good to the child, God be\nthanked! Will he let her come to me again, I wonder! the child\nhas done me so much good. What a loving little heart it is, and\nhow merrily she tells her tale!” And she continued to dwell with\ndelight on the thought of the child until she went to bed, still\nsaying now and again, “If only she will come again! Now I have\nreally something left in the world to take pleasure in.” And\nBrigitta agreed with all her mother said, and Peter nodded his\nhead in approval each time his grandmother spoke, saying, with a\nbroad smile of satisfaction, “I told you so!”",
        "Meanwhile Heidi was chattering away to her grandfather from\ninside her sack; her voice, however, could not reach him through\nthe many thick folds of her wrap, and as therefore it was\nimpossible to understand a word she was saying, he called to\nher, “Wait till we get home, and then you can tell me all about\nit.” They had no sooner got inside the hut than Heidi, having\nbeen released from her covering, at once began what she had to\nsay, “Grandfather, to-morrow we must take the hammer and the long\nnails and fasten grandmother’s shutter, and drive in a lot more\nnails in other places, for her house shakes and rattles all\nover.”",
        "“We must, must we? who told you that?” asked her grandfather.",
        "“Nobody told me, but I know it for all that,” replied Heidi,\n“for everything is giving way, and when the grandmother cannot\nsleep, she lies trembling for fear at the noise, for she thinks\nthat every minute the house will fall down on their heads; and\neverything now is dark for grandmother, and she does not think\nany one can make it light for her again, but you will be able\nto, I am sure, grandfather. Think how dreadful it is for her to\nbe always in the dark, and then to be frightened at what may\nhappen, and nobody can help her but you. To-morrow we must go and\nhelp her; we will, won’t we, grandfather?”",
        "The child was clinging to the old man and looking up at him in\ntrustful confidence. The grandfather looked down at Heidi for a\nwhile without speaking, and then said, “Yes, Heidi, we will do\nsomething to stop the rattling, at least we can do that; we will\ngo down about it to-morrow!”",
        "The child went skipping round the room for joy, crying out, “We\nshall go to-morrow! we shall go to-morrow!”",
        "The grandfather kept his promise. On the following afternoon he\nbrought the sleigh out again, and as on the previous day, he set\nHeidi down at the door of the grandmother’s hut and said, “Go in\nnow, and when it grows dark, come out again.” Then he put the\nsack in the sleigh and went round the house.",
        "Heidi had hardly opened the door and sprung into the room when\nthe grandmother called out from her corner, “It’s the child\nagain! here she comes!” and in her delight she let the thread\ndrop from her fingers, and the wheel stood still as she\nstretched out both her hands in welcome. Heidi ran to her, and\nthen quickly drew the little stool close up to the old woman, and\nseating herself upon it, began to tell and ask her all kinds of\nthings. All at once came the sound of heavy blows against the\nwall of the hut and the grandmother gave such a start of alarm\nthat she nearly upset the spinning-wheel, and cried in a\ntrembling voice, “Ah, my God, now it is coming, the house is\ngoing to fall upon us!” But Heidi caught her by the arm, and said\nsoothingly, “No, no, grandmother, do not be frightened, it is\nonly grandfather with his hammer; he is mending up everything, so\nthat you shan’t have such fear and trouble.”",
        "“Is it possible! is it really possible! so the dear God has not\nforgotten us!” exclaimed the grandmother. “Do you hear,\nBrigitta, what that noise is? Did you hear what the child says?\nNow, as I listen, I can tell it is a hammer; go outside,\nBrigitta, and if it is Alm-Uncle, tell him he must come inside a\nmoment that I may thank him.”",
        "Brigitta went outside and found Alm-Uncle in the act of\nfastening some heavy pieces of new wood along the wall. She\nstepped up to him and said, “Good-evening, Uncle, mother and I\nhave to thank you for doing us such a kind service, and she would\nlike to tell you herself how grateful she is; I do not know who\nelse would have done it for us; we shall not forget your\nkindness, for I am sure–”",
        "“That will do,” said the old man, interrupting her.",
        "“I know what you think of Alm-Uncle without your telling me. Go\nindoors again, I can find out for myself where the mending is\nwanted.”",
        "Brigitta obeyed on the spot, for Uncle had a way with him that\nmade few people care to oppose his will. He went on knocking\nwith his hammer all round the house, and then mounted the narrow\nsteps to the roof, and hammered away there, until he had used up\nall the nails he had brought with him. Meanwhile it had been\ngrowing dark, and he had hardly come down from the roof and\ndragged the sleigh out from behind the goat-shed when Heidi\nappeared outside. The grandfather wrapped her up and took her in\nhis arms as he had done the day before, for although he had to\ndrag the sleigh up the mountain after him, he feared that if the\nchild sat in it alone her wrappings would fall off and that she\nwould be nearly if not quite frozen, so he carried her warm and\nsafe in his arms.",
        "So the winter went by. After many years of joyless life, the\nblind grandmother had at last found something to make her happy;\nher days were no longer passed in weariness and darkness, one\nlike the other without pleasure or change, for now she had\nalways something to which she could look forward. She listened\nfor the little tripping footstep as soon as day had come, and\nwhen she heard the door open and knew the child was really there,\nshe would call out, “God be thanked, she has come again!” And\nHeidi would sit by her and talk and tell her everything she knew\nin so lively a manner that the grandmother never noticed how the\ntime went by, and never now as formerly asked Brigitta, “Isn’t\nthe day done yet?” but as the child shut the door behind her on\nleaving, would exclaim, “How short the afternoon has seemed;\ndon’t you think so, Brigitta?” And this one would answer, “I do\nindeed; it seems as if I had only just cleared away the mid-day\nmeal.” And the grandmother would continue, “Pray God the child is\nnot taken from me, and that Alm-Uncle continues to let her come!\nDoes she look well and strong, Brigitta?” And the latter would\nanswer, “She looks as bright and rosy as an apple.”",
        "And Heidi had also grown very fond of the old grandmother, and\nwhen at last she knew for certain that no one could make it\nlight for her again, she was overcome with sorrow; but the\ngrandmother told her again that she felt the darkness much less\nwhen Heidi was with her, and so every fine winter’s day the child\ncame travelling down in her sleigh. The grandfather always took\nher, never raising any objection, indeed he always carried the\nhammer and sundry other things down in the sleigh with him, and\nmany an afternoon was spent by him in making the goatherd’s\ncottage sound and tight. It no longer groaned and rattled the\nwhole night through, and the grandmother, who for many winters\nhad not been able to sleep in peace as she did now, said she\nshould never forget what the Uncle had done for her.",
