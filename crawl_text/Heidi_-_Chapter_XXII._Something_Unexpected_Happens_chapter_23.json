        "Uncle went out early the next morning to see what kind of a day\nit was going to be. There was a reddish gold light over the\nhigher peaks; a light breeze springing up and the branches of the\nfir trees moved gently to and fro the sun was on its way.",
        "The old man stood and watched the green slopes under the higher\npeaks gradually growing brighter with the coming day and the dark\nshadows lifting from the valley, until at first a rosy light\nfilled its hollows, and then the morning gold flooded every\nheight and depth–the sun had risen.",
        "Uncle wheeled the chair out of the shed ready for the coming\njourney, and then went in to call the children and tell them what\na lovely sunrise it was.",
        "Peter came up at this moment. The goats did not gather round him\nso trustfully as usual, but seemed to avoid him timidly, for\nPeter had reached a high pitch of anger and bitterness, and was\nlaying about him with his stick very unnecessarily, and where it\nfell the blow was no light one. For weeks now he had not had\nHeidi all to himself as formerly. When he came up in the morning\nthe invalid child was always already in her chair and Heidi fully\noccupied with her. And it was the same thing over again when he\ncame down in the evening. She had not come out with the goats\nonce this summer, and now to-day she was only coming in company\nwith her friend and the chair, and would stick by the latter’s\nside the whole time. It was the thought of this which was making\nhim particularly cross this morning. There stood the chair on its\nhigh wheels; Peter seemed to see something proud and disdainful\nabout it, and he glared at it as at an enemy that had done him\nharm and was likely to do him more still to-day. He glanced\nround–there was no sound anywhere, no one to see him. He sprang\nforward like a wild creature, caught hold of it, and gave it a\nviolent and angry push in the direction of the slope. The chair\nrolled swiftly forward and in another minute had disappeared.",
        "Peter now sped up the mountain as if on wings, not pausing till\nhe was well in shelter of a large blackberry bush, for he had no\nwish to be seen by Uncle. But he was anxious to see what had\nbecome of the chair, and his bush was well placed for that.\nHimself hidden, he could watch what happened below and see what\nUncle did without being discovered himself. So he looked, and\nthere he saw his enemy running faster and faster down hill, then\nit turned head over heels several times, and finally, after one\ngreat bound, rolled over and over to its complete destruction.\nThe pieces flew in every direction–feet, arms, and torn\nfragments of the padded seat and bolster–and Peter experienced a\nfeeling of such unbounded delight at the sight that he leapt in\nthe air, laughing aloud and stamping for joy; then he took a run\nround, jumping over bushes on the way, only to return to the same\nspot and fall into fresh fits of laughter. He was beside himself\nwith satisfaction, for he could see only good results for himself\nin this disaster to his enemy. Now Heidi’s friend would be\nobliged to go away, for she would have no means of going about,\nand when Heidi was alone again she would come out with him as in\nthe old days, and everything would go on in the proper way again.\nBut Peter did not consider, or did not know, that when we do a\nwrong thing trouble is sure to follow.",
        "Heidi now came running out of the hut and round to the shed.\nGrandfather was behind with Clara in his arms. The shed stood\nwide open, the two loose planks having been taken down, and it\nwas quite light inside. Heidi looked into every corner and ran\nfrom one end to the other, and then stood still wondering what\ncould have happened to the chair. Grandfather now came up.",
        "“How is this, have you wheeled the chair away, Heidi?”",
        "“I have been looking everywhere for it, grandfather; you said it\nwas standing ready outside,” and she again searched each corner\nof the shed with her eyes.",
        "At that moment the wind, which had risen suddenly, blew open the\nshed door and sent it banging back against the wall.",
        "“It must have been the wind, grandfather,” exclaimed Heidi, and\nher eyes grew anxious at this sudden discovery. “Oh! if it has\nblown the chair all the way down to Dorfli we shall not get it\nback in time, and shall not be able to go.”",
        "“If it has rolled as far as that it will never come back, for it\nis in a hundred pieces by now,” said the grandfather, going\nround the corner and looking down. “But it’s a curious thing to\nhave happened!” he added as he thought over the matter, for the\nchair would have had to turn a corner before starting down hill.",
        "“Oh, I am sorry,” lamented Clara, “for we shall not be able to\ngo to-day, or perhaps any other day. I shall have to go home, I\nsuppose, if I have no chair. Oh, I am so sorry, I am so sorry!”",
        "But Heidi looked towards her grandfather with her usual\nexpression of confidence.",
        "“Grandfather, you will be able to do something, won’t you, so\nthat it need not be as Clara says, and so that she is not\nobliged to go home?”",
        "“Well, for the present we will go up the mountain as we had\narranged, and then later on we will see what can be done,” he\nanswered, much to the children’s delight.",
        "He went indoors, fetched out a pile of shawls, and laying them\non the sunniest spot he could find set Clara down upon them. Then\nhe fetched the children’s morning milk and had out his two goats.",
        "“Why is Peter not here yet?” thought Uncle to himself, for\nPeter’s whistle had not been sounded that morning. The\ngrandfather now took Clara up on one arm, and the shawls on the\nother.",
        "“Now then we will start,” he said; “the goats can come with us.”",
        "Heidi was pleased at this and walked on after her grandfather\nwith an arm over either of the goats’ necks, and the animals were\nso overjoyed to have her again that they nearly squeezed her flat\nbetween them out of sheer affection. When they reached the spot\nwhere the goats usually pastured they were surprised to find them\nalready feeding there, climbing about the rocks, and Peter with\nthem, lying his full length on the ground.",
        "“I’ll teach you another time to go by like that, you lazy\nrascal! What do you mean by it?” Uncle called to him.",
        "Peter, recognising the voice, jumped up like a shot. “No one was\nup,” he answered.",
        "“Have you seen anything of the chair?” asked the grandfather.",
        "“Of what chair?” called Peter back in answer in a morose tone of\nvoice.",
        "Uncle said no more. He spread the shawls on the sunny slope, and\nsetting Clara upon them asked if she was comfortable.",
        "“As comfortable as in my chair,” she said, thanking him, “and\nthis seems the most beautiful spot. O Heidi, it is lovely, it is\nlovely!” she cried, looking round her with delight.",
        "The grandfather prepared to leave them. They would now be safe\nand happy together, he said, and when it was time for dinner\nHeidi was to go and fetch the bag from the shady hollow where he\nhad put it; Peter was to bring them as much milk as they wanted,\nbut Heidi was to see that it was Little Swan’s milk. He would\ncome and fetch them towards evening; he must now be off to see\nafter the chair and ascertain what had become of it.",
        "The sky was dark blue, and not a single cloud was to be seen\nfrom one horizon to the other. The great snow-field overhead\nsparkled as if set with thousands and thousands of gold and\nsilver stars. The two grey mountains peaks lifted their lofty\nheads against the sky and looked solemnly down upon the valley as\nof old; the great bird was poised aloft in the clear blue air,\nand the mountain wind came over the heights and blew refreshingly\naround the children as they sat on the sunlit slope. It was all\nindescribably enjoyable to Clara and Heidi. Now and again a\nyoung goat came and lay down beside them; Snowflake came\noftenest, putting her little head down near Heidi, and only\nmoving because another goat came and drove her away. Clara had\nlearned to know them all so well that she never mistook one for\nthe other now, for each had an expression and ways of its own.\nAnd the goats had also grown familiar with Clara and would rub\ntheir heads against her shoulder, which was always a sign of\nacquaintanceship and goodwill.",
        "Some hours went by, and Heidi began to think that she might just\ngo over to the spot where all the flowers grew to see if they\nwere fully blown and looking as lovely as the year before. Clara\ncould not go until grandfather came back that evening, when the\nflowers probably would be already closed. The longing to go\nbecame stronger and stronger, till she felt she could not resist\nit.",
        "“Would you think me unkind, Clara,” she said rather\nhesitatingly, “if I left you for a few minutes? I should run\nthere and back very quickly. I want so to see how the flowers are\nlooking–but wait–” for an idea had come into Heidi’s head. She\nran and picked a bunch or two of green leaves, and then took hold\nof Snowflake and led her up to Clara.",
        "“There, now you will not be alone,” said Heidi, giving the goat\na little push to show her she was to lie down near Clara, which\nthe animal quite understood. Heidi threw the leaves into Clara’s\nlap, and the latter told her friend to go at once to look at the\nflowers as she was quite happy to be left with the goat; she\nliked this new experience. Heidi ran off, and Clara began to\nhold out the leaves one by one to Snowflake, who snoozled up to\nher new friend in a confiding manner and slowly ate the leaves\nfrom her hand. It was easy to see that Snowflake enjoyed this\npeaceful and sheltered way of feeding, for when with the other\ngoats she had much persecution to endure from the larger and\nstronger ones of the flock. And Clara found a strange new\npleasure in sitting all alone like this on the mountain side, her\nonly companion a little goat that looked to her for protection.\nShe suddenly felt a great desire to be her own mistress and to be\nable to help others, instead of herself being always dependent as\nshe was now. Many thoughts, unknown to her before, came crowding\ninto her mind, and a longing to go on living in the sunshine, and\nto be doing something that would bring happiness to another, as\nnow she was helping to make the goat happy. An unaccustomed\nfeeling of joy took possession of her, as if everything she had\never known or felt became all at once more beautiful, and she\nseemed to see all things in a new light, and so strong was the\nsense of this new beauty and happiness that she threw her arms\nround the little goat’s neck, and exclaimed, “O Snowflake, how\ndelightful it is up here! if only I could stay on for ever with\nyou beside me!”",
        "Heidi had meanwhile reached her field of flowers, and as she\ncaught sight of it she uttered a cry of joy. The whole ground in\nfront of her was a mass of shimmering gold, where the cistus\nflowers spread their yellow blossoms. Above them waved whole\nbushes of the deep blue bell-flowers; while the fragrance that\narose from the whole sunlit expanse was as if the rarest balsam\nhad been flung over it. The scent, however, came from the small\nbrown flowers, the little round heads of which rose modestly\nhere and there among the yellow blossoms. Heidi stood and gazed\nand drew in the delicious air. Suddenly she turned round and\nreached Clara’s side out of breath with running and excitement.\n“Oh, you must come,” she called out as soon as she came in sight,\n“it is more beautiful than you can imagine, and perhaps this\nevening it may not be so lovely. I believe I could carry you,\ndon’t you think I could?” Clara looked at her and shook her head.\n“Why, Heidi, what can you be thinking of! you are smaller than I\nam. Oh, if only I could walk!”",
        "Heidi looked round as if in search of something, some new idea\nhad evidently come into her head. Peter was sitting up above\nlooking down on the two children. He had been sitting and\nstaring before him in the same way for hours, as if he could not\nmake out what he saw. He had destroyed the chair so that the\nfriend might not be able to move anywhere and that her visit\nmight come to an end, and then a little while after she had\nappeared right up here under his very nose with Heidi beside her.\nHe thought his eyes must deceive him, and yet there she was and\nno mistake about it.",
        "Heidi now looked up to where he was sitting and called out in a\nperemptory voice, “Peter, come down here!”",
        "“I don’t wish to come,” he called in reply.",
        "“But you are to, you must; I cannot do it alone, and you must\ncome here and help me; make haste and come down,” she called\nagain in an urgent voice.",
        "“I shall do nothing of the kind,” was the answer.",
        "Heidi ran some way up the slope towards him, and then pausing\ncalled again, her eyes ablaze with anger, “If you don’t come at\nonce, Peter, I will do something to you that you won’t like; I\nmean what I say.”",
        "Peter felt an inward throe at these words, and a great fear\nseized him. He had done something wicked which he wanted no one\nto know about, and so far he had thought himself safe. But now\nHeidi spoke exactly as if she knew everything, and whatever she\ndid know she would tell her grandfather, and there was no one he\nfeared so much as this latter person. Supposing he were to\nsuspect what had happened about the chair! Peter’s anguish of\nmind grew more acute. He stood up and went down to where Heidi\nwas awaiting him.",
        "“I am coming and you won’t do what you said.”",
        "Peter appeared now so submissive with fear that Heidi felt quite\nsorry for him and answered assuringly, “No, no, of course not;\ncome along with me, there is nothing to be afraid of in what I\nwant you to do.”",
        "As soon as they got to Clara, Heidi gave her orders: Peter was\nto take hold of her under the arms on one side and she on the\nother, and together they were to lift her up. This first movement\nwas successfully carried through, but then came the difficulty.\nAs Clara could not even stand, how were they to support her and\nget her along? Heidi was too small for her arm to serve Clara to\nlean upon.",
        "“You must put one arm well around my neck so, and put the other\nthrough Peter’s and lean firmly upon it, then we shall be able\nto carry you.”",
        "Peter, however, had never given his arm to any one in his life.\nClara put hers in his, but he kept his own hanging down straight\nbeside him like a stick.",
        "“That’s not the way, Peter,” said Heidi in an authoritative\nvoice. “You must put your arm out in the shape of a ring, and\nClara must put hers through it and lean her weight upon you, and\nwhatever you do, don’t let your arm give way; like that. I am\nsure we shall be able to manage.”",
        "Peter did as he was told, but still they did not get on very\nwell. Clara was not such a light weight, and the team did not\nmatch very well in size; it was up one side and down the other,\nso that the supports were rather wobbly.",
        "Clara tried to use her own feet a little, but each time drew\nthem quickly back.",
        "“Put your foot down firmly once,” suggested Heidi, “I am sure it\nwill hurt you less after that.”",
        "“Do you think so?” said Clara hesitatingly, but she followed\nHeidi’s advice and ventured one firm step on the ground and then\nanother; she called out a little as she did it; then she lifted\nher foot again and went on, “Oh, that was less painful already,\"\nshe exclaimed joyfully.",
        "“Try again,” said Heidi encouragingly.",
        "And Clara went on putting one foot out after another until all\nat once she called out, “I can do it, Heidi! look! look! I can\nmake proper steps!” And Heidi cried out with even greater\ndelight, “Can you really make steps, can you really walk? really\nwalk by yourself? Oh, if only grandfather were here!” and she\ncontinued gleefully to exclaim, “You can walk now, Clara, you can\nwalk!”",
        "Clara still held on firmly to her supports, but with every step\nshe felt safer on her feet, as all three became aware, and Heidi\nwas beside herself with joy.",
        "“Now we shall be able to come up here together every day, and go\njust where we like; and you will be able all your life to walk\nabout as I do, and not have to be pushed in a chair, and you\nwill get quite strong and well. It is the greatest happiness we\ncould have had!”",
        "And Clara heartily agreed, for she could think of no greater joy\nin the world than to be strong and able to go about like other\npeople, and no longer to have to lie from day to day in her\ninvalid chair.",
        "They had not far to go to reach the field of flowers, and could\nalready catch sight of the cistus flowers glowing gold in the\nsun. As they came to the bushes of the blue bell flowers, with\nsunny, inviting patches of warm ground between them, Clara said,\n“Mightn’t we sit down here for a while?”",
        "This was just what Heidi enjoyed, and so the children sat down\nin the midst of the flowers, Clara for the first time on the dry,\nwarm mountain grass, and she found it indescribably delightful.\nAround her were the blue flowers softly waving to and fro, and\nbeyond the gleaming patches of the cistus flowers and the red\ncentaury, while the sweet scent of the brown blossoms and of the\nfragrant prunella enveloped her as she sat. Everything was so\nlovely! so lovely! And Heidi, who was beside her, thought she\nhad never seen it so perfectly beautiful up here before, and she\ndid not know herself why she felt so glad at heart that she\nlonged to shout for joy. Then she suddenly remembered that Clara\nwas cured; that was the crowning delight of all that made life so\ndelightful in the midst of all this surrounding beauty. Clara sat\nsilent, overcome with the enchantment of all that her eye rested\nupon, and with the anticipation of all the happiness that was now\nbefore her. There seemed hardly room in her heart for all her\njoyful emotions, and these and the ecstasy aroused by the\nsunlight and the scent of the flowers, held her dumb.",
        "Peter also lay among the flowers without moving or speaking, for\nhe was fast asleep. The breeze came blowing softly and\ncaressingly from behind the sheltering rocks, and passed\nwhisperingly through the bushes overhead. Heidi got up now and\nthen to run about, for the flowers waving in the warm wind\nseemed to smell sweeter and to grow more thickly whichever way\nshe went, and she felt she must sit down at each fresh spot to\nenjoy the sight and scent. So the hours went by.",
        "It was long past noon when a small troop of goats advanced\nsolemnly towards the plain of flowers. It was not a feeding\nplace of theirs, for they did not care to graze on flowers. They\nlooked like an embassy arriving, with Greenfinch as their leader.\nThey had evidently come in search of their companions who had\nleft them in the lurch, and who had, contrary to all custom,\nremained away so long, for the goats could tell the time without\nmistake. As soon as Greenfinch caught sight of the three missing\nfriends amid the flowers she set up an extra loud bleat,\nwhereupon all the others joined in a chorus of bleats, and the\nwhole company came trotting towards the children. Peter woke up,\nrubbing his eyes, for he had been dreaming that he saw the chair\nagain with its beautiful red padding standing whole and uninjured\nbefore the grandfather’s door, and indeed just as he awoke he\nthought he was looking at the brass-headed nails that studded it\nall round, but it was only the bright yellow flowers beside him.\nHe experienced again a dreadful fear of mind that he had lost in\nthis dream of the uninjured chair. Even though Heidi had promised\nnot to do anything, there still remained the lively dread that\nhis deed might be found out in some other way. He allowed Heidi\nto do what she liked with him, for he was reduced to such a state\nof low spirits and meekness that he was ready to give his help to\nClara without murmur or resistance.",
        "When all three had got back to their old quarters Heidi ran and\nbrought forward the bag, and proceeded to fulfil her promise,\nfor her threat of the morning had been concerned with Peter’s\ndinner. She had seen her grandfather putting in all sorts of good\nthings, and had been pleased to think of Peter having a large\nshare of them, and she had meant him to understand when he\nrefused at first to help her that he would get nothing for his\ndinner, but Peter’s conscience had put another interpretation\nupon her words. Heidi took the food out of the bag and divided it\ninto three portions, and each was of such a goodly size that she\nthought to herself, “There will be plenty of ours left for him to\nhave more still.”",
        "She gave the other two their dinners and sat down with her own\nbeside Clara, and they all three ate with a good appetite after\ntheir great exertions.",
        "It ended as Heidi had expected, and Peter got as much food again\nas his own share with what Clara and Heidi had over from theirs\nafter they had both eaten as much as they wanted. Peter ate up\nevery bit of food to the last crumb, but there was something\nwanting to his usual enjoyment of a good dinner, for every\nmouthful he swallowed seemed to choke him, and he felt something\ngnawing inside him.",
        "They were so late at their dinner that they had not long to wait\nafter they had finished before grandfather came up to fetch them.\nHeidi rushed forward to meet him as soon as he appeared, as she\nwanted to be the first to tell him the good news. She was so\nexcited that she could hardly get her words out when she did get\nup to him, but he soon understood, and a look of extreme pleasure\ncame into his face. He hastened up to where Clara was sitting and\nsaid with a cheerful smile, “So we’ve made the effort, have we,\nand won the day!”",
        "Then he lifted her up, and putting his left arm behind her and\ngiving her his right to lean upon, made her walk a little way,\nwhich she did with less trembling and hesitation than before now\nthat she had such a strong arm round her.",
        "Heidi skipped along beside her in triumphant glee, and the\ngrandfather looked too as if some happiness had befallen him.\nBut now he took Clara up in his arms. “We must not overdo it,\"\nhe said, “and it is high time we went home,” and he started off\ndown the mountain path, for he was anxious to get her indoors\nthat she might rest after her unusual fatigue.",
        "When Peter got to Dorfli that evening he found a large group of\npeople collected round a certain spot, pushing one another and\nlooking over each other’s shoulders in their eagerness to catch\nsight of something lying on the ground. Peter thought he should\nlike to see too, and poked and elbowed till he made his way\nthrough.",
        "There it lay, the thing he had wanted to see. Scattered about\nthe grass were the remains of Clara’s chair; part of the back and\nthe middle bit, and enough of the red padding and the bright\nnails to show how magnificent the chair had been when it was\nentire.",
        "“I was here when the men passed carrying it up,” said the baker\nwho was standing near Peter. “I’ll bet any one that it was worth\ntwenty-five pounds at least. I cannot think how such an accident\ncould have happened.”",
        "“Uncle said the wind might perhaps have done it,” remarked one\nof the women, who could not sufficiently admire the red\nupholstery.",
        "“It’s a good job that no one but the wind did it,” said the\nbaker again, “or he might smart for it! No doubt the gentleman in\nFrankfurt when he hears what has happened will make all\ninquiries about it. I am glad for myself that I have not been\nseen up the mountain for a good two years, as suspicion is likely\nto fall on any one who was about up there at the time.”",
        "Many more opinions were passed on the matter, but Peter had\nheard enough. He crept quietly away out of the crowd and then\ntook to his heels and ran up home as fast as he could, as if he\nthought some one was after him. The baker’s words had filled him\nwith fear and trembling. He was sure now that any day a constable\nmight come over from Frankfurt and inquire about the destruction\nof the chair, and then everything would come out, and he would\nbe seized and carried off to Frankfurt and there put in prison.\nThe whole picture of what was coming was clear before him, and\nhis hair stood on end with terror.",
        "He reached home in this disturbed state of mind. He would not\nopen his mouth in reply to anything that was said to him; he\nwould not eat his potatoes; all he did was to creep off to bed\nas quickly as possible and hide under the bedclothes and groan.",
        "“Peter has been eating sorrel again, and is evidently in pain by\nthe way he is groaning,” said Brigitta.",
        "“You must give him a little more bread to take with him; give\nhim a bit of mine to-morrow,” said the grandmother sympathisingly.",
        "As the children lay that night in bed looking out at the stars\nHeidi said, “I have been thinking all day what a happy thing it\nis that God does not give us what we ask for, even when we pray\nand pray and pray, if He knows there is something better for us;\nhave you felt like that?”",
        "“Why do you ask me that to-night all of a sudden?” asked Clara.",
        "“Because I prayed so hard when I was in Frankfurt that I might\ngo home at once, and because I was not allowed to I thought God\nhad forgotten me. And now you see, if I had come away at first\nwhen I wanted to, you would never have come here, and would never\nhave got well.”",
        "Clara had in her turn become thoughtful. “But, Heidi,” she began\nagain, “in that case we ought never to pray for anything, as God\nalways intends something better for us than we know or wish\nfor.”",
        "“You must not think it is like that, Clara,” replied Heidi\neagerly. “We must go on praying for everything, for everything,\nso that God may know we do not forget that it all comes from\nHim. If we forget God, then He lets us go our own way and we get\ninto trouble; grandmamma told me so. And if He does not give us\nwhat we ask for we must not think that He has not heard us and\nleave off praying, but we must still pray and say, I am sure,\ndear God, that Thou art keeping something better for me, and I\nwill not be unhappy, for I know that Thou wilt make everything\nright in the end.”",
        "“How did you learn all that?” asked Clara.",
        "“Grandmamma explained it to me first of all, and then when it\nall happened just as she said, I knew it myself, and I think,\nClara,” she went on, as she sat up in bed, “we ought certainly to\nthank God to-night that you can walk now, and that He has made us\nso happy.”",
        "“Yes, Heidi, I am sure you are right, and I am glad you reminded\nme; I almost forgot my prayers for very joy.”",
        "Both children said their prayers, and each thanked God in her\nown way for the blessing He had bestowed on Clara, who had for so\nlong lain weak and ill.",
        "The next morning the grandfather suggested that they should now\nwrite to the grandmamma and ask her if she would not come and\npay them a visit, as they had something new to show her. But the\nchildren had another plan in their heads, for they wanted to\nprepare a great surprise for grandmamma. Clara was first to have\nmore practice in walking so that she might be able to go a\nlittle way by herself; above all things grandmamma was not to\nhave a hint of it. They asked the grandfather how long he thought\nthis would take, and when he told them about a week or less, they\nimmediately sat down and wrote a pressing invitation to\ngrandmamma, asking her to come soon, but no word was said about\nthere being anything new to see.",
        "The following days were some of the most joyous that Clara had\nspent on the mountain. She awoke each morning with a happy voice\nwithin her crying, “I am well now! I am well now! I shan’t have\nto go about in a chair, I can walk by myself like other people.”",
        "Then came the walking, and every day she found it easier and was\nable to go a longer distance. The movement gave her such an\nappetite that the grandfather cut his bread and butter a little\nthicker each day, and was well pleased to see it disappear. He\nnow brought out with it a large jugful of the foaming milk and\nfilled her little bowl over and over again. And so another week\nwent by and the day came which was to bring grandmamma up the\nmountain for her second visit.",
