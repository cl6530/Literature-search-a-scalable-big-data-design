        "It had just struck eleven o’clock, when the jailer, Blangin, entered\nJacques’s cell in great excitement, and said,–",
        "“Sir, your father is down stairs.”",
        "The prisoner jumped up, thunderstruck.",
        "The night before he had received a note from M. de Chandore, informing\nhim of the marquis’s arrival; and his whole time had since been spent\nin preparing himself for the interview. How would it be? He had\nnothing by which to judge. He had therefore determined to be quite\nreserved. And, whilst he was following Blangin along the dismal\npassage and down the interminable steps, he was busily composing\nrespectful phrases, and trying to look self-possessed.",
        "But, before he could utter a single word, he was in his father’s arms.\nHe felt himself pressed against his heart, and heard him stammer,–",
        "“Jacques, my dear son, my unfortunate child!”",
        "In all his life, long and stormy as it had been, the marquis had not\nbeen tried so severely. Drawing Jacques to one of the parlor-windows,\nand leaning back a little, so as to see him better, he was amazed how\nhe could ever have doubted his son. It seemed to him that he was\nstanding there himself. He recognized his own feature and carriage,\nhis own frank but rather haughty expression, his own clear, bright\neye.",
        "Then, suddenly noticing details, he was shocked to see Jacques so much\nreduced. He found him looking painfully pale, and he actually\ndiscovered at the temples more than one silvery hair amid his thick\nblack curls.",
        "“Poor child!” he said. “How you must have suffered!”",
        "“I thought I should lose my senses,” replied Jacques simply.",
        "And with a tremor in his voice, he asked,–",
        "“But, dear father, why did you give me no sign of life? Why did you\nstay away so long?”",
        "The marquis was not unprepared for such a question. But how could he\nanswer it? Could he ever tell Jacques the true secret of his\nhesitation? Turning his eyes aside, he answered,–",
        "“I hoped I should be able to serve you better by remaining in Paris.\"\nBut his embarrassment was too evident to escape Jacques.",
        "“You did not doubt your own child, father?” he asked sadly.",
        "“Never!” cried the marquis, “I never doubted a moment. Ask your\nmother, and she will tell you that it was this proud assurance I felt\nwhich kept me from coming down with her. When I heard of what they\naccused you, I said ’It is absurd!’ “",
        "Jacques shook his head, and said,–",
        "“The accusation was absurd; and yet you see what it has brought me\nto.”",
        "Two big tears, which he could no longer retain, burnt in the eyes of\nthe old gentleman.",
        "“You blame me, Jacques,” he said. “You blame your father.”",
        "There is not a man alive who could see his father shed tears, and not\nfeel his heart melt within him. All the resolutions Jacques had formed\nvanished in an instant. Pressing his father’s hand in his own, he\nsaid,–",
        "“No, I do not blame you, father. And still I have no words to tell you\nhow much your absence has added to my sufferings. I thought I was\nabandoned, disowned.”",
        "For the first time since his imprisonment, the unfortunate man found a\nheart to whom he could confide all the bitterness that overflowed in\nhis own heart. With his mother and with Dionysia, honor forbade him to\nshow despair. The incredulity of M. Magloire had made all confidence\nimpossible; and M. Folgat, although as sympathetic as man could be\nwas, after all, a perfect stranger.",
        "But now he had near him a friend, the dearest and most precious friend\nthat a man can ever have,–his father: now he had nothing to fear.",
        "“Is there a human being in this world,” he said, “whose misfortunes\nequal mine? To be innocent, and not to be able to prove it! To know\nthe guilty one, and not to dare mention the name. Ah! at first I did\nnot take in the whole horror of my situation. I was frightened, to be\nsure; but I had recovered, thinking that surely justice would not be\nslow in discovering the truth. Justice! It was my friend Galpin who\nrepresented it, and he cared little enough for truth: his only aim was\nto prove that the man whom he accused was the guilty man. Read the\npapers, father, and you will see how I have been victimized by the\nmost unheard-of combination of circumstances. Every thing is against\nme. Never has that mysterious, blind, and absurd power manifested\nitself so clearly,–that awful power which we call fate.",
        "“First I was kept by a sense of honor from mentioning the name of the\nCountess Claudieuse, and then by prudence. The first time I mentioned\nit to M. Magloire, he told me I lied. Then I thought every thing lost.\nI saw no other end but the court, and, after the trial, the galleys or\nthe scaffold. I wanted to kill myself. My friends made me understand\nthat I did not belong to myself, and that, as long as I had a spark of\nenergy and a ray of intelligence left me, I had no right to dispose of\nmy life.”",
        "“Poor, poor child!” said the marquis. “No, you have no such right.”",
        "“Yesterday,” continued Jacques, “Dionysia came to see me. Do you know\nwhat brought her here? She offered to flee with me. Father, that\ntemptation was terrible. Once free, and Dionysia by my side, what\ncared I for the world? She insisted, like the matchless girl that she\nis; and look there, there, on the spot where you now stand, she threw\nherself at my feet, imploring me to flee. I doubt whether I can save\nmy life; but I remain here.”",
        "He felt deeply moved, and sank upon the rough bench, hiding his face\nin his hands, perhaps to conceal his tears.",
        "Suddenly, however, he was seized with one of those attacks of rage\nwhich had come to him but too often during his imprisonment, and he\nexclaimed,–",
        "“But what have I done to deserve such fearful punishment?”",
        "The brow of the marquis suddenly darkened; and he replied solemnly,–",
        "“You have coveted your neighbor’s wife, my son.”",
        "Jacques shrugged his shoulders. He said,–",
        "“I loved the Countess Claudieuse, and she loved me.”",
        "“Adultery is a crime, Jacques.”",
        "“A crime? Magloire said the same thing. But, father, do you really\nthink so? Then it is a crime which has nothing appalling about it, to\nwhich every thing invites and encourages, of which everybody boasts,\nand at which the world smiles. The law, it is true, gives the husband\nthe right of life and death; but, if you appeal to the law, it gives\nthe guilty man six months’ imprisonment, or makes him pay a few\nthousand francs.”",
        "Ah, if he had known, the unfortunate man!",
        "“Jacques,” said the marquis, “the Countess Claudieuse hints, as you\nsay, that one of her daughters, the youngest, is your child?”",
        "“That may be so.”",
        "The Marquis de Boiscoran shuddered. Then he exclaimed bitterly,–",
        "“That may be so! You say that carelessly, indifferently, madman! Did\nyou never think of the grief Count Claudieuse would feel if he should\nlearn the truth? And even if he merely suspected it! Can you not\ncomprehend that such a suspicion is quite sufficient to embitter a\nwhole life, to ruin the life of that girl? Have you never told\nyourself that such a doubt inflicts a more atrocious punishment than\nany thing you have yet suffered?”",
        "He paused. A few words more, and he would have betrayed his secret.\nChecking his excitement by an heroic effort, he said,–",
        "“But I did not come here to discuss this question; I came to tell you,\nthat, whatever may happen, your father will stand by you, and that, if\nyou must undergo the disgrace of appearing in court, I will take a\nseat by your side.”",
        "In spite of his own great trouble, Jacques had not been able to avoid\nseeing his father’s unusual excitement and his sudden vehemence. For a\nsecond, he had a vague perception of the truth; but, before the\nsuspicion could assume any shape, it had vanished before this promise\nwhich his father made, to face by his side the overwhelming\nhumiliation of a judgment in court,–a promise full of divine self-\nabnegation and paternal love. His gratitude burst forth in the\nwords,–",
        "“Ah, father! I ought to ask your pardon for ever having doubted your\nheart for a moment.”",
        "M. de Boiscoran tried his best to recover his self-possession. At last\nhe said in an earnest voice,–",
        "“Yes, I love you, my son; and still you must not make me out more of a\nhero than I am. I still hope we may be spared the appearance in\ncourt.”",
        "“Has any thing new been discovered?”",
        "“M. Folgat has found some traces which justify legitimate hopes,\nalthough, as yet, no real success has been achieved.”",
        "Jacques looked rather discouraged.",
        "“Traces?” he asked.",
        "“Be patient. They are feeble traces, I admit, and such as could not be\nproduced in court; but from day to day they may become decisive. And\nalready they have had one good effect: they have brought us back M.\nMagloire.”",
        "“O God! Could I really be saved?”",
        "“I shall leave to M. Folgat,” continued the marquis, “the satisfaction\nof telling you the result of his efforts. He can explain their bearing\nbetter than I could. And you will not have long to wait; for last\nnight, or rather this morning, when we separated, he and M. Magloire\nagreed to meet here at the prison, before two o’clock.”",
        "A few minutes later a rapid step approached in the passage; and\nTrumence appeared, the prisoner of whom Blangin had made an assistant,\nand whom Mechinet had employed to carry Jacques’s letters to Dionysia.\nHe was a tall well-made man of twenty-five or six years, whose large\nmouth and small eyes were perpetually laughing. A vagabond without\nhearth or home, Trumence had once been a land-owner. At the death of\nhis parents, when he was only eighteen years old, Trumence had come\ninto possession of a house surrounded by a yard, a garden, several\nacres of land, and a salt meadow; all worth about fifteen thousand\nfrancs. Unfortunately the time for the conscription was near. Like\nmany young men of that district, Trumence believed in witchcraft, and\nhad gone to buy a charm, which cost him fifty francs. It consisted of\nthree tamarind-branches gathered on Christmas Eve, and tied together\nby a magic number of hairs drawn from a dead man’s head. Having sewed\nthis charm into his waistcoat, Trumence had gone to town, and,\nplunging his hand boldly into the urn, had drawn number three. This\nwas unexpected. But as he had a great horror of military service, and,\nwell-made as he was, felt quite sure that he would not be rejected, he\ndetermined to employ a chance much more certain to succeed; namely, to\nborrow money in order to buy a substitute.",
        "As he was a land-owner, he found no difficulty in meeting with an\nobliging person, who consented to lend him for two years thirty-five\nhundred francs, in return for a first mortgage on his property. When\nthe papers were signed, and Trumence had the money in his pocket, he\nset out for Rochefort, where dealers in substitutes abounded; and for\nthe sum of two thousand francs, exclusive of some smaller items, they\nfurnished him a substitute of the best quality.",
        "Delighted with the operation, Trumence was about to return home, when\nhis evil star led him to sup at his inn with a countryman, a former\nschoolmate, who was now a sailor on board a coal-barge. Of course,\ncountrymen when they meet must drink. They did drink; and, as the\nsailor very soon scented the twelve hundred francs which remained in\nTrumence’s pockets, he swore that he was going to have a jolly time,\nand would not return on board his barge as long as there remained a\ncent in his friend’s pocket. So it happened, that, after a fortnight’s\ncarouse, the sailor was arrested and put in jail; and Trumence was\ncompelled to borrow five francs from the stage-driver to enable him to\nget home.",
        "This fortnight was decisive for his life. During these days he had\nlost all taste for work, and acquired a real passion for taverns where\nthey played with greasy cards. After his return he tried to continue\nthis jolly life; and, to do so, he made more debts. He sold, piece\nafter piece, all he possessed that was salable, down to his mattress\nand his tools. This was not the way to repay the thirty-five hundred\nfrancs which he owed. When pay-day came, the creditor, seeing that his\nsecurity was diminishing every day, lost no time. Before Trumence was\nwell aware of what was going on, an execution was in the house; his\nlands were sold; and one fine day he found himself in the street,\npossessing literally nothing in the world but the wretched clothes on\nhis back.",
        "He might easily have found employment; for he was a good workman, and\npeople were fond of him in spite of all. But he was even more afraid\nof work than he was fond of drink. Whenever want pressed too hard, he\nworked a few days; but, as soon as he had earned ten francs, good-by!\nOff he went, lounging by the road-side, talking with the wagoners, or\nloafing about the villages, and watching for one of those kind topers,\nwho, rather than drink alone, invite the first-comer. Trumence boasted\nof being well known all along the coast, and even far into the\ndepartment. And what was most surprising was that people did not blame\nhim much for his idleness. Good housewives in the country would, it is\ntrue, greet him with a “Well, what do you want here, good-for-\nnothing?” But they would rarely refuse him a bowl of soup or a glass\nof white wine. His unchanging good-humor, and his obliging\ndisposition, explained this forbearance. This man, who would refuse a\nwell-paid job, was ever ready to lend a hand for nothing. And he was\nhandy at every thing, by land and by water, he called it, so that the\nfarmer whose business was pressing, and the fisherman in his boat who\nwanted help, appealed alike to Trumence.",
        "The mischief, however, is, that this life of rural beggary, if it has\nits good days, also has its evil times. On certain days, Trumence\ncould not find either kind-hearted topers or hospitable housewives.\nHunger, however, was ever on hand; then he had to become a marauder;\ndig some potatoes, and cook them in a corner of a wood, or pilfer the\norchards. And if he found neither potatoes in the fields, nor apples\nin the orchards, what could he do but climb a fence, or scale a wall?",
        "Relatively speaking, Trumence was an honest man, and incapable of\nstealing a piece of money; but vegetables, fruits, chickens–",
        "Thus it had come about that he had been arrested twice, and condemned\nto several days’ imprisonment; and each time he had vowed solemnly\nthat he would never be caught at it again, and that he was going to\nwork hard. And yet he had been caught again.",
        "The poor fellow had told his misfortunes to Jacques; and Jacques, who\nowed it to him that he could, when still in close confinement,\ncorrespond with Dionysia, felt very kindly towards him. Hence, when he\nsaw him come up very respectful, and cap in hand, he asked,–",
        "“What is it, Trumence?”",
        "“Sir,” replied the vagrant, “M. Blangin sends you word that the two\nadvocates are coming up to your room.”",
        "Once more the marquis embraced his son, saying,–",
        "“Do not keep them waiting, and keep up your courage.”",
        "Continue...",
