        "Not a sound as the key turned in the lock; not a sound as the door\nswung back on its carefully oiled hinges; not a sound as Larry the\nBat slipped like a shadow into the blackness of the room, closing\nthe door behind him again.  With a tread as noiseless as a cat’s, he\nwas across the room to satisfy himself that the shutters were\ntightly closed; and then the single gas jet flared up, murky,\nyellow, illuminating the miserable, squalid room–the Sanctuary–the\nhome of Larry the Bat.  There was need for silence, need for\ncaution.  In five minutes, ten at the outside, he must emerge again–\nas Jimmie Dale.",
        "With a smile on his lips that mingled curiously chagrin and self-\ncommiseration, he took the letter from his pocket and tore it open.\nIt was she, then, who had been following him all evening, and, like\na blundering idiot, he had wasted precious, perhaps irreparable,\nhours!  What had she meant by “It’s for my sake to-night”?  The\nwords had been ringing in his ears since the moment she had\nwhispered them in that panic-stricken crowd.  Was it not always for\nher sake that he answered these calls to arms?  Was it not always\nfor her sake that he, as the Gray Seal, was–  The mental soliloquy\ncame to an abrupt end.  He had subconsciously read the first\nsentence of the letter, and now, with sudden feverish eagerness and\nexcitement, he was reading it to the last word.",
        "“DEAR PHILANTHROPIC CROOK:  In an hour after you receive this, if\nall goes well, you shall know everything–everything.  Who I am–\nyes, and my name.  It has been more than three years now, hasn’t it?\nIt has been incomprehensible to you, but there has been no other\nway.  I dared not take the chance of discovery by any one; I dared\nnot expose you to the risk of being known by me.  Your life would\nnot have been worth a moment’s purchase.  Oh, Jimmie, am I only\nmaking the mystery more mystifying?  But to-night, I think, I hope,\nI pray that it is all at an end: though against me, and against you\nto-night when you go to help me, is the most powerful and pitiless\norganisation of criminals that the world has ever known; and the\nstake we are playing for is a fortune of millions–and my life.  And\nyet somehow I am afraid now, just because the end is so near, and\nthe victory seems so surely won.  And so, Jimmie, be careful; use\nall that wonderful cleverness of yours as you have never used it\nbefore, and–  But there should be no need for that, it is so simple\na thing that I am going to ask you to do.  Why am I writing so\nillogically!  Nothing, surely, can possibly happen.  This is not\nlike one of my usual letters, is it?  I am beside myself to-night\nwith hope, anxiety, fear, and excitement.",
        "“Listen, then, Jimmie:  Be at the northeast corner of Sixth Avenue\nand Waverly Place at exactly half-past ten.  A taxicab will drive\nup, as though you had signalled it in passing, and the chauffeur\nwill say: “I’ve another fare, in half an hour, sir, but I can get\nyou most anywhere in that time.”  You will be smoking a cigarette.\nToss it out into the street, make any reply you like, and get into\nthe cab.  Give the chauffeur that little ring of mine with the crest\nof the bell and belfry and the motto, “Sonnez le Tocsin,” that you\nfound the night old Isaac Pelina was murdered, and the chauffeur\nwill give you in exchange a sealed packet of papers.  He will drive\nyou to your home, and I will telephone to you there.",
        "“I need not tell you to destroy this.  Keep the appointment in your\nproper person–as Jimmie Dale.  Carry nothing that might identify\nyou as the Gray Seal if any accident should happen.  And, lastly,\ntrust the pseudo chauffeur absolutely.”",
        "There was no signature.  Her letters were never signed.  He stood\nfor a moment staring at the closely written sheets in his hand, a\nheightened colour in his cheeks, his lips pressed tightly together–\nand then his fingers automatically began to tear the letter into\npieces, and the pieces again into little shreds.  To-night!  It was\nto be to-night, the end of all this mystery.  To-night was to see\nthe end of this dual life of his, with its constant peril!  To-night\nthe Gray Seal was to exit from the stage forever!  To-night, a\nwonderful climax of the years, he was to see HER!",
        "His blood was quickened now, his heart pounding in a faster beat; a\nmad elation, a fierce uplift was upon him.  He thrust the torn bits\nof paper into his pocket hurriedly, stepped across the room to the\ncorner, rolled back the oilcloth, and lifted up the loose plank in\nthe flooring, so innocently dustladen, as, more than once, to have\neluded the eyes of inquisitive visitors in the shape of police and\nplain clothes men from headquarters.",
        "From the space beneath he removed a neatly folded pile of clothes,\nlaid these on the bed, and began to undress.  He was working rapidly\nnow.  Tiny pieces of wax were removed from his nostrils, from under\nhis lips, from behind his ears; water from a cracked pitcher poured\ninto a battered tin basin, and mixed with a few drops of some liquid\nfrom a bottle which he procured from its hiding place under the\nflooring, banished the make-up stain from his face, his neck, his\nwrists, and hands as if by magic.  It was a strange metamorphosis\nthat had taken place–the coarse, brutal-featured, blear-eyed,\nleering countenance of Larry the Bat was gone, and in its place,\nclean-cut, square-jawed, clear-eyed, was the face of Jimmie Dale.\nAnd where before had slouched a slope-shouldered, misshapen, flabby\ncreature, a broad-shouldered form well over six feet in height now\nstood erect, and under the clean white skin the muscles of an\nathlete, like knobs of steel played back and forth with every\nmovement of his body.",
        "In the streaked and broken mirror Jimmie Dale surveyed himself\ncritically, methodically, and, with a nod of satisfaction, hastily\ndonned the fashionably cut suit of tweeds upon the bed.  He rummaged\nthen through the ragged garments he had just discarded, transferred\nto his pockets a roll of bills and his automatic, and paused\nhesitantly, staring at the thin metal case, like a cigarette case,\nthat he held in the palm of his hand.  He shrugged his shoulders a\nlittle whimsically; it seemed strange indeed that he was through\nwith that!  He snapped it open.  Within, between sheets of oil\npaper, lay the scores of little diamond-shaped, gray-coloured,\nadhesive paper seals–the insignia of the Gray Seal.  Yes, it seemed\nstrange that he was never to use another!  He closed the case,\ngathered up the clothes of Larry the Bat, tucked the case in among\nthem, and shoved the bundle into the hole under the flooring.  All\nthese things would have to be destroyed, but there was not time to-\nnight; to-morrow, or the next day, would do for that.  What would it\nbe like to live a normal life again, without the menace of danger\nlurking on every hand, without that grim slogan of the underworld,\n“Death to the Gray Seal!” or that savage fiat of the police, “The\nGray Seal, dead or alive–but the Gray Seal!” forever ringing in his\nears?  What would it be like, this new life–with her?",
        "The thought was thrilling him again, bringing again that eager,\nexultant uplift.  In an hour, ONE hour, and the barriers of years\nwould be swept away, and she would be in his arms!",
        "“It’s for my sake to-night!”  His face grew suddenly tense, as the\nwords came back to him.  That “hour” wasn’t over yet!  It was no\nhysterical exaggeration that had prompted her to call her enemies\nthe most powerful and pitiless organisation of criminals that the\nworld had ever known.  It was not the Tocsin’s way to exaggerate.\nThe words would be literally true.  The very life she had led for\nthe three years that had gone stood out now as a grim proof of her\nassertion.",
        "Jimmie Dale replaced the flooring, carefully brushed the dust back\ninto the cracks, spread the oilcloth into place, and stood up.  Who\nand what was this organisation?  What was between it and the Tocsin?\nWhat was this immense fortune that was at stake?  And what was this\npriceless packet that was so crucial, that meant victory now, ay,\nand her life, too, she had said?",
        "The questions swept upon him in a sort of breathless succession.\nWhy had she not let him play a part in this?  True, she had told him\nwhy–that she dared not expose him to the risk.  Risk!  Was there\nany risk that the Gray Seal had not taken, and at her instance!  He\ndid not understand, he smiled a little uncertainly, as he reached up\nto turn out the gas.  There were a good many things that he did not\nunderstand about the Tocsin!",
        "The room was in darkness, and with the darkness Jimmie Dale’s mind\ncentred on the work immediately before him.  To enter the tenement\nwhere he was known and had an acknowledged right as Larry the Bat\nwas one thing; for Jimmie Dale to be discovered there was quite\nanother.",
        "He crossed the room, opened the door silently, stood for a moment\nlistening, then stepped out into the black, musty, ill-smelling\nhallway, closing the door behind him.  He stooped and locked it.\nThe querulous cry of a child reached him from somewhere above–a\nmurmur of voices, muffled by closed doors, from everywhere.  How\nmany families were housed beneath that sordid roof he had never\nknown, only that there was miserable poverty there as well as vice\nand crime, only that Larry the Bat, who possessed a room all to\nhimself, was as some lordly and super-being to these fellow tenants\nwho shared theirs with so many that there was not air enough for all\nto breathe.",
        "He had no doors to pass–his was next to the staircase.  He began to\ndescend.  They could scream and shriek, those stairs, like aged\nhumans, twisted and rheumatic, at the least ungentle touch.  But\nthere was no sound from them now.  There seemed something almost\nuncanny in the silent tread.  Stair after stair he descended, his\nentire weight thrown gradually upon one foot before the other was\nlifted.  The strain upon the muscles, trained and hardened as they\nwere, told.  As he moved from the bottom step, he wiped little beads\nof perspiration from his forehead.",
        "The door, now, that gave on the alleyway!  He opened it, slipped\noutside, darted across the narrow lane, stole along where the\nshadows of the fence were blackest, paused, listening, as he reached\nthe end of the alleyway, to assure himself that there was no near-by\npedestrian–and stepped out into the street.",
        "He kept on along the block, turned into the Bowery, and, under the\nfirst lamp, consulted his watch.  It was a quarter past ten.  He\ncould make it easily in a leisurely walk.  He continued on up the\nBowery, finally crossed to Broadway, and shortly afterward turned\ninto Waverly Place.  At the corner of Fifth Avenue he consulted his\nwatch again–and now he lighted a cigarette.  Sixth Avenue was only\na block away.  At precisely half-past ten, to the second, he halted\non the designated corner, smoking nonchalantly.",
        "A taxicab, coincidentally coming from an uptown direction, swung in\nto the curb.",
        "“Taxi, sir?  Yes, sir?”  Then, with an admirable mingling of\neagerness to secure the fare and a fear that his confession might\ncause him the loss of it: “I’ve another fare in half an hour, sir,\nbut I can get you most anywhere in that time.”",
        "Jimmie Dale’s cigarette was tossed carelessly into the street.",
        "“St. James Club!” he said curtly, and stepped into the cab.",
        "The cab started forward, turned the corner, and headed along Waverly\nPlace toward Broadway.  The chauffeur twisted around in his seat in\na matter-of-fact way, as though to ask further directions.",
        "“Have you anything for me?” he inquired casually.",
        "It lay where it always lay, that ring, between the folds of that\nlittle white glove in his pocketbook.  Jimmie Dale took it out now,\nand handed it silently to the chauffeur.",
        "The other’s face changed instantly–composure was gone, and a quick,\nstrained look was in its place.",
        "“I’m afraid I’ve been watched,” he said tersely.  “Look behind you,\nwill you, and tell me if you see anything?”",
        "Jimmie Dale glanced backward through the little window in the hood.",
        "“There’s another taxi just turned in from Sixth Avenue,” he reported\nthe next instant.",
        "“Keep your eye on it!” instructed the chauffeur shortly.",
        "The speed of the cab increased sensibly.",
        "With a curious tightening of his lips, Jimmie Dale settled himself\nin his seat so that he could watch the cab behind.  There was\ntrouble coming, intuitively he sensed that; and, he reflected\nbitterly, he might have known!  It was too marvellous, too wonderful\never to come to pass that this one hour, the thought of which had\nfired his blood and made him glad beyond any gladness life had ever\nheld for him before, should bring its promised happiness.",
        "“Where’s the cab now?” the chauffeur flung back over his shoulder.",
        "They had passed Fifth Avenue, and were nearing Broadway.",
        "“About the same distance behind,” Jimmie Dale answered.",
        "“That looks bad!” the chauffeur gritted between his teeth.  “We’ll\nhave to make sure.  I’ll run down Lower Broadway.”",
        "“If you think we’re followed,” suggested Jimmie Dale quietly, “why\nnot run uptown and give them the slip somewhere where the traffic is\nthick?  Lower Broadway at this time of night is as empty and\ndeserted as a country road.”",
        "The chauffeur’s sudden laugh was mirthless.",
        "“My God, you don’t know what you are talking about!” he burst out.\n“If they’re following, all hell couldn’t throw them off the track.\nAnd I’ve got to know, I’ve got to be SURE before I dare make a move\nto-night.  I couldn’t tell up in the crowded districts if I was\nfollowed, could I?  They won’t come out into the open until their\nhands are forced.”",
        "The car swerved sharply, rounded the corner, and, speeding up faster\nand faster, began to tear down Lower Broadway.",
        "“Watch!  WATCH!” cried the chauffeur.",
        "There was no word between them for a moment; then Jimmie Dale spoke\ncrisply:",
        "“It’s turned the corner!  It’s coming this way!”",
        "The taxicab was rocking violently with the speed; silent, empty,\nLower Broadway stretched away ahead.  Apart from an occasional\nstreet car, probably there would be nothing between them and the\nBattery.  Jimmie Dale glanced at his companion’s face as a light,\nflashing by, threw it into relief.  It was set and stern, even a\nlittle haggard; but, too, there was something else there, something\nthat appealed instantly to Jimmie Dale–a sort of bulldog grit that\ndominated it.",
        "“If he holds our speed, we’ll know!” the chauffeur was shouting now\nto make himself heard over the roar of the car.  “Look again!  Where\nis it now?”",
        "Once more Jimmie Dale looked through the little rear window.  The\ncab had been a block behind them when it had turned the corner, and\nhe watched it now in a sort of grim fascination.  There was no\npossible doubt of it!  The two bobbing, bouncing headlights were\ncreeping steadily nearer.  And then a sort of unnatural calm settled\nupon Jimmie Dale, and his hand went mechanically to his pocket to\nfeel his automatic there, as he turned again to the chauffeur.",
        "“If you’ve got any more speed, you’d better use it!” he said\nsignificantly.",
        "The man shot a quick look at him.",
        "“They are following us?  You are SURE?”",
        "“Yes,” said Jimmie Dale.",
        "The chauffeur laughed again in that mirthless, savage way.",
        "“Lean over here, where I can talk to you!” he rasped out.  “The\ngame’s up, as far as I am concerned, I guess!  But there’s a chance\nfor you.  They don’t know you in this.”",
        "“Give her more speed–or dodge into a cross street!” suggested\nJimmie Dale coolly.  “They haven’t got us yet, by a long way!”",
        "The other shook his head.",
        "“It’s not only that cab behind,” he answered, through set lips.\n“You don’t know what we’re up against.  If they’re really after us,\nthere’s a trap laid in every section of this city–the devils!  It’s\nthe package they want.  Thank God for the presentiment that made me\nleave it behind!  I was going back for it, you understand, if I was\nsatisfied that we weren’t followed.  Listen!  There’s a chance for\nyou–there’s none for me.  That package–remember this!–no one else\nknows where it is, and it’s life and death to the one who sent you\nhere.  It’s in Box 428 at–  My God, LOOK!  Look there!” he yelled,\nand, with a wrench at the wheel, sent the taxi lurching and\nstaggering for the car tracks in the centre of the street.",
        "The scene, fast as thought itself, was photographing itself in every\ndetail upon Jimmie Dale’s brain.  From the cross street ahead, one\nfrom each corner, two motor cars had nosed out into Broadway,\nblocking the road on both sides.  And now the car on the left-hand\nside was moving forward across the tracks to counteract the\nchauffeur’s move, deliberately insuring a collision.  There was no\nchance, no further room to turn, no time to stop–the man driving\nthe other car jumped for safety–they would be into it in an\ninstant.",
        "“Box 428!” Jimmie pleaded fiercely.  “Go on, man!  Go on!  FINISH!”",
        "“Yes!” cried the chauffeur.  “John Johansson, at–”",
        "But Jimmie Dale heard no more.  There was the crash of impact as the\ntaxicab plowed into the car that had been so craftily manoeuvered in\nfront of it, and Jimmie Dale, lifted from his feet, was hurled\nviolently forward with the shock, and all went black before his\neyes.",
