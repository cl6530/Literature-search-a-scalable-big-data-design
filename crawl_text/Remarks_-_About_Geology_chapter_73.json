        "Geology is that branch of natural science which treats of the structure of\nthe earth’s crust and the mode of formation of its rocks. It is a pleasant\nand profitable study, and to the man who has married rich and does not\nneed to work, the amusement of busting geology with the Bible, or busting\nthe Bible with geology is indeed a great boon.",
        "Geology goes hand in hand with zoology, botany, physical geography and\nother kindred sciences. Taxidermy, chiropody and theology are not kindred\nsciences.",
        "Geologists ascertain the age of the earth by looking at its teeth and\ncounting the wrinkles on its horns. They have learned that the earth is\nnot only of great age, but that it is still adding to its age from year to\nyear.",
        "It is hard to say very much of a great science in so short an article, and\nthat is one great obstacle which I am constantly running against as a\nscientist.",
        "I once prepared a paper in astronomy entitled “The Chronological History\nand Habits of the Spheres.” It was very exhaustive and weighed four\npounds. I sent it to a scientific publication that was supposed to be\nworking for the advancement of our race. The editor did not print it, but\nhe wrote me a crisp and saucy postal card, requesting me to call with a\ndray and remove my stuff before the board of health got after it. In five\nshort years from that time he was a corpse. As I write these lines, I\nlearn with ill-concealed pleasure that he is still a corpse. An awful\ndispensation of Providence, in the shape of a large, wilted cucumber, laid\nhold upon his vitals and cursed him with an inward pain. He has since had\nthe opportunity, by actual personal observation, to see whether the\nstatements by me relating to astronomy were true. His last words were:\n“Friends, Romans and countrymen, beware of the q-cumber. It will w up.” It\nwas not original, but it was good.",
        "The four great primary periods of the earth’s history are as follows, viz,\nto-wit:",
        "1. The Eozoic or dawn of life.",
        "2. The Palaeozoic or period of ancient life.",
        "3. The Mesozoic or middle period of life.",
        "4. The Neozoic or recent period of life.",
        "These are all subdivided again, and other words more difficult to spell\nare introduced into science, thus crowding out the vulgar herd who cannot\nafford to use the high priced terms in constant conversation.",
        "Old timers state that the primitive condition of the earth was extremely\ndamp. With the onward march of time, and after the lapse of millions of\nyears, men found that they could get along with less and less water, until\nat last we see the pleasant, blissful state of things. Aside from the use\nof water at our summer resorts, that fluid is getting to be less and less\npopular. And even here at these resorts it is generally flavored with some\nforeign substance.",
        "The earth’s crust is variously estimated in the matter of thickness. Some\nthink it is 2,500 miles thick, which would make it safe to run heavy\ntrains across the earth anywhere on top of a second mortgage, while other\nscientists say that if we go down one-tenth of that distance we will reach\na place where the worm dieth not. I do not wish to express an opinion as\nto the actual depth or thickness of the earth’s crust, but I believe that\nit is none too thick to suit me.",
        "Thickness in the earth’s crust is a mighty good fault. We estimate the age\nof certain strata of the earth’s formation by means of a union of our\nknowledge of plant and animal life, coupled with our geological research\nand a good memory. The older scientists in the field of geology do not\nrely solely upon the tracks of the hadrasaurus or the cornucopia for their\ndata. They simply use these things to refresh their memory.",
        "I wish that I had time and space to describe some of the beautiful\nbacteria and gigantic worms that formerly inhabited the earth. Such an\naggregation of actual, living Silurian monsters, any one of which would\nmake a man a fortune to-day, if it could be kept on ice and exhibited for\none season only. You could take a full grown mastodon to-day, and with no\ncalliope, no lithographs, no bearded lady, no clown with four pillows in\nhis pantaloons and no iron-jawed woman, you could go across this continent\nand successfully compete with the skating rink.",
        "There would be but one difficulty. Tour expenses would not be heavy. The\nmastodon would be willing to board around, and no one would feel like\nturning a mastodon out of doors if he seemed to be hungry; but he might\nget away from you and frolic away so far in one night that you couldn’t\nget him for a day or two, even if you sent a detective for him.",
        "If I had a mastodon I would rather take him when he was young, and then I\ncould make a pet of him, so that he could come and eat out of my hand\nwithout taking the hand off at the same time. A large mastodon weighing a\nhundred tons or so is awkward, too. I suppose that nothing is more painful\nthan to be stepped on by an adult mastodon.",
        "I hope at some future time to write a paper for the Academy of Science on\nthe subject of “Deceased Fauna, Fossiliferous Debris and Extinct Jokes,\"\nshowing how, when and why these early forms of animal life came to be\nextinct.",
