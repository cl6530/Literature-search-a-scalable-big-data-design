        " How the whole Parish was frighted.\nWho does not know Lady Ducklington, or who does not know that\nshe was buried at this Parish Church?",
        "Well, I never saw so grand a Funeral in all my Life; but the Money\nthey squandered away, would have been better laid out in little Books\nfor Children, or in Meat, Drink, and Cloaths for the Poor.",
        "This if a fine Hearse indeed, and the nodding Plumes on the Horses\nlook very grand; but what End does that answer, otherwise than to\ndisplay the Pride of the Living, or the Vanity of the Dead. Fie upon\nsuch Folly, say I, and Heaven grant that those who want more Sense may\nhave it.",
        "But all the Country round came to see the Burying, and it was late\nbefore the Corpse was interred. After which, in the Night, or rather\nabout Four o’Clock in the Morning, the Bells were heard to jingle in\nthe Steeple, which frightened the People prodigiously, who all thought\nit was Lady Ducklington’s Ghost dancing among the Bell-ropes.\nThe People flocked to Will Dobbins the Clerk, and wanted him to\ngo and see what it was; but William said, he was sure it was a\nGhost, and that he would not offer to open the Door. At length Mr.\nLong the Rector, hearing such an Uproar in the Village, went to\nthe Clerk, to know why he did not go into the Church; and see who was\nthere. I go, Sir, says William, why the Ghost would frighten me\nout of my Wits.–Mrs. Dobbins too cried, and laying hold of her\nHusband said, he should not be eat up by the Ghost. A Ghost, you\nBlockheads, says Mr. Long in a Pet, did either of you ever see\na Ghost, or know any Body that did? Yes, says the Clerk, my Father did\nonce in the Shape of a Windmill, and it walked all round the Church in\na white Sheet, with Jack Boots on, and had a Gun by its Side instead\nof a Sword. A fine Picture of a Ghost truly, says Mr. Long,\ngive me the Key of the Church, you Monkey; for I tell you there is no\nsuch Thing now, whatever may have been formerly.–Then taking the Key,\nhe went to the Church, all the people following him. As soon as he had\nopened the Door, what Sort of a Ghost do ye think appeared? Why Little\nTwo-Shoes, who being weary, had fallen asleep in one of the\nPews during the Funeral Service, and was shut in all Night. She\nimmediately asked Mr. Long’s Pardon for the Trouble she had\ngiven him, told him, she had been locked into the Church, and said,\nshe should not have rung the Bells, but that she was very cold, and\nhearing Farmer Boult’s Man go whistling by with his Horses, she\nwas in Hopes he would have went to the Clerk for the Key to let her\nout.",
