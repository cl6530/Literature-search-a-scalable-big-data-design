        "Musolino will remain a hero for many long years to come. “He did his\nduty “: such is the popular verdict on his career. He was not a brigand,\nbut an unfortunate–a martyr, a victim of the law. So he is described\nnot only by his country-people, but by the writers of many hundred\nserious pamphlets in every province of Italy.",
        "At any bookstall you may buy cheap illustrated tracts and poems setting\nforth his achievements. In Cosenza I saw a play of which he was the\nleading figure, depicted as a pale, long-suffering gentleman of the\n“misunderstood\" type–friend of the fatherless, champion of widows and\norphans, rectifier of all wrongs; in fact, as the embodiment of those\nvirtues which we are apt to associate with Prometheus or the founder of\nChristianity.",
        "Only to those who know nothing of local conditions will it seem strange\nto say that Italian law is one of the factors that contribute to the\ndisintegration of family life throughout the country, and to the\nproduction of creatures like Musolino. There are few villages which do\nnot contain some notorious assassins who have escaped punishment under\nsentimental pleas, and now terrorize the neighbourhood. This is one of\nthe evils which derange patriarchalism; the decent-minded living in fear\nof their lives, the others with a conspicuous example before their eyes\nof the advantages of evil-doing. And another is that the innocent often\nsuffer, country-bred lads being locked up for months and years in prison\non the flimsiest pretexts–often on the mere word of some malevolent\nlocal policeman–among hardened habitual offenders. If they survive the\ntreatment, which is not always the case, they return home completely\ndemoralized and a source of infection to others.",
        "It is hardly surprising if, under such conditions, rich and poor alike\nare ready to hide a picturesque fugitive from justice. A sad state of\naffairs, but–as an unsavoury Italian proverb correctly says–il pesce\npuzza dal capo.",
        "For the fault lies not only in the fundamental perversity of all Roman\nLaw. It lies also in the local administration of that law, which is\ninefficient and marked by that elaborate brutality characteristic of all\n“philosophic” and tender-hearted nations. One thinks of the Byzantines.\n. . . That justices should be well-salaried gentlemen, cognizant of\ntheir duties to society; that carbineers and other police-functionaries\nshould be civilly responsible for outrages upon the public; that a\nso-called “habeas-corpus” Act might be as useful here as among certain\nsavages of the north; that the Baghdad system of delays leads to\ncorruption of underpaid officials and witnesses alike (not to speak of\njudges)–in a word, that the method pursued hereabouts is calculated to\ncreate rather than to repress crime: these are truths of too elementary\na nature to find their way into the brains of the megalomaniac\nrhetoricians who control their country’s fate. They will never endorse\nthat saying of Stendhal’s: “In Italy, with the exception of Milan, the\ndeath-penalty is the preface of all civilization.” (To this day, the\nproportion of murders is still 13 per cent higher in Palermo than in\nMilan.)",
        "Speak to the wisest judges of the horrors of cellular confinement such\nas Musolino was enduring up to a short time ago, as opposed to capital\npunishment, and you will learn that they invoke the humanitarian\nBeccaria in justification of it. Theorists!",
        "For less formidable criminals there exists that wondrous institution of\ndomicilio coatto, which I have studied in the islands of Lipari and\nPonza. These evil-doers seldom try to escape; life is far too\ncomfortable, and the wine good and cheap; often, on completing their\nsentences, they get themselves condemned anew, in order to return. The\nhard-working man may well envy their lot, for they recuve free lodging\nfrom the Government, a daily allowance of money, and two new suits of\nclothes a year–they are not asked to do a stroke of work in return, but\nmay lie in bed all day long, if so disposed. The law-abiding citizen,\nmeanwhile, pays for the upkeep of this horde of malefactors, as well as\nfor the army of officials who are deputed to attend to their wants. This\ninstitution of domicilio coatto is one of those things which would be\nincredible, were it not actually in existence. It is a school, a\nState-fostered school, for the promotion of criminality.",
        "But what shall be expected? Where judges sob like children, and jurors\nswoon away with emotionalism; where floods of bombast–go to the courts,\nand listen!–take the place of cross-examination and duly-sworn\naffidavits; where perjury is a humanly venial and almost praiseworthy\nfailing–how shall the code, defective as it is, be administered?\nRhetoric, and rhetoric alone, sways the decision of the courts. Scholars\nare only now beginning to realize to what an extent the ancient sense of\nveracity was tainted with this vice–how deeply all classical history is\npermeated with elegant partisan non-truth. And this evil legacy from\nGreco-Roman days has been augmented by the more recent teachings of\nJesuitry and the Catholic theory of “peccato veniale.” Rhetoric alone\ncounts; rhetoric alone is “art.” The rest is mere facts; and your\n“penalista” has a constitutional horror of a bald fact, because there\nit is, and there is nothing to be done with it. It is too crude a thing\nfor cultured men to handle. If a local barrister were forced to state in\ncourt a plain fact, without varnish, he would die of cerebral\ncongestion; the judge, of boredom.",
        "In early times, these provinces had a rough-and-ready cowboy justice\nwhich answered simple needs, and when, in Bourbon days, things became\nmore centralized, there was still a never-failing expedient: each judge\nhaving a fixed and publicly acknowledged tariff, the village elders, in\ndeserving cases, subscribed the requisite sum and released their\nprisoner. But Italy is now paying the penalty of ambition. With one foot\nin the ferocity of her past, and the other on a quicksand of\ndream-nurtured idealism, she contrives to combine the disadvantages of\nboth. She, who was the light o’ love of all Europe for long ages, and in\nher poverty denied nothing to her clientele, has now laid aside a little\nmoney, repenting of her frivolous and mercenary deeds (they sometimes\ndo), and becoming puritanically zealous of good works in her old\nage–all this, however, as might have been expected from her antecedent\ncareer, without much discrimination.",
        "It is certainly remarkable that a race of men who have been such ardent\nopponents of many forms of tyranny in the past, should still endure a\nsystem of criminal procedure worthy of Torquemada. High and low cry out\nagainst it, but–pazienza! Where shall grievances be ventilated? In\nParliament? A good joke, that! In the press? Better still! Italian\nnewspapers nowise reflect the opinions of civilized Italy; they are mere\ncheese-wrappers; in the whole kingdom there are only three\nself-respecting dailies. The people have learnt to despair of their\nrulers–to regard them with cynical suspicion. Public opinion has been\ncrushed out of the country. What goes by that name is the gossip of the\ntown-concierge, or obscure village cabals and schemings.",
        "I am quite aware that the law-abiding spirit is the slow growth of ages,\nand that a serious mischief like this cannot be repaired in a short\ngeneration. I know that even now the Italian code of criminal procedure,\nthat tragic farce, is under revision. I know, moreover, that there are\nstipendiary magistrates in south Italy whose discernment and integrity\nwould do honour to our British courts. But–take the case out of their\nhands into a higher tribunal, and you may put your trust in God, or in\nyour purse. Justice hereabouts is in the same condition as it was in\nEgypt at the time of Lord Dufferin’s report: a mockery.",
        "It may be said that it does not concern aliens to make such criticism. A\nfatuous observation! Everything concerns everybody. The foreigner in\nItaly, if he is wise, will familiarize himself not only with the\ncathedrals to be visited, but also, and primarily, with the technique of\nlegal bribery and subterfuge–with the methods locally employed for\nescaping out of the meshes of the law. Otherwise he may find unpleasant\nsurprises in store for him. Had Mr. Mercer made it his business to\nacquire some rudiments of this useful knowledge, he would never have\nundergone that outrageous official ill-treatment which has become a\nbyword in the annals of international amenities. And if these strictures\nbe considered too severe, let us see what Italians themselves have to\nsay. In 1900 was published a book called “La Quistione Meridionale\"\n(What’s Wrong with the South), that throws a flood of light upon local\nconditions. It contains the views of twenty-seven of the most prominent\nmen in the country as to how south Italian problems should be faced and\nsolved. Nearly all of them deplore the lack of justice. Says Professor\nColajanni: “To heal the south, we require an honest, intelligent and\nsagacious government, which we have not got.” And Lombroso: “In the\nsouth it is necessary to introduce justice, which does not exist, save\nin favour of certain classes.”",
        "I am tempted to linger on this subject, not without reason. These people\nand their attitude towards life will remain an enigma to the traveller,\nuntil he has acquainted himself with the law of the land and seen with\nhis own eyes something of the atrocious misery which its administration\ninvolves. A murderer like Musolino, crowned with an aureole of\nsaintliness, would be an anomaly in England. We should think it rather\nparadoxical to hear a respectable old farmer recommending his boys to\nshoot a policeman, whenever they safely can. On the spot, things begin\nto wear a different aspect. Musolino is no more to be blamed than a\nchild who has been systematically misguided by his parents; and if these\npeople, much as they love their homes and families, are all potential\nMusolinos, they have good reasons for it–excellent reasons.",
        "No south Italian living at this present moment, be he of what social\nclass you please–be he of the gentlest blood or most refined\nculture–is a priori on the side of the policeman. No; not a\npriori. The abuses of the executive are too terrific to warrant such an\nattitude. Has not the entire police force of Naples, up to its very\nhead, been lately proved to be in the pay of the camorra; to say nothing\nof its connection with what Messrs. King and Okey euphemistically call\n“the unseen hand at Rome\"–a hand which is held out for blackmail, and\nnot vainly, from the highest ministerial benches? Under such conditions,\nthe populace becomes profoundly distrustful of the powers that be, and\nsuch distrust breeds bad citizens. But so things will remain, until the\nbag-and-baggage policy is applied to the whole code of criminal\nprocedure, and to a good half of its present administrators.",
        "The best of law-systems, no doubt, is but a compromise. Science being\none thing, and public order another, the most enlightened of legislators\nmay well tremble to engraft the fruits of modern psychological research\nupon the tree of law, lest the scion prove too vigorous for the aged\nvegetable. But some compromises are better than others; and the Italian\ncode, which reads like a fairy tale and works like a Fury, is as bad a\none as human ingenuity can devise. If a prisoner escape punishment, it\nis due not so much to his innocence as to some access of sanity or\nbenevolence on the part of the judge, who courageously twists the law in\nhis favour. Fortunately, such humane exponents of the code are common\nenough; were it otherwise, the prisons, extensive as they are, would\nhave to be considerably enlarged. But that ideal judge who shall be paid\nas befits his grave calling, who shall combine the honesty and common\nsense of the north with the analytical acumen of the south, has yet to\nbe evolved. What interests the student of history is that things\nhereabouts have not changed by a hair since the days of Demosthenes and\nthose preposterous old Hellenic tribunals. Not by a single hair! On the\none hand, we have a deluge of subtle disquisitions on “jurisprudence,\"\n“personal responsibility” and so forth; on the other, the sinister\ntomfoolery known as law– that is, babble, corruption, palaeolithic\nideas of what constitutes evidence, and a court-procedure that reminds\none of Gilbert and Sullivan at their best.",
        "There was a report in the papers not long ago of the trial of an old\nmarried couple, on the charge of murdering a young girl. The bench\ndismissed the case, remarking that there was not a particle of evidence\nagainst them; they had plainly been exemplary citizens all their long\nlives. They had spent five years in prison awaiting trial. Five years,\nand innocent! It stands to reason that such abuses disorganize the\nfamily, especially in Italy, where the “family” means much more than it\ndoes in England; the land lies barren, and savings are wasted in paying\nlawyers and bribing greedy court officials. What are this worthy couple\nto think of Avanti, Savoia! once they have issued from their dungeon?",
        "I read, in yesterday’s Parliamentary Proceedings, of an honourable\nmember (Aprile) rising to ask the Minister of Justice (Gallini) whether\nthe time has not come to proceed with the trial of “Signori Camerano and\ntheir co-accused,” who have been in prison for six years, charged with\nvoluntary homicide. Whereto His Excellency sagely replies that “la\nmagistratura ha avuto i suoi motivi\"–the magistrates have had their\nreasons. Six years in confinement, and perhaps innocent! Can one wonder,\nunder such circumstances, at the anarchist schools of Prato and\nelsewhere? Can one wonder if even a vindictive and corrupt rag like the\nsocialistic “Avanti” occasionally prints frantic protests of\nquasi-righteous indignation? And not a hundredth part of such accused\npersons can cause a Minister of the Crown to be interpellated on their\nbehalf. The others suffer silently and often die, forgotten, in their\ncells.",
        "And yet–how seriously we take this nation! Almost as seriously as we\ntake ourselves. The reason is that most of us come to Italy too\nundiscerning, too reverent; in the pre-critical and pre-humorous stages.\nWe arrive here, stuffed with Renaissance ideals or classical lore, and\nviewing the present through coloured spectacles. We arrive here, above\nall things, too young; for youth loves to lean on tradition and to draw\ninspiration from what has gone before; youth finds nothing more\ndifficult than to follow Goethe’s advice about grasping that living life\nwhich shifts and fluctuates about us. Few writers are sufficiently\ndetached to laugh at these people as they, together with ourselves, so\noften and so richly deserve. I spoke of the buffoonery of Italian law; I\nmight have called it a burlesque. The trial of the ex-minister Nasi:\nhere was a cause celebre conducted by the highest tribunal of the\nland; and if it was not a burlesque–why, we must coin a new word for\nwhat is.",
