        "The third game mentioned by Father Brebeuf was that which was called\nstraw. We have seen that the first of these games called for strength,\nagility and endurance. It was as free from elements of chance as any\nhuman contest can be. The victory belonged to the side which counted\namongst its numbers those players who were the fleetest runners, the\nmost skilful throwers and the most adroit dodgers. The second was\npurely a game of chance. If honestly played no other element entered\ninto its composition. The third which we are now about to consider was\nmuch more complicated in its rules than either of the others. It\nclosely resembled in some respects several of our modern gambling\ngames. The French found it very difficult to comprehend and hence the\naccounts of it which they have given are often confused and perplexing.\nBoucher [Footnote: p. 57.] says, “Our French people have not yet been\nable to learn to play it well; it is full of spirit and these straws\nare to the Indians what cards are to us.” Lafitau [Footnote: Vol. II,\np. 351.] after quoting from Boucher says, “Baron de LaHontan also made\nout of it a game purely of the mind and of calculation, in which he who\nbest knows how to add and subtract, to multiply and divide with these\nstraws will surely win. To do this, use and practice are necessary, for\nthese savages are nothing less than good calculators.”",
        "“Sieur Perrot, who was a celebrated traveller, and that European whom\nthe savages of New France have most honored, left a description of this\ngame in his manuscript Memorial. I would gladly have inserted it here\nbut it is so obscure that it is nearly unintelligible.” Charlevoix\nadmits that he could understand nothing of the game, except as played\nby two persons in its simplest form and adds that he was told that\n“there was as much of art as of chance in the game and that the Indians\nare great cheats at it.” [Footnote: Charlevoix, Vol. III, p. 319,\nFather Tailban who edited Perrot says he has not been any more\nsuccessful than his predecessors and the game of straws remains to him\nan unsolved enigma. Perrot, Notes to Ch. X, p. 188.] Where Lafitau and\nCharlevoix, aided by opportunities to investigate the game itself, have\nfailed, it would seem to be useless for us to attempt. Perrot has\nindeed succeeded in making his account hopelessly involved. There is\nhowever much information to be derived from it and the obscure points\nare after all unimportant unless one should actually wish to reproduce\nthe game in practice. In that event there are many points connected\nwith the counts which would prove troublesome.",
        "To play the game, a number of straws or reeds uniform in size and of\nequal length were required. They were generally from six to ten inches\nlong. The number used in the game was arbitrary. Lawson puts it at\nfifty-one. Charlevoix at two hundred and one. The only essential points\nwere that the numbers should be odd and that there should be enough of\nthem so that when the pile was divided into two parts, a glance would\nnot reveal which of the two divisions contained the odd number of\nstraws. In its simplest form, the game consisted, in separating the heap\nof straws into two parts, one of which each player took, and he whose\npile contained the odd number of straws was the winner. Before the\ndivision was made the straws were subjected to a manipulation, somewhat\nafter the manner of shuffling cards. They were then placed upon the\ndeer-skin or upon whatever other article was selected as a surface on\nwhich to play. The player who was to make the division into two heaps,\nwith many contortions of the body and throwing about of the arms, and\nwith constant utterances to propitiate his good luck, would make a\ndivision of the straws with a pointed bone or some similar instrument,\nhimself taking one of the divisions while his adversary took the other.\nThey would then rapidly separate the straws into parcels numbering ten\neach and determine from the fractional remainders, who had the odd\nnumber. The speed with which this process of counting was carried on was\nalways a source of wonder to the lookers-on, and the fact that the\ncounting was done by tens is almost invariably mentioned. Between two\npeople betting simply on the odd number no further rules were necessary.\nTo determine which had the heap containing the odd number, there was no\nneed to foot up the total number of tens. It was to be settled by what\nwas left over after the last pile of complete tens was set aside. The\nnumber itself might be either one, three, five, seven or nine. In the\nmore complicated form of the game, this led to giving different values\nto these numbers, the nine being always supreme and the one on which the\nhighest bets were wagered. It was generally understood that the holder\nof this number swept the board taking all bets on other numbers as well\nas those on the nine. It was easy to bet beads against beads and skins\nagainst skins, in a simple game of odd or even, but when the element of\ndifferent values for different combinations was introduced, some medium\nof exchange was needed to relieve the complications. Stones of fruit\nwere employed just as chips or counters are used in modern gambling\ngames, and a regular bank was practically instituted. Each player took a\ncertain number of these counters, as the equivalent of the value of the\nmerchandise which he proposed to hazard on the game, whether it was a\ngun, a blanket, or some other article. Here we have all the machinery of\na regular gambling game at cards, but the resemblance does not stop\nhere. The players put up their bets precisely as they now do in a game\nof faro, selecting their favorite number and fixing the amount, measured\nin the standard of the game, which they wished to hazard. “By the side\nof the straws which are on the ground are found the (grains) counters,\"\nsays Perrot, “which the players have bet on the game.” In another place,\nthe method of indicating the bets is stated as follows: “he (meaning\napparently the one who has bet) is also obliged to make two other heaps.\nIn one he will place five, in the other seven straws, with as many\n(grains) counters as he pleases.” These phrases may fairly be\ninterpreted to mean that a record of the bets, somewhat of the same\nstyle as that kept with counters upon a faro table, was constantly\nbefore the players. Complicated rules determined when the players won or\nlost; when the bets were to be doubled and when they were to abide the\nchance of another count. The loser at the game, even after all that he\nhad with him was gone, was sometimes permitted to continue the game on\nhis promise to pay. If ill luck still pursued him the winner could\nrefuse him credit and decline to play for stakes that he could not see.",
        "The game often lasted for several days, one after another of the sides\nrelieving his comrades at the play until one of the two sides had lost\neverything, it being, says Perrot, [Footnote: p. 19.] “a maxim of the\nsavages not to quit play until one side or the other had lost\neverything.” Those who had bet at the game had the right to substitute\nany person whom they pleased to play for them. “Should any dispute\narise on this point,” says Perrot, “between the winners and the losers,\nthe disputants backed by their respective sides would probably come to\nblows, blood would be shed and the whole thing would be very difficult\nto settle.” Cheating often took place at this game. Its exposure was\nconsidered praiseworthy and its practice denounced. If doubts were\nexpressed as to the accuracy of a count, the matter was peacefully\nadjusted by a re-count by two of the spectators.",
        "“This game of straw,” says Perrot, from whose account we have made the\nforegoing digest, “is ordinarily held in the cabins of the chiefs,\nwhich are large, and are, so to speak, the Academy of the Savages.” He\nconcludes his account with the statement that the women never play it.\n[Footnote: See also Shea’s Hennepin, p. 300.] The authority on this\ngame whom Ogilby quotes slides over the difficulties of the description\nwith the statement that “many other whimsies be in this game which\nwould be too long to commit to paper.” Abbe Ferland [Footnote: Vol. I,\np. 134.] epitomizes the results of his investigation of this game as\nfollows: “Memory, calculation and quickness of eyesight were necessary\nfor success.”",
        "Like the game of dice or platter it was essentially a house game, and\nlike platter it is rarely mentioned by writers who describe the habits\nof Indians in the south. Lawson describes it, but in slightly modified\nform, as follows: “Indian Cards. Their chiefest game is a sort of\nArithmetick, which is managed by a parcel of small split reeds, the\nthickness of a small Bent; these are made very nicely, so that they\npart, and are tractable in their hands. They are fifty-one in number,\ntheir length about seven inches; when they play, they throw part of\nthem to their antagonist; the art is, to discover, upon sight, how many\nyou have, and what you throw to him that plays with you. Some are so\nexpert at their numbers, that they will tell ten times together, what\nthey throw out of their hands. Although the whole play is carried on\nwith the quickest motion it is possible to use, yet some are so expert\nat this Game, as to win great Indian Estates by this Play. A good set\nof these reeds, fit to play withal are valued and sold for a dressed\ndoe-skin.”",
        "A. W. Chase [Footnote: Overland Monthly, Vol. II, p. 433. Dorsey found\na survival of the game in use among the Omahas. He called it “stick\ncounting.” Third Annual Report, Bureau of Ethnology, p. 338.] speaks of\n“native games of cards among the Coquelles and Makneatanas, the\npasteboards being bundles of sticks.” He furnishes no description of\nthe games, but uses the same phrase which was applied by Lawson in\nNorth Carolina and by Boucher in Canada.",
        "Frank H. Cushing [Footnote: The Century, Vol. XXVI, p. 38. My\nAdventures in Zuni.] speaks of a game of “Cane-cards” among the Zuni\nwhich he says “would grace the most civilized society with a refined\nsource of amusement.” He was not able fully to comprehend it.",
        "In the list of games, there is none of which we have any detailed\naccount, which compares with straws as played by the northern tribes,\nin elaborateness of construction. The unfortunate confusion which\nprevails throughout Perrot’s description of the method of counting, and\nthe way in which the point was shirked by all other writers on the\nsubject, prevents any attempt at analysis. So far as we can see, the\nrules were arbitrary and not based upon any calculations of the laws of\nchance. If some other detailed account of the game should be discovered\nit would be interesting to follow up this question and ascertain how\nfar the different combinations which affected the counts were based\nupon a theory of probabilities and how far they were arbitrary.",
        "It will of course be noticed that the game described by Lawson was\nrelieved from much of this complication. The dexterity required to make\na throw of such a nature that the player could tell exactly the number\nof reeds with which he had parted, was of course remarkable and\nnaturally called forth expressions of surprise. But there were\napparently no other combinations resting upon the throw than the simple\nguess at the number thrown. Travellers in California have described the\ngame in still simpler form in which we see hints of the more complex\ngame. Here the “sticks” were thrown in the air and an immediate guess\nwas made whether the number thrown was odd or even. An umpire kept the\naccount with other sticks and on this count the bets were adjusted.\n[Footnote: Kotzebue, A Voyage of Discovery, etc. London, 1821, Vol. I,\np. 282 and Vol. III, p. 44. note. W. H. Emory, U S. and Mexican\nBoundary Survey, Vol. I, p. 111, says: “The Yumas played a game with\nsticks like jackstraws.” Stanley, Smithsonian Miscellaneous\nCollections. Vol. II, p. 55, gives among his “Portraits of North\nAmerican Indians,” a picture of a game which he describes as “played\nexclusively by women. They hold in their hands twelve sticks about six\ninches in length which they drop upon a rock. The sticks that fall\nacross each other are counted for game.\"]",
        "Wherever we find it and whatever the form in use, whether simple or\ncomplicated, like games of lacrosse and platter the occasion of its\nplay was but an excuse for indulgence in the inveterate spirit of\ngambling which everywhere prevailed.",
