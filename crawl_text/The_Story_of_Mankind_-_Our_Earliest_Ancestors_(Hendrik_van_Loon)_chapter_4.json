        "WE know very little about the first “true” men. We have\nnever seen their pictures. In the deepest layer of clay of an\nancient soil we have sometimes found pieces of their bones.\nThese lay buried amidst the broken skeletons of other animals\nthat have long since disappeared from the face of the earth.\nAnthropologists (learned scientists who devote their lives to\nthe study of man as a member of the animal kingdom) have\ntaken these bones and they have been able to reconstruct our\nearliest ancestors with a fair degree of accuracy.",
        "The great-great-grandfather of the human race was a very\nugly and unattractive mammal. He was quite small, much\nsmaller than the people of today. The heat of the sun and the\nbiting wind of the cold winter had coloured his skin a dark\nbrown. His head and most of his body, his arms and legs too,\nwere covered with long, coarse hair. He had very thin but\nstrong fingers which made his hands look like those of a monkey.\nHis forehead was low and his jaw was like the jaw of a\nwild animal which uses its teeth both as fork and knife. He\nwore no clothes. He had seen no fire except the flames of the\nrumbling volcanoes which filled the earth with their smoke\nand their lava.",
        "He lived in the damp blackness of vast forests, as the\npygmies of Africa do to this very day. When he felt the\npangs of hunger he ate raw leaves and the roots of plants or\nhe took the eggs away from an angry bird and fed them to his\nown young. Once in a while, after a long and patient chase,\nhe would catch a sparrow or a small wild dog or perhaps a\nrabbit. These he would eat raw for he had never discovered\nthat food tasted better when it was cooked.",
        "During the hours of day, this primitive human being\nprowled about looking for things to eat.",
        "When night descended upon the earth, he hid his wife and\nhis children in a hollow tree or behind some heavy boulders,\nfor he was surrounded on all sides by ferocious animals and\nwhen it was dark these animals began to prowl about, looking\nfor something to eat for their mates and their own young, and\nthey liked the taste of human beings. It was a world where\nyou must either eat or be eaten, and life was very unhappy\nbecause it was full of fear and misery.",
        "In summer, man was exposed to the scorching rays of the\nsun, and during the winter his children would freeze to death\nin his arms. When such a creature hurt itself, (and hunting\nanimals are forever breaking their bones or spraining their\nankles) he had no one to take care of him and he must die a\nhorrible death.",
        "Like many of the animals who fill the Zoo with their\nstrange noises, early man liked to jabber. That is to say, he\nendlessly repeated the same unintelligible gibberish because it\npleased him to hear the sound of his voice. In due time he\nlearned that he could use this guttural noise to warn his fellow\nbeings whenever danger threatened and he gave certain little\nshrieks which came to mean “there is a tiger!” or “here come\nfive elephants.” Then the others grunted something back at\nhim and their growl meant, “I see them,” or “let us run away\nand hide.” And this was probably the origin of all language.",
        "But, as I have said before, of these beginnings we know\nso very little. Early man had no tools and he built himself\nno houses. He lived and died and left no trace of his existence\nexcept a few collar-bones and a few pieces of his skull.\nThese tell us that many thousands of years ago the world was\ninhabited by certain mammals who were quite different from\nall the other animals–who had probably developed from another\nunknown ape-like animal which had learned to walk on\nits hind-legs and use its fore-paws as hands–and who were\nmost probably connected with the creatures who happen to be\nour own immediate ancestors.",
        "It is little enough we know and the rest is darkness.",
