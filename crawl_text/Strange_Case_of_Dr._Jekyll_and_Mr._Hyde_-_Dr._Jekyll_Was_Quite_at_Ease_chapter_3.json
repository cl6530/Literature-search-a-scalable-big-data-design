        "A fortnight later, by excellent good fortune, the doctor gave one\nof his pleasant dinners to some five or six old cronies, all\nintelligent, reputable men and all judges of good wine; and Mr.\nUtterson so contrived that he remained behind after the others had\ndeparted. This was no new arrangement, but a thing that had\nbefallen many scores of times. Where Utterson was liked, he was\nliked well. Hosts loved to detain the dry lawyer, when the\nlight-hearted and the loose-tongued had already their foot on the\nthreshold; they liked to sit a while in his unobtrusive company,\npractising for solitude, sobering their minds in the man’s rich\nsilence after the expense and strain of gaiety. To this rule, Dr.\nJekyll was no exception; and as he now sat on the opposite side of\nthe fire — a large, well-made, smooth-faced man of fifty, with\nsomething of a slyish cast perhaps, but every mark of capacity and\nkindness — you could see by his looks that he cherished for Mr.\nUtterson a sincere and warm affection.",
        "“I have been wanting to speak to you, Jekyll,” began the latter.\n“You know that will of yours?”",
        "A close observer might have gathered that the topic was\ndistasteful; but the doctor carried it off gaily. “My poor\nUtterson,” said he, “you are unfortunate in such a client. I never\nsaw a man so distressed as you were by my will; unless it were that\nhide-bound pedant, Lanyon, at what he called my scientific heresies.\nOh, I know he’s a good fellow — you needn’t frown — an excellent\nfellow, and I always mean to see more of him; but a hide-bound\npedant for all that; an ignorant, blatant pedant. I was never more\ndisappointed in any man than Lanyon.”",
        "“You know I never approved of it,” pursued Utterson, ruthlessly\ndisregarding the fresh topic.",
        "“My will? Yes, certainly, I know that,” said the doctor, a trifle\nsharply. “You have told me so.”",
        "“Well, I tell you so again,” continued the lawyer. “I have been\nlearning something of young Hyde.”",
        "The large handsome face of Dr. Jekyll grew pale to the very lips,\nand there came a blackness about his eyes. “I do not care to hear\nmore,” said he. “This is a matter I thought we had agreed to drop.”",
        "“What I heard was abominable,” said Utterson.",
        "“It can make no change. You do not understand my position,” returned the doctor, with a certain incoherency\nof manner. “I am painfully situated, Utterson; my position is a very\nstrange — a very strange one. It is one of those affairs that\ncannot be mended by talking.”",
        "“Jekyll,” said Utterson, “you know me: I am a man to be trusted.\nMake a clean breast of this in confidence; and I make no doubt I\ncan get you out of it.”",
        "“My good Utterson,” said the doctor, “this is very good of you,\nthis is downright good of you, and I cannot find words to thank you\nin. I believe you fully; I would trust you before any man alive, ay,\nbefore myself, if I could make the choice; but indeed it isn’t what\nyou fancy; it is not so bad as that; and just to put your good heart\nat rest, I will tell you one thing: the moment I choose, I can be\nrid of Mr. Hyde. I give you my hand upon that; and I thank you again\nand again; and I will just add one little word, Utterson, that I’m\nsure you’ll take in good part: this is a private matter, and I beg\nof you to let it sleep.” ",
        "Utterson reflected a little, looking in the fire.",
        "“I have no doubt you are perfectly right,” he said at last, getting\nto his feet.",
        "“Well, but since we have touched upon this business, and for the\nlast time I hope,” continued the doctor, “there is one point I\nshould like you to understand. I have really a very great interest\nin poor Hyde. I know you have seen him; he told me so; and I fear he was rude. But, I do sincerely\ntake a great, a very great interest in that young man; and if I am\ntaken away, Utterson, I wish you to promise me that you will bear\nwith him and get his rights for him. I think you would, if you knew\nall; and it would be a weight off my mind if you would promise.”",
        "“I can’t pretend that I shall ever like him,” said the lawyer.",
        "“I don’t ask that,” pleaded Jekyll, laying his hand upon the\nother’s arm; “I only ask for justice; I only ask you to help him\nfor my sake, when I am no longer here.”",
        "Utterson heaved an irrepressible sigh. “Well,” said he, “I\npromise.”",
