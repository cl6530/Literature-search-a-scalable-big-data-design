        "\nMy failure with my Grandson did not encourage me to communicate\nmy secret to others of my household; yet neither was I led by it\nto despair of success.  Only I saw that I must not wholly rely\non the catch-phrase, “Upward, not Northward”, but must rather\nendeavour to seek a demonstration by setting before the public\na clear view of the whole subject; and for this purpose\nit seemed necessary to resort to writing.",
        "So I devoted several months in privacy to the composition\nof a treatise on the mysteries of Three Dimensions.  Only,\nwith the view of evading the Law, if possible, I spoke not\nof a physical Dimension, but of a Thoughtland whence, in theory,\na Figure could look down upon Flatland and see simultaneously\nthe insides of all things, and where it was possible that there might\nbe supposed to exist a Figure environed, as it were, with six Squares,\nand containing eight terminal Points.  But in writing this book\nI found myself sadly hampered by the impossibility of drawing\nsuch diagrams as were necessary for my purpose; for of course,\nin our country of Flatland, there are no tablets but Lines,\nand no diagrams but Lines, all in one straight Line\nand only distinguishable by difference of size and brightness;\nso that, when I had finished my treatise (which I entitled,\n“Through Flatland to Thoughtland”) I could not feel certain\nthat many would understand my meaning.",
        "Meanwhile my life was under a cloud.  All pleasures palled upon me;\nall sights tantalized and tempted me to outspoken treason,\nbecause I could not but compare what I saw in Two Dimensions\nwith what it really was if seen in Three, and could hardly refrain\nfrom making my comparisons aloud.  I neglected my clients\nand my own business to give myself to the contemplation\nof the mysteries which I had once beheld, yet which I could impart\nto no one, and found daily more difficult to reproduce even before\nmy own mental vision.",
        "One day, about eleven months after my return from Spaceland,\nI tried to see a Cube with my eye closed, but failed;\nand though I succeeded afterwards, I was not then quite certain\n(nor have I been ever afterwards) that I had exactly realized\nthe original.  This made me more melancholy than before,\nand determined me to take some step; yet what, I knew not.\nI felt that I would have been willing to sacrifice my life\nfor the Cause, if thereby I could have produced conviction.\nBut if I could not convince my Grandson, how could I convince\nthe highest and most developed Circles in the land?",
        "And yet at times my spirit was too strong for me, and I gave vent\nto dangerous utterances.  Already I was considered heterodox\nif not treasonable, and I was keenly alive to the danger\nof my position; nevertheless I could not at times refrain\nfrom bursting out into suspicious or half-seditious utterances,\neven among the highest Polygonal and Circular society.  When,\nfor example, the question arose about the treatment of those lunatics\nwho said that they had received the power of seeing the insides\nof things, I would quote the saying of an ancient Circle,\nwho declared that prophets and inspired people are always considered\nby the majority to be mad; and I could not help occasionally dropping\nsuch expressions as “the eye that discerns the interiors of things”,\nand “the all-seeing land\"; once or twice I even let fall\nthe forbidden terms “the Third and Fourth Dimensions”.  At last,\nto complete a series of minor indiscretions, at a meeting of our\nLocal Speculative Society held at the palace of the Prefect himself,\n— some extremely silly person having read an elaborate paper\nexhibiting the precise reasons why Providence has limited\nthe number of Dimensions to Two, and why the attribute of omnividence\nis assigned to the Supreme alone — I so far forgot myself as to give\nan exact account of the whole of my voyage with the Sphere into Space,\nand to the Assembly Hall in our Metropolis, and then to Space again,\nand of my return home, and of everything that I had seen and heard\nin fact or vision.  At first, indeed, I pretended that I was\ndescribing the imaginary experiences of a fictitious person;\nbut my enthusiasm soon forced me to throw off all disguise,\nand finally, in a fervent peroration, I exhorted all my hearers\nto divest themselves of prejudice and to become believers\nin the Third Dimension.",
        "Need I say that I was at once arrested and taken before the Council?",
        "Next morning, standing in the very place where but a very few\nmonths ago the Sphere had stood in my company, I was allowed to begin\nand to continue my narration unquestioned and uninterrupted.\nBut from the first I foresaw my fate; for the President,\nnoting that a guard of the better sort of Policemen was in attendance,\nof angularity little, if at all, under 55 degrees, ordered them\nto be relieved before I began my defence, by an inferior class\nof 2 or 3 degrees.  I knew only too well what that meant.\nI was to be executed or imprisoned, and my story was to be kept secret\nfrom the world by the simultaneous destruction of the officials\nwho had heard it; and, this being the case, the President desired\nto substitute the cheaper for the more expensive victims.",
        "After I had concluded my defence, the President, perhaps perceiving\nthat some of the junior Circles had been moved by my\nevident earnestness, asked me two questions: --",
        "1.  Whether I could indicate the direction which I meant\nwhen I used the words “Upward, not Northward”?",
        "2.  Whether I could by any diagrams or descriptions (other than\nthe enumeration of imaginary sides and angles) indicate the Figure\nI was pleased to call a Cube?",
        "I declared that I could say nothing more, and that I must\ncommit myself to the Truth, whose cause would surely prevail\nin the end.",
        "The President replied that he quite concurred in my sentiment,\nand that I could not do better.  I must be sentenced to\nperpetual imprisonment; but if the Truth intended that I should emerge\nfrom prison and evangelize the world, the Truth might be trusted\nto bring that result to pass.  Meanwhile I should be subjected\nto no discomfort that was not necessary to preclude escape, and,\nunless I forfeited the privilege by misconduct, I should be\noccasionally permitted to see my brother who had preceded me\nto my prison.",
        "Seven years have elapsed and I am still a prisoner, and\n— if I except the occasional visits of my brother —\ndebarred from all companionship save that of my jailers.\nMy brother is one of the best of Squares, just, sensible,\ncheerful, and not without fraternal affection; yet I confess\nthat my weekly interviews, at least in one respect, cause me\nthe bitterest pain.  He was present when the Sphere manifested himself\nin the Council Chamber; he saw the Sphere’s changing sections;\nhe heard the explanation of the phenomena then given to the Circles.\nSince that time, scarcely a week has passed during seven whole years,\nwithout his hearing from me a repetition of the part I played\nin that manifestation, together with ample descriptions\nof all the phenomena in Spaceland, and the arguments for the existence\nof Solid things derivable from Analogy.  Yet — I take shame\nto be forced to confess it — my brother has not yet grasped\nthe nature of the Third Dimension, and frankly avows his disbelief\nin the existence of a Sphere.",
        "Hence I am absolutely destitute of converts, and, for aught that\nI can see, the millennial Revelation has been made to me for nothing.\nPrometheus up in Spaceland was bound for bringing down fire\nfor mortals, but I — poor Flatland Prometheus — lie here in prison\nfor bringing down nothing to my countrymen.  Yet I exist in the hope\nthat these memoirs, in some manner, I know not how, may find their way\nto the minds of humanity in Some Dimension, and may stir up a race\nof rebels who shall refuse to be confined to limited Dimensionality.",
        "That is the hope of my brighter moments.  Alas, it is not always so.\nHeavily weighs on me at times the burdensome reflection that I cannot\nhonestly say I am confident as to the exact shape of the once-seen,\noft-regretted Cube; and in my nightly visions the mysterious precept,\n“Upward, not Northward”, haunts me like a soul-devouring Sphinx.\nIt is part of the martyrdom which I endure for the cause of the Truth\nthat there are seasons of mental weakness, when Cubes and Spheres\nflit away into the background of scarce-possible existences;\nwhen the Land of Three Dimensions seems almost as visionary\nas the Land of One or None; nay, when even this hard wall that bars me\nfrom my freedom, these very tablets on which I am writing,\nand all the substantial realities of Flatland itself, appear no better\nthan the offspring of a diseased imagination, or the baseless fabric\nof a dream.",
