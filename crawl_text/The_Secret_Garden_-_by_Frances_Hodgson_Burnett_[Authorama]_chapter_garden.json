        "When Mary Lennox was sent to Misselthwaite Manor\nto live with her uncle everybody said she was the most\ndisagreeable-looking child ever seen.  It was true, too.\nShe had a little thin face and a little thin body,\nthin light hair and a sour expression.  Her hair was yellow,\nand her face was yellow because she had been born in\nIndia and had always been ill in one way or another.\nHer father had held a position under the English\nGovernment and had always been busy and ill himself,\nand her mother had been a great beauty who cared only\nto go to parties and amuse herself with gay people.\nShe had not wanted a little girl at all, and when Mary\nwas born she handed her over to the care of an Ayah,\nwho was made to understand that if she wished to please\nthe Mem Sahib she must keep the child out of sight as much\nas possible.  So when she was a sickly, fretful, ugly little\nbaby she was kept out of the way, and when she became\na sickly, fretful, toddling thing she was kept out of\nthe way also.  She never remembered seeing familiarly\nanything but the dark faces of her Ayah and the other\nnative servants, and as they always obeyed her and gave\nher her own way in everything, because the Mem Sahib\nwould be angry if she was disturbed by her crying,\nby the time she was six years old she was as tyrannical\nand selfish a little pig as ever lived.  The young English\ngoverness who came to teach her to read and write disliked\nher so much that she gave up her place in three months,\nand when other governesses came to try to fill it they\nalways went away in a shorter time than the first one.\nSo if Mary had not chosen to really want to know how\nto read books she would never have learned her letters at all.",
        "One frightfully hot morning, when she was about nine\nyears old, she awakened feeling very cross, and she became\ncrosser still when she saw that the servant who stood\nby her bedside was not her Ayah.",
        "“Why did you come?” she said to the strange woman.\n\"I will not let you stay.  Send my Ayah to me.”",
        "The woman looked frightened, but she only stammered\nthat the Ayah could not come and when Mary threw herself\ninto a passion and beat and kicked her, she looked only\nmore frightened and repeated that it was not possible\nfor the Ayah to come to Missie Sahib.",
        "There was something mysterious in the air that morning.\nNothing was done in its regular order and several of the\nnative servants seemed missing, while those whom Mary\nsaw slunk or hurried about with ashy and scared faces.\nBut no one would tell her anything and her Ayah did not come.\nShe was actually left alone as the morning went on,\nand at last she wandered out into the garden and began\nto play by herself under a tree near the veranda.\nShe pretended that she was making a flower-bed, and she stuck\nbig scarlet hibiscus blossoms into little heaps of earth,\nall the time growing more and more angry and muttering\nto herself the things she would say and the names she\nwould call Saidie when she returned.",
        "“Pig! Pig! Daughter of Pigs!” she said, because to call\na native a pig is the worst insult of all.",
        "She was grinding her teeth and saying this over and over\nagain when she heard her mother come out on the veranda\nwith some one.  She was with a fair young man and they stood\ntalking together in low strange voices.  Mary knew the fair\nyoung man who looked like a boy.  She had heard that he\nwas a very young officer who had just come from England.\nThe child stared at him, but she stared most at her mother.\nShe always did this when she had a chance to see her,\nbecause the Mem Sahib–Mary used to call her that oftener\nthan anything else–was such a tall, slim, pretty person\nand wore such lovely clothes.  Her hair was like curly\nsilk and she had a delicate little nose which seemed\nto be disdaining things, and she had large laughing eyes.\nAll her clothes were thin and floating, and Mary said they\nwere “full of lace.” They looked fuller of lace than ever\nthis morning, but her eyes were not laughing at all.\nThey were large and scared and lifted imploringly to the fair\nboy officer’s face.",
        "“Is it so very bad? Oh, is it?” Mary heard her say.",
        "“Awfully,” the young man answered in a trembling voice.\n\"Awfully, Mrs. Lennox.  You ought to have gone to the hills\ntwo weeks ago.”",
        "The Mem Sahib wrung her hands.",
        "“Oh, I know I ought!” she cried.  “I only stayed to go\nto that silly dinner party.  What a fool I was!”",
        "At that very moment such a loud sound of wailing broke\nout from the servants’ quarters that she clutched the young\nman’s arm, and Mary stood shivering from head to foot.\nThe wailing grew wilder and wilder.  “What is it? What is it?\"\nMrs. Lennox gasped.",
        "“Some one has died,” answered the boy officer.  “You did\nnot say it had broken out among your servants.”",
        "“I did not know!” the Mem Sahib cried.  “Come with me!\nCome with me!” and she turned and ran into the house.",
        "After that, appalling things happened, and the mysteriousness\nof the morning was explained to Mary.  The cholera had\nbroken out in its most fatal form and people were dying\nlike flies.  The Ayah had been taken ill in the night,\nand it was because she had just died that the servants\nhad wailed in the huts.  Before the next day three other\nservants were dead and others had run away in terror.\nThere was panic on every side, and dying people in all\nthe bungalows.",
        "During the confusion and bewilderment of the second day Mary\nhid herself in the nursery and was forgotten by everyone.\nNobody thought of her, nobody wanted her, and strange things\nhappened of which she knew nothing.  Mary alternately cried\nand slept through the hours.  She only knew that people were\nill and that she heard mysterious and frightening sounds.\nOnce she crept into the dining-room and found it empty,\nthough a partly finished meal was on the table and chairs\nand plates looked as if they had been hastily pushed\nback when the diners rose suddenly for some reason.\nThe child ate some fruit and biscuits, and being thirsty\nshe drank a glass of wine which stood nearly filled.\nIt was sweet, and she did not know how strong it was.\nVery soon it made her intensely drowsy, and she went back\nto her nursery and shut herself in again, frightened by cries\nshe heard in the huts and by the hurrying sound of feet.\nThe wine made her so sleepy that she could scarcely keep her\neyes open and she lay down on her bed and knew nothing more\nfor a long time.",
        "Many things happened during the hours in which she slept\nso heavily, but she was not disturbed by the wails and the\nsound of things being carried in and out of the bungalow.",
        "When she awakened she lay and stared at the wall.\nThe house was perfectly still.  She had never known\nit to be so silent before.  She heard neither voices\nnor footsteps, and wondered if everybody had got well of\nthe cholera and all the trouble was over.  She wondered\nalso who would take care of her now her Ayah was dead.\nThere would be a new Ayah, and perhaps she would know\nsome new stories.  Mary had been rather tired of the\nold ones.  She did not cry because her nurse had died.\nShe was not an affectionate child and had never cared much\nfor any one.  The noise and hurrying about and wailing\nover the cholera had frightened her, and she had been angry\nbecause no one seemed to remember that she was alive.\nEveryone was too panic-stricken to think of a little\ngirl no one was fond of.  When people had the cholera\nit seemed that they remembered nothing but themselves.\nBut if everyone had got well again, surely some one would\nremember and come to look for her.",
        "But no one came, and as she lay waiting the house seemed\nto grow more and more silent.  She heard something rustling\non the matting and when she looked down she saw a little\nsnake gliding along and watching her with eyes like jewels.\nShe was not frightened, because he was a harmless little\nthing who would not hurt her and he seemed in a hurry\nto get out of the room.  He slipped under the door as she\nwatched him.",
        "“How queer and quiet it is,” she said.  “It sounds as\nif there were no one in the bungalow but me and the snake.”",
        "Almost the next minute she heard footsteps in the compound,\nand then on the veranda.  They were men’s footsteps,\nand the men entered the bungalow and talked in low voices.\nNo one went to meet or speak to them and they seemed\nto open doors and look into rooms.  “What desolation!\"\nshe heard one voice say.  “That pretty, pretty woman!\nI suppose the child, too.  I heard there was a child,\nthough no one ever saw her.”",
        "Mary was standing in the middle of the nursery when they\nopened the door a few minutes later.  She looked an ugly,\ncross little thing and was frowning because she was\nbeginning to be hungry and feel disgracefully neglected.\nThe first man who came in was a large officer she had once\nseen talking to her father.  He looked tired and troubled,\nbut when he saw her he was so startled that he almost\njumped back.",
        "“Barney!” he cried out.  “There is a child here! A child\nalone! In a place like this! Mercy on us, who is she!”",
        "“I am Mary Lennox,” the little girl said, drawing herself\nup stiffly.  She thought the man was very rude to call her\nfather’s bungalow “A place like this!” “I fell asleep when\neveryone had the cholera and I have only just wakened up.\nWhy does nobody come?”",
        "“It is the child no one ever saw!” exclaimed the man,\nturning to his companions.  “She has actually been forgotten!”",
        "“Why was I forgotten?” Mary said, stamping her foot.\n\"Why does nobody come?”",
        "The young man whose name was Barney looked at her very sadly.\nMary even thought she saw him wink his eyes as if to wink\ntears away.",
        "“Poor little kid!” he said.  “There is nobody left to come.”",
        "It was in that strange and sudden way that Mary found\nout that she had neither father nor mother left;\nthat they had died and been carried away in the night,\nand that the few native servants who had not died also had\nleft the house as quickly as they could get out of it,\nnone of them even remembering that there was a Missie Sahib.\nThat was why the place was so quiet.  It was true that there\nwas no one in the bungalow but herself and the little\nrustling snake.",
        "Mary had liked to look at her mother from a distance\nand she had thought her very pretty, but as she knew\nvery little of her she could scarcely have been expected\nto love her or to miss her very much when she was gone.\nShe did not miss her at all, in fact, and as she was a\nself-absorbed child she gave her entire thought to herself,\nas she had always done.  If she had been older she would\nno doubt have been very anxious at being left alone in\nthe world, but she was very young, and as she had always\nbeen taken care of, she supposed she always would be.\nWhat she thought was that she would like to know if she was\ngoing to nice people, who would be polite to her and give\nher her own way as her Ayah and the other native servants\nhad done.",
        "She knew that she was not going to stay at the English\nclergyman’s house where she was taken at first.  She did\nnot want to stay.  The English clergyman was poor and he\nhad five children nearly all the same age and they wore\nshabby clothes and were always quarreling and snatching\ntoys from each other.  Mary hated their untidy bungalow\nand was so disagreeable to them that after the first day\nor two nobody would play with her.  By the second day\nthey had given her a nickname which made her furious.",
        "It was Basil who thought of it first.  Basil was a little\nboy with impudent blue eyes and a turned-up nose, and Mary\nhated him.  She was playing by herself under a tree,\njust as she had been playing the day the cholera broke out.\nShe was making heaps of earth and paths for a garden\nand Basil came and stood near to watch her.  Presently he\ngot rather interested and suddenly made a suggestion.",
        "“Why don’t you put a heap of stones there and pretend\nit is a rockery?” he said.  “There in the middle,\"\nand he leaned over her to point.",
        "“Go away!” cried Mary.  “I don’t want boys.  Go away!”",
        "For a moment Basil looked angry, and then he began to tease.\nHe was always teasing his sisters.  He danced round\nand round her and made faces and sang and laughed.",
        "         “Mistress Mary, quite contrary,\n          How does your garden grow?\n          With silver bells, and cockle shells,\n          And marigolds all in a row.”",
        "He sang it until the other children heard and laughed, too;\nand the crosser Mary got, the more they sang “Mistress Mary,\nquite contrary\"; and after that as long as she stayed\nwith them they called her “Mistress Mary Quite Contrary\"\nwhen they spoke of her to each other, and often when they\nspoke to her.",
        "“You are going to be sent home,” Basil said to her,\n\"at the end of the week.  And we’re glad of it.”",
        "“I am glad of it, too,” answered Mary.  “Where is home?”",
        "“She doesn’t know where home is!” said Basil,\nwith seven-year-old scorn.  “It’s England, of course.\nOur grandmama lives there and our sister Mabel was sent\nto her last year.  You are not going to your grandmama.\nYou have none.  You are going to your uncle.  His name is\nMr. Archibald Craven.”",
        "“I don’t know anything about him,” snapped Mary.",
        "“I know you don’t,” Basil answered.  “You don’t know anything.\nGirls never do.  I heard father and mother talking about him.\nHe lives in a great, big, desolate old house in the\ncountry and no one goes near him.  He’s so cross he won’t\nlet them, and they wouldn’t come if he would let them.\nHe’s a hunchback, and he’s horrid.” “I don’t believe you,\"\nsaid Mary; and she turned her back and stuck her fingers\nin her ears, because she would not listen any more.",
        "But she thought over it a great deal afterward; and when\nMrs. Crawford told her that night that she was going\nto sail away to England in a few days and go to her uncle,\nMr. Archibald Craven, who lived at Misselthwaite Manor,\nshe looked so stony and stubbornly uninterested that\nthey did not know what to think about her.  They tried\nto be kind to her, but she only turned her face away\nwhen Mrs. Crawford attempted to kiss her, and held\nherself stiffly when Mr. Crawford patted her shoulder.",
        "“She is such a plain child,” Mrs. Crawford said pityingly,\nafterward.  “And her mother was such a pretty creature.\nShe had a very pretty manner, too, and Mary has the most\nunattractive ways I ever saw in a child.  The children\ncall her `Mistress Mary Quite Contrary,’ and though\nit’s naughty of them, one can’t help understanding it.”",
        "“Perhaps if her mother had carried her pretty face\nand her pretty manners oftener into the nursery Mary\nmight have learned some pretty ways too.  It is very sad,\nnow the poor beautiful thing is gone, to remember that\nmany people never even knew that she had a child at all.”",
        "“I believe she scarcely ever looked at her,\"\nsighed Mrs. Crawford.  “When her Ayah was dead there\nwas no one to give a thought to the little thing.\nThink of the servants running away and leaving her all\nalone in that deserted bungalow.  Colonel McGrew said he\nnearly jumped out of his skin when he opened the door\nand found her standing by herself in the middle of the room.”",
        "Mary made the long voyage to England under the care of\nan officer’s wife, who was taking her children to leave\nthem in a boarding-school. She was very much absorbed\nin her own little boy and girl, and was rather glad to hand\nthe child over to the woman Mr. Archibald Craven sent\nto meet her, in London.  The woman was his housekeeper\nat Misselthwaite Manor, and her name was Mrs. Medlock.\nShe was a stout woman, with very red cheeks and sharp\nblack eyes.  She wore a very purple dress, a black\nsilk mantle with jet fringe on it and a black bonnet\nwith purple velvet flowers which stuck up and trembled\nwhen she moved her head.  Mary did not like her at all,\nbut as she very seldom liked people there was nothing\nremarkable in that; besides which it was very evident\nMrs. Medlock did not think much of her.",
        "“My word! she’s a plain little piece of goods!” she said.\n\"And we’d heard that her mother was a beauty.  She hasn’t\nhanded much of it down, has she, ma’am?” “Perhaps she\nwill improve as she grows older,” the officer’s wife\nsaid good-naturedly. “If she were not so sallow and had\na nicer expression, her features are rather good.\nChildren alter so much.”",
        "“She’ll have to alter a good deal,” answered Mrs. Medlock.\n\"And, there’s nothing likely to improve children at\nMisselthwaite–if you ask me!” They thought Mary was not\nlistening because she was standing a little apart from them\nat the window of the private hotel they had gone to.\nShe was watching the passing buses and cabs and people,\nbut she heard quite well and was made very curious about\nher uncle and the place he lived in.  What sort of a place\nwas it, and what would he be like? What was a hunchback?\nShe had never seen one.  Perhaps there were none in India.",
        "Since she had been living in other people’s houses\nand had had no Ayah, she had begun to feel lonely\nand to think queer thoughts which were new to her.\nShe had begun to wonder why she had never seemed to belong\nto anyone even when her father and mother had been alive.\nOther children seemed to belong to their fathers and mothers,\nbut she had never seemed to really be anyone’s little girl.\nShe had had servants, and food and clothes, but no one\nhad taken any notice of her.  She did not know that this\nwas because she was a disagreeable child; but then,\nof course, she did not know she was disagreeable.\nShe often thought that other people were, but she did not\nknow that she was so herself.",
        "She thought Mrs. Medlock the most disagreeable person\nshe had ever seen, with her common, highly colored face\nand her common fine bonnet.  When the next day they set\nout on their journey to Yorkshire, she walked through\nthe station to the railway carriage with her head up\nand trying to keep as far away from her as she could,\nbecause she did not want to seem to belong to her.\nIt would have made her angry to think people imagined she\nwas her little girl.",
        "But Mrs. Medlock was not in the least disturbed by her\nand her thoughts.  She was the kind of woman who would\n\"stand no nonsense from young ones.” At least, that is\nwhat she would have said if she had been asked.  She had\nnot wanted to go to London just when her sister Maria’s\ndaughter was going to be married, but she had a comfortable,\nwell paid place as housekeeper at Misselthwaite Manor\nand the only way in which she could keep it was to do\nat once what Mr. Archibald Craven told her to do.\nShe never dared even to ask a question.",
        "“Captain Lennox and his wife died of the cholera,\"\nMr. Craven had said in his short, cold way.  “Captain Lennox\nwas my wife’s brother and I am their daughter’s guardian.\nThe child is to be brought here.  You must go to London\nand bring her yourself.”",
        "So she packed her small trunk and made the journey.",
        "Mary sat in her corner of the railway carriage and looked\nplain and fretful.  She had nothing to read or to look at,\nand she had folded her thin little black-gloved hands in\nher lap.  Her black dress made her look yellower than ever,\nand her limp light hair straggled from under her black\ncrepe hat.",
        "“A more marred-looking young one I never saw in my life,\"\nMrs. Medlock thought.  (Marred is a Yorkshire word and\nmeans spoiled and pettish.) She had never seen a child\nwho sat so still without doing anything; and at last she\ngot tired of watching her and began to talk in a brisk,\nhard voice.",
        "“I suppose I may as well tell you something about where\nyou are going to,” she said.  “Do you know anything\nabout your uncle?”",
        "“No,” said Mary.",
        "“Never heard your father and mother talk about him?”",
        "“No,” said Mary frowning.  She frowned because she\nremembered that her father and mother had never talked\nto her about anything in particular.  Certainly they\nhad never told her things.",
        "“Humph,” muttered Mrs. Medlock, staring at her queer,\nunresponsive little face.  She did not say any more for\na few moments and then she began again.",
        "“I suppose you might as well be told something–to\nprepare you.  You are going to a queer place.”",
        "Mary said nothing at all, and Mrs. Medlock looked rather\ndiscomfited by her apparent indifference, but, after taking\na breath, she went on.",
        "“Not but that it’s a grand big place in a gloomy way,\nand Mr. Craven’s proud of it in his way–and that’s\ngloomy enough, too.  The house is six hundred years old\nand it’s on the edge of the moor, and there’s near a hundred\nrooms in it, though most of them’s shut up and locked.\nAnd there’s pictures and fine old furniture and things\nthat’s been there for ages, and there’s a big park round\nit and gardens and trees with branches trailing to the\nground–some of them.” She paused and took another breath.\n\"But there’s nothing else,” she ended suddenly.",
        "Mary had begun to listen in spite of herself.  It all sounded\nso unlike India, and anything new rather attracted her.\nBut she did not intend to look as if she were interested.\nThat was one of her unhappy, disagreeable ways.  So she\nsat still.",
        "“Well,” said Mrs. Medlock.  “What do you think of it?”",
        "“Nothing,” she answered.  “I know nothing about such places.”",
        "That made Mrs. Medlock laugh a short sort of laugh.",
        "“Eh!” she said, “but you are like an old woman.\nDon’t you care?”",
        "“It doesn’t matter” said Mary, “whether I care or not.”",
        "“You are right enough there,” said Mrs. Medlock.\n\"It doesn’t. What you’re to be kept at Misselthwaite Manor\nfor I don’t know, unless because it’s the easiest way.\nHe’s not going to trouble himself about you, that’s sure\nand certain.  He never troubles himself about no one.”",
        "She stopped herself as if she had just remembered something\nin time.",
        "“He’s got a crooked back,” she said.  “That set him wrong.\nHe was a sour young man and got no good of all his money\nand big place till he was married.”",
        "Mary’s eyes turned toward her in spite of her intention\nnot to seem to care.  She had never thought of the\nhunchback’s being married and she was a trifle surprised.\nMrs. Medlock saw this, and as she was a talkative woman\nshe continued with more interest.  This was one way\nof passing some of the time, at any rate.",
        "“She was a sweet, pretty thing and he’d have walked\nthe world over to get her a blade o’ grass she wanted.\nNobody thought she’d marry him, but she did,\nand people said she married him for his money.\nBut she didn’t–she didn’t,” positively.  “When she died–”",
        "Mary gave a little involuntary jump.",
        "“Oh! did she die!” she exclaimed, quite without meaning to.\nShe had just remembered a French fairy story she had once\nread called “Riquet a la Houppe.” It had been about a poor\nhunchback and a beautiful princess and it had made her\nsuddenly sorry for Mr. Archibald Craven.",
        "“Yes, she died,” Mrs. Medlock answered.  “And it\nmade him queerer than ever.  He cares about nobody.\nHe won’t see people.  Most of the time he goes away,\nand when he is at Misselthwaite he shuts himself up in\nthe West Wing and won’t let any one but Pitcher see him.\nPitcher’s an old fellow, but he took care of him when he\nwas a child and he knows his ways.”",
        "It sounded like something in a book and it did not make\nMary feel cheerful.  A house with a hundred rooms,\nnearly all shut up and with their doors locked–a house on\nthe edge of a moor–whatsoever a moor was–sounded dreary.\nA man with a crooked back who shut himself up also! She\nstared out of the window with her lips pinched together,\nand it seemed quite natural that the rain should have begun\nto pour down in gray slanting lines and splash and stream\ndown the window-panes. If the pretty wife had been alive\nshe might have made things cheerful by being something\nlike her own mother and by running in and out and going\nto parties as she had done in frocks “full of lace.\"\nBut she was not there any more.",
        "“You needn’t expect to see him, because ten to one you won’t,\"\nsaid Mrs. Medlock.  “And you mustn’t expect that there\nwill be people to talk to you.  You’ll have to play\nabout and look after yourself.  You’ll be told what rooms\nyou can go into and what rooms you’re to keep out of.\nThere’s gardens enough.  But when you’re in the house\ndon’t go wandering and poking about.  Mr. Craven won’t\nhave it.”",
        "“I shall not want to go poking about,” said sour little\nMary and just as suddenly as she had begun to be rather\nsorry for Mr. Archibald Craven she began to cease to be\nsorry and to think he was unpleasant enough to deserve\nall that had happened to him.",
        "And she turned her face toward the streaming panes of the\nwindow of the railway carriage and gazed out at the gray\nrain-storm which looked as if it would go on forever and ever.\nShe watched it so long and steadily that the grayness\ngrew heavier and heavier before her eyes and she fell asleep.",
        "She slept a long time, and when she awakened Mrs. Medlock\nhad bought a lunchbasket at one of the stations and they\nhad some chicken and cold beef and bread and butter and\nsome hot tea.  The rain seemed to be streaming down more\nheavily than ever and everybody in the station wore wet\nand glistening waterproofs.  The guard lighted the lamps\nin the carriage, and Mrs. Medlock cheered up very much\nover her tea and chicken and beef.  She ate a great deal\nand afterward fell asleep herself, and Mary sat and stared\nat her and watched her fine bonnet slip on one side until she\nherself fell asleep once more in the corner of the carriage,\nlulled by the splashing of the rain against the windows.\nIt was quite dark when she awakened again.  The train\nhad stopped at a station and Mrs. Medlock was shaking her.",
        "“You have had a sleep!” she said.  “It’s time to open\nyour eyes! We’re at Thwaite Station and we’ve got a long\ndrive before us.”",
        "Mary stood up and tried to keep her eyes open while\nMrs. Medlock collected her parcels.  The little\ngirl did not offer to help her, because in India\nnative servants always picked up or carried things\nand it seemed quite proper that other people should wait on one.",
        "The station was a small one and nobody but themselves\nseemed to be getting out of the train.  The station-master\nspoke to Mrs. Medlock in a rough, good-natured way,\npronouncing his words in a queer broad fashion which Mary\nfound out afterward was Yorkshire.",
        "“I see tha’s got back,” he said.  “An’ tha’s browt th’\nyoung ’un with thee.”",
        "“Aye, that’s her,” answered Mrs. Medlock, speaking with\na Yorkshire accent herself and jerking her head over\nher shoulder toward Mary.  “How’s thy Missus?”",
        "“Well enow.  Th’ carriage is waitin’ outside for thee.”",
        "A brougham stood on the road before the little\noutside platform.  Mary saw that it was a smart carriage\nand that it was a smart footman who helped her in.\nHis long waterproof coat and the waterproof covering of his\nhat were shining and dripping with rain as everything was,\nthe burly station-master included.",
        "When he shut the door, mounted the box with the coachman,\nand they drove off, the little girl found herself seated\nin a comfortably cushioned corner, but she was not inclined\nto go to sleep again.  She sat and looked out of the window,\ncurious to see something of the road over which she\nwas being driven to the queer place Mrs. Medlock had\nspoken of.  She was not at all a timid child and she was\nnot exactly frightened, but she felt that there was no\nknowing what might happen in a house with a hundred rooms\nnearly all shut up–a house standing on the edge of a moor.",
        "“What is a moor?” she said suddenly to Mrs. Medlock.",
        "“Look out of the window in about ten minutes and you’ll see,\"\nthe woman answered.  “We’ve got to drive five miles across\nMissel Moor before we get to the Manor.  You won’t see\nmuch because it’s a dark night, but you can see something.”",
        "Mary asked no more questions but waited in the darkness\nof her corner, keeping her eyes on the window.  The carriage\nlamps cast rays of light a little distance ahead of them\nand she caught glimpses of the things they passed.\nAfter they had left the station they had driven through a\ntiny village and she had seen whitewashed cottages and the\nlights of a public house.  Then they had passed a church\nand a vicarage and a little shop-window or so in a cottage\nwith toys and sweets and odd things set our for sale.\nThen they were on the highroad and she saw hedges and trees.\nAfter that there seemed nothing different for a long\ntime–or at least it seemed a long time to her.",
        "At last the horses began to go more slowly, as if they\nwere climbing up-hill, and presently there seemed to be\nno more hedges and no more trees.  She could see nothing,\nin fact, but a dense darkness on either side.  She leaned\nforward and pressed her face against the window just\nas the carriage gave a big jolt.",
        "“Eh! We’re on the moor now sure enough,” said Mrs. Medlock.",
        "The carriage lamps shed a yellow light on a rough-looking\nroad which seemed to be cut through bushes and low-growing\nthings which ended in the great expanse of dark apparently\nspread out before and around them.  A wind was rising\nand making a singular, wild, low, rushing sound.",
        "“It’s–it’s not the sea, is it?” said Mary, looking round\nat her companion.",
        "“No, not it,” answered Mrs. Medlock.  “Nor it isn’t fields\nnor mountains, it’s just miles and miles and miles of wild\nland that nothing grows on but heather and gorse and broom,\nand nothing lives on but wild ponies and sheep.”",
        "“I feel as if it might be the sea, if there were water\non it,” said Mary.  “It sounds like the sea just now.”",
        "“That’s the wind blowing through the bushes,” Mrs. Medlock said.\n\"It’s a wild, dreary enough place to my mind, though there’s\nplenty that likes it–particularly when the heather’s in bloom.”",
        "On and on they drove through the darkness, and though\nthe rain stopped, the wind rushed by and whistled and made\nstrange sounds.  The road went up and down, and several\ntimes the carriage passed over a little bridge beneath\nwhich water rushed very fast with a great deal of noise.\nMary felt as if the drive would never come to an end\nand that the wide, bleak moor was a wide expanse of black\nocean through which she was passing on a strip of dry land.",
        "“I don’t like it,” she said to herself.  “I don’t like it,\"\nand she pinched her thin lips more tightly together.",
        "The horses were climbing up a hilly piece of road\nwhen she first caught sight of a light.  Mrs. Medlock\nsaw it as soon as she did and drew a long sigh of relief.",
        "“Eh, I am glad to see that bit o’ light twinkling,\"\nshe exclaimed.  “It’s the light in the lodge window.\nWe shall get a good cup of tea after a bit, at all events.”",
        "It was “after a bit,” as she said, for when the carriage\npassed through the park gates there was still two miles\nof avenue to drive through and the trees (which nearly\nmet overhead) made it seem as if they were driving\nthrough a long dark vault.",
        "They drove out of the vault into a clear space\nand stopped before an immensely long but low-built\nhouse which seemed to ramble round a stone court.\nAt first Mary thought that there were no lights at all\nin the windows, but as she got out of the carriage\nshe saw that one room in a corner upstairs showed a dull glow.",
        "The entrance door was a huge one made of massive, curiously\nshaped panels of oak studded with big iron nails and bound\nwith great iron bars.  It opened into an enormous hall,\nwhich was so dimly lighted that the faces in the portraits\non the walls and the figures in the suits of armor\nmade Mary feel that she did not want to look at them.\nAs she stood on the stone floor she looked a very small,\nodd little black figure, and she felt as small and lost\nand odd as she looked.",
        "A neat, thin old man stood near the manservant who opened\nthe door for them.",
        "“You are to take her to her room,” he said in a husky voice.\n\"He doesn’t want to see her.  He’s going to London\nin the morning.”",
        "“Very well, Mr. Pitcher,” Mrs. Medlock answered.\n\"So long as I know what’s expected of me, I can manage.”",
        "“What’s expected of you, Mrs. Medlock,” Mr. Pitcher said,\n\"is that you make sure that he’s not disturbed and that he\ndoesn’t see what he doesn’t want to see.”",
        "And then Mary Lennox was led up a broad staircase\nand down a long corridor and up a short flight\nof steps and through another corridor and another,\nuntil a door opened in a wall and she found herself\nin a room with a fire in it and a supper on a table.",
        "Mrs. Medlock said unceremoniously:",
        "“Well, here you are! This room and the next are where you’ll\nlive–and you must keep to them.  Don’t you forget that!”",
        "It was in this way Mistress Mary arrived at Misselthwaite\nManor and she had perhaps never felt quite so contrary\nin all her life.",
        "When she opened her eyes in the morning it was because\na young housemaid had come into her room to light\nthe fire and was kneeling on the hearth-rug raking\nout the cinders noisily.  Mary lay and watched her for\na few moments and then began to look about the room.\nShe had never seen a room at all like it and thought it\ncurious and gloomy.  The walls were covered with tapestry\nwith a forest scene embroidered on it.  There were\nfantastically dressed people under the trees and in the\ndistance there was a glimpse of the turrets of a castle.\nThere were hunters and horses and dogs and ladies.\nMary felt as if she were in the forest with them.\nOut of a deep window she could see a great climbing\nstretch of land which seemed to have no trees on it,\nand to look rather like an endless, dull, purplish sea.",
        "“What is that?” she said, pointing out of the window.",
        "Martha, the young housemaid, who had just risen to her feet,\nlooked and pointed also.  “That there?” she said.",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“That’s th’ moor,” with a good-natured grin.  “Does tha’\nlike it?”",
        "“No,” answered Mary.  “I hate it.”",
        "“That’s because tha’rt not used to it,” Martha said,\ngoing back to her hearth.  “Tha’ thinks it’s too big an’\nbare now.  But tha’ will like it.”",
        "“Do you?” inquired Mary.",
        "“Aye, that I do,” answered Martha, cheerfully polishing\naway at the grate.  “I just love it.  It’s none bare.\nIt’s covered wi’ growin’ things as smells sweet.\nIt’s fair lovely in spring an’ summer when th’ gorse an’\nbroom an’ heather’s in flower.  It smells o’ honey an’\nthere’s such a lot o’ fresh air–an’ th’ sky looks\nso high an’ th’ bees an’ skylarks makes such a nice\nnoise hummin’ an’ singin’. Eh! I wouldn’t live away from th’\nmoor for anythin’.”",
        "Mary listened to her with a grave, puzzled expression.\nThe native servants she had been used to in India\nwere not in the least like this.  They were obsequious\nand servile and did not presume to talk to their masters\nas if they were their equals.  They made salaams and called\nthem “protector of the poor” and names of that sort.\nIndian servants were commanded to do things, not asked.\nIt was not the custom to say “please” and “thank you\"\nand Mary had always slapped her Ayah in the face when she\nwas angry.  She wondered a little what this girl would\ndo if one slapped her in the face.  She was a round,\nrosy, good-natured-looking creature, but she had a sturdy\nway which made Mistress Mary wonder if she might not\neven slap back–if the person who slapped her was only a\nlittle girl.",
        "“You are a strange servant,” she said from her pillows,\nrather haughtily.",
        "Martha sat up on her heels, with her blacking-brush in her hand,\nand laughed, without seeming the least out of temper.",
        "“Eh! I know that,” she said.  “If there was a grand Missus\nat Misselthwaite I should never have been even one of th’\nunder house-maids. I might have been let to be scullerymaid\nbut I’d never have been let upstairs.  I’m too common an’\nI talk too much Yorkshire.  But this is a funny house for\nall it’s so grand.  Seems like there’s neither Master nor\nMistress except Mr. Pitcher an’ Mrs. Medlock.  Mr. Craven,\nhe won’t be troubled about anythin’ when he’s here, an’\nhe’s nearly always away.  Mrs. Medlock gave me th’\nplace out o’ kindness.  She told me she could never have\ndone it if Misselthwaite had been like other big houses.\"\n\"Are you going to be my servant?” Mary asked, still in her\nimperious little Indian way.",
        "Martha began to rub her grate again.",
        "“I’m Mrs. Medlock’s servant,” she said stoutly.\n\"An’ she’s Mr. Craven’s–but I’m to do the housemaid’s\nwork up here an’ wait on you a bit.  But you won’t need\nmuch waitin’ on.”",
        "“Who is going to dress me?” demanded Mary.",
        "Martha sat up on her heels again and stared.  She spoke\nin broad Yorkshire in her amazement.",
        "“Canna’ tha’ dress thysen!” she said.",
        "“What do you mean? I don’t understand your language,\"\nsaid Mary.",
        "“Eh! I forgot,” Martha said.  “Mrs. Medlock told me I’d\nhave to be careful or you wouldn’t know what I was sayin’.\nI mean can’t you put on your own clothes?”",
        "“No,” answered Mary, quite indignantly.  “I never did\nin my life.  My Ayah dressed me, of course.”",
        "“Well,” said Martha, evidently not in the least aware\nthat she was impudent, “it’s time tha’ should learn.\nTha’ cannot begin younger.  It’ll do thee good to wait\non thysen a bit.  My mother always said she couldn’t\nsee why grand people’s children didn’t turn out fair\nfools–what with nurses an’ bein’ washed an’ dressed an’\ntook out to walk as if they was puppies!”",
        "“It is different in India,” said Mistress Mary disdainfully.\nShe could scarcely stand this.",
        "But Martha was not at all crushed.",
        "“Eh! I can see it’s different,” she answered almost\nsympathetically.  “I dare say it’s because there’s such\na lot o’ blacks there instead o’ respectable white people.\nWhen I heard you was comin’ from India I thought you was a black\ntoo.”",
        "Mary sat up in bed furious.",
        "“What!” she said.  “What! You thought I was a native.\nYou–you daughter of a pig!”",
        "Martha stared and looked hot.",
        "“Who are you callin’ names?” she said.  “You needn’t be\nso vexed.  That’s not th’ way for a young lady to talk.\nI’ve nothin’ against th’ blacks.  When you read about ’em\nin tracts they’re always very religious.  You always read\nas a black’s a man an’ a brother.  I’ve never seen a black an’\nI was fair pleased to think I was goin’ to see one close.\nWhen I come in to light your fire this mornin’ I crep’\nup to your bed an’ pulled th’ cover back careful to look\nat you.  An’ there you was,” disappointedly, “no more black\nthan me–for all you’re so yeller.”",
        "Mary did not even try to control her rage and humiliation.\n\"You thought I was a native! You dared! You don’t know\nanything about natives! They are not people–they’re servants\nwho must salaam to you.  You know nothing about India.\nYou know nothing about anything!”",
        "She was in such a rage and felt so helpless before the girl’s\nsimple stare, and somehow she suddenly felt so horribly\nlonely and far away from everything she understood\nand which understood her, that she threw herself face\ndownward on the pillows and burst into passionate sobbing.\nShe sobbed so unrestrainedly that good-natured Yorkshire\nMartha was a little frightened and quite sorry for her.\nShe went to the bed and bent over her.",
        "“Eh! you mustn’t cry like that there!” she begged.\n\"You mustn’t for sure.  I didn’t know you’d be vexed.\nI don’t know anythin’ about anythin’–just like you said.\nI beg your pardon, Miss. Do stop cryin’.”",
        "There was something comforting and really friendly in her\nqueer Yorkshire speech and sturdy way which had a good effect\non Mary.  She gradually ceased crying and became quiet.\nMartha looked relieved.",
        "“It’s time for thee to get up now,” she said.\n\"Mrs. Medlock said I was to carry tha’ breakfast an’\ntea an’ dinner into th’ room next to this.  It’s been\nmade into a nursery for thee.  I’ll help thee on with thy\nclothes if tha’ll get out o’ bed.  If th’ buttons are at th’\nback tha’ cannot button them up tha’self.”",
        "When Mary at last decided to get up, the clothes Martha\ntook from the wardrobe were not the ones she had worn\nwhen she arrived the night before with Mrs. Medlock.",
        "“Those are not mine,” she said.  “Mine are black.”",
        "She looked the thick white wool coat and dress over,\nand added with cool approval:",
        "“Those are nicer than mine.”",
        "“These are th’ ones tha’ must put on,” Martha answered.\n\"Mr. Craven ordered Mrs. Medlock to get ’em in London.\nHe said `I won’t have a child dressed in black wanderin’\nabout like a lost soul,’ he said.  `It’d make the place\nsadder than it is.  Put color on her.’ Mother she said she\nknew what he meant.  Mother always knows what a body means.\nShe doesn’t hold with black hersel’.”",
        "“I hate black things,” said Mary.",
        "The dressing process was one which taught them both something.\nMartha had “buttoned up” her little sisters and brothers but she\nhad never seen a child who stood still and waited for another\nperson to do things for her as if she had neither hands nor feet\nof her own.",
        "“Why doesn’t tha’ put on tha’ own shoes?” she said\nwhen Mary quietly held out her foot.",
        "“My Ayah did it,” answered Mary, staring.  “It was the custom.”",
        "She said that very often–\"It was the custom.” The native\nservants were always saying it.  If one told them to do\na thing their ancestors had not done for a thousand years\nthey gazed at one mildly and said, “It is not the custom\"\nand one knew that was the end of the matter.",
        "It had not been the custom that Mistress Mary should\ndo anything but stand and allow herself to be dressed\nlike a doll, but before she was ready for breakfast she\nbegan to suspect that her life at Misselthwaite Manor\nwould end by teaching her a number of things quite\nnew to her–things such as putting on her own shoes\nand stockings, and picking up things she let fall.\nIf Martha had been a well-trained fine young lady’s maid\nshe would have been more subservient and respectful and\nwould have known that it was her business to brush hair,\nand button boots, and pick things up and lay them away.\nShe was, however, only an untrained Yorkshire rustic\nwho had been brought up in a moorland cottage with a\nswarm of little brothers and sisters who had never\ndreamed of doing anything but waiting on themselves\nand on the younger ones who were either babies in arms\nor just learning to totter about and tumble over things.",
        "If Mary Lennox had been a child who was ready to be amused\nshe would perhaps have laughed at Martha’s readiness to talk,\nbut Mary only listened to her coldly and wondered at her\nfreedom of manner.  At first she was not at all interested,\nbut gradually, as the girl rattled on in her good-tempered,\nhomely way, Mary began to notice what she was saying.",
        "“Eh! you should see ’em all,” she said.  “There’s twelve\nof us an’ my father only gets sixteen shilling a week.  I can\ntell you my mother’s put to it to get porridge for ’em all.\nThey tumble about on th’ moor an’ play there all day an’\nmother says th’ air of th’ moor fattens ’em. She says she\nbelieves they eat th’ grass same as th’ wild ponies do.\nOur Dickon, he’s twelve years old and he’s got a young pony\nhe calls his own.”",
        "“Where did he get it?” asked Mary.",
        "“He found it on th’ moor with its mother when it was\na little one an’ he began to make friends with it an’\ngive it bits o’ bread an’ pluck young grass for it.\nAnd it got to like him so it follows him about an’\nit lets him get on its back.  Dickon’s a kind lad an’\nanimals likes him.”",
        "Mary had never possessed an animal pet of her own\nand had always thought she should like one.  So she\nbegan to feel a slight interest in Dickon, and as she\nhad never before been interested in any one but herself,\nit was the dawning of a healthy sentiment.  When she went\ninto the room which had been made into a nursery for her,\nshe found that it was rather like the one she had slept in.\nIt was not a child’s room, but a grown-up person’s room,\nwith gloomy old pictures on the walls and heavy old\noak chairs.  A table in the center was set with a good\nsubstantial breakfast.  But she had always had a very\nsmall appetite, and she looked with something more than\nindifference at the first plate Martha set before her.",
        "“I don’t want it,” she said.",
        "“Tha’ doesn’t want thy porridge!” Martha exclaimed incredulously.",
        "“No.”",
        "“Tha’ doesn’t know how good it is.  Put a bit o’\ntreacle on it or a bit o’ sugar.”",
        "“I don’t want it,” repeated Mary.",
        "“Eh!” said Martha.  “I can’t abide to see good victuals\ngo to waste.  If our children was at this table they’d\nclean it bare in five minutes.”",
        "“Why?” said Mary coldly.  “Why!” echoed Martha.  “Because they\nscarce ever had their stomachs full in their lives.\nThey’re as hungry as young hawks an’ foxes.”",
        "“I don’t know what it is to be hungry,” said Mary,\nwith the indifference of ignorance.",
        "Martha looked indignant.",
        "“Well, it would do thee good to try it.  I can see\nthat plain enough,” she said outspokenly.  “I’ve no\npatience with folk as sits an’ just stares at good\nbread an’ meat.  My word! don’t I wish Dickon and Phil an’\nJane an’ th’ rest of ’em had what’s here under their pinafores.”",
        "“Why don’t you take it to them?” suggested Mary.",
        "“It’s not mine,” answered Martha stoutly.  “An’ this\nisn’t my day out.  I get my day out once a month same\nas th’ rest.  Then I go home an’ clean up for mother an’\ngive her a day’s rest.”",
        "Mary drank some tea and ate a little toast and some marmalade.",
        "“You wrap up warm an’ run out an’ play you,” said Martha.\n\"It’ll do you good and give you some stomach for your meat.”",
        "Mary went to the window.  There were gardens and paths\nand big trees, but everything looked dull and wintry.",
        "“Out? Why should I go out on a day like this?” “Well, if tha’\ndoesn’t go out tha’lt have to stay in, an’ what has tha’\ngot to do?”",
        "Mary glanced about her.  There was nothing to do.\nWhen Mrs. Medlock had prepared the nursery she had not\nthought of amusement.  Perhaps it would be better to go\nand see what the gardens were like.",
        "“Who will go with me?” she inquired.",
        "Martha stared.",
        "“You’ll go by yourself,” she answered.  “You’ll have to\nlearn to play like other children does when they haven’t\ngot sisters and brothers.  Our Dickon goes off on th’\nmoor by himself an’ plays for hours.  That’s how he made\nfriends with th’ pony.  He’s got sheep on th’ moor that\nknows him, an’ birds as comes an’ eats out of his hand.\nHowever little there is to eat, he always saves a bit o’\nhis bread to coax his pets.”",
        "It was really this mention of Dickon which made Mary decide\nto go out, though she was not aware of it.  There would be,\nbirds outside though there would not be ponies or sheep.\nThey would be different from the birds in India and it\nmight amuse her to look at them.",
        "Martha found her coat and hat for her and a pair of stout\nlittle boots and she showed her her way downstairs.",
        "“If tha’ goes round that way tha’ll come to th’ gardens,\"\nshe said, pointing to a gate in a wall of shrubbery.\n\"There’s lots o’ flowers in summer-time, but there’s\nnothin’ bloomin’ now.” She seemed to hesitate a second\nbefore she added, “One of th’ gardens is locked up.\nNo one has been in it for ten years.”",
        "“Why?” asked Mary in spite of herself.  Here was another\nlocked door added to the hundred in the strange house.",
        "“Mr. Craven had it shut when his wife died so sudden.\nHe won’t let no one go inside.  It was her garden.\nHe locked th’ door an’ dug a hole and buried th’ key.\nThere’s Mrs. Medlock’s bell ringing–I must run.”",
        "After she was gone Mary turned down the walk which led\nto the door in the shrubbery.  She could not help thinking\nabout the garden which no one had been into for ten years.\nShe wondered what it would look like and whether there\nwere any flowers still alive in it.  When she had passed\nthrough the shrubbery gate she found herself in great gardens,\nwith wide lawns and winding walks with clipped borders.\nThere were trees, and flower-beds, and evergreens clipped\ninto strange shapes, and a large pool with an old gray\nfountain in its midst.  But the flower-beds were bare\nand wintry and the fountain was not playing.  This was not\nthe garden which was shut up.  How could a garden be shut\nup? You could always walk into a garden.",
        "She was just thinking this when she saw that, at the end\nof the path she was following, there seemed to be a\nlong wall, with ivy growing over it.  She was not familiar\nenough with England to know that she was coming upon the\nkitchen-gardens where the vegetables and fruit were growing.\nShe went toward the wall and found that there was a green\ndoor in the ivy, and that it stood open.  This was\nnot the closed garden, evidently, and she could go into it.",
        "She went through the door and found that it was a garden\nwith walls all round it and that it was only one of several\nwalled gardens which seemed to open into one another.\nShe saw another open green door, revealing bushes and\npathways between beds containing winter vegetables.\nFruit-trees were trained flat against the wall,\nand over some of the beds there were glass frames.\nThe place was bare and ugly enough, Mary thought, as she\nstood and stared about her.  It might be nicer in summer\nwhen things were green, but there was nothing pretty about\nit now.",
        "Presently an old man with a spade over his shoulder walked\nthrough the door leading from the second garden.  He looked\nstartled when he saw Mary, and then touched his cap.\nHe had a surly old face, and did not seem at all pleased\nto see her–but then she was displeased with his garden\nand wore her “quite contrary” expression, and certainly\ndid not seem at all pleased to see him.",
        "“What is this place?” she asked.",
        "“One o’ th’ kitchen-gardens,” he answered.",
        "“What is that?” said Mary, pointing through the other\ngreen door.",
        "“Another of ’em,” shortly.  “There’s another on t’other\nside o’ th’ wall an’ there’s th’ orchard t’other side o’ that.”",
        "“Can I go in them?” asked Mary.",
        "“If tha’ likes.  But there’s nowt to see.”",
        "Mary made no response.  She went down the path and through\nthe second green door.  There, she found more walls\nand winter vegetables and glass frames, but in the second\nwall there was another green door and it was not open.\nPerhaps it led into the garden which no one had seen for\nten years.  As she was not at all a timid child and always\ndid what she wanted to do, Mary went to the green door\nand turned the handle.  She hoped the door would not open\nbecause she wanted to be sure she had found the mysterious\ngarden–but it did open quite easily and she walked\nthrough it and found herself in an orchard.  There were\nwalls all round it also and trees trained against them,\nand there were bare fruit-trees growing in the winter-browned\ngrass–but there was no green door to be seen anywhere.\nMary looked for it, and yet when she had entered the\nupper end of the garden she had noticed that the wall\ndid not seem to end with the orchard but to extend\nbeyond it as if it enclosed a place at the other side.\nShe could see the tops of trees above the wall,\nand when she stood still she saw a bird with a bright\nred breast sitting on the topmost branch of one of them,\nand suddenly he burst into his winter song–almost\nas if he had caught sight of her and was calling to her.",
        "She stopped and listened to him and somehow his cheerful,\nfriendly little whistle gave her a pleased feeling–even\na disagreeable little girl may be lonely, and the big closed\nhouse and big bare moor and big bare gardens had made this\none feel as if there was no one left in the world but herself.\nIf she had been an affectionate child, who had been\nused to being loved, she would have broken her heart,\nbut even though she was “Mistress Mary Quite Contrary\"\nshe was desolate, and the bright-breasted little bird\nbrought a look into her sour little face which was almost\na smile.  She listened to him until he flew away.\nHe was not like an Indian bird and she liked him and\nwondered if she should ever see him again.  Perhaps he\nlived in the mysterious garden and knew all about it.",
        "Perhaps it was because she had nothing whatever to do\nthat she thought so much of the deserted garden.  She was\ncurious about it and wanted to see what it was like.\nWhy had Mr. Archibald Craven buried the key? If he\nhad liked his wife so much why did he hate her garden?\nShe wondered if she should ever see him, but she knew\nthat if she did she should not like him, and he would\nnot like her, and that she should only stand and stare\nat him and say nothing, though she should be wanting\ndreadfully to ask him why he had done such a queer thing.",
        "“People never like me and I never like people,” she thought.\n\"And I never can talk as the Crawford children could.\nThey were always talking and laughing and making noises.”",
        "She thought of the robin and of the way he seemed to sing\nhis song at her, and as she remembered the tree-top he\nperched on she stopped rather suddenly on the path.",
        "“I believe that tree was in the secret garden–I feel sure\nit was,” she said.  “There was a wall round the place\nand there was no door.”",
        "She walked back into the first kitchen-garden she had entered\nand found the old man digging there.  She went and stood beside\nhim and watched him a few moments in her cold little way.\nHe took no notice of her and so at last she spoke to him.",
        "“I have been into the other gardens,” she said.",
        "“There was nothin’ to prevent thee,” he answered crustily.",
        "“I went into the orchard.”",
        "“There was no dog at th’ door to bite thee,” he answered.",
        "“There was no door there into the other garden,\"\nsaid Mary.",
        "“What garden?” he said in a rough voice, stopping his\ndigging for a moment.",
        "“The one on the other side of the wall,” answered Mistress Mary.\n\"There are trees there–I saw the tops of them.  A bird\nwith a red breast was sitting on one of them and he sang.”",
        "To her surprise the surly old weather-beaten face\nactually changed its expression.  A slow smile spread\nover it and the gardener looked quite different.  It made\nher think that it was curious how much nicer a person\nlooked when he smiled.  She had not thought of it before.",
        "He turned about to the orchard side of his garden and began\nto whistle–a low soft whistle.  She could not understand\nhow such a surly man could make such a coaxing sound.\nAlmost the next moment a wonderful thing happened.\nShe heard a soft little rushing flight through the air–and\nit was the bird with the red breast flying to them,\nand he actually alighted on the big clod of earth quite near\nto the gardener’s foot.",
        "“Here he is,” chuckled the old man, and then he spoke\nto the bird as if he were speaking to a child.",
        "“Where has tha’ been, tha’ cheeky little beggar?\"\nhe said.  “I’ve not seen thee before today.  Has tha,\nbegun tha’ courtin’ this early in th’ season? Tha’rt\ntoo forrad.”",
        "The bird put his tiny head on one side and looked up at him\nwith his soft bright eye which was like a black dewdrop.\nHe seemed quite familiar and not the least afraid.\nHe hopped about and pecked the earth briskly, looking for\nseeds and insects.  It actually gave Mary a queer feeling\nin her heart, because he was so pretty and cheerful\nand seemed so like a person.  He had a tiny plump body\nand a delicate beak, and slender delicate legs.",
        "“Will he always come when you call him?” she asked almost\nin a whisper.",
        "“Aye, that he will.  I’ve knowed him ever since he was\na fledgling.  He come out of th’ nest in th’ other garden an’\nwhen first he flew over th’ wall he was too weak to fly\nback for a few days an’ we got friendly.  When he went\nover th’ wall again th’ rest of th’ brood was gone an’\nhe was lonely an’ he come back to me.”",
        "“What kind of a bird is he?” Mary asked.",
        "“Doesn’t tha’ know? He’s a robin redbreast an’\nthey’re th’ friendliest, curiousest birds alive.\nThey’re almost as friendly as dogs–if you know how to get\non with ’em. Watch him peckin’ about there an’ lookin’\nround at us now an’ again.  He knows we’re talkin’ about him.”",
        "It was the queerest thing in the world to see the old fellow.\nHe looked at the plump little scarlet-waistcoated bird\nas if he were both proud and fond of him.",
        "“He’s a conceited one,” he chuckled.  “He likes to hear\nfolk talk about him.  An’ curious–bless me, there never\nwas his like for curiosity an’ meddlin’. He’s always comin’\nto see what I’m plantin’. He knows all th’ things Mester\nCraven never troubles hissel’ to find out.  He’s th’\nhead gardener, he is.”",
        "The robin hopped about busily pecking the soil and now\nand then stopped and looked at them a little.  Mary thought\nhis black dewdrop eyes gazed at her with great curiosity.\nIt really seemed as if he were finding out all about her.\nThe queer feeling in her heart increased.  “Where did the\nrest of the brood fly to?” she asked.",
        "“There’s no knowin’. The old ones turn ’em out o’ their nest an’\nmake ’em fly an’ they’re scattered before you know it.\nThis one was a knowin’ one an, he knew he was lonely.”",
        "Mistress Mary went a step nearer to the robin and looked\nat him very hard.",
        "“I’m lonely,” she said.",
        "She had not known before that this was one of the things\nwhich made her feel sour and cross.  She seemed to find\nit out when the robin looked at her and she looked\nat the robin.",
        "The old gardener pushed his cap back on his bald head\nand stared at her a minute.",
        "“Art tha’ th’ little wench from India?” he asked.",
        "Mary nodded.",
        "“Then no wonder tha’rt lonely.  Tha’lt be lonlier before\ntha’s done,” he said.",
        "He began to dig again, driving his spade deep into\nthe rich black garden soil while the robin hopped\nabout very busily employed.",
        "“What is your name?” Mary inquired.",
        "He stood up to answer her.",
        "“Ben Weatherstaff,” he answered, and then he added with a\nsurly chuckle, “I’m lonely mysel’ except when he’s with me,\"\nand he jerked his thumb toward the robin.  “He’s th’\nonly friend I’ve got.”",
        "“I have no friends at all,” said Mary.  “I never had.\nMy Ayah didn’t like me and I never played with any one.”",
        "It is a Yorkshire habit to say what you think with\nblunt frankness, and old Ben Weatherstaff was a Yorkshire\nmoor man.",
        "“Tha’ an’ me are a good bit alike,” he said.\n\"We was wove out of th’ same cloth.  We’re neither of us\ngood lookin’ an’ we’re both of us as sour as we look.\nWe’ve got the same nasty tempers, both of us, I’ll warrant.”",
        "This was plain speaking, and Mary Lennox had never heard\nthe truth about herself in her life.  Native servants\nalways salaamed and submitted to you, whatever you did.\nShe had never thought much about her looks, but she wondered\nif she was as unattractive as Ben Weatherstaff and she\nalso wondered if she looked as sour as he had looked\nbefore the robin came.  She actually began to wonder\nalso if she was “nasty tempered.” She felt uncomfortable.",
        "Suddenly a clear rippling little sound broke out near\nher and she turned round.  She was standing a few feet\nfrom a young apple-tree and the robin had flown on to one\nof its branches and had burst out into a scrap of a song.\nBen Weatherstaff laughed outright.",
        "“What did he do that for?” asked Mary.",
        "“He’s made up his mind to make friends with thee,\"\nreplied Ben.  “Dang me if he hasn’t took a fancy to thee.”",
        "“To me?” said Mary, and she moved toward the little tree\nsoftly and looked up.",
        "“Would you make friends with me?” she said to the robin\njust as if she was speaking to a person.  “Would you?\"\nAnd she did not say it either in her hard little voice\nor in her imperious Indian voice, but in a tone so soft\nand eager and coaxing that Ben Weatherstaff was as surprised\nas she had been when she heard him whistle.",
        "“Why,” he cried out, “tha’ said that as nice an’ human as\nif tha’ was a real child instead of a sharp old woman.\nTha’ said it almost like Dickon talks to his wild things on th’\nmoor.”",
        "“Do you know Dickon?” Mary asked, turning round rather\nin a hurry.",
        "“Everybody knows him.  Dickon’s wanderin’ about everywhere.\nTh’ very blackberries an’ heather-bells knows him.\nI warrant th’ foxes shows him where their cubs\nlies an’ th’ skylarks doesn’t hide their nests from him.”",
        "Mary would have liked to ask some more questions.\nShe was almost as curious about Dickon as she was about\nthe deserted garden.  But just that moment the robin,\nwho had ended his song, gave a little shake of his wings,\nspread them and flew away.  He had made his visit and had\nother things to do.",
        "“He has flown over the wall!” Mary cried out, watching him.\n\"He has flown into the orchard–he has flown across the\nother wall–into the garden where there is no door!”",
        "“He lives there,” said old Ben.  “He came out o’ th’ egg there.\nIf he’s courtin’, he’s makin’ up to some young madam\nof a robin that lives among th’ old rose-trees there.”",
        "“Rose-trees,” said Mary.  “Are there rose-trees?”",
        "Ben Weatherstaff took up his spade again and began to dig.",
        "“There was ten year’ ago,” he mumbled.",
        "“I should like to see them,” said Mary.  “Where is\nthe green door? There must be a door somewhere.”",
        "Ben drove his spade deep and looked as uncompanionable\nas he had looked when she first saw him.",
        "“There was ten year’ ago, but there isn’t now,” he said.",
        "“No door!” cried Mary.  “There must be.” “None as any\none can find, an’ none as is any one’s business.\nDon’t you be a meddlesome wench an’ poke your nose where\nit’s no cause to go.  Here, I must go on with my work.\nGet you gone an’ play you.  I’ve no more time.”",
        "And he actually stopped digging, threw his spade over\nhis shoulder and walked off, without even glancing\nat her or saying good-by.",
        "At first each day which passed by for Mary Lennox\nwas exactly like the others.  Every morning she awoke\nin her tapestried room and found Martha kneeling upon\nthe hearth building her fire; every morning she ate her\nbreakfast in the nursery which had nothing amusing in it;\nand after each breakfast she gazed out of the window\nacross to the huge moor which seemed to spread out on all\nsides and climb up to the sky, and after she had stared\nfor a while she realized that if she did not go out she\nwould have to stay in and do nothing–and so she went out.\nShe did not know that this was the best thing she could\nhave done, and she did not know that, when she began to walk\nquickly or even run along the paths and down the avenue,\nshe was stirring her slow blood and making herself stronger\nby fighting with the wind which swept down from the moor.\nShe ran only to make herself warm, and she hated the wind\nwhich rushed at her face and roared and held her back\nas if it were some giant she could not see.  But the big\nbreaths of rough fresh air blown over the heather filled\nher lungs with something which was good for her whole\nthin body and whipped some red color into her cheeks and\nbrightened her dull eyes when she did not know anything\nabout it.",
        "But after a few days spent almost entirely out of doors\nshe wakened one morning knowing what it was to be hungry,\nand when she sat down to her breakfast she did not glance\ndisdainfully at her porridge and push it away, but took\nup her spoon and began to eat it and went on eating it\nuntil her bowl was empty.",
        "“Tha’ got on well enough with that this mornin’, didn’t tha’?\"\nsaid Martha.",
        "“It tastes nice today,” said Mary, feeling a little\nsurprised her self.",
        "“It’s th’ air of th’ moor that’s givin’ thee stomach\nfor tha’ victuals,” answered Martha.  “It’s lucky\nfor thee that tha’s got victuals as well as appetite.\nThere’s been twelve in our cottage as had th’ stomach an’\nnothin’ to put in it.  You go on playin’ you out o’\ndoors every day an’ you’ll get some flesh on your bones an’\nyou won’t be so yeller.”",
        "“I don’t play,” said Mary.  “I have nothing to play with.”",
        "“Nothin’ to play with!” exclaimed Martha.  “Our children\nplays with sticks and stones.  They just runs about an’\nshouts an’ looks at things.” Mary did not shout,\nbut she looked at things.  There was nothing else to do.\nShe walked round and round the gardens and wandered\nabout the paths in the park.  Sometimes she looked for\nBen Weatherstaff, but though several times she saw him\nat work he was too busy to look at her or was too surly.\nOnce when she was walking toward him he picked up his spade\nand turned away as if he did it on purpose.",
        "One place she went to oftener than to any other.\nIt was the long walk outside the gardens with the walls\nround them.  There were bare flower-beds on either\nside of it and against the walls ivy grew thickly.\nThere was one part of the wall where the creeping dark\ngreen leaves were more bushy than elsewhere.  It seemed\nas if for a long time that part had been neglected.\nThe rest of it had been clipped and made to look neat,\nbut at this lower end of the walk it had not been trimmed\nat all.",
        "A few days after she had talked to Ben Weatherstaff,\nMary stopped to notice this and wondered why it was so.\nShe had just paused and was looking up at a long spray of ivy\nswinging in the wind when she saw a gleam of scarlet and\nheard a brilliant chirp, and there, on the top of the wall,\nforward perched Ben Weatherstaff’s robin redbreast,\ntilting forward to look at her with his small head on\none side.",
        "“Oh!” she cried out, “is it you–is it you?” And it\ndid not seem at all queer to her that she spoke to him\nas if she were sure that he would understand and answer her.",
        "He did answer.  He twittered and chirped and hopped along\nthe wall as if he were telling her all sorts of things.\nIt seemed to Mistress Mary as if she understood him, too,\nthough he was not speaking in words.  It was as if he\nsaid:",
        "“Good morning! Isn’t the wind nice? Isn’t the sun nice? Isn’t\neverything nice? Let us both chirp and hop and twitter.\nCome on! Come on!”",
        "Mary began to laugh, and as he hopped and took little flights\nalong the wall she ran after him.  Poor little thin, sallow,\nugly Mary–she actually looked almost pretty for a moment.",
        "“I like you! I like you!” she cried out, pattering down the walk;\nand she chirped and tried to whistle, which last she did\nnot know how to do in the least.  But the robin seemed\nto be quite satisfied and chirped and whistled back at her.\nAt last he spread his wings and made a darting flight\nto the top of a tree, where he perched and sang loudly.\nThat reminded Mary of the first time she had seen him.\nHe had been swinging on a tree-top then and she had been\nstanding in the orchard.  Now she was on the other side\nof the orchard and standing in the path outside a wall–much\nlower down–and there was the same tree inside.",
        "“It’s in the garden no one can go into,” she said to herself.\n\"It’s the garden without a door.  He lives in there.\nHow I wish I could see what it is like!”",
        "She ran up the walk to the green door she had entered\nthe first morning.  Then she ran down the path through\nthe other door and then into the orchard, and when she\nstood and looked up there was the tree on the other side\nof the wall, and there was the robin just finishing his\nsong and, beginning to preen his feathers with his beak.",
        "“It is the garden,” she said.  “I am sure it is.”",
        "She walked round and looked closely at that side of the\norchard wall, but she only found what she had found\nbefore–that there was no door in it.  Then she ran\nthrough the kitchen-gardens again and out into the walk\noutside the long ivy-covered wall, and she walked to\nthe end of it and looked at it, but there was no door;\nand then she walked to the other end, looking again,\nbut there was no door.",
        "“It’s very queer,” she said.  “Ben Weatherstaff said\nthere was no door and there is no door.  But there must\nhave been one ten years ago, because Mr. Craven buried\nthe key.”",
        "This gave her so much to think of that she began to be\nquite interested and feel that she was not sorry that she\nhad come to Misselthwaite Manor.  In India she had always\nfelt hot and too languid to care much about anything.\nThe fact was that the fresh wind from the moor had begun\nto blow the cobwebs out of her young brain and to waken\nher up a little.",
        "She stayed out of doors nearly all day, and when she sat\ndown to her supper at night she felt hungry and drowsy\nand comfortable.  She did not feel cross when Martha\nchattered away.  She felt as if she rather liked to hear her,\nand at last she thought she would ask her a question.\nShe asked it after she had finished her supper and had sat\ndown on the hearth-rug before the fire.",
        "“Why did Mr. Craven hate the garden?” she said.",
        "She had made Martha stay with her and Martha had not\nobjected at all.  She was very young, and used to a crowded\ncottage full of brothers and sisters, and she found it\ndull in the great servants’ hall downstairs where the\nfootman and upper-housemaids made fun of her Yorkshire\nspeech and looked upon her as a common little thing,\nand sat and whispered among themselves.  Martha liked\nto talk, and the strange child who had lived in India,\nand been waited upon by “blacks,” was novelty enough\nto attract her.",
        "She sat down on the hearth herself without waiting\nto be asked.",
        "“Art tha’ thinkin’ about that garden yet?” she said.\n\"I knew tha’ would.  That was just the way with me when I\nfirst heard about it.”",
        "“Why did he hate it?” Mary persisted.",
        "Martha tucked her feet under her and made herself\nquite comfortable.",
        "“Listen to th’ wind wutherin’ round the house,” she said.\n\"You could bare stand up on the moor if you was out on\nit tonight.”",
        "Mary did not know what “wutherin’” meant until she listened,\nand then she understood.  It must mean that hollow\nshuddering sort of roar which rushed round and round the\nhouse as if the giant no one could see were buffeting it\nand beating at the walls and windows to try to break in.\nBut one knew he could not get in, and somehow it made\none feel very safe and warm inside a room with a red\ncoal fire.",
        "“But why did he hate it so?” she asked, after she\nhad listened.  She intended to know if Martha did.",
        "Then Martha gave up her store of knowledge.",
        "“Mind,” she said, “Mrs. Medlock said it’s not to be\ntalked about.  There’s lots o’ things in this place that’s\nnot to be talked over.  That’s Mr. Craven’s orders.\nHis troubles are none servants’ business, he says.\nBut for th’ garden he wouldn’t be like he is.  It was\nMrs. Craven’s garden that she had made when first they\nwere married an’ she just loved it, an’ they used to ’tend\nthe flowers themselves.  An’ none o’ th’ gardeners was\never let to go in.  Him an’ her used to go in an’\nshut th’ door an’ stay there hours an’ hours, readin’\nand talkin’. An, she was just a bit of a girl an’\nthere was an old tree with a branch bent like a seat\non it.  An’ she made roses grow over it an’ she used\nto sit there.  But one day when she was sittin’ there th’\nbranch broke an’ she fell on th’ ground an’ was hurt\nso bad that next day she died.  Th’ doctors thought he’d\ngo out o’ his mind an’ die, too.  That’s why he hates it.\nNo one’s never gone in since, an’ he won’t let any one talk\nabout it.”",
        "Mary did not ask any more questions.  She looked at\nthe red fire and listened to the wind “wutherin’.\"\nIt seemed to be “wutherin’” louder than ever.\nAt that moment a very good thing was happening to her.\nFour good things had happened to her, in fact, since she\ncame to Misselthwaite Manor.  She had felt as if she\nhad understood a robin and that he had understood her;\nshe had run in the wind until her blood had grown warm;\nshe had been healthily hungry for the first time in her life;\nand she had found out what it was to be sorry for some one.",
        "But as she was listening to the wind she began to listen\nto something else.  She did not know what it was,\nbecause at first she could scarcely distinguish it from\nthe wind itself.  It was a curious sound–it seemed almost\nas if a child were crying somewhere.  Sometimes the wind\nsounded rather like a child crying, but presently Mistress\nMary felt quite sure this sound was inside the house,\nnot outside it.  It was far away, but it was inside.\nShe turned round and looked at Martha.",
        "“Do you hear any one crying?” she said.",
        "Martha suddenly looked confused.",
        "“No,” she answered.  “It’s th’ wind.  Sometimes it\nsounds like as if some one was lost on th’ moor an’\nwailin’. It’s got all sorts o’ sounds.”",
        "“But listen,” said Mary.  “It’s in the house–down one\nof those long corridors.”",
        "And at that very moment a door must have been opened\nsomewhere downstairs; for a great rushing draft blew along\nthe passage and the door of the room they sat in was blown\nopen with a crash, and as they both jumped to their feet\nthe light was blown out and the crying sound was swept down\nthe far corridor so that it was to be heard more plainly than\never.",
        "“There!” said Mary.  “I told you so! It is some one\ncrying–and it isn’t a grown-up person.”",
        "Martha ran and shut the door and turned the key, but before\nshe did it they both heard the sound of a door in some far\npassage shutting with a bang, and then everything was quiet,\nfor even the wind ceased “wutherin’” for a few moments.",
        "“It was th’ wind,” said Martha stubbornly.\n\"An’ if it wasn’t, it was little Betty Butterworth,\nth’ scullery-maid. She’s had th’ toothache all day.”",
        "But something troubled and awkward in her manner made\nMistress Mary stare very hard at her.  She did not believe\nshe was speaking the truth.",
        "The next day the rain poured down in torrents again,\nand when Mary looked out of her window the moor was almost\nhidden by gray mist and cloud.  There could be no going\nout today.",
        "“What do you do in your cottage when it rains like this?\"\nshe asked Martha.",
        "“Try to keep from under each other’s feet mostly,\"\nMartha answered.  “Eh! there does seem a lot of us then.\nMother’s a good-tempered woman but she gets fair moithered.\nThe biggest ones goes out in th’ cow-shed and plays there.\nDickon he doesn’t mind th’ wet.  He goes out just th’\nsame as if th’ sun was shinin’. He says he sees things\non rainy days as doesn’t show when it’s fair weather.\nHe once found a little fox cub half drowned in its hole and he\nbrought it home in th’ bosom of his shirt to keep it warm.\nIts mother had been killed nearby an’ th’ hole was swum\nout an’ th’ rest o’ th’ litter was dead.  He’s got it at\nhome now.  He found a half-drowned young crow another time an’\nhe brought it home, too, an’ tamed it.  It’s named Soot\nbecause it’s so black, an’ it hops an’ flies about with\nhim everywhere.”",
        "The time had come when Mary had forgotten to resent\nMartha’s familiar talk.  She had even begun to find it\ninteresting and to be sorry when she stopped or went away.\nThe stories she had been told by her Ayah when she lived\nin India had been quite unlike those Martha had to tell about\nthe moorland cottage which held fourteen people who lived\nin four little rooms and never had quite enough to eat.\nThe children seemed to tumble about and amuse themselves\nlike a litter of rough, good-natured collie puppies.\nMary was most attracted by the mother and Dickon.\nWhen Martha told stories of what “mother” said or did they\nalways sounded comfortable.",
        "“If I had a raven or a fox cub I could play with it,\"\nsaid Mary.  “But I have nothing.”",
        "Martha looked perplexed.",
        "“Can tha’ knit?” she asked.",
        "“No,” answered Mary.",
        "“Can tha’sew?”",
        "“No.”",
        "“Can tha’ read?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“Then why doesn’t tha, read somethin’, or learn a bit o’\nspellin’? Tha’st old enough to be learnin’ thy book a good\nbit now.”",
        "“I haven’t any books,” said Mary.  “Those I had were left\nin India.”",
        "“That’s a pity,” said Martha.  “If Mrs. Medlock’d let thee\ngo into th’ library, there’s thousands o’ books there.”",
        "Mary did not ask where the library was, because she was\nsuddenly inspired by a new idea.  She made up her mind\nto go and find it herself.  She was not troubled about\nMrs. Medlock.  Mrs. Medlock seemed always to be in her\ncomfortable housekeeper’s sitting-room downstairs.\nIn this queer place one scarcely ever saw any one at all.\nIn fact, there was no one to see but the servants,\nand when their master was away they lived a luxurious\nlife below stairs, where there was a huge kitchen hung\nabout with shining brass and pewter, and a large servants’\nhall where there were four or five abundant meals eaten\nevery day, and where a great deal of lively romping went on\nwhen Mrs. Medlock was out of the way.",
        "Mary’s meals were served regularly, and Martha waited on her,\nbut no one troubled themselves about her in the least.\nMrs. Medlock came and looked at her every day or two,\nbut no one inquired what she did or told her what to do.\nShe supposed that perhaps this was the English way of\ntreating children.  In India she had always been attended\nby her Ayah, who had followed her about and waited on her,\nhand and foot.  She had often been tired of her company.\nNow she was followed by nobody and was learning to dress\nherself because Martha looked as though she thought she was\nsilly and stupid when she wanted to have things handed to her\nand put on.",
        "“Hasn’t tha’ got good sense?” she said once, when Mary\nhad stood waiting for her to put on her gloves for her.\n\"Our Susan Ann is twice as sharp as thee an’ she’s only\nfour year’ old.  Sometimes tha’ looks fair soft in th’ head.”",
        "Mary had worn her contrary scowl for an hour after that,\nbut it made her think several entirely new things.",
        "She stood at the window for about ten minutes this morning\nafter Martha had swept up the hearth for the last time\nand gone downstairs.  She was thinking over the new idea\nwhich had come to her when she heard of the library.\nShe did not care very much about the library itself,\nbecause she had read very few books; but to hear of it brought\nback to her mind the hundred rooms with closed doors.\nShe wondered if they were all really locked and what\nshe would find if she could get into any of them.\nWere there a hundred really? Why shouldn’t she go and see\nhow many doors she could count? It would be something\nto do on this morning when she could not go out.\nShe had never been taught to ask permission to do things,\nand she knew nothing at all about authority, so she would\nnot have thought it necessary to ask Mrs. Medlock if she\nmight walk about the house, even if she had seen her.",
        "She opened the door of the room and went into the corridor,\nand then she began her wanderings.  It was a long corridor\nand it branched into other corridors and it led her up\nshort flights of steps which mounted to others again.\nThere were doors and doors, and there were pictures\non the walls.  Sometimes they were pictures of dark,\ncurious landscapes, but oftenest they were portraits\nof men and women in queer, grand costumes made of satin\nand velvet.  She found herself in one long gallery\nwhose walls were covered with these portraits.  She had\nnever thought there could be so many in any house.\nShe walked slowly down this place and stared at the faces\nwhich also seemed to stare at her.  She felt as if they\nwere wondering what a little girl from India was doing\nin their house.  Some were pictures of children–little\ngirls in thick satin frocks which reached to their feet\nand stood out about them, and boys with puffed sleeves\nand lace collars and long hair, or with big ruffs around\ntheir necks.  She always stopped to look at the children,\nand wonder what their names were, and where they had gone,\nand why they wore such odd clothes.  There was a stiff,\nplain little girl rather like herself.  She wore a green\nbrocade dress and held a green parrot on her finger.\nHer eyes had a sharp, curious look.",
        "“Where do you live now?” said Mary aloud to her.\n\"I wish you were here.”",
        "Surely no other little girl ever spent such a queer morning.\nIt seemed as if there was no one in all the huge rambling\nhouse but her own small self, wandering about upstairs\nand down, through narrow passages and wide ones, where it\nseemed to her that no one but herself had ever walked.\nSince so many rooms had been built, people must have lived\nin them, but it all seemed so empty that she could not quite\nbelieve it true.",
        "It was not until she climbed to the second floor that she\nthought of turning the handle of a door.  All the doors\nwere shut, as Mrs. Medlock had said they were, but at last she\nput her hand on the handle of one of them and turned it.\nShe was almost frightened for a moment when she felt\nthat it turned without difficulty and that when she pushed\nupon the door itself it slowly and heavily opened.\nIt was a massive door and opened into a big bedroom.\nThere were embroidered hangings on the wall, and inlaid\nfurniture such as she had seen in India stood about the room.\nA broad window with leaded panes looked out upon the moor;\nand over the mantel was another portrait of the stiff,\nplain little girl who seemed to stare at her more curiously\nthan ever.",
        "“Perhaps she slept here once,” said Mary.  “She stares\nat me so that she makes me feel queer.”",
        "After that she opened more doors and more.  She saw\nso many rooms that she became quite tired and began\nto think that there must be a hundred, though she had not\ncounted them.  In all of them there were old pictures\nor old tapestries with strange scenes worked on them.\nThere were curious pieces of furniture and curious\nornaments in nearly all of them.",
        "In one room, which looked like a lady’s sitting-room,\nthe hangings were all embroidered velvet, and in a cabinet\nwere about a hundred little elephants made of ivory.\nThey were of different sizes, and some had their mahouts\nor palanquins on their backs.  Some were much bigger than the\nothers and some were so tiny that they seemed only babies.\nMary had seen carved ivory in India and she knew all\nabout elephants.  She opened the door of the cabinet\nand stood on a footstool and played with these for quite\na long time.  When she got tired she set the elephants\nin order and shut the door of the cabinet.",
        "In all her wanderings through the long corridors and the\nempty rooms, she had seen nothing alive; but in this\nroom she saw something.  Just after she had closed the\ncabinet door she heard a tiny rustling sound.  It made\nher jump and look around at the sofa by the fireplace,\nfrom which it seemed to come.  In the corner of the sofa\nthere was a cushion, and in the velvet which covered\nit there was a hole, and out of the hole peeped a tiny\nhead with a pair of frightened eyes in it.",
        "Mary crept softly across the room to look.  The bright eyes\nbelonged to a little gray mouse, and the mouse had eaten\na hole into the cushion and made a comfortable nest there.\nSix baby mice were cuddled up asleep near her.  If there\nwas no one else alive in the hundred rooms there were\nseven mice who did not look lonely at all.",
        "“If they wouldn’t be so frightened I would take them back\nwith me,” said Mary.",
        "She had wandered about long enough to feel too tired\nto wander any farther, and she turned back.  Two or three\ntimes she lost her way by turning down the wrong corridor\nand was obliged to ramble up and down until she found\nthe right one; but at last she reached her own floor again,\nthough she was some distance from her own room and did\nnot know exactly where she was.",
        "“I believe I have taken a wrong turning again,” she said,\nstanding still at what seemed the end of a short passage\nwith tapestry on the wall.  “I don’t know which way to go.\nHow still everything is!”",
        "It was while she was standing here and just after she\nhad said this that the stillness was broken by a sound.\nIt was another cry, but not quite like the one she had heard\nlast night; it was only a short one, a fretful childish\nwhine muffled by passing through walls.",
        "“It’s nearer than it was,” said Mary, her heart beating\nrather faster.  “And it is crying.”",
        "She put her hand accidentally upon the tapestry near her,\nand then sprang back, feeling quite startled.  The tapestry\nwas the covering of a door which fell open and showed\nher that there was another part of the corridor behind it,\nand Mrs. Medlock was coming up it with her bunch of keys\nin her hand and a very cross look on her face.",
        "“What are you doing here?” she said, and she took Mary\nby the arm and pulled her away.  “What did I tell you?”",
        "“I turned round the wrong corner,” explained Mary.\n\"I didn’t know which way to go and I heard some one crying.\"\nShe quite hated Mrs. Medlock at the moment, but she hated\nher more the next.",
        "“You didn’t hear anything of the sort,” said the housekeeper.\n\"You come along back to your own nursery or I’ll box\nyour ears.”",
        "And she took her by the arm and half pushed, half pulled\nher up one passage and down another until she pushed\nher in at the door of her own room.",
        "“Now,” she said, “you stay where you’re told to stay\nor you’ll find yourself locked up.  The master had\nbetter get you a governess, same as he said he would.\nYou’re one that needs some one to look sharp after you.\nI’ve got enough to do.”",
        "She went out of the room and slammed the door after her,\nand Mary went and sat on the hearth-rug, pale with rage.\nShe did not cry, but ground her teeth.",
        "“There was some one crying–there was–there was!\"\nshe said to herself.",
        "She had heard it twice now, and sometime she would find out.\nShe had found out a great deal this morning.  She felt\nas if she had been on a long journey, and at any rate\nshe had had something to amuse her all the time, and she\nhad played with the ivory elephants and had seen the gray\nmouse and its babies in their nest in the velvet cushion.",
        "Two days after this, when Mary opened her eyes she sat\nupright in bed immediately, and called to Martha.",
        "“Look at the moor! Look at the moor!”",
        "The rainstorm had ended and the gray mist and clouds\nhad been swept away in the night by the wind.  The wind\nitself had ceased and a brilliant, deep blue sky arched\nhigh over the moorland.  Never, never had Mary dreamed\nof a sky so blue.  In India skies were hot and blazing;\nthis was of a deep cool blue which almost seemed to\nsparkle like the waters of some lovely bottomless lake,\nand here and there, high, high in the arched blueness\nfloated small clouds of snow-white fleece.  The far-reaching\nworld of the moor itself looked softly blue instead\nof gloomy purple-black or awful dreary gray.",
        "“Aye,” said Martha with a cheerful grin.  “Th’ storm’s\nover for a bit.  It does like this at this time o’\nth’ year.  It goes off in a night like it was pretendin’\nit had never been here an’ never meant to come again.\nThat’s because th’ springtime’s on its way.  It’s a long\nway off yet, but it’s comin’.”",
        "“I thought perhaps it always rained or looked dark\nin England,” Mary said.",
        "“Eh! no!” said Martha, sitting up on her heels among\nher black lead brushes.  “Nowt o’ th’ soart!”",
        "“What does that mean?” asked Mary seriously.  In India\nthe natives spoke different dialects which only a few\npeople understood, so she was not surprised when Martha\nused words she did not know.",
        "Martha laughed as she had done the first morning.",
        "“There now,” she said.  “I’ve talked broad Yorkshire again\nlike Mrs. Medlock said I mustn’t. `Nowt o’ th’ soart’\nmeans `nothin’-of-the-sort,’” slowly and carefully,\n\"but it takes so long to say it.  Yorkshire’s th’\nsunniest place on earth when it is sunny.  I told thee\ntha’d like th’ moor after a bit.  Just you wait till you\nsee th’ gold-colored gorse blossoms an’ th’ blossoms o’\nth’ broom, an’ th’ heather flowerin’, all purple bells, an’\nhundreds o’ butterflies flutterin’ an’ bees hummin’ an’\nskylarks soarin’ up an’ singin’. You’ll want to get out on\nit as sunrise an’ live out on it all day like Dickon does.\"\n\"Could I ever get there?” asked Mary wistfully,\nlooking through her window at the far-off blue.\nIt was so new and big and wonderful and such a heavenly color.",
        "“I don’t know,” answered Martha.  “Tha’s never used tha’\nlegs since tha’ was born, it seems to me.  Tha’ couldn’t walk\nfive mile.  It’s five mile to our cottage.”",
        "“I should like to see your cottage.”",
        "Martha stared at her a moment curiously before she took\nup her polishing brush and began to rub the grate again.\nShe was thinking that the small plain face did not look quite\nas sour at this moment as it had done the first morning\nshe saw it.  It looked just a trifle like little Susan\nAnn’s when she wanted something very much.",
        "“I’ll ask my mother about it,” she said.  “She’s one o’\nthem that nearly always sees a way to do things.\nIt’s my day out today an’ I’m goin’ home.  Eh! I am glad.\nMrs. Medlock thinks a lot o’ mother.  Perhaps she could talk\nto her.”",
        "“I like your mother,” said Mary.",
        "“I should think tha’ did,” agreed Martha, polishing away.",
        "“I’ve never seen her,” said Mary.",
        "“No, tha’ hasn’t,” replied Martha.",
        "She sat up on her heels again and rubbed the end of her\nnose with the back of her hand as if puzzled for a moment,\nbut she ended quite positively.",
        "“Well, she’s that sensible an’ hard workin’ an’ goodnatured an’\nclean that no one could help likin’ her whether they’d\nseen her or not.  When I’m goin’ home to her on my day\nout I just jump for joy when I’m crossin’ the moor.”",
        "“I like Dickon,” added Mary.  “And I’ve never seen him.”",
        "“Well,” said Martha stoutly, “I’ve told thee that th’\nvery birds likes him an’ th’ rabbits an’ wild sheep an’\nponies, an’ th’ foxes themselves.  I wonder,” staring at\nher reflectively, “what Dickon would think of thee?”",
        "“He wouldn’t like me,” said Mary in her stiff,\ncold little way.  “No one does.”",
        "Martha looked reflective again.",
        "“How does tha’ like thysel’?” she inquired, really quite\nas if she were curious to know.",
        "Mary hesitated a moment and thought it over.",
        "“Not at all–really,” she answered.  “But I never thought\nof that before.”",
        "Martha grinned a little as if at some homely recollection.",
        "“Mother said that to me once,” she said.  “She was at her\nwash-tub an’ I was in a bad temper an’ talkin’ ill of folk,\nan’ she turns round on me an’ says: `Tha’ young vixen,\ntha’! There tha’ stands sayin’ tha’ doesn’t like this one an’\ntha’ doesn’t like that one.  How does tha’ like thysel’?’\nIt made me laugh an’ it brought me to my senses in a minute.”",
        "She went away in high spirits as soon as she had given\nMary her breakfast.  She was going to walk five miles\nacross the moor to the cottage, and she was going to help\nher mother with the washing and do the week’s baking\nand enjoy herself thoroughly.",
        "Mary felt lonelier than ever when she knew she was no longer\nin the house.  She went out into the garden as quickly\nas possible, and the first thing she did was to run\nround and round the fountain flower garden ten times.\nShe counted the times carefully and when she had finished\nshe felt in better spirits.  The sunshine made the\nwhole place look different.  The high, deep, blue sky\narched over Misselthwaite as well as over the moor,\nand she kept lifting her face and looking up into it,\ntrying to imagine what it would be like to lie down on\none of the little snow-white clouds and float about.\nShe went into the first kitchen-garden and found Ben\nWeatherstaff working there with two other gardeners.\nThe change in the weather seemed to have done him good.\nHe spoke to her of his own accord.  “Springtime’s comin,’\"\nhe said.  “Cannot tha’ smell it?”",
        "Mary sniffed and thought she could.",
        "“I smell something nice and fresh and damp,” she said.",
        "“That’s th’ good rich earth,” he answered, digging away.\n\"It’s in a good humor makin’ ready to grow things.\nIt’s glad when plantin’ time comes.  It’s dull in th’\nwinter when it’s got nowt to do.  In th’ flower gardens out\nthere things will be stirrin’ down below in th’ dark.  Th’\nsun’s warmin’ ’em. You’ll see bits o’ green spikes stickin’\nout o’ th’ black earth after a bit.”",
        "“What will they be?” asked Mary.",
        "“Crocuses an’ snowdrops an’ daffydowndillys.  Has tha’\nnever seen them?”",
        "“No. Everything is hot, and wet, and green after the\nrains in India,” said Mary.  “And I think things grow\nup in a night.”",
        "“These won’t grow up in a night,” said Weatherstaff.\n\"Tha’ll have to wait for ’em. They’ll poke up a bit\nhigher here, an’ push out a spike more there, an’ uncurl a\nleaf this day an’ another that.  You watch ’em.”",
        "“I am going to,” answered Mary.",
        "Very soon she heard the soft rustling flight of wings\nagain and she knew at once that the robin had come again.\nHe was very pert and lively, and hopped about so close\nto her feet, and put his head on one side and looked at\nher so slyly that she asked Ben Weatherstaff a question.",
        "“Do you think he remembers me?” she said.",
        "“Remembers thee!” said Weatherstaff indignantly.\n\"He knows every cabbage stump in th’ gardens, let\nalone th’ people.  He’s never seen a little wench\nhere before, an’ he’s bent on findin’ out all about thee.\nTha’s no need to try to hide anything from him.”",
        "“Are things stirring down below in the dark in that garden\nwhere he lives?” Mary inquired.",
        "“What garden?” grunted Weatherstaff, becoming surly again.",
        "“The one where the old rose-trees are.” She could\nnot help asking, because she wanted so much to know.\n\"Are all the flowers dead, or do some of them come again\nin the summer? Are there ever any roses?”",
        "“Ask him,” said Ben Weatherstaff, hunching his shoulders\ntoward the robin.  “He’s the only one as knows.\nNo one else has seen inside it for ten year’.”",
        "Ten years was a long time, Mary thought.  She had been\nborn ten years ago.",
        "She walked away, slowly thinking.  She had begun to\nlike the garden just as she had begun to like the robin\nand Dickon and Martha’s mother.  She was beginning\nto like Martha, too.  That seemed a good many people\nto like–when you were not used to liking.  She thought\nof the robin as one of the people.  She went to her walk\noutside the long, ivy-covered wall over which she could\nsee the tree-tops; and the second time she walked up\nand down the most interesting and exciting thing happened\nto her, and it was all through Ben Weatherstaff’s robin.",
        "She heard a chirp and a twitter, and when she looked\nat the bare flower-bed at her left side there he was\nhopping about and pretending to peck things out of the\nearth to persuade her that he had not followed her.\nBut she knew he had followed her and the surprise so filled\nher with delight that she almost trembled a little.",
        "“You do remember me!” she cried out.  “You do! You are\nprettier than anything else in the world!”",
        "She chirped, and talked, and coaxed and he hopped,\nand flirted his tail and twittered.  It was as if he\nwere talking.  His red waistcoat was like satin and he\npuffed his tiny breast out and was so fine and so grand\nand so pretty that it was really as if he were showing her\nhow important and like a human person a robin could be.\nMistress Mary forgot that she had ever been contrary\nin her life when he allowed her to draw closer and closer\nto him, and bend down and talk and try to make something\nlike robin sounds.",
        "Oh! to think that he should actually let her come as near\nto him as that! He knew nothing in the world would make\nher put out her hand toward him or startle him in the\nleast tiniest way.  He knew it because he was a real\nperson–only nicer than any other person in the world.\nShe was so happy that she scarcely dared to breathe.",
        "The flower-bed was not quite bare.  It was bare of flowers\nbecause the perennial plants had been cut down for their\nwinter rest, but there were tall shrubs and low ones which grew\ntogether at the back of the bed, and as the robin hopped\nabout under them she saw him hop over a small pile of freshly\nturned up earth.  He stopped on it to look for a worm.\nThe earth had been turned up because a dog had been trying\nto dig up a mole and he had scratched quite a deep hole.",
        "Mary looked at it, not really knowing why the hole was there,\nand as she looked she saw something almost buried in the\nnewly-turned soil.  It was something like a ring of rusty\niron or brass and when the robin flew up into a tree\nnearby she put out her hand and picked the ring up.\nIt was more than a ring, however; it was an old key\nwhich looked as if it had been buried a long time.",
        "Mistress Mary stood up and looked at it with an almost\nfrightened face as it hung from her finger.",
        "“Perhaps it has been buried for ten years,” she said\nin a whisper.  “Perhaps it is the key to the garden!”",
        "She looked at the key quite a long time.  She turned it\nover and over, and thought about it.  As I have said before,\nshe was not a child who had been trained to ask permission\nor consult her elders about things.  All she thought about\nthe key was that if it was the key to the closed garden,\nand she could find out where the door was, she could\nperhaps open it and see what was inside the walls,\nand what had happened to the old rose-trees. It was because\nit had been shut up so long that she wanted to see it.\nIt seemed as if it must be different from other places\nand that something strange must have happened to it\nduring ten years.  Besides that, if she liked it she\ncould go into it every day and shut the door behind her,\nand she could make up some play of her own and play it\nquite alone, because nobody would ever know where she was,\nbut would think the door was still locked and the key\nburied in the earth.  The thought of that pleased her\nvery much.",
        "Living as it were, all by herself in a house with a hundred\nmysteriously closed rooms and having nothing whatever\nto do to amuse herself, had set her inactive brain\nto working and was actually awakening her imagination.\nThere is no doubt that the fresh, strong, pure air from the\nmoor had a great deal to do with it.  Just as it had given\nher an appetite, and fighting with the wind had stirred\nher blood, so the same things had stirred her mind.\nIn India she had always been too hot and languid and weak\nto care much about anything, but in this place she\nwas beginning to care and to want to do new things.\nAlready she felt less “contrary,” though she did not\nknow why.",
        "She put the key in her pocket and walked up and down\nher walk.  No one but herself ever seemed to come there,\nso she could walk slowly and look at the wall, or, rather,\nat the ivy growing on it.  The ivy was the baffling thing.\nHowsoever carefully she looked she could see nothing\nbut thickly growing, glossy, dark green leaves.  She was\nvery much disappointed.  Something of her contrariness\ncame back to her as she paced the walk and looked over it\nat the tree-tops inside.  It seemed so silly, she said\nto herself, to be near it and not be able to get in.\nShe took the key in her pocket when she went back to\nthe house, and she made up her mind that she would always\ncarry it with her when she went out, so that if she ever\nshould find the hidden door she would be ready.",
        "Mrs. Medlock had allowed Martha to sleep all night at\nthe cottage, but she was back at her work in the morning\nwith cheeks redder than ever and in the best of spirits.",
        "“I got up at four o’clock,” she said.  “Eh! it was pretty on th’\nmoor with th’ birds gettin’ up an’ th’ rabbits scamperin’\nabout an’ th’ sun risin’. I didn’t walk all th’ way.  A man\ngave me a ride in his cart an’ I did enjoy myself.”",
        "She was full of stories of the delights of her day out.\nHer mother had been glad to see her and they had got the\nbaking and washing all out of the way.  She had even made\neach of the children a doughcake with a bit of brown sugar\nin it.",
        "“I had ’em all pipin’ hot when they came in from playin’\non th’ moor.  An’ th’ cottage all smelt o’ nice, clean hot bakin’\nan’ there was a good fire, an’ they just shouted for joy.\nOur Dickon he said our cottage was good enough for a king.”",
        "In the evening they had all sat round the fire,\nand Martha and her mother had sewed patches on torn\nclothes and mended stockings and Martha had told them\nabout the little girl who had come from India and who had\nbeen waited on all her life by what Martha called “blacks\"\nuntil she didn’t know how to put on her own stockings.",
        "“Eh! they did like to hear about you,” said Martha.\n\"They wanted to know all about th’ blacks an’ about th’\nship you came in.  I couldn’t tell ’em enough.”",
        "Mary reflected a little.",
        "“I’ll tell you a great deal more before your next day out,\"\nshe said, “so that you will have more to talk about.\nI dare say they would like to hear about riding on elephants\nand camels, and about the officers going to hunt tigers.”",
        "“My word!” cried delighted Martha.  “It would set ’em\nclean off their heads.  Would tha’ really do that,\nMiss? It would be same as a wild beast show like we heard\nthey had in York once.”",
        "“India is quite different from Yorkshire,” Mary said slowly,\nas she thought the matter over.  “I never thought of that.\nDid Dickon and your mother like to hear you talk about me?”",
        "“Why, our Dickon’s eyes nearly started out o’ his head,\nthey got that round,” answered Martha.  “But mother, she was\nput out about your seemin’ to be all by yourself like.\nShe said, ’Hasn’t Mr. Craven got no governess for her,\nnor no nurse?’ and I said, ’No, he hasn’t, though Mrs. Medlock\nsays he will when he thinks of it, but she says he mayn’t\nthink of it for two or three years.’”",
        "“I don’t want a governess,” said Mary sharply.",
        "“But mother says you ought to be learnin’ your book by this time\nan’\nyou ought to have a woman to look after you, an’ she says:\n`Now, Martha, you just think how you’d feel yourself, in a big\nplace like that, wanderin’ about all alone, an’ no mother.\nYou do your best to cheer her up,’ she says, an’ I said I would.”",
        "Mary gave her a long, steady look.",
        "“You do cheer me up,” she said.  “I like to hear you talk.”",
        "Presently Martha went out of the room and came back\nwith something held in her hands under her apron.",
        "“What does tha’ think,” she said, with a cheerful grin.\n\"I’ve brought thee a present.”",
        "“A present!” exclaimed Mistress Mary.  How could a cottage\nfull of fourteen hungry people give any one a present!",
        "“A man was drivin’ across the moor peddlin’,” Martha explained.\n\"An’ he stopped his cart at our door.  He had pots an’\npans an’ odds an’ ends, but mother had no money to buy\nanythin’. Just as he was goin’ away our ’Lizabeth Ellen\ncalled out, `Mother, he’s got skippin’-ropes with red an’\nblue handles.’ An’ mother she calls out quite sudden,\n`Here, stop, mister! How much are they?’ An’ he says\n`Tuppence’, an’ mother she began fumblin’ in her pocket an’\nshe says to me, `Martha, tha’s brought me thy wages like\na good lass, an’ I’ve got four places to put every penny,\nbut I’m just goin’ to take tuppence out of it to buy\nthat child a skippin’-rope,’ an’ she bought one an’\nhere it is.”",
        "She brought it out from under her apron and exhibited\nit quite proudly.  It was a strong, slender rope\nwith a striped red and blue handle at each end,\nbut Mary Lennox had never seen a skipping-rope before.\nShe gazed at it with a mystified expression.",
        "“What is it for?” she asked curiously.",
        "“For!” cried out Martha.  “Does tha’ mean that they’ve not\ngot skippin’-ropes in India, for all they’ve got elephants\nand tigers and camels! No wonder most of ’em’s black.\nThis is what it’s for; just watch me.”",
        "And she ran into the middle of the room and, taking a\nhandle in each hand, began to skip, and skip, and skip,\nwhile Mary turned in her chair to stare at her, and the\nqueer faces in the old portraits seemed to stare at her,\ntoo, and wonder what on earth this common little cottager\nhad the impudence to be doing under their very noses.\nBut Martha did not even see them.  The interest and curiosity\nin Mistress Mary’s face delighted her, and she went on skipping\nand counted as she skipped until she had reached a hundred.",
        "“I could skip longer than that,” she said when she stopped.\n\"I’ve skipped as much as five hundred when I was twelve,\nbut I wasn’t as fat then as I am now, an’ I was in practice.”",
        "Mary got up from her chair beginning to feel excited herself.",
        "“It looks nice,” she said.  “Your mother is a kind woman.\nDo you think I could ever skip like that?”",
        "“You just try it,” urged Martha, handing her the skipping-rope.\n\"You can’t skip a hundred at first, but if you practice\nyou’ll mount up.  That’s what mother said.  She says,\n`Nothin’ will do her more good than skippin’ rope.  It’s th’\nsensiblest toy a child can have.  Let her play out in th’\nfresh air skippin’ an’ it’ll stretch her legs an’ arms an’\ngive her some strength in ’em.’”",
        "It was plain that there was not a great deal of strength\nin Mistress Mary’s arms and legs when she first began\nto skip.  She was not very clever at it, but she liked\nit so much that she did not want to stop.",
        "“Put on tha’ things and run an’ skip out o’ doors,\"\nsaid Martha.  “Mother said I must tell you to keep out o’\ndoors as much as you could, even when it rains a bit,\nso as tha’ wrap up warm.”",
        "Mary put on her coat and hat and took her skipping-rope\nover her arm.  She opened the door to go out, and then\nsuddenly thought of something and turned back rather slowly.",
        "“Martha,” she said, “they were your wages.  It was your\ntwo-pence really.  Thank you.” She said it stiffly\nbecause she was not used to thanking people or noticing\nthat they did things for her.  “Thank you,” she said,\nand held out her hand because she did not know what else\nto do.",
        "Martha gave her hand a clumsy little shake, as if she\nwas not accustomed to this sort of thing either.\nThen she laughed.",
        "“Eh! th’ art a queer, old-womanish thing,” she said.\n\"If tha’d been our ’Lizabeth Ellen tha’d have given me\na kiss.”",
        "Mary looked stiffer than ever.",
        "“Do you want me to kiss you?”",
        "Martha laughed again.",
        "“Nay, not me,” she answered.  “If tha’ was different,\np’raps tha’d want to thysel’. But tha’ isn’t. Run off\noutside an’ play with thy rope.”",
        "Mistress Mary felt a little awkward as she went out of\nthe room.  Yorkshire people seemed strange, and Martha was\nalways rather a puzzle to her.  At first she had disliked\nher very much, but now she did not.  The skipping-rope\nwas a wonderful thing.  She counted and skipped,\nand skipped and counted, until her cheeks were quite red,\nand she was more interested than she had ever been since\nshe was born.  The sun was shining and a little wind was\nblowing–not a rough wind, but one which came in delightful\nlittle gusts and brought a fresh scent of newly turned\nearth with it.  She skipped round the fountain garden,\nand up one walk and down another.  She skipped at last\ninto the kitchen-garden and saw Ben Weatherstaff digging\nand talking to his robin, which was hopping about him.\nShe skipped down the walk toward him and he lifted\nhis head and looked at her with a curious expression.\nShe had wondered if he would notice her.  She wanted him\nto see her skip.",
        "“Well!” he exclaimed.  “Upon my word.  P’raps tha’\nart a young ’un, after all, an’ p’raps tha’s got\nchild’s blood in thy veins instead of sour buttermilk.\nTha’s skipped red into thy cheeks as sure as my name’s\nBen Weatherstaff.  I wouldn’t have believed tha’\ncould do it.”",
        "“I never skipped before,” Mary said.  “I’m just beginning.\nI can only go up to twenty.”",
        "“Tha’ keep on,” said Ben.  “Tha’ shapes well enough at it\nfor a young ’un that’s lived with heathen.  Just see how\nhe’s watchin’ thee,” jerking his head toward the robin.\n\"He followed after thee yesterday.  He’ll be at it again today.\nHe’ll be bound to find out what th’ skippin’-rope is.\nHe’s never seen one.  Eh!” shaking his head at the bird,\n\"tha’ curiosity will be th’ death of thee sometime if tha’\ndoesn’t look sharp.”",
        "Mary skipped round all the gardens and round the orchard,\nresting every few minutes.  At length she went to her\nown special walk and made up her mind to try if she\ncould skip the whole length of it.  It was a good long\nskip and she began slowly, but before she had gone\nhalf-way down the path she was so hot and breathless\nthat she was obliged to stop.  She did not mind much,\nbecause she had already counted up to thirty.\nShe stopped with a little laugh of pleasure, and there,\nlo and behold, was the robin swaying on a long branch of ivy.\nHe had followed her and he greeted her with a chirp.\nAs Mary had skipped toward him she felt something heavy\nin her pocket strike against her at each jump, and when she\nsaw the robin she laughed again.",
        "“You showed me where the key was yesterday,” she said.\n\"You ought to show me the door today; but I don’t believe\nyou know!”",
        "The robin flew from his swinging spray of ivy on to the\ntop of the wall and he opened his beak and sang a loud,\nlovely trill, merely to show off.  Nothing in the world\nis quite as adorably lovely as a robin when he shows\noff–and they are nearly always doing it.",
        "Mary Lennox had heard a great deal about Magic in her\nAyah’s stories, and she always said that what happened\nalmost at that moment was Magic.",
        "One of the nice little gusts of wind rushed down\nthe walk, and it was a stronger one than the rest.\nIt was strong enough to wave the branches of the trees,\nand it was more than strong enough to sway the trailing\nsprays of untrimmed ivy hanging from the wall.  Mary had\nstepped close to the robin, and suddenly the gust of wind\nswung aside some loose ivy trails, and more suddenly\nstill she jumped toward it and caught it in her hand.\nThis she did because she had seen something under it–a round\nknob which had been covered by the leaves hanging over it.\nIt was the knob of a door.",
        "She put her hands under the leaves and began to pull\nand push them aside.  Thick as the ivy hung, it nearly\nall was a loose and swinging curtain, though some had crept\nover wood and iron.  Mary’s heart began to thump and her\nhands to shake a little in her delight and excitement.\nThe robin kept singing and twittering away and tilting\nhis head on one side, as if he were as excited as she was.\nWhat was this under her hands which was square and made\nof iron and which her fingers found a hole in?",
        "It was the lock of the door which had been closed ten\nyears and she put her hand in her pocket, drew out the key\nand found it fitted the keyhole.  She put the key in and\nturned it.  It took two hands to do it, but it did turn.",
        "And then she took a long breath and looked behind\nher up the long walk to see if any one was coming.\nNo one was coming.  No one ever did come, it seemed,\nand she took another long breath, because she could not\nhelp it, and she held back the swinging curtain of ivy\nand pushed back the door which opened slowly–slowly.",
        "Then she slipped through it, and shut it behind her,\nand stood with her back against it, looking about her\nand breathing quite fast with excitement, and wonder,\nand delight.",
        "She was standing inside the secret garden.",
        "It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place\nany one could imagine.  The high walls which shut it\nin were covered with the leafless stems of climbing roses\nwhich were so thick that they were matted together.\nMary Lennox knew they were roses because she had seen\na great many roses in India.  All the ground was covered\nwith grass of a wintry brown and out of it grew clumps\nof bushes which were surely rosebushes if they were alive.\nThere were numbers of standard roses which had so spread\ntheir branches that they were like little trees.\nThere were other trees in the garden, and one of the\nthings which made the place look strangest and loveliest\nwas that climbing roses had run all over them and swung\ndown long tendrils which made light swaying curtains,\nand here and there they had caught at each other or\nat a far-reaching branch and had crept from one tree\nto another and made lovely bridges of themselves.\nThere were neither leaves nor roses on them now and Mary\ndid not know whether they were dead or alive, but their\nthin gray or brown branches and sprays looked like a sort\nof hazy mantle spreading over everything, walls, and trees,\nand even brown grass, where they had fallen from their\nfastenings and run along the ground.  It was this hazy tangle\nfrom tree to tree which made it all look so mysterious.\nMary had thought it must be different from other gardens\nwhich had not been left all by themselves so long;\nand indeed it was different from any other place she had\never seen in her life.",
        "“How still it is!” she whispered.  “How still!”",
        "Then she waited a moment and listened at the stillness.\nThe robin, who had flown to his treetop, was still\nas all the rest.  He did not even flutter his wings;\nhe sat without stirring, and looked at Mary.",
        "“No wonder it is still,” she whispered again.  “I am\nthe first person who has spoken in here for ten years.”",
        "She moved away from the door, stepping as softly as if she\nwere afraid of awakening some one.  She was glad that there\nwas grass under her feet and that her steps made no sounds.\nShe walked under one of the fairy-like gray arches\nbetween the trees and looked up at the sprays and tendrils\nwhich formed them.  “I wonder if they are all quite dead,\"\nshe said.  “Is it all a quite dead garden? I wish it wasn’t.”",
        "If she had been Ben Weatherstaff she could have told\nwhether the wood was alive by looking at it, but she\ncould only see that there were only gray or brown sprays\nand branches and none showed any signs of even a tiny\nleaf-bud anywhere.",
        "But she was inside the wonderful garden and she could\ncome through the door under the ivy any time and she\nfelt as if she had found a world all her own.",
        "The sun was shining inside the four walls and the high arch\nof blue sky over this particular piece of Misselthwaite\nseemed even more brilliant and soft than it was over\nthe moor.  The robin flew down from his tree-top and\nhopped about or flew after her from one bush to another.\nHe chirped a good deal and had a very busy air, as if he\nwere showing her things.  Everything was strange and\nsilent and she seemed to be hundreds of miles away from\nany one, but somehow she did not feel lonely at all.\nAll that troubled her was her wish that she knew whether\nall the roses were dead, or if perhaps some of them had\nlived and might put out leaves and buds as the weather\ngot warmer.  She did not want it to be a quite dead garden.\nIf it were a quite alive garden, how wonderful it would be,\nand what thousands of roses would grow on every side!",
        "Her skipping-rope had hung over her arm when she came\nin and after she had walked about for a while she thought\nshe would skip round the whole garden, stopping when she\nwanted to look at things.  There seemed to have been\ngrass paths here and there, and in one or two corners\nthere were alcoves of evergreen with stone seats or tall\nmoss-covered flower urns in them.",
        "As she came near the second of these alcoves she\nstopped skipping.  There had once been a flowerbed in it,\nand she thought she saw something sticking out of the\nblack earth–some sharp little pale green points.\nShe remembered what Ben Weatherstaff had said and she\nknelt down to look at them.",
        "“Yes, they are tiny growing things and they might be\ncrocuses or snowdrops or daffodils,” she whispered.",
        "She bent very close to them and sniffed the fresh scent\nof the damp earth.  She liked it very much.",
        "“Perhaps there are some other ones coming up in other places,\"\nshe said.  “I will go all over the garden and look.”",
        "She did not skip, but walked.  She went slowly and kept\nher eyes on the ground.  She looked in the old border\nbeds and among the grass, and after she had gone round,\ntrying to miss nothing, she had found ever so many more sharp,\npale green points, and she had become quite excited again.",
        "“It isn’t a quite dead garden,” she cried out softly to herself.\n\"Even if the roses are dead, there are other things alive.”",
        "She did not know anything about gardening, but the grass\nseemed so thick in some of the places where the green\npoints were pushing their way through that she thought\nthey did not seem to have room enough to grow.\nShe searched about until she found a rather sharp piece\nof wood and knelt down and dug and weeded out the weeds\nand grass until she made nice little clear places around them.",
        "“Now they look as if they could breathe,” she said,\nafter she had finished with the first ones.  “I am\ngoing to do ever so many more.  I’ll do all I can see.\nIf I haven’t time today I can come tomorrow.”",
        "She went from place to place, and dug and weeded,\nand enjoyed herself so immensely that she was led on\nfrom bed to bed and into the grass under the trees.\nThe exercise made her so warm that she first threw her\ncoat off, and then her hat, and without knowing it she\nwas smiling down on to the grass and the pale green points\nall the time.",
        "The robin was tremendously busy.  He was very much\npleased to see gardening begun on his own estate.\nHe had often wondered at Ben Weatherstaff.  Where gardening\nis done all sorts of delightful things to eat are turned\nup with the soil.  Now here was this new kind of creature\nwho was not half Ben’s size and yet had had the sense\nto come into his garden and begin at once.",
        "Mistress Mary worked in her garden until it was time\nto go to her midday dinner.  In fact, she was rather\nlate in remembering, and when she put on her coat\nand hat, and picked up her skipping-rope, she could not\nbelieve that she had been working two or three hours.\nShe had been actually happy all the time; and dozens\nand dozens of the tiny, pale green points were to be seen\nin cleared places, looking twice as cheerful as they had\nlooked before when the grass and weeds had been smothering them.",
        "“I shall come back this afternoon,” she said, looking all\nround at her new kingdom, and speaking to the trees\nand the rose-bushes as if they heard her.",
        "Then she ran lightly across the grass, pushed open\nthe slow old door and slipped through it under the ivy.\nShe had such red cheeks and such bright eyes and ate such\na dinner that Martha was delighted.",
        "“Two pieces o’ meat an’ two helps o’ rice puddin’!” she said.\n\"Eh! mother will be pleased when I tell her what th’\nskippin’-rope’s done for thee.”",
        "In the course of her digging with her pointed stick\nMistress Mary had found herself digging up a sort of white\nroot rather like an onion.  She had put it back in its\nplace and patted the earth carefully down on it and just\nnow she wondered if Martha could tell her what it was.",
        "“Martha,” she said, “what are those white roots that look\nlike onions?”",
        "“They’re bulbs,” answered Martha.  “Lots o’ spring flowers\ngrow from ’em. Th’ very little ones are snowdrops an’\ncrocuses an’ th’ big ones are narcissuses an’ jonquils\nand daffydowndillys.  Th’ biggest of all is lilies an’\npurple flags.  Eh! they are nice.  Dickon’s got a whole\nlot of ’em planted in our bit o’ garden.”",
        "“Does Dickon know all about them?” asked Mary, a new idea\ntaking possession of her.",
        "“Our Dickon can make a flower grow out of a brick walk.\nMother says he just whispers things out o’ th’ ground.”",
        "“Do bulbs live a long time? Would they live years and\nyears if no one helped them?” inquired Mary anxiously.",
        "“They’re things as helps themselves,” said Martha.  “That’s why\npoor folk can afford to have ’em. If you don’t trouble ’em,\nmost of ’em’ll work away underground for a lifetime an’\nspread out an’ have little ’uns. There’s a place in th’\npark woods here where there’s snowdrops by thousands.\nThey’re the prettiest sight in Yorkshire when th’\nspring comes.  No one knows when they was first planted.”",
        "“I wish the spring was here now,” said Mary.  “I want\nto see all the things that grow in England.”",
        "She had finished her dinner and gone to her favorite seat\non the hearth-rug.",
        "“I wish–I wish I had a little spade,” she said.\n\"Whatever does tha’ want a spade for?” asked Martha, laughing.\n\"Art tha’ goin’ to take to diggin’? I must tell mother that,\ntoo.”",
        "Mary looked at the fire and pondered a little.  She must\nbe careful if she meant to keep her secret kingdom.\nShe wasn’t doing any harm, but if Mr. Craven found out\nabout the open door he would be fearfully angry and get\na new key and lock it up forevermore.  She really could\nnot bear that.",
        "“This is such a big lonely place,” she said slowly, as if she\nwere turning matters over in her mind.  “The house is lonely,\nand the park is lonely, and the gardens are lonely.\nSo many places seem shut up.  I never did many things\nin India, but there were more people to look at–natives\nand soldiers marching by–and sometimes bands playing,\nand my Ayah told me stories.  There is no one to talk to\nhere except you and Ben Weatherstaff.  And you have to do\nyour work and Ben Weatherstaff won’t speak to me often.\nI thought if I had a little spade I could dig somewhere\nas he does, and I might make a little garden if he would\ngive me some seeds.”",
        "Martha’s face quite lighted up.",
        "“There now!” she exclaimed, “if that wasn’t one of th’\nthings mother said.  She says, `There’s such a lot o’\nroom in that big place, why don’t they give her a\nbit for herself, even if she doesn’t plant nothin’\nbut parsley an’ radishes? She’d dig an’ rake away an’\nbe right down happy over it.’ Them was the very words\nshe said.”",
        "“Were they?” said Mary.  “How many things she knows,\ndoesn’t she?”",
        "“Eh!” said Martha.  “It’s like she says: `A woman as\nbrings up twelve children learns something besides her A\nB C. Children’s as good as ’rithmetic to set you findin’\nout things.’”",
        "“How much would a spade cost–a little one?” Mary asked.",
        "“Well,” was Martha’s reflective answer, “at Thwaite\nvillage there’s a shop or so an’ I saw little garden sets\nwith a spade an’ a rake an’ a fork all tied together for\ntwo shillings.  An’ they was stout enough to work with, too.”",
        "“I’ve got more than that in my purse,” said Mary.\n\"Mrs. Morrison gave me five shillings and Mrs. Medlock\ngave me some money from Mr. Craven.”",
        "“Did he remember thee that much?” exclaimed Martha.",
        "“Mrs. Medlock said I was to have a shilling a week to spend.\nShe gives me one every Saturday.  I didn’t know what to\nspend it on.”",
        "“My word! that’s riches,” said Martha.  “Tha’ can buy\nanything in th’ world tha’ wants.  Th’ rent of our\ncottage is only one an’ threepence an’ it’s like pullin’\neye-teeth to get it.  Now I’ve just thought of somethin’,\"\nputting her hands on her hips.",
        "“What?” said Mary eagerly.",
        "“In the shop at Thwaite they sell packages o’\nflower-seeds for a penny each, and our Dickon he knows\nwhich is th’ prettiest ones an, how to make ’em grow.\nHe walks over to Thwaite many a day just for th’ fun of it.\nDoes tha’ know how to print letters?” suddenly.",
        "“I know how to write,” Mary answered.",
        "Martha shook her head.",
        "“Our Dickon can only read printin’. If tha’ could print we\ncould write a letter to him an’ ask him to go an’ buy th’\ngarden tools an’ th’ seeds at th’ same time.”",
        "“Oh! you’re a good girl!” Mary cried.  “You are, really! I\ndidn’t know you were so nice.  I know I can print letters\nif I try.  Let’s ask Mrs. Medlock for a pen and ink and some\npaper.”",
        "“I’ve got some of my own,” said Martha.  “I bought ’em\nso I could print a bit of a letter to mother of a Sunday.\nI’ll go and get it.” She ran out of the room, and Mary stood\nby the fire and twisted her thin little hands together\nwith sheer pleasure.",
        "“If I have a spade,” she whispered, “I can make the earth\nnice and soft and dig up weeds.  If I have seeds and can\nmake flowers grow the garden won’t be dead at all–it\nwill come alive.”",
        "She did not go out again that afternoon because when Martha\nreturned with her pen and ink and paper she was obliged\nto clear the table and carry the plates and dishes\ndownstairs and when she got into the kitchen Mrs. Medlock\nwas there and told her to do something, so Mary waited\nfor what seemed to her a long time before she came back.\nThen it was a serious piece of work to write to Dickon.\nMary had been taught very little because her governesses\nhad disliked her too much to stay with her.  She could\nnot spell particularly well but she found that she could\nprint letters when she tried.  This was the letter Martha\ndictated to her: “My Dear Dickon:",
        "This comes hoping to find you well as it leaves me at present.\nMiss Mary has plenty of money and will you go to Thwaite\nand buy her some flower seeds and a set of garden tools\nto make a flower-bed. Pick the prettiest ones and easy\nto grow because she has never done it before and lived\nin India which is different.  Give my love to mother\nand every one of you.  Miss Mary is going to tell me a lot\nmore so that on my next day out you can hear about elephants\nand camels and gentlemen going hunting lions and tigers.",
        "                     “Your loving sister,\n                     Martha Phoebe Sowerby.”",
        "“We’ll put the money in th’ envelope an’ I’ll get th’\nbutcher boy to take it in his cart.  He’s a great\nfriend o’ Dickon’s,” said Martha.",
        "“How shall I get the things when Dickon buys them?”",
        "“He’ll bring ’em to you himself.  He’ll like to walk\nover this way.”",
        "“Oh!” exclaimed Mary, “then I shall see him! I never\nthought I should see Dickon.”",
        "“Does tha’ want to see him?” asked Martha suddenly,\nfor Mary had looked so pleased.",
        "“Yes, I do.  I never saw a boy foxes and crows loved.\nI want to see him very much.”",
        "Martha gave a little start, as if she remembered something.\n\"Now to think,” she broke out, “to think o’ me forgettin’\nthat there; an’ I thought I was goin’ to tell you first\nthing this mornin’. I asked mother–and she said she’d ask\nMrs. Medlock her own self.”",
        "“Do you mean–” Mary began.",
        "“What I said Tuesday.  Ask her if you might be driven over\nto our cottage some day and have a bit o’ mother’s hot\noat cake, an’ butter, an’ a glass o’ milk.”",
        "It seemed as if all the interesting things were happening\nin one day.  To think of going over the moor in the\ndaylight and when the sky was blue! To think of going\ninto the cottage which held twelve children!",
        "“Does she think Mrs. Medlock would let me go?” she asked,\nquite anxiously.",
        "“Aye, she thinks she would.  She knows what a tidy woman\nmother is and how clean she keeps the cottage.”",
        "“If I went I should see your mother as well as Dickon,\"\nsaid Mary, thinking it over and liking the idea very much.\n\"She doesn’t seem to be like the mothers in India.”",
        "Her work in the garden and the excitement of the afternoon\nended by making her feel quiet and thoughtful.  Martha stayed\nwith her until tea-time, but they sat in comfortable\nquiet and talked very little.  But just before Martha\nwent downstairs for the tea-tray, Mary asked a question.",
        "“Martha,” she said, “has the scullery-maid had the\ntoothache again today?”",
        "Martha certainly started slightly.",
        "“What makes thee ask that?” she said.",
        "“Because when I waited so long for you to come back I\nopened the door and walked down the corridor to see if you\nwere coming.  And I heard that far-off crying again,\njust as we heard it the other night.  There isn’t\na wind today, so you see it couldn’t have been the wind.”",
        "“Eh!” said Martha restlessly.  “Tha’ mustn’t go walkin’\nabout in corridors an’ listenin’. Mr. Craven would be\nthat there angry there’s no knowin’ what he’d do.”",
        "“I wasn’t listening,” said Mary.  “I was just waiting\nfor you–and I heard it.  That’s three times.”",
        "“My word! There’s Mrs. Medlock’s bell,” said Martha,\nand she almost ran out of the room.",
        "“It’s the strangest house any one ever lived in,\"\nsaid Mary drowsily, as she dropped her head on the cushioned\nseat of the armchair near her.  Fresh air, and digging,\nand skipping-rope had made her feel so comfortably tired\nthat she fell asleep.",
        "The sun shone down for nearly a week on the secret garden.\nThe Secret Garden was what Mary called it when she was\nthinking of it.  She liked the name, and she liked still\nmore the feeling that when its beautiful old walls shut\nher in no one knew where she was.  It seemed almost like\nbeing shut out of the world in some fairy place.  The few\nbooks she had read and liked had been fairy-story books,\nand she had read of secret gardens in some of the stories.\nSometimes people went to sleep in them for a hundred years,\nwhich she had thought must be rather stupid.  She had no\nintention of going to sleep, and, in fact, she was becoming\nwider awake every day which passed at Misselthwaite.\nShe was beginning to like to be out of doors; she no longer\nhated the wind, but enjoyed it.  She could run faster,\nand longer, and she could skip up to a hundred.  The bulbs\nin the secret garden must have been much astonished.\nSuch nice clear places were made round them that they\nhad all the breathing space they wanted, and really,\nif Mistress Mary had known it, they began to cheer up\nunder the dark earth and work tremendously.  The sun could\nget at them and warm them, and when the rain came down\nit could reach them at once, so they began to feel very\nmuch alive.",
        "Mary was an odd, determined little person, and now she\nhad something interesting to be determined about,\nshe was very much absorbed, indeed.  She worked and dug\nand pulled up weeds steadily, only becoming more pleased\nwith her work every hour instead of tiring of it.\nIt seemed to her like a fascinating sort of play.\nShe found many more of the sprouting pale green points than\nshe had ever hoped to find.  They seemed to be starting up\neverywhere and each day she was sure she found tiny new ones,\nsome so tiny that they barely peeped above the earth.\nThere were so many that she remembered what Martha had\nsaid about the “snowdrops by the thousands,” and about\nbulbs spreading and making new ones.  These had been left\nto themselves for ten years and perhaps they had spread,\nlike the snowdrops, into thousands.  She wondered how long\nit would be before they showed that they were flowers.\nSometimes she stopped digging to look at the garden and\ntry to imagine what it would be like when it was covered\nwith thousands of lovely things in bloom.  During that week\nof sunshine, she became more intimate with Ben Weatherstaff.\nShe surprised him several times by seeming to start\nup beside him as if she sprang out of the earth.\nThe truth was that she was afraid that he would pick up\nhis tools and go away if he saw her coming, so she always\nwalked toward him as silently as possible.  But, in fact,\nhe did not object to her as strongly as he had at first.\nPerhaps he was secretly rather flattered by her evident\ndesire for his elderly company.  Then, also, she was more\ncivil than she had been.  He did not know that when she\nfirst saw him she spoke to him as she would have spoken\nto a native, and had not known that a cross, sturdy old\nYorkshire man was not accustomed to salaam to his masters,\nand be merely commanded by them to do things.",
        "“Tha’rt like th’ robin,” he said to her one morning\nwhen he lifted his head and saw her standing by him.\n\"I never knows when I shall see thee or which side tha’ll\ncome from.”",
        "“He’s friends with me now,” said Mary.",
        "“That’s like him,” snapped Ben Weatherstaff.  “Makin’ up\nto th’ women folk just for vanity an’ flightiness.\nThere’s nothin’ he wouldn’t do for th’ sake o’ showin’\noff an’ flirtin’ his tail-feathers. He’s as full o’\npride as an egg’s full o’ meat.”",
        "He very seldom talked much and sometimes did not even answer\nMary’s questions except by a grunt, but this morning he\nsaid more than usual.  He stood up and rested one hobnailed\nboot on the top of his spade while he looked her over.",
        "“How long has tha’ been here?” he jerked out.",
        "“I think it’s about a month,” she answered.",
        "“Tha’s beginnin’ to do Misselthwaite credit,” he said.\n\"Tha’s a bit fatter than tha’ was an’ tha’s not quite\nso yeller.  Tha’ looked like a young plucked crow when tha’\nfirst came into this garden.  Thinks I to myself I never set\neyes on an uglier, sourer faced young ’un.”",
        "Mary was not vain and as she had never thought much\nof her looks she was not greatly disturbed.",
        "“I know I’m fatter,” she said.  “My stockings\nare getting tighter.  They used to make wrinkles.\nThere’s the robin, Ben Weatherstaff.”",
        "There, indeed, was the robin, and she thought he looked\nnicer than ever.  His red waistcoat was as glossy as satin\nand he flirted his wings and tail and tilted his head\nand hopped about with all sorts of lively graces.\nHe seemed determined to make Ben Weatherstaff admire him.\nBut Ben was sarcastic.",
        "“Aye, there tha’ art!” he said.  “Tha’ can put up with\nme for a bit sometimes when tha’s got no one better.\nTha’s been reddenin’ up thy waistcoat an’ polishin’\nthy feathers this two weeks.  I know what tha’s up to.\nTha’s courtin’ some bold young madam somewhere tellin’\nthy lies to her about bein’ th’ finest cock robin on Missel\nMoor an’ ready to fight all th’ rest of ’em.”",
        "“Oh! look at him!” exclaimed Mary.",
        "The robin was evidently in a fascinating, bold mood.\nHe hopped closer and closer and looked at Ben Weatherstaff\nmore and more engagingly.  He flew on to the nearest\ncurrant bush and tilted his head and sang a little song\nright at him.",
        "“Tha’ thinks tha’ll get over me by doin’ that,” said Ben,\nwrinkling his face up in such a way that Mary felt sure he\nwas trying not to look pleased.  “Tha’ thinks no one can\nstand out against thee–that’s what tha’ thinks.”",
        "The robin spread his wings–Mary could scarcely believe\nher eyes.  He flew right up to the handle of Ben\nWeatherstaff’s spade and alighted on the top of it.\nThen the old man’s face wrinkled itself slowly into\na new expression.  He stood still as if he were afraid\nto breathe–as if he would not have stirred for the world,\nlest his robin should start away.  He spoke quite in a whisper.",
        "“Well, I’m danged!” he said as softly as if he were saying\nsomething quite different.  “Tha’ does know how to get at\na chap–tha’ does! Tha’s fair unearthly, tha’s so knowin’.”",
        "And he stood without stirring–almost without drawing\nhis breath–until the robin gave another flirt to his\nwings and flew away.  Then he stood looking at the handle\nof the spade as if there might be Magic in it, and then\nhe began to dig again and said nothing for several minutes.",
        "But because he kept breaking into a slow grin now and then,\nMary was not afraid to talk to him.",
        "“Have you a garden of your own?” she asked.",
        "“No. I’m bachelder an’ lodge with Martin at th’ gate.”",
        "“If you had one,” said Mary, “what would you plant?”",
        "“Cabbages an’ ’taters an’ onions.”",
        "“But if you wanted to make a flower garden,” persisted Mary,\n\"what would you plant?”",
        "“Bulbs an’ sweet-smellin’ things–but mostly roses.”",
        "Mary’s face lighted up.",
        "“Do you like roses?” she said.",
        "Ben Weatherstaff rooted up a weed and threw it aside\nbefore he answered.",
        "“Well, yes, I do.  I was learned that by a young lady I\nwas gardener to.  She had a lot in a place she was fond\nof, an’ she loved ’em like they was children–or robins.\nI’ve seen her bend over an’ kiss ’em.” He dragged out another\nweed and scowled at it.  “That were as much as ten year’ ago.”",
        "“Where is she now?” asked Mary, much interested.",
        "“Heaven,” he answered, and drove his spade deep into\nthe soil, “’cording to what parson says.”",
        "“What happened to the roses?” Mary asked again,\nmore interested than ever.",
        "“They was left to themselves.”",
        "Mary was becoming quite excited.",
        "“Did they quite die? Do roses quite die when they are\nleft to themselves?” she ventured.",
        "“Well, I’d got to like ’em–an’ I liked her–an’\nshe liked ’em,” Ben Weatherstaff admitted reluctantly.\n\"Once or twice a year I’d go an’ work at ’em a bit–prune\n’em an’ dig about th’ roots.  They run wild, but they was\nin rich soil, so some of ’em lived.”",
        "“When they have no leaves and look gray and brown and dry,\nhow can you tell whether they are dead or alive?\"\ninquired Mary.",
        "“Wait till th’ spring gets at ’em–wait till th’ sun shines\non th’ rain and th’ rain falls on th’ sunshine an’\nthen tha’ll find out.”",
        "“How–how?” cried Mary, forgetting to be careful.\n\"Look along th’ twigs an’ branches an’ if tha’ see a bit\nof a brown lump swelling here an’ there, watch it after th’\nwarm rain an’ see what happens.” He stopped suddenly\nand looked curiously at her eager face.  “Why does tha’\ncare so much about roses an’ such, all of a sudden?\"\nhe demanded.",
        "Mistress Mary felt her face grow red.  She was almost\nafraid to answer.",
        "“I–I want to play that–that I have a garden of my own,\"\nshe stammered.  “I–there is nothing for me to do.\nI have nothing–and no one.”",
        "“Well,” said Ben Weatherstaff slowly, as he watched her,\n\"that’s true.  Tha’ hasn’t.”",
        "He said it in such an odd way that Mary wondered if he\nwas actually a little sorry for her.  She had never felt\nsorry for herself; she had only felt tired and cross,\nbecause she disliked people and things so much.\nBut now the world seemed to be changing and getting nicer.\nIf no one found out about the secret garden, she should\nenjoy herself always.",
        "She stayed with him for ten or fifteen minutes longer and\nasked him as many questions as she dared.  He answered every\none of them in his queer grunting way and he did not seem\nreally cross and did not pick up his spade and leave her.\nHe said something about roses just as she was going away\nand it reminded her of the ones he had said he had been\nfond of.",
        "“Do you go and see those other roses now?” she asked.",
        "“Not been this year.  My rheumatics has made me too stiff\nin th’ joints.”",
        "He said it in his grumbling voice, and then quite suddenly\nhe seemed to get angry with her, though she did not see\nwhy he should.",
        "“Now look here!” he said sharply.  “Don’t tha’\nask so many questions.  Tha’rt th’ worst wench for askin’\nquestions I’ve ever come a cross.  Get thee gone an’\nplay thee.  I’ve done talkin’ for today.”",
        "And he said it so crossly that she knew there was not\nthe least use in staying another minute.  She went\nskipping slowly down the outside walk, thinking him over\nand saying to herself that, queer as it was, here was\nanother person whom she liked in spite of his crossness.\nShe liked old Ben Weatherstaff.  Yes, she did like him.\nShe always wanted to try to make him talk to her.\nAlso she began to believe that he knew everything in the\nworld about flowers.",
        "There was a laurel-hedged walk which curved round the secret\ngarden and ended at a gate which opened into a wood,\nin the park.  She thought she would slip round this walk\nand look into the wood and see if there were any rabbits\nhopping about.  She enjoyed the skipping very much and\nwhen she reached the little gate she opened it and went\nthrough because she heard a low, peculiar whistling\nsound and wanted to find out what it was.",
        "It was a very strange thing indeed.  She quite caught her\nbreath as she stopped to look at it.  A boy was sitting\nunder a tree, with his back against it, playing on a rough\nwooden pipe.  He was a funny looking boy about twelve.\nHe looked very clean and his nose turned up and his\ncheeks were as red as poppies and never had Mistress Mary\nseen such round and such blue eyes in any boy’s face.\nAnd on the trunk of the tree he leaned against, a brown\nsquirrel was clinging and watching him, and from behind\na bush nearby a cock pheasant was delicately stretching\nhis neck to peep out, and quite near him were two rabbits\nsitting up and sniffing with tremulous noses–and actually\nit appeared as if they were all drawing near to watch him\nand listen to the strange low little call his pipe seemed\nto make.",
        "When he saw Mary he held up his hand and spoke to her\nin a voice almost as low as and rather like his piping.",
        "“Don’t tha’ move,” he said.  “It’d flight ’em.” Mary\nremained motionless.  He stopped playing his pipe and began\nto rise from the ground.  He moved so slowly that it scarcely\nseemed as though he were moving at all, but at last he\nstood on his feet and then the squirrel scampered back\nup into the branches of his tree, the pheasant withdrew\nhis head and the rabbits dropped on all fours and began\nto hop away, though not at all as if they were frightened.",
        "“I’m Dickon,” the boy said.  “I know tha’rt Miss Mary.”",
        "Then Mary realized that somehow she had known at first that\nhe was Dickon.  Who else could have been charming rabbits\nand pheasants as the natives charm snakes in India? He had\na wide, red, curving mouth and his smile spread all over his\nface.",
        "“I got up slow,” he explained, “because if tha’ makes a\nquick move it startles ’em. A body ’as to move gentle an’\nspeak low when wild things is about.”",
        "He did not speak to her as if they had never seen\neach other before but as if he knew her quite well.\nMary knew nothing about boys and she spoke to him a little\nstiffly because she felt rather shy.",
        "“Did you get Martha’s letter?” she asked.",
        "He nodded his curly, rust-colored head.  “That’s why\nI come.”",
        "He stooped to pick up something which had been lying\non the ground beside him when he piped.",
        "“I’ve got th’ garden tools.  There’s a little spade an’\nrake an’ a fork an’ hoe.  Eh! they are good ’uns. There’s\na trowel, too.  An’ th’ woman in th’ shop threw in a packet o’\nwhite poppy an’ one o’ blue larkspur when I bought th’\nother seeds.”",
        "“Will you show the seeds to me?” Mary said.",
        "She wished she could talk as he did.  His speech\nwas so quick and easy.  It sounded as if he liked her\nand was not the least afraid she would not like him,\nthough he was only a common moor boy, in patched clothes\nand with a funny face and a rough, rusty-red head.\nAs she came closer to him she noticed that there was a clean\nfresh scent of heather and grass and leaves about him,\nalmost as if he were made of them.  She liked it very much\nand when she looked into his funny face with the red\ncheeks and round blue eyes she forgot that she had felt shy.",
        "“Let us sit down on this log and look at them,” she said.",
        "They sat down and he took a clumsy little brown paper\npackage out of his coat pocket.  He untied the string\nand inside there were ever so many neater and smaller\npackages with a picture of a flower on each one.",
        "“There’s a lot o’ mignonette an’ poppies,” he said.\n\"Mignonette’s th’ sweetest smellin’ thing as grows, an’\nit’ll grow wherever you cast it, same as poppies will.\nThem as’ll come up an’ bloom if you just whistle to ’em,\nthem’s th’ nicest of all.” He stopped and turned his\nhead quickly, his poppy-cheeked face lighting up.",
        "“Where’s that robin as is callin’ us?” he said.",
        "The chirp came from a thick holly bush, bright with\nscarlet berries, and Mary thought she knew whose it was.",
        "“Is it really calling us?” she asked.",
        "“Aye,” said Dickon, as if it was the most natural thing\nin the world, “he’s callin’ some one he’s friends with.\nThat’s same as sayin’ `Here I am.  Look at me.\nI wants a bit of a chat.’ There he is in the bush.\nWhose is he?”",
        "“He’s Ben Weatherstaff’s, but I think he knows me a little,\"\nanswered Mary.",
        "“Aye, he knows thee,” said Dickon in his low voice again.\n\"An’ he likes thee.  He’s took thee on.  He’ll tell me all\nabout thee in a minute.”",
        "He moved quite close to the bush with the slow movement Mary\nhad noticed before, and then he made a sound almost like\nthe robin’s own twitter.  The robin listened a few seconds,\nintently, and then answered quite as if he were replying to a\nquestion.",
        "“Aye, he’s a friend o’ yours,” chuckled Dickon.",
        "“Do you think he is?” cried Mary eagerly.  She did so want\nto know.  “Do you think he really likes me?”",
        "“He wouldn’t come near thee if he didn’t,” answered Dickon.\n\"Birds is rare choosers an’ a robin can flout a body worse\nthan a man.  See, he’s making up to thee now.  `Cannot tha’\nsee a chap?’ he’s sayin’.”",
        "And it really seemed as if it must be true.  He so sidled\nand twittered and tilted as he hopped on his bush.",
        "“Do you understand everything birds say?” said Mary.",
        "Dickon’s grin spread until he seemed all wide, red,\ncurving mouth, and he rubbed his rough head.",
        "“I think I do, and they think I do,” he said.  “I’ve lived on th’\nmoor with ’em so long.  I’ve watched ’em break shell an’\ncome out an’ fledge an’ learn to fly an’ begin to sing,\ntill I think I’m one of ’em. Sometimes I think p’raps\nI’m a bird, or a fox, or a rabbit, or a squirrel,\nor even a beetle, an’ I don’t know it.”",
        "He laughed and came back to the log and began to talk\nabout the flower seeds again.  He told her what they looked\nlike when they were flowers; he told her how to plant them,\nand watch them, and feed and water them.",
        "“See here,” he said suddenly, turning round to look at her.\n\"I’ll plant them for thee myself.  Where is tha’ garden?”",
        "Mary’s thin hands clutched each other as they lay on\nher lap.  She did not know what to say, so for a whole\nminute she said nothing.  She had never thought of this.\nShe felt miserable.  And she felt as if she went red\nand then pale.",
        "“Tha’s got a bit o’ garden, hasn’t tha’?” Dickon said.",
        "It was true that she had turned red and then pale.\nDickon saw her do it, and as she still said nothing,\nhe began to be puzzled.",
        "“Wouldn’t they give thee a bit?” he asked.  “Hasn’t tha’\ngot any yet?”",
        "She held her hands tighter and turned her eyes toward him.",
        "“I don’t know anything about boys,” she said slowly.\n\"Could you keep a secret, if I told you one? It’s a great secret.\nI don’t know what I should do if any one found it out.\nI believe I should die!” She said the last sentence\nquite fiercely.",
        "Dickon looked more puzzled than ever and even rubbed\nhis hand over his rough head again, but he answered quite\ngood-humoredly. “I’m keepin’ secrets all th’ time,” he said.\n\"If I couldn’t keep secrets from th’ other lads,\nsecrets about foxes’ cubs, an’ birds’ nests, an’ wild things’\nholes, there’d be naught safe on th’ moor.  Aye, I can\nkeep secrets.”",
        "Mistress Mary did not mean to put out her hand and clutch\nhis sleeve but she did it.",
        "“I’ve stolen a garden,” she said very fast.  “It isn’t mine.\nIt isn’t anybody’s. Nobody wants it, nobody cares for it,\nnobody ever goes into it.  Perhaps everything is dead in\nit already.  I don’t know.”",
        "She began to feel hot and as contrary as she had ever\nfelt in her life.",
        "“I don’t care, I don’t care! Nobody has any right\nto take it from me when I care about it and they\ndon’t. They’re letting it die, all shut in by itself,\"\nshe ended passionately, and she threw her arms over\nher face and burst out crying-poor little Mistress Mary.",
        "Dickon’s curious blue eyes grew rounder and rounder.\n\"Eh-h-h!” he said, drawing his exclamation out slowly,\nand the way he did it meant both wonder and sympathy.",
        "“I’ve nothing to do,” said Mary.  “Nothing belongs to me.\nI found it myself and I got into it myself.  I was only just\nlike the robin, and they wouldn’t take it from the robin.\"\n\"Where is it?” asked Dickon in a dropped voice.",
        "Mistress Mary got up from the log at once.  She knew she\nfelt contrary again, and obstinate, and she did not care\nat all.  She was imperious and Indian, and at the same\ntime hot and sorrowful.",
        "“Come with me and I’ll show you,” she said.",
        "She led him round the laurel path and to the walk where the\nivy grew so thickly.  Dickon followed her with a queer,\nalmost pitying, look on his face.  He felt as if he were\nbeing led to look at some strange bird’s nest and must\nmove softly.  When she stepped to the wall and lifted\nthe hanging ivy he started.  There was a door and Mary\npushed it slowly open and they passed in together,\nand then Mary stood and waved her hand round defiantly.",
        "“It’s this,” she said.  “It’s a secret garden, and I’m\nthe only one in the world who wants it to be alive.”",
        "Dickon looked round and round about it, and round\nand round again.",
        "“Eh!” he almost whispered, “it is a queer, pretty place!\nIt’s like as if a body was in a dream.”",
        "For two or three minutes he stood looking round him,\nwhile Mary watched him, and then he began to walk\nabout softly, even more lightly than Mary had walked the\nfirst time she had found herself inside the four walls.\nHis eyes seemed to be taking in everything–the gray trees\nwith the gray creepers climbing over them and hanging\nfrom their branches, the tangle on the walls and among\nthe grass, the evergreen alcoves with the stone seats\nand tall flower urns standing in them.",
        "“I never thought I’d see this place,” he said at last,\nin a whisper.",
        "“Did you know about it?” asked Mary.",
        "She had spoken aloud and he made a sign to her.",
        "“We must talk low,” he said, “or some one’ll hear us an’\nwonder what’s to do in here.”",
        "“Oh! I forgot!” said Mary, feeling frightened and putting\nher hand quickly against her mouth.  “Did you know about\nthe garden?” she asked again when she had recovered herself.\nDickon nodded.",
        "“Martha told me there was one as no one ever went inside,\"\nhe answered.  “Us used to wonder what it was like.”",
        "He stopped and looked round at the lovely gray tangle\nabout him, and his round eyes looked queerly happy.",
        "“Eh! the nests as’ll be here come springtime,” he said.\n\"It’d be th’ safest nestin’ place in England.\nNo one never comin’ near an’ tangles o’ trees an’\nroses to build in.  I wonder all th’ birds on th’\nmoor don’t build here.”",
        "Mistress Mary put her hand on his arm again without\nknowing it.",
        "“Will there be roses?” she whispered.  “Can you tell? I\nthought perhaps they were all dead.”",
        "“Eh! No! Not them–not all of ’em!” he answered.\n\"Look here!”",
        "He stepped over to the nearest tree–an old, old one with\ngray lichen all over its bark, but upholding a curtain\nof tangled sprays and branches.  He took a thick knife\nout of his Pocket and opened one of its blades.",
        "“There’s lots o’ dead wood as ought to be cut out,” he said.\n\"An’ there’s a lot o’ old wood, but it made some new\nlast year.  This here’s a new bit,” and he touched a shoot\nwhich looked brownish green instead of hard, dry gray.\nMary touched it herself in an eager, reverent way.",
        "“That one?” she said.  “Is that one quite alive quite?”",
        "Dickon curved his wide smiling mouth.",
        "“It’s as wick as you or me,” he said; and Mary remembered\nthat Martha had told her that “wick” meant “alive\"\nor “lively.”",
        "“I’m glad it’s wick!” she cried out in her whisper.\n\"I want them all to be wick.  Let us go round the garden\nand count how many wick ones there are.”",
        "She quite panted with eagerness, and Dickon was as eager\nas she was.  They went from tree to tree and from bush\nto bush.  Dickon carried his knife in his hand and showed\nher things which she thought wonderful.",
        "“They’ve run wild,” he said, “but th’ strongest ones\nhas fair thrived on it.  The delicatest ones has\ndied out, but th’ others has growed an’ growed, an’\nspread an’ spread, till they’s a wonder.  See here!\"\nand he pulled down a thick gray, dry-looking branch.\n\"A body might think this was dead wood, but I don’t believe\nit is–down to th’ root.  I’ll cut it low down an’ see.”",
        "He knelt and with his knife cut the lifeless-looking\nbranch through, not far above the earth.",
        "“There!” he said exultantly.  “I told thee so.\nThere’s green in that wood yet.  Look at it.”",
        "Mary was down on her knees before he spoke, gazing with\nall her might.",
        "“When it looks a bit greenish an’ juicy like that,\nit’s wick,” he explained.  “When th’ inside is dry an’\nbreaks easy, like this here piece I’ve cut off,\nit’s done for.  There’s a big root here as all this live\nwood sprung out of, an’ if th’ old wood’s cut off an’\nit’s dug round, and took care of there’ll be–\"\nhe stopped and lifted his face to look up at the climbing\nand hanging sprays above him–\"there’ll be a fountain o’\nroses here this summer.”",
        "They went from bush to bush and from tree to tree.\nHe was very strong and clever with his knife and knew\nhow to cut the dry and dead wood away, and could tell when\nan unpromising bough or twig had still green life in it.\nIn the course of half an hour Mary thought she could tell too,\nand when he cut through a lifeless-looking branch she would\ncry out joyfully under her breath when she caught sight\nof the least shade of moist green.  The spade, and hoe,\nand fork were very useful.  He showed her how to use the\nfork while he dug about roots with the spade and stirred\nthe earth and let the air in.",
        "They were working industriously round one of the biggest\nstandard roses when he caught sight of something which\nmade him utter an exclamation of surprise.",
        "“Why!” he cried, pointing to the grass a few feet away.\n\"Who did that there?”",
        "It was one of Mary’s own little clearings round the pale\ngreen points.",
        "“I did it,” said Mary.",
        "“Why, I thought tha’ didn’t know nothin’ about gardenin’,\"\nhe exclaimed.",
        "“I don’t,” she answered, “but they were so little, and the\ngrass was so thick and strong, and they looked as if they\nhad no room to breathe.  So I made a place for them.\nI don’t even know what they are.”",
        "Dickon went and knelt down by them, smiling his wide smile.",
        "“Tha’ was right,” he said.  “A gardener couldn’t have told\nthee better.  They’ll grow now like Jack’s bean-stalk. They’re\ncrocuses an’ snowdrops, an’ these here is narcissuses,\"\nturning to another patch, “an here’s daffydowndillys.\nEh! they will be a sight.”",
        "He ran from one clearing to another.",
        "“Tha’ has done a lot o’ work for such a little wench,\"\nhe said, looking her over.",
        "“I’m growing fatter,” said Mary, “and I’m growing stronger.\nI used always to be tired.  When I dig I’m not tired at all.\nI like to smell the earth when it’s turned up.”",
        "“It’s rare good for thee,” he said, nodding his\nhead wisely.  “There’s naught as nice as th’ smell o’\ngood clean earth, except th’ smell o’ fresh growin’\nthings when th’ rain falls on ’em. I get out on th’\nmoor many a day when it’s rainin’ an’ I lie under a bush an’\nlisten to th’ soft swish o’ drops on th’ heather an,\nI just sniff an, sniff.  My nose end fair quivers like a\nrabbit’s, mother says.”",
        "“Do you never catch cold?” inquired Mary, gazing at\nhim wonderingly.  She had never seen such a funny boy,\nor such a nice one.",
        "“Not me,” he said, grinning.  “I never ketched cold\nsince I was born.  I wasn’t brought up nesh enough.\nI’ve chased about th’ moor in all weathers same as th’\nrabbits does.  Mother says I’ve sniffed up too much fresh\nair for twelve year’ to ever get to sniffin’ with cold.\nI’m as tough as a white-thorn knobstick.”",
        "He was working all the time he was talking and Mary was\nfollowing him and helping him with her fork or the trowel.",
        "“There’s a lot of work to do here!” he said once,\nlooking about quite exultantly.",
        "“Will you come again and help me to do it?” Mary begged.\n\"I’m sure I can help, too.  I can dig and pull up weeds,\nand do whatever you tell me.  Oh! do come, Dickon!”",
        "“I’ll come every day if tha’ wants me, rain or shine,\"\nhe answered stoutly.  “It’s the best fun I ever had in my\nlife–shut in here an’ wakenin’ up a garden.”",
        "“If you will come,” said Mary, “if you will help me\nto make it alive I’ll–I don’t know what I’ll do,\"\nshe ended helplessly.  What could you do for a boy like that?",
        "“I’ll tell thee what tha’ll do,” said Dickon, with his\nhappy grin.  “Tha’ll get fat an’ tha’ll get as hungry\nas a young fox an’ tha’ll learn how to talk to th’\nrobin same as I do.  Eh! we’ll have a lot o’ fun.”",
        "He began to walk about, looking up in the trees and at\nthe walls and bushes with a thoughtful expression.",
        "“I wouldn’t want to make it look like a gardener’s\ngarden, all clipped an’ spick an’ span, would you?\"\nhe said.  “It’s nicer like this with things runnin’\nwild, an’ swingin’ an’ catchin’ hold of each other.”",
        "“Don’t let us make it tidy,” said Mary anxiously.\n\"It wouldn’t seem like a secret garden if it was tidy.”",
        "Dickon stood rubbing his rusty-red head with a rather\npuzzled look.  “It’s a secret garden sure enough,” he said,\n\"but seems like some one besides th’ robin must have been\nin it since it was shut up ten year’ ago.”",
        "“But the door was locked and the key was buried,” said Mary.\n\"No one could get in.”",
        "“That’s true,” he answered.  “It’s a queer place.\nSeems to me as if there’d been a bit o’ prunin’ done here an’\nthere, later than ten year’ ago.”",
        "“But how could it have been done?” said Mary.",
        "He was examining a branch of a standard rose and he shook\nhis head.",
        "“Aye! how could it!” he murmured.  “With th’\ndoor locked an’ th’ key buried.”",
        "Mistress Mary always felt that however many years\nshe lived she should never forget that first morning\nwhen her garden began to grow.  Of course, it did seem\nto begin to grow for her that morning.  When Dickon\nbegan to clear places to plant seeds, she remembered\nwhat Basil had sung at her when he wanted to tease her.",
        "“Are there any flowers that look like bells?” she inquired.",
        "“Lilies o’ th’ valley does,” he answered, digging away\nwith the trowel, “an’ there’s Canterbury bells, an’ campanulas.”",
        "“Let’s plant some,” said Mary.  “There’s lilies o’ th,\nvalley here already; I saw ’em. They’ll have growed too\nclose an’ we’ll have to separate ’em, but there’s plenty.\nTh’ other ones takes two years to bloom from seed, but I\ncan bring you some bits o’ plants from our cottage garden.\nWhy does tha’ want ’em?”",
        "Then Mary told him about Basil and his brothers\nand sisters in India and of how she had hated them\nand of their calling her “Mistress Mary Quite Contrary.”",
        "“They used to dance round and sing at me.  They sang–",
        "         `Mistress Mary, quite contrary,\n         How does your garden grow?\n         With silver bells, and cockle shells,\n         And marigolds all in a row.’",
        "I just remembered it and it made me wonder if there\nwere really flowers like silver bells.”",
        "She frowned a little and gave her trowel a rather spiteful\ndig into the earth.",
        "“I wasn’t as contrary as they were.”",
        "But Dickon laughed.",
        "“Eh!” he said, and as he crumbled the rich black soil she\nsaw he was sniffing up the scent of it.  “There doesn’t\nseem to be no need for no one to be contrary when there’s\nflowers an’ such like, an’ such lots o’ friendly wild\nthings runnin’ about makin’ homes for themselves, or buildin’\nnests an’ singin’ an’ whistlin’, does there?”",
        "Mary, kneeling by him holding the seeds, looked at him\nand stopped frowning.",
        "“Dickon,” she said, “you are as nice as Martha said\nyou were.  I like you, and you make the fifth person.\nI never thought I should like five people.”",
        "Dickon sat up on his heels as Martha did when she was\npolishing the grate.  He did look funny and delightful,\nMary thought, with his round blue eyes and red cheeks\nand happy looking turned-up nose.",
        "“Only five folk as tha’ likes?” he said.  “Who is th’\nother four?”",
        "“Your mother and Martha,” Mary checked them off\non her fingers, “and the robin and Ben Weatherstaff.”",
        "Dickon laughed so that he was obliged to stifle the sound\nby putting his arm over his mouth.",
        "“I know tha’ thinks I’m a queer lad,” he said, “but I\nthink tha’ art th’ queerest little lass I ever saw.”",
        "Then Mary did a strange thing.  She leaned forward\nand asked him a question she had never dreamed of asking\nany one before.  And she tried to ask it in Yorkshire\nbecause that was his language, and in India a native\nwas always pleased if you knew his speech.",
        "“Does tha’ like me?” she said.",
        "“Eh!” he answered heartily, “that I does.  I likes\nthee wonderful, an’ so does th’ robin, I do believe!”",
        "“That’s two, then,” said Mary.  “That’s two for me.”",
        "And then they began to work harder than ever and more joyfully.\nMary was startled and sorry when she heard the big clock\nin the courtyard strike the hour of her midday dinner.",
        "“I shall have to go,” she said mournfully.  “And you\nwill have to go too, won’t you?”",
        "Dickon grinned.",
        "“My dinner’s easy to carry about with me,” he said.\n\"Mother always lets me put a bit o’ somethin’ in my pocket.”",
        "He picked up his coat from the grass and brought out of\na pocket a lumpy little bundle tied up in a quite clean,\ncoarse, blue and white handkerchief.  It held two thick\npieces of bread with a slice of something laid between them.",
        "“It’s oftenest naught but bread,” he said, “but I’ve got\na fine slice o’ fat bacon with it today.”",
        "Mary thought it looked a queer dinner, but he seemed\nready to enjoy it.",
        "“Run on an’ get thy victuals,” he said.  “I’ll be done\nwith mine first.  I’ll get some more work done before I\nstart back home.”",
        "He sat down with his back against a tree.",
        "“I’ll call th’ robin up,” he said, “and give him th’\nrind o’ th’ bacon to peck at.  They likes a bit o’\nfat wonderful.”",
        "Mary could scarcely bear to leave him.  Suddenly it\nseemed as if he might be a sort of wood fairy who\nmight be gone when she came into the garden again.\nHe seemed too good to be true.  She went slowly half-way\nto the door in the wall and then she stopped and went back.",
        "“Whatever happens, you–you never would tell?” she said.",
        "His poppy-colored cheeks were distended with his first big\nbite of bread and bacon, but he managed to smile encouragingly.",
        "“If tha’ was a missel thrush an’ showed me where thy nest was,\ndoes tha’ think I’d tell any one? Not me,” he said.\n\"Tha’ art as safe as a missel thrush.”",
        "And she was quite sure she was.",
        "Mary ran so fast that she was rather out of breath when she\nreached her room.  Her hair was ruffled on her forehead\nand her cheeks were bright pink.  Her dinner was waiting\non the table, and Martha was waiting near it.",
        "“Tha’s a bit late,” she said.  “Where has tha’ been?”",
        "“I’ve seen Dickon!” said Mary.  “I’ve seen Dickon!”",
        "“I knew he’d come,” said Martha exultantly.  “How does tha’\nlike him?”",
        "“I think–I think he’s beautiful!” said Mary in a determined\nvoice.",
        "Martha looked rather taken aback but she looked pleased, too.",
        "“Well,” she said, “he’s th’ best lad as ever was born,\nbut us never thought he was handsome.  His nose turns up\ntoo much.”",
        "“I like it to turn up,” said Mary.",
        "“An’ his eyes is so round,” said Martha, a trifle doubtful.\n\"Though they’re a nice color.” “I like them round,\"\nsaid Mary.  “And they are exactly the color of the sky\nover the moor.”",
        "Martha beamed with satisfaction.",
        "“Mother says he made ’em that color with always lookin’\nup at th’ birds an’ th’ clouds.  But he has got a big mouth,\nhasn’t he, now?”",
        "“I love his big mouth,” said Mary obstinately.  “I wish\nmine were just like it.”",
        "Martha chuckled delightedly.",
        "“It’d look rare an’ funny in thy bit of a face,” she said.\n\"But I knowed it would be that way when tha’ saw him.\nHow did tha’ like th’ seeds an’ th’ garden tools?”",
        "“How did you know he brought them?” asked Mary.",
        "“Eh! I never thought of him not bringin’ ’em. He’d\nbe sure to bring ’em if they was in Yorkshire.\nHe’s such a trusty lad.”",
        "Mary was afraid that she might begin to ask\ndifficult questions, but she did not.  She was very\nmuch interested in the seeds and gardening tools,\nand there was only one moment when Mary was frightened.\nThis was when she began to ask where the flowers were to be\nplanted.",
        "“Who did tha’ ask about it?” she inquired.",
        "“I haven’t asked anybody yet,” said Mary, hesitating.\n\"Well, I wouldn’t ask th’ head gardener.  He’s too grand,\nMr. Roach is.”",
        "“I’ve never seen him,” said Mary.  “I’ve only seen\nundergardeners and Ben Weatherstaff.”",
        "“If I was you, I’d ask Ben Weatherstaff,” advised Martha.\n\"He’s not half as bad as he looks, for all he’s so crabbed.\nMr. Craven lets him do what he likes because he was here\nwhen Mrs. Craven was alive, an’ he used to make her laugh.\nShe liked him.  Perhaps he’d find you a corner somewhere out o’\nthe way.”",
        "“If it was out of the way and no one wanted it, no one\ncould mind my having it, could they?” Mary said anxiously.",
        "“There wouldn’t be no reason,” answered Martha.\n\"You wouldn’t do no harm.”",
        "Mary ate her dinner as quickly as she could and when she\nrose from the table she was going to run to her room\nto put on her hat again, but Martha stopped her.",
        "“I’ve got somethin’ to tell you,” she said.  “I thought\nI’d let you eat your dinner first.  Mr. Craven came back\nthis mornin’ and I think he wants to see you.”",
        "Mary turned quite pale.",
        "“Oh!” she said.  “Why! Why! He didn’t want to see me when I came.\nI heard Pitcher say he didn’t.” “Well,” explained Martha,\n\"Mrs. Medlock says it’s because o’ mother.  She was walkin’\nto Thwaite village an’ she met him.  She’d never spoke\nto him before, but Mrs. Craven had been to our cottage\ntwo or three times.  He’d forgot, but mother hadn’t an’\nshe made bold to stop him.  I don’t know what she said\nto him about you but she said somethin’ as put him in th’\nmind to see you before he goes away again, tomorrow.”",
        "“Oh!” cried Mary, “is he going away tomorrow? I am so glad!”",
        "“He’s goin’ for a long time.  He mayn’t come back till\nautumn or winter.  He’s goin’ to travel in foreign places.\nHe’s always doin’ it.”",
        "“Oh! I’m so glad–so glad!” said Mary thankfully.",
        "If he did not come back until winter, or even autumn,\nthere would be time to watch the secret garden come alive.\nEven if he found out then and took it away from her she\nwould have had that much at least.",
        "“When do you think he will want to see–”",
        "She did not finish the sentence, because the door opened,\nand Mrs. Medlock walked in.  She had on her best black\ndress and cap, and her collar was fastened with a\nlarge brooch with a picture of a man’s face on it.\nIt was a colored photograph of Mr. Medlock who had died\nyears ago, and she always wore it when she was dressed up.\nShe looked nervous and excited.",
        "“Your hair’s rough,” she said quickly.  “Go and\nbrush it.  Martha, help her to slip on her best dress.\nMr. Craven sent me to bring her to him in his study.”",
        "All the pink left Mary’s cheeks.  Her heart began to\nthump and she felt herself changing into a stiff, plain,\nsilent child again.  She did not even answer Mrs. Medlock,\nbut turned and walked into her bedroom, followed by Martha.\nShe said nothing while her dress was changed, and her\nhair brushed, and after she was quite tidy she followed\nMrs. Medlock down the corridors, in silence.  What was there\nfor her to say? She was obliged to go and see Mr. Craven\nand he would not like her, and she would not like him.\nShe knew what he would think of her.",
        "She was taken to a part of the house she had not been\ninto before.  At last Mrs. Medlock knocked at a door,\nand when some one said, “Come in,” they entered the\nroom together.  A man was sitting in an armchair before\nthe fire, and Mrs. Medlock spoke to him.",
        "“This is Miss Mary, sir,” she said.",
        "“You can go and leave her here.  I will ring for you\nwhen I want you to take her away,” said Mr. Craven.",
        "When she went out and closed the door, Mary could only\nstand waiting, a plain little thing, twisting her thin\nhands together.  She could see that the man in the\nchair was not so much a hunchback as a man with high,\nrather crooked shoulders, and he had black hair streaked\nwith white.  He turned his head over his high shoulders\nand spoke to her.",
        "“Come here!” he said.",
        "Mary went to him.",
        "He was not ugly.  His face would have been handsome if it\nhad not been so miserable.  He looked as if the sight\nof her worried and fretted him and as if he did not know\nwhat in the world to do with her.",
        "“Are you well?” he asked.",
        "“Yes,” answered Mary.",
        "“Do they take good care of you?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "He rubbed his forehead fretfully as he looked her over.",
        "“You are very thin,” he said.",
        "“I am getting fatter,” Mary answered in what she knew\nwas her stiffest way.",
        "What an unhappy face he had! His black eyes seemed as if they\nscarcely saw her, as if they were seeing something else,\nand he could hardly keep his thoughts upon her.",
        "“I forgot you,” he said.  “How could I remember you? I\nintended to send you a governess or a nurse, or some\none of that sort, but I forgot.”",
        "“Please,” began Mary.  “Please–” and then the lump\nin her throat choked her.",
        "“What do you want to say?” he inquired.",
        "“I am–I am too big for a nurse,” said Mary.\n\"And please–please don’t make me have a governess yet.”",
        "He rubbed his forehead again and stared at her.",
        "“That was what the Sowerby woman said,” he muttered\nabsentmindedly.",
        "Then Mary gathered a scrap of courage.",
        "“Is she–is she Martha’s mother?” she stammered.",
        "“Yes, I think so,” he replied.",
        "“She knows about children,” said Mary.  “She has twelve.\nShe knows.”",
        "He seemed to rouse himself.",
        "“What do you want to do?”",
        "“I want to play out of doors,” Mary answered, hoping that\nher voice did not tremble.  “I never liked it in India.\nIt makes me hungry here, and I am getting fatter.”",
        "He was watching her.",
        "“Mrs. Sowerby said it would do you good.  Perhaps it will,\"\nhe said.  “She thought you had better get stronger before\nyou had a governess.”",
        "“It makes me feel strong when I play and the wind comes\nover the moor,” argued Mary.",
        "“Where do you play?” he asked next.",
        "“Everywhere,” gasped Mary.  “Martha’s mother sent me\na skipping-rope. I skip and run–and I look about to see\nif things are beginning to stick up out of the earth.\nI don’t do any harm.”",
        "“Don’t look so frightened,” he said in a worried voice.\n\"You could not do any harm, a child like you! You may do\nwhat you like.”",
        "Mary put her hand up to her throat because she was afraid\nhe might see the excited lump which she felt jump into it.\nShe came a step nearer to him.",
        "“May I?” she said tremulously.",
        "Her anxious little face seemed to worry him more than ever.",
        "“Don’t look so frightened,” he exclaimed.  “Of course you may.\nI am your guardian, though I am a poor one for any child.\nI cannot give you time or attention.  I am too ill,\nand wretched and distracted; but I wish you to be happy\nand comfortable.  I don’t know anything about children,\nbut Mrs. Medlock is to see that you have all you need.\nI sent for you to-day because Mrs. Sowerby said I\nought to see you.  Her daughter had talked about you.\nShe thought you needed fresh air and freedom and running\nabout.”",
        "“She knows all about children,” Mary said again in spite\nof herself.",
        "“She ought to,” said Mr. Craven.  “I thought her rather\nbold to stop me on the moor, but she said–Mrs. Craven\nhad been kind to her.” It seemed hard for him to speak\nhis dead wife’s name.  “She is a respectable woman.\nNow I have seen you I think she said sensible things.\nPlay out of doors as much as you like.  It’s a big place\nand you may go where you like and amuse yourself as you like.\nIs there anything you want?” as if a sudden thought had\nstruck him.  “Do you want toys, books, dolls?”",
        "“Might I,” quavered Mary, “might I have a bit of earth?”",
        "In her eagerness she did not realize how queer the words\nwould sound and that they were not the ones she had meant\nto say.  Mr. Craven looked quite startled.",
        "“Earth!” he repeated.  “What do you mean?”",
        "“To plant seeds in–to make things grow–to see them\ncome alive,” Mary faltered.",
        "He gazed at her a moment and then passed his hand quickly\nover his eyes.",
        "“Do you–care about gardens so much,” he said slowly.",
        "“I didn’t know about them in India,” said Mary.  “I was\nalways ill and tired and it was too hot.  I sometimes\nmade littlebeds in the sand and stuck flowers in them.\nBut here it is different.”",
        "Mr. Craven got up and began to walk slowly across the room.",
        "“A bit of earth,” he said to himself, and Mary thought\nthat somehow she must have reminded him of something.\nWhen he stopped and spoke to her his dark eyes looked almost\nsoft and kind.",
        "“You can have as much earth as you want,” he said.\n\"You remind me of some one else who loved the earth and\nthings that grow.  When you see a bit of earth you want,\"\nwith something like a smile, “take it, child, and make it\ncome alive.”",
        "“May I take it from anywhere–if it’s not wanted?”",
        "“Anywhere,” he answered.  “There! You must go now,\nI am tired.” He touched the bell to call Mrs. Medlock.\n\"Good-by. I shall be away all summer.”",
        "Mrs. Medlock came so quickly that Mary thought she must\nhave been waiting in the corridor.",
        "“Mrs. Medlock,” Mr. Craven said to her, “now I have\nseen the child I understand what Mrs. Sowerby meant.\nShe must be less delicate before she begins lessons.\nGive her simple, healthy food.  Let her run wild in\nthe garden.  Don’t look after her too much.  She needs\nliberty and fresh air and romping about.  Mrs. Sowerby\nis to come and see her now and then and she may sometimes\ngo to the cottage.”",
        "Mrs. Medlock looked pleased.  She was relieved to\nhear that she need not “look after” Mary too much.\nShe had felt her a tiresome charge and had indeed seen\nas little of her as she dared.  In addition to this\nshe was fond of Martha’s mother.",
        "“Thank you, sir,” she said.  “Susan Sowerby and me went to\nschool together and she’s as sensible and good-hearted a woman\nas you’d find in a day’s walk.  I never had any children\nmyself and she’s had twelve, and there never was healthier\nor better ones.  Miss Mary can get no harm from them.\nI’d always take Susan Sowerby’s advice about children myself.\nShe’s what you might call healthy-minded–if you understand me.”",
        "“I understand,” Mr. Craven answered.  “Take Miss Mary\naway now and send Pitcher to me.”",
        "When Mrs. Medlock left her at the end of her own corridor\nMary flew back to her room.  She found Martha waiting there.\nMartha had, in fact, hurried back after she had removed\nthe dinner service.",
        "“I can have my garden!” cried Mary.  “I may have it\nwhere I like! I am not going to have a governess\nfor a long time! Your mother is coming to see me\nand I may go to your cottage! He says a little girl\nlike me could not do any harm and I may do what I\nlike–anywhere!”",
        "“Eh!” said Martha delightedly, “that was nice of him\nwasn’t it?”",
        "“Martha,” said Mary solemnly, “he is really a nice man,\nonly his face is so miserable and his forehead is all\ndrawn together.”",
        "She ran as quickly as she could to the garden.  She had\nbeen away so much longer than she had thought she should\nand she knew Dickon would have to set out early on his\nfive-mile walk.  When she slipped through the door under\nthe ivy, she saw he was not working where she had left him.\nThe gardening tools were laid together under a tree.\nShe ran to them, looking all round the place, but there\nwas no Dickon to be seen.  He had gone away and the secret\ngarden was empty–except for the robin who had just flown\nacross the wall and sat on a standard rose-bush watching her.\n\"He’s gone,” she said woefully.  “Oh! was he–was he–was\nhe only a wood fairy?”",
        "Something white fastened to the standard rose-bush caught\nher eye.  It was a piece of paper, in fact, it was a\npiece of the letter she had printed for Martha to send\nto Dickon.  It was fastened on the bush with a long thorn,\nand in a minute she knew Dickon had left it there.\nThere were some roughly printed letters on it and a sort\nof picture.  At first she could not tell what it was.\nThen she saw it was meant for a nest with a bird sitting\non it.  Underneath were the printed letters and they\nsaid:",
        "“I will cum bak.”",
        "Mary took the picture back to the house when she went\nto her supper and she showed it to Martha.",
        "“Eh!” said Martha with great pride.  “I never knew our\nDickon was as clever as that.  That there’s a picture\nof a missel thrush on her nest, as large as life an’\ntwice as natural.”",
        "Then Mary knew Dickon had meant the picture to be a message.\nHe had meant that she might be sure he would keep her secret.\nHer garden was her nest and she was like a missel thrush.\nOh, how she did like that queer, common boy!",
        "She hoped he would come back the very next day and she\nfell asleep looking forward to the morning.",
        "But you never know what the weather will do in Yorkshire,\nparticularly in the springtime.  She was awakened in\nthe night by the sound of rain beating with heavy drops\nagainst her window.  It was pouring down in torrents\nand the wind was “wuthering” round the corners and in\nthe chimneys of the huge old house.  Mary sat up in bed\nand felt miserable and angry.",
        "“The rain is as contrary as I ever was,” she said.\n\"It came because it knew I did not want it.”",
        "She threw herself back on her pillow and buried her face.\nShe did not cry, but she lay and hated the sound of the\nheavily beating rain, she hated the wind and its “wuthering.\"\nShe could not go to sleep again.  The mournful sound kept\nher awake because she felt mournful herself.  If she had\nfelt happy it would probably have lulled her to sleep.\nHow it “wuthered” and how the big raindrops poured down\nand beat against the pane!",
        "“It sounds just like a person lost on the moor\nand wandering on and on crying,” she said.",
        "She had been lying awake turning from side to side\nfor about an hour, when suddenly something made her sit\nup in bed and turn her head toward the door listening.\nShe listened and she listened.",
        "“It isn’t the wind now,” she said in a loud whisper.\n\"That isn’t the wind.  It is different.  It is that crying I\nheard before.”",
        "The door of her room was ajar and the sound came down\nthe corridor, a far-off faint sound of fretful crying.\nShe listened for a few minutes and each minute she became\nmore and more sure.  She felt as if she must find out\nwhat it was.  It seemed even stranger than the secret\ngarden and the buried key.  Perhaps the fact that she\nwas in a rebellious mood made her bold.  She put her foot\nout of bed and stood on the floor.",
        "“I am going to find out what it is,” she said.  “Everybody is\nin bed and I don’t care about Mrs. Medlock–I don’t care!”",
        "There was a candle by her bedside and she took it up\nand went softly out of the room.  The corridor looked\nvery long and dark, but she was too excited to mind that.\nShe thought she remembered the corners she must turn\nto find the short corridor with the door covered with\ntapestry–the one Mrs. Medlock had come through the day\nshe lost herself.  The sound had come up that passage.\nSo she went on with her dim light, almost feeling her way,\nher heart beating so loud that she fancied she could\nhear it.  The far-off faint crying went on and led her.\nSometimes it stopped for a moment or so and then began again.\nWas this the right corner to turn? She stopped and thought.\nYes it was.  Down this passage and then to the left,\nand then up two broad steps, and then to the right again.\nYes, there was the tapestry door.",
        "She pushed it open very gently and closed it behind her,\nand she stood in the corridor and could hear the crying\nquite plainly, though it was not loud.  It was on the other\nside of the wall at her left and a few yards farther on\nthere was a door.  She could see a glimmer of light coming\nfrom beneath it.  The Someone was crying in that room,\nand it was quite a young Someone.",
        "So she walked to the door and pushed it open, and there\nshe was standing in the room!",
        "It was a big room with ancient, handsome furniture in it.\nThere was a low fire glowing faintly on the hearth and a\nnight light burning by the side of a carved four-posted\nbed hung with brocade, and on the bed was lying a boy,\ncrying fretfully.",
        "Mary wondered if she was in a real place or if she had\nfallen asleep again and was dreaming without knowing it.",
        "The boy had a sharp, delicate face the color of ivory\nand he seemed to have eyes too big for it.  He had\nalso a lot of hair which tumbled over his forehead\nin heavy locks and made his thin face seem smaller.\nHe looked like a boy who had been ill, but he was crying\nmore as if he were tired and cross than as if he were in pain.",
        "Mary stood near the door with her candle in her hand,\nholding her breath.  Then she crept across the room, and,\nas she drew nearer, the light attracted the boy’s attention\nand he turned his head on his pillow and stared at her,\nhis gray eyes opening so wide that they seemed immense.",
        "“Who are you?” he said at last in a half-frightened whisper.\n\"Are you a ghost?”",
        "“No, I am not,” Mary answered, her own whisper sounding\nhalf frightened.  “Are you one?”",
        "He stared and stared and stared.  Mary could not help\nnoticing what strange eyes he had.  They were agate\ngray and they looked too big for his face because they\nhad black lashes all round them.",
        "“No,” he replied after waiting a moment or so.\n\"I am Colin.”",
        "“Who is Colin?” she faltered.",
        "“I am Colin Craven.  Who are you?”",
        "“I am Mary Lennox.  Mr. Craven is my uncle.”",
        "“He is my father,” said the boy.",
        "“Your father!” gasped Mary.  “No one ever told me he\nhad a boy! Why didn’t they?”",
        "“Come here,” he said, still keeping his strange eyes\nfixed on her with an anxious expression.",
        "She came close to the bed and he put out his hand\nand touched her.",
        "“You are real, aren’t you?” he said.  “I have such real\ndreams very often.  You might be one of them.”",
        "Mary had slipped on a woolen wrapper before she left\nher room and she put a piece of it between his fingers.",
        "“Rub that and see how thick and warm it is,” she said.\n\"I will pinch you a little if you like, to show you how real\nI am.  For a minute I thought you might be a dream too.”",
        "“Where did you come from?” he asked.",
        "“From my own room.  The wind wuthered so I couldn’t go\nto sleep and I heard some one crying and wanted to find\nout who it was.  What were you crying for?”",
        "“Because I couldn’t go to sleep either and my head ached.\nTell me your name again.”",
        "“Mary Lennox.  Did no one ever tell you I had come\nto live here?”",
        "He was still fingering the fold of her wrapper, but he\nbegan to look a little more as if he believed in her reality.",
        "“No,” he answered.  “They daren’t.”",
        "“Why?” asked Mary.",
        "“Because I should have been afraid you would see me.\nI won’t let people see me and talk me over.”",
        "“Why?” Mary asked again, feeling more mystified every moment.",
        "“Because I am like this always, ill and having to lie down.\nMy father won’t let people talk me over either.\nThe servants are not allowed to speak about me.\nIf I live I may be a hunchback, but I shan’t live.\nMy father hates to think I may be like him.”",
        "“Oh, what a queer house this is!” Mary said.\n\"What a queer house! Everything is a kind of secret.\nRooms are locked up and gardens are locked up–and you!\nHave you been locked up?”",
        "“No. I stay in this room because I don’t want to be moved\nout of it.  It tires me too much.”",
        "“Does your father come and see you?” Mary ventured.",
        "“Sometimes. Generally when I am asleep.  He doesn’t want\nto see me.”",
        "“Why?” Mary could not help asking again.",
        "A sort of angry shadow passed over the boy’s face.",
        "“My mother died when I was born and it makes him wretched\nto look at me.  He thinks I don’t know, but I’ve heard\npeople talking.  He almost hates me.”",
        "“He hates the garden, because she died,” said Mary half\nspeaking to herself.",
        "“What garden?” the boy asked.",
        "“Oh! just–just a garden she used to like,” Mary stammered.\n\"Have you been here always?” “Nearly always.  Sometimes I\nhave been taken to places at the seaside, but I won’t\nstay because people stare at me.  I used to wear an iron\nthing to keep my back straight, but a grand doctor came\nfrom London to see me and said it was stupid.  He told\nthem to take it off and keep me out in the fresh air.\nI hate fresh air and I don’t want to go out.”",
        "“I didn’t when first I came here,” said Mary.  “Why do\nyou keep looking at me like that?”",
        "“Because of the dreams that are so real,” he answered\nrather fretfully.  “Sometimes when I open my eyes I don’t\nbelieve I’m awake.”",
        "“We’re both awake,” said Mary.  She glanced round the room\nwith its high ceiling and shadowy corners and dim fire-light.\n\"It looks quite like a dream, and it’s the middle of the night,\nand everybody in the house is asleep–everybody but us.\nWe are wide awake.”",
        "“I don’t want it to be a dream,” the boy said restlessly.",
        "Mary thought of something all at once.",
        "“If you don’t like people to see you,” she began,\n\"do you want me to go away?”",
        "He still held the fold of her wrapper and he gave it\na little pull.",
        "“No,” he said.  “I should be sure you were a dream if you went.\nIf you are real, sit down on that big footstool and talk.\nI want to hear about you.”",
        "Mary put down her candle on the table near the bed\nand sat down on the cushioned stool.  She did not want\nto go away at all.  She wanted to stay in the mysterious\nhidden-away room and talk to the mysterious boy.",
        "“What do you want me to tell you?” she said.",
        "He wanted to know how long she had been at Misselthwaite;\nhe wanted to know which corridor her room was on; he wanted\nto know what she had been doing; if she disliked the moor\nas he disliked it; where she had lived before she came\nto Yorkshire.  She answered all these questions and many\nmore and he lay back on his pillow and listened.  He made\nher tell him a great deal about India and about her voyage\nacross the ocean.  She found out that because he had been\nan invalid he had not learned things as other children had.\nOne of his nurses had taught him to read when he was quite\nlittle and he was always reading and looking at pictures\nin splendid books.",
        "Though his father rarely saw him when he was awake, he was\ngiven all sorts of wonderful things to amuse himself with.\nHe never seemed to have been amused, however.  He could have\nanything he asked for and was never made to do anything he did\nnot like to do.  “Everyone is obliged to do what pleases me,\"\nhe said indifferently.  “It makes me ill to be angry.\nNo one believes I shall live to grow up.”",
        "He said it as if he was so accustomed to the idea that it\nhad ceased to matter to him at all.  He seemed to like\nthe sound of Mary’s voice.  As she went on talking he\nlistened in a drowsy, interested way.  Once or twice she\nwondered if he were not gradually falling into a doze.\nBut at last he asked a question which opened up a new subject.",
        "“How old are you?” he asked.",
        "“I am ten,” answered Mary, forgetting herself for the moment,\n\"and so are you.”",
        "“How do you know that?” he demanded in a surprised voice.",
        "“Because when you were born the garden door was locked\nand the key was buried.  And it has been locked for ten years.”",
        "Colin half sat up, turning toward her, leaning on his elbows.",
        "“What garden door was locked? Who did it? Where was\nthe key buried?” he exclaimed as if he were suddenly\nvery much interested.",
        "“It–it was the garden Mr. Craven hates,” said Mary nervously.\n\"He locked the door.  No one–no one knew where he buried\nthe key.” “What sort of a garden is it?” Colin persisted eagerly.",
        "“No one has been allowed to go into it for ten years,\"\nwas Mary’s careful answer.",
        "But it was too late to be careful.  He was too much\nlike herself.  He too had had nothing to think about\nand the idea of a hidden garden attracted him as it\nhad attracted her.  He asked question after question.\nWhere was it? Had she never looked for the door? Had she\nnever asked the gardeners?",
        "“They won’t talk about it,” said Mary.  “I think they\nhave been told not to answer questions.”",
        "“I would make them,” said Colin.",
        "“Could you?” Mary faltered, beginning to feel frightened.\nIf he could make people answer questions, who knew what\nmight happen!",
        "“Everyone is obliged to please me.  I told you that,\"\nhe said.  “If I were to live, this place would sometime\nbelong to me.  They all know that.  I would make them\ntell me.”",
        "Mary had not known that she herself had been spoiled,\nbut she could see quite plainly that this mysterious boy\nhad been.  He thought that the whole world belonged to him.\nHow peculiar he was and how coolly he spoke of not living.",
        "“Do you think you won’t live?” she asked, partly because\nshe was curious and partly in hope of making him forget\nthe garden.",
        "“I don’t suppose I shall,” he answered as indifferently\nas he had spoken before.  “Ever since I remember anything\nI have heard people say I shan’t. At first they thought\nI was too little to understand and now they think I\ndon’t hear.  But I do.  My doctor is my father’s cousin.\nHe is quite poor and if I die he will have all Misselthwaite\nwhen my father is dead.  I should think he wouldn’t want\nme to live.”",
        "“Do you want to live?” inquired Mary.",
        "“No,” he answered, in a cross, tired fashion.  “But I\ndon’t want to die.  When I feel ill I lie here and think\nabout it until I cry and cry.”",
        "“I have heard you crying three times,” Mary said, “but I\ndid not know who it was.  Were you crying about that?\"\nShe did so want him to forget the garden.",
        "“I dare say,” he answered.  “Let us talk about something else.\nTalk about that garden.  Don’t you want to see it?”",
        "“Yes,” answered Mary, in quite a low voice.",
        "“I do,” he went on persistently.  “I don’t think I ever really\nwanted to see anything before, but I want to see that garden.\nI want the key dug up.  I want the door unlocked.\nI would let them take me there in my chair.  That would\nbe getting fresh air.  I am going to make them open the door.”",
        "He had become quite excited and his strange eyes began\nto shine like stars and looked more immense than ever.",
        "“They have to please me,” he said.  “I will make them\ntake me there and I will let you go, too.”",
        "Mary’s hands clutched each other.  Everything would\nbe spoiled–everything! Dickon would never come back.\nShe would never again feel like a missel thrush with a\nsafe-hidden nest.",
        "“Oh, don’t–don’t–don’t–don’t do that!” she cried out.",
        "He stared as if he thought she had gone crazy!",
        "“Why?” he exclaimed.  “You said you wanted to see it.”",
        "“I do,” she answered almost with a sob in her throat,\n\"but if you make them open the door and take you in like\nthat it will never be a secret again.”",
        "He leaned still farther forward.",
        "“A secret,” he said.  “What do you mean? Tell me.”",
        "Mary’s words almost tumbled over one another.",
        "“You see–you see,” she panted, “if no one knows but\nourselves–if there was a door, hidden somewhere under\nthe ivy–if there was–and we could find it; and if we\ncould slip through it together and shut it behind us,\nand no one knew any one was inside and we called it our\ngarden and pretended that–that we were missel thrushes\nand it was our nest, and if we played there almost every\nday and dug and planted seeds and made it all come alive–”",
        "“Is it dead?” he interrupted her.",
        "“It soon will be if no one cares for it,” she went on.\n\"The bulbs will live but the roses–”",
        "He stopped her again as excited as she was herself.",
        "“What are bulbs?” he put in quickly.",
        "“They are daffodils and lilies and snowdrops.  They are\nworking in the earth now–pushing up pale green points\nbecause the spring is coming.”",
        "“Is the spring coming?” he said.  “What is it like? You\ndon’t see it in rooms if you are ill.”",
        "“It is the sun shining on the rain and the rain falling\non the sunshine, and things pushing up and working under\nthe earth,” said Mary.  “If the garden was a secret and we\ncould get into it we could watch the things grow bigger\nevery day, and see how many roses are alive.  Don’t you.\nsee? Oh, don’t you see how much nicer it would be if it\nwas a secret?”",
        "He dropped back on his pillow and lay there with an odd\nexpression on his face.",
        "“I never had a secret,” he said, “except that one about\nnot living to grow up.  They don’t know I know that,\nso it is a sort of secret.  But I like this kind better.”",
        "“If you won’t make them take you to the garden,” pleaded Mary,\n\"perhaps–I feel almost sure I can find out how to get\nin sometime.  And then–if the doctor wants you to go out\nin your chair, and if you can always do what you want to do,\nperhaps–perhaps we might find some boy who would push you,\nand we could go alone and it would always be a secret garden.”",
        "“I should–like–that,” he said very slowly, his eyes\nlooking dreamy.  “I should like that.  I should not mind\nfresh air in a secret garden.”",
        "Mary began to recover her breath and feel safer because\nthe idea of keeping the secret seemed to please him.\nShe felt almost sure that if she kept on talking and could\nmake him see the garden in his mind as she had seen it\nhe would like it so much that he could not bear to think\nthat everybody might tramp in to it when they chose.",
        "“I’ll tell you what I think it would be like, if we could\ngo into it,” she said.  “It has been shut up so long\nthings have grown into a tangle perhaps.”",
        "He lay quite still and listened while she went on talking\nabout the roses which might have clambered from tree\nto tree and hung down–about the many birds which might\nhave built their nests there because it was so safe.\nAnd then she told him about the robin and Ben Weatherstaff,\nand there was so much to tell about the robin and it\nwas so easy and safe to talk about it that she ceased\nto be afraid.  The robin pleased him so much that he\nsmiled until he looked almost beautiful, and at first\nMary had thought that he was even plainer than herself,\nwith his big eyes and heavy locks of hair.",
        "“I did not know birds could be like that,” he said.\n\"But if you stay in a room you never see things.\nWhat a lot of things you know.  I feel as if you had been\ninside that garden.”",
        "She did not know what to say, so she did not say anything.\nHe evidently did not expect an answer and the next moment\nhe gave her a surprise.",
        "“I am going to let you look at something,” he said.\n\"Do you see that rose-colored silk curtain hanging on the\nwall over the mantel-piece?”",
        "Mary had not noticed it before, but she looked up and saw it.\nIt was a curtain of soft silk hanging over what seemed\nto be some picture.",
        "“Yes,” she answered.",
        "“There is a cord hanging from it,” said Colin.\n\"Go and pull it.”",
        "Mary got up, much mystified, and found the cord.\nWhen she pulled it the silk curtain ran back on\nrings and when it ran back it uncovered a picture.\nIt was the picture of a girl with a laughing face.\nShe had bright hair tied up with a blue ribbon and her gay,\nlovely eyes were exactly like Colin’s unhappy ones,\nagate gray and looking twice as big as they really were\nbecause of the black lashes all round them.",
        "“She is my mother,” said Colin complainingly.  “I don’t\nsee why she died.  Sometimes I hate her for doing it.”",
        "“How queer!” said Mary.",
        "“If she had lived I believe I should not have been ill always,\"\nhe grumbled.  “I dare say I should have lived, too.\nAnd my father would not have hated to look at me.  I dare\nsay I should have had a strong back.  Draw the curtain again.”",
        "Mary did as she was told and returned to her footstool.",
        "“She is much prettier than you,” she said, “but her eyes\nare just like yours–at least they are the same shape\nand color.  Why is the curtain drawn over her?”",
        "He moved uncomfortably.",
        "“I made them do it,” he said.  “Sometimes I don’t like to\nsee her looking at me.  She smiles too much when I am ill\nand miserable.  Besides, she is mine and I don’t want everyone\nto see her.” There were a few moments of silence and then Mary\nspoke.",
        "“What would Mrs. Medlock do if she found out that I\nhad been here?” she inquired.",
        "“She would do as I told her to do,” he answered.\n\"And I should tell her that I wanted you to come here\nand talk to me every day.  I am glad you came.”",
        "“So am I,” said Mary.  “I will come as often as I can,\nbut\"–she hesitated–\"I shall have to look every day\nfor the garden door.”",
        "“Yes, you must,” said Colin, “and you can tell me about\nit afterward.”",
        "He lay thinking a few minutes, as he had done before,\nand then he spoke again.",
        "“I think you shall be a secret, too,” he said.  “I will not\ntell them until they find out.  I can always send the nurse\nout of the room and say that I want to be by myself.\nDo you know Martha?”",
        "“Yes, I know her very well,” said Mary.  “She waits on me.”",
        "He nodded his head toward the outer corridor.",
        "“She is the one who is asleep in the other room.\nThe nurse went away yesterday to stay all night with her\nsister and she always makes Martha attend to me when she\nwants to go out.  Martha shall tell you when to come here.”",
        "Then Mary understood Martha’s troubled look when she\nhad asked questions about the crying.",
        "“Martha knew about you all the time?” she said.",
        "“Yes; she often attends to me.  The nurse likes to get\naway from me and then Martha comes.”",
        "“I have been here a long time,” said Mary.  “Shall I go\naway now? Your eyes look sleepy.”",
        "“I wish I could go to sleep before you leave me,\"\nhe said rather shyly.",
        "“Shut your eyes,” said Mary, drawing her footstool closer,\n\"and I will do what my Ayah used to do in India.\nI will pat your hand and stroke it and sing something\nquite low.”",
        "“I should like that perhaps,” he said drowsily.",
        "Somehow she was sorry for him and did not want him\nto lie awake, so she leaned against the bed and began\nto stroke and pat his hand and sing a very low little\nchanting song in Hindustani.",
        "“That is nice,” he said more drowsily still, and she went\non chanting and stroking, but when she looked at him again\nhis black lashes were lying close against his cheeks,\nfor his eyes were shut and he was fast asleep.  So she\ngot up softly, took her candle and crept away without\nmaking a sound.",
        "The moor was hidden in mist when the morning came,\nand the rain had not stopped pouring down.  There could\nbe no going out of doors.  Martha was so busy that Mary\nhad no opportunity of talking to her, but in the afternoon\nshe asked her to come and sit with her in the nursery.\nShe came bringing the stocking she was always knitting\nwhen she was doing nothing else.",
        "“What’s the matter with thee?” she asked as soon as they\nsat down.  “Tha’ looks as if tha’d somethin’ to say.”",
        "“I have.  I have found out what the crying was,\"\nsaid Mary.",
        "Martha let her knitting drop on her knee and gazed\nat her with startled eyes.",
        "“Tha’ hasn’t!” she exclaimed.  “Never!”",
        "“I heard it in the night,” Mary went on.  “And I got\nup and went to see where it came from.  It was Colin.\nI found him.”",
        "Martha’s face became red with fright.",
        "“Eh! Miss Mary!” she said half crying.  “Tha’ shouldn’t\nhave done it–tha’ shouldn’t! Tha’ll get me in trouble.\nI never told thee nothin’ about him–but tha’ll get me\nin trouble.  I shall lose my place and what’ll mother do!”",
        "“You won’t lose your place,” said Mary.  “He was glad I came.\nWe talked and talked and he said he was glad I came.”",
        "“Was he?” cried Martha.  “Art tha’ sure? Tha’\ndoesn’t know what he’s like when anything vexes him.\nHe’s a big lad to cry like a baby, but when he’s\nin a passion he’ll fair scream just to frighten us.\nHe knows us daren’t call our souls our own.”",
        "“He wasn’t vexed,” said Mary.  “I asked him if I should go\naway and he made me stay.  He asked me questions and I\nsat on a big footstool and talked to him about India\nand about the robin and gardens.  He wouldn’t let me go.\nHe let me see his mother’s picture.  Before I left him I\nsang him to sleep.”",
        "Martha fairly gasped with amazement.",
        "“I can scarcely believe thee!” she protested.\n\"It’s as if tha’d walked straight into a lion’s den.\nIf he’d been like he is most times he’d have throwed himself\ninto one of his tantrums and roused th’ house.  He won’t\nlet strangers look at him.”",
        "“He let me look at him.  I looked at him all the time\nand he looked at me.  We stared!” said Mary.",
        "“I don’t know what to do!” cried agitated Martha.\n\"If Mrs. Medlock finds out, she’ll think I broke orders\nand told thee and I shall be packed back to mother.”",
        "“He is not going to tell Mrs. Medlock anything about it yet.\nIt’s to be a sort of secret just at first,” said Mary firmly.\n\"And he says everybody is obliged to do as he pleases.”",
        "“Aye, that’s true enough–th’ bad lad!” sighed Martha,\nwiping her forehead with her apron.",
        "“He says Mrs. Medlock must.  And he wants me to come and talk\nto him every day.  And you are to tell me when he wants me.”",
        "“Me!” said Martha; “I shall lose my place–I shall for sure!”",
        "“You can’t if you are doing what he wants you to do\nand everybody is ordered to obey him,” Mary argued.",
        "“Does tha’ mean to say,” cried Martha with wide open eyes,\n\"that he was nice to thee!”",
        "“I think he almost liked me,” Mary answered.",
        "“Then tha’ must have bewitched him!” decided Martha,\ndrawing a long breath.",
        "“Do you mean Magic?” inquired Mary.  “I’ve heard about Magic\nin India, but I can’t make it.  I just went into his room\nand I was so surprised to see him I stood and stared.\nAnd then he turned round and stared at me.  And he thought\nI was a ghost or a dream and I thought perhaps he was.\nAnd it was so queer being there alone together in the\nmiddle of the night and not knowing about each other.\nAnd we began to ask each other questions.  And when I asked\nhim if I must go away he said I must not.”",
        "“Th’ world’s comin’ to a end!” gasped Martha.",
        "“What is the matter with him?” asked Mary.",
        "“Nobody knows for sure and certain,” said Martha.\n\"Mr. Craven went off his head like when he was born.\nTh’ doctors thought he’d have to be put in a ’sylum.\nIt was because Mrs. Craven died like I told you.\nHe wouldn’t set eyes on th’ baby.  He just raved and said\nit’d be another hunchback like him and it’d better die.”",
        "“Is Colin a hunchback?” Mary asked.  “He didn’t look\nlike one.”",
        "“He isn’t yet,” said Martha.  “But he began all wrong.\nMother said that there was enough trouble and raging in th’\nhouse to set any child wrong.  They was afraid his back\nwas weak an’ they’ve always been takin’ care of it–keepin’\nhim lyin’ down and not lettin’ him walk.  Once they made\nhim wear a brace but he fretted so he was downright ill.\nThen a big doctor came to see him an’ made them take it off.\nHe talked to th’ other doctor quite rough–in a polite way.\nHe said there’d been too much medicine and too much lettin’\nhim have his own way.”",
        "“I think he’s a very spoiled boy,” said Mary.",
        "“He’s th’ worst young nowt as ever was!” said Martha.\n\"I won’t say as he hasn’t been ill a good bit.\nHe’s had coughs an’ colds that’s nearly killed him two\nor three times.  Once he had rheumatic fever an’ once he\nhad typhoid.  Eh! Mrs. Medlock did get a fright then.\nHe’d been out of his head an’ she was talkin’ to th’\nnurse, thinkin’ he didn’t know nothin’, an’ she said,\n`He’ll die this time sure enough, an’ best thing for him an’\nfor everybody.’ An’ she looked at him an’ there he\nwas with his big eyes open, starin’ at her as sensible\nas she was herself.  She didn’t know wha’d happen but he\njust stared at her an’ says, `You give me some water an’\nstop talkin’.’”",
        "“Do you think he will die?” asked Mary.",
        "“Mother says there’s no reason why any child should live\nthat gets no fresh air an’ doesn’t do nothin’ but lie\non his back an’ read picture-books an’ take medicine.\nHe’s weak and hates th’ trouble o’ bein’ taken out o’\ndoors, an’ he gets cold so easy he says it makes him ill.”",
        "Mary sat and looked at the fire.  “I wonder,” she said slowly,\n\"if it would not do him good to go out into a garden\nand watch things growing.  It did me good.”",
        "“One of th’ worst fits he ever had,” said Martha, “was one\ntime they took him out where the roses is by the fountain.\nHe’d been readin’ in a paper about people gettin’\nsomethin’ he called `rose cold’ an’ he began to sneeze an’\nsaid he’d got it an’ then a new gardener as didn’t\nknow th’ rules passed by an’ looked at him curious.\nHe threw himself into a passion an’ he said he’d\nlooked at him because he was going to be a hunchback.\nHe cried himself into a fever an’ was ill all night.”",
        "“If he ever gets angry at me, I’ll never go and see\nhim again,” said Mary.",
        "“He’ll have thee if he wants thee,” said Martha.\n\"Tha’ may as well know that at th’ start.”",
        "Very soon afterward a bell rang and she rolled up\nher knitting.",
        "“I dare say th’ nurse wants me to stay with him a bit,\"\nshe said.  “I hope he’s in a good temper.”",
        "She was out of the room about ten minutes and then she\ncame back with a puzzled expression.",
        "“Well, tha’ has bewitched him,” she said.  “He’s up on his\nsofa with his picture-books. He’s told the nurse to stay\naway until six o’clock. I’m to wait in the next room.\nTh’ minute she was gone he called me to him an’ says, `I want\nMary Lennox to come and talk to me, and remember you’re\nnot to tell any one.’ You’d better go as quick as you can.”",
        "Mary was quite willing to go quickly.  She did not want\nto see Colin as much as she wanted to see Dickon;\nbut she wanted to see him very much.",
        "There was a bright fire on the hearth when she entered\nhis room, and in the daylight she saw it was a very\nbeautiful room indeed.  There were rich colors in the\nrugs and hangings and pictures and books on the walls\nwhich made it look glowing and comfortable even in spite\nof the gray sky and falling rain.  Colin looked rather\nlike a picture himself.  He was wrapped in a velvet\ndressing-gown and sat against a big brocaded cushion.\nHe had a red spot on each cheek.",
        "“Come in,” he said.  “I’ve been thinking about you\nall morning.”",
        "“I’ve been thinking about you, too,” answered Mary.\n\"You don’t know how frightened Martha is.  She says\nMrs. Medlock will think she told me about you and then she\nwill be sent away.”",
        "He frowned.",
        "“Go and tell her to come here,” he said.  “She is\nin the next room.”",
        "Mary went and brought her back.  Poor Martha was shaking\nin her shoes.  Colin was still frowning.",
        "“Have you to do what I please or have you not?” he demanded.",
        "“I have to do what you please, sir,” Martha faltered,\nturning quite red.",
        "“Has Medlock to do what I please?”",
        "“Everybody has, sir,” said Martha.",
        "“Well, then, if I order you to bring Miss Mary to me,\nhow can Medlock send you away if she finds it out?”",
        "“Please don’t let her, sir,” pleaded Martha.",
        "“I’ll send her away if she dares to say a word about such\na thing,” said Master Craven grandly.  “She wouldn’t\nlike that, I can tell you.”",
        "“Thank you, sir,” bobbing a curtsy, “I want to do my duty, sir.”",
        "“What I want is your duty” said Colin more grandly still.\n\"I’ll take care of you.  Now go away.”",
        "When the door closed behind Martha, Colin found Mistress\nMary gazing at him as if he had set her wondering.",
        "“Why do you look at me like that?” he asked her.\n\"What are you thinking about?”",
        "“I am thinking about two things.”",
        "“What are they? Sit down and tell me.”",
        "“This is the first one,” said Mary, seating herself on the\nbig stool.  “Once in India I saw a boy who was a Rajah.\nHe had rubies and emeralds and diamonds stuck all over him.\nHe spoke to his people just as you spoke to Martha.\nEverybody had to do everything he told them–in a minute.\nI think they would have been killed if they hadn’t.”",
        "“I shall make you tell me about Rajahs presently,” he said,\n\"but first tell me what the second thing was.”",
        "“I was thinking,” said Mary, “how different you are\nfrom Dickon.”",
        "“Who is Dickon?” he said.  “What a queer name!”",
        "She might as well tell him, she thought she could talk\nabout Dickon without mentioning the secret garden.  She had\nliked to hear Martha talk about him.  Besides, she longed\nto talk about him.  It would seem to bring him nearer.",
        "“He is Martha’s brother.  He is twelve years old,\"\nshe explained.  “He is not like any one else in the world.\nHe can charm foxes and squirrels and birds just as the\nnatives in India charm snakes.  He plays a very soft tune\non a pipe and they come and listen.”",
        "There were some big books on a table at his side and he\ndragged one suddenly toward him.  “There is a picture\nof a snake-charmer in this,” he exclaimed.  “Come and look\nat it”",
        "The book was a beautiful one with superb colored\nillustrations and he turned to one of them.",
        "“Can he do that?” he asked eagerly.",
        "“He played on his pipe and they listened,” Mary explained.\n\"But he doesn’t call it Magic.  He says it’s because he\nlives on the moor so much and he knows their ways.  He says\nhe feels sometimes as if he was a bird or a rabbit himself,\nhe likes them so.  I think he asked the robin questions.\nIt seemed as if they talked to each other in soft chirps.”",
        "Colin lay back on his cushion and his eyes grew larger\nand larger and the spots on his cheeks burned.",
        "“Tell me some more about him,” he said.",
        "“He knows all about eggs and nests,” Mary went on.\n\"And he knows where foxes and badgers and otters live.\nHe keeps them secret so that other boys won’t find their holes\nand frighten them.  He knows about everything that grows\nor lives on the moor.”",
        "“Does he like the moor?” said Colin.  “How can he\nwhen it’s such a great, bare, dreary place?”",
        "“It’s the most beautiful place,” protested Mary.\n\"Thousands of lovely things grow on it and there are\nthousands of little creatures all busy building nests\nand making holes and burrows and chippering or singing\nor squeaking to each other.  They are so busy and having\nsuch fun under the earth or in the trees or heather.\nIt’s their world.”",
        "“How do you know all that?” said Colin, turning on his\nelbow to look at her.",
        "“I have never been there once, really,” said Mary\nsuddenly remembering.  “I only drove over it in the dark.\nI thought it was hideous.  Martha told me about it first\nand then Dickon.  When Dickon talks about it you feel\nas if you saw things and heard them and as if you were\nstanding in the heather with the sun shining and the gorse\nsmelling like honey–and all full of bees and butterflies.”",
        "“You never see anything if you are ill,” said\nColin restlessly.  He looked like a person listening\nto a new sound in the distance and wondering what it was.",
        "“You can’t if you stay in a room,” said Mary.",
        "“I couldn’t go on the moor,” he said in a resentful tone.",
        "Mary was silent for a minute and then she said something bold.",
        "“You might–sometime.”",
        "He moved as if he were startled.",
        "“Go on the moor! How could I? I am going to die.\"\n\"How do you know?” said Mary unsympathetically.\nShe didn’t like the way he had of talking about dying.\nShe did not feel very sympathetic.  She felt rather as if he\nalmost boasted about it.",
        "“Oh, I’ve heard it ever since I remember,” he answered crossly.\n\"They are always whispering about it and thinking\nI don’t notice.  They wish I would, too.”",
        "Mistress Mary felt quite contrary.  She pinched her\nlips together.",
        "“If they wished I would,” she said, “I wouldn’t. Who\nwishes you would?”",
        "“The servants–and of course Dr. Craven because he would\nget Misselthwaite and be rich instead of poor.  He daren’t\nsay so, but he always looks cheerful when I am worse.\nWhen I had typhoid fever his face got quite fat.  I think\nmy father wishes it, too.”",
        "“I don’t believe he does,” said Mary quite obstinately.",
        "That made Colin turn and look at her again.",
        "“Don’t you?” he said.",
        "And then he lay back on his cushion and was still, as if\nhe were thinking.  And there was quite a long silence.\nPerhaps they were both of them thinking strange things\nchildren do not usually think.  “I like the grand doctor\nfrom London, because he made them take the iron thing off,\"\nsaid Mary at last “Did he say you were going to die?”",
        "“No.”.",
        "“What did he say?”",
        "“He didn’t whisper,” Colin answered.  “Perhaps he knew I\nhated whispering.  I heard him say one thing quite aloud.\nHe said, ’The lad might live if he would make up his mind\nto it.  Put him in the humor.’ It sounded as if he was\nin a temper.”",
        "“I’ll tell you who would put you in the humor, perhaps,\"\nsaid Mary reflecting.  She felt as if she would like this\nthing to be settled one way or the other.  “I believe\nDickon would.  He’s always talking about live things.\nHe never talks about dead things or things that are ill.\nHe’s always looking up in the sky to watch birds flying–or\nlooking down at the earth to see something growing.\nHe has such round blue eyes and they are so wide open with\nlooking about.  And he laughs such a big laugh with his wide\nmouth–and his cheeks are as red–as red as cherries.\"\nShe pulled her stool nearer to the sofa and her expression\nquite changed at the remembrance of the wide curving mouth\nand wide open eyes.",
        "“See here,” she said.  “Don’t let us talk about dying;\nI don’t like it.  Let us talk about living.  Let us\ntalk and talk about Dickon.  And then we will look at\nyour pictures.”",
        "It was the best thing she could have said.  To talk about\nDickon meant to talk about the moor and about the cottage\nand the fourteen people who lived in it on sixteen shillings\na week–and the children who got fat on the moor grass\nlike the wild ponies.  And about Dickon’s mother–and\nthe skipping-rope–and the moor with the sun on it–and\nabout pale green points sticking up out of the black sod.\nAnd it was all so alive that Mary talked more than she had\never talked before–and Colin both talked and listened as he\nhad never done either before.  And they both began to laugh\nover nothings as children will when they are happy together.\nAnd they laughed so that in the end they were making\nas much noise as if they had been two ordinary healthy\nnatural ten-year-old creatures–instead of a hard, little,\nunloving girl and a sickly boy who believed that he was going to\ndie.",
        "They enjoyed themselves so much that they forgot the\npictures and they forgot about the time.  They had been\nlaughing quite loudly over Ben Weatherstaff and his robin,\nand Colin was actually sitting up as if he had forgotten\nabout his weak back, when he suddenly remembered something.\n\"Do you know there is one thing we have never once\nthought of,” he said.  “We are cousins.”",
        "It seemed so queer that they had talked so much and never\nremembered this simple thing that they laughed more than ever,\nbecause they had got into the humor to laugh at anything.\nAnd in the midst of the fun the door opened and in walked\nDr. Craven and Mrs. Medlock.",
        "Dr. Craven started in actual alarm and Mrs. Medlock almost\nfell back because he had accidentally bumped against her.",
        "“Good Lord!” exclaimed poor Mrs. Medlock with her eyes\nalmost starting out of her head.  “Good Lord!”",
        "“What is this?” said Dr. Craven, coming forward.\n\"What does it mean?”",
        "Then Mary was reminded of the boy Rajah again.\nColin answered as if neither the doctor’s alarm nor\nMrs. Medlock’s terror were of the slightest consequence.\nHe was as little disturbed or frightened as if an elderly\ncat and dog had walked into the room.",
        "“This is my cousin, Mary Lennox,” he said.  “I asked\nher to come and talk to me.  I like her.  She must come\nand talk to me whenever I send for her.”",
        "Dr. Craven turned reproachfully to Mrs. Medlock.\n\"Oh, sir” she panted.  “I don’t know how it’s happened.\nThere’s not a servant on the place tha’d dare to talk–they\nall have their orders.”",
        "“Nobody told her anything,” said Colin.  “She heard\nme crying and found me herself.  I am glad she came.\nDon’t be silly, Medlock.”",
        "Mary saw that Dr. Craven did not look pleased, but it\nwas quite plain that he dare not oppose his patient.\nHe sat down by Colin and felt his pulse.",
        "“I am afraid there has been too much excitement.\nExcitement is not good for you, my boy,” he said.",
        "“I should be excited if she kept away,” answered Colin,\nhis eyes beginning to look dangerously sparkling.\n\"I am better.  She makes me better.  The nurse must bring up\nher tea with mine.  We will have tea together.”",
        "Mrs. Medlock and Dr. Craven looked at each other in a\ntroubled way, but there was evidently nothing to be done.",
        "“He does look rather better, sir,” ventured Mrs. Medlock.\n\"But\"–thinking the matter over–\"he looked better this\nmorning before she came into the room.”",
        "“She came into the room last night.  She stayed with me\na long time.  She sang a Hindustani song to me and it\nmade me go to sleep,” said Colin.  “I was better when I\nwakened up.  I wanted my breakfast.  I want my tea now.\nTell nurse, Medlock.”",
        "Dr. Craven did not stay very long.  He talked to the nurse\nfor a few minutes when she came into the room and said a few\nwords of warning to Colin.  He must not talk too much;\nhe must not forget that he was ill; he must not forget\nthat he was very easily tired.  Mary thought that there\nseemed to be a number of uncomfortable things he was not\nto forget.",
        "Colin looked fretful and kept his strange black-lashed\neyes fixed on Dr. Craven’s face.",
        "“I want to forget it,” he said at last.  “She makes me\nforget it.  That is why I want her.”",
        "Dr. Craven did not look happy when he left the room.\nHe gave a puzzled glance at the little girl sitting on\nthe large stool.  She had become a stiff, silent child\nagain as soon as he entered and he could not see what\nthe attraction was.  The boy actually did look brighter,\nhowever–and he sighed rather heavily as he went down\nthe corridor.",
        "“They are always wanting me to eat things when I don’t\nwant to,” said Colin, as the nurse brought in the tea\nand put it on the table by the sofa.  “Now, if you’ll\neat I will.  Those muffins look so nice and hot.\nTell me about Rajahs.”",
        "After another week of rain the high arch of blue sky\nappeared again and the sun which poured down was quite hot.\nThough there had been no chance to see either the secret\ngarden or Dickon, Mistress Mary had enjoyed herself\nvery much.  The week had not seemed long.  She had spent\nhours of every day with Colin in his room, talking about\nRajahs or gardens or Dickon and the cottage on the moor.\nThey had looked at the splendid books and pictures and\nsometimes Mary had read things to Colin, and sometimes he\nhad read a little to her.  When he was amused and interested\nshe thought he scarcely looked like an invalid at all,\nexcept that his face was so colorless and he was always\non the sofa.",
        "“You are a sly young one to listen and get out of your\nbed to go following things up like you did that night,\"\nMrs. Medlock said once.  “But there’s no saying it’s\nnot been a sort of blessing to the lot of us.  He’s not\nhad a tantrum or a whining fit since you made friends.\nThe nurse was just going to give up the case because she\nwas so sick of him, but she says she doesn’t mind staying\nnow you’ve gone on duty with her,” laughing a little.",
        "In her talks with Colin, Mary had tried to be very cautious\nabout the secret garden.  There were certain things she\nwanted to find out from him, but she felt that she must\nfind them out without asking him direct questions.\nIn the first place, as she began to like to be with him,\nshe wanted to discover whether he was the kind of boy you\ncould tell a secret to.  He was not in the least like Dickon,\nbut he was evidently so pleased with the idea of a garden\nno one knew anything about that she thought perhaps he\ncould be trusted.  But she had not known him long enough\nto be sure.  The second thing she wanted to find out was\nthis: If he could be trusted–if he really could–wouldn’t\nit be possible to take him to the garden without having\nany one find it out? The grand doctor had said that he must\nhave fresh air and Colin had said that he would not mind\nfresh air in a secret garden.  Perhaps if he had a great\ndeal of fresh air and knew Dickon and the robin and saw\nthings growing he might not think so much about dying.\nMary had seen herself in the glass sometimes lately when she\nhad realized that she looked quite a different creature\nfrom the child she had seen when she arrived from India.\nThis child looked nicer.  Even Martha had seen a change\nin her.",
        "“Th’ air from th’ moor has done thee good already,\"\nshe had said.  “Tha’rt not nigh so yeller and tha’rt not\nnigh so scrawny.  Even tha’ hair doesn’t slamp down on tha’\nhead so flat.  It’s got some life in it so as it sticks\nout a bit.”",
        "“It’s like me,” said Mary.  “It’s growing stronger\nand fatter.  I’m sure there’s more of it.”",
        "“It looks it, for sure,” said Martha, ruffling it up\na little round her face.  “Tha’rt not half so ugly when\nit’s that way an’ there’s a bit o’ red in tha’ cheeks.”",
        "If gardens and fresh air had been good for her perhaps they\nwould be good for Colin.  But then, if he hated people\nto look at him, perhaps he would not like to see Dickon.",
        "“Why does it make you angry when you are looked at?\"\nshe inquired one day.",
        "“I always hated it,” he answered, “even when I was very little.\nThen when they took me to the seaside and I used to lie\nin my carriage everybody used to stare and ladies would\nstop and talk to my nurse and then they would begin to\nwhisper and I knew then they were saying I shouldn’t live\nto grow up.  Then sometimes the ladies would pat my cheeks\nand say `Poor child!’ Once when a lady did that I screamed\nout loud and bit her hand.  She was so frightened she ran away.”",
        "“She thought you had gone mad like a dog,” said Mary,\nnot at all admiringly.",
        "“I don’t care what she thought,” said Colin, frowning.",
        "“I wonder why you didn’t scream and bite me when I came\ninto your room?” said Mary.  Then she began to smile slowly.",
        "“I thought you were a ghost or a dream,” he said.\n\"You can’t bite a ghost or a dream, and if you scream they\ndon’t care.”",
        "“Would you hate it if–if a boy looked at you?\"\nMary asked uncertainly.",
        "He lay back on his cushion and paused thoughtfully.",
        "“There’s one boy,” he said quite slowly, as if he were thinking\nover every word, “there’s one boy I believe I shouldn’t mind.\nIt’s that boy who knows where the foxes live–Dickon.”",
        "“I’m sure you wouldn’t mind him,” said Mary.",
        "“The birds don’t and other animals,” he said, still thinking\nit over, “perhaps that’s why I shouldn’t. He’s a sort\nof animal charmer and I am a boy animal.”",
        "Then he laughed and she laughed too; in fact it ended\nin their both laughing a great deal and finding the idea\nof a boy animal hiding in his hole very funny indeed.",
        "What Mary felt afterward was that she need not fear\nabout Dickon.",
        "On that first morning when the sky was blue again Mary wakened\nvery early.  The sun was pouring in slanting rays through\nthe blinds and there was something so joyous in the sight\nof it that she jumped out of bed and ran to the window.\nShe drew up the blinds and opened the window itself\nand a great waft of fresh, scented air blew in upon her.\nThe moor was blue and the whole world looked as if something\nMagic had happened to it.  There were tender little\nfluting sounds here and there and everywhere, as if scores\nof birds were beginning to tune up for a concert.\nMary put her hand out of the window and held it in the sun.",
        "“It’s warm–warm!” she said.  “It will make the green\npoints push up and up and up, and it will make the bulbs\nand roots work and struggle with all their might under\nthe earth.”",
        "She kneeled down and leaned out of the window as far\nas she could, breathing big breaths and sniffing the air\nuntil she laughed because she remembered what Dickon’s\nmother had said about the end of his nose quivering\nlike a rabbit’s. “It must be very early,” she said.\n\"The little clouds are all pink and I’ve never seen\nthe sky look like this.  No one is up.  I don’t even hear\nthe stable boys.”",
        "A sudden thought made her scramble to her feet.",
        "“I can’t wait! I am going to see the garden!”",
        "She had learned to dress herself by this time and she put\non her clothes in five minutes.  She knew a small side door\nwhich she could unbolt herself and she flew downstairs\nin her stocking feet and put on her shoes in the hall.\nShe unchained and unbolted and unlocked and when the door\nwas open she sprang across the step with one bound,\nand there she was standing on the grass, which seemed\nto have turned green, and with the sun pouring down on\nher and warm sweet wafts about her and the fluting and\ntwittering and singing coming from every bush and tree.\nShe clasped her hands for pure joy and looked up in the sky\nand it was so blue and pink and pearly and white and flooded\nwith springtime light that she felt as if she must flute\nand sing aloud herself and knew that thrushes and robins\nand skylarks could not possibly help it.  She ran around\nthe shrubs and paths towards the secret garden.",
        "“It is all different already,” she said.  “The grass is\ngreener and things are sticking up everywhere and things\nare uncurling and green buds of leaves are showing.\nThis afternoon I am sure Dickon will come.”",
        "The long warm rain had done strange things to the\nherbaceous beds which bordered the walk by the lower wall.\nThere were things sprouting and pushing out from the\nroots of clumps of plants and there were actually here\nand there glimpses of royal purple and yellow unfurling\namong the stems of crocuses.  Six months before Mistress\nMary would not have seen how the world was waking up,\nbut now she missed nothing.",
        "When she had reached the place where the door hid itself\nunder the ivy, she was startled by a curious loud sound.\nIt was the caw–caw of a crow and it came from the top\nof the wall, and when she looked up, there sat a big\nglossy-plumaged blue-black bird, looking down at her very\nwisely indeed.  She had never seen a crow so close before\nand he made her a little nervous, but the next moment he\nspread his wings and flapped away across the garden.\nShe hoped he was not going to stay inside and she\npushed the door open wondering if he would.  When she\ngot fairly into the garden she saw that he probably\ndid intend to stay because he had alighted on a dwarf\napple-tree and under the apple-tree was lying a little\nreddish animal with a Bushy tail, and both of them were\nwatching the stooping body and rust-red head of Dickon,\nwho was kneeling on the grass working hard.",
        "Mary flew across the grass to him.",
        "“Oh, Dickon! Dickon!” she cried out.  “How could you get\nhere so early! How could you! The sun has only just got up!”",
        "He got up himself, laughing and glowing, and tousled;\nhis eyes like a bit of the sky.",
        "“Eh!” he said.  “I was up long before him.  How could I\nhave stayed abed! Th’ world’s all fair begun again this\nmornin’, it has.  An’ it’s workin’ an’ hummin’ an’ scratchin’\nan’ pipin’ an’ nest-buildin’ an’ breathin’ out scents,\ntill you’ve got to be out on it ’stead o’ lyin’ on your back.\nWhen th’ sun did jump up, th’ moor went mad for joy, an’\nI was in the midst of th’ heather, an’ I run like mad\nmyself, shoutin’ an’ singin’. An’ I come straight here.\nI couldn’t have stayed away.  Why, th’ garden was lyin’\nhere waitin’!”",
        "Mary put her hands on her chest, panting, as if she\nhad been running herself.",
        "“Oh, Dickon! Dickon!” she said.  “I’m so happy I can\nscarcely breathe!”",
        "Seeing him talking to a stranger, the little bushy-tailed\nanimal rose from its place under the tree and came to him,\nand the rook, cawing once, flew down from its branch\nand settled quietly on his shoulder.",
        "“This is th’ little fox cub,” he said, rubbing the little\nreddish animal’s head.  “It’s named Captain.  An’ this\nhere’s Soot.  Soot he flew across th’ moor with me an’\nCaptain he run same as if th’ hounds had been after him.\nThey both felt same as I did.”",
        "Neither of the creatures looked as if he were the least\nafraid of Mary.  When Dickon began to walk about,\nSoot stayed on his shoulder and Captain trotted quietly\nclose to his side.",
        "“See here!” said Dickon.  “See how these has\npushed up, an’ these an’ these! An’ Eh! Look at these here!”",
        "He threw himself upon his knees and Mary went\ndown beside him.  They had come upon a whole clump\nof crocuses burst into purple and orange and gold.\nMary bent her face down and kissed and kissed them.",
        "“You never kiss a person in that way,” she said when she\nlifted her head.  “Flowers are so different.”",
        "He looked puzzled but smiled.",
        "“Eh!” he said, “I’ve kissed mother many a time that way\nwhen I come in from th’ moor after a day’s roamin’ an’\nshe stood there at th’ door in th’ sun, lookin’ so glad an’\ncomfortable.” They ran from one part of the garden to\nanother and found so many wonders that they were obliged\nto remind themselves that they must whisper or speak low.\nHe showed her swelling leafbuds on rose branches which\nhad seemed dead.  He showed her ten thousand new green\npoints pushing through the mould.  They put their eager\nyoung noses close to the earth and sniffed its warmed\nspringtime breathing; they dug and pulled and laughed low\nwith rapture until Mistress Mary’s hair was as tumbled\nas Dickon’s and her cheeks were almost as poppy red as his.",
        "There was every joy on earth in the secret garden\nthat morning, and in the midst of them came a delight\nmore delightful than all, because it was more wonderful.\nSwiftly something flew across the wall and darted through\nthe trees to a close grown corner, a little flare of\nred-breasted bird with something hanging from its beak.\nDickon stood quite still and put his hand on Mary almost\nas if they had suddenly found themselves laughing in a church.",
        "“We munnot stir,” he whispered in broad Yorkshire.\n\"We munnot scarce breathe.  I knowed he was mate-huntin’\nwhen I seed him last.  It’s Ben Weatherstaff’s robin.\nHe’s buildin’ his nest.  He’ll stay here if us don’t fight him.\"\nThey settled down softly upon the grass and sat there\nwithout moving.",
        "“Us mustn’t seem as if us was watchin’ him too close,\"\nsaid Dickon.  “He’d be out with us for good if he got th’\nnotion us was interferin’ now.  He’ll be a good bit different\ntill all this is over.  He’s settin’ up housekeepin’.\nHe’ll be shyer an’ readier to take things ill.\nHe’s got no time for visitin’ an’ gossipin’. Us must\nkeep still a bit an’ try to look as if us was grass an’\ntrees an’ bushes.  Then when he’s got used to seein’\nus I’ll chirp a bit an’ he’ll know us’ll not be in\nhis way.”",
        "Mistress Mary was not at all sure that she knew, as Dickon\nseemed to, how to try to look like grass and trees and bushes.\nBut he had said the queer thing as if it were the simplest\nand most natural thing in the world, and she felt it must\nbe quite easy to him, and indeed she watched him for a few\nminutes carefully, wondering if it was possible for him\nto quietly turn green and put out branches and leaves.\nBut he only sat wonderfully still, and when he spoke\ndropped his voice to such a softness that it was curious\nthat she could hear him, but she could.",
        "“It’s part o’ th’ springtime, this nest-buildin’\nis,” he said.  “I warrant it’s been goin’ on in th’\nsame way every year since th’ world was begun.\nThey’ve got their way o’ thinkin’ and doin’ things an’\na body had better not meddle.  You can lose a friend\nin springtime easier than any other season if you’re too\ncurious.”",
        "“If we talk about him I can’t help looking at him,” Mary said\nas softly as possible.  “We must talk of something else.\nThere is something I want to tell you.”",
        "“He’ll like it better if us talks o’ somethin’ else,\"\nsaid Dickon.  “What is it tha’s got to tell me?”",
        "“Well–do you know about Colin?” she whispered.",
        "He turned his head to look at her.",
        "“What does tha’ know about him?” he asked.",
        "“I’ve seen him.  I have been to talk to him every day\nthis week.  He wants me to come.  He says I’m making him\nforget about being ill and dying,” answered Mary.",
        "Dickon looked actually relieved as soon as the surprise\ndied away from his round face.",
        "“I am glad o’ that,” he exclaimed.  “I’m right down glad.\nIt makes me easier.  I knowed I must say nothin’ about him an’\nI don’t like havin’ to hide things.”",
        "“Don’t you like hiding the garden?” said Mary.",
        "“I’ll never tell about it,” he answered.  “But I says\nto mother, `Mother,’ I says, `I got a secret to keep.\nIt’s not a bad ’un, tha’ knows that.  It’s no worse\nthan hidin’ where a bird’s nest is.  Tha’ doesn’t mind it,\ndoes tha’?’”",
        "Mary always wanted to hear about mother.",
        "“What did she say?” she asked, not at all afraid to hear.",
        "Dickon grinned sweet-temperedly.",
        "“It was just like her, what she said,” he answered.\n\"She give my head a bit of a rub an’ laughed an’ she says,\n’Eh, lad, tha’ can have all th’ secrets tha’ likes.\nI’ve knowed thee twelve year’.’”",
        "“How did you know about Colin?” asked Mary.",
        "“Everybody as knowed about Mester Craven knowed there was\na little lad as was like to be a cripple, an’ they knowed\nMester Craven didn’t like him to be talked about.  Folks is\nsorry for Mester Craven because Mrs. Craven was such a pretty\nyoung lady an’ they was so fond of each other.  Mrs. Medlock\nstops in our cottage whenever she goes to Thwaite an’\nshe doesn’t mind talkin’ to mother before us children,\nbecause she knows us has been brought up to be trusty.\nHow did tha’ find out about him? Martha was in fine\ntrouble th’ last time she came home.  She said tha’d\nheard him frettin’ an’ tha’ was askin’ questions an’\nshe didn’t know what to say.”",
        "Mary told him her story about the midnight wuthering\nof the wind which had wakened her and about the faint\nfar-off sounds of the complaining voice which had led\nher down the dark corridors with her candle and had\nended with her opening of the door of the dimly lighted\nroom with the carven four-posted bed in the corner.\nWhen she described the small ivory-white face and the\nstrange black-rimmed eyes Dickon shook his head.",
        "“Them’s just like his mother’s eyes, only hers was\nalways laughin’, they say,” he said.  “They say as\nMr. Craven can’t bear to see him when he’s awake an’\nit’s because his eyes is so like his mother’s an’\nyet looks so different in his miserable bit of a face.”",
        "“Do you think he wants to die?” whispered Mary.",
        "“No, but he wishes he’d never been born.  Mother she\nsays that’s th’ worst thing on earth for a child.\nThem as is not wanted scarce ever thrives.  Mester Craven\nhe’d buy anythin’ as money could buy for th’ poor lad\nbut he’d like to forget as he’s on earth.  For one thing,\nhe’s afraid he’ll look at him some day and find he’s\ngrowed hunchback.”",
        "“Colin’s so afraid of it himself that he won’t sit up,\"\nsaid Mary.  “He says he’s always thinking that if he\nshould feel a lump coming he should go crazy and scream\nhimself to death.”",
        "“Eh! he oughtn’t to lie there thinkin’ things like that,\"\nsaid Dickon.  “No lad could get well as thought them\nsort o’ things.”",
        "The fox was lying on the grass close by him, looking up to\nask for a pat now and then, and Dickon bent down and rubbed\nhis neck softly and thought a few minutes in silence.\nPresently he lifted his head and looked round the garden.",
        "“When first we got in here,” he said, “it seemed like\neverything was gray.  Look round now and tell me if tha’\ndoesn’t see a difference.”",
        "Mary looked and caught her breath a little.",
        "“Why!” she cried, “the gray wall is changing.\nIt is as if a green mist were creeping over it.\nIt’s almost like a green gauze veil.”",
        "“Aye,” said Dickon.  “An’ it’ll be greener and greener till th’\ngray’s all gone.  Can tha’ guess what I was thinkin’?”",
        "“I know it was something nice,” said Mary eagerly.\n\"I believe it was something about Colin.”",
        "“I was thinkin’ that if he was out here he wouldn’t be watchin’\nfor lumps to grow on his back; he’d be watchin’ for buds\nto break on th’ rose-bushes, an’ he’d likely be healthier,\"\nexplained Dickon.  “I was wonderin’ if us could ever\nget him in th’ humor to come out here an’ lie under th’\ntrees in his carriage.”",
        "“I’ve been wondering that myself.  I’ve thought of it\nalmost every time I’ve talked to him,” said Mary.\n\"I’ve wondered if he could keep a secret and I’ve wondered\nif we could bring him here without any one seeing us.\nI thought perhaps you could push his carriage.  The doctor\nsaid he must have fresh air and if he wants us to take him\nout no one dare disobey him.  He won’t go out for other people\nand perhaps they will be glad if he will go out with us.\nHe could order the gardeners to keep away so they wouldn’t\nfind out.”",
        "Dickon was thinking very hard as he scratched Captain’s back.",
        "“It’d be good for him, I’ll warrant,” he said.\n\"Us’d not be thinkin’ he’d better never been born.\nUs’d be just two children watchin’ a garden grow, an’\nhe’d be another.  Two lads an’ a little lass just lookin’\non at th’ springtime.  I warrant it’d be better than\ndoctor’s stuff.”",
        "“He’s been lying in his room so long and he’s always\nbeen so afraid of his back that it has made him queer,\"\nsaid Mary.  “He knows a good many things out of books\nbut he doesn’t know anything else.  He says he has been\ntoo ill to notice things and he hates going out of doors\nand hates gardens and gardeners.  But he likes to hear\nabout this garden because it is a secret.  I daren’t tell\nhim much but he said he wanted to see it.”",
        "“Us’ll have him out here sometime for sure,” said Dickon.\n\"I could push his carriage well enough.  Has tha’\nnoticed how th’ robin an’ his mate has been workin’\nwhile we’ve been sittin’ here? Look at him perched on that\nbranch wonderin’ where it’d be best to put that twig he’s\ngot in his beak.”",
        "He made one of his low whistling calls and the robin turned\nhis head and looked at him inquiringly, still holding\nhis twig.  Dickon spoke to him as Ben Weatherstaff did,\nbut Dickon’s tone was one of friendly advice.",
        "“Wheres’ever tha’ puts it,” he said, “it’ll be\nall right.  Tha’ knew how to build tha’ nest before tha’\ncame out o’ th’ egg.  Get on with thee, lad.  Tha’st got\nno time to lose.”",
        "“Oh, I do like to hear you talk to him!” Mary said,\nlaughing delightedly.  “Ben Weatherstaff scolds him\nand makes fun of him, and he hops about and looks as\nif he understood every word, and I know he likes it.\nBen Weatherstaff says he is so conceited he would rather\nhave stones thrown at him than not be noticed.”",
        "Dickon laughed too and went on talking.",
        "“Tha’ knows us won’t trouble thee,” he said to the robin.\n\"Us is near bein’ wild things ourselves.  Us is nest-buildin’\ntoo, bless thee.  Look out tha’ doesn’t tell on us.”",
        "And though the robin did not answer, because his beak\nwas occupied, Mary knew that when he flew away with his\ntwig to his own corner of the garden the darkness of his\ndew-bright eye meant that he would not tell their secret\nfor the world.",
        "They found a great deal to do that morning and Mary\nwas late in returning to the house and was also in such\na hurry to get back to her work that she quite forgot\nColin until the last moment.",
        "“Tell Colin that I can’t come and see him yet,” she said\nto Martha.  “I’m very busy in the garden.”",
        "Martha looked rather frightened.",
        "“Eh! Miss Mary,” she said, “it may put him all out\nof humor when I tell him that.”",
        "But Mary was not as afraid of him as other people were\nand she was not a self-sacrificing person.",
        "“I can’t stay,” she answered.  “Dickon’s waiting for me;\"\nand she ran away.",
        "The afternoon was even lovelier and busier than the morning\nhad been.  Already nearly all the weeds were cleared\nout of the garden and most of the roses and trees had\nbeen pruned or dug about.  Dickon had brought a spade\nof his own and he had taught Mary to use all her tools,\nso that by this time it was plain that though the lovely\nwild place was not likely to become a “gardener’s garden\"\nit would be a wilderness of growing things before the\nspringtime was over.",
        "“There’ll be apple blossoms an’ cherry blossoms overhead,\"\nDickon said, working away with all his might.\n\"An’ there’ll be peach an’ plum trees in bloom against th’\nwalls, an’ th’ grass’ll be a carpet o’ flowers.”",
        "The little fox and the rook were as happy and busy\nas they were, and the robin and his mate flew\nbackward and forward like tiny streaks of lightning.\nSometimes the rook flapped his black wings and soared away\nover the tree-tops in the park.  Each time he came back\nand perched near Dickon and cawed several times as if he\nwere relating his adventures, and Dickon talked to him\njust as he had talked to the robin.  Once when Dickon\nwas so busy that he did not answer him at first, Soot flew\non to his shoulders and gently tweaked his ear with his\nlarge beak.  When Mary wanted to rest a little Dickon\nsat down with her under a tree and once he took his pipe\nout of his pocket and played the soft strange little notes\nand two squirrels appeared on the wall and looked and listened.",
        "“Tha’s a good bit stronger than tha’ was,” Dickon said,\nlooking at her as she was digging.  “Tha’s beginning\nto look different, for sure.”",
        "Mary was glowing with exercise and good spirits.",
        "“I’m getting fatter and fatter every day,” she said\nquite exultantly.  “Mrs. Medlock will have to get me some\nbigger dresses.  Martha says my hair is growing thicker.\nIt isn’t so flat and stringy.”",
        "The sun was beginning to set and sending deep gold-colored\nrays slanting under the trees when they parted.",
        "“It’ll be fine tomorrow,” said Dickon.  “I’ll be at work\nby sunrise.”",
        "“So will I,” said Mary.",
        "She ran back to the house as quickly as her feet would\ncarry her.  She wanted to tell Colin about Dickon’s fox cub\nand the rook and about what the springtime had been doing.\nShe felt sure he would like to hear.  So it was not very\npleasant when she opened the door of her room, to see\nMartha standing waiting for her with a doleful face.",
        "“What is the matter?” she asked.  “What did Colin say\nwhen you told him I couldn’t come?”",
        "“Eh!” said Martha, “I wish tha’d gone.  He was nigh goin’\ninto one o’ his tantrums.  There’s been a nice to do all\nafternoon to keep him quiet.  He would watch the clock\nall th’ time.”",
        "Mary’s lips pinched themselves together.  She was no more\nused to considering other people than Colin was and she\nsaw no reason why an ill-tempered boy should interfere\nwith the thing she liked best.  She knew nothing about\nthe pitifulness of people who had been ill and nervous\nand who did not know that they could control their tempers\nand need not make other people ill and nervous, too.\nWhen she had had a headache in India she had done her\nbest to see that everybody else also had a headache or\nsomething quite as bad.  And she felt she was quite right;\nbut of course now she felt that Colin was quite wrong.",
        "He was not on his sofa when she went into his room.\nHe was lying flat on his back in bed and he did not turn\nhis head toward her as she came in.  This was a bad beginning\nand Mary marched up to him with her stiff manner.",
        "“Why didn’t you get up?” she said.",
        "“I did get up this morning when I thought you were coming,\"\nhe answered, without looking at her.  “I made them put\nme back in bed this afternoon.  My back ached and my\nhead ached and I was tired.  Why didn’t you come?\"\n\"I was working in the garden with Dickon,” said Mary.",
        "Colin frowned and condescended to look at her.",
        "“I won’t let that boy come here if you go and stay\nwith him instead of coming to talk to me,” he said.",
        "Mary flew into a fine passion.  She could fly into\na passion without making a noise.  She just grew sour\nand obstinate and did not care what happened.",
        "“If you send Dickon away, I’ll never come into this\nroom again!” she retorted.",
        "“You’ll have to if I want you,” said Colin.",
        "“I won’t!” said Mary.",
        "“I’ll make you,” said Colin.  “They shall drag you in.”",
        "“Shall they, Mr. Rajah!” said Mary fiercely.  “They may drag\nme in but they can’t make me talk when they get me here.\nI’ll sit and clench my teeth and never tell you one thing.\nI won’t even look at you.  I’ll stare at the floor!”",
        "They were a nice agreeable pair as they glared at each other.\nIf they had been two little street boys they would have\nsprung at each other and had a rough-and-tumble fight.\nAs it was, they did the next thing to it.",
        "“You are a selfish thing!” cried Colin.",
        "“What are you?” said Mary.  “Selfish people always say that.\nAny one is selfish who doesn’t do what they want.\nYou’re more selfish than I am.  You’re the most selfish boy\nI ever saw.”",
        "“I’m not!” snapped Colin.  “I’m not as selfish as your\nfine Dickon is! He keeps you playing in the dirt when he\nknows I am all by myself.  He’s selfish, if you like!”",
        "Mary’s eyes flashed fire.",
        "“He’s nicer than any other boy that ever lived!” she said.\n\"He’s–he’s like an angel!” It might sound rather silly\nto say that but she did not care.",
        "“A nice angel!” Colin sneered ferociously.  “He’s a common\ncottage boy off the moor!”",
        "“He’s better than a common Rajah!” retorted Mary.\n\"He’s a thousand times better!”",
        "Because she was the stronger of the two she was beginning\nto get the better of him.  The truth was that he had\nnever had a fight with any one like himself in his\nlife and, upon the whole, it was rather good for him,\nthough neither he nor Mary knew anything about that.\nHe turned his head on his pillow and shut his eyes\nand a big tear was squeezed out and ran down his cheek.\nHe was beginning to feel pathetic and sorry for himself–not\nfor any one else.",
        "“I’m not as selfish as you, because I’m always ill,\nand I’m sure there is a lump coming on my back,” he said.\n\"And I am going to die besides.”",
        "“You’re not!” contradicted Mary unsympathetically.",
        "He opened his eyes quite wide with indignation.\nHe had never heard such a thing said before.  He was at\nonce furious and slightly pleased, if a person could\nbe both at one time.",
        "“I’m not?” he cried.  “I am! You know I am! Everybody\nsays so.”",
        "“I don’t believe it!” said Mary sourly.  “You just say\nthat to make people sorry.  I believe you’re proud of it.\nI don’t believe it! If you were a nice boy it might be\ntrue–but you’re too nasty!”",
        "In spite of his invalid back Colin sat up in bed in quite\na healthy rage.",
        "“Get out of the room!” he shouted and he caught hold\nof his pillow and threw it at her.  He was not strong\nenough to throw it far and it only fell at her feet,\nbut Mary’s face looked as pinched as a nutcracker.",
        "“I’m going,” she said.  “And I won’t come back!\"\nShe walked to the door and when she reached it she turned\nround and spoke again.",
        "“I was going to tell you all sorts of nice things,\"\nshe said.  “Dickon brought his fox and his rook and I was\ngoing to tell you all about them.  Now I won’t tell you\na single thing!”",
        "She marched out of the door and closed it behind her,\nand there to her great astonishment she found the trained\nnurse standing as if she had been listening and, more amazing\nstill–she was laughing.  She was a big handsome young\nwoman who ought not to have been a trained nurse at all,\nas she could not bear invalids and she was always\nmaking excuses to leave Colin to Martha or any one else\nwho would take her place.  Mary had never liked her,\nand she simply stood and gazed up at her as she stood\ngiggling into her handkerchief..",
        "“What are you laughing at?” she asked her.",
        "“At you two young ones,” said the nurse.  “It’s the best\nthing that could happen to the sickly pampered thing\nto have some one to stand up to him that’s as spoiled\nas himself;” and she laughed into her handkerchief again.\n\"If he’d had a young vixen of a sister to fight with it\nwould have been the saving of him.”",
        "“Is he going to die?”",
        "“I don’t know and I don’t care,” said the nurse.\n\"Hysterics and temper are half what ails him.”",
        "“What are hysterics?” asked Mary.",
        "“You’ll find out if you work him into a tantrum after\nthis–but at any rate you’ve given him something to have\nhysterics about, and I’m glad of it.”",
        "Mary went back to her room not feeling at all as she\nhad felt when she had come in from the garden.  She was\ncross and disappointed but not at all sorry for Colin.\nShe had looked forward to telling him a great many things\nand she had meant to try to make up her mind whether\nit would be safe to trust him with the great secret.\nShe had been beginning to think it would be, but now she\nhad changed her mind entirely.  She would never tell him\nand he could stay in his room and never get any fresh\nair and die if he liked! It would serve him right! She\nfelt so sour and unrelenting that for a few minutes she\nalmost forgot about Dickon and the green veil creeping\nover the world and the soft wind blowing down from\nthe moor.",
        "Martha was waiting for her and the trouble in her face\nhad been temporarily replaced by interest and curiosity.\nThere was a wooden box on the table and its cover had been\nremoved and revealed that it was full of neat packages.",
        "“Mr. Craven sent it to you,” said Martha.  “It looks\nas if it had picture-books in it.”",
        "Mary remembered what he had asked her the day she had gone\nto his room.  “Do you want anything–dolls–toys –books?\"\nShe opened the package wondering if he had sent a doll,\nand also wondering what she should do with it if he had.\nBut he had not sent one.  There were several beautiful\nbooks such as Colin had, and two of them were about gardens\nand were full of pictures.  There were two or three games\nand there was a beautiful little writing-case with a gold\nmonogram on it and a gold pen and inkstand.",
        "Everything was so nice that her pleasure began to crowd\nher anger out of her mind.  She had not expected him\nto remember her at all and her hard little heart grew\nquite warm.",
        "“I can write better than I can print,” she said,\n\"and the first thing I shall write with that pen will\nbe a letter to tell him I am much obliged.”",
        "If she had been friends with Colin she would have run to show\nhim her presents at once, and they would have looked at the\npictures and read some of the gardening books and perhaps\ntried playing the games, and he would have enjoyed himself\nso much he would never once have thought he was going\nto die or have put his hand on his spine to see if there\nwas a lump coming.  He had a way of doing that which she\ncould not bear.  It gave her an uncomfortable frightened\nfeeling because he always looked so frightened himself.\nHe said that if he felt even quite a little lump\nsome day he should know his hunch had begun to grow.\nSomething he had heard Mrs. Medlock whispering to the\nnurse had given him the idea and he had thought over it\nin secret until it was quite firmly fixed in his mind.\nMrs. Medlock had said his father’s back had begun to show\nits crookedness in that way when he was a child.  He had\nnever told any one but Mary that most of his “tantrums\"\nas they called them grew out of his hysterical hidden fear.\nMary had been sorry for him when he had told her.",
        "“He always began to think about it when he was cross or tired,\"\nshe said to herself.  “And he has been cross today.\nPerhaps–perhaps he has been thinking about it all afternoon.”",
        "She stood still, looking down at the carpet and thinking.",
        "“I said I would never go back again–” she hesitated,\nknitting her brows–\"but perhaps, just perhaps,\nI will go and see–if he wants me–in the morning.\nPerhaps he’ll try to throw his pillow at me again,\nbut–I think–I’ll go.”",
        "She had got up very early in the morning and had worked\nhard in the garden and she was tired and sleepy, so as soon\nas Martha had brought her supper and she had eaten it,\nshe was glad to go to bed.  As she laid her head on\nthe pillow she murmured to herself:",
        "“I’ll go out before breakfast and work with Dickon\nand then afterward–I believe–I’ll go to see him.”",
        "She thought it was the middle of the night when she was\nawakened by such dreadful sounds that she jumped out of\nbed in an instant.  What was it–what was it? The next\nminute she felt quite sure she knew.  Doors were opened\nand shut and there were hurrying feet in the corridors\nand some one was crying and screaming at the same time,\nscreaming and crying in a horrible way.",
        "“It’s Colin,” she said.  “He’s having one of those tantrums\nthe nurse called hysterics.  How awful it sounds.”",
        "As she listened to the sobbing screams she did not\nwonder that people were so frightened that they gave\nhim his own way in everything rather than hear them.\nShe put her hands over her ears and felt sick and shivering.",
        "“I don’t know what to do.  I don’t know what to do,\"\nshe kept saying.  “I can’t bear it.”",
        "Once she wondered if he would stop if she dared go\nto him and then she remembered how he had driven her out\nof the room and thought that perhaps the sight of her\nmight make him worse.  Even when she pressed her hands\nmore tightly over her ears she could not keep the awful\nsounds out.  She hated them so and was so terrified\nby them that suddenly they began to make her angry\nand she felt as if she should like to fly into a tantrum\nherself and frighten him as he was frightening her.\nShe was not used to any one’s tempers but her own.  She took\nher hands from her ears and sprang up and stamped her foot.",
        "“He ought to be stopped! Somebody ought to make him stop!\nSomebody ought to beat him!” she cried out.",
        "Just then she heard feet almost running down the corridor\nand her door opened and the nurse came in.  She was not\nlaughing now by any means.  She even looked rather pale.",
        "“He’s worked himself into hysterics,” she said in a great hurry.\n\"He’ll do himself harm.  No one can do anything with him.\nYou come and try, like a good child.  He likes you.”",
        "“He turned me out of the room this morning,” said Mary,\nstamping her foot with excitement.",
        "The stamp rather pleased the nurse.  The truth was that she\nhad been afraid she might find Mary crying and hiding\nher head under the bed-clothes.",
        "“That’s right,” she said.  “You’re in the right humor.\nYou go and scold him.  Give him something new to think of.\nDo go, child, as quick as ever you can.”",
        "It was not until afterward that Mary realized that the thing\nhad been funny as well as dreadful–that it was funny that all\nthe grown-up people were so frightened that they came to a little\ngirl just because they guessed she was almost as bad as Colin\nhimself.",
        "She flew along the corridor and the nearer she got\nto the screams the higher her temper mounted.\nShe felt quite wicked by the time she reached the door.\nShe slapped it open with her hand and ran across the room\nto the four-posted bed.",
        "“You stop!” she almost shouted.  “You stop! I hate you!\nEverybody hates you! I wish everybody would run out of the\nhouse and let you scream yourself to death! You will scream\nyourself to death in a minute, and I wish you would!\"\nA nice sympathetic child could neither have thought nor\nsaid such things, but it just happened that the shock of\nhearing them was the best possible thing for this hysterical\nboy whom no one had ever dared to restrain or contradict.",
        "He had been lying on his face beating his pillow with his\nhands and he actually almost jumped around, he turned\nso quickly at the sound of the furious little voice.\nHis face looked dreadful, white and red and swollen,\nand he was gasping and choking; but savage little Mary did\nnot care an atom.",
        "“If you scream another scream,” she said, “I’ll scream\ntoo –and I can scream louder than you can and I’ll\nfrighten you, I’ll frighten you!”",
        "He actually had stopped screaming because she had startled\nhim so.  The scream which had been coming almost choked him.\nThe tears were streaming down his face and he shook\nall over.",
        "“I can’t stop!” he gasped and sobbed.  “I can’t–I can’t!”",
        "“You can!” shouted Mary.  “Half that ails you is hysterics\nand temper–just hysterics–hysterics–hysterics!\"\nand she stamped each time she said it.",
        "“I felt the lump–I felt it,” choked out Colin.\n\"I knew I should.  I shall have a hunch on my back and then\nI shall die,” and he began to writhe again and turned\non his face and sobbed and wailed but he didn’t scream.",
        "“You didn’t feel a lump!” contradicted Mary fiercely.  “If you\ndid it was only a hysterical lump.  Hysterics makes lumps.\nThere’s nothing the matter with your horrid back–nothing\nbut hysterics! Turn over and let me look at it!”",
        "She liked the word “hysterics” and felt somehow as if it\nhad an effect on him.  He was probably like herself\nand had never heard it before.",
        "“Nurse,” she commanded, “come here and show me his back\nthis minute!”",
        "The nurse, Mrs. Medlock and Martha had been standing\nhuddled together near the door staring at her, their mouths\nhalf open.  All three had gasped with fright more than once.\nThe nurse came forward as if she were half afraid.\nColin was heaving with great breathless sobs.",
        "“Perhaps he–he won’t let me,” she hesitated in a low voice.",
        "Colin heard her, however, and he gasped out between two\nsobs:",
        "“Sh-show her! She-she’ll see then!”",
        "It was a poor thin back to look at when it was bared.\nEvery rib could be counted and every joint of the spine,\nthough Mistress Mary did not count them as she bent over\nand examined them with a solemn savage little face.\nShe looked so sour and old-fashioned that the nurse turned\nher head aside to hide the twitching of her mouth.\nThere was just a minute’s silence, for even Colin tried\nto hold his breath while Mary looked up and down his spine,\nand down and up, as intently as if she had been the great\ndoctor from London.",
        "“There’s not a single lump there!” she said at last.\n\"There’s not a lump as big as a pin–except backbone lumps,\nand you can only feel them because you’re thin.\nI’ve got backbone lumps myself, and they used to stick\nout as much as yours do, until I began to get fatter,\nand I am not fat enough yet to hide them.  There’s not\na lump as big as a pin! If you ever say there is again,\nI shall laugh!”",
        "No one but Colin himself knew what effect those crossly\nspoken childish words had on him.  If he had ever\nhad any one to talk to about his secret terrors–if he\nhad ever dared to let himself ask questions–if he had\nhad childish companions and had not lain on his back\nin the huge closed house, breathing an atmosphere heavy\nwith the fears of people who were most of them ignorant\nand tired of him, he would have found out that most\nof his fright and illness was created by himself.\nBut he had lain and thought of himself and his aches\nand weariness for hours and days and months and years.\nAnd now that an angry unsympathetic little girl insisted\nobstinately that he was not as ill as he thought he was\nhe actually felt as if she might be speaking the truth.",
        "“I didn’t know,” ventured the nurse, “that he thought he\nhad a lump on his spine.  His back is weak because he\nwon’t try to sit up.  I could have told him there was no\nlump there.” Colin gulped and turned his face a little\nto look at her.",
        "“C-could you?” he said pathetically.",
        "“Yes, sir.”",
        "“There!” said Mary, and she gulped too.",
        "Colin turned on his face again and but for his long-drawn\nbroken breaths, which were the dying down of his storm\nof sobbing, he lay still for a minute, though great tears\nstreamed down his face and wet the pillow.  Actually the\ntears meant that a curious great relief had come to him.\nPresently he turned and looked at the nurse again and\nstrangely enough he was not like a Rajah at all as he\nspoke to her.",
        "“Do you think–I could–live to grow up?” he said.",
        "The nurse was neither clever nor soft-hearted but she\ncould repeat some of the London doctor’s words.",
        "“You probably will if you will do what you are told\nto do and not give way to your temper, and stay\nout a great deal in the fresh air.”",
        "Colin’s tantrum had passed and he was weak and worn\nout with crying and this perhaps made him feel gentle.\nHe put out his hand a little toward Mary, and I am glad\nto say that, her own tantum having passed, she was softened\ntoo and met him half-way with her hand, so that it was\na sort of making up.",
        "“I’ll–I’ll go out with you, Mary,” he said.  “I shan’t\nhate fresh air if we can find–” He remembered just\nin time to stop himself from saying “if we can find\nthe secret garden” and he ended, “I shall like to go\nout with you if Dickon will come and push my chair.\nI do so want to see Dickon and the fox and the crow.”",
        "The nurse remade the tumbled bed and shook and straightened\nthe pillows.  Then she made Colin a cup of beef tea\nand gave a cup to Mary, who really was very glad to get\nit after her excitement.  Mrs. Medlock and Martha gladly\nslipped away, and after everything was neat and calm\nand in order the nurse looked as if she would very gladly\nslip away also.  She was a healthy young woman who resented\nbeing robbed of her sleep and she yawned quite openly\nas she looked at Mary, who had pushed her big footstool\nclose to the four-posted bed and was holding Colin’s hand.",
        "“You must go back and get your sleep out,” she said.\n\"He’ll drop off after a while–if he’s not too upset.\nThen I’ll lie down myself in the next room.”",
        "“Would you like me to sing you that song I learned from\nmy Ayah?” Mary whispered to Colin.",
        "His hand pulled hers gently and he turned his tired eyes\non her appealingly.",
        "“Oh, yes!” he answered.  “It’s such a soft song.\nI shall go to sleep in a minute.”",
        "“I will put him to sleep,” Mary said to the yawning nurse.\n\"You can go if you like.”",
        "“Well,” said the nurse, with an attempt at reluctance.\n\"If he doesn’t go to sleep in half an hour you must\ncall me.”",
        "“Very well,” answered Mary.",
        "The nurse was out of the room in a minute and as soon\nas she was gone Colin pulled Mary’s hand again.",
        "“I almost told,” he said; “but I stopped myself in time.\nI won’t talk and I’ll go to sleep, but you said you had\na whole lot of nice things to tell me.  Have you–do you\nthink you have found out anything at all about the way\ninto the secret garden?”",
        "Mary looked at his poor little tired face and swollen\neyes and her heart relented.",
        "“Ye-es,” she answered, “I think I have.  And if you\nwill go to sleep I will tell you tomorrow.” His hand\nquite trembled.",
        "“Oh, Mary!” he said.  “Oh, Mary! If I could get into it\nI think I should live to grow up! Do you suppose that\ninstead of singing the Ayah song–you could just tell\nme softly as you did that first day what you imagine it\nlooks like inside? I am sure it will make me go to sleep.”",
        "“Yes,” answered Mary.  “Shut your eyes.”",
        "He closed his eyes and lay quite still and she held his\nhand and began to speak very slowly and in a very low voice.",
        "“I think it has been left alone so long–that it has grown\nall into a lovely tangle.  I think the roses have climbed and\nclimbed and climbed until they hang from the branches and walls\nand creep over the ground–almost like a strange gray mist.\nSome of them have died but many–are alive and when the\nsummer comes there will be curtains and fountains of roses.\nI think the ground is full of daffodils and snowdrops\nand lilies and iris working their way out of the dark.\nNow the spring has begun–perhaps–perhaps–”",
        "The soft drone of her voice was making him stiller\nand stiller and she saw it and went on.",
        "“Perhaps they are coming up through the grass–perhaps there\nare clusters of purple crocuses and gold ones–even now.\nPerhaps the leaves are beginning to break out and uncurl–and\nperhaps–the gray is changing and a green gauze veil is\ncreeping–and creeping over–everything. And the birds are\ncoming to look at it–because it is–so safe and still.\nAnd perhaps–perhaps–perhaps–” very softly and slowly indeed,\n\"the robin has found a mate–and is building a nest.”",
        "And Colin was asleep.",
        "Of course Mary did not waken early the next morning.\nShe slept late because she was tired, and when Martha\nbrought her breakfast she told her that though.\nColin was quite quiet he was ill and feverish as he always\nwas after he had worn himself out with a fit of crying.\nMary ate her breakfast slowly as she listened.",
        "“He says he wishes tha’ would please go and see him as soon\nas tha’ can,” Martha said.  “It’s queer what a fancy\nhe’s took to thee.  Tha’ did give it him last night for\nsure–didn’t tha? Nobody else would have dared to do it.\nEh! poor lad! He’s been spoiled till salt won’t save him.\nMother says as th’ two worst things as can happen to a\nchild is never to have his own way–or always to have it.\nShe doesn’t know which is th’ worst.  Tha’ was in a fine temper\ntha’self, too.  But he says to me when I went into his room,\n`Please ask Miss Mary if she’ll please come an, talk to me?’\nThink o’ him saying please! Will you go, Miss?” “I’ll run\nand see Dickon first,” said Mary.  “No, I’ll go and see\nColin first and tell him–I know what I’ll tell him,\"\nwith a sudden inspiration.",
        "She had her hat on when she appeared in Colin’s room\nand for a second he looked disappointed.  He was in bed.\nHis face was pitifully white and there were dark circles\nround his eyes.",
        "“I’m glad you came,” he said.  “My head aches and I ache\nall over because I’m so tired.  Are you going somewhere?”",
        "Mary went and leaned against his bed.",
        "“I won’t be long,” she said.  “I’m going to Dickon,\nbut I’ll come back.  Colin, it’s–it’s something about\nthe garden.”",
        "His whole face brightened and a little color came into it.",
        "“Oh! is it?” he cried out.  “I dreamed about it all night\nI heard you say something about gray changing into green,\nand I dreamed I was standing in a place all filled\nwith trembling little green leaves–and there were birds\non nests everywhere and they looked so soft and still.\nI’ll lie and think about it until you come back.”",
        "In five minutes Mary was with Dickon in their garden.\nThe fox and the crow were with him again and this time\nhe had brought two tame squirrels.  “I came over on the\npony this mornin’,” he said.  “Eh! he is a good little\nchap–Jump is! I brought these two in my pockets.\nThis here one he’s called Nut an’ this here other one’s\ncalled Shell.”",
        "When he said “Nut” one squirrel leaped on to his right\nshoulder and when he said “Shell” the other one leaped\non to his left shoulder.",
        "When they sat down on the grass with Captain curled at\ntheir feet, Soot solemnly listening on a tree and Nut and\nShell nosing about close to them, it seemed to Mary that it\nwould be scarcely bearable to leave such delightfulness,\nbut when she began to tell her story somehow the look\nin Dickon’s funny face gradually changed her mind.\nShe could see he felt sorrier for Colin than she did.\nHe looked up at the sky and all about him.",
        "“Just listen to them birds–th’ world seems full\nof ’em–all whistlin’ an’ pipin’,” he said.\n\"Look at ’em dartin’ about, an’ hearken at ’em callin’\nto each other.  Come springtime seems like as if all th’\nworld’s callin’. The leaves is uncurlin’ so you can see\n’em–an’, my word, th’ nice smells there is about!\"\nsniffing with his happy turned-up nose.  “An’ that poor\nlad lyin’ shut up an’ seein’ so little that he gets\nto thinkin’ o’ things as sets him screamin’. Eh! my!\nwe mun get him out here–we mun get him watchin’\nan listenin’ an’ sniffin’ up th’ air an’ get him just soaked\nthrough wi’ sunshine.  An’ we munnot lose no time about it.”",
        "When he was very much interested he often spoke quite\nbroad Yorkshire though at other times he tried to modify\nhis dialect so that Mary could better understand.\nBut she loved his broad Yorkshire and had in fact been\ntrying to learn to speak it herself.  So she spoke\na little now.",
        "“Aye, that we mun,” she said (which meant “Yes, indeed,\nwe must”). “I’ll tell thee what us’ll do first,” she proceeded,\nand Dickon grinned, because when the little wench tried\nto twist her tongue into speaking Yorkshire it amused\nhim very much.  “He’s took a graidely fancy to thee.\nHe wants to see thee and he wants to see Soot an’ Captain.\nWhen I go back to the house to talk to him I’ll ax him\nif tha’ canna’ come an’ see him tomorrow mornin’–an’.\nbring tha’ creatures wi’ thee–an’ then–in a bit,\nwhen there’s more leaves out, an’ happen a bud or two,\nwe’ll get him to come out an’ tha’ shall push him in his\nchair an’ we’ll bring him here an’ show him everything.”",
        "When she stopped she was quite proud of herself.\nShe had never made a long speech in Yorkshire before\nand she had remembered very well.",
        "“Tha’ mun talk a bit o’ Yorkshire like that to Mester Colin,\"\nDickon chuckled.  “Tha’ll make him laugh an’ there’s nowt\nas good for ill folk as laughin’ is.  Mother says she\nbelieves as half a hour’s good laugh every mornin’\n’ud cure a chap as was makin’ ready for typhus fever.”",
        "“I’m going to talk Yorkshire to him this very day,\"\nsaid Mary, chuckling herself.",
        "The garden had reached the time when every day and every night\nit seemed as if Magicians were passing through it drawing\nloveliness out of the earth and the boughs with wands.\nIt was hard to go away and leave it all, particularly as Nut\nhad actually crept on to her dress and Shell had scrambled\ndown the trunk of the apple-tree they sat under and stayed\nthere looking at her with inquiring eyes.  But she went back\nto the house and when she sat down close to Colin’s bed\nhe began to sniff as Dickon did though not in such an experienced\nway.",
        "“You smell like flowers and–and fresh things,” he cried\nout quite joyously.  “What is it you smell of? It’s cool\nand warm and sweet all at the same time.”",
        "“It’s th’ wind from th’ moor,” said Mary.  “It comes o’ sittin’\non th’ grass under a tree wi’ Dickon an’ wi’ Captain an’\nSoot an’ Nut an’ Shell.  It’s th’ springtime an’ out o’\ndoors an’ sunshine as smells so graidely.”",
        "She said it as broadly as she could, and you do not know\nhow broadly Yorkshire sounds until you have heard some\none speak it.  Colin began to laugh.",
        "“What are you doing?” he said.  “I never heard you talk\nlike that before.  How funny it sounds.”",
        "“I’m givin’ thee a bit o’ Yorkshire,” answered Mary triumphantly.\n\"I canna’ talk as graidely as Dickon an’ Martha can but tha’\nsees I can shape a bit.  Doesn’t tha’ understand a bit o’\nYorkshire when tha’ hears it? An’ tha’ a Yorkshire lad thysel’\nbred an’ born! Eh! I wonder tha’rt not ashamed o’\nthy face.”",
        "And then she began to laugh too and they both laughed until\nthey could not stop themselves and they laughed until\nthe room echoed and Mrs. Medlock opening the door to come\nin drew back into the corridor and stood listening amazed.",
        "“Well, upon my word!” she said, speaking rather broad\nYorkshire herself because there was no one to hear\nher and she was so astonished.  “Whoever heard th’\nlike! Whoever on earth would ha’ thought it!”",
        "There was so much to talk about.  It seemed as if Colin\ncould never hear enough of Dickon and Captain and Soot\nand Nut and Shell and the pony whose name was Jump.\nMary had run round into the wood with Dickon to see Jump.\nHe was a tiny little shaggy moor pony with thick locks\nhanging over his eyes and with a pretty face and a nuzzling\nvelvet nose.  He was rather thin with living on moor\ngrass but he was as tough and wiry as if the muscle\nin his little legs had been made of steel springs.\nHe had lifted his head and whinnied softly the moment\nhe saw Dickon and he had trotted up to him and put his\nhead across his shoulder and then Dickon had talked into\nhis ear and Jump had talked back in odd little whinnies\nand puffs and snorts.  Dickon had made him give Mary\nhis small front hoof and kiss her on her cheek with his\nvelvet muzzle.",
        "“Does he really understand everything Dickon says?\"\nColin asked.",
        "“It seems as if he does,” answered Mary.  “Dickon says\nanything will understand if you’re friends with it for sure,\nbut you have to be friends for sure.”",
        "Colin lay quiet a little while and his strange gray\neyes seemed to be staring at the wall, but Mary saw\nhe was thinking.",
        "“I wish I was friends with things,” he said at last,\n\"but I’m not.  I never had anything to be friends with,\nand I can’t bear people.”",
        "“Can’t you bear me?” asked Mary.",
        "“Yes, I can,” he answered.  “It’s funny but I even like you.”",
        "“Ben Weatherstaff said I was like him,” said Mary.\n\"He said he’d warrant we’d both got the same nasty tempers.\nI think you are like him too.  We are all three alike–you\nand I and Ben Weatherstaff.  He said we were neither\nof us much to look at and we were as sour as we looked.\nBut I don’t feel as sour as I used to before I knew the robin\nand Dickon.”",
        "“Did you feel as if you hated people?”",
        "“Yes,” answered Mary without any affectation.\n\"I should have detested you if I had seen you before\nI saw the robin and Dickon.”",
        "Colin put out his thin hand and touched her.",
        "“Mary,” he said, “I wish I hadn’t said what I did about\nsending Dickon away.  I hated you when you said he was\nlike an angel and I laughed at you but–but perhaps he is.”",
        "“Well, it was rather funny to say it,” she admitted frankly,\n\"because his nose does turn up and he has a big mouth\nand his clothes have patches all over them and he talks\nbroad Yorkshire, but–but if an angel did come to Yorkshire\nand live on the moor–if there was a Yorkshire angel–I\nbelieve he’d understand the green things and know how to\nmake them grow and he would know how to talk to the wild\ncreatures as Dickon does and they’d know he was friends for\nsure.”",
        "“I shouldn’t mind Dickon looking at me,” said Colin;\n\"I want to see him.”",
        "“I’m glad you said that,” answered Mary, “because–because–”",
        "Quite suddenly it came into her mind that this was the\nminute to tell him.  Colin knew something new was coming.",
        "“Because what?” he cried eagerly.",
        "Mary was so anxious that she got up from her stool\nand came to him and caught hold of both his hands.",
        "“Can I trust you? I trusted Dickon because birds trusted him.\nCan I trust you–for sure–for sure?” she implored.",
        "Her face was so solemn that he almost whispered his answer.",
        "“Yes–yes!”",
        "“Well, Dickon will come to see you tomorrow morning,\nand he’ll bring his creatures with him.”",
        "“Oh! Oh!” Colin cried out in delight.",
        "“But that’s not all,” Mary went on, almost pale with\nsolemn excitement.  “The rest is better.  There is a door\ninto the garden.  I found it.  It is under the ivy on the wall.”",
        "If he had been a strong healthy boy Colin would probably\nhave shouted “Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!” but he was weak\nand rather hysterical; his eyes grew bigger and bigger\nand he gasped for breath.",
        "“Oh! Mary!” he cried out with a half sob.  “Shall I see\nit? Shall I get into it? Shall I live to get into it?\"\nand he clutched her hands and dragged her toward him.",
        "“Of course you’ll see it!” snapped Mary indignantly.\n\"Of course you’ll live to get into it! Don’t be silly!”",
        "And she was so un-hysterical and natural and childish\nthat she brought him to his senses and he began to laugh\nat himself and a few minutes afterward she was sitting\non her stool again telling him not what she imagined\nthe secret garden to be like but what it really was,\nand Colin’s aches and tiredness were forgotten and he\nwas listening enraptured.",
        "“It is just what you thought it would be,” he said at last.\n\"It sounds just as if you had really seen it.  You know I\nsaid that when you told me first.”",
        "Mary hesitated about two minutes and then boldly spoke\nthe truth.",
        "“I had seen it–and I had been in,” she said.  “I found\nthe key and got in weeks ago.  But I daren’t tell you–I\ndaren’t because I was so afraid I couldn’t trust you–for sure!”",
        "Of course Dr. Craven had been sent for the morning after\nColin had had his tantrum.  He was always sent for at\nonce when such a thing occurred and he always found,\nwhen he arrived, a white shaken boy lying on his bed,\nsulky and still so hysterical that he was ready to break\ninto fresh sobbing at the least word.  In fact, Dr. Craven\ndreaded and detested the difficulties of these visits.\nOn this occasion he was away from Misselthwaite Manor\nuntil afternoon.",
        "“How is he?” he asked Mrs. Medlock rather irritably when he\narrived.\n\"He will break a blood-vessel in one of those fits some day.\nThe boy is half insane with hysteria and self-indulgence.”",
        "“Well, sir,” answered Mrs. Medlock, “you’ll scarcely believe\nyour eyes when you see him.  That plain sour-faced child\nthat’s almost as bad as himself has just bewitched him.\nHow she’s done it there’s no telling.  The Lord knows\nshe’s nothing to look at and you scarcely ever hear\nher speak, but she did what none of us dare do.\nShe just flew at him like a little cat last night,\nand stamped her feet and ordered him to stop screaming,\nand somehow she startled him so that he actually did stop,\nand this afternoon–well just come up and see, sir.\nIt’s past crediting.”",
        "The scene which Dr. Craven beheld when he entered his\npatient’s room was indeed rather astonishing to him.\nAs Mrs. Medlock opened the door he heard laughing\nand chattering.  Colin was on his sofa in his dressing-gown\nand he was sitting up quite straight looking at a picture\nin one of the garden books and talking to the plain\nchild who at that moment could scarcely be called plain\nat all because her face was so glowing with enjoyment.",
        "“Those long spires of blue ones–we’ll have a lot of those,\"\nColin was announcing.  “They’re called Del-phin-iums.”",
        "“Dickon says they’re larkspurs made big and grand,\"\ncried Mistress Mary.  “There are clumps there already.”",
        "Then they saw Dr. Craven and stopped.  Mary became quite\nstill and Colin looked fretful.",
        "“I am sorry to hear you were ill last night, my boy,\"\nDr. Craven said a trifle nervously.  He was rather a\nnervous man.",
        "“I’m better now–much better,” Colin answered,\nrather like a Rajah.  “I’m going out in my chair\nin a day or two if it is fine.  I want some fresh air.”",
        "Dr. Craven sat down by him and felt his pulse and looked\nat him curiously.",
        "“It must be a very fine day,” he said, “and you must\nbe very careful not to tire yourself.”",
        "“Fresh air won’t tire me,” said the young Rajah.",
        "As there had been occasions when this same young gentleman\nhad shrieked aloud with rage and had insisted that fresh\nair would give him cold and kill him, it is not to be\nwondered at that his doctor felt somewhat startled.",
        "“I thought you did not like fresh air,” he said.",
        "“I don’t when I am by myself,” replied the Rajah;\n\"but my cousin is going out with me.”",
        "“And the nurse, of course?” suggested Dr. Craven.",
        "“No, I will not have the nurse,” so magnificently that Mary\ncould not help remembering how the young native Prince\nhad looked with his diamonds and emeralds and pearls\nstuck all over him and the great rubies on the small dark\nhand he had waved to command his servants to approach\nwith salaams and receive his orders.",
        "“My cousin knows how to take care of me.  I am always better\nwhen she is with me.  She made me better last night.\nA very strong boy I know will push my carriage.”",
        "Dr. Craven felt rather alarmed.  If this tiresome\nhysterical boy should chance to get well he himself would\nlose all chance of inheriting Misselthwaite; but he\nwas not an unscrupulous man, though he was a weak one,\nand he did not intend to let him run into actual danger.",
        "“He must be a strong boy and a steady boy,” he said.\n\"And I must know something about him.  Who is he? What is\nhis name?”",
        "“It’s Dickon,” Mary spoke up suddenly.  She felt somehow\nthat everybody who knew the moor must know Dickon.\nAnd she was right, too.  She saw that in a moment\nDr. Craven’s serious face relaxed into a relieved smile.",
        "“Oh, Dickon,” he said.  “If it is Dickon you will be\nsafe enough.  He’s as strong as a moor pony, is Dickon.”",
        "“And he’s trusty,” said Mary.  “He’s th’ trustiest lad i’\nYorkshire.” She had been talking Yorkshire to Colin\nand she forgot herself.",
        "“Did Dickon teach you that?” asked Dr. Craven,\nlaughing outright.",
        "“I’m learning it as if it was French,” said Mary rather coldly.\n\"It’s like a native dialect in India.  Very clever\npeople try to learn them.  I like it and so does Colin.\"\n\"Well, well,” he said.  “If it amuses you perhaps it won’t\ndo you any harm.  Did you take your bromide last night, Colin?”",
        "“No,” Colin answered.  “I wouldn’t take it at first\nand after Mary made me quiet she talked me to sleep–in\na low voice–about the spring creeping into a garden.”",
        "“That sounds soothing,” said Dr. Craven, more perplexed\nthan ever and glancing sideways at Mistress Mary sitting\non her stool and looking down silently at the carpet.\n\"You are evidently better, but you must remember–”",
        "“I don’t want to remember,” interrupted the Rajah,\nappearing again.  “When I lie by myself and remember I\nbegin to have pains everywhere and I think of things\nthat make me begin to scream because I hate them so.\nIf there was a doctor anywhere who could make you forget\nyou were ill instead of remembering it I would have him\nbrought here.” And he waved a thin hand which ought really\nto have been covered with royal signet rings made of rubies.\n\"It is because my cousin makes me forget that she makes\nme better.”",
        "Dr. Craven had never made such a short stay after a\n\"tantrum\"; usually he was obliged to remain a very long\ntime and do a great many things.  This afternoon he did\nnot give any medicine or leave any new orders and he was\nspared any disagreeable scenes.  When he went downstairs he\nlooked very thoughtful and when he talked to Mrs. Medlock\nin the library she felt that he was a much puzzled man.",
        "“Well, sir,” she ventured, “could you have believed it?”",
        "“It is certainly a new state of affairs,” said the doctor.\n\"And there’s no denying it is better than the old one.”",
        "“I believe Susan Sowerby’s right–I do that,” said Mrs. Medlock.\n\"I stopped in her cottage on my way to Thwaite yesterday\nand had a bit of talk with her.  And she says to me,\n’Well, Sarah Ann, she mayn’t be a good child, an’ she mayn’t\nbe a pretty one, but she’s a child, an’ children needs\nchildren.’ We went to school together, Susan Sowerby and me.”",
        "“She’s the best sick nurse I know,” said Dr. Craven.\n\"When I find her in a cottage I know the chances are that I\nshall save my patient.”",
        "Mrs. Medlock smiled.  She was fond of Susan Sowerby.",
        "“She’s got a way with her, has Susan,” she went on\nquite volubly.  “I’ve been thinking all morning of one\nthing she said yesterday.  She says, `Once when I\nwas givin’ th’ children a bit of a preach after they’d\nbeen fightin’ I ses to ’em all, “When I was at school my\njography told as th’ world was shaped like a orange an’\nI found out before I was ten that th’ whole orange\ndoesn’t belong to nobody.  No one owns more than his bit\nof a quarter an’ there’s times it seems like there’s\nnot enow quarters to go round.  But don’t you–none o’\nyou–think as you own th’ whole orange or you’ll find\nout you’re mistaken, an’ you won’t find it out without\nhard knocks.” `What children learns from children,’\nshe says, ’is that there’s no sense in grabbin’ at th’\nwhole orange–peel an’ all.  If you do you’ll likely\nnot get even th’ pips, an’ them’s too bitter to eat.’”",
        "“She’s a shrewd woman,” said Dr. Craven, putting on his coat.",
        "“Well, she’s got a way of saying things,” ended Mrs. Medlock,\nmuch pleased.  “Sometimes I’ve said to her, ’Eh! Susan,\nif you was a different woman an’ didn’t talk such broad\nYorkshire I’ve seen the times when I should have said you\nwas clever.’”",
        "That night Colin slept without once awakening and\nwhen he opened his eyes in the morning he lay still\nand smiled without knowing it–smiled because he felt so\ncuriously comfortable.  It was actually nice to be awake,\nand he turned over and stretched his limbs luxuriously.\nHe felt as if tight strings which had held him had\nloosened themselves and let him go.  He did not know that\nDr. Craven would have said that his nerves had relaxed\nand rested themselves.  Instead of lying and staring at\nthe wall and wishing he had not awakened, his mind was full\nof the plans he and Mary had made yesterday, of pictures\nof the garden and of Dickon and his wild creatures.\nIt was so nice to have things to think about.  And he\nhad not been awake more than ten minutes when he heard\nfeet running along the corridor and Mary was at the door.\nThe next minute she was in the room and had run across\nto his bed, bringing with her a waft of fresh air full\nof the scent of the morning.",
        "“You’ve been out! You’ve been out! There’s that nice\nsmell of leaves!” he cried.",
        "She had been running and her hair was loose and blown\nand she was bright with the air and pink-cheeked, though\nhe could not see it.",
        "“It’s so beautiful!” she said, a little breathless\nwith her speed.  “You never saw anything so beautiful!\nIt has come! I thought it had come that other morning,\nbut it was only coming.  It is here now! It has come,\nthe Spring! Dickon says so!”",
        "“Has it?” cried Colin, and though he really knew nothing\nabout it he felt his heart beat.  He actually sat up\nin bed.",
        "“Open the window!” he added, laughing half with joyful\nexcitement and half at his own fancy.  “Perhaps we may\nhear golden trumpets!”",
        "And though he laughed, Mary was at the window in a moment\nand in a moment more it was opened wide and freshness and\nsoftness and scents and birds’ songs were pouring through.",
        "“That’s fresh air,” she said.  “Lie on your back and draw\nin long breaths of it.  That’s what Dickon does when he’s\nlying on the moor.  He says he feels it in his veins\nand it makes him strong and he feels as if he could\nlive forever and ever.  Breathe it and breathe it.”",
        "She was only repeating what Dickon had told her, but she\ncaught Colin’s fancy.",
        "“`Forever and ever’! Does it make him feel like that?\"\nhe said, and he did as she told him, drawing in long deep\nbreaths over and over again until he felt that something\nquite new and delightful was happening to him.",
        "Mary was at his bedside again.",
        "“Things are crowding up out of the earth,” she ran on\nin a hurry.  “And there are flowers uncurling and buds\non everything and the green veil has covered nearly all\nthe gray and the birds are in such a hurry about their\nnests for fear they may be too late that some of them\nare even fighting for places in the secret garden.\nAnd the rose-bushes look as wick as wick can be,\nand there are primroses in the lanes and woods,\nand the seeds we planted are up, and Dickon has brought\nthe fox and the crow and the squirrels and a new-born lamb.”",
        "And then she paused for breath.  The new-born lamb Dickon\nhad found three days before lying by its dead mother\namong the gorse bushes on the moor.  It was not the first\nmotherless lamb he had found and he knew what to do with it.\nHe had taken it to the cottage wrapped in his jacket and he\nhad let it lie near the fire and had fed it with warm milk.\nIt was a soft thing with a darling silly baby face\nand legs rather long for its body.  Dickon had carried\nit over the moor in his arms and its feeding bottle\nwas in his pocket with a squirrel, and when Mary had sat\nunder a tree with its limp warmness huddled on her lap she\nhad felt as if she were too full of strange joy to speak.\nA lamb–a lamb! A living lamb who lay on your lap like a baby!",
        "She was describing it with great joy and Colin was listening\nand drawing in long breaths of air when the nurse entered.\nShe started a little at the sight of the open window.\nShe had sat stifling in the room many a warm day because her\npatient was sure that open windows gave people cold.",
        "“Are you sure you are not chilly, Master Colin?\"\nshe inquired.",
        "“No,” was the answer.  “I am breathing long breaths\nof fresh air.  It makes you strong.  I am going to get up\nto the sofa for breakfast.  My cousin will have breakfast\nwith me.”",
        "The nurse went away, concealing a smile, to give\nthe order for two breakfasts.  She found the servants’\nhall a more amusing place than the invalid’s chamber and\njust now everybody wanted to hear the news from upstairs.\nThere was a great deal of joking about the unpopular young\nrecluse who, as the cook said, “had found his master,\nand good for him.” The servants’ hall had been very tired\nof the tantrums, and the butler, who was a man with a family,\nhad more than once expressed his opinion that the invalid\nwould be all the better “for a good hiding.”",
        "When Colin was on his sofa and the breakfast for two was\nput upon the table he made an announcement to the nurse\nin his most Rajah-like manner.",
        "“A boy, and a fox, and a crow, and two squirrels,\nand a new-born lamb, are coming to see me this morning.\nI want them brought upstairs as soon as they come,\"\nhe said.  “You are not to begin playing with the animals\nin the servants’ hall and keep them there.  I want them here.\"\nThe nurse gave a slight gasp and tried to conceal it with\na cough.",
        "“Yes, sir,” she answered.",
        "“I’ll tell you what you can do,” added Colin, waving\nhis hand.  “You can tell Martha to bring them here.\nThe boy is Martha’s brother.  His name is Dickon and he\nis an animal charmer.”",
        "“I hope the animals won’t bite, Master Colin,” said the nurse.",
        "“I told you he was a charmer,” said Colin austerely.\n\"Charmers’ animals never bite.”",
        "“There are snake-charmers in India,” said Mary.\n\"and they can put their snakes’ heads in their mouths.”",
        "“Goodness!” shuddered the nurse.",
        "They ate their breakfast with the morning air pouring\nin upon them.  Colin’s breakfast was a very good one\nand Mary watched him with serious interest.",
        "“You will begin to get fatter just as I did,” she said.\n\"I never wanted my breakfast when I was in India and now I\nalways want it.”",
        "“I wanted mine this morning,” said Colin.  “Perhaps it\nwas the fresh air.  When do you think Dickon will come?”",
        "He was not long in coming.  In about ten minutes Mary\nheld up her hand.",
        "“Listen!” she said.  “Did you hear a caw?”",
        "Colin listened and heard it, the oddest sound in the world\nto hear inside a house, a hoarse “caw-caw.”",
        "“Yes,” he answered.",
        "“That’s Soot,” said Mary.  “Listen again.  Do you hear\na bleat–a tiny one?”",
        "“Oh, yes!” cried Colin, quite flushing.",
        "“That’s the new-born lamb,” said Mary.  “He’s coming.”",
        "Dickon’s moorland boots were thick and clumsy and though\nhe tried to walk quietly they made a clumping sound as he\nwalked through the long corridors.  Mary and Colin heard him\nmarching–marching, until he passed through the tapestry\ndoor on to the soft carpet of Colin’s own passage.",
        "“If you please, sir,” announced Martha, opening the door,\n\"if you please, sir, here’s Dickon an’ his creatures.”",
        "Dickon came in smiling his nicest wide smile.\nThe new-born lamb was in his arms and the little red\nfox trotted by his side.  Nut sat on his left shoulder\nand Soot on his right and Shell’s head and paws peeped\nout of his coat pocket.",
        "Colin slowly sat up and stared and stared–as he had stared\nwhen he first saw Mary; but this was a stare of wonder\nand delight.  The truth was that in spite of all he had\nheard he had not in the least understood what this boy would\nbe like and that his fox and his crow and his squirrels\nand his lamb were so near to him and his friendliness\nthat they seemed almost to be part of himself.  Colin had\nnever talked to a boy in his life and he was so overwhelmed\nby his own pleasure and curiosity that he did not even think of\nspeaking.",
        "But Dickon did not feel the least shy or awkward.\nHe had not felt embarrassed because the crow had not\nknown his language and had only stared and had not\nspoken to him the first time they met.  Creatures were\nalways like that until they found out about you.\nHe walked over to Colin’s sofa and put the new-born\nlamb quietly on his lap, and immediately the little\ncreature turned to the warm velvet dressing-gown and\nbegan to nuzzle and nuzzle into its folds and butt its\ntight-curled head with soft impatience against his side.\nOf course no boy could have helped speaking then.",
        "“What is it doing?” cried Colin.  “What does it want?”",
        "“It wants its mother,” said Dickon, smiling more and more.\n\"I brought it to thee a bit hungry because I knowed tha’d\nlike to see it feed.”",
        "He knelt down by the sofa and took a feeding-bottle\nfrom his pocket.",
        "“Come on, little ’un,” he said, turning the small\nwoolly white head with a gentle brown hand.  “This is\nwhat tha’s after.  Tha’ll get more out o’ this than tha’\nwill out o’ silk velvet coats.  There now,” and he pushed\nthe rubber tip of the bottle into the nuzzling mouth\nand the lamb began to suck it with ravenous ecstasy.",
        "After that there was no wondering what to say.\nBy the time the lamb fell asleep questions poured forth\nand Dickon answered them all.  He told them how he had found\nthe lamb just as the sun was rising three mornings ago.\nHe had been standing on the moor listening to a skylark\nand watching him swing higher and higher into the sky\nuntil he was only a speck in the heights of blue.",
        "“I’d almost lost him but for his song an’ I was wonderin’\nhow a chap could hear it when it seemed as if he’d\nget out o’ th’ world in a minute–an’ just then I\nheard somethin’ else far off among th’ gorse bushes.\nIt was a weak bleatin’ an’ I knowed it was a new lamb\nas was hungry an’ I knowed it wouldn’t be hungry if it\nhadn’t lost its mother somehow, so I set off searchin’.\nEh! I did have a look for it.  I went in an’ out among th’\ngorse bushes an’ round an’ round an’ I always seemed\nto take th’ wrong turnin’. But at last I seed a bit o’\nwhite by a rock on top o’ th’ moor an’ I climbed up an’\nfound th’ little ’un half dead wi’ cold an’ clemmin’.\"\nWhile he talked, Soot flew solemnly in and out of the open\nwindow and cawed remarks about the scenery while Nut\nand Shell made excursions into the big trees outside\nand ran up and down trunks and explored branches.\nCaptain curled up near Dickon, who sat on the hearth-rug\nfrom preference.",
        "They looked at the pictures in the gardening books and\nDickon knew all the flowers by their country names and knew\nexactly which ones were already growing in the secret garden.",
        "“I couldna’ say that there name,” he said, pointing to one\nunder which was written “Aquilegia,” “but us calls that\na columbine, an’ that there one it’s a snapdragon and they\nboth grow wild in hedges, but these is garden ones an’\nthey’re bigger an’ grander.  There’s some big clumps o’\ncolumbine in th’ garden.  They’ll look like a bed o’ blue an’\nwhite butterflies flutterin’ when they’re out.”",
        "“I’m going to see them,” cried Colin.  “I am going\nto see them!”",
        "“Aye, that tha’ mun,” said Mary quite seriously.  “An’ tha’\nmunnot lose no time about it.”",
        "But they were obliged to wait more than a week because\nfirst there came some very windy days and then Colin\nwas threatened with a cold, which two things happening\none after the other would no doubt have thrown him into\na rage but that there was so much careful and mysterious\nplanning to do and almost every day Dickon came in,\nif only for a few minutes, to talk about what was happening\non the moor and in the lanes and hedges and on the borders\nof streams.  The things he had to tell about otters’\nand badgers’ and water-rats’ houses, not to mention birds’\nnests and field-mice and their burrows, were enough\nto make you almost tremble with excitement when you\nheard all the intimate details from an animal charmer\nand realized with what thrilling eagerness and anxiety\nthe whole busy underworld was working.",
        "“They’re same as us,” said Dickon, “only they have to\nbuild their homes every year.  An’ it keeps ’em so busy\nthey fair scuffle to get ’em done.”",
        "The most absorbing thing, however, was the preparations\nto be made before Colin could be transported with sufficient\nsecrecy to the garden.  No one must see the chair-carriage\nand Dickon and Mary after they turned a certain corner\nof the shrubbery and entered upon the walk outside\nthe ivied walls.  As each day passed, Colin had become\nmore and more fixed in his feeling that the mystery\nsurrounding the garden was one of its greatest charms.\nNothing must spoil that.  No one must ever suspect\nthat they had a secret.  People must think that he\nwas simply going out with Mary and Dickon because he\nliked them and did not object to their looking at him.\nThey had long and quite delightful talks about their route.\nThey would go up this path and down that one and cross\nthe other and go round among the fountain flower-beds\nas if they were looking at the “bedding-out plants\"\nthe head gardener, Mr. Roach, had been having arranged.\nThat would seem such a rational thing to do that no one\nwould think it at all mysterious.  They would turn into\nthe shrubbery walks and lose themselves until they came\nto the long walls.  It was almost as serious and elaborately\nthought out as the plans of march made by geat generals\nin time of war.",
        "Rumors of the new and curious things which were occurring\nin the invalid’s apartments had of course filtered\nthrough the servants’ hall into the stable yards\nand out among the gardeners, but notwithstanding this,\nMr. Roach was startled one day when he received orders\nfrom Master Colin’s room to the effect that he must report\nhimself in the apartment no outsider had ever seen,\nas the invalid himself desired to speak to him.",
        "“Well, well,” he said to himself as he hurriedly changed\nhis coat, “what’s to do now? His Royal Highness that wasn’t\nto be looked at calling up a man he’s never set eyes on.”",
        "Mr. Roach was not without curiosity.  He had never\ncaught even a glimpse of the boy and had heard a dozen\nexaggerated stories about his uncanny looks and ways\nand his insane tempers.  The thing he had heard\noftenest was that he might die at any moment and there\nhad been numerous fanciful descriptions of a humped\nback and helpless limbs, given by people who had never seen him.",
        "“Things are changing in this house, Mr. Roach,\"\nsaid Mrs. Medlock, as she led him up the back staircase\nto the corridor on to which opened the hitherto mysterious\nchamber.",
        "“Let’s hope they’re changing for the better, Mrs. Medlock,\"\nhe answered.",
        "“They couldn’t well change for the worse,” she continued;\n\"and queer as it all is there’s them as finds their\nduties made a lot easier to stand up under.  Don’t you\nbe surprised, Mr. Roach, if you find yourself in the middle\nof a menagerie and Martha Sowerby’s Dickon more at home\nthan you or me could ever be.”",
        "There really was a sort of Magic about Dickon, as Mary\nalways privately believed.  When Mr. Roach heard his name\nhe smiled quite leniently.",
        "“He’d be at home in Buckingham Palace or at the bottom\nof a coal mine,” he said.  “And yet it’s not impudence,\neither.  He’s just fine, is that lad.”",
        "It was perhaps well he had been prepared or he might\nhave been startled.  When the bedroom door was opened\na large crow, which seemed quite at home perched on\nthe high back of a carven chair, announced the entrance\nof a visitor by saying “Caw–Caw” quite loudly.\nIn spite of Mrs. Medlock’s warning, Mr. Roach only just\nescaped being sufficiently undignified to jump backward.",
        "The young Rajah was neither in bed nor on his sofa.\nHe was sitting in an armchair and a young lamb was standing\nby him shaking its tail in feeding-lamb fashion as Dickon\nknelt giving it milk from its bottle.  A squirrel was\nperched on Dickon’s bent back attentively nibbling a nut.\nThe little girl from India was sitting on a big footstool\nlooking on.",
        "“Here is Mr. Roach, Master Colin,” said Mrs. Medlock.",
        "The young Rajah turned and looked his servitor over–at\nleast that was what the head gardener felt happened.",
        "“Oh, you are Roach, are you?” he said.  “I sent for you\nto give you some very important orders.”",
        "“Very good, sir,” answered Roach, wondering if he was\nto receive instructions to fell all the oaks in the park\nor to transform the orchards into water-gardens.",
        "“I am going out in my chair this afternoon,” said Colin.\n\"If the fresh air agrees with me I may go out every day.\nWhen I go, none of the gardeners are to be anywhere near\nthe Long Walk by the garden walls.  No one is to be there.\nI shall go out about two o’clock and everyone must\nkeep away until I send word that they may go back to\ntheir work.”",
        "“Very good, sir,” replied Mr. Roach, much relieved to hear\nthat the oaks might remain and that the orchards were safe.\n\"Mary,” said Colin, turning to her, “what is that thing\nyou say in India when you have finished talking and want\npeople to go?”",
        "“You say, `You have my permission to go,’” answered Mary.",
        "The Rajah waved his hand.",
        "“You have my permission to go, Roach,” he said.\n\"But, remember, this is very important.”",
        "“Caw–Caw!” remarked the crow hoarsely but not impolitely.",
        "“Very good, sir.  Thank you, sir,” said Mr. Roach,\nand Mrs. Medlock took him out of the room.",
        "Outside in the corridor, being a rather good-natured man,\nhe smiled until he almost laughed.",
        "“My word!” he said, “he’s got a fine lordly way with him,\nhasn’t he? You’d think he was a whole Royal Family rolled\ninto one–Prince Consort and all.”.",
        "“Eh!” protested Mrs. Medlock, “we’ve had to let him\ntrample all over every one of us ever since he had feet\nand he thinks that’s what folks was born for.”",
        "“Perhaps he’ll grow out of it, if he lives,” suggested Mr. Roach.",
        "“Well, there’s one thing pretty sure,” said Mrs. Medlock.\n\"If he does live and that Indian child stays here I’ll\nwarrant she teaches him that the whole orange does not\nbelong to him, as Susan Sowerby says.  And he’ll be likely\nto find out the size of his own quarter.”",
        "Inside the room Colin was leaning back on his cushions.",
        "“It’s all safe now,” he said.  “And this afternoon I\nshall see it–this afternoon I shall be in it!”",
        "Dickon went back to the garden with his creatures and Mary\nstayed with Colin.  She did not think he looked tired\nbut he was very quiet before their lunch came and he\nwas quiet while they were eating it.  She wondered why\nand asked him about it.",
        "“What big eyes you’ve got, Colin,” she said.  “When you\nare thinking they get as big as saucers.  What are you\nthinking about now?”",
        "“I can’t help thinking about what it will look like,\"\nhe answered.",
        "“The garden?” asked Mary.",
        "“The springtime,” he said.  “I was thinking that I’ve really\nnever seen it before.  I scarcely ever went out and when I\ndid go I never looked at it.  I didn’t even think about it.”",
        "“I never saw it in India because there wasn’t any,\"\nsaid Mary.",
        "Shut in and morbid as his life had been, Colin had more\nimagination than she had and at least he had spent a good\ndeal of time looking at wonderful books and pictures.",
        "“That morning when you ran in and said `It’s come! It’s\ncome!, you made me feel quite queer.  It sounded as if\nthings were coming with a great procession and big bursts\nand wafts of music.  I’ve a picture like it in one of my\nbooks–crowds of lovely people and children with garlands\nand branches with blossoms on them, everyone laughing\nand dancing and crowding and playing on pipes.  That was\nwhy I said, `Perhaps we shall hear golden trumpets’\nand told you to throw open the window.”",
        "“How funny!” said Mary.  “That’s really just what it\nfeels like.  And if all the flowers and leaves and green\nthings and birds and wild creatures danced past at once,\nwhat a crowd it would be! I’m sure they’d dance and sing\nand flute and that would be the wafts of music.”",
        "They both laughed but it was not because the idea was\nlaughable but because they both so liked it.",
        "A little later the nurse made Colin ready.  She noticed\nthat instead of lying like a log while his clothes were\nput on he sat up and made some efforts to help himself,\nand he talked and laughed with Mary all the time.",
        "“This is one of his good days, sir,” she said to Dr. Craven,\nwho dropped in to inspect him.  “He’s in such good spirits\nthat it makes him stronger.”",
        "“I’ll call in again later in the afternoon, after he has\ncome in,” said Dr. Craven.  “I must see how the going\nout agrees with him.  I wish,” in a very low voice,\n\"that he would let you go with him.”",
        "“I’d rather give up the case this moment, sir, than even\nstay here while it’s suggested,” answered the nurse.\nWith sudden firmness.",
        "“I hadn’t really decided to suggest it,” said the doctor,\nwith his slight nervousness.  “We’ll try the experiment.\nDickon’s a lad I’d trust with a new-born child.”",
        "The strongest footman in the house carried Colin down\nstairs and put him in his wheeled chair near which Dickon\nwaited outside.  After the manservant had arranged\nhis rugs and cushions the Rajah waved his hand to him\nand to the nurse.",
        "“You have my permission to go,” he said, and they both\ndisappeared quickly and it must be confessed giggled\nwhen they were safely inside the house.",
        "Dickon began to push the wheeled chair slowly and steadily.\nMistress Mary walked beside it and Colin leaned back\nand lifted his face to the sky.  The arch of it looked\nvery high and the small snowy clouds seemed like white birds\nfloating on outspread wings below its crystal blueness.\nThe wind swept in soft big breaths down from the moor\nand was strange with a wild clear scented sweetness.\nColin kept lifting his thin chest to draw it in,\nand his big eyes looked as if it were they which were\nlistening–listening, instead of his ears.",
        "“There are so many sounds of singing and humming and\ncalling out,” he said.  “What is that scent the puffs\nof wind bring?”",
        "“It’s gorse on th’ moor that’s openin’ out,” answered Dickon.\n\"Eh! th’ bees are at it wonderful today.”",
        "Not a human creature was to be caught sight of in the\npaths they took.  In fact every gardener or gardener’s\nlad had been witched away.  But they wound in and out\namong the shrubbery and out and round the fountain beds,\nfollowing their carefully planned route for the mere\nmysterious pleasure of it.  But when at last they turned\ninto the Long Walk by the ivied walls the excited sense\nof an approaching thrill made them, for some curious reason\nthey could not have explained, begin to speak in whispers.",
        "“This is it,” breathed Mary.  “This is where I used\nto walk up and down and wonder and wonder.” “Is it?\"\ncried Colin, and his eyes began to search the ivy with\neager curiousness.  “But I can see nothing,” he whispered.\n\"There is no door.”",
        "“That’s what I thought,” said Mary.",
        "Then there was a lovely breathless silence and the chair\nwheeled on.",
        "“That is the garden where Ben Weatherstaff works,\"\nsaid Mary.",
        "“Is it?” said Colin.",
        "A few yards more and Mary whispered again.",
        "“This is where the robin flew over the wall,” she said.",
        "“Is it?” cried Colin.  “Oh! I wish he’d come again!”",
        "“And that,” said Mary with solemn delight, pointing under\na big lilac bush, “is where he perched on the little\nheap of earth and showed me the key.”",
        "Then Colin sat up.",
        "“Where? Where? There?” he cried, and his eyes were as big\nas the wolf’s in Red Riding-Hood, when Red Riding-Hood\nfelt called upon to remark on them.  Dickon stood still\nand the wheeled chair stopped.",
        "“And this,” said Mary, stepping on to the bed close to the ivy,\n\"is where I went to talk to him when he chirped at me\nfrom the top of the wall.  And this is the ivy the wind\nblew back,” and she took hold of the hanging green curtain.",
        "“Oh! is it–is it!” gasped Colin.",
        "“And here is the handle, and here is the door.\nDickon push him in–push him in quickly!”",
        "And Dickon did it with one strong, steady, splendid push.",
        "But Colin had actually dropped back against his cushions,\neven though he gasped with delight, and he had covered\nhis eyes with his hands and held them there shutting\nout everything until they were inside and the chair\nstopped as if by magic and the door was closed.\nNot till then did he take them away and look round\nand round and round as Dickon and Mary had done.\nAnd over walls and earth and trees and swinging sprays\nand tendrils the fair green veil of tender little leaves\nhad crept, and in the grass under the trees and the gray\nurns in the alcoves and here and there everywhere\nwere touches or splashes of gold and purple and white\nand the trees were showing pink and snow above his head\nand there were fluttering of wings and faint sweet pipes\nand humming and scents and scents.  And the sun fell\nwarm upon his face like a hand with a lovely touch.\nAnd in wonder Mary and Dickon stood and stared at him.\nHe looked so strange and different because a pink glow\nof color had actually crept all over him–ivory face\nand neck and hands and all.",
        "“I shall get well! I shall get well!” he cried out.\n\"Mary! Dickon! I shall get well! And I shall live forever\nand ever and ever!”",
        "One of the strange things about living in the world is\nthat it is only now and then one is quite sure one is\ngoing to live forever and ever and ever.  One knows it\nsometimes when one gets up at the tender solemn dawn-time\nand goes out and stands alone and throws one’s head far\nback and looks up and up and watches the pale sky slowly\nchanging and flushing and marvelous unknown things happening\nuntil the East almost makes one cry out and one’s heart\nstands still at the strange unchanging majesty of the\nrising of the sun–which has been happening every morning\nfor thousands and thousands and thousands of years.\nOne knows it then for a moment or so.  And one knows it\nsometimes when one stands by oneself in a wood at sunset\nand the mysterious deep gold stillness slanting through and\nunder the branches seems to be saying slowly again and again\nsomething one cannot quite hear, however much one tries.\nThen sometimes the immense quiet of the dark blue at night\nwith millions of stars waiting and watching makes one sure;\nand sometimes a sound of far-off music makes it true;\nand sometimes a look in some one’s eyes.",
        "And it was like that with Colin when he first saw and\nheard and felt the Springtime inside the four high walls\nof a hidden garden.  That afternoon the whole world\nseemed to devote itself to being perfect and radiantly\nbeautiful and kind to one boy.  Perhaps out of pure\nheavenly goodness the spring came and crowned everything\nit possibly could into that one place.  More than once\nDickon paused in what he was doing and stood still with\na sort of growing wonder in his eyes, shaking his head softly.",
        "“Eh! it is graidely,” he said.  “I’m twelve goin’\non thirteen an’ there’s a lot o’ afternoons in thirteen years,\nbut seems to me like I never seed one as graidely as this\n’ere.”",
        "“Aye, it is a graidely one,” said Mary, and she sighed\nfor mere joy.  “I’ll warrant it’s the graidelest one\nas ever was in this world.”",
        "“Does tha’ think,” said Colin with dreamy carefulness,\n\"as happen it was made loike this ’ere all o’ purpose for me?”",
        "“My word!” cried Mary admiringly, “that there is a bit o’\ngood Yorkshire.  Tha’rt shapin’ first-rate–that tha’ art.”",
        "And delight reigned.  They drew the chair under the plum-tree,\nwhich was snow-white with blossoms and musical with bees.\nIt was like a king’s canopy, a fairy king’s. There were\nflowering cherry-trees near and apple-trees whose buds\nwere pink and white, and here and there one had burst\nopen wide.  Between the blossoming branches of the canopy\nbits of blue sky looked down like wonderful eyes.",
        "Mary and Dickon worked a litle here and there and Colin\nwatched them.  They brought him things to look at–buds\nwhich were opening, buds which were tight closed,\nbits of twig whose leaves were just showing green,\nthe feather of a woodpecker which had dropped on\nthe grass, the empty shell of some bird early hatched.\nDickon pushed the chair slowly round and round the garden,\nstopping every other moment to let him look at wonders\nspringing out of the earth or trailing down from trees.\nIt was like being taken in state round the country of a\nmagic king and queen and shown all the mysterious riches\nit contained.",
        "“I wonder if we shall see the robin?” said Colin.",
        "“Tha’ll see him often enow after a bit,” answered Dickon.\n\"When th’ eggs hatches out th’ little chap he’ll be kep’\nso busy it’ll make his head swim.  Tha’ll see him flyin’\nbackward an’ for’ard carryin’ worms nigh as big as himsel’\nan’ that much noise goin’ on in th’ nest when he gets\nthere as fair flusters him so as he scarce knows which big\nmouth to drop th’ first piece in.  An’ gapin’ beaks an’\nsquawks on every side.  Mother says as when she sees th’\nwork a robin has to keep them gapin’ beaks filled,\nshe feels like she was a lady with nothin’ to do.\nShe says she’s seen th’ little chaps when it seemed like th’\nsweat must be droppin’ off ’em, though folk can’t see it.”",
        "This made them giggle so delightedly that they were obliged\nto cover their mouths with their hands, remembering that\nthey must not be heard.  Colin had been instructed as to\nthe law of whispers and low voices several days before.\nHe liked the mysteriousness of it and did his best,\nbut in the midst of excited enjoyment it is rather\ndifficult never to laugh above a whisper.",
        "Every moment of the afternoon was full of new things\nand every hour the sunshine grew more golden.  The wheeled\nchair had been drawn back under the canopy and Dickon\nhad sat down on the grass and had just drawn out his pipe\nwhen Colin saw something he had not had time to notice before.",
        "“That’s a very old tree over there, isn’t it?” he said.\nDickon looked across the grass at the tree and Mary looked\nand there was a brief moment of stillness.",
        "“Yes,” answered Dickon, after it, and his low voice\nhad a very gentle sound.",
        "Mary gazed at the tree and thought.",
        "“The branches are quite gray and there’s not a single\nleaf anywhere,” Colin went on.  “It’s quite dead,\nisn’t it?”",
        "“Aye,” admitted Dickon.  “But them roses as has climbed\nall over it will near hide every bit o’ th’ dead wood\nwhen they’re full o’ leaves an’ flowers.  It won’t look\ndead then.  It’ll be th’ prettiest of all.”",
        "Mary still gazed at the tree and thought.",
        "“It looks as if a big branch had been broken off,\"\nsaid Colin.  “I wonder how it was done.”",
        "“It’s been done many a year,” answered Dickon.  “Eh!” with\na sudden relieved start and laying his hand on Colin.\n\"Look at that robin! There he is! He’s been foragin’\nfor his mate.”",
        "Colin was almost too late but he just caught sight of him,\nthe flash of red-breasted bird with something in his beak.\nHe darted through the greenness and into the close-grown\ncorner and was out of sight.  Colin leaned back on his\ncushion again, laughing a little.  “He’s taking her tea\nto her.  Perhaps it’s five o’clock. I think I’d like some\ntea myself.”",
        "And so they were safe.",
        "“It was Magic which sent the robin,” said Mary secretly\nto Dickon afterward.  “I know it was Magic.” For both she\nand Dickon had been afraid Colin might ask something\nabout the tree whose branch had broken off ten years\nago and they had talked it over together and Dickon\nhad stood and rubbed his head in a troubled way.",
        "“We mun look as if it wasn’t no different from th’\nother trees,” he had said.  “We couldn’t never tell him\nhow it broke, poor lad.  If he says anything about it we\nmun–we mun try to look cheerful.”",
        "“Aye, that we mun,” had answered Mary.",
        "But she had not felt as if she looked cheerful when she gazed\nat the tree.  She wondered and wondered in those few moments\nif there was any reality in that other thing Dickon had said.\nHe had gone on rubbing his rust-red hair in a puzzled way,\nbut a nice comforted look had begun to grow in his blue eyes.",
        "“Mrs. Craven was a very lovely young lady,” he had\ngone on rather hesitatingly.  “An’ mother she thinks\nmaybe she’s about Misselthwaite many a time lookin’\nafter Mester Colin, same as all mothers do when they’re\ntook out o’ th’ world.  They have to come back,\ntha’ sees.  Happen she’s been in the garden an’\nhappen it was her set us to work, an’ told us to bring him here.”",
        "Mary had thought he meant something about Magic.\nShe was a great believer in Magic.  Secretly she quite\nbelieved that Dickon worked Magic, of course good Magic,\non everything near him and that was why people liked him\nso much and wild creatures knew he was their friend.\nShe wondered, indeed, if it were not possible that his\ngift had brought the robin just at the right moment\nwhen Colin asked that dangerous question.  She felt\nthat his Magic was working all the afternoon and making\nColin look like an entirely different boy.  It did not\nseem possible that he could be the crazy creature who had\nscreamed and beaten and bitten his pillow.  Even his ivory\nwhiteness seemed to change.  The faint glow of color\nwhich had shown on his face and neck and hands when he\nfirst got inside the garden really never quite died away.\nHe looked as if he were made of flesh instead of ivory\nor wax.",
        "They saw the robin carry food to his mate two or three times,\nand it was so suggestive of afternoon tea that Colin\nfelt they must have some.",
        "“Go and make one of the men servants bring some in a\nbasket to the rhododendron walk,” he said.  “And then\nyou and Dickon can bring it here.”",
        "It was an agreeable idea, easily carried out, and when\nthe white cloth was spread upon the grass, with hot tea\nand buttered toast and crumpets, a delightfully hungry\nmeal was eaten, and several birds on domestic errands\npaused to inquire what was going on and were led into\ninvestigating crumbs with great activity.  Nut and Shell\nwhisked up trees with pieces of cake and Soot took the\nentire half of a buttered crumpet into a corner and pecked\nat and examined and turned it over and made hoarse remarks\nabout it until he decided to swallow it all joyfully in one gulp.",
        "The afternoon was dragging towards its mellow hour.\nThe sun was deepening the gold of its lances, the bees\nwere going home and the birds were flying past less often.\nDickon and Mary were sitting on the grass, the tea-basket\nwas repacked ready to be taken back to the house, and Colin\nwas lying against his cushions with his heavy locks\npushed back from his forehead and his face looking quite\na natural color.",
        "“I don’t want this afternoon to go,” he said; “but I shall\ncome back tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after,\nand the day after.”",
        "“You’ll get plenty of fresh air, won’t you?” said Mary.\n\"I’m going to get nothing else,” he answered.\n\"I’ve seen the spring now and I’m going to see the summer.\nI’m going to see everything grow here.  I’m going to grow\nhere myself.”",
        "“That tha’ will,” said Dickon.  “Us’ll have thee walkin’\nabout here an’ diggin’ same as other folk afore long.”",
        "Colin flushed tremendously.",
        "“Walk!” he said.  “Dig! Shall I?”",
        "Dickon’s glance at him was delicately cautious.\nNeither he nor Mary had ever asked if anything was\nthe matter with his legs.",
        "“For sure tha’ will,” he said stoutly.  “Tha–tha’s got\nlegs o’ thine own, same as other folks!”",
        "Mary was rather frightened until she heard Colin’s answer.",
        "“Nothing really ails them,” he said, “but they are so thin\nand weak.  They shake so that I’m afraid to try to stand\non them.”",
        "Both Mary and Dickon drew a relieved breath.",
        "“When tha’ stops bein’ afraid tha’lt stand on ’em,\"\nDickon said with renewed cheer.  “An’ tha’lt stop bein’\nafraid in a bit.”",
        "“I shall?” said Colin, and he lay still as if he were\nwondering about things.",
        "They were really very quiet for a little while.\nThe sun was dropping lower.  It was that hour when\neverything stills itself, and they really had had a busy\nand exciting afternoon.  Colin looked as if he were\nresting luxuriously.  Even the creatures had ceased moving\nabout and had drawn together and were resting near them.\nSoot had perched on a low branch and drawn up one leg\nand dropped the gray film drowsily over his eyes.\nMary privately thought he looked as if he might snore\nin a minute.",
        "In the midst of this stillness it was rather startling\nwhen Colin half lifted his head and exclaimed in a loud\nsuddenly alarmed whisper:",
        "“Who is that man?” Dickon and Mary scrambled to their feet.",
        "“Man!” they both cried in low quick voices.",
        "Colin pointed to the high wall.  “Look!” he whispered excitedly.\n\"Just look!”",
        "Mary and Dickon wheeled about and looked.  There was Ben\nWeatherstaff’s indignant face glaring at them over the wall\nfrom the top of a ladder! He actually shook his fist at Mary.",
        "“If I wasn’t a bachelder, an’ tha’ was a wench o’\nmine,” he cried, “I’d give thee a hidin’!”",
        "He mounted another step threateningly as if it were his\nenergetic intention to jump down and deal with her;\nbut as she came toward him he evidently thought better\nof it and stood on the top step of his ladder shaking\nhis fist down at her.",
        "“I never thowt much o’ thee!” he harangued.  “I couldna’\nabide thee th’ first time I set eyes on thee.  A scrawny\nbuttermilk-faced young besom, allus askin’ questions an’\npokin’ tha’ nose where it wasna, wanted.  I never knowed\nhow tha’ got so thick wi’ me.  If it hadna’ been for th’\nrobin– Drat him–”",
        "“Ben Weatherstaff,” called out Mary, finding her breath.\nShe stood below him and called up to him with a sort\nof gasp.  “Ben Weatherstaff, it was the robin who showed me\nthe way!”",
        "Then it did seem as if Ben really would scramble down\non her side of the wall, he was so outraged.",
        "“Tha’ young bad ’un!” he called down at her.  “Layin’ tha’\nbadness on a robin–not but what he’s impidint enow\nfor anythin’. Him showin’ thee th’ way! Him! Eh! tha’\nyoung nowt\"–she could see his next words burst out\nbecause he was overpowered by curiosity–\"however i’\nthis world did tha’ get in?”",
        "“It was the robin who showed me the way,” she protested\nobstinately.  “He didn’t know he was doing it but he did.\nAnd I can’t tell you from here while you’re shaking\nyour fist at me.”",
        "He stopped shaking his fist very suddenly at that very\nmoment and his jaw actually dropped as he stared over her\nhead at something he saw coming over the grass toward him.",
        "At the first sound of his torrent of words Colin had\nbeen so surprised that he had only sat up and listened\nas if he were spellbound.  But in the midst of it he\nhad recovered himself and beckoned imperiously to Dickon.",
        "“Wheel me over there!” he commanded.  “Wheel me quite\nclose and stop right in front of him!”",
        "And this, if you please, this is what Ben Weatherstaff beheld\nand which made his jaw drop.  A wheeled chair with luxurious\ncushions and robes which came toward him looking rather\nlike some sort of State Coach because a young Rajah leaned\nback in it with royal command in his great black-rimmed\neyes and a thin white hand extended haughtily toward him.\nAnd it stopped right under Ben Weatherstaff’s nose.\nIt was really no wonder his mouth dropped open.",
        "“Do you know who I am?” demanded the Rajah.",
        "How Ben Weatherstaff stared! His red old eyes fixed\nthemselves on what was before him as if he were seeing\na ghost.  He gazed and gazed and gulped a lump down his\nthroat and did not say a word.  “Do you know who I am?\"\ndemanded Colin still more imperiously.  “Answer!”",
        "Ben Weatherstaff put his gnarled hand up and passed it\nover his eyes and over his forehead and then he did\nanswer in a queer shaky voice.",
        "“Who tha’ art?” he said.  “Aye, that I do–wi’ tha’\nmother’s eyes starin’ at me out o’ tha’ face.  Lord knows\nhow tha’ come here.  But tha’rt th’ poor cripple.”",
        "Colin forgot that he had ever had a back.  His face\nflushed scarlet and he sat bolt upright.",
        "“I’m not a cripple!” he cried out furiously.  “I’m not!”",
        "“He’s not!” cried Mary, almost shouting up the wall\nin her fierce indignation.  “He’s not got a lump as big\nas a pin! I looked and there was none there–not one!”",
        "Ben Weatherstaff passed his hand over his forehead\nagain and gazed as if he could never gaze enough.\nHis hand shook and his mouth shook and his voice shook.\nHe was an ignorant old man and a tactless old man and he\ncould only remember the things he had heard.",
        "“Tha’–tha’ hasn’t got a crooked back?” he said hoarsely.",
        "“No!” shouted Colin.",
        "“Tha’–tha’ hasn’t got crooked legs?” quavered Ben more\nhoarsely yet.  It was too much.  The strength which Colin\nusually threw into his tantrums rushed through him now\nin a new way.  Never yet had he been accused of crooked\nlegs–even in whispers–and the perfectly simple belief\nin their existence which was revealed by Ben Weatherstaff’s\nvoice was more than Rajah flesh and blood could endure.\nHis anger and insulted pride made him forget everything\nbut this one moment and filled him with a power he had\nnever known before, an almost unnatural strength.",
        "“Come here!” he shouted to Dickon, and he actually\nbegan to tear the coverings off his lower limbs and\ndisentangle himself.  “Come here! Come here! This minute!”",
        "Dickon was by his side in a second.  Mary caught her\nbreath in a short gasp and felt herself turn pale.",
        "“He can do it! He can do it! He can do it! He can!\"\nshe gabbled over to herself under her breath as fast\nas ever she could.",
        "There was a brief fierce scramble, the rugs were tossed\non the ground, Dickon held Colin’s arm, the thin\nlegs were out, the thin feet were on the grass.\nColin was standing upright–upright–as straight as an\narrow and looking strangely tall–his head thrown back\nand his strange eyes flashing lightning.  “Look at me!\"\nhe flung up at Ben Weatherstaff.  “Just look at me–you!\nJust look at me!”",
        "“He’s as straight as I am!” cried Dickon.  “He’s as\nstraight as any lad i’ Yorkshire!”",
        "What Ben Weatherstaff did Mary thought queer beyond measure.\nHe choked and gulped and suddenly tears ran down his\nweather-wrinkled cheeks as he struck his old hands together.",
        "“Eh!” he burst forth, “th’ lies folk tells! Tha’rt\nas thin as a lath an’ as white as a wraith, but there’s\nnot a knob on thee.  Tha’lt make a mon yet.  God bless thee!”",
        "Dickon held Colin’s arm strongly but the boy had not begun\nto falter.  He stood straighter and straighter and looked\nBen Weatherstaff in the face.",
        "“I’m your master,” he said, “when my father is away.\nAnd you are to obey me.  This is my garden.  Don’t dare\nto say a word about it! You get down from that ladder\nand go out to the Long Walk and Miss Mary will meet you\nand bring you here.  I want to talk to you.  We did not\nwant you, but now you will have to be in the secret.\nBe quick!”",
        "Ben Weatherstaff’s crabbed old face was still wet with\nthat one queer rush of tears.  It seemed as if he could\nnot take his eyes from thin straight Colin standing\non his feet with his head thrown back.",
        "“Eh! lad,” he almost whispered.  “Eh! my lad!” And then\nremembering himself he suddenly touched his hat gardener\nfashion and said, “Yes, sir! Yes, sir!” and obediently\ndisappeared as he descended the ladder.",
        "When his head was out of sight Colin turned to Mary.",
        "“Go and meet him,” he said; and Mary flew across the grass\nto the door under the ivy.",
        "Dickon was watching him with sharp eyes.  There were\nscarlet spots on his cheeks and he looked amazing,\nbut he showed no signs of falling.",
        "“I can stand,” he said, and his head was still held up\nand he said it quite grandly.",
        "“I told thee tha’ could as soon as tha’ stopped bein’\nafraid,” answered Dickon.  “An’ tha’s stopped.”",
        "“Yes, I’ve stopped,” said Colin.",
        "Then suddenly he remembered something Mary had said.",
        "“Are you making Magic?” he asked sharply.",
        "Dickon’s curly mouth spread in a cheerful grin.",
        "“Tha’s doin’ Magic thysel’,” he said.  “It’s same Magic\nas made these ’ere work out o’ th’ earth,” and he touched\nwith his thick boot a clump of crocuses in the grass.\nColin looked down at them.",
        "“Aye,” he said slowly, “there couldna’ be bigger Magic\nthan that there–there couldna’ be.”",
        "He drew himself up straighter than ever.",
        "“I’m going to walk to that tree,” he said, pointing to\none a few feet away from him.  “I’m going to be standing\nwhen Weatherstaff comes here.  I can rest against the tree\nif I like.  When I want to sit down I will sit down,\nbut not before.  Bring a rug from the chair.”",
        "He walked to the tree and though Dickon held his arm he was\nwonderfully steady.  When he stood against the tree trunk\nit was not too plain that he supported himself against it,\nand he still held himself so straight that he looked tall.",
        "When Ben Weatherstaff came through the door in the wall\nhe saw him standing there and he heard Mary muttering\nsomething under her breath.",
        "“What art sayin’?” he asked rather testily because he\ndid not want his attention distracted from the long thin\nstraight boy figure and proud face.",
        "But she did not tell him.  What she was saying was this:",
        "“You can do it! You can do it! I told you you could!\nYou can do it! You can do it! You can!” She was saying\nit to Colin because she wanted to make Magic and keep\nhim on his feet looking like that.  She could not bear\nthat he should give in before Ben Weatherstaff.\nHe did not give in.  She was uplifted by a sudden feeling\nthat he looked quite beautiful in spite of his thinness.\nHe fixed his eyes on Ben Weatherstaff in his funny\nimperious way.",
        "“Look at me!” he commanded.  “Look at me all over! Am I\na hunchback? Have I got crooked legs?”",
        "Ben Weatherstaff had not quite got over his emotion,\nbut he had recovered a little and answered almost in his\nusual way.",
        "“Not tha’,” he said.  “Nowt o’ th’ sort.  What’s tha’\nbeen doin’ with thysel’–hidin’ out o’ sight an’ lettin’\nfolk think tha’ was cripple an’ half-witted?”",
        "“Half-witted!” said Colin angrily.  “Who thought that?”",
        "“Lots o’ fools,” said Ben.  “Th’ world’s full o’\njackasses brayin’ an’ they never bray nowt but lies.\nWhat did tha’ shut thysel’ up for?”",
        "“Everyone thought I was going to die,” said Colin shortly.\n\"I’m not!”",
        "And he said it with such decision Ben Weatherstaff looked\nhim over, up and down, down and up.",
        "“Tha’ die!” he said with dry exultation.  “Nowt o’ th’\nsort! Tha’s got too much pluck in thee.  When I seed thee\nput tha’ legs on th’ ground in such a hurry I knowed tha’\nwas all right.  Sit thee down on th’ rug a bit young\nMester an’ give me thy orders.”",
        "There was a queer mixture of crabbed tenderness and shrewd\nunderstanding in his manner.  Mary had poured out speech\nas rapidly as she could as they had come down the Long Walk.\nThe chief thing to be remembered, she had told him,\nwas that Colin was getting well–getting well.  The garden\nwas doing it.  No one must let him remember about having\nhumps and dying.",
        "The Rajah condescended to seat himself on a rug under\nthe tree.",
        "“What work do you do in the gardens, Weatherstaff?\"\nhe inquired.",
        "“Anythin’ I’m told to do,” answered old Ben.  “I’m kep’\non by favor–because she liked me.”",
        "“She?” said Colin.",
        "“Tha’ mother,” answered Ben Weatherstaff.",
        "“My mother?” said Colin, and he looked about him quietly.\n\"This was her garden, wasn’t it?”",
        "“Aye, it was that!” and Ben Weatherstaff looked about\nhim too.  “She were main fond of it.”",
        "“It is my garden now.  I am fond of it.  I shall come here\nevery day,” announced Colin.  “But it is to be a secret.\nMy orders are that no one is to know that we come here.\nDickon and my cousin have worked and made it come alive.\nI shall send for you sometimes to help–but you must come\nwhen no one can see you.”",
        "Ben Weatherstaff’s face twisted itself in a dry old smile.",
        "“I’ve come here before when no one saw me,” he said.",
        "“What!” exclaimed Colin.",
        "“When?”",
        "“Th’ last time I was here,” rubbing his chin\nand looking round, “was about two year’ ago.”",
        "“But no one has been in it for ten years!” cried Colin.",
        "“There was no door!”",
        "“I’m no one,” said old Ben dryly.  “An’ I didn’t come\nthrough th’ door.  I come over th’ wall.  Th’ rheumatics held\nme back th’ last two year’.”",
        "“Tha’ come an’ did a bit o’ prunin’!” cried Dickon.\n\"I couldn’t make out how it had been done.”",
        "“She was so fond of it–she was!” said Ben Weatherstaff slowly.\n\"An’ she was such a pretty young thing.  She says to me once,\n`Ben,’ says she laughin’, `if ever I’m ill or if I go away\nyou must take care of my roses.’ When she did go away th’\norders was no one was ever to come nigh.  But I come,\"\nwith grumpy obstinacy.  “Over th’ wall I come–until th’\nrheumatics stopped me–an’ I did a bit o’ work once a year.\nShe’d gave her order first.”",
        "“It wouldn’t have been as wick as it is if tha’\nhadn’t done it,” said Dickon.  “I did wonder.”",
        "“I’m glad you did it, Weatherstaff,” said Colin.\n\"You’ll know how to keep the secret.”",
        "“Aye, I’ll know, sir,” answered Ben.  “An, it’ll be easier\nfor a man wi’ rheumatics to come in at th’ door.”",
        "On the grass near the tree Mary had dropped her trowel.\nColin stretched out his hand and took it up.  An odd expression\ncame into his face and he began to scratch at the earth.\nHis thin hand was weak enough but presently as they watched\nhim–Mary with quite breathless interest–he drove the end\nof the trowel into the soil and turned some over.",
        "“You can do it! You can do it!” said Mary to herself.\n\"I tell you, you can!”",
        "Dickon’s round eyes were full of eager curiousness but he said\nnot a word.  Ben Weatherstaff looked on with interested face.",
        "Colin persevered.  After he had turned a few trowelfuls\nof soil he spoke exultantly to Dickon in his best Yorkshire.",
        "“Tha’ said as tha’d have me walkin’ about here same\nas other folk–an’ tha’ said tha’d have me diggin’. I\nthowt tha’ was just leein’ to please me.  This is only th’\nfirst day an’ I’ve walked–an’ here I am diggin’.”",
        "Ben Weatherstaff’s mouth fell open again when he heard him,\nbut he ended by chuckling.",
        "“Eh!” he said, “that sounds as if tha’d got wits enow.\nTha’rt a Yorkshire lad for sure.  An’ tha’rt diggin’, too.\nHow’d tha’ like to plant a bit o’ somethin’? I can get thee\na rose in a pot.”",
        "“Go and get it!” said Colin, digging excitedly.\n\"Quick! Quick!”",
        "It was done quickly enough indeed.  Ben Weatherstaff went\nhis way forgetting rheumatics.  Dickon took his spade\nand dug the hole deeper and wider than a new digger\nwith thin white hands could make it.  Mary slipped out\nto run and bring back a watering-can. When Dickon had\ndeepened the hole Colin went on turning the soft earth\nover and over.  He looked up at the sky, flushed and\nglowing with the strangely new exercise, slight as it was.",
        "“I want to do it before the sun goes quite–quite down,\"\nhe said.",
        "Mary thought that perhaps the sun held back a few minutes\njust on purpose.  Ben Weatherstaff brought the rose in\nits pot from the greenhouse.  He hobbled over the grass\nas fast as he could.  He had begun to be excited, too.\nHe knelt down by the hole and broke the pot from the mould.",
        "“Here, lad,” he said, handing the plant to Colin.\n\"Set it in the earth thysel’ same as th’ king does when he\ngoes to a new place.”",
        "The thin white hands shook a little and Colin’s flush\ngrew deeper as he set the rose in the mould and held\nit while old Ben made firm the earth.  It was filled\nin and pressed down and made steady.  Mary was leaning\nforward on her hands and knees.  Soot had flown down\nand marched forward to see what was being done.\nNut and Shell chattered about it from a cherry-tree.",
        "“It’s planted!” said Colin at last.  “And the sun is only\nslipping over the edge.  Help me up, Dickon.  I want\nto be standing when it goes.  That’s part of the Magic.”",
        "And Dickon helped him, and the Magic–or whatever it\nwas–so gave him strength that when the sun did slip\nover the edge and end the strange lovely afternoon\nfor them there he actually stood on his two feet–laughing.",
        "Dr. Craven had been waiting some time at the house\nwhen they returned to it.  He had indeed begun to wonder\nif it might not be wise to send some one out to explore\nthe garden paths.  When Colin was brought back to his\nroom the poor man looked him over seriously.",
        "“You should not have stayed so long,” he said.  “You must\nnot overexert yourself.”",
        "“I am not tired at all,” said Colin.  “It has made me well.\nTomorrow I am going out in the morning as well as in\nthe afternoon.”",
        "“I am not sure that I can allow it,” answered Dr. Craven.\n\"I am afraid it would not be wise.”",
        "“It would not be wise to try to stop me,” said Colin\nquite seriously.  “I am going.”",
        "Even Mary had found out that one of Colin’s chief peculiarities\nwas that he did not know in the least what a rude little\nbrute he was with his way of ordering people about.\nHe had lived on a sort of desert island all his life\nand as he had been the king of it he had made his own\nmanners and had had no one to compare himself with.\nMary had indeed been rather like him herself and since she\nhad been at Misselthwaite had gradually discovered that\nher own manners had not been of the kind which is usual\nor popular.  Having made this discovery she naturally\nthought it of enough interest to communicate to Colin.\nSo she sat and looked at him curiously for a few minutes\nafter Dr. Craven had gone.  She wanted to make him ask\nher why she was doing it and of course she did.",
        "“What are you looking at me for?” he said.",
        "“I’m thinking that I am rather sorry for Dr. Craven.”",
        "“So am I,” said Colin calmly, but not without an air\nof some satisfaction.  “He won’t get Misselthwaite\nat all now I’m not going to die.”",
        "“I’m sorry for him because of that, of course,” said Mary,\n\"but I was thinking just then that it must have been very\nhorrid to have had to be polite for ten years to a boy\nwho was always rude.  I would never have done it.”",
        "“Am I rude?” Colin inquired undisturbedly.",
        "“If you had been his own boy and he had been a slapping\nsort of man,” said Mary, “he would have slapped you.”",
        "“But he daren’t,” said Colin.",
        "“No, he daren’t,” answered Mistress Mary, thinking the\nthing out quite without prejudice.  “Nobody ever dared\nto do anything you didn’t like–because you were going\nto die and things like that.  You were such a poor thing.”",
        "“But,” announced Colin stubbornly, “I am not going\nto be a poor thing.  I won’t let people think I’m one.\nI stood on my feet this afternoon.”",
        "“It is always having your own way that has made you\nso queer,” Mary went on, thinking aloud.",
        "Colin turned his head, frowning.",
        "“Am I queer?” he demanded.",
        "“Yes,” answered Mary, “very. But you needn’t be cross,\"\nshe added impartially, “because so am I queer–and so is\nBen Weatherstaff.  But I am not as queer as I was before I\nbegan to like people and before I found the garden.”",
        "“I don’t want to be queer,” said Colin.  “I am not going\nto be,” and he frowned again with determination.",
        "He was a very proud boy.  He lay thinking for a while and\nthen Mary saw his beautiful smile begin and gradually\nchange his whole face.",
        "“I shall stop being queer,” he said, “if I go every day\nto the garden.  There is Magic in there–good Magic,\nyou know, Mary.  I am sure there is.” “So am I,\"\nsaid Mary.",
        "“Even if it isn’t real Magic,” Colin said, “we can pretend\nit is.  Something is there–something!”",
        "“It’s Magic,” said Mary, “but not black.  It’s as white\nas snow.”",
        "They always called it Magic and indeed it seemed like it\nin the months that followed–the wonderful months–the\nradiant months–the amazing ones.  Oh! the things\nwhich happened in that garden! If you have never had\na garden you cannot understand, and if you have had\na garden you will know that it would take a whole book\nto describe all that came to pass there.  At first it\nseemed that green things would never cease pushing\ntheir way through the earth, in the grass, in the beds,\neven in the crevices of the walls.  Then the green things\nbegan to show buds and the buds began to unfurl and\nshow color, every shade of blue, every shade of purple,\nevery tint and hue of crimson.  In its happy days flowers\nhad been tucked away into every inch and hole and corner.\nBen Weatherstaff had seen it done and had himself scraped\nout mortar from between the bricks of the wall and made\npockets of earth for lovely clinging things to grow on.\nIris and white lilies rose out of the grass in sheaves,\nand the green alcoves filled themselves with amazing armies\nof the blue and white flower lances of tall delphiniums\nor columbines or campanulas.",
        "“She was main fond o’ them–she was,” Ben Weatherstaff said.\n\"She liked them things as was allus pointin’ up to th’\nblue sky, she used to tell.  Not as she was one o’\nthem as looked down on th’ earth–not her.  She just loved\nit but she said as th’ blue sky allus looked so joyful.”",
        "The seeds Dickon and Mary had planted grew as if fairies\nhad tended them.  Satiny poppies of all tints danced in the\nbreeze by the score, gaily defying flowers which had lived\nin the garden for years and which it might be confessed\nseemed rather to wonder how such new people had got there.\nAnd the roses–the roses! Rising out of the grass,\ntangled round the sun-dial, wreathing the tree trunks\nand hanging from their branches, climbing up the walls\nand spreading over them with long garlands falling\nin cascades–they came alive day by day, hour by hour.\nFair fresh leaves, and buds–and buds–tiny at first but\nswelling and working Magic until they burst and uncurled\ninto cups of scent delicately spilling themselves over\ntheir brims and filling the garden air.",
        "Colin saw it all, watching each change as it took place.\nEvery morning he was brought out and every hour of each day\nwhen it didn’t rain he spent in the garden.  Even gray\ndays pleased him.  He would lie on the grass “watching\nthings growing,” he said.  If you watched long enough,\nhe declared, you could see buds unsheath themselves.\nAlso you could make the acquaintance of strange busy insect\nthings running about on various unknown but evidently\nserious errands, sometimes carrying tiny scraps of straw\nor feather or food, or climbing blades of grass as if they\nwere trees from whose tops one could look out to explore\nthe country.  A mole throwing up its mound at the end of its\nburrow and making its way out at last with the long-nailed\npaws which looked so like elfish hands, had absorbed him\none whole morning.  Ants’ ways, beetles’ ways, bees’\nways, frogs’ ways, birds’ ways, plants’ ways, gave him\na new world to explore and when Dickon revealed them\nall and added foxes’ ways, otters’ ways, ferrets’ ways,\nsquirrels’ ways, and trout’ and water-rats’ and badgers’\nways, there was no end to the things to talk about and think\nover.",
        "And this was not the half of the Magic.  The fact that he\nhad really once stood on his feet had set Colin thinking\ntremendously and when Mary told him of the spell she\nhad worked he was excited and approved of it greatly.\nHe talked of it constantly.",
        "“Of course there must be lots of Magic in the world,\"\nhe said wisely one day, “but people don’t know what it is\nlike or how to make it.  Perhaps the beginning is just to say\nnice things are going to happen until you make them happen.\nI am going to try and experiment”",
        "The next morning when they went to the secret garden he sent\nat once for Ben Weatherstaff.  Ben came as quickly as he\ncould and found the Rajah standing on his feet under a tree\nand looking very grand but also very beautifully smiling.",
        "“Good morning, Ben Weatherstaff,” he said.  “I want you\nand Dickon and Miss Mary to stand in a row and listen to me\nbecause I am going to tell you something very important.”",
        "“Aye, aye, sir!” answered Ben Weatherstaff, touching\nhis forehead.  (One of the long concealed charms of Ben\nWeatherstaff was that in his boyhood he had once run away\nto sea and had made voyages.  So he could reply like a sailor.)",
        "“I am going to try a scientific experiment,” explained the Rajah.\n\"When I grow up I am going to make great scientific\ndiscoveries and I am going to begin now with this experiment”",
        "“Aye, aye, sir!” said Ben Weatherstaff promptly,\nthough this was the first time he had heard of great\nscientific discoveries.",
        "It was the first time Mary had heard of them, either,\nbut even at this stage she had begun to realize that,\nqueer as he was, Colin had read about a great many singular\nthings and was somehow a very convincing sort of boy.\nWhen he held up his head and fixed his strange eyes on you\nit seemed as if you believed him almost in spite of yourself\nthough he was only ten years old–going on eleven.\nAt this moment he was especially convincing because he\nsuddenly felt the fascination of actually making a sort\nof speech like a grown-up person.",
        "“The great scientific discoveries I am going to make,\"\nhe went on, “will be about Magic.  Magic is a great thing\nand scarcely any one knows anything about it except a few\npeople in old books–and Mary a little, because she was\nborn in India where there are fakirs.  I believe Dickon\nknows some Magic, but perhaps he doesn’t know he knows it.\nHe charms animals and people.  I would never have let him\ncome to see me if he had not been an animal charmer–which\nis a boy charmer, too, because a boy is an animal.\nI am sure there is Magic in everything, only we have not\nsense enough to get hold of it and make it do things for\nus–like electricity and horses and steam.”",
        "This sounded so imposing that Ben Weatherstaff became\nquite excited and really could not keep still.  “Aye, aye,\nsir,” he said and he began to stand up quite straight.",
        "“When Mary found this garden it looked quite dead,\"\nthe orator proceeded.  “Then something began pushing things\nup out of the soil and making things out of nothing.\nOne day things weren’t there and another they were.\nI had never watched things before and it made me feel\nvery curious.  Scientific people are always curious and I\nam going to be scientific.  I keep saying to myself,\n`What is it? What is it?’ It’s something.  It can’t\nbe nothing! I don’t know its name so I call it Magic.\nI have never seen the sun rise but Mary and Dickon have\nand from what they tell me I am sure that is Magic too.\nSomething pushes it up and draws it.  Sometimes since I’ve\nbeen in the garden I’ve looked up through the trees at\nthe sky and I have had a strange feeling of being happy\nas if something were pushing and drawing in my chest\nand making me breathe fast.  Magic is always pushing and\ndrawing and making things out of nothing.  Everything is\nmade out of Magic, leaves and trees, flowers and birds,\nbadgers and foxes and squirrels and people.  So it must\nbe all around us.  In this garden–in all the places.\nThe Magic in this garden has made me stand up and know\nI am going to live to be a man.  I am going to make the\nscientific experiment of trying to get some and put it\nin myself and make it push and draw me and make me strong.\nI don’t know how to do it but I think that if you keep\nthinking about it and calling it perhaps it will come.\nPerhaps that is the first baby way to get it.\nWhen I was going to try to stand that first time Mary\nkept saying to herself as fast as she could, `You can\ndo it! You can do it!’ and I did.  I had to try myself\nat the same time, of course, but her Magic helped me–and\nso did Dickon’s. Every morning and evening and as often\nin the daytime as I can remember I am going to say,\n’Magic is in me! Magic is making me well! I am going\nto be as strong as Dickon, as strong as Dickon!’ And you\nmust all do it, too.  That is my experiment Will you help,\nBen Weatherstaff?”",
        "“Aye, aye, sir!” said Ben Weatherstaff.  “Aye, aye!”",
        "“If you keep doing it every day as regularly as soldiers\ngo through drill we shall see what will happen and find\nout if the experiment succeeds.  You learn things\nby saying them over and over and thinking about them\nuntil they stay in your mind forever and I think it\nwill be the same with Magic.  If you keep calling it\nto come to you and help you it will get to be part\nof you and it will stay and do things.” “I once heard\nan officer in India tell my mother that there were fakirs\nwho said words over and over thousands of times,” said Mary.",
        "“I’ve heard Jem Fettleworth’s wife say th’ same thing over\nthousands o’ times–callin’ Jem a drunken brute,” said Ben\nWeatherstaff dryly.  “Summat allus come o’ that, sure enough.\nHe gave her a good hidin’ an’ went to th’ Blue Lion an’\ngot as drunk as a lord.”",
        "Colin drew his brows together and thought a few minutes.\nThen he cheered up.",
        "“Well,” he said, “you see something did come of it.\nShe used the wrong Magic until she made him beat her.\nIf she’d used the right Magic and had said something\nnice perhaps he wouldn’t have got as drunk as a lord and\nperhaps–perhaps he might have bought her a new bonnet.”",
        "Ben Weatherstaff chuckled and there was shrewd admiration\nin his little old eyes.",
        "“Tha’rt a clever lad as well as a straight-legged one,\nMester Colin,” he said.  “Next time I see Bess Fettleworth\nI’ll give her a bit of a hint o’ what Magic will do for her.\nShe’d be rare an’ pleased if th’ sinetifik ’speriment\nworked –an’ so ’ud Jem.”",
        "Dickon had stood listening to the lecture, his round\neyes shining with curious delight.  Nut and Shell were\non his shoulders and he held a long-eared white rabbit\nin his arm and stroked and stroked it softly while it\nlaid its ears along its back and enjoyed itself.",
        "“Do you think the experiment will work?” Colin asked him,\nwondering what he was thinking.  He so often wondered\nwhat Dickon was thinking when he saw him looking at him\nor at one of his “creatures” with his happy wide smile.",
        "He smiled now and his smile was wider than usual.",
        "“Aye,” he answered, “that I do.  It’ll work same as th’\nseeds do when th’ sun shines on ’em. It’ll work for sure.\nShall us begin it now?”",
        "Colin was delighted and so was Mary.  Fired by recollections\nof fakirs and devotees in illustrations Colin suggested\nthat they should all sit cross-legged under the tree\nwhich made a canopy.",
        "“It will be like sitting in a sort of temple,” said Colin.\n\"I’m rather tired and I want to sit down.”",
        "“Eh!” said Dickon, “tha’ mustn’t begin by sayin’\ntha’rt tired.  Tha’ might spoil th’ Magic.”",
        "Colin turned and looked at him–into his innocent round eyes.",
        "“That’s true,” he said slowly.  “I must only think of\nthe Magic.” It all seemed most majestic and mysterious\nwhen they sat down in their circle.  Ben Weatherstaff\nfelt as if he had somehow been led into appearing\nat a prayer-meeting. Ordinarily he was very fixed in\nbeing what he called “agen’ prayer-meetin’s” but this\nbeing the Rajah’s affair he did not resent it and was\nindeed inclined to be gratified at being called upon\nto assist.  Mistress Mary felt solemnly enraptured.\nDickon held his rabbit in his arm, and perhaps he made\nsome charmer’s signal no one heard, for when he sat down,\ncross-legged like the rest, the crow, the fox, the squirrels\nand the lamb slowly drew near and made part of the circle,\nsettling each into a place of rest as if of their own desire.",
        "“The `creatures’ have come,” said Colin gravely.\n\"They want to help us.”",
        "Colin really looked quite beautiful, Mary thought.\nHe held his head high as if he felt like a sort of priest\nand his strange eyes had a wonderful look in them.\nThe light shone on him through the tree canopy.",
        "“Now we will begin,” he said.  “Shall we sway backward\nand forward, Mary, as if we were dervishes?”",
        "“I canna’ do no swayin’ back’ard and for’ard,\"\nsaid Ben Weatherstaff.  “I’ve got th’ rheumatics.”",
        "“The Magic will take them away,” said Colin in a High\nPriest tone, “but we won’t sway until it has done it.\nWe will only chant.”",
        "“I canna’ do no chantin’” said Ben Weatherstaff a\ntrifle testily.  “They turned me out o’ th’ church choir th’\nonly time I ever tried it.”",
        "No one smiled.  They were all too much in earnest.\nColin’s face was not even crossed by a shadow.  He was\nthinking only of the Magic.",
        "“Then I will chant,” he said.  And he began, looking like\na strange boy spirit.  “The sun is shining–the sun\nis shining.  That is the Magic.  The flowers are growing–the\nroots are stirring.  That is the Magic.  Being alive\nis the Magic–being strong is the Magic.  The Magic is\nin me–the Magic is in me.  It is in me–it is in me.\nIt’s in every one of us.  It’s in Ben Weatherstaff’s back.\nMagic! Magic! Come and help!”",
        "He said it a great many times–not a thousand times\nbut quite a goodly number.  Mary listened entranced.\nShe felt as if it were at once queer and beautiful and she\nwanted him to go on and on.  Ben Weatherstaff began to feel\nsoothed into a sort of dream which was quite agreeable.\nThe humming of the bees in the blossoms mingled with\nthe chanting voice and drowsily melted into a doze.\nDickon sat cross-legged with his rabbit asleep\non his arm and a hand resting on the lamb’s back.\nSoot had pushed away a squirrel and huddled close to him\non his shoulder, the gray film dropped over his eyes.\nAt last Colin stopped.",
        "“Now I am going to walk round the garden,” he announced.",
        "Ben Weatherstaff’s head had just dropped forward and he\nlifted it with a jerk.",
        "“You have been asleep,” said Colin.",
        "“Nowt o’ th’ sort,” mumbled Ben.  “Th’ sermon was good\nenow–but I’m bound to get out afore th’ collection.”",
        "He was not quite awake yet.",
        "“You’re not in church,” said Colin.",
        "“Not me,” said Ben, straightening himself.  “Who said I\nwere? I heard every bit of it.  You said th’ Magic was\nin my back.  Th’ doctor calls it rheumatics.”",
        "The Rajah waved his hand.",
        "“That was the wrong Magic,” he said.  “You will get better.\nYou have my permission to go to your work.  But come\nback tomorrow.”",
        "“I’d like to see thee walk round the garden,” grunted Ben.",
        "It was not an unfriendly grunt, but it was a grunt.\nIn fact, being a stubborn old party and not having entire\nfaith in Magic he had made up his mind that if he were sent\naway he would climb his ladder and look over the wall\nso that he might be ready to hobble back if there were\nany stumbling.",
        "The Rajah did not object to his staying and so the procession\nwas formed.  It really did look like a procession.\nColin was at its head with Dickon on one side and\nMary on the other.  Ben Weatherstaff walked behind,\nand the “creatures” trailed after them, the lamb and\nthe fox cub keeping close to Dickon, the white rabbit\nhopping along or stopping to nibble and Soot following\nwith the solemnity of a person who felt himself in charge.",
        "It was a procession which moved slowly but with dignity.\nEvery few yards it stopped to rest.  Colin leaned on Dickon’s\narm and privately Ben Weatherstaff kept a sharp lookout,\nbut now and then Colin took his hand from its support\nand walked a few steps alone.  His head was held up all\nthe time and he looked very grand.",
        "“The Magic is in me!” he kept saying.  “The Magic\nis making me strong! I can feel it! I can feel it!”",
        "It seemed very certain that something was upholding\nand uplifting him.  He sat on the seats in the alcoves,\nand once or twice he sat down on the grass and several\ntimes he paused in the path and leaned on Dickon, but he\nwould not give up until he had gone all round the garden.\nWhen he returned to the canopy tree his cheeks were flushed\nand he looked triumphant.",
        "“I did it! The Magic worked!” he cried.  “That is my\nfirst scientific discovery.”.",
        "“What will Dr. Craven say?” broke out Mary.",
        "“He won’t say anything,” Colin answered, “because he will\nnot be told.  This is to be the biggest secret of all.\nNo one is to know anything about it until I have grown\nso strong that I can walk and run like any other boy.\nI shall come here every day in my chair and I shall be\ntaken back in it.  I won’t have people whispering and\nasking questions and I won’t let my father hear about it\nuntil the experiment has quite succeeded.  Then sometime\nwhen he comes back to Misselthwaite I shall just walk into\nhis study and say `Here I am; I am like any other boy.\nI am quite well and I shall live to be a man.  It has been\ndone by a scientific experiment.’”",
        "“He will think he is in a dream,” cried Mary.  “He won’t\nbelieve his eyes.”",
        "Colin flushed triumphantly.  He had made himself believe\nthat he was going to get well, which was really more\nthan half the battle, if he had been aware of it.\nAnd the thought which stimulated him more than any other\nwas this imagining what his father would look like when he\nsaw that he had a son who was as straight and strong as\nother fathers’ sons.  One of his darkest miseries in the\nunhealthy morbid past days had been his hatred of being\na sickly weak-backed boy whose father was afraid to look at him.",
        "“He’ll be obliged to believe them,” he said.",
        "“One of the things I am going to do, after the Magic\nworks and before I begin to make scientific discoveries,\nis to be an athlete.”",
        "“We shall have thee takin’ to boxin’ in a week or so,\"\nsaid Ben Weatherstaff.  “Tha’lt end wi’ winnin’ th’\nBelt an’ bein’ champion prize-fighter of all England.”",
        "Colin fixed his eyes on him sternly.",
        "“Weatherstaff,” he said, “that is disrespectful.\nYou must not take liberties because you are in the secret.\nHowever much the Magic works I shall not be a prize-fighter.\nI shall be a Scientific Discoverer.”",
        "“Ax pardon–ax pardon, sir” answered Ben, touching his\nforehead in salute.  “I ought to have seed it wasn’t\na jokin’ matter,” but his eyes twinkled and secretly he\nwas immensely pleased.  He really did not mind being\nsnubbed since the snubbing meant that the lad was gaining\nstrength and spirit.",
        "The secret garden was not the only one Dickon worked in.\nRound the cottage on the moor there was a piece of ground\nenclosed by a low wall of rough stones.  Early in the morning\nand late in the fading twilight and on all the days Colin\nand Mary did not see him, Dickon worked there planting\nor tending potatoes and cabbages, turnips and carrots and\nherbs for his mother.  In the company of his “creatures\"\nhe did wonders there and was never tired of doing them,\nit seemed.  While he dug or weeded he whistled or sang\nbits of Yorkshire moor songs or talked to Soot or Captain\nor the brothers and sisters he had taught to help him.",
        "“We’d never get on as comfortable as we do,” Mrs. Sowerby said,\n\"if it wasn’t for Dickon’s garden.  Anything’ll grow for him.\nHis ’taters and cabbages is twice th’ size of any one\nelse’s an’ they’ve got a flavor with ’em as nobody’s has.”",
        "When she found a moment to spare she liked to go out\nand talk to him.  After supper there was still a long\nclear twilight to work in and that was her quiet time.\nShe could sit upon the low rough wall and look on\nand hear stories of the day.  She loved this time.\nThere were not only vegetables in this garden.\nDickon had bought penny packages of flower seeds now\nand then and sown bright sweet-scented things among\ngooseberry bushes and even cabbages and he grew borders\nof mignonette and pinks and pansies and things whose\nseeds he could save year after year or whose roots would\nbloom each spring and spread in time into fine clumps.\nThe low wall was one of the prettiest things in Yorkshire\nbecause he had tucked moorland foxglove and ferns and\nrock-cress and hedgerow flowers into every crevice until\nonly here and there glimpses of the stones were to be seen.",
        "“All a chap’s got to do to make ’em thrive, mother,\"\nhe would say, “is to be friends with ’em for sure.\nThey’re just like th’ `creatures.’ If they’re thirsty give\n’em drink and if they’re hungry give ’em a bit o’ food.\nThey want to live same as we do.  If they died I should feel\nas if I’d been a bad lad and somehow treated them heartless.”",
        "It was in these twilight hours that Mrs. Sowerby heard of all\nthat happened at Misselthwaite Manor.  At first she was only\ntold that “Mester Colin” had taken a fancy to going out into\nthe grounds with Miss Mary and that it was doing him good.\nBut it was not long before it was agreed between the two\nchildren that Dickon’s mother might “come into the secret.\"\nSomehow it was not doubted that she was “safe for sure.”",
        "So one beautiful still evening Dickon told the whole story,\nwith all the thrilling details of the buried key and the\nrobin and the gray haze which had seemed like deadness\nand the secret Mistress Mary had planned never to reveal.\nThe coming of Dickon and how it had been told to him,\nthe doubt of Mester Colin and the final drama of his\nintroduction to the hidden domain, combined with the\nincident of Ben Weatherstaff’s angry face peering over\nthe wall and Mester Colin’s sudden indignant strength,\nmade Mrs. Sowerby’s nice-looking face quite change color\nseveral times.",
        "“My word!” she said.  “It was a good thing that little\nlass came to th’ Manor.  It’s been th’ makin’ o’ her an’\nth’ savin, o’ him.  Standin’ on his feet! An’ us all thinkin’\nhe was a poor half-witted lad with not a straight bone in him.”",
        "She asked a great many questions and her blue eyes were\nfull of deep thinking.",
        "“What do they make of it at th’ Manor–him being so well an’\ncheerful an’ never complainin’?” she inquired.  “They don’t\nknow what to make of it,” answered Dickon.  “Every day\nas comes round his face looks different.  It’s fillin’\nout and doesn’t look so sharp an’ th’ waxy color is goin’.\nBut he has to do his bit o’ complainin’,” with a highly\nentertained grin.",
        "“What for, i’ Mercy’s name?” asked Mrs. Sowerby.",
        "Dickon chuckled.",
        "“He does it to keep them from guessin’ what’s happened.\nIf the doctor knew he’d found out he could stand on\nhis feet he’d likely write and tell Mester Craven.\nMester Colin’s savin’ th’ secret to tell himself.\nHe’s goin’ to practise his Magic on his legs every day\ntill his father comes back an’ then he’s goin’ to march\ninto his room an’ show him he’s as straight as other lads.\nBut him an’ Miss Mary thinks it’s best plan to do a\nbit o’ groanin’ an’ frettin’ now an’ then to throw folk\noff th’ scent.”",
        "Mrs. Sowerby was laughing a low comfortable laugh long\nbefore he had finished his last sentence.",
        "“Eh!” she said, “that pair’s enjoyin’ their-selves I’ll warrant.\nThey’ll get a good bit o’ actin’ out of it an’ there’s nothin’\nchildren likes as much as play actin’. Let’s hear what\nthey do, Dickon lad.” Dickon stopped weeding and sat\nup on his heels to tell her.  His eyes were twinkling with fun.",
        "“Mester Colin is carried down to his chair every time\nhe goes out,” he explained.  “An’ he flies out at John,\nth’ footman, for not carryin’ him careful enough.  He makes\nhimself as helpless lookin’ as he can an’ never lifts his head\nuntil we’re out o’ sight o’ th’ house.  An’ he grunts an’\nfrets a good bit when he’s bein’ settled into his chair.\nHim an’ Miss Mary’s both got to enjoyin’ it an’ when he\ngroans an’ complains she’ll say, `Poor Colin! Does it hurt\nyou so much? Are you so weak as that, poor Colin?’–but th’\ntrouble is that sometimes they can scarce keep from burstin’\nout laughin’. When we get safe into the garden they laugh\ntill they’ve no breath left to laugh with.  An’ they have\nto stuff their faces into Mester Colin’s cushions to keep\nthe gardeners from hearin’, if any of, ’em’s about.”",
        "“Th’ more they laugh th’ better for ’em!” said Mrs. Sowerby,\nstill laughing herself.  “Good healthy child laughin’s\nbetter than pills any day o’ th’ year.  That pair’ll\nplump up for sure.”",
        "“They are plumpin’ up,” said Dickon.  “They’re that hungry\nthey don’t know how to get enough to eat without makin’\ntalk.  Mester Colin says if he keeps sendin’ for more food\nthey won’t believe he’s an invalid at all.  Miss Mary says\nshe’ll let him eat her share, but he says that if she\ngoes hungry she’ll get thin an’ they mun both get fat at once.”",
        "Mrs. Sowerby laughed so heartily at the revelation of this\ndifficulty that she quite rocked backward and forward\nin her blue cloak, and Dickon laughed with her.",
        "“I’ll tell thee what, lad,” Mrs. Sowerby said when she\ncould speak.  “I’ve thought of a way to help ’em. When tha’\ngoes to ’em in th’ mornin’s tha’ shall take a pail o’\ngood new milk an’ I’ll bake ’em a crusty cottage loaf or\nsome buns wi’ currants in ’em, same as you children like.\nNothin’s so good as fresh milk an’ bread.  Then they could\ntake off th’ edge o’ their hunger while they were in their\ngarden an’ th, fine food they get indoors ’ud polish\noff th’ corners.”",
        "“Eh! mother!” said Dickon admiringly, “what a wonder tha’\nart! Tha’ always sees a way out o’ things.  They was\nquite in a pother yesterday.  They didn’t see how they\nwas to manage without orderin’ up more food–they felt\nthat empty inside.”",
        "“They’re two young ’uns growin’ fast, an’ health’s comin’\nback to both of ’em. Children like that feels like\nyoung wolves an’ food’s flesh an’ blood to ’em,” said\nMrs. Sowerby.  Then she smiled Dickon’s own curving smile.\n\"Eh! but they’re enjoyin’ theirselves for sure,\"\nshe said.",
        "She was quite right, the comfortable wonderful mother\ncreature–and she had never been more so than when she said\ntheir “play actin’” would be their joy.  Colin and Mary found\nit one of their most thrilling sources of entertainment.\nThe idea of protecting themselves from suspicion had been\nunconsciously suggested to them first by the puzzled\nnurse and then by Dr. Craven himself.",
        "“Your appetite.  Is improving very much, Master Colin,\"\nthe nurse had said one day.  “You used to eat nothing,\nand so many things disagreed with you.”",
        "“Nothing disagrees with me now” replied Colin, and then seeing\nthe nurse looking at him curiously he suddenly remembered\nthat perhaps he ought not to appear too well just yet.\n\"At least things don’t so often disagree with me.\nIt’s the fresh air.”",
        "“Perhaps it is,” said the nurse, still looking at him with\na mystified expression.  “But I must talk to Dr. Craven\nabout it.”",
        "“How she stared at you!” said Mary when she went away.\n\"As if she thought there must be something to find out.”",
        "“I won’t have her finding out things,” said Colin.\n\"No one must begin to find out yet.” When Dr. Craven came\nthat morning he seemed puzzled, also.  He asked a number\nof questions, to Colin’s great annoyance.",
        "“You stay out in the garden a great deal,” he suggested.\n\"Where do you go?”",
        "Colin put on his favorite air of dignified indifference\nto opinion.",
        "“I will not let any one know where I go,” he answered.\n\"I go to a place I like.  Every one has orders to keep\nout of the way.  I won’t be watched and stared at.\nYou know that!”",
        "“You seem to be out all day but I do not think it has\ndone you harm–I do not think so.  The nurse says\nthat you eat much more than you have ever done before.”",
        "“Perhaps,” said Colin, prompted by a sudden inspiration,\n\"perhaps it is an unnatural appetite.”",
        "“I do not think so, as your food seems to agree with you,\"\nsaid Dr. Craven.  “You are gaining flesh rapidly and your\ncolor is better.”",
        "“Perhaps–perhaps I am bloated and feverish,” said Colin,\nassuming a discouraging air of gloom.  “People who are\nnot going to live are often–different.” Dr. Craven shook\nhis head.  He was holding Colin’s wrist and he pushed up\nhis sleeve and felt his arm.",
        "“You are not feverish,” he said thoughtfully, “and such\nflesh as you have gained is healthy.  If you can keep\nthis up, my boy, we need not talk of dying.  Your father\nwill be happy to hear of this remarkable improvement.”",
        "“I won’t have him told!” Colin broke forth fiercely.\n\"It will only disappoint him if I get worse again–and I\nmay get worse this very night.  I might have a raging fever.\nI feel as if I might be beginning to have one now.\nI won’t have letters written to my father–I won’t–I won’t!\nYou are making me angry and you know that is bad for me.\nI feel hot already.  I hate being written about and being\ntalked over as much as I hate being stared at!”",
        "“Hush-h! my boy,” Dr. Craven soothed him.  “Nothing shall\nbe written without your permission.  You are too sensitive\nabout things.  You must not undo the good which has\nbeen done.”",
        "He said no more about writing to Mr. Craven and when he saw\nthe nurse he privately warned her that such a possibility\nmust not be mentioned to the patient.",
        "“The boy is extraordinarily better,” he said.\n\"His advance seems almost abnormal.  But of course he\nis doing now of his own free will what we could not make\nhim do before.  Still, he excites himself very easily\nand nothing must be said to irritate him.” Mary and\nColin were much alarmed and talked together anxiously.\nFrom this time dated their plan of “play actin’.”",
        "“I may be obliged to have a tantrum,” said Colin regretfully.\n\"I don’t want to have one and I’m not miserable enough\nnow to work myself into a big one.  Perhaps I couldn’t have\none at all.  That lump doesn’t come in my throat now and I\nkeep thinking of nice things instead of horrible ones.\nBut if they talk about writing to my father I shall have\nto do something.”",
        "He made up his mind to eat less, but unfortunately it\nwas not possible to carry out this brilliant idea when he\nwakened each morning with an amazing appetite and the\ntable near his sofa was set with a breakfast of home-made\nbread and fresh butter, snow-white eggs, raspberry jam\nand clotted cream.  Mary always breakfasted with him\nand when they found themselves at the table–particularly\nif there were delicate slices of sizzling ham sending\nforth tempting odors from under a hot silver cover–they\nwould look into each other’s eyes in desperation.",
        "“I think we shall have to eat it all this morning,\nMary,” Colin always ended by saying.  “We can send\naway some of the lunch and a great deal of the dinner.”",
        "But they never found they could send away anything\nand the highly polished condition of the empty plates\nreturned to the pantry awakened much comment.",
        "“I do wish,” Colin would say also, “I do wish the slices\nof ham were thicker, and one muffin each is not enough\nfor any one.”",
        "“It’s enough for a person who is going to die,” answered Mary\nwhen first she heard this, “but it’s not enough for a\nperson who is going to live.  I sometimes feel as if I\ncould eat three when those nice fresh heather and gorse\nsmells from the moor come pouring in at the open window.”",
        "The morning that Dickon–after they had been enjoying\nthemselves in the garden for about two hours–went\nbehind a big rosebush and brought forth two tin pails\nand revealed that one was full of rich new milk with cream\non the top of it, and that the other held cottage-made\ncurrant buns folded in a clean blue and white napkin,\nbuns so carefully tucked in that they were still hot,\nthere was a riot of surprised joyfulness.  What a wonderful\nthing for Mrs. Sowerby to think of! What a kind,\nclever woman she must be! How good the buns were! And\nwhat delicious fresh milk!",
        "“Magic is in her just as it is in Dickon,” said Colin.\n\"It makes her think of ways to do things–nice things.\nShe is a Magic person.  Tell her we are grateful,\nDickon–extremely grateful.” He was given to using rather\ngrown-up phrases at times.  He enjoyed them.  He liked this\nso much that he improved upon it.",
        "“Tell her she has been most bounteous and our gratitude\nis extreme.”",
        "And then forgetting his grandeur he fell to and stuffed\nhimself with buns and drank milk out of the pail in copious\ndraughts in the manner of any hungry little boy who had\nbeen taking unusual exercise and breathing in moorland\nair and whose breakfast was more than two hours behind him.",
        "This was the beginning of many agreeable incidents of the\nsame kind.  They actually awoke to the fact that as Mrs. Sowerby\nhad fourteen people to provide food for she might not have\nenough to satisfy two extra appetites every day.  So they\nasked her to let them send some of their shillings to buy things.",
        "Dickon made the stimulating discovery that in the wood\nin the park outside the garden where Mary had first\nfound him piping to the wild creatures there was a deep\nlittle hollow where you could build a sort of tiny\noven with stones and roast potatoes and eggs in it.\nRoasted eggs were a previously unknown luxury and very hot\npotatoes with salt and fresh butter in them were fit for\na woodland king–besides being deliciously satisfying.\nYou could buy both potatoes and eggs and eat as many\nas you liked without feeling as if you were taking food\nout of the mouths of fourteen people.",
        "Every beautiful morning the Magic was worked by the mystic\ncircle under the plum-tree which provided a canopy\nof thickening green leaves after its brief blossom-time\nwas ended.  After the ceremony Colin always took his walking\nexercise and throughout the day he exercised his newly\nfound power at intervals.  Each day he grew stronger\nand could walk more steadily and cover more ground.\nAnd each day his belief in the Magic grew stronger–as\nwell it might.  He tried one experiment after another\nas he felt himself gaining strength and it was Dickon\nwho showed him the best things of all.",
        "“Yesterday,” he said one morning after an absence,\n\"I went to Thwaite for mother an’ near th’ Blue Cow Inn I\nseed Bob Haworth.  He’s the strongest chap on th’ moor.\nHe’s the champion wrestler an’ he can jump higher than any\nother chap an’ throw th’ hammer farther.  He’s gone all th’\nway to Scotland for th’ sports some years.  He’s knowed me\never since I was a little ’un an’ he’s a friendly sort an’\nI axed him some questions.  Th’ gentry calls him a athlete\nand I thought o’ thee, Mester Colin, and I says, `How did tha’\nmake tha’ muscles stick out that way, Bob? Did tha’\ndo anythin’ extra to make thysel’ so strong?’ An’ he says\n’Well, yes, lad, I did.  A strong man in a show that came\nto Thwaite once showed me how to exercise my arms an’\nlegs an’ every muscle in my body.  An’ I says, `Could a\ndelicate chap make himself stronger with ’em, Bob?’ an’\nhe laughed an’ says, ’Art tha’ th’ delicate chap?’ an’\nI says, `No, but I knows a young gentleman that’s gettin’\nwell of a long illness an’ I wish I knowed some o’\nthem tricks to tell him about.’ I didn’t say no names an,\nhe didn’t ask none.  He’s friendly same as I said an’\nhe stood up an’ showed me good-natured like, an’ I imitated\nwhat he did till I knowed it by heart.”",
        "Colin had been listening excitedly.",
        "“Can you show me?” he cried.  “Will you?”",
        "“Aye, to be sure,” Dickon answered, getting up.\n\"But he says tha’ mun do ’em gentle at first an’\nbe careful not to tire thysel’. Rest in between times an’\ntake deep breaths an’ don’t overdo.”",
        "“I’ll be careful,” said Colin.  “Show me! Show me! Dickon,\nyou are the most Magic boy in the world!”",
        "Dickon stood up on the grass and slowly went through a\ncarefully practical but simple series of muscle exercises.\nColin watched them with widening eyes.  He could do a few\nwhile he was sitting down.  Presently he did a few gently\nwhile he stood upon his already steadied feet.  Mary began\nto do them also.  Soot, who was watching the performance,\nbecame much disturbed and left his branch and hopped\nabout restlessly because he could not do them too.",
        "From that time the exercises were part of the day’s duties\nas much as the Magic was.  It became possible for both\nColin and Mary to do more of them each time they tried,\nand such appetites were the results that but for the basket\nDickon put down behind the bush each morning when he\narrived they would have been lost.  But the little oven\nin the hollow and Mrs. Sowerby’s bounties were so satisfying\nthat Mrs. Medlock and the nurse and Dr. Craven became\nmystified again.  You can trifle with your breakfast and\nseem to disdain your dinner if you are full to the brim\nwith roasted eggs and potatoes and richly frothed new\nmilk and oatcakes and buns and heather honey and clotted cream.",
        "“They are eating next to nothing,” said the nurse.\n\"They’ll die of starvation if they can’t be persuaded\nto take some nourishment.  And yet see how they look.”",
        "“Look!” exclaimed Mrs. Medlock indignantly.  “Eh! I’m moithered\nto death with them.  They’re a pair of young Satans.\nBursting their jackets one day and the next turning up\ntheir noses at the best meals Cook can tempt them with.\nNot a mouthful of that lovely young fowl and bread sauce\ndid they set a fork into yesterday–and the poor woman\nfair invented a pudding for them–and back it’s sent.\nShe almost cried.  She’s afraid she’ll be blamed if they\nstarve themselves into their graves.”",
        "Dr. Craven came and looked at Colin long and carefully,\nHe wore an extremely worried expression when the nurse\ntalked with him and showed him the almost untouched\ntray of breakfast she had saved for him to look at–but\nit was even more worried when he sat down by Colin’s\nsofa and examined him.  He had been called to London on\nbusiness and had not seen the boy for nearly two weeks.\nWhen young things begin to gain health they gain it rapidly.\nThe waxen tinge had left, Colins skin and a warm rose showed\nthrough it; his beautiful eyes were clear and the hollows\nunder them and in his cheeks and temples had filled out.\nHis once dark, heavy locks had begun to look as if they\nsprang healthily from his forehead and were soft and warm\nwith life.  His lips were fuller and of a normal color.\nIn fact as an imitation of a boy who was a confirmed invalid\nhe was a disgraceful sight.  Dr. Craven held his chin in his\nhand and thought him over.",
        "“I am sorry to hear that you do not eat anything,\"\nhe said.  “That will not do.  You will lose all you have\ngained –and you have gained amazingly.  You ate so well\na short time ago.”",
        "“I told you it was an unnatural appetite,” answered Colin.",
        "Mary was sitting on her stool nearby and she suddenly\nmade a very queer sound which she tried so violently\nto repress that she ended by almost choking.",
        "“What is the matter?” said Dr. Craven, turning to look\nat her.",
        "Mary became quite severe in her manner.",
        "“It was something between a sneeze and a cough,” she replied\nwith reproachful dignity, “and it got into my throat.”",
        "“But,” she said afterward to Colin, “I couldn’t stop myself.\nIt just burst out because all at once I couldn’t help\nremembering that last big potato you ate and the way\nyour mouth stretched when you bit through that thick\nlovely crust with jam and clotted cream on it.”",
        "“Is there any way in which those children can get\nfood secretly?” Dr. Craven inquired of Mrs. Medlock.",
        "“There’s no way unless they dig it out of the earth or pick\nit off the trees,” Mrs. Medlock answered.  “They stay\nout in the grounds all day and see no one but each other.\nAnd if they want anything different to eat from what’s\nsent up to them they need only ask for it.”",
        "“Well,” said Dr. Craven, “so long as going without\nfood agrees with them we need not disturb ourselves.\nThe boy is a new creature.”",
        "“So is the girl,” said Mrs. Medlock.  “She’s begun to be\ndownright pretty since she’s filled out and lost her ugly\nlittle sour look.  Her hair’s grown thick and healthy\nlooking and she’s got a bright color.  The glummest,\nill-natured little thing she used to be and now her and Master\nColin laugh together like a pair of crazy young ones.\nPerhaps they’re growing fat on that.”",
        "“Perhaps they are,” said Dr. Craven.  “Let them laugh.”",
        "And the secret garden bloomed and bloomed and every\nmorning revealed new miracles.  In the robin’s nest there\nwere Eggs and the robin’s mate sat upon them keeping them\nwarm with her feathery little breast and careful wings.\nAt first she was very nervous and the robin himself\nwas indignantly watchful.  Even Dickon did not go\nnear the close-grown corner in those days, but waited\nuntil by the quiet working of some mysterious spell he\nseemed to have conveyed to the soul of the little pair\nthat in the garden there was nothing which was not quite\nlike themselves–nothing which did not understand the\nwonderfulness of what was happening to them–the immense,\ntender, terrible, heart-breaking beauty and solemnity\nof Eggs.  If there had been one person in that garden\nwho had not known through all his or her innermost being\nthat if an Egg were taken away or hurt the whole world\nwould whirl round and crash through space and come to\nan end–if there had been even one who did not feel it\nand act accordingly there could have been no happiness\neven in that golden springtime air.  But they all knew\nit and felt it and the robin and his mate knew they knew it.",
        "At first the robin watched Mary and Colin with sharp anxiety.\nFor some mysterious reason he knew he need not watch Dickon.\nThe first moment he set his dew-bright black eye on Dickon\nhe knew he was not a stranger but a sort of robin without\nbeak or feathers.  He could speak robin (which is a quite\ndistinct language not to be mistaken for any other). To speak\nrobin to a robin is like speaking French to a Frenchman.\nDickon always spoke it to the robin himself, so the queer\ngibberish he used when he spoke to humans did not matter\nin the least.  The robin thought he spoke this gibberish\nto them because they were not intelligent enough to\nunderstand feathered speech.  His movements also were robin.\nThey never startled one by being sudden enough to seem\ndangerous or threatening.  Any robin could understand Dickon,\nso his presence was not even disturbing.",
        "But at the outset it seemed necessary to be on guard\nagainst the other two.  In the first place the boy\ncreature did not come into the garden on his legs.\nHe was pushed in on a thing with wheels and the skins\nof wild animals were thrown over him.  That in itself\nwas doubtful.  Then when he began to stand up and move\nabout he did it in a queer unaccustomed way and the\nothers seemed to have to help him.  The robin used\nto secrete himself in a bush and watch this anxiously,\nhis head tilted first on one side and then on the other.\nHe thought that the slow movements might mean that he was\npreparing to pounce, as cats do.  When cats are preparing\nto pounce they creep over the ground very slowly.\nThe robin talked this over with his mate a great deal\nfor a few days but after that he decided not to speak\nof the subject because her terror was so great that he\nwas afraid it might be injurious to the Eggs.",
        "When the boy began to walk by himself and even to move more\nquickly it was an immense relief.  But for a long time–or it\nseemed a long time to the robin–he was a source of some anxiety.\nHe did not act as the other humans did.  He seemed very\nfond of walking but he had a way of sitting or lying down\nfor a while and then getting up in a disconcerting manner to\nbegin again.",
        "One day the robin remembered that when he himself had\nbeen made to learn to fly by his parents he had done\nmuch the same sort of thing.  He had taken short flights\nof a few yards and then had been obliged to rest.\nSo it occurred to him that this boy was learning to fly–or\nrather to walk.  He mentioned this to his mate and when he\ntold her that the Eggs would probably conduct themselves\nin the same way after they were fledged she was quite\ncomforted and even became eagerly interested and derived\ngreat pleasure from watching the boy over the edge of her\nnest–though she always thought that the Eggs would be\nmuch cleverer and learn more quickly.  But then she said\nindulgently that humans were always more clumsy and slow\nthan Eggs and most of them never seemed really to learn\nto fly at all.  You never met them in the air or on tree-tops.",
        "After a while the boy began to move about as the others did,\nbut all three of the children at times did unusual things.\nThey would stand under the trees and move their arms and legs\nand heads about in a way which was neither walking nor\nrunning nor sitting down.  They went through these movements\nat intervals every day and the robin was never able to\nexplain to his mate what they were doing or tying to do.\nHe could only say that he was sure that the Eggs would\nnever flap about in such a manner; but as the boy who could\nspeak robin so fluently was doing the thing with them,\nbirds could be quite sure that the actions were not\nof a dangerous nature.  Of course neither the robin\nnor his mate had ever heard of the champion wrestler,\nBob Haworth, and his exercises for making the muscles\nstand out like lumps.  Robins are not like human beings;\ntheir muscles are always exercised from the first\nand so they develop themselves in a natural manner.\nIf you have to fly about to find every meal you eat,\nyour muscles do not become atrophied (atrophied means wasted\naway through want of use).",
        "When the boy was walking and running about and digging\nand weeding like the others, the nest in the corner was\nbrooded over by a great peace and content.  Fears for\nthe Eggs became things of the past.  Knowing that your\nEggs were as safe as if they were locked in a bank vault\nand the fact that you could watch so many curious things\ngoing on made setting a most entertaining occupation.\nOn wet days the Eggs’ mother sometimes felt even a little\ndull because the children did not come into the garden.",
        "But even on wet days it could not be said that Mary and\nColin were dull.  One morning when the rain streamed down\nunceasingly and Colin was beginning to feel a little restive,\nas he was obliged to remain on his sofa because it was\nnot safe to get up and walk about, Mary had an inspiration.",
        "“Now that I am a real boy,” Colin had said, “my legs and arms\nand all my body are so full of Magic that I can’t keep\nthem still.  They want to be doing things all the time.\nDo you know that when I waken in the morning, Mary,\nwhen it’s quite early and the birds are just shouting\noutside and everything seems just shouting for joy–even\nthe trees and things we can’t really hear–I feel as if I\nmust jump out of bed and shout myself.  If I did it,\njust think what would happen!”",
        "Mary giggled inordinately.",
        "“The nurse would come running and Mrs. Medlock would\ncome running and they would be sure you had gone crazy\nand they’d send for the doctor,” she said.",
        "Colin giggled himself.  He could see how they would\nall look–how horrified by his outbreak and how amazed\nto see him standing upright.",
        "“I wish my father would come home,” he said.  “I want\nto tell him myself.  I’m always thinking about it–but we\ncouldn’t go on like this much longer.  I can’t stand lying\nstill and pretending, and besides I look too different.\nI wish it wasn’t raining today.”",
        "It was then Mistress Mary had her inspiration.",
        "“Colin,” she began mysteriously, “do you know how many\nrooms there are in this house?”",
        "“About a thousand, I suppose,” he answered.",
        "“There’s about a hundred no one ever goes into,” said Mary.\n\"And one rainy day I went and looked into ever so many of them.\nNo one ever knew, though Mrs. Medlock nearly found me out.\nI lost my way when I was coming back and I stopped at\nthe end of your corridor.  That was the second time I\nheard you crying.”",
        "Colin started up on his sofa.",
        "“A hundred rooms no one goes into,” he said.  “It sounds\nalmost like a secret garden.  Suppose we go and look at them.\nwheel me in my chair and nobody would know we went”",
        "“That’s what I was thinking,” said Mary.  “No one would dare\nto follow us.  There are galleries where you could run.\nWe could do our exercises.  There is a little Indian\nroom where there is a cabinet full of ivory elephants.\nThere are all sorts of rooms.”",
        "“Ring the bell,” said Colin.",
        "When the nurse came in he gave his orders.",
        "“I want my chair,” he said.  “Miss Mary and I are going\nto look at the part of the house which is not used.\nJohn can push me as far as the picture-gallery because there\nare some stairs.  Then he must go away and leave us alone\nuntil I send for him again.”",
        "Rainy days lost their terrors that morning.  When the\nfootman had wheeled the chair into the picture-gallery\nand left the two together in obedience to orders,\nColin and Mary looked at each other delighted.  As soon\nas Mary had made sure that John was really on his way back\nto his own quarters below stairs, Colin got out of his chair.",
        "“I am going to run from one end of the gallery to the other,\"\nhe said, “and then I am going to jump and then we will\ndo Bob Haworth’s exercises.”",
        "And they did all these things and many others.  They looked\nat the portraits and found the plain little girl dressed\nin green brocade and holding the parrot on her finger.",
        "“All these,” said Colin, “must be my relations.\nThey lived a long time ago.  That parrot one, I believe,\nis one of my great, great, great, great aunts.  She looks\nrather like you, Mary–not as you look now but as you\nlooked when you came here.  Now you are a great deal\nfatter and better looking.”",
        "“So are you,” said Mary, and they both laughed.",
        "They went to the Indian room and amused themselves with\nthe ivory elephants.  They found the rose-colored brocade\nboudoir and the hole in the cushion the mouse had left,\nbut the mice had grown up and run away and the hole was empty.\nThey saw more rooms and made more discoveries than Mary\nhad made on her first pilgrimage.  They found new corridors\nand corners and flights of steps and new old pictures they\nliked and weird old things they did not know the use of.\nIt was a curiously entertaining morning and the feeling\nof wandering about in the same house with other people\nbut at the same time feeling as if one were miles away\nfrom them was a fascinating thing.",
        "“I’m glad we came,” Colin said.  “I never knew I\nlived in such a big queer old place.  I like it.\nWe will ramble about every rainy day.  We shall always\nbe finding new queer corners and things.”",
        "That morning they had found among other things such\ngood appetites that when they returned to Colin’s room\nit was not possible to send the luncheon away untouched.",
        "When the nurse carried the tray down-stairs she slapped it\ndown on the kitchen dresser so that Mrs. Loomis, the cook,\ncould see the highly polished dishes and plates.",
        "“Look at that!” she said.  “This is a house of mystery,\nand those two children are the greatest mysteries in it.”",
        "“If they keep that up every day,” said the strong\nyoung footman John, “there’d be small wonder that he\nweighs twice as much to-day as he did a month ago.\nI should have to give up my place in time, for fear\nof doing my muscles an injury.”",
        "That afternoon Mary noticed that something new had happened\nin Colin’s room.  She had noticed it the day before but\nhad said nothing because she thought the change might\nhave been made by chance.  She said nothing today but she\nsat and looked fixedly at the picture over the mantel.\nShe could look at it because the curtain had been drawn aside.\nThat was the change she noticed.",
        "“I know what you want me to tell you,” said Colin,\nafter she had stared a few minutes.  “I always know when\nyou want me to tell you something.  You are wondering why\nthe curtain is drawn back.  I am going to keep it like that.”",
        "“Why?” asked Mary.",
        "“Because it doesn’t make me angry any more to see her laughing.\nI wakened when it was bright moonlight two nights ago\nand felt as if the Magic was filling the room and making\neverything so splendid that I couldn’t lie still.\nI got up and looked out of the window.  The room was quite\nlight and there was a patch of moonlight on the curtain\nand somehow that made me go and pull the cord.  She looked\nright down at me as if she were laughing because she was glad\nI was standing there.  It made me like to look at her.\nI want to see her laughing like that all the time.\nI think she must have been a sort of Magic person perhaps.”",
        "“You are so like her now,” said Mary, “that sometimes I\nthink perhaps you are her ghost made into a boy.”",
        "That idea seemed to impress Colin.  He thought it over\nand then answered her slowly.",
        "“If I were her ghost–my father would be fond of me.”",
        "“Do you want him to be fond of you?” inquired Mary.",
        "“I used to hate it because he was not fond of me.  If he\ngrew fond of me I think I should tell him about the Magic.\nIt might make him more cheerful.”",
        "Their belief in the Magic was an abiding thing.\nAfter the morning’s incantations Colin sometimes gave\nthem Magic lectures.",
        "“I like to do it,” he explained, “because when I grow\nup and make great scientific discoveries I shall be\nobliged to lecture about them and so this is practise.\nI can only give short lectures now because I am very young,\nand besides Ben Weatherstaff would feel as if he were in\nchurch and he would go to sleep.”",
        "“Th’ best thing about lecturin’,” said Ben, “is that a chap can\nget up an’ say aught he pleases an’ no other chap can answer\nhim back.  I wouldn’t be agen’ lecturin’ a bit mysel’ sometimes.”",
        "But when Colin held forth under his tree old Ben fixed\ndevouring eyes on him and kept them there.  He looked\nhim over with critical affection.  It was not so much\nthe lecture which interested him as the legs which looked\nstraighter and stronger each day, the boyish head which held\nitself up so well, the once sharp chin and hollow cheeks\nwhich had filled and rounded out and the eyes which had\nbegun to hold the light he remembered in another pair.\nSometimes when Colin felt Ben’s earnest gaze meant that he\nwas much impressed he wondered what he was reflecting on\nand once when he had seemed quite entranced he questioned him.",
        "“What are you thinking about, Ben Weatherstaff?” he asked.",
        "“I was thinkin’” answered Ben, “as I’d warrant tha’s,\ngone up three or four pound this week.  I was lookin’\nat tha’ calves an’ tha’ shoulders.  I’d like to get thee\non a pair o’ scales.”",
        "“It’s the Magic and–and Mrs. Sowerby’s buns and milk\nand things,” said Colin.  “You see the scientific\nexperiment has succeeded.”",
        "That morning Dickon was too late to hear the lecture.\nWhen he came he was ruddy with running and his funny face\nlooked more twinkling than usual.  As they had a good deal\nof weeding to do after the rains they fell to work.\nThey always had plenty to do after a warm deep sinking rain.\nThe moisture which was good for the flowers was also good\nfor the weeds which thrust up tiny blades of grass and points\nof leaves which must be pulled up before their roots took\ntoo firm hold.  Colin was as good at weeding as any one\nin these days and he could lecture while he was doing it.\n\"The Magic works best when you work, yourself,” he said\nthis morning.  “You can feel it in your bones and muscles.\nI am going to read books about bones and muscles, but I am\ngoing to write a book about Magic.  I am making it up now.\nI keep finding out things.”",
        "It was not very long after he had said this that he\nlaid down his trowel and stood up on his feet.\nHe had been silent for several minutes and they had seen\nthat he was thinking out lectures, as he often did.\nWhen he dropped his trowel and stood upright it seemed\nto Mary and Dickon as if a sudden strong thought had made\nhim do it.  He stretched himself out to his tallest height\nand he threw out his arms exultantly.  Color glowed in\nhis face and his strange eyes widened with joyfulness.\nAll at once he had realized something to the full.",
        "“Mary! Dickon!” he cried.  “Just look at me!”",
        "They stopped their weeding and looked at him.",
        "“Do you remember that first morning you brought me in here?\"\nhe demanded.",
        "Dickon was looking at him very hard.  Being an animal\ncharmer he could see more things than most people could\nand many of them were things he never talked about.\nHe saw some of them now in this boy.  “Aye, that we do,\"\nhe answered.",
        "Mary looked hard too, but she said nothing.",
        "“Just this minute,” said Colin, “all at once I remembered\nit myself–when I looked at my hand digging with the\ntrowel–and I had to stand up on my feet to see if it\nwas real.  And it is real! I’m well–I’m well!”",
        "“Aye, that th’ art!” said Dickon.",
        "“I’m well! I’m well!” said Colin again, and his face went\nquite red all over.",
        "He had known it before in a way, he had hoped it and felt\nit and thought about it, but just at that minute something\nhad rushed all through him–a sort of rapturous belief\nand realization and it had been so strong that he could\nnot help calling out.",
        "“I shall live forever and ever and ever!” he cried grandly.\n\"I shall find out thousands and thousands of things.\nI shall find out about people and creatures and everything\nthat grows–like Dickon–and I shall never stop making Magic.\nI’m well! I’m well! I feel–I feel as if I want to shout\nout something–something thankful, joyful!”",
        "Ben Weatherstaff, who had been working near a rose-bush,\nglanced round at him.",
        "“Tha’ might sing th’ Doxology,” he suggested in his\ndryest grunt.  He had no opinion of the Doxology and he\ndid not make the suggestion with any particular reverence.",
        "But Colin was of an exploring mind and he knew nothing\nabout the Doxology.",
        "“What is that?” he inquired.",
        "“Dickon can sing it for thee, I’ll warrant,\"\nreplied Ben Weatherstaff.",
        "Dickon answered with his all-perceiving animal charmer’s smile.",
        "“They sing it i’ church,” he said.  “Mother says she\nbelieves th’ skylarks sings it when they gets up i’ th’ mornin’.”",
        "“If she says that, it must be a nice song,” Colin answered.\n\"I’ve never been in a church myself.  I was always too ill.\nSing it, Dickon.  I want to hear it.”",
        "Dickon was quite simple and unaffected about it.\nHe understood what Colin felt better than Colin did himself.\nHe understood by a sort of instinct so natural that he\ndid not know it was understanding.  He pulled off his cap\nand looked round still smiling.",
        "“Tha’ must take off tha’ cap,” he said to Colin,\"\nan’ so mun tha’, Ben–an’ tha’ mun stand up, tha’ knows.”",
        "Colin took off his cap and the sun shone on and warmed his\nthick hair as he watched Dickon intently.  Ben Weatherstaff\nscrambled up from his knees and bared his head too with\na sort of puzzled half-resentful look on his old face\nas if he didn’t know exactly why he was doing this remarkable\nthing.",
        "Dickon stood out among the trees and rose-bushes\nand began to sing in quite a simple matter-of-fact\nway and in a nice strong boy voice:",
        "         “Praise God from whom all blessings flow,\n         Praise Him all creatures here below,\n         Praise Him above ye Heavenly Host,\n         Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.\n                     Amen.”",
        "When he had finished, Ben Weatherstaff was standing\nquite still with his jaws set obstinately but with a\ndisturbed look in his eyes fixed on Colin.  Colin’s face\nwas thoughtful and appreciative.",
        "“It is a very nice song,” he said.  “I like it.  Perhaps it\nmeans just what I mean when I want to shout out that I am\nthankful to the Magic.” He stopped and thought in a puzzled way.\n\"Perhaps they are both the same thing.  How can we know\nthe exact names of everything? Sing it again, Dickon.\nLet us try, Mary.  I want to sing it, too.  It’s my song.\nHow does it begin? `Praise God from whom all blessings flow’?”",
        "And they sang it again, and Mary and Colin lifted their\nvoices as musically as they could and Dickon’s swelled quite\nloud and beautiful–and at the second line Ben Weatherstaff\nraspingly cleared his throat and at the third line he joined\nin with such vigor that it seemed almost savage and when\nthe “Amen” came to an end Mary observed that the very same\nthing had happened to him which had happened when he found\nout that Colin was not a cripple–his chin was twitching\nand he was staring and winking and his leathery old cheeks were\nwet.",
        "“I never seed no sense in th’ Doxology afore,” he said hoarsely,\n\"but I may change my mind i’ time.  I should say tha’d\ngone up five pound this week Mester Colin–five on ’em!”",
        "Colin was looking across the garden at something attracting\nhis attention and his expression had become a startled one.",
        "“Who is coming in here?” he said quickly.  “Who is it?”",
        "The door in the ivied wall had been pushed gently open\nand a woman had entered.  She had come in with the last\nline of their song and she had stood still listening and\nlooking at them.  With the ivy behind her, the sunlight\ndrifting through the trees and dappling her long blue cloak,\nand her nice fresh face smiling across the greenery\nshe was rather like a softly colored illustration in\none of Colin’s books.  She had wonderful affectionate\neyes which seemed to take everything in–all of them,\neven Ben Weatherstaff and the “creatures” and every flower\nthat was in bloom.  Unexpectedly as she had appeared,\nnot one of them felt that she was an intruder at all.\nDickon’s eyes lighted like lamps.",
        "“It’s mother–that’s who it is!” he cried and went across\nthe grass at a run.",
        "Colin began to move toward her, too, and Mary went with him.\nThey both felt their pulses beat faster.",
        "“It’s mother!” Dickon said again when they met halfway.\n\"I knowed tha’ wanted to see her an’ I told her where th’\ndoor was hid.”",
        "Colin held out his hand with a sort of flushed royal\nshyness but his eyes quite devoured her face.",
        "“Even when I was ill I wanted to see you,” he said,\n\"you and Dickon and the secret garden.  I’d never wanted\nto see any one or anything before.”",
        "The sight of his uplifted face brought about a sudden\nchange in her own.  She flushed and the corners of her\nmouth shook and a mist seemed to sweep over her eyes.",
        "“Eh! dear lad!” she broke out tremulously.  “Eh! dear lad!\"\nas if she had not known she were going to say it.  She did\nnot say, “Mester Colin,” but just “dear lad” quite suddenly.\nShe might have said it to Dickon in the same way if she\nhad seen something in his face which touched her.\nColin liked it.",
        "“Are you surprised because I am so well?” he asked.\nShe put her hand on his shoulder and smiled the mist\nout of her eyes.  “Aye, that I am!” she said; “but tha’rt\nso like thy mother tha’ made my heart jump.”",
        "“Do you think,” said Colin a little awkwardly, “that will\nmake my father like me?”",
        "“Aye, for sure, dear lad,” she answered and she gave\nhis shoulder a soft quick pat.  “He mun come home–he\nmun come home.”",
        "“Susan Sowerby,” said Ben Weatherstaff, getting close\nto her.  “Look at th’ lad’s legs, wilt tha’? They was\nlike drumsticks i’ stockin’ two month’ ago–an’ I heard\nfolk tell as they was bandy an’ knock-kneed both at th’\nsame time.  Look at ’em now!”",
        "Susan Sowerby laughed a comfortable laugh.",
        "“They’re goin’ to be fine strong lad’s legs in a bit,\"\nshe said.  “Let him go on playin’ an’ workin’ in the garden an’\neatin’ hearty an’ drinkin’ plenty o’ good sweet milk an’\nthere’ll not be a finer pair i’ Yorkshire, thank God for it.”",
        "She put both hands on Mistress Mary’s shoulders and looked\nher little face over in a motherly fashion.",
        "“An’ thee, too!” she said.  “Tha’rt grown near as hearty\nas our ’Lisabeth Ellen.  I’ll warrant tha’rt like thy\nmother too.  Our Martha told me as Mrs. Medlock heard she\nwas a pretty woman.  Tha’lt be like a blush rose when tha’\ngrows up, my little lass, bless thee.”",
        "She did not mention that when Martha came home on her\n\"day out” and described the plain sallow child she had said\nthat she had no confidence whatever in what Mrs. Medlock\nhad heard.  “It doesn’t stand to reason that a pretty\nwoman could be th’ mother o’ such a fou’ little lass,\"\nshe had added obstinately.",
        "Mary had not had time to pay much attention to her\nchanging face.  She had only known that she looked\n\"different” and seemed to have a great deal more hair\nand that it was growing very fast.  But remembering\nher pleasure in looking at the Mem Sahib in the past\nshe was glad to hear that she might some day look like her.",
        "Susan Sowerby went round their garden with them and was\ntold the whole story of it and shown every bush and tree\nwhich had come alive.  Colin walked on one side of her\nand Mary on the other.  Each of them kept looking up\nat her comfortable rosy face, secretly curious about\nthe delightful feeling she gave them–a sort of warm,\nsupported feeling.  It seemed as if she understood them\nas Dickon understood his “creatures.” She stooped over the\nflowers and talked about them as if they were children.\nSoot followed her and once or twice cawed at her and flew\nupon her shoulder as if it were Dickon’s. When they told\nher about the robin and the first flight of the young ones\nshe laughed a motherly little mellow laugh in her throat.",
        "“I suppose learnin’ ’em to fly is like learnin’\nchildren to walk, but I’m feared I should be all\nin a worrit if mine had wings instead o’ legs,” she said.",
        "It was because she seemed such a wonderful woman in her\nnice moorland cottage way that at last she was told\nabout the Magic.",
        "“Do you believe in Magic?” asked Colin after he had\nexplained about Indian fakirs.  “I do hope you do.”",
        "“That I do, lad,” she answered.  “I never knowed it by\nthat name but what does th’ name matter? I warrant they\ncall it a different name i’ France an’ a different one i’\nGermany.  Th’ same thing as set th’ seeds swellin’ an’ th’\nsun shinin’ made thee a well lad an’ it’s th’ Good Thing.\nIt isn’t like us poor fools as think it matters if us is\ncalled out of our names.  Th’ Big Good Thing doesn’t stop\nto worrit, bless thee.  It goes on makin’ worlds by th’\nmillion–worlds like us.  Never thee stop believin’ in th’\nBig Good Thing an’ knowin’ th’ world’s full of it–an’\ncall it what tha’ likes.  Tha’ wert singin’ to it when I\ncome into th’ garden.”",
        "“I felt so joyful,” said Colin, opening his beautiful\nstrange eyes at her.  “Suddenly I felt how different I\nwas–how strong my arms and legs were, you know–and\nhow I could dig and stand–and I jumped up and wanted\nto shout out something to anything that would listen.”",
        "“Th’ Magic listened when tha’ sung th’ Doxology.\nIt would ha’ listened to anything tha’d sung.  It was th’\njoy that mattered.  Eh! lad, lad–what’s names to th’\nJoy Maker,” and she gave his shoulders a quick soft\npat again.",
        "She had packed a basket which held a regular feast\nthis morning, and when the hungry hour came and Dickon\nbrought it out from its hiding place, she sat down with\nthem under their tree and watched them devour their food,\nlaughing and quite gloating over their appetites.  She was\nfull of fun and made them laugh at all sorts of odd things.\nShe told them stories in broad Yorkshire and taught them\nnew words.  She laughed as if she could not help it\nwhen they told her of the increasing difficulty there\nwas in pretending that Colin was still a fretful invalid.",
        "“You see we can’t help laughing nearly all the time\nwhen we are together,” explained Colin.  “And it\ndoesn’t sound ill at all.  We try to choke it back\nbut it will burst out and that sounds worse than ever.”",
        "“There’s one thing that comes into my mind so often,\"\nsaid Mary, “and I can scarcely ever hold in when I think\nof it suddenly.  I keep thinking suppose Colin’s face\nshould get to look like a full moon.  It isn’t like one\nyet but he gets a tiny bit fatter every day–and suppose\nsome morning it should look like one–what should we do!”",
        "“Bless us all, I can see tha’ has a good bit o’ play actin’\nto do,” said Susan Sowerby.  “But tha’ won’t have to keep\nit up much longer.  Mester Craven’ll come home.”",
        "“Do you think he will?” asked Colin.  “Why?”",
        "Susan Sowerby chuckled softly.",
        "“I suppose it ’ud nigh break thy heart if he found\nout before tha’ told him in tha’ own way,” she said.\n\"Tha’s laid awake nights plannin’ it.”",
        "“I couldn’t bear any one else to tell him,” said Colin.\n\"I think about different ways every day, I think now I\njust want to run into his room.” “That’d be a fine\nstart for him,” said Susan Sowerby.  “I’d like to see\nhis face, lad.  I would that! He mun come back–that\nhe mun.”",
        "One of the things they talked of was the visit they\nwere to make to her cottage.  They planned it all.\nThey were to drive over the moor and lunch out of doors\namong the heather.  They would see all the twelve children\nand Dickon’s garden and would not come back until they\nwere tired.",
        "Susan Sowerby got up at last to return to the house\nand Mrs. Medlock.  It was time for Colin to be wheeled\nback also.  But before he got into his chair he stood\nquite close to Susan and fixed his eyes on her with a\nkind of bewildered adoration and he suddenly caught\nhold of the fold of her blue cloak and held it fast.",
        "“You are just what I–what I wanted,” he said.  “I wish\nyou were my mother–as well as Dickon’s!”",
        "All at once Susan Sowerby bent down and drew him\nwith her warm arms close against the bosom under\nthe blue cloak–as if he had been Dickon’s brother.\nThe quick mist swept over her eyes.",
        "“Eh! dear lad!” she said.  “Thy own mother’s in this ’ere\nvery garden, I do believe.  She couldna’ keep out of it.\nThy father mun come back to thee–he mun!”",
        "In each century since the beginning of the world wonderful\nthings have been discovered.  In the last century more\namazing things were found out than in any century before.\nIn this new century hundreds of things still more\nastounding will be brought to light.  At first people\nrefuse to believe that a strange new thing can be done,\nthen they begin to hope it can be done, then they see it\ncan be done–then it is done and all the world wonders\nwhy it was not done centuries ago.  One of the new things\npeople began to find out in the last century was that\nthoughts–just mere thoughts–are as powerful as electric\nbatteries–as good for one as sunlight is, or as bad\nfor one as poison.  To let a sad thought or a bad one get\ninto your mind is as dangerous as letting a scarlet fever\ngerm get into your body.  If you let it stay there after\nit has got in you may never get over it as long as you live.",
        "So long as Mistress Mary’s mind was full of disagreeable\nthoughts about her dislikes and sour opinions of people\nand her determination not to be pleased by or interested\nin anything, she was a yellow-faced, sickly, bored and\nwretched child.  Circumstances, however, were very\nkind to her, though she was not at all aware of it.\nThey began to push her about for her own good.  When her\nmind gradually filled itself with robins, and moorland\ncottages crowded with children, with queer crabbed\nold gardeners and common little Yorkshire housemaids,\nwith springtime and with secret gardens coming alive day\nby day, and also with a moor boy and his “creatures,” there\nwas no room left for the disagreeable thoughts which affected\nher liver and her digestion and made her yellow and tired.",
        "So long as Colin shut himself up in his room and thought\nonly of his fears and weakness and his detestation\nof people who looked at him and reflected hourly on\nhumps and early death, he was a hysterical half-crazy\nlittle hypochondriac who knew nothing of the sunshine\nand the spring and also did not know that he could get\nwell and could stand upon his feet if he tried to do it.\nWhen new beautiful thoughts began to push out the old\nhideous ones, life began to come back to him, his blood ran\nhealthily through his veins and strength poured into him\nlike a flood.  His scientific experiment was quite practical\nand simple and there was nothing weird about it at all.\nMuch more surprising things can happen to any one who,\nwhen a disagreeable or discouraged thought comes into his mind,\njust has the sense to remember in time and push it out\nby putting in an agreeable determinedly courageous one.\nTwo things cannot be in one place.",

        "While the secret garden was coming alive and two children\nwere coming alive with it, there was a man wandering about\ncertain far-away beautiful places in the Norwegian fiords\nand the valleys and mountains of Switzerland and he was\na man who for ten years had kept his mind filled with dark\nand heart-broken thinking.  He had not been courageous;\nhe had never tried to put any other thoughts in the place of\nthe dark ones.  He had wandered by blue lakes and thought them;\nhe had lain on mountain-sides with sheets of deep blue\ngentians blooming all about him and flower breaths filling\nall the air and he had thought them.  A terrible sorrow\nhad fallen upon him when he had been happy and he had\nlet his soul fill itself with blackness and had refused\nobstinately to allow any rift of light to pierce through.\nHe had forgotten and deserted his home and his duties.\nWhen he traveled about, darkness so brooded over him that\nthe sight of him was a wrong done to other people because\nit was as if he poisoned the air about him with gloom.\nMost strangers thought he must be either half mad or a man\nwith some hidden crime on his soul.  He, was a tall man\nwith a drawn face and crooked shoulders and the name he\nalways entered on hotel registers was, “Archibald Craven,\nMisselthwaite Manor, Yorkshire, England.”",
        "He had traveled far and wide since the day he saw Mistress\nMary in his study and told her she might have her “bit\nof earth.” He had been in the most beautiful places in Europe,\nthough he had remained nowhere more than a few days.\nHe had chosen the quietest and remotest spots.\nHe had been on the tops of mountains whose heads were\nin the clouds and had looked down on other mountains\nwhen the sun rose and touched them with such light\nas made it seem as if the world were just being born.",
        "But the light had never seemed to touch himself until\none day when he realized that for the first time in ten\nyears a strange thing had happened.  He was in a wonderful\nvalley in the Austrian Tyrol and he had been walking alone\nthrough such beauty as might have lifted, any man’s soul\nout of shadow.  He had walked a long way and it had not\nlifted his.  But at last he had felt tired and had thrown\nhimself down to rest on a carpet of moss by a stream.\nIt was a clear little stream which ran quite merrily along\non its narrow way through the luscious damp greenness.\nSometimes it made a sound rather like very low laughter\nas it bubbled over and round stones.  He saw birds\ncome and dip their heads to drink in it and then flick\ntheir wings and fly away.  It seemed like a thing alive\nand yet its tiny voice made the stillness seem deeper.\nThe valley was very, very still.",
        "As he sat gazing into the clear running of the water,\nArchibald Craven gradually felt his mind and body\nboth grow quiet, as quiet as the valley itself.\nHe wondered if he were going to sleep, but he was not.\nHe sat and gazed at the sunlit water and his eyes began\nto see things growing at its edge.  There was one lovely\nmass of blue forget-me-nots growing so close to the stream\nthat its leaves were wet and at these he found himself looking\nas he remembered he had looked at such things years ago.\nHe was actually thinking tenderly how lovely it was and\nwhat wonders of blue its hundreds of little blossoms were.\nHe did not know that just that simple thought was slowly\nfilling his mind–filling and filling it until other things\nwere softly pushed aside.  It was as if a sweet clear\nspring had begun to rise in a stagnant pool and had risen\nand risen until at last it swept the dark water away.\nBut of course he did not think of this himself.  He only\nknew that the valley seemed to grow quieter and quieter\nas he sat and stared at the bright delicate blueness.\nHe did not know how long he sat there or what was happening\nto him, but at last he moved as if he were awakening\nand he got up slowly and stood on the moss carpet,\ndrawing a long, deep, soft breath and wondering at himself.\nSomething seemed to have been unbound and released in him,\nvery quietly.",
        "“What is it?” he said, almost in a whisper, and he passed\nhis hand over his forehead.  “I almost feel as if–I\nwere alive!”",
        "I do not know enough about the wonderfulness of undiscovered\nthings to be able to explain how this had happened to him.\nNeither does any one else yet.  He did not understand\nat all himself–but he remembered this strange hour\nmonths afterward when he was at Misselthwaite again\nand he found out quite by accident that on this very day\nColin had cried out as he went into the secret garden:",
        "“I am going to live forever and ever and ever!”",
        "The singular calmness remained with him the rest of the\nevening and he slept a new reposeful sleep; but it was\nnot with him very long.  He did not know that it could\nbe kept.  By the next night he had opened the doors\nwide to his dark thoughts and they had come trooping\nand rushing back.  He left the valley and went on his\nwandering way again.  But, strange as it seemed to him,\nthere were minutes–sometimes half-hours–when, without\nhis knowing why, the black burden seemed to lift itself\nagain and he knew he was a living man and not a dead one.\nSlowly–slowly–for no reason that he knew of–he was\n\"coming alive” with the garden.",
        "As the golden summer changed into the deep golden autumn he\nwent to the Lake of Como.  There he found the loveliness\nof a dream.  He spent his days upon the crystal blueness\nof the lake or he walked back into the soft thick verdure\nof the hills and tramped until he was tired so that he\nmight sleep.  But by this time he had begun to sleep better,\nhe knew, and his dreams had ceased to be a terror to him.",
        "“Perhaps,” he thought, “my body is growing stronger.”",
        "It was growing stronger but–because of the rare\npeaceful hours when his thoughts were changed–his soul\nwas slowly growing stronger, too.  He began to think\nof Misselthwaite and wonder if he should not go home.\nNow and then he wondered vaguely about his boy and asked\nhimself what he should feel when he went and stood\nby the carved four-posted bed again and looked down at\nthe sharply chiseled ivory-white face while it slept and,\nthe black lashes rimmed so startlingly the close-shut eyes.\nHe shrank from it.",
        "One marvel of a day he had walked so far that when he\nreturned the moon was high and full and all the world\nwas purple shadow and silver.  The stillness of lake\nand shore and wood was so wonderful that he did not go\ninto the villa he lived in.  He walked down to a little\nbowered terrace at the water’s edge and sat upon a seat\nand breathed in all the heavenly scents of the night.\nHe felt the strange calmness stealing over him and it grew\ndeeper and deeper until he fell asleep.",
        "He did not know when he fell asleep and when he began\nto dream; his dream was so real that he did not feel\nas if he were dreaming.  He remembered afterward how\nintensely wide awake and alert he had thought he was.\nHe thought that as he sat and breathed in the scent of\nthe late roses and listened to the lapping of the water\nat his feet he heard a voice calling.  It was sweet\nand clear and happy and far away.  It seemed very far,\nbut he heard it as distinctly as if it had been at his\nvery side.",
        "“Archie! Archie! Archie!” it said, and then again,\nsweeter and clearer than before, “Archie! Archie!”",
        "He thought he sprang to his feet not even startled.\nIt was such a real voice and it seemed so natural that he\nshould hear it.",
        "“Lilias! Lilias!” he answered.  “Lilias! where are you?”",
        "“In the garden,” it came back like a sound from\na golden flute.  “In the garden!”",
        "And then the dream ended.  But he did not awaken.\nHe slept soundly and sweetly all through the lovely night.\nWhen he did awake at last it was brilliant morning and a\nservant was standing staring at him.  He was an Italian\nservant and was accustomed, as all the servants of the\nvilla were, to accepting without question any strange thing\nhis foreign master might do.  No one ever knew when he\nwould go out or come in or where he would choose to sleep\nor if he would roam about the garden or lie in the boat\non the lake all night.  The man held a salver with some\nletters on it and he waited quietly until Mr. Craven\ntook them.  When he had gone away Mr. Craven sat a few\nmoments holding them in his hand and looking at the lake.\nHis strange calm was still upon him and something more–a\nlightness as if the cruel thing which had been done had\nnot happened as he thought–as if something had changed.\nHe was remembering the dream–the real–real dream.",
        "“In the garden!” he said, wondering at himself.  “In the\ngarden! But the door is locked and the key is buried deep.”",
        "When he glanced at the letters a few minutes later he\nsaw that the one lying at the top of the rest was an\nEnglish letter and came from Yorkshire.  It was directed\nin a plain woman’s hand but it was not a hand he knew.\nHe opened it, scarcely thinking of the writer, but the\nfirst words attracted his attention at once.",
        "“Dear Sir:",
        "I am Susan Sowerby that made bold to speak to you\nonce on the moor.  It was about Miss Mary I spoke.\nI will make bold to speak again.  Please, sir, I would\ncome home if I was you.  I think you would be glad to come\nand–if you will excuse me, sir–I think your lady would\nask you to come if she was here.",
        "                      Your obedient servant,\n                      Susan Sowerby.”",
        "Mr. Craven read the letter twice before he put it back\nin its envelope.  He kept thinking about the dream.",
        "“I will go back to Misselthwaite,” he said.  “Yes, I’ll\ngo at once.”",
        "And he went through the garden to the villa and ordered\nPitcher to prepare for his return to England.",
        "In a few days he was in Yorkshire again, and on his long\nrailroad journey he found himself thinking of his boy\nas he had never thought in all the ten years past.\nDuring those years he had only wished to forget him.\nNow, though he did not intend to think about him,\nmemories of him constantly drifted into his mind.\nHe remembered the black days when he had raved like a madman\nbecause the child was alive and the mother was dead.\nHe had refused to see it, and when he had gone to look\nat it at last it had been, such a weak wretched thing\nthat everyone had been sure it would die in a few days.\nBut to the surprise of those who took care of it the days\npassed and it lived and then everyone believed it would be a\ndeformed and crippled creature.",
        "He had not meant to be a bad father, but he had not felt\nlike a father at all.  He had supplied doctors and nurses\nand luxuries, but he had shrunk from the mere thought\nof the boy and had buried himself in his own misery.\nThe first time after a year’s absence he returned\nto Misselthwaite and the small miserable looking thing\nlanguidly and indifferently lifted to his face the great\ngray eyes with black lashes round them, so like and yet\nso horribly unlike the happy eyes he had adored, he could\nnot bear the sight of them and turned away pale as death.\nAfter that he scarcely ever saw him except when he was asleep,\nand all he knew of him was that he was a confirmed invalid,\nwith a vicious, hysterical, half-insane temper.  He could\nonly be kept from furies dangerous to himself by being\ngiven his own way in every detail.",
        "All this was not an uplifting thing to recall, but as\nthe train whirled him through mountain passes and golden\nplains the man who was “coming alive” began to think\nin a new way and he thought long and steadily and deeply.",
        "“Perhaps I have been all wrong for ten years,\"\nhe said to himself.  “Ten years is a long time.\nIt may be too late to do anything–quite too late.\nWhat have I been thinking of!”",
        "Of course this was the wrong Magic–to begin by saying\n\"too late.” Even Colin could have told him that.\nBut he knew nothing of Magic–either black or white.\nThis he had yet to learn.  He wondered if Susan Sowerby\nhad taken courage and written to him only because the\nmotherly creature had realized that the boy was much\nworse–was fatally ill.  If he had not been under the\nspell of the curious calmness which had taken possession\nof him he would have been more wretched than ever.\nBut the calm had brought a sort of courage and hope with it.\nInstead of giving way to thoughts of the worst he actually\nfound he was trying to believe in better things.",
        "“Could it be possible that she sees that I may be able\nto do him good and control him?” he thought.  “I will go\nand see her on my way to Misselthwaite.”",
        "But when on his way across the moor he stopped the carriage\nat the cottage, seven or eight children who were playing\nabout gathered in a group and bobbing seven or eight\nfriendly and polite curtsies told him that their mother\nhad gone to the other side of the moor early in the morning\nto help a woman who had a new baby.  “Our Dickon,\"\nthey volunteered, was over at the Manor working in one\nof the gardens where he went several days each week.",
        "Mr. Craven looked over the collection of sturdy little\nbodies and round red-cheeked faces, each one grinning\nin its own particular way, and he awoke to the fact\nthat they were a healthy likable lot.  He smiled at their\nfriendly grins and took a golden sovereign from his pocket\nand gave it to “our ’Lizabeth Ellen” who was the oldest.",
        "“If you divide that into eight parts there will be half\na crown for each of, you,” he said.",
        "Then amid grins and chuckles and bobbing of curtsies he\ndrove away, leaving ecstasy and nudging elbows and little\njumps of joy behind.",
        "The drive across the wonderfulness of the moor was\na soothing thing.  Why did it seem to give him a sense\nof homecoming which he had been sure he could never feel\nagain–that sense of the beauty of land and sky and purple\nbloom of distance and a warming of the heart at drawing,\nnearer to the great old house which had held those of\nhis blood for six hundred years? How he had driven\naway from it the last time, shuddering to think of its\nclosed rooms and the boy lying in the four-posted bed\nwith the brocaded hangings.  Was it possible that perhaps\nhe might find him changed a little for the better\nand that he might overcome his shrinking from him?\nHow real that dream had been–how wonderful and clear\nthe voice which called back to him, “In the garden–In the\ngarden!”",
        "“I will try to find the key,” he said.  “I will try\nto open the door.  I must–though I don’t know why.”",
        "When he arrived at the Manor the servants who\nreceived him with the usual ceremony noticed that he\nlooked better and that he did not go to the remote\nrooms where he usually lived attended by Pitcher.\nHe went into the library and sent for Mrs. Medlock.\nShe came to him somewhat excited and curious and flustered.",
        "“How is Master Colin, Medlock?” he inquired.  “Well, sir,\"\nMrs. Medlock answered, “he’s–he’s different, in a manner\nof speaking.”",
        "“Worse?” he suggested.",
        "Mrs. Medlock really was flushed.",
        "“Well, you see, sir,” she tried to explain, “neither\nDr. Craven, nor the nurse, nor me can exactly make him out.”",
        "“Why is that?”",
        "“To tell the truth, sir, Master Colin might be better\nand he might be changing for the worse.  His appetite,\nsir, is past understanding–and his ways–”",
        "“Has he become more–more peculiar?” her master, asked,\nknitting his brows anxiously.",
        "“That’s it, sir.  He’s growing very peculiar–when you\ncompare him with what he used to be.  He used to eat nothing\nand then suddenly he began to eat something enormous–and\nthen he stopped again all at once and the meals were sent\nback just as they used to be.  You never knew, sir, perhaps,\nthat out of doors he never would let himself be taken.\nThe things we’ve gone through to get him to go out in\nhis chair would leave a body trembling like a leaf.\nHe’d throw himself into such a state that Dr. Craven said\nhe couldn’t be responsible for forcing him.  Well, sir,\njust without warning–not long after one of his worst\ntantrums he suddenly insisted on being taken out every day\nby Miss Mary and Susan Sowerby’s boy Dickon that could push\nhis chair.  He took a fancy to both Miss Mary and Dickon,\nand Dickon brought his tame animals, and, if you’ll\ncredit it, sir, out of doors he will stay from morning until\nnight.”",
        "“How does he look?” was the next question.",
        "“If he took his food natural, sir, you’d think he was putting\non flesh–but we’re afraid it may be a sort of bloat.\nHe laughs sometimes in a queer way when he’s alone with\nMiss Mary.  He never used to laugh at all.  Dr. Craven\nis coming to see you at once, if you’ll allow him.\nHe never was as puzzled in his life.”",
        "“Where is Master Colin now?” Mr. Craven asked.",
        "“In the garden, sir.  He’s always in the garden–though\nnot a human creature is allowed to go near for fear\nthey’ll look at him.”",
        "Mr. Craven scarcely heard her last words.",
        "“In the garden,” he said, and after he had sent Mrs. Medlock\naway he stood and repeated it again and again.\n\"In the garden!”",
        "He had to make an effort to bring himself back to\nthe place he was standing in and when he felt he was\non earth again he turned and went out of the room.\nHe took his way, as Mary had done, through the door in the\nshrubbery and among the laurels and the fountain beds.\nThe fountain was playing now and was encircled by beds\nof brilliant autumn flowers.  He crossed the lawn and\nturned into the Long Walk by the ivied walls.  He did not\nwalk quickly, but slowly, and his eyes were on the path.\nHe felt as if he were being drawn back to the place\nhe had so long forsaken, and he did not know why.\nAs he drew near to it his step became still more slow.\nHe knew where the door was even though the ivy hung thick\nover it–but he did not know exactly where it lay–that\nburied key.",
        "So he stopped and stood still, looking about him,\nand almost the moment after he had paused he started\nand listened–asking himself if he were walking in a dream.",
        "The ivy hung thick over the door, the key was buried\nunder the shrubs, no human being had passed that portal\nfor ten lonely years–and yet inside the garden there\nwere sounds.  They were the sounds of running scuffling\nfeet seeming to chase round and round under the trees,\nthey were strange sounds of lowered suppressed\nvoices–exclamations and smothered joyous cries.\nIt seemed actually like the laughter of young things,\nthe uncontrollable laughter of children who were trying not\nto be heard but who in a moment or so–as their excitement\nmounted–would burst forth.  What in heaven’s name was he\ndreaming of–what in heaven’s name did he hear? Was he\nlosing his reason and thinking he heard things which were\nnot for human ears? Was it that the far clear voice had meant?",
        "And then the moment came, the uncontrollable moment\nwhen the sounds forgot to hush themselves.  The feet ran\nfaster and faster–they were nearing the garden door–there\nwas quick strong young breathing and a wild outbreak\nof laughing shows which could not be contained–and the\ndoor in the wall was flung wide open, the sheet of ivy\nswinging back, and a boy burst through it at full speed and,\nwithout seeing the outsider, dashed almost into his arms.",
        "Mr. Craven had extended them just in time to save him\nfrom falling as a result of his unseeing dash against him,\nand when he held him away to look at him in amazement\nat his being there he truly gasped for breath.",
        "He was a tall boy and a handsome one.  He was glowing\nwith life and his running had sent splendid color leaping\nto his face.  He threw the thick hair back from his forehead\nand lifted a pair of strange gray eyes–eyes full of boyish\nlaughter and rimmed with black lashes like a fringe.\nIt was the eyes which made Mr. Craven gasp for breath.\n\"Who–What? Who!” he stammered.",
        "This was not what Colin had expected–this was not what he\nhad planned.  He had never thought of such a meeting.\nAnd yet to come dashing out–winning a race–perhaps it\nwas even better.  He drew himself up to his very tallest.\nMary, who had been running with him and had dashed through\nthe door too, believed that he managed to make himself\nlook taller than he had ever looked before–inches taller.",
        "“Father,” he said, “I’m Colin.  You can’t believe it.\nI scarcely can myself.  I’m Colin.”",
        "Like Mrs. Medlock, he did not understand what his father\nmeant when he said hurriedly:",
        "“In the garden! In the garden!”",
        "“Yes,” hurried on Colin.  “It was the garden that did\nit–and Mary and Dickon and the creatures–and the Magic.\nNo one knows.  We kept it to tell you when you came.\nI’m well, I can beat Mary in a race.  I’m going to be\nan athlete.”",
        "He said it all so like a healthy boy–his face flushed,\nhis words tumbling over each other in his eagerness–that\nMr. Craven’s soul shook with unbelieving joy.",
        "Colin put out his hand and laid it on his father’s arm.",
        "“Aren’t you glad, Father?” he ended.  “Aren’t you glad?\nI’m going to live forever and ever and ever!”",
        "Mr. Craven put his hands on both the boy’s shoulders\nand held him still.  He knew he dared not even try\nto speak for a moment.",
        "“Take me into the garden, my boy,” he said at last.\n\"And tell me all about it.”",
        "And so they led him in.",
        "The place was a wilderness of autumn gold and purple\nand violet blue and flaming scarlet and on every side were\nsheaves of late lilies standing together–lilies which were\nwhite or white and ruby.  He remembered well when the\nfirst of them had been planted that just at this season\nof the year their late glories should reveal themselves.\nLate roses climbed and hung and clustered and the sunshine\ndeepening the hue of the yellowing trees made one feel\nthat one, stood in an embowered temple of gold.\nThe newcomer stood silent just as the children had done\nwhen they came into its grayness.  He looked round and round.",
        "“I thought it would be dead,” he said.”",
        "“Mary thought so at first,” said Colin.  “But it came alive.”",
        "Then they sat down under their tree–all but Colin,\nwho wanted to stand while he told the story.",
        "It was the strangest thing he had ever heard, Archibald Craven\nthought, as it was poured forth in headlong boy fashion.\nMystery and Magic and wild creatures, the weird midnight\nmeeting–the coming of the spring–the passion of insulted\npride which had dragged the young Rajah to his feet to defy\nold Ben Weatherstaff to his face.  The odd companionship,\nthe play acting, the great secret so carefully kept.\nThe listener laughed until tears came into his eyes and\nsometimes tears came into his eyes when he was not laughing.\nThe Athlete, the Lecturer, the Scientific Discoverer\nwas a laughable, lovable, healthy young human thing.",
        "“Now,” he said at the end of the story, “it need not be\na secret any more.  I dare say it will frighten them\nnearly into fits when they see me–but I am never going\nto get into the chair again.  I shall walk back with you,\nFather–to the house.”",
        "Ben Weatherstaff’s duties rarely took him away from the gardens,\nbut on this occasion he made an excuse to carry some\nvegetables to the kitchen and being invited into the servants’\nhall by Mrs. Medlock to drink a glass of beer he was on\nthe spot–as he had hoped to be–when the most dramatic\nevent Misselthwaite Manor had seen during the present\ngeneration actually took place.  One of the windows looking\nupon the courtyard gave also a glimpse of the lawn.\nMrs. Medlock, knowing Ben had come from the gardens,\nhoped that he might have caught sight of his master\nand even by chance of his meeting with Master Colin.",
        "“Did you see either of them, Weatherstaff?” she asked.",
        "Ben took his beer-mug from his mouth and wiped his lips\nwith the back of his hand.",
        "“Aye, that I did,” he answered with a shrewdly significant air.",
        "“Both of them?” suggested Mrs. Medlock.",
        "“Both of ’em,” returned Ben Weatherstaff.  “Thank ye kindly,\nma’am, I could sup up another mug of it.”",
        "“Together?” said Mrs. Medlock, hastily overfilling his\nbeer-mug in her excitement.",
        "“Together, ma’am,” and Ben gulped down half of his new\nmug at one gulp.",
        "“Where was Master Colin? How did he look? What did they\nsay to each other?”",
        "“I didna’ hear that,” said Ben, “along o’ only bein’ on th’\nstepladder lookin, over th’ wall.  But I’ll tell thee this.\nThere’s been things goin’ on outside as you house people\nknows nowt about.  An’ what tha’ll find out tha’ll find\nout soon.”",
        "And it was not two minutes before he swallowed the last\nof his beer and waved his mug solemnly toward the window\nwhich took in through the shrubbery a piece of the lawn.",
        "“Look there,” he said, “if tha’s curious.  Look what’s comin’\nacross th’ grass.”",
        "When Mrs. Medlock looked she threw up her hands and gave\na little shriek and every man and woman servant within hearing\nbolted across the servants’ hall and stood looking through\nthe window with their eyes almost starting out of their heads.",
        "Across the lawn came the Master of Misselthwaite and he\nlooked as many of them had never seen him.  And by his,\nside with his head up in the air and his eyes full\nof laughter walked as strongly and steadily as any boy\nin Yorkshire–Master Colin.",
