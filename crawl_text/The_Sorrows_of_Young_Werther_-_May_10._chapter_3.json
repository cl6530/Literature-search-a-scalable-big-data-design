        "A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like\nthese sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart.\nI am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which\nwas created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my\ndear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil\nexistence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of\ndrawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that\nI never was a greater artist than now. When, while the lovely valley\nteems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper\nsurface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray\ngleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the\ntall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth,\na thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of\nthe little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless\nindescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence\nof the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath of\nthat universal love which bears and sustains us, as it floats around\nus in an eternity of bliss; and then, my friend, when darkness overspreads\nmy eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its\npower, like the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think with\nlonging, Oh, would I could describe these conceptions, could impress\nupon paper all that is living so full and warm within me, that it might\nbe the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite\nGod! O my friend — but it is too much for my strength — I sink\nunder the weight of the splendour of these visions!",
