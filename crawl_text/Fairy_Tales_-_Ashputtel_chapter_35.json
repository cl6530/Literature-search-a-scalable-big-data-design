        "The wife of a rich man fell sick; and when she felt that her end drew\nnigh, she called her only daughter to her bed-side, and said, ’Always\nbe a good girl, and I will look down from heaven and watch over you.’\nSoon afterwards she shut her eyes and died, and was buried in the\ngarden; and the little girl went every day to her grave and wept, and\nwas always good and kind to all about her. And the snow fell and\nspread a beautiful white covering over the grave; but by the time the\nspring came, and the sun had melted it away again, her father had\nmarried another wife. This new wife had two daughters of her own, that\nshe brought home with her; they were fair in face but foul at heart,\nand it was now a sorry time for the poor little girl. ’What does the\ngood-for-nothing want in the parlour?’ said they; ’they who would eat\nbread should first earn it; away with the kitchen-maid!’ Then they\ntook away her fine clothes, and gave her an old grey frock to put on,\nand laughed at her, and turned her into the kitchen.",
        "There she was forced to do hard work; to rise early before daylight,\nto bring the water, to make the fire, to cook and to wash. Besides\nthat, the sisters plagued her in all sorts of ways, and laughed at\nher. In the evening when she was tired, she had no bed to lie down on,\nbut was made to lie by the hearth among the ashes; and as this, of\ncourse, made her always dusty and dirty, they called her Ashputtel.",
        "It happened once that the father was going to the fair, and asked his\nwife’s daughters what he should bring them. ’Fine clothes,’ said the\nfirst; ’Pearls and diamonds,’ cried the second. ’Now, child,’ said he\nto his own daughter, ’what will you have?’ ’The first twig, dear\nfather, that brushes against your hat when you turn your face to come\nhomewards,’ said she. Then he bought for the first two the fine\nclothes and pearls and diamonds they had asked for: and on his way\nhome, as he rode through a green copse, a hazel twig brushed against\nhim, and almost pushed off his hat: so he broke it off and brought it\naway; and when he got home he gave it to his daughter. Then she took\nit, and went to her mother’s grave and planted it there; and cried so\nmuch that it was watered with her tears; and there it grew and became\na fine tree. Three times every day she went to it and cried; and soon\na little bird came and built its nest upon the tree, and talked with\nher, and watched over her, and brought her whatever she wished for.",
        "Now it happened that the king of that land held a feast, which was to\nlast three days; and out of those who came to it his son was to choose\na bride for himself. Ashputtel’s two sisters were asked to come; so\nthey called her up, and said, ’Now, comb our hair, brush our shoes,\nand tie our sashes for us, for we are going to dance at the king’s\nfeast.’ Then she did as she was told; but when all was done she could\nnot help crying, for she thought to herself, she should so have liked\nto have gone with them to the ball; and at last she begged her mother\nvery hard to let her go. ’You, Ashputtel!’ said she; ’you who have\nnothing to wear, no clothes at all, and who cannot even dance–you\nwant to go to the ball? And when she kept on begging, she said at\nlast, to get rid of her, ’I will throw this dishful of peas into the\nash-heap, and if in two hours’ time you have picked them all out, you\nshall go to the feast too.’",
        "Then she threw the peas down among the ashes, but the little maiden\nran out at the back door into the garden, and cried out:",
        " ’Hither, hither, through the sky,\n  Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!\n  Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,\n  Hither, hither, haste away!\n  One and all come help me, quick!\n  Haste ye, haste ye!–pick, pick, pick!’",
        "Then first came two white doves, flying in at the kitchen window; next\ncame two turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under\nheaven, chirping and fluttering in: and they flew down into the ashes.\nAnd the little doves stooped their heads down and set to work, pick,\npick, pick; and then the others began to pick, pick, pick: and among\nthem all they soon picked out all the good grain, and put it into a\ndish but left the ashes. Long before the end of the hour the work was\nquite done, and all flew out again at the windows.",
        "Then Ashputtel brought the dish to her mother, overjoyed at the\nthought that now she should go to the ball. But the mother said, ’No,\nno! you slut, you have no clothes, and cannot dance; you shall not\ngo.’ And when Ashputtel begged very hard to go, she said, ’If you can\nin one hour’s time pick two of those dishes of peas out of the ashes,\nyou shall go too.’ And thus she thought she should at least get rid of\nher. So she shook two dishes of peas into the ashes.",
        "But the little maiden went out into the garden at the back of the\nhouse, and cried out as before:",
        " ’Hither, hither, through the sky,\n  Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!\n  Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,\n  Hither, hither, haste away!\n  One and all come help me, quick!\n  Haste ye, haste ye!–pick, pick, pick!’",
        "Then first came two white doves in at the kitchen window; next came\ntwo turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under\nheaven, chirping and hopping about. And they flew down into the ashes;\nand the little doves put their heads down and set to work, pick, pick,\npick; and then the others began pick, pick, pick; and they put all the\ngood grain into the dishes, and left all the ashes. Before half an\nhour’s time all was done, and out they flew again. And then Ashputtel\ntook the dishes to her mother, rejoicing to think that she should now\ngo to the ball. But her mother said, ’It is all of no use, you cannot\ngo; you have no clothes, and cannot dance, and you would only put us\nto shame’: and off she went with her two daughters to the ball.",
        "Now when all were gone, and nobody left at home, Ashputtel went\nsorrowfully and sat down under the hazel-tree, and cried out:",
        " ’Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\n  Gold and silver over me!’",
        "Then her friend the bird flew out of the tree, and brought a gold and\nsilver dress for her, and slippers of spangled silk; and she put them\non, and followed her sisters to the feast. But they did not know her,\nand thought it must be some strange princess, she looked so fine and\nbeautiful in her rich clothes; and they never once thought of\nAshputtel, taking it for granted that she was safe at home in the\ndirt.",
        "The king’s son soon came up to her, and took her by the hand and\ndanced with her, and no one else: and he never left her hand; but when\nanyone else came to ask her to dance, he said, ’This lady is dancing\nwith me.’",
        "Thus they danced till a late hour of the night; and then she wanted to\ngo home: and the king’s son said, ’I shall go and take care of you to\nyour home’; for he wanted to see where the beautiful maiden lived. But\nshe slipped away from him, unawares, and ran off towards home; and as\nthe prince followed her, she jumped up into the pigeon-house and shut\nthe door. Then he waited till her father came home, and told him that\nthe unknown maiden, who had been at the feast, had hid herself in the\npigeon-house. But when they had broken open the door they found no one\nwithin; and as they came back into the house, Ashputtel was lying, as\nshe always did, in her dirty frock by the ashes, and her dim little\nlamp was burning in the chimney. For she had run as quickly as she\ncould through the pigeon-house and on to the hazel-tree, and had there\ntaken off her beautiful clothes, and put them beneath the tree, that\nthe bird might carry them away, and had lain down again amid the ashes\nin her little grey frock.",
        "The next day when the feast was again held, and her father, mother,\nand sisters were gone, Ashputtel went to the hazel-tree, and said:",
        " ’Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\n  Gold and silver over me!’",
        "And the bird came and brought a still finer dress than the one she had\nworn the day before. And when she came in it to the ball, everyone\nwondered at her beauty: but the king’s son, who was waiting for her,\ntook her by the hand, and danced with her; and when anyone asked her\nto dance, he said as before, ’This lady is dancing with me.’",
        "When night came she wanted to go home; and the king’s son followed\nhere as before, that he might see into what house she went: but she\nsprang away from him all at once into the garden behind her father’s\nhouse. In this garden stood a fine large pear-tree full of ripe fruit;\nand Ashputtel, not knowing where to hide herself, jumped up into it\nwithout being seen. Then the king’s son lost sight of her, and could\nnot find out where she was gone, but waited till her father came home,\nand said to him, ’The unknown lady who danced with me has slipped\naway, and I think she must have sprung into the pear-tree.’ The father\nthought to himself, ’Can it be Ashputtel?’ So he had an axe brought;\nand they cut down the tree, but found no one upon it. And when they\ncame back into the kitchen, there lay Ashputtel among the ashes; for\nshe had slipped down on the other side of the tree, and carried her\nbeautiful clothes back to the bird at the hazel-tree, and then put on\nher little grey frock.",
        "The third day, when her father and mother and sisters were gone, she\nwent again into the garden, and said:",
        " ’Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\n  Gold and silver over me!’",
        "Then her kind friend the bird brought a dress still finer than the\nformer one, and slippers which were all of gold: so that when she came\nto the feast no one knew what to say, for wonder at her beauty: and\nthe king’s son danced with nobody but her; and when anyone else asked\nher to dance, he said, ’This lady is /my/ partner, sir.’",
        "When night came she wanted to go home; and the king’s son would go\nwith her, and said to himself, ’I will not lose her this time’; but,\nhowever, she again slipped away from him, though in such a hurry that\nshe dropped her left golden slipper upon the stairs.",
        "The prince took the shoe, and went the next day to the king his\nfather, and said, ’I will take for my wife the lady that this golden\nslipper fits.’ Then both the sisters were overjoyed to hear it; for\nthey had beautiful feet, and had no doubt that they could wear the\ngolden slipper. The eldest went first into the room where the slipper\nwas, and wanted to try it on, and the mother stood by. But her great\ntoe could not go into it, and the shoe was altogether much too small\nfor her. Then the mother gave her a knife, and said, ’Never mind, cut\nit off; when you are queen you will not care about toes; you will not\nwant to walk.’ So the silly girl cut off her great toe, and thus\nsqueezed on the shoe, and went to the king’s son. Then he took her for\nhis bride, and set her beside him on his horse, and rode away with her\nhomewards.",
        "But on their way home they had to pass by the hazel-tree that\nAshputtel had planted; and on the branch sat a little dove singing:",
        " ’Back again! back again! look to the shoe!\n  The shoe is too small, and not made for you!\n  Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,\n  For she’s not the true one that sits by thy side.’",
        "Then the prince got down and looked at her foot; and he saw, by the\nblood that streamed from it, what a trick she had played him. So he\nturned his horse round, and brought the false bride back to her home,\nand said, ’This is not the right bride; let the other sister try and\nput on the slipper.’ Then she went into the room and got her foot into\nthe shoe, all but the heel, which was too large. But her mother\nsqueezed it in till the blood came, and took her to the king’s son:\nand he set her as his bride by his side on his horse, and rode away\nwith her.",
        "But when they came to the hazel-tree the little dove sat there still,\nand sang:",
        " ’Back again! back again! look to the shoe!\n  The shoe is too small, and not made for you!\n  Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,\n  For she’s not the true one that sits by thy side.’",
        "Then he looked down, and saw that the blood streamed so much from the\nshoe, that her white stockings were quite red. So he turned his horse\nand brought her also back again. ’This is not the true bride,’ said he\nto the father; ’have you no other daughters?’ ’No,’ said he; ’there is\nonly a little dirty Ashputtel here, the child of my first wife; I am\nsure she cannot be the bride.’ The prince told him to send her. But\nthe mother said, ’No, no, she is much too dirty; she will not dare to\nshow herself.’ However, the prince would have her come; and she first\nwashed her face and hands, and then went in and curtsied to him, and\nhe reached her the golden slipper. Then she took her clumsy shoe off\nher left foot, and put on the golden slipper; and it fitted her as if\nit had been made for her. And when he drew near and looked at her face\nhe knew her, and said, ’This is the right bride.’ But the mother and\nboth the sisters were frightened, and turned pale with anger as he\ntook Ashputtel on his horse, and rode away with her. And when they\ncame to the hazel-tree, the white dove sang:",
        " ’Home! home! look at the shoe!\n  Princess! the shoe was made for you!\n  Prince! prince! take home thy bride,\n  For she is the true one that sits by thy side!’",
        "And when the dove had done its song, it came flying, and perched upon\nher right shoulder, and so went home with her.",
