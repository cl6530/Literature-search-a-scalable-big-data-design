        "[98] IN Vasari’s life of Leonardo da Vinci as we now read it there are\nsome variations from the first edition.  There, the painter who has\nfixed the outward type of Christ for succeeding centuries was a\nbold speculator, holding lightly by other men’s beliefs, setting\nphilosophy above Christianity.  Words of his, trenchant enough\nto justify this impression, are not recorded, and would have been\nout of keeping with a genius of which one characteristic is the\ntendency to lose itself in a refined and graceful mystery.  The\nsuspicion was but the time-honoured mode in which the world\nstamps its appreciation of one who has thoughts for himself\nalone, his high indifference, his intolerance of the common forms\nof things; and in the second edition the image was changed into\nsomething fainter and more conventional.  But it is still by a\ncertain mystery in his work, and something enigmatical beyond\nthe usual measure of great men, that he fascinates, or perhaps half\nrepels.  His life is one of sudden [99] revolts, with intervals in\nwhich he works not at all, or apart from the main scope of his\nwork.  By a strange fortune the pictures on which his more\npopular fame rested disappeared early from the world, like the\nBattle of the Standard; or are mixed obscurely with the product\nof meaner hands, like the Last Supper.  His type of beauty is so\nexotic that it fascinates a larger number than it delights, and\nseems more than that of any other artist to reflect ideas and views\nand some scheme of the world within; so that he seemed to his\ncontemporaries to be the possessor of some unsanctified and\nsecret wisdom; as to Michelet and others to have anticipated\nmodern ideas.  He trifles with his genius, and crowds all his chief\nwork into a few tormented years of later life; yet he is so\npossessed by his genius that he passes unmoved through the most\ntragic events, overwhelming his country and friends, like one\nwho comes across them by chance on some secret errand.",
        "His legend, as the French say, with the anecdotes which every\none remembers, is one of the most brilliant chapters of Vasari.\nLater writers merely copied it, until, in 1804, Carlo Amoretti\napplied to it a criticism which left hardly a date fixed, and not one\nof those anecdotes untouched.  The various questions thus raised\nhave since that time become, one after another, subjects of\nspecial study, and mere antiquarianism has in this direction little\nmore to do.  For others remain the editing of [100] the thirteen\nbooks of his manuscripts, and the separation by technical\ncriticism of what in his reputed works is really his, from what is\nonly half his, or the work of his pupils.  But a lover of strange\nsouls may still analyse for himself the impression made on him\nby those works, and try to reach through it a definition of the\nchief elements of Leonardo’s genius.  The legend, as corrected\nand enlarged by its critics, may now and then intervene to support\nthe results of this analysis.",
        "His life has three divisions–thirty years at Florence, nearly\ntwenty years at Milan, then nineteen years of wandering, till he\nsinks to rest under the protection of Francis the First at the\nChateau de Clou.  The dishonour of illegitimacy hangs over his\nbirth.  Piero Antonio, his father, was of a noble Florentine house,\nof Vinci in the Val d’Arno, and Leonardo, brought up delicately\namong the true children of that house, was the love-child of his\nyouth, with the keen, puissant nature such children often have.\nWe see him in his boyhood fascinating all men by his beauty,\nimprovising music and songs, buying the caged birds and setting\nthem free, as he walked the streets of Florence, fond of odd bright\ndresses and spirited horses.",
        "From his earliest years he designed many objects, and\nconstructed models in relief, of which Vasari mentions some of\nwomen smiling.  His father, pondering over this promise in the\n[101] child, took him to the workshop of Andrea del Verrocchio,\nthen the most famous artist in Florence.  Beautiful objects lay\nabout there–reliquaries, pyxes, silver images for the pope’s\nchapel at Rome, strange fancy-work of the middle age, keeping\nodd company with fragments of antiquity, then but lately\ndiscovered.  Another student Leonardo may have seen there–a\nlad into whose soul the level light and aerial illusions of Italian\nsunsets had passed, in after days famous as Perugino.  Verrocchio\nwas an artist of the earlier Florentine type, carver, painter, and\nworker in metals, in one; designer, not of pictures only, but of all\nthings for sacred or household use, drinking-vessels, ambries,\ninstruments of music, making them all fair to look upon, filling\nthe common ways of life with the reflexion of some far-off\nbrightness; and years of patience had refined his hand till his\nwork was now sought after from distant places.",
        "It happened that Verrocchio was employed by the brethren of\nVallombrosa to paint the Baptism of Christ, and Leonardo was\nallowed to finish an angel in the left-hand corner.  It was one of\nthose moments in which the progress of a great thing–here, that\nof the art of Italy–presses hard on the happiness of an individual,\nthrough whose discouragement and decrease, humanity, in more\nfortunate persons, comes a step nearer to its final success.",
        "For beneath the cheerful exterior of the mere [102] well-paid\ncraftsman, chasing brooches for the copes of Santa Maria\nNovella, or twisting metal screens for the tombs of the Medici,\nlay the ambitious desire to expand the destiny of Italian art by a\nlarger knowledge and insight into things, a purpose in art not\nunlike Leonardo’s still unconscious purpose; and often, in the\nmodelling of drapery, or of a lifted arm, or of hair cast back from\nthe face, there came to him something of the freer manner and\nricher humanity of a later age.  But in this Baptism the pupil had\nsurpassed the master; and Verrocchio turned away as one\nstunned, and as if his sweet earlier work must thereafter be\ndistasteful to him, from the bright animated angel of Leonardo’s\nhand.",
        "The angel may still be seen in Florence, a space of sunlight in the\ncold, laboured old picture; but the legend is true only in\nsentiment, for painting had always been the art by which\nVerrocchio set least store.  And as in a sense he anticipates\nLeonardo, so to the last Leonardo recalls the studio of\nVerrocchio, in the love of beautiful toys, such as the vessel of\nwater for a mirror, and lovely needle-work about the implicated\nhands in the Modesty and Vanity, and of reliefs, like those\ncameos which in the Virgin of the Balances hang all round the\ngirdle of Saint Michael, and of bright variegated stones, such as\nthe agates in the Saint Anne, and in a hieratic preciseness and\ngrace, as of a sanctuary swept and [103] garnished.  Amid all the\ncunning and intricacy of his Lombard manner this never left him.\nMuch of it there must have been in that lost picture of Paradise,\nwhich he prepared as a cartoon for tapestry, to be woven in the\nlooms of Flanders.  It was the perfection of the older Florentine\nstyle of miniature-painting, with patient putting of each leaf upon\nthe trees and each flower in the grass, where the first man and\nwoman were standing.",
        "And because it was the perfection of that style, it awoke in\nLeonardo some seed of discontent which lay in the secret places\nof his nature.  For the way to perfection is through a series of\ndisgusts; and this picture–all that he had done so far in his life at\nFlorence–was after all in the old slight manner.  His art, if it was\nto be something in the world, must be weighted with more of the\nmeaning of nature and purpose of humanity.  Nature was “the\ntrue mistress of higher intelligences.”  He plunged, then, into the\nstudy of nature.  And in doing this he followed the manner of the\nolder students; he brooded over the hidden virtues of plants and\ncrystals, the lines traced by the stars as they moved in the sky,\nover the correspondences which exist between the different\norders of living things, through which, to eyes opened, they\ninterpret each other; and for years he seemed to those about him\nas one listening to a voice, silent for other men.",
        "[104] He learned here the art of going deep, of tracking the\nsources of expression to their subtlest retreats, the power of an\nintimate presence in the things he handled.  He did not at once or\nentirely desert his art; only he was no longer the cheerful,\nobjective painter, through whose soul, as through clear glass, the\nbright figures of Florentine life, only made a little mellower and\nmore pensive by the transit, passed on to the white wall.  He\nwasted many days in curious tricks of design, seeming to lose\nhimself in the spinning of intricate devices of line and colour.  He\nwas smitten with a love of the impossible–the perforation of\nmountains, changing the course of rivers, raising great buildings,\nsuch as the church of San Giovanni, in the air; all those feats for\nthe performance of which natural magic professed to have the\nkey.  Later writers, indeed, see in these efforts an anticipation of\nmodern mechanics; in him they were rather dreams, thrown off\nby the overwrought and labouring brain.  Two ideas were\nespecially confirmed in him, as reflexes of things that had\ntouched his brain in childhood beyond the depth of other\nimpressions–the smiling of women and the motion of great\nwaters.",
        "And in such studies some interfusion of the extremes of beauty\nand terror shaped itself, as an image that might be seen and\ntouched, in the mind of this gracious youth, so fixed that for the\nrest of his life it never left him.  As if catching [105] glimpses of\nit in the strange eyes or hair of chance people, he would follow\nsuch about the streets of Florence till the sun went down, of\nwhom many sketches of his remain.  Some of these are full of a\ncurious beauty, that remote beauty which may be apprehended\nonly by those who have sought it carefully; who, starting with\nacknowledged types of beauty, have refined as far upon these, as\nthese refine upon the world of common forms.  But mingled\ninextricably with this there is an element of mockery also; so that,\nwhether in sorrow or scorn, he caricatures Dante even.  Legions\nof grotesques sweep under his hand; for has not nature too her\ngrotesques–the rent rock, the distorting lights of evening on\nlonely roads, the unveiled structure of man in the embryo, or the\nskeleton?",
        "All these swarming fancies unite in the Medusa of the Uffizii.\nVasari’s story of an earlier Medusa, painted on a wooden shield,\nis perhaps an invention; and yet, properly told, has more of the air\nof truth about it than anything else in the whole legend.  For its\nreal subject is not the serious work of a man, but the experiment\nof a child.  The lizards and glow-worms and other strange small\ncreatures which haunt an Italian vineyard bring before one the\nwhole picture of a child’s life in a Tuscan dwelling–half castle,\nhalf farm–and are as true to nature as the pretended\nastonishment [106] of the father for whom the boy has prepared\na surprise.  It was not in play that he painted that other Medusa,\nthe one great picture which he left behind him in Florence.  The\nsubject has been treated in various ways; Leonardo alone cuts to\nits centre; he alone realises it as the head of a corpse, exercising\nits powers through all the circumstances of death.  What may be\ncalled the fascination of corruption penetrates in every touch its\nexquisitely finished beauty.  About the dainty lines of the cheek\nthe bat flits unheeded.  The delicate snakes seem literally\nstrangling each other in terrified struggle to escape from the\nMedusa brain.  The hue which violent death always brings with it\nis in the features; features singularly massive and grand, as we\ncatch them inverted, in a dexterous foreshortening, crown\nforemost, like a great calm stone against which the wave of\nserpents breaks.",
        "The science of that age was all divination, clairvoyance,\nunsubjected to our exact modern formulas, seeking in an instant\nof vision to concentrate a thousand experiences.  Later writers,\nthinking only of the well-ordered treatise on painting which a\nFrenchman, Raffaelle du Fresne, a hundred years afterwards,\ncompiled from Leonardo’s bewildered manuscripts, written\nstrangely, as his manner was, from right to left, have imagined a\nrigid order in his inquiries.  But this rigid order would have been\nlittle in [107] accordance with the restlessness of his character;\nand if we think of him as the mere reasoner who subjects design\nto anatomy, and composition to mathematical rules, we shall\nhardly have that impression which those around Leonardo\nreceived from him.  Poring over his crucibles, making\nexperiments with colour, trying, by a strange variation of the\nalchemist’s dream, to discover the secret, not of an elixir to make\nman’s natural life immortal, but of giving immortality to the\nsubtlest and most delicate effects of painting, he seemed to them\nrather the sorcerer or the magician, possessed of curious secrets\nand a hidden knowledge, living in a world of which he alone\npossessed the key.  What his philosophy seems to have been most\nlike is that of Paracelsus or Cardan; and much of the spirit of the\nolder alchemy still hangs about it, with its confidence in short\ncuts and odd byways to knowledge.  To him philosophy was to\nbe something giving strange swiftness and double sight, divining\nthe sources of springs beneath the earth or of expression beneath\nthe human countenance, clairvoyant of occult gifts in common or\nuncommon things, in the reed at the brook-side, or the star which\ndraws near to us but once in a century.  How, in this way, the\nclear purpose was overclouded, the fine chaser’s hand perplexed,\nwe but dimly see; the mystery which at no point quite lifts from\nLeonardo’s life is deepest here.  But it is [108] certain that at one\nperiod of his life he had almost ceased to be an artist.",
        "The year 1483–the year of the birth of Raphael and the thirty-\nfirst of Leonardo’s life–is fixed as the date of his visit to Milan\nby the letter in which he recommends himself to Ludovico\nSforza, and offers to tell him, for a price, strange secrets in the art\nof war.  It was that Sforza who murdered his young nephew by\nslow poison, yet was so susceptible of religious impressions that\nhe blended mere earthly passion with a sort of religious\nsentimentalism, and who took for his device the mulberry-tree–\nsymbol, in its long delay and sudden yielding of flowers and fruit\ntogether, of a wisdom which economises all forces for an\nopportunity of sudden and sure effect.  The fame of Leonardo had\ngone before him, and he was to model a colossal statue of\nFrancesco, the first Duke of Milan.  As for Leonardo himself, he\ncame not as an artist at all, or careful of the fame of one; but as a\nplayer on the harp, a strange harp of silver of his own\nconstruction, shaped in some curious likeness to a horse’s skull.\nThe capricious spirit of Ludovico was susceptible also to the\npower of music, and Leonardo’s nature had a kind of spell in it.\nFascination is always the word descriptive of him.  No portrait of\nhis youth remains; but all tends to make us believe that up to this\ntime some charm of voice and aspect, strong enough to balance\nthe disadvantage of his birth, had [109] played about him.  His\nphysical strength was great; it was said that he could bend a\nhorseshoe like a coil of lead.",
        "The Duomo, work of artists from beyond the Alps, so fantastic to\nthe eye of a Florentine used to the mellow, unbroken surfaces of\nGiotto and Arnolfo, was then in all its freshness; and below, in\nthe streets of Milan, moved a people as fantastic, changeful, and\ndreamlike.  To Leonardo least of all men could there be anything\npoisonous in the exotic flowers of sentiment which grew there.  It\nwas a life of brilliant sins and exquisite amusements: Leonardo\nbecame a celebrated designer of pageants; and it suited the\nquality of his genius, composed, in almost equal parts, of\ncuriosity and the desire of beauty, to take things as they came.",
        "Curiosity and the desire of beauty–these are the two elementary\nforces in Leonardo’s genius; curiosity often in conflict with the\ndesire of beauty, but generating, in union with it, a type of subtle\nand curious grace.",
        "The movement of the fifteenth century was twofold; partly the\nRenaissance, partly also the coming of what is called the\n“modern spirit,” with its realism, its appeal to experience.  It\ncomprehended a return to antiquity, and a return to nature.\nRaphael represents the return to antiquity, and Leonardo the\nreturn to nature.  In this return to nature, he was seeking to satisfy\na boundless curiosity by her perpetual surprises, [110] a\nmicroscopic sense of finish by her finesse, or delicacy of\noperation, that subtilitas naturae which Bacon notices.  So we\nfind him often in intimate relations with men of science,–with\nFra Luca Paccioli the mathematician, and the anatomist Marc\nAntonio della Torre.  His observations and experiments fill\nthirteen volumes of manuscript; and those who can judge\ndescribe him as anticipating long before, by rapid intuition, the\nlater ideas of science.  He explained the obscure light of the\nunilluminated part of the moon, knew that the sea had once\ncovered the mountains which contain shells, and of the gathering\nof the equatorial waters above the polar.",
        "He who thus penetrated into the most secret parts of nature\npreferred always the more to the less remote, what, seeming\nexceptional, was an instance of law more refined, the\nconstruction about things of a peculiar atmosphere and mixed\nlights.  He paints flowers with such curious felicity that different\nwriters have attributed to him a fondness for particular flowers,\nas Clement the cyclamen, and Rio the jasmin; while, at Venice,\nthere is a stray leaf from his portfolio dotted all over with studies\nof violets and the wild rose.  In him first appears the taste for\nwhat is bizarre or recherche in landscape; hollow places full of\nthe green shadow of bituminous rocks, ridged reefs of trap-rock\nwhich cut the water into quaint sheets of light,–their exact\nantitype is in our own western seas; all the [111] solemn effects\nof moving water.  You may follow it springing from its distant\nsource among the rocks on the heath of the Madonna of the\nBalances, passing, as a little fall, into the treacherous calm of the\nMadonna of the Lake, as a goodly river next, below the cliffs of\nthe Madonna of the Rocks, washing the white walls of its distant\nvillages, stealing out in a network of divided streams in La\nGioconda to the seashore of the Saint Anne–that delicate place,\nwhere the wind passes like the hand of some fine etcher over the\nsurface, and the untorn shells are lying thick upon the sand, and\nthe tops of the rocks, to which the waves never rise, are green\nwith grass, grown fine as hair.  It is the landscape, not of dreams\nor of fancy, but of places far withdrawn, and hours selected from\na thousand with a miracle of finesse.  Through Leonardo’s\nstrange veil of sight things reach him so; in no ordinary night or\nday, but as in faint light of eclipse, or in some brief interval of\nfalling rain at daybreak, or through deep water.",
        "And not into nature only; but he plunged also into human\npersonality, and became above all a painter of portraits; faces of a\nmodelling more skilful than has been seen before or since,\nembodied with a reality which almost amounts to illusion, on the\ndark air.  To take a character as it was, and delicately sound its\nstops, suited one so curious in observation, curious in invention.\nHe painted thus the portraits of Ludovico’s [112] mistresses,\nLucretia Crivelli and Cecilia Galerani the poetess, of Ludovico\nhimself, and the Duchess Beatrice.  The portrait of Cecilia\nGalerani is lost, but that of Lucretia Crivelli has been identified\nwith La Belle Feroniere of the Louvre, and Ludovico’s pale,\nanxious face still remains in the Ambrosian library.  Opposite is\nthe portrait of Beatrice d’Este, in whom Leonardo seems to have\ncaught some presentiment of early death, painting her precise and\ngrave, full of the refinement of the dead, in sad earth-coloured\nraiment, set with pale stones.",
        "Sometimes this curiosity came in conflict with the desire of\nbeauty; it tended to make him go too far below that outside of\nthings in which art really begins and ends.  This struggle between\nthe reason and its ideas, and the senses, the desire of beauty, is\nthe key to Leonardo’s life at Milan–his restlessness, his endless\nre-touchings, his odd experiments with colour.  How much must\nhe leave unfinished, how much recommence!  His problem was\nthe transmutation of ideas into images.  What he had attained so\nfar had been the mastery of that earlier Florentine style, with its\nnaive and limited sensuousness.  Now he was to entertain in this\nnarrow medium those divinations of a humanity too wide for it,\nthat larger vision of the opening world, which is only not too\nmuch for the great, irregular art of Shakespeare; and everywhere\nthe effort is visible in the work of his hands.  This agitation, this\n[113] perpetual delay, give him an air of weariness and ennui.  To\nothers he seems to be aiming at an impossible effect, to do\nsomething that art, that painting, can never do.  Often the\nexpression of physical beauty at this or that point seems strained\nand marred in the effort, as in those heavy German foreheads–\ntoo heavy and German for perfect beauty.",
        "For there was a touch of Germany in that genius which, as\nGoethe said, had “thought itself weary\"–mude sich gedacht.\nWhat an anticipation of modern Germany, for instance, in that\ndebate on the question whether sculpture or painting is the nobler\nart!*  But there is this difference between him and the German,\nthat, with all that curious science, the German would have\nthought nothing more was needed.  The name of Goethe himself\nreminds one how great for the artist may be the danger of\novermuch science; how Goethe, who, in the Elective Affinities\nand the first part of Faust, does transmute ideas into images, who\nwrought many such transmutations, did not invariably find the\nspell-word, and in the second part of Faust presents us with a\nmass of science which has almost no artistic character at all.  But\nLeonardo will never work till the happy moment comes–that\nmoment of bien-etre, which to imaginative men is a moment of\ninvention.  On this he waits with [114] a perfect patience; other\nmoments are but a preparation, or after-taste of it.  Few men\ndistinguish between them as jealously as he.  Hence so many\nflaws even in the choicest work.  But for Leonardo the distinction\nis absolute, and, in the moment of bien-etre, the alchemy\ncomplete: the idea is stricken into colour and imagery: a cloudy\nmysticism is refined to a subdued and graceful mystery, and\npainting pleases the eye while it satisfies the soul.",
        "This curious beauty is seen above all in his drawings, and in these\nchiefly in the abstract grace of the bounding lines.  Let us take\nsome of these drawings, and pause over them awhile; and, first,\none of those at Florence–the heads of a woman and a little child,\nset side by side, but each in its own separate frame.  First of all,\nthere is much pathos in the reappearance, in the fuller curves of\nthe face of the child, of the sharper, more chastened lines of the\nworn and older face, which leaves no doubt that the heads are\nthose of a little child and its mother.  A feeling for maternity is\nindeed always characteristic of Leonardo; and this feeling is\nfurther indicated here by the half-humorous pathos of the\ndiminutive, rounded shoulders of the child.  You may note a like\npathetic power in drawings of a young man, seated in a stooping\nposture, his face in his hands, as in sorrow; of a slave sitting in an\nuneasy inclined attitude, in some brief interval of rest; of a small\nMadonna and Child, [115] peeping sideways in half-reassured\nterror, as a mighty griffin with batlike wings, one of Leonardo’s\nfinest inventions, descends suddenly from the air to snatch up a\ngreat wild beast wandering near them.  But note in these, as that\nwhich especially belongs to art, the contour of the young man’s\nhair, the poise of the slave’s arm above his head, and the curves\nof the head of the child, following the little skull within, thin and\nfine as some sea-shell worn by the wind.",
        "Take again another head, still more full of sentiment, but of a\ndifferent kind, a little drawing in red chalk which every one will\nremember who has examined at all carefully the drawings by old\nmasters at the Louvre.  It is a face of doubtful sex, set in the\nshadow of its own hair, the cheek-line in high light against it,\nwith something voluptuous and full in the eye-lids and the lips.\nAnother drawing might pass for the same face in childhood, with\nparched and feverish lips, but much sweetness in the loose, short-\nwaisted childish dress, with necklace and bulla, and in the\ndaintily bound hair.  We might take the thread of suggestion\nwhich these two drawings offer, when thus set side by side, and,\nfollowing it through the drawings at Florence, Venice, and Milan,\nconstruct a sort of series, illustrating better than anything else\nLeonardo’s type of womanly beauty.  Daughters of Herodias,\nwith their fantastic head-dresses knotted and folded so strangely\nto leave the [116] dainty oval of the face disengaged, they are not\nof the Christian family, or of Raphael’s.  They are the\nclairvoyants, through whom, as through delicate instruments, one\nbecomes aware of the subtler forces of nature, and the modes of\ntheir action, all that is magnetic in it, all those finer conditions\nwherein material things rise to that subtlety of operation which\nconstitutes them spiritual, where only the final nerve and the\nkeener touch can follow.  It is as if in certain significant examples\nwe actually saw those forces at their work on human flesh.\nNervous, electric, faint always with some inexplicable faintness,\nthese people seem to be subject to exceptional conditions, to feel\npowers at work in the common air unfelt by others, to become, as\nit were, the receptacle of them, and pass them on to us in a chain\nof secret influences.",
        "But among the more youthful heads there is one at Florence\nwhich Love chooses for its own–the head of a young man, which\nmay well be the likeness of Andrea Salaino, beloved of Leonardo\nfor his curled and waving hair–belli capelli ricci e inanellati–\nand afterwards his favourite pupil and servant.  Of all the\ninterests in living men and women which may have filled his life\nat Milan, this attachment alone is recorded.  And in return\nSalaino identified himself so entirely with Leonardo, that the\npicture of Saint Anne, in the Louvre, has been attributed to him.\nIt illustrates Leonardo’s usual choice of pupils, men [117] of\nsome natural charm of person or intercourse like Salaino, or men\nof birth and princely habits of life like Francesco Melzi–men\nwith just enough genius to be capable of initiation into his secret,\nfor the sake of which they were ready to efface their own\nindividuality.  Among them, retiring often to the villa of the\nMelzi at Canonica al Vaprio, he worked at his fugitive\nmanuscripts and sketches, working for the present hour, and for a\nfew only, perhaps chiefly for himself.  Other artists have been as\ncareless of present or future applause, in self-forgetfulness, or\nbecause they set moral or political ends above the ends of art; but\nin him this solitary culture of beauty seems to have hung upon a\nkind of self-love, and a carelessness in the work of art of all but\nart itself.  Out of the secret places of a unique temperament he\nbrought strange blossoms and fruits hitherto unknown; and for\nhim, the novel impression conveyed, the exquisite effect woven,\ncounted as an end in itself–a perfect end.",
        "And these pupils of his acquired his manner so thoroughly, that\nthough the number of Leonardo’s authentic works is very small\nindeed, there is a multitude of other men’s pictures through\nwhich we undoubtedly see him, and come very near to his genius.\nSometimes, as in the little picture of the Madonna of the\nBalances, in which, from the bosom of His mother, Christ weighs\nthe pebbles of the brook against the sins of men, we have a hand,\nrough enough by [118] contrast, working upon some fine hint or\nsketch of his.  Sometimes, as in the subjects of the Daughter of\nHerodias and the Head of John the Baptist, the lost originals have\nbeen re-echoed and varied upon again and again by Luini and\nothers.  At other times the original remains, but has been a mere\ntheme or motive, a type of which the accessories might be\nmodified or changed; and these variations have but brought out\nthe more the purpose, or expression of the original.  It is so with\nthe so-called Saint John the Baptist of the Louvre–one of the few\nnaked figures Leonardo painted–whose delicate brown flesh and\nwoman’s hair no one would go out into the wilderness to seek,\nand whose treacherous smile would have us understand\nsomething far beyond the outward gesture or circumstance.  But\nthe long, reedlike cross in the hand, which suggests Saint John\nthe Baptist, becomes faint in a copy at the Ambrosian Library,\nand disappears altogether in another version, in the Palazzo\nRosso at Genoa.  Returning from the latter to the original, we are\nno longer surprised by Saint John’s strange likeness to the\nBacchus which hangs near it, and which set Theophile Gautier\nthinking of Heine’s notion of decayed gods, who, to maintain\nthemselves, after the fall of paganism, took employment in the\nnew religion.  We recognise one of those symbolical inventions\nin which the ostensible subject is used, not as matter for definite\npictorial realisation, but as the starting-point of a [119] train of\nsentiment, subtle and vague as a piece of music.  No one ever\nruled over the mere subject in hand more entirely than Leonardo,\nor bent it more dexterously to purely artistic ends.  And so it\ncomes to pass that though he handles sacred subjects continually,\nhe is the most profane of painters; the given person or subject,\nSaint John in the Desert, or the Virgin on the knees of Saint\nAnne, is often merely the pretext for a kind of work which carries\none altogether beyond the range of its conventional associations.",
        "About the Last Supper, its decay and restorations, a whole\nliterature has risen up, Goethe’s pensive sketch of its sad fortunes\nbeing perhaps the best.  The death in childbirth of the Duchess\nBeatrice was followed in Ludovico by one of those paroxysms of\nreligious feeling which in him were constitutional.  The low,\ngloomy Dominican church of Saint Mary of the Graces had been\nthe favourite oratory of Beatrice.  She had spent her last days\nthere, full of sinister presentiments; at last it had been almost\nnecessary to remove her from it by force; and now it was here\nthat mass was said a hundred times a day for her repose.  On the\ndamp wall of the refectory, oozing with mineral salts, Leonardo\npainted the Last Supper.  Effective anecdotes were told about it,\nhis retouchings and delays.  They show him refusing to work\nexcept at the moment of invention, scornful of any one who\nsupposed that art could be a work of mere industry and rule,\n[120] often coming the whole length of Milan to give a single\ntouch.  He painted it, not in fresco, where all must be impromptu,\nbut in oils, the new method which he had been one of the first to\nwelcome, because it allowed of so many after-thoughts, so\nrefined a working out of perfection.  It turned out that on a\nplastered wall no process could have been less durable.  Within\nfifty years it had fallen into decay.  And now we have to turn\nback to Leonardo’s own studies, above all to one drawing of the\ncentral head at the Brera, which, in a union of tenderness and\nseverity in the face-lines, reminds one of the monumental work\nof Mino da Fiesole, to trace it as it was.",
        "Here was another effort to lift a given subject out of the range of\nits traditional associations.  Strange, after all the mystic\ndevelopments of the middle age, was the effort to see the\nEucharist, not as the pale Host of the altar, but as one taking\nleave of his friends.  Five years afterwards the young Raphael, at\nFlorence, painted it with sweet and solemn effect in the refectory\nof Saint Onofrio; but still with all the mystical unreality of the\nschool of Perugino.  Vasari pretends that the central head was\nnever finished.  But finished or unfinished, or owing part of its\neffect to a mellowing decay, the head of Jesus does but\nconsummate the sentiment of the whole company–ghosts\nthrough which you see the wall, faint as the shadows of the [121]\nleaves upon the wall on autumn afternoons.  This figure is but the\nfaintest, the most spectral of them all.",
        "The Last Supper was finished in 1497; in 1498 the French\nentered Milan, and whether or not the Gascon bowmen used it as\na mark for their arrows, the model of Francesco Sforza certainly\ndid not survive.  What, in that age, such work was capable of\nbeing–of what nobility, amid what racy truthfulness to fact–we\nmay judge from the bronze statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni on\nhorseback, modelled by Leonardo’s master, Verrocchio (he died\nof grief, it was said, because, the mould accidentally failing, he\nwas unable to complete it), still standing in the piazza of Saint\nJohn and Saint Paul at Venice.  Some traces of the thing may\nremain in certain of Leonardo’s drawings, and perhaps also, by a\nsingular circumstance, in a far-off town of France.  For Ludovico\nbecame a prisoner, and ended his days at Loches in Touraine.\nAfter many years of captivity in the dungeons below, where all\nseems sick with barbarous feudal memories, he was allowed at\nlast, it is said, to breathe fresher air for awhile in one of the rooms\nof the great tower still shown, its walls covered with strange\npainted arabesques, ascribed by tradition to his hand, amused a\nlittle, in this way, through the tedious years.  In those vast\nhelmets and human faces and pieces of armour, among which, in\ngreat letters, the [122] motto Infelix Sum is woven in and out, it is\nperhaps not too fanciful to see the fruit of a wistful after-\ndreaming over Leonardo’s sundry experiments on the armed\nfigure of the great duke, which had occupied the two so much\nduring the days of their good fortune at Milan.",
        "The remaining years of Leonardo’s life are more or less years of\nwandering.  From his brilliant life at court he had saved nothing,\nand he returned to Florence a poor man.  Perhaps necessity kept\nhis spirit excited: the next four years are one prolonged rapture or\necstasy of invention.  He painted now the pictures of the Louvre,\nhis most authentic works, which came there straight from the\ncabinet of Francis the First, at Fontainebleau.  One picture of his,\nthe Saint Anne–not the Saint Anne of the Louvre, but a simple\ncartoon, now in London–revived for a moment a sort of\nappreciation more common in an earlier time, when good pictures\nhad still seemed miraculous.  For two days a crowd of people of\nall qualities passed in naive excitement through the chamber\nwhere it hung, and gave Leonardo a taste of the “triumph” of\nCimabue.  But his work was less with the saints than with the\nliving women of Florence.  For he lived still in the polished\nsociety that he loved, and in the houses of Florence, left perhaps a\nlittle subject to light thoughts by the death of Savonarola–the\nlatest gossip (1869) is of an [123] undraped Monna Lisa, found in\nsome out-of-the-way corner of the late Orleans collection–he\nsaw Ginevra di Benci, and Lisa, the young third wife of\nFrancesco del Giocondo.  As we have seen him using incidents of\nsacred story, not for their own sake, or as mere subjects for\npictorial realisation, but as a cryptic language for fancies all his\nown, so now he found a vent for his thought in taking one of\nthese languid women, and raising her, as Leda or Pomona, as\nModesty or Vanity, to the seventh heaven of symbolical\nexpression.",
        "La Gioconda is, in the truest sense, Leonardo’s masterpiece, the\nrevealing instance of his mode of thought and work.  In\nsuggestiveness, only the Melancholia of Durer is comparable to\nit; and no crude symbolism disturbs the effect of its subdued and\ngraceful mystery.  We all know the face and hands of the figure,\nset in its marble chair, in that circle of fantastic rocks, as in some\nfaint light under sea.  Perhaps of all ancient pictures time has\nchilled it least.*  As often happens with works in which invention\nseems to reach its limit, there is an element in it given to, not\ninvented by, the master.  In that inestimable folio of drawings,\nonce in the possession of Vasari, were certain designs by\nVerrocchio, faces of such impressive beauty that Leonardo in his\nboyhood copied them [124] many times.  It is hard not to connect\nwith these designs of the elder, by-past master, as with its\ngerminal principle, the unfathomable smile, always with a touch\nof something sinister in it, which plays over all Leonardo’s work.\nBesides, the picture is a portrait.  From childhood we see this\nimage defining itself on the fabric of his dreams; and but for\nexpress historical testimony, we might fancy that this was but his\nideal lady, embodied and beheld at last.  What was the\nrelationship of a living Florentine to this creature of his thought?\nBy what strange affinities had the dream and the person grown up\nthus apart, and yet so closely together?  Present from the first\nincorporeally in Leonardo’s brain, dimly traced in the designs of\nVerrocchio, she is found present at last in Il Giocondo’s house.\nThat there is much of mere portraiture in the picture is attested by\nthe legend that by artificial means, the presence of mimes and\nflute-players, that subtle expression was protracted on the face.\nAgain, was it in four years and by renewed labour never really\ncompleted, or in four months and as by stroke of magic, that the\nimage was projected?",
        "The presence that rose thus so strangely beside the waters, is\nexpressive of what in the ways of a thousand years men had come\nto desire.  Hers is the head upon which all “the ends of the world\nare come,” and the eyelids are a little [125] weary.  It is a beauty\nwrought out from within upon the flesh, the deposit, little cell by\ncell, of strange thoughts and fantastic reveries and exquisite\npassions.  Set it for a moment beside one of those white Greek\ngoddesses or beautiful women of antiquity, and how would they\nbe troubled by this beauty, into which the soul with all its\nmaladies has passed!  All the thoughts and experience of the\nworld have etched and moulded there, in that which they have of\npower to refine and make expressive the outward form, the\nanimalism of Greece, the lust of Rome, the mysticism of the\nmiddle age with its spiritual ambition and imaginative loves, the\nreturn of the Pagan world, the sins of the Borgias.  She is older\nthan the rocks among which she sits; like the vampire, she has\nbeen dead many times, and learned the secrets of the grave; and\nhas been a diver in deep seas, and keeps their fallen day about\nher; and trafficked for strange webs with Eastern merchants;\nand, as Leda, was the mother of Helen of Troy, and, as Saint\nAnne, the mother of Mary; and all this has been to her but as the\nsound of lyres and flutes, and lives only in the delicacy with\nwhich it has moulded the changing lineaments, and tinged the\neyelids and the hands.  The fancy of a perpetual life, sweeping\ntogether ten thousand experiences, is an old one; and modern\nphilosophy has conceived the idea of humanity as wrought upon\nby, and summing up in itself, all modes of thought and life.\nCertainly [126] Lady Lisa might stand as the embodiment of the\nold fancy, the symbol of the modern idea.",
        "During these years at Florence Leonardo’s history is the history\nof his art; for himself, he is lost in the bright cloud of it.  The\noutward history begins again in 1502, with a wild journey\nthrough central Italy, which he makes as the chief engineer of\nCaesar Borgia.  The biographer, putting together the stray jottings\nof his manuscripts, may follow him through every day of it, up\nthe strange tower of Siena, elastic like a bent bow, down to the\nseashore at Piombino, each place appearing as fitfully as in a\nfever dream.",
        "One other great work was left for him to do, a work all trace of\nwhich soon vanished, The Battle of the Standard, in which he had\nMichelangelo for his rival.  The citizens of Florence, desiring to\ndecorate the walls of the great council-chamber, had offered the\nwork for competition, and any subject might be chosen from the\nFlorentine wars of the fifteenth century.  Michelangelo chose for\nhis cartoon an incident of the war with Pisa, in which the\nFlorentine soldiers, bathing in the Arno, are surprised by the\nsound of trumpets, and run to arms.  His design has reached us\nonly in an old engraving, which helps us less perhaps than our\nremembrance of the background of his Holy Family in the Uffizii\nto imagine in what superhuman form, [127] such as might have\nbeguiled the heart of an earlier world, those figures ascended out\nof the water.  Leonardo chose an incident from the battle of\nAnghiari, in which two parties of soldiers fight for a standard.\nLike Michelangelo’s, his cartoon is lost, and has come to us only\nin sketches, and in a fragment of Rubens.  Through the accounts\ngiven we may discern some lust of terrible things in it, so that\neven the horses tore each other with their teeth.  And yet one\nfragment of it, in a drawing of his at Florence, is far different–a\nwaving field of lovely armour, the chased edgings running like\nlines of sunlight from side to side.  Michelangelo was twenty-\nseven years old; Leonardo more than fifty; and Raphael, then\nnineteen years of age, visiting Florence for the first time, came\nand watched them as they worked.",
        "We catch a glimpse of Leonardo again, at Rome in 1514,\nsurrounded by his mirrors and vials and furnaces, making strange\ntoys that seemed alive of wax and quicksilver.  The hesitation\nwhich had haunted him all through life, and made him like one\nunder a spell, was upon him now with double force.  No one had\never carried political indifferentism farther; it had always been\nhis philosophy to “fly before the storm\"; he is for the Sforzas, or\nagainst them, as the tide of their fortune turns.  Yet now, in the\npolitical society of Rome, he came [128] to be suspected of secret\nFrench sympathies.  It paralysed him to find himself among\nenemies; and he turned wholly to France, which had long courted\nhim.",
        "France was about to become an Italy more Italian than Italy itself.\nFrancis the First, like Lewis the Twelfth before him, was\nattracted by the finesse of Leonardo’s work; La Gioconda was\nalready in his cabinet, and he offered Leonardo the little Chateau\nde Clou, with its vineyards and meadows, in the pleasant valley\nof the Masse, just outside the walls of the town of Amboise,\nwhere, especially in the hunting season, the court then frequently\nresided.  A Monsieur Lyonard, peinteur du Roy pour Amboyse–\nso the letter of Francis the First is headed.  It opens a prospect,\none of the most interesting in the history of art, where, in a\npeculiarly blent atmosphere, Italian art dies away as a French\nexotic.",
        "Two questions remain, after much busy antiquarianism,\nconcerning Leonardo’s death–the question of the exact form of\nhis religion, and the question whether Francis the First was\npresent at the time.  They are of about equally little importance in\nthe estimate of Leonardo’s genius.  The directions in his will\nconcerning the thirty masses and the great candles for the church\nof Saint Florentin are things of course, their real purpose being\nimmediate and practical; and on no theory of religion could these\nhurried offices be of much consequence.  We forget them in\nspeculating [129] how one who had been always so desirous of\nbeauty, but desired it always in such precise and definite forms,\nas hands or flowers or hair, looked forward now into the vague\nland, and experienced the last curiosity.",
