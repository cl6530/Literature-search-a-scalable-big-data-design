        "In a sunny land in Greece called Arcadia there lived a king and a queen\nwho had no children. They wanted very much to have a son who might live\nto rule over Arcadia when the king was dead, and so, as the years went\nby, they prayed to great Jupiter on the mountain top that he would send\nthem a son. After a while a child was born to them, but it was a little\ngirl. The father was in a great rage with Jupiter and everybody else.",
        "“What is a girl good for?” he said. “She can never do anything but sing,\nand spin, and spend money. If the child had been a boy, he might have\nlearned to do many things,–to ride, and to hunt, and to fight in the\nwars,–and by and by he would have been king of Arcadia. But this girl\ncan never be a king.”",
        "Then he called to one of his men and bade him take the babe out to a\nmountain where there was nothing but rocks and thick woods, and leave it\nthere to be eaten up by the wild bears that lived in the caves and\nthickets. It would be the easiest way, he said, to get rid of the\nuseless little creature.",
        "The man carried the child far up on the mountain side and laid it down\non a bed of moss in the shadow of a great rock. The child stretched out\nits baby hands towards him and smiled, but he turned away and left it\nthere, for he did not dare to disobey the king.",
        "For a whole night and a whole day the babe lay on its bed of moss,\nwailing for its mother; but only the birds among the trees heard its\npitiful cries. At last it grew so weak for want of food that it could\nonly moan and move its head a little from side to side. It would have\ndied before another day if nobody had cared for it.",
        "Just before dark on the second evening, a she-bear came strolling down\nthe mountain side from her den. She was out looking for her cubs, for\nsome hunters had stolen them that very day while she was away from home.\nShe heard the moans of the little babe, and wondered if it was not one\nof her lost cubs; and when she saw it lying so helpless on the moss she\nwent to it and looked at it kindly. Was it possible that a little bear\ncould be changed into a pretty babe with fat white hands and with a\nbeautiful gold chain around its neck? The old bear did not know; and as\nthe child looked at her with its bright black eyes, she growled softly\nand licked its face with her warm tongue and then lay down beside it,\njust as she would have done with her own little cubs. The babe was too\nyoung to feel afraid, and it cuddled close to the old bear and felt that\nit had found a friend. After a while it fell asleep; but the bear\nguarded it until morning and then went down the mountain side to look\nfor food.",
        "In the evening, before dark, the bear came again and carried the child\nto her own den under the shelter of a rock where vines and wild flowers\ngrew; and every day after that she came and gave the child food and\nplayed with it. And all the bears on the mountain learned about the\nwonderful cub that had been found, and came to see it; but not one of\nthem offered to harm it. And the little girl grew fast and became\nstrong, and after a while could walk and run among the trees and rocks\nand brambles on the round top of the mountain; but her bear mother would\nnot allow her to wander far from the den beneath the rock where the\nvines and the wild flowers grew.",
        "One day some hunters came up the mountain to look for game, and one of\nthem pulled aside the vines which grew in front of the old bear’s home.\nHe was surprised to see the beautiful child lying on the grass and\nplaying with the flowers which she had gathered. But at sight of him she\nleaped to her feet and bounded away like a frightened deer. She led the\nhunters a fine chase among the trees and rocks; but there were a dozen\nof them, and it was not long till they caught her.",
        "The hunters had never taken such game as that before, and they were so\nwell satisfied that they did not care to hunt any more that day. The\nchild struggled and fought as hard as she knew how, but it was of no\nuse. The hunters carried her down the mountain, and took her to the\nhouse where they lived on the other side of the forest. At first she\ncried all the time, for she sadly missed the bear that had been a mother\nto her so long. But the hunters made a great pet of her, and gave her\nmany pretty things to play with, and were very kind; and it was not long\ntill she began to like her new home.",
        "The hunters named her Atalanta, and when she grew older, they made her a\nbow and arrows, and taught her how to shoot; and they gave her a light\nspear, and showed her how to carry it and how to hurl it at the game or\nat an enemy. Then they took her with them when they went hunting, and\nthere was nothing in the world that pleased her so much as roaming\nthrough the woods and running after the deer and other wild animals. Her\nfeet became very swift, so that she could run faster than any of the\nmen; and her arms were so strong and her eyes so sharp and true that\nwith her arrow or her spear she never missed the mark. And she grew up\nto be very tall and graceful, and was known throughout all Arcadia as\nthe fleet-footed huntress.",
        "Now, not very far from the land of Arcadia there was a little city named\nCalydon. It lay in the midst of rich wheat fields and fruitful\nvineyards; but beyond the vineyards there was a deep dense forest where\nmany wild beasts lived. The king of Calydon was named OEneus, and he\ndwelt in a white palace with his wife Althea and his boys and girls. His\nkingdom was so small that it was not much trouble to govern it, and so\nhe spent the most of his time in hunting or in plowing or in looking\nafter his grape vines. He was said to be a very brave man, and he was\nthe friend of all the great heroes of that heroic time.",
        "The two daughters of OEneus and Althea were famed all over the world for\ntheir beauty; and one of them was the wife of the hero Hercules, who\nhad freed Prometheus from his chains, and done many other mighty deeds.\nThe six sons of OEneus and Althea were noble, handsome fellows; but the\nnoblest and handsomest of them all was Meleager, the youngest.",
        "When Meleager was a tiny babe only seven days old, a strange thing\nhappened in the white palace of the king. Queen Althea awoke in the\nmiddle of the night, and saw a fire blazing on the hearth. She wondered\nwhat it could mean; and she lay quite still by the side of the babe, and\nlooked and listened. Three strange women were standing by the hearth.\nThey were tall, and two of them were beautiful, and the faces of all\nwere stern. Althea knew at once that they were the Fates who give gifts\nof some kind to every child that is born, and who say whether his life\nshall be a happy one or full of sadness and sorrow.",
        "“What shall we give to this child?” said the eldest and sternest of the\nthree strangers. Her name was Atropos, and she held a pair of sharp\nshears in her hand.",
        "“I give him a brave heart,” said the youngest and fairest. Her name was\nClotho, and she held a distaff full of flax, from which she was spinning\na golden thread.",
        "“And I give him a gentle, noble mind,” said the dark-haired one, whose\nname was Lachesis. She gently drew out the thread which Clotho spun, and\nturning to stern Atropos, said: “Lay aside those shears, sister, and\ngive the child your gift.”",
        "“I give him life until this brand shall be burned to ashes,” was the\nanswer; and Atropos took a small stick of wood and laid it on the\nburning coals.",
        "The three sisters waited till the stick was ablaze, and then they were\ngone. Althea sprang up quickly. She saw nothing but the fire on the\nhearth and the stick burning slowly away. She made haste to pour water\nupon the blaze, and when every spark was put out, she took the charred\nstick and put it into a strong chest where she kept her treasures, and\nlocked it up.",
        "“I know that the child’s life is safe,” she said, “so long as that stick\nis kept unburned.”",
        "And so, as the years went by, Meleager grew up to be a brave young man,\nso gentle and noble that his name became known in every land of Greece.\nHe did many daring deeds and, with other heroes, went on a famous voyage\nacross the seas in search of a marvelous fleece of gold; and when he\nreturned to Calydon the people declared that he was the worthiest of the\nsons of OEneus to become their king.",
        "Now it happened one summer that the vineyards of Calydon were fuller of\ngrapes than they had ever been before, and there was so much wheat in\nthe fields that the people did not know what to do with it.",
        "“I will tell you what to do,” said King OEneus. “We will have a\nthanksgiving day, and we will give some of the grain and some of the\nfruit to the Mighty Beings who sit among the clouds on the mountain top.\nFor it is from them that the sunshine and the fair weather and the moist\nwinds and the warm rains have come; and without their aid we could never\nhave had so fine a harvest.”",
        "The very next day the king and the people of Calydon went out into the\nfields and vineyards to offer up their thank offerings. Here and there\nthey built little altars of turf and stones and laid dry grass and twigs\nupon them; and then on top of the twigs they put some of the largest\nbunches of grapes and some of the finest heads of wheat, which they\nthought would please the Mighty Beings who had sent them so great\nplenty.",
        "There was one altar for Ceres, who had shown men how to sow grain, and\none for Bacchus, who had told them about the grape, and one for\nwing-footed Mercury, who comes in the clouds, and one for Athena, the\nqueen of the air, and one for the keeper of the winds, and one for the\ngiver of light, and one for the driver of the golden sun car, and one\nfor the king of the sea, and one–which was the largest of all–for\nJupiter, the mighty thunderer who sits upon the mountain top and rules\nthe world. And when everything was ready, King OEneus gave the word, and\nfire was touched to the grass and the twigs upon the altars; and the\ngrapes and the wheat that had been laid there were burned up. Then the\npeople shouted and danced, for they fancied that in that way the thank\nofferings were sent right up to Ceres and Bacchus and Mercury and Athena\nand all the rest. And in the evening they went home with glad hearts,\nfeeling that they had done right.",
        "But they had forgotten one of the Mighty Beings. They had not raised any\naltar to Diana, the fair huntress and queen of the woods, and they had\nnot offered her a single grape or a single grain of wheat. They had not\nintended to slight her; but, to tell the truth, there were so many\nothers that they had never once thought about her.",
        "I do not suppose that Diana cared anything at all for the fruit or the\ngrain; but it made her very angry to think that she should be forgotten.\n “I’ll show them that I am not to be slighted in this way,” she said.",
        "All went well, however, until the next summer; and the people of Calydon\nwere very happy, for it looked as though there would be a bigger harvest\nthan ever.",
        "“I tell you,” said old King OEneus, looking over his fields and his\nvineyards, “it pays to give thanks. We’ll have another thanksgiving as\nsoon as the grapes begin to ripen.”",
        "But even then he did not think of Diana.",
        "The very next day the largest and fiercest wild boar that anybody had\never seen came rushing out of the forest. He had two long tusks which\nstuck far out of his mouth on either side and were as sharp as knives,\nand the stiff bristles on his back were as large and as long as knitting\nneedles. As he went tearing along towards Calydon, champing his teeth\nand foaming at the mouth, he was a frightful thing to look at, I tell\nyou. Everybody fled before him. He rushed into the wheat fields and tore\nup all the grain; he went into the vineyards and broke down all the\nvines; he rooted up all the trees in the orchards; and, when there was\nnothing else to do, he went into the pasture lands among the hills and\nkilled the sheep that were feeding there. He was so fierce and so fleet\nof foot that the bravest warrior hardly dared to attack him. His thick\nskin was proof against arrows and against such spears as the people of\nCalydon had; and I do not know how many men he killed with those\nterrible razor tusks of his. For weeks he had pretty much his own way,\nand the only safe place for anybody was inside of the walls.",
        "When he had laid waste the whole country he went back into the edge of\nthe forest; but the people were so much afraid of him that they lived in\ndread every day lest he should come again and tear down the gates of the\ncity.",
        "“We must have forgotten somebody when we gave thanks last year,” said\nKing OEneus. “Who could it have been?”",
        "And then he thought of Diana.",
        "“Diana, the queen of the chase,” said he, “has sent this monster to\npunish us for forgetting her. I am sure that we shall remember her now\nas long as we live.”",
        "Then he sent messengers into all the countries near Calydon, asking the\nbravest men and skillfullest hunters to come at a certain time and help\nhim hunt and kill the great wild boar. Very many of these men had been\nwith Meleager in that wonderful voyage in search of the Golden Fleece,\nand he felt sure they would come.",
        "When the day came which King OEneus had set, there was a wonderful\ngathering of men at Calydon. The greatest heroes in the world were\nthere; and every one was fully armed, and expected to have fine sport\nhunting the terrible wild boar. With the warriors from the south there\ncame a tall maiden armed with bow and arrows and a long hunting spear.\nIt was our friend Atalanta, the huntress.",
        "“My daughters are having a game of ball in the garden,” said old King\nOEneus. “Wouldn’t you like to put away your arrows and your spear, and\ngo and play with them?”",
        "Atalanta shook her head and lifted her chin as if in disdain.",
        "“Perhaps you would rather stay with the queen, and look at the women\nspin and weave,” said OEneus.",
        "“No,” answered Atalanta, “I am going with the warriors to hunt the wild\nboar in the forest!”",
        "How all the men opened their eyes! They had never heard of such a thing\nas a girl going out with heroes to hunt wild boars.",
        "“If she goes, then I will not,” said one.",
        "“Nor I, either,” said another.",
        "“Nor I,” said a third. “Why, the whole world would laugh at us, and we\nshould never hear the end of it.”",
        "Several threatened to go home at once; and two brothers of Queen Althea,\nrude, unmannerly fellows, loudly declared that the hunt was for heroes\nand not for puny girls.",
        "But Atalanta only grasped her spear more firmly and stood up, tall and\nstraight, in the gateway of the palace. Just then a handsome young man\ncame forward. It was Meleager.",
        "“What’s this?” he cried. “Who says that Atalanta shall not go to the\nhunt? You are afraid that she’ll be braver than you–that is all. Pretty\nheroes you are! Let all such cowards go home at once.”",
        "But nobody went, and it was settled then and there that the maiden\nshould have her own way. And yet the brothers of Queen Althea kept on\nmuttering and complaining.",
        "For nine days the heroes and huntsmen feasted in the halls of King\nOEneus, and early on the tenth they set out for the forest. Soon the\ngreat beast was found, and he came charging out upon his foes. The\nheroes hid behind the trees or climbed up among the branches, for they\nhad not expected to see so terrible a creature. He stood in the middle\nof a little open space, tearing up the ground with his tusks. The white\nfoam rolled from his mouth, his eyes glistened red like fire, and he\ngrunted so fiercely that the woods and hills echoed with fearful sounds.",
        "Then one of the bravest of the men threw his spear. But that only made\nthe beast fiercer than ever; he charged upon the warrior, caught him\nbefore he could save himself, and tore him in pieces with his tusks.\nAnother man ventured too far from his hiding-place and was also\novertaken and killed. One of the oldest and noblest of the heroes\nleveled his spear and threw it with all his force; but it only grazed\nthe boar’s tough skin and glanced upward and pierced the heart of a\nwarrior on the other side. The boar was getting the best of the fight.",
        "Atalanta now ran forward and threw her spear. It struck the boar in the\nback, and a great stream of blood gushed out. A warrior let fly an arrow\nwhich put out one of the beast’s eyes. Then Meleager rushed up and\npierced his heart with his spear. The boar could no longer stand up; but\nhe fought fiercely for some moments, and then rolled over, dead.",
        "The heroes then cut off the beast’s head. It was as much as six of them\ncould carry. Then they took the skin from his great body and offered it\nto Meleager as a prize, because he had given the death wound to the wild\nboar. But Meleager said:",
        "“It belongs to Atalanta, because it was she who gave him the very first\nwound.” And he gave it to her as the prize of honor.",
        "You ought to have seen the tall huntress maiden then, as she stood among\nthe trees with the boar’s skin thrown over her left shoulder and\nreaching down to her feet. She had never looked so much like the queen\nof the woods. But the rude brothers of Queen Althea were vexed to think\nthat a maiden should win the prize, and they began to make trouble. One\nof them snatched Atalanta’s spear from her hand, and dragged the prize\nfrom her shoulders, and the other pushed her rudely and bade her go back\nto Arcadia and live again with the she-bears on the mountain side. All\nthis vexed Meleager, and he tried to make his uncles give back the spear\nand the prize, and stop their unmannerly talk. But they grew worse and\nworse, and at last set upon Meleager, and would have killed him if he\nhad not drawn his sword to defend himself. A fight followed, and the\nrude fellows struck right and left as though they were blind. Soon both\nwere stretched dead upon the ground. Some who did not see the fight said\nthat Meleager killed them, but I would rather believe that they killed\neach other in their drunken fury.",
        "And now all the company started back to the city. Some carried the\nboar’s huge head, and some the different parts of his body, while others\nhad made biers of the green branches, and bore upon them the dead bodies\nof those who had been slain. It was indeed a strange procession.",
        "A young man who did not like Meleager, had run on in front and had\nreached the city before the rest of the company had fairly started.\nQueen Althea was standing at the door of the palace, and when she saw\nhim she asked what had happened in the forest He told her at once that\nMeleager had killed her brothers, for he knew that, with all their\nfaults, she loved them very dearly. It was terrible to see her grief.\nShe shrieked, and tore her hair, and rushed wildly about from room to\nroom. Her senses left her, and she did not know what she was doing.",
        "It was the custom at that time for people to avenge the death of their\nkindred, and her only thought was how to punish the murderer of her\nbrothers. In her madness she forgot that Meleager was her son. Then she\nthought of the three Fates and of the unburned firebrand which she had\nlocked up in her chest so many years before. She ran and got the stick\nand threw it into the fire that was burning on the hearth.",
        "It kindled at once, and she watched it as it blazed up brightly. Then\nit began to turn into ashes, and as the last spark died out, the noble\nMeleager, who was walking by the side of Atalanta, dropped to the ground\ndead.",
        "When they carried the news to Althea she said not a word, for then she\nknew what she had done, and her heart was broken. She turned silently\naway and went to her own room. When the king came home a few minutes\nlater, he found her dead.",
        "So ended the hunt in the wood of Calydon.",
        "After the death of Meleager, Atalanta went back to her old home among\nthe mountains of Arcadia. She was still the swift-footed huntress, and\nshe was never so happy as when in the green woods wandering among the\ntrees or chasing the wild deer. All the world had heard about her,\nhowever; and the young heroes in the lands nearest to Arcadia did\nnothing else but talk about her beauty and her grace and her swiftness\nof foot and her courage. Of course every one of these young fellows\nwanted her to become his wife; and she might have been a queen any day\nif she had only said the word, for the richest king in Greece would have\nbeen glad to marry her. But she cared nothing for any of the young men,\nand she liked the freedom of the green woods better than all the fine\nthings she might have had in a palace.",
        "The young men would not take “No!” for an answer, however. They could\nnot believe that she really meant it, and so they kept coming and\nstaying until the woods of Arcadia were full of them, and there was no\ngetting along with them at all. So, when she could think of no other way\nto get rid of them, Atalanta called them together and said:",
        "“You want to marry me, do you? Well, if any one of you would like to run\na race with me from this mountain to the bank of the river over there,\nhe may do so; and I will be the wife of the one who outruns me.”",
        "“Agreed! agreed!” cried all the young fellows.",
        "“But, listen!” she said. “Whoever tries this race must also agree that\nif I outrun him, he must lose his life.”",
        "Ah, what long faces they all had then! About half of them drew away and\nwent home.",
        "“But won’t you give us the start of you a little?” asked the others.",
        "“Oh, yes,” she answered. “I will give you the start by a hundred paces.\nBut remember, if I overtake any one before he reaches the river, he\nshall lose his head that very day.”",
        "Several others now found that they were in ill health or that business\ncalled them home; and when they were next looked for, they were not to\nbe found. But a good many who had had some practice in sprinting across\nthe country stayed and made up their minds to try their luck. Could a\nmere girl outrun such fine fellows as they? Nonsense!",
        "And so it happened that a race was run almost every day. And almost\nevery day some poor fellow lost his head; for the fleetest-footed\nsprinter in all Greece was overtaken by Atalanta long before he could\nreach the river bank. But other young men kept coming and coming, and no\nsooner had one been put out of the way than another took his place.",
        "One day there came from a distant town a handsome, tall young man named\nMeilanion.",
        "“You’d better not run with me,” said Atalanta, “for I shall be sure to\novertake you, and that will be the end of you.”",
        "“We’ll see about that,” said Meilanion.",
        "Now Meilanion, before coming to try his chance, had talked with Venus,\nthe queen of love, who lived with Jupiter among the clouds on the\nmountain top. And he was so handsome and gentle and wise that Venus took\npity on him, and gave him three golden apples and told him what to do.",
        "Well, when all was ready for the race, Atalanta tried again to persuade\nMeilanion not to run, for she also took pity on him.",
        "“I’ll be sure to overtake you,” she said.",
        "“All right!” said Meilanion, and away he sped; but he had the three\ngolden applies in his pocket.",
        "Atalanta gave him a good start, and then she followed after, as swift as\nan arrow shot from the bow. Meilanion was not a very fast runner, and it\nwould not be hard for her to overtake him. She thought that she would\nlet him get almost to the goal, for she really pitied him. He heard her\ncoming close behind him; he heard her quick breath as she gained on him\nvery fast. Then he threw one of the golden apples over his shoulder.",
        "Now, if there was anything in the world that Atalanta admired, it was a\nbright stone or a pretty piece of yellow gold. As the apple fell to the\nground she saw how beautiful it was, and she stopped to pick it up; and\nwhile she was doing this, Meilanion gained a good many paces. But what\nof that? In a minute she was as close behind him as ever. And yet, she\nreally did pity him.",
        "Just then Meilanion threw the second apple over his shoulder. It was\nhandsomer and larger than the first, and Atalanta could not bear the\nthought of allowing some one else to get it. So she stopped to pick it\nup from among the long grass, where it had fallen. It took somewhat\nlonger to find it than she had expected, and when she looked up again\nMeilanion was a hundred feet ahead of her. But that was no matter. She\ncould easily overtake him. And yet, how she did pity the foolish young\nman!",
        "Meilanion heard her speeding like the wind behind him. He took the third\napple and threw it over to one side of the path where the ground sloped\ntowards the river. Atalanta’s quick eye saw that it was far more\nbeautiful than either of the others. If it were not picked up at once it\nwould roll down into the deep water and be lost, and that would never\ndo. She turned aside from her course and ran after it. It was easy\nenough to overtake the apple, but while she was doing so Meilanion\ngained upon her again. He was almost to the goal. How she strained every\nmuscle now to overtake him! But, after all, she felt that she did not\ncare very much. He was the handsomest young man that she had ever seen,\nand he had given her three golden apples. It would be a great pity if he\nshould have to die. And so she let him reach the goal first.",
        "After that, of course, Atalanta became Meilanion’s wife. And he took her\nwith him to his distant home, and there they lived happily together for\nmany, many years.",
