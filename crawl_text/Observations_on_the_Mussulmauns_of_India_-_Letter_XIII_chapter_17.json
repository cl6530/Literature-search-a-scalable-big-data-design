        "  Plurality of wives.–Mahumud’s motive for permitting this\n  privilege.–State of society at the commencement of the Prophet’s\n  mission.–His injunctions respecting marriage.–Parents invariably\n  determine on the selection of a husband.–First marriages attended by\n  a public ceremony.–The first wife takes precedence of all\n  others.–Generosity of deposition evinced by the Mussulmaun\n  ladies.–Divorces obtained under certain restrictions.–Period of\n  solemnizing marriage.–Method adopted in choosing a husband or\n  wife.–Overtures and contracts of marriage, how regulated.–Mugganee,\n  the first contract.–Dress of the bride elect on this occasion.–The\n  ceremonies described as witnessed.–Remarks on the bride.–Present\n  from the bridegroom on Buckrah Eade.",
        "The Mussulmauns have permission from their Lawgiver to be pluralists in\nwives, as well as the Israelites of old.[1] Mahumud’s motive for\nrestricting the number of wives each man might lawfully marry, was, say\nhis biographers, for the purpose of reforming the then existing state of\nsociety, and correcting abuses of long standing amongst the Arabians.",
        "My authority tells me, that at the period of Mahumud’s commencing his\nmission, the Arabians were a most abandoned and dissolute people, guilty\nof every excess that can debase the character of man: drunkards,\nprofligate, and overbearing barbarians, both in principle and action.\nMahumud is said unvariedly to have manifested kindly feelings towards the\nweaker sex, who, he considered, were intended to be the companion and\nsolace of man, and not the slave of his ungovernable sensuality or caprice;\nhe set the best possible example in his own domestic circle, and\ninstituted such laws as were then needed to restrain vice and promote the\nhappiness of those Arabians who had received him as a Prophet. He forbade\nall kinds of fermented liquors, which were then in common use; and to the\nfrequent intoxication of the men, were attributed their vicious habits,\nbase pursuits, and unmanly cruelty to the poor females. Mahumud’s code of\nlaws relating to marriage restricted them to a limited number of wives;\nfor at that period they all possessed crowded harems, many of the\ninhabitants of which were the victims of their reckless persecution; young\nfemales torn from the bosom of their families and immured in the vilest\nstate of bondage, to be cast out upon the wide world to starvation and\nmisery, whenever the base master of the house or tent desired to make room\nfor a fresh supply, often the spoils of his predatory excursions.",
        "By the laws of Mahumud his followers are restrained from concubinage; they\nare equally restricted from forced marriages. The number of their wives\nmust be regulated by their means of supporting them, the law strictly\nforbidding neglect, or unkind treatment of any one of the number his\nfollowers may deem it convenient to marry.",
        "At the period when Mahumud issued these necessary laws for the security of\nfemale comfort and the moral habits of the males, there existed a practice\nwith the Arabs of forcing young women to marry against their inclination,\nadding, year by year, to the many wretched creatures doomed, for a time,\nto all the miseries of a crowded hut; and at last, when tired of their\npersons or unable to provide them with sustenance, turning them adrift\nwithout a home, a friend, or a meal. To the present day the law against\nforced marriages is revered, and no marriage contract can be deemed lawful\nwithout the necessary form of inquiry by the Maulvee, who, in the presence\nof witnesses, demands of the young lady, ’whether the contract is by her\nown free will and consent?’ This, however, I am disposed to think, in the\npresent age, is little else than a mere form of ’fulfilling the law’ since\nthe engagement is made by the parents of both parties, the young couple\nbeing passive subjects to the parental arrangement, for their benefit as\nthey are assured. The young lady, from her rigid seclusion, has no prior\nattachment, and she is educated to be ’obedient to her husband’. She is\ntaught from her earliest youth to look forward to such match as her kind\nparents may think proper to provide for her; and, therefore, can have no\nobjection to accepting the husband selected for her by them. The parents,\nloving their daughter, and aware of the responsibility resting on them,\nare cautious in selecting for their girls suitable husbands, according to\ntheir particular view of the eligibility of the suitor.",
        "The first marriage of a Mussulmaun is the only one where a public display\nof the ceremony is deemed necessary, and the first wife is always\nconsidered the head of his female establishment. Although he may be the\nhusband of many wives in the course of time, and some of them prove\ngreater favourites, yet the first wife takes precedence in all matters\nwhere dignity is to be preserved. And when the several wives meet–each\nhave separate habitations if possible–all the rest pay to the first wife\nthat deference which superiority exacts from inferiors; not only do the\nsecondary wives pay this respect to the first, but the whole circle of\nrelations and friends make the same distinction, as a matter of course;\nfor the first wife takes precedence in every way.",
        "Should the first wife fortunately present her husband with a son, he is\nthe undisputed heir; but the children of every subsequent wife are equals\nin the father’s estimation. Should the husband be dissolute and have\noffspring by concubines–which is not very common,–those children are\nremembered and provided for in the distribution of his property; and, as\nvery often occurs, they are cherished by the wives with nearly as much\ncare as their own children; but illegitimate offspring very seldom marry\nin the same rank their father held in society.",
        "The latitude allowed by ’the law’ preserves the many-wived Mussulmaun from\nthe world’s censure; and his conscience rests unaccused when he adds to\nhis numbers, if he cannot reproach himself with having neglected or\nunkindly treated any of the number bound to him, or their children. But\nthe privilege is not always indulged in by the Mussulmauns; much depends\non circumstances, and more on the man’s disposition. If it be the happy\nlot of a kind-hearted, good man to be married to a woman of assimilating\nmind, possessing the needful requisites to render home agreeable, and a\nprospect of an increasing family, then the husband has no motive to draw\nhim into further engagements, and he is satisfied with one wife. Many such\nmen I have known in Hindoostaun, particularly among the Syaads and\nreligious characters, who deem a plurality of wives a plague to the\npossessors in proportion to their numbers.",
        "The affluent, the sensualist, and the ambitious, are most prone to swell\nthe numbers in their harem. With some men, who are not highly gifted\nintellectually, it is esteemed a mark of gentility to have several wives.",
        "There are some instances of remarkable generosity in the conduct of good\nwives (which would hardly gain credit with females differently educated),\nnot necessary to the subject before me; but I may here add to the praise\nof a good wife among these people, that she never utters a reproach, nor\ngives evidence by word or manner in her husband’s presence that she has\nany cause for regret; she receives him with undisguised pleasure, although\nshe has just before learned that another member has been added to his\nwell-peopled harem. The good and forbearing wife, by this line of conduct,\nsecures to herself the confidence of her husband; who, feeling assured\nthat the amiable woman has an interest in his happiness, will consult her\nand take her advice in the domestic affairs of his children by other wives,\nand even arrange by her judgment all the settlements for their marriages,\n&c. He can speak of other wives without restraint,–for she knows he has\nothers,–and her education has taught her, that they deserve her respect\nin proportion as they contribute to her husband’s happiness. The children\nof her husband are admitted at all times and seasons, without restraint or\nprejudice; she loves them next to her own, because they are her husband’s.\nShe receives the mothers of such children without a shade of jealousy in\nher manner, and delights in distinguishing them by favours and presents\naccording to their several merits. From this picture of many living wives\nin Mussulmaun society, it must not be supposed I am speaking of women\nwithout attachment to their husbands; on the contrary, they are persons\nwho are really susceptible of pure love, and the generosity of their\nconduct is one of the ways in which they prove themselves devoted to their\nhusband’s happiness. This, they say, was the lesson taught them by their\namiable mother, and this is the example they would set for the imitation\nof their daughters.",
        "I do not mean to say this is a faithful picture of all the females of\nzeenahnah life. The mixture of good and bad tempers or dispositions is not\nconfined to any class or complexion of people, but is to be met with in\nevery quarter of the globe. In general, I have observed those females of\nthe Mussulmaun population who have any claim to genteel life, and whose\nhabits are guided by religious principles, evince such traits of character\nas would constitute the virtuous and thoroughly obedient wife in any\ncountry; and many, whom I have had the honour to know personally, would do\ncredit to the most enlightened people in the world.",
        "Should the first wife prove a termagant or unfaithful–rare occurrences\namongst the inmates of the harem,–the husband has the liberty of\ndivorcing her by paying down her stipulated dowry. This dowry is an\nengagement made by the husband on the night of Baarraat[2] (when the\nbridegroom is about to take his bride from her parents to his own home).\nOn which occasion the Maulvee asks the bridegroom to name the amount of\nhis wife’s dowry, in the event of separation; the young man is at liberty\nto name any sum he pleases. It would not prevent the marriage if the\nsmallest amount were promised; but he is in the presence of his bride’s\nfamily, and within her hearing also, though he has not yet seen her;–it\nis a critical moment for him, thus surrounded. Besides, as he never\nintends to separate from the lady, in the strict letter of the law, he\ncannot refrain from gratifying those interested in the honour he is about\nto confer by the value of the promised dowry, and, therefore, he names a\nvery heavy sum, which perhaps his whole generation never could have\ncollected in their joint lives. This sum would of itself be a barrier to\ndivorce; but that is not the only object which influences the Mussulmaun\ngenerally to waive the divorce; it is because they would not publish their\nown disgrace, by divorcing an unfaithful or undutiful wife.",
        "If the first wife dies, a second is sought after on the same principle\nwhich guided the first–’a superior to head his house’. In this case there\nwould be the same public display which marked the first wife’s marriage;\nall the minor or secondary wives being introduced to the zeenahnah\nprivately; they are in consequence termed Dhollie[3] wives, or brought\nhome under cover.",
        "Many great men appear to be close imitators of King Solomon, with whose\nhistory they are perfectly conversant, for I have heard of the sovereign\nprinces in Hindoostaun having seven or eight hundred wives at one time in\ntheir palaces. This is hearsay report only, and I should hope an\nexaggeration.[4]",
        "The first marriage is usually solemnized when the youth is eighteen, and\nthe young lady thirteen, or fourteen at the most; many are married at an\nearlier age, when, in the opinion of the parents, an eligible match is to\nbe secured. And in some cases, where the parents on both sides have the\nunion of their children at heart, they contract them at six or seven years\nold, which marriage they solemnly bind themselves to fulfil when the\nchildren have reached a proper age; under these circumstances the children\nare allowed to live in the same house, and often form an attachment for\neach other, which renders their union a life of real happiness.",
        "There are to be found in Mussulmaun society parents of mercenary minds,\nwho prefer giving their daughters in marriage as dhollie wives to noblemen\nor men of property, to the preferable plan of uniting them with a husband\nof their own grade, with whom the girl would most likely live without a\nrival in the mud-walled tenement; this will explain the facilities offered\nto a sovereign or nobleman in extending the numbers of his harem.",
        "Some parents excuse themselves in thus disposing of their daughters on the\nscore of poverty, and the difficulty they find in defraying the expenses\nof a wedding: this I conceive to be one great error in the economy of the\nMussulmaun people,–unnecessary expense incurred in their marriage\nceremonies, which hampers them through life in their circumstances.\nParents, however poor, will not allow their daughter to be conveyed from\ntheir home, where the projected union is with an equal, without a\nseemingly needless parade of music, and a marriage-portion in goods and\nchattels, if they have no fortune to give beside; then the expense of\nproviding dinners for friends to make the event conspicuous, and the\nuseless articles of finery for the girl’s person, with many other ways of\nexpending money, to the detriment of the parents’ finances, without any\nvery substantial benefit to the young couple. But this dearly-loved custom\ncannot be passed over; and if the parents find it impossible to meet the\npecuniary demands of these ceremonies, the girl has no alternative but to\nlive out her days singly, unless by an agent’s influence she is accepted\nas a dhollie wife to some man of wealth.",
        "Girls are considered to have passed their prime when they number from\nsixteen to eighteen years; even the poorest peasant would object to a wife\nof eighteen.",
        "There has been the same difficulty to encounter in every age of Mussulmaun\nhistory in Hindoostaun; and in the darker periods of civilization, the\nobstacles to settling their daughters to advantage induced the villagers\nand the uneducated to follow the example of the Rajpoots, viz., to destroy\nthe greater proportion of females at their birth. In the present age, this\nhorrid custom is never heard of amongst any classes of the Mussulmaun\npopulation[5]; but by the Rajpoot Hindoos it is still practised, as one of\ntheir chiefs very lately acknowledged in the presence of a friend of mine.\nI have often heard Meer Hadjee Shaah declare that it was a common\noccurrence within his recollection, among the lower classes of the people\nin the immediate vicinity of Loodeeanah,[6] where he lived when a boy; and\nthat the same practice existed in the Oude territory, amongst the\npeasantry even at a much later date. One of the Nuwaubs of Oude,–I think\nAsoof ood Dowlah,–hearing with horror of the frequent recurrence of this\natrocity in the remote parts of his province, issued a proclamation to his\nsubjects, commanding them to desist from the barbarous custom[7]; and, as\nan inducement to the wicked parents to preserve their female offspring\nalive, grants of land were to be awarded to every female as a\nmarriage-portion on her arriving at a proper age.",
        "It is generally to be observed in a Mussulmaun’s family, even at this day,\nthat the birth of a girl produces a temporary gloom, whilst the birth of a\nboy gives rise to a festival in the zeenahnah. Some are wicked enough to\nsay, ’It is more honourable to have sons than daughters’, but I believe\nthe real cause is the difficulty to be encountered in settling the latter\nsuitably.",
        "The important affair of fixing upon a desirable match for their sons and\ndaughters is the source of constant anxiety in the family of every\nMussulmaun, from the children’s earliest years to the period of its\naccomplishment.",
        "There is a class of people who make it the business of their lives to\nnegotiate marriages. Both men and women of this description are of course\ningeniously expert in the art of talking, and able to put the best\ncolouring on the affair they undertake; they occupy every day of their\nlives in roving about from house to house, and, as they have always\nsomething entertaining to say, they generally gain easy admittance; they\nmake themselves acquainted with the domestic affairs of one family in\norder to convey them to another, and so continue in their line of\ngossiping, until the economy of every person’s house is familiar to all.\nThe female gossip in her researches in zeenahnahs, finds out all the\nexpectations a mother entertains for her marriageable sons or daughters,\nand details whatever she learns in such or such a zeenahnah, as likely to\nmeet the views of her present hostess. Every one knows the object of these\nvisits, and if they have any secret that the world may not participate in,\nthere is due caution observed that it may not transpire before this Mrs.\nGad-about.",
        "When intelligence is brought, by means of such agency, to the mother of a\nson who happens to be marriageable, that a lady of proper rank has a\ndaughter to be sought, she consults with her husband, and further\ninquiries are instituted amongst their several friends, male and female;\nafter due deliberation, the connexion being found desirable, the father\nwill consult an omen before negotiations are commenced. The omen to decide\nthe important step is as follows:–Several slips of paper are cut up, on\nhalf the number is written ’to be’, on the other half, ’not to be’; these\npapers are mixed together and placed under the prayer-carpet. When the\ngood Mussulmaun is preparing for his evening Namaaz he fails not in his\ndevotions to ask for help and guidance in an affair of so much importance\nto the father as the happiness and well-being of his son. At the portion\nof the service when he bows down his head to God, he beseeches with much\nhumility, calling on the great power and goodness of God to instruct and\nguide him for the best interest of his child; and then he repeats a short\nprayer expressive of his reliance on the wisdom of God, and his perfect\nsubmission to whatever may be His wise decree in this important business.\nThe prayer concluded, he seats himself with solemn gravity on the\nprayer-carpet, again and again imploring Divine guidance, without which he\nis sure nothing good can accrue: he then draws one slip from under his\ncarpet; if ’to be’ is produced, he places it by his left side;–a second\nslip is drawn out, should that also bear the words ’to be’ the business is\nso far decided. He then offers thanks and praises to God, congratulates\nhis wife on the successful issue of the omen, and discusses those plans\nwhich appear most likely to further the prospects of their dearly-loved\nson. But should the second and third papers say ’not to be’ he is assured\nin his heart it was so decided by ’that Wisdom which cannot err:’ to whom\nhe gives praise and glory for all mercies received at His hand: after this\nno overture or negotiation would be listened to by the pious father from\nthe same quarter.[8]",
        "The omen, however, proving favourable, the affair is decided; and in order\nto gain the best possible information of the real disposition of all\nparties concerned, a confidential friend is sent to the zeenahnah of the\nyoung lady’s mother to make her own observations on what passes within;\nand to ascertain, if possible, whether the report brought by the female\nagent was true or exaggerated; and finally, to learn if their son would be\nreceived or rejected as a suitor, provided advances were made.",
        "The female friend returns, after a day or two’s absence, to the anxious\nparents of the youth, and details all she has seen or heard during her\nvisit. The young lady may, perhaps, have been seen (this is not always\nconceded to such visitors), in which case her person, her manners, her\napparent disposition, the hospitality and good breeding of the mother and\nother members of the zeenahnah, are described; and lastly, it is hinted\nthat, all other things suiting, the young lady being yet disengaged, the\nprojected offer would not be disagreeable to her parents.",
        "The father of the youth then resolves on sending a male agent in due form\nto negotiate a marriage, unless he happens to be personally acquainted\nwith the girl’s father; in which case the lady is desired to send her\nfemale agent on the embassy, and the father of the youth speaks on the\nsubject in the meantime to the girl’s father.",
        "A very intimate friend of mine was seeking for a suitable match for her\nson, and being much in her confidence, I was initiated in all the\nmysteries and arrangements (according to Mussulmaun rule) of the affair\npending the marriage of her son.",
        "The young lady to be sought (wooed we should have it), had been described\nas amiable and pretty–advantages as much esteemed as her rank;–fortune\nshe had none worth mentioning, but it was what is termed in Indian society\na good and equal match. The overture was, therefore, to be made from the\nyouth’s family in the following manner:",
        "On a silver tray covered with gold brocade and fringed with silver, was\nlaid the youth’s pedigree, traced by a neat writer in the Persian\ncharacter, on richly embossed paper ornamented and emblazoned with gold\nfigures. The youth being a Syaad, his pedigree was traced up to Mahumud,\nin both paternal and maternal lines, and many a hero and Begum of their\nnoble blood filled up the space from the Prophet down to the youthful Meer\nMahumud, my friend’s son.",
        "On the tray, with the pedigree, was laid a nuzza, or offering of five gold\nmohurs, and twenty-one (the lucky number) rupees; a brocaded cover,\nfringed with silver, was spread over the whole, and this was conveyed by\nthe male agent to the young Begum’s father. The tray and its contents are\nretained for ever, if the proposal is accepted: if rejected, the parties\nreturn the whole without delay, which is received as a tacit proof that\nthe suitor is rejected: no further explanation is ever given or required.",
        "In the present instance the tray was detained, and in a few days after a\nfemale from their family was sent to my friend’s house to make a general\nscrutiny of the zeenahnah and its inmates. This female was pressed to stay\na day or two, and in that time many important subjects underwent\ndiscussion. The youth was introduced, and everything according with the\nviews entertained by both parties, the fathers met, and the marriage, it\nwas decided, should take place within a twelvemonth, when the young lady\nwould have accomplished her thirteenth year.",
        "’Do you decide on having Mugganee[9] performed?’ is the question proposed\nby the father of the youth to the father of the young maiden. In the\npresent case it was chosen, and great were the preparations of my friend\nto do all possible honour to the future bride of her son.",
        "Mugganee is the first contract, by which the parties are bound to fulfil\ntheir engagement at an appointed time.",
        "The dress for a bride[10] differs in one material point from the general\nstyle of Hindoostaunie costume: a sort of gown is worn, made of silver\ntissue, or some equally expensive article, about the walking length of an\nEnglish dress; the skirt is open in front, and contains about twenty\nbreadths of the material, a tight body and long sleeves. The whole dress\nis trimmed very richly with embroidered trimming and silver riband; the\ndeputtah (drapery) is made to correspond. This style of dress is the\noriginal Hindoo fashion, and was worn at the Court of Delhi for many\ncenturies; but of late years it has been used only on marriage festivals\namongst the better sort of people in Hindoostaun, except Kings or Nuwaubs\nsending khillauts to females, when this dress, called a jhammah,[11] is\ninvariably one of the articles.",
        "The costly dresses for the present Mugganee my friend prepared at a great\nexpense, and with much good taste; to which were added a ruby ring of\ngreat value, large gold ear-rings, offerings of money, the flower-garlands\nfor the head, neck, wrists, and ankles, formed of the sweet-scented\njessamine; choice confectionery set out in trays with the pawns and fruits;\nthe whole conveyed under an escort of soldiers and servants with a band of\nmusic, from the residence of Meer Mahumud to that of his bride elect,\naccompanied by many friends of the family. These offerings from the youth\nbind the contract with the young lady, who wears his ring from that day to\nthe end of her life.",
        "The poorer sort of people perform Mugganee by the youth simply sending a\nrupee in a silk band, to be tied on the girl’s arm.",
        "Being curious to know the whole business of a wedding ceremony amongst the\nMussulmaun people, I was allowed to perform the part of ’officiating\nfriend’ on this occasion of celebrating the Mugganee. The parents of the\nyoung lady having been consulted, my visit was a source of solicitude to\nthe whole family, who made every possible preparation to receive me with\nbecoming respect; I went just in time to reach the gate at the moment the\nparade arrived. I was handed to the door of the zeenahnah by the girl’s\nfather, and was soon surrounded by the young members of the family,\ntogether with many lady-visitors, slaves, and women-servants of the\nestablishment. They had never before seen an English-woman, and the\nnovelty, I fancy, surprised the whole group; they examined my dress,\nmy complexion, hair, hands, &c., and looked the wonder they could not\nexpress in words. The young Begum was not amongst the gazing throng;\nsome preliminary customs detained her behind the purdah, where it may\nbe supposed she endured all the agony of suspense and curiosity by her\ncompliance with the prescribed forms.",
        "The lady of the mansion waited my approach to the dulhaun[12] (great hall)\nwith all due etiquette, standing to receive and embrace me on my advancing\ntowards her. This ceremony performed, I was invited to take a seat on the\nmusnud-carpet with her on the ground; a chair had been provided for me,\nbut I chose to respect the lady’s preference, and the seat on the floor\nsuited me for the time without much inconvenience.",
        "After some time had been passed in conversation on such subjects as suited\nthe taste of the lady of the house, I was surprised at the servants\nentering with trays, which they placed immediately before me, containing a\nfull-dress suit in the costume of Hindoostaun. The hostess told me she had\nprepared this dress for me, and I must condescend to wear it. I would have\ndeclined the gaudy array, but one of her friends whispered me, ’The custom\nis of long standing; when the face of a stranger is first seen a dress is\nalways presented; I should displease Sumdun Begum by my refusal;–besides,\nit would be deemed an ill omen at the Mugganee of the young Bohue[13] Begum\nif I did not put on the Native dress before I saw the face of the bride\nelect.’ These I found to be weighty arguments, and felt constrained to\nquiet their apprehensions of ill-luck by compliance; I therefore forced\nthe gold dress and the glittering drapery over my other clothes, at the\nexpense of some suffering from the heat, for it was at the very hottest\nseason of the year, and the dulhaun was crowded with visitors.",
        "This important point conceded to them, I was led to a side hall, where the\nlittle girl was seated on her carpet of rich embroidery, her face resting\non her knees in apparent bashfulness. I could not directly ascertain\nwhether she was plain, or pretty as the female agent had represented. I\nwas allowed the privilege of decorating the young lady with the sweet\njessamine guinahs,[14] and placing the ring on the forefinger of the right\nhand; after which, the ear-rings, the gold-tissue dress, the deputtah were\nall in their turn put on, the offering of money presented, and then I had\nthe first embrace before her mother. She looked very pretty, just turned\ntwelve. If I could have prevailed on her to be cheerful, I should have\nbeen much gratified to have extended my visit in her apartment, but the\npoor child seemed ready to sink with timidity; and out of compassion to\nthe dear girl, I hurried away from the hall, to relieve her from the\nburden my presence seemed to inflict, the moment I had accomplished my\nlast duty, which was to feed her with my own hand, giving her seven pieces\nof sugar-candy; seven, on this occasion, is the lucky number, I presume,\nas I was particularly cautioned to feed her with exactly that number of\npieces.",
        "Returning to the assembly in the dulhaun, I would have gladly taken leave;\nbut there was yet one other custom to be observed to secure a happy omen\nto the young people’s union. Once again seated on the musnud with Sumdun\nBegum,[15] the female slaves entered with sherbet in silver basins. Each\nperson taking sherbet is expected to deposit gold or silver coins in the\ntray; the sherbet-money at this house is collected for the bride; and when\nduring the three days’ performance of the marriage ceremony at the\nbridegroom’s house sherbet is presented to the guests, the money collected\nthere is reserved for him. The produce of the two houses is afterwards\ncompared, and conclusions drawn as to the greatest portion of respect paid\nby the friends on either side. The poor people find the sherbet-money a\nuseful fund to help them to keep house; but with the rich it is a mere\nmatter to boast of, that so much money was collected in consequence of the\nnumber of visitors who attended the nuptials.",
        "After the Mugganee ceremony had been performed, and before the marriage\nwas solemnized, the festival of Buckrah Eade occurred;–in the eleventh\nLetter you will find it remarked, the bride and bridegroom elect then\nexchange presents;–my friend was resolved her son’s presents should do\nhonour to both houses, and the following may give you an idea of an\nEade-gift.",
        "Thirty-five goats and sheep of the finest breed procurable, which I\nsucceeded in having sent in their natural dress, instead of being adorned\nwith gold-cloth and painted horns: it was, however, with some persuasion\nthe folly of this general practice was omitted in this instance.",
        "The guinah or garland, of flowers on a tray covered with brocade. The\nguinah are sweet-scented flowers without stalks, threaded into garlands in\nmany pretty ways, with great taste and ingenuity, intermixed with silver\nribands; they are formed into bracelets, necklaces, armlets, chaplets for\nthe head, and bangles for the legs. There are people in Lucknow who make\nthe preparing of guinahs a profitable business, as the population is so\nextensive as to render these flower-ornaments articles of great request.",
        "A tray filled with pawns, prepared with the usual ingredients, as lime,\ncuttie[16] (a bitter gum), betel-nut, tobacco, spices, &c.; these pawns\nare tied up in packets of a triangular form and covered with enamelled\nfoil of many bright colours. Several trays of ripe fruits of the season,\nviz., kurbootahs[17] (shaddock), kabooza[18] (melons), ununas[19] (pine\napple), guavers,[20] sherreefha[21] (custard-apple), kummeruck,[22]\njarmun[23] (purple olives), orme[24] (mango), falsah,[25] kirhnee,[26]\nbaer,[27] leechie,[28] ormpeach,[29] carounder,[30] and many other kinds\nof less repute.",
        "Confectionery and sweetmeats, on trays, in all the varieties of Indian\ninvention; a full-dress suit for the young lady; and on a silver tray the\nyouth’s nuzza of five gold mohurs, and twenty-one rupees.",
        "The Eade offering of Meer Mahumud was escorted by servants, soldiers, and\na band of music; and the young lady returned a present to the bridegroom\nelect of thirty-five goats and sheep, and a variety of undress skull-caps,\nsupposed to be her own work, in spangles and embroidery. I may state here,\nthat the Natives of India never go bare-headed in the house. The turban is\nalways worn in company, whatever may be the inconvenience from heat; and\nin private life, a small skull-cap, often of plain white muslin, just\ncovers the head. It is considered disgraceful in men to expose the head\nbare; removing the turban from the head of an individual would be deemed\nas insulting as pulling a nose in Europe.",
        "Whatever Eade or festival may occur between the Mugganee and the final\ncelebration of nuptials, presents are always interchanged by the young\nbride and bridegroom; and with all such observances there is one\nprevailing custom, which is, that though there should be nothing at hand\nbut part of their own gifts, the trays are not allowed to go back without\nsome trifling things to keep the custom in full force.",
        "[1] The Koran (iv. 3) allows Musalmans to marry ’by twos, or\n    threes, or fours’; but the passage has been interpreted in various\n    ways.",

        "[3] Duli, ’the Anglo-Indian ’dhooly’. Such wives are so called\n    because they are brought to the houses of their husbands in an\n    informal way, without a regular marriage procession.",
        "[4] The King of Vijayanagar had twelve thousand wives: four thousand\n    followed him on foot and served in the kitchen; the same number\n    marched with him on horseback; the remainder in litters, and two or\n    three thousand of them were bound to burn themselves with his corpse\n    (Nicolo Conti, India in the Fifteenth Century, part iii, p. 6). In\n    Orissa a palm-leaf record states that one monarch died prematurely\n    just as he had married his sixty-thousandth wife, and a European\n    traveller speaks of a later prince who had four thousand ladies (Sir\n    W. Hunter, Orissa. ii, 132 f.). Manucci states that there were more\n    than thirty thousand women in the palace of Shah Jahan at Dheli,\n    and that he usually had two thousand women of different races in his\n    zenana (Storia de Major, i. 195, ii. 330). Tippoo Sultan of\n    Mysore married nine hundred women (Jaffur Shurreef, Qanoon-e-Islam,\n    93).",
        "[5] There in evidence that infanticide did prevail among some Musalman\n    tribes. Where actual infanticide has disappeared, it has often been\n    replaced by neglect of female infants, except in those castes where,\n    owing to a scarcity of girls, they command a high price.–Reports\n    Census of India, 1911, i. 216 ff; Panjab, 1911, i. 231.",
        "[6] Ludhiana.",
        "[7] No record of this proclamation has been traced in the histories of the\n    time.",
        "[8] The bride is often selected by praying for a dream in sleep, by\n    manipulating the rosary, or by opening the Koran at random, and\n    reading the first verse which comes under the eye. Another method is\n    to ascertain to which of the elements–fire, air, earth, water–the\n    initials of the names of the pair correspond. If these agree, it is\n    believed that the engagement will be prosperous.–Jaffur Shurreef,\n    Qanoon-e-Islam, 37.",

        "[15] Sumdun is always the title of the bride’s mamma; Bohue, that of the\n    young wife, and, therefore, my thus designating her here is premature.\n    [Samdhan means a connexion by marriage. The mothers of bride and\n    bridegroom are samdhan to each other.]",
