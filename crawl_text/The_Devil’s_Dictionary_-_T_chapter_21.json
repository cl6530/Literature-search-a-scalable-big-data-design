        "T, the twentieth letter of the English alphabet, was by the Greeks \nabsurdly called tau.  In the alphabet whence ours comes it had the \nform of the rude corkscrew of the period, and when it stood alone \n(which was more than the Phoenicians could always do) signified \nTallegal, translated by the learned Dr. Brownrigg, “tanglefoot.”",
        "TABLE D’HOTE, n.  A caterer’s thrifty concession to the universal \npassion for irresponsibility.",
        "  Old Paunchinello, freshly wed,\n      Took Madam P. to table,\n  And there deliriously fed\n      As fast as he was able.",
        "  “I dote upon good grub,” he cried,\n      Intent upon its throatage.\n  “Ah, yes,” said the neglected bride,\n      “You’re in your table d’hotage.”",
        "Associated Poets",
        "\nTAIL, n.  The part of an animal’s spine that has transcended its \nnatural limitations to set up an independent existence in a world of \nits own.  Excepting in its foetal state, Man is without a tail, a \nprivation of which he attests an hereditary and uneasy consciousness \nby the coat-skirt of the male and the train of the female, and by a \nmarked tendency to ornament that part of his attire where the tail \nshould be, and indubitably once was.  This tendency is most observable \nin the female of the species, in whom the ancestral sense is strong \nand persistent.  The tailed men described by Lord Monboddo are now \ngenerally regarded as a product of an imagination unusually \nsusceptible to influences generated in the golden age of our pithecan \npast.",
        "TAKE, v.t.  To acquire, frequently by force but preferably by stealth.",
        "TALK, v.t.  To commit an indiscretion without temptation, from an \nimpulse without purpose.",
        "TARIFF, n.  A scale of taxes on imports, designed to protect the \ndomestic producer against the greed of his consumer.",
        "  The Enemy of Human Souls\n  Sat grieving at the cost of coals;\n  For Hell had been annexed of late,\n  And was a sovereign Southern State.",
        "  “It were no more than right,” said he,\n  “That I should get my fuel free.\n  The duty, neither just nor wise,\n  Compels me to economize —\n  Whereby my broilers, every one,\n  Are execrably underdone.\n  What would they have? — although I yearn\n  To do them nicely to a turn,\n  I can’t afford an honest heat.\n  This tariff makes even devils cheat!\n  I’m ruined, and my humble trade\n  All rascals may at will invade:\n  Beneath my nose the public press\n  Outdoes me in sulphureousness;\n  The bar ingeniously applies\n  To my undoing my own lies;\n  My medicines the doctors use\n  (Albeit vainly) to refuse\n  To me my fair and rightful prey\n  And keep their own in shape to pay;\n  The preachers by example teach\n  What, scorning to perform, I teach;\n  And statesmen, aping me, all make\n  More promises than they can break.\n  Against such competition I\n  Lift up a disregarded cry.\n  Since all ignore my just complaint,\n  By Hokey-Pokey!  I’ll turn saint!\"\n  Now, the Republicans, who all\n  Are saints, began at once to bawl\n  Against his competition; so\n  There was a devil of a go!\n  They locked horns with him, tete-a-tete\n  In acrimonious debate,\n  Till Democrats, forlorn and lone,\n  Had hopes of coming by their own.\n  That evil to avert, in haste\n  The two belligerents embraced;\n  But since ’twere wicked to relax\n  A tittle of the Sacred Tax,\n  ’Twas finally agreed to grant\n  The bold Insurgent-protestant\n  A bounty on each soul that fell\n  Into his ineffectual Hell.",
        "Edam Smith",
        "\nTECHNICALITY, n.  In an English court a man named Home was tried for \nslander in having accused his neighbor of murder.  His exact words \nwere:  “Sir Thomas Holt hath taken a cleaver and stricken his cook \nupon the head, so that one side of the head fell upon one shoulder and \nthe other side upon the other shoulder.”  The defendant was acquitted \nby instruction of the court, the learned judges holding that the words \ndid not charge murder, for they did not affirm the death of the cook, \nthat being only an inference.",
        "TEDIUM, n.  Ennui, the state or condition of one that is bored.  Many \nfanciful derivations of the word have been affirmed, but so high an \nauthority as Father Jape says that it comes from a very obvious \nsource — the first words of the ancient Latin hymn Te Deum \nLaudamus.  In this apparently natural derivation there is something \nthat saddens.",
        "TEETOTALER, n.  One who abstains from strong drink, sometimes totally, \nsometimes tolerably totally.",
        "TELEPHONE, n.  An invention of the devil which abrogates some of the \nadvantages of making a disagreeable person keep his distance.",
        "TELESCOPE, n.  A device having a relation to the eye similar to that \nof the telephone to the ear, enabling distant objects to plague us \nwith a multitude of needless details.  Luckily it is unprovided with a \nbell summoning us to the sacrifice.",
        "TENACITY, n.  A certain quality of the human hand in its relation to \nthe coin of the realm.  It attains its highest development in the hand \nof authority and is considered a serviceable equipment for a career in \npolitics.  The following illustrative lines were written of a \nCalifornian gentleman in high political preferment, who has passed to \nhis accounting:",
        "  Of such tenacity his grip\n  That nothing from his hand can slip.\n  Well-buttered eels you may o’erwhelm\n  In tubs of liquid slippery-elm\n  In vain — from his detaining pinch\n  They cannot struggle half an inch!\n  ’Tis lucky that he so is planned\n  That breath he draws not with his hand,\n  For if he did, so great his greed\n  He’d draw his last with eager speed.\n  Nay, that were well, you say.  Not so\n  He’d draw but never let it go!",
        "THEOSOPHY, n.  An ancient faith having all the certitude of religion \nand all the mystery of science.  The modern Theosophist holds, with \nthe Buddhists, that we live an incalculable number of times on this \nearth, in as many several bodies, because one life is not long enough \nfor our complete spiritual development; that is, a single lifetime \ndoes not suffice for us to become as wise and good as we choose to \nwish to become.  To be absolutely wise and good — that is perfection; \nand the Theosophist is so keen-sighted as to have observed that \neverything desirous of improvement eventually attains perfection.  \nLess competent observers are disposed to except cats, which seem \nneither wiser nor better than they were last year.  The greatest and \nfattest of recent Theosophists was the late Madame Blavatsky, who had \nno cat.",
        "TIGHTS, n.  An habiliment of the stage designed to reinforce the \ngeneral acclamation of the press agent with a particular publicity.  \nPublic attention was once somewhat diverted from this garment to Miss \nLillian Russell’s refusal to wear it, and many were the conjectures as \nto her motive, the guess of Miss Pauline Hall showing a high order of \ningenuity and sustained reflection.  It was Miss Hall’s belief that \nnature had not endowed Miss Russell with beautiful legs.  This theory \nwas impossible of acceptance by the male understanding, but the \nconception of a faulty female leg was of so prodigious originality as \nto rank among the most brilliant feats of philosophical speculation!  \nIt is strange that in all the controversy regarding Miss Russell’s \naversion to tights no one seems to have thought to ascribe it to what \nwas known among the ancients as “modesty.”  The nature of that \nsentiment is now imperfectly understood, and possibly incapable of \nexposition with the vocabulary that remains to us.  The study of lost \narts has, however, been recently revived and some of the arts \nthemselves recovered.  This is an epoch of renaissances, and there \nis ground for hope that the primitive “blush” may be dragged from its \nhiding-place amongst the tombs of antiquity and hissed on to the \nstage.",
        "TOMB, n.  The House of Indifference.  Tombs are now by common consent \ninvested with a certain sanctity, but when they have been long \ntenanted it is considered no sin to break them open and rifle them, \nthe famous Egyptologist, Dr. Huggyns, explaining that a tomb may be \ninnocently “glened” as soon as its occupant is done “smellynge,” the \nsoul being then all exhaled.  This reasonable view is now generally \naccepted by archaeologists, whereby the noble science of Curiosity has \nbeen greatly dignified.",
        "TOPE, v.  To tipple, booze, swill, soak, guzzle, lush, bib, or swig.  \nIn the individual, toping is regarded with disesteem, but toping \nnations are in the forefront of civilization and power.  When pitted \nagainst the hard-drinking Christians the absemious Mahometans go down \nlike grass before the scythe.  In India one hundred thousand beef- \neating and brandy-and-soda guzzling Britons hold in subjection two \nhundred and fifty million vegetarian abstainers of the same Aryan \nrace.  With what an easy grace the whisky-loving American pushed the \ntemperate Spaniard out of his possessions!  From the time when the \nBerserkers ravaged all the coasts of western Europe and lay drunk in \nevery conquered port it has been the same way:  everywhere the nations \nthat drink too much are observed to fight rather well and not too \nrighteously.  Wherefore the estimable old ladies who abolished the \ncanteen from the American army may justly boast of having materially \naugmented the nation’s military power.",
        "TORTOISE, n.  A creature thoughtfully created to supply occasion for \nthe following lines by the illustrious Ambat Delaso:",
        "\nTO MY PET TORTOISE",
        "\n  My friend, you are not graceful — not at all;\n  Your gait’s between a stagger and a sprawl.",
        "  Nor are you beautiful:  your head’s a snake’s\n  To look at, and I do not doubt it aches.",
        "  As to your feet, they’d make an angel weep.\n  ’Tis true you take them in whene’er you sleep.",
        "  No, you’re not pretty, but you have, I own,\n  A certain firmness — mostly you’re [sic] backbone.",
        "  Firmness and strength (you have a giant’s thews)\n  Are virtues that the great know how to use —",
        "  I wish that they did not; yet, on the whole,\n  You lack — excuse my mentioning it — Soul.",
        "  So, to be candid, unreserved and true,\n  I’d rather you were I than I were you.",
        "  Perhaps, however, in a time to be,\n  When Man’s extinct, a better world may see",
        "  Your progeny in power and control,\n  Due to the genesis and growth of Soul.",
        "  So I salute you as a reptile grand\n  Predestined to regenerate the land.",
        "  Father of Possibilities, O deign\n  To accept the homage of a dying reign!",
        "  In the far region of the unforeknown\n  I dream a tortoise upon every throne.",
        "  I see an Emperor his head withdraw\n  Into his carapace for fear of Law;",
        "  A King who carries something else than fat,\n  Howe’er acceptably he carries that;",
        "  A President not strenuously bent\n  On punishment of audible dissent —",
        "  Who never shot (it were a vain attack)\n  An armed or unarmed tortoise in the back;",
        "  Subject and citizens that feel no need\n  To make the March of Mind a wild stampede;",
        "  All progress slow, contemplative, sedate,\n  And “Take your time” the word, in Church and State.",
        "  O Tortoise, ’tis a happy, happy dream,\n  My glorious testudinous regime!",
        "  I wish in Eden you’d brought this about\n  By slouching in and chasing Adam out.",
        "TREE, n.  A tall vegetable intended by nature to serve as a penal \napparatus, though through a miscarriage of justice most trees bear \nonly a negligible fruit, or none at all.  When naturally fruited, the \ntree is a beneficient agency of civilization and an important factor \nin public morals.  In the stern West and the sensitive South its fruit \n(white and black respectively) though not eaten, is agreeable to the \npublic taste and, though not exported, profitable to the general \nwelfare.  That the legitimate relation of the tree to justice was no \ndiscovery of Judge Lynch (who, indeed, conceded it no primacy over the \nlamp-post and the bridge-girder) is made plain by the following \npassage from Morryster, who antedated him by two centuries:",
        "      While in yt londe I was carried to see ye Ghogo tree, whereof \n  I had hearde moch talk; but sayynge yt I saw naught remarkabyll in \n  it, ye hed manne of ye villayge where it grewe made answer as \n  followeth:\n      “Ye tree is not nowe in fruite, but in his seasonne you shall \n  see dependynge fr. his braunches all soch as have affroynted ye \n  King his Majesty.\"\n      And I was furder tolde yt ye worde “Ghogo” sygnifyeth in yr \n  tong ye same as “rapscal” in our owne.",
        "Trauvells in ye Easte",
        "\nTRIAL, n.  A formal inquiry designed to prove and put upon record the \nblameless characters of judges, advocates and jurors.  In order to \neffect this purpose it is necessary to supply a contrast in the person \nof one who is called the defendant, the prisoner, or the accused.  If \nthe contrast is made sufficiently clear this person is made to undergo \nsuch an affliction as will give the virtuous gentlemen a comfortable \nsense of their immunity, added to that of their worth.  In our day the \naccused is usually a human being, or a socialist, but in mediaeval \ntimes, animals, fishes, reptiles and insects were brought to trial.  A \nbeast that had taken human life, or practiced sorcery, was duly \narrested, tried and, if condemned, put to death by the public \nexecutioner.  Insects ravaging grain fields, orchards or vineyards \nwere cited to appeal by counsel before a civil tribunal, and after \ntestimony, argument and condemnation, if they continued in \ncontumaciam the matter was taken to a high ecclesiastical court, \nwhere they were solemnly excommunicated and anathematized.  In a \nstreet of Toledo, some pigs that had wickedly run between the \nviceroy’s legs, upsetting him, were arrested on a warrant, tried and \npunished.  In Naples and ass was condemned to be burned at the stake, \nbut the sentence appears not to have been executed.  D’Addosio relates \nfrom the court records many trials of pigs, bulls, horses, cocks, \ndogs, goats, etc., greatly, it is believed, to the betterment of their \nconduct and morals.  In 1451 a suit was brought against the leeches \ninfesting some ponds about Berne, and the Bishop of Lausanne, \ninstructed by the faculty of Heidelberg University, directed that some \nof “the aquatic worms” be brought before the local magistracy.  This \nwas done and the leeches, both present and absent, were ordered to \nleave the places that they had infested within three days on pain of \nincurring “the malediction of God.”  In the voluminous records of this \ncause celebre nothing is found to show whether the offenders braved \nthe punishment, or departed forthwith out of that inhospitable \njurisdiction.",
        "TRICHINOSIS, n.  The pig’s reply to proponents of porcophagy.\n  Moses Mendlessohn having fallen ill sent for a Christian \nphysician, who at once diagnosed the philosopher’s disorder as \ntrichinosis, but tactfully gave it another name.  “You need and \nimmediate change of diet,” he said; “you must eat six ounces of pork \nevery other day.\"\n  “Pork?” shrieked the patient — “pork?  Nothing shall induce me to \ntouch it!\"\n  “Do you mean that?” the doctor gravely asked.\n  “I swear it!\"\n  “Good! — then I will undertake to cure you.”",
        "TRINITY, n.  In the multiplex theism of certain Christian churches, \nthree entirely distinct deities consistent with only one.  Subordinate \ndeities of the polytheistic faith, such as devils and angels, are not \ndowered with the power of combination, and must urge individually \ntheir clames to adoration and propitiation.  The Trinity is one of the \nmost sublime mysteries of our holy religion.  In rejecting it because \nit is incomprehensible, Unitarians betray their inadequate sense of \ntheological fundamentals.  In religion we believe only what we do not \nunderstand, except in the instance of an intelligible doctrine that \ncontradicts an incomprehensible one.  In that case we believe the \nformer as a part of the latter.",
        "TROGLODYTE, n.  Specifically, a cave-dweller of the paleolithic \nperiod, after the Tree and before the Flat.  A famous community of \ntroglodytes dwelt with David in the Cave of Adullam.  The colony \nconsisted of “every one that was in distress, and every one that was \nin debt, and every one that was discontented” — in brief, all the \nSocialists of Judah.",
        "TRUCE, n.  Friendship.",
        "TRUTH, n.  An ingenious compound of desirability and appearance.  \nDiscovery of truth is the sole purpose of philosophy, which is the \nmost ancient occupation of the human mind and has a fair prospect of \nexisting with increasing activity to the end of time.",
        "TRUTHFUL, adj.  Dumb and illiterate.",
        "TRUST, n.  In American politics, a large corporation composed in \ngreater part of thrifty working men, widows of small means, orphans in \nthe care of guardians and the courts, with many similar malefactors \nand public enemies.",
        "TURKEY, n.  A large bird whose flesh when eaten on certain religious \nanniversaries has the peculiar property of attesting piety and \ngratitude.  Incidentally, it is pretty good eating.",
        "TWICE, adv.  Once too often.",
        "TYPE, n.  Pestilent bits of metal suspected of destroying \ncivilization and enlightenment, despite their obvious agency in this \nincomparable dictionary.",
        "TZETZE (or TSETSE) FLY, n.  An African insect (Glossina morsitans) \nwhose bite is commonly regarded as nature’s most efficacious remedy \nfor insomnia, though some patients prefer that of the American \nnovelist (Mendax interminabilis).",
