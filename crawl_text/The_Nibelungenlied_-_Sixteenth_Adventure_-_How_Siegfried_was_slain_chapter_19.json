        "Gunther and Hagen, / the knights full keen,\nProposed with evil forethought / a hunting in the green:\nThe boar within the forest / they’d chase with pointed spear,\nAnd shaggy bear and bison. / –What sport to valiant men more dear?",
        "917",
        "With them rode also Siegfried / happy and light of heart:\nTheir load of rich refreshments / was made in goodly part.\nWhere a spring ran cooling / they took from him his life,\nWhereto in chief had urged them / Brunhild, royal Gunther’s wife.",
        "918",
        "Then went the valiant Siegfried / where he Kriemhild found;\nRich hunting-dress was laden / and now stood ready bound\nFor him and his companions / across the Rhine to go.\nThan this a sadder hour / nevermore could Kriemhild know.",
        "919",
        "The spouse he loved so dearly / upon the mouth he kissed.\n“God grant that well I find thee / again, if so He list,\nAnd thine own eyes to see me. / ’Mid kin that hold thee dear\nMay now the time go gently, / the while I am no longer near.”",
        "920",
        "Then thought she of the story / –but silence must she keep–\nWhereof once Hagen asked her: / then began to weep\nThe princess high and noble / that ever she was born,\nAnd wept with tears unceasing / the valiant Siegfried’s wife forlorn.",
        "921",
        "She spake unto her husband: / “Let now this hunting be.\nI dreamt this night of evil, / how wild boars hunted thee,\nTwo wild boars o’er the meadow, / wherefrom the flowers grew red.\nThat I do weep so sorely / have I poor woman direst need.",
        "922",
        "“Yea, do I fear, Sir Siegfried, / something treacherous,\nIf perchance have any / of those been wronged by us\nWho might yet be able / to vent their enmity.\nTarry thou here, Sir Siegfried: / let that my faithful counsel be.”",
        "923",
        "Quoth he: “I come, dear lady, / when some short days are flown.\nOf foes who bear us hatred / here know I never one.\nAll of thine own kindred / are gracious unto me,\nNor know I aught of reason / why they should other-minded be.”",
        "924",
        "“But nay, beloved Siegfried, / thy death I fear ’twill prove.\nThis night I dreamt misfortune, / how o’er thee from above\nDown there fell two mountains: / I never saw thee more.\nAnd wilt thou now go from me, / that must grieve my heart full sore.”",
        "925",
        "The lady rich in virtue / within his arms he pressed,\nAnd with loving kisses / her fair form caressed.\nFrom her thence he parted / ere long time was o’er:\nAlas for her, she saw him / alive thereafter nevermore.",
        "926",
        "Then rode from thence the hunters / deep within a wold\nIn search of pleasant pastime. / Full many a rider bold\nFollowed after Gunther / in his stately train.\nGernot and Giselher, / –at home the knights did both remain.",
        "927",
        "Went many a horse well laden / before them o’er the Rhine,\nThat for the huntsmen carried / store of bread and wine,\nMeat along with fishes / and other victualling,\nThe which upon his table / were fitting for so high a king.",
        "928",
        "Then bade they make encampment / before the forest green\nWhere game was like to issue, / those hunters proud and keen,\nWho there would join in hunting, / on a meadow wide that spread.\nThither also was come Siegfried: / the same unto the king was said.",
        "929",
        "By the merry huntsmen / soon were watched complete\nAt every point the runways. / The company then did greet\nSiegfried the keen and doughty: / “Who now within the green\nUnto the game shall guide us, / ye warriors so bold and keen?”",
        "930",
        "“Now part we from each other,\" / answered Hagen then,\n“Ere that the hunting / we do here begin!\nThereby may be apparent / to my masters and to me\nWho on this forest journey / of the hunters best may be.",
        "931",
        "“Let then hounds and huntsmen / be ta’en in equal share,\nThat wheresoever any / would go, there let him fare.\nWho then is first in hunting / shall have our thanks this day.\"\nNot longer there together / did the merry hunters stay.",
        "932",
        "Thereto quoth Sir Siegfried: / “Of dogs have I no need,\nMore than one hound only / of trusty hunting breed\nFor scenting well the runway / of wild beast through the brake.\nAnd now the chase begin we!\" / –so the spouse of Kriemhild spake.",
        "933",
        "Then took a practised hunter / a good tracking-hound,\nThat did bring them where they / game in plenty found,\nNor kept them long awaiting. / Whate’er did spring from lair\nPursued the merry huntsmen, / as still good hunters everywhere.",
        "934",
        "As many as the hound started / slew with mighty hand\nSiegfried the full doughty / hero of Netherland.\nSo swiftly went his charger / that none could him outrun;\nAnd praise before all others / soon he in the hunting won.",
        "935",
        "He was in every feature / a valiant knight and true.\nThe first within the forest / that with his hand he slew\nWas a half-grown wild-boar / that he smote to ground;\nThereafter he full quickly / a wild and mighty lion found.",
        "936",
        "When it the hound had started, / with bow he shot it dead,\nWherewith a pointed arrow / he had so swiftly sped\nThat the lion after / could forward spring but thrice.\nAll they that hunted with him / cried Siegfried’s praise with merry\n      voice.",
        "937",
        "Soon fell a prey unto him / an elk and bison more,\nA giant stag he slew him / and huge ure-oxen four.\nHis steed bore him so swiftly / that none could him outrun;\nOf stag or hind encountered / scarce could there escape him one.",
        "938",
        "A boar full huge and bristling / soon was likewise found,\nAnd when the same bethought him / to flee before the hound,\nCame quick again the master / and stood athwart his path.\nThe boar upon the hero / full charged straightway in mickle wrath.",
        "939",
        "Then the spouse of Kriemhild, / with sword the boar he slew,\nA thing that scarce another / hunter had dared to do.\nWhen he thus had felled him / they lashed again the hound,\nAnd soon his hunting prowess / was known to all the people round.",
        "940",
        "Then spake to him his huntsmen: / “If that the thing may be,\nSo let some part, Sir Siegfried, / of the forest game go free;\nTo-day thou makest empty / hillside and forest wild.\"\nThereat in merry humor / the thane so keen and valiant smiled.",
        "941",
        "Then they heard on all sides / the din, from many a hound\nAnd huntsmen eke the clamor / so great was heard around\nThat back did come the answer / from hill and forest tree–\nOf hounds had four-and-twenty / packs been set by hunter free.",
        "942",
        "Full many a forest denizen / from life was doomed to part.\nEach of all the hunters / thereon had set his heart,\nTo win the prize in hunting. / But such could never be,\nWhen they the doughty Siegfried / at the camping-place did see.",
        "943",
        "Now the chase was ended, / –and yet complete ’twas not.\nAll they to camp who wended / with them thither brought\nSkin of full many an animal / and of game good store.\nHeigho! unto the table / how much the king’s attendants bore!",
        "944",
        "Then bade the king the noble / hunters all to warn\nThat he would take refreshment, / and loud a hunting-horn\nIn one long blast was winded: / to all was known thereby\nThat the noble monarch / at camp did wait their company.",
        "945",
        "Spake one of Siegfried’s huntsmen: / “Master, I do know\nBy blast of horn resounding / that we now shall go\nUnto the place of meeting; / thereto I’ll make reply.\"\nThen for the merry hunters / blew the horn right lustily.",
        "946",
        "Then spake Sir Siegfried: / “Now leave we eke the green.\"\nHis charger bore him smoothly, / and followed huntsmen keen.\nWith their rout they started / a beast of savage kind,\nThat was a bear untamed. / Then spake the knight to those behind",
        "947",
        "“For our merry party / some sport will I devise.\nLet slip the hound then straightway, / a bear now meets my eyes,\nAnd with us shall he thither / unto the camp-fire fare.\nFull rapid must his flight be / shall he our company forbear.”",
        "948",
        "From leash the hound was loosened, / the bear sprang through the brake,\nWhen that the spouse of Kriemhild / did wish him to o’ertake.\nHe sought a pathless thicket, / but yet it could not be,\nAs bruin fondly hoped it, / that from the hunter he was free.",
        "949",
        "Then from his horse alighted / the knight of spirit high,\nAnd gan a running after. / Bruin all unguardedly\nWas ta’en, and could escape not. / Him caught straightway the knight,\nAnd soon all unwounded / had him bound in fetters tight.",
        "950",
        "Nor claws nor teeth availed him / for aught of injury,\nBut bound he was to saddle. / Then mounted speedily\nThe knight, and to the camp-fire / in right merry way\nFor pastime led he bruin, / the hero valiant and gay.",
        "951",
        "In what manner stately / unto the camp he rode!\nHe bore a spear full mickle, / great of strength and broad.\nA sword all ornamented / hung down unto his spur,\nAnd wrought of gold all ruddy / at side a glittering horn he wore.",
        "952",
        "Of richer hunting-garments / heard I ne’er tell before.\nBlack was the silken tunic / that the rider wore,\nAnd cap of costly sable / did crown the gallant knight.\nHeigho, and how his quiver / with well-wrought hands was rich bedight!",
        "953",
        "A skin of gleaming panther / covered the quiver o’er,\nPrized for its pleasant odor. / Eke a bow he bore,\nThe which to draw if ever / had wished another man,\nA lever he had needed: / such power had Siegfried alone.",
        "954",
        "Of fur of costly otter / his mantle was complete,\nWith other skins embroidered / from head unto the feet.\nAnd ’mid the fur all shining, / full many a golden seam\nOn both sides of the valiant / huntsman saw ye brightly gleam.",
        "955",
        "Balmung, a goodly weapon / broad, he also wore,\nThat was so sharp at edges / that it ne’er forbore\nTo cleave when swung on helmet: / blade it was full good.\nStately was the huntsman / as there with merry heart he rode.",
        "956",
        "If that complete the story / to you I shall unfold,\nFull many a goodly arrow / did his rich quiver hold\nWhereof were gold the sockets, / and heads a hand-breadth each.\nIn sooth was doomed to perish / whate’er in flight the same did reach.",
        "957",
        "Pricking like goodly huntsman / the noble knight did ride\nWhen him the men of Gunther / coming thither spied.\nThey hasted out to meet him / and took from him his steed,\nAs bruin great and mighty / by the saddle he did lead.",
        "958",
        "When he from horse alighted / he loosed him every band\nFrom foot and eke from muzzle. / Straight on every hand\nBegan the dogs a howling / when they beheld the bear.\nBruin would to the forest: / among the men was mickle stir.",
        "959",
        "Amid the clamor bruin / through the camp-fires sped:\nHeigho, how the servants / away before him fled!\nO’erturned was many a kettle / and flaming brands did fly:\nHeigho, what goodly victuals / did scattered in the ashes lie!",
        "960",
        "Then sprang from out the saddle / knights and serving-men.\nThe bear was wild careering: / the king bade loosen then\nAll the dogs that fastened / within their leashes lay.\nIf this thing well had ended, / then had there passed a merry day.",
        "961",
        "Not longer then they waited / but with bow and eke with spear\nHasted the nimble hunters / to pursue the bear,\nYet none might shoot upon him / for all the dogs around.\nSuch clamor was of voices / that all the mountain did resound.",
        "962",
        "When by the dogs pursued / the bear away did run,\nNone there that could o’ertake him / but Siegfried alone.\nWith his sword he came upon him / and killed him at a blow,\nAnd back unto the camp-fire / bearing bruin they did go.",
        "963",
        "Then spake who there had seen it, / he was a man of might.\nSoon to the table bade they / come each noble knight,\nAnd on a smiling meadow / the noble company sat.\nHeigho, with what rare victuals / did they upon the huntsmen wait!",
        "964",
        "Ne’er appeared a butler / wine for them to pour.\nThan they good knights were never / better served before,\nAnd had there not in secret / been lurking treachery,\nThen were the entertainers / from every cause of cavil free.",
        "965",
        "Then spake Sir Siegfried: / “A wonder ’tis to me,\nSince that from the kitchen / so full supplied are we,\nWhy to us the butlers / of wine bring not like store:\nIf such the huntsman’s service / a huntsman reckon me no more.",
        "966",
        "“Meseems I yet did merit / some share of courtesy.\"\nThe king who sat at table / spake then in treachery:\n“Gladly shall be amended / wherein we’re guilty so.\nThe fault it is of Hagen, / he’d willing see us thirsting go.”",
        "967",
        "Then spake of Tronje Hagen: / “Good master, hear me say,\nI weened for this our hunting / we did go to-day\nUnto the Spessart forest: / the wine I thither sent.\nGo we to-day a-thirsting, / I’ll later be more provident.”",
        "968",
        "Thereto replied Sir Siegfried: / “Small merit here is thine.\nGood seven horses laden / with mead and sparkling wine\nShould hither have been conducted. / If aught the same denied,\nThen should our place of meeting / have nearer been the Rhine beside.”",
        "969",
        "Then spake of Tronje Hagen: / “Ye noble knights and bold,\nI know here nigh unto us / a spring that’s flowing cold.\nBe then your wrath appeased, / and let us thither go.\"\nThrough that same wicked counsel / came many a thane to grievous woe.",
        "970",
        "Sore was the noble Siegfried / with the pangs of thirst:\nTo bid them rise from table / was he thus the first.\nHe would along the hillside / unto the fountain go:\nIn sooth they showed them traitors, / those knights who there did\n      counsel so.",
        "971",
        "On wagons hence to carry / the game they gave command\nWhich had that day been slaughtered / by Siegfried’s doughty hand.\nHe’d carried off the honors, / all who had seen did say.\nHagen his faith with Siegfried / soon did break in grievous way.",
        "972",
        "When now they would go thither / to where the linden spread,\nSpake of Tronje Hagen: / “To me hath oft been said,\nThat none could follow after / Kriemhild’s nimble knight\nOr vie with him in running: / would that he’d prove it to our sight!”",
        "973",
        "Then spake of Netherland / bold Siegfried speedily:\n“That may ye well have proof of, / will ye but run with me\nIn contest to the fountain. / When that the same be done,\nTo him be given honor / who the race hath fairly won.”",
        "974",
        "“Now surely make we trial,\" / quoth Hagen the thane.\nThereto the doughty Siegfried: / “I too will give you gain,\nAfore your feet at starting / to lay me in the grass.\"\nWhen that he had heard it, / thereat how joyous Gunther was!",
        "975",
        "And spake again the warrior: / “And ye shall further hear:\nAll my clothing likewise / will I upon me wear,\nThe spear and shield full heavy / and hunting-dress I’ll don.\"\nHis sword as well as quiver / had he full quickly girded on.",
        "976",
        "Doffed they their apparel / and aside they laid it then:\nClothed in white shirts only / saw you there the twain.\nLike unto two wild panthers / they coursed across the green:\nYet first beside the fountain / was the valiant Siegfried seen.",
        "977",
        "No man in feats of valor / who with him had vied.\nThe sword he soon ungirded / and quiver laid aside,\nThe mighty spear he leaned / against the linden-tree:\nBeside the running fountain / stood the knight stately to see.",
        "978",
        "To Siegfried naught was lacking / that doth good knight adorn.\nDown the shield then laid he / where did flow the burn,\nYet howsoe’er he thirsted / no whit the hero drank\nBefore had drunk the monarch: / therefor he earned but evil thank.",
        "979",
        "There where ran clear the water / and cool from out the spring,\nDown to it did bend him / Gunther the king.\nAnd when his thirst was quenched / rose he from thence again:\nEke the valiant Siegfried, / how glad had he done likewise then.",
        "980",
        "For his courtesy he suffered. / Where bow and sword there lay,\nBoth did carry Hagen / from him thence away,\nAnd again sprang quickly thither / where the spear did stand:\nAnd for a cross the tunic / of the valiant knight he scanned.",
        "981",
        "As there the noble Siegfried / to drink o’er fountain bent,\nThrough the cross he pierced him, / that from the wound was sent\nThe blood nigh to bespatter / the tunic Hagen wore.\nBy hand of knight such evil / deed shall wrought be nevermore.",
        "982",
        "The spear he left projecting / where it had pierced the heart.\nIn terror as that moment / did Hagen never start\nIn flight from any warrior / he ever yet had found.\nSoon as the noble Siegfried / within him felt the mighty wound,",
        "983",
        "Raging the knight full doughty / up from the fountain sprang,\nThe while from ’twixt his shoulders / stood out a spearshaft long.\nThe prince weened to find there / his bow or his sword:\nThen in sooth had Hagen / found the traitor’s meet reward.",
        "984",
        "When from the sorely wounded / knight his sword was gone,\nThen had he naught to ’venge him / but his shield alone.\nThis snatched he from the fountain / and Hagen rushed upon,\nAnd not at all escape him / could the royal Gunther’s man.",
        "985",
        "Though he nigh to death was wounded / he yet such might did wield\nThat out in all directions / flew from off the shield\nPrecious stones a many: / the shield he clave in twain.\nThus vengeance fain had taken / upon his foe the stately thane.",
        "986",
        "Beneath his hand must Hagen / stagger and fall to ground.\nSo swift the blow he dealt him, / the meadow did resound.\nHad sword in hand been swinging, / Hagen had had his meed,\nSo sorely raged he stricken: / to rage in sooth was mickle need.",
        "987",
        "Faded from cheek was color, / no longer could he stand,\nAnd all his might of body / soon complete had waned,\nAs did a deathly pallor / over his visage creep.\nFull many a fairest lady / for the knight anon must weep.",
        "988",
        "So sank amid the flowers / Kriemhild’s noble knight,\nWhile from his wound flowed thickly / the blood before the sight.\nThen gan he reviling / –for dire was his need–\nWho had thus encompassed / his death by this same faithless deed.",
        "989",
        "Then spake the sorely wounded: / “O ye base cowards twain,\nDoth then my service merit / that me ye thus have slain?\nTo you I e’er was faithful / and so am I repaid.\nAlas, upon your kindred / now have ye shame eternal laid.",
        "990",
        "“By this deed dishonored / hereafter evermore\nAre their generations. / Your anger all too sore\nHave ye now thus vented / and vengeance ta’en on me.\nWith shame henceforth be parted / from all good knights’ company.”",
        "991",
        "All the hunters hastened / where he stricken lay,\nIt was in sooth for many / of them a joyless day.\nHad any aught of honor, / he mourned that day, I ween,\nAnd well the same did merit / the knight high-spirited and keen.",
        "992",
        "As there the king of Burgundy / mourned that he should die,\nSpake the knight sore wounded: / “To weep o’er injury,\nWho hath wrought the evil / hath smallest need, I trow.\nReviling doth he merit, / and weeping may he well forego.”",
        "993",
        "Thereto quoth grim Hagen: / “Ye mourn, I know not why:\nThis same day hath ended / all our anxiety.\nFew shall we find henceforward / for fear will give us need,\nAnd well is me that from his / mastery we thus are freed.”",
        "994",
        "“Light thing is now thy vaunting,\" / did Siegfried then reply.\n“Had I e’er bethought me / of this thy infamy\nWell had I preserved / ’gainst all thy hate my life.\nMe rueth naught so sorely / as Lady Kriemhild my wife.",
        "995",
        "“Now may God have mercy / that to me a son was born,\nThat him alack!, the people / in times to come shall spurn,\nThat those he nameth kinsmen / have done the murderer’s deed.\nAn had I breath,” spake Siegfried, / “to mourn o’er this I well had\n      need.”",
        "996",
        "Then spake, in anguish praying, / the hero doomed to die:\n“An wilt thou, king, to any / yet not good faith deny,\nIn all the world to any, / to thee commended be\nAnd to thy loving mercy / the spouse erstwhile was wed to me.",
        "997",
        "“Let it be her good fortune / that she thy sister is:\nBy all the princely virtues, / I beg thee pledge me this.\nFor me long time my father / and men henceforth must wait:\nUpon a spouse was never / wrought, as mine, a wrong so great.”",
        "998",
        "All around the flowers / were wetted with the blood\nAs there with death he struggled. / Yet not for long he could,\nBecause the deadly weapon / had cut him all too sore:\nAnd soon the keen and noble / knight was doomed to speak no more.",
        "999",
        "When the lords perceived / how that the knight was dead,\nUpon a shield they laid him / that was of gold full red,\nAnd counsel took together / how of the thing should naught\nBe known, but held in secret / that Hagen the deed had wrought.",
        "1000",
        "Then spake of them a many: / “This is an evil day.\nNow shall ye all conceal it / and all alike shall say,\nWhen as Kriemhild’s husband / the dark forest through\nRode alone a-hunting, / him the hand of robber slew.”",
        "1001",
        "Then spake of Tronje Hagen: / “Myself will bring him home.\nIn sooth I reck but little / if to her ears it come,\nWho my Lady Brunhild / herself hath grieved so sore.\nIt maketh me small worry, / an if she weep for evermore.”",
