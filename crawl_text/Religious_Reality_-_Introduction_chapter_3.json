        "Vital religion begins for a man when lie first discovers the reality\nof the living GOD. Most men indeed profess a belief in GOD, a vague\nacknowledgment of the existence of “One above”: but the belief counts\nfor little in their lives.",
        "GOD, if He exists at all, must obviously be important: and it is\nconceivable that He prefers the dogmatic atheism of a man here and a\nman there, or the serious agnosticism of a slightly larger number, to\nthe practical indifference of the majority. “There are two attitudes,\nand only two, which are worthy of a serious man: to serve GOD with his\nwhole heart, because he knows Him; or to seek GOD with his whole\nheart, because he knows Him not.”",
        "The ordinary Englishman is in most cases nominally a Christian. As a\nrule he has been admitted in infancy by baptism into the Christian\nChurch. But he is ignorant of the implications of his baptism, and\nindifferent to the claims of a religion which he fails to understand.\nThese pages are written with the object of explaining what, in the\nwriter’s judgment, the faith and practice of the Christian Church\nreally is.",
