        "An hour later the priest toiled back in the hot twilight up the path\nfrom the village, followed by half-a-dozen silent men, twenty yards\nbehind, whose curiosity exceeded their credulousness. He had left a few\nmore standing bewildered at the doors of the little mud-houses; and had\nseen perhaps a hundred families, weighted with domestic articles, pour\nlike a stream down the rocky path that led to Khaifa. He had been cursed\nby some, even threatened; stared upon by others; mocked by a few. The\nfanatical said that the Christians had brought God’s wrath upon the\nplace, and the darkness upon the sky: the sun was dying, for these\nhounds were too evil for him to look upon and live. Others again seemed\nto see nothing remarkable in the state of the weather....",
        "There was no change in that sky from its state an hour before, except\nthat perhaps it had lightened a little as the sun climbed higher behind\nthat impenetrable dusky shroud. Hills, grass, men’s faces–all bore to\nthe priest’s eyes the look of unreality; they were as things seen in a\ndream by eyes that roll with sleep through lids weighted with lead. Even\nto other physical senses that unreality was present; and once more he\nremembered his dream, thankful that that horror at least was absent. But\nsilence seemed other than a negation of sound, it was a thing in itself,\nan affirmation, unruffled by the sound of footsteps, the thin barking of\ndogs, the murmur of voices. It appeared as if the stillness of eternity\nhad descended and embraced the world’s activities, and as if that world,\nin a desperate attempt to assert its own reality, was braced in a set,\nmotionless, noiseless, breathless effort to hold itself in being. What\nSilvester had said just now was beginning to be true of this man also.\nThe touch of the powdery soil and the warm pebbles beneath the priest’s\nbare feet seemed something apart from the consciousness that usually\nregards the things of sense as more real and more intimate than the\nthings of spirit. Matter still had a reality, still occupied space, but\nit was of a subjective nature, the result of internal rather than\nexternal powers. He appeared to himself already to be scarcely more than\na soul, intent and steady, united by a thread only to the body and the\nworld with which he was yet in relations. He knew that the appalling\nheat was there; once even, before his eyes a patch of beaten ground\ncracked and lisped as water that touches hot iron, as he trod upon it.\nHe could feel the heat upon his forehead and hands, his whole body was\nswathed and soaked in it; yet he regarded it as from an outside\nstandpoint, as a man with neuritis perceives that the pain is no longer\nin his hand but in the pillow which supports it. So, too, with what his\neyes looked upon and his ears heard; so, too, with that faint bitter\ntaste that lay upon his lips and nostrils. There was no longer in him\nfear or even hope–he regarded himself, the world, and even the\nenshrouding and awful Presence of spirit as facts with which he had but\nlittle to do. He was scarcely even interested; still less was he\ndistressed. There was Thabor before him–at least what once had been\nThabor, now it was no more than a huge and dusky dome-shape which\nimpressed itself upon his retina and informed his passive brain of its\nexistence and outline, though that existence seemed no better than that\nof a dissolving phantom.",
        "It seemed then almost natural–or at least as natural as all else–as he\ncame in through the passage and opened the chapel-door, to see that the\nfloor was crowded with prostrate motionless figures. There they lay, all\nalike in the white burnous which he had given out last night; and, with\nforehead on arms, as during the singing of the Litany of the Saints at\nan ordination, lay the figure he knew best and loved more than all the\nworld, the shoulders and white hair at a slight elevation upon the\nsingle altar step. Above the plain altar itself burned the six tall\ncandles; and in the midst, on the mean little throne, stood the\nwhite-metal monstrance, with its White Centre....",
        "Then he, too, dropped, and lay as he was....",
        "He did not know how long it was before the circling observant\nconsciousness, the flow of slow images, the vibration of particular\nthoughts, ceased and stilled as a pool rocks quietly to peace after the\ndropped stone has long lain still. But it came at last–that superb\ntranquillity, possible only when the senses are physically awake, with\nwhich God, perhaps once in a lifetime, rewards the aspiring trustful\nsoul–that point of complete rest in the heart of the Fount of all\nexistence with which one day He will reward eternally the spirits of His\nchildren. There was no thought in him of articulating this experience,\nof analysing its elements, or fingering this or that strain of ecstatic\njoy. The time for self-regarding was passed. It was enough that the\nexperience was there, although he was not even self-reflective enough to\ntell himself so. He had passed from that circle whence the soul looks\nwithin, from that circle, too, whence it looks upon objective glory, to\nthat very centre where it reposes–and the first sign to him that time\nhad passed was the murmur of words, heard distinctly and understood,\nalthough with that apartness with which a drowsy man perceives a message\nfrom without–heard as through a veil through which nothing but thinnest\nessence could transpire.",
        "Spiritus Domini replevit orbem terrarum.... The Spirit of the Lord hath\nfulfilled all things, alleluia: and that which contains all things hath\nknowledge of the voice, alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.\nExsurgat Deus (and the voice rose ever so slightly). ’Let God arise\nand let His enemies be scattered; and let them who hate Him flee before\nHis face.“",
        "Gloria Patri....\nThen he raised his heavy head; and a phantom figure stood there in red\nvestments, seeming to float rather than to stand, with thin hands\noutstretched, and white cap on white hair seen in the gleam of the\nsteady candle-flames; another, also in white, kneeled on the step....",
        "Kyrie eleison ... Gloria in excelsis Deo ... those things passed like\na shadow-show, with movements and rustlings, but he perceived rather the\nlight which cast them. He heard Deus qui in hodierna die ... but his\npassive mind gave no pulse of reflex action, no stir of understanding\nuntil these words. Cum complerentur dies Pentecostes....\n“When the day of Pentecost was fully come, all the disciples were with\none accord in the same place; and there came from heaven suddenly a\nsound, as of a mighty wind approaching, and it filled the house where\nthey were sitting.... “",
        "Then he remembered and understood.... It was Pentecost then! And with\nmemory a shred of reflection came back. Where then was the wind, and the\nflame, and the earthquake, and the secret voice? Yet the world was\nsilent, rigid in its last effort at self-assertion: there was no tremor\nto show that God remembered; no actual point of light, yet, breaking the\nappalling vault of gloom that lay over sea and land to reveal that He\nburned there in eternity, transcendent and dominant; not even a voice;\nand at that he understood yet more. He perceived that that world, whose\nmonstrous parody his sleep had presented to him in the night, was other\nthan that he had feared it to be; it was sweet, not terrible; friendly,\nnot hostile; clear, not stifling; and home, not exile. There were\npresences here, but not those gluttonous, lustful things that had looked\non him last night.... He dropped his head again upon his hands, at once\nashamed and content; and again he sank down to depths of glimmering\ninner peace....",
        "Not again, for a while, did he perceive what he did or thought, or what\npassed there, five yards away on the low step. Once only a ripple passed\nacross that sea of glass, a ripple of fire and sound like a rising star\nthat flicks a line of light across a sleeping lake, like a thin thread\nof vibration streaming from a quivering string across the stillness of a\ndeep night–and be perceived for an instant as in a formless mirror that\na lower nature was struck into existence and into union with the Divine\nnature at the same moment.... And then no more again but the great\nencompassing hush, the sense of the innermost heart of reality, till he\nfound himself kneeling at the rail, and knew that That which alone truly\nexisted on earth approached him with the swiftness of thought and the\nardour of Divine Love....",
        "Then, as the mass ended, and he raised his passive happy soul to receive\nthe last gift of God, there was a cry, a sudden clamour in the passage,\nand a man stood in the doorway, gabbling Arabic.",
