        "\nThe long and the short of it is, gentlemen, that it is better to do nothing!\nBetter conscious inertia!  And so hurrah for underground!  Though I have\nsaid that I envy the normal man to the last drop of my bile, yet I should\nnot care to be in his place such as he is now (though I shall not cease\nenvying him).  No, no; anyway the underground life is more advantageous.\nThere, at any rate, one can ...  Oh, but even now I am lying!  I\nam lying because I know myself that it is not underground that is better,\nbut something different, quite different, for which I am thirsting, but\nwhich I cannot find!  Damn underground!",
        "I will tell you another thing that would be better, and that is, if I\nmyself believed in anything of what I have just written.  I swear to you,\ngentlemen, there is not one thing, not one word of what I have written that I\nreally believe.  That is, I believe it, perhaps, but at the same time I feel\nand suspect that I am lying like a cobbler.",
        "“Then why have you written all this?” you will say to me.  “I ought to\nput you underground for forty years without anything to do and then\ncome to you in your cellar, to find out what stage you have reached!  How\ncan a man be left with nothing to do for forty years?”",
        "“Isn’t that shameful, isn’t that humiliating?” you will say, perhaps,\nwagging your heads contemptuously.  “You thirst for life and try to settle\nthe problems of life by a logical tangle.  And how persistent, how insolent\nare your sallies, and at the same time what a scare you are in!  You talk\nnonsense and are pleased with it; you say impudent things and are in\ncontinual alarm and apologising for them.  You declare that you are\nafraid of nothing and at the same time try to ingratiate yourself in our\ngood opinion.  You declare that you are gnashing your teeth and at the\nsame time you try to be witty so as to amuse us.  You know that your\nwitticisms are not witty, but you are evidently well satisfied with their\nliterary value.  You may, perhaps, have really suffered, but you have no\nrespect for your own suffering.  You may have sincerity, but you have no\nmodesty; out of the pettiest vanity you expose your sincerity to publicity\nand ignominy.  You doubtlessly mean to say something, but hide your last\nword through fear, because you have not the resolution to utter it, and\nonly have a cowardly impudence.  You boast of consciousness, but you\nare not sure of your ground, for though your mind works, yet your heart is\ndarkened and corrupt, and you cannot have a full, genuine consciousness\nwithout a pure heart.  And how intrusive you are, how you insist and\ngrimace!  Lies, lies, lies!”",
        "Of course I have myself made up all the things you say.  That, too, is\nfrom underground.  I have been for forty years listening to you through a\ncrack under the floor.  I have invented them myself, there was nothing\nelse I could invent.  It is no wonder that I have learned it by heart and it\nhas taken a literary form ....",
        "But can you really be so credulous as to think that I will print all this\nand give it to you to read too?  And another problem: why do I call you\n“gentlemen,” why do I address you as though you really were my readers?\nSuch confessions as I intend to make are never printed nor given to other\npeople to read.  Anyway, I am not strong-minded enough for that, and I\ndon’t see why I should be.  But you see a fancy has occurred to me and I\nwant to realise it at all costs.  Let me explain.",
        "Every man has reminiscences which he would not tell to everyone,\nbut only to his friends.  He has other matters in his mind which he would\nnot reveal even to his friends, but only to himself, and that in secret.  But\nthere are other things which a man is afraid to tell even to himself, and\nevery decent man has a number of such things stored away in his mind. \nThe more decent he is, the greater the number of such things in his\nmind.  Anyway, I have only lately determined to remember some of my\nearly adventures.  Till now I have always avoided them, even with a\ncertain uneasiness.  Now, when I am not only recalling them, but have\nactually decided to write an account of them, I want to try the experiment\nwhether one can, even with oneself, be perfectly open and not take\nfright at the whole truth.  I will observe, in parenthesis, that Heine says\nthat a true autobiography is almost an impossibility, and that man is\nbound to lie about himself.  He considers that Rousseau certainly told lies\nabout himself in his confessions, and even intentionally lied, out of\nvanity.  I am convinced that Heine is right; I quite understand how\nsometimes one may, out of sheer vanity, attribute regular crimes to\noneself, and indeed I can very well conceive that kind of vanity.  But\nHeine judged of people who made their confessions to the public.  I write\nonly for myself, and I wish to declare once and for all that if I write as\nthough I were addressing readers, that is simply because it is easier for me\nto write in that form.  It is a form, an empty form—I shall never have\nreaders.  I have made this plain already ...",
        "I don’t wish to be hampered by any restrictions in the compilation of\nmy notes.  I shall not attempt any system or method.  I will jot things down\nas I remember them.",
        "But here, perhaps, someone will catch at the word and ask me: if you\nreally don’t reckon on readers, why do you make such compacts with\nyourself—and on paper too—that is, that you won’t attempt any system\nor method, that you jot things down as you remember them, and so on,\nand so on?  Why are you explaining?  Why do you apologise?",
        "Well, there it is, I answer.",
        "There is a whole psychology in all this, though.  Perhaps it is simply\nthat I am a coward.  And perhaps that I purposely imagine an audience\nbefore me in order that I may be more dignified while I write.  There are\nperhaps thousands of reasons.  Again, what is my object precisely in\nwriting?  If it is not for the benefit of the public why should I not simply\nrecall these incidents in my own mind without putting them on paper?",
        "Quite so; but yet it  is more imposing on paper.  There is something\nmore impressive in it; I shall be better able to criticise myself and improve\nmy style.  Besides, I shall perhaps obtain actual relief from writing. \nToday, for instance, I am particularly oppressed by one memory of a\ndistant past.  It came back vividly to my mind a few days ago, and has\nremained haunting me like an annoying tune that one cannot get rid of. \nAnd yet I must get rid of it somehow.  I have hundreds of such reminiscences;\nbut at times some one stands out from the hundred and oppresses me.\nFor some reason I believe that if I write it down I should get rid of it.\nWhy not try?",
        "Besides, I am bored, and I never have anything to do.  Writing will be a\nsort of work.  They say work makes man kind-hearted and honest.  Well,\nhere is a chance for me, anyway.",
        "Snow is falling today, yellow and dingy.  It fell yesterday, too, and a few\ndays ago.  I fancy it is the wet snow that has reminded me of that incident\nwhich I cannot shake off now.  And so let it be a story A PROPOS of the\nfalling snow.",
