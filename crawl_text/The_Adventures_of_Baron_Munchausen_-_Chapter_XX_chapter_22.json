        "  The Baron slips through the world: after paying a visit to Mount\n  Etna he finds himself in the South Sea; visits Vulcan in his\n  passage; gets on board a Dutchman; arrives at an island of cheese,\n  surrounded by a sea of milk; describes some very extraordinary\n  objects–Lose their compass; their ship slips between the teeth of\n  a fish unknown in this part of the world; their difficulty in\n  escaping from thence; arrive in the Caspian Sea–Starves a bear to\n  death–A few waistcoat anecdotes–In this chapter, which is the\n  longest, the Baron moralises upon the virtue of veracity.",
        "Mr. Drybones’ “Travels to Sicily,” which I had read with great\npleasure, induced me to pay a visit to Mount Etna; my voyage to this\nplace was not attended with any circumstances worth relating. One\nmorning early, three or four days after my arrival, I set out from a\ncottage where I had slept, within six miles of the foot of the\nmountain, determined to explore the internal parts, if I perished in\nthe attempt. After three hours’ hard labour I found myself at the top;\nit was then, and had been for upwards of three weeks, raging: its\nappearance in this state has been so frequently noticed by different\ntravellers, that I will not tire you with descriptions of objects you\nare already acquainted with. I walked round the edge of the crater,\nwhich appeared to be fifty times at least as capacious as the Devil’s\nPunch-Bowl near Petersfield, on the Portsmouth Road, but not so broad\nat the bottom, as in that part it resembles the contracted part of a\nfunnel more than a punch-bowl. At last, having made up my mind, in I\nsprang feet foremost; I soon found myself in a warm berth, and my body\nbruised and burnt in various parts by the red-hot cinders, which, by\ntheir violent ascent, opposed my descent: however, my weight soon\nbrought me to the bottom, where I found myself in the midst of noise\nand clamour, mixed with the most horrid imprecations; after recovering\nmy senses, and feeling a reduction of my pain, I began to look about\nme. Guess, gentlemen, my astonishment, when I found myself in the\ncompany of Vulcan and his Cyclops, who had been quarrelling, for the\nthree weeks before mentioned, about the observation of good order and\ndue subordination, and which had occasioned such alarms for that space\nof time in the world above. However, my arrival restored peace to the\nwhole society, and Vulcan himself did me the honour of applying\nplasters to my wounds, which healed them immediately; he also placed\nrefreshments before me, particularly nectar, and other rich wines,\nsuch as the gods and goddesses only aspire to. After this repast was\nover Vulcan ordered Venus to show me every indulgence which my\nsituation required. To describe the apartment, and the couch on which\nI reposed, is totally impossible, therefore I will not attempt it; let\nit suffice to say, it exceeds the power of language to do it justice,\nor speak of that kind-hearted goddess in any terms equal to her merit.",
        "Vulcan gave me a very concise account of Mount Etna: he said it was\nnothing more than an accumulation of ashes thrown from his forge; that\nhe was frequently obliged to chastise his people, at whom, in his\npassion, he made it a practice to throw red-hot coals at home, which\nthey often parried with great dexterity, and then threw them up into\nthe world to place them out of his reach, for they never attempted to\nassault him in return by throwing them back again. “Our quarrels,\"\nadded he, “last sometimes three or four months, and these appearances\nof coals or cinders in the world are what I find you mortals call\neruptions.” Mount Vesuvius, he assured me, was another of his shops,\nto which he had a passage three hundred and fifty leagues under the\nbed of the sea, where similar quarrels produced similar eruptions. I\nshould have continued here as an humble attendant upon Madam Venus,\nbut some busy tattlers, who delight in mischief, whispered a tale in\nVulcan’s ear, which roused in him a fit of jealousy not to be\nappeased. Without the least previous notice he took me one morning\nunder his arm, as I was waiting upon Venus, agreeable to custom, and\ncarried me to an apartment I had never before seen, in which there\nwas, to all appearance, a well with a wide mouth: over this he held\nme at arm’s length, and saying, “Ungrateful mortal, return to the\nworld from whence you came,” without giving me the least opportunity\nof reply, dropped me in the centre. I found myself descending with an\nincreasing rapidity, till the horror of my mind deprived me of all\nreflection. I suppose I fell into a trance, from which I was suddenly\naroused by plunging into a large body of water illuminated by the rays\nof the sun!!",
        "I could, from my infancy, swim well, and play tricks in the water. I\nnow found myself in paradise, considering the horrors of mind I had\njust been released from. After looking about me some time, I could\ndiscover nothing but an expanse of sea, extending beyond the eye in\nevery direction; I also found it very cold, a different climate from\nMaster Vulcan’s shop. At last I observed at some distance a body of\namazing magnitude, like a huge rock, approaching me; I soon discovered\nit to be a piece of floating ice; I swam round it till I found a place\nwhere I could ascend to the top, which I did, but not without some\ndifficulty. Still I was out of sight of land, and despair returned\nwith double force; however, before night came on I saw a sail, which\nwe approached very fast; when it was within a very small distance I\nhailed them in German; they answered in Dutch. I then flung myself\ninto the sea, and they threw out a rope, by which I was taken on\nboard. I now inquired where we were, and was informed, in the great\nSouthern Ocean; this opened a discovery which removed all my doubts\nand difficulties. It was now evident that I had passed from Mount Etna\nthrough the centre of the earth to the South Seas: this, gentlemen,\nwas a much shorter cut than going round the world, and which no man\nhas accomplished, or ever attempted, but myself; however, the next\ntime I perform it I will be much more particular in my observations.",
        "I took some refreshment, and went to rest. The Dutch are a very rude\nsort of people; I related the Etna passage to the officers, exactly as\nI have done to you, and some of them, particularly the Captain, seemed\nby his grimace and half-sentence to doubt my veracity; however, as he\nhad kindly taken me on board his vessel, and was then in the very act\nof administering to my necessities, I pocketed the affront.",
        "I now in my turn began to inquire where they were bound? To which they\nanswered, they were in search of new discoveries; “and if,” said\nthey, “your story is true, a new passage is really discovered, and we\nshall not return disappointed.” We were now exactly in Captain Cook’s\nfirst track, and arrived the next morning in Botany Bay. This place I\nwould by no means recommend to the English government as a receptacle\nfor felons, or place of punishment; it should rather be the reward of\nmerit, nature having most bountifully bestowed her best gifts upon it.",
        "We stayed here but three days; the fourth after our departure a most\ndreadful storm arose, which in a few hours destroyed all our sails,\nsplintered our bowsprit, and brought down our topmast; it fell\ndirectly upon the box that enclosed our compass, which, with the\ncompass, was broken to pieces. Every one who has been at sea knows the\nconsequences of such a misfortune: we now were at a loss where to\nsteer. At length the storm abated, which was followed by a steady,\nbrisk gale, that carried us at least forty knots an hour for six\nmonths! [we should suppose the Baron has made a little mistake, and\nsubstituted months for days] when we began to observe an amazing\nchange in everything about us: our spirits became light, our noses\nwere regaled with the most aromatic effluvia imaginable: the sea had\nalso changed its complexion, and from green became white!! Soon after\nthese wonderful alterations we saw land, and not at any great distance\nan inlet, which we sailed up near sixty leagues, and found it wide and\ndeep, flowing with milk of the most delicious taste. Here we landed,\nand soon found it was an island consisting of one large cheese: we\ndiscovered this by one of the company fainting away as soon as we\nlanded: this man always had an aversion to cheese; when he recovered,\nhe desired the cheese to be taken from under his feet: upon\nexamination we found him perfectly right, for the whole island, as\nbefore observed, was nothing but a cheese of immense magnitude! Upon\nthis the inhabitants, who are amazingly numerous, principally sustain\nthemselves, and it grows every night in proportion as it is consumed\nin the day. Here seemed to be plenty of vines, with bunches of large\ngrapes, which, upon being pressed, yielded nothing but milk. We saw\nthe inhabitants running races upon the surface of the milk: they were\nupright, comely figures, nine feet high, have three legs, and but one\narm; upon the whole, their form was graceful, and when they quarrel,\nthey exercise a straight horn, which grows in adults from the centre\nof their foreheads, with great adroitness; they did not sink at all,\nbut ran and walked upon the surface of the milk, as we do upon a\nbowling-green.",
        "Upon this island of cheese grows great plenty of corn, the ears of\nwhich produce loaves of bread, ready made, of a round form like\nmushrooms. We discovered, in our rambles over this cheese, seventeen\nother rivers of milk, and ten of wine.",
        "After thirty-eight days’ journey we arrived on the opposite side to\nthat on which we landed: here we found some blue mould, as cheese-\neaters call it, from whence spring all kinds of rich fruit; instead of\nbreeding mites it produced peaches, nectarines, apricots, and a\nthousand delicious fruits which we are not acquainted with. In these\ntrees, which are of an amazing size, were plenty of birds’ nests;\namongst others was a king-fisher’s of prodigious magnitude; it was at\nleast twice the circumference of the dome of St. Paul’s Church in\nLondon. Upon inspection, this nest was made of huge trees curiously\njoined together; there were, let me see (for I make it a rule always\nto speak within compass), there were upwards of five hundred eggs in\nthe nest, and each of them was as large as four common hogsheads, or\neight barrels, and we could not only see, but hear the young ones\nchirping within. Having, with great fatigue, cut open one of these\neggs, we let out a young one unfeathered, considerably larger than\ntwenty full-grown vultures. Just as we had given this youngster his\nliberty the old kingfisher lighted, and seizing our captain, who had\nbeen active in breaking the egg, in one of her claws, flew with him\nabove a mile high, and then let him drop into the sea, but not till\nshe had beaten all his teeth out of his mouth with her wings.",
        "Dutchmen generally swim well: he soon joined us, and we retreated to\nour ship. On our return we took a different route, and observed many\nstrange objects. We shot two wild oxen, each with one horn, also like\nthe inhabitants, except that it sprouted from between the eyes of\nthese animals; we were afterwards concerned at having destroyed them,\nas we found, by inquiry, they tamed these creatures, and used them as\nwe do horses, to ride upon and draw their carriages; their flesh, we\nwere informed, is excellent, but useless where people live upon cheese\nand milk. When we had reached within two days’ journey of the ship we\nobserved three men hanging to a tall tree by their heels; upon\ninquiring the cause of their punishment, I found they had all been\ntravellers, and upon their return home had deceived their friends by\ndescribing places they never saw, and relating things that never\nhappened: this gave me no concern, as I have ever confined myself to\nfacts.",
        "As soon as we arrived at the ship we unmoored, and set sail from this\nextraordinary country, when, to our astonishment, all the trees upon\nshore, of which there were a great number very tall and large, paid\ntheir respects to us twice, bowing to exact time, and immediately\nrecovered their former posture, which was quite erect.",
        "By what we could learn of this CHEESE, it was considerably larger than\nthe continent of all Europe!",
        "After sailing three months we knew not where, being still without\ncompass, we arrived in a sea which appeared to be almost black: upon\ntasting it we found it most excellent wine, and had great difficulty\nto keep the sailors from getting drunk with it: however, in a few\nhours we found ourselves surrounded by whales and other animals of an\nimmense magnitude, one of which appeared to be too large for the eye\nto form a judgment of: we did not see him till we were close to him.\nThis monster drew our ship, with all her masts standing, and sails\nbent, by suction into his mouth, between his teeth, which were much\nlarger and taller than the mast of a first-rate man-of-war. After we\nhad been in his mouth some time he opened it pretty wide, took in an\nimmense quantity of water, and floated our vessel, which was at least\n500 tons burthen, into his stomach; here we lay as quiet as at anchor\nin a dead calm. The air, to be sure, was rather warm, and very\noffensive. We found anchors, cables, boats, and barges in abundance,\nand a considerable number of ships, some laden and some not, which\nthis creature had swallowed. Everything was transacted by torch-light;\nno sun, no moon, no planet, to make observations from. We were all\ngenerally afloat and aground twice a-day; whenever he drank, it became\nhigh water with us; and when he evacuated, we found ourselves aground;\nupon a moderate computation, he took in more water at a single draught\nthan is generally to be found in the Lake of Geneva, though that is\nabove thirty miles in circumference. On the second day of our\nconfinement in these regions of darkness, I ventured at low water, as\nwe called it when the ship was aground, to ramble with the Captain,\nand a few of the other officers, with lights in our hands; we met with\npeople of all nations, to the amount of upwards of ten thousand; they\nwere going to hold a council how to recover their liberty; some of\nthem having lived in this animal’s stomach several years; there were\nseveral children here who had never seen the world, their mothers\nhaving lain in repeatedly in this warm situation. Just as the chairman\nwas going to inform us of the business upon which we were assembled,\nthis plaguy fish, becoming thirsty, drank in his usual manner; the\nwater poured in with such impetuosity, that we were all obliged to\nretreat to our respective ships immediately, or run the risk of being\ndrowned; some were obliged to swim for it, and with difficulty saved\ntheir lives. In a few hours after we were more fortunate, we met again\njust after the monster had evacuated. I was chosen chairman, and the\nfirst thing I did was to propose splicing two main-masts together, and\nthe next time he opened his mouth to be ready to wedge them in, so as\nto prevent his shutting it. It was unanimously approved. One hundred\nstout men were chosen upon this service. We had scarcely got our masts\nproperly prepared when an opportunity offered; the monster opened his\nmouth, immediately the top of the mast was placed against the roof,\nand the other end pierced his tongue, which effectually prevented him\nfrom shutting his mouth. As soon as everything in his stomach was\nafloat, we manned a few boats, who rowed themselves and us into the\nworld. The daylight, after, as near as we could judge, three months’\nconfinement in total darkness, cheered our spirits surprisingly. When\nwe had all taken our leave of this capacious animal, we mustered just\na fleet of ninety-five ships, of all nations, who had been in this\nconfined situation.",
        "We left the two masts in his mouth, to prevent others being confined\nin the same horrid gulf of darkness and filth. Our first object was to\nlearn what part of the world we were in; this we were for some time at\na loss to ascertain: at last I found, from former observations, that\nwe were in the Caspian Sea! which washes part of the country of the\nCalmuck Tartars. How we came here is was impossible to conceive, as\nthis sea has no communication with any other. One of the inhabitants\nof the Cheese Island, whom I had brought with me, accounted for it\nthus:–that the monster in whose stomach we had been so long confined\nhad carried us here through some subterraneous passage; however, we\npushed to shore, and I was the first who landed. Just as I put my foot\nupon the ground a large bear leaped upon me with its fore-paws; I\ncaught one in each hand, and squeezed him till he cried out most\nlustily; however, in this position I held him till I starved him to\ndeath. You may laugh, gentlemen, but this was soon accomplished, as I\nprevented him licking his paws. From hence I travelled up to St.\nPetersburg a second time: here an old friend gave me a most excellent\npointer, descended from the famous bitch before-mentioned, that\nlittered while she was hunting a hare. I had the misfortune to have\nhim shot soon after by a blundering sportsman, who fired at him\ninstead of a covey of partridges which he had just set. Of this\ncreature’s skin I have had this waistcoat made (showing his\nwaistcoat), which always leads me involuntarily to game if I walk in\nthe fields in the proper season, and when I come within shot, one of\nthe buttons constantly flies off, and lodges upon the spot where the\nsport is; and as the birds rise, being always primed and cocked, I\nnever miss them. Here are now but three buttons left. I shall have a\nnew set sewed on against the shooting season commences.",
        "When a covey of partridges is disturbed in this manner, by the button\nfalling amongst them, they always rise from the ground in a direct\nline before each other. I one day, by forgetting to take my ramrod out\nof my gun, shot it straight through a leash, as regularly as if the\ncook had spitted them. I had forgot to put in any shot, and the rod\nhad been made so hot with the powder, that the birds were completely\nroasted by the time I reached home.",
        "Since my arrival in England I have accomplished what I had very much\nat heart, viz., providing for the inhabitant of the Cheese Island,\nwhom I had brought with me. My old friend, Sir William Chambers, who\nis entirely indebted to me for all his ideas of Chinese gardening, by\na description of which he has gained such high reputation; I say,\ngentlemen, in a discourse which I had with this gentlemen, he seemed\nmuch distressed for a contrivance to light the lamps at the new\nbuildings, Somerset House; the common mode with ladders, he observed,\nwas both dirty and inconvenient. My native of the Cheese Island popped\ninto my head; he was only nine feet high when I first brought him from\nhis own country, but was now increased to ten and a half: I introduced\nhim to Sir William, and he is appointed to that honourable office. He\nis also to carry, under a large cloak, a utensil in each coat pocket,\ninstead of those four which Sir William has very properly fixed for\nprivate purposes in so conspicuous a situation, the great quadrangle.",
        "He has also obtained from Mr. PITT the situation of messenger to his\nMajesty’s lords of the bed-chamber, whose principal employment will\nnow be, divulging the secrets of the Royal household to their\nworthy Patron.",
