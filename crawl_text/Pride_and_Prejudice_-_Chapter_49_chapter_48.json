        "Two days after Mr. Bennet’s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were\nwalking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw\nthe housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she\ncame to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her;\nbut, instead of the expected summons, when they approached\nher, she said to Miss Bennet, “I beg your pardon, madam, for\ninterrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some\ngood news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.”",
        "“What do you mean, Hill?  We have heard nothing from town.”",
        "“Dear madam,” cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, “don’t\nyou know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner?\nHe has been here this half-hour, and master has had a letter.”",
        "Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.\nThey ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from\nthence to the library; their father was in neither; and they\nwere on the point of seeking him upstairs with their mother,\nwhen they were met by the butler, who said:",
        "“If you are looking for my master, ma’am, he is walking\ntowards the little copse.”",
        "Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall\nonce more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was\ndeliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side\nof the paddock.",
        "Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running\nas Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for\nbreath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out:",
        "“Oh, papa, what news–what news?  Have you heard from my\nuncle?”",
        "“Yes I have had a letter from him by express.”",
        "“Well, and what news does it bring–good or bad?”",
        "“What is there of good to be expected?” said he, taking the\nletter from his pocket.  “But perhaps you would like to read it.”",
        "Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.  Jane now came up.",
        "“Read it aloud,” said their father, “for I hardly know myself what\nit is about.”",
        "“Gracechurch Street, Monday,\nAugust 2.",
        "“My Dear Brother,",
        "“At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and\nsuch as, upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction.\nSoon after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to\nfind out in what part of London they were.  The particulars I\nreserve till we meet; it is enough to know they are discovered.\nI have seen them both–”",
        "“Then it is as I always hoped,” cried Jane; “they are married!”",
        "Elizabeth read on:",
        "“I have seen them both.  They are not married, nor can I find\nthere was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to\nperform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your\nside, I hope it will not be long before they are.  All that is\nrequired of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement,\nher equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your\nchildren after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,\nmoreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during\nyour life, one hundred pounds per annum.  These are conditions\nwhich, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying\nwith, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you.  I shall\nsend this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me\nyour answer.  You will easily comprehend, from these particulars,\nthat Mr. Wickham’s circumstances are not so hopeless as they\nare generally believed to be.  The world has been deceived in\nthat respect; and I am happy to say there will be some little\nmoney, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my\nniece, in addition to her own fortune.  If, as I conclude will\nbe the case, you send me full powers to act in your name\nthroughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give\ndirections to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement.\nThere will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town\nagain; therefore stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my\ndiligence and care.  Send back your answer as fast as you can,\nand be careful to write explicitly.  We have judged it best that\nmy niece should be married from this house, of which I hope\nyou will approve.  She comes to us to-day.  I shall write again\nas soon as anything more is determined on.  Yours, etc.,",
        "“Edw. Gardiner.”",
        "“Is it possible?” cried Elizabeth, when she had finished.  “Can it\nbe possible that he will marry her?”",
        "“Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,” said\nher sister.  “My dear father, I congratulate you.”",
        "“And have you answered the letter?” cried Elizabeth.",
        "“No; but it must be done soon.”",
        "Most earnestly did she then entreaty him to lose no more time\nbefore he wrote.",
        "“Oh! my dear father,” she cried, “come back and write immediately.\nConsider how important every moment is in such a case.”",
        "“Let me write for you,” said Jane, “if you dislike the trouble\nyourself.”",
        "“I dislike it very much,” he replied; “but it must be done.”",
        "And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards\nthe house.",
        "“And may I ask–” said Elizabeth; “but the terms, I suppose,\nmust be complied with.”",
        "“Complied with!  I am only ashamed of his asking so little.”",
        "“And they must marry!  Yet he is such a man!”",
        "“Yes, yes, they must marry.  There is nothing else to be done.\nBut there are two things that I want very much to know; one is,\nhow much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about;\nand the other, how am I ever to pay him.”",
        "“Money!  My uncle!” cried Jane, “what do you mean, sir?”",
        "“I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so\nslight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and\nfifty after I am gone.”",
        "“That is very true,” said Elizabeth; “though it had not occurred\nto me before.  His debts to be discharged, and something still\nto remain!  Oh! it must be my uncle’s doings!  Generous, good\nman, I am afraid he has distressed himself.  A small sum could\nnot do all this.”",
        "“No,” said her father; “Wickham’s a fool if he takes her with a\nfarthing less than ten thousand pounds.  I should be sorry to\nthink so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.”",
        "“Ten thousand pounds!  Heaven forbid!  How is half such a\nsum to be repaid?”",
        "Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought,\ncontinued silent till they reached the house.  Their father then\nwent on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the\nbreakfast-room.",
        "“And they are really to be married!” cried Elizabeth, as soon\nas they were by themselves.  “How strange this is!  And for\nthis we are to be thankful.  That they should marry, small as\nis their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character,\nwe are forced to rejoice.  Oh, Lydia!”",
        "“I comfort myself with thinking,” replied Jane, “that he certainly\nwould not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her.\nThough our kind uncle has done something towards clearing\nhim, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like\nit, has been advanced.  He has children of his own, and may\nhave more.  How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?”",
        "“If he were ever able to learn what Wickham’s debts have been,\"\nsaid Elizabeth, “and how much is settled on his side on our\nsister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for\nthem, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own.  The\nkindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited.  Their\ntaking her home, and affording her their personal protection\nand countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years\nof gratitude cannot enough acknowledge.  By this time she\nis actually with them!  If such goodness does not make her\nmiserable now, she will never deserve to be happy!  What a\nmeeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!”",
        "“We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,\"\nsaid Jane: “I hope and trust they will yet be happy.  His\nconsenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is\ncome to a right way of thinking.  Their mutual affection will\nsteady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly,\nand live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their\npast imprudence forgotten.”",
        "“Their conduct has been such,” replied Elizabeth, “as neither\nyou, nor I, nor anybody can ever forget.  It is useless to talk\nof it.”",
        "It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all\nlikelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened.  They went\nto the library, therefore, and asked their father whether he\nwould not wish them to make it known to her.  He was writing\nand, without raising his head, coolly replied:",
        "“Just as you please.”",
        "“May we take my uncle’s letter to read to her?”",
        "“Take whatever you like, and get away.”",
        "Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went\nupstairs together.  Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet:\none communication would, therefore, do for all.  After a slight\npreparation for good news, the letter was read aloud.  Mrs.\nBennet could hardly contain herself.  As soon as Jane had read\nMr. Gardiner’s hope of Lydia’s  being soon married, her joy\nburst forth, and every following sentence added to its\nexuberance.  She was now in an irritation as violent from\ndelight, as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation.\nTo know that her daughter would be married was enough.  She\nwas disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any\nremembrance of her misconduct.",
        "“My dear, dear Lydia!” she cried.  “This is delightful indeed!\nShe will be married!  I shall see her again!  She will be married\nat sixteen!  My good, kind brother!  I knew how it would be.  I\nknew he would manage everything!  How I long to see her!  and\nto see dear Wickham too!  But the clothes, the wedding clothes!\nI will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly.  Lizzy,\nmy dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will\ngive her.  Stay, stay, I will go myself.  Ring the bell, Kitty, for\nHill.  I will put on my things in a moment.  My dear, dear Lydia!\nHow merry we shall be together when we meet!”",
        "Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the\nviolence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the\nobligations which Mr. Gardiner’s behaviour laid them all under.",
        "“For we must attribute this happy conclusion,” she added, “in a\ngreat measure to his kindness.  We are persuaded that he has\npledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money.”",
        "“Well,” cried her mother, “it is all very right; who should do it\nbut her own uncle?  If he had not had a family of his own, I and\nmy children must have had all his money, you know; and it is the\nfirst time we have ever had anything from him, except a few\npresents.  Well!  I am so happy!  In a short time I shall have\na daughter married.  Mrs. Wickham!  How well it sounds!  And\nshe was only sixteen last June.  My dear Jane, I am in such a\nflutter, that I am sure I can’t write; so I will dictate, and you\nwrite for me.  We will settle with your father about the money\nafterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.”",
        "She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico,\nmuslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very\nplentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty,\npersuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be\nconsulted.  One day’s delay, she observed, would be of small\nimportance; and her mother was too happy to be quite so\nobstinate as usual.  Other schemes, too, came into her head.",
        "“I will go to Meryton,” said she, “as soon as I am dressed, and\ntell the good, good news to my sister Philips.  And as I come\nback, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long.  Kitty, run down\nand order the carriage.  An airing would do me a great deal of\ngood, I am sure.  Girls, can I do anything for you in Meryton?\nOh!  Here comes Hill!  My dear Hill, have you heard the good\nnews?  Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have\na bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.”",
        "Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy.  Elizabeth received\nher congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly,\ntook refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.",
        "Poor Lydia’s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that\nit was no worse, she had need to be thankful.  She felt it so;\nand though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor\nworldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister, in\nlooking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she\nfelt all the advantages of what they had gained.",
