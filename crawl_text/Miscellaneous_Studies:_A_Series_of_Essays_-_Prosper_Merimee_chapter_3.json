        "FOR one born in eighteen hundred and three much was recently become\nincredible that had at least warmed the imagination even of the\nsceptical eighteenth century.  Napoleon, sealing the tomb of the\nRevolution, had foreclosed many a problem, extinguished many a hope,\nin the sphere of practice.  And the mental parallel was drawn by\nHeine.  In the mental world too a great outlook had lately been cut\noff.  After Kant’s criticism of the mind, its pretensions to pass\nbeyond the limits of individual experience seemed as dead as those of\nold French royalty.  And Kant did but furnish its innermost theoretic\nforce to a more general criticism, which had withdrawn from every\ndepartment of action, underlying principles once thought eternal.  A\ntime of disillusion followed.  The typical personality of the day was\nObermann, the very genius of ennui, a Frenchman disabused even of\npatriotism, who has hardly strength enough to die.",
        "[12] More energetic souls, however, would recover themselves, and\nfind some way of making the best of a changed world.  Art: the\npassions, above all, the ecstasy and sorrow of love: a purely\nempirical knowledge of nature and man: these still remained, at least\nfor pastime, in a world of which it was no longer proposed to\ncalculate the remoter issues:–art, passion, science, however, in a\nsomewhat novel attitude towards the practical interests of life.  The\ndesillusionne, who had found in Kant’s negations the last word\nconcerning an unseen world, and is living, on the morrow of the\nRevolution, under a monarchy made out of hand, might seem cut off\nfrom certain ancient natural hopes, and will demand, from what is to\ninterest him at all, something in the way of artificial stimulus.  He\nhas lost that sense of large proportion in things, that all-embracing\nprospect of life as a whole (from end to end of time and space, it\nhad seemed), the utmost expanse of which was afforded from a\ncathedral tower of the Middle Age: by the church of the thirteenth\ncentury, that is to say, with its consequent aptitude for the\nco-ordination of human effort.  Deprived of that exhilarating yet\npacific outlook, imprisoned now in the narrow cell of its own\nsubjective experience, the action of a powerful nature will be\nintense, but exclusive and peculiar.  It will come to art, or\nscience, to the experience of life itself, not as to portions of\nhuman nature’s daily food, but as to [13] something that must be, by\nthe circumstances of the case, exceptional; almost as men turn in\ndespair to gambling or narcotics, and in a little while the narcotic,\nthe game of chance or skill, is valued for its own sake.  The\nvocation of the artist, of the student of life or books, will be\nrealised with something–say! of fanaticism, as an end in itself,\nunrelated, unassociated.  The science he turns to will be a science\nof crudest fact; the passion extravagant, a passionate love of\npassion, varied through all the exotic phases of French fiction as\ninaugurated by Balzac; the art exaggerated, in matter or form, or\nboth, as in Hugo or Baudelaire.  The development of these conditions\nis the mental story of the nineteenth century, especially as\nexemplified in France.",
        "In no century would Prosper Merimee have been a theologian or\nmetaphysician.  But that sense of negation, of theoretic insecurity,\nwas in the air, and conspiring with what was of like tendency in\nhimself made of him a central type of disillusion.  In him the\npassive ennui of Obermann became a satiric, aggressive, almost angry\nconviction of the littleness of the world around; it was as if man’s\nfatal limitations constituted a kind of stupidity in him, what the\nFrench call betise.  Gossiping friends, indeed, linked what was\nconstitutional in him and in the age with an incident of his earliest\nyears.  Corrected for some childish fault, in passionate distress, he\noverhears a half-pitying laugh at his expense, and has determined,\n[14] in a moment, never again to give credit–to be for ever on his\nguard, especially against his own instinctive movements.  Quite\nunreserved, certainly, he never was again.  Almost everywhere he\ncould detect the hollow ring of fundamental nothingness under the\napparent surface of things.  Irony surely, habitual irony, would be\nthe proper complement thereto, on his part.  In his infallible self-\npossession, you might even fancy him a mere man of the world, with a\nspecial aptitude for matters of fact.  Though indifferent in\npolitics, he rises to social, to political eminence; but all the\nwhile he is feeding all his scholarly curiosity, his imagination, the\nvery eye, with the, to him ever delightful, relieving, reassuring\nspectacle, of those straightforward forces in human nature, which are\nalso matters of fact.  There is the formula of Merimee! the\nenthusiastic amateur of rude, crude, naked force in men and women\nwherever it could be found; himself carrying ever, as a mask, the\nconventional attire of the modern world–carrying it with an\ninfinite, contemptuous grace, as if that, too, were an all-sufficient\nend in itself.  With a natural gift for words, for expression, it\nwill be his literary function to draw back the veil of time from the\ntrue greatness of old Roman character; the veil of modern habit from\nthe primitive energy of the creatures of his fancy, as the Lettres a\nune Inconnue discovered to general gaze, after his death, a certain\ndepth of [15] passionate force which had surprised him in himself.\nAnd how forcible will be their outlines in an otherwise insignificant\nworld!  Fundamental belief gone, in almost all of us, at least some\nrelics of it remain–queries, echoes, reactions, after-thoughts; and\nthey help to make an atmosphere, a mental atmosphere, hazy perhaps,\nyet with many secrets of soothing light and shade, associating more\ndefinite objects to each other by a perspective pleasant to the\ninward eye against a hopefully receding background of remoter and\never remoter possibilities.  Not so with Merimee!  For him the\nfundamental criticism has nothing more than it can do; and there are\nno half-lights.  The last traces of hypothesis, of supposition, are\nevaporated.  Sylla, the false Demetrius, Carmen, Colomba, that\nimpassioned self within himself, have no atmosphere.  Painfully\ndistinct in outline, inevitable to sight, unrelieved, there they\nstand, like solitary mountain forms on some hard, perfectly\ntransparent day.  What Merimee gets around his singularly\nsculpturesque creations is neither more nor less than empty space.",
        "So disparate are his writings that at first sight you might fancy\nthem only the random efforts of a man of pleasure or affairs, who,\nturning to this or that for the relief of a vacant hour, discovers to\nhis surprise a workable literary gift, of whose scope, however, he is\nnot precisely aware.  His sixteen volumes nevertheless range\nthemselves in three compact groups.  There are his letters [16] –\nthose Lettres a une Inconnue, and his letters to the librarian\nPanizzi, revealing him in somewhat close contact with political\nintrigue.  But in this age of novelists, it is as a writer of novels,\nand of fiction in the form of highly descriptive drama, that he will\ncount for most:–Colomba, for instance, by its intellectual depth of\nmotive, its firmly conceived structure, by the faultlessness of its\nexecution, vindicating the function of the novel as no tawdry light\nliterature, but in very deed a fine art.  The Chronique du Regne de\nCharles IX., an unusually successful specimen of historical romance,\nlinks his imaginative work to the third group of Merimee’s writings,\nhis historical essays.  One resource of the disabused soul of our\ncentury, as we saw, would be the empirical study of facts, the\nempirical science of nature and man, surviving all dead metaphysical\nphilosophies.  Merimee, perhaps, may have had in him the making of a\nmaster of such science, disinterested, patient, exact: scalpel in\nhand, we may fancy, he would have penetrated far.  But quite\ncertainly he had something of genius for the exact study of history,\nfor the pursuit of exact truth, with a keenness of scent as if that\nalone existed, in some special area of historic fact, to be\ndetermined by his own peculiar mental preferences.  Power here too\nagain,–the crude power of men and women which mocks, while it makes\nits use of, average human nature: it was the magic function of\nhistory to put one in living [17] contact with that.  To weigh the\npurely physiognomic import of the memoir, of the pamphlet saved by\nchance, the letter, the anecdote, the very gossip by which one came\nface to face with energetic personalities: there lay the true\nbusiness of the historic student, not in that pretended theoretic\ninterpretation of events by their mechanic causes, with which he\ndupes others if not invariably himself.  In the great hero of the\nSocial War, in Sylla, studied, indeed, through his environment, but\nonly so far as that was in dynamic contact with himself, you saw,\nwithout any manner of doubt, on one side, the solitary height of\nhuman genius; on the other, though on the seemingly so heroic stage\nof antique Roman story, the wholly inexpressive level of the humanity\nof every day, the spectacle of man’s eternal betise.  Fascinated,\nlike a veritable son of the old pagan Renaissance, by the grandeur,\nthe concentration, the satiric hardness of ancient Roman character,\nit is to Russia nevertheless that he most readily turns–youthful\nRussia, whose native force, still unbelittled by our western\ncivilisation, seemed to have in it the promise of a more dignified\ncivilisation to come.  It was as if old Rome itself were here again;\nas, occasionally, a new quarry is laid open of what was thought long\nsince exhausted, ancient marble, cipollino or verde antique.\nMerimee, indeed, was not the first to discern the fitness for\nimaginative service of the career of “the false Demetrius,” pretended\n[18] son of Ivan the Terrible; but he alone seeks its utmost force in\na calm, matter-of-fact carefully ascertained presentment of the naked\nevents.  Yes!  In the last years of the Valois, when its fierce\npassions seemed to be bursting France to pieces, you might have seen,\nfar away beyond the rude Polish dominion of which one of those Valois\nprinces had become king, a display more effective still of\nexceptional courage and cunning, of horror in circumstance, of\nbetise, of course, of betise and a slavish capacity of being duped,\nin average mankind: all that under a mask of solemn Muscovite court-\nceremonial.  And Merimee’s style, simple and unconcerned, but with\nthe eye ever on its object, lends itself perfectly to such purpose–\nto an almost phlegmatic discovery of the facts, in all their crude\nnatural colouring, as if he but held up to view, as a piece of\nevidence, some harshly dyed oriental carpet from the sumptuous floor\nof the Kremlin, on which blood had fallen.",
        "A lover of ancient Rome, its great character and incident, Merimee\nvalued, as if it had been personal property of his, every extant\nrelic of it in the art that had been most expressive of its genius–\narchitecture.  In that grandiose art of building, the most national,\nthe most tenaciously rooted of all the arts in the stable conditions\nof life, there were historic documents hardly less clearly legible\nthan the manuscript chronicle.  By the mouth of those stately\nRomanesque [19] churches, scattered in so many strongly characterised\nvarieties over the soil of France, above all in the hot, half-pagan\nsouth, the people of empire still protested, as he understood,\nagainst what must seem a smaller race.  The Gothic enthusiasm indeed\nwas already born, and he shared it–felt intelligently the\nfascination of the Pointed Style, but only as a further\ntransformation of old Roman structure; the round arch is for him\nstill the great architectural form, la forme noble, because it was to\nbe seen in the monuments of antiquity.  Romanesque, Gothic, the\nmanner of the Renaissance, of Lewis the Fourteenth:–they were all,\nas in a written record, in the old abbey church of Saint-Savin, of\nwhich Merimee was instructed to draw up a report.  Again, it was as\nif to his concentrated attention through many months that deserted\nsanctuary of Benedict were the only thing on earth.  Its beauties,\nits peculiarities, its odd military features, its faded mural\npaintings, are no merely picturesque matter for the pencil he could\nuse so well, but the lively record of a human society.  With what\nappetite! with all the animation of George Sand’s Mauprat, he tells\nthe story of romantic violence having its way there, defiant of law,\nso late as the year 1611; of the family of robber nobles perched, as\nabbots in commendam, in those sacred places.  That grey, pensive old\nchurch in the little valley of Poitou, was for a time like Santa\nMaria del Fiore to [20] Michelangelo, the mistress of his affections-\n-of a practical affection; for the result of his elaborate report was\nthe Government grant which saved the place from ruin.  In\narchitecture, certainly, he had what for that day was nothing less\nthan intuition–an intuitive sense, above all, of its logic, of the\nnecessity which draws  into one all minor changes, as elements in a\nreasonable development.  And his care for it, his curiosity about it,\nwere symptomatic of his own genius.  Structure, proportion, design, a\nsort of architectural coherency: that was the aim of his method in\nthe art of literature, in that form of it, especially, which he will\nlive by, in fiction.",
        "As historian and archaeologist, as a man of erudition turned artist,\nhe is well seen in the Chronique du Regne de Charles IX., by which we\npass naturally from Merimee’s critical or scientific work to the\nproducts of his imagination.  What economy in the use of a large\nantiquarian knowledge! what an instinct amid a hundred details, for\nthe detail that carries physiognomy in it, that really tells!  And\nagain what outline, what absolute clarity of outline!  For the\nhistorian of that puzzling age which centres in the “Eve of Saint\nBartholomew,” outward events themselves seem obscured by the\nvagueness of motive of the actors in them.  But Merimee, disposing of\nthem as an artist, not in love with half-lights, compels events and\nactors alike to the clearness he [21] desired; takes his side without\nhesitation; and makes his hero a Huguenot of pure blood, allowing its\ncharm, in that charming youth, even to Huguenot piety.  And as for\nthe incidents–however freely it may be undermined by historic doubt,\nall reaches a perfectly firm surface, at least for the eye of the\nreader.  The Chronicle of Charles the Ninth is like a series of\nmasterly drawings in illustration of a period–the period in which\ntwo other masters of French fiction have found their opportunity,\nmainly by the development of its actual historic characters.  Those\ncharacters–Catherine de Medicis and the rest–Merimee, with\nsignificant irony and self-assertion, sets aside, preferring to think\nof them as essentially commonplace.  For him the interest lies in the\ncreatures of his own will, who carry in them, however, so lightly! a\nlearning equal to Balzac’s, greater than that of Dumas.  He knows\nwith like completeness the mere fashions of the time–how courtier\nand soldier dressed themselves, and the large movements of the\ndesperate game which fate or chance was playing with those pretty\npieces.  Comparing that favourite century of the French Renaissance\nwith our own, he notes a decadence of the more energetic passions in\nthe interest of general tranquillity, and perhaps (only perhaps!) of\ngeneral happiness.  “Assassination,” he observes, as if with regret,\n“is no longer a part of our manners.”  In fact, the duel, and the\nwhole [22] morality of the duel, which does but enforce a certain\nregularity on assassination, what has been well called le sentiment\ndu fer, the sentiment of deadly steel, had then the disposition of\nrefined existence.  It was, indeed, very different, and is, in\nMerimee’s romance.  In his gallant hero, Bernard de Mergy, all the\npromptings of the lad’s virile goodness are in natural collusion with\nthat sentiment du fer.  Amid his ingenuous blushes, his prayers, and\nplentiful tears between-while, it is a part of his very sex.  With\nhis delightful, fresh-blown air, he is for ever tossing the sheath\nfrom the sword, but always as if into bright natural sunshine.  A\nwinsome, yet withal serious and even piteous figure, he conveys his\npleasantness, in spite of its gloomy theme, into Merimee’s one quite\ncheerful book.",
        "Cheerful, because, after all, the gloomy passions it presents are but\nthe accidents of a particular age, and not like the mental conditions\nin which Merimee was most apt to look for the spectacle of human\npower, allied to madness or disease in the individual.  For him, at\nleast, it was the office of fiction to carry one into a different if\nnot a better world than that actually around us; and if the Chronicle\nof Charles the Ninth provided an escape from the tame circumstances\nof contemporary life into an impassioned past, Colomba is a measure\nof the resources for mental alteration which may be found even in the\nmodern age.  There was a corner of [23] the French Empire, in the\nmanners of which assassination still had a large part.",
        "“The beauty of Corsica,” says Merimee, “is grave and sad.  The aspect\nof the capital does but augment the impression caused by the solitude\nthat surrounds it.  There is no movement in the streets.  You hear\nthere none of the laughter, the singing, the loud talking, common in\nthe towns of Italy.  Sometimes, under the shadow of a tree on the\npromenade, a dozen armed peasants will be playing cards, or looking\non at the game.  The Corsican is naturally silent.  Those who walk\nthe pavement are all strangers: the islanders stand at their doors:\nevery one seems to be on the watch, like a falcon on its nest.  All\naround the gulf there is but an expanse of tanglework; beyond it,\nbleached mountains.  Not a habitation!  Only, here and there, on the\nheights about the town, certain white constructions detach themselves\nfrom the background of green.  They are funeral chapels or family\ntombs.”",
        "Crude in colour, sombre, taciturn, Corsica, as Merimee here describes\nit, is like the national passion of the Corsican–that morbid\npersonal pride, usurping the place even of grief for the dead, which\ncenturies of traditional violence had concentrated into an all-\nabsorbing passion for bloodshed, for bloody revenges, in collusion\nwith the natural wildness, and the wild social condition of the\nisland still unaffected even by the finer [24] ethics of the duel.\nThe supremacy of that passion is well indicated by the cry, put into\nthe mouth of a young man in the presence of the corpse of his father\ndeceased in the course of nature–a young man meant to be\ncommonplace.  “Ah!  Would thou hadst died malamorte–by violence!  We\nmight have avenged thee!”",
        "In Colomba, Merimee’s best known creation, it is united to a\nsingularly wholesome type of personal beauty, a natural grace of\nmanner which is irresistible, a cunning intellect patiently diverting\nevery circumstance to its design; and presents itself as a kind of\ngenius, allied to fatal disease of mind.  The interest of Merimee’s\nbook is that it allows us to watch the action of this malignant power\non Colomba’s brother, Orso della Robbia, as it discovers, rouses,\nconcentrates to the leaping-point, in the somewhat weakly diffused\nnature of the youth, the dormant elements of a dark humour akin to\nher own.  Two years after his father’s murder, presumably at the\ninstigation of his ancestral enemies, the young lieutenant is\nreturning home in the company of two humorously conventional English\npeople, himself now half Parisianised, with an immense natural\ncheerfulness, and willing to believe an account of the crime which\nrelieves those hated Barricini of all complicity in its guilt.  But\nfrom the first, Colomba, with “voice soft and musical,” is at his\nside, gathering every accident and echo and circumstance, the very\nlightest circumstance, [25] into the chain of necessity which draws\nhim to the action every one at home expects of him as the head of his\nrace.  He is not unaware.  Her very silence on the matter speaks so\nplainly.  “You are forming me!” he admits.  “Well! ’Hot shot, or cold\nsteel!’–you see I have not forgotten my Corsican.”  More and more,\nas he goes on his way with her, he finds himself accessible to the\ndamning thoughts he has so long combated.  In horror, he tries to\ndisperse them by the memory of his comrades in the regiment, the\ndrawing-rooms of Paris, the English lady who has promised to be his\nbride, and will shortly visit him in the humble manoir of his\nancestors.  From his first step among them the villagers of\nPietranera, divided already into two rival camps, are watching him in\nsuspense–Pietranera, perched among those deep forests where the\nstifled sense of violent death is everywhere.  Colomba places in his\nhands the little chest which contains the father’s shirt covered with\ngreat spots of blood.  “Behold the lead that struck him!” and she\nlaid on the shirt two rusted bullets.  “Orso! you will avenge him!\"\nShe embraces him with a kind of madness, kisses wildly the bullets\nand the shirt, leaves him with the terrible relics already exerting\ntheir mystic power upon him.  It is as if in the nineteenth century a\ngirl, amid Christian habits, had gone back to that primitive old\npagan version of the story of the Grail, which [26] identifies it not\nwith the Most Precious Blood, but only with the blood of a murdered\nrelation crying for vengeance.  Awake at last in his old chamber at\nPietranera, the house of the Barricini at the other end of the\nsquare, with its rival tower and rudely carved escutcheons, stares\nhim in the face.  His ancestral enemy is there, an aged man now, but\nwith two well-grown sons, like two stupid dumb animals, whose\ninnocent blood will soon be on his so oddly lighted conscience.  At\ntimes, his better hope seemed to lie in picking a quarrel and killing\nat least in fair fight, one of these two stupid dumb animals; with\nrude ill-suppressed laughter one day, as they overhear Colomba’s\nviolent utterances at a funeral feast, for she is a renowned\nimprovisatrice.  “Your father is an old man,” he finds himself\nsaying, “I could crush with my hands.  ’Tis for you I am destined,\nfor you and your brother!”  And if it is by course of nature that the\nold man dies not long after the murder of these sons (self-provoked\nafter all), dies a fugitive at Pisa, as it happens, by an odd\naccident, in the presence of Colomba, no violent death by Orso’s own\nhand could have been more to her mind.  In that last hard page of\nMerimee’s story, mere dramatic propriety itself for a moment seems to\nplead for the forgiveness, which from Joseph and his brethren to the\npresent day, as we know, has been as winning in story as in actual\nlife.  Such dramatic propriety, however, was by no means [27] in\nMerimee’s way.  “What I must have is the hand that fired the shot,\"\nshe had sung, “the eye that guided it; aye! and the mind moreover–\nthe mind, which had conceived the deed!”  And now, it is in idiotic\nterror, a fugitive from Orso’s vengeance, that the last of the\nBarricini is dying.",
        "Exaggerated art! you think.  But it was precisely such exaggerated\nart, intense, unrelieved, an art of fierce colours, that is needed by\nthose who are seeking in art, as I said of Merimee, a kind of\nartificial stimulus.  And if his style is still impeccably correct,\ncold-blooded, impersonal, as impersonal as that of Scott himself, it\ndoes but conduce the better to his one exclusive aim.  It is like the\npolish of the stiletto Colomba carried always under her mantle, or\nthe beauty of the fire-arms, that beauty coming of nice adaptation to\npurpose, which she understood so well–a task characteristic also of\nMerimee himself, a sort of fanatic joy in the perfect pistol-shot, at\nits height in the singular story he has translated from the Russian\nof Pouchkine.  Those raw colours he preferred; Spanish, Oriental,\nAfrican, perhaps, irritant certainly to cisalpine eyes, he\nundoubtedly attained the colouring you associate with sun-stroke,\nonly possible under a sun in which dead things rot quickly.",
        "Pity and terror, we know, go to the making of the essential tragic\nsense.  In Merimee, certainly, we have all its terror, but without\nthe [28] pity.  Saint-Clair, the consent of his mistress barely\nattained at last, rushes madly on self-destruction, that he may die\nwith the taste of his great love fresh on his lips.  All the\ngrotesque accidents of violent death he records with visual\nexactness, and no pains to relieve them; the ironic indifference, for\ninstance, with which, on the scaffold or the battle-field, a man will\nseem to grin foolishly at the ugly rents through which his life has\npassed.  Seldom or never has the mere pen of a writer taken us so\nclose to the cannon’s mouth as in the Taking of the Redoubt, while\nMatteo Falcone–twenty-five short pages–is perhaps the cruellest\nstory in the world.",
        "Colomba, that strange, fanatic being, who has a code of action, of\nself-respect, a conscience, all to herself, who with all her virginal\ncharm only does not make you hate her, is, in truth, the type of a\nsort of humanity Merimee found it pleasant to dream of–a humanity as\nalien as the animals, with whose moral affinities to man his\nimaginative work is often directly concerned.  Were they so alien,\nafter all?  Were there not survivals of the old wild creatures in the\ngentlest, the politest of us?  Stories that told of sudden freaks of\ngentle, polite natures, straight back, not into Paradise, were always\nwelcome to men’s fancies; and that could only be because they found a\npsychologic truth in them.  With much success, with a credibility\ninsured by his literary tact, Merimee tried his own hand at such\nstories: unfrocked the [29] bear in the amorous young Lithuanian\nnoble, the wolf in the revolting peasant of the Middle Age.  There\nwere survivals surely in himself, in that stealthy presentment of his\nfavourite themes, in his own art.  You seem to find your hand on a\nserpent, in reading him.",
        "In such survivals, indeed, you see the operation of his favourite\nmotive, the sense of wild power, under a sort of mask, or assumed\nhabit, realised as the very genius of nature itself; and that\ninterest, with some superstitions closely allied to it, the belief in\nthe vampire, for instance, is evidenced especially in certain\npretended Illyrian compositions–prose translations, the reader was\nto understand, of more or less ancient popular ballads; La Guzla, he\ncalled the volume, The Lyre, as we might say; only that the\ninstrument of the Illyrian minstrel had but one string.  Artistic\ndeception, a trick of which there is something in the historic\nromance as such, in a book like his own Chronicle of Charles the\nNinth, was always welcome to Merimee; it was part of the machinery of\nhis rooted habit of intellectual reserve.  A master of irony also, in\nMadame Lucrezia he seems to wish to expose his own method cynically;\nto explain his art–how he takes you in–as a clever, confident\nconjuror might do.  So properly were the readers of La Guzla taken in\nthat he followed up his success in that line by the Theatre of Clara\nGazul, purporting to be from a rare Spanish original, the work [30]\nof a nun, who, under tame, conventual reading, had felt the touch of\nmundane, of physical passions; had become a dramatic poet, and\nherself a powerful actress.  It may dawn on you in reading her that\nMerimee was a kind of Webster, but with the superficial mildness of\nour nineteenth century.  At the bottom of the true drama there is\never, logically at least, the ballad: the ballad dealing in a kind of\nshort-hand (or, say! in grand, simple, universal outlines) with those\npassions, crimes, mistakes, which have a kind of fatality in them, a\nkind of necessity to come to the surface of the human mind, if not to\nthe surface of our experience, as in the case of some frankly\nsupernatural incidents which Merimee re-handled.  Whether human love\nor hatred has had most to do in shaping the universal fancy that the\ndead come back, I cannot say.  Certainly that old ballad literature\nhas instances in plenty, in which the voice, the hand, the brief\nvisit from the grave, is a natural response to the cry of the human\ncreature.  That ghosts should return, as they do so often in\nMerimee’s fiction, is but a sort of natural justice.  Only, in\nMerimee’s prose ballads, in those admirable, short, ballad-like\nstories, where every word tells, of which he was a master, almost the\ninventor, they are a kind of half-material ghosts–a vampire tribe–\nand never come to do people good; congruously with the mental\nconstitution of the writer, which, alike in fact and fiction, [31]\ncould hardly have horror enough–theme after theme.  Merimee himself\nemphasises this almost constant motive of his fiction when he adds to\none of his volumes of short stories some letters on a matter of fact-\n-a Spanish bull-fight, in which those old Romans, he regretted, might\nseem, decadently, to have survived.  It is as if you saw it.  In\ntruth, Merimee was the unconscious parent of much we may think of\ndubious significance in later French literature.  It is as if there\nwere nothing to tell of in this world but various forms of hatred,\nand a love that is like lunacy; and the only other world, a world of\nmaliciously active, hideous, dead bodies.",
        "Merimee, a literary artist, was not a man who used two words where\none would do better, and he shines especially in those brief\ncompositions which, like a minute intaglio, reveal at a glance his\nwonderful faculty of design and proportion in the treatment of his\nwork, in which there is not a touch but counts.  That is an art of\nwhich there are few examples in English; our somewhat diffuse, or\nslipshod, literary language hardly lending itself to the\nconcentration of thought and expression, which are of the essence of\nsuch writing.  It is otherwise in French, and if you wish to know\nwhat art of that kind can come to, read Merimee’s little romances;\nbest of all, perhaps, La Venus d’Ille and Arsene Guillot.  The former\nis a modern version of the beautiful old story of the Ring given to\nVenus, given to her, in [32] this case, by a somewhat sordid creature\nof the nineteenth century, whom she looks on with more than disdain.\nThe strange outline of the Canigou, one of the most imposing outlying\nheights of the Pyrenees, down the mysterious slopes of which the\ntraveller has made his way towards nightfall into the great plain of\nToulouse, forms an impressive background, congruous with the many\nrelics of irrepressible old paganism there, but in entire contrast to\nthe bourgeois comfort of the place where his journey is to end, the\nabode of an aged antiquary, loud and bright just now with the\ncelebration of a vulgar worldly marriage.  In the midst of this well-\nbeing, prosaic in spite of the neighbourhood, in spite of the pretty\nold wedding customs, morsels of that local colour in which Merimee\ndelights, the old pagan powers are supposed to reveal themselves once\nmore (malignantly, of course), in the person of a magnificent bronze\nstatue of Venus recently unearthed in the antiquary’s garden.  On her\nfinger, by ill-luck, the coarse young bridegroom on the morning of\nhis marriage places for a moment the bridal ring only too effectually\n(the bronze hand closes, like a wilful living one, upon it), and\ndies, you are to understand, in her angry metallic embraces on his\nmarriage night.  From the first, indeed, she had seemed bent on\ncrushing out men’s degenerate bodies and souls, though the\nsupernatural horror of the tale is adroitly made credible by a\ncertain vagueness in the [33] events, which covers a quite natural\naccount of the bridegroom’s mysterious death.",
        "The intellectual charm of literary work so thoroughly designed as\nMerimee’s depends in part on the sense as you read, hastily perhaps,\nperhaps in need of patience, that you are dealing with a composition,\nthe full secret of which is only to be attained in the last\nparagraph, that with the last word in mind you will retrace your\nsteps, more than once (it may be) noting then the minuter structure,\nalso the natural or wrought flowers by the way.  Nowhere is such\nmethod better illustrated than by another of Merimee’s quintessential\npieces, Arsene Guillotand here for once with a conclusion ethically\nacceptable also.  Merimee loved surprises in human nature, but it is\nnot often that he surprises us by tenderness or generosity of\ncharacter, as another master of French fiction, M. Octave Feuillet,\nis apt to do; and the simple pathos of Arsene Guillot gives it a\nunique place in Merimee’s writings.  It may be said, indeed, that\nonly an essentially pitiful nature could have told the exquisitely\ncruel story of Matteo Falcone precisely as Merimee has told it; and\nthose who knew him testify abundantly to his own capacity for\ngenerous friendship.  He was no more wanting than others in those\nnatural sympathies (sending tears to the eyes at the sight of\nsuffering age or childhood) which happily are no extraordinary\ncomponent in men’s natures.  It was, perhaps, no fitting return for a\n[34] friendship of over thirty years to publish posthumously those\nLettres a une Inconnue, which reveal that reserved, sensitive, self-\ncentred nature, a little pusillanimously in the power, at the\ndisposition of another.  For just there lies the interest, the\npsychological interest, of those letters.  An amateur of power, of\nthe spectacle of power and force, followed minutely but without\nsensibility on his part, with a kind of cynic pride rather for the\nmainspring of his method, both of thought and expression, you find\nhim here taken by surprise at last, and somewhat humbled, by an\nunsuspected force of affection in himself.  His correspondent,\nunknown but for these letters except just by name, figures in them\nas, in truth, a being only too much like himself, seen from one side;\nreflects his taciturnity, his touchiness, his incredulity except for\nself-torment.  Agitated, dissatisfied, he is wrestling in her with\nhimself, his own difficult qualities.  He demands from her a freedom,\na frankness, he would have been the last to grant.  It is by first\nthoughts, of course, that what is forcible and effective in human\nnature, the force, therefore, of carnal love, discovers itself; and\nfor her first thoughts Merimee is always pleading, but always\ncomplaining that he gets only her second thoughts; the thoughts, that\nis, of a reserved, self-limiting nature, well under the yoke of\nconvention, like his own.  Strange conjunction!  At the beginning of\nthe correspondence he seems to have been [35] seeking only a fine\nintellectual companionship; the lady, perhaps, looking for something\nwarmer.  Towards such companionship that likeness to himself in her\nmight have been helpful, but was not enough of a complement to his\nown nature to be anything but an obstruction in love; and it is to\nthat, little by little, that his humour turns.  He–the\nMegalopsychus, as Aristotle defines him–acquires all the lover’s\nhumble habits: himself displays all the tricks of love, its\ncasuistries, its exigency, its superstitions, aye! even its\nvulgarities; involves with the significance of his own genius the\nmere hazards and inconsequence of a perhaps average nature; but too\nlate in the day–the years.  After the attractions and repulsions of\nhalf a lifetime, they are but friends, and might forget to be that,\nbut for his death, clearly presaged in his last weak, touching\nletter, just two hours before.  There, too, had been the blind and\nnaked force of nature and circumstance, surprising him in the\nuncontrollable movements of his own so carefully guarded heart.",
        "The intimacy, the effusion, the so freely exposed personality of\nthose letters does but emphasise the fact that impersonality was, in\nliterary art, Merimee’s central aim.  Personality versus\nimpersonality in art:–how much or how little of one’s self one may\nput into one’s work: whether anything at all of it: whether one can\nput there anything else:–is clearly a far-reaching and complex\nquestion.  Serviceable as [36] the basis of a precautionary maxim\ntowards the conduct of our work, self-effacement, or impersonality,\nin literary or artistic creation, is, perhaps, after all, as little\npossible as a strict realism.  “It has always been my rule to put\nnothing of myself into my works,” says another great master of French\nprose, Gustave Flaubert; but, luckily as we may think, he often\nfailed in thus effacing himself, as he too was aware.  “It has always\nbeen my rule to put nothing of myself into my works” (to be\ndisinterested in his literary creations, so to speak), “yet I have\nput much of myself into them”: and where he failed Merimee succeeded.\nThere they stand–Carmen, Colomba, the “False” Demetrius–as detached\nfrom him as from each other, with no more filial likeness to their\nmaker than if they were the work of another person.  And to his\nmethod of conception, Merimee’s much-praised literary style, his\nmethod of expression, is strictly conformable–impersonal in its\nbeauty, the perfection of nobody’s style–thus vindicating anew by\nits very impersonality that much worn, but not untrue saying, that\nthe style is the man:–a man, impassible, unfamiliar, impeccable,\nveiling a deep sense of what is forcible, nay, terrible, in things,\nunder the sort of personal pride that makes a man a nice observer of\nall that is most conventional.  Essentially unlike other people, he\nis always fastidiously in the fashion–an expert in all the little,\nhalf- [37] contemptuous elegances of which it is capable.  Merimee’s\nsuperb self-effacement, his impersonality, is itself but an effective\npersonal trait, and, transferred to art, becomes a markedly peculiar\nquality of literary beauty.  For, in truth, this creature of\ndisillusion who had no care for half-lights, and, like his creations,\nhad no atmosphere about him, gifted as he was with pure mind, with\nthe quality which secures flawless literary structure, had, on the\nother hand, nothing of what we call soul in literature:–hence, also,\nthat singular harshness in his ideal, as if, in theological language,\nhe were incapable of grace.  He has none of those subjectivities,\ncolourings, peculiarities of mental refraction, which necessitate\nvarieties of style–could we spare such?–and render the perfections\nof it no merely negative qualities.  There are masters of French\nprose whose art has begun where the art of Merimee leaves off.",
