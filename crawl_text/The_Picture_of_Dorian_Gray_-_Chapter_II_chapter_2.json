        "As they entered they saw Dorian Gray.  He was seated at the\npiano, with his back to them, turning over the pages of a volume of\nSchumann’s “Forest Scenes.”  “You must lend me these, Basil,” he\ncried.  “I want to learn them.  They are perfectly charming.”",
        "“That entirely depends on how you sit to-day, Dorian.”",
        "“Oh, I am tired of sitting, and I don’t want a life-sized portrait of\nmyself,” answered the lad, swinging round on the music-stool, in a\nwilful, petulant manner.  When he caught sight of Lord Henry, a faint\nblush colored his cheeks for a moment, and he started up.  “I beg\nyour pardon, Basil, but I didn’t know you had any one with you.”",
        "“This is Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian, an old Oxford friend of mine.  I\nhave just been telling him what a capital sitter you were, and now\nyou have spoiled everything.”",
        "“You have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you, Mr. Gray,” said\nLord Henry, stepping forward and shaking him by the hand.  “My aunt\nhas often spoken to me about you.  You are one of her favorites, and,\nI am afraid, one of her victims also.”",
        "“I am in Lady Agatha’s black books at present,” answered Dorian, with\na funny look of penitence.  “I promised to go to her club in\nWhitechapel with her last Tuesday, and I really forgot all about it.\nWe were to have played a duet together,–three duets, I believe.  I\ndon’t know what she will say to me.  I am far too frightened to\ncall.”",
        "“Oh, I will make your peace with my aunt.  She is quite devoted to\nyou.  And I don’t think it really matters about your not being there.\nThe audience probably thought it was a duet.  When Aunt Agatha sits\ndown to the piano she makes quite enough noise for two people.”",
        "“That is very horrid to her, and not very nice to me,” answered\nDorian, laughing.",
        "Lord Henry looked at him.  Yes, he was certainly wonderfully\nhandsome, with his finely-curved scarlet lips, his frank blue eyes,\nhis crisp gold hair.  There was something in his face that made one\ntrust him at once.  All the candor of youth was there, as well as all\nyouth’s passionate purity.  One felt that he had kept himself\nunspotted from the world.  No wonder Basil Hallward worshipped him.\nHe was made to be worshipped.",
        "“You are too charming to go in for philanthropy, Mr. Gray,–far too\ncharming.”  And Lord Henry flung himself down on the divan, and\nopened his cigarette-case.",
        "Hallward had been busy mixing his colors and getting his brushes\nready.  He was looking worried, and when he heard Lord Henry’s last\n[13] remark he glanced at him, hesitated for a moment, and then said,\n“Harry, I want to finish this picture to-day.  Would you think it\nawfully rude of me if I asked you to go away?”",
        "Lord Henry smiled, and looked at Dorian Gray.  “Am I to go, Mr.\nGray?” he asked.",
        "“Oh, please don’t, Lord Henry.  I see that Basil is in one of his\nsulky moods; and I can’t bear him when he sulks.  Besides, I want you\nto tell me why I should not go in for philanthropy.”",
        "“I don’t know that I shall tell you that, Mr. Gray.  But I certainly\nwill not run away, now that you have asked me to stop.  You don’t\nreally mind, Basil, do you?  You have often told me that you liked\nyour sitters to have some one to chat to.”",
        "Hallward bit his lip.  “If Dorian wishes it, of course you must stay.\nDorian’s whims are laws to everybody, except himself.”",
        "Lord Henry took up his hat and gloves.  “You are very pressing,\nBasil, but I am afraid I must go.  I have promised to meet a man at\nthe Orleans.–Good-by, Mr.  Gray.  Come and see me some afternoon in\nCurzon Street.  I am nearly always at home at five o’clock.  Write to\nme when you are coming.  I should be sorry to miss you.”",
        "“Basil,” cried Dorian Gray, “if Lord Henry goes I shall go too.  You\nnever open your lips while you are painting, and it is horribly dull\nstanding on a platform and trying to look pleasant.  Ask him to stay.\nI insist upon it.”",
        "“Stay, Harry, to oblige Dorian, and to oblige me,” said Hallward,\ngazing intently at his picture.  “It is quite true, I never talk when\nI am working, and never listen either, and it must be dreadfully\ntedious for my unfortunate sitters.  I beg you to stay.”",
        "“But what about my man at the Orleans?”",
        "Hallward laughed.  “I don’t think there will be any difficulty about\nthat.  Sit down again, Harry.–And now, Dorian, get up on the\nplatform, and don’t move about too much, or pay any attention to what\nLord Henry says.  He has a very bad influence over all his friends,\nwith the exception of myself.”",
        "Dorian stepped up on the dais, with the air of a young Greek martyr,\nand made a little moue of discontent to Lord Henry, to whom he had\nrather taken a fancy.  He was so unlike Hallward.  They made a\ndelightful contrast.  And he had such a beautiful voice.  After a few\nmoments he said to him, “Have you really a very bad influence, Lord\nHenry?  As bad as Basil says?”",
        "“There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray.  All influence\nis immoral,–immoral from the scientific point of view.”",
        "“Why?”",
        "“Because to influence a person is to give him one’s own soul.  He\ndoes not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural\npassions.  His virtues are not real to him.  His sins, if there are\nsuch things as sins, are borrowed.  He becomes an echo of some one\nelse’s music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him.\nThe aim of life is self-development.  To realize one’s nature\nperfectly,–that is what each of us is here for.  People are afraid\nof themselves, nowadays.  They have forgotten the highest of all\nduties, the duty that one owes to one’s [14] self.  Of course they\nare charitable.  They feed the hungry, and clothe the beggar.  But\ntheir own souls starve, and are naked.  Courage has gone out of our\nrace.  Perhaps we never really had it.  The terror of society, which\nis the basis of morals, the terror of God, which is the secret of\nreligion,–these are the two things that govern us.  And yet–”",
        "“Just turn your head a little more to the right, Dorian, like a good\nboy,” said Hallward, deep in his work, and conscious only that a look\nhad come into the lad’s face that he had never seen there before.",
        "“And yet,” continued Lord Henry, in his low, musical voice, and with\nthat graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of\nhim, and that he had even in his Eton days, “I believe that if one\nman were to live his life out fully and completely, were to give form\nto every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every\ndream,–I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of\njoy that we would forget all the maladies of mediaevalism, and return\nto the Hellenic ideal,– to something finer, richer, than the\nHellenic ideal, it may be.  But the bravest man among us is afraid of\nhimself.  The mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the\nself-denial that mars our lives.  We are punished for our refusals.\nEvery impulse that we strive to strangle broods in the mind, and\npoisons us.  The body sins once, and has done with its sin, for\naction is a mode of purification.  Nothing remains then but the\nrecollection of a pleasure, or the luxury of a regret.  The only way\nto get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.  Resist it, and your\nsoul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to\nitself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous\nand unlawful.  It has been said that the great events of the world\ntake place in the brain.  It is in the brain, and the brain only,\nthat the great sins of the world take place also.  You, Mr. Gray, you\nyourself, with your rose-red youth and your rose-white boyhood, you\nhave had passions that have made you afraid, thoughts that have\nfilled you with terror, day-dreams and sleeping dreams whose mere\nmemory might stain your cheek with shame–”",
        "“Stop!” murmured Dorian Gray, “stop! you bewilder me.  I don’t know\nwhat to say.  There is some answer to you, but I cannot find it.\nDon’t speak.  Let me think, or, rather, let me try not to think.”",
        "For nearly ten minutes he stood there motionless, with parted lips,\nand eyes strangely bright.  He was dimly conscious that entirely\nfresh impulses were at work within him, and they seemed to him to\nhave come really from himself.  The few words that Basil’s friend had\nsaid to him–words spoken by chance, no doubt, and with wilful\nparadox in them–had yet touched some secret chord, that had never\nbeen touched before, but that he felt was now vibrating and throbbing\nto curious pulses.",
        "Music had stirred him like that.  Music had troubled him many times.\nBut music was not articulate.  It was not a new world, but rather a\nnew chaos, that it created in us.  Words!  Mere words!  How terrible\nthey were!  How clear, and vivid, and cruel!  One could not escape\nfrom them.  And yet what a subtle magic there was in them! [15] They\nseemed to be able to give a plastic form to formless things, and to\nhave a music of their own as sweet as that of viol or of lute.  Mere\nwords!  Was there anything so real as words?",
        "Yes; there had been things in his boyhood that he had not understood.\nHe understood them now.  Life suddenly became fiery-colored to him.\nIt seemed to him that he had been walking in fire.  Why had he not\nknown it?",
        "Lord Henry watched him, with his sad smile.  He knew the precise\npsychological moment when to say nothing.  He felt intensely\ninterested.  He was amazed at the sudden impression that his words\nhad produced, and, remembering a book that he had read when he was\nsixteen, which had revealed to him much that he had not known before,\nhe wondered whether Dorian Gray was passing through the same\nexperience.  He had merely shot an arrow into the air.  Had it hit\nthe mark?  How fascinating the lad was!",
        "Hallward painted away with that marvellous bold touch of his, that\nhad the true refinement and perfect delicacy that come only from\nstrength.  He was unconscious of the silence.",
        "“Basil, I am tired of standing,” cried Dorian Gray, suddenly.  “I\nmust go out and sit in the garden.  The air is stifling here.”",
        "“My dear fellow, I am so sorry.  When I am painting, I can’t think of\nanything else.  But you never sat better.  You were perfectly still.\nAnd I have caught the effect I wanted,–the half-parted lips, and the\nbright look in the eyes.  I don’t know what Harry has been saying to\nyou, but he has certainly made you have the most wonderful\nexpression.  I suppose he has been paying you compliments.  You\nmustn’t believe a word that he says.”",
        "“He has certainly not been paying me compliments.  Perhaps that is\nthe reason I don’t think I believe anything he has told me.”",
        "“You know you believe it all,” said Lord Henry, looking at him with\nhis dreamy, heavy-lidded eyes.  “I will go out to the garden with\nyou.  It is horridly hot in the studio.–Basil, let us have something\niced to drink, something with strawberries in it.”",
        "“Certainly, Harry.  Just touch the bell, and when Parker comes I will\ntell him what you want.  I have got to work up this background, so I\nwill join you later on.  Don’t keep Dorian too long.  I have never\nbeen in better form for painting than I am to-day.  This is going to\nbe my masterpiece.  It is my masterpiece as it stands.”",
        "Lord Henry went out to the garden, and found Dorian Gray burying his\nface in the great cool lilac-blossoms, feverishly drinking in their\nperfume as if it had been wine.  He came close to him, and put his\nhand upon his shoulder.  “You are quite right to do that,” he\nmurmured.  “Nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing\ncan cure the senses but the soul.”",
        "The lad started and drew back.  He was bareheaded, and the leaves had\ntossed his rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads.\nThere was a look of fear in his eyes, such as people have when they\nare suddenly awakened.  His finely-chiselled nostrils quivered, and\nsome hidden nerve shook the scarlet of his lips and left them\ntrembling.",
        "[16] “Yes,” continued Lord Henry, “that is one of the great secrets\nof life,– to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by\nmeans of the soul.  You are a wonderful creature.  You know more than\nyou think you know, just as you know less than you want to know.”",
        "Dorian Gray frowned and turned his head away.  He could not help\nliking the tall, graceful young man who was standing by him.  His\nromantic olive-colored face and worn expression interested him.\nThere was something in his low, languid voice that was absolutely\nfascinating.  His cool, white, flower-like hands, even, had a curious\ncharm.  They moved, as he spoke, like music, and seemed to have a\nlanguage of their own.  But he felt afraid of him, and ashamed of\nbeing afraid.  Why had it been left for a stranger to reveal him to\nhimself?  He had known Basil Hallward for months, but the friendship\nbetween then had never altered him.  Suddenly there had come some one\nacross his life who seemed to have disclosed to him life’s mystery.\nAnd, yet, what was there to be afraid of?  He was not a school-boy,\nor a girl.  It was absurd to be frightened.",
        "“Let us go and sit in the shade,” said Lord Henry.  “Parker has\nbrought out the drinks, and if you stay any longer in this glare you\nwill be quite spoiled, and Basil will never paint you again.  You\nreally must not let yourself become sunburnt.  It would be very\nunbecoming to you.”",
        "“What does it matter?” cried Dorian, laughing, as he sat down on the\nseat at the end of the garden.",
        "“It should matter everything to you, Mr. Gray.”",
        "“Why?”",
        "“Because you have now the most marvellous youth, and youth is the one\nthing worth having.”",
        "“I don’t feel that, Lord Henry.”",
        "“No, you don’t feel it now.  Some day, when you are old and wrinkled\nand ugly, when thought has seared your forehead with its lines, and\npassion branded your lips with its hideous fires, you will feel it,\nyou will feel it terribly.  Now, wherever you go, you charm the\nworld.  Will it always be so?",
        "“You have a wonderfully beautiful face, Mr. Gray.  Don’t frown.  You\nhave.  And Beauty is a form of Genius,–is higher, indeed, than\nGenius, as it needs no explanation.  It is one of the great facts of\nthe world, like sunlight, or spring-time, or the reflection in dark\nwaters of that silver shell we call the moon.  It cannot be\nquestioned.  It has its divine right of sovereignty.  It makes\nprinces of those who have it.  You smile?  Ah! when you have lost it\nyou won’t smile.",
        "“People say sometimes that Beauty is only superficial.  That may be\nso.  But at least it is not so superficial as Thought.  To me, Beauty\nis the wonder of wonders.  It is only shallow people who do not judge\nby appearances.  The true mystery of the world is the visible, not\nthe invisible.",
        "“Yes, Mr. Gray, the gods have been good to you.  But what the gods\ngive they quickly take away.  You have only a few years in which\nreally to live.  When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it,\nand then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left\n[17] for you, or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs\nthat the memory of your past will make more bitter than defeats.\nEvery month as it wanes brings you nearer to something dreadful.\nTime is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your roses.\nYou will become sallow, and hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed.  You will\nsuffer horribly.",
        "“Realize your youth while you have it.  Don’t squander the gold of\nyour days, listening to the tedious, trying to improve the hopeless\nfailure, or giving away your life to the ignorant, the common, and\nthe vulgar, which are the aims, the false ideals, of our age.  Live!\nLive the wonderful life that is in you!  Let nothing be lost upon\nyou.  Be always searching for new sensations.  Be afraid of nothing.",
        "“A new hedonism,–that is what our century wants.  You might be its\nvisible symbol.  With your personality there is nothing you could not\ndo.  The world belongs to you for a season.",
        "“The moment I met you I saw that you were quite unconscious of what\nyou really are, what you really might be.  There was so much about\nyou that charmed me that I felt I must tell you something about\nyourself.  I thought how tragic it would be if you were wasted.  For\nthere is such a little time that your youth will last,–such a little\ntime.",
        "“The common hill-flowers wither, but they blossom again.  The\nlaburnum will be as golden next June as it is now.  In a month there\nwill be purple stars on the clematis, and year after year the green\nnight of its leaves will have its purple stars.  But we never get\nback our youth.  The pulse of joy that beats in us at twenty, becomes\nsluggish.  Our limbs fail, our senses rot.  We degenerate into\nhideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the passions of which we\nwere too much afraid, and the exquisite temptations that we did not\ndare to yield to.  Youth!  Youth!  There is absolutely nothing in the\nworld but youth!”",
        "Dorian Gray listened, open-eyed and wondering.  The spray of lilac\nfell from his hand upon the gravel.  A furry bee came and buzzed\nround it for a moment.  Then it began to scramble all over the\nfretted purple of the tiny blossoms.  He watched it with that strange\ninterest in trivial things that we try to develop when things of high\nimport make us afraid, or when we are stirred by some new emotion,\nfor which we cannot find expression, or when some thought that\nterrifies us lays sudden siege to the brain and calls on us to yield.\nAfter a time it flew away.  He saw it creeping into the stained\ntrumpet of a Tyrian convolvulus.  The flower seemed to quiver, and\nthen swayed gently to and fro.",
        "Suddenly Hallward appeared at the door of the studio, and made\nfrantic signs for them to come in.  They turned to each other, and\nsmiled.",
        "“I am waiting,” cried Hallward.  “Do come in.  The light is quite\nperfect, and you can bring your drinks.”",
        "They rose up, and sauntered down the walk together.  Two green-and-\nwhite butterflies fluttered past them, and in the pear-tree at the\nend of the garden a thrush began to sing.",
        "“You are glad you have met me, Mr. Gray,” said Lord Henry, looking at\nhim.",
        "“Yes, I am glad now.  I wonder shall I always be glad?”",
        "[18] “Always!  That is a dreadful word.  It makes me shudder when I\nhear it.  Women are so fond of using it.  They spoil every romance by\ntrying to make it last forever.  It is a meaningless word, too.  The\nonly difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the\ncaprice lasts a little longer.”",
        "As they entered the studio, Dorian Gray put his hand upon Lord\nHenry’s arm.  “In that case, let our friendship be a caprice,” he\nmurmured, flushing at his own boldness, then stepped upon the\nplatform and resumed his pose.",
        "Lord Henry flung himself into a large wicker arm-chair, and watched\nhim.  The sweep and dash of the brush on the canvas made the only\nsound that broke the stillness, except when Hallward stepped back now\nand then to look at his work from a distance.  In the slanting beams\nthat streamed through the open door-way the dust danced and was\ngolden.  The heavy scent of the roses seemed to brood over\neverything.",
        "After about a quarter of an hour, Hallward stopped painting, looked\nfor a long time at Dorian Gray, and then for a long time at the\npicture, biting the end of one of his huge brushes, and smiling.  “It\nis quite finished,” he cried, at last, and stooping down he wrote his\nname in thin vermilion letters on the left-hand corner of the canvas.",
        "Lord Henry came over and examined the picture.  It was certainly a\nwonderful work of art, and a wonderful likeness as well.",
        "“My dear fellow, I congratulate you most warmly,” he said.–\"Mr.\nGray, come and look at yourself.”",
        "The lad started, as if awakened from some dream.  “Is it really\nfinished?” he murmured, stepping down from the platform.",
        "“Quite finished,” said Hallward.  “And you have sat splendidly to-\nday.  I am awfully obliged to you.”",
        "“That is entirely due to me,” broke in Lord Henry.  “Isn’t it, Mr.\nGray?”",
        "Dorian made no answer, but passed listlessly in front of his picture\nand turned towards it.  When he saw it he drew back, and his cheeks\nflushed for a moment with pleasure.  A look of joy came into his\neyes, as if he had recognized himself for the first time.  He stood\nthere motionless, and in wonder, dimly conscious that Hallward was\nspeaking to him, but not catching the meaning of his words.  The\nsense of his own beauty came on him like a revelation.  He had never\nfelt it before.  Basil Hallward’s compliments had seemed to him to be\nmerely the charming exaggerations of friendship.  He had listened to\nthem, laughed at them, forgotten them.  They had not influenced his\nnature.  Then had come Lord Henry, with his strange panegyric on\nyouth, his terrible warning of its brevity.  That had stirred him at\nthe time, and now, as he stood gazing at the shadow of his own\nloveliness, the full reality of the description flashed across him.\nYes, there would be a day when his face would be wrinkled and wizen,\nhis eyes dim and colorless, the grace of his figure broken and\ndeformed.  The scarlet would pass away from his lips, and the gold\nsteal from his hair.  The life that was to make his soul would mar\nhis body.  He would become ignoble, hideous, and uncouth.",
        "[19] As he thought of it, a sharp pang of pain struck like a knife\nacross him, and made each delicate fibre of his nature quiver.  His\neyes deepened into amethyst, and a mist of tears came across them.\nHe felt as if a hand of ice had been laid upon his heart.",
        "“Don’t you like it?” cried Hallward at last, stung a little by the\nlad’s silence, and not understanding what it meant.",
        "“Of course he likes it,” said Lord Henry.  “Who wouldn’t like it?  It\nis one of the greatest things in modern art.  I will give you\nanything you like to ask for it.  I must have it.”",
        "“It is not my property, Harry.”",
        "“Whose property is it?”",
        "“Dorian’s, of course.”",
        "“He is a very lucky fellow.”",
        "“How sad it is!” murmured Dorian Gray, with his eyes still fixed upon\nhis own portrait.  “How sad it is!  I shall grow old, and horrid, and\ndreadful.  But this picture will remain always young.  It will never\nbe older than this particular day of June. . . . If it was only the\nother way!  If it was I who were to be always young, and the picture\nthat were to grow old!  For this–for this–I would give everything!\nYes, there is nothing in the whole world I would not give!”",
        "“You would hardly care for that arrangement, Basil,” cried Lord\nHenry, laughing.  “It would be rather hard lines on you.”",
        "“I should object very strongly, Harry.”",
        "Dorian Gray turned and looked at him.  “I believe you would, Basil.\nYou like your art better than your friends.  I am no more to you than\na green bronze figure.  Hardly as much, I dare say.”",
        "Hallward stared in amazement.  It was so unlike Dorian to speak like\nthat.  What had happened?  He seemed almost angry.  His face was\nflushed and his cheeks burning.",
        "“Yes,” he continued, “I am less to you than your ivory Hermes or your\nsilver Faun.  You will like them always.  How long will you like me?\nTill I have my first wrinkle, I suppose.  I know, now, that when one\nloses one’s good looks, whatever they may be, one loses everything.\nYour picture has taught me that.  Lord Henry is perfectly right.\nYouth is the only thing worth having.  When I find that I am growing\nold, I will kill myself.”",
        "Hallward turned pale, and caught his hand.  “Dorian!  Dorian!” he\ncried, “don’t talk like that.  I have never had such a friend as you,\nand I shall never have such another.  You are not jealous of material\nthings, are you?”",
        "“I am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die.  I am jealous\nof the portrait you have painted of me.  Why should it keep what I\nmust lose?  Every moment that passes takes something from me, and\ngives something to it.  Oh, if it was only the other way!  If the\npicture could change, and I could be always what I am now!  Why did\nyou paint it?  It will mock me some day,–mock me horribly!”  The hot\ntears welled into his eyes; he tore his hand away, and, flinging\nhimself on the divan, he buried his face in the cushions, as if he\nwas praying.",
        "“This is your doing, Harry,” said Hallward, bitterly.",
        "[20] “My doing?”",
        "“Yes, yours, and you know it.”",
        "Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders.  “It is the real Dorian Gray,–\nthat is all,” he answered.",
        "“It is not.”",
        "“If it is not, what have I to do with it?”",
        "“You should have gone away when I asked you.”",
        "“I stayed when you asked me.”",
        "“Harry, I can’t quarrel with my two best friends at once, but between\nyou both you have made me hate the finest piece of work I have ever\ndone, and I will destroy it.  What is it but canvas and color?  I\nwill not let it come across our three lives and mar them.”",
        "Dorian Gray lifted his golden head from the pillow, and looked at him\nwith pallid face and tear-stained eyes, as he walked over to the deal\npainting-table that was set beneath the large curtained window.  What\nwas he doing there?  His fingers were straying about among the litter\nof tin tubes and dry brushes, seeking for something.  Yes, it was the\nlong palette-knife, with its thin blade of lithe steel.  He had found\nit at last.  He was going to rip up the canvas.",
        "With a stifled sob he leaped from the couch, and, rushing over to\nHallward, tore the knife out of his hand, and flung it to the end of\nthe studio.  “Don’t, Basil, don’t!” he cried.  “It would be murder!”",
        "“I am glad you appreciate my work at last, Dorian,” said Hallward,\ncoldly, when he had recovered from his surprise.  “I never thought\nyou would.”",
        "“Appreciate it?  I am in love with it, Basil.  It is part of myself,\nI feel that.”",
        "“Well, as soon as you are dry, you shall be varnished, and framed,\nand sent home.  Then you can do what you like with yourself.”  And he\nwalked across the room and rang the bell for tea.  “You will have\ntea, of course, Dorian?  And so will you, Harry?  Tea is the only\nsimple pleasure left to us.”",
        "“I don’t like simple pleasures,” said Lord Henry.  “And I don’t like\nscenes, except on the stage.  What absurd fellows you are, both of\nyou!  I wonder who it was defined man as a rational animal.  It was\nthe most premature definition ever given.  Man is many things, but he\nis not rational.  I am glad he is not, after all: though I wish you\nchaps would not squabble over the picture.  You had much better let\nme have it, Basil.  This silly boy doesn’t really want it, and I do.”",
        "“If you let any one have it but me, Basil, I will never forgive you!\"\ncried Dorian Gray.  “And I don’t allow people to call me a silly\nboy.”",
        "“You know the picture is yours, Dorian.  I gave it to you before it\nexisted.”",
        "“And you know you have been a little silly, Mr. Gray, and that you\ndon’t really mind being called a boy.”",
        "“I should have minded very much this morning, Lord Henry.”",
        "“Ah! this morning!  You have lived since then.”",
        "There came a knock to the door, and the butler entered with the tea-\ntray and set it down upon a small Japanese table.  There was a [21]\nrattle of cups and saucers and the hissing of a fluted Georgian urn.\nTwo globe-shaped china dishes were brought in by a page.  Dorian Gray\nwent over and poured the tea out.  The two men sauntered languidly to\nthe table, and examined what was under the covers.",
        "“Let us go to the theatre to-night,” said Lord Henry.  “There is sure\nto be something on, somewhere.  I have promised to dine at White’s,\nbut it is only with an old friend, so I can send him a wire and say\nthat I am ill, or that I am prevented from coming in consequence of a\nsubsequent engagement.  I think that would be a rather nice excuse:\nit would have the surprise of candor.”",
        "“It is such a bore putting on one’s dress-clothes,” muttered\nHallward.  “And, when one has them on, they are so horrid.”",
        "“Yes,” answered Lord Henry, dreamily, “the costume of our day is\ndetestable.  It is so sombre, so depressing.  Sin is the only color-\nelement left in modern life.”",
        "“You really must not say things like that before Dorian, Harry.”",
        "“Before which Dorian?  The one who is pouring out tea for us, or the\none in the picture?”",
        "“Before either.”",
        "“I should like to come to the theatre with you, Lord Henry,” said the\nlad.",
        "“Then you shall come; and you will come too, Basil, won’t you?”",
        "“I can’t, really.  I would sooner not.  I have a lot of work to do.”",
        "“Well, then, you and I will go alone, Mr. Gray.”",
        "“I should like that awfully.”",
        "Basil Hallward bit his lip and walked over, cup in hand, to the\npicture.  “I will stay with the real Dorian,” he said, sadly.",
        "“Is it the real Dorian?” cried the original of the portrait, running\nacross to him.  “Am I really like that?”",
        "“Yes; you are just like that.”",
        "“How wonderful, Basil!”",
        "“At least you are like it in appearance.  But it will never alter,\"\nsaid Hallward.  “That is something.”",
        "“What a fuss people make about fidelity!” murmured Lord Henry.",
        "“And, after all, it is purely a question for physiology.  It has\nnothing to do with our own will.  It is either an unfortunate\naccident, or an unpleasant result of temperament.  Young men want to\nbe faithful, and are not; old men want to be faithless, and cannot:\nthat is all one can say.”",
        "“Don’t go to the theatre to-night, Dorian,” said Hallward.  “Stop and\ndine with me.”",
        "“I can’t, really.”",
        "“Why?”",
        "“Because I have promised Lord Henry to go with him.”",
        "“He won’t like you better for keeping your promises.  He always\nbreaks his own.  I beg you not to go.”",
        "Dorian Gray laughed and shook his head.",
        "“I entreat you.”",
        "The lad hesitated, and looked over at Lord Henry, who was watching\nthem from the tea-table with an amused smile.",
        "[22] “I must go, Basil,” he answered.",
        "“Very well,” said Hallward; and he walked over and laid his cup down\non the tray.  “It is rather late, and, as you have to dress, you had\nbetter lose no time.  Good-by, Harry; good-by, Dorian.  Come and see\nme soon.  Come to-morrow.”",
        "“Certainly.”",
        "“You won’t forget?”",
        "“No, of course not.”",
        "“And . . . Harry!”",
        "“Yes, Basil?”",
        "“Remember what I asked you, when in the garden this morning.”",
        "“I have forgotten it.”",
        "“I trust you.”",
        "“I wish I could trust myself,” said Lord Henry, laughing.–\"Come, Mr.\nGray, my hansom is outside, and I can drop you at your own place.–\nGood-by, Basil.  It has been a most interesting afternoon.”",
        "As the door closed behind them, Hallward flung himself down on a\nsofa, and a look of pain came into his face.",
