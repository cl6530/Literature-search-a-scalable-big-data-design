        "RHYME, STANZA AND FREE VERSE",
        "  “Subtle rhymes, with ruin rife,\n  Murmur in the house of life.\"\n    EMERSON",
        "  “When this verse was first dictated to me I consider’d a Monotonous\n  Cadence like that used by Milton & Shakspeare, & all writers of\n  English Blank Verse, derived from the modern bondage of Rhyming, to\n  be a necessary and indispensible part of the verse. But I soon found\n  that in the mouth of a true Orator, such monotony was not only\n  awkward, but as much a bondage as rhyme itself. I therefore have\n  produced a variety in every line, both of cadences & number of\n  syllables. Every word and every letter is studied and put into its\n  fit place: the terrific numbers are reserved for the terrific parts,\n  the mild & gentle for the mild & gentle parts, and the prosaic for\n  inferior parts: all are necessary to each other. Poetry Fetter’d\n  Fetters the Human Race!\"\n    WILLIAM BLAKE",
        "1. Battles Long Ago\nAs we pass from the general consideration of Rhythm and Metre to some of\nthe special questions involved in Rhyme, Stanza and Free Verse, it may be\nwell to revert to the old distinction between what we called for\nconvenience the “outside” and the “inside” of a work of art. In the field\nof music we saw that this distinction is almost, if not quite,\nmeaningless, and in poetry it ought not to be pushed too far. Yet it is\nuseful in explaining the differences among men as they regard, now the\nexternal form of verse, and now its inner spirit, and as they ask\nthemselves how these two elements are related. Professor Butcher, in his\nAristotle’s Theory of Poetry and Fine Art,\n[Footnote: Page 147.]\ndescribes the natural tendencies of two sorts of men, who are quite as\npersistent to-day as ever they were in Greece in looking at one side only\nof the question:",
        "  “We need not agree with a certain modern school who would empty all\n  poetry of poetical thought and etherealize it till it melts into a\n  strain of music; who sing to us we hardly know of what, but in such a\n  way that the echoes of the real world, its men and women, its actual\n  stir and conflict, are faint and hardly to be discerned. The poetry,\n  we are told, resides not in the ideas conveyed, not in the blending\n  of soul and sense, but in the sound itself, in the cadence of the\n  verse. Yet, false as this view may be, it is not perhaps more false\n  than that other which wholly ignores the effect of musical sound and\n  looks only to the thought that is conveyed. Aristotle comes\n  perilously near this doctrine.”",
        "But it is not Aristotle only who permits himself at times to undervalue\nthe formal element in verse. It is also Sir Philip Sidney, with his famous\n“verse being but an ornament and no cause to poetry” and “it is not riming\nand versing that maketh a poet.” It is Shelley with his “The distinction\nbetween poets and prose writers in a vulgar error.... Plato was\nessentially a poet–the truth and splendor of his imagery, and the melody\nof his language, are the most intense that it is possible to conceive....\nLord Bacon was a poet.” It is Coleridge with his “The writings of Plato,\nand Bishop Taylor, and the Theoria Sacra of Burnet, furnish undeniable\nproofs that poetry of the highest kind may be written without metre.”",
        "In such passages as these, how generous are Sidney, Shelley, and Coleridge\nto the prose-men! And yet these same poet-critics, in dozens of other\npassages, have explained the fundamental justification of metre, rhyme and\nstanza as elements in the harmony of verse. Harmony may be attained, it is\ntrue, by rhythms too complicated to be easily scanned in metrical feet,\nand by measures which disregard rhyme and stanza; and poets, as well as\ncritics, by giving exclusive attention to a single element in harmony, are\nable to persuade themselves for the moment that all other elements are\nrelatively negligible. Milton, in his zeal for blank verse, attacked\nrhyme, in which he had already proved himself a master, quite as fiercely\nas any of our contemporary champions of free verse. Campion, a trained\nmusician, argued for a quantitative system of English prosody during the\nvery period when he was composing, in the accentual system, some of the\nmost exquisite songs in the language. Daniel, whose Defense of Rhyme(1603) was a triumphant reply to Campion’s theory, gave courteous\npraise to his opponent’s practice. Dryden, most flexible-minded of\ncritics, argues now for, and now against the use of rhymed heroic couplets\nin the drama, fitting his theories to the changing currents of\ncontemporary taste as well as to the varying, self-determined technique of\nhis own plays. “Never wholly out of the way, nor in it,” was Dryden’s\nhappy phrase to describe the artist’s freedom, a freedom always conscious\nof underlying law.",
        "2. Rhyme as a Form of Rhythm\nHowever theory and practice may happen to coincide or to drift apart, the\nfundamental law which justifies rhyme and stanza seems to be this: if\nrhythm is a primary fact in poetry, and metre is, as Aristotle called it,\nsections of rhythm, any device of repeating identical or nearly identical\nsounds at measured intervals is an aid to rhythmical effect. Rhyme is thus\na form, an “externalizing” of rhythm. It is structural as well as\ndecorative, or rather, it is one way of securing structure, of building\nverse. There are other devices, of course, for attaining symmetrical\npatterns, for conveying an impression of unity in variety. The “parallel\"\nstructure of Hebrew poetry, where one idea and phrase is balanced against\nanother,",
        "  “I have slain a man to my wounding–\n   And a young man to my hurt–”",
        "or the “envelope” structure of many of the Psalms, where the initial\nphrase or idea is repeated at the close, after the insertion of\nillustrative matter, thus securing a pattern by the “return” of the main\nidea–the closing of the “curve\"–may serve to illustrate the universality\nof the principle of balance and contrast and repetition in the\narchitecture of verse. For Hebrew poetry, like the poetry of many\nprimitive peoples, utilized the natural pleasure which the ear takes in\nlistening for and perceiving again an already uttered sound. Rhyme\nis a gratification of expectation, like the repetition of a chord in music\n[Footnote: “Most musical compositions are written in quite obvious rhymes;\nand the array of familiar and classical works that have not only rhymes\nbut distinct stanzaic arrangements exactly like those of poetry is worth\nremembering. Mendelssohn’s ’Spring Song’ and Rubinstein’s ’Romance in E\nFlat’ will occur at once as examples in which the stanzas are\nunmistakable.” C. E. Russell, “Swinburne and Music,” North American\nReview, November, 1907.]\nor of colors in a rug. It assists the mind in grasping the sense-rhythm,–\nthe design of the piece as a whole. It assists the emotions through the\nstimulus to the attention, through the reinforcement which it gives to the\npulsations of the psycho-physical organism.",
        "  “And sweep through the deep     While the stormy tempests blow,\n   While the battle rages long and loud\n     And the stormy tempests blow.”",
        "The pulses cannot help quickening as the rhymes quicken.",
        "But in order to perform this structural, rhythmical purpose it is not\nnecessary that rhyme be of any single recognized type. As long as the\near receives the pleasure afforded by accordant sound, any of the various\nhistorical forms of rhyme may serve. It may be Alliteration, the\nletter-rhyme or “beginning-rhyme” of Old English poetry:",
        "  ’Him be healfe stod hyse unweaxen,\n   Cniht on gecampe, se full caflice.”",
        "Tennyson imitates it in his “Battle of Brunanburh”:",
        "  “Mighty the Mercian,\n  Hard was his hand-play,\n  Sparing not any of\n  Those that with Anlaf,\n  Warriors over the\n  Weltering waters\n  Borne in the bark’s-bosom,\n  Drew to this island–\n  Doomed to the death.”",
        "This repetition of initial letters survives in phrases of prose like\n“dead and done with,” “to have and to hold,” and it is utilized in modern\nverse to give further emphasis to accentual syllables. But masters of\nalliterative effects, like Keats, Tennyson and Verlaine, constantly employ\nalliteration in unaccented syllables so as to color the tone-quality of a\nline without a too obvious assault upon the ear. The unrhymed songs of\nThe Princess are full of these delicate modulations of sound.",
        "In Common rhyme, or “end-rhyme” (found–abound), the accented vowel and\nall succeeding sounds are repeated, while the consonants preceding the\naccented vowel vary. Assonance, in its stricter sense, means the\nrepetition of an accented vowel (blackness–dances), while the succeeding\nsounds vary, but the terms “assonance” and “consonance” are often employed\nloosely to signify harmonious effects of tone-color within a line or group\nof lines. Complete or “identical” rhymes (fair–affair), which were\nlegitimate in Chaucer’s time, are not now considered admissible in\nEnglish. “Masculine” rhymes are end-rhymes of one syllable; “feminine\"\nrhymes are end-rhymes of two syllables (uncertain–curtain); internal or\n“middle-rhymes” are produced by the repetition at the end of a line of a\nrhyme-sound already employed within the line.",
        "  “We were the first that ever burst  Into that silent sea.”",
        "In general, the more frequent the repetitions of rhyme, the quicker is the\nrhythmic movement of the poem, and conversely. Thus, the In Memoriamstanza attains its peculiar effect of retardation by rhyming the first\nline with the fourth, so that the ear is compelled to wait for the\nexpected recurrence of the first rhyme sound.",
        "  “Beside the river’s wooded reach,\n  The fortress and the mountain ridge,\n  The cataract flashing from the bridge,\n  The breaker breaking on the beach.”",
        "This gives a movement markedly different from that secured by rearranging\nthe same lines in alternate rhymes:",
        "  “Beside the river’s wooded reach,\n  The fortress and the mountain ridge,\n  The breaker breaking on the beach,\n  The cataract flashing from the bridge.”",
        "If all the various forms of rhyme are only different ways of emphasizing\nrhythm through the repetition of accordant sounds, it follows that the\nvarying rhythmical impulses of poets and of readers will demand now a\ngreater and now a less dependence upon this particular mode of rhythmical\nsatisfaction. Chaucer complained of the scarcity of rhymes in English as\ncompared with their affluence in Old French, and it is true that rhyming\nis harder in our tongue than in the Romance languages. We have had\nmagicians of rhyme, like Swinburne, whose very profusion of rhyme-sounds\nends by cloying the taste of many a reader, and sending him back to blank\nverse or on to free verse. The Spenserian stanza, which calls for one\nfourfold set of rhymes, one threefold, and one double, all cunningly\ninterlaced, is as complicated a piece of rhyme-harmony as the ear of\nthe average lover of poetry can carry. It is needless to say that there\nare born rhymers, who think in rhyme and whose fecundity of imagery is\nmultiplied by the excitement of matching sound with sound. They are often\ncareless in their prodigality, inexact in their swift catching at any\nrhyme-word that will serve. At the other extreme are the self-conscious\nartists in verse who abhor imperfect concordances, and polish their rhymes\nuntil the life and freshness disappear. For sheer improvising cleverness\nof rhyme Byron is still unmatched, but he often contents himself with\napproximate rhymes that are nearly as bad as some of Mrs. Browning’s and\nWhittier’s. Very different is the deliberate artifice of the following\nlines, where the monotony of the rhyme-sound fits the “solemn ennui\"\nof the trailing peacocks;",
        "                              I\n  “From out the temple’s pillared portico,\n  Thence to the gardens where blue poppies blow\n  The gold and emerald peacocks saunter slow,\n  Trailing their solemn ennui as they go,\n  Trailing their melancholy and their woe.",
        "                              II\n  “Trailing their melancholy and their woe,\n  Trailing their solemn ennui as they go\n  The gold and emerald peacocks saunter slow\n  From out the gardens where blue poppies blow\n  Thence to the temple’s pillared portico.\"\n[Footnote: Frederic Adrian Lopere, “World Wisdom,” The International,\nSeptember, 1915.]",
        "Rhyme, then, is not merely a “jingle,” it is rather, as Samuel Johnson\nsaid of all versification, a “joining music with reason.” Its blending of\ndecorative with structural purpose is in truth “a dictate of nature,” or,\nto quote E. C. Stedman, “In real, that is, spontaneous minstrelsy, the\nfittest assonance, consonance, time, even rime,... come of themselves\nwith imaginative thought.”",
        "3. Stanza\nThere are some lovers of poetry, however, who will grant this theoretical\njustification of rhyme as an element in the harmony of verse, without\nadmitting that the actual rhyming stanzas of English verse show\n“spontaneous minstrelsy.” The word “stanza” or “strophe” means literally\n“a resting-place,” a halt or turn, that is to say, after a uniform group\nof rhymed lines. Alden defines it in his English Verse as “the largest\nunit of verse-measure ordinarily recognized. It is based not so much on\nrhythmical divisions as on periods either rhetorical or melodic; that is,\na short stanza will roughly correspond to the period of a sentence, and a\nlong one to that of a paragraph, while in lyrical verse the original idea\nwas to conform the stanza to the melody for which it was written.\"\n“Normally, then,” Alden adds in his Introduction to Poetry, “all the\nstanzas of a poem are identical in the number, the length, the metre, and\nthe rime-scheme of the corresponding verses.” The question arises,\ntherefore, whether those units which we call “stanzas” are arbitrary or\nvital. Have the lines been fused into their rhymed grouping by passionate\nfeeling, or is their unity a mere mechanical conformation to a pattern? In\nTheodore Watts-Dunton’s well-known article on “Poetry” in the\nEncyclopaedia Brittanica[Footnote: Now reprinted, with many expansions, in his Poetry and the\nRenascence of Wonder. E. P. Dutton, New York.]\nthe phrases “stanzaic law” and “emotional law” are used to represent the\ntwo principles at issue:",
        "  “In modern prosody the arrangement of the rhymes and the length of\n  the lines in any rhymed metrical passage may be determined either by\n  a fixed stanzaic law, or by a law infinitely deeper–by the law which\n  impels the soul, in a state of poetic exultation, to seize hold of\n  every kind of metrical aid, such as rhyme, caesura, etc., for the\n  purpose of accentuating and marking off each shade of emotion as it\n  arises, regardless of any demands of stanza.... If a metrical passage\n  does not gain immensely by being written independently of stanzaic\n  law, it loses immensely; and for this reason, perhaps, that the great\n  charm of the music of all verse, as distinguished from the music of\n  prose, is inevitableness of cadence. In regular metres we enjoy the\n  pleasure of feeling that the rhymes will inevitably fall under a\n  recognized law of couplet or stanza. But if the passage flows\n  independently of these, it must still flow inevitably–it must, in\n  short, show that it is governed by another and a yet deeper force,\n  the inevitableness of emotional expression.”",
        "This distinction between “stanzaic law” and “emotional law” is highly\nsuggestive and not merely in its application to the metres of the famous\nregular and irregular odes of English verse. It applies also to the\ninfinite variety of stanza-patterns which English poetry has taken over\nfrom Latin and French sources and developed through centuries\nofexperimentation, and it affords a key, as we shall see in a moment, to\nsome of the vexed questions involved in free verse.",
        "Take first the more familiar of the stanza forms of English verse. They\nare conveniently indicated by using letters of the alphabet to correspond\nwith each rhyme-sound, whenever repeated.",
        "Thus the rhymed couplet",
        "  “Around their prows the ocean roars,\n  And chafes beneath their thousand oars”",
        "may be marked as “four-stress iambic,” rhyming aa; the heroic couplet",
        "  “The zeal of fools offends at any time,\n  But most of all the zeal of fools in rhyme”",
        "as five-stress iambic, rhyming aa. The familiar measure of English\nballad poetry,",
        "  “The King has written a braid letter,\n    And signed it wi’ his hand,\n  And sent it to Sir Patrick Spence,\n    Was walking on the sand”",
        "is alternating four-stress and three-stress iambic, rhyming ab cb. The\nIn Memoriam stanza,",
        "  “Now rings the woodland loud and long,\n    The distance takes a lovelier hue,\n    And drown’d in yonder living blue\n  The lark becomes a sightless song”",
        "is four-stress iambic, rhyming ab ba.",
        "The Chaucerian stanza rhymes a b a b b c c:",
        "  “’Loke up, I seye, and telle me what she is\n  Anon, that I may gone aboute thi nede:\n  Know iche hire ought? for my love telle me this;\n  Thanne wolde I hopen the rather for to spede.’\n  Tho gan the veyne of Troilus to blede,\n  For he was hit, and wex alle rede for schame;\n  ’Aha!’ quod Pandare, ’here bygynneth game.’”",
        "Byron’s “ottava rima” rhymes a b a b a b c c:",
        "  “A mighty mass of brick, and smoke, and shipping,\n    Dirty and dusky, but as wide as eye\n  Could reach, with here and there a sail just skipping\n    In sight, then lost amidst the forestry\n  Of masts; a wilderness of steeples peeping\n    On tiptoe through their sea-coal canopy;\n  A huge, dun cupola, like a foolscap crown\n  On a fool’s head–and there is London Town!”",
        "The Spenserian stanza rhymes a b a b b c b c c, with an extra foot in\nthe final line:",
        "  “Hee had a faire companion of his way,\n  A goodly lady clad in scarlot red,\n  Purfled with gold and pearle of rich assay;\n  And like a Persian mitre on her hed\n  Shee wore, with crowns and owches garnished,\n  The which her lavish lovers to her gave:\n  Her wanton palfrey all was overspred\n  With tinsell trappings, woven like a wave,\n  Whose bridle rung with golden bels and bosses brave.”",
        "In considering these various groups of lines which we call stanzas it is\nclear that we have to do with thought-units as well as feeling-units, and\nthat both thought-units and feeling-units should be harmonized, if\npossible, with the demands of beauty and variety of sound as represented\nby the rhymes. It is not absurd to speak of the natural “size” of poetic\nthoughts. Pope, for instance, often works with ideas of couplet size, just\nas Martial sometimes amused himself with ideas of a still smaller epigram\nsize, or Omar Khayyam with thoughts and fancies that came in quatrain\nsizes. Many sonnets fail of effectiveness because the contained thought is\ntoo scanty or too full to receive adequate expression in the fourteen\nlines demanded by the traditional sonnet form. They are sometimes only\nquatrain ideas, blown up big with words to fill out the fourteen\nlines, or, on the contrary, as often with the Elizabethans, they are whole\nodes or elegies, remorselessly packed into the fashionable fourteen-line\nlimit. No one who has given attention to the normal length of phrases and\nsentences doubts that there are natural “breathfuls” of words\ncorresponding to the units of ideas; and when ideas are organized by\nemotion, there are waves, gusts, or ripples of words, matching the waves\nof feeling. In the ideal poetic “pattern,” these waves of idea, feeling\nand rhythmic speech would coincide more or less completely; we should have\na union of “emotional law” with “stanzaic law,” the soul of poetry would\nfind its perfect embodiment.",
        "But if we turn the pages of any collection of English poetry, say the\nGolden Treasury or the Oxford Book of English Verse, we find something\nvery different from this ideal embodiment of each poetic emotion in a form\ndelicately moulded to the particular species of emotion revealed. We\ndiscover that precisely similar stanzaic patterns–like similar metrical\npatterns–are often used to express diametrically opposite feelings,–let\nus say, joy and sorrow, doubt and exultation, victory and defeat. The\n“common metre” of English hymnology is thus seen to be a rough mould into\nwhich almost any kind of religious emotion may be poured. If “trochaic\"\nmeasures do not always trip it on a light fantastic toe, neither do\n“iambic” measures always pace sedately. Doubtless there is a certain\ngeneral fitness, in various stanza forms, for this or that poetic purpose:\nthe stanzas employed by English or Scotch balladry are admittedly\nexcellent for story-telling; Spenser’s favorite stanza is unrivalled\nfor painting dream-pictures and rendering dream-music, but less available\nfor pure narration; Chaucer’s seven-line stanza, so delicately balanced\nupon that fourth, pivotal line, can paint a picture and tell a story too;\nByron’s ottava rima has a devil-may-care jauntiness, borrowed, it is\ntrue, from his Italian models, but perfectly fitted to Byron’s own mood;\nthe rhymed couplets of Pope sting and glitter like his antitheses, and the\ncouplets of Dryden have their “resonance like a great bronze coin thrown\ndown on marble\"; each great artist in English verse, in short, chooses by\ninstinct the general stanza form best suited to his particular purpose,\nand then moulds its details with whatever cunning he may possess. But the\nsignificant point is this: “stanzaic law” makes for uniformity, for the\nendless repetition of the chosen pattern, which must still be recognized\nas a pattern, however subtly the artist modulates his details; and in\nadjusting the infinitely varied material of thought and feeling, phrase\nand image, picture and story to the fixed stanzaic design, there are bound\nto be gaps and patches, stretchings and foldings of the thought-stuff,–\nfor even as in humble tailor-craft, this many-colored coat of poetry must\nbe cut according to the cloth as well as according to the pattern. How\nmany pages of even the Oxford Book of English Verse are free from some\ntouch of feebleness, of redundancy, of constraint due to the remorseless\nrequirements of the stanza? The line must be filled out, whether or not\nthe thought is quite full enough for it; rhyme must match rhyme, even if\nthe thought becomes as far-fetched as the rhyming word; the stanza, in\nshort, demands one kind of perfection as a constantly repeated musical\ndesign, as beauty of form; and another kind of perfection as the\nexpression of human emotion. Sometimes these two perfections of “form” and\n“significance” are miraculously wedded, stanza after stanza, and we have\nour “Ode to a Nightingale,” or “Ode to Autumn” as the result. (And perhaps\nthe best, even in this kind, are but shadows, when compared with the\nabsolute union of truth and beauty as the poetic idea first took rhythmic\nform in the brain of the poet.)",
        "Yet more often lovers of poetry must content themselves, not with such\n“dictates of nature” as these poems, but with approximations. Each\nstanzaic form has its conveniences, its “fatal facility,” its natural\nfitness for singing a song or telling a story or turning a thought over\nand over into music. Intellectual readers will always like the\nepigrammatic “snap” of the couplet, and Spenser will remain, largely\nbecause of his choice of stanza, the “poet’s poet.” Perhaps\nthe very necessity of fitting rhymes together stimulates as much poetic\nactivity as it discourages; for many poets have testified that the delight\nof rhyming adds energy to the imagination. If, as Shelley said, “the mind\nin creation is as a fading coal, which some invisible influence, like an\ninconstant wind, awakens to transitory brightness,” why may it not be the\nbreath of rhyme, as well as any other form of rhythmic energy, which\nquickens its drooping flame? And few poets, furthermore, will admit that\nthey are really in bondage to their stanzas. They love to dance in these\nfetters, and even when wearing the same fetters as another poet, they\nnevertheless invent movements of their own, so that Mr. Masefield’s\n“Chaucerian” stanzas are really not so much Chaucer’s as Masefield’s.",
        "Each Ulysses makes and bends his own bow, after all; it is only the\nunsuccessful suitors for the honors of poetic craftsmanship who complain\nof its difficulties. Something of our contemporary impatience with fixed\nstanzaic forms is due perhaps to the failure to recognize that the greater\npoets succeed in making over every kind of poetic pattern in the act of\nemploying it, just as a Chopin minuet differs from a Liszt minuet,\nalthough both composers are using the same fundamental form of dance\nmusic. We must allow for the infinite variety of creative intention,\ntechnique and result. The true defence of rhyme and stanza against the\narguments of extreme advocates of free verse is to point out that\nrhyme and stanza are natural structural devices for securing certain\neffects. There are various types of bridges for crossing different kinds\nof streams; no one type of bridge is always and everywhere the best. To do\naway with rhyme and stanza is to renounce some modes of poetic beauty; it\nis to resolve that there shall be one less way of crossing the stream. An\nadvocate of freedom in the arts may well admit that the artist may bridge\nhis particular stream in any way he can,–or he may ford it or swim it or\ngo over in an airplane if he chooses. But some method must be found of\ngetting his ideas and emotions “across” into the mind and feelings of the\nreaders of his poetry. If this can adequately be accomplished without\nrecourse to rhyme and stanza, very well; there is Paradise Lost, for\ninstance, and Hamlet. But here we are driven back again upon the\ncountless varieties of artistic intention and craftsmanship and effect.\nEach method–and there are as many methods as there are poets and far\nmore, for craftsmen like Milton and Tennyson try hundreds of methods in\ntheir time–is only a medium through which the artist is endeavoring to\nattain a special result. It is one way–only one, and perhaps not the best\nway–of trying to cross the stream.",
        "4. Free Verse\nRecalling now the discussion of the rhythms of prose in the previous\nchapter, and remembering that rhyme and stanza are special forms of\nreinforcing the impulse of rhythm, what shall be said of free verse? It\nbelongs, unquestionably, in that “neutral zone” which some readers, in Dr.\nPatterson’s phrase, instinctively appropriate as “prose experience,” and\nothers as “verse experience.” It renounces metre–or rather endeavors to\nrenounce it, for it does not always succeed. It professes to do away with\nrhyme and stanza, although it may play cunningly upon the sounds of like\nand unlike words, and it may arrange phrases into poetic paragraphs,\nwhich, aided by the art of typography, secure a kind of stanzaic effect.\nIt cannot, however, do away with the element of rhythm, with ordered time.\nThe moment free verse ceases to be felt as rhythmical, it ceases to be\nfelt as poetry. This is admitted by its advocates and its opponents\nalike. The real question at issue then, is the manner in which free verse\nmay secure the effects of rhythmic unity and variety, without, on the one\nhand, resorting to the obvious rhythms of prose, or on the other hand,\nwithout repeating the recognized patterns of verse. There are many\ncompetent critics who maintain with Edith Wyatt that “on an earth where\nthere is nothing to wear but clothes, nothing to eat but food, there is\nalso nothing to read but prose and poetry.” “According to the results of\nour experiments,” testifies Dr. Patterson, “there is no psychological\nmeaning to claims for a third genre between regular verse and prose,\nexcept in the sense of a jumping back and forth from one side of the fence\nto the other.\"\n[Footnote: The Rhythm of Prose, p. 77.]\nAnd in the preface to his second edition, after having listened to Miss\nAmy Lowell’s readings of free verse, Dr. Patterson remarks: “What is\nachieved, as a rule, in Miss Lowell’s case, is emotional prose,\nemphatically phrased, excellent and moving. Spaced prose, we may call\nit.”",
        "Now “spaced prose” is a useful expression, inasmuch as it calls attention\nto the careful emphasis and balance of phrases which up so much of the\nrhetorical structure of free verse, and it also serves to remind us of the\npart which typography plays in “spacing” these phrases, and stressing for\nthe eye their curves and “returns.” But we are all agreed that\ntypographical appeals to the eye are infinitely deceptive in blurring the\ndistinction between verse and prose, and that the trained ear must be the\nonly arbiter as to poetical and pseudo-poetical effects. Ask a lover of\nWalt Whitman whether “spaced prose” is the right label for “Out of the\nCradle Endlessly Rocking,” and he will scoff at you. He will maintain that\nfollowing the example of the rich broken rhythms of the English Bible, the\nexample of Ossian, Blake, and many another European experimenter during\nthe Romantic epoch, Whitman really succeeded in elaborating a mode of\npoetical expression, nearer for the most part to recitative than to\naria, yet neither pure declamation nor pure song: a unique embodiment of\npassionate feeling, a veritable “neutral zone,” which refuses to let\nitself be annexed to either “prose” or “verse” as those terms are\nordinarily understood, but for which “free verse” is precisely the right\nexpression. Leaves of Grass (1855) remains the most interesting of all\nexperiments with free verse, written as it was by an artist whose natural\nrhythmical endowment was extraordinary, and whose technical curiosity and\npatience in modulating his tonal effects was unwearied by failures and\nundiscouraged by popular neglect. But the case for free verse does not,\nafter all, stand or fall with Walt Whitman. His was merely the most\npowerful poetic personality among the countless artificers who have\nendeavored to produce rhythmic and tonal beauty through new structural\ndevices.",
        "Readers who are familiar with the experiments of contemporary poets will\neasily recognize four prevalent types of “free verse”:",

        "It is clear that the quoted words of the Associated Press dispatch from\nPeoria are pure prose, devoid of rhythmical pattern, devoted to a plain\nstatement of fact. So it is with the imaginary speech of the River. Not\nuntil the borrowed fourth line:",

        "do we catch the rhythm (and even the metre) of verse, and F. P. A. is\nhere imitating Mr. Masters’s way of introducing a strongly rhythmical and\neven metrical line into a passage otherwise flatly “prosaic” in its\ntime-intervals. But “free verse” adopts many other cadences of English\nprose besides this “formless” structure which goes with matter-of-fact\nstatement. It also reproduces the neat, polished, perhaps epigrammatic\nsentence which crystallizes a fact or a generalization; the more emotional\nand “moving” period resulting from heightened feeling, and finally the\nfrankly imitative and ornamented cadences of descriptive and highly\nimpassioned prose. Let us take some illustrations from Sidney Lanier’s\nPoem Outlines, a posthumously published collection of some of his\nsketches for poems, “jotted in pencil on the backs of envelopes, on the\nmargins of musical programmes, or little torn scraps of paper.”",
        "  “The United States in two hundred years\n    has made Emerson out of a witch-burner.”",
        "This is polished, graphic prose. Here is an equally graphic, but more\nimpassioned sentence, with the staccato rhythm and the alliterative\nemphasis of good angry speech:",
        "    To the Politicians\n  “You are servants. Your thoughts are the thoughts of cooks curious to\n  skim perquisites from every pan, your quarrels are the quarrels of\n  scullions who fight for the privilege of cleaning the pot with most\n  leavings in it, your committees sit upon the landings of back-stairs,\n  and your quarrels are the quarrels of kitchens.”",
        "But in the following passage, apparently a first draft for some lines in\nHymns of the Marshes, Lanier takes a strongly rhythmical, heavily\npunctuated type of prose, as if he were writing a Collect:",
        "  “The courses of the wind, and the shifts thereof, as also what way the\n  clouds go; and that which is happening a long way off; and the full face\n  of the sun; and the bow of the Milky Way from end to end; as also the\n  small, the life of the fiddler-crab, and the household of the marsh-hen;\n  and more, the translation of black ooze into green blade of marsh-grass,\n  which is as if filth bred heaven: This a man seeth upon the marsh.”",
        "In that rhapsody of the marsh there is no recognizable metrical scheme, in\nspite of the plainly marked rhythm, but in the following symbolic sketch\nthe imitation of the horse’s ambling introduces an element of regular\nmetre:",
        "  “Ambling, ambling round the ring,\n   Round the ring of daily duty,\n   Leap, Circus-rider, man, through the paper hoop of death,\n   –Ah, lightest thou, beyond death, on this same slow-ambling,\n     padded horse of life.”",
        "And finally, in such fragments as the following, Lanier uses a regular\nmetre of “English verse\"–it is true with a highly irregular third line–",
        "                    “And then\n  A gentle violin mated with the flute,\n  And both flew off into a wood of harmony,\n  Two doves of tone.”",
        "It is clear that an artist in words, in jotting down thoughts and images\nas they first emerge, may instinctively use language which is subtly\nblended of verse and prose, like many rhapsodical passages in the private\njournals of Thoreau and Emerson. When duly elaborated, these passages\nusually become, in the hands of the greater artists, either one thing or\nthe other, i.e. unmistakable prose or unmistakable verse. But it remains\ntrue, I think, that there is another artistic instinct which impels\ncertain poets to blend the types in the endeavor to reach a new and hybrid\nbeauty.\n[Footnote: Some examples of recent verse are printed in the “Notes and\nIllustrations” for this chapter.]",

        "5. Discovery and Rediscovery\nIt is not pretended that the four types of free verse which have been\nillustrated are marked by clear-cut generic differences. They shade into\none another. But they are all based upon a common sensitiveness to the\neffects of rhythmic prose, a common restlessness under what is felt to be\nthe restraint of metre and rhyme, and a common endeavor to break down the\nconventional barrier which separates the characteristic beauty of prose\nspeech from the characteristic beauty of verse. In this endeavor to\nobliterate boundary lines, to secure in one art the effects hitherto\nsupposed to be the peculiar property of another, free verse is only one\nmore evidence of the widespread “confusion of the genres” which marks\ncontemporary artistic effort. It is possible, with the classicists, to\ncondemn outright this blurring of values.\n[Footnote: See, for instance, Irving Babbitt, The New Laokoon. Houghton\nMifflin Company, 1910.]\nOne may legitimately maintain, with Edith Wyatt, that the traditional\nmethods of English verse are to the true artist not oppressions but\nliberations. She calls it “a fallacious idea that all individual and all\nrealistic expression in poetry is annulled by the presence of distinctive\nmusical discernment, by the movement of rhyme with its keen heightening of\nthe impulse of rhythm, by the word-shadows of assonance, by harmonies,\novertones and the still beat of ordered time, subconsciously perceived but\nprecise as the sense of the symphony leader’s flying baton. To readers, to\nwriters for whom the tonal quality of every language is an intrinsic value\nthese faculties of poetry serve not at all as cramping oppressions, but as\ngreat liberations for the communication of truth.\"\n[Footnote: New Republic, August 24, 1918.]\nBut many practitioners of free verse would reply that this is not a matter\nfor theorizing, but of individual preference, and that in their endeavor\nto communicate new modes of feeling, new aspects of beauty, they have a\nright to the use of new forms, even if those new forms be compounded out\nof the wreck of old ones. This argument for freedom of experiment is\nunanswerable; the true test of its validity lies in the results secured.\nThat free verse has now and then succeeded in creating lovely flowering\nhybrids seems to me as indubitable as the magical tricks which Mr. Burbank\nhas played with flowers and fruits. But the smiling Dame Nature sets her\ninexorable limits to “Burbanking\"; she allows it to go about so far, and\nno farther. Freakish free verse, like freakish plants and animals, gets\npunished by sterility. Some of the “imagist” verse patterns are uniquely\nand intricately beautiful. Wrought in a medium which is neither wholly\nverse nor wholly prose, but which borrows some of the beauty peculiar to\neach art, they are their own excuse for being. And nevertheless they may\nnot prove fertile. It may be that they have been produced by “pushing a\nmedium farther than it will go.”",
        "It must be admitted, furthermore, that a great deal of contemporary free\nverse has been written by persons with an obviously incomplete command\nover the resources of expression. Max Eastman has called it “Lazy Verse,\"\nthe product of “aboriginal indolence\"; and he adds this significant\ndistinction, “In all arts it is the tendency of those who are ungrown to\nconfuse the expression of intense feeling with the intense expression of\nfeeling–which last is all the world will long listen to.” Shakspere,\nMilton, Keats are masters of concentrated, intensest expression: their\nverse, at its best, is structural as an oak. Those of us who have read\nwith keen momentary enjoyment thousands of pages of the “New Verse,\"\nare frequently surprised to find how little of it stamps itself upon the\nmemory. Intense feeling has gone into these formless forms, very\ncertainly, but the medium soaks up the feeling like blotting-paper. In\norder to live, poetry must be plastic, a stark embodiment of emotion, and\nnot a solution of emotion.",
        "That fragile, transient fashions of expression have their own evanescent\ntype of beauty no one who knows the history of Euphuism will deny. And\nmuch of the New Verse is Euphuistic, not merely in its self-conscious\ncleverness, its delightful toying with words and phrases for their own\nsake, its search of novel cadences and curves, but also in its naive\npleasure in rediscovering and parodying what the ancients had discovered\nlong before. “Polyphonic prose,” for instance, as announced and\nillustrated by Mr. Paul Fort and Miss Amy Lowell, is prose that\nmakes use of all the “voices” of poetry,–viz. metre, vers libre,\nassonances, alliteration, rhyme and return. “Metrical verse,” says Miss\nLowell in the Preface to Can Grande’s Castle, “has one set of laws,\ncadenced verse another; ’polyphonic prose’ can go from one to the other in\nthe same poem with no sense of incongruity.... I finally decided to base\nmy form upon the long, flowing cadence of oratorical prose. The variations\npermitted to this cadence enable the poet to change the more readily into\nthose of vers libre, or even to take the regular beat of metre, should\nsuch a marked time seem advisable.... Rhyme is employed to give a richness\nof effect, to heighten the musical feeling of a passage, but ... the\nrhymes should seldom come at the ends of the cadences.... Return in\n’polyphonic prose’ is usually achieved by the recurrence of a dominant\nthought or image, coming in irregularly and in varying words, but still\ngiving the spherical effect which I have frequently spoken of as\nimperative in all poetry.”",
        "Now every one of these devices is at least as old as Isocrates. It was in\nthis very fashion that Euphues and his Friends delighted to serve and\nreturn their choicest tennis balls of Elizabethan phrase. But little De\nQuincey could pull out the various stops of polyphonic prose even more\ncleverly than John Lyly; and if one will read the admirable description of\nSt. Mark’s in Can Grandel’s Castle, and then re-read Ruskin’s\ndescription of St. Mark’s, he will find that the Victorian’s orchestration\nof many-voiced prose does not suffer by comparison.",
        "Yet though it is true enough of the arts, as Chaucer wrote suavely long\nago, that “There nys no newe thing that is not olde,” we must remember\nthat the arts are always profiting by their naive rediscoveries. It is\nmore important that the thing should seem new than that it should really\nbe new, and the fresh sense of untried possibilities, the feeling that\nmuch land remains to be possessed, has given our contemporaries the\nspirits and the satisfactions of the pioneer. What matters it that a few\nantiquaries can trace on old maps the very rivers and harbors which the\nNew Verse believed itself to be exploring for the first time? Poetry does\nnot live by antiquarianism, but by the passionate conviction that all\nthings are made new through the creative imagination.",
        "     “Have the elder races halted?\n  Do they droop and end their lesson, wearied over there beyond the seas?\n  We take up the task eternal, and the burden and the lesson,\n     Pioneers! O pioneers!”",
