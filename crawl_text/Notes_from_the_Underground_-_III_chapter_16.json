        "\nI found two of my old schoolfellows with him.  They seemed to be\ndiscussing an important matter.  All of them took scarcely any notice of\nmy entrance, which was strange, for I had not met them for years. \nEvidently they looked upon me as something on the level of a common\nfly.  I had not been treated like that even at school, though they all hated\nme. I knew, of course, that they must despise me now for my lack of\nsuccess in the service, and for my having let myself sink so low, going\nabout badly dressed and so on—which seemed to them a sign of my\nincapacity and insignificance.  But I had not expected such contempt. \nSimonov was positively surprised at my turning up.  Even in old days he\nhad always seemed surprised at my coming.  All this disconcerted me: I\nsat down, feeling rather miserable, and began listening to what they were\nsaying.",
        "They were engaged in warm and earnest conversation about a farewell\ndinner which they wanted to arrange for the next day to a comrade of\ntheirs called Zverkov, an officer in the army, who was going away to a\ndistant province.  This Zverkov had been all the time at school with me\ntoo.  I had begun to hate him particularly in the upper forms.  In the lower\nforms he had simply been a pretty, playful boy whom everybody liked.  I\nhad hated him, however, even in the lower forms, just because he was a\npretty and playful boy.  He was always bad at his lessons and got worse and\nworse as he went on; however, he left with a good certificate, as he had\npowerful interests.  During his last year at school he came in for an estate\nof two hundred serfs, and as almost all of us were poor he took up a\nswaggering tone among us.  He was vulgar in the extreme, but at the same\ntime he was a good-natured fellow, even in his swaggering.  In spite of\nsuperficial, fantastic and sham notions of honour and dignity, all but very\nfew of us positively grovelled before Zverkov, and the more so the more he\nswaggered.  And it was not from any interested motive that they grovelled,\nbut simply because he had been favoured by the gifts of nature.  Moreover,\nit was, as it were, an accepted idea among us that Zverkov was a\nspecialist in regard to tact and the social graces.  This last fact particularly\ninfuriated me.  I hated the abrupt self-confident tone of his voice, his\nadmiration of his own witticisms, which were often frightfully stupid,\nthough he was bold in his language; I hated his handsome, but stupid\nface (for which I would, however, have gladly exchanged my intelligent\none), and the free-and-easy military manners in fashion in the “’forties.\"\nI hated the way in which he used to talk of his future conquests of women\n(he did not venture to begin his attack upon women until he had the\nepaulettes of an officer, and was looking forward to them with impatience),\nand boasted of the duels he would constantly be fighting.  I remember\nhow I, invariably so taciturn, suddenly fastened upon Zverkov,\nwhen one day talking at a leisure moment with his schoolfellows of his\nfuture relations with the fair sex, and growing as sportive as a puppy in\nthe sun, he all at once declared that he would not leave a single village\ngirl on his estate unnoticed, that that was his DROIT DE SEIGNEUR, and that if\nthe peasants dared to protest he would have them all flogged and double\nthe tax on them, the bearded rascals.  Our servile rabble applauded, but I\nattacked him, not from compassion for the girls and their fathers, but\nsimply because they were applauding such an insect.  I got the better of\nhim on that occasion, but though Zverkov was stupid he was lively and\nimpudent, and so laughed it off, and in such a way that my victory was\nnot really complete; the laugh was on his side.  He got the better of me on\nseveral occasions afterwards, but without malice, jestingly, casually.  I\nremained angrily and contemptuously silent and would not answer him. \nWhen we left school he made advances to me; I did not rebuff them, for I\nwas flattered, but we soon parted and quite naturally.  Afterwards I heard\nof his barrack-room success as a lieutenant, and of the fast life he was\nleading.  Then there came other rumours—of his successes in the service.\nBy then he had taken to cutting me in the street, and I suspected\nthat he was afraid of compromising himself by greeting a personage as\ninsignificant as me.  I saw him once in the theatre, in the third tier of\nboxes.  By then he was wearing shoulder-straps.  He was twisting and\ntwirling about, ingratiating himself with the daughters of an ancient\nGeneral.  In three years he had gone off considerably, though he was still\nrather handsome and adroit.  One could see that by the time he was thirty\nhe would be corpulent.  So it was to this Zverkov that my schoolfellows\nwere going to give a dinner on his departure.  They had kept up with him\nfor those three years, though privately they did not consider themselves\non an equal footing with him, I am convinced of that.",
        "Of Simonov’s two visitors, one was Ferfitchkin, a Russianised German\n—a little fellow with the face of a monkey, a blockhead who was always\nderiding everyone, a very bitter enemy of mine from our days in the lower\nforms—a vulgar, impudent, swaggering fellow, who affected a most sensitive\nfeeling of personal honour, though, of course, he was a wretched\nlittle coward at heart.  He was one of those worshippers of Zverkov who\nmade up to the latter from interested motives, and often borrowed money\nfrom him.  Simonov’s other visitor, Trudolyubov, was a person in no way\nremarkable—a tall young fellow, in the army, with a cold face, fairly\nhonest, though he worshipped success of every sort, and was only capable\nof thinking of promotion.  He was some sort of distant relation of\nZverkov’s, and this, foolish as it seems, gave him a certain importance\namong us.  He always thought me of no consequence whatever; his\nbehaviour to me, though not quite courteous, was tolerable.",
        "“Well, with seven roubles each,” said Trudolyubov, “twenty-one\nroubles between the three of us, we ought to be able to get a good dinner. \nZverkov, of course, won’t pay.”",
        "“Of course not, since we are inviting him,” Simonov decided.",
        "“Can you imagine,” Ferfitchkin interrupted hotly and conceitedly, like\nsome insolent flunkey boasting of his master the General’s decorations,\n“can you imagine that Zverkov will let us pay alone?  He will accept from\ndelicacy, but he will order half a dozen bottles of champagne.”",
        "“Do we want half a dozen for the four of us?” observed Trudolyubov,\ntaking notice only of the half dozen.",
        "“So the three of us, with Zverkov for the fourth, twenty-one roubles, at\nthe Hotel de Paris at five o’clock tomorrow,” Simonov, who had been\nasked to make the arrangements, concluded finally.",
        "“How twenty-one roubles?” I asked in some agitation, with a show of\nbeing offended; “if you count me it will not be twenty-one, but\ntwenty-eight roubles.”",
        "It seemed to me that to invite myself so suddenly and unexpectedly\nwould be positively graceful, and that they would all be conquered at\nonce and would look at me with respect.",
        "“Do you want to join, too?” Simonov observed, with no appearance of\npleasure, seeming to avoid looking at me.  He knew me through and through.",
        "It infuriated me that he knew me so thoroughly.",
        "“Why not?  I am an old schoolfellow of his, too, I believe, and I\nmust own I feel hurt that you have left me out,” I said, boiling over again.",
        "“And where were we to find you?” Ferfitchkin put in roughly.",
        "“You never were on good terms with Zverkov,” Trudolyubov added, frowning.",
        "But I had already clutched at the idea and would not give it up.",
        "“It seems to me that no one has a right to form an opinion upon that,” I\nretorted in a shaking voice, as though something tremendous had happened.\n“Perhaps that is just my reason for wishing it now, that I have not\nalways been on good terms with him.”",
        "“Oh, there’s no making you out ... with these refinements,\"\nTrudolyubov jeered.",
        "“We’ll put your name down,” Simonov decided, addressing me.\n“Tomorrow at five-o’clock at the Hotel de Paris.”",
        "“What about the money?” Ferfitchkin began in an undertone, indicating\nme to Simonov, but he broke off, for even Simonov was embarrassed.",
        "“That will do,” said Trudolyubov, getting up.  “If he wants to come so\nmuch, let him.”",
        "“But it’s a private thing, between us friends,” Ferfitchkin said crossly,\nas he, too, picked up his hat.  “It’s not an official gathering.”",
        "“We do not want at all, perhaps ...”",
        "They went away.  Ferfitchkin did not greet me in any way as he went\nout, Trudolyubov barely nodded.  Simonov, with whom I was left TETE-A-TETE,\nwas in a state of vexation and perplexity, and looked at me queerly.\nHe did not sit down and did not ask me to.",
        "“H’m ... yes ... tomorrow, then.  Will you pay your subscription\nnow?  I just ask so as to know,” he muttered in embarrassment.",
        "I flushed crimson, as I did so I remembered that I had owed Simonov\nfifteen roubles for ages—which I had, indeed, never forgotten, though I\nhad not paid it.",
        "“You will understand, Simonov, that I could have no idea when I came\nhere ....  I am very much vexed that I have forgotten ....”",
        "“All right, all right, that doesn’t matter.  You can pay tomorrow after the\ndinner.  I simply wanted to know ....  Please don’t ...”",
        "He broke off and began pacing the room still more vexed.  As he walked\nhe began to stamp with his heels.",
        "“Am I keeping you?” I asked, after two minutes of silence.",
        "“Oh!” he said, starting, “that is—to be truthful—yes.  I have to go and\nsee someone ... not far from here,” he added in an apologetic voice,\nsomewhat abashed.",
        "“My goodness, why didn’t you say so?” I cried, seizing my cap, with an\nastonishingly free-and-easy air, which was the last thing I should have\nexpected of myself.",
        "“It’s close by ... not two paces away,” Simonov repeated, accompanying\nme to the front door with a fussy air which did not suit him at all.  “So\nfive o’clock, punctually, tomorrow,” he called down the stairs after me. \nHe was very glad to get rid of me.  I was in a fury.",
        "“What possessed me, what possessed me to force myself upon them?” I\nwondered, grinding my teeth as I strode along the street, “for a scoundrel,\na pig like that Zverkov!  Of course I had better not go; of course, I must\njust snap my fingers at them.  I am not bound in any way.  I’ll send\nSimonov a note by tomorrow’s post ....”",
        "But what made me furious was that I knew for certain that I should go,\nthat I should make a point of going; and the more tactless, the more\nunseemly my going would be, the more certainly I would go.",
        "And there was a positive obstacle to my going: I had no money.  All I\nhad was nine roubles, I had to give seven of that to my servant, Apollon,\nfor his monthly wages.  That was all I paid him—he had to keep himself.",
        "Not to pay him was impossible, considering his character.  But I will\ntalk about that fellow, about that plague of mine, another time.",
        "However, I knew I should go and should not pay him his wages.",
        "That night I had the most hideous dreams.  No wonder; all the evening\nI had been oppressed by memories of my miserable days at school, and I\ncould not shake them off.  I was sent to the school by distant relations,\nupon whom I was dependent and of whom I have heard nothing since—\nthey sent me there a forlorn, silent boy, already crushed by their reproaches,\nalready troubled by doubt, and looking with savage distrust at\neveryone.  My schoolfellows met me with spiteful and merciless jibes\nbecause I was not like any of them.  But I could not endure their taunts; I\ncould not give in to them with the ignoble readiness with which they gave\nin to one another.  I hated them from the first, and shut myself away from\neveryone in timid, wounded and disproportionate pride.  Their coarseness\nrevolted me.  They laughed cynically at my face, at my clumsy\nfigure; and yet what stupid faces they had themselves.  In our school the\nboys’ faces seemed in a special way to degenerate and grow stupider.  How\nmany fine-looking boys came to us!  In a few years they became repulsive. \nEven at sixteen I wondered at them morosely; even then I was struck by\nthe pettiness of their thoughts, the stupidity of their pursuits, their games,\ntheir conversations.  They had no understanding of such essential things,\nthey took no interest in such striking, impressive subjects, that I could\nnot help considering them inferior to myself.  It was not wounded vanity\nthat drove me to it, and for God’s sake do not thrust upon me your\nhackneyed remarks, repeated to nausea, that “I was only a dreamer,\"\nwhile they even then had an understanding of life.  They understood\nnothing, they had no idea of real life, and I swear that that was what\nmade me most indignant with them.  On the contrary, the most obvious,\nstriking reality they accepted with fantastic stupidity and even at that time\nwere accustomed to respect success.  Everything that was just, but oppressed\nand looked down upon, they laughed at heartlessly and shamefully.\nThey took rank for intelligence; even at sixteen they were already\ntalking about a snug berth.  Of course, a great deal of it was due to their\nstupidity, to the bad examples with which they had always been surrounded\nin their childhood and boyhood.  They were monstrously depraved.\nOf course a great deal of that, too, was superficial and an\nassumption of cynicism; of course there were glimpses of youth and\nfreshness even in their depravity; but even that freshness was not attractive,\nand showed itself in a certain rakishness.  I hated them horribly,\nthough perhaps I was worse than any of them.  They repaid me in the\nsame way, and did not conceal their aversion for me.  But by then I did not\ndesire their affection: on the contrary, I continually longed for their\nhumiliation.  To escape from their derision I purposely began to make all\nthe progress I could with my studies and forced my way to the very top. \nThis impressed them.  Moreover, they all began by degrees to grasp that I\nhad already read books none of them could read, and understood things\n(not forming part of our school curriculum) of which they had not even\nheard.  They took a savage and sarcastic view of it, but were morally\nimpressed, especially as the teachers began to notice me on those\ngrounds.  The mockery ceased, but the hostility remained, and cold and\nstrained relations became permanent between us.  In the end I could not\nput up with it: with years a craving for society, for friends, developed in\nme. I attempted to get on friendly terms with some of my schoolfellows;\nbut somehow or other my intimacy with them was always strained and\nsoon ended of itself.  Once, indeed, I did have a friend.  But I was already\na tyrant at heart; I wanted to exercise unbounded sway over him; I tried to\ninstil into him a contempt for his surroundings; I required of him a\ndisdainful and complete break with those surroundings.  I frightened him\nwith my passionate affection; I reduced him to tears, to hysterics.  He was\na simple and devoted soul; but when he devoted himself to me entirely I\nbegan to hate him immediately and repulsed him—as though all I\nneeded him for was to win a victory over him, to subjugate him and\nnothing else.  But I could not subjugate all of them; my friend was not at\nall like them either, he was, in fact, a rare exception.  The first thing I did\non leaving school was to give up the special job for which I had been\ndestined so as to break all ties, to curse my past and shake the dust from\noff my feet ....  And goodness knows why, after all that, I should go\ntrudging off to Simonov’s!",
        "Early next morning I roused myself and jumped out of bed with\nexcitement, as though it were all about to happen at once.  But I believed\nthat some radical change in my life was coming, and would inevitably\ncome that day.  Owing to its rarity, perhaps, any external event, however\ntrivial, always made me feel as though some radical change in my life\nwere at hand.  I went to the office, however, as usual, but sneaked away\nhome two hours earlier to get ready.  The great thing, I thought, is not to\nbe the first to arrive, or they will think I am overjoyed at coming.  But\nthere were thousands of such great points to consider, and they all\nagitated and overwhelmed me.  I polished my boots a second time with\nmy own hands; nothing in the world would have induced Apollon to\nclean them twice a day, as he considered that it was more than his duties\nrequired of him.  I stole the brushes to clean them from the passage, being\ncareful he should not detect it, for fear of his contempt.  Then I minutely\nexamined my clothes and thought that everything looked old, worn and\nthreadbare.  I had let myself get too slovenly.  My uniform, perhaps, was\ntidy, but I could not go out to dinner in my uniform.  The worst of it was\nthat on the knee of my trousers was a big yellow stain.  I had a foreboding\nthat that stain would deprive me of nine-tenths of my personal dignity.  I\nknew, too, that it was very poor to think so.  “But this is no time for\nthinking: now I am in for the real thing,” I thought, and my heart sank.  I\nknew, too, perfectly well even then, that I was monstrously exaggerating\nthe facts.  But how could I help it?  I could not control myself and was\nalready shaking with fever.  With despair I pictured to myself how coldly\nand disdainfully that “scoundrel” Zverkov would meet me; with what\ndull-witted, invincible contempt the blockhead Trudolyubov would look\nat me; with what impudent rudeness the insect Ferfitchkin would snigger\nat me in order to curry favour with Zverkov; how completely Simonov\nwould take it all in, and how he would despise me for the abjectness of\nmy vanity and lack of spirit—and, worst of all, how paltry, UNLITERARY,\ncommonplace it would all be.  Of course, the best thing would be not to\ngo at all.  But that was most impossible of all: if I feel impelled to do\nanything, I seem to be pitchforked into it.  I should have jeered at myself\never afterwards: “So you funked it, you funked it, you funked the REAL\nTHING!” On the contrary, I passionately longed to show all that “rabble\"\nthat I was by no means such a spiritless creature as I seemed to myself. \nWhat is more, even in the acutest paroxysm of this cowardly fever, I\ndreamed of getting the upper hand, of dominating them, carrying them\naway, making them like me—if only for my “elevation of thought and\nunmistakable wit.”  They would abandon Zverkov, he would sit on one\nside, silent and ashamed, while I should crush him.  Then, perhaps, we\nwould be reconciled and drink to our everlasting friendship; but what was\nmost bitter and humiliating for me was that I knew even then, knew fully\nand for certain, that I needed nothing of all this really, that I did not really\nwant to crush, to subdue, to attract them, and that I did not care a straw\nreally for the result, even if I did achieve it.  Oh, how I prayed for the day\nto pass quickly!  In unutterable anguish I went to the window, opened the\nmovable pane and looked out into the troubled darkness of the thickly\nfalling wet snow.  At last my wretched little clock hissed out five.  I seized\nmy hat and, trying not to look at Apollon, who had been all day\nexpecting his month’s wages, but in his foolishness was unwilling to be\nthe first to speak about it, I slipped between him and the door and,\njumping into a high-class sledge, on which I spent my last half rouble, I\ndrove up in grand style to the Hotel de Paris.",
