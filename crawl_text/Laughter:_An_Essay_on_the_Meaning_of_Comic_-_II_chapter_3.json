        "A man, running along the street, stumbles and falls; the passers-by\nburst out laughing. They would not laugh at him, I imagine, could\nthey suppose that the whim had suddenly seized him to sit down on\nthe ground. They laugh because his sitting down is involuntary.",
        "Consequently, it is not his sudden change of attitude that raises a\nlaugh, but rather the involuntary element in this change,--his\nclumsiness, in fact. Perhaps there was a stone on the road. He\nshould have altered his pace or avoided the obstacle. Instead of\nthat, through lack of elasticity, through absentmindedness and a\nkind of physical obstinacy, AS A RESULT, IN FACT, OF RIGIDITY OR OF\nMOMENTUM, the muscles continued to perform the same movement when\nthe circumstances of the case called for something else. That is the\nreason of the man’s fall, and also of the people’s laughter.",
        "Now, take the case of a person who attends to the petty occupations\nof his everyday life with mathematical precision. The objects around\nhim, however, have all been tampered with by a mischievous wag, the\nresult being that when he dips his pen into the inkstand he draws it\nout all covered with mud, when he fancies he is sitting down on a\nsolid chair he finds himself sprawling on the floor, in a word his\nactions are all topsy-turvy or mere beating the air, while in every\ncase the effect is invariably one of momentum. Habit has given the\nimpulse: what was wanted was to check the movement or deflect it. He\ndid nothing of the sort, but continued like a machine in the same\nstraight line. The victim, then, of a practical joke is in a\nposition similar to that of a runner who falls,--he is comic for the\nsame reason. The laughable element in both cases consists of a\ncertain MECHANICAL INELASTICITY, just where one would expect to find\nthe wide-awake adaptability and the living pliableness of a human\nbeing. The only difference in the two cases is that the former\nhappened of itself, whilst the latter was obtained artificially. In\nthe first instance, the passer-by does nothing but look on, but in\nthe second the mischievous wag intervenes.",
        "All the same, in both cases the result has been brought about by an\nexternal circumstance. The comic is therefore accidental: it\nremains, so to speak, in superficial contact with the person. How is\nit to penetrate within? The necessary conditions will be fulfilled\nwhen mechanical rigidity no longer requires for its manifestation a\nstumbling-block which either the hazard of circumstance or human\nknavery has set in its way, but extracts by natural processes, from\nits own store, an inexhaustible series of opportunities for\nexternally revealing its presence. Suppose, then, we imagine a mind\nalways thinking of what it has just done and never of what it is\ndoing, like a song which lags behind its accompaniment. Let us try\nto picture to ourselves a certain inborn lack of elasticity of both\nsenses and intelligence, which brings it to pass that we continue to\nsee what is no longer visible, to hear what is no longer audible, to\nsay what is no longer to the point: in short, to adapt ourselves to\na past and therefore imaginary situation, when we ought to be\nshaping our conduct in accordance with the reality which is present.\nThis time the comic will take up its abode in the person himself; it\nis the person who will supply it with everything--matter and form,\ncause and opportunity. Is it then surprising that the absent-minded\nindividual--for this is the character we have just been describing--\nhas usually fired the imagination of comic authors? When La Bruyere\ncame across this particular type, he realised, on analysing it, that\nhe had got hold of a recipe for the wholesale manufacture of comic\neffects. As a matter of fact he overdid it, and gave us far too\nlengthy and detailed a description of Menalque, coming back to his\nsubject, dwelling and expatiating on it beyond all bounds. The very\nfacility of the subject fascinated him. Absentmindedness, indeed, is\nnot perhaps the actual fountain-head of the comic, but surely it is\ncontiguous to a certain stream of facts and fancies which flows\nstraight from the fountain-head. It is situated, so to say, on one\nof the great natural watersheds of laughter.",
        "Now, the effect of absentmindedness may gather strength in its turn.\nThere is a general law, the first example of which we have just\nencountered, and which we will formulate in the following terms:\nwhen a certain comic effect has its origin in a certain cause, the\nmore natural we regard the cause to be, the more comic shall we find\nthe effect. Even now we laugh at absentmindedness when presented to\nus as a simple fact. Still more laughable will be the\nabsentmindedness we have seen springing up and growing before our\nvery eyes, with whose origin we are acquainted and whose life-\nhistory we can reconstruct. To choose a definite example: suppose a\nman has taken to reading nothing but romances of love and chivalry.\nAttracted and fascinated by his heroes, his thoughts and intentions\ngradually turn more and more towards them, till one fine day we find\nhim walking among us like a somnambulist. His actions are\ndistractions. But then his distractions can be traced back to a\ndefinite, positive cause. They are no longer cases of ABSENCE of\nmind, pure and simple; they find their explanation in the PRESENCE\nof the individual in quite definite, though imaginary, surroundings.\nDoubtless a fall is always a fall, but it is one thing to tumble\ninto a well because you were looking anywhere but in front of you,\nit is quite another thing to fall into it because you were intent\nupon a star. It was certainly a star at which Don Quixote was\ngazing. How profound is the comic element in the over-romantic,\nUtopian bent of mind! And yet, if you reintroduce the idea of\nabsentmindedness, which acts as a go-between, you will see this\nprofound comic element uniting with the most superficial type. Yes,\nindeed, these whimsical wild enthusiasts, these madmen who are yet\nso strangely reasonable, excite us to laughter by playing on the\nsame chords within ourselves, by setting in motion the same inner\nmechanism, as does the victim of a practical joke or the passer-by\nwho slips down in the street. They, too, are runners who fall and\nsimple souls who are being hoaxed--runners after the ideal who\nstumble over realities, child-like dreamers for whom life delights\nto lie in wait. But, above all, they are past-masters in\nabsentmindedness, with this superiority over their fellows that\ntheir absentmindedness is systematic and organised around one\ncentral idea, and that their mishaps are also quite coherent, thanks\nto the inexorable logic which reality applies to the correction of\ndreams, so that they kindle in those around them, by a series of\ncumulative effects, a hilarity capable of unlimited expansion.",
        "Now, let us go a little further. Might not certain vices have the\nsame relation to character that the rigidity of a fixed idea has to\nintellect? Whether as a moral kink or a crooked twist given to the\nwill, vice has often the appearance of a curvature of the soul.\nDoubtless there are vices into which the soul plunges deeply with\nall its pregnant potency, which it rejuvenates and drags along with\nit into a moving circle of reincarnations. Those are tragic vices.\nBut the vice capable of making us comic is, on the contrary, that\nwhich is brought from without, like a ready-made frame into which we\nare to step. It lends us its own rigidity instead of borrowing from\nus our flexibility. We do not render it more complicated; on the\ncontrary, it simplifies us. Here, as we shall see later on in the\nconcluding section of this study, lies the essential difference\nbetween comedy and drama. A drama, even when portraying passions or\nvices that bear a name, so completely incorporates them in the\nperson that their names are forgotten, their general characteristics\neffaced, and we no longer think of them at all, but rather of the\nperson in whom they are assimilated; hence, the title of a drama can\nseldom be anything else than a proper noun. On the other hand, many\ncomedies have a common noun as their title: l’Avare, le Joueur, etc.\nWere you asked to think of a play capable of being called le Jaloux,\nfor instance, you would find that Sganarelle or George Dandin would\noccur to your mind, but not Othello: le Jaloux could only be the\ntitle of a comedy. The reason is that, however intimately vice, when\ncomic, is associated with persons, it none the less retains its\nsimple, independent existence, it remains the central character,\npresent though invisible, to which the characters in flesh and blood\non the stage are attached. At times it delights in dragging them\ndown with its own weight and making them share in its tumbles. More\nfrequently, however, it plays on them as on an instrument or pulls\nthe strings as though they were puppets. Look closely: you will find\nthat the art of the comic poet consists in making us so well\nacquainted with the particular vice, in introducing us, the\nspectators, to such a degree of intimacy with it, that in the end we\nget hold of some of the strings of the marionette with which he is\nplaying, and actually work them ourselves; this it is that explains\npart of the pleasure we feel. Here, too, it is really a kind of\nautomatism that makes us laugh--an automatism, as we have already\nremarked, closely akin to mere absentmindedness. To realise this\nmore fully, it need only be noted that a comic character is\ngenerally comic in proportion to his ignorance of himself. The comic\nperson is unconscious. As though wearing the ring of Gyges with\nreverse effect, he becomes invisible to himself while remaining\nvisible to all the world. A character in a tragedy will make no\nchange in his conduct because he will know how it is judged by us;\nhe may continue therein, even though fully conscious of what he is\nand feeling keenly the horror he inspires in us. But a defect that\nis ridiculous, as soon as it feels itself to be so, endeavours to\nmodify itself, or at least to appear as though it did. Were Harpagon\nto see us laugh at his miserliness, I do not say that he would get\nrid of it, but he would either show it less or show it differently.\nIndeed, it is in this sense only that laughter “corrects men’s\nmanners.” It makes us at once endeavour to appear what we ought to\nbe, what some day we shall perhaps end in being.",
        "It is unnecessary to carry this analysis any further. From the\nrunner who falls to the simpleton who is hoaxed, from a state of\nbeing hoaxed to one of absentmindedness, from absentmindedness to\nwild enthusiasm, from wild enthusiasm to various distortions of\ncharacter and will, we have followed the line of progress along\nwhich the comic becomes more and more deeply imbedded in the person,\nyet without ceasing, in its subtler manifestations, to recall to us\nsome trace of what we noticed in its grosser forms, an effect of\nautomatism and of inelasticity. Now we can obtain a first glimpse--a\ndistant one, it is true, and still hazy and confused--of the\nlaughable side of human nature and of the ordinary function of\nlaughter.",
        "What life and society require of each of us is a constantly alert\nattention that discerns the outlines of the present situation,\ntogether with a certain elasticity of mind and body to enable us to\nadapt ourselves in consequence. TENSION and ELASTICITY are two\nforces, mutually complementary, which life brings into play. If\nthese two forces are lacking in the body to any considerable extent,\nwe have sickness and infirmity and accidents of every kind. If they\nare lacking in the mind, we find every degree of mental deficiency,\nevery variety of insanity. Finally, if they are lacking in the\ncharacter, we have cases of the gravest inadaptability to social\nlife, which are the sources of misery and at times the causes of\ncrime. Once these elements of inferiority that affect the serious\nside of existence are removed--and they tend to eliminate themselves\nin what has been called the struggle for life--the person can live,\nand that in common with other persons. But society asks for\nsomething more; it is not satisfied with simply living, it insists\non living well. What it now has to dread is that each one of us,\ncontent with paying attention to what affects the essentials of\nlife, will, so far as the rest is concerned, give way to the easy\nautomatism of acquired habits. Another thing it must fear is that\nthe members of whom it is made up, instead of aiming after an\nincreasingly delicate adjustment of wills which will fit more and\nmore perfectly into one another, will confine themselves to\nrespecting simply the fundamental conditions of this adjustment: a\ncut-and-dried agreement among the persons will not satisfy it, it\ninsists on a constant striving after reciprocal adaptation. Society\nwill therefore be suspicious of all INELASTICITY of character, of\nmind and even of body, because it is the possible sign of a\nslumbering activity as well as of an activity with separatist\ntendencies, that inclines to swerve from the common centre round\nwhich society gravitates: in short, because it is the sign of an\neccentricity. And yet, society cannot intervene at this stage by\nmaterial repression, since it is not affected in a material fashion.\nIt is confronted with something that makes it uneasy, but only as a\nsymptom--scarcely a threat, at the very most a gesture. A gesture,\ntherefore, will be its reply. Laughter must be something of this\nkind, a sort of SOCIAL GESTURE. By the fear which it inspires, it\nrestrains eccentricity, keeps constantly awake and in mutual contact\ncertain activities of a secondary order which might retire into\ntheir shell and go to sleep, and, in short, softens down whatever\nthe surface of the social body may retain of mechanical\ninelasticity. Laughter, then, does not belong to the province of\nesthetics alone, since unconsciously (and even immorally in many\nparticular instances) it pursues a utilitarian aim of general\nimprovement. And yet there is something esthetic about it, since the\ncomic comes into being just when society and the individual, freed\nfrom the worry of self-preservation, begin to regard themselves as\nworks of art. In a word, if a circle be drawn round those actions\nand dispositions--implied in individual or social life--to which\ntheir natural consequences bring their own penalties, there remains\noutside this sphere of emotion and struggle--and within a neutral\nzone in which man simply exposes himself to man’s curiosity--a\ncertain rigidity of body, mind and character, that society would\nstill like to get rid of in order to obtain from its members the\ngreatest possible degree of elasticity and sociability. This\nrigidity is the comic, and laughter is its corrective.",
        "Still, we must not accept this formula as a definition of the comic.\nIt is suitable only for cases that are elementary, theoretical and\nperfect, in which the comic is free from all adulteration. Nor do we\noffer it, either, as an explanation. We prefer to make it, if you\nwill, the leitmotiv which is to accompany all our explanations. We\nmust ever keep it in mind, though without dwelling on it too much,\nsomewhat as a skilful fencer must think of the discontinuous\nmovements of the lesson whilst his body is given up to the\ncontinuity of the fencing-match. We will now endeavour to\nreconstruct the sequence of comic forms, taking up again the thread\nthat leads from the horseplay of a clown up to the most refined\neffects of comedy, following this thread in its often unforeseen\nwindings, halting at intervals to look around, and finally getting\nback, if possible, to the point at which the thread is dangling and\nwhere we shall perhaps find--since the comic oscillates between life\nand art--the general relation that art bears to life.",
