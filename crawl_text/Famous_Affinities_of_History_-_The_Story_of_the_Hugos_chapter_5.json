        "\nMary Godwin Wollstonecraft Shelley (1797-1851)\nEnglish novelist, author of Frankenstein\n",
        "\n\n",
        "Victor Hugo, after all criticisms have been made, stands as a\nliterary colossus. He had imaginative power which makes his finest\npassages fairly crash upon the reader’s brain like blasting\nthunderbolts. His novels, even when translated, are read and\nreread by people of every degree of education. There is something\nvast, something almost Titanic, about the grandeur and\ngorgeousness of his fancy. His prose resembles the sonorous blare\nof an immense military band. Readers of English care less for his\npoetry; yet in his verse one can find another phase of his\nintellect. He could write charmingly, in exquisite cadences, poems\nfor lovers and for little children. His gifts were varied, and he\nknew thoroughly the life and thought of his own countrymen; and,\ntherefore, in his later days he was almost deified by them.",
        "At the same time, there were defects in his intellect and\ncharacter which are perceptible in what he wrote, as well as in\nwhat he did. He had the Gallic wit in great measure, but he was\nabsolutely devoid of any sense of humor. This is why, in both his\nprose and his poetry, his most tremendous pages often come\nperilously near to bombast; and this is why, again, as a man, his\nvanity was almost as great as his genius. He had good reason to be\nvain, and yet, if he had possessed a gleam of humor, he would\nnever have allowed his egoism to make him arrogant. As it was, he\nfelt himself exalted above other mortals. Whatever he did or said\nor wrote was right because he did it or said it or wrote it.",
        "This often showed itself in rather whimsical ways. Thus, after he\nhad published the first edition of his novel, The Man Who Laughs,\nan English gentleman called upon him, and, after some courteous\ncompliments, suggested that in subsequent editions the name of an\nEnglish peer who figures in the book should be changed from Tom\nJim-Jack.",
        "“For,” said the Englishman, “Tom Jim-Jack is a name that could not\npossibly belong to an English noble, or, indeed, to any\nEnglishman. The presence of it in your powerful story makes it\nseem to English readers a little grotesque.”",
        "Victor Hugo drew himself up with an air of high disdain.",
        "“Who are you?” asked he.",
        "“I am an Englishman,” was the answer, “and naturally I know what\nnames are possible in English.”",
        "Hugo drew himself up still higher, and on his face there was a\nsmile of utter contempt.",
        "“Yes,” said he. “You are an Englishman; but I–I am Victor Hugo.”",
        "In another book Hugo had spoken of the Scottish bagpipes as\n“bugpipes.” This gave some offense to his Scottish admirers. A\ngreat many persons told him that the word was “bagpipes,” and not\n“bugpipes.” But he replied with irritable obstinacy:",
        "“I am Victor Hugo; and if I choose to write it ’bugpipes,’ it IS\n’bugpipes.’ It is anything that I prefer to make it. It is so,\nbecause I call it so!”",
        "So, Victor Hugo became a violent republican, because he did not\nwish France to be an empire or a kingdom, in which an emperor or a\nking would be his superior in rank. He always spoke of Napoleon\nIII as “M. Bonaparte.” He refused to call upon the gentle-mannered\nEmperor of Brazil, because he was an emperor; although Dom Pedro\nexpressed an earnest desire to meet the poet.",
        "When the German army was besieging Paris, Hugo proposed to fight a\nduel with the King of Prussia, and to have the result of it settle\nthe war; “for,” said he, “the King of Prussia is a great king, but\nI am Victor Hugo, the great poet. We are, therefore, equal.”",
        "In spite, however, of his ardent republicanism, he was very fond\nof speaking of his own noble descent. Again and again he styled\nhimself “a peer of France;” and he and his family made frequent\nallusions to the knights and bishops and counselors of state with\nwhom he claimed an ancestral relation. This was more than\ninconsistent. It was somewhat ludicrous; because Victor Hugo’s\nancestry was by no means noble. The Hugos of the fifteenth and\nsixteenth centuries were not in any way related to the poet’s\nfamily, which was eminently honest and respectable, but by no\nmeans one of distinction. His grandfather was a carpenter. One of\nhis aunts was the wife of a baker, another of a barber, while the\nthird earned her living as a provincial dressmaker.",
        "If the poet had been less vain and more sincerely democratic, he\nwould have been proud to think that he sprang from good, sound,\nsturdy stock, and would have laughed at titles. As it was, he\njeered at all pretensions of rank in other men, while he claimed\nfor himself distinctions that were not really his. His father was\na soldier who rose from the ranks until, under Napoleon, he\nreached the grade of general. His mother was the daughter of a\nship owner in Nantes.",
        "Victor Hugo was born in February, 1802, during the Napoleonic\nwars, and his early years were spent among the camps and within\nthe sound of the cannon-thunder. It was fitting that he should\nhave been born and reared in an age of upheaval, revolt, and\nbattle. He was essentially the laureate of revolt; and in some of\nhis novels–as in Ninety-Three–the drum and the trumpet roll and\nring through every chapter.",
        "The present paper has, of course, nothing to do with Hugo’s public\nlife; yet it is necessary to remember the complicated nature of\nthe man–all his power, all his sweetness of disposition, and\nlikewise all his vanity and his eccentricities. We must remember,\nalso, that he was French, so that his story may be interpreted in\nthe light of the French character.",
        "At the age of fifteen he was domiciled in Paris, and though still\na schoolboy and destined for the study of law, he dreamed only of\npoetry and of literature. He received honorable mention from the\nFrench Academy in 1817, and in the following year took prizes in a\npoetical competition. At seventeen he began the publication of a\nliterary journal, which survived until 1821. His astonishing\nenergy became evident in the many publications which he put forth\nin these boyish days. He began to become known. Although poetry,\nthen as now, was not very profitable even when it was admired, one\nof his slender volumes brought him the sum of seven hundred\nfrancs, which seemed to him not only a fortune in itself, but the\nforerunner of still greater prosperity.",
        "It was at this time, while still only twenty years of age, that he\nmet a young girl of eighteen with whom he fell rather\ntempestuously in love. Her name was Adele Foucher, and she was the\ndaughter of a clerk in the War Office. When one is very young and\nalso a poet, it takes very little to feed the flame of passion.\nVictor Hugo was often a guest at the apartments of M. Foucher,\nwhere he was received by that gentleman and his family. French\netiquette, of course, forbade any direct communication between the\nvisitor and Adele. She was still a very young girl, and was\nsupposed to take no share in the conversation. Therefore, while\nthe others talked, she sat demurely by the fireside and sewed.",
        "Her dark eyes and abundant hair, her grace of manner, and the\npicture which she made as the firelight played about her, kindled\na flame in the susceptible heart of Victor Hugo. Though he could\nnot speak to her, he at least could look at her; and, before long,\nhis share in the conversation was very slight. This was set down,\nat first, to his absent-mindedness; but looks can be as eloquent\nas spoken words. Mme. Foucher, with a woman’s keen intelligence,\nnoted the adoring gaze of Victor Hugo as he silently watched her\ndaughter. The young Adele herself was no less intuitive than her\nmother. It was very well understood, in the course of a few\nmonths, that Victor Hugo was in love with Adele Foucher.",
        "Her father and mother took counsel about the matter, and Hugo\nhimself, in a burst of lyrical eloquence, confessed that he adored\nAdele and wished to marry her. Her parents naturally objected. The\ngirl was but a child. She had no dowry, nor had Victor Hugo any\nsettled income. They were not to think of marriage. But when did a\ncommon-sense decision, such as this, ever separate a man and a\nwoman who have felt the thrill of first love! Victor Hugo was\ninsistent. With his supreme self-confidence, he declared that he\nwas bound to be successful, and that in a very short time he would\nbe illustrious. Adele, on her side, created “an atmosphere” at\nhome by weeping frequently, and by going about with hollow eyes\nand wistful looks.",
        "The Foucher family removed from Paris to a country town. Victor\nHugo immediately followed them. Fortunately for him, his poems had\nattracted the attention of Louis XVIII, who was flattered by some\nof the verses. He sent Hugo five hundred francs for an ode, and\nsoon afterward settled upon him a pension of a thousand francs.\nHere at least was an income–a very small one, to be sure, but\nstill an income. Perhaps Adele’s father was impressed not so much\nby the actual money as by the evidence of the royal favor. At any\nrate, he withdrew his opposition, and the two young people were\nmarried in October, 1822–both of them being under age, unformed,\nand immature.",
        "Their story is another warning against too early marriage. It is\ntrue that they lived together until Mme. Hugo’s death–a married\nlife of forty-six years–yet their story presents phases which\nwould have made this impossible had they not been French.",
        "For a time, Hugo devoted all his energies to work. The record of\nhis steady upward progress is a part of the history of literature,\nand need not be repeated here. The poet and his wife were soon\nable to leave the latter’s family abode, and to set up their own\nhousehold god in a home which was their own. Around them there\nwere gathered, in a sort of salon, all the best-known writers of\nthe day–dramatists, critics, poets, and romancers. The Hugos knew\neverybody.",
        "Unfortunately, one of their visitors cast into their new life a\ndrop of corroding bitterness. This intruder was Charles Augustin\nSainte-Beuve, a man two years younger than Victor Hugo, and one\nwho blended learning, imagination, and a gift of critical\nanalysis. Sainte-Beuve is to-day best remembered as a critic, and\nhe was perhaps the greatest critic ever known in France. But in\n1830 he was a slender, insinuating youth who cultivated a gift for\nsensuous and somewhat morbid poetry.",
        "He had won Victor Hugo’s friendship by writing an enthusiastic\nnotice of Hugo’s dramatic works. Hugo, in turn, styled Sainte-\nBeuve “an eagle,” “a blazing star,” and paid him other compliments\nno less gorgeous and Hugoesque. But in truth, if Sainte-Beuve\nfrequented the Hugo salon, it was less because of his admiration\nfor the poet than from his desire to win the love of the poet’s\nwife.",
        "It is quite impossible to say how far he attracted the serious\nattention of Adele Hugo. Sainte-Beuve represents a curious type,\nwhich is far more common in France and Italy than in the countries\nof the north. Human nature is not very different in cultivated\ncircles anywhere. Man loves, and seeks to win the object of his\nlove; or, as the old English proverb has it:",
        "But only in the Latin countries do men who have tried make their\nattempts public, and seek to produce an impression that they have\nbeen successful, and that the woman has not denied. This sort of\nman, in English-speaking lands, is set down simply as a cad, and\nis excluded from people’s houses; but in some other countries the\nthing is regarded with a certain amount of toleration. We see it\nin the two books written respectively by Alfred de Musset and\nGeorge Sand. We have seen it still later in our own times, in that\nstrange and half-repulsive story in which the Italian novelist and\npoet, Gabriele d’Annunzio, under a very thin disguise, revealed\nhis relations with the famous actress, Eleanora Duse. Anglo-Saxons\nthrust such books aside with a feeling of disgust for the man who\ncould so betray a sacred confidence and perhaps exaggerate a\nsimple indiscretion into actual guilt. But it is not so in France\nand Italy. And this is precisely what Sainte-Beuve attempted.",
        "Dr. George McLean Harper, in his lately published study of Sainte-\nBeuve, has summed the matter up admirably, in speaking of The Book\nof Love:",
        "He had the vein of emotional self-disclosure, the vein of romantic\nor sentimental confession. This last was not a rich lode, and so\nhe was at pains to charge it secretly with ore which he exhumed\ngloatingly, but which was really base metal. The impulse that led\nhim along this false route was partly ambition, partly sensuality.\nMany a worse man would have been restrained by self-respect and\ngood taste. And no man with a sense of honor would have permitted\nThe Book of Love to see the light–a small collection of verses\nrecording his passion for Mme. Hugo, and designed to implicate\nher.",
        "He left two hundred and five printed copies of this book to be\ndistributed after his death. A virulent enemy of Sainte-Beuve was\nnot too expressive when he declared that its purpose was “to leave\non the life of this woman the gleaming and slimy trace which the\npassage of a snail leaves on a rose.” Abominable in either case,\nwhether or not the implication was unfounded, Sainte-Beuve’s\nnumerous innuendoes in regard to Mme. Hugo are an indelible stain\non his memory, and his infamy not only cost him his most precious\nfriendships, but crippled him in every high endeavor.",
        "How monstrous was this violation of both friendship and love may\nbe seen in the following quotation from his writings:",
        "In that inevitable hour, when the gloomy tempest and the jealous\ngulf shall roll over our heads, a sealed bottle, belched forth\nfrom the abyss, will render immortal our two names, their close\nalliance, and our double memory aspiring after union.",
        "Whether or not Mme. Hugo’s relations with Sainte-Beuve justified\nthe latter even in thinking such thoughts as these, one need not\ninquire too minutely. Evidently, though, Victor Hugo could no\nlonger be the friend of the man who almost openly boasted that he\nhad dishonored him. There exist some sharp letters which passed\nbetween Hugo and Sainte-Beuve. Their intimacy was ended.",
        "But there was something more serious than this. Sainte-Beuve had\nin fact succeeded in leaving a taint upon the name of Victor\nHugo’s wife. That Hugo did not repudiate her makes it fairly plain\nthat she was innocent; yet a high-spirited, sensitive soul like\nHugo’s could never forget that in the world’s eye she was\ncompromised. The two still lived together as before; but now the\npoet felt himself released from the strict obligations of the\nmarriage-bond.",
        "It may perhaps be doubted whether he would in any case have\nremained faithful all his life. He was, as Mr. H.W. Wack well\nsays, “a man of powerful sensations, physically as well as\nmentally. Hugo pursued every opportunity for new work, new\nsensations, fresh emotion. He desired to absorb as much on life’s\neager forward way as his great nature craved. His range in all\nthings–mental, physical, and spiritual–was so far beyond the\nordinary that the gage of average cannot be applied to him. The\ncavil of the moralist did not disturb him.”",
        "Hence, it is not improbable that Victor Hugo might have broken\nthrough the bonds of marital fidelity, even had Sainte-Beuve never\nwritten his abnormal poems; but certainly these poems hastened a\nresult which may or may not have been otherwise inevitable. Hugo\nno longer turned wholly to the dark-haired, dark-eyed Adele as\nsumming up for him the whole of womanhood. A veil was drawn, as it\nwere, from before his eyes, and he looked on other women and found\nthem beautiful.",
        "It was in 1833, soon after Hugo’s play “Lucrece Borgia” had been\naccepted for production, that a lady called one morning at Hugo’s\nhouse in the Place Royale. She was then between twenty and thirty\nyears of age, slight of figure, winsome in her bearing, and one\nwho knew the arts which appeal to men. For she was no\ninexperienced ingenue. The name upon her visiting-card was “Mme.\nDrouet\"; and by this name she had been known in Paris as a clever\nand somewhat gifted actress. Theophile Gautier, whose cult was the\nworship of physical beauty, wrote in almost lyric prose of her\nseductive charm.",
        "At nineteen, after she had been cast upon the world, dowered with\nthat terrible combination, poverty and beauty, she had lived\nopenly with a sculptor named Pradier. This has a certain\nimportance in the history of French art. Pradier had received a\ncommission to execute a statue representing Strasburg–the statue\nwhich stands to-day in the Place de la Concorde, and which\npatriotic Frenchmen and Frenchwomen drape in mourning and half\nbury in immortelles, in memory of that city of Alsace which so\nlong was French, but which to-day is German–one of Germany’s\ngreat prizes taken in the war of 1870.",
        "Five years before her meeting with Hugo, Pradier had rather\nbrutally severed his connection with her, and she had accepted the\nprotection of a Russian nobleman. At this time she was known by\nher real name–Julienne Josephine Gauvin; but having gone upon the\nstage, she assumed the appellation by which she was thereafter\nknown, that of Juliette Drouet.",
        "Her visit to Hugo was for the purpose of asking him to secure for\nher a part in his forth-coming play. The dramatist was willing,\nbut unfortunately all the major characters had been provided for,\nand he was able to offer her only the minor one of the Princesse\nNegroni. The charming deference with which she accepted the\noffered part attracted Hugo’s attention. Such amiability is very\nrare in actresses who have had engagements at the best theaters.\nHe resolved to see her again; and he did so, time after time,\nuntil he was thoroughly captivated by her.",
        "She knew her value, and as yet was by no means infatuated with\nhim. At first he was to her simply a means of getting on in her\nprofession–simply another influential acquaintance. Yet she\nbrought to bear upon him the arts at her command, her beauty and\nher sympathy, and, last of all, her passionate abandonment.",
        "Hugo was overwhelmed by her. He found that she was in debt, and he\nmanaged to see that her debts were paid. He secured her other\nengagements at the theater, though she was less successful as an\nactress after she knew him. There came, for a time, a short break\nin their relations; for, partly out of need, she returned to her\nRussian nobleman, or at least admitted him to a menage a trois.\nHugo underwent for a second time a great disillusionment.\nNevertheless, he was not too proud to return to her and to beg her\nnot to be unfaithful any more. Touched by his tears, and perhaps\nforeseeing his future fame, she gave her promise, and she kept it\nuntil her death, nearly half a century later.",
        "Perhaps because she had deceived him once, Hugo never completely\nlost his prudence in his association with her. He was by no means\nlavish with money, and he installed her in a rather simple\napartment only a short distance from his own home. He gave her an\nallowance that was relatively small, though later he provided for\nher amply in his will. But it was to her that he brought all his\nconfidences, to her he entrusted all his interests. She became to\nhim, thenceforth, much more than she appeared to the world at\nlarge; for she was his friend, and, as he said, his inspiration.",
        "The fact of their intimate connection became gradually known\nthrough Paris. It was known even to Mme. Hugo; but she,\nremembering the affair of Sainte-Beuve, or knowing how difficult\nit is to check the will of a man like Hugo, made no sign, and even\nreceived Juliette Drouet in her own house and visited her in turn.\nWhen the poet’s sons grew up to manhood, they, too, spent many\nhours with their father in the little salon of the former actress.\nIt was a strange and, to an Anglo-Saxon mind, an almost impossible\nposition; yet France forgives much to genius, and in time no one\nthought of commenting on Hugo’s manner of life.",
        "In 1851, when Napoleon III seized upon the government, and when\nHugo was in danger of arrest, she assisted him to escape in\ndisguise, and with a forged passport, across the Belgian frontier.\nDuring his long exile in Guernsey she lived in the same close\nrelationship to him and to his family. Mme. Hugo died in 1868,\nhaving known for thirty-three years that she was only second in\nher husband’s thoughts. Was she doing penance, or was she merely\naccepting the inevitable? In any case, her position was most\npathetic, though she uttered no complaint.",
        "A very curious and poignant picture of her just before her death\nhas been given by the pen of a visitor in Guernsey. He had met\nHugo and his sons; he had seen the great novelist eating enormous\nslices of roast beef and drinking great goblets of red wine at\ndinner, and he had also watched him early each morning, divested\nof all his clothing and splashing about in a bath-tub on the top\nof his house, in view of all the town. One evening he called and\nfound only Mme. Hugo. She was reclining on a couch, and was\nevidently suffering great pain. Surprised, he asked where were her\nhusband and her sons.",
        "“Oh,” she replied, “they’ve all gone to Mme. Drouet’s to spend the\nevening and enjoy themselves. Go also; you’ll not find it amusing\nhere.”",
        "One ponders over this sad scene with conflicting thoughts. Was\nthere really any truth in the story at which Sainte-Beuve more\nthan hinted? If so, Adele Hugo was more than punished. The other\nwoman had sinned far more; and yet she had never been Hugo’s wife;\nand hence perhaps it was right that she should suffer less. Suffer\nshe did; for after her devotion to Hugo had become sincere and\ndeep, he betrayed her confidence by an intrigue with a girl who is\nspoken of as “Claire.” The knowledge of it caused her infinite\nanguish, but it all came to an end; and she lived past her\neightieth year, long after the death of Mme. Hugo. She died only a\nshort time before the poet himself was laid to rest in Paris with\nmagnificent obsequies which an emperor might have envied. In her\nold age, Juliette Drouet became very white and very wan; yet she\nnever quite lost the charm with which, as a girl, she had won the\nheart of Hugo.",
        "The story has many aspects. One may see in it a retribution, or\none may see in it only the cruelty of life. Perhaps it is best\nregarded simply as a chapter in the strange life-histories of men\nof genius.",
