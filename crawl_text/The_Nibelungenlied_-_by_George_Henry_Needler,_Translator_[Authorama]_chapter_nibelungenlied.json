        "This translation of the Nibelungenlied is published with the simple\npurpose of placing one of the world’s great epic poems within the reach\nof English readers. Translations are at best but poor substitutes for\noriginals. A new translation of a poem implies also a criticism of those\nthat have preceded it. My apology for presenting this new English version\nof the Nibelungenlied is that none of those hitherto made has reproduced\nthe metrical form of the original. In the hope of making the outlines of\nthe poem clearer for the modern reader, I have endeavored to supply in\nthe Introduction a historical background by summing up the results of\ninvestigation into its origin and growth. The translation itself was\nbegun many years ago, when I studied the original under Zarncke in\nLeipzig.",

        "All the Aryan peoples have had their heroic age, the achievements of\nwhich form the basis of later saga. For the Germans this was the period\nof the Migrations, as it is called, in round numbers the two hundred\nyears from 400 to 600, at the close of which we find them settled in\nthose regions which they have, generally speaking, occupied ever since.\nDuring these two centuries kaleidoscopic changes had been taking place in\nthe position of the various Germanic tribes. Impelled partly by a native\nlove of wandering, partly by the pressure of hostile peoples of other\nrace, they moved with astonishing rapidity hither and thither over the\nface of Europe, generally in conflict with one another or buffeted by the\nRomans in the west and south, and by the Huns in the east. In this stern\nstruggle for existence and search for a permanent place of settlement\nsome of them even perished utterly; amid the changing fortunes of all of\nthem deeds were performed that fixed themselves in the memory of the\nwhole people, great victories or great disasters became the subject of\nstory and song. We need only to recall such names as those of Ermanric\nand Theodoric to remind ourselves what an important part was played by\nthe Germanic peoples of that Migration Period in the history of Europe.\nDuring it a national consciousness was engendered, and in it we have the\nfaint beginnings of a national literature. Germanic saga rests almost\nentirely upon the events of these two centuries, the fifth and sixth.\nAlthough we get glimpses of the Germans during the four or five preceding\ncenturies, none of the historic characters of those earlier times have\nbeen preserved in the national sagas.",
        "With these sagas based on history, however, have been mingled in most\ncases primeval Germanic myths, possessions of the people from prehistoric\ntimes. A most conspicuous example of this union of mythical and\noriginally historical elements is the Nibelungen saga, out of which grew\nin course of time the great national epic, the Nibelungenlied.",
        "The Nibelungen saga is made up of two parts, on the one hand the mythical\nstory of Siegfried and on the other the story, founded on historic fact,\nof the Burgundians. When and how the Siegfried myth arose it is\nimpossible to say; its origin takes us back into the impenetrable mists\nof the unrecorded life of our Germanic forefathers, and its form was\nmoulded by the popular poetic spirit. The other part of the saga is based\nupon the historic incident of the overthrow of the Burgundian kingdom by\nthe Huns in the year 437. This annihilation of a whole tribe naturally\nimpressed itself vividly upon the imagination of contemporaries. Then the\nfact of history soon began to pass over into the realm of legend, and,\nfrom causes which can no longer be determined, this tradition of the\nvanished Burgundians became united with the mythical story of Siegfried.\nThis composite Siegfried-Burgundian saga then became a common possession\nof the Germanic peoples, was borne with many of them to lands far distant\nfrom the place of its origin, and was further moulded by each according\nto its peculiar genius and surroundings. In the Icelandic Eddas, the\noldest of which we have as they were written down in the latter part of\nthe ninth century, are preserved the earliest records of the form it had\ntaken among the northern Germanic peoples. Our Nibelungenlied, which is\nthe chief source of our knowledge of the story as it developed in\nGermany, dates from about the year 1200. These two versions, the Northern\nand the German, though originating in this common source, had diverged\nvery widely in the centuries that elapsed between their beginning and the\ntime when the manuscripts were written in which they are preserved. Each\ncurtailed, re-arranged, or enlarged the incidents of the story in its own\nway. The character of the chief actors and the motives underlying what we\nmay call the dramatic development assumed widely dissimilar forms. The\nGerman Nibelungenlied may be read and appreciated as one of the world’s\ngreat epic poems without an acquaintance on the part of the reader with\nthe Northern version of the saga. In order, however, to furnish the\nsetting for a few episodes that would in that case remain either obscure\nor colorless, and with a view to placing the readers of this translation\nin a position to judge better the deeper significance of the epic as the\neloquent narrative of a thousand years of the life of the people among\nwhom it grew, the broad outlines of the saga in its Northern form will be\ngiven here.",
        "Starting at the middle of the fifth century from the territory about\nWorms on the Rhine where the Burgundians were overthrown, the saga soon\nspread from the Franks to the other Germanic peoples. We have evidence of\nits presence in northern Germany and Denmark. Allusions to it in the\nAnglo-Saxon poem, the Wanderer, of the seventh century and in the great\nAnglo-Saxon epic Beowulf of a short time later, show us that it had\nearly become part of the national saga stock in England. Among the people\nof Norway and Iceland it took root and grew with particular vigor. Here,\nfarthest away from its original home and least exposed to outward\ninfluences, it preserved on the whole most fully its heathen Germanic\ncharacter, especially in its mythical part. By a fortunate turn of\nevents, too, the written record of it here is of considerably earlier\ndate than that which we have from Germany. The Eddas, as the extensive\ncollection of early Icelandic poems is called, are the fullest record of\nGermanic mythology and saga that has been handed down to us, and in them\nthe saga of Siegfried and the Nibelungen looms up prominently. The\nearliest of these poems date from about the year 850, and the most\nimportant of them were probably written down within a couple of centuries\nof that time. They are thus in part some three centuries older than the\nGerman Nibelungenlied, and on the whole, too, they preserve more of the\noriginal outlines of the saga. By bringing together the various episodes\nof the saga from the Eddas and the Volsung saga, a prose account of the\nmythical race of the Volsungs, we arrive at the following narrative.",
        "On their wanderings through the world the three gods Odin, Honir, and\nLoki come to a waterfall where an otter is devouring a fish that it has\ncaught. Loki kills the otter with a stone, and they take off its skin. In\nthe evening they seek a lodging at the house of Hreidmar, to whom they\nshow the skin. Hreidmar recognizes it as that of his son, whom Loki has\nkilled when he had taken on the form of an otter. Assisted by his sons\nFafnir and Regin, Hreidmar seizes the three gods, and spares their lives\nonly on the promise that they will fill the skin, and also cover it\noutwardly, with gold. Loki is sent to procure the ransom. With a net\nborrowed from the sea-goddess Ran he catches at the waterfall the dwarf\nAndvari in form of a fish and compels him to supply the required gold.\nAndvari tries to keep back a ring, but this also Loki takes from him,\nwhereupon the dwarf utters a curse upon the gold and whosoever may\npossess it. The ransom is now paid to Hreidmar; even the ring must, on\nHreidmar’s demand, be given in order to complete the covering of the\notter’s skin. Loki tells him of the curse connected with the ownership of\nthe gold. When Hreidmar refuses Fafnir and Regin a share in the treasure,\nhe is killed by Fafnir, who takes possession of the hoard to the\nexclusion of Regin. In the form of a dragon Fafnir dwells on Gnita Heath\nguarding the hoard, while Regin broods revenge.",
        "From Odin is descended King Volsung, who has a family of ten sons and one\ndaughter. The eldest son is Sigmund, twin-born with his sister Signy.\nKing Siggeir of Gautland sues for the hand of Signy, whom her father\ngives to Siggeir against her will. In the midst of King Volsung’s hall\nstood a mighty oak-tree. As the wedding-feast is being held there enters\na stranger, an old man with one eye, his hat drawn down over his face and\nbearing in his hand a sword. This sword he thrusts to the hilt into the\ntree, saying that it shall belong to him who can draw it out again; after\nwhich he disappears as he had come. All the guests try their strength in\nvain upon the sword, but Sigmund alone is able to draw it forth. He\nrefuses to sell it to Siggeir for all his proffered gold. Siggeir plans\nvengeance. He invites Volsung and his sons to Gautland, and returns home\nthither with his bride Signy, who before going warns her father to be\nupon his guard.",
        "At the appointed time King Volsung and his sons go as invited to\nGautland. In spite of Signy’s repeated warning he will not flee from\ndanger, and falls in combat with Siggeir; his ten sons are taken\nprisoners, and placed in stocks in the forest. For nine successive nights\na she-wolf comes and devours each night one of them, till only Sigmund\nremains. By the aid of Signy he escapes. The she-wolf, it was said, was\nthe mother of Siggeir.",
        "To Sigmund, who has hidden in a wood, Signy sends her eldest boy of ten\nyears that Sigmund may test his courage and see if he is fit to be a\nhelper in seeking revenge. Neither he, however, nor his younger brother\nstands the test. Signy sees that only a scion of the race of Volsung will\nsuffice, and accordingly disguises herself and lives three days with\nSigmund in the wood. From their union a son Sinfiotli is born, whom also,\nafter ten years, she sends out to Sigmund. He stands every test of\ncourage, and is trained by Sigmund, who thinks he is Siggeir’s son.",
        "Bent on revenge, Sigmund repairs with Sinfiotli to Siggeir’s castle.\nAfter Sinfiotli has slain the king’s two sons, he and Sigmund are\noverpowered and condemned to be buried alive. With Sigmund’s sword,\nhowever, which Signy has managed to place in their hands, they cut their\nway out, then set fire to Siggeir’s hall. Signy comes forth and reveals\nto Sigmund that Sinfiotli is their own son; and then, saying that her\nwork of revenge is complete and that she can live no longer, she returns\ninto the burning hall and perishes with Siggeir and all his race.",
        "Sigmund now returns home and rules as a mighty king. He marries Borghild,\nwho later kills Sinfiotli with a poisoned drink, and is cast away by\nSigmund. He then marries Hjordis. Lyngvi, the son of King Hunding, was\nalso a suitor and now invades Sigmund’s land. The latter hews down many\nof his enemies, until an old man with one eye, in hat and dark cloak,\ninterposes his spear, against which Sigmund’s sword breaks in two.\nSigmund falls severely wounded.",
        "In the night Hjordis seeks the scene of the combat and finds Sigmund\nstill alive. He refuses to allow her to heal his wounds, saying that Odin\nno longer wills that he swing the sword. He tells Hjordis to preserve\ncarefully the pieces of the broken sword; the son she bears in her womb\nshall yet swing the sword when welded anew, and win thereby a glorious\nname. At dawn Sigmund dies. Hjordis is borne off by Vikings and, after\nthe birth of her son, she becomes the wife of the Danish prince Alf.",
        "The son of Hjordis was called Sigurd. He grew up a boy of wondrous\nstrength and beauty, with eyes that sparkled brightly, and lived at the\ncourt of King Hjalprek, the father of Alf. Regin, the dwarfish brother of\nFafnir, was his tutor. Regin welds together the pieces of the broken\nsword Gram, so sharp and strong that with it Sigurd cleaves Regin’s anvil\nin twain. With men and ships that he has received from King Hjalprek\nSigurd goes against the sons of Hunding, whom he slays, thereby avenging\nthe death of his father. Regin has urged him to kill Fafnir and take\npossession of the hoard. On the Gnita Heath he digs a ditch from which,\nas the dragon Fafnir passes over it, he plunges the sword into his heart.\nThe dying Fafnir warns him of the curse attached to the possession of the\ngold; also that Regin is to be guarded against. The latter bids him roast\nthe heart of Fafnir. While doing so he burns his finger by dipping it in\nthe blood to see if the heart is done, and to cool his finger puts it\ninto his mouth. Suddenly he is able to understand the language of the\nbirds in the wood. They warn him to beware of Regin, whom he straightway\nslays. The birds tell him further of the beautiful valkyrie Brynhild, who\nsleeps on the fire-encircled mountain awaiting her deliverer. Then Sigurd\nplaces Fafnir’s hoard upon his steed Grani, takes with him also Fafnir’s\nhelm, and rides away to Frankenland. He sees a mountain encircled by a\nzone of fire, makes his way into it and beholds there, as he deems it, a\nman in full armor asleep. When he takes off the helmet he finds that it\nis a woman. With his sword he cuts loose the armor. The woman wakes and\nasks if it be the hero Sigurd who has awakened her. In joy that it is so,\nBrynhild relates to him how Odin had punished her by this magic sleep for\ndisobedience, and how that she had yet obtained from him the promise that\nshe should be wakened only by a hero who knew no fear. She now teaches\nSigurd many wise runes, and tells him of harm to fear through love of\nher. In spite of all, however, Sigurd does not waver, and they swear an\noath of mutual faithful love.",
        "Next Sigurd comes to King Gjuki at the Rhine, and joins in friendship\nwith him and his sons Gunnar and Hogni. Queen Grimhild gives Sigurd a\npotion which causes him to forget Brynhild and be filled with love for\nher own daughter Gudrun, whom he marries. Gunnar now seeks Brynhild for\nwife, and Sigurd goes with him on his wooing-journey. They come to the\ncastle encircled by fire, where Brynhild lives. She will be wooed only by\nhim who will ride to her through the flames. Gunnar tries in vain to do\nthis, even when mounted on Sigurd’s steed Grani. Sigurd and Gunnar then\nexchange shapes and the former spurs Grani through the flames. He calls\nhimself Gunnar the son of Gjuki, and finally Brynhild consents to become\nhis wife. Three nights he shares her couch, but always his sharp sword\nlies between them. He takes the ring from her finger and places in its\nstead one from Fafnir’s treasure. Then he exchanges form again with\nGunnar, who is soon after wedded to Brynhild. Only now does Sigurd\nrecollect the oath that he once swore to Brynhild himself.",
        "One day Brynhild and Gudrun are bathing in the Rhine. A quarrel arises\nbetween them when Brynhild takes precedence of Gudrun by going into the\nwater above her in the stream, saying that her husband is a braver and\nmightier man than Gudrun’s. Gudrun retorts by revealing the secret that\nit was Sigurd in Gunnar’s form, and not Gunnar himself, who rode through\nthe flame, and in proof thereof shows her the ring taken by Sigurd from\nBrynhild’s finger. Pale as death, Brynhild goes quietly home: Gunnar must\ndie, she says in wrath. Sigurd tries to pacify her, even offering to\ndesert Gudrun. Now she will have neither him nor another, and when Gunnar\nappears she demands of him Sigurd’s death. In spite of Hogni’s protest\nGunnar’s stepbrother Gutthorm, who has not sworn blood-friendship with\nSigurd, is got to do the deed. He is given the flesh of wolf and serpent\nto eat in order to make him savage. Twice Gutthorm goes to kill Sigurd,\nbut cowers before the piercing glance of his eyes; at last he steals upon\nSigurd asleep and thrusts his sword through him. The dying Sigurd hurls\nthe sword after the fleeing murderer and cuts him in two. To Gudrun, who\nwakes from sleep by his side, he points to Brynhild as the instigator of\nthe crime, and dies. Brynhild rejoices at the sound of Gudrun’s wailing.\nGudrun cannot find relief for her grief, the tears will not flow. Men and\nwomen seek to console her by tales of greater woes befallen them. But\nstill Gudrun cannot weep as she sits by Sigurd’s corpse. At last one of\nthe women lifts the cloth from Sigurd’s face and lays his head upon\nGudrun’s lap. Then Gudrun gazes on his blood-besmirched hair, his dimmed\neyes, and breast pierced by the sword: she sinks down upon the couch and\na flood of tears bursts at length from her eyes.",
        "Brynhild now tells Gunnar that Sigurd had really kept faith with him on\nthe wooing journey; but she will live with him no longer and pierces\nherself with a sword, after foretelling to Gunnar his future fate and\nthat of Gudrun. In accord with her own request she is burned on one\nfuneral-pyre with Sigurd, the sword between them as once before.",
        "Atli,[1] king of the Huns, now seeks Gudrun for wife. She refuses, but\nGrimhild gives her a potion which causes her to forget Sigurd and the\npast, and then she becomes the wife of Atli. After Sigurd’s death Gunnar\nhad taken possession of the Niflungen hoard, and this Atli now covets. He\ntreacherously invites Gunnar and the others to visit him, which they do\nin spite of Gudrun’s warnings, first of all, however, sinking the hoard\nin the Rhine. On their arrival Atli demands of them the hoard, which, he\nsays, belongs of right to Gudrun. On their refusal he attacks them. Hosts\nof fighters on both sides fall and in the end Gunnar and Hogni, the only\ntwo of their number remaining, are bound in fetters. Gunnar refuses\nAtli’s command to reveal the hiding-place of the hoard, bidding them\nbring to him the heart of Hogni. They kill a servant and bring his heart\nto Gunnar; but Gunnar sees how it still quivers with fear, and knows it\nis not the heart of the fearless Hogni. Then the latter is really killed,\nand his heart is brought to Gunnar, who cries exultingly that now only\nthe Rhine knows where the hoard lies hidden. In spite of Gudrun Atli\norders that Gunnar be thrown into a den of serpents. With a harp\ncommunicated to him by Gudrun he pacifies them all but one, which stings\nhim to the heart, and thus Gunnar dies. Gudrun is nominally reconciled\nwith Atli, but in secret plans revenge for the death of her brothers. She\nkills Atli’s two sons, gives him at a banquet their blood to drink and\ntheir hearts to eat. In the night she plunges a sword into his own heart,\nconfesses herself to him as his murderer, and sets fire to the castle, in\nwhich Atli and all his remaining men are consumed.",
        "[1] That is, Attila; the Etzel of the Nibelungenlied.",
        "The saga as we find it in the German Nibelungenlied differs very widely\nin form and substance from the Northern version which has just been\noutlined, though the two have still enough points of similarity to\nindicate clearly a common origin. Each bears the stamp of the poetic\ngenius of the people among whom it grew. Of all the sagas of the Germanic\npeoples none holds so prominent a place as the Nibelungen saga, and it\nmay safely be said that the epic literature of the world, though offering\npoems of more refined literary worth, has none that are at the same time\nsuch valuable records of the growth of the poetic genius of two kindred\npeoples through many centuries of their early civilization as the Edda\npoems of this saga and the Nibelungenlied. It is impossible here to\nundertake a comparison of the two and point out in detail their\nparallelism and their respective significance as monuments of\ncivilization; suffice it to indicate briefly the chief points of\ndifference in the two stories, and note particularly those parts of the\nNibelungenlied that have, as it were, suffered atrophy, and that point to\nearlier stages of the saga in which, as in the Northern version, they\nplayed a more important role.",
        "First, as to the hoard. The Nibelungenlied knows nothing of its being\ntaken by Loki from Andvari, of the latter’s curse upon it, and how it\ncame finally into the possession of Fafnir, the giant-dragon. Here it\nbelongs, as we learn from Hagen’s account (strophes 86-99), to Siegfried\n(Sigurd), who has slain the previous owners of it, Schilbung and\nNibelung, and wrested it from its guardian the dwarf Alberich (Andvari).\nFrom this point onward its history runs nearly parallel in the two\nversions. After Siegfried’s death it remains for a time with Kriemhild\n(Gudrun), is treacherously taken from her by Gunther (Gunnar) and Hagen\n(Hogni), and finally, before their journey to Etzel (Atli), sunk in the\nRhine.",
        "The protracted narrative of Sigurd’s ancestry and his descent from Odin\nhas no counterpart in the Nibelungenlied. Here we learn merely that\nSiegfried is the son of Siegmund. His father plays an entirely different\npart; and his mother’s name is not Hjordis, as in the Edda, but\nSiegelind.",
        "Of Siegfried’s youth the Nibelungenlied knows very little. No mention is\nmade of his tutelage to the dwarf smith Regin and preparation for the\nslaying of the dragon Fafnir. The account of him placed in the mouth of\nHagen (strophes 86-501), how he won the hoard, the tarnkappe, and the\nsword Balmung, and slew the dragon, is evidently a faint echo of an\nearlier version of this episode, which sounds out of place in the more\nmodern German form of the story. From the latter the mythical element has\nalmost entirely vanished. It is worthy of note, moreover, that the very\nbrief account of Siegfried’s slaying of the dragon is given in the\nNibelungenlied as separate from his acquisition of the hoard, and differs\nin detail from that of the Edda. Of Sigurd’s steed Grani, his ride to\nFrankenland, and his awakening of Brynhild the Nibelungenlied has nothing\nto tell us. Through the account of Siegfried’s assistance to Gunther in\nthe latter’s wooing of Brunhild (Adventures 6 and 7) shimmers faintly,\nhowever, the earlier tradition of the mythical Siegfried’s awakening of\nthe fire-encircled valkyrie. Only by our knowledge of a more original\nversion can we explain, for example, Siegfried’s previous acquaintance\nwith Brunhild which the Nibelungenlied takes for granted but says nothing\nof. On this point of the relation between Sigurd and Brynhild it is\ndifficult to form a clear account owing to the confusion and even\ncontradictions that exist when the various Northern versions themselves\nare placed side by side. The name of the valkyrie whom Sigurd awakens\nfrom her magic sleep is not directly mentioned. Some of the accounts are\nbased on the presupposition that she is one with the Brynhild whom Sigurd\nlater wooes for Gunnar, while others either know nothing of the sleeping\nvalkyrie or treat the two as separate personages. The situation in the\nNibelungenlied is more satisfactorily explained by the theory that they\nwere originally identical. But we see at once that the figure of Brunhild\nhas here lost much of its original significance. It is her quarrel with\nKriemhild (Gudrun) that leads to Siegfried’s death, though the motives\nare not just the same in the two cases; and after the death of Siegfried\nshe passes unaccountably from the scene.",
        "But it is in the concluding part of the story–the part which, as we\nshall see, has its basis in actual history–that the two accounts diverge\nmost widely. So strange, indeed, has been the evolution of the saga that\nthe central character of it, Kriemhild (Gudrun) holds a diametrically\nopposite relation to her husband Etzel (Atli) at the final catastrophe in\nthe two versions. In the Nibelungenlied as in the Edda the widowed\nKriemhild (Gudrun) marries King Etzel (Atli), her consent in the former\nresulting from a desire for revenge upon the murderers of Siegfried, in\nthe latter from the drinking of a potion which takes away her memory of\nhim; in the Nibelungenlied it is Kriemhild who treacherously lures\nGunther and his men to their destruction unknown to Etzel, in the Edda\nthe invitation comes from Atli, while Gudrun tries to warn them to stay\nat home; in the former Kriemhild is the author of the attack on the\nguests, in the latter Atli; in the former Kriemhild is the frenzied\navenger of her former husband Siegfried’s death upon her brother Gunther,\nin the latter Gudrun is the avenger of her brothers’ death upon her\nhusband Atli.",
        "A sifting of the Nibelungen saga reveals a mythical element (the story of\nSiegfried) and a historical element (the story of the Burgundians and\nEtzel). How, when, and where these two elements were blended together\nmust remain largely a matter of conjecture. This united central body\nreceived then from time to time accessions of other elements, some of\nthem originally historical in character, some of them pure inventions of\nthe poetic imagination.",
        "The Siegfried myth is the oldest portion of the Nibelungen saga, and had\nalready passed through a long period of development before its union with\nthe story of the Burgundian kings. Like so many others of its kind, it is\npart of the spiritual equipment of our Germanic ancestors at the dawn of\ntheir recorded history. It grew gradually with the people themselves and\nhas its counterpart among other peoples. Such myths are a record of the\nimpressions made upon the mind of man by the mighty manifestations of the\nworld of nature in which he lives; their formation may be likened to the\nunconscious impressions of its surroundings on the mind of the child. And\njust as the grown man is unable to trace back the formation of his own\nindividuality to its very beginnings in infancy, so is it impossible for\nthe later nation in its advanced stage to peer back beyond the dawn of\nits history. It is in the gloom beyond the dawn that such myths as this\nof Siegfried have their origin.",
        "Though modern authorities differ greatly in their conjectures, it is\ngenerally agreed that the Siegfried story was in its original form a\nnature-myth. The young day slays the mist-dragon and awakens the\nsun-maiden that sleeps on the mountain; at evening he falls a prey to the\npowers of gloom that draw the sun down again beneath the earth. With this\nday-myth was probably combined the parallel myth of the changing seasons:\nthe light returns in spring, slays the cloud-dragon, and frees the\nbudding earth from the bonds of winter.[2]",
        "[2] For the Siegfried saga in general see Symons in Paul’s Grundriss der\ngermanischen Philologie, 2d ed., vol. III, pp. 651-671.",
        "In the course of time this nature-myth became transformed into a\nhero-saga; the liberating power of light was humanized into the person of\nthe light-hero Siegfried. This stage of development had already been\nreached at the time of our earliest records, and the evidences point to\nthe Rhine Franks, a West Germanic tribe settled in the fifth century in\nthe country about Cologne, as the people among whom the transformation\nfrom nature-myth to hero-saga took place, for it is among them that the\nsaga in its earliest form is localized. By the Rhine Siegfried is born,\nthere he wins the Nibelungen hoard, and in Frankenland he finds the\nsleeping valkyrie. By the Rhine, too, he enters into service with the\nNibelungen kings and weds their sister.",
        "The Franks had as neighbors up-stream in the first half of the fifth\ncentury the Burgundians, an East Germanic tribe. These Burgundians, who\nwere closely allied to the Goths, had originally dwelt in the Baltic\nregion between the Vistula and the Oder, whence they had made their way\nsouth westward across Germany and settled in the year 413 in Germania\nprima on the west bank of the Rhine about Worms. Here a tragic fate was\nsoon to overtake them. In the year 435 they had already suffered a\nreverse in a conflict with the Romans under Aetius, and two years later,\nin 437, they were practically annihilated by the Huns. Twenty thousand of\nthem, we are told, fell in battle, the remainder were scattered\nsouthward. Beyond the brief record by a contemporary, Prosper, we know\nbut little of this event. It has been conjectured that the Huns were on\nthis occasion acting as auxiliaries of Aetius. At any rate it is fairly\ncertain that Attila was not personally on the scene.",
        "We can easily imagine what a profound impression this extinction of the\nBurgundians would produce upon the minds of their neighbors the Rhine\nFranks. Fact, too, would soon become mingled with fiction. This new feat\nwas ascribed to Attila himself, already too well known as the scourge of\nEurope and the subduer of so many German tribes. A very few years later,\nhowever, fate was to subdue the mighty conqueror himself. With the great\nbattle of Chalons in 451 the tide turned against him, and two years\nafterwards he died a mysterious death. The historian Jordanes of the\nsixth century relates that on the morning after Attila’s wedding with a\nGerman princess named Ildico (Hildiko) he was found lying in bed in a\npool of blood, having died of a hemorrhage. The mysteriousness of\nAttila’s ending inspired his contemporaries with awe, and the popular\nfancy was not slow to clothe this event also in a dress of fiction. The\nattendant circumstances peculiarly favored such a process. Historians\nsoon recorded the belief that Attila had perished at the hands of his\nwife, and it was only a step further for the imagination to find the\nmotive for the deed in the desire of Hildiko to avenge the death of her\nGerman kinsmen who had perished through Attila. The saga of Attila’s\ndeath is before long connected with the growing Burgundian saga, Hildiko\nbecomes the sister of the Burgundian kings Gundahari, Godomar, and\nGislahari, and her deed is vengeance taken upon Attila for his\ndestruction of her brothers. As is seen at once from the outline I have\nalready given (Chapter 2.) of the saga as we find it in the Edda, this is\nthe stage of development it had reached when it began to find its way\nnorthward from the Rhine country to Norway and Iceland.",
        "It is unnecessary here to record the speculations–for beyond\nspeculations we cannot go–as to how the union of this historical saga of\nthe Burgundians and Attila with the Siegfried saga took place. In the\ncourse of time, and naturally with greatest probability among the Rhine\nFranks who followed the Burgundians as occupants of Germania prima, the\ntwo were brought together, and the three Burgundian kings and their\nsister were identified with the three Nibelungen kings and their sister\nof the already localized Siegfried saga. It is also beyond the scope of\nthis introduction to follow the course of the saga northward or to note\nits further evolution during its wanderings and in its new home until it\nwas finally recorded in poetic form in the Edda. We have now to consider\nbriefly the transformation it passed through in Germany between this date\n(about 500) and the time (about 1200) when it emerges in written record\nas the Nibelungenlied.",
        "An account has already been given (Chapter 3.) of the chief features in\nwhich the Nibelungenlied differs from the Northern form. As we saw there,\nthe mythical element of the Siegfried saga has almost entirely evaporated\nand the historical saga of the Burgundian kings and Attila has undergone\na complete transformation. That the originally mythical and heathen\nSiegfried saga should dwindle away with the progress of civilization and\nunder the influence of Christianity was but natural. The character of the\nvalkyrie Brynhild who avenges upon Sigurd his infidelity to her, yet\nvoluntarily unites herself with him in death, as heathen custom demanded,\nis no longer intelligible. She recedes into the background, and after\nSiegfried’s death, though she is still living, she plays no further part.\nThe Nibelungenlied found its final form on Upper German, doubtless\nAustrian, territory. Here alone was it possible that that greatest of all\ntransformations could take place, namely, in the character of Attila. The\nFranks of the Rhine knew him only as the awe-inspiring conqueror who had\nannihilated their neighbors the Burgundians. In Austrian lands it was\nquite otherwise. Many Germanic tribes, particularly the East Goths, had\nfought under the banner of Attila, and in the tradition handed down from\nthem he lived as the embodiment of wisdom and generosity. Here it was\nimpossible that epic story should picture him as slaying the Burgundian\nkings through a covetous desire for their gold. The annihilation of the\nBurgundians is thus left without a motive. To supply this, Kriemhild’s\ncharacter is placed upon an entirely different basis. Instead of avenging\nupon Attila the death of her brothers the Burgundian kings, Kriemhild now\navenges upon her brothers the slaying of her first husband Siegfried.\nThis fundamental change in the character of Kriemhild has a deep ethical\nreason. To the ancient heathen Germans the tie of blood-relationship was\nstronger than that of wedlock, and thus in the original version of the\nstory Attila’s wife avenges upon him the death of her brothers; to the\nChristianized Germans of later times the marriage bond was the stronger,\nand accordingly from the altered motive Kriemhild avenges upon her\nbrothers the slaying of her husband. In accordance, too, with this\nethical transformation the scene of the catastrophe is transferred from\nWorms to Attila’s court. Kriemhild now looms up as the central figure of\nthe second half of the drama, while Etzel remains to the last ignorant of\nher designs for revenge.",
        "This transformation of the fundamental parts of the saga was accompanied\nby another process, namely, the addition of new characters. Some of these\nare the product of the poetic faculty of the people or individuals who\npreserved and remoulded the story in the course of centuries, others are\nbased upon history. To the former class belong the Margrave Ruediger, the\nideal of gentle chivalry, and Volker the Fiddler-knight, doubtless a\ncreation of the spielleute. To the second class belong Dietrich of\nBern, in whom we see the mighty East Gothic king, Theodoric of Verona;\nalso Bishop Pilgrim of Passau, a very late importation, besides several\nothers in whom are perpetuated in more or less faint outline actual\npersons of history. This introduction of fresh characters from time to\ntime as the saga grew has led to some strange anachronisms, which however\nare a disturbing element only to us readers of a modern day, who with\nsacrilegious hand lift the veil through which they were seen in a uniform\nhaze of romance by the eye of the knights and ladies of seven centuries\nago. They neither knew nor cared to know, for instance, that Attila was\ndead before Theodoric was born, and that Bishop Pilgrim flourished at\nPassau the trifling space of five hundred years later still.[3]",
        "[3] Attila lived from about 406 to 453; Theodoric, 475 to 526. Pilgrim\n    was Bishop of Passau, 971 to 991.",
        "Among the German epic poems of the Middle Ages the Nibelungenlied [4]\nenjoyed an exceptional popularity, as is evident from the large number of\nmanuscripts–some thirty, either complete or fragmentary–that have been\npreserved from the centuries immediately following its appearance. Three\nare of prime importance as texts, namely, those preserved now in Munich,\nSt. Gall, and Donaueschingen, and cited as A, B, and C respectively.\nSince the time when Lachmann, about a century ago, made the first\nscientific study of the poem, a whole flood of writings has been poured\nforth discussing the relative merits of these texts. Each in turn has had\nits claims advocated with warmth and even acrimony. None of these three\nprincipal manuscripts, however, offers the poem in its earliest form;\nthey all point to a still earlier version. It is now generally admitted\nthat the St. Gall manuscript (B), according to which the present\ntranslation has been made, contains the best and most nearly original\ntext.",
        "[4] The closing strophe of MS. C calls the poem der Nibelunge liet, or\n    Nibelungenlied, i.e. the lay of the Nibelungen, and this is the title\n    by which it is commonly known. MSS. A and B have in the corresponding\n    strophe der Nibelunge not, i.e. the ’need’, ’distress’,\n    ’downfall’ of the Nibelungen. In the title of the poem ’Nibelungen’\n    is simply equivalent to ’Burgundians’: the poem relates the downfall\n    of the Burgundian kings and their people. Originally the Nibelungen\n    were, as their name, which is connected with nebel, ’mist’,\n    ’gloom’, signifies, the powers of darkness to whom the light-hero\n    Siegfried fell a prey. After Siegfried obtains possession of the\n    treasure the name Nibelungen is still applied to Alberich and the\n    dwarfs who guard it and who are now Siegfried’s vassals. Then after\n    Siegfried’s death the name is given to the Burgundians. It is a\n    mistake to suppose that the name was applied in each case to those\n    who became possessors of the hoard, for Siegfried himself is never so\n    designated.",
        "Hand in hand with the discussion of the relative authenticity of the\nmanuscripts went the consideration of another more important literary\nquestion,–the evolution of the poem itself. Even if we knew nothing of\nthe history of the Nibelungen saga as revealed in the Edda and through\nother literary and historic sources, a reading of the poem would give us\nunmistakable hints that it is not, in its present form, a perfect\nliterary unit. We detect inconsistencies in matter and inequalities of\nstyle that prove it to be a remodelling of material already existing in\nsome earlier form. What, then, has been the history of its evolution? How\ndid this primeval Siegfried myth, this historical saga of the Burgundians\nand Attila, first come to be part of the poetic stock of the German\npeople? What was its earliest poetic form, and what series of\ntransformations did it pass through during seven centuries of growth?\nThese and many kindred questions present themselves, and the search for\nanswers to them takes us through many winding labyrinths of the nation’s\ncontemporary history. Few products of German literature have so exercised\nand tantalized critics as the Nibelungenlied.",
        "In this connection we have to remind ourselves that comparatively little\nof what must have been the large body of native poetry in Germany\nprevious to the eleventh century has come down to us. Barely enough has\nbeen preserved to show the path of the nation’s literary progress. Some\nof the important monuments have been saved by chance, while others of\nequal or perhaps greater value have been irrecoverably lost. The interest\nin the various incidents of the Nibelungen story was sufficient to keep\nit alive among the people and hand it down orally through many\ngenerations. If we could observe it as it passed from age to age we\nshould doubtless see it undergoing continuous change according to the\ntime and the class of the people that were the preservers of the native\nliterature in its many ups and downs. Lachmann in the year 1816 was the\nfirst to bring scientific criticism to bear on the question of the\nNibelungenlied and its origin. Applying to it the same methods as had\nrecently been used by Wolf in his criticism of the Homeric poems, he\nthought he was able to discover as the basis of the complete epic a cycle\nof twenty separate lieder, ballads or shorter episodic poems, on the\nstrength of which belief he went so far as to publish an edition of the\npoem in which he made the division into the twenty separate lays and\neliminated those strophes (more than one third of the whole number) that\nhe deemed not genuine. It is now generally admitted, however, that the\npioneer of Nibelungen investigation fell here into over-positive\nrefinements of literary criticism. Separate shorter poems there doubtless\nexisted narrating separate episodes of the story, but these are no longer\nto be arrived at by a process of critical disintegration and pruning of\nthe epic as we have it. An examination of the twenty lieder according\nto Lachmann’s division convinces us that they are not separate units in\nthe sense he conceived them to be. Though these twenty lieder may be\nbased upon a number of earlier episodic poems, yet the latter already\nconstituted a connected series. They were already like so many scenes of\na gradually developing drama. Events were foreshadowed in one that were\nonly fulfilled in another, and the incidents of later ones are often only\nintelligible on the supposition of an acquaintance with motives that\noriginated in preceding ones. It is in this sense only, not according to\nLachmann’s overwrought theory, that we are justified in speaking of a\nliedercyclus, or cycle of separate episodic poems, as the stage of the\nepic antecedent to the complete form in which we now have it. But beyond\nthis cycle we cannot trace it back. How the mythical saga of Siegfried\nand the Nibelungen, and the story of the Burgundians and Attila, were\nfirst sung in alliterative lays in the Migration Period, how as heathen\nsong they were pushed aside or slowly influenced by the spirit of\nChristianity, how with changing time they changed also their outward\npoetical garb from alliteration to rhyme and altered verse-form, till at\nlast in the twelfth century they have become the cycle of poems from\nwhich the great epic of the Nibelungenlied could be constructed–of all\nthis we may form a faint picture from the development of the literature\nin general, but direct written record of it is almost completely wanting.",
        "The twelfth and thirteenth centuries witnessed far-reaching changes in\nthe social and intellectual life of the German lands, the leading feature\nof which is the high development of all that is included under the name\nof chivalry. It is marked, too, by a revival of the native literature\nsuch as had not been known before, a revival which is due almost entirely\nto its cultivation by the nobility. From emperor down to the simple\nknight they were patrons of poetry and, what is most striking, nearly all\nthe poets themselves belong to the knightly class. The drama has not yet\nbegun, but in the field of epic and lyric there appear about the year\n1200 poets who are among the greatest that German literature even down to\nthe present time has to show. The epic poetry of that period, though\nwritten almost entirely by the knights, is of two distinct kinds\naccording to its subject: on the one hand what is called the Court Epic,\non the other hand the National, or Popular, Epic. The Court Epic follows\nfor the most part French models and deals chiefly with the life of\nchivalry, whose ideals were embodied in king Arthur and his circle of\nknights; the National Epic drew its subjects from the national German\nsaga, its two great products being the Nibelungenlied and the poem of\nGudrun. Court Epic and National Epic are further distinct in form, the\nCourt Epic being written in the rhymed couplets popularized in modern\ntimes in English by Sir Walter Scott, while the National Epic is composed\nin four-lined strophes.",
        "Though we know the name and more or less of the life of the authors of\nthe many court epics of the period, the name of the poet who gave the\nNibelungenlied its final form has not been recorded. As we have seen, the\npoem is at bottom of a truly popular, national character, having its\nbeginnings in mythology and early national history. For centuries the\nsubject had been national property and connected with the name of no one\nindividual. We have it now in the form in which it was remodelled to suit\nthe taste of the court and the nobility, and like the court epic to be\nread aloud in castle hall. That it is written in four-lined strophes[5]\nand not in the usual rhymed couplets of the court epics is doubtless due\nto the fact that the former verse-form had already been used in the\nearlier ballads upon which it is based, and was simply taken over by the\nfinal moulder of the poem. This latter was probably a member of the\nnobility like the great majority of the epic poets of the time; he must\nat least have been well acquainted with the manners, tastes, sentiments,\nand general life of the nobility. Through him the poem was brought\noutwardly more into line with the literary ideals of the court circles.\nThis shows itself chiefly in a negative way, namely, in the almost\ncomplete avoidance of the coarse language and farcical situations so\ncommon with the popular poet, the spielmann. Beyond this no violence is\ndone to the simple form of the original. The style is still inornate and\ndirect, facts still speak rather than words, and there is nothing\napproaching the refined psychological dissection of characters and\nmotives such as we find in Wolfram von Eschenbach and the other court\nwriters.",
        "[5] For description of the Nibelungen strophe see below, Chapter 7.",
        "When we look to the inner substance we see that the ground ideals are\nstill those of the original Germanic heroic age. The chief characters are\nstill those of the first stages of the story–Siegfried, Brunhild,\nGunther, Kriemhild, Hagen. The fundamental theme is the ancient theme of\ntriuwe, unswerving personal loyalty and devotion, which manifests\nitself above all in the characters of Kriemhild and Hagen. Kriemhild’s\nhusband Siegfried is treacherously slain: her sorrow and revenge are the\nmotives of the drama. Hagen’s mistress has, though with no evil intent on\nSiegfried’s part, received an insult to her honor: to avenge that insult\nis Hagen’s absorbing duty, which he fulfils with an utter disregard of\nconsequences. Over this their fundamental character the various persons\nof the story have received a gloss of outward conduct in keeping with the\nclose of the twelfth century. The poet is at pains to picture them as\nmodels of courtly bearing, excelling in hofscheit, zuht, tugent.\nGreat attention is paid to dress, and the preparation of fitting apparel\nfor court festivities is described and re-described with wearisome\nprolixity. A cardinal virtue is milte, liberality in the bestowal of\ngifts. Courtesy toward women is observed with the careful formality of\nthe age of the minnesingers. It was above all Siegfried, the light-hero\nof the original myth, whose character lent itself to an idealization of\nknighthood. Ruediger holds a like place in the latter part of the poem.\nIn the evident pleasure with which the minstrel-knight Volker of the\nsword-fiddlebow is depicted, as well doubtless as in occasional gleams of\nbroader humor, the hand of the minstrels who wrought on the story in its\nearlier ballad stages may be seen. And the whole poem, in keeping with\nits form in an age strongly under church influence, has been tinged with\nthe ideals of Christianity. Not only does the ordinary conversation of\nall the characters, including even the heathen Etzel, contain a great\nnumber of formal imprecations of God, but Christian institutions and\nChristian ethics come frequently into play. Mass is sung in the minster,\nbaptism, marriage, burial are celebrated in Christian fashion, the devil\nis mentioned according to the Christian conception, we hear of priest,\nchaplain, and bishop, Christians are contrasted with heathen, and\nKriemhild, in marrying Etzel, has a hope of turning him to Christianity.\nIn Hagen’s attempt to drown the chaplain whom the Burgundians have with\nthem as they set out for the land of the Huns we have perhaps an\nexpression of the conflict between the heathen and the Christian\nelements, possibly also a reflection of the traditional animosity of the\nspielmann to his clerical rival.",
        "The Nibelungenlied and the Iliad of Homer have often been compared, but\nafter all to no great purpose. The two epics are alike in having their\nroots deep in national origins, but beyond this we have contrasts rather\nthan resemblances. The Iliad is a more varied and complete picture of the\nwhole Greek world than the Nibelungenlied is of the German, its religious\natmosphere has not been disturbed in the same way as that of the saga of\nearly Germanic times projected several centuries into a later Christian\nage, and it possesses in every way a greater unity of sentiment. In the\nvaried beauty of its language, its wealth of imagery, its depth of\nfeeling and copiousness of incident the Iliad is superior to the\nNibelungenlied with its language of simple directness, its few lyrical\npassages, its expression of feeling by deeds rather than by words. Homer,\ntoo, is in general buoyant, the Nibelungenlied is sombre and stern. And\nin one last respect the two epics differ most of all: the Iliad is\nessentially narrative and descriptive, a series of episodes; the\nNibelungenlied is essentially dramatic, scene following scene of dramatic\nnecessity and pointing steadily to a final and inevitable catastrophe.",
        "In the Northern Edda and in the German Nibelungenlied the Nibelungen saga\nfound its fullest and most poetic expression. But these were not to be\nthe only literary records of it. Both in Scandinavian lands and in\nGermany various other monuments, scattered over the intervening\ncenturies, bear witness to the fact that it lived on in more or less\ndivergent forms. The Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus of the latter part\nof the twelfth century has a reference to the story of Kriemhild’s\ntreachery toward her brothers. About the year 1250 an extensive prose\nnarrative, known as the Thidrekssaga, was written by a Norwegian from\noral accounts given him by men from Bremen and Munster. This narrative is\ninteresting as showing the form the saga had taken by that date on Low\nGerman territory, and holds an important place in the history of the\ndevelopment of the saga. It has much more to say of the early history of\nSiegfried than we find in the Nibelungenlied, and yet in the main\noutlines of the story of Kriemhild’s revenge it corresponds with the\nGerman epic and not with the Northern Edda. A chronicle of the island of\nHven in the Sound, dating in its original form from the sixteenth\ncentury, as well as Danish ballads on the same island that have lived on\ninto modern times, tell of Sivard (Siegfried), Brynhild, and also of\nGrimild’s (Kriemhild’s) revenge. In Norway and Sweden traces of the saga\nhave recently been discovered; while songs that are sung on the Faroe\nIslands, as an accompaniment to the dance on festive occasions, have been\nrecorded, containing over six hundred strophes in which is related in\nmore or less distorted form the Nibelungen story.",
        "In Germany the two poems known as the Klage and Hurnen Seyfrid are\nthe most noteworthy additional records of the Nibelungen saga, as\noffering in part at least independent material. The Klage is a poem of\nover four thousand lines in rhymed couplets, about half of it being an\naccount of the mourning of Etzel, Dietrich, and Hildebrand as they seek\nout the slain and prepare them for burial, the other half telling of the\nbringing of the news to Bechlaren, Passau, and Worms. The poem was\nwritten evidently very soon after the Nibelungenlied, the substance of\nwhich was familiar to the author, though he also draws in part from other\nsources. Compared with the Nibelungenlied it possesses but little poetic\nmerit and is written with distinctly Christian sentiment which is out of\nharmony with the ground-tone of the Germanic tragedy.",
        "The Hurnen Seyfrid is a poem of 179 four-lined strophes which is\npreserved only in a print of the sixteenth century, but at least a\nportion of whose substance reaches back in its original form to a period\npreceding the composition of the Nibelungenlied. It is evidently, as we\nhave it, formed by the union of two earlier separate poems, which are\nindeed to a certain extent contradictory of each other. The first tells\nof the boyhood of Seyfrid (Siegfried) and his apprenticeship to the\nsmith; how he slew many dragons, burned them, and smeared over his body\nwith the resulting fluid horny substance (hence his name hurnen), which\nmade him invulnerable; how he further found the hoard of the dwarf\nNybling, and by service to King Gybich won the latter’s daughter for his\nwife. The second part tells how King Gybich reigned at Worms. He has\nthree sons, Gunther, Hagen, Gyrnot, and one daughter, Kriemhild. The\nlatter is borne off by a dragon, but finally rescued by Seyfrid, to whom\nshe is given in marriage. The three brothers are jealous of the might and\nfame of Seyfrid, and after eight years Hagen slays him beside a cool\nspring in the Ottenwald.",
        "The poem Biterolf, written soon after the Nibelungenlied, and\nRosengarten of perhaps a half-century later, represent Dietrich in\nconflict with Siegfried at Worms. The famous shoemaker-poet Hans Sachs of\nNuremberg in 1557 constructed a tragedy, Der hornen Sewfriedt, on the\nstory of Siegfried as he knew it from the Hurnen Seyfrid and the\nRosengarten. A prose version of the Hurnen Seyfrid, with free\nadditions and alterations, is preserved in the Volksbuch vom gehornten\nSigfrid, the oldest print of which dates from the year 1726. Of the vast\nnumber of Fairy Tales, those most genuine creations of the poetic\nimagination of the people, in which live on, often to be sure in scarcely\nrecognizable form, many of the myths and sagas of the nation’s infancy,\nthere are several that may with justice be taken as relics of the\nSiegfried myth, for instance, The Two Brothers, The Young Giant, The\nEarth-Manikin, The King of the Golden Mount, The Raven, The Skilled\nHuntsman, and perhaps also the Golden Bird and The Water of Life;[6]\nthough it would seem from recent investigations that Thorn-Rose or the\nSleeping Beauty, is no longer to be looked upon as the counterpart of the\nsleeping Brynhild. Finally, it is probable that several names in Germany\nand in Northern countries preserve localized memories of the saga.",
        "[6] These will be found in Grimm’s Marchen as numbers 60, 90-93, 111, 57,\n    and 97.",
        "Fundamentally different from the foregoing natural outgrowths of the\nNibelungen saga are the modern dramas and poems founded upon it since the\ntime of the romanticists at the beginning of the nineteenth century.[7]\nNearly all of these have already vanished as so much chaff from the\nwinnowing-mill of time: only two, perhaps, are now considered seriously,\nnamely, Hebbel’s Die Nibelungen and Richard Wagner’s Ring des\nNibelungen. Hebbel in his grandly conceived drama in three parts follows\nclosely the story as we have it in our epic poem the Nibelungenlied, and\nthe skill with which he makes use of its tragic elements shows his\ndramatic genius at its best. But not even the genius of Hebbel could make\nthese forms of myth and saga live again for us upon a modern stage, and\nthe failure of this work with its wealth of poetic beauty and many scenes\nof highest dramatic effectiveness to maintain its place as an acting\ndrama is sufficient evidence that the yawning gap that separates the\nsentiment of the modern world from that of the early centuries in which\nthese sagas grew is not to be bridged over by the drama, however easy and\nindeed delightful it may be for us to allow ourselves to be transported\nthither to that romantic land upon the wings of epic story. Wagner in his\nmusic-drama in three parts and prelude has followed in the main the saga\nin its Northern form [8] up to the death of Siegfried and Brunhild, but\nto the entire exclusion of the latter part of the story in which Atli\n(Etzel) figures; his work has accordingly hardly any connection with the\nNibelungenlied here offered in translation. Only the pious loyalty of\nnational sentiment can assign a high place in dramatic literature to\nWagner’s work with its intended imitation of the alliterative form of\nverse; while his philosophizing gods and goddesses are also but decadent\nmodern representatives of their rugged heathen originals.",
        "[7] The curious will find a list of these in the introduction to Piper’s\n    edition, cited below, Chapter 7.\n[8] See above, Chapter 2.",
        "The language of the Nibelungenlied presents about the same difficulty to\nthe German reader of to-day as that of our English Chaucer to us. Many\ntranslations into modern German have accordingly been made to render it\naccessible to the average reader without special study. In the year 1767\nBodmer in Zurich published a translation into hexameters of a portion of\nit, and since the investigations of Lachmann raised it to the position of\na national epic of first magnitude many more have appeared, both in prose\nand verse. The best in prose is that by Scherr, of the year 1860. Of the\nmetrical translations that by Simrock, which in its later editions\nfollows pretty closely the text of MS. C, is deservedly the most popular\nand has passed through a great number of editions. Bartsch has also made\na translation based on his edition of MS. B. These modern versions by\nSimrock and Bartsch reproduce best the metrical quality of the original\nstrophe. Easily obtainable recent translations are those by Junghans (in\nReclam’s Universalbibliothek) of text C, and by Hahn (Collection Spemann)\nof text A.",

        "Early in last century interest in the Nibelungenlied began to manifest\nitself in England. A synopsis of it, with metrical translation of several\nstrophes, appeared in the year 1814 in Weber, Jamieson and Scott’s\n\"Illustrations of Northern Antiquities” (London and Edinburgh), in which,\naccording to Lockhart, Sir Walter Scott’s hand may perhaps be seen.\nCarlyle, laboring as a pioneer to spread a knowledge of German literature\nin England, contributed to the Westminster Review in 1831 his well-known\nessay on the Nibelungenlied which, though containing an additional mass\nof rather ill-arranged matter and now antiquated in many particulars, is\nstill well worth reading for its enthusiastic account of the epic itself\nin the genuine style of the author. Carlyle here reproduces in metrical\nform a few strophes. He has said elsewhere that one of his ambitions was\nto make a complete English version of the poem. Since then an endless\nnumber of accounts of it, chiefly worthless, has appeared in magazines\nand elsewhere. The first attempt at a complete metrical translation was\nmade in 1848 by Jonathan Birch, who however only reproduces Lachmann’s\ntwenty lieder, with some fifty-one strophes added on his own account.\nHis version of the first strophe runs thus:",
        "Legends of by-gone times reveal wonders and prodigies,\n  Of heroes worthy endless fame,–of matchless braveries,–\n  Of jubilees and festal sports,–of tears and sorrows great,–\n  And knights who daring combats fought:–the like I now relate.",
        "In 1850 appeared William Nansom Lettsom’s translation of the whole poem\naccording to Braunfels’ edition, with the opening strophe turned as\nfollows:",
        "In stories of our fathers high marvels we are told\n  Of champions well approved in perils manifold.\n  Of feasts and merry meetings, of weeping and of wail,\n  And deeds of gallant daring I’ll tell you in my tale.",
        "The next metrical rendering is that by A. G. Foster-Barham in the year\n1887. His first strophe reads:",
        "Many a wondrous story have the tales of old,\n  Of feats of knightly glory, and of the Heroes bold,\n  Of the delights of feasting, of weeping and of wail,\n  Of noble deeds of daring; you may list strange things in my tale.",
        "In the year 1898 follows still another, by Alice Horton (edited by E.\nBell). This latest translation is based on Bartsch’s text of MS. B, and\nis prefaced by Carlyle’s essay. First strophe:",
        "To us, in olden legends, / is many a marvel told\n  Of praise-deserving heroes, / of labours manifold,\n  Of weeping and of wailing, / of joy and festival;\n  Of bold knights’ battling shall you / now hear a wondrous tale.",
        "Apart from the many faults of interpretation all of the metrical\ntranslations of the Nibelungenlied here enumerated are defective in one\nall-important respect: they do not reproduce the poem in its metrical\nform. Carlyle and other pioneers we may perhaps acquit of any intention\nof following the original closely in this regard. None of the translators\nof the complete poem, however, has retained in the English rendering what\nis after all the very essence of a poem,–its exact metrical quality.\nBirch has created an entirely different form of strophe in which all four\nlines are alike, each containing seven principal accents, with the\ncaesura, following the fourth foot. Lettsom makes the first serious\nattempt to reproduce the original strophe. It is evident from the\nintroduction to his translation (see p. xxvi) that he had made a careful\nstudy of its form, and he does in fact reproduce the first three lines\nexactly. Of the fourth line he says: “I have not thought it expedient to\nmake a rule of thus lengthening the fourth lines of the stanzas, though I\nhave lengthened them occasionally\"(!). What moved him thus to deprive\nthe stanza of its most striking feature–and one, moreover, that is\neasily preserved in English–he does not make clear. The versions of\nFoster-Barham and of Horton and Bell show the same disfigurement, the\nlatter omitting the extra accent of the fourth line, as they say, “for\nthe sake of euphony\"(!). It is just this lengthened close of each strophe\nthat gives the Nibelungenlied its peculiar metrical character and\ncontributes not a little to the avoidance of monotony in a poem of over\ntwo thousand strophes. In theory the form of the fourth line as it stands\nin the original is no more foreign to the genius of the English language\nthan to that of modern German, and few of the many Germans giving a\nmodernized version of the epic have been bold enough to lay sacrilegious\nhands upon it to shorten it.",
        "A brief account of the Nibelungen strophe may not be out of place here,\nowing to the fact that its character has generally been misunderstood.\nThe origin and evolution of the strophe have been the subject of much\ndiscussion, the results of which we need not pause to formulate here. As\nit appears in actual practice in our poem of about the year 1200, it was\nas follows: Each strophe consists of four long lines, the first line\nrhyming with the second, and the third with the fourth. The rhymes are\nmasculine, that is, rhymes on the end syllable. Each line is divided by a\nclearly marked caesura into two halves; each half of the first three\nlines and the first half of the fourth line has three accented syllables,\nthe second half of the fourth line has four accented syllables. The first\nhalf of each line ends in an unaccented syllabic–or, strictly speaking,\nin a syllable bearing a secondary accent; that is, each line has what is\ncalled a “ringing” caesura. The metrical character of the Nibelungen\nstrophe is thus due to its fixed number of accented syllables. Of\nunaccented syllables the number may vary within certain limits.\nOrdinarily each accented syllable is preceded by an unaccented one; that\nis, the majority of feet are iambic. The unaccented syllable may,\nhowever, at times be wanting, or there may, on the other hand, be two or\neven three of them together. A characteristic of the second half of the\nlast line is that there is very frequently no unaccented syllable between\nthe second and the third accented ones. Among occasional variations of\nthe normal strophe as here described may be mentioned the following: The\nend-rhyme is in a few instances feminine instead of masculine; while on\nthe other hand the ending of the first half-lines is occasionally\nmasculine instead of feminine, that is, the caesura is not “ringing.” In\na few scattered instances we find strophes that rhyme throughout in the\ncaesura as well as at the end of lines;[10] occasionally the first and\nsecond lines, or still less frequently the third and fourth, alone have\ncaesural rhyme.[11] Rhyming of the caesura may be regarded as accidental\nin most cases, but it is reproduced as exactly as possible in this\ntranslation.",
        "[10] Strophes 1, 17, 102, and possibly 841.\n[11] Strophes 18, 69, 103, 115, 129, 148, 177, 190, 198, 222, 231,\n     239, 293, 325, 345, 363, 485, 584, 703, 712, 859, 864, 894, 937,\n     1022, 1032, 1114, 1225, 1432, 1436, 1460, 1530, 1555, 1597, 1855,\n     1909, 1944, 1956, 2133, 2200, 2206, 2338.",
        "In the original the opening strophe, which is altogether more regular\nthan the average and is, moreover, one of the few that have also complete\ncaesural rhyme, is as follows:",
        "Uns ist in alten maeren / wunders vil geseit\n  von heleden lobebaeren, / von grozer arebeit,\n  von frouden, hochgeziten, / von weinen und von klagen,\n  von kuener recken striten / muget ir nu wunder hoeren sagen.",
        "Here the only place where the unaccented syllable is lacking before the\naccented is before wunders at the beginning of the second half of the\nfirst line. A strophe showing more typical irregularities is, for\ninstance, the twenty-second:",
        "In sinen besten ziten, / bi sinen jungen tagen,\n  man mohte michel wunder / von Sivride sagen,\n  waz eren an im wuchse / und wie scoene was sin lip.\n  sit heten in ze minne / diu vil waetlichen wip.",
        "Here the rhyme of the first and second lines is still masculine, tagen\nand sagen being pronounced tagn and sagn. The unaccented syllable\nis lacking, e.g., before the second accent of the second half of line\ntwo, also before the first and the third accent of the second half of\nline four. There are two unaccented syllables at the beginning\n(Auftakt) of the second half of line three. The absence of the\nunaccented syllable between the second and the third accent of the last\nhalf of the fourth line of a strophe, as here, is so frequent in the poem\nas to amount almost to a rule; it shows an utter misconception, or\ndisregard, of its true character, nevertheless, to treat this last\nhalf-line as having only three accented syllables, as all translators\nhitherto have done.",

        "176",
        "Then from the Rhine through Hesse / the hosts of knights rode on\nToward the land of Saxons, / where battle was anon.\nWith fire and sword they harried / and laid the country waste,\nSo that both the monarchs / full well the woes of war did taste.",

        "184",
        "Now singled out for combat / him, too, had Luedegast.\nThen full upon each other / they spurred their chargers fast,\nAs on their shields they lowered / their lances firm and tight,\nWhereat the lordly monarch / soon found himself in sorry plight.",

        "And scarce the time he bided / while that the feast did last.\nNow unto her chamber / the stately Brunhild passed,\nAnd for her couch did Kriemhild / likewise the table leave.\nBefore those royal ladies / what host ye saw of warriors brave!",
        "661",
        "Full soon thereafter Siegfried / sat right lovingly\nWith his fair wife beside him, / and naught but joy had he.\nHis hand she clasped full fondly / within her hand so white,\nUntil–and how she knew not– / he did vanish from her sight.",
        "662",
        "When she the knight did fondle, / and straightway saw him not,\nUnto her maids attendant / spake the queen distraught:\n\"Meseemeth a mickle wonder / where now the king hath gone.\nHis hands in such weird fashion / who now from out mine own hath drawn?”",
        "663",
        "Yet further not she questioned. / Soon had he hither gone\nWhere with lights were standing / attendants many a one.\nThe same he did extinguish / in every page’s hand;\nThat Siegfried then was present / Gunther thereby did understand.",
        "664",
        "Well wist he what he would there; / so bade he thence be gone\nLadies and maids-in-waiting. / And when that was done,\nHimself the mighty monarch / fast did lock the door:\nTwo bolts all wrought securely / he quickly shoved the same before.",
        "665",
        "The lights behind the curtains / hid he presently.\nSoon a play was started / (for thus it had to be),\nBetwixt the doughty Siegfried / and the stately maid:\nThereat was royal Gunther / joyous alike and sad.",

        "Siegfried there laid him / by the maid full near.\nSpake she: “Let be, now, Gunther, / an hast thou cause to fear\nThose troubles now repeated / which befell thee yesternight.\"\nAnd soon the valiant Siegfried / through the lady fell in sorry plight.",
        "667",
        "His voice did he keep under / and ne’er a word spake he.\nIntently listened Gunther, / and though he naught could see,\nYet knew he that in secret / nothing ’twixt them passed.\nIn sooth nor knight nor lady / upon the bed had mickle rest.",
        "668",
        "He did there as if Gunther / the mighty king he were,\nAnd in his arms he pressed her, / the maiden debonair.\nForth from the bed she hurled him / where a bench there stood,\nAnd head of valiant warrior / against a stool went ringing loud.",
        "669",
        "Up sprang again undaunted / the full doughty man,\nTo try for fortune better. / When he anew began\nPerforce to curb her fury, / fell he in trouble sore.\nI ween that ne’er a lady / did so defend herself before.",
        "670",
        "When he would not give over, / up the maid arose:\n\"My gown so white thou never / thus shalt discompose.\nAnd this thy villain’s manner / shall sore by thee be paid,\nThe same I’ll teach thee truly,\" / further spake the buxom maid.",
        "671",
        "Within her arms she clasped him, / the full stately thane,\nAnd thought likewise to bind him, / as the king yestreen,\nThat she the night in quiet / upon her couch might lie.\nThat her dress he thus did rumple, / avenged the lady grievously.",
        "672",
        "What booted now his prowess / and eke his mickle might?\nHer sovereignty of body / she proved upon the knight;\nBy force of arm she bore him, / –’twixt wall and mighty chest\n(For so it e’en must happen) / him she all ungently pressed.",
        "673",
        "“Ah me!\"–so thought the hero– / “shall I now my life\nLose at hand of woman, / then will every wife\nEvermore hereafter / a shrewish temper show\nAgainst her lord’s good wishes, / who now such thing ne’er thinks to do.”",
        "674",
        "All heard the monarch meanwhile / and trembled for the man.\nSore ashamed was Siegfried, / and a-raging he began.\nWith might and main he struggled / again to make him free,\nEre which to sorest trouble / ’neath Lady Brunhild’s hand fell he.",
        "675",
        "Long space to him it seemed / ere Siegfried tamed her mood.\nShe grasped his hand so tightly / that ’neath the nails the blood\nOozed from the pressure, / which made the hero wince.\nYet the stately maiden / subdued he to obedience since.",
        "676",
        "Her unrestrained temper / that she so late displayed,\nAll overheard the monarch, / though ne’er a word he said.\n’Gainst the bed did press her Siegfried / that aloud she cried,\nUngentle was the treatment / that he meted to the bride.",
        "677",
        "Then grasped she for a girdle / that round her sides she wore,\nAnd thought therewith to bind him; / but her limbs and body o’er\nStrained beneath the vigor / that his strong arm displayed.\nSo was the struggle ended / –Gunther’s wife was vanquished.",
        "678",
        "She spake: “O noble monarch, / take not my life away.\nThe harm that I have done thee / full well will I repay.\nNo more thy royal embraces / by me shall be withstood,\nFor now I well have seen it, / thou canst be lord o’er woman’s mood.”",
        "679",
        "From the couch rose Siegfried, / lying he left the maid,\nAs if that he would from him / lay his clothes aside.\nHe drew from off her finger / a ring of golden sheen\nWithout that e’er perceived / his practice the full noble queen.",
        "680",
        "Thereto he took her girdle / that was all richly wrought:\nIf from wanton spirit / he did it, know I not.\nThe same he gave to Kriemhild: / the which did sorrow bear.\nThen lay by one another / Gunther and the maiden fair.",
        "681",
        "Hearty were his embraces / as such king became:\nPerforce must she relinquish / her anger and her shame.\nIn sooth not little pallid / within his arms she grew,\nAnd in that love-surrender / how waned her mighty prowess too!",
        "682",
        "Then was e’en she not stronger / than e’er another bride;\nHe lay with fond embraces / the beauteous dame beside.\nAnd had she struggled further, / avail how could it aught?\nGunther, when thus he clasped her, / such change upon her strength had\n      wrought.",
        "683",
        "And with right inward pleasure / she too beside him lay\nIn warmest love embracings / until the dawn of day!\nMeantime now had Siegfried / departure ta’en from there,\nAnd was full well received / by a lady debonair.",
        "684",
        "Her questioning he avoided / and all whereon she thought,\nAnd long time kept he secret / what he for her had brought,\nUntil in his own country / she wore a royal crown;\nYet what for her he destined, / how sure at last it was her own.",
        "685",
        "Upon the morn was Gunther / by far of better mood\nThan he had been before it; / joy thus did spread abroad\n’Mid host of knights full noble / that from his lands around\nTo his court had been invited, / and there most willing service found.",

        "689",
        "Ere all the gifts so bounteous / were dealt the guests among,\nThey who would straightway homeward / did deem the waiting long.\nNe’er had guests of monarch / such goodly gifts before;\nAnd so as Gunther willed it / the merry feast at last was o’er.",
