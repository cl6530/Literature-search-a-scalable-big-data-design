        "Mary Stuart and Cleopatra are the two women who have most\nattracted the fancy of poets, dramatists, novelists, and painters,\nfrom their own time down to the present day.",
        "In some respects there is a certain likeness in their careers.\nEach was queen of a nation whose affairs were entangled with those\nof a much greater one. Each sought for her own ideal of love until\nshe found it. Each won that love recklessly, almost madly. Each,\nin its attainment, fell from power and fortune. Each died before\nher natural life was ended. One caused the man she loved to cast\naway the sovereignty of a mighty state. The other lost her own\ncrown in order that she might achieve the whole desire of her\nheart.",
        "There is still another parallel which may be found. Each of these\nwomen was reputed to be exquisitely beautiful; yet each fell short\nof beauty’s highest standards. They are alike remembered in song\nand story because of qualities that are far more powerful than any\nphysical charm can be. They impressed the imagination of their own\ncontemporaries just as they had impressed the imagination of all\nsucceeding ages, by reason of a strange and irresistible\nfascination which no one could explain, but which very few could\nexperience and resist.",
        "Mary Stuart was born six days before her father’s death, and when\nthe kingdom which was her heritage seemed to be almost in its\ndeath-throes. James V. of Scotland, half Stuart and half Tudor,\nwas no ordinary monarch. As a mere boy he had burst the bonds with\nwhich a regency had bound him, and he had ruled the wild Scotland\nof the sixteenth century. He was brave and crafty, keen in\nstatesmanship, and dissolute in pleasure.",
        "His first wife had given him no heirs; so at her death he sought\nout a princess whom he pursued all the more ardently because she\nwas also courted by the burly Henry VIII. of England. This girl\nwas Marie of Lorraine, daughter of the Duc de Guise. She was fit\nto be the mother of a lion’s brood, for she was above six feet in\nheight and of proportions so ample as to excite the admiration of\nthe royal voluptuary who sat upon the throne of England.",
        "“I am big,” said he, “and I want a wife who is as big as I am.”",
        "But James of Scotland wooed in person, and not by embassies, and\nhe triumphantly carried off his strapping princess. Henry of\nEngland gnawed his beard in vain; and, though in time he found\nconsolation in another woman’s arms, he viewed James not only as a\npublic but as a private enemy.",
        "There was war between the two countries. First the Scots repelled\nan English army; but soon they were themselves disgracefully\ndefeated at Solway Moss by a force much their inferior in numbers.\nThe shame of it broke King James’s heart. As he was galloping from\nthe battle-field the news was brought him that his wife had given\nbirth to a daughter. He took little notice of the message; and in\na few days he had died, moaning with his last breath the\nmysterious words:",
        "“It came with a lass–with a lass it will go!”",
        "The child who was born at this ill-omened crisis was Mary Stuart,\nwho within a week became, in her own right, Queen of Scotland. Her\nmother acted as regent of the kingdom. Henry of England demanded\nthat the infant girl should be betrothed to his young son, Prince\nEdward, who afterward reigned as Edward VI., though he died while\nstill a boy. The proposal was rejected, and the war between\nEngland and Scotland went on its bloody course; but meanwhile the\nlittle queen was sent to France, her mother’s home, so that she\nmight be trained in accomplishments which were rare in Scotland.",
        "In France she grew up at the court of Catherine de’ Medici, that\nimperious intriguer whose splendid surroundings were tainted with\nthe corruption which she had brought from her native Italy. It\nwas, indeed, a singular training-school for a girl of Mary\nStuart’s character. She saw about her a superficial chivalry and a\nmost profound depravity. Poets like Ronsard graced the life of the\ncourt with exquisite verse. Troubadours and minstrels sang sweet\nmusic there. There were fetes and tournaments and gallantry of\nbearing; yet, on the other hand, there was every possible\nrefinement and variety of vice. Men were slain before the eyes of\nthe queen herself. The talk of the court was of intrigue and lust\nand evil things which often verged on crime. Catherine de’ Medici\nherself kept her nominal husband at arm’s-length; and in order to\nmaintain her grasp on France she connived at the corruption of her\nown children, three of whom were destined in their turn to sit\nupon the throne.",
        "Mary Stuart grew up in these surroundings until she was sixteen,\neating the fruit which gave a knowledge of both good and evil. Her\nintelligence was very great. She quickly learned Italian, French,\nand Latin. She was a daring horsewoman. She was a poet and an\nartist even in her teens. She was also a keen judge of human\nmotives, for those early years of hers had forced her into a\nwomanhood that was premature but wonderful. It had been proposed\nthat she should marry the eldest son of Catherine, so that in time\nthe kingdom of Scotland and that of France might be united, while\nif Elizabeth of England were to die unmarried her realm also would\nfall to this pair of children.",
        "And so Mary, at sixteen, wedded the Dauphin Francis, who was a\nyear her junior. The prince was a wretched, whimpering little\ncreature, with a cankered body and a blighted soul. Marriage with\nsuch a husband seemed absurd. It never was a marriage in reality.\nThe sickly child would cry all night, for he suffered from\nabscesses in his ears, and his manhood had been prematurely taken\nfrom him. Nevertheless, within a twelvemonth the French king died\nand Mary Stuart was Queen of France as well as of Scotland,\nhampered only by her nominal obedience to the sick boy whom she\nopenly despised. At seventeen she showed herself a master spirit.\nShe held her own against the ambitious Catherine de’ Medici, whom\nshe contemptuously nicknamed “the apothecary’s daughter.” For the\nbrief period of a year she was actually the ruler of France; but\nthen her husband died and she was left a widow, restless,\nambitious, and yet no longer having any of the power she loved.",
        "Mary Stuart at this time had become a woman whose fascination was\nexerted over all who knew her. She was very tall and very slim,\nwith chestnut hair, “like a flower of the heat, both lax and\ndelicate.” Her skin was fair and pale, so clear and so transparent\nas to make the story plausible that when she drank from a flask of\nwine, the red liquid could be seen passing down her slender\nthroat.",
        "Yet with all this she was not fine in texture, but hardy as a man.\nShe could endure immense fatigue without yielding to it. Her\nsupple form had the strength of steel. There was a gleam in her\nhazel eyes that showed her to be brimful of an almost fierce\nvitality. Young as she was, she was the mistress of a thousand\narts, and she exhaled a sort of atmosphere that turned the heads\nof men. The Stuart blood made her impatient of control, careless\nof state, and easy-mannered. The French and the Tudor strain gave\nher vivacity. She could be submissive in appearance while still\npersisting in her aims. She could be languorous and seductive\nwhile cold within. Again, she could assume the haughtiness which\nbelonged to one who was twice a queen.",
        "Two motives swayed her, and they fought together for supremacy.\nOne was the love of power, and the other was the love of love. The\nfirst was natural to a girl who was a sovereign in her own right.\nThe second was inherited, and was then forced into a rank\nluxuriance by the sort of life that she had seen about her. At\neighteen she was a strangely amorous creature, given to fondling\nand kissing every one about her, with slight discrimination. From\nher sense of touch she received emotions that were almost\nnecessary to her existence. With her slender, graceful hands she\nwas always stroking the face of some favorite–it might be only\nthe face of a child, or it might be the face of some courtier or\npoet, or one of the four Marys whose names are linked with hers–\nMary Livingstone, Mary Fleming, Mary Beaton, and Mary Seton, the\nlast of whom remained with her royal mistress until her death.",
        "But one must not be too censorious in thinking of Mary Stuart. She\nwas surrounded everywhere by enemies. During her stay in France\nshe was hated by the faction of Catherine de’ Medici. When she\nreturned to Scotland she was hated because of her religion by the\nProtestant lords. Her every action was set forth in the worst\npossible light. The most sinister meaning was given to everything\nshe said or did. In truth, we must reject almost all the stories\nwhich accuse her of anything more than a certain levity of\nconduct.",
        "She was not a woman to yield herself in love’s last surrender\nunless her intellect and heart alike had been made captive. She\nwould listen to the passionate outpourings of poets and courtiers,\nand she would plunge her eyes into theirs, and let her hair just\ntouch their faces, and give them her white hands to kiss–but\nthat was all. Even in this she was only following the fashion of\nthe court where she was bred, and she was not unlike her royal\nrelative, Elizabeth of England, who had the same external\namorousness coupled with the same internal self-control.",
        "Mary Stuart’s love life makes a piteous story, for it is the life\nof one who was ever seeking–seeking for the man to whom she\ncould look up, who could be strong and brave and ardent like\nherself, and at the same time be more powerful and more steadfast\neven than she herself in mind and thought. Whatever may be said of\nher, and howsoever the facts may be colored by partisans, this\nroyal girl, stung though she was by passion and goaded by desire,\ncared nothing for any man who could not match her in body and mind\nand spirit all at once.",
        "It was in her early widowhood that she first met the man, and when\ntheir union came it brought ruin on them both. In France there\ncame to her one day one of her own subjects, the Earl of Bothwell.\nHe was but a few years older than she, and in his presence for the\nfirst time she felt, in her own despite, that profoundly moving,\nindescribable, and never-to-be-forgotten thrill which shakes a\nwoman to the very center of her being, since it is the recognition\nof a complete affinity.",
        "Lord Bothwell, like Queen Mary, has been terribly maligned. Unlike\nher, he has found only a few defenders. Maurice Hewlett has drawn\na picture of him more favorable than many, and yet it is a picture\nthat repels. Bothwell, says he, was of a type esteemed by those\nwho pronounce vice to be their virtue. He was “a galliard, flushed\nwith rich blood, broad-shouldered, square-jawed, with a laugh so\nhappy and so prompt that the world, rejoicing to hear it, thought\nall must be well wherever he might be. He wore brave clothes, sat\na brave horse, and kept brave company bravely. His high color,\nwhile it betokened high feeding, got him the credit of good\nhealth. His little eyes twinkled so merrily that you did not see\nthey were like a pig’s, sly and greedy at once, and bloodshot. His\ntawny beard concealed a jaw underhung, a chin jutting and\ndangerous. His mouth had a cruel twist; but his laughing hid that\ntoo. The bridge of his nose had been broken; few observed it, or\nguessed at the brawl which must have given it to him. Frankness\nwas his great charm, careless ease in high places.”",
        "And so, when Mary Stuart first met him in her eighteenth year,\nLord Bothwell made her think as she had never thought of any other\nman, and as she was not to think of any other man again. She grew\nto look eagerly for the frank mockery “in those twinkling eyes, in\nthat quick mouth\"; and to wonder whether it was with him always–\nasleep, at prayers, fighting, furious, or in love.",
        "Something more, however, must be said of Bothwell. He was\nundoubtedly a roisterer, but he was very much a man. He made easy\nlove to women. His sword leaped quickly from its sheath. He could\nfight, and he could also think. He was no brawling ruffian, no\nordinary rake. Remembering what Scotland was in those days,\nBothwell might well seem in reality a princely figure. He knew\nItalian; he was at home in French; he could write fluent Latin. He\nwas a collector of books and a reader of them also. He was perhaps\nthe only Scottish noble of his time who had a book-plate of his\nown. Here is something more than a mere reveler. Here is a man of\nvaried accomplishments and of a complex character.",
        "Though he stayed but a short time near the queen in France, he\nkindled her imagination, so that when she seriously thought of men\nshe thought of Bothwell. And yet all the time she was fondling the\nyoung pages in her retinue and kissing her maids of honor with her\nscarlet lips, and lying on their knees, while poets like Ronsard\nand Chastelard wrote ardent love sonnets to her and sighed and\npined for something more than the privilege of kissing her two\ndainty hands.",
        "In 1561, less than a year after her widowhood, Mary set sail for\nScotland, never to return. The great high-decked ships which\nescorted her sailed into the harbor of Leith, and she pressed on\nto Edinburgh. A depressing change indeed from the sunny terraces\nand fields of France! In her own realm were fog and rain and only\na hut to shelter her upon her landing. When she reached her\ncapital there were few welcoming cheers; but as she rode over the\ncobblestones to Holyrood, the squalid wynds vomited forth great\nmobs of hard-featured, grim-visaged men and women who stared with\ncuriosity and a half-contempt at the girl queen and her retinue of\nforeigners.",
        "The Scots were Protestants of the most dour sort, and they\ndistrusted their new ruler because of her religion and because she\nloved to surround herself with dainty things and bright colors and\nexotic elegance. They feared lest she should try to repeal the law\nof Scotland’s Parliament which had made the country Protestant.",
        "The very indifference of her subjects stirred up the nobler part\nof Mary’s nature. For a time she was indeed a queen. She governed\nwisely. She respected the religious rights of her Protestant\nsubjects. She strove to bring order out of the chaos into which\nher country had fallen. And she met with some success. The time\ncame when her people cheered her as she rode among them. Her\nsubtle fascination was her greatest source of strength. Even John\nKnox, that iron-visaged, stentorian preacher, fell for a time\nunder the charm of her presence. She met him frankly and pleaded\nwith him as a woman, instead of commanding him as a queen. The\nsurly ranter became softened for a time, and, though he spoke of\nher to others as “Honeypot,” he ruled his tongue in public. She\nhad offers of marriage from Austrian and Spanish princes. The new\nKing of France, her brother-in-law, would perhaps have wedded her.\nIt mattered little to Mary that Elizabeth of England was hostile.\nShe felt that she was strong enough to hold her own and govern\nScotland.",
        "But who could govern a country such as Scotland was? It was a land\nof broils and feuds, of clan enmities and fierce vendettas. Its\nnobles were half barbarous, and they fought and slashed at one\nanother with drawn dirks almost in the presence of the queen\nherself. No matter whom she favored, there rose up a swarm of\nenemies. Here was a Corsica of the north, more savage and untamed\nthan even the other Corsica.",
        "In her perplexity Mary felt a woman’s need of some man on whom she\nwould have the right to lean, and whom she could make king\nconsort. She thought that she had found him in the person of her\ncousin, Lord Darnley, a Catholic, and by his upbringing half an\nEnglishman. Darnley came to Scotland, and for the moment Mary\nfancied that she had forgotten Bothwell. Here again she was in\nlove with love, and she idealized the man who came to give it to\nher. Darnley seemed, indeed, well worthy to be loved, for he was\ntall and handsome, appearing well on horseback and having some of\nthe accomplishments which Mary valued.",
        "It was a hasty wooing, and the queen herself was first of all the\nwooer. Her quick imagination saw in Darnley traits and gifts of\nwhich he really had no share. Therefore, the marriage was soon\nconcluded, and Scotland had two sovereigns, King Henry and Queen\nMary. So sure was Mary of her indifference to Bothwell that she\nurged the earl to marry, and he did marry a girl of the great\nhouse of Gordon.",
        "Mary’s self-suggested love for Darnley was extinguished almost on\nher wedding-night. The man was a drunkard who came into her\npresence befuddled and almost bestial. He had no brains. His\nvanity was enormous. He loved no one but himself, and least of all\nthis queen, whom he regarded as having thrown herself at his empty\nhead.",
        "The first-fruits of the marriage were uprisings among the\nProtestant lords. Mary then showed herself a heroic queen. At the\nhead of a motley band of soldiery who came at her call–half-\nclad, uncouth, and savage–she rode into the west, sleeping at\nnight upon the bare ground, sharing the camp food, dressed in\nplain tartan, but swift and fierce as any eagle. Her spirit ran\nlike fire through the veins of those who followed her. She crushed\nthe insurrection, scattered its leaders, and returned in triumph\nto her capital.",
        "Now she was really queen, but here came in the other motive which\nwas interwoven in her character. She had shown herself a man in\ncourage. Should she not have the pleasures of a woman? To her\ncourt in Holyrood came Bothwell once again, and this time Mary\nknew that he was all the world to her. Darnley had shrunk from the\nhardships of battle. He was steeped in low intrigues. He roused\nthe constant irritation of the queen by his folly and utter lack\nof sense and decency. Mary felt she owed him nothing, but she\nforgot that she owed much to herself.",
        "Her old amorous ways came back to her, and she relapsed into the\njoys of sense. The scandal-mongers of the capital saw a lover in\nevery man with whom she talked. She did, in fact, set convention\nat defiance. She dressed in men’s clothing. She showed what the\nunemotional Scots thought to be unseemly levity. The French poet,\nChastelard, misled by her external signs of favor, believed\nhimself to be her choice. At the end of one mad revel he was found\nsecreted beneath her bed, and was driven out by force. A second\ntime he ventured to secrete himself within the covers of the bed.\nThen he was dragged forth, imprisoned, and condemned to death. He\nmet his fate without a murmur, save at the last when he stood upon\nthe scaffold and, gazing toward the palace, cried in French:",
        "“Oh, cruel queen! I die for you!”",
        "Another favorite, the Italian, David Rizzio, or Riccio, in like\nmanner wrote love verses to the queen, and she replied to them in\nkind; but there is no evidence that she valued him save for his\nability, which was very great. She made him her foreign secretary,\nand the man whom he supplanted worked on the jealousy of Darnley;\nso that one night, while Mary and Rizzio were at dinner in a small\nprivate chamber, Darnley and the others broke in upon her. Darnley\nheld her by the waist while Rizzio was stabbed before her eyes\nwith a cruelty the greater because the queen was soon to become a\nmother.",
        "From that moment she hated Darnley as one would hate a snake. She\ntolerated him only that he might acknowledge her child as his son.\nThis child was the future James VI. of Scotland and James I. of\nEngland. It is recorded of him that never throughout his life\ncould he bear to look upon drawn steel.",
        "After this Mary summoned Bothwell again and again. It was revealed\nto her as in a blaze of light that, after all, he was the one and\nonly man who could be everything to her. His frankness, his\ncynicism, his mockery, his carelessness, his courage, and the\npower of his mind matched her moods completely. She threw away all\nsemblance of concealment. She ignored the fact that he had married\nat her wish. She was queen. She desired him. She must have him at\nany cost.",
        "“Though I lose Scotland and England both,” she cried in a passion\nof abandonment, “I shall have him for my own!”",
        "Bothwell, in his turn, was nothing loath, and they leaped at each\nother like two flames.",
        "It was then that Mary wrote those letters which were afterward\ndiscovered in a casket and which were used against her when she\nwas on trial for her life. These so-called Casket Letters, though\nwe have not now the originals, are among the most extraordinary\nletters ever written. All shame, all hesitation, all innocence,\nare flung away in them. The writer is so fired with passion that\neach sentence is like a cry to a lover in the dark. As De Peyster\nsays: “In them the animal instincts override and spur and lash the\npen.” Mary was committing to paper the frenzied madness of a woman\nconsumed to her very marrow by the scorching blaze of unedurable\ndesire.",
        "Events moved quickly. Darnley, convalescent from an attack of\nsmallpox, was mysteriously destroyed by an explosion of gunpowder.\nBothwell was divorced from his young wife on curious grounds. A\ndispensation allowed Mary to wed a Protestant, and she married\nBothwell three months after Darnley’s death.",
        "Here one sees the consummation of what had begun many years before\nin France. From the moment that she and Bothwell met, their union\nwas inevitable. Seas could not sunder them. Other loves and other\nfancies were as nothing to them. Even the bonds of marriage were\nburst asunder so that these two fiery, panting souls could meet.",
        "It was the irony of fate that when they had so met it was only to\nbe parted. Mary’s subjects, outraged by her conduct, rose against\nher. As she passed through the streets of Edinburgh the women\nhurled after her indecent names. Great banners were raised with\nexecrable daubs representing the murdered Darnley. The short and\ndreadful monosyllable which is familiar to us in the pages of the\nBible was hurled after her wherever she went.",
        "With Bothwell by her side she led a wild and ragged horde of\nfollowers against the rebellious nobles, whose forces met her at\nCarberry Hill. Her motley followers melted away, and Mary\nsurrendered to the hostile chieftains, who took her to the castle\nat Lochleven. There she became the mother of twins–a fact that is\nseldom mentioned by historians. These children were the fruit of\nher union with Bothwell. From this time forth she cared but little\nfor herself, and she signed, without great reluctance, a document\nby which she abdicated in favor of her infant son.",
        "Even in this place of imprisonment, however, her fascination had\npower to charm. Among those who guarded her, two of the Douglas\nfamily–George Douglas and William Douglas–for love of her,\neffected her escape. The first attempt failed. Mary, disguised as\na laundress, was betrayed by the delicacy of her hands. But a\nsecond attempt was successful. The queen passed through a postern\ngate and made her way to the lake, where George Douglas met her\nwith a boat. Crossing the lake, fifty horsemen under Lord Claude\nHamilton gave her their escort and bore her away in safety.",
        "But Mary was sick of Scotland, for Bothwell could not be there.\nShe had tasted all the bitterness of life, and for a few months\nall the sweetness; but she would have no more of this rough and\nbarbarous country. Of her own free will she crossed the Solway\ninto England, to find herself at once a prisoner.",
        "Never again did she set eyes on Bothwell. After the battle of\nCarberry Hill he escaped to the north, gathered some ships\ntogether, and preyed upon English merchantmen, very much as a\npirate might have done. Ere long, however, when he had learned of\nMary’s fate, he set sail for Norway. King Frederick of Denmark\nmade him a prisoner of state. He was not confined within prison\nwalls, however, but was allowed to hunt and ride in the vicinity\nof Malmo Castle and of Dragsholm. It is probably in Malmo Castle\nthat he died. In 1858 a coffin which was thought to be the coffin\nof the earl was opened, and a Danish artist sketched the head–\nwhich corresponds quite well with the other portraits of the ill-\nfated Scottish noble.",
        "It is a sad story. Had Mary been less ambitious when she first met\nBothwell, or had he been a little bolder, they might have reigned\ntogether and lived out their lives in the plenitude of that great\nlove which held them both in thrall. But a queen is not as other\nwomen; and she found too late that the teaching of her heart was,\nafter all, the truest teaching. She went to her death as Bothwell\nwent to his, alone, in a strange, unfriendly land.",
        "Yet, even this, perhaps, was better so. It has at least touched\nboth their lives with pathos and has made the name of Mary Stuart\none to be remembered throughout all the ages.",
