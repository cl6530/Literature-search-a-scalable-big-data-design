        "The city of York is one of the most famous and interesting in the\nkingdom. It was originally the Eborac of the British and the\nEboracum of the Romans, who made it an imperial colony, and the\ncapital of Maxima Caesariensis. Later the place changed hands many\ntimes between Danes and Saxons until the time of William the Conqueror,\nwho built the castle. The whole city was burnt in 1137, with the\ncathedral and forty churches, and in the Wars of the Roses it was\ncontinually the scene of sanguinary conflicts between the rival parties.\nIt has been visited at various times by nearly all our kings, and\nnumerous insurrections have been quelled within its walls. The\ncathedral–the chief glory of York–dates from Saxon times. The first\nchurch was founded by Edwin, the fifth king of Northumbria, but before\nit was finished he was slain, and the work thenceforward was carried out\nby his successor Oswald. The present cathedral was mainly built in the\nthirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Its chief features are a nave with\nthe most magnificent side-aisles in the kingdom, two transepts, a choir,\na lady chapel, a large central tower, two bell towers, and a wonderfully\nfine chapter-house. During the last century it was twice nearly\ndestroyed by fire, first by the act of a lunatic, and then by the\ncarelessness of a workman.",
        "The present structure takes rank with the finest specimens of Gothic\narchitecture in the world.",
        "Apart from the minster, the whole city teems with archaeological\ninterest. There are many fine old churches, and much mediaeval\narchitecture, including the gates of the city, which are wonderfully\nwell preserved, one of the best being Micklegate Bar, where Richard Duke\nof York’s head was exhibited. The city walls built by Edward I. still\nremain in a remarkably good state of preservation. Many of the towers,\nof which Leland stated there were forty, still exist.",
