        "Long before you or I were born, there reigned, in a country a great\nway off, a king who had three sons. This king once fell very ill–so\nill that nobody thought he could live. His sons were very much grieved\nat their father’s sickness; and as they were walking together very\nmournfully in the garden of the palace, a little old man met them and\nasked what was the matter. They told him that their father was very\nill, and that they were afraid nothing could save him. ’I know what\nwould,’ said the little old man; ’it is the Water of Life. If he could\nhave a draught of it he would be well again; but it is very hard to\nget.’ Then the eldest son said, ’I will soon find it’: and he went to\nthe sick king, and begged that he might go in search of the Water of\nLife, as it was the only thing that could save him. ’No,’ said the\nking. ’I had rather die than place you in such great danger as you\nmust meet with in your journey.’ But he begged so hard that the king\nlet him go; and the prince thought to himself, ’If I bring my father\nthis water, he will make me sole heir to his kingdom.’",
        "Then he set out: and when he had gone on his way some time he came to\na deep valley, overhung with rocks and woods; and as he looked around,\nhe saw standing above him on one of the rocks a little ugly dwarf,\nwith a sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak; and the dwarf called to him\nand said, ’Prince, whither so fast?’ ’What is that to thee, you ugly\nimp?’ said the prince haughtily, and rode on.",
        "But the dwarf was enraged at his behaviour, and laid a fairy spell of\nill-luck upon him; so that as he rode on the mountain pass became\nnarrower and narrower, and at last the way was so straitened that he\ncould not go to step forward: and when he thought to have turned his\nhorse round and go back the way he came, he heard a loud laugh ringing\nround him, and found that the path was closed behind him, so that he\nwas shut in all round. He next tried to get off his horse and make his\nway on foot, but again the laugh rang in his ears, and he found\nhimself unable to move a step, and thus he was forced to abide\nspellbound.",
        "Meantime the old king was lingering on in daily hope of his son’s\nreturn, till at last the second son said, ’Father, I will go in search\nof the Water of Life.’ For he thought to himself, ’My brother is\nsurely dead, and the kingdom will fall to me if I find the water.’ The\nking was at first very unwilling to let him go, but at last yielded to\nhis wish. So he set out and followed the same road which his brother\nhad done, and met with the same elf, who stopped him at the same spot\nin the mountains, saying, as before, ’Prince, prince, whither so\nfast?’ ’Mind your own affairs, busybody!’ said the prince scornfully,\nand rode on.",
        "But the dwarf put the same spell upon him as he put on his elder\nbrother, and he, too, was at last obliged to take up his abode in the\nheart of the mountains. Thus it is with proud silly people, who think\nthemselves above everyone else, and are too proud to ask or take\nadvice.",
        "When the second prince had thus been gone a long time, the youngest\nson said he would go and search for the Water of Life, and trusted he\nshould soon be able to make his father well again. So he set out, and\nthe dwarf met him too at the same spot in the valley, among the\nmountains, and said, ’Prince, whither so fast?’ And the prince said,\n’I am going in search of the Water of Life, because my father is ill,\nand like to die: can you help me? Pray be kind, and aid me if you\ncan!’ ’Do you know where it is to be found?’ asked the dwarf. ’No,’\nsaid the prince, ’I do not. Pray tell me if you know.’ ’Then as you\nhave spoken to me kindly, and are wise enough to seek for advice, I\nwill tell you how and where to go. The water you seek springs from a\nwell in an enchanted castle; and, that you may be able to reach it in\nsafety, I will give you an iron wand and two little loaves of bread;\nstrike the iron door of the castle three times with the wand, and it\nwill open: two hungry lions will be lying down inside gaping for their\nprey, but if you throw them the bread they will let you pass; then\nhasten on to the well, and take some of the Water of Life before the\nclock strikes twelve; for if you tarry longer the door will shut upon\nyou for ever.’",
        "Then the prince thanked his little friend with the scarlet cloak for\nhis friendly aid, and took the wand and the bread, and went travelling\non and on, over sea and over land, till he came to his journey’s end,\nand found everything to be as the dwarf had told him. The door flew\nopen at the third stroke of the wand, and when the lions were quieted\nhe went on through the castle and came at length to a beautiful hall.\nAround it he saw several knights sitting in a trance; then he pulled\noff their rings and put them on his own fingers. In another room he\nsaw on a table a sword and a loaf of bread, which he also took.\nFurther on he came to a room where a beautiful young lady sat upon a\ncouch; and she welcomed him joyfully, and said, if he would set her\nfree from the spell that bound her, the kingdom should be his, if he\nwould come back in a year and marry her. Then she told him that the\nwell that held the Water of Life was in the palace gardens; and bade\nhim make haste, and draw what he wanted before the clock struck\ntwelve.",
        "He walked on; and as he walked through beautiful gardens he came to a\ndelightful shady spot in which stood a couch; and he thought to\nhimself, as he felt tired, that he would rest himself for a while, and\ngaze on the lovely scenes around him. So he laid himself down, and\nsleep fell upon him unawares, so that he did not wake up till the\nclock was striking a quarter to twelve. Then he sprang from the couch\ndreadfully frightened, ran to the well, filled a cup that was standing\nby him full of water, and hastened to get away in time. Just as he was\ngoing out of the iron door it struck twelve, and the door fell so\nquickly upon him that it snapped off a piece of his heel.",
        "When he found himself safe, he was overjoyed to think that he had got\nthe Water of Life; and as he was going on his way homewards, he passed\nby the little dwarf, who, when he saw the sword and the loaf, said,\n’You have made a noble prize; with the sword you can at a blow slay\nwhole armies, and the bread will never fail you.’ Then the prince\nthought to himself, ’I cannot go home to my father without my\nbrothers’; so he said, ’My dear friend, cannot you tell me where my\ntwo brothers are, who set out in search of the Water of Life before\nme, and never came back?’ ’I have shut them up by a charm between two\nmountains,’ said the dwarf, ’because they were proud and ill-behaved,\nand scorned to ask advice.’ The prince begged so hard for his\nbrothers, that the dwarf at last set them free, though unwillingly,\nsaying, ’Beware of them, for they have bad hearts.’ Their brother,\nhowever, was greatly rejoiced to see them, and told them all that had\nhappened to him; how he had found the Water of Life, and had taken a\ncup full of it; and how he had set a beautiful princess free from a\nspell that bound her; and how she had engaged to wait a whole year,\nand then to marry him, and to give him the kingdom.",
        "Then they all three rode on together, and on their way home came to a\ncountry that was laid waste by war and a dreadful famine, so that it\nwas feared all must die for want. But the prince gave the king of the\nland the bread, and all his kingdom ate of it. And he lent the king\nthe wonderful sword, and he slew the enemy’s army with it; and thus\nthe kingdom was once more in peace and plenty. In the same manner he\nbefriended two other countries through which they passed on their way.",
        "When they came to the sea, they got into a ship and during their\nvoyage the two eldest said to themselves, ’Our brother has got the\nwater which we could not find, therefore our father will forsake us\nand give him the kingdom, which is our right’; so they were full of\nenvy and revenge, and agreed together how they could ruin him. Then\nthey waited till he was fast asleep, and poured the Water of Life out\nof the cup, and took it for themselves, giving him bitter sea-water\ninstead.",
        "When they came to their journey’s end, the youngest son brought his\ncup to the sick king, that he might drink and be healed. Scarcely,\nhowever, had he tasted the bitter sea-water when he became worse even\nthan he was before; and then both the elder sons came in, and blamed\nthe youngest for what they had done; and said that he wanted to poison\ntheir father, but that they had found the Water of Life, and had\nbrought it with them. He no sooner began to drink of what they brought\nhim, than he felt his sickness leave him, and was as strong and well\nas in his younger days. Then they went to their brother, and laughed\nat him, and said, ’Well, brother, you found the Water of Life, did\nyou? You have had the trouble and we shall have the reward. Pray, with\nall your cleverness, why did not you manage to keep your eyes open?\nNext year one of us will take away your beautiful princess, if you do\nnot take care. You had better say nothing about this to our father,\nfor he does not believe a word you say; and if you tell tales, you\nshall lose your life into the bargain: but be quiet, and we will let\nyou off.’",
        "The old king was still very angry with his youngest son, and thought\nthat he really meant to have taken away his life; so he called his\ncourt together, and asked what should be done, and all agreed that he\nought to be put to death. The prince knew nothing of what was going\non, till one day, when the king’s chief huntsmen went a-hunting with\nhim, and they were alone in the wood together, the huntsman looked so\nsorrowful that the prince said, ’My friend, what is the matter with\nyou?’ ’I cannot and dare not tell you,’ said he. But the prince begged\nvery hard, and said, ’Only tell me what it is, and do not think I\nshall be angry, for I will forgive you.’ ’Alas!’ said the huntsman;\n’the king has ordered me to shoot you.’ The prince started at this,\nand said, ’Let me live, and I will change dresses with you; you shall\ntake my royal coat to show to my father, and do you give me your\nshabby one.’ ’With all my heart,’ said the huntsman; ’I am sure I\nshall be glad to save you, for I could not have shot you.’ Then he\ntook the prince’s coat, and gave him the shabby one, and went away\nthrough the wood.",
        "Some time after, three grand embassies came to the old king’s court,\nwith rich gifts of gold and precious stones for his youngest son; now\nall these were sent from the three kings to whom he had lent his sword\nand loaf of bread, in order to rid them of their enemy and feed their\npeople. This touched the old king’s heart, and he thought his son\nmight still be guiltless, and said to his court, ’O that my son were\nstill alive! how it grieves me that I had him killed!’ ’He is still\nalive,’ said the huntsman; ’and I am glad that I had pity on him, but\nlet him go in peace, and brought home his royal coat.’ At this the\nking was overwhelmed with joy, and made it known thoughout all his\nkingdom, that if his son would come back to his court he would forgive\nhim.",
        "Meanwhile the princess was eagerly waiting till her deliverer should\ncome back; and had a road made leading up to her palace all of shining\ngold; and told her courtiers that whoever came on horseback, and rode\nstraight up to the gate upon it, was her true lover; and that they\nmust let him in: but whoever rode on one side of it, they must be sure\nwas not the right one; and that they must send him away at once.",
        "The time soon came, when the eldest brother thought that he would make\nhaste to go to the princess, and say that he was the one who had set\nher free, and that he should have her for his wife, and the kingdom\nwith her. As he came before the palace and saw the golden road, he\nstopped to look at it, and he thought to himself, ’It is a pity to\nride upon this beautiful road’; so he turned aside and rode on the\nright-hand side of it. But when he came to the gate, the guards, who\nhad seen the road he took, said to him, he could not be what he said\nhe was, and must go about his business.",
        "The second prince set out soon afterwards on the same errand; and when\nhe came to the golden road, and his horse had set one foot upon it, he\nstopped to look at it, and thought it very beautiful, and said to\nhimself, ’What a pity it is that anything should tread here!’ Then he\ntoo turned aside and rode on the left side of it. But when he came to\nthe gate the guards said he was not the true prince, and that he too\nmust go away about his business; and away he went.",
        "Now when the full year was come round, the third brother left the\nforest in which he had lain hid for fear of his father’s anger, and\nset out in search of his betrothed bride. So he journeyed on, thinking\nof her all the way, and rode so quickly that he did not even see what\nthe road was made of, but went with his horse straight over it; and as\nhe came to the gate it flew open, and the princess welcomed him with\njoy, and said he was her deliverer, and should now be her husband and\nlord of the kingdom. When the first joy at their meeting was over, the\nprincess told him she had heard of his father having forgiven him, and\nof his wish to have him home again: so, before his wedding with the\nprincess, he went to visit his father, taking her with him. Then he\ntold him everything; how his brothers had cheated and robbed him, and\nyet that he had borne all those wrongs for the love of his father. And\nthe old king was very angry, and wanted to punish his wicked sons; but\nthey made their escape, and got into a ship and sailed away over the\nwide sea, and where they went to nobody knew and nobody cared.",
        "And now the old king gathered together his court, and asked all his\nkingdom to come and celebrate the wedding of his son and the princess.\nAnd young and old, noble and squire, gentle and simple, came at once\non the summons; and among the rest came the friendly dwarf, with the\nsugarloaf hat, and a new scarlet cloak.",
        "  And the wedding was held, and the merry bells run.\n  And all the good people they danced and they sung,\n  And feasted and frolick’d I can’t tell how long.",
