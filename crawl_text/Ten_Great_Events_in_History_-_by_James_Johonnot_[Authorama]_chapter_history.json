        "Patriotism, or love of country, is one of the tests of nobility of\ncharacter. No great man ever lived that was not a patriot in the\nhighest and truest sense. From the earliest times, the sentiment of\npatriotism has been aroused in the hearts of men by the narrative of\nheroic deeds inspired by love of country and love of liberty. This\ntruth furnishes the key to the arrangement and method of the present\nwork. The ten epochs treated are those that have been potential in\nshaping subsequent events; and when men have struck blows for human\nliberty against odds and regardless of personal consequences. The\nsimple narrative carries its own morals, and the most profitable work\nfor the teacher will be to merely supplement the narrative so that the\npicture presented shall be all the more vivid. Moral reflections are\nwearisome and superfluous.",
        "1. The great events in history are those where, upon special\noccasions, a man or a people have made a stand against tyranny, and\nhave preserved or advanced freedom for the people. Sometimes tyranny\nhas taken the form of the oppression of the many by the few in the\nsame nation, and sometimes it has been the oppression of a weak nation\nby a stronger one. The successful revolt against tyranny, the terrible\nconflict resulting in the emancipation of a people, has always been\nthe favorite theme of the historian, marking as it does a step in the\nprogress of mankind from a savage to a civilized state.",
        "2. One of the earliest as well as most notable of these conflicts of\nwhich we have an authentic account took place in Greece twenty-four\nhundred years ago, or five hundred years before the Christian era. At\nthat time nearly all of Europe was inhabited by rude barbarous tribes.\nIn all that broad land the arts and sciences which denote civilization\nhad made their appearance only in the small and apparently\ninsignificant peninsula of Greece, lying on the extreme southeast\nborder adjoining Asia.",
        "3. At a period before authentic history begins, it is probable that\nroving tribes of shepherds from the north took possession of the hills\nand valleys of Greece. Shut off on the north by mountain ranges, and\non all other sides surrounded by the sea, these tribes were able to\nmaintain a sturdy independence for many hundred years. The numerous\nharbors and bays which subdivide Greece invited to a maritime life,\nand at a very early time, the descendants of the original shepherds\nbecame skillful navigators and courageous adventurers.",
        "4. The voyages of Aeneas and Ulysses in the siege of Troy, and those\nof Jason in search of the golden fleece, and of Perseus to the court\nof King Minos, are the mythological accounts, embellished by\nimagination and distorted by time, of what were real voyages. Crossing\nthe Mediterranean, Grecian adventurers became acquainted with the\nEgyptians, then the most civilized people of the world; and from Egypt\nthey took back to their native country the germs of the arts and\nsciences which afterward made Greece so famous.",
        "5. Thence improvements went forward with rapid strides. Hints received\nfrom Egypt were reproduced in higher forms. Massive temples became\nlight and airy, rude sculpture became beautiful by conforming to\nnatural forms, and hieroglyphics developed into the letters which\nCadmus invented or improved. Schools were established, athletic sports\nwere encouraged, aesthetic taste was developed, until in the arts, in\nphilosophy, in science, and in literature the Greeks took the lead of\nall peoples.",
        "6. As population increased, colonies went out, settling upon the\nadjacent coasts of Asia and upon the islands farther west. In Asia the\nGreek colonists were subject to the Persian Empire, which then\nextended its rule over all Western Asia, and claimed dominion over\nAfrica and Eastern Europe. The Greeks, fresh from the freedom of their\nnative land, could not patiently endure the extortions of the Persian\ngovernment, to which their own people submitted without question;\nhence conflicts arose which finally culminated in Persia taking\ncomplete possession of the Asiatic Greek cities.",
        "7. But the ties of kinship were strong, and the people of Greece\nkeenly resented the tyranny which had been exercised over their\ncountrymen, and an irrepressible conflict arose between the two\nnations. The Persian king, Darius, determined to put an end to all\nannoyance by invading and subjugating Greece. Before the final march\nof his army, Darius sent heralds throughout Greece demanding soil and\nwater as an acknowledgment of the supremacy of Persia, but Herodotus\nsays that at Sparta, when this impudent demand was made, the heralds\nwere thrown into wells and told to help themselves to all the earth\nand water they liked.",
        "8. After a long preparation, in 490 B.C., an army of one hundred\nthousand men or more, under the command of Artaphernes, convoyed by a\nformidable fleet, invaded Greece. For a long time it met with little\nopposition, and city after city submitted to the overwhelming hosts of\nthe Persian king. The approach to Athens was regarded as the final\nturning point of the war.",
        "9. Artaphernes selected the Plains of Marathon, twenty-two miles to\nthe northeast of Athens, as the place of his final landing. His\nforces, by the lowest estimate, consisted of one hundred and fifty\nthousand men, of which ten thousand were cavalry. To these were\nopposed the army of Athens and its allies, consisting in all of ten\nthousand men. The battle-ground forms an irregular crescent, six miles\nlong and two broad in its widest part. It is bounded on one side by\nthe sea, and on the other by a rampart of mountains. At the time of\nthe battle the extremities of the plain were flanked by swamps,\ndiminishing the extent of the front, and hampering the operations of\nthe larger army. The command of the Greek army had been intrusted to\nten generals, who ruled successively one day each. Themistocles, one\nof these generals, resigned his day in favor of Miltiades, and all the\nothers followed his example. And so the battle was set, ten thousand\nGreeks, under Miltiades, against the overwhelming hosts of the enemy.",
        "10. The Persians, confident in their numbers, erected no\nintrenchments. They did not dream of an attack from the little band of\nGreeks. There is evidence to believe that they were dissatisfied with\nthe nature of the battle-field they had chosen, and were upon the\npoint of embarking to land at some point nearer the city. If this was\nthe case, they were very rudely awakened from their dream of security\nby the movement of the Greeks.",
        "11. On the morning of the tenth day after leaving Athens, Miltiades\ndrew up his army in order of battle. He was obliged to perilously\nweaken his center in order to confront the whole of the Persian army,\nso as to avoid the danger of being outflanked and surrounded. The\nGreeks began the battle by a furious attack along the whole line,\nendeavoring to close in a hand-to-hand conflict as soon as possible,\nso as to avoid the deadly arrows of the Persians, and to take the\nadvantage of their heavier arms. The Persians were greatly astonished\nwhen they saw this little band rushing against them with such a\nheadlong dash, and thought that the Greeks must have been seized with\nmadness. The Persian general had concentrated his forces at the\ncenter, and at this part of the battle-field the fiery onset of Greeks\nwas checked by mere weight of numbers. But at length the mighty\nPersian force moved irresistibly forward, forcing the Greeks slowly\nbackward, fighting, dying, but never yielding. Soon the Greek army\nwere cut in two, and the Persians marched proudly onward to assured\nvictory.",
        "12. But the battle was not yet over. The genius of Miltiades had\nanticipated this result. The wings of the Greek army, strengthened at\nthe expense of the center, fell upon the weakened wings of the\nPersians with irresistable onset. The invaders were forced back step\nby step, the retreat soon changing into a wild and promiscuous rout,\nand two thirds of the Persian army ceased to exist as a fighting\nforce. The victorious Greeks now turned their attention to the Persian\ncenter, falling upon its flanks with incredible fury. Surrounded on\nall sides, for a time the Persians maintained their old reputation as\nvaliant soldiers, but nothing could withstand the impetuosity of the\nGreeks, and soon the whole of the invading hosts were in tumultuous\nretreat.",
        "13. The victorious Greeks pressed rapidly forward to prevent the foe\nfrom embarking, and, if possible, to capture some of the ships. But\nthe Persian archers held the victors in check until the flying\nsoldiery were embarked, and the Greeks obtained possession of only\nseven vessels. But they were left in undisputed possession of the\nfield of battle, the camp of the enemy, and an immense amount of\ntreasure which had been abandoned in the precipitate flight. Six\nthousand four hundred Persian dead remained on the plain, while the\nGreek loss was one hundred and ninety-two.",
        "14. All Athens hastened to welcome the brave soldiery. A Spartan\nforce, on its way to join the Athenians, arrived too late to take part\nin the battle, and they quietly returned home. As the news spread,\nloud and frantic rejoicings were heard throughout Greece, and the name\nof Persia, so long a dread and a menace, lost much of its terrors.",
        "15. But the battle of Marathon, and the victory of Miltiades, had a\nwider significance than could enter into the imaginations of then\nliving man. It was a conflict between the barbarism of Asia and the\ndawning civilization of Europe, between Oriental despotism and human\nliberty. The victory rendered normal human growth possible, and, to\nuse the expressive phrase of the modern poet–",
        "  “Henceforth to the sunset, unchecked on its way,\n   Shall liberty follow the march of the day.”",
        "It was not for the Greeks alone, but for all ages and all peoples; and\nin this Western World, when we celebrate the birth of our own country,\nwe should ever keep in mind the desperate struggle at Marathon, and\nthe valor of Miltiades and his Greek soldiery.",
        "16. But the war was not yet over. A single defeat did not extinguish\nthe hopes of the Persian monarch, nor exhaust the resources of his\nempire. Herodotus says: “Now Darius was very bitter against the\nAthenians, and when he heard the tale of the battle of Marathon he was\nmuch more wroth, and desired much more eagerly to march against\nHellas. Straightway he sent heralds to all the cities, and bade them\nmake ready an army, and to furnish much more than they had done\nbefore, both ships, and horses, and corn; and while the heralds were\ngoing round, all Asia was shaken for three years; but in the fourth\nyear the Egyptians, who had been made slaves by Cambyses, rebelled\nagainst the Persians, and then the king sought only the more\nvehemently to go both against the Egyptians and against the Greeks. So\nhe named Xerxes, his son, to be king over the Persians after himself,\nand made ready to march. But in the year after the revolt of Egypt,\nDarius himself died; nor was he suffered to punish the Athenians or\nthe Egyptians who had rebelled against him.”",
        "17. The death of Darius gave Greece a respite, but the final conflict\nwas only postponed. Xerxes was weak, obstinate, and vain-glorious, but\nhe inherited all his father’s hatred of the Greeks, and he resolved\nupon one supreme effort to reduce them to subjection. For seven years\nmore the whole vast Persian empire resounded with the notes of\npreparation. In 480 B.C., ten years after the battle of Marathon,\neverything was in readiness. A formidable fleet had been built and\nequipped, corn and military stores had been collected to a vast\namount, and an army had gathered which, including camp followers, was\nvariously estimated at from three to five millions. A bridge of boats\nwas built across the Hellespont, and the Oriental horde was prepared\nto ravage the Grecian valleys like a swarm of devouring locusts. A\ngreat storm arose and destroyed the bridge, and the Persian despot\nordered the Hellespont scourged with whips in token of his\ndispleasure. When the bridge was rebuilt, Xerxes, from a throne\nerected upon the shore, for seven days and nights, watched his mighty\nhost pass over from Asia into Europe.",
        "18. In the mean time the Greeks were preparing for the onset. Sparta,\ntrue to her military organization, did little but to bring her army to\nthe perfection of discipline, and many of the weaker cities resolved\nto quietly submit to the invaders. The Athenians alone seemed to have\nfully understood the gravity of the situation. To them the rage of the\nPersian king was particularly directed, for the crushing defeat at\nMarathon, and Athens was more exposed than any other of the Greek\ncities. During the ten years Athens raised and equipped as large an\narmy as her population would warrant. Every able-bodied man was\nenrolled in the ranks. Food and military stores were collected, but\nthe chief means of defense was a novel one, and showed the desperate\nnature of the conflict in which they were about to engage. Under the\nwise direction of Themistocles they built a formidable fleet, so large\nthat in case of emergency the whole population of the city could\nembark, and either remain afloat or take refuge on the neighboring\nislands.",
        "19. A congress of the cities had determined to oppose the approach of\nXerxes at some favorable place by a combined army. At the head of the\nMaliac gulf there was a narrow pass, through which the Persians had to\ngo, the road running between a mountain and a swamp which stretched to\nthe sea; and at one place the swamp came so near the mountain that\nthere was hardly room for the road to run between. This is the famous\npass of Thermopylæ; and here it was that a small army might block the\nway against any number of the enemy. Across this pass a wall was\nbuilt, and behind it was posted the Greek army under the command of\nLeonidas, the Spartan king. His forces consisted of three hundred\nSpartans, seven hundred Thespians, and about four thousand more from\nthe various Grecian cities. The Persians approached, and for four days\nwaited, expecting to see the Greek army disperse at the very sight of\ntheir formidable numbers. But as they were apparently not frightened,\non the fifth day the Persians made an attack. For two days the battle\ncontinued, inflicting great losses upon the Persians, while the little\narmy of Leonidas, behind their fortifications, was scarcely injured.",
        "20. On the third morning a renegade Greek showed Xerxes a path across\nthe mountains where he could completely turn the Greek position. The\nPersians were not slow to avail themselves of this intelligence, and\ntoward the close of the third day Leonidas saw the enemy descending\nthe mountain, ready to surround him and cut off his retreat. Acting\npromptly, he ordered his allies to leave the field before it was too\nlate, but he, with his devoted band of three hundred, were to remain,\nin accordance of a Spartan law which forbade a Spartan soldier ever to\nretreat from the presence of an enemy. The seven hundred Thespians\nremained with him, and the whole band was cut down, but not without\ninflicting fearful loss upon the enemy.",
        "21. While the passage of Thermopylæ was disputed, he Greek fleet\nadvanced and took position in the strait of Artemisium, to prevent the\nPersian fleet from advancing farther into Greek waters. During the\nbattle the fleets were also engaged in an indecisive conflict. A\nstorm, however, arose and destroyed two hundred of the Persian ships.\nWhen Thermopylæ fell there was no longer reason for defending\nArtemisium, and the Greek fleet returned to defend the approach to\nAthens at the strait of Salamis.",
        "22. Athens was now at the mercy of the conqueror. The Spartan army\nmoved off to defend their own city. It was now that the wisdom of\nThemistocles showed itself. “The Athenians had no hope of being able\nto defend Athens, and resolved to abandon the town, and to remove\ntheir wives and children out of Attica to a place of safety. The whole\npopulation, men, women, and children, sorrowfully left their homes,\nand streamed down to the sea-shore, carrying what they could with\nthem.” The fleet took them over to Salamis and adjacent islands; and\nwhen Xerxes reached Athens he found it silent and deserted. A few poor\nor desperate men alone refused to depart, and had posted themselves\nbehind a wooden fortification on the top of the Acropolis, the\nfortress and sanctuary of Athens. The Persians fired the\nfortifications, stormed the Acropolis, slaughtered its defenders, and\nburned every holy place to the ground. Athens and its citadel were in\nthe hands of the barbarians; its inhabitants were scattered, its holy\nplaces destroyed. One hope alone remained to the Athenians–the ships\nwhich Themistocles had persuaded them to build.",
        "23. The fleet was anchored in the strait of Salamis, and beside the\ntwo hundred ships of Athens, it consisted of a large number from other\nports of Greece. Among the Greeks there were divided counsels; some\nwere for giving immediate battle, and some were for flying from the\nthousand Persian ships now advancing upon them. Themistocles saw that\nto retreat would be ruin, and he by stratagem kept every ship in its\nplace. He sent secret word to the Persians that the Greek fleet would\nsoon be in full retreat, and the Persian admiral sent two hundred\nvessels to blockade the farther extremity of the strait, so that\nflight was impossible.",
        "24. When everything was in readiness, Xerxes, from a throne built for\nhim on the shore so that he might be a spectator of the fight, gave\nthe signal to advance. At once all the long banks of oars in the\nthousand ships flashed in the light and dipped in the water. But here,\nas at Marathon, the way was narrow, and there was no chance for the\ndisplay of the full power of the Persian fleet. In a hand-to-hand\nconflict they stood no chance with the Greeks, and Xerxes, with\ndespair in his heart, saw two hundred of his best ships sunk or\ncaptured and many more seriously disabled, while the Greeks had\nsuffered little loss.",
        "25. Themistocles remained all night at his anchorage, ready to renew\nthe conflict on the morrow, but Xerxes, fearful for the fate of his\nbridge across the Hellespont, ordered the eight hundred remaining\nships to sail for its protection, while he and his whole army marched\nas rapidly as possible for the same point. The number assembled to\npass back into Asia was greatly diminished from the hosts which a few\nmonths before had so proudly marched to assured victory. Besides those\nlost in battle, thousands had perished through disease and famine. But\nthe hope of final success was not entirely abandoned, and the Persian\ngeneral, Mardonius, with three hundred thousand of the best soldiers\nof the invading army, were left to complete the conquest.",
        "26. With the retreat of Xerxes, the Athenians returned to their city,\nfinding their temples destroyed, and their homes desolated, but they\nimmediately commenced the work of rebuilding, and, amid rejoicings and\nrenewed hopes, the city arose from its ashes. The clash of arms gave\nplace to the din of industry, and the fighting soldier was replaced by\nthe peaceable citizen.",
        "27. In the mean time, Mardonius went into winter quarters in the\nnorthern provinces, and during the winter he endeavored to effect by\nnegotiation and bribery what he had failed to accomplish by arms. He\nsucceeded in exciting the jealousy of several of the cities toward\neach other, so that it was difficult to bring about concert of action,\nand he succeeded in detaching Thebes entirely from the confederacy,\nand arraying it against Athens. The Theban force which joined his army\nbecame one of the most formidable foes which the allied Greek had to\nmeet.",
        "28. The negotiations continued through the spring, but as summer\napproached the army of Mardonius was on the move. Sparta was not ready\nto meet the invader, and the Athenians once more took refuge on their\nships, ten months after their return. Mardonius took possession of the\ncity, and this time effectually destroyed it; but as nothing was to be\ngained by a further stay, he marched his army to Thebes, which became\nhis headquarters. The Spartans were at length ready to march. They saw\ntheir city menaced, and their own safety demanded that the forces of\nMardonius should be broken.",
        "29. With the aid of their allies they put into the field an army, the\nlargest that the Greeks ever mustered, variously reported as numbering\none hundred thousand to one hundred and ten thousand men. These were\nunder the command of the Spartan king, Pausanias. In September they\nset out for Thebes, and in a few days came up to the Persian army,\nwhich was stationed at Plataea, a short distance from Thebes. Here\nMardonius had established a fortified camp to which he might retreat\nif defeated on the field. For eleven days the two armies confronted\neach other, neither anxious to strike the first blow. Then the supply\nof water for the Greek camp gave out, and Pausanias fell back to a\nbetter position.",
        "30. This movement threw the Greek army into disorder, and the three\nmain divisions became separated from one another. Perceiving this the\nnext morning, Mardonius hastened with his Persians toward the higher\nground, where the Spartan troops might be seen winding along under the\nhillside, for from the river-banks he could not catch sight of the\nAthenians, who were hidden among the low hills which rose from the\nlevel plain.",
        "31. The last momentous strife had now begun. It was the custom of the\nSpartans before beginning a battle to offer sacrifice, and to wait for\nan omen or sign from heaven on the offering. Even now, when the\nPersians had advanced to within bow-shot and were pouring flights of\narrows upon the Spartans, Pausanias offered sacrifice. But the omens\nwere bad, and forbade any action except in self-defence. The Spartans\nknelt behind their shields, but the arrows pierced them, and the\nbravest men died sorrowfully, lamenting not for death, but because\nthey died without striking a blow for Sparta. In his distress\nPausanias called upon the goddess Hera, and the omens suddenly became\nfavorable, and the Spartans with their Tegean allies threw themselves\nupon the enemy.",
        "32. But the disparity of forces rendered the attack desperate.\nFifty-three thousand Greeks in all were opposed to the overwhelming\nnumbers of Mardonius. The Athenians were engaged elsewhere and could\nafford no assistance. The Persians had made a palisade of their wicker\nshields, behind which they could securely and effectually use their\nbows and arrows. By the first fierce onset of the Greeks this palisade\nwent down, but the Asiatics, laying aside their bows, fought\ndesperately with javelins and daggers. But they had no metal armor to\ndefend them; and the Spartans, with their lances fixed and their\nshields touching each other, bore down everything before them.",
        "33. The Persians fought with almost Hellenic heroism. Coming to close\nquarters, they seized the spears of their enemies and broke off their\nheads. Rushing forward singly or in small groups, they were borne down\nin the crush and killed; still they were not dismayed; and the battle\nraged more fiercely on the spot where Mardonius, on his white horse,\nfought with the flower of his troops. At length Mardonius was slain,\nand when his chosen guards had fallen around him, the remainder of the\nPersians made their way to their fortified camp, and took refuge\nbehind its wooden walls.",
        "34. In the mean time the Athenian army had been confronted by the\nPersian-Theban allies. Here it was not a conflict between disciplined\nvalor and barbaric hordes, but between Greek and Greek. The battle was\nlong and bloody, but in the end the defenders of Greek liberty were\nvictorious over those who would destroy it. The Theban force was not\nonly defeated but annihilated, and then the Athenians hastened to the\nsupport of Pansanias. While the Spartans were the best-drilled\nsoldiery in Greece for the field, they had little skill in siege\noperations, and the wooden walls of the Persian camp opposed to them\nan effective barrier.",
        "35. While the Spartan force was engaged in abortive attempts, the\nAthenians and their allies came up fresh from their victory over the\nThebans. Headed by the Tegeans, they burst like a deluge into the\nencampment, and the Persians, losing all heart, sought wildly to hide\nthemselves like deer flying from lions. Then followed a carnage so\nfearful that out of two hundred and sixty thousand men not three\nthousand, it is said, remained alive.",
        "36. Thus ended this formidable invasion, which threatened the very\nexistence of Greece. The great wave of Oriental despotism had spent\nits force without submerging freedom. Thenceforth the wonderful Greek\nenergy and creative power might be turned away from matters military\nand expended upon the arts of peace.",
        "37. The Athenians returned to their city and found everything in\nruins. Fire and hate had destroyed home and temple alike. All the\naccumulated wealth of generations was gone. Nothing was left but the\nindomitable energy which had been tested on so many trying\nemergencies, and the wonderful skill of eye and hand which came of\ninherited aptitude and long personal experience. Upon the old site a\nnew city grew in a single generation, marvelous in its splendor of\ntemple and palace, so light and airy, yet so strong and enduring, that\nafter the lapse of twenty-five centuries the marble skeletons, though\nin ruins, stand, the admiration of all men and of all ages.",
        "1. After the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus, in the year 70 of the\nChristian era, Palestine continued for upward of two centuries in the\ncondition of a Roman province, inhabited by a mixed population of\npagans, Jews, and Christians. In Jerusalem, temples of Venus and\nJupiter were erected on the most sacred spots of Christian history;\nand heathenism triumphed in the possession of the Holy City of two\nreligions. On the establishment of Christianity in the Roman Empire by\nConstantine, in the year 321, this state of things was changed;\nPalestine and Jerusalem became objects of interest to all Christians,\nand crowds of pilgrims visited the localities celebrated by the\nevangelists. Splendid churches were erected on the ruins of pagan\ntemples, and every spot pointed out as the scene of the memorable\nevents in the life of Christ and his apostles was marked by a chapel\nor house of prayer. Jerusalem and the Holy Land became the resort of\nnumerous bodies of clergy, who resided in the churches and monasteries\nwhich the piety of the wealthy had founded for them.",
        "2. At the end of the fourth century, the gigantic Roman Empire was\nbroken up into two, the Eastern, the capital of which was\nConstantinople, and the Western, the capital of which was Rome. It was\nto the former of these that Syria and Palestine were attached. Before\nthe end of the fifth century the Western Empire had been destroyed by\nthe eruption of the German races, and the beginnings of a new European\ncivilization were rising from its ruins. Meanwhile, the Eastern\nremained entire, till about the year 630, when the Arabs, burning with\nthe spirit of conquest infused into them by the religion of Mohammed,\npoured into its provinces. Egypt, Syria, and Palestine were annexed as\ndependencies to the great Arabic Empire of the caliphs. The religion\nof Mohammed became dominant in the Holy Land, the temples and chapels\nwere converted into mosques.",
        "3. Numbers of pilgrims still continued each year to visit Palestine.\nIn return for a certain tribute, the earlier caliphs permitted the\nChristians of Jerusalem to have a patriarch, and to carry on their own\nform of worship. Of all the caliphs, the celebrated Haroun al-Rashid,\nbest known to us in the stories of the “Arabian Nights,” was the most\ntolerant, and under him the Christians enjoyed perfect peace.",
        "4. Great cruelties were practised by the Fatimite caliphs, who\nconquered Syria about the year 980. The pilgrims were robbed, beaten,\nand sometimes slain on their journey, the Christian residents\noppressed by heavy impositions, and their feelings outraged by insults\nagainst their religion. These sufferings were slight, however,\ncompared with those which they endured after the invasion and conquest\nof Palestine by the Turkish hordes in 1065. But recently converted to\nMoslemism, and therefore more rude and fanatical than the other\nMohammedans, these Turks wreaked their vengeance on all\nalike–Christians, Jews, and even the native Mohammedans.",
        "5. The news of the atrocities perpetrated by the Turks produced a deep\nsensation over the whole of Christendom, as well among the Latin\nChristians as among the Greek Christians, the name given to the\npopulation of what remained of the old Byzantine Empire. The latter\nhad reason to dread that, if the Turks were not checked,\nConstantinople, their capital, would soon share the same fate as\nJerusalem. Accordingly, about the year 1073, the Greek Emperor, Manuel\nVII, sent to supplicate the assistance of the great Pope Gregory VII\nagainst the Turks. Till now there had prevailed a spirit of antagonism\nbetween the Greek and Latin churches, the former refusing to yield\nobedience to the pope of the West as the universal head of the Church.\nGregory, therefore, eagerly received the application of the Greek\nEmperor, seeing the promise of the final subjection of the Greek to\nthe Latin Church. He resolved to give the enterprise his countenance,\nand to march himself at the head of an army to rescue the Holy\nSepulchre.",
        "6. Gregory was prevented from ever carrying out his design, and the\nidea of a crusade gradually died away. Meanwhile, the Turks extended\ntheir victories at the expense of the Greek Empire. Before the\naccession of the celebrated Alexius Comnenus to the throne in 1081,\nthe whole of Asia Minor was in the possession of the Turks, and broken\nup into a number of kingdoms, the sultans of which soon began to\nquarrel among themselves. The disturbed state of Asia Minor greatly\nincreased the sufferings of the pilgrims; not one out of three\nreturned to recount the story of his hardships.",
        "7. Among those who undertook the pilgrimage to Jerusalem, when the\ndangers attending it were the greatest, was a native of Amiens in\nFrance, named Peter, who had become a monk and an ascetic, being\ncalled from his solitary manner of life, Peter the Hermit. He arrived\nsafely at Jerusalem, and visited all the scenes sacred to a\nChristian’s eyes. As he walked along the streets, looking at this and\nthat holy spot, insolent and contemptuous Turks looked on and mocked\nhim, and his spirit grew bitter within him, and his hand clutched\nitself convulsively as if longing for a sword.",
        "8. Burning with a sense of injuries sustained by the Christians, and\nthe desecration of the sacred places, he sought the counsel of Simeon,\nthe Greek patriarch of Jerusalem. In reply to Peter’s questions, he\nexplained that nothing was to be expected from the Greek Empire in\nbehalf of the Holy Land, the court of Constantinople was so dissolute\nand corrupt, and that the only hope was that the Latin princes might\nbe persuaded to form a league for the grand purpose entertained by\nGregory VII. “Write,” Peter said to the patriarch, “to the pope and to\nall Latin Christians, and seal your letters with the signet of your\noffice as patriarch of Jerusalem. As a penance for my sins, I will\ntravel over Europe, I will describe everywhere the desolate condition\nof the Holy City, and exhort princes and people to wrest it from the\nprofane hands of the infidels.”",
        "9. The letters were accordingly written, and the hermit set sail with\nthem from Joppa. Arriving in Italy he presented the documents to the\npope, Urban II, a pupil and protégé of Gregory VII, urging his\nholiness to use his authority, as the head of Christendom, to set in\nmotion a scheme for regaining the birthplace of Christ. Enthusiasm is\ncontagious, and the pope appears to have caught it instantly from one\nwhose zeal was so unbounded. Giving the Hermit full powers, he sent\nhim abroad to preach the holy war. Peter departed, going from town to\ntown, and from village to village, and, in the language of the\nchroniclers, “traversing the whole of Europe in less than a year’s\ntime.” His strange and wild aspect, his glittering eye, his shrill\nand unearthly eloquence, the grandeur of his theme, his pathetic\ndescriptions of Jerusalem and the Christians there, produced\neverywhere the most extraordinary sensations. “He set out,” says a\ncontemporary historian, “from whence I know not, nor with what\npurpose; but we saw him passing through the towns and villages,\neverywhere preaching, and the people flocking round him, loading him\nwith gifts, and praising his sanctity with such eulogiums, that I\nnever remember having seen so great honors paid to any other man. The\npeople reverenced him so that they plucked the hairs from the mane of\nhis mule, and kept them afterward as relics. Out of doors he generally\nwore a woolen tunic, with a brown mantle, which descended to his\nheels. His arms and feet were bare, he ate little or no bread, but\nlived on fish and wine.”",
        "10. Such being the success of the Hermit’s mission, the pope showed\nhis approbation of the project by summoning in the year 1095 two\ncouncils. The first of these was held at Placentia in March;\nambassadors from the Greek Emperor appeared to petition for aid\nagainst the Turks, and the members of the council were unanimous in\ntheir support of the crusade. The second, the famous Council of\nClermont, was held at the town of that name in Auvergne in the month\nof November. It was in the midst of an extremely cold winter, and the\nground was covered with snow. During seven days the council sat with\nclosed doors, while immense crowds from all parts of France flocked\ninto the town, in the expectation that the pope himself would address\nthe people.",
        "11. All the neighborhood presented the appearance of a vast camp.\nIssuing from the church in his full canonicals, surrounded by his\ncardinals and bishops in all the splendor of ecclesiastical costume,\nthe pope stood before the populace on a high scaffolding, erected for\nthe occasion, and covered with scarlet cloth. A brilliant array of\nbishops and cardinals surrounded him, and among them, humbler in rank\nbut more important in the world’s eye, the Hermit Peter, dressed in\nhis simple woolen gown. The pope’s eloquent words touched every heart.\nHe was interrupted by the united voice of the people shouting “God\nwills it! God wills it!” Hushing the joyous tumult with a wave of his\nhand, the pontiff continued “Be they then your war-cry in the combat,\nfor those words came from God. Let the army of the Lord, when it\nrushes upon its enemies, shout but that one cry, ’God wills it! God\nwills it!’ Let whoever is inclined to devote himself to this holy\ncause wear on his breast or back the sign of the holy cross.” From\nthis time the red cross was the sacred emblem of the crusaders.",
        "12. Following the Council of Clermont, preparations for invading the\nHoly Land began in almost every country of Europe. The clanging of the\nsmith’s hammer, making or repairing armor, was heard in every village.\nAll who had property of any description rushed to the mart to change\nit for hard cash. The nobles mortgaged their estates, the farmer\nendeavored to sell his plow, and the artisan his tools to purchase a\nsword for the deliverance of Jerusalem. Women disposed of their\ntrinkets for the same purpose. During the spring and summer of 1096\nthe roads teemed with crusaders, all hastening to the towns and\nvillages appointed as the rendevous of the district. Very few knew\nwhere Jerusalem was. Some thought it fifty thousand miles away, and\nothers imagined it but a month’s journey; while at the sight of every\ntower or castle the children exclaimed “Is that Jerusalem?” Little\nattempt at any organization was made, though the multitude had three\nleaders. It is said that the first band, consisting of twenty thousand\nfoot, with only eight horsemen, were led by a Burgundian gentleman,\ncalled Walter the Penniless. They were followed by a rabble of forty\nthousand men, women, and children, led by Peter the Hermit, a medley\nof all nations and languages. Next followed a band of fifteen thousand\nmen, mostly Germans, under a priest named Gottschalk. These three\nmultitudes led the way in the crusades, pursuing the same route, that,\nnamely, which leads through Hungary and Bulgaria toward Asia Minor.",
        "13. Like their nominal leader, each of the followers of Walter the\nPenniless was poor to penury, and trusted for subsistence to the\nchances of the road. In Hungary they met with loud resistance from the\npeople, whose houses they attacked and plundered, but in Bulgaria the\nnatives declared war against the hungry horde; they were dispersed and\nalmost exterminated. Some of the survivors retraced their steps; the\nrest, among whom was Walter, reached Constantinople, where they\nawaited the arrival of Peter and his companions. The Hermit, who had\nthe same difficulties to contend with in marching through Hungary and\nBulgaria, reached Constantinople with his army greatly reduced, and in\na most deplorable condition. Here he and Walter joined forces, the\nHermit assuming the superior command. They were hospitably received by\nthe emperor, but their riotous conduct soon wearied out his patience,\nand he was glad to listen to a proposal of the Hermit to furnish them\nwith the means of passing at once into Asia. The rabble accordingly\ncrossed the Bosphorus, and took up their quarters in Bethynia. Here\nthey became perfectly ungovernable, ravaging the country around, and\ncommitting incredible excesses; at length Peter, utterly disgusted and\ndespairing, left them to their own guidance and returned to\nConstantinople. The bravest of them were annihilated in a battle\nfought near Nice, Walter the Penniless falling with seven mortal\nwounds. Between two and three thousand alone escaped, brought back to\nConstantinople by the troops of Alexius, who rescued them from the\nTurks. The emperor dismissed them, with orders to return home, and\nthus ended the disastrous expedition of Walter the Penniless and Peter\nthe Hermit.",
        "14. The fifteen thousand Germans led by Gottschalk never reached\nConstantinople, being slaughtered or dispersed during their passage\nthrough Hungary. Hungary was also fatal to another army of crusaders,\nthe fourth in order, but greatly exceeding in numbers the other three\nput together. This terrible horde, consisting of about two hundred\nthousand, swept through Germany committing horrible outrages,\nespecially against the Jews, whom they murdered without mercy. They\nwere preceded by a goose and a goat, to which they attributed divine\npowers. As the rabble advanced, the Hungarians gave themselves up for\nlost, the king and nobles were preparing to flee, when the mass fell\nasunder of its own accord. Many were slain by the enraged Hungarians.\nSome escaped to the north, a few ultimately joined the succeeding\nbands of crusaders, but the majority perished. Thus, within a few\nmonths, upward of a quarter of a million of human beings were swept\nout of existence. And they had spent their lives, without one\nimportant result having been accomplished, without one glorious feat\nhaving been achieved.",
        "15. This was the worst paroxysm of the madness of Europe, and this\npassed, her chivalry stepped upon the scene. Men of cool heads, mature\nplans, and invincible courage stood forward, to lead and direct not\nmore fanatical masses, but the gentry, yeomanry, and serfs of feudal\nEurope. These were the true crusaders. Altogether they formed six\narmies, marching separately, and at considerable intervals of time.\nFirst carne the army of Godfrey of Bouillon, Duke of Lorraine, the\npride of his age for all noble and knightly virtues, immortalized by\nthe poet Tasso. He had risen from a sick-bed to join the crusade, and\nsold his lordship to raise the necessary money; around his standard\nassembled many of the best knights of the age. In the month of August,\n1096, they commenced their march, through Hungary and Bulgaria.",
        "16. Four other chiefs of the royal blood of Europe also assumed the\ncross, and led each his army to the Holy Land; Hugh, Count of\nVermandois, brother of the king of France; Robert, Duke of Normandy,\nthe elder brother of William Rufus; Robert, Count of Flanders, and\nBohemond, Prince of Tarentum, eldest son of the celebrated Robert\nGuiscard. With Bohemond, and second in command in the army, came\nTancred, the favorite hero of all the historians of the crusade, so\nyoung, so valiant, so enthusiastic. There was not among them all, says\nTasso, a greater warrior, nor any one of more courteous behavior, of\nfairer countenance, or of loftier and more intrepid heart. The last\narmy was led by the haughty and resolute Count Raimond of Toulouse.",
        "17. To detail the progress of the various armies is unnecessary.\nUpward of six hundred thousand warriors of the West, beside a\nmultitude of priests, women, and children, were at last actually\nencamped on Asiatic soil. It was literally a moving nation, in which\nall languages were spoken, all costumes worn. There was the\nfair-haired son of the north, with broad, open forehead, mild blue\neyes, sanguine complexion, and large frame; there the dark visaged\nsouthron, with his flashing glance and fiery soul; there was the\nknight in his armor, the priest in his robes, the foot-soldier in his\ntough jerkin, the unkempt serf with his belt of rope. There were\npawing horses, swearing grooms, carts full of provisions, sacks,\ngroups of gossiping women, crowds of merry children. Under the bright\nsun of Asia, all was gaudy and brilliant. Spearpoints glittered,\nbreast-plates and helmets gleamed, thousands of targets displayed\ntheir painted glories, pennons of blue, purple, and white streamed\nfrom every tent, while heavier flags flapped their sullen folds; and\neverywhere, on shield, flag, helmet, tunic, and coat of mail, was seen\nblazoned the holy sign of the red cross. Walking through all these,\nheedless of the looks cast upon him, and hearing not the oft-repeated\nbugle-blasts from all parts of the camp, might be seen a man of small\nstature, thin and poorly clad, with down-cast face, wild, unsettled\neye, and timid, nervous gait. It was the man who had created it\nall–Peter the Hermit. He had crossed from Constantinople with Godfrey\nof Bouillon. His revenge was near! On, on, then, to the Holy City!",
        "18. Alas, the Holy City was yet far distant! Not much more than half\ntheir journey in point of space had been accomplished, and in point of\ndifficulty and peril their march had little more than begun, for they\nhad just entered the countries of the infidels. Months had to roll on,\nand many battles to be fought, ere the pinnacles of the Holy City\nshould greet their longing eyes.",
        "19. The route of the crusading armies lay in a southeasterly\ndirection, through Asia Minor, and then southward to Jerusalem, along\nthe shores of the Levant. Their march along this route, counting from\nthe time of their crossing into Asia Minor, May, 1097, to the time\nwhen they came in sight of Jerusalem and laid siege to it, June, 1099,\noccupied upward of two years. Countless were the dangers to which the\ncrusaders were subject in this trial. Of the many sieges two are\nespecially memorable, that of Nice and that of Antioch.",
        "20. The siege of Nice was the first exploit in which the crusading\narmies were engaged. During these six weeks the slaughter of the\nChristians, by the arrows of the Turkish garrison, and by the bolts\nand large stones which they discharged from mangonels and catapults,\nwas immense. The city surrendered at last, not, however, to the Latin\nchiefs, but to an envoy of the Greek Emperor Alexius, who contrived to\nenter into communication with the besieged and induced them to\ncapitulate. Angry and dissatisfied, the crusaders left their\nencampment and resumed their march, not in one mass, but in several\nbodies. At length the scattered armies reunited for the siege of\nAntioch toward the end of October, 1097. All the known means of attack\nwere put in operation; movable towers were constructed from which to\ndischarge missiles into the city. The walls were battered, and the\nsallies of the besieged bravely met, still without any effective\nresult. At the end of ten days famine stared them in the face, so\nextravagant were they in the use of their stores. Pestilence joined\nits ravages, and instead of the brave army of chivalry which had sat\ndown before Antioch, was to be seen a crowd of gaunt and famishing\ncreatures, with scarcely a thought but that of procuring food.\nMultitudes died, desertions became numerous.",
        "21. The chiefs began to weary of the expedition, and, most disgraceful\nof all, Peter the Hermit turned his back on the enterprise, and had\nactually fled several miles on his way home, when he was brought back\nby the soldiers of Tancred and forced to undergo a public reprimand.\nAt length, after infinite sufferings on the part of the Christians,\nAntioch was taken on the 3d of June, 1098, by means of the treachery\nof an Armenian captain, whom the Turks had intrusted with the command\nof one of the towers, and who admitted a number of the crusaders\nduring a dark and stormy night.",
        "22. Imagination can not conceive a scene more dreadful than that\npresented by the devoted city of Antioch on that night of horror. The\ncrusaders fought with a blind fury which fanaticism and suffering\nalike incited. No quarter was shown. At daylight the massacre ceased,\nand the crusaders gave themselves up to plunder. They found gold,\njewels, and rich fabrics in abundance, but of provisions little of any\nkind. Suddenly they were roused from their sloth and pleasure by the\nappearance before Antioch of an immense army, which the Persian caliph\nhad dispatched to sweep the Christian locusts from the face of the\nearth. Great was the alarm of the Christians when they saw this\nsplendid host of more than two hundred thousand men encamped around\nthe hills of Antioch. The corn and wine found in the city were soon\nexhausted; all the horrors of a second famine began.",
        "23. Many deserted and escaped over the walls, carrying the news of the\nsad condition of the Christians back toward Europe. The worst\nconsequence of these desertions was, that the Greek Emperor Alexius,\nwho, hearing of the successes of the Latins, was on his march to\nassist the crusaders, was deterred from advancing, and returned to\nConstantinople. With increasing famine came a pestilence, so that in a\nshort time but sixty thousand remained of the three hundred thousand\nthat had invested Antioch. But this bitter extremity knit the leaders\nmore firmly together, and Bohemond, Godfrey, and Tancred swore never\nto desert the cause while life lasted.",
        "24. It is said that belief in the remarkable fulfillment of a dream\nbrought hope once more to the disheartened crusaders. Peter Barthelmy,\na priest of Provence, dreamed, he said, that Saint Andrew appeared to\nhim in the night, and informed him that underneath a certain spot in\nthe floor of the church of Saint Peter was buried the identical lance\nwith which the Roman soldiers pierced the side of Christ as he hung on\nthe cross. This relic, said the apparition, was to be the guarantee of\nGod’s presence and their guide to victory. Twelve persons were chosen\nto conduct the search. A whole day was spent in vain, the workmen were\ntired out, and still no lance was found. At last Peter descended into\nthe pit and began to dig the loose earth. Suddenly a cry of joy was\nheard, and stretching himself to his full height, Peter handed up into\nthe eager fingers of those above an actual rusty lance-head. In an\ninstant it was noised abroad that the holy relic had been found. What\nremained now but to issue forth and discomfit the infidel host.",
        "25. The infidel host was discomfited. On the 28th of June, 1098, two\nhundred thousand Turks, in the full flush of health and strength, were\nrouted, outside the walls of Antioch, by a half-famished Christian\narmy. Antioch was bestowed upon Bohemond, and it was resolved that the\narmy should remain there to recruit before advancing toward Jerusalem.\nThe tragical fate of Peter Barthelmy must be mentioned. Many of the\ncrusaders had begun to question the genuineness of the relic he had\nfound. He was prevailed upon to submit to the ordeal of fire, and\nperished in the flames. From that moment the story of the relic lost\ncredit.",
        "26. It was on a lovely morning in the summer of 1099 that the forty\nthousand crusaders, who were all that remained of the vast army which\nhad two years ago laid seige to Nice, were recompensed for all their\ntoils by a sight of the Holy City, bathed in the splendor of eastern\nsunshine. The name “Jerusalem” escaped from every lip; some leaped and\nshouted, some kneeled and prayed, some wept, some threw themselves\nprostrate and kissed the earth, some gazed and trembled. “All had much\nado,” says the quaint Fuller, “to manage so much gladness.”",
        "27. Preparations for a siege were soon under way. The besiegers, who\nhad gained skill by their former attempts, employed all the methods of\nattack that experience could suggest or courage execute, while the\ngarrison of forty thousand Turks, who maintained the city for their\nmaster, the caliph of Egypt, resisted with determined obstinacy. At\nlength, after a confession of sins by the whole army, and a\npenitential procession around the walls, a simultaneous attack was\nmade with battering-rains, mangonels, and all manner of besieging\nengines. At one quarter a huge wooden tower was wheeled close to the\nwalls, a movable bridge was let down, and, bounding across it, a\nsoldier named Lutold was the first man to stand upon the battlements.\nGodfrey of Bouillon and a number of knights sprang after him, and the\nChristians were within Jerusalem. Meanwhile, at another part of the\nwall, Tancred and Robert of Normandy had shattered open a gate, and\nrushed in with their men; while at a third part of the city, Raimond\nof Toulouse effected an entrance for himself and his followers by the\nhelp of scaling-ladders. In an instant after, the banner of the cross\nfloated upon the walls of Jerusalem. The crusaders, raising once more\ntheir redoubtable war-cry, rushed on from every side, and the city was\ntaken. The battle raged for several hours, and the Christians gave no\nquarter. Peter the Hermit, who had remained so long under the veil of\nneglect, was repaid that day for all his zeal and all his suffering.\nHe was once more the idol of the army, but history is silent\nconcerning the remainder of his life.",
        "28. Eight days after the capture of the city, the Latin chiefs\nunanimously elected Godfrey of Bouillon king of Jerusalem. A new\nChristian state was thus founded in Syria, consisting at first of\nlittle more than the mere city of Jerusalem, but extending by\nsubsequent battles and conquests until it included the whole of\nPalestine. A language resembling Norman-French was established in this\nkingdom, and a code of feudal laws drawn up for its government. The\nclergy also obtained their share of the conquest, Jerusalem was\ncreated into a patriarchate, and Bethlehem into a bishopric. The\nfoundation of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem in July, 1099, was the\nconsummation of the first crusade.",
        "29. A period of fifty years succeeded, during which time many battles\nwere fought with the Saracens of Syria and Egypt, the result of which\nwas to strengthen the Latin state. No fewer than five hundred thousand\npersons set out from Europe for Syria, incited by the news of the\nsuccess of the first crusade. The three centers from which the\nChristian power sought to spread itself through the Mussulman\npossessions were Jerusalem, Antioch, and Edessa.",
        "30. The very spirit of the crusade seemed to have died out. The Latin\nKingdom of Jerusalem had become, like any other kingdom of the period,\na country in which men built houses, plowed land, made bargains, gave\nfeasts, etc., drank, laughed, talked, quarreled, and went to law. The\nfall of Edessa, the first conspicuous success of the Turks, came like\na surprise upon the Latin population of Syria. An attempt was made by\nthe Christians to recover the city, but it failed, and the frontier of\nSyria was open to invasion from the East.",
        "31. The fall of Edessa, and the petitions of the people of Palestine\nfor aid, produced a sensation throughout Europe, and especially in\nFrance. Nor was an apostle wanting worthy to fill the place of Peter,\nand to summon the chivalry of Europe to a second crusade. Commissioned\nby Pope Eugenius for that purpose, the famous Saint Bernard, Abbot of\nClairvaux in Champagne, traveled through France and Germany, exerting\nthe power of his marvelous eloquence in recruiting the armies of the\ncross. The chiefs of the second crusade were two of the most powerful\nprinces of Europe, Louis VII, King of France, and Conrad III, Emperor\nof Germany. Under their command upward of one million two hundred\nthousand men, collected from all parts of Europe, marched toward\nPalestine in two great armies, early in 1147.",
        "32. Notwithstanding the vastness of the preparations, the expedition\nwas a total failure. The events of the last fifty years had rendered\nthe policy of the Greek princes hostile to the crusades. Manuel\nComnenus, the grandson of Alexius, who now occupied the throne,\nsuffered both armies to pass into Asia Minor, where, misled by Greek\nscouts, the army of Conrad was all but destroyed by the Turks, near\nIconium, while the army of Louis, after undergoing infinite hardships,\nwas wrecked in the defiles of the Pisidian mountains. The fragments of\nthe two armies uniting made their way to Syria, where they co-operated\nwith forces of the princes of Jerusalem and Antioch, in laying seige\nto Damascus, but without effect. In 1149 Conrad and Louis returned to\nEurope, and the second crusade was at an end, having attained nothing\nbut the expenditure of more than a million of lives.",
        "33. A period of forty years elapsed before Europe fitted out another\ncrusade. Meanwhile the struggle between the Christian and the Turks in\nSyria was carried on without intermission. Noureddin, the son of the\nconqueror of Edessa, displayed a genius which astonished both\nChristians and Turks. Keeping possession of Edessa, he aimed at\nextending his conquest at the expense of the Christians still further.\nFor some time he was kept in check by the abilities of Baldwin III,\nKing of Jerusalem. On his death, in 1162, his brother Amalric, far\ninferior to Baldwin in ability, succeeded to the throne.",
        "34. At this crisis, while Noureddin, the Sultan of Aleppo, and\nAmalric, the Christian King of Jerusalem, were the rival powers in\nSyria, occurred a circumstance which exercised considerable influence\non the subsequent course of events, and which makes necessary a\nretrospective glance.",
        "35. At the time of the first crusade Palestine was the scene of a\nviolent contest between the Turks, who had poured down from the North,\nconquering as they went, and the Fatimites of Egypt, who had possessed\nSyria for nearly a century. The Turks had at first been irresistible.\nThe Fatimites, however, had been able to recover Jerusalem from the\nhands of their enemies, and held it when besieged by the Christians.\nInterrupted in their conflict with each other for the sovereignty of\nPalestine, the Fatimites and Turks turned their arms with one accord\nagainst the invader. In the person of Noureddin the Turkish power was\nnow increasing. The Fatimite dynasty of Egypt, meanwhile, had long\nbeen showing signs of decay, the caliphs having become mere tools in\nthe hands of their viziers. In 1163 one of these viziers, Shawer,\nfinding himself expelled from his post by a rival, sought refuge at\nthe court of Aleppo, and applied to the sultan for assistance.\nNoureddin eagerly embraced an opportunity for obtaining a footing in\nEgypt, and sent two persons, Chyrkouh and his nephew Saladin, to\ndisplace the usurping vizier and re-establish Shawer. They, however,\nusurped the government, and Shawer applied to the King of Jerusalem,\nAmalric, for assistance. Amalric in turn attempted usurpation, and\nagain the officers of Noureddin came to the aid of Shawer. The vizier\npaid the penalty of his fickleness by losing his head, and his post\nwas occupied by Chyrkouh, who, while ruling Egypt as a vizier of the\nFatimite caliph, was in reality the lieutenant of Noureddin.",
        "36. On the death of Chyrkouh, Saladin was appointed to the viziership.\nThe caliph fancied that he would now regain the control of his own\ndominions, but he little knew the character of his new vizier. Saladin\nsoon effected a revolution in Egypt, declared the Fatimite dynasty to\nbe at an end, and subjected the country once more to the nominal\nauthority of the Bagdad caliphs, whom Noureddin professed to reverence\nas the supreme heads of the Mohammedan Empire. Nor did he stop here.\nHe soon showed a disposition to shake off the supremacy of Noureddin,\nand the sultan of Aleppo was marching into Egypt to vindicate his\nauthority, when he suddenly died in the year 1171.",
        "37. Saladin now saw the great obstacle to his ambition removed, and\nbegan to aim at realizing those schemes of sovereignty which Noureddin\nhad projected. The state of the Christian kingdom during the ten or\ntwelve years which followed directly favored his plans. Civil\ndissensions arose which the keen eye of Saladin discovered, and,\nalready master of all Syria, he resolved to complete his greatness by\nthe conquest of Palestine. Accordingly, when in the year 1157 it was\nknown that he was on his march against Jerusalem, the Christian\ncrusaders saw the necessity of abandoning their dissensions and\nuniting cordially against the invader. Town after town surrendered to\nthe victorious Saracen, and, in October, 1187, Jerusalem itself, after\nfourteen days’ defense, was obliged to submit to his mercy. The\nconduct of Saladin on this occasion was more generous than might have\nbeen expected. A moderate ransom was fixed for every individual, on\nthe payment of which he was at liberty to remove with his goods to\nwhatever place he chose. To the Christian ladies, Saladin’s conduct\nwas courteous in the extreme, so that it became a remark among the\nLatins of Palestine that Saladin was a barbarian only in name.",
        "38. Thus, after ninety years, was the Holy City again inhabited by the\ninfidel, and all the fruits of the first crusade lost, as it seemed to\nthe world. Saladin now possessed the whole of Palestine, with the\nsingle exception of the city of Tyre, which was gallantly defended by\nConrad, Marquis of Montferrat.",
        "39. The epidemic frenzy which had been gradually cooling was now\nextinct, or nearly so, and the nations of Europe looked with cold\nindifference upon the armaments of their princes. But chivalry was now\nin all its glory, and it continued to supply armies for the Holy Land.\nPoetry more than religion inspired the Third Crusade. The knights and\ntheir retainers listened with delight to the martial and amatory\nstrains of the ministrels, minnesingers, and troubadors. Men fought\nnot so much for the holy sepulchre as to gain glory for themselves in\nthe best and only field where glory could be obtained. They fought not\nas zealots, but as soldiers, not for religion, but for honor.",
        "40. The first to take the field was the illustrious German emperor,\nFrederick Barbarossa. Marching from Ratisbon at the bead of a\nmagnificent army in 1189, he fought his way through the Greek\ndominions, advanced through Asia Minor, conquering as he went, and was\nalready on the borders of Palestine, when, imprudently bathing, he was\ncut off in the seventieth year of his age. His army suffered greatly\nfrom the difficulties of their march and the attacks of the Saracens.\nThe wrecks of it under Frederick’s son, the Duke of Swabia, proved a\nmost valuable reinforcement to the Christians in Syria, who had by\nthis time rallied and combined against the domination of Saladin,\nlaying siege to the city of Acre on the sea-coast, a town of so much\nimportance that the possession of it was considered almost equivalent\nto being master of the whole country.",
        "41. Upon this siege, commenced in August, 1189, was concentrated all\nthe force at the command of the Christians in Palestine, the remnants\nof the two great military orders the Knights Templars and the Knights\nHospitallers, the survivors of Frederick’s army, together with such\nbodies of crusaders as were continually arriving from Europe by sea.\nGuy de Lusignan was the commander of the besieging forces, and so\nskillfully was his army fortified that Saladin was unable to dislodge\nhim. For two-and-twenty months the siege continued, and many\nengagements had taken place between the Christian army and that of\nSaladin, which occupied the mountains to the south, but without\nvisible advantage on either side.",
        "42. Such was the position of affairs when, early in the summer of\n1191, Philip, of France, and Richard Coeur de Lion, of England,\narrived with their fleets. The struggle was soon over, and on the 12th\nof July, 1191, Acre surrendered to the Christians. Had the crusaders\nbeen united among themselves, the fall of this city might have been\nbut preliminary to the recovery of the whole country. The rivalry of\nthe kings of France and England, however, prevented their cordial\nco-operation, and, not long after the capture of Acre, Philip ruined\nthe cause of the crusade by returning to Europe.",
        "43. After gaining many important successes against Saladin, and\nearning for himself the reputation of the most valiant knight of the\nage, Richard, involved in disputes with the other chiefs of the\ncrusade, and anxious to revisit England, where his presence was\nbecoming daily more necessary, was glad to conclude an honorable\npeace. Saladin, on his part, was equally willing to end a struggle\nwhich had cost him so much. A truce was concluded for three years and\neight months, during which Christian pilgrims were to enjoy the\nliberty of visiting Jerusalem without hindrance.",
        "44. Saladin entertained many Christians in his own palace, from which\nthey returned, their tongues laden with praises of the noble infidel.\nRichard and Saladin never met, but each admired the prowess and\nnobleness of soul of his rival.",
        "45. The Christians and Moslems no longer looked upon each other as\nbarbarians, to whom mercy was a crime. Each host entertained the\nhighest admiration for the bravery and magnanimity of the other, and\nin their occasional truces met upon the most friendly terms. When\nRichard, the lion-hearted king of England, lay in his tent consumed by\na fever, there came into the camp camels laden with snow, sent by his\nenemy, the Sultan Saladin, to assuage his disease, the homage of one\nbrave soldier to another. But, when Richard was returning to England,\nit was by a Christian prince that he was treacherously seized and\nsecretly confined.",
        "46. It was on the 25th of October, 1192, that Richard set sail for\nEurope. Forced by stress of weather to land at Zara, he made the\nattempt to journey through the continent, and was arrested and held a\nprisoner while passing through the dominions of his enemy and former\nfellow-crusader, the archduke of Austria, and remained in prison in\nVienna for several months. He returned to England in 1194, and died in\n1199. His great antagonist, Saladin, had died in 1193, not long after\nthe Christian armies left Palestine. At the end of the crusade, the\nCrescent waved as defiantly as ever over the land of Israel.",
        "47. The fourth crusade, from 1195 to 1198, led by Henry VI of Germany,\nwas equally a failure. There were gained some brilliant victories, but\ndissensions divided the armies, and at last a truce was made with the\nMohammedans. It is true that these victories made the crusaders\nmasters of the sea-coast, but, when the armies departed, the Christian\nking found himself in possession of cities which he was unable to\ngarrison, and which he felt would be held only by the sufferance of\nthe enemy.",
        "48. In the year 1203 a new crusade was set on foot, commanded by\nseveral of the most powerful nobles of Italy and France. Instead of\nmarching at once against the infidels, the crusaders suffered\nthemselves to be drawn into a contest with the Greek empire. Just at\nthis time the emperor of the Greeks had been deposed and deprived of\nhis eyes by his own brother. His son, Alexius, fled to Europe, and\npetitioned the assistance of the Latin princes against the usurper,\npromising in return to use his efforts to bring about a union of the\nGreek with the Latin church, and to employ all the resources of his\nkingdom against the infidels of Syria. The temptation of such a\nprospect could not be resisted; the crusaders marched into Greece,\nlaid siege to Constantinople, and took the city by storm A. D. 1204,\nthereby establishing Latin Christianity in the eastern metropolis, but\nat what a cost. Neither the works of God nor man were respected by the\ninvaders; they vented their brutal ferocity upon the one, and\nsatisfied their avarice upon the other. “In St. Sophia, the silver was\nstripped from the pulpit, an exquisite and highly-prized table of\noblation was broken in pieces, the sacred chalices were turned into\ndrinking-cups, the gold fringe was ripped off the veil of the\nsanctuary. Asses and horses were led into the churches to carry off\nthe spoil.",
        "49. “Many beautiful bronze pieces, above all price as works of art,\nwere broken into pieces to be sold as old metal. The finely chiseled\nmarble was also destroyed by the same spirit of vandalism. Two\nthousand people were put to the sword; had there been less plunder,\nthe slaughter would in all probability have been much greater.”",
        "50. For fifty years the empire was ruled over by the Franks. Meanwhile\nthe knights, plunged in the luxury of the city, heeded not the appeals\nfrom Palestine, but allowed the besieged and suffering, for whose\nrescue they had enlisted, to linger and die without an effort on their\nbehalf. Moved to desperation, in this emergency, the Christians sent\nto Europe a heart-rending cry for help.",
        "51. The urgent appeal from Palestine caused Pope Innocent III to\nearnestly preach a new crusade, and he crowned his labors and appeals\nwith his famous exclamation, “Sword, sword, start from thy scabbard,\nand sharpen thyself to kill.” Though the many disastrous and\nfruitless expeditions had so dampened the ardor of men that they gave\nlittle heed to his appeals, the zeal of the young was kindled for the\ncause to which their elders seemed so indifferent.",
        "52. The children of Germany and France caught the madness of the hour,\nand resolved upon a crusade of their own. Inspired by the preaching of\na fanatical priest named Nicholas, twenty thousand boys of the average\nage of twelve years assembled at Cologne. They came from all ranks of\nlife, and the heir of the proud noble marched side by side with the\nson of the humblest peasant. Sisters, priests, and servants joined the\nthrong, swelling the numbers and adding to the confusion.",
        "53. Their journey began in July, 1212, and their destination was\nPalestine, and they were to go by way of Rome, so as to obtain the\nassistance and the blessing of the Pope. In their ignorance these poor\nchildren thought that Palestine was but a few miles distant, and\nbefore the close of the first day’s march excited voices were heard\nasking if the holy sepulchre was in sight. Slowly onward the multitude\nmoved up the Rhine, and over the Mont Cenis pass of the Alps, into\nItaly.",
        "54. But day by day hearts became sick with continued disappointment,\nand little feet weary with the never-ending miles which stretched\nbefore. The weak and the sickly were the first to give out, and,\nthough they struggled to keep their places in the ranks, one by one\nthey fell by the wayside to die alone, with no loving hands to soothe\ntheir last moments or to moisten their parched lips with a drop of\ncold water. The path of the youthful crusaders might be traced by the\nmarks left by thousands of bleeding feet and by the victims stretched\nin death along the course.",
        "55. Death, disease, and desertion soon thinned their ranks to such an\nextent that only one half of their original number lived to reach the\nsummit of the Alps and look down into Italy. The journey across the\nmountains was a fearful one. They had left home in summer, when their\nraiment was thin; it had become scanty and ragged in the long and\ndusty march, so that they were exposed to the full severity of the\ncold. The rocks cut their shoeless feet, but nothing remained but to\npress onward or to lie down and die.",
        "56. Only seven thousand lived to reach Genoa, where they were received\ncoldly, but where they were at last permitted to stay a week to rest.\nThen again onward through the plains of Italy, until all that survived\nmade their way to Rome. Pope Innocent partook of the fanaticism which\naffected all Europe, but the sight of these little victims of the\nuniversal delusion, reduced to mere spectres by hardships, disease,\nand famine, aroused in him an unexpected human sympathy. He blessed\nthe children, forbade them to go farther, and when rested sent them\nback to their German homes.",
        "57. The winter had passed and the spring had come again before the few\nsurvivors reached their beloved fatherland. Day by day there came\nstraggling into the German cities groups of these victims, their heads\ndrooping for shame, their eyes red with tears, their clothing in rags.\nMany died upon realizing the last hope which had sustained them so\nlong. Sad-eyed mothers looked in vain among the thin ranks for their\nbeloved ones, and time only soothed the untold misery of this wild\nenterprise.",
        "58. Soon after the departure of the German children on their crusade\nunder Nicholas, another of about equal numbers set out from Cologne by\na different route. They crossed the Alps by the pass of St. Gothard,\nand descended into Eastern Italy. Keeping along the coast of the\nAdriatic, they at last came to the southern front of the peninsula,\nand could go no farther. They met with a fate similar to that of the\nfirst band, with the additional horror that many of them were seized\nby Turkish pirates and carried away into life-long slavery. The few\nwho survived to reach Southern Italy embarked on a vessel, and never\nwere heard of more. No messenger even returned to the vine-clad hills\nof the Rhine to report the fate of the little ones, and they all\ndisappeared from the aching gaze of anxious mothers as though the\nearth had swallowed them up.",
        "59. The third children’s crusade set out from France under the\nleadership of a bare-footed friar named Stephen. They numbered thirty\nthousand, and their first destination was Marseilles, whence they were\nto take shipping for Palestine through means directly provided by the\nLord. Through the broad fields of France, during the hot summer days,\nthe crusaders marched, every mile marked by victims; and, when the\nwhite walls of the city of their destination became visible, their\nnumbers were reduced one half.",
        "60. The charity of Marseilles was taxed to its utmost to provide for\nthe fifteen thousand mouths open to receive it. Through weary weeks\nthe children waited in vain for the promised aid from the Lord.\nDespair was more fatal than famine, and soon two thirds of those who\nhad reached the city perished. When their numbers were reduced to five\nthousand, apparently the promise of Divine aid was fulfilled. Two\nwealthy and benevolent merchants volunteered to send the children on\nto their destination. Seven ships were prepared, and into these the\nfive thousand crowded, believing their troubles were at an end.",
        "61. The ships sailed out of port, freighted with mother love and\nreligious blessings. To anxious eyes that watched their departure,\ntheir white sails, lessening in the distance, wafted back messages of\nhope and assurance. At the dawn of another day the last speck had\ndisappeared, and the blue waves of the Mediterranean rolled\ntranquilly, as if jealously guarding the secrets of fate. But time\nwent on. Homeward-bound vessels, direct from the scene of conflict,\nsaw the precious fleet. News of stern conflicts with the infidels was\nbrought by wandering palmers; but from sailor merchant, from peasant\nwarrior, and from noble, scarred with Saracenic wounds, there was a\ndeath-like silence in regard to the little wanderers. Streaming eyes\nfixed upon the East looked in vain until all tears were quenched in\ndeath.",
        "62. Eighteen years passed since the children’s fleet sailed out of\nEuropean life. Then a vague rumor of treachery began to circulate,\nand, little by little, the details came out of one of the most inhuman\ncrimes that ever shocked the hearts of men. The benevolent merchants\nwho furnished the ships had sold the children to the barbarous\nMoslems, and the course of the fleet was turned from east to south. On\nthe second day out a great storm arose, and two of the ships\nfoundered, and all on board perished. A more horrible fate awaited the\nsurvivors. Landing in a city of the Moors in northern Africa, they\nwere conducted to a secure prison, and from the gloomy portals they\npassed out into distant and perpetual slavery. One by one the captives\ndied, some by disease, some by cruelty, others passed away in old age.\nAt length all dropped their weary burdens, and their toils and sorrows\nended. Not one of the hundreds that sailed out of Marseilles on that\nsunny afternoon ever saw Europe again. Rarely in the history of the\nworld has a story in real life been freighted with so much woe as fell\nto the lot of the victims of the strange madness which swept over\nEurope less than seven hundred years ago. Peace to their memories!",
        "63. At last an army was organized, and Innocent announced that he\nhimself would lead the host to the defense of the holy sepulchre; but\nhis death intervened before the project was ripe. Andrew, king of\nHungary, was the only monarch who had leisure or inclination to leave\nhis dominions. He led the army to Palestine and defeated the Saracens,\nbut failed to follow up his victory, and soon after abandoned the\nenterprise. The Duke of Austria, who succeeded him as leader, directed\nthe whole energy of the crusade against Egypt; and Damietta, which\ncommanded the river Nile, was chosen as the first point of attack.\nFinding themselves unable to successfully defend the city, the Moslems\noffered to yield the whole of Palestine to the Christians upon the\ncondition of the evacuation of Egypt. With a blindness almost\nincredible these terms were refused, and a last attack made on the\nwalls of Damietta. The besieged made but slight resistance, and the\nChristians entered the city, to find out of seventy thousand but three\nthousand remaining, so fearful had been the scourge of plague and\nfamine. Several months were spent in Damietta. The climate either\nweakened the frames or obscured the understandings of the Christians,\nfor after their conquest they remained inactive until the Moslems\nrecuperated their army and were able to recapture Damietta and expel\nthe Crusaders from Egypt.",
        "64. With a view to the recovery of the Holy Land, Frederick II, of\nGermany, had been married to Iolante, the heiress of the kingdom of\nJerusalem. His early life was spent in Sicily, in familiar intercourse\nwith Jews and Arabs, and Sicily was to the last the favored portion of\nhis dominion. The emperor’s court was given up to unpardonable\nfrivolities in the eyes of Pope Gregory IX, one of whose first\npontifical acts was to summon Frederick to a new crusade. The emperor\npaid little heed to the aged Pope’s exhortations and commands,\npostponing from time to time the period of his departure. He embarked\nat last, but in ten days returned. The Pope was not to be trifled\nwith, and pronounced his excommunication. Frederick treated it with\ncontempt, and appealed to Christendom to sustain him. For this be\nunderwent a more tremendous excommunication, but his partisans in Rome\nraised an insurrection and expelled the Pope.",
        "65. And now Frederick set sail of his own accord on his crusading\nexpedition. On reaching the Holy Land he was received with joy by the\nknights and pilgrims, but the clergy held aloof from him as under the\nban of the Church. He negotiated privately with the Sultan of Egypt.\nThe Christian camp was thronged with Saracens. The emperor wore a\nSaracen dress. In his privacy he did not hesitate to say, “I came not\nhere to deliver the Holy City, but to maintain my estimation among the\nFranks.” To the Sultan he appealed: “Out of your goodness surrender\nto me Jerusalem as it is, that I may be able to lift up my head among\nthe kings of Christendom.” Accordingly, the city was surrendered to\nhim. The Pope repudiated the transaction.",
        "66. While the emperor proclaimed his successes to Europe, the pope\ndenounced them. Frederick crowned himself at Jerusalem, being unable\nto find any ecclesiastic who dared to perform the ceremony, and\ndeparted from the Holy Land. He prepared to enter on his conflict with\nthe pontiff, and drew over to his side the general sentiment of\nEurope; the Pope was made to give way, and peace proclaimed. The\ntreaty, which closed the sixth crusade, was for ten years.",
        "67. On neither side probably was the truce strictly kept, and the\ninjuries done to pilgrims on their way from Acre to Jerusalem were\nalleged as a sufficient reason for sending out the expedition headed\nby Richard, Earl of Cornwall, brother of the English Henry III, and\nafterward King of the Romans. This expedition may be regarded as the\nseventh in the list of crusades, and deserves notice as having been\nbrought to an end, like that of Frederick, by a treaty, in 1240. The\nterms of the latter covenant were even more favorable to the\nChristians, but, two years later, the Latin power, such as it was, was\nswept away by the sword of Korasmians, pushed onward by the hordes of\nJenghiz Khan. The awful inroad was alleged by Pope Innocent IV as\nreason for summoning Christendom again to the rescue of the Holy Land.",
        "68. Nearly seven years passed away before the French king, Louis IX,\nwas able to set sail for Egypt. The royal saint, who lives for us in\nthe quaint and graphic account of his seneschal Joinville, may with\ntruth be said to have been animated by a spirit of devotion and\nself-sacrifice. Intolerant in theory and bigoted in language, Louis\nhad that true charity which would make him succor his enemies not less\nthan his friends. Nor was his bravery less signal than his gentleness.\nHis dauntless courage saved his army from complete destruction at\nMansourah in 1249, but his offer to exchange Damietta for Jerusalem\nwas rejected, and in the retreat, during which they were compelled to\nfight at desperate disadvantage, Louis was taken prisoner. With serene\npatience he underwent suffering, for which the Saracens, so Joinville\ntells us, frankly confessed that they would have renounced Mahommed;\nand, when the payment of his ransom set him free, he made a pilgrimage\nin sackcloth to Nazareth in 1250. As a general he achieved nothing,\nbut his humiliation involved no dishonor; and the genuineness of his\nfaith, his devotion, and his love had been fully tested in the furnace\nof affliction.",
        "69. The crusading fire was now rapidly burning itself out. In the West\nthere was nothing to awaken again the enthusiasm which had been\nstirred by Peter the Hermit and St. Bernard, while in Palestine itself\nthe only signs of genuine activity were furnished by the antagonism\nbetween the religious orders there. The quarrels of Templars and\nHospitallers led to a pitched battle in 1259, in which almost all the\nTemplars were slain.",
        "70. Some eight years later the tidings that Antioch had been taken by\nthe infidels revived in St. Louis the old yearning for the rescue of\nthe holy places. Cheered by the sympathy of Pope Clement IV, he\nembarked with an army of sixty thousand in 1270, but a storm drove his\nships to Sardinia, and thence they sailed for Tunis. They encamped on\nthe site of Carthage, when a plague broke out. The saintly king was\namong the victims, and the truest of all crusaders died. In the\nfollowing year Edward, of England, reached Acre, took Nazareth–the\ninhabitants of which he massacred–fell sick, and during his sickness\nnarrowly escaped being murdered by an assassin sent by the Emir of\nJoppa. Having made a peace for nine years, he returned to Europe, and\nthe ninth and last crusade was at an end.",
        "71. The after fate of the Holy Land may be briefly told: The\nChristians, unmindful of their past sufferings and of the jealous\nneighbors they had to deal with, first broke the truce by plundering\nsome Egyptian traders, near Margat. The Sultan revenged the outrage by\ntaking possession of Margat, and war once more raged between the two\nnations. Tripoli and the other cities were captured in succession,\nuntil at last Acre was the only city of Palestine remaining to the\nChristians.",
        "72. The Grand Master of the Templars collected his small and devoted\nband, and prepared to defend to the death the last possession of the\norder. Europe was deaf to his cry, the numbers of the foe were\noverwhelming, and devoted bravery was of no avail. In the disastrous\nsiege the Christians were all but exterminated. The Grand Master fell\nat the head of his knights, pierced by many wounds. Seven Templars and\nas many Hospitallers alone escaped from the dreadful carnage. The\nvictorious Moslems then set fire to the city, and the rule of the\nChristians in Palestine was brought to a close forever.",
        "73. Kingsley ably summarizes the effects of the crusades as follow:\n\"Egypt was still the center of communication between the two great\nstations of the Moslem power; and, indeed, as Mr. Lane has shown us in\nhis most valuable translation of the ’Arabian Nights,’ possessed a\npeculiar life and character of its own.",
        "74. “It was the rash object of the crusaders to extinguish that life.\nPalestine was first their point of attack, but the later crusaders\nseem to have found, like all the rest of the world, that the destinies\nof Palestine could not be separated from those of Egypt, and to\nDamietta accordingly was directed that last disastrous attempt of St.\nLouis. The crusaders failed utterly of the object at which they aimed.\nThey succeeded in an object of which they never dreamed; for in those\ncrusades the Moslem and the Christian had met face to face, and found\nthat both were men, that they had a common humanity, a common eternal\nstandard of nobility and virtue. So the Christian knights went home\nhumbler and wiser men, when they found in the Saracen enemies the same\ngenerosity, truth, mercy, chivalrous self-sacrifice, which they\nfancied their own peculiar possession; and, added to that, a\ncivilization and a learning which they could only admire and imitate.\nAnd, thus, from the era of the crusades, a kindlier feeling sprang up\nbetween the Crescent and the Cross, till it was again broken by the\nfearful invasions of the Turks through Eastern Europe.",
        "75. “The learning of the Moslem, as well as their commerce, began to\npour rapidly into Christendom, both from Spain, Egypt, and Syria; and\nthus the crusaders were, indeed, rewarded according to their deeds.\nThey took the sword and perished by the sword. But the truly noble\nelement in them, the element which our hearts and reasons recognize\nand love, in spite of all the folly and fanaticism of the crusades,\nwhensoever we read ’Ivanhoe’ or the ’Talisman,’ the element of loyal\nfaith and self-sacrifice, did not go unrequited.",
        "76. “They learned wider, juster views of man and virtue, which I can\nnot help believing must have had great effect in weakening in their\nminds the old, exclusive, bigoted notions, and in paving the way for\nthe great outburst of free thought and the great assertion of the\ndignity of humanity which the fifteenth century beheld. They opened a\npath for that influx of scientific knowledge which has produced in\nafter centuries the most enormous effects on the welfare of Europe,\nand made life possible for millions who would otherwise have been pent\nwithin the narrow bounds of Europe to devour each other in the\nstruggle for life and bread!”",
        "1. While the great sovereigns of Europe were busy in fighting the\nMoslems in Palestine, they did not entirely neglect affairs at home.\nSome of them were very good rulers, protecting their subjects and\nmaintaining good order, and others were tyrannical and imposed all\nsorts of taxes and heavy burdens upon the people. Up among the Alps,\nwhere the country is made up of rough, rocky mountains and narrow\nvalleys, lived a people who were practically free. They lived in\nlittle communities, each one of which elected its own magistrate or\ngovernor, and made its own laws. The region was so poor and rough that\nthe neighboring kings little cared to get possession of it, and the\nAlpine dwellers had a greater amount of freedom than any other people\nof Europe. The country was divided into little separate communities,\none of which was called Schwytz, and this afterward gave the name to\nthe whole country–Switzerland.",
        "2. This country of the Swiss was really a part of the German empire,\nbut the emperors had extended their rule over the lower parts of the\ncountry, leaving the forest cantons free. And a brave, courageous, and\nindustrious people grew up there. No pauper-house among the Alps, for\nevery able-bodied person worked, and no body tried to rob his neighbor\nof his honest earnings. They were a strong athletic race, and the\nmonarchs of the surrounding countries were glad to secure Swiss\nsoldiers, for it was said that the Swiss never deserted. In 1298,\nwhile Wallace was struggling for freedom in Scotland, Albert of\nAustria, the second of the house of Hapsburg, resolved to get\npossession of the free forest cantons. He observed great secrecy in\ncarrying out his designs, and it was not until a tax-gatherer or\nbailiff was permanently established in the country, supported by\nAustrian soldiers, that the people awakened to their danger. The story\nthat follows is one that all true Swiss delight to believe, and,\nthough it may not be true in regard to names and details, yet as a\nrecord of the main incidents of history it is substantially correct.",
        "3. The first Austrian bailiff was Hermann Gessler, who built a strong\nfortress at Küssnacht, in Uri. At first he professed great love for\nthe people, but when he became firmly established he threw off the\nmask, and showed himself to be a cruel, cowardly, mean-spirited\ntyrant. He was both vain and greedy, and he exacted both homage and\ntribute from the surrounding peasantry. Property was seized by the\nsoldiers, and, should the owner venture to remonstrate, he was\nmercilessly beaten or killed on the spot. Complaints to the governor\nwere followed by fresh outrages, until no one, even in the most\nsecluded valleys, considered himself safe. Here tyranny as usual\noverstepped the bounds of safety. The free spirit, born of toil and\nprivations in the mountain-fastnesses, would not long endure the\noutrages to which the people were subjected. A leader only was needed\nto induce a general revolt, and this leader was found in the person of\nWilliam Tell.",
        "4. William Tell, according to the received accounts, was born at\nBürgelen, a secluded hamlet in the canton of Uri, near the lake of\nLucerne, about the year 1275; and, like his forefathers, was the\nproprietor of a cottage, a few small fields, a vineyard, and an\norchard. When William had reached the age of twenty, his father is\nsaid to have died, bequeathing to him these humble possessions.\nEndowed by nature with a lofty and energetic mind, Tell was\ndistinguished also by great physical strength and manly beauty. He was\ntaller by a head than most of his companions; he loved to climb the\nrugged rocks of his native mountains in pursuit of the chamois, and to\nsteer his boat across the lake in time of storm and of danger. The\nload of wood which he could bear upon his shoulders was double that\nwhich any ordinary man could support.",
        "5. With other sources of happiness, Tell combined that of possessing\nan intimate friend, who dwelt amid the rocky heights separating Uri\nfrom Unterwalden. Arnold Auderhalden, of Melchthal, was this\nassociate. Although similar in many salient points of character, there\nwas still an essential difference between the two men. Arnold, of\nMelchthal, while he loved his country with an ardor equal to that of\nTell, and was capable of very great actions, was not prepared for much\npatient suffering or long endurance of wrong. Tell, whose temperament\nwas more calm, and whose passions were more influenced by reason than\nimpulse, only succeeded in restraining his friend’s impulsive\ncharacter by the stern force of example. Meantime the two friends\npassed their days in the enjoyment of one another’s society, visiting\nat intervals each other’s humble residence. Tell foresaw, on the\narrival of Gessler, many of the misfortunes which must inevitably\nfollow his iron rule, and without explaining his views even to Arnold,\nof Melchthal, without needlessly alarming his family, endeavored to\ndevise some means, not of bearing the yoke patiently, but of\ndelivering his country from the galling oppression which Albert had\nbrought upon it. The hero felt satisfied that the evil deeds of the\ngovernor would sooner or later bring just retribution upon him; for\nthis, and many other reasons, therefore, despite his own secret\nwishes, when Arnold poured out his fiery wrath in the ear of his\nfriend, he listened calmly, and, to avoid inflaming him more, avowed\nnone of his own views, or even feelings, in return.",
        "6. One evening, however, William Tell and his wife sat in front of\ntheir cottage, watching their son amusing himself amid the flocks,\nwhen the former grew more thoughtful and sad than usual. Presently\nTell spoke, and for the first time imparted to his wife some of his\nmost secret designs. While the conversation was still proceeding, the\nparents saw their son rush toward them crying for help, and shouting\nthe name of old Melchthal. As he spoke, Arnold’s father appeared in\nsight, led by his grand-child, and feeling his way with a stick. Tell\nand his wife hastened forward, and discovered, to their inconceivable\nhorror, that their friend was blind, his eyes having been put out with\nhot irons. The hero of Bürgelen, burning with just indignation, called\non the old man to explain the fearful sight, and also the cause of\nArnold’s absence.",
        "7. It appeared that that very morning the father, son, and\ngrand-daughter were in the fields loading a couple of oxen with\nproduce for the market-town, when an Austrian soldier presented\nhimself, and, having examined the animals, which appeared to suit his\nfancy, ordered their owner to unyoke the beasts preparatory to his\ndriving them off. Adding insolence to tyranny, he further remarked\nthat such clod-poles might very well draw their own plows and carts.\nArnold, furious at the man’s daring impertinence, was only restrained\nby his father’s earnest entreaties from sacrificing the robber on the\nspot; nothing, however, could prevent him from aiming a blow at the\nsoldier, which broke two of his fingers.",
        "8. The enraged soldier then retreated; but old Melchthal, who well\nknew the character of Gessler, immediately forced Arnold, much against\nhis inclination, to go and conceal himself for some days in the Righi.\nScarcely had Arnold departed in this direction, when a detachment of\nguards from Altorf surrounded their humble tenement, and dragged old\nMelchthal before Gessler, who ordered him to give up his son. Furious\nat the refusal which ensued, the tyrant commanded the old man’s eyes\nto be put out, and then sent him forth blind to deplore his\nmisfortunes.",
        "9. Tell heard the story of Melchthal in silence, and, when he had\nfinished, inquired the exact spot of his son’s concealment. The father\nreplied that it was in a particular cavern of Mount Righi, the desert\nrocks of which place are unknown to the emissaries of the governor,\nand there he had promised to remain until he received his parent’s\npermission to come forth. This Tell requested might be granted\nimmediately; and, turning to his son, ordered him to start at once for\nthe Righi with a message to Arnold. Walter obeyed gladly; and,\nproviding himself with food, and receiving private instructions from\nhis father, went on his journey under cover of the night.",
        "10. Tell himself then threw around his own person a cloak of\nwolf-skin, seized his quiver full of sharp arrows, and, taking his\nterrible bow, which few could bend, in hand, bade adieu to his wife\nfor a few days, and took his departure in an opposite direction from\nthat pursued by his son. It was quite dawn when Walter reached the\nRighi, and a slight column of blue smoke speedily directed him to the\nspot where Arnold lay concealed. The intrusion at first startled the\nfugitive; but, recognizing Tell’s son, he listened eagerly to his\ndismal story, the conclusion of which roused in him so much fury that\nhe would have rushed forth at once to assassinate Gessler had not\nWalter restrained him.",
        "11. Schooled by Tell, he informed him that his father was engaged in\npreparing vengeance for the tyrant’s crime, being at that moment with\nWerner Stauffacher concerting proper measures of resistance. “’Go,’\nsaid my father, ’and tell Arnold of this new villany of the\ngovernor’s, and say that it is not rage which can give us just\nrevenge, but the utmost exertion of courage and prudence. I leave\nSchwytz to bid Werner arm his canton: let Melchthal go to Stautz and\nprepare the men of Unterwalden for the outbreak; having done this, let\nhim meet me, with Fürst and Werner, in the field of Grütli!’”",
        "12. Arnold, scarcely taking time to refresh himself with food, sent\nWalter on his homeward journey, while he started for Stautz. Walter,\nwhen alone, turned his steps toward Altorf, where unfortunately, and\nunknown to himself, he came into the presence of Gessler, to whom he\nuttered somewhat hard things about the state of the country, being led\nto commit himself by the artful questions of the tyrant, who\nimmediately ordered the lad into confinement, with strict injunctions\nto the guards to seize whomsoever should claim him.",
        "13. Meanwhile, certain doubts and fears, from he knew not what cause,\narose in the mind of Gessler, and struck him with a presentiment that\nall was not right. He imagined that the people wore in their looks\nless abject submission to his authority, and, the better to satisfy\nhimself of the correctness or erroneousness of this view, he commanded\nBerenger to erect at dawn of day, in the market-place of Altorf, a\npole, on the point of which he was to place the ducal cap of Austria.\nAn order was further promulgated, to the effect that every one passing\nnear or within sight of it should make obeisance, in proof of his\nhonor and fealty to the duke.",
        "14. Numerous soldiers under arms were directed to surround the place,\nto keep the avenues, and to compel the passers-by to bend with proper\nrespect to the emblem of the governing power of the three cantons.\nGessler likewise determined that whoever should disobey the mandate\nshould be accused of disaffection, and treated accordingly; a measure\nwhich promised both to discover the discontented, and furnish\nsufficient grounds for their punishment. Numerous detachments of\ntroops, among whom money had been previously distributed, were then\nplaced around to see that his commands were scrupulously obeyed.\nHistory scarcely records another instance of tyranny so galling and\nhumiliating to the oppressed, and so insolent on the part of its\nauthor.",
        "15. The proceedings of Tell in the interval were of the deepest\nconcern to the country. Having arrived within the territory of\nSchwytz, and at the village of Stainea, he called at the house of\nWerner, and, being admitted, threw at his feet a heavy bundle of\nlances, arrows, cross-bows, and swords. “Werner Stauffacher,” cried\nTell, “the time is come for action!” and without a moment’s delay he\ninformed his friend of all that had passed, dwelling minutely on every\ndetail. And, when he had at length finished, the cautious Werner could\nrestrain his wrath no longer, but exclaimed, clasping the hero’s hand,\n\"Friend, let us begin; I am ready!” After further brief conference,\nthey, by separate ways, carried round arms to their friends in the\ntown and neighboring villages. Many hours were thus consumed; and,\nwhen their weapons were at last distributed, they both returned to\nStauffacher’s house, snatched some slight refreshment, and then sped\non their way to Grütli, accompanied by ten of their most tried\nadherents.",
        "16. The lake of Lucerne was soon reached, and a boat procured. Werner,\nperceiving the furious tempest, inquired of Tell if his skill would\nenable him to struggle against the storm. “Arnold awaits us!” cried\nWilliam; “and the fate of our country depends on this interview!” With\nthese words he leaped into the boat, Werner jumped after him, and the\nrest followed. Tell cast loose the agitated vessel, seized the tiller,\nand, hoisting sail, the little craft flew along the waves.",
        "17. Presently, it is said, the wind moderated, and ere they reached\nthe opposite side had ceased altogether–a phenomenon common in these\nmountain lakes. The boat was now made fast, and the conspirators\nhastened to the field of Grütli, where, at the mouth of a cavern of\nthe same name, Arnold and Walter Fürst awaited them, each with ten\nother companions. Tell allowed no consideration of natural feeling to\nsilence the calls of duty, but at once came to the point. He first\ngave a brief sketch of the state of the country under the Austrian\nbailiffs, and, having shown to the satisfaction of his companions the\nnecessity for immediate and combined action, is related to have added:\n\"We may have our plans frustrated by delay, and the time has come for\naction. I ask only a few days for preparation. Unterwalden and Schwytz\nare armed. Three hundred and fifty warriors are, I am assured, ready.\nI will remain in Altorf, and, as soon as I receive tidings from Fürst,\nwill fire a huge pile of wood near my house. At this signal let all\nmarch to the rendezvous, and, when united, we will pour down upon\nAltorf, where I will then strive to rouse the people!”",
        "18. This plan of the campaign was agreed to; and it was further\nresolved that, in the enterprise upon which they were now embarked, no\none should be guided by his own private opinion, nor ever forsake his\nfriends; that they should jointly live or jointly die in defense of\nthe common cause; that each should in his own vicinity promote the\nobject in view, trusting that the whole nation would one day have\ncause to bless their friendly union; that the Count of Hapsburg should\nbe deprived of none of his lands, vassals, or prerogatives; that the\nfreedom which they had inherited from their fathers they were\ndetermined to assert, and to hand down to their children untainted and\nundiminished. Then Stauffacher, Fürst, and Melcthal, and the other\nconspirators, stepped forward, and, raising their hands, swore that\nthey would die in defense of that freedom. After this solemn oath, and\nafter an agreement that New Year’s Day should be chosen for the\noutbreak, unless, in the meantime, a signal fire should arouse the\ninhabitants on some sudden emergency, the heroes separated. Arnold\nreturned to Stautz, Werner to Schwytz, while Tell and Fürst took their\nway to Altorf. The sun already shone brightly as Tell entered the\ntown, and he at once advanced into the public place, where the first\nobject which caught his eye was a handsome cap embroidered with gold\nstuck upon the end of a long pole. Soldiers walked around it in\nrespectful silence, and the people of Altorf, as they passed, bowed\ntheir heads profoundly to the symbol of power.",
        "19. Tell was much surprised at this new and strange manifestation of\nservility, and, leaning on his cross-bow, gazed contemptuously both on\nthe people and the soldiers. Berenger, captain of the guard, at length\nobserved this man, who alone, amid a cringing populace, carried his\nhead erect. He went to him, and fiercely asked why he neglected to pay\nobedience to the orders of Hermann Gessler? Tell replied that he saw\nno reason why he should bow to a hat, or even to the one which the hat\nrepresented. This bold language surprised Berenger, who ordered Tell\nto be disarmed, and then, surrounded by guards, he was carried before\nthe governor. “Wherefore,” demanded the incensed bailiff, “Hast thou\ndisobeyed my orders, and failed in thy respect to the emperor? Why\nhast thou dared to pass before the sacred badge of thy sovereign\nwithout the evidence of homage required of thee?” “Verily,” answered\nTell, with mock humility, “how this happened I know not; ’tis an\naccident, and no mark of contempt. Suffer me, therefore, in thy\nclemency to depart.”",
        "20. Gessler was irritated at this reply, feeling assured that there\nwas something beneath the tranquil and bitter smile of the prisoner\nwhich he could not fathom. Suddenly he was struck by the resemblance\nwhich existed between him and the boy Walter, whom he had met the\nprevious day, and immediately ordered him to be brought forward.",
        "21. Gessler now inquired the prisoner’s name, which he no sooner\nlearned than he recognized as that of the archer so celebrated\nthroughout the canton. As soon as the youth arrived, the governor\nturned to Tell and told him that he had heard of his extraordinary\ndexterity, and was accordingly determined to put it to proof. “While\nbeholding justice done, the people of Altorf shall also admire thy\nskill. Thy son shall be placed a hundred yards distant, with an apple\non his head; if thou hast the good fortune to carry off the apple in\ntriumph with one of thy arrows, I pardon both, and restore your\nliberty. If thou refusest this trial, thy son shall die before thine\neyes!”",
        "22. Tell implored Gessler to spare him so cruel an experiment, but,\nfinding the governor inexorable, the hero submitted to the trial. He\nwas conducted into the public place, where the required distance was\nmeasured by Berenger–a double row of soldiers shutting up three sides\nof the square. The people, awe-stricken and trembling, pressed behind.\nWalter stood with his back to a linden tree, patiently awaiting the\nexciting moment. Hermann Gessler, some distance behind, watched every\nmotion. His cross-bow and belt were handed to Tell; he tried the\npoint, broke the weapon, and demanded his quiver. It was brought to\nhim, and emptied at his feet. William stooped down, and, taking a long\ntime to choose one, managed to hide a second in his girdle; the other\nhe held in his hand, and proceeded to string his bow, while Berenger\ncleared away the remaining arrows. After hesitating, he drew the bow,\naimed, shot, and the apple, struck through the core, was carried away\nby the arrow.",
        "23. The market-place was filled by loud cries of admiration. Walter\nflew to embrace his father, who, overcome by the excess of his\nemotions, fell insensible to the ground, thus exposing the second\narrow to view. Gessler stood over him awaiting his recovery, which\nspeedily took place. Tell rose, and turned away from the governor,\nwho, however, thus addressed him: “Incomparable archer! I will keep my\npromise; but,” added he, “tell me what needed you with that second\narrow which you have, I see, secreted in your girdle? One was surely\nenough.” “The second shaft,” replied Tell, “was to pierce thy heart,\ntyrant, if I had chanced to harm my son!” At these words the terrified\ngovernor retired behind his guards, revoked his promise of pardon,\ncommanding him further to be placed in irons, and to be reconducted to\nthe fort. He was obeyed, and, as slight murmurs rose among the people,\ndouble patrols of Austrian soldiers paraded the streets, and forced\nthe citizens to retire to their houses. Walter, released, fled to join\nArnold, of Melchthal, according to a whispered order from his father.",
        "24. Gessler, reflecting on the aspect of the people, and fearful that\nsome plot was in progress, which his accidental shortness of\nprovisions rendered more unfortunate, determined to rid his citadel of\nthe object which might induce an attack. With this in view, he\nsummoned Berenger, and said to him: “I am about to leave Altorf, and\nyou shall command during my absence. I leave my brave soldiers, who\nwill readily obey your voice; and soon, returning with supplies and\nreinforcements, we will crush this vile people, and punish them for\ntheir insolent murmurings. Prepare me a large boat, in which thirty\nmen, picked from my guard, may depart with me. As soon as night comes\non, load this audacious Tell with chains, and send him on board. I\nwill myself take him where he can expiate his crimes!”",
        "25. The evening was fine and promising; the boat danced along the\nplacid waters. The air was pure, the waves tranquil, the stars shone\nbrightly in the sky. A light southern breeze aided the efforts of the\noarsmen, and tempered the rigor of the cold, which night in that\nseason rendered almost insupportable so near the glaciers. All\nappeared in Gessler’s favor. The extent of the first section of the\nlake was soon passed, and the boat headed for Brunnen. Tell, meantime,\nloaded with irons, gazed with eager eye on the desert rocks of Grütli,\nwhere the day before he had planned with his friends for the\ndeliverance of his country. While painful thoughts crossed his mind,\nhis looks were attracted by a dim light which burst forth near his own\nhouse. Presently this light increased, and before long a blaze arose\nvisible all over Uri. The heart of the prisoner beat with joy, for he\nfelt that all efforts were making to rescue him. Gessler observed the\nflame, which in reality was a signal-fire to arouse the cantons, but\nsupposed it some Swiss peasant’s house accidentally in flames.",
        "26. Suddenly, however, between Fluelen and Sissigen, when in deep\nwater, intermingled with shoals, the south wind ceased to blow, and\none of those storms which are common on the lake commenced. A north\nwind burst upon them, raised the waves to a great height, and dashed\nthem over the gunwale of the boat, which, giving way to the fury of\nthe storm, flew toward the shore that, rocky and precipitous, menaced\ntheir lives. The bleak wind brought also frost, snow, and sleet, which\nspread darkness over the waters, and covered the hands and faces of\nthe rowers with ice. The soldiers, inert and panic-stricken, prayed\nfor life, while Gessler, but ill prepared for death, was profuse in\nhis offers of money and other rewards if they would rouse themselves\nto save him.",
        "27. In this emergency the Austrian bailiff was reminded by one of his\nattendants that the prisoner Tell was no less skillful in the\nmanagement of a boat than in the exercise of the bow. “And, see, my\nlord,” said one of the men, representing to Gessler the imminent peril\nthey were all incurring, “all are paralyzed with terror, and even the\npilot is unable to manage the helm!”",
        "28. Gessler’s fear of Tell induced him at first to hesitate, but, the\nprayers of the soldiers becoming pressing, he told the prisoner that\nif he could take them safely through the storm he should be at once\nunbound. Tell having replied that, by the grace of God, he could still\nsave them, was instantly freed from his shackles and placed at the\nhelm, when the boat, answering to a master-hand, kept its course\nsteadily through the bellowing surge, as if conscious of the free\nspirit which had now taken the command.",
        "29. Guiding the obedient tiller at his will, Tell pointed the head of\nthe boat in the direction whence they came, which he knew to be the\nonly safe course; and, encouraging and cheering the rowers, made rapid\nand steady progress through the water. The darkness which now wrapped\nthem round prevented Gessler from discovering that he had turned his\nback on his destination. Tell continued on his way nearly the whole\nnight, the dying light of the signal-fire on the mountain serving as a\nbeacon in enabling him to approach the shores of Schwytz, and to avoid\nthe shoals.",
        "30. Between Sissigen and Fluelen are two mountains, the greater and\nthe lesser Achsenberg, whose sides, hemmed in and rising\nperpendicularly from the bed of the lake, offer not a single platform\nwhere human foot can stand. When near this place dawn broke in the\neastern sky, and Gessler–the danger appearing to decrease–scowled\nupon Tell in sullen silence. As the prow of the vessel was driven\ninland, Tell perceived a solitary table-rock, and called to the\nrowers to redouble their efforts till they should have passed the\nprecipice ahead, observing with ominous truth that it was the most\ndangerous point on the whole lake.",
        "31. The soldiers here recognized their position, and pointed it out to\nGessler, who demanded of Tell what he meant by taking them back to\nAltorf. William, without answering him, brought the bow suddenly close\nupon the rock, seized his bow, and, with an effort which sent the\nunguided craft back into the lake, sprang on shore, scaled the rocks,\nand took the direction of Schwytz.",
        "32. Having thus escaped the clutches of the governor, he made for the\nmain road between Art and Küssnacht, and there hid himself until such\na time as the bailiff should pass that way. Gessler and his attendants\nhaving, with great difficulty, effected a landing at Brunnen,\nproceeded toward Küssnacht. In the spot still known as “the hollow\nway,” and marked by a chapel, Tell overheard the threats pronounced\nagainst himself should he once more be caught, and, in default of his\napprehension, vengeance was vowed against his family. Tell felt that\nthe safety of himself and his wife and children, to say nothing of the\nduty he owed to his country, required the tyrant’s death; and, seizing\nan arrow, he pierced Gessler to the heart.",
        "33. The bold deed accomplished, the hero effected his escape to\nStemen, where he found Werner Stauffacher preparing to march.\nImmediate action was now necessary, but the original decision of the\nconspirators remained unchanged. Accordingly, on the morning of New\nYear’s Day, 1308, the castle of Rostberg, in Obwalden, was taken\npossession of, its keeper, Berenger, of Landasberg, made prisoner, and\ncompelled to promise that he would never again set foot within the\nterritory of the three cantons, after which he was allowed to retire\nto Lucerne.",
        "34. Stauffacher, the same morning, at the head of the men of Schwytz,\ndestroyed the fortress of Schwanan, while Tell and the men of Uri took\npossession of Altorf. On the following Sunday the deputies of Uri,\nSchwytz, and Unterwalden met, and renewed that fraternal league which\nhas endured to this day.",
        "35. In 1315 Leopold, second son of Albert, determined to punish the\nconfederate cantons for their revolt, and accordingly marched against\nthem at the head of a considerable army, accompanied by a numerous\nretinue of nobles. Count Otho, of Strasberg, one of his ablest\ngenerals, crossed the Brunig with a body of four thousand men,\nintending to attack Upper Unterwalden. The bailiffs of Willisan, of\nWodhausen, and of Lucerne meantime armed a fourth of that number to\nmake a descent on the lower division of the same canton, while the\nemperor in person, at the head of his army of reserve, poured down\nfrom Egerson on Mogarten, in the country of Schwytz, ostentatiously\ndisplaying an extensive supply of rope where with to hang the chiefs\nof the rebels.",
        "36. The confederates, in order to oppose this formidable invasion,\noccupied a position in the mountains bordering on the convent of Our\nLady of the Hermits. Four hundred men of Uri, and three hundred of\nUnterwalden, had effected a junction with the warriors of Schwytz, who\nformed the principal force of the little army. Fifty men, banished\nfrom this latter canton, offered themselves to combat beneath their\nbanner, intending to efface by their valor the remembrance of past\nfaults. Early on the morning of November 15, 1315, some thousands of\nwell-armed Austrian knights slowly ascended the hill on which the\nSwiss were posted, with the hope of dislodging them; the latter,\nhowever, advanced to meet their enemies, uttering the most terrific\ncries. The band of banished men, having precipitated large stones and\nfragments of rocks from the hillsides and from overhanging cliffs,\nrushed from behind the sheltering influence of a thick fog and threw\nthe advancing columns into confusion. The Austrians immediately broke\ntheir ranks, and presently a complete rout, with terrible slaughter,\nensued. The flower of the Austrian chivalry perished on the field of\nMorgarten, beneath the halberts, arrows, and iron-headed clubs of the\nshepherds. Leopold, himself, though he succeeded in gaining the\nshattered remnant of his forces, had a narrow escape, while the Swiss,\nanimated by victory, hastened to Unterwalden, where they defeated\nanother body of Austrians. In this instance Count Otho had as narrow\nan escape as the emperor.",
        "37. After these two well-fought fields, the confederates hastened to\nrenew their ancient alliance, which was solemnly sworn to in an\nassembly held at Brunnen on the eighth day of December.",
        "38. After the battle of Morgarten one canton after another threw off\nthe Austrian yoke, and joined the forest cantons, until nearly all\nSwitzerland was joined in a confederacy. A later war waged by Albert\nproved disastrous to the Austrian cause, and ended by a further\nconsolidation of the Swiss cantons. In 1356, seventy years after\nMorgarten, the Austrians made another attempt to bring the brave\nmountaineers into subjection. An army of nine thousand men, the best\ntrained soldiers of the empire, under the lead of the Archduke\nLeopold, invaded the country. To these the confederates opposed a\nforce of fourteen hundred. They met in a valley near the lake of\nSempach. The Austrians had learned something of Swiss warfare, and\nknew that they stood no chance in a hand-to-hand conflict with the\nSwiss, and so they formed their men into squares, with a wall of\nbristling spears on every side. Upon this solid mass of men the Swiss\ncould make no impression. In vain they charged with the fiery courage\nwhich had so often gained them the victory; they could find no\nvulnerable point in the serried columns, and it seemed that the brave\nmountaineers must all perish, and leave their homes again to the mercy\nof the Austrian soldiers. But, when almost in despair, the tide of\nbattle was turned by the acts of a single Swiss soldier, Arnold\nWinkelried, of Unterwalden. He communicated his plan to his immediate\nneighbors, and then, rushing forward, he grasped as many of the\nAustrian spears as he could reach; and, gathering them together, he\nbowed to the ground with the spears buried in his breast. Into the\nbreach his companions rushed, and with their powerful swords they soon\nwidened the space, so that the whole Swiss force had room for action.\nThe Austrians were almost annihilated, Leopold himself being slain.\nThe poet Montgomery has given the following version of this event:",
        "  39. “Make way for liberty!” he cried;\n  “Make way for liberty!” and died.\n\n  40. In arms the Austrian phalanx stood,\n  A living wall, a human wood!\n  A wall where every conscious stone\n  Seemed to its kindred thousands grown;\n  A rampart all assaults to bear,\n  Till time to dust their frames should wear!\n  A wood, like that enchanted grove\n  In which with fiends Rinaldo strove,\n  Where every silent tree possessed\n  A spirit prisoned in its breast,\n  Which the first stroke of coming strife\n  Would startle into hideous life;\n  So dense, so still, the Austrians stood,\n  A living wall, a human wood!\n  Impregnable their front appears,\n  All horrent with projected spears,\n  Whose polished points before them shine,\n  From flank to flank, one brilliant line,\n  Bright as the breakers’ splendors run\n  Along the billows, to the sun.\n\n  41. Opposed to these, a hovering band\n  Contended for their native land;\n  Peasants, whose new-found strength had broke\n  From manly necks the ignoble yoke,\n  And forged their fetters into swords,\n  On equal terms to fight their lords\n  And what insurgent rage had gained,\n  In many a mortal fray maintained!\n  Marshaled at morn at Freedom’s call,\n  They come to conquer or to fall,\n  Where he who conquered, he who fell,\n  Was deemed a dead, or living Tell!\n  Such virtue had that patriot breathed,\n  So to the soil his soul bequeathed,\n  That wheresoe’er his arrows flew,\n  Heroes in his own likeness grew,\n  And warriors sprang from every sod\n  Which his awakening footstep trod.\n\n  42. And now the work of life and death\n  Hung on the passing of a breath;\n  The fire of conflict burnt within,\n  The battle trembled to begin;\n  Yet, while the Austrians held their ground,\n  Point for attack was nowhere found.\n  Where’er the impatient Switzers gazed,\n  The unbroken line of lances blazed;\n  That line ’twere suicide to meet,\n  And perish at their tyrant’s feet\n  How could they rest within their graves,\n  And leave their homes the homes of slaves?\n  Would they not feel their children tread\n  With clanging chains above their head?\n\n  43. It must not! This day, this hour,\n  Annihilates the oppressor’s power;\n  All Switzerland is in the field,\n  She will not fly, she can not yield–\n  She must not fall; her better fate\n  Here gives her an immortal date.\n  Few were the numbers she could boast;\n  But every freeman was a host,\n  And felt as though himself were he\n  On whose sole arm hung victory!\n\n  44. It did depend on one, indeed,\n  Behold him–Arnold Winkelried\n  There sounds not to the tramp of fame\n  The echo of a nobler name.\n  Unmarked he stood amid the throng,\n  In rumination deep and long,\n  Till you might see, with sudden grace,\n  The very thought come o’er his face,\n  And by the motion of his form\n  Anticipate the coming storm;\n  And by the uplifting of his brow\n  Tell where the bolt would strike, and how.\n\n  45. But ’twas no sooner thought and done,\n  The field was in a moment won.\n\n  46. “Make way for Liberty!” he cried;\n  Then ran with arms extended wide\n  As if his dearest friend to clasp;\n  Ten spears he swept within his grasp.\n  “Make way for Liberty!” he cried:\n  Their keen points met from side to side;\n  He bowed among them like a tree,\n  And thus made way for Liberty!\n\n  47. Swift to the breach his comrades fly;\n  “Make way for Liberty!” they cry.\n  And through the Austrian phalanx dart,\n  As rushed the spears through Arnold’s heart!\n  While instantaneous as his fall,\n  Rout, ruin, panic, scattered all\n  An earthquake could not overthrow\n  A city with a surer blow.\n\n  48. Thus Switzerland again was free,\n  Thus death made way for Liberty!",
        "49. In the next fifty years the Swiss were engaged in a war with\nAustria and another with France, and in both cases they were\nvictorious. But, while they were exhausted by the incessant wars that\nhad been urged upon them, they were threatened with a more formidable\ninvasion than ever. Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, resolved to\nattach Switzerland to his domain. Crossing the Jura, the duke found\nhimself in possession of Yverdun, it having been betrayed into his\nhands; but the citadel still held out. Charles, irritated that his\nprogress should be stayed by such a handful of men, offered to let\nthem retire home if they would surrender, but if they still held out\nhe would hang them all! The Swiss, knowing prolonged defense was\nuseless, surrendered. As they marched out of the citadel they were\nseized, by order of the duke, and all murdered.",
        "50. Aroused by these horrors, an army of twenty thousand advanced to\nmeet the duke at the head of three times that number. In the battle\nthat ensued the Burgundians were entirely defeated, and Charles\nnarrowly escaped with his life. Writhing under his disgrace, and\nvowing revenge, the duke raised a much more numerous army, and again\ninvaded Switzerland.",
        "51. He advanced by the way of the lake of Neufchatel, and paused a few\ndays to capture the fortress on the banks of Lake Morat. While the\nsiege was going on the Swiss army concentrated, and marched to meet\ntheir foes. Thirty thousand men were to fight the battle of freedom\nagainst one hundred thousand. It was on Saturday, June 22, 1476. The\nweather was threatening, the sky overcast, and rain fell in torrents.\nA vanguard was formed, commanded by John Hallwyl, who knelt and\nbesought a blessing from on high. While they yet prayed the sun broke\nthrough the clouds, upon which the Swiss commander rose, sword in\nhand, crying: “Up, up, Heaven smiles on our victory!” The artillery\nthundered forth as he spoke, and the whole plain, from the lake to the\nrocky heights, became one vast battle-field! Toward the main body of\nthe Burgundians the Swiss army poured down with irresistible force and\ncourage; and, clearing all difficulties, they reached the line of the\nenemy. A fearful slaughter now ensued. The Burgundians were utterly\nvanquished. The haughty duke, pale and dispirited, fled with a few\nfollowers, and never stopped till he reached the banks of Lake Leman.\nThe rout was so complete that many of the Burgundians, in terror and\ndespair, threw themselves into the Lake of Morat, the banks of which\nwere strewed with the bodies of the slain.",
        "52. The battle of Morat lives in history with the victories of\nMarathon and Bannockburn. In each, freedom for the nation was secured,\nand liberty for man was preserved and transmitted. As a deed, the\nSwiss victory for ever freed a people from a grasping foreign tyrant;\nand it is a matter of rejoicing to all who love liberty till to-day,\nand, like other great events, it is the subject of national traditions.",
        "53. According to one of these, a young native of Friburg, who had been\nengaged in the battle, keenly desirous of being the first to carry\nhome tidings of the victory, ran the whole way–a distance of ten or\ntwelve miles–and with such overhaste that on his arrival at the\nmarket-place he dropped with fatigue, and, barely able to shout that\nthe Swiss were victorious, immediately expired. A twig of lime-tree,\nwhich he carried in his hand, was planted on the spot in commemoration\nof this event; and till the present day are seen, in the market-place\nof Friburg, the aged and propped-up remains of the venerable tree\nwhich grew from this twig. In most of the towns of Switzerland a “tree\nof Liberty” is preserved, which came from scions of the original tree\nat Friburg.",
        "1. Six hundred years ago the duty of defending freedom fell to King\nRobert Bruce and the Scotch. And this is how it happened. The time was\nduring the crusades, when all Europe was marching to the East, and\nengaging in battle with the Moslems. Scotland had been an independent\ncountry for many years, but some of her princes were too weak for\nthose troublous times. The witches that deceived Macbeth seem to have\ncast a spell upon the prosperity of the country. Clan was at enmity\nwith clan, and one great chieftain waged relentless war with another.\nThe fierce nobles paid little heed to the king, and showed no regard\nfor the rights of the people. It seemed that peace and liberty had\ndeparted forever.",
        "2. Alexander III died, leaving no direct heir. The Scottish nobles\nassembled to elect who should be their king. The choice lay between\nRobert Bruce and John Balliol. As the nobles could not agree, the\nmatter was referred to King Edward I, of England, who decided in favor\nof Balliol. The new prince was weak, and, when he resented the\ninterference of King Edward in some of his affairs, he was easily\ndefeated and driven from the kingdom. Scotland was now regarded as a\nconquered country, and the people were terribly oppressed. The nobles\nwere deprived of their estates, and the poor people were taxed to the\nverge of starvation. For fifteen years King Edward held on to his\nusurped power, while the weak king Balliol was wandering in foreign\nlands, paying no attention to the distracted state of his country.",
        "3. At last the oppression became so great that conflicts took place\nalmost daily between the Scotch peasants and the English soldiery. On\none occasion, a young man named William Wallace was out a-fishing with\na boy to carry the fish. Two or three English soldiers came along and\ninsisted on taking the fish. Wallace offered to divide with them, but\nthey insisted on taking the whole, when he flew in a rage, killed one\nwith his fishing-pole, and, seizing a sword, put the others to flight.\nHe then fled, and concealed himself in the mountains until the matter\nblew over. On another occasion he killed an Englishman who insulted\nhim at a fair, and fled to his home, where he was pursued by the\nsoldiers. He escaped by the back door, but the cruel English leader,\nHazelrigg, put his wife and servants to death. From that time Wallace\ndevoted himself to fighting the English. He soon collected a band of\noutlaws and attacked the English whereever he found a favorable\nopportunity. He soon had the satisfaction of killing Hazelrigg, and of\ncapturing many important places.",
        "4. The Scotch rose everywhere and joined Wallace, who soon found\nhimself at the head of a formidable army. With this lie captured the\nEnglish fortresses, and finally defeated the chief English army under\nEarl Warren. Scotland was now free, but the English king hastened back\nfrom Flanders to punish the Scotch. The battle of Falkirk was fought\nJuly 22, 1298, and the Scotch were entirely defeated. Wallace again\nbecame a fugitive, but was betrayed into the hands of Edward, and was\nbeheaded and quartered, according to the barbarous custom of the\ntimes.",
        "5. The eyes of all Scotland were now turned to Robert Bruce as the\nonly remaining champion who would be likely to make head against the\nEnglish, and he accepted the proffered leadership. His principal rival\nwas a powerful noble called the Red Comyn, and with this rival Bruce\nsought to make friends. The two met in a church, and Comyn flatly\nrefused to join the Scottish cause, but openly proclaimed his\nadherence to the English. A quarrel arose, and, in the excitement,\nBruce stabbed Comyn. Almost paralyzed at his act, he rushed out of the\nhouse and called for his horse. His friends eagerly inquired what was\nthe matter. “I doubt,” said Bruce, “that I have slain the Red Comyn.\"\n\"Do not leave the matter in doubt,” said Kirkpatrick; “I will make it\ncertain.” He and his companions then rushed into the church and soon\ndispatched Comyn with their daggers.",
        "6. This deed is the one great blot upon the name of Bruce, and\nbitterly did he repent of his rashness. It called down upon his\ndevoted head the anathema of the church for sacrilege in committing\nviolence before the holy altar. It arrayed against him the kinsmen and\nfriends of the Red Comyn, and it produced distrust in the minds of\nmany true friends of Scotland, who could never have confidence in such\nan impetuous leader. Bruce made a vow that, if he succeeded in\nsecuring the freedom of Scotland, he would do penance for his crime by\nentering upon a crusade and fighting for the holy sepulchre.",
        "7. On the 29th of March, 1306, Bruce was crowned king. His enemies\nimmediately attacked and defeated him, and he was obliged to take\nrefuge in the mountains of the Highlands. Here he was hunted like a\nwild animal, and was obliged to flee from one fastness to another. One\nof the most malignant of his enemies was Lord Lorn, a kinsman of the\nRed Comyn. At one time Bruce and his few followers were retreating\nthrough a narrow pass, when he was set upon by Lorn and a much\nsuperior force. Sending his followers ahead, he stopped his horse in\nthe narrow way, and covered their retreat. Upon seeing the king thus\nalone, three powerful highlandmen–a father and two sons–set upon\nhim, determined to kill him or take him prisoner for their master,\nLord Lorn. Bruce struck the first man who came up and seized his\nbridle such a blow with his sword as to cut off his hand and free the\nbridle. The man bled to death. The other brother seized him by the leg\nand attempted to throw him from his horse. The king, setting spurs to\nthe horse, made the animal spring forward so that the Highlander fell\nunder the horse’s feet, and, as he endeavored to rise, the king cleft\nhis head in two with his sword. The father, seeing his two sons thus\nslain, flew at Bruce and grasped him in his mantle so close to his\nbody that he could not have room to wield his long sword. But with an\niron hammer which hung at his saddle-bow, Bruce dashed out the brains\nof this new assailant. The dying man still clung to the king’s mantle,\nso that, to get free, Bruce was obliged to undo the brooch by which it\nwas fastened, and leave it with the mantle behind. This brooch fell\ninto the hands of Lorn, and was kept in the family for many\ngenerations as a memorial of Bruce.",
        "8. But Bruce was soon reduced to greater straits, and, without\nfollowers, was obliged to conceal himself in stables and caves. In all\nhis misfortunes he never gave up the cause of his country, and he\nsacredly devoted his life to the freedom of Scotland. After one of his\ndefeats he was lying one night on a wretched bed in a rude hut, while\ndebating in his own mind whether it were not best to enlist in a\ncrusade, when his attention was directed to a spider on the rafters\noverhead. He saw that the little spinner was trying to swing from one\nrafter to another, so as to fix his thread across the space. Time and\nagain it tried and failed. Admiring the perseverance of the creature,\nBruce began to count the number of times he tried. One, two, three,\nfour, five, six. It suddenly occurred to Bruce that this was just the\nnumber of times he had failed in his attempts against the enemy. He\nthen made up his mind that if the spider succeeded in the next trial\nhe would make one more endeavor to recover his kingdom, but if it\nfailed he would start at once for Palestine. The spider sprang into\nthe air, and this time succeeded, so the king resolved upon another\ntrial, and never after met with a defeat.",
        "9. Many a wild story is told of his feats of arms and hairbreadth\nescapes while he wandered about without a country. Sir Walter Scott,\nin his poem, “The Lord of the Isles,” records one of these legends. It\nis reported that, on one occasion, with his brother Edward and sister\nIsabel in a boat, he was driven by stress of weather to take refuge in\none of the Hebrides upon the western coast, the home of Roland, the\nLord of the Isles. It happened to be a festive occasion, a large\nassembly having met to celebrate the marriage of the Lord of the Isles\nwith the sister of the Lord of Lorn. As Bruce entered the\nbanquet-hall, Lorn recognized him:",
        "  10. “Now, by Columba’s shrine I swear,\n  And every saint that’s buried there,\n  ’Tis he himself!” Lorn sternly cries;\n  “And for my kinsman’s death he dies!\"\n  As loudly Roland calls, “Forbear!\n  Not in my sight while brand I wear,\n  O’ermatched by odds shall warrior fall,\n  Or blood of stranger stain my hall!\n  This ancient fortress of my race\n  Shall be misfortune’s resting-place,\n  Shelter or shield of the distressed,\n  No slaughter-house of shipwrecked guest!\"\n\n  11. “Talk not to me,” fierce Lorn replied,\n  “Of odds or match! When Comyn died,\n  Three daggers clashed within his side!\n  Talk not to me of sheltering hall,\n  The church of God saw Comyn fall!\n  On God’s own altar streamed his blood,\n  While o’er my prostrate kinsman stood\n  The ruthless murderer–e’en as now–\n  With armèd hand and scornful brow!\n  Up, all who love me! blow on blow,\n  And lay the outlawed felons low!”",
        "  12. Then waked the wild debate again,\n  With brawling threat and clamor vain,\n  Vassals and menials thronging in,\n  Lent their brute rage to swell the din;\n  When far and wide a bugle clang\n  From the dark, ocean upward rang.\n  “The abbot comes!” they cried at once,\n  “The holy man whose favored glance\n    Hath sainted visions known;\n  Angels have met him on the way,\n  Beside the blessed martyr’s bay,\n    And by Columba’s stone.\n  He comes our feuds to reconcile,\n  A sainted man from sainted isle;\n  We will his holy will abide,\n  The abbot shall our strife decide!\"\n\n  13. The abbot on the threshold stood,\n  And in his hands the holy rood;\n  Back on his shoulders flowed his hood,\n    The torch’s glaring ray\n  Showed, in its red and flashing light,\n  His withered cheek and amice white,\n  His blue eye glistening cold and bright,\n    His tresses scant and gray.\n  “Fair lords,” he said, “our lady’s love,\n  And peace be with you from above,\n    And benedicite!\n  But what means this? no peace is here!\n  Do dirks unsheathed suit bridal cheer?\n    Or are these naked brands\n  A seemly show for churchman’s sight,\n  When he comes summoned to unite\n    Betrothed hearts and hands?\"\n  Then, cloaking hate with fiery zeal,\n  Proud Lorn answered the appeal:\n    “Thou comest, O holy man,\n  True sons of blessed church to greet,\n  But little deeming here to meet\n    A wretch, beneath the ban\n  Of pope and church, for murder done\n  Even on the sacred altar-stone!\n  Well may’st thou wonder we should know\n  Such miscreant here, nor lay him low,\n  Or dream of greeting, peace, or truce,\n  With excommunicated Bruce!\n  Yet will I grant, to end debate,\n  Thy sainted voice decide his fate.\"\n\n  14. Then Roland pled the stranger’s cause\n  And knighthood’s oath and honor’s laws;\n  And Isabel on bended knee\n  Brought prayers and tears to back her plea;\n  And Edith lent her generous aid,\n  And wept, and Lorn for mercy prayed.\n\n  15. Then Argentine, in England’s name,\n  So highly urged his sovereign’s claim,\n  He waked a spark, that, long suppressed,\n  Had smoldered in Lord Roland’s breast;\n  And now, as from the flint the fire,\n  Flashed forth at once his generous ire.\n  “Enough of noble blood,” he said,\n  “By English Edward had been shed,\n  Since matchless Wallace first had been\n  In mockery crowned with wreaths of green,\n  And done to death by felon hand,\n  For guarding well his native land.\n  Where’s Nigel Bruce? and De la Haye,\n  And valiant Seaton–where are they?\n  Where Somerville, the kind and free?\n  And Fraser, flower of chivalry?\n  Have they not been on gibbet bound,\n  Their quarters flung to hawk and hound,\n  And hold we here a cold debate\n  To yield more victims to their fate?\n  What! can the English leopard’s mood\n  Never be gorged with Northern blood?\n  Was not the life of Athole shed\n  To soothe the tyrant’s sickened bed?\n  Nor must his word, till dying day,\n  Be  nought but quarter, hang, and slay?\"\n\n  16. “Nor deem,” said Dunnegan’s knight,\n  “That thou shalt brave alone the fight!\n  By saints of isle and mainland both,\n  By woden wild–my grandsire’s oath–\n  Let Rome and England do their worst;\n  Rowe’er attainted and accursed,\n  If Bruce shall e’er find friends again,\n  Once more to brave a battle-plain,\n  If Douglas couch again his lance,\n  Or Randolph dare another chance,\n  Old Torquil will not be to lack\n  With twice a thousand at his back;\n  Nay, chafe not at my bearing bold,\n  Good abbot! for thou knowest of old,\n  Torquil’s rude thought and stubborn will\n  Smack of the wild Norwegian still\n  Nor will I barter freedom’s cause\n  For England’s wealth or Rome’s applause!\"\n\n  17. The abbot seemed with eye severe,\n  The hardy chieftain’s speech to hear;\n  Then on King Robert turned the monk,\n  But twice his courage came and sunk,\n  Confronted with the hero’s look;\n  Twice fell his eye, his accents shook;\n  At length resolved in tone and brow,\n  Sternly he questioned him, “And thou\n  Unhappy, what hast thou to plead,\n  Why I denounce not on thy deed\n  That awful doom which canons tell\n  Shuts paradise and opens hell?\n  Anathema of power so dread,\n  It blends the living with the dead,\n  Bids each good angel soar away,\n  And every ill one claim his prey;\n  Expels thee from the church’s care,\n  And deafens Heaven against thy prayer;\n  Arms every hand against thy life,\n  Bans all who aid thee in the strife;\n  Nay, each whose succor, cold and scant,\n  With meanest alms relieves thy want;\n  Haunts thee when living; and, when dead,\n  Dwells on thy yet devoted head,\n  Rends honor’s ’scutcheon from thy hearse,\n  Stills o’er thy bier the holy verse,\n  And spurns thy corpse from hallowed ground\n  Flung like vile carrion to the hound;\n  Such is the dire and desperate doom\n  For sacrilege, decreed by Rome;\n  And such the well-deserved meed\n  Of thine unhallowed, ruthless deed.\"\n\n  18. “Abbot!” the Bruce replied, “thy charge\n  It boots me not to dispute at large;\n  This much, howe’er, I bid thee know,\n  No selfish vengeance dealt the blow,\n  For Comyn died his country’s foe.\n  Nor blame I friends whose ill-timed speed\n  Fulfilled my soon-repented deed,\n  Nor censure those from whose stern tongue\n  The dire anathema has rung.\n  I only blame my own wild ire,\n  By Scotland’s wrongs incensed to fire.\n  Heaven knows my purpose to atone,\n  Far as I may, the evil done,\n  And bears a penitent’s appeal,\n  From papal curse and prelate zeal.\n  My first and dearest task achieved,\n  Fair Scotland from her thrall relieved,\n  Shall many a priest in cope and stole\n  Say requiem for Red Comyn’s soul,\n  While I the blessèd cross advance,\n  And expiate this unhappy chance\n  In Palestine, with sword and lance.\n  But, while content the church should know\n  My conscience owns the debt I owe,\n  Unto de Argentine and Lorn\n  The name of traitor I return,\n  Bid them defiance, stern and high,\n  And give them in their throats the lie!\n  These brief words spoke, I speak no more,\n  Do as thou wilt; my shrift is o’er.\"\n\n  19. Like man by prodigy amazed,\n  Upon the king the abbot gazed;\n  Then o’er his pallid features glance\n  Convulsions of ecstatic trance.\n  His breathing came more thick and fast,\n  And from his pale-blue eyes were cast\n  Strange rays of wild and wandering light;\n  Uprise his locks of silver white,\n  Flushed is his brow, through every vein\n  In azure tides the currents strain,\n  And undistinguished accents broke\n  The awful silence e’er he spoke.\n\n  20. “De Bruce, I rose with purpose dread\n  To speak my curse upon thy head,\n  And give thee as an outcast o’er\n  To him who burns to shed thy gore;\n  But like the Midianite of old\n  Who stood on Zophin, heaven-controlled,\n  I feel within my aged breast\n  A power that can not be repressed.\n  It prompts my voice, it swells my veins,\n  It burns, it maddens, it constrains!\n  De Bruce, thy sacrilegious blow\n  Hath at God’s altar slain thy foe;\n  O’ermastered, yet by high behest,\n  I bless thee, and thou shalt be blest!\"\n  He spoke, and o’er the astonished throng\n  Was silence, awful, deep and long.\n  Again that light has fired his eye,\n  Again his form swells bold and high,\n  The broken voice of age is gone,\n  ’Tis vigorous manhood’s lofty tone\n  “Thrice vanquished on the battle-plain,\n  Thy followers slaughtered, fled, or ta’en,\n  A hunted wanderer on the wild,\n  On foreign shores a man exiled,\n  Disowned, deserted, and distressed,\n  I bless thee, and thou shalt be blessed\n  Blessed in the hall and in the field,\n  Under the mantle as the shield.\n  Avenger of thy country’s shame,\n  Restorer of her injured name,\n  Blessed in thy scepter and thy sword,\n  De Bruce, fair Scotland’s rightful lord,\n  Blessed in thy deeds and in thy fame,\n  What lengthened honors wait thy name!\n  In distant ages, sire to son\n  Shall tell the tale of freedom won,\n  And teach his infants, in the use\n  Of earliest speech, to falter Bruce.\n  Go then, triumphant! sweep along\n  Thy course, the theme of many a song!\n  The power, whose dictates swell my breast,\n  Hath blessed thee, and thou shalt be blessed!”",
        "21. With the faithful islanders Bruce remained for some months, while\nhis friends were making preparations for a rising upon the mainland.\nAt last the time came, and Bruce, at the head of a little force,\nlanded in the night and surprised and captured a castle held by the\nLord of Lorn. Holding this as a basis of operations, the king and his\nprincipal followers, Douglas and Randolph, went out in different\ndirections to arouse the people against their English oppressors, and\nto raise forces of sufficient strength to risk their cause in battle.\nThis was a matter of great hazard, as every movement of the Scotch was\nclosely watched by the enemy, and, when any one was suspected of\nopposing the English rule, he was at once imprisoned and probably\nexecuted. The patriots were obliged to move with great caution, and\noften to secrete themselves in the fastnesses of the mountains or in\nthe lonely huts of the peasants. Blood-hounds were employed to track\nthe fugitives, and it is related that Lorn at one time followed Bruce\nwith a blood-hound that had once been his own. The king, seeing that\nhe was followed by a large body of soldiers, divided his men into\nthree separate parties, hoping to throw the hound off the track. The\nblood-hound, when he came to the point of separation, would not even\nnotice the two other divisions, but followed that of the king. Finding\nhis last expedient had failed, Bruce ordered his whole party to\ndisperse, keeping with him only his foster-brother as an attendant.\nWhen Lorn discovered the party had broken up, he sent five of his men\nwho were speedy on foot to follow the king and put him to death. They\nran so fast that they soon gained sight of Bruce and his companion.\nThe two turned upon the five men of Lorn, who came up one by one,\nexhausted with running, and put them all to death.",
        "22. By this time Bruce was much fatigued, but he dared not stop to\nrest, for he could hear every moment the deep bay of the hound. At\nlength they came to a wood through which ran a small stream of water.\nInto the stream they waded and followed it for a long distance; the\nblood-hound followed the track to the water, but he could trace the\nscent no farther, and Lorn gave up the chase. But Bruce’s adventures\nwere not at an end. After resting themselves in the woods, the two set\nout to find some human habitation, or to fall in with some party of\ntheir friends. In the midst of the forest they met three men who\nlooked like ruffians. “They were well armed, and one of them bore a\nsheep on his back, which it seemed he had just stolen. They saluted\nthe king civilly, and he, replying to their salutation, asked them\nwhere they were going. The men answered that they were seeking for\nRobert Bruce, for they intended to join him. The king answered that,\nif they would go with him, he would conduct them where they could find\nthe Scottish king. Then the man who had spoken changed color, and\nBruce, who looked sharply at him, began to suspect that the ruffian\nguessed who he was, and that he and his companions had some design\nagainst his person, in order to gain the reward which had been offered\nfor his life.",
        "23. “So he said to them, ’My good friends, as we are not well\nacquainted with each other, you must go before us, and we will follow\nnear to you.’ ’You have no occasion to suspect any harm from us,’\nsaid the man. ’Neither do I suspect any,’ said Bruce, I but this is\nthe way it, which I choose to travel.’",
        "24. “The men did as he commanded, and thus they traveled till they\ncame to a waste and ruinous cottage, where the men proposed to dress\ndown part of the sheep which they were carrying. The king was glad to\nhear of food, but he insisted that two fires should be kindled, one\nfor himself and foster-brother at one end of the cottage, the other at\nthe other end for the three companions. The men did as he desired.\nThey broiled a quarter of the mutton for themselves, and gave another\nto the king and his attendant. They were obliged to eat it without\nbread or salt; but, as they were very hungry, they were glad to get\nfood in any shape, and partook of it heartily.",
        "25. “Then so heavy a drowsiness fell on King Robert that he greatly\ndesired to sleep. But, first, he desired his foster-brother to watch\nas he slept, for he had great suspicion of his new acquaintances. His\nfoster-brother promised to keep awake, and did his best to so keep his\nword. But the king had not been long asleep ere his foster-brother\nfell into a deep slumber also, for he had under-gone as much fatigue\nas the king.",
        "26. “When the three villains saw the king and his attendant were\nasleep, they made signs to each other, and, rising up, at once drew\ntheir swords with the purpose to kill them both. But the king slept\nbut lightly, and, as little noise as the traitors made in rising, he\nwas awakened by it, and, starting up, drew his sword and went to meet\nthem. At the same moment he pushed his foster-brother with his foot to\nawaken him, and he started up; but, ere he got his eyes cleared to see\nwhat was about him, one of the ruffians that were advancing to slay\nthe king killed him with the stroke of a sword. The king was now\nalone–one man against three, and in the greatest danger of his life;\nbut his amazing strength, and the good armor which he wore, freed him\nfrom this great danger, and he killed the men one by one.",
        "21. “King Robert was now alone, and he left the cottage very sorrowful\nfor the death of his foster-brother, and took himself in the direction\ntoward where he had directed his men to ensemble after their\ndispersion. It was now near night, and, the place of meeting being a\nfarm-house, he went boldly into it, where he found the mistress, an\nold true-hearted Scotchwoman, sitting alone. Upon seeing a stranger\nenter, she asked him who and what he was. The king answered that he\nwas a traveler, who was journeying through the country. ’All\ntravelers,’ answered the good woman, ’are welcome here for the sake of\none.’ ’and who is that one,’ said the king, ’for whose sake you make\nall travelers welcome?’ ’It is our lawful King Robert the Bruce,’\nanswered the mistress, ’who is the rightful lord of this country; and,\nalthough he is now pursued and hunted after with hounds and horns, I\nhope to live to see him king over all Scotland.’",
        "28. “’Since you love him so well, dame,’ said the king, ’know that you\nsee him before you. I am Robert the Bruce.’ ’You!’ said the good\nwoman in great surprise; ’and wherefore are you thus alone? Where are\nall your men?’ ’I have none with me at this moment,’ answered the\nBruce, ’and therefore I must travel alone.’ ’But that shall not be,’\nsaid the brave old dame, ’for I have two stout sons, gallant and\ntrusty men, who shall be your servants for life and death!’ So she\nbrought her sons, and, though she well knew the danger to which she\nexposed them, she made them swear fealty to the king; and they\nafterward became high officers in his service.” Now the loyal old\nwoman was getting everything ready for the king’s supper, when\nsuddenly there was a trampling of horse heard around the house. They\nthought it must be some of the English or John of Lorn’s men, and the\ngood wife called upon her sons to fight to the last for King Robert.\nBut, shortly after, the voices of James of Douglas and of Edward\nBrute, the king’s brother, were heard, who had come with a hundred and\nfifty horsemen to this farm-house, according to the instructions of\nthe king when they parted.",
        "“Robert the Bruce was right joyful to meet his brother and faithful\nfriend Lord James, and had no sooner found himself at the head of such\na considerable body of followers, than, forgetting hunger and\nweariness he began to inquire where the enemy who had pursued him so\nlong had taken up their quarters; ’for,’ said he, ’as they must\nsuppose we are totally scattered and fled, it is likely they will\nthink themselves quite secure, and disperse themselves into distant\nquarters, and keep careless watch.’",
        "“’That is very true,’ answered James of Douglas; ’for I passed a\nvillage where there are two hundred of them quartered who had placed\nno sentinels; and, if you have a mind to make haste, we may surprise\nthem this very night.’ Then there was nothing but mount and ride;\nand, as the Scots came by surprise on the body of the English whom\nDouglas had mentioned, and rushed suddenly into the village where they\nwere quartered, they easily dispersed and cut them to pieces; thus\ndoing their pursuers more injury than they themselves had received\nduring the long and severe pursuit of the preceding day.”",
        "On another occasion Bruce, with sixty men, was wandering in the county\nof Galloway, awaiting the gathering of forces. Now the people of\nGalloway are mostly friendly to the Lord of Lorn, and a large number\nof them collected, determined to capture him. They felt sure of the\nsuccess of their enterprise, as they had a blood-hound to track the\nking, and had such superior numbers.",
        "33. “Now Bruce, who was always watchful and vigilant, had received\nsome information of this party to come upon him suddenly in the night.\nAccordingly, he quartered his party of sixty men on the farther side\nof a deep and swift-running river, that had very steep and rocky\nbanks. There was but one ford by which this river could be crossed in\nthe neighborhood, and that ford was deep and narrow, so that two men\ncould scarcely get through abreast; the bank on which they were to\nland on the other side was steep, and the path that led upward from\nthe water’s edge extremely narrow and difficult.",
        "34. “Bruce caused his men to lie down and sleep, at a place about half\na mile distant from the river, while he, with two attendants, went\ndown to watch the ford, and thinking how easy the enemy might be kept\nfrom passing there, providing it was bravely defended–when he heard\nthe distant baying of a hound, which was always coming nearer and\nnearer. This was the blood-hound which was tracing the king’s steps to\nthe ford where he had crossed, and the two hundred Galloway men were\nalong with the animal and guided by it. Bruce thought of going back to\nawaken his men; but then he thought it might be some shepherd’s dog.\n’My men,’ said he, ’are sorely tired; I will not disturb them by the\nbarking of a cur till I know something more of the matter.’",
        "35. “So he stood and listened; and, by and by, as the cry of the hound\ncame nearer, he began to hear the trampling of horses, and the voices\nof men, and the ringing and clattering of armor; and then he was sure\nthe enemy were coming to the river-side. Then the king thought, ’If I\ngo back to give my men the alarm, these Galloway men will get through\nthe ford without opposition, and that would be a pity, since it is a\nplace so advantageous to make a defense against them.’ So he looked\nagain at the steep path and the deep river, and he thought it gave him\nso much advantage that he could defend the passage with his own hand\nuntil his men came to assist him. His armor was so good and strong\nthat he had no fears of their arrows, and therefore the combat was not\nso very unequal as it must have otherwise seemed. He therefore sent\nhis followers to waken his men, and remained alone on the bank of the\nriver.",
        "36. “In the meanwhile the noise and the trampling of the horses\nincreased, and, the moon being bright, Bruce saw the glancing arms of\nabout two hundred men, who came down to the opposite bank of the\nriver. The men of Galloway, on their part, saw but one solitary figure\nguarding the ford, and the foremost of them plunged into the river\nwithout minding him. Bruce, who stood high above them on the bank\nwhere they were to land, killed the foremost man with a thrust of his\nlong spear, and with a second thrust stabbed the horse, which fell\ndown, kicking and plunging in his agonies, on the narrow path, and so\npreventing the others from getting out of the river. In the confusion\nfive or six of the enemy were slain, or, having been borne down the\ncurrent, were drowned in the river. The rest were terrified, and drew\nback.",
        "37. “But, when they looked again and saw only one man, they themselves\nbeing so many, they cried out that their honor would be lost forever\nif they did not force their way; and encouraged each other with loud\ncries to plunge in and assault him. But by this time the king’s\nsoldiers came up to his assistance, and the Galloway men retreated and\ngave up their enterprise.”",
        "38. These successes of Bruce inspired great confidence, and he soon\nfound himself at the head of a formidable force. With this he marched\nup and down the country, and compelled the English to keep strictly\nwithin their castles and fortified places; and even several of these\nwere captured. King Edward I, of England, heard of these successes of\nBruce with astonishment and rage. Though old and sorely diseased, he\nraised a large army and marched for the north; but he had scarcely\ncrossed the Scottish border when his physician informed him that he\nhad but a few hours to live. He immediately called his son to his\nbed-side, and made him swear that he would push forward this\nexpedition against the Bruce; and he died cursing the whole Scotch\npeople. He even gave direction that his body should be boiled, and\nthat his bones, wrapped in a bull’s hide, should be carried at the\nhead of the army as often as the Scots attempted to recover their\nfreedom.",
        "39. Edward II was a weak prince, neither so wise nor so brave as his\nfather. He marched a little way on to Scotland, but, having no great\nliking for war, he turned and marched back into England. He\ndisregarded his father’s injunction about the disposition of his\nbones, but took them back to London, and deposited them in Westminster\nAbbey.",
        "40. From this time the cause of Bruce was a succession of victories.\nDuring the winter and spring one English fortress after another\nsurrendered, until there only remained the strong castle of Stirling\nheld by the English power. This castle was besieged, and Sir Philip\nMowbray, the commander, agreed to surrender it if it was not\nreinforced by the English before midsummer. Then came a cessation of\nhostilities, and a period of rest for the Scots. King Edward had made\nno arrangement to again interfere in Scottish affairs. But now, when\nSir Philip Mowbray, the governor of Stirling, came to London to tell\nthe king that Stirling, the last Scottish town of importance which\nremained in possession of the English, was to be surrendered if it\nwere not relieved by force of arms before midsummer, then all the\nEnglish nobles called out, it would be a sin and shame to permit the\nfair conquest which Edward I had made to be forfeited to the Scots for\nwant of fighting. It was, therefore, resolved that the king should go\nhimself to Scotland with as great forces as he could possibly muster.",
        "41. King Edward II, therefore, assembled one of the greatest armies\nwhich a king of England ever commanded. There were troops brought from\nall his dominions. Many brave soldiers from the French provinces which\nthe king of England enjoyed in France; many Irish, many Welsh, and all\nthe great English nobles and barons, with their followers, were\nassembled in one great army. The number was not less than one hundred\nthousand men.",
        "42. King Robert the Bruce summoned all his nobles and barons to join\nhim, when he heard of the great preparation which the king of England\nwas making. They were not so numerous as the English by many thousand\nmen. In fact, his whole army did not very much exceed thirty thousand\nmen, and they were much worse armed than the wealthy Englishmen; but\nthen Robert, who was at their head, was one of the most expert\ngenerals of the time, and the officers he had under him were his\nbrother Edward, his nephew Randolph, his faithful follower the\nDouglas, and other brave and experienced leaders, who commanded the\nsame men that had been accustomed to fight and gain victories under\nevery disadvantage of situation and numbers.",
        "43. The king, on his part, studied how he might supply, by address and\nstratagem, what he wanted in numbers and strength. He knew the\nsuperiority of the English both in their heavy-armed cavalry, which\nwere much better mounted and armed than those of the Scots, and in the\narchery, in which art the English were better than any people in the\nworld. Both these advantages he resolved to provide against. With this\npurpose, Bruce led his army down into a plain, near Stirling, called\nthe Park, near which, and beneath it, the English army must needs pass\nthrough a boggy country, broken with water-courses, while the Scots\noccupied hard, dry ground. He then caused all the hard ground upon the\nfront of his line of battle, where cavalry were likely to act, to be\ndug full of holes, about as deep as a man’s knee. They were filled\nwith light brushwood, and the turf was laid on the top, so that it\nappeared a plain field, while in reality it was all as full of these\npits as a honeycomb is of holes. He also, it is said, caused steel\nspikes, called calthrops, to be scattered up and down in the plain,\nwhere the English cavalry were most likely to advance, trusting to\nlame and destroy their horses.",
        "44. When his army was drawn, the line stretched north and south. On\nthe south it was terminated by the banks of the brook called\nBannockburn, which are so rocky that no troops could come on them\nthere. On the left the Scottish line extended near to the town of\nStirling. Bruce reviewed his troops very carefully; all the useless\nservants and drivers of carts, and such like, of whom there were very\nmany, he ordered to go behind a height called the Gillies’ Hill–that\nis, the Servants’ Hill. He then spoke to the soldiers, and expressed\nhis determination to gain the victory or to lose his life on the field\nof battle. He desired that all those who did not propose to fight to\nthe last would leave the field before the battle began, and that none\nwould remain except those who were determined to take the issue of\nvictory or death, as God should send it.",
        "45. Burns has expressed Bruce’s sentiments in his fiery poem.",
        "  46. Scots who have with Wallace bled,\n  Scots whom Bruce has often led,\n  Welcome to your gory bed\n    Or to victory!\n  Now’s the day, and now’s the hour;\n  See the front of battle lower;\n  See approach proud Edward’s power,\n    Chains, and slavery!\n\n  47. Who would be a traitor knave,\n  Who would fill a coward’s grave,\n  Who so base as be a slave,\n    Let him turn and flee!\n  Who for Scotland’s king and law,\n  Freedom’s sword will strongly draw,\n  Freeman stand, or freeman fa’,\n    Let him follow me!\n\n  48. By oppressions, woes, and pains,\n  By our sons in servile chains,\n  We will drain our dearest veins,\n    But they shall be free!\n  Lay the proud usurper low\n  Tyrants fall in every foe–\n  Liberty at every blow;\n    Let us do or die!",
        "49. When the main body of his army was thus placed in order, the king\nposted Randolph, with a body of horse, near to the church of St.\nMirau’s, commanding him to use the utmost diligence to prevent any\nsuccorers from being thrown into Stirling Castle. He then dismissed\nJames of Douglas and Sir Robert Keith, the marshal of the Scottish\narmy, in order that they might survey, as nearly as they could, the\nEnglish force, which was now approaching from Falkirk. They returned\nwith information that the approach of that vast host was one of the\nmost beautiful and terrible sights which could be seen; that the whole\ncountry seemed covered with men-at-arms on horse and foot; that the\nnumber of standard banners and pennants made so gallant a show, that\nthe bravest and most numerous host in Christendom might be alarmed to\nsee King Edward moving against them.",
        "50. It was upon the 23d of June, 1314, that the King of Scotland heard\nthe news that the English army were approaching Stirling. He drew out\nhis army, therefore, in the order which he had before resolved upon.\nAfter a short time, Bruce, who was looking out anxiously for the\nenemy, saw a body of English cavalry trying to get into Stirling from\nthe eastward. This was the Lord Clifford, who, with a chosen body of\neight hundred horse, had been detached to relieve the castle.",
        "51. “See, Randolph,” said the king to his nephew, “there is a rose\nfallen from your chaplet.” By this be meant that Randolph has lost\nsome honor by suffering the enemy to pass where he had been commanded\nto follow them. Randolph made no reply, but rushed against Clifford\nwith little more than half his number. The Scots were on foot. The\nEnglish turned to charge them with their lances, and Randolph drew up\nhis men in close order to receive them. He seemed to be in so much\ndanger that Douglas asked leave of the king to go and assist him. The\nking refused permission.",
        "52. “Let Randolph,” he said, “redeem his own fault. I can not break\nthe order of battle for his sake.” Still the danger appeared greater,\nand the English horse seemed entirely to encompass the small handful\nof Scottish infantry. “To please you,” said Douglas to the king, “my\nheart will not suffer me to stand idle and see Randolph perish. I must\ngo to his assistance.” He rode off accordingly, but long before they\nhad reached the place of combat they saw the English horses galloping\noff, many with their empty saddles.",
        "53. “Halt!” said Douglas to his men. “Randolph has gained the day.\nSince we were not soon enough to help him in the battle, do not let us\nlessen his glory by approaching the field.” Now, that was nobly done,\nespecially as Douglas and Randolph were always contending which should\nrise highest in the good opinion of the king and the nation.",
        "54. The van of the English army now came in sight, and a number of\ntheir bravest knights drew near to see what the Scottish were doing.\nThey saw King Robert dressed in his armor, and distinguished by a gold\ncrown which he wore over his helmet. He was not mounted on his great\nwar horse, because he did not expect to fight that evening. But he\nrode on a little pony up and down the ranks of his army, putting his\nmen in order, and carried in his hand a short battle-axe made of\nsteel. When the king saw the English horsemen draw near, he advanced a\nlittle before his own men, that he might look at them more nearly.",
        "55. There was a knight among the English called Sir Henry de Bohun,\nwho thought this would be a good opportunity to gain great fame to\nhimself and put an end to the war by killing King Robert. The king\nbeing poorly mounted, and having no lance, Bohun galloped on him\nsuddenly and furiously, thinking, with his long spear and his big\nstrong horse, easily to bear him down to the ground. King Robert saw\nhim and permitted him to come very near, then suddenly turned his pony\na little to one side, so that Sir Henry missed him with the lance\npoint, and was in the act of being carried past him by the career of\nhis horse. But as he passed, King Robert rose up in his stirrups and\nstruck Sir Henry on the head with his battle-axe so terrible a blow\nthat it broke to pieces his iron helmet, as if it had been a\nnut-shell, and hurled him from his saddle. He was dead before he\nreached the ground. This gallant action was blamed by the Scottish\nleaders, who thought Bruce ought not to have exposed himself to so\nmuch danger when the safety of the whole army depended on him. The\nking only kept looking at his weapon, which was injured by the force\nof the blow, and said, “I have broken my good battle-axe.” This is\nthe way Scott describes this incident in the “Lord of the Isles”:",
        "  56. O gay yet fearful to behold,\n  Flashing with steel and rough with gold,\n    And bristled o’er with balls and spears,\n  With plumes and pennons waving fair,\n  Was that bright battle front! for there\n    Rode England’s king and peers.\n\n  57. And who that saw that monarch ride,\n  His kingdom battling by his side,\n  Could then his direful doom foretell;\n  Fair was his seat in knightly selle,\n  And in his sprightly eye was set\n  Some sparks of the Plantagenet.\n  Though bright and wandering was his glance,\n  It flashed at sight of shield and lance.\n  “Knowest thou,” he said, “De Argentine,\n  Yon knight who marshals thus their line?\"\n\n  58. “The tokens on his helmet tell\n  The Bruce, my liege; I know him well.\"\n  “And shall the audacious traitor brave\n  The presence where our banners wave?\"\n  “So please my liege,” said Argentine,\n  “Were he but horsed on steed like mine,\n  To give him fair and knightly chance,\n  I would adventure forth my lance.\"\n\n  59. “In battle-day,” the king replied,\n  “Nice tourne rules are set aside;\n  Still must the rebel dare our wrath!\n  Set on him–sweep him from our path!\"\n  And, at King Edward’s signal, soon\n  Dashed from the ranks Sir Edward Bohun!\n\n  60. Of Hereford’s high blood he came,\n  A race renowned for knightly fame;\n  He burned before his monarch’s eye\n  To do some deed of chivalry.\n  He spurred his steed, he couched his lance,\n  And darted on the Bruce at once.\n  As motionless as rocks, that bide\n  The wrath of the advancing tide,\n  The Bruce stood fast; each breast beat high,\n  And dazzled was each gazing eye;\n  The heart had hardly time to think,\n  The eyelid scarce had time to wink,\n  While on the king, like flash of flame,\n  Spurred to full speed, the war-horse came!\n  The partridge may the falcon mock,\n  If that slight palfrey stand the shock;\n  But, swerving from the knight’s career,\n  Just as they met, Bruce shunned the spear;\n  Onward the baffled warrior bore\n  His course–but soon his course was o’er!\n  High in his stirrups stood the king,\n  And gave his battle-axe the swing.\n  Right on De Bohun, the whiles he passed,\n  Fell that stern dint–the first–the last!\n  Such strength upon the blow was put,\n  The helmet crushed like hazel-nut,\n  The axe-shaft, with its brazen clasp,\n  Was shivered to the gauntlet grasp.\n  Springs from the blow the startled horse,\n  Drops on the plain the lifeless corse;\n  First of that fatal field, how soon,\n  How sudden fell the fierce De Bohun!\n\n  61. One pitying glance the monarch shed\n  Where on the field his foe lay dead;\n  Then gently turned his palfrey’s head,\n  And, pacing back his sober way,\n  Slowly he gained his own array.\n  There round their king the leaders crowd\n  And blame his recklessness aloud,\n  That risked ’gainst each adventurous spear\n  A life so valued and so dear.\n  His broken weapon’s shaft surveyed\n  The king, and careless answer made\n  “My loss must pay my folly’s tax–\n  I’ve broke my trusty battle-axe”",
        "62. The next morning, being the 24th of June, at break of day the\nbattle began in terrible earnest. The English as they advanced saw the\nScots getting into lines. The Abbot of Inchaffray walked through their\nranks barefooted, and exhorted them to fight for their freedom. They\nkneeled down as he passed, and prayed to heaven for victory. King\nEdward, who saw this, called out: “They kneel down; they are asking\nforgiveness.” “Yes,” said a celebrated English baron, called Ingelram\nde Umphraville, “but they ask it from God, not from us; these men will\nconquer, or die upon the field.” The English king ordered his men to\nbegin the battle. The archers then bent their bows, and began to shoot\nso closely together that the arrows fell like flakes of snow on a\nChristmas-day.",
        "    63. Upon the right, behind the wood,\n    Each by his steed, dismounted, stood\n      The Scottish chivalry;\n    With foot in stirrup, hand on mane,\n    Fierce Edward Bruce can scarce restrain\n    His own keen heart, his eager train,\n    Until the archers gain the plain;\n    Then “Mount ye gallants free!\"\n    He cried; and, vaulting from the ground,\n    His saddle every horseman found.\n    On high their glittering crests they toss,\n    As springs the wild-fire from the moss;\n    The shield hangs down on every breast,\n    Each ready lance is in the rest,\n      And loud shouts Edward Bruce:\n    “Forth, marshal! on the peasant foe\n    We’ll tame the terrors of their bow,\n      And cut the bow-string loose!\"\n\n  64. Then spurs were dashed in chargers’ flanks,\n  They rushed among the archer ranks.\n  No spears were there the shock to let,\n  No stakes to turn the charge were set,\n  And bow shall yeoman’s armor slight,\n  Stand the long lance and mace of might?\n  Or what may their short swords avail,\n  ’Gainst barbed horse and shirt of mail?\n  Amid their ranks the chargers spring,\n  High o’er their heads the weapons swing,\n  And shriek and groan and vengeful shout\n  Give note of triumph and of rout!\n  Awhile, with stubborn hardihood,\n  Their English hearts the strife made good;\n  Borne down at length on every side,\n  Compelled to flight, they scatter wide.\n  Let stags of Sherwood leap for glee,\n  And bound the deer of Dallorn-Lee!\n  The broken bows of Bannock’s shore\n  Shall in the greenwood ring no more!\n  Round Wakefield’s merry May-pole now,\n  The maids may twine the summer bough,\n  May northward look with longing glance\n  For those that went to lead the dance,\n  For the blithe archers look in vain!\n  Broken, dispersed, in flight o’erta’en,\n  Pierced through, trod down, by thousands slain,\n  They cumber Bannock’s bloody plain!",
        "65. The fine English cavalry then advanced to support their archers,\nand to attack the Scottish line. But coming over the ground which was\ndug full of pits the horses fell into these holes, and the riders lay\ntumbling about, without any means of defense, and unable to rise, from\nthe weight of their armor. The Englishmen began to fall into general\ndisorder; and the Scottish king, bringing up more of his forces,\nattacked and pressed them still more closely.",
        "66. On a sudden an event happened which decided the victory. The\nservants and attendants on the Scottish camp bad been sent behind the\narmy to a place called Gillies’ Hill; but now, when they saw that\ntheir masters were like to gain the day, they rushed from their place\nof concealment with such weapons as they could get, that they might\nhave their share in the victory and in the spoil. The English, seeing\nthem come suddenly over the hill, mistook the disorderly rabble for a\nnew army coming up to sustain the Scots; and, losing all heart, began\nto shift every man for himself. Edward himself left the field as fast\nas he could ride, and was closely pursued by Douglas, with a party of\nhorse, who followed him as far as Dunbar, where the English had still\na friend in the governor, Patrick, Earl of Mans. The earl received\nEdward in his forlorn condition, and furnished him with a fishing\nskiff, or small ship, in which he escaped to England, having entirely\nlost his fine army, and a great number of his bravest nobles.",
        "67. The English never before or afterward lost so dreadful a battle as\nthat of Bannockburn, nor did the Scots ever gain one of the same\nimportance. Many of the best and bravest of the English nobility and\ngentry lay dead on the field; a great many more were made prisoners,\nand the whole of King Edward’s immense army was dispersed or\ndestroyed.",
        "68. Thus did Robert Bruce arise from the condition of an exile, hunted\nwith blood-bounds like a stag or beast of prey, to the rank of an\nindependent sovereign, universally acknowledged to be one of the\nwisest and bravest kings who then lived. The nation of Scotland was\nalso raised once more from the state of a distressed and conquered\nprovince to that of a free and independent state, governed by its own\nlaws, and subject to its own princes; and although the country was,\nafter the Bruce’s death, often subjected to great loss and distress,\nboth by the hostility of the English and by the unhappy civil wars\namong the Scots themselves, yet they never afterward lost the freedom\nfor which Wallace had laid down his life, and which King Robert had\nrecovered no less by his wisdom than by his weapons. And therefore\nmost just it is that, while the country of Scotland retains any\nrecollection of its history, the memory of these brave warriors and\nfaithful patriots ought to be remembered with honor and gratitude.",
        "69. In 1328, fourteen years after the battle of Bannockburn, peace was\nconcluded between England and Scotland, in which the English\nsurrendered all pretension to the Scottish crown. King Robert was now\nfifty-four years old, and he prepared to enter upon a crusade in\naccordance with his vow, and in expiation of his offense of slaying\nthe Red Comyn. But, being smitten with a fatal disease, he directed\nLord James, of Douglas, upon his death, to take his heart and carry it\nto Palestine, in fulfillment of his vow. Douglas accepted the sacred\ntrust, and encased the heart in silver, and hung it about his neck. On\nhis way to the Holy Land he turned aside to help the Spaniard in a\ncampaign against the Moors. In one battle, being sorely beset, he\nflung the heart of Bruce into the midst of the enemy, and followed it\nup with the war-cry of the Douglas, which had so often cheered to\nvictory among his native hills. At every step a Moslem bit the dust\nuntil he reached the spot where his master’s heart had fallen. Here he\nwas slain by the numbers which pressed in on every side, and he was\nfound with his body still in the attitude of guarding the heart. The\nbody of Lord James, together with the heart, were returned to Scotland\nThe precious relic–the last that remained of the Bruce, the greatest\nof Scottish kings–was deposited in Melrose Abbey, where it remains\nto-day a sacred shrine for every Scotchman, and for every lover of\nliberty. Rarely in the history of man has the prediction of the old\nabbot been so literally fulfilled:",
        "“I bless thee, and thou shalt be blest!”",
        "1. Columbus lived in a stirring age. Everywhere light was breaking in\nafter centuries of darkness, and all Europe was restless with\nsuggestions and beginnings of new life. Great men were plenty; rulers,\nlike the Medici of Florence; artists, like Raphael and Angelo;\npreachers, like Savonarola, whose fiery prophecies brought him to\nfiery death; reformers, chief among diem Luther, just beginning to\nthink the thoughts that later set the world agog. Great inventions\nwere spreading; gun-powder, invented before, now becoming terribly\neffective through the improvement in guns; printing, suddenly opening\nknowledge to every class; the little compass, with which mariners were\njust beginning to trust themselves boldly on the seas, in spite of the\npopular impression that it was a sort of infernal machine presided\nover by the devil himself.",
        "2. And to this age had been bequeathed the fascinating stories of Sir\nJohn Mandeville and Marco Polo, stories to make every boy crazy to be\noff to seek his fortune. From their travels in Asia these men had\nbrought back the most remarkable accounts of the eastern lands. A\ncountry was there, they said, called Cathay, bordering on the sea. It\nwas ruled by an emperor, the Kubla Khan, or Great Khan, who lighted\nhis bedroom with a bright jewel half a foot long, set upon golden\npillars, and decorated his walls with wrought gold and hundreds of\nprecious stones. The rivers of the land were crossed by marble\nbridges, and the houses were roofed and paved with gold. The seas were\nfull of islands where spices grew and countless strange creatures\nlived: one-eyed men; men with a lip long enough to cover their whole\nface; men with only one foot, but that so large that they held it over\nthem like an umbrella when they lay down in the sun to rest;\ntwo-headed men and men with no heads at all; men whose only food was\nsnakes, and others whose favorite beverage was human blood; dragons\nand unicorns; woolly hens and sheep that grew on trees; and in one\nisland a valley where only devils dwelt. But there were besides great\nhills of gold, cities with towers of silver and gold, precious stones\nof all kinds, and rose-tinted pearls, big and round.",
        "3. There was trade between Europe and certain parts of Asia which they\ncalled the Indies, and reached by going east and south by land; but\nthis marvelous country of the Grand Khan lay beyond, and its riches\nremained a golden dream, known only by the travelers’ reports. That\nwas what was known of Asia. Of Africa, even less; for, fifty years\nbefore Columbus was born, only a strip across the northern part of it\nwas known, and south of that lay “nothing,” said the people. And of\nAmerica, our wide-stretching America, they never dreamed.",
        "4. Some fifty years before the birth of Columbus, Prince Henry of\nPortugal, studying the matter, came to the conclusion that the world\ndid not necessarily end at “Cape Nothing,” on the African coast, as\npeople said, but perhaps extended a long way farther; and, having an\nabundance of time and money, he began to send out ships to sail along\nbeyond the cape and see what they could find. And they found a long,\nlong coast. Year after year, until the prince was a gray-haired old\nman, he sent out vessel after vessel; and, though often storm-driven\nand wrecked, and unsuccessful, they many times came back with accounts\nof new discoveries. One by one they brought the numerous islands lying\noff the northwest coast of Africa to the notice of the people of\nEurope. And after they once got past that mysterious “Cape Nothing,\"\nthey sailed along the coast, going farther and farther on successive\nvoyages, until, in 1487, long after Prince Henry’s death, and just\nbefore Columbus’s great voyage, the most southern point was rounded,\nthe African continent was known, and the long-sought water-way to the\nIndies was established.",
        "5. As to the date of Columbus’s birth, historians can not agree within\nsome ten years. It was doubtless some where between 1435 and 1446.\nThey also give different accounts as to his birthplace; but it seems\nmost probable that he was born in Genoa, on the Mediterranean, the son\nof a wool-carder, and that he went to school in Pavia. At fourteen he\nbecame a sailor.",
        "6. Up and down the seas, first in the sunny Mediterranean, later along\nthe stormy Atlantic coast, sailed the lad, the young man, in the small\nsailing vessels of the time, and learned well the ocean which he\nafterward so boldly trusted.",
        "7. He was a daring, quick-witted, handsome, bronzed young man when he\nwent to Lisbon, where his brother Bartholomew was established as a\ncosmographer, making charts for seamen; and with all his enthusiasm\nfor his sea-faring life, he had enough interest in ordinary pursuits\nto fall in love most romantically. It happened on account of his being\nso regular at church. Every day he must attend service, and every day\nto church came Donna Philippa Palestrello, who lived in a convent near\nby. Across the seats flitted involuntary glances between the\ncloistered maiden and the handsome brown sailor–with a dimple in his\nchin, some pictures have him; something besides prayers were read\nbetween the lines of the prayer-book, and the marriage which closed\nthis churchly wooing proved the wisdom of both parties.",
        "8. Philippa’s father had been one of Prince Henry’s famous seamen and\nthe governor of Porto Santo, one of the new-found islands; and after\nhis marriage, Columbus lived sometimes at Porto Santo, sometimes at\nLisbon, and much of the time on the sea. He sailed south along the\nAfrican coast to Guinea; north he sailed to England, and farther on to\nIceland. Wherever ships could go, there went he, intent on learning\nall there was to know of the world he lived in. He read eagerly all\nthat was written about the earth’s shape and size. The modern science\nof his time he well understood. He pored over the maps of the ancient\ngeographer Ptolemy, over the maps of Cosmas, a later geographer, over\nPalestrello’s charts, given him by Philippa’s mother.",
        "9. Ptolemy said the world is round, but Cosmas, whom good Christians\nwere bound to believe, since he founded his science on the Bible, said\nit is flat, with a wall around it to hold up the sky–very probable,\ncertainly. But that notion of the ancients that the world is “round\nlike a ball” had been caught up and believed by a handful of men\nscattered sparsely down through the centuries, and of late lead\ngained, among advanced scientists, more of a following than ever. And\nColumbus, who, with all his enthusiasm for adventure and his reverence\nfor religion and he church, had a clear, unbiased, scientific head,\nmentally turned his back upon Cosmas, and clasped hands with the\nancients and the wisest scientists of his own day.",
        "10. The north was known, the south was fast becoming so, the east had\nbeen penetrated, but the west was unexplored. Stretching along from\nThule, the distant Iceland, to the southern part of the great African\ncontinent, thousands of miles, lay the “Sea of Darkness,” as the\npeople called it. What lay beyond? The question had been asked before,\ntimes enough; times enough answered for any reasonable man. “Hell was\nthere,” said one superstition, “Haven’t you seen the flames at\nsunset-time?” “A sea thick like paste, in which no ships can sail,\"\nsaid another. “Darkness,” said another, “thick darkness, the blackness\nof nothing, and the end of all created things!”",
        "11. There was a legend that over there beyond was Paradise, and St.\nBrandan, wandering about the seas, had reached it. The ancients told\nof an island Atlantis over there somewhere in the West, and one of\nthem had said: “In the last days an age will come when ocean shall\nloose the chains of things; a wonderful country will be discovered,\nand Tiphis shall make known new worlds, nor shall Thule be the end of\nthe earth.”",
        "12. Ah, to be the discoverer of Atlantis or Paradise! “But, if the\nworld is round,” said Columbus, “it is not hell that lies beyond that\nstormy sea. Over there must lie the eastern strand of Asia, the Cathay\nof Marco Polo, the land of the Kubla Khan, and Cipango, the great\nisland beyond it.” “Nonsense!” said the neighbors; “the world isn’t\nround–can’t you see it is flat? And Cosmas Indicopleustes, who lived\nhundreds of years before you were born, says it is flat; and he got it\nfrom the Bible. You’re no good Christian to be taking up with such\nheathenish notions!” Thought Columbus, “I will write to Paolo\nToscanelli, at Florence, and see what be will say.”",
        "13. So Columbus wrote, and Toscanelli, the wise scientist, answered\nthat the idea of sailing west was good and feasible; and with the\nletter came a map, on which Asia and the great island Cipango were\nlaid down opposite Europe, with the Atlantic between, exactly as\nColumbus imagined it. Toscanelli said it was easy enough: “You may be\ncertain of meeting with extensive kingdoms, populous cities, and rich\nprovinces, abounding in all sorts of precious stones; and your visit\nwill cause great rejoicing to the king and princes of those distant\nlands, besides opening a way for communication between them and the\nChristians, and the instruction of them in the Catholic religion and\nthe arts we possess.” It was 1474 when this encouragement came, and\nfrom this time all the sailor’s thoughts and plans turned toward the\nwest.",
        "14. The life at home between his voyages, whether spent with his\nbrother, the cosmographer, at Lisbon, or with his wife and sailor\nbrother-in-law, on the Porto Santo island, was hardly less nautical\nthan the voyages themselves. Porto Santo was in line with the\nship-routes to and from Spain and all the new-found African coast and\nislands; and the family there, with the men sailors and geographers,\nand the women, wives and daughters of sailors and geographers, lived\nin the bracing salt sea-air, full of the tingle of adventure.",
        "15. Wild stories tell the sailors, coming and going, whom one can\nscarce contradict for lack of certain knowledge; and is it not an age\nof wonders in real life? And the round earth, the round earth–is it\nround? And the empire of the Grand Khan just over the western water\nthere–not far! The sailors said that on the shores of one of the\nislands two dead men of strange appearance had been washed in from the\nwest. The sailors said they had picked up curiously-carved sticks\ndrifting from the west. Pedro Correa himself, Columbus’s\nbrother-in-law, and a man to be trusted, had found one floating from\nthe west. And there was a legend of the sight of land lying like a\nfaint cloud along that western horizon.",
        "16. “The world is round,” said Columbus. “It is not very large” (he\nthought it much smaller than it is), “and opposite us across that sea\nlies Asia; and to Asia by way of that sea I will go. There, in the\nwest, lies my duty to God and man; I will carry salvation to the\nheathen, and bring back gold for the Christians. From the ’Occident to\nthe Orient’ a path I will find through the waters.”",
        "17. Such a venture as Columbus proposed could scarcely be carried out\nat that time except by the help of kings, so to the kings went\nColumbus.",
        "18. Naturally, Portugal, with her proved interest in discovery, came\nfirst in his thought; and before Portugal’s king he laid his project.\nThe king should fit him out with vessels and men, and with them\nColumbus would sail to the Indies, not by the route around Africa,\nwhich the Portuguese had so long been seeking, but by a nearer\nway–straight across the Atlantic. Think of the untold wealth from the\nempire of the khan rolling in to Portugal if this connection could be\nestablished! And think of converting those heathen to our blessed\nmother church! It was worth thinking about, and the king called a\ncouncil of his wise men to consider the startling idea. Not long were\nthe wise men in wisely deciding that the plan was the wild scheme of\nan adventurer, likely to come to no good whatever; and when the king,\nhardly satisfied, laid it before another council, they, too, wisely\ndeclared it ridiculous.",
        "19. O ye owlish dignitaries! Still, the king was not convinced. “We\nhave discovered much by daring adventure, why not more?” “Stick to the\ncoast, and don’t go sailing straight away from all known land into\nwaters unknown and mysterious,” said the wise men. “But if the unknown\nwaters bring us to the riches of Cathay?” said the king. “That’s the\nextravagant dream of a visionary; it contains no truth and much\ndanger,” said the wise men. “Try it yourself, and see. Unbeknown to\nthis Columbus, just send out a ship of your own to the west, and let\nthem come back and tell us what they find.”",
        "20. It was a most underhand piece of business all around; but the king\nyielded and sent out a ship, which presently came back again with the\nreport that there was no Cathay there, and they hadn’t found any\nCipango; it was all nonsense! And what they had met with was a big\nstorm that scared them terribly. So Columbus retired, and left the\nking of Portugal to his brave sailors and wise councilors.",
        "21. Next will come Spain, and meantime he will send his brother\nBartholomew to present the plan at the English court.",
        "22. The Spanish sovereigns, Ferdinand and Isabella, were down in\nAndalusia, that beautiful southern province of Spain, in the midst of\na war with the Moors, who occupied certain portions of the land, and\nwhom the Spaniards were trying to drive out. So, his wife being now\ndead, Columbus took his little boy Diego, and to Andalusia they went.\nThey stopped at Palos by the sea, and from there set out on foot. The\nway was long, and Diego could not go far without getting very thirsty;\nand his father stopping at a great, dark, stone convent, called Maria\nde la Rabida, to get him a drink, the prior asked them in to rest a\nbit. As they talked, Columbus soon told of his great project, to sail\nto the Indies by way of the western sea.",
        "23. The prior, in his long dark robe and shaved head, opened his eyes\nat this and wanted to hear more. “Novel project this,” thought he;\n\"very novel-most astonishing I must have my friend, Dr. Fernandez,\nhear it.” So a messenger was sent to Palos to fetch the doctor, and\nColumbus went over again the wonderful plan–just to sail west, not so\nvery far, over the round earth, and reach the stately cities of\nCathay, and convert the Grand Khan to the faith, and gather of the\nplentiful gold and jewels of that land. Little Diego stood by and\nlistened with wide-open eyes, and the doctor pondered, while the prior\ngazed out from the western window upon the Atlantic, and Columbus bent\neager eyes and flushed face over his chart.",
        "21. “Why, it may be possible! Send for Martin Alonzo Pinzon. He is a\nseaman; let us see what he thinks!”",
        "25. To Palos again goes the messenger, to the rich and influential\ncitizen, Alonzo Pinzon, and tells him he is wanted at La Pabida. “Ah,\nAlonzo Pinzon!” greets him–the prior, “come and hear what a man\nproposes to do; and a wise and courageous sailor he seems, though poor\nenough!” And a third time they bend over the charts there in the dark\nstone convent, and Alonzo Pinzon hears of the western route to India;\nand Diego gazes from one to the other, and hopes in his heart that his\nfather will take him along–he wants to see the unicorns. Pinzon\ncatches the idea with enthusiasm, promising to help Columbus with\nmoney and influence, and to go with him if he goes. The doctor,\ncogitating upon the statements and arguments, concludes that they make\nquite a reasonable showing, and advises Columbus to go on.",
        "26. The prior says: “Go at once to the court. Talavera, the queen’s\nconfessor, is a good friend of mine, and a letter of introduction to\nhim will gain you access to the king and queen. They will surely help\nyou.” Diego clasps his hands. “Will you stay with me, Diego?” says\nthe long-robed prior. “I’d rather go to court,” says Diego. “Nay, my\nson,” says Columbus, “if the good prior will keep you, I will leave\nyou here while I go on my uncertain errand.” So the little boy stands\nin the great stone doorway and watches his father out of sight toward\nCordova.",
        "27. At Cordova is nothing but excitement and confusion. The army is\njust starting upon a campaign against the Moors. Talavera is\npreoccupied, has his hands full of business, and can scarcely give\nColumbus time enough to state his errand. “Dear me, a new route to the\nIndies! But don’t you see how busy we are with this war? It is\nprobably all nonsense–sounds like it. The court in war-time can not\nwaste precious hours over the consideration of such wild visions as\nthis.” So Columbus takes lodgings in Cordova, supports himself by\nchart-making, talks to everybody about the new route to Asia, and\nwaits. Such a man with such a story is likely to gain some attention,\nand by and by he begins to have friends. Several of the important\npoliticians come to know him, some are converts to his theory, and\nfinally the grand cardinal himself procures him an audience with the\nking and queen.",
        "28. Enthusiastically the “one-idea’d man” unfolds his theories to\nroyalty. The land of the Grand Khan, with its untold treasure, the\nsalvation of millions of souls in the Indies, are the vivid points.\nThe earth is a sphere, and a ship may sail straight from Spain to\nCipango, urges this man of imagination and faith. The king was not\nslow to perceive the great advantages which success in such an\nenterprise would bring to the government that undertook it; but he\nmust consult the wise men. Talavera should head a commission composed\nof the great men in the church, great men of science, and professors\nin the universities. Surely no man could ask for more. So to\nSalamanca, seat of the greatest Spanish university, Columbus went to\nconvince the commission.",
        "29. In the hall of the convent there was assembled the imposing\ncompany–shaved monks in gowns of black and gray, fashionably dressed\nmen from the court in jaunty bats, cardinals in scarlet robes–all the\ndignity and learning of Spain, gathered and waiting for the man and\nhis idea.",
        "30. He stands before them with his charts, and explains his belief\nthat the world is round, and that Asia stretches from the eastern\nboundary of Europe to a point something like four thousand miles from\nSpain. Hence Asia could be reached by sailing due west across the\nAtlantic. They had heard something of this before at Cordova, and here\nat Salamanca, before the commission was formally assembled, and they\nhad their arguments ready.",
        "31. You think the earth is round, and inhabited on the other side? Are\nyou not aware that the holy fathers of the church have condemned this\nbelief? Say the fathers, the Scriptures tell us all men are descended\nfrom Adam; but certainly no men descended from Adam live in such a\nregion as this you speak of–the antipodes. Will you contradict the\nfathers? The Holy Scriptures, too, tell us expressly that the heavens\nare spread out like a tent, and how can that be true if the earth is\nnot flat like the ground the tent stands on? This theory of yours\nlooks heretical.",
        "32. Columbus might well quake in his boots at the mention of heresy;\nfor there was that new Inquisition just in fine running order, with\nits elaborate bone-breaking, flesh-pinching, thumb-screwing, banging,\nburning, mangling system for heretics. What would become of the Idea\nif he should get passed over to that energetic institution?",
        "33. “I am a true and loyal Catholic,” he cries; “I wish to convert the\nGrand Khan’s people to our blessed faith. I believe the Bible, and God\nhimself sends me on this mission. But these words of the Scriptures\nare to be taken as a figure, not as literal facts of science.” “Will\nthis sailor teach us how to read the Scriptures!” growl the monks.",
        "34 “Well, for argument, suppose this world is round, and you could\nsail west to the Indies. The voyage would take years, and you could\nnot carry food enough to keep you from starving.”",
        "35. “But I believe it is only a voyage of four thousand miles, and\ncan, with favoring winds, be accomplished in a short time,” says\nColumbus, stating his scientific reasons for this belief. “Will this\nsailor teach us science!” growl the professors. “Well, all this may be\ntrue; but really, can you expect us to believe that there is a land\nbeneath us where people walk with their feet up, and trees grow down?\"\nOh, foolish Columbus! What an absurd idea! “And, besides, if the\nsignor should succeed in sailing down around the earth to this\npeculiar region, how does he propose to get back again? Will his ship\nsail up-hill?”",
        "36. Oh, the nudgings and winks among the monks at this poser! And the\nprofessors smile triumphantly. “And, anyway, who are you, Signor\nColombo, to set yourself up to know more than all the world beside?\nHaven’t men been sailing in all the seas ever since the time of Noah,\nand, if such a thing as this were possible, would not somebody have\nfound it out long ago?” With sound science, reverent religion,\nenthusiastic imagination and faith, he answered them, this unknown\nsailor, and left them bewildered by his views and impressed by his\npersonality. “Perhaps there is truth in the matter,” said the monks of\nSt. Stephen. They said they would think about it, and they did think\nabout it, and it took them four years to think about it. Meantime they\nadjourned and went about their own affairs, and Columbus went back to\ncourt.",
        "37. The campaign against the Moors began, and from that time to the\nend of those weary years Columbus followed the court from place to\nplace, over the hills and valleys of beautiful Andalusia. Sometimes he\nmade charts for his support, sometimes be fought in the battles,\nsometimes he talked with the courtiers, or begged audience with the\nking to urge him to a decision; but always was with him that one dream\non which he was staking all his time and strength–the best years and\nthe fullest power of his manhood–hope of his heart, purpose of his\nwill, that one Idea possessing him in vivid, unwavering faith.",
        "38. The queen was kind. His enthusiasm and sound judgment, his\npersistent faith in his idea, his dignity and strong determination,\ntempered by the most manly religion, made him friends even among his\nexaminers at Salamanca; and so he hoped and waited. Think of it–four\nyears of suspense on top of thirteen years of thought and study and\ninvestigation toward one end! And when at last Talavera assembled the\nwise men of the commission: to announce the result of their long\ndeliberation, they had come to this wise conclusion: that the whole\nthing was foolish and impossible, unworthy of a great king’s\nattention.",
        "39. Better give it up, Cristoforo Colombo, and make charts for a\nliving the rest of your days. No, says Colombo, that western ocean\nmust be crossed. He turns to the powerful Spanish nobles. They are\nfriendly, but hardly dare take up the project. He will go to France\nand present his case. But first to La Rabida to see Diego, a tall lad\nnow. “What!” says the prior, “no success? Too bad, too bad! But Spain\nmust not give the glory of this great undertaking to France. I know\nthe queen, and I will write to her; I was her confessor once.”",
        "40. He wrote with such force that he was summoned to the queen at\nonce, and his earnest pleading determined Isabella to send again for\nColumbus. But again disappointment came, for they took offense at\nColumbus’s high demands and would not grant them. The Spanish\nsovereigns were to furnish the largest share of the equipment; he\nshould be admiral of the seas, and he and his sons after him were to\nrule, under the king, the countries discovered, and share in all the\nprofits of the enterprise. Bold demands from an adventurer! Seventeen\nyears of waiting might have taught him common sense; but with his\nabsurd faith and uncommon sense he would accept no other terms, and\nturned away again with his Idea and his determination.",
        "41. “Too bad, too bad!” said St. Angel, the tax-collector; “I will\nplead with the queen. She must not let slip this chance of enriching\nthe king–and converting the khan. I will myself lend the money\nnecessary, if the king can’t afford it.” Said Isabella to St. Angel:\n\"I think as you do. This is a wonderful plan. Let them say what they\nwill, by my own right I am queen of Castile, as well as queen of\nSpain, and I pledge the crown of Castile to raise for Cristoforo\nColombo a suitable equipment to sail to the Indies by the west. Let\nhim make his own terms.”",
        "42. At last the fretting applications, the repeated explanations, the\nharrowing suspense, the long restriction are over, and the strong\nwings of the sea-bird are free to bear away over the Atlantic.",
        "43. At Palos, in Southern Spain, three small ships were provided. One,\nthe Santa Maria, in which Columbus was to sail, was fully decked; the\nother two–the Pinta and the Niña–had decks and cabins only at the\nends. As for crews, to secure them was no easy matter. Not many\nsailors cared to trust themselves upon that unknown “Sea of Darkness.\n” Not many believed in this story of a western route to Asia.",
        "44. A few, with visions of the Grand Khan’s palaces and the marvelous\nsights of the East, would go for adventure’s sake, and risk the\nmystery between. A few, thinking of the “great hills of gold,” would\nrisk the danger of tumbling into hell midway for the chance of getting\nsafely across to the land of treasure. Alonzo Pinzon was on hand, as\nhe had promised, and was given command of the Pinta, while the Niña\nwas put in charge of his brother Vincent. Royal pardon for crimes and\noffenses was offered for any who would undertake this voyage, and so\nsome jail-birds were added to the company. Queer stuff for such an\nundertaking! But beggars can not be choosers, and Cristoforo Colombo\nmight be thankful that he could get anybody for his fool’s errand!",
        "45. On August 3, 1492, in the early morning, the three ships lay in\nPalos harbor, and down to Palos harbor flock all the town to see them\noff for Cathay. Groups of trades-people shudder companionably over the\nvague terrors of the Atlantic, and chatter over the probabilities of\nthe adventurers’ return with untold wealth. Excited women-bareheaded\nlikely-gaze again upon the strong, controlled face of Columbus, and\nthank God for this missionary to the Grand Khan-only the dark sea will\nsurely be his destruction before he gets there! Children wriggle\nthrough the throng and stare at the men who are soon to find out what\nbecomes of the sun when it sets, and to know for themselves whether or\nno it hisses and makes the water boil. The sailors make their way\ntoward the ships through a running fire of conversation and\nhand-clasps, culminating at the dock in general good-byes and the\nclinging embraces and sobs of daughters and sweethearts and wives. The\nPinzons are there with their friends. Dr. Fernandez is going, too, and\nthe prior of La Rabida, in his long robe, is exulting with him over\nthis success. Diego, soon to go to court as page to the prince, is\nthere to bid his father good-by.",
        "46. Now all are on the docks ready to embark. A hundred and twenty men\nto brave the unknown terrors of that sea stretching before them! The\nprior steps gravely down among them, carrying the sacred host;\nkneeling before him, Columbus murmurs his last confession and receives\nthe communion; and after him the Pinzons and the sailors reverently\ncommune. The people are silent as the prior blesses the departing\nones, and then the ships are manned, the sails spread, and Palos\nwatches until they flutter, like white birds, out of sight-never to\nreturn! moan the daughters and the sweethearts and the wives; and the\nchildren, with wide dark eyes, whisper of the unicorns and dragons of\nthe East.",
        "47. Off at last! Oh, the exhilaration of it! Admiral of three rickety\nships and all the unknown seas; governor of a hundred disreputable\nsailors and the realms of Cathay!",
        "48. They had not been out three days when the Pinta’s rudder got out\nof order. That crew of the Pinta had been none too willing to start on\nthis rash expedition, and Columbus had his suspicions that they put it\nout of order on purpose. Perhaps they did; anyway, the next day it was\nreported broken again, and Columbus pointed for one of the Canary\nIslands to get it mended. “We are going to Cathay by way of the\nwestern ocean,” they said in reply to the islanders’ questions. “Oh,\"\nsaid the islanders, “every year we can see land lying west of us, away\noff there. You will find it, though none of us have been there.” Some\nweeks of delay that unseaworthy Pinta caused; but at last, on\nSeptember 6th, they were once more started. Now, to the west! And,\nwith their homes and the known world behind them, into the west they\nsailed!",
        "49. Hardly had the land disappeared when the sailors, dismayed at\ntheir own boldness, began to be frightened enough. The steersmen let\nthe vessels drift around a bit. “Steer to the west!” sternly cried\nColumbus. There was grumbling in the crew, and the admiral showed his\nwit by commencing then and there two records of the distance traveled\neach day. The record for the faithless sailors’ edification showed\nfewer miles than the reality, and the truth of the matter no one knew\nbut himself, from that day until he brought them safe to the other\nside. The fifth day a fragment of a ship drifted by them–\"a wreck!\"\ncried the sailors, and grew gloomy over the bad omen. One night a\n\"remarkable bolt of fire” fell into the sea, and the superstitious men\nwere panic-stricken. How could they go on in the face of this message\nfrom heaven? But go on they must. This remarkable admiral said calmly:\n\"Steer to the west.”",
        "50. As the days went on “they began to meet large patches of weeds,\nvery green.” “We must be near to land,” said the sailors. “Perhaps\nsome island,” said the admiral; “but the continent we shall find\nfurther ahead.” Another strange thing happened. That little compass,\ntheir only sure guide to Cathay, began to behave as if it too had lost\nits head over this foolhardy undertaking. The neighbors at home had\nwarned them that the devil managed the compass; and this needle, never\nknown to point anywhere but north, now pointed west of north! Was the\ndevil steering them for hell? Heaven’s fiery bolt had warned them;\nthey had not heeded, and now the devil was tampering with the compass.\nPoor sailors! They looked fiercely on Columbus, and wished themselves\nwell out of this business. But the admiral faced the strange\noccurrence quietly, though his heart may well have beat fearfully, and\nproceeded to investigate its cause. He soon announced it. “It is the\nnorth star that moves,” he coolly informed the terrified men, “the\nneedle is always true.” The admiral was certainly a marvelously wise\nman, and the sailors said no more.",
        "51. Eleven days out. No thickening of the sea yet, except with this\nmass of floating weed. No darkness, except the darkness of night. No\nnearer the sunset, and always at sunset-time that golden western path\nacross the water. Weeds, weeds–vast stretches of weeds; they must\nbetoken land; and a live crab discovered among them would surely seem\nto indicate it. The sea is smooth, the air clear. It is like\n\"Andalusia in April, all but the nightingales,” exclaims the admiral.\nWhat would you give to hear a nightingale just now, brave-hearted\nadmiral, gazing into the moonlit infinity of silence that enspheres\nyou! You can not bear the crystal tension; go below to the relief of\nthe narrow room and the journal faithfully kept!",
        "52. More signs of land. They kill tunnies–sure sign, say the sailors.\nAnd all the signs are from the west, “where I hope the high God in\nwhose hand is all victory will speedily direct us to land,” writes the\nadmiral. Even the faithless sailors begin to forget their sullen\ndisapproval, and the three ships race merrily to see which shall first\ndiscover land. Great flocks of birds Alonzo Pinzon saw from the Pinta.\n\"This very night we shall reach land, I believe!” he exulted; and the\nPinta swiftly shot ahead, expecting to sight the shore at any moment.\n\"There must be islands all about us,” thought the admiral; “but we\nwill not stay for them now. Straight to the west!”",
        "53. Still no land, for all the signs and eager watching. Leagues of\nundulating weeds, but no land! And the faint-hearted sailors grumble\nagain. They fear that they never shall “meet in these seas with a fair\nwind to return to Spain.” A head-wind heartens them, but it quickly\nflits off laden with kisses for Andalusian sweethearts; and again the\neast wind fills the sails and carries them away, and away, and away!",
        "54. Alonzo Pinzon and Columbus hold a conference, and Columbus,\nspreading out that dear map of the Atlantic lying between Europe and\nAsia, traces for the pilots the course they have pursued–a bold,\nstraight westerly line–and shows them that they are now near the\nislands of the Asiatic coast. Inspired delusion! How did it happen\nthat the distance you reckoned to Asia was just the distance that\nlanded you on American shores!",
        "55. Then, again, all eyes strain to the west, and the three little\nships in that great circle of water steer swiftly on their unknown\ncourse to unknown lands. The excited sailors can scarce do their work.\n\"We are nearing land, the admiral says.” “He says it will be perhaps\nCipango itself!” “Think of the gold!” “And the dragons!” “Thou’rt a\ncoward. In Cipango the king has his palace roofed and floored with\ngold.” “And the pearls there are of a beautiful rose-color.” “If it\nis not Cipango, it will be still some other famous island, if not\nCathay.”",
        "56. “But, bethink you of the monsters of those islands: we are like to\nmeet two-headed men, they say, and lions, and beasts with men’s\nheads!” “Ay, but the gold, the gold!” “What will gold be to thee, man,\nwith a cannibal drinking thy blood?” “And there is somewhere there a\nvalley of devils!” “Hist about that, there’s no need to speak.” “Any\nland were better than this dreary, endless ocean!” “Ay, ay, any land\nwere better than this endless ocean!–I go to look for land. The\nadmiral offers a reward to the man first discovering it.” “Ho! for the\nwest, and the golden cities of Cathay!”",
        "57. Monsters? devils? The admiral was a man of science and not of\nsuperstition, but those wild stories may well have made the night\nuncanny for him. Suddenly Alonzo Pinzon cried “Land!” and with\npraiseworthy prudence hastened to claim the reward. The admiral fell\non his knees and thanked God. Alonzo Pinzon’s crew sang the “Gloria\";\nthe men of the Niña ran up the rigging, and shouted that the land was\ntruly there. All night the excited men talked of nothing but that\nland, and the admiral changed their course to southwest, where it\nappeared to lie. Fast they sailed till morning, till noon, till\nafternoon, and then “discovered that what they had taken for land was\nnothing but clouds!” Oh, the fearful reaction after that tense\ntwenty-four hours! “There is no further shore!” cried the sailors. “It\nis as they said: the sea goes on forever, and we are going to death!\"\nThe admiral quietly ordered, “Sail on into the west.” They could not\ngainsay him. He willed it, and they sailed on.",
        "58. Weeds and birds still float and fly about the ships. “Fine weather\nand the sea smooth, many thanks to God,” says the admiral. Alonzo\nPinzon wished to seek the islands that might be near them. “No,” said\nthe admiral, “we shall not change our course.” Put the signs of land\nagain brought reviving spirits and new hope to the men, and again the\nthree ships try to outsail one another in the race for the first\ndiscovery. The Nina suddenly fired a salute–signal of land–but the\nland did not appear. Seeing flocks of birds flying southwest, Columbus\naltered his course to that direction, thinking that the birds knew\nbetter than he where land lay.",
        "59. And three days more they sailed, watching eagerly the various\nsigns–weeds, pelicans, passing birds–gazing, gazing, gazing upon\nthat unbroken boundary line sweeping around the lonesome watery world!\nOnly sky and sea, sea and sky, with lines of passing birds black\nacross the one and the undulating weeds streaking the other–three\nlittle ships with spreading sails under the blue dome, that distant,\nlimiting circle, delicately distinct, always curving in unbroken\nperfection. Ah! the calm cruelty of the smiling sea and sky!",
        "60. “The admiral encouraged them in the best manner he could,\nrepresenting the profits they were about to acquire, and adding that\nit was to no purpose to complain; having come so far, they had nothing\nto do but continue on to the Indies till, with the help of our Lord,\nthey should arrive there.” It is said, though Columbus does not\nrecord it, that now the sailors whispered about among themselves “that\nit would be their best plan to throw him quietly into the sea, and say\nhe unfortunately fell in while he stood absorbed in looking at the\nstars!” If they did plot such folly, they had sense enough not to\ncarry it out.",
        "61. So there was, indeed, nothing for it but to sail on. The next day\nbrought more floating articles and newly excited expectancy. A cane, a\nlog, a carved stick the Pinta found. Think of the way that carved\nstick passed from, hand to hand! “Carved with an iron tool,” said one.\n\"Nay, I doubt it.” See, they are waving a branch from the Niña’s\ndeck! Ho, the Pinta! “A stalk loaded with roseberries!” There must be\nland–or else the devil himself puts these signs in our way. Alonzo\nPirzon, in the swift Pinta, kept ahead. Night came down. At ten the\nadmiral, peer into the darkness, saw a light–was it one of those\nphantom lights reported to dance over these waters? A faint,\nglimmering light! “Pero Gutierrez, come here. I see a light! Look that\nway!\"–\"I see it too,” said Pero. “Rodrigo Sanchez, come here–a\nlight!” But Rodrigo Sanchez does not stand in the right place, and\nsees nothing at all. It was gone a moment. Then the admiral saw it\nmoving up and down. “It may be an indication of land,” admitted\nRodrigo Sanchez; but Columbus was certain, and his orders were prompt\nand imperative: a strict watch to be kept upon the forecastle, and for\nhim who should first see land a silken jacket and the reward promised\nby the king and queen.",
        "62. At midnight the Pinta was still ahead. Ninety miles they had made\nsince sunset. Look out for land, Alonzo Pinzon. Midnight–look sharp.\nNo land. One o’clock–look sharp. No land. Two o’clock–what is it?\nRodrigo de Triana has seen land, land! Make the signals, Alonzo\nPinzon. Ho, the Santa Maria–Land! Ho, the Niña–Land! Take in the\nsails, wait now for the dawn–first dawn for Europe in the new world.",
        "63. In the morning–it was Friday, October 12th, five weeks since they\nsaw the last of the Canaries–they found that the land was a small\nisland with naked people on its shore. Here we are at last! We have\naccomplished it! Think of the exultation! Land with fitting ceremony,\nand take possession for the king and queen of Spain. Drop the small\nboat from the Santa Maria (put in your guns, lest the natives prove\ncannibals). Get in you, and you, and you, of the sailors; get in,\nRodrigo de Escovedo, our secretary; you, of course, Rodrigo Sanchez,\nsince the king sent you on purpose to bear witness to this occasion.\nAlonzo Pinzon and Vincent, carry your standards of the green cross;\nand the admiral bears the royal standard of our sovereigns. All\naboard–put off the boat–row for the shore.",
        "64. The curious natives flock about these strange beings, who come in\nwinged ships, and have bodies covered with something besides skin\nhandsome natives, evidently no cannibals, and very obliging. No lions,\nor hippogriffs, or unicorns. But gold–yes, little pieces of it\nhanging about the savages’ necks. They make signs that it comes from a\nland to the south. Cipango, thought Columbus, and set sail to find it.\nThey were in the group of islands between North and South America,\nwhich we call the Bahamas and the West Indies. The first island\ndiscovered the natives called Guanahani, but Columbus named it San\nSalvador–\"Holy Saviour.”",
        "65. They sailed about among them, hunting for gold and Cipango;\nbartering with the astonished natives; observing the land. Not quite\nequal to Mandeville’s tales were the sights they saw, yet the\nluxuriant, tropical vegetation of the islands, the trees with luscious\nfruit and sweet perfume, the brilliant birds flitting through the\ngreen foliage, the marvelous fish flashing in the waters, the lizards\ndarting across the paths, were wonderful enough in their new beauty to\nthe sea-weary eyes of the Europeans. “I saw no cannibals,” says\nColumbus; but he heard of an island full of them. He heard, too, of\nthe island of the Amazons, fierce, wild women, who use bows and\nspears, and are less like women than men. And there was an island\nwhere the inhabitants had no hair, and one where the people had tails.\nMermaids he saw, but, adds the honest admiral, they were “not so like\nladies as they are painted.”",
        "66. “Where do you get your gold?” says the admiral by signs to the\nislanders. “Cubanacan,” say the natives. Kubla Khan, flashes across\nthe admiral’s mind, and he sails off in renewed certainty. The island\nwhich the natives called Colba, or Cuba, he took for Cipango, and\nafter much searching he came to it at last. When he did reach it, its\nsize deceived him into thinking he had reached the continent, and\nmessengers were straightway dispatched to seek the Grand Khan, with\nhis marble bridges and golden towers. Columbus bad brought along a\nletter to him from Ferdinand and Isabella, in which they tell him\nthat, having heard of his love for them, and his wish to hear news\nfrom Spain, they now send their admiral to tell him of their health\nand prosperity! But the messengers could not find the khan. How could\nyou know, Cristoforo Colombo, that you were only half way around the\ngreat world, and thousands of miles yet from Cathay!",
        "67. America was discovered. The daring admiral never knew it. To the\nday of his death he thought the world was only half as large as it is,\nand that he had sailed west to Cathay.",
        "68. America was discovered. Shout, Palos! Seven months only have\npassed, and here come the heroes back again–back from Cipango and\nCathay. Weep for joy, daughters and sweethearts and wives! Little\nchildren, gaze with fear upon those dark-skinned painted savages, and\nbe consoled that they brought no dragons. Barcelona, ring your bells!\nThe hero, Columbus, is coming in state! Crowd the streets, the doors,\nthe windows, the roofs; king and queen receive him in magnificence.\nHail to the man who has succeeded!",
        "69. Three times afterward Columbus crossed the ocean to the new-found\nIndies, touching once the mainland of South America. No need to go\ninto the details of his after life. How can one have the heart to tell\nof the quick subsiding of his triumph, the malicious envy of\ncourtiers, the unreasonable discontent of subordinates, the selfish\nambition of rivals, the wanton wickedness of the West Indian settlers;\nof his removal from the governorship, and his voyage home in chains,\nover his Atlantic, of his weakening health, his accumulating\nanxieties, his troubled old age? The peaceful death that closed it all\nin 1506 was relief to the bold spirit which injustice and pain could\nnot subdue, but only hamper and fret. From the island of Jamaica,\nthree years before his death, America’s discoverer writes to his king\nand queen:",
        "70. “For seven years was I at your royal court, where every one to\nwhom the enterprise was mentioned treated it as ridiculous; but now\nthere is not a man, down to the very tailors, who does not beg to be\nallowed to become a discoverer. . . . The lands in this part of the\nworld which are now under your highnesses’ sway are richer and more\nextensive than those of any other Christian power; and yet, after that\nI had, by the Divine will, placed them under your high and royal\nsovereignty, and was on the point of bringing your majesties into the\nreceipt of a very great and unexpected revenue,... I was arrested\nand thrown, with my two brothers, loaded with irons, into a ship,\nstripped and very ill treated, without being allowed any appeal to\njustice. . . . I was twenty-eight years old when I came into your\nhighnesses’ service, and now I have not a hair upon me that is not\ngray; my body is infirm, and all that was left to me, as well as to my\nbrothers, has been taken away and sold, even to the frock that I wore,\nto my great dishonor. . . . I implore your highnesses to forgive my\ncomplaints. I am, indeed, in as ruined a condition as I have related;\nhitherto I have wept over others-may Heaven now have mercy upon me,\nand may the earth weep for me. With regard to temporal things, I have\nnot even a blanca for an offering, and in spiritual things, I have\nceased here in the Indies from observing the prescribed forms of\nreligion. Solitary in my trouble, sick, and in daily expectation of\ndeath, surrounded by millions of hostile savages full of cruelty, and\nthus separated from the blessed sacraments of our holy church, how\nwill my soul be forgotten if it be separated from the body in this\nforeign land! Weep for me, whoever has charity, truth, and justice!”",

        "1. After the destruction of the Roman Empire all Europe was in a state\nof anarchy. The long domination of Rome, and the general acceptance of\nthe Roman idea that “the state is everything and the individual man\nnothing,” had unfitted the people for self-government. While Rome\nfell, the system of Rome, leading to absolute monarchy, persisted, and\nout of it grew the present governments of Europe. The conquering Goths\nbrought in a modifying condition which changed the whole relations of\nmonarch to people. In their social and political relations chieftains\nof tribes or clans divided power with the monarch, and for many\ncenturies there was continuous warfare between these antagonistic\nideas. This period is known as the “dark ages,” for while it lasted\nthere was little visible progress, and an apparent almost entire\nforgetfulness of the ancient civilizations.",
        "2. During the dark ages roving bands of freebooters wandered about\nfrom place to place, engaged in robbery, rapine, and murder. To resist\nthis systematic plunder the people placed themselves under the\nguardianship of some powerful chieftain in the vicinity, and paid a\ncertain amount of their earnings for the privilege of enjoying the\nremainder. Hence there grew up, in the Gothic communities of Europe,\nthat peculiar state of society known as “the feudal system.” A great\nchieftain or lord lived in a strong castle built for defense against\nneighboring lords. A retinue of soldiers was in immediate attendance,\nwho, when not engaged in war, passed their time in hunting and\ndebauchery. All the expenses and waste of the castle and its occupants\nwere defrayed by the peasants who cultivated the lands, and who were\nall obliged to take up arms whenever their lord’s dominions were\ninvaded.",
        "3. In process of time the taxes upon the people became so burdensome\nthat they were reduced to the condition of serfs, when all their\nearnings, except enough to supply the barest necessaries of life, were\ntaken from them in the shape of taxes and rents. A constantly\nincreasing number were yearly taken from the ranks of the industrious\nto swell the numbers of the soldiery, until Europe seemed one vast\ncamp.",
        "4. The feudal system demanded little in the way of industry except\nagriculture and rude home manufactures to furnish food and clothing.\nArms were purchased from other lands, the best being obtained from the\nhigher civilization of the Moslems; but, as population increased,\npeople began to congregate in centers and towns, and cities sprung up.\nThese called for more varied industries, and a class of people soon\nbecame numerous who had little or no dependence upon the feudal lord.\nTo protect themselves, craftsmen engaged in the same kind of work\nunited and formed guilds, and the various guilds, though often warring\nwith each other, united for the common defense. The leaders of the\nguilds gradually became the heads of notable burgher families who\nbecame influential and wealthy. As the cities became powerful the\nfeudal system declined, and in many regions the powerful burghers were\nable to maintain their independence, not only against their old lords,\nbut also against the monarch who ruled many lordships.",
        "5. Between the monarch and the lords there was a natural\nantagonism–the monarch endeavoring to gain power, and the lords\nendeavoring to retain their privileges. The burghers made use of these\ncontending forces; and by sometimes siding with the one and sometimes\nwith the other, they not only secured their own freedom, but laid the\nfoundation for the freedom of the people which is now generally\nrecognized, and which forms the very corner-stone of our republican\ninstitutions.",
        "6. But the rise of the burgher class, and the evolution of human\nliberty through their work, was by no means an easy task. As the\nmilitary spirit was dominant, the calling of an artisan was considered\nderogatory, and lords and soldiers looked down upon the industrious\nclasses as inferior beings. Scott well represents this spirit in the\nspeech of Rob Roy, the Highland chief, in his reply to the offer of\nBailie Jarvie to get his sons employment in a factory: “Make my sons\nweavers! I would see every loom in Glasgow, beam, treadle, and\nshuttles, burnt in hell-fire sooner!” To break the force of the strong\nmilitary power, and to secure to the industrious classes the rights of\nhuman beings, required a continuous warfare which lasted through many\ncenturies, and which is far from being finished at the present time.\nBut, thanks to the sturdy valor of the burghers of the middle ages,\nhuman liberty was maintained and transmitted to succeeding\ngenerations.",
        "7. Hitherto in the history of the world mountains had been found\nnecessary for the preservation of human liberty. Thermopylæ,\nMorgarten, Bannockburn, were all fought where precipitous hill-sides\nand narrow valleys prevented the champions of freedom from being\noverwhelmed by numbers, and where a single man in defense of his home\ncould wield more power than ten men in attack. The tyrants who lorded\nit over plains had learned by dear experience to shun mountains and\navoid collisions with mountaineers; and, in case of controversies,\nthey always endeavored to gain by stratagem what they could not obtain\nby force. Austrian tyranny had dashed itself in vain against the Alps,\nand English tyranny had turned back southward, thwarted and impotent,\nfrom the Scotch Highlands.",
        "8. But it was to be demonstrated that liberty might have a home in\nother than mountain fastnesses. Along the North Sea is a stretch of\ncountry redeemed from the ocean. Great dikes, faced with granite from\nNorway, withstand the tempest from the turbulent ocean, and smaller\ndikes prevent inundations from rivers. In thousands of square miles\nthe only land above sea-level is the summit of the dikes. In the\npolders or hollow places below the sea, and saved from destruction\nonly by the dikes, is some of the richest and most productive land in\nEurope. Here prospered a teeming and industrious population.\nAgriculture, the parent of national prosperity, flourished as nowhere\nelse. Manufactures and trade had followed in its train, until the\nhollow lands had become the beehive of Europe. The direction of the\nmost vast commercial enterprises had been transferred from the lagoons\nof Venice to the cities of the dikes.",
        "9. This country for centuries had constituted a part of the German\nEmpire. At one side of the great lines of communication, and moored so\nfar out to sea, it had been overlooked and neglected to a certain\ndegree by the reigning dynasties; and out of this neglect grew its\nprosperity. While the rule of the central government was nearly\nnominal, the feudal lords never obtained a strong foothold in the\ncountry, and the order and peace of the communities were preserved by\nmunicipal officers chosen by suffrage. In process of time wealthy\nburgher families fairly divided political influence with princes, acid\ndictated a policy at once wise and humane. Extortioners were\nsuppressed, industries fostered, and peace maintained.",
        "10. In the religious controversies which followed the preaching of\nLuther, the eastern provinces of the hollow land almost exclusively\nespoused the new religion, while the western provinces clung as\ntenaciously to the old. While this difference in religious opinions\ngave rise to disputes, and tended toward the disruption of social\nrelations, for many years toleration was practiced and peace\npreserved.",
        "11. During the reign of Charles V as emperor of Germany, the lowland\ncountries were permitted to go on in their career of prosperity, with\nthe exception of a religious persecution. Charles was a bigot, and,\nfor a time, he tried to put down heresy with a strong hand; but,\nfinding the new doctrines firmly established in the hearts of the\npeople, he relaxed his persecutions, and permitted things to take\npretty much their own course.",
        "12. On the abdication of Charles V, in 1555, Spain and the low\ncountries fell to the lot of Philip II. Notwithstanding the riches\nwhich had poured into Spain from the plunder of Mexico and Peru, the\nNetherlands were the richest part of Philip’s dominions, yielding him\na princely revenue. But the free spirit manifested by these artisans,\nin their homes by the sea, was contrary to all Philip’s ideas of\ngovernment, and was constantly galling to his personal pride. So he\ndetermined to reduce his Teutonic subjects to the same degree of\nabject submission that he had the residents of the sunny lands of\nSpain. To give intensity to his resolve, Philip was a cold-blooded\nbigot, and in carrying out his state designs he was also gratifying\nhis religious animosities, and giving expression to his almost insane\nreligious hatreds. His policy was directly calculated to ruin the most\nprosperous part of his own dominions–to “kill the goose which laid\nthe golden egg.”",
        "13. Philip spent the first five years of his reign in the Netherlands,\nwaiting the issue of a war in which he was engaged with France. During\nthis period his Flemish and Dutch subjects began to have some\nexperience of his government. They observed with alarm that the king\nhated the country and distrusted the people. He would speak no other\nlanguage than Spanish; his counselors were Spaniards; he kept\nSpaniards alone about his person, and it was to Spaniards that all\nvacant posts were assigned. Besides, certain of his measures gave\ngreat dissatisfaction. He re-enacted the persecuting edicts against\nthe Protestants which his father, in the end of his reign, had\nsuffered to fall into disuse; and the severities which ensued began to\ndrive hundreds of the most useful citizens out of the country, as well\nas to injure trade by deterring Protestant merchants from the Dutch\nand Flemish ports. Dark hints, too, were thrown out that he intended\nto establish an ecclesiastical court in the Netherlands similar to the\nSpanish Inquisition, and the spirit of Catholics as well as\nProtestants revolted from the thought that this chamber of horrors\nshould ever become one of the institutions of their free land.",
        "14. He had also increased the number of bishops in the Netherlands\nfrom five to seventeen; and this was regarded as the mere appointment\nof twelve persons devoted to the Spanish interest, who would help, if\nnecessary, to overawe the people. Lastly, he kept the provinces full\nof Spanish troops, and this was in direct violation of a fundamental\nlaw of the country.",
        "15. Against these measures the nobles and citizens complained\nbitterly, and from them drew sad anticipations of the future. Nor were\nthey more satisfied with the address in which, through the bishop of\nArras as his spokesman, he took farewell of them at a convention of\nthe states held at Ghent previous to his departure to Spain. The\noration recommended severity against heresy, and only promised the\nwithdrawal of the foreign troops. The reply of the states was firm and\nbold, and the recollection of it must have rankled afterward in the\nrevengeful mind of Philip. “I would rather be no king at all,” he said\nto one of his ministers at the time, “than have heretics for my\nsubjects.” But suppressing his resentment in the mean time, be set\nsail for Spain in August, 1559, leaving his half-sister to act as his\nviceroy in the Netherlands.",
        "16. At this juncture, while the Dutch were threatened by a complete\nsubjugation of their liberties, a champion arose who in the end proved\nmore than a match for Philip both in diplomatic fields and in military\noperations. This was William, Prince of Orange, one of the highest\nnobility, but with his whole heart in sympathy with the people.\nInheriting a personality almost perfect in physical, mental, and moral\nvigor and harmony, he early manifested a prudence and wisdom which\ngained for him the entire confidence of the suspicious and experienced\nCharles V.",
        "17. It was on the arm of William of Orange that Charles had leaned for\nsupport on that memorable day when, in the assembly of the states at\nBrussels, he rose feebly from his seat, and declared his abdication of\nthe sovereign power; and it was said that one of Charles’s last\nadvices to his son Philip was to cultivate the goodwill of the people\nof the Netherlands, and especially to defer to the counsels of the\nPrince of Orange. When, therefore, in the year 1555, Philip began his\nrule in the Netherlands, there were few persons who were either better\nentitled or more truly disposed to act the part of faithful and loyal\nadvisers than William of Nassau, then twenty-two years of age.",
        "18. But, close as had been William’s relations to the late emperor,\nthere were stronger principles and feelings in his mind than gratitude\nto the son of the monarch whom he had loved. He had thought deeply on\nthe question, how a nation should be governed, and had come to\nentertain opinions very hostile to arbitrary power; he had observed\nwhat appeared to him, as a Catholic, gross blunders in the mode of\ntreating religious differences; he had imbibed deeply the Dutch spirit\nof independence; and it was the most earnest wish of his heart to see\nthe Netherlands prosperous and happy. Nor was he at all a visionary,\nor a man whose activity would be officious and troublesome; he was\neminently a practical man, one who had a strong sense of what is\nexpedient in existing circumstances; and his manner was so grave and\nquiet that he obtained the name of “William the Silent.” Still, many\nthings occurred during Philip’s four years’ residence in the\nNetherlands to make him speak out and remonstrate. He was one of those\nwho tried to get the king to use gentler and more popular measures,\nand the consequence was that a decided aversion grew up in the dark\nand haughty mind of Philip to the Prince of Orange.",
        "19. After the departure of Philip the administration of the Duchess of\nParma produced violent discontent. The persecutions of the Protestants\nwere becoming so fierce that, over and above the suffering inflicted\non individuals, the commerce of the country was sensibly falling off.\nThe establishment of a court like the Inquisition was still in\ncontemplation; Spaniards were still appointed to places of trust in\npreference to Flemings; and finally, the Spanish soldiers, who ought\nto have been removed long ago, were still burdening the country with\ntheir presence. The woes of the people were becoming intolerable;\noccasionally there were slight outbreaks of violence; and a low murmur\nof vehement feeling ran through the whole population, foreboding a\ngeneral eruption. “Our poor fatherland!” they said to each other; “God\nhas afflicted as with two enemies, water and Spaniards; we have built\ndikes and overcome the one, but how shall we get rid of the other?\nWhy, if nothing better occurs, we know one way at least, and we shall\nkeep it in reserve–we can set the two enemies against each other. We\ncan break down the dikes, inundate the country, and let the water and\nthe Spaniards fight it out between them.”",
        "20. About this time, too, the decrees of the famous Council of Trent,\nwhich had been convened in 1545 to take into consideration the state\nof the Church and the means of checking the new religion, and which\nhad closed its sittings in the end of 1563, were made public; and\nPhilip, the most zealous Catholic of his time, issued immediate orders\nfor their being enforced both in Spain and in the Netherlands. In\nSpain the decrees were received as a matter of course, the council\nhaving authority over the Catholic people; but the attempt to force\nthe mandates of an ecclesiastical body upon a people who neither\nacknowledged its authority nor believed in its truth, was justly\nregarded as an outrage, and the whole country burst out in a storm of\nindignation. In many places the decrees were not executed at all; and\nwherever the authorities did attempt to execute them, the people rose\nand compelled them to desist.",
        "21. A political club or confederacy was organized among the nobility\nfor the express purpose of resisting the establishment of the\nInquisition. They bound themselves by a solemn oath “to oppose the\nintroduction of the Inquisition, whether it were attempted openly or\nsecretly, or by whatever name it should be called,” and also to\nprotect and defend each other from all the consequences which might\nresult from their having formed this league.",
        "22. Perplexed and alarmed, the regent implored the Prince of Orange\nand his two associates, Counts Egmont and Horn, to return to the\ncouncil and give her their advice. They did so; and a speech of the\nPrince of Orange, in which he asserted strongly the utter folly of\nattempting to suppress opinion by force, and argued that “such is the\nnature of heresy that if it rests it rusts, but whoever rubs it whets\nit,” had the effect of inclining the regent to mitigate the ferocity\nof her former edicts. Meanwhile the confederates were becoming bolder\nand more numerous. Assembling in great numbers at Brussels, they\nwalked in procession through the streets to the palace of the regent,\nwhere they were admitted to an interview. In reply to their petition,\nshe said she was willing to send one or more persons to Spain to lay\nthe complaint before the king.",
        "23. While the nobles and influential persons were thus preparing to\nco-operate, in case of a collision with the Spanish government, a\nsudden and disastrous movement occurred among the lower classes. It\nwas stated and believed that the regent had given permission for the\nexercise of the Protestant form of worship, and throughout Flanders\nmultitudes poured into the fields after the preachers. The reaction\nafter the suppression of the previous years was very great, and the\npent-up emotions were easily kindled into rage against the Catholics.\nLed on by fanatics, the ignorant masses made a concerted attack upon\nthe Catholic churches, shattering their windows, tearing up their\npavements, and destroying all the objects of art which they contained.\nThe cathedral at Antwerp was the special object of attack, and it was\nreduced to an almost hopeless ruin. The patriot nobles exerted their\ninfluence, and at last succeeded in suppressing the violence and in\nrestoring order.",
        "24. Before the news of this outburst had reached Spain, Philip had\nresolved to crush the confederacy and break the proud spirit of the\nNetherlands. Secret orders; were given for the collection of troops;\nthe regent was instructed to amuse the patriots until the means of\npunishing them were ready; and in a short time it was hoped that there\nwould no longer be a patriot or a heretic in the Low Countries. It is\neasy to conceive with what rage and bitterness of heart Philip, while\nindulging these dreams, must have received intelligence of the\nterrible doings of the iconoclasts. But, as cautious and dissimulating\nas he was obstinate and revengeful, he concealed his intentions in the\nmean time, announced them to the regent only in secret letters and\ndispatches, and held out hopes in public to the patriots and people of\nthe Netherlands that he was soon to pay them a visit in person to\ninquire into the condition of affairs.",
        "25. William had secret intelligence of the purpose of Philip in time\nto avert its worst consequences. The man whom Philip sent into the\nNetherlands at the head of the army, as a fit instrument of his\npurpose of vengeance, was the Duke of Alva, a personage who united the\nmost consummate military skill with the disposition of a ruffian,\nready to undertake any enterprise however base. Such was the man who,\nat the age of sixty, in the month of August, 1567, made his entry into\nthe Netherlands at the head of an army of fifteen thousand men. One of\nhis first acts was the arrest of the Counts Egmont and Horn. The\nregent resigned, and Alva was left in supreme control. Now ensued the\ngrand struggle in the Netherlands. On the one hand was a nation of\nquiet, orderly people, industrious in a high degree, prosperous in\ntheir commerce, and disposed to remain peaceful subjects to a foreign\nmonarch; on the other hand was a sovereign who, unthankful for the\nblessing of reigning over such a happy and well-disposed nation, and\nstimulated by passion and bigotry, resolved on compelling all to\nsubmit to his will on penalty of death.",
        "26. Alva at once commenced his persecutions. Supported by his army,\nblood was shed like water. The Inquisition was established, and began\nits work of unspeakable horrors in the Netherlands. Patriots and\nProtestants in crowds left the country. The leading men of the\nNetherlands were arrested and executed. Under circumstances of extreme\nferocity Counts Egmont and Horn were beheaded at Brussels.\nOverwhelming taxes were imposed upon the people, and during the short\nperiod of his administration Alva executed eighteen thousand patriots,\nincluding many Catholics; for, in his rage against the free spirit of\nthe Netherlanders, he recognized no distinction in condition or in\nreligious belief.",
        "27. In the mean time the Prince of Orange was active in devising means\nto liberate his unfortunate country from the terrible scourge to which\nit was subjected. For five years he battled incessantly against the\nSpanish power. Now he entered into combination with the English and\nnow with the French, with the vain hope of obtaining a sufficient\nforce to drive the Spaniards out of the country. Twice he raised an\narmy and marched to the aid of the brave burghers, who still\nmaintained their independence, and both times was defeated by the\nsuperior force and generalship of Alva. He organized a fleet which\nravaged the coast, captured vessels laden with provisions for Alva’s\narmy, and defended the ports within reach of their guns, When the\nshattered remains of William’s last army retreated across the German\nfrontier, it seemed that the people of the Netherlands were about to\nbe left to their fate.",
        "28. But sixty cities and towns were now in revolt, and, unless they\nwere recovered, Philip could no longer be considered the king of the\nNetherlands. Nothing was left but the slow process of siege\noperations. Haarlem held out seven months, and cost the Spaniards ten\nthousand men. It surrendered at last under the promise of an amnesty\nto its defenders, when they were murdered by thousands in cold blood.\nBut Philip was dissatisfied with Alva for his slow progress, and for\nhis execution of Catholics as well as Protestants; and in 1753, after\nfive years’ rule, he recalled him, and, with characteristic\ningratitude, neglected and ill-treated him for his faithful but bloody\nservices.",
        "29. Don Luis Requesens succeeded the Duke of Alva as governor of the\nNetherlands and as commander of the Spanish army. While a zealous\nCatholic, he seems to have been a much more humane and just man than\nAlva. He began his administration by abolishing the most obnoxious\nmeasures of his predecessor, thus changing the whole tone of the\ngovernment. Had he been left to follow his own counsels in everything,\nhe doubtless would have come to an understanding with the Prince of\nOrange, and established peace upon a permanent basis. But the king was\nobstinately determined to capture the revolted cities and punish his\nrebel subjects, and the general was obliged to continue the war. At\nthis time William was besieging Middleburg, on the island of Zealand,\nand one of the first acts of the newly-appointed, governor was to\nraise the siege. To this end he caused a large fleet to be assembled,\nand under the command of two experienced admirals he sent it down the\nScheldt to the relief of Middleburg. The Prince of Orange immediately\nhastened to the critical spot, and gave direction to patriot\noperations. The Holland ships were collected, and a great naval battle\ntook place on January 29, 1574. Although their force was much the\ngreater, the Spaniards had little chance upon the water in a contest\nwith the half-amphibious inhabitants of the Low Countries. The smaller\nvessels of the Prince of Orange fell upon the Spanish fleet with a\nferocity which they could not withstand, and the result was a complete\nvictory, with the destruction of their principal vessels. Middleburg\nsoon after surrendered to the patriots, and the sway of William over\nthe maritime provinces was rendered complete.",
        "30. In April an army from Germany, raised through the influence of the\nPrince of Orange, and commanded by his brother, Count Henry of Nassau,\nmarched into the Low Countries; but the Spaniards dominated the land\nas the Dutch the sea, and the relief array was defeated and Count\nHenry was killed. This defeat, however, to the patriot cause, was\nalmost equal to a victory. The Spanish troops, who had long been\nwithout pay, became mutinous and unmanageable, and before they could\nbe appeased much precious time was lost. The Prince of Orange made the\nbest use of this time. The revolted cities were strengthened and\nsupplied with provisions, and every preparation made for both\ndefensive and offensive war. But, best of all, the Dutch admiral\nboldly sailed up the Scheldt, captured forty of the Spanish vessels,\nand sunk many more.",
        "31. At length the Spanish general was once more ready to continue his\naggressive movements, and he proceeded to lay siege to the populous\ncity of Leyden. The story of this siege is one of the most\nspirit-stirring in the annals of heroism. Leyden stands in a low\nsituation, in the midst of a labyrinth of rivulets and canals. That\nbranch of the Rhine which still retains the name of its upper course\npasses through the middle of it, and front this stream such an\ninfinity of canals are derived that it is difficult to say whether the\nwater or the land possesses, the greater space. By these canals the\nground on which the city stands is divided into a great number of\nsmall islands, united together by bridges.",
        "32. For five months all other operations were suspended; all the\nenergy of Requesens, on the one hand, was directed toward getting\npossession of the city, and all the energy of the Prince of Orange, on\nthe other hand, toward assisting the citizens, and preventing it from\nbeing taken. The issue depended entirely, however, on the bravery and\nresolution of the citizens of Leyden themselves. Pent up within their\nwalls, they had to resist the attacks and stratagems of the besiegers;\nand all that the Prince of Orange could do was to occupy the\nsurrounding country, harass the besiegers as much as possible, and\nenable the citizens to hold out, by conveying to them supplies of\nprovisions and men.",
        "33. There was not in the city a single scion of a noble family. There\nwere no men trained to military operations. It was a city of artisans\nand tradesmen, and the Spaniards expected scarcely more than a show of\nresistance from a foe so ignoble. As well might the sheep resist a\npack of ravening wolves as the men of the counting-house and workshop\nresist the best trained soldiers of Europe. But nobly, nay, up to the\nhighest heroic pitch of human nature, did the citizens behave! They\nhad to endure a siege in its most dreary form–that of a blockade.\nInstead of attempting to storm the town, Valdez, the Spanish general,\nresolved to reduce it by the slow process of starvation. For this\npurpose he completely surrounded the town by a circle of forts more\nthan sixty in number; and the inhabitants thus saw themselves walled\ncompletely in from the rest of the earth, with its growing crops and\nits well-filled granaries, and restricted entirely to whatever\nquantity of provisions there happened to be on the small spot of\nground on which they walked up and down. Their only means of\ncommunication with the Prince of Orange was by carrier-pigeons trained\nfor the purpose.",
        "34. One attempt was made by them to break through the line of\nblockade, for the sake of keeping possession of a piece of\npasture-ground for their cattle; but it was unsuccessful; and they\nbegan now to work day and night in repairing their fortifications, so\nas to resist the Spanish batteries when they should begin to play.\nLike fire pent up, the patriotism of the inhabitants burned more\nfiercely and brightly; every man became a hero, every woman an orator,\nand words of flashing genius were spoken and deeds of wild bravery\ndone, such as would have been impossible except among twenty thousand\nhuman beings living in the same city, and all roused at once to the\nsame unnatural pitch of emotion.",
        "35. The two leading spirits were John van der Dors, the commander,\nbetter known by his Latinized name of Dousa; and Peter van der Werf,\nthe burgomaster. Plebeian names these, but loftier natures never\npossessed the hearts of kings or nobles! Beside their deeds, the\nchivalry of knighthood looks trivial and mean. Under the management of\nthese two men every precaution was adopted for the defense of the\ncity. The resolution come to was, that the last man among them should\ndie of want rather than admit the Spaniards into the town. Coolly, and\nwith a foresight thoroughly Dutch, Dousa and Van der Werf set about\nmaking an inventory of all that was eatable in the town: corn,\ncattle–nay, even horses and dogs; calculating how long the stock\ncould last at the rate of so much a day to every man and woman in the\ncity; adopting means to get the whole placed under the management of a\ndispensing committee; and deciding what should be the allowance per\nhead at first, so as to prevent their stock from being eaten up too\nfast.",
        "36. It was impossible, however, to collect all the food into one fund,\nor to regulate its consumption by municipal arrangements; and, after\ntwo months had elapsed, famine bad commenced in earnest, and those\ndevices for mitigating the gnawings of hunger began to be employed\nwhich none but starving men would think of. Not only the flesh of dogs\nand horses, but roots, weeds, nettles–everything green that the eye\ncould detect shooting up from the earth–was ravenously eaten. Many\ndied of want, and thousands fell ill. Still they held out, and\nindignantly rejected the offers made to them by the besiegers.",
        "37. “When we have nothing else,” said Dousa, in reply to a message\nfrom Valdez, “we will eat our left hands, keeping the right to fight\nwith.” Once, indeed, hunger seemed to overcome patriotism, and for\nsome days crowds of gaunt and famished wretches moved along the\nstreets, crying: “Let the Spaniards in; for God’s sake let them in!\"\nAssembling with hoarse clamor at the house of Van der Werf, they\ndemanded that he should give them food or surrender. “I have no food\nto give you,” was the burgomaster’s reply, “and I have sworn that I\nwill not surrender to the Spaniards; but, if my body will be of any\nservice to you, tear me in pieces, and let the hungriest of you eat\nme.” The poor wretches went away, and thought no more of\nsurrendering.",
        "38. The thought of the Prince of Orange night and day was how to\nrender assistance to the citizens of Leyden–how to convey provisions\ninto the town. He had collected a large supply, but, with all his\nexertions, could not raise a sufficient force to break through the\nblockade. In this desperate extremity the Dutch resolved to have\nrecourse to that expedient which they had kept in reserve until it\nshould be clear that no other was left–they would break their dikes,\nopen their sluices, inundate the whole level country around Leyden,\nand wash the Spaniards and their forts utterly away!",
        "39. It was truly a desperate measure, and it was only in the last\nextremity that they could bring themselves to think of it. All that\nfertile land, which the labor of ages had drained and cultivated–to\nsee it converted into a sheet of water! There could not possibly be a\nsight more unseemly and melancholy to a Dutchman’s eyes. But, when the\nmeasure was once resolved upon, they set to work with a heartiness and\nzeal greater than that which had attended their building. Hatchets,\nhammers, spades, and pickaxes were in requisition; and by the labor of\na single night the work of ages was demolished and undone. The water,\navailing itself of the new inlets, poured over the flat country, and\nin a short time the whole of the region between Leyden and Rotterdam\nwas flooded.",
        "40. The Spaniards, terror-stricken, at first resolved upon immediate\nflight; but, seeing that the water did not rise above a certain level,\nthey recovered their courage, and, though obliged to abandon their\nforts, which were stationed upon the low grounds, they persevered in\nthe blockade. But there was another purpose to be served by the\ninundation of the country beside that of washing away the Spaniards,\nand the Prince of Orange made preparations for effecting it. He had\ncaused two hundred flat-bottomed boats to be built, and loaded with\nprovisions; these now began to row toward the famished city. The\ninhabitants saw them coming; they watched them eagerly advancing\nacross the waters, fighting their way past the Spanish forts, and\nbringing bread to them. But it seemed as if Heaven itself had become\ncruel; for a north wind was blowing, and, so long as it continued to\nblow, the waters would not be deep enough for the boats to reach the\ncity. They waited for days, every eye fixed on the vanes; but still\nthe wind continued in the north, though never within the memory of the\noldest citizen had it blown in that direction so long at that time of\nyear. Many died in sight of the vessels that contained the food which\nwould have kept them alive; and those who survived shuffled along the\nstreets, living skeletons instead of men!",
        "41. But the sea did not at last desert the brave men who had so long\ndominated it. At the last extremity it roused itself and swept down in\nits might upon the doomed Spaniards. When but two days stood between\nthe starving citizens and death, lo! the vanes trembled and veered\nround; the wind shifted first to the northwest, blowing the sea-tides\nwith hurricane force into the mouth of the rivers, and then to the\nsouth, driving the waters directly toward the city. The remaining\nforts of the Spaniards were quickly begirt with water. The Spaniards\nthemselves, pursued by the Zealanders in their boats, were either\ndrowned or shot swimming, or fished out with hooks fastened to the end\nof poles, and killed with the sword. Several bodies of them, however,\neffected their escape. The citizens had all crowded at the gates to\nmeet their deliverers. With bread in their hands they ran through the\nstreets; and many who had outlived the famine died of surfeit. The\nsame day they met in one of the churches–a lean and sickly\ncongregation–with the magistrates at their head, to return thanks to\nAlmighty God for his mercy.",
        "42. The citizens of Leyden had performed their duty nobly and well. It\nwas a triple service–they had driven away from their city the hated\nSpaniard; they had secured the freedom of their country; and they had\npreserved liberty for mankind. No nobler deeds are chronicled in all\nhistory than this long battle with death, than this silent,\nuncomplaining endurance during the long weeks, while the life-giving\nsuccors were delayed by adverse winds. As a recompense to the people\nof Leyden for their heroic conduct, the Prince of Orange gave them the\nchoice of exemption from taxes for a certain number of years, or of\nhaving a university established in the city; and, much to their honor,\nthey preferred the latter. The University of Leyden was accordingly\nestablished in 1575. At one time it attained so high a reputation for\nlearning that Leyden was styled the Athens of the West.",
        "1. In 1588 the “Invincible Armada” sailed from Spain into the high\nseas. To understand the nature of this formidable naval armament and\nthe reasons for its sailing, we must take a brief survey of the\ncondition of Europe at this period of the world’s history.",
        "2. At this time Spain was the most powerful of the monarchies of\nEurope. Many causes had conspired to give her this pre-eminence. About\none hundred years before, the two principal provinces, Castile and\nAragon, were united by the marriage of their sovereigns, Isabella and\nFerdinand. In 1492 the Aloors were subjugated, uniting the whole\npeninsula under one government. In the same year, under the auspices\nof the Spanish sovereigns, Columbus discovered the New World, giving\nadditional luster to the Spanish name and a new impulse to Spanish\nadventure.",
        "3. Thirty years later, Mexico and Peru had been overrun and plundered\nby Cortes and Pizarro, and the treasures of millions of people,\naccumulated through many centuries, became a possession of the Spanish\npeople; raising them to a degree of opulence unknown since the time of\nthe most illustrious of the Roman emperors. In consequence of this\nwealth, commerce expanded, large cities grew up along the courses of\nthe navigable rivers, and all branches of industry were aroused to a\nstate of great activity.",
        "4. In 1516 Spain and Austria were united under the Emperor Charles V,\ngrandson of Ferdinand and Isabella; and, during his reign, the united\nkingdoms arose to a height of power almost equal to that of the empire\nof Charlemagne. The dominion of Charles extended from the Atlantic to\nthe steppes of Poland, and from the Mediterranean to the Baltic. It\nincluded all of Western Continental Europe, except France and Southern\nItaly. In 1556 Charles abdicated his throne, and divided his empire,\ngiving Austria and Germany to his brother Ferdinand, and Spain and the\nLow Countries of Holland and Belgium to his son Philip II.",
        "5. Spain was now rich and powerful. Her armies were large, and were\ncommanded by the most experienced military officers of Europe.\nMaterial progress showed itself on every side. The richest commerce of\nthe world poured its wealth into her ports. A new intellectual life\nwas aroused, which found expression in literature and schools. All the\nconditions seemed to indicate that the Spanish people were about to\nlead Europe in the direction of a higher civilization.",
        "6. But soon all this changed. Philip was vain, bigoted, and ambitious.\nIn his administration of public affairs he seemed to have but two\nobjects in view, to augment Spanish power, and to cause his own\nreligious creed to be universally accepted. To promote these objects\nhe had no scruples in regard to means. His own people were tortured\nand executed by the thousand. By this savage policy he stamped out\nheresy, placed freedom of thought under a ban, and put an end to the\nintellectual progress of the country. In his dealings with other\nnations his diplomacy included all the arts of chicanery and deceit.",
        "7. Two formidable obstacles stood in the way of the realization of his\nplans. Heretical England had become a strong naval power, and English\nships captured his treasure-vessels laden with the spoils of the\ncountries lie had plundered. The eagles of the sea despoiled the\nwolves of the main of their ill-got gains. The second trouble was\nnearer home. The people of the Low Countries revolted alike from his\ngovernment and his creed. To remove these obstacles was the first step\ntoward the attainment of his larger ambitions.",
        "8. In regard to England, Philip ventured upon a master-stroke of\npolicy. He sought the hand of Mary, the newly crowned Queen of\nEngland, and married her. By this step lie hoped and expected to\nextinguish dissent in England as he had done in his own dominions, to\ngradually usurp the government, and to make English naval supremacy\nsubserve the interests of Spain.",
        "9. But Philip was sorely disappointed. Mary, though narrow and\nbigoted, and at one with hire in creed, had still English blood in\nher; and English independence had been sturdily maintained through too\nmany centuries to be surrendered to any power or on any pretext. The\nEnglish Parliament also interfered and refused to crown him jointly\nwith Mary. So Philip found himself united to a sickly, peevish wife of\ntwice his age, and entirely powerless to effect the purposes he had in\nview.",
        "10. Three or four years passed in fruitless intrigue. Punishments for\nheresy were frequent, but the fires of persecution never blazed so\nfiercely in the cooler atmosphere of England as in Spain, and the\nvictims of the stake could be counted singly instead of by the\nthousand. Then Mary died, and Elizabeth ascended the throne of\nEngland. The new queen declined the honor of Philip’s hand which was\ntendered her, and she zealously espoused the cause of the English\nchurch. The hunted turned hunters, and the last fires of English\npersecution were lit by those whom the stake had threatened all\nthrough the dreary years of Mary’s reign. This change of front and the\ngradual amelioration of penalties which followed show that\npersecutions are not the monopoly of any sect, but are rather the\nmanifestations of an irresponsible power in a semi-barbarous age.",
        "11. Philip retired angry and disgusted. The contemptuous refusal of\nhis hand by Elizabeth was a terrible shock to his personal pride; the\ntriumph of the new church inflamed his bigotry; and the sturdy\nindependence of the English people was a severe blow to his pride of\ncountry. He brooded over the situation and determined to resent the\nslights–personal and public–which had been put upon him.",
        "12. From his purpose he was for a time diverted by the attitude of his\nrebellious subjects in Belgium. Maddened to ferocity by the failure of\nhis plans, he devoted the whole people to destruction, and he sent his\nbest-equipped armies, under the terrible Duke of Alva, to devastate\nthe cities of the dikes as Pizarro had destroyed the homes of the\nIncas. After innumerable atrocities, and the wholesale slaughter of\nmen, women, and children, the remnant of freedom was preserved by the\nobstinacy of the Dutch burghers, the wise policy of William the\nSilent, the aid of the sea, and the succor furnished by Elizabeth.",
        "13. Here, again, was practical defeat. His cherished purposes were\nthwarted, and the high hope of his life was gone. Nothing was left but\ndespair and revenge. At this time Philip began to exhibit in a marked\ndegree the madness which overshadowed the last years of his life. His\nhatred of England grew from day to day, and at last took shape in a\ndetermination to make one supreme effort to conquer his rival, and to\ncheck the rising free thought of the English people. For years the\npreparations went, on for the great conflict, and in 1588, twenty\nyears after the accession of Elizabeth to the throne, everything was\nready.",
        "14. And what of England and of her ability to resist this formidable\nattack? For a hundred years before the beginning of the sixteenth\ncentury, the civil wars of the Roses had desolated the country and put\nan end to national growth. For the next fifty years, and until the\ncommencement of the reign of Elizabeth, violence and bloodshed were so\ncommon that the population barely maintained its own. In 1588 the\nwhole number of people in England and Wales was estimated at four\nmillions, about one third of the population of Spain.",
        "15. But England possessed two elements of strength–her people,\nalthough differing in creed and often warring with one another,\nwere intensely patriotic, and were united as one man against a\nforeign foe; and the ships of England, manned by English crews\nand commanded by her great captains–the legitimate successors\nof the old Vikings–dominated the seas. No enterprise was too\nhazardous for these hardy mariners to undertake, and no disparity\nof force ever induced them to pause. Philip was often wrought to\nfrenzy as he saw these bold corsairs capture his treasure-ships\nand ravage his coasts in sight of his invincible but impotent\narmies.",
        "16. The mode of attack which Philip determined upon consisted of two\ndistinct but co-operative movements. A formidable army of invasion,\nunder the Duke of Parma, the most experienced and skillful commander\nin Europe, was stationed at the several ports of the Low Countries,\nopposite the British coast, from Dunkirk east. Innumerable transports\nwere provided to convey this host across the Channel, and, once on\nEnglish ground, an easy and triumphant march to London was expected.\nThe second part of the grand expedition consisted of an immense fleet\nof the largest vessels ever built, under the command of the Duke of\nMedina Sidonia, which was to drive away the English ships and convoy\nthe army of Parma to the English shore. This fleet was christened by\nthe Spaniards “The Invincible Armada.”",
        "17. “Philip hastened his preparations with all the energy he could\ncommand. In every port resounded the axe and hammer of the\nship-builder; in every arsenal blazed the flames of busy forges. All\nSpanish Europe echoed with the din of arms. Provisions were amassed in\na thousand granaries; soldiers were daily mustered on the\nparade-grounds, drilled, and accustomed to the use of arquebus and\ncannon. Carts and wagons were built in hundreds for the conveyance of\nstores; spades, mattocks; and baskets were got ready for the pioneers;\niron and brass ordnance were cast, and leaden shot melted in enormous\nquantities; nor were the instruments of torture–the thumb-screw and\nthe ’jailer’s daughter’–forgotten.”",
        "18. In 1587 the preparations were nearly completed, and the Armada was\nabout ready to sail, when a knowledge of its destination became known\nto Sir Francis Drake, the great English commander. Without considering\nthe disparity of force, the old sea-king, with a fleet of\nswift-sailing vessels, made a sudden descent upon the port of Cadiz,\nwhere the ships of the Armada were at anchor. Many of the larger\nvessels escaped by taking refuge under the guns of the forts, but the\ncity was lit up by the blaze of one hundred and fifty burning ships,\nand the great enterprise was delayed for another year.",
        "19. But this disaster only called forth greater exertions. The maimed\nvessels were repaired, new ones were built, and at length one hundred\nand thirty-two ships, many of them the largest ever known at the time,\nwere ready to sail. They carried three thousand guns and thirty\nthousand men. On May 3d the Armada sailed from the mouth of the Tagus,\nbut a great gale dispersed the ships, and obliged them to put back\ninto port to repair. Surely God did not smile upon the beginning of a\nwarfare carried on in his name! It was not until July 12th that the\nfleet finally sailed from Corunna on its mission of destruction, and\nto meet its fate.",
        "20. To cope with this formidable force, the whole British navy could\nmuster only thirty-six vessels, all much smaller than the largest of\nthe Spanish ships. But, in consideration of the great danger,\nmerchants and private gentlemen fitted out vessels at their own\nexpense, and by midsummer a fleet of one hundred and ninety-seven\nships was placed at the disposal of the British admiral. In tonnage,\nnumber of guns, and number of men, the strength of the whole fleet was\nabout one half that of the Armada.",
        "21. But all England was aroused. For more than five centuries this was\nthe first foreign invasion that had threatened her shores. The years\nof preparation had given time for the avowed purposes of Philip to\nbecome known throughout the kingdom. There was anxiety everywhere, for\nno one knew where and when the blow was to be struck; but there was no\nthought of submission, and all England stood alert, eagerly watching\nand waiting. Much to Philip’s disappointment and chagrin, the great\nCatholic families of England rallied to their country’s defense as\nreadily as their Protestant neighbors, and all Englishmen stood\nshoulder to shoulder in this supreme moment of the nation’s peril.\nVessels patrolled the shores, to give notice of the coming ships;\nsoldiers drilled in every hamlet; and on the hill-tops piles of fagots\nwere placed so that signal-fires might speedily send the news to the\nremotest parts of the kingdom.",
        "22. Canon Kingsley has given a graphic picture of England’s great\nnaval commanders, when the news was received that the Armada was off\nthe coast. He supposes them assembled at Plymouth on the 19th of July,\nengaged in the then favorite game of bowls.",
        "23. “Those soft, long eyes and pointed chin you recognize already.\nThey are Sir Walter Raleigh’s. The fair young man in the flame-colored\nsuit at his side is Lord Sheffield; opposite them stand Lord\nSheffield’s uncle, Sir Richard Grenville, and the stately Lord Charles\nHoward of Effingham, Lord High Admiral of England next to him is his\nson-in-law, Sir Robert Southwell, captain in her Majesty’s service.",
        "24. “But who is that short, sturdy, plainly dressed man, who stands\nwith legs a little apart, and hands behind his back, looking up with\nkeen gray eyes into the face of each speaker? His cap is in his hand,\nso you can see the bullet-head of crisp brown hair and the wrinkled\nforehead as well as the high cheek-bones, the short square face, the\nbroad temples, the thick lips, which are yet as firm as granite. A\ncoarse, plebeian stump of a man; yet the whole figure and attitude are\nthose of boundless determination, self-possession, energy; and, when\nat last he speaks a few blunt words, all eyes are turned respectfully\non him, for his name is Francis Drake.",
        "25. “A burly, grizzled elder, in greasy, sea-stained garments,\ncontrasting oddly with the huge gold chain about his neck, waddles up,\nas if he had been born, and had lived ever since, in a gale of wind at\nsea. The upper half of his sharp, dogged visage seems of a brick-red\nleather, the brow of badger’s fur, and, as he claps Drake on the back,\nwith a broad Devon accent he shouts, ’Be you a-coming to drink your\nwine, Francis Drake, or be you not? saving your presence my lord.’\nThe lord high admiral only laughs, and bids Drake go and drink his\nwine, for John Hawkins, admiral of the fleet, is the patriarch of\nPlymouth seamen, if Drake is the hero.",
        "26. “So they push through the crowd, wherein is many another man whom\nwe would gladly have spoken with face to face on earth. Martin\nFrobisher and John Davis are sitting on that bench, smoking tobacco\nfrom long silver pipes; and by them are Fenton and Wishington, who\nhave both tried to follow Drake’s path around the world, and failed,\nthough by no fault of their own. The short, prim man, in the huge\nyellow ruff, is Richard Hawkins, the admiral’s hereafter famous son.",
        "27. “But hark! the boom of a single gun seaward directs the attention\nof every one to a small armed vessel staggering up the sound under a\npress of canvas. A boat puts off; its oars flash quickly in the sun;\nthe captain lands, and, inquiring for the lord high admiral, is\nquickly brought into his presence. He has discovered the formidable\narray of the Spaniards bearing down with the wind like so many\nfloating castles, the ocean seeming to groan under the weight of their\nheavy burdens. The lord high admiral proposes to hold counsel with his\nprincipal officers; but, says Drake, with a hearty laugh: ’Let us play\nout our play; there will be plenty of time to win the game and beat\nthe Spaniards, too.’",
        "28. “The game was played out steadily, and, the last cast having been\nthrown, Drake and his comrades leaped into their boats and rowed\nswiftly to their respective ships. With so much skill did Howard and\nhis lieutenants direct the movements of their squadrons that, before\nmorning, sixty of the best English ships had warped out of Plymouth\nHarbor.”",
        "29. While preparations had been made to meet the Armada, there seems\nto have been a half expectation on the part of the government that\nsomething would occur to prevent its sailing. Until the very last,\nElizabeth and her counselors appeared to place more confidence in\ndiplomacy and political combinations than in the powers of Sir Francis\nDrake and his coadjutors. So, when the Armada was seen off the coast,\nthe signal-fires were kindled, and the whole kingdom was soon ablaze.\nThe stirring verse of Macaulay best describes the spread of the news,\nthe alarm, the anxiety, and the grand uprising of the whole people.",
        "  30. Attend, all ye who list to bear\n    Our noble England’s praise;\n  I tell of the thrice-famous deeds\n    She wrought in ancient days,\n  When that great fleet invincible\n    Against her bore in vain\n  The richest spoils of Mexico,\n    The stoutest hearts of Spain.\n\n  31. It was about the lovely close\n    Of a warm summer day,\n  There carne a gallant merchant-ship\n    Full sail to Plymouth Bay;\n  Her crew hath seen Castile’s black fleet,\n    Beyond Aurigny’s isle,\n  At earliest twilight, on the waves,\n    Lie heaving many a mile.\n\n  32. At sunrise she escaped their van,\n    By God’s especial grace;\n  And the tall Pinta, till the noon,\n    Had held her close in chase.\n\n  33. Forthwith a guard at every gun\n    Was placed along the wall;\n  The beacon blazed upon the roof\n    Of Edgecumbe’s lofty hall;\n  Many a light fishing-bark put out\n    To ply along the coast,\n  And with loose rein and bloody spur\n    Rode inland many a post.\n\n  34. With his white hair unbonneted,\n    The stout old sheriff comes;\n  Before him march the halberdiers;\n    Behind him sound the drums;\n  His yeomen round the market cross\n    Make clear an ample space;\n  For there behooves him to set up\n    The standard of her Grace.\n\n  43. At once on all her stately gates\n    Arose the answering fires;\n  At once the wild alarum clashed\n    From all her reeling spires;\n  From all the batteries of the Tower\n    Pealed loud the voice of fear;\n  And all the thousand masts of Thames\n    Sent back a louder cheer\n\n  44. And from the farthest wards was heard\n    The rush of hurrying feet,\n  And the broad streams of pikes and flags\n    Rushed down each roaring street;\n  And broader still became the blaze,\n    And louder still the din,\n  As fast from every village round\n    The horse came spurring in:\n\n  45. And eastward straight from wild Blackheath\n    The warlike errand went,\n  And roused in many an ancient hall\n    The gallant squires of Kent.\n  Southward from Surrey’s pleasant hills\n    Flew those bright couriers forth;\n  High on bleak Hampstead’s swarthy moor\n    They started for the north;\n\n  46. And on, and on, without a pause\n    Untired they bounded still;\n  All night from tower to tower they sprang:\n    They sprang from hill to hill:\n  Till the proud peak unfurled the flag\n    O’er Darwin’s rocky dales,\n  Till like volcanoes flared to heaven\n    The stormy hills of Wales;\n\n  47. Till twelve fair counties saw the blaze\n    On Malvern’s lonely height,\n  Till streamed in crimson on the wind\n    The Wrekin’s crest of light,\n  Till broad and fierce the star came forth\n    On Ely’s stately fame,\n  And tower and hamlet rose in arms\n    O’er all the boundless plain;\n\n  48. Till Belvoir’s lordly terraces\n    The sign to Lincoln sent,\n  And Lincoln sped the message on\n    O’er the wide vale of Trent;\n  Till Skiddaw saw the fire that burned\n    On Gaunt’s embattled pile,\n  And the red glare on Skiddaw roused\n    The burghers of Carlisle.",
        "49. It was on Saturday, July 20th, a dull, misty day, that the two\ngreat fleets, which represented the cause of freedom on the one side\nand the longing after universal empire on the other, came in sight of\neach other. The great Armada, with its huge galleons in battle array\nextending over a space of many miles, was suffered to sail up the\nChannel, past Plymouth Harbor, without molestation. This was in\naccordance with the general plan of attack which bad been agreed upon.",
        "50. The superior force of the Spaniards caused no fear, but rather a\ngrim determination to overwhelm and destroy. The universal sentiment\nthat seemed to prevail among all classes of Englishmen concerning\ntheir country finds fitting expression in the words which Shakespeare\nputs into the mouth of John of Gaunt:",
        "  “This royal throne of kings, this sceptered isle,\n   This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,\n   This other Eden, demi-paradise;\n   This fortress, built by Nature for herself\n   Against infection and the hand of war;\n   This happy breed of men, this little world;\n   This precious stone set in the silver sea,\n   Which serves it in the office of a wall,\n   Or as a moat defensive to a house,\n   Against the envy of less happier lands;\n   This blessed spot, this earth, this realm, this England,\n   Dear for her reputation through the world.”",
        "51. To guard this favored spot, and to protect its soil from the\npolluting footstep of the hated Spaniard, mariners went forth to do or\ndie. It was now, in the moment of supreme peril, that the courage,\nhardihood, and skill of England’s great navigators gained in battle\nwith the elements in the unknown seas of the North and West, and in\nmany a strife against fearful odds with their Spanish foes, were found\nto be equal to the occasion and sufficient to insure the safety of\ntheir country.",
        "52. On Sunday morning, July 21st, the English ships commenced their\nattacks upon their unwieldy antagonists. “The Spanish ships,” says\nMotley, “seemed arrayed for a pageant in honor of a victory won.\nArranged in the form of a crescent whose horns were seven miles\nasunder, those gilded towers and floating castles, with their\nbrilliant standards and martial music, bore slowly up the Channel.

        "53. “And just as the gaddy hovers about and stings the horse, which is\nall unable to escape from its tiny enemy; so round the heavy galleons\nand unwieldy ships of Spain the light English vessels, commanded by\nable and experienced seamen, hovered with the utmost freedom. Their\nsuperior tactics soon obtained the advantage of the wind, enabling\nthem at intervals to cannonade their enemies with great effect, while\nthey themselves escaped out of range at pleasure, and easily avoided\nthe tremendous discharge of the Spanish ordnance.",
        "54. “In vain the Golden Duke attempted to bring on a general\nengagement. Howard and Drake were well aware that in a ship-to-ship\nfight the strongest would necessarily conquer, and that their only\nhope of success lay in keeping close upon the enemy’s flanks, or\nfollowing at his heels, cutting off a stray galleon, making a dash\ninto his ill-managed squadrons, and so gradually but surely reducing\nhis strength, until they could venture to give him battle on more\nequal terms.”",
        "55. “The Armada,” Mr. Fronde says, “made sail and attempted to close.\nTo Medina Sidonia’s extreme astonishment, it seemed at the pleasure of\nthe English to leave him or allow him to approach them as they chose.\nThe high-towered, broad-bowed galleons moved like Thames barges piled\nwith hay, while the sharp, low English ships sailed at near two feet\nto the Spaniards’ one and shot away, as if by magic, in the eye of the\nwind. It was as if a modern steam fleet was engaged with a squadron of\nthe old-fashioned sailing vessels, choosing their own distance, and\nfighting or not fighting, as suited their convenience.",
        "56. “Astonished and confounded, as well by the manoeuvring as by the\nrapidity of the English fire, the Spanish officers could not refuse\ntheir admiration. They knew they were inferior at sea, but had not\nfully realized their inferiority, notwithstanding the lessons Drake,\nHawkins, Cavendish, and others had already taught them. But here were\nthe English firing four shots to their one, while their ships were so\nnimble that, with a fresh breeze, even the swiftest of the Spanish\nships could not touch there. Such splendid gunners and skillful seamen\nthe Spaniards had never seen before, and were hardly able to believe\nin their existence.”",
        "57. The wind was from the west, so that the English fleet were able to\nkeep to the windward, giving them an increased advantage over their\nantagonists. The Spanish gunners, drafted from the army, could not\nmanage the naval ordnance, and their shots flew high and scarcely\ntouched the English ships. On the other hand, the Spanish vessels were\nriddled with shot, and men fell killed and wounded on every side. But\nthe ships were too strongly built to be easily destroyed, and so the\nmonsters continued to receive fearful blows, and sailed wearily and\nhelplessly on. Toward night, Medina Sidonia, finding it impossible to\nbring on a general engagement, signaled to make sail up the Channel,\nthe rear to be covered by the squadron under his second in command,\nDon Martinez de Recaldi.",
        "58. “The wind was now rising and promised a squally evening. The\nEnglish ships withdrew for want of powder. An express was sent up to\nLondon for a fresh supply. A fast boat was dispatched to Lord Harry\nSeymour, who commanded a fleet of coasters farther up the Channel,\nwith a letter reporting progress so far, and bidding him be on the\nalert. But the misfortunes of the Spaniards were not yet over. The\nCapitana, one of their largest galleons, fouled with another vessel\nand broke her bow-sprit. She fell behind, and was left to her fate.\nIn the morning Drake took possession of her, and found many casks of\nreals, and, what was of more importance, some tons of gunpowder, with\nwhich the Roebuck, the swiftest traveler of the fleet, flew to the\nlord admiral.",
        "59. “Shortly after dark another serious accident occurred. The\nofficers of one of the great galleons, impatient and irritated at the\nresults of the action, were quarreling with one another. The captain\nstruck the master-gunner with a stick. The gunner, who was from\nHolland, went below in a rage, thrust a burning linstock, or long\nmatch, into a powder-barrel, and sprang through a port-hole into the\nsea. The deck was blown off from stem to stern. Two hundred seamen and\nsoldiers were sent into the air: some fell into the water and were\ndrowned; some, scorched or mutilated, dropped back into the wreck. The\nship, which was one of the largest in the fleet, was built so strongly\nthat she survived the shock, and at day-light the English took\npossession of her. At the bottom of the hold were many barrels of\npowder, which Lord Howard so sorely needed.”",
        "60. On the morning of July 22d the Spanish admiral saw the remainder\nof the English fleet coming up from Plymouth Harbor, and he made all\nsail up the Channel. Owing to the want of powder, the attack of the\nEnglish was less vigorous than on the day before, but still they\ndogged the Spaniards in the most persevering manner, and succeeded in\ninflicting serious damage upon many of the Spanish vessels. The breeze\nfrom the west still continued, but it was light, and the fleets made\nbut little headway during the day.",
        "61. On Tuesday, July 23d, a strong morning breeze sprang up from the\neast, and the Spaniards found themselves for the first time to the\nwindward. Taking advantage of the situation, they bore down upon the\nEnglish fleet, and tried to bring on a general engagement. This\nchallenge the English would not accept, and stood out to sea toward\nthe west. The Spaniards thought they were retreating, and gave chase.\nAll the galleons were bad sailers, but some were better than others,\nand soon the San Marcus outstripped her consorts. When several miles\nahead of all her companions the wind shifted to the west, leaving the\nEnglish to the windward. Lord Howard immediately bore down in his\nflag-ship, the Ark, and attacked the San Marcus, but she defended\nherself with great bravery, and for an hour and a half fought\nsingle-handed, delivering eighty shots and receiving five hundred. His\npowder again giving out, Lord Howard was obliged to withdraw. This\naction was fought off Plymouth Harbor, so that in the three days’\nfight the Armada had made no substantial progress toward its\ndestination.",
        "62. “By this time the news that the Armada was in the Channel had\ncirculated throughout the length and breadth of England, and from\nevery creek and port and harbor came accession of goodly ships,\nequipped at the cost of leading squires and nobles, and manned by her\n’best blood.’ From Lyme and Weymouth and Poole and the Isle of Wight,\nyoung lords and gentlemen came streaming out in every smack or sloop\nthey could lay hold of, to snatch their share of danger and glory at\nHoward’s side. The strength which they were able to add was little or\nnothing, but they brought enthusiasm; they brought to the half-starved\ncrews the sense that the heart of all England was with them, and this\nassurance transformed every seaman into a hero.",
        "63. “On Tuesday evening, after the fight, Medina Sidonia counted a\nhundred sail behind him, and he observed, with some uneasiness, that\nthe numbers were continually increasing. On Wednesday, July 24th, the\nweather was calm, and the English lay idle at a short distance from\nthe Armada waiting for powder.",
        "64. “Thursday, July 25th, was the feast-day of Spain’s patron saint,\nSt. Jago; of him who, mounted on a milk-white steed, had ridden in\nfore-front of battle in one of the Spanish encounters with the Moors,\nand had led them to victory. Should nothing on this holy day be done\nin his honor by those whom he had so greatly favored? It was decided\nto make an attack. The galleys led the way, and in their van rode\nthree of the four great galliasses, thrashing the sea to foam with\nthree hundred oars apiece. The English met them with such tremendous\ndischarges of chain-shot that, had not the wind risen about noon,\nenabling the Spanish ships to come up to their assistance, the galleys\nwould surely have been taken. When the lord admiral withdrew his\nships, the Spaniards were so cowed that they made no attempt to pursue\nthem.”",
        "65. “Thus,” says Canon Kingsley, “the fight had thundered on the\nlive-long afternoon, beneath the virgin cliffs of Freshwater, on the\nIsle of Wight, while myriad sea fowl rose screaming from every ledge,\nand with their black wings spotted the snow-white walls of chalk; and\nthe lone shepherd hurried down the slopes above to peer over the dizzy\nledge, and forgot the wheat-ear fluttering in his snare, while,\ntrembling, he gazes upon glimpses of tall masts and gorgeous flags,\npiercing at times the league-broad veil of sulphur-smoke which\nweltered far below.”",
        "66. Friday, July 26th, was a tranquil summer day. The wind died away,\nand the two fleets, but a few miles apart, lay rocking on the waves.\nThe Duke of Medina Sidonia took advantage of the pause and sent a\nswift messenger to the Prince of Parma, praying him to dispatch to his\nassistance forty small sailing-vessels, capable of contending with the\nlight swift craft of the English. All the next day, July 27th, the two\nfleets sailed slowly up the Channel in hostile but silent\ncompanionship–the Spaniard convinced he could not meet the Englishman\nin open fight; the Englishman heedful that he should not be surrounded\nby a superior force. At night the battered and maltreated Armada took\nrefuge in the harbor of Calais.",
        "67. The same afternoon Lord Howard was joined by Sir Harry Seymour\nwith his squadron of sixteen vessels, which bad been keeping watch\nalong the eastern ports, and the combined fleet dropped anchor to the\neastward of Calais, and within a mile and a half of the French shore.\n\"Never, since England was England,” says Mr. Motley, “had such a sight\nbeen seen as now revealed itself in those narrow straits between Dover\nand Calais. Along that low, sandy shore, and quite within the range of\nthe Calais fortifications, one hundred and thirty Spanish ships–the\ngreater number of them the largest and most heavily armed in the\nworld–lay face to face, and scarcely out of cannon-shot, with one\nhundred and fifty English sloops and frigates, the strongest and\nswiftest that the island could furnish, and commanded by men whose\nexploits had rung through the world.",
        "68. “Farther along the coast, invisible but known to be performing a\nmost perilous and vital service, was a squadron of Dutch vessels of\nall sizes lining both the outer and inner of the sand-banks of the\nFlemish coasts and swarming in all the estuaries and inlets of that\nintricate and dangerous cruising-ground between Dunkirk and\nTexel. Those fleets of Holland and Zealand, numbering some one hundred\nand fifty galleons, sloops, and fly-boats, lay patiently blockading\nevery possible egress from the ports in possession of the Duke of\nParma, and longing to grapple with him as soon as his fleet of\ngunboats and hoys, packed with his Spanish and Italian veterans,\nshould venture to set forth upon the sea for their long-meditated\nenterprise.”",
        "69. This friendly attitude of the Dutch to the English was due to a\nvariety of causes. Both nations represented the new religion in its\nstruggle against the established church. In consequence of the\nterrible atrocities of the Duke of Alva, the Dutch had an\ninextinguishable hatred for the Spaniards, and were ready to do\nanything to thwart their plans and diminish their power. Then, too,\nthe Dutch remembered how the ships of Elizabeth, laden with\nprovisions, had brought succor to their beleaguered cities and saved\nthe lives of their famished people. So, animated by enmity on the one\nside and by gratitude on the other, the Dutch for a time forgot their\nstruggle for maritime supremacy with the English, and brought all\ntheir force to bear to support the English cause in its hour of\ngreatest need.",
        "70. The Spaniards seem never to have anticipated this energetic action\non the part of the Dutch. The Duke of Medina Sidonia now found that he\ncould get no direct sea communication with the Spanish land-forces;\nand the Duke of Parma found himself in a situation where his\ninvincible army was powerless, and his soldierly experience and\ntalents were of no avail. The plans of the Spanish admiral to make use\nof the small vessels of Parma had been thwarted by the Dutch, and the\ndispersion of the Dutch vessels had been prevented by the fierce\nattack of Howard and Drake upon the Armada.",
        "71. In coming to anchor on that Saturday night in Calais Harbor,\nhowever, the Spaniards had gained two important points. Their ships\nwere under the protection of friendly land-batteries; and nothing\nremained to prevent the co-operation of the land-forces and the fleet.\nThe Duke of Parma could march his forces westward and embark from\nCalais instead of Dunkirk, and thus turn the flank of the Dutch fleet.",
        "72. Sunday, July 29th, was a day of suspense and anxiety on the part\nof both the contending forces. The English knew that a junction with\nParma was now possible, and Howard and Drake were too good seamen not\nto know that, in a close and general engagement, the superior size,\nweight, and numbers of the Spanish ships would prevail. On the other\nhand, the Spaniards knew that they were in an unsafe harbor should a\nstrong wind spring up from the west, and Medina Sidonia began to have\na wholesome dread of the valor and strength which guarded the homes of\nBritain. The day passed in Sabbath quiet and repose, and when the sun\nset there was no indication that a night’s strife was to follow,\npotential as shaping the future destinies of both Spain and England.",
        "73. During the day, Captain Winter, of the English fleet, suggested\nthat the Spaniards might be driven from their anchorage by fire-ships,\nand his plan was adopted. Six vessels were loaded with wild-fire,\nrosin, pitch, brimstone, and other combustibles, and made ready to\nsail. The night was dark, with indications in sky and sea of a coming\ngale. “When the Spanish bells,” says Froude, “were about striking\ntwelve, and, save the watch on deck, soldiers and seamen lay stretched\nin sleep, certain dark objects, which had been seen dimly drifting in\nthe tide near where the galleons lay thickest, shot suddenly into\npyramids of light, flames leaping from ruddy sail to sail, flickering\non the ropes and forecastles, masts and bow-sprits, a lurid blaze of\nconflagration.",
        "74. “A cool commander might have ordered out his boats and towed the\nfire-ships clear; but Medina Sidonia, with a strain already upon him\nbeyond the strength of his capacity, saw coming some terrible engine\nof destruction, like the floating mine which had shattered Parma’s\nbridge at Antwerp. Panic spread through the entire Armada. Hasty and\nimpetuous cries arose on board each menaced vessel. ’Up anchors,\ncomrades! Out every stitch of canvas! Away, away! for in the track of\nthose blazing ships follow death and ruin!’",
        "75. “There are times when immense bodies of men suddenly give way to\nthe influence of a needless but over-mastering panic, and this was one\nof them. Every cable was cut; galleon, galliasse, and patache drove\nhurriedly through the press of shipping, each heedless of its\ncomrade’s danger, and seeking frantically some channel of escape. In\nvain the Duke of Medina Sidonia attempted to reform his disordered\narray. So long as the darkness lasted, the confusion prevailed; and\nship after ship reeled, staggered, and drifted out to sea. Several of\nthe Spanish ships were disabled, two were burned, and it was not until\nthey found themselves six miles from shore, and at a secure distance\nfrom the smoldering hulks, that they recovered from their terror.”",
        "76. On Monday, July 29th, when the day dawned, Lord Howard discovered\nthe Spanish fleet in great disorder, scattered over a wide space in\nthe Channel. He immediately ordered an advance, and, while Drake made\na bold attack upon the main body of the enemy, the lord high admiral\ndrove upon the sands several of the sluggard vessels of the Armada\nwhich the fire-ships had failed to drive out to sea. For several hours\nhe engaged the great galliasse under the direct command of Admiral\nMoncada, which was aground upon the sands. The vessel was captured and\nMoncada slain, and the English admiral hastened to the assistance of\nDrake.",
        "77. “It was well,” says Froude, “that no more time was wasted over so\nsmall a matter. Lord Howard had already delayed too long for his fame.\nIt was no time for the admiral of the fleet to be loitering over a\nstray feather which had dropped from the enemy’s plume when every ship\nwas imperiously needed for a far more important service. Medina\nSidonia intended to return to Calais, but his ships had drifted in the\nnight far to the east, and before his signal of return could be obeyed\nthe English fleet was upon them.",
        "78. “Sir Henry Seymour, with his sixteen ships, having the advantage\nof wind, speed, and skill, came upon a cluster of Spanish galleons at\neight in the morning. Reserving their fire till within a hundred and\ntwenty yards, and wasting no cartridges, the English ships continued\nthrough the entire forenoon to pour upon them one continuous rain of\nshot. They were driven together, and became entangled in a confused\nand helpless mass.",
        "79. “Drake, in the mean time, had fallen upon a score of galleons\nunder the direct command of Medina Sidonia himself. They were better\nhandled than the rest, and were endeavoring to keep sea-room and\nretain some command of themselves. But their wretched sailing powers\nput them to a disadvantage, for which no skill or courage could\ncompensate. The English were always at windward of them; and, hemmed\nin at every turn, they, too, were forced back upon their consorts,\nhunted together as a shepherd hunts sheep upon a common, and the whole\nmass of them were forced slowly eastward, away from the only harbor\nopen to them, and into the unknown waters of the North Sea.",
        "80. “Howard came up at noon to join in the work of destruction. The\nSpaniards’ gun-practice, always bad, was helpless beyond all past\nexperience. From eight o’clock in the morning until sunset the\nEnglish, almost untouched themselves, fired into them without\nintermission at short range. They ceased only when the last cartridge\nwas spent, and every man was weary with labor. They took no prizes,\nand they attempted to take none. Their orders were to sink and\ndestroy. They saw three great galleons go down, and three more drift\ntoward the sands, where their destruction was certain.",
        "81. “On board the Spanish ships all was consternation and despair.\nToward sunset the great Santa Maria went down with all on board. When\nthe ships’ companies were called over, it was discovered that no less\nthan four thousand men had been killed or drowned, and twice as many\nwounded. The survivors were so utterly dispirited that nothing could\ninduce them to face England’s sea-kings again.”",
        "82. On Tuesday afternoon, July 30th, Lord Howard summoned a council of\nwar, which decided upon a course of action. Lord Henry Seymour with\nhis squadron was to return to guard the mouth of the Thames against\nany attempt on the part of Parma, while the remainder of the fleet was\nto continue the chase of the Armada. Ninety vessels, under Howard,\nDrake, and Frobisher, followed the flying Spaniards into the North\nSea. “We have the army of Spain before us,” Drake wrote, “and hope,\nwith the grace of God, to wrestle a fall with him. There was never\nanything pleased me better than seeing the enemy flying with a\nsoutherly wind to the northward. God grant you have a good eye to the\nDuke of Parma, for, if we live, I doubt not to handle the matter with\nthe Duke of Sidonia, as he shall wish himself at St. Mary’s Port,\namong his orange-trees!”",
        "83. The wind, now strong from the south, had risen to a gale. The\nSpanish ships, so fashioned as to sail only before the wind, were\ndriven northward. Between them and the shore, where lay possible\nsafety, was the dreadful English fleet, which had battered them so\nsorely during the past ten days. Before them was the sea, full of\nunknown perils. “Not only man but God was against them. His wind blew\ndiscomfiture to their meditated enterprise. More than one poor;\ncrippled ship dropped behind as her spars snapped, or the water made\nits way through her wounded seams in the straining seas. The\nSpaniards, stricken with a wonderful fear, made no attempt to succor\ntheir consorts, but pressed heavily on, leaving them to founder.”",
        "84. The pursuit continued until Friday, August 2d. There was now no\nmore danger to be apprehended from the scattered enemy. The wind was\nthreatening, and, the supply of provisions beginning to fail, Howard\nand Drake determined on returning homeward, leaving a couple of\npinnaces to dog the Spaniards past the Scottish isles. Though the wind\nwas contrary, they beat back against it without loss, and in four or\nfive days the vessels, with their half-starved crews, all safely\narrived in Margate Roads, having done the noblest service that fleet\never rendered to a country in the hour of supreme peril.",
        "85. Meanwhile, so much as remained of the Invincible Armada was\nbuffeted to and fro by the resistless gale, like a shuttlecock between\ntwo invisible players. The monster left its bones on the iron-bound\nshore of Norway and on the granite cliffs of the Hebrides. Its course\ncould be traced by its wrecks. Day followed day, and still God’s wrath\nendured. On the 5th of August Admiral Oguendo, in his flag-ship,\ntogether with one of the great galliasses and thirty-eight other\nvessels, were driven by the fury of the tempest upon the rocks and\nreefs of Ireland, and nearly every soul on board perished. Of one\nhundred and thirty-four vessels which, gay with gold and amid\ntriumphal shouts and loud music, had sailed from Corunna July 12th,\nonly fifty-three battered and useless hulks returned to the ports of\nSpain.",
        "86. The fate and exploits of the Armada are graphically summed up in\nthe emphatic language of Sir Francis Drake. “It is happily\nmanifested,” he says, “indeed, to all nations how their navy which\nthey termed invincible, consisting of nearly one hundred and forty\nsail of ships, were by thirty of her Majesty’s ships of war, and a few\nof our own merchants, by the wise and advantageous conduct of Lord\nCharles Howard, High Admiral of England, beaten and shuffled together\nfrom Lizard in Cornwall to Portland, from Portland to Calais; and from\nCalais, driven by squibs from their anchors, were chased out of sight\nof England, round about Scotland and Ireland. With all their great and\nterrible ostentation, they did not, in all their sailing round about\nEngland, so much as sink or take one ship, bark, pinnace, or cock-boat\nof ours, or even burn so much as one sheep-cote on the land.”",
        "1. Through the middle ages England, like the rest of the world, had\nbeen in full communion with the Church of Rome. When the Reformation\nhad swept over Europe and left dissent to crystallize into various\nProtestant sects, England too had dissented, and her king had\nestablished the Anglican Church. This church, when it assumed final\nform, had for its supreme head, not the pope, but the king, and under\nhim the clergy held their offices. The Roman Catholic ritual was not,\nas in some of the European sects, entirely given up, but was modified\nto suit the new order. And when the change was effected, the new\nministers firm in their positions, the new service-books ready for\nuse, then the Catholics were summarily ordered to embrace the reformed\nfaith.",
        "2. At that time it had not dawned upon the world that there might be\nmore than one way to worship God in truth. Catholics honestly believed\nthat Protestants were going straight to perdition, and Protestants as\nhonestly believed that a like fate was in store for the pope and his\nfollowers. When this was the temper of conviction, the natural thing\nfor each church to do was to persecute every other; not from hate, but\nfrom the benevolent determination to oblige men to accept the true\nreligion and save their souls, even though it might be necessary in\nthe course of proceedings to burn their bodies. Mixed with this\nlegitimate missionary spirit were all sorts of political motives. The\nchurch, whether Catholic or Protestant, was closely connected with the\nstate, and through all the corruptions of party politics religion had\nto be dragged.",
        "3. So, when the English state established Protestantism, its first\nduty and interest was to suppress Catholicism. After two Protestant\nkings, a Catholic queen came to the throne, and with her the\nProtestants fell and the Catholics rose. The former were forbidden\ntheir service, their ministers were turned out of their positions;\nfines, imprisonment, burning punished those who held out against the\n\"true faith.” Again the scene changed. The queen died, and by her\nProtestant successor freedom of worship was denied to Catholics, and\nthe Anglican Church was re-established as the Church of England.",
        "4. Meantime, in the Church of England a spirit of criticism had grown\nup. Stricter thinkers disliked the imposing ceremonies which the\nEnglish church still retained: some of the ministers ceased to wear\ngowns in preaching, performed the marriage ceremony without using a\nring, and were in favor of simplifying all the church service.\nUnpretentious workers began to tire of the everlasting quarreling, and\nto long for a religion simple and quiet. These soon met trouble, for\nthe rulers had decided that salvation was by the Church of England, as\nthe sovereign, its head, should order. Dissent was the two-fold guilt\nof heresy and revolution–sin against God and crime against the king\nand English law. They were forbidden to preach at all if they would\nnot wear a gown during service, and the people who went to hear them\nwere punished. This treatment caused serious thought among the\n\"non-conformists,” as they were called, and, once thinking, they soon\nconcluded that the king had no such supreme right to order the church,\nand the church had over its ministers no such right of absolute\ndictation.",
        "5. Various sects sprang up, called by various names, differing among\nthemselves upon minor points, but agreeing more or less in dissent\nfrom the full, unquestioned rule and service of the Episcopal Church.\nAgainst all these dissenters the laws acted as against the Catholics.\nNot only must Englishmen be Protestants, they must be Protestants of\nthe Church of England. Bodies were organized to keep strict watch of\nthe non-conformists. They were forbidden their simpler church worship\nand fined if they did not attend that of the English Church. They were\n\"scoffed and scorned by the profane multitude, and so vexed, as truly\ntheir affliction was not small.”",
        "6. Among that division of the non-conformists called Puritans was a\nlittle congregation at Scrooby, a town in north England. The pastor\nwas John Robinson, wise, kind, dignified, scholarly; and his helper in\nchurch work and government was Elder William Brewster, a college man\nwho had served at the royal court. For the rest, the congregation were\nmainly Bible-reading farmers, who wished only to live in peace\naccording to Bible teaching. Royal servants were watchful, and an open\nchurch was out of the question; but every Sunday they met for service\nwherever they could, sometimes in Elder Brewster’s big house,\nsometimes out-doors, anywhere so that they might listen to their\nbeloved pastor. During the week they worked their farms, thinking and\ntalking of the iniquities of the Catholics, the impurities of the\nEpiscopalians, the hard ways that beset the Puritans, and the\nrighteous God who looked down upon it all to record and avenge.",
        "7. Quiet as such a simple church in a corner of England must have\nbeen, it was not left undisturbed. Priests of the dominant church and\nofficers of the civil service soon pounced down with the demand that\nthe Puritan farmers stop all this “new-fangledness,” and return to the\nways of the loyal church. John Robinson’s people, however, had no\nnotion of giving up their new-fangledness. They possessed a full share\nof English obstinacy, and, backed in it by their consciences, were not\nlikely to surrender at once. So their troubles began. They were hunted\nand persecuted on every side. Some were clapped into prisons, others\nhad their houses beset and watched night and day, and hardly escaped\ntheir hands, and the most were fain to fly and leave their houses and\nhabitations and the means of their livelihood.",
        "8. What shall we do? thought the distressed farmers. We can not live\nin such persecution. We will have to go away. Give up? Indeed, no! We\nshall not belie our consciences for any man. Since God is behind us,\nwe will not conform. And, under opposition and injustice, Puritan lips\nset themselves rigid, Puritan hearts closed against the persecutors,\nstrong reaction from the beautiful ceremonies and graceful living that\ncould hide such unbrotherliness became almost worship of unloveliness\nand hardship. In after years the lives of their descendants were\nshaped into a narrow severity, not drawn from the sweetness and light\nof the gospel which they read, but from the bitter fountains of their\nearly sufferings and wrongs.",
        "9. What shall we do? cried the harassed farmers. We will have to leave\nour home and go to Holland, where others like us have already gone,\nand where, we hear, is freedom of religion for all men. Yet how should\nthey get there? “for, though they could not stay, yet were they not\nsuffered to go.” And, if they should get there, how could they, who\n\"had only been used to a plain country life and the innocent trade of\nhusbandry,” manage to live in a country where people spoke an\noutlandish language instead of good English, and earned their money by\ntrade.",
        "10. Somehow God would help. Give up their religion they would not.\nThey set about going. They bribed ship captains, feed the sailors,\npaid unreasonable rates for passage, and then, deserted by these same\ncaptains and sailors, tried it again with others, were betrayed into\nthe hands of officers who rifled them of what money they had left and\nturned them over to prison. Hard luck! Set free from prison, they\nbargained with a Dutchman to take them in his ship to Holland, but as\nthey were going aboard a company of armed men surprised them, and the\nDutchman, afraid to be seen in such company, hastily sailed away with\nhalf the “Pilgrims,” leaving the rest terrified on the shore.",
        "11. “Take us back!” cried the men. “Don’t you see our wives and\nchildren crying after us!” But the Dutchman was afraid of the\nsoldiers. “What will they do without us!” cried the men, straining\ntheir eyes to see all that was happening on shore. “Our goods are not\nyet aboard–take us back!” No use. The Dutchman sailed away, and the\nsoldiers carried off the frightened women and children to prison. When\nthe authorities had them safely locked up, they did not know what to\ndo with silly women and helpless children, who cried for their\nhusbands and fathers, and when asked concerning their homes cried the\nmore and declared they hadn’t any; and, after making themselves\nsufficient trouble, they solved the important problem by letting the\nridiculous creatures go again. The Dutchman’s ship, through a terrible\nstorm, came to land. The distressed husbands sought the distressed\nwives, and troublous wanderings ended in reunion. So were they\ncontinually thwarted; but, by one means or another, determined wills\nbent circumstances to their end, and at last they reached Holland.",
        "12. Strangers as they were, destitute, all unused to the new life and\npeople, they had trouble enough at first, but they wasted little time\nstaring at the new world. It was a world they were to become a part of\nas soon as possible, and, with characteristic earnestness, they fell\nto work at any thing they found to do. After a year in Amsterdam they\nsettled in Leyden. They made them homes. They learned as best they\ncould the uncouth language. They taught their farmer hands\nunaccustomed crafts, and applied their farmer heads to the mysteries\nof trade.",
        "13. Elder Brewster, with the tastes and habits of a gentleman, a\nrapidly diminishing property, and a large family of children, looked\nabout for work, and presently obtained pupils whom he taught English\nafter an original method. Later he set up a printing-press, and in\nprinting Puritan books, forbidden to be published in England, found\nplenty to do. Mr. Robinson visited his people and was busy for their\nwelfare, preached, studied, wrote books; he was a kind friend and\nhelper, and a scholar besides, and proud of him were his devoted\nflock.",
        "14. Leyden Dutchmen looked with curiosity upon the knot of plain\nforeigners, sober men, quiet women, children named after all the Bible\nsaints and heavenly virtues. Bibles they brought and evidently read.\nIt was rumored that together every morning and before each meal each\nhousehold held service of prayer, and long sermons and various\ndevotions wholly filled the Sabbath. Queer people, meditated the\nHollanders. But they soon found that it was safe to trust the Bible\nreaders. Though they were peculiar about Sunday, they were\nsurprisingly certain to keep their promises, and for all their\npropensity to pray without ceasing they made most faithful workmen.\nSuperintendents sought them for laborers, merchants willingly gave\nthem credit; and with the passing years they became settled and\nquietly prosperous. The Bibles were not neglected, the daily prayers\nand weekly sermons were methodically attended.",
        "15. The unpretentious people were not unobserved. Many from England\ncame to enjoy like freedom of worship, and far outside of Leyden John\nRobinson’s learning was known. When Arminians and Calvinists fell into\nhot disputes, and Leyden ministers and university professors held\npublic meetings twice a week to settle knotty points of doctrine, John\nRobinson was always there, listening eagerly to both sides. Many a\nfamous talk he bad with the ministers and professors. We must have Mr.\nRobinson confute the Arminians, cried his friends among themselves.",
        "16. So on a day the Puritan pastor, somewhat demurring because he was\na foreigner, yet withal not loath to ride a tilt with the enemy,\nconfronted Episcopus, the Arminian professor; and it is reported by\nthe Calvinists that his overwhelming arguments utterly nonplussed and\nput the great Episcopus to rout. Oh, those theological debates! About\nthe paltry affairs of this world it was not right to quarrel. When\npersonal considerations were at stake, Puritan worthies could bridle\nthe tongue; but when was called in question some keenly felt phase of\nthe truth, some doctrine their precious Bible seemed to teach, then\nthe repressed fire burst into legitimate flame, and righteous\nindignation with magnificent effect hurled back and forth the\nthunderbolts of prophecy and psalm.",
        "17. After some eleven or twelve years of this life in Leyden the\nPuritans began to grow restless. Holland was not home to them, and\nthey were lonely. Some of them were growing old, and the somber burden\nof poverty and exile began to weary the brave shoulders. The children\nwere growing up, and hard work and cramped life pressed all too\nseverely upon the young natures, so that they either threw off the\nyoke and turned to bad ways or, bearing it patiently, missed the\nchance of education and grew old before their time. They feared to\nstay longer in this foreign country lest the children should learn\nfrom the Dutch to break the Sabbath, should lose their native\nlanguage, should cease to be Englishmen.",
        "18. Perhaps it would be best to move again and settle in some land\nunder the flag of dear England–harsh England, that would not grant\nthem peace at home. Though they should have to go to most distant\nregions, they would cheerfully go, and consider themselves God’s\nmissionaries there, if only they might have the protection of\nEngland’s king. They would go and break the way for others of their\ncountrymen less strong, and in America, if need be, prepare an English\nhome for Englishmen.",
        "19. Gravely the elders talked together. The uncongenial life had been\ncheerfully borne; a new uprooting and uncertain change would be as\nsteadfastly carried through, once they were sure God willed it. And at\nlast it seemed best to decide upon removal. “The dangers were great\nbut not desperate, the difficulties were many but not invincible–and\nall of them, through the help of God, by fortitude and patience, might\neither be borne or overcome.” Sturdy courage! O England, to exile\nsuch sons!",
        "20. Where, then, should they go? “I will guide thee,” reads the\npromise of the Puritan’s Bible, and to God they turn in prayer for\ndirection. A general meeting is held, and much discussion results in\nthe decision to cross the Atlantic to Virginia, Great Britain’s vast\nnew realm. They would not settle near the colony already planted\nthere, for that was of the Episcopal Church and might molest them; but\naway by themselves somewhere–anywhere, if only they might nestle in a\nremote corner of their king’s dominions, and on English soil be free\nto follow their own conscience. God and the king was the loyal\nthought–yet, if there must be choice, the king shall not be first.",
        "21. But, sending petition to the king, they found that he would give\nthem no assurance of freedom of worship; it was intimated that, if\nthey did go, the royal eye might be expected to wink at the\nproceeding; but, as for promises, royalty would not commit itself.\nHere was a discouragement. How should they dare break up their homes\nand cross the ocean to an unknown, uncolonized land, with no assurance\nof protection and liberty when they arrived there? But the leaders\nrallied again: “If on the king’s part there is a purpose or desire to\nwrong us,” they cried, “though we had a seal as broad as the\nhouse-floor it would not serve the turn, for there would be means\nenough found to recall or reverse it. . . . We must rest herein on\nGod’s providence, as we have done before.” Not lacking in\ncomprehension of the world’s ways and in canny shrewdness were those\nPuritans!",
        "22. Wearisome negotiations then began with men who should furnish\nmeans for the removal. Back and forth, from Leyden to London, from\nLondon to Leyden, the agents went; letters passed from Robinson and\nBrewster to the London merchants, and from the London merchants back.\nPoor Robert Cushman, agent for the Puritans, experienced numerous\ntribulations; pushed by the merchants to make an agreement, blamed by\nhis friends for going beyond his instructions, his letters defending\nhimself give a spirited glimpse into the harrowed soul of a\nquick-tempered Christian.",
        "23. After months of all this, the arrangements were concluded. A body\nof London merchants agreed to furnish ships and provisions for the\npassage, on certain conditions: for seven years after landing the\nPuritans were to hold all property in common; they were to fish,\nplant, build, and at the end of seven years were to share with the\nmerchants, according to certain specified conditions, the accumulated\nproperty, capital, and profits. Hard terms! But they could not choose,\nand go they must.",
        "24. Who should go? This question agitated the Leyden congregation. Not\nall could take the voyage. Perhaps not all cared to: it was so far, so\nfar! Yet the most were willing, and it remained to select from the\nlarge congregation those most fit for the hard task. There was\ndividing of friend from friend, of husband from wife, of father from\nchild. Elder Brewster would go as their spiritual leader, since the\nbeloved pastor must for the present stay with those who remained,\nhoping later to cross the sea and come to them.",
        "25. A ship, the Speedwell, was fitted up in Holland; another, the\nMayflower, awaited them in England. When all was ready they appointed\na day of solemn fasting and prayer. Pastor Robinson preached to them\n\"a good part of the day” on the text, “And there at the river, by\nAhava, I proclaimed a fast, that we might humble ourselves before our\nGod and seek of him a right way for us and for our children and for\nall our substance,” and “the rest of the time was spent in pouring out\nprayers to the Lord with great fervency mixed with abundance of tears.\n” Again they met together in a “feast” at the pastor’s house. Sorry\nfeasting!",
        "26. The hospitality was large, but hearts were too full for much but\ntears: a tender, painful farewell gathering, their white-haired pastor\ngoing about among them with words of comfort and counsel, gentle last\nsuggestions, scripture texts believed, though the voice that repeats\nthem trembles and breaks–believed and clung to through the tug of\nparting. “Fear thou not, for I am with thee. Be not dismayed, for I am\nthy God. I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will\nuphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness!” “God is our\nrefuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will\nnot we fear, though the earth be removed and though the mountains be\ncarried into the midst of the sea. The Lord of hosts is with us; the\nGod of Jacob is our refuge.” Yes, they believed. And believing, they\nsang through tears–quivering pain notes at first, then, faith\ndominating, the tones grew firmer and sustained, until the final words\nrang out clear and strong; and with the end of the hymn they were\nready for last earnest hand-clasps and quiet good-night.",
        "27. To take ship, they went to Delft Haven, fourteen miles from\nLeyden, and to the port Pastor Robinson, with most of their friends,\naccompanied them. One more night on land, then the long voyage and the\nuncertain future. There was little sleep that night; and again, with\nBible words and Christian counsel, hearts were strengthened.",
        "28. In the morning, the wind being fair, “they went aboard and their\nfriends with them, where truly doleful was the sight of that sad and\nmournful parting, to see what sighs and sobs and prayers did sound\namong them.” We know, we know–God is our refuge–but sore is the\nparting. We are willing–but our hearts are wrung. There is no thought\nof regret or turning–but oh, the pain of it! The Dutchmen, loitering\nin the sunshine on the shore, watching with heavy curiosity this\nstrange departure, suddenly find their own eyes filled with\nsympathetic tears. We must be off! cries the captain, half impatient\nover so much fervency and tears. They kneel around the pastor, and,\nwith unsteady voice, though his trust is firm, he calls upon the God\nin whom they believe to guide and bless these his children. Once more\nthe arms cling close. “Mother, mother, how can I let you go!” “My\nchild, my child!” “Beloved, you will come over to me soon.” “Oh, my\nhusband!” “God wills it; I must go.” “My son, I shall not live to see\nyour face again.” Loosen the clasping arms; unfold the clinging\nfingers. You stay and we go, and the ocean lies between. The wind\ncomes breathing, the sails fill; good-by! good-by! across the widening\nspace–and they are gone.",
        "29. They sailed first to meet the Mayflower and others of the Puritan\ncompany at Southampton, England. There they called Robert Cushman to\naccount, fell out with one of their London patrons, read together an\naffectionate farewell letter from Mr. Robinson, made all final\narrangements for the voyage, and on August 5th, 1620, set sail in the\ntwo ships for America. But the captain of the Speedwell, half-hearted\nin the business, twice had them back to land to repair pretended\nleaks; and the second time, putting in at Plymouth, it was determined\nto leave the Speedwell and a part of the Puritan band. The little\ncompany, small enough before, was again reduced, “like Gideon’s army.\n” Some were discouraged with the many hindrances and willingly stayed;\nsome were beginning to fear for the success of the voyage, undertaken\nso late in the season; some were weak, and, could be spared where\nthere was need of the strongest; some little children were sent back\nto await a later passage; Robert Cushman, vexed to the soul by the\nunsatisfactoriness of his negotiations, sick and disheartened, stayed\nbehind. Again there were sad parting, tears, and prayers; but God\nwould sustain, and, leaving the companion ship and the last friends,\nthe Mayflower sailed from Plymouth, September 6th.",
        "30. One hundred and two “Pilgrims,” seeking a better country: men,\nwomen, children, servants and hand-maidens. Elder William Brewster\nwith his wife Mary, his two sons Love and Wrestling, and a boy,\nRichard More; the Winslows, with two men-servants and Richard More’s\nlittle sister Ellen; William Bradford and his wife Dorothy, their only\nchild being left behind; the Allertons, the Martins, the Whites, with\ntheir son Resolved; Mr. and Mrs. Mullins with their children Joseph\nand Priscilla, and a servant; Mr. Hopkins and his family; Mr. Warren,\nlonely enough without the wife and children left behind; John\nBillington, his wife Ellen, and his two sons; the two Tilley families,\nwith their cousins Henry Samson and Humility Cooper, children whose\nparents were not with them; Mr. Cook and John his son, his wife and\nother children being in England yet, John Rigdale and Alice his wife;\nMiles Standish, bold English soldier, with Rose his wife; John Alden,\nthe cooper, “a hopeful young man and much desired\"; Thomas Tinker,\nwith his wife and child; these and many others in the little ship\nsailed over the wide ocean in search of an English home where\nEnglishmen might freely worship God.",
        "31. The voyage at first was fair enough. They were seasick, some of\nthem; the children had to be watched lest they fall overboard; a\nprofane bully of a sailor, after using all manner of abuse toward the\nsick ones, himself fell ill and died, “And,” says William Bradford,\nrecording it, “thus his curses light on his own head, and it was an\nastonishment to all his fellows, for they noted it to be the just hand\nof God upon him.” Later came storms and danger, with breaking of\nmasts, eager consultation among the ship’s officers, water, wind,\nconfusion; but the masts were mended and they “committed themselves to\nthe will of God and resolved to proceed.” Big John Howland, coming on\ndeck, was thrown into the sea by a lurch of the ship, but with a rope\nwas hauled in again and saved. Before they came to land a little boy\nwas born in the Hopkins family, and they named him Oceanus; and Samuel\nFuller’s servant, a young man named William Butten, died as they\nneared the coast.",
        "32. The hard voyage was over at last, and on the 9th of November Cape\nCod appeared. They knew about Cape Cod from the map and book of\nCaptain John Smith, who had tried to plant a colony there some years\nbefore, but they intended to land somewhere near the Hudson River, and\nturned south along the coast. Shoals and breakers barring their\npassage that way, they returned, and, on November 11th, anchored in\nCape Cod harbor. “Being now passed the vast ocean and a sea of\ntroubles, before their preparation unto further proceedings . . . they\nfell down upon their knees and blessed the Lord, the God of Heaven,\nwho had brought them over the vast and furious ocean, and delivered\nthem from all perils and miseries thereof, again to set their feet on\nthe firm and stable earth, their proper element.”",
        "33. So there they were, and as yet no one had left the ship. It was\nwinter. The cold blue ocean beat the cold white shore, and the dark\nforest further back rustled and moaned in the north wind, whistling\nbleak welcome. What could those women and children do there? West from\nthe sea lay an unexplored country, no one knew how large; dark forest\nuninhabited, save for the dusky Indian, clothed the land in an\nunbroken mystery of wilderness; north and south stretched the desolate\ncoast, stretched five hundred miles ere it reached the nearest\nEuropean settlement; east lay the ocean, not to be recrossed. How\ncould the men build shelter in the midst of a northern winter? And\nthey must build, for the ship’s store of provisions was none too\nlarge, and the captain impatient to be off again before famine set in.\nAfter ages of comfort–shiver to think of it!–that lone, cold\nlanding; the stretching, desolate coast; the cutting, wind-blown snow;\nthe little anchored ship, bearing treasure of warm human hearts,\nstrong human wills, clear purpose, courage untamed. Slight protection,\nthe rocking ship, for such precious store of life, with that white,\nrelentless winter coming down upon the bay.",
        "34. The day of casting anchor, those steadfast, earnest men, whose God\nwas the Lord, and whose king was James of England, gathered in the\nMayflower cabin and, by a formal statement written and signed, formed\nthemselves into a civil state. Note the words of the compact: “In the\nname of God, amen. We, whose names are underwritten, the loyal\nsubjects of our dread sovereign lord, King James–” have fled over\nseas from English persecution? No–\"have undertaken, for the glory of\nGod and the advancement of the Christian faith, and honor of our king\nand country, a voyage to plant the first colony in the northern parts\nof Virginia.” God and the king; true Christians and true Englishmen.\nThe document reads with a calm dignity, a clear political instinct, a\nsolemn religious faith, worthy of Englishmen. They may have braved\nEnglish laws for conscience’ sake, but there is no bravado; they may\nkeenly feel the injustice they have experienced, but there was no\nrepining.",
        "35. Then began expeditions to the land. The men, under Captain\nStandish, went in parties in a small boat, returning to the ship at\nnight, or, in some cases, they camped on the shore and were away from\nthe ship several days. Wading to the shore through water too shallow\neven for the small boat, with sea-spray freezing as it covered them,\ntramping through the snow, breaking through the forest, with prayer\neach morning, and always a day of rest on Sunday, they explored the\ncoast and wilderness for the best place to settle. They found yellow\nIndian corn buried by the Indians in sand-heaps, and carried it to the\nship, counting it God’s special providence that they were thus\nprovided with seed to plant the next year. “The Lord is never wanting\nunto his in their greatest needs; let his holy Name have all the\npraise!” cried William Bradford. November wore away, dark and wild,\nand with set teeth December came. Back and forth went the exploring\nparties. A skirmish with the Indians took place; but “it pleased God\nto vanquish their enemies and give them deliverance, and by his\nspecial providence so to dispose, that not any one of them was hurt or\nhit, though their arrows came close.” Thereupon they gave the Lord\nsolemn thanks, and named the place “The First Encounter.”",
        "36. After a stormy, dangerous week, Saturday, December 9th, dawned\nclear, and the sun shone down on the snowy world. The Sabbath day the\nexplorers observed on shore, and Monday they “sounded the harbor and\nfound it fit for shipping, and marched into the land and found a . . .\nplace fit for situation; at least, it was the best they could find,\nand the season and their present necessity made them glad to accept of\nit. So they returned to their ship again with this news to the rest of\ntheir people, which did much comfort their hearts.” This day,\nDecember 11th, old style, corresponding to December 21st, new style,\nis celebrated as the date of the “landing of the Pilgrims.”",
        "37. Meantime, what of those left in the ship these four dreary weeks?\nThe ways of life went on in births and deaths; six of the wanderers\nfound the door of the other world; and Peregrine White came into\nthis–first-born of New England. The little boy Jasper More, who came\nin care of the Carvers, died; and Dorothy Bradford fell overboard and\nwas drowned while her husband was exploring the coast. The men had\nterrible coughs and colds from wading through the freezing sea, and\nthe women were beginning to suffer from the hardship of it all. The\nchildren, child-like, adapted themselves to the situation. Mr.\nBillington being gone to the shore, his son John, with the family gun\nwell loaded, took occasion to try his skill by shooting it off in the\ncabin; “yet, by God’s mercy, no harm was done!”",
        "38. Midwinter, and provisions low. Seven already buried in the ocean.\nSickness setting in with more severity, women and children to be\nsomehow cared for, two tiny babies to be shielded from all harm, their\nonly home the inhospitable shore. No time to lose! The 16th they began\nto build the first house, and so was planted Plymouth.",
        "39. In that dead winter time sprang Plymouth. Cold for the seed of the\nMayflower, but Mayflower’s seed did not easily die. The houses went\nup, one after another, and as it became possible the company on the\nship were transferred to the land. The ship, indeed, became more and\nmore undesirable: sickness prevailed; the sailors did not escape, but\ndragged about or tossed in their beds in fierce impatience, and, of\nthe Puritans, half their number died before the end of March. Elder\nBrewster and strong Miles Standish, with half-a-dozen others who were\nleft in health, toiled night and day, cooking, building fires, making\nbeds, washing clothes, adapting their masculine hands to women’s\noffices as they dressed and undressed the feverish patients, cared for\nthe babies whose mothers lay ill, heard the children say their\nprayers. Ah, Miles Standish, rough captain, nowhere do you stand out\nbraver than against that background! And Rose, thy wife, Rose Standish\ntoo must die, ere ever she comes to the home on the shore.",
        "40. The winter wears on. The Indians come to investigate, later to\ntreat with the English. Since there are few well enough to build, the\nlittle settlement, snowbound between the ocean and the forest, grows\nbut slowly. Sometimes death comes twice and thrice in a day, and the\nwhole scene is a funeral and the ocean one black grave. Yet they bear\nit all patiently, silently: it is the hand of the Lord. Priscilla\nMullins sees her father, her mother, her brother, buried in the\nheartless sea, and stands in the New World alone. “God is our refuge\nand strength, a very present help in trouble.” Priscilla can bear it\nas a brave woman will, and, later, finds protection in the strong arm\nof John Alden. Mr. Winslow watches the waves close over the form of\nhis wife. “My life is spent with sorrow and my years with sighing,...\nbut I trusted in thee, O Lord; my times are in thy hand.” He can\nbear it as a brave man can, and not many months after finds comfort in\ntaking to himself the widow of Mr. White; the two knit together by\ncommon sorrow and danger. Elizabeth Tilley loses father and mother.\nJohn Rigdale and Alice, his wife, die together. Thomas Tinker, wife,\nand child, all die there in the ship. And the north wind beat the sea\nand blew through the bare trees. Desolate, desolate welcome! “From the\nend of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed:\nlead me to the rock that is higher than I. The rock of my strength and\nmy refuge is in God.” They could bear it and be brave; and they did,\nuntil God sent the spring with new health for his people.",
        "41. Warmer shines the sun, and April comes. All the people–all whom\ndeath has left–are in the houses now, and the Mayflower is ready for\nthe home voyage. They gather at the shore to see the last of her, and\nsend last messages back to the dear home land. Back goes the ship,\nstraight to Old England; yet, with that fearful winter freezing in\ntheir memories, scarce fifty of them left to found the lonely\nsettlement, weak yet and worn, not one returns to the easier life at\nhome. The Mayflower disappears on the eastern horizon; the last\nwatcher by the shore is satisfied that she is gone; and then alone,\nself-governed, self-dependent, free, the sea and wilderness circling\nclose about them, God their Father watching overhead, the Puritans\ntake up their stern life, and in America create New England,",
        "Ellen Coit Brown.",
        "  42. The breaking waves dashed high\n    On a stern and rock-bound coast,\n  And the woods, against a stormy sky,\n    Their giant branches tossed.\n\n  43. And the heavy night hung dark\n    The woods and waters o’er,\n  When a band of exiles moored their bark\n    On the wild New England shore.\n\n  44. Not as the conqueror comes,\n    They, the true-hearted, came;\n  Not with the roll of the stirring drums,\n    And the trumpet that speaks of fame;\n\n  45. Not as the flying come,\n    In silence and in fear–\n  They shook the depths of the desert’s gloom\n    With their hymns of lofty cheer.\n\n  46. Amidst the storm they sang;\n    And the stars heard, and the sea;\n  And the sounding aisles of the dim woods rang\n    To the anthem of the free!\n\n  47.

Behold! they come–those sainted forms,\n    Unshaken through the strife of storms;\n    Heaven’s winter cloud hangs coldly down,\n    And earth puts on its rudest frown;\n    But colder, ruder, was the hand\n    That drove them from their own fair land;\n  Their own fair land–Refinement’s chosen seat,\n  Art’s trophied dwelling, Learning’s green retreat;\n  By Valor guarded and by Victory crowned,\n  For all but gentle Charity renowned.\n\n  49. With streaming eye, yet steadfast heart,\n  Even from that land they dared to part,\n    And burst each tender tie;\n  Haunts, where their sunny youth was passed,\n  Homes, where they fondly hoped at last\n    In peaceful age to die.\n  Friends, kindred, comfort, all they spurned,\n    Their fathers’ hallowed graves,\n  And to a world of darkness turned,\n    Beyond a world of waves.\n\n  50. When Israel’s race from bondage fled,\n  Signs from on high the wanderers led;\n  But here–Heaven hung no symbol here,\n  Their steps to guide, their souls to cheer;\n  They saw, through sorrow’s lengthening night,\n  Naught but the fagot’s guilty light;\n  The cloud they gazed at was the smoke.\n  Nor power above, nor power below,\n  Sustained them in their hour of woe;\n    A fearful path they trod,\n      And dared a fearful doom;\n    To build an altar to their God,\n      And find a quiet tomb.\n\n  51. Yet, strong in weakness, there they stand\n    On yonder ice–bound rock,\n  Stern and resolved, that faithful band,\n    To meet Fate’s rudest shock.\n  Though anguish rends the father’s breast,\n  For them, his dearest and his best,\n    With him the waste who trod–\n  Though tears that freeze the mother sheds\n  Upon her children’s houseless heads–\n    The Christian turns to God.\n\n  52.

        "1. India, the great peninsula stretching from the Himalayas to Cape\nComorin, is nearly half as large as Europe, and contains a population\nof 150,000,000. Myth and tradition claim for this people a very great\nantiquity, and there are many evidences that in arts, government, and\nliterature, India is at least coeval with China and Egypt, the three\nconstituting the most ancient civilizations of the world. While\nWestern Europe was still the abode of barbarians, and while even\nGreece had scarcely felt the impulse which aroused her to intellectual\nlife, the fabrics of India had reached a marvelous degree of fineness\nand beauty; and the monarchs of the West counted it a great privilege\nto be clothed in the “purple and fine linen” of the Orient.",
        "2. The early history of India seems a confused tangle of strifes and\ncontentions between different nations and races for the possession of\nthis region, inexpressibly rich in all that makes a land desirable for\nthe occupation of man, and of wars between local rulers striving for\ndominion. In the midst of this confusion, however, there seems to be\ngood evidence that the early civilization made its first appearance in\nthe valleys of the Upper Indus; that all invasions, until recent\ntimes, were from the fierce tribes of the table-lands to the\nnorthwest; that the industrious people of the valleys were driven from\ntheir homes by successive incursions of barbarians, extending through\nmany centuries; that each horde, becoming partially civilized, was in\nturn driven forward; and that the migrations were continuous from the\nnorth to the south. Thus it happens that at present the population of\nIndia consists of at least thirty distinct nationalities, and that the\naboriginal possessors of the Vale of Cashmere have been driven\nforward, until now they are found only upon the summits of the\nNeilgherry Mountains, in the extreme southern part of the peninsula.",
        "3. The Brahminical religion has prevailed in India from the earliest\nperiod. The first literary productions of the people are the Vedas,\nthe sacred books of the Brahmins. This religion is tolerant and\ninclusive. Its pantheon recognizes so many gods that each barbarous\ntribe from the North found their own deity represented, so that their\ncrude religious notions readily merged in the more complicated system\nof the people they had conquered. The great Buddhistic reform spent\nits force, and, although triumphant in other lands, it left but little\nimpress in India where it originated. The whole people believed the\nBrahminical creed and practiced the Brahminical precepts. It was a\nreligion that included the purest abstractions and the grossest form\nof idolatry. While absorbing all other creeds, it never sought to make\nconverts to its own.",
        "4. The later incursions from the northwest were essentially different\nfrom their predecessors. The tribes of the table-lands had been\nconverted to the fanatical and proselyting faith of Mohammed. About\nthe middle of the sixteenth century, a Mongol tribe, strong and\nstalwart from late successful wars, and full of the fierce zeal of\nrecent converts to Moslemism, appeared at the northern gate of India,\nand in a short time overspread the country and established the Mogul\nEmpire, with its capital at Delhi. The stern conquerors never rested\nuntil they had firmly established their authority over the whole\ncountry.",
        "5. The first great Sultan, Baber, had a genius for government. He was\nfirm and temperate in his administration, and he protected the common\npeople from the worst rapacity of their former rulers. Out of the\nchaos of native rule he evoked something like civilized order, and he\nestablished the Mogul Empire upon the foundation of a higher form of\njustice than had ever before been practiced in the East. After a reign\nof fifty years, this great monarch died in 1605, two years before the\nadventurous John Smith set foot upon the territory of Virginia.",
        "6. For another hundred years, the Mogul Emperors, descendants of\nBaber, held firm possession of India, and in that time the country\nreached the height of its power in wealth and influence. Temples and\npalaces, in richness and beauty surpassing the most gorgeous dreams of\nwestern-bred people, arose on every side. Arts flourished as never\nbefore, and the commerce of India overland to the West was so great\nthat large cities sprung up along its track, solely supported by the\ntrading caravans. The gold from all the nations toward the setting sun\nwas drained to pay for Indian fabrics, and India became the richest\ncountry of the world.",
        "7. In the beginning of the eighteenth century the Mogul Empire began\nto decline. Weak and effeminate monarchs occupied the throne of Baber\nand Shah Jehan. The governors of great provinces, while ruling under\nthe name of the Mogul, became really independent, and in turn\nsub-provinces revolted and set up an independent rule. From 1700 to\n1750, the whole country was ablaze with civil war. Rapacious\nchieftains plundered the people, the arts declined, industry of all\nkinds languished, and the country upon which Nature had lavished her\nrichest blessings seemed to be surrendered hopelessly to oppression\nand misrule.",
        "8. During the last century of the Mogul rule, and the following half\ncentury of anarchy, a new element entered into the affairs of India,\nwhich was destined to effect great and revolutionary changes.\nFollowing the wake of Vasco da Gama, the maritime powers of Western\nEurope all entered into a trade with India by the way of the Cape of\nGood Hope. The long caravan route through Central Asia was abandoned,\nand ships of the sea took the place of ships of the desert. Lisbon,\nAmsterdam, and London absorbed the trade which had made Bagdad,\nAleppo, and Bassorah opulent, and these renowned cities of Haroun\nal-Rashid speedily declined in wealth, power, and influence. The\nPortuguese, Dutch, French, and English entered into eager competition\nto secure the trade of India by the new route, and, to facilitate\ncommercial operations, stations called factories were established\nalong the coast. By the consent of the native princes, these factories\nand a small territory adjacent were under the exclusive civil control\nof the people occupying them.",
        "9. For a hundred and fifty years these factories remained mere trading\nstations, taking no part in the general political affairs of the\ncountry. While trade was active, and the profits great, the East India\nCompanies who controlled the factories were content; and, while the\nannual tribute or rent was paid with regularity, the native princes\nhad a strong motive for protecting the trading companies in their\noperations. But the display of barbaric splendor excited the cupidity\nof many of the agents of the companies, and the atrocities of barbaric\ntyranny aroused the indignation of others, and there came a time when\ninterference in native affairs seemed both natural and proper.",
        "10. The time of the new departure in policy was about the middle of\nthe eighteenth century; the place, the southeast coast; and the\noccasion, the civil wars which grew out of disputed succession. The\nstudent of history finds it difficult to understand fully the\npolitical situation at the time. One of the most powerful of all the\nprovinces of the Mogul Empire was “The Deccan,” which extended its\nsway over all of Southern India. The ruler, known as the “Nizam,\"\nadministered the government in the name of the Mogul, but in reality\nhe was independent, and a true Eastern despot. The chief province of\nthe Deccan was “The Carnatic,” which embraced all the territory along\nthe eastern coast. The sovereign of this region, called the “Nabob,\"\nwhile paying a nominal tribute to the Nizam, was really independent,\nraising revenue, waging wars, and forming alliances without reference\nto either the government of the Deccan or that of the Mogul Empire.",
        "11. To add to the general confusion, bands of Mahrattas, in numbers\nforming large armies, were constantly roaming through the country, and\nlevying contributions on both the governments and the people. This\npeculiar race was at first a mere band of robbers, which descended\nfrom the western mountains of India, but by repeated conquests, and by\naccessions from the wild and turbulent classes of all parts of the\ncountry, they bad become a great power, and ruled in many fertile\nprovinces. “In becoming sovereigns, they did not cease to be\nfreebooters. Every region which was not subject to their rule was\nwasted by their incursions. Whenever their kettle-drums were heard,\nthe peasant threw his bag of rice on his shoulder, hid his small\nsavings in his girdle, and fled with his wife and children to the\nmountains or the jungles, to the milder neighborhood of the hyena and\nthe tiger.”",
        "12. At this time the two principal factories on the east coast of\nIndia were the British station at Fort St. George, now Madras, and the\nFrench station at Pondicherry, eighty miles farther south. The first\nman who seems to have entertained definite notions about building up a\nEuropean sovereignty upon the ruins of the Mogul Empire was Dupleix,\nthe French Governor at Pondicherry. His long residence in the East had\ngiven him a knowledge of Indian affairs that few Europeans possessed.\n\"His restless, capacious, and inventive mind,” says Macaulay, “had\nformed this scheme at a time when the oldest servants of the English\nCompany were busied only about invoices and bills of lading. Nor had\nhe only proposed for himself the end. He had also a just and distinct\nview of the means by which it was to be attained.",
        "13. “He clearly saw that the greatest force which the princes of India\ncould bring into the field would be no match for the small body of men\ntrained in the discipline and guided by the tactics of the West. He\nsaw, also, that the natives of India might, under European commanders,\nbe formed into armies such as Saxe or Frederick would be proud to\ncommand. He was perfectly aware that the most easy and convenient way\nin which a European adventurer could exercise sovereignty in India was\nto govern the motions, and speak through the mouth, of some glittering\npuppet dignified by the title of Nabob or Nizam. The arts, both of war\nand policy, which a few years later were employed with such signal\nsuccess by the English, were first understood and practiced by this\ningenious and aspiring Frenchman.”",
        "14. In 1748 the Nizam of the Deccan died. Two claimants for the throne\nappeared in the persons of Nazir Jung, son of the old Nizam, and\nMirzapha Jung, a grandson. About the same time an adventurer, Chunda\nSahib, set up a claim for the throne of the Carnatic against Anaverdy\nKhan, the reigning prince. Here was the opportunity for Dupleix to\ncarry his long-cherished plans into execution. He espoused the cause\nof Chunda Sahib in the Carnatic, and sent four hundred French soldiers\nto his assistance. A battle was fought and Anaverdy Khan was killed.\nHis son Mohammed Ali fled with a scanty remnant of his army to\nTrichinopoly, and nearly all the Carnatic submitted to the conqueror.",
        "15. Next Dupleix lent his French soldiers to Mirzapha Jung, who in a\nshort time became master of the Deccan. The new sovereigns showered\nwealth and favors upon the successful Frenchman. He was declared\ngovernor of a territory in India as large as all France, with a\npopulation of 50,000,000 people. He was placed in command of the\nlargest military force of the country. He was presented with a million\ndollars in money and many valuable jewels. Neither the Nizam nor the\nNabob concluded any affairs of moment without his advice and consent.\nHe was, in fact, invested with sovereign powers, and French influence\nin Southern India was paramount and seemingly firmly established.",
        "16. The triumph of the French arms carried consternation to the\nBritish factory at St. George. Unless the victorious career of Dupleix\ncould be stayed, not only would British influence be destroyed, but\nthe very existence of their trading posts would soon be at an end. At\nthis time the government of St. George was feeble. The military\nofficers in command were without experience. Everything betokened\nspeedy and irretrievable ruin. In this emergency the valor and genius\nof an obscure English youth suddenly turned the tide of fortune.",
        "17. Robert Clive had gone to India in the service of the company as\ncommissary to the soldiers stationed at Fort St. George. His duties\nwere those of a clerk. He was now twenty-five years old, but had had\nno experience in military affairs. Like Dupleix, however, he seemed to\ncomprehend the political situation of the country, and when the\nemergency came that called forth his powers, he was found to possess\nboth military genius and profound statesmanship. He represented to the\nofficers of the post that if Trichinopoly, now besieged by Chunda\nSahib and his French allies, should surrender, Mohammed Ali would\nperish, and French influence would become supreme. As the distance of\nTrichinopoly from Fort St. George was so great as to preclude the\npossibility of marching directly to the assistance of their ally, he\nadvocated the bold project of making a diversion by a sudden attack\nupon Arcot, the capital of the Carnatic, and the favorite residence of\nthe Nabob. His plans were approved, and he was appointed commander to\ncarry them into execution.",
        "18. “The young captain,” says Macaulay, “was put at the head of two\nhundred English soldiers and three hundred sepoys, armed and\ndisciplined after the English fashion. The weather was stormy, but\nClive pushed on through thunder, lightning, and rain, to the gates of\nArcot. The garrison in a panic evacuated the fort and the English\nentered it without a blow. Clive immediately began to collect\nprovisions, to throw up works, and make preparations for sustaining a\nsiege. The garrison, which had fled at his approach, had now recovered\nfrom its dismay, and, re-enforced to the number of three thousand men,\nit encamped close to the town. At dead of night Clive marched out of\nthe fort, attacked the camp by surprise, slew great numbers, dispersed\nthe rest, and returned to his quarters without having lost a single\nman.",
        "19. “The news of the fall of Arcot soon reached Chunda Sahib, as he\nwas besieging Trichinopoly. An army under the command of his son Rajah\nSahib, numbering ten thousand native troops and one hundred and fifty\nFrenchmen, was immediately dispatched to Arcot, and proceeded to\ninvest the fort, which seemed quite incapable of sustaining a siege.\nThe walls were ruinous and the ditches dry. The garrison, reduced by\ncasualties, now consisted of one hundred and fifty English soldiers\nand two hundred sepoys. The stock of provisions was scanty, and the\ncommander was a youth of five and twenty, who had been bred a\nbook-keeper.",
        "20. “During fifty days the siege went on. During fifty days the young\ncaptain maintained the defense with a firmness, vigilance, and ability\nwhich would have done honor to the oldest marshal in Europe. The\ngarrison began to feel the pressure of hunger. At this juncture the\nsepoys came to Clive, not to complain of their scanty fare, but to\npropose that all the grain should be given to the Europeans, who\nrequired more nourishment than the natives of Asia. The thin gruel,\nthey said, which was strained away from the rice, would suffice for\nthemselves. The devotion of Clive’s little band equaled that of the\nTenth Legion of Caesar, or of the Old Guard of Napoleon.",
        "21. “Clive looked for succor from two sources. An attempt made by the\ngovernment at Madras to relieve the place failed, but there was still\nhope from another quarter. A body of six thousand Mahrattas, under a\nchief named Morari Row, had been hired to assist Mohammed Ali; but as\nthe French power seemed irresistible, this force bad hitherto remained\ninactive on the frontiers of the Carnatic. The fame of the defense of\nArcot roused them from their torpor. Rajah Sahib learned that the\nMahrattas were in motion. It was necessary for him to be expeditious.\nHe first offered large bribes to Clive, and vowed that if his\nproposals were not accepted he would instantly storm the fort and put\nevery man to the sword. Clive told him in reply that his father was a\nusurper and that his army was a rabble, and that he would do well to\nthink twice before he sent such poltroons into a breach defended by\nEnglish soldiers.",
        "22. “Rajah Sahib determined to storm the fort. The day was well suited\nto a bold military enterprise. It was the great Mohammedan festival\nwhich is sacred to the memory of Hosein the son of Ali. The history of\nIslam contains nothing more touching than the event which gave rise to\nthat solemnity. The mournful legend relates how the chief of the\nFatimites, when all his brave followers had perished round him, drank\nhis last draught of water and uttered his latest prayer; how the\nassassins carried his head in triumph, smote the lifeless lips with\nhis staff, and how a few old men recollected with tears that they had\nseen those lips pressed to the lips of the prophet of God.",
        "23. “After the lapse of near twelve centuries, the recurrence of this\nsolemn season excites the fiercest and saddest emotions in the bosoms\nof the devout Moslems of India. They work themselves up to such\nagonies of rage and lamentation that some, it is said, have given up\nthe ghost from the mere effect of mental excitement. They believe that\nwhoever, during this festival, falls in arms against the infidels,\natones by his death for all the sins of life, and passes at once to\nthe Garden of the Houris. It was at this time that Rajah Sahib\ndetermined to assault Arcot. Stimulating drugs were employed to aid\nthe effect of religious zeal, and the besiegers, drunk with\nenthusiasm, drunk with bang, rushed furiously to the attack.",
        "24. “Clive had received secret intelligence of the design, had made\nhis arrangements, and, exhausted by fatigue, had thrown himself on his\nbed. He was awakened by the alarm, and was instantly at his post. The\nenemy advanced, driving before them elephants whose foreheads were\narmed with iron plates. It was expected that the gates would yield to\nthe shock of these living battering-rams. But the huge beasts no\nsooner felt the English musket-balls than they turned round and rushed\nfuriously away, trampling on the multitude which had urged them\nforward. A raft was launched on the water which filled one part of the\nditch. Clive, perceiving that his gunners at that post did not\nunderstand their business, took the management of a piece of artillery\nhimself, and cleared the raft in a few minutes.",
        "25. “Where the moat was dry the assailants mounted with great\nboldness; but they were received with a fire so heavy and so well\ndirected that it soon quelled the courage even of fanaticism and\nintoxication. The rear ranks of the English kept the front ranks\nsupplied with a constant succession of loaded muskets, and every shot\ntold on the living mass below. After three desperate onsets, the\nbesiegers retired behind the ditch.",
        "26. “The struggle lasted about an hour. Four hundred of the assailants\nfell. The garrison lost only five or six men. The besieged passed an\nanxious night, looking for a renewal of the attack. But when day broke\nthe enemy were no more to be seen. They had retired, leaving the\nEnglish several guns and a large quantity of ammunition.",
        "27. “Clive immediately began offensive operations. Re-enforced by\nseven hundred English troops and sepoys from Madras, and effecting a\njunction with the auxiliary Mahratta force, he soon overran all the\nNorthern Carnatic. He gained a complete victory over Rajah Sahib’s\narmy of five thousand natives and three hundred Frenchmen. At this\ntime Major Lawrence arrived from England and assumed the command. An\nexpedition marched to the assistance of Mohammed Ali at Trichinopoly.\nThe besiegers were defeated, and Chunda Sahib was put to death by the\nMahrattas, into whose hands he fell.",
        "28. “The English were now masters of the Carnatic, and the French\ninfluence was broken. Steadily the English power was extended over the\nDeccan and all Southern India. Dupleix struggled against his fate in\nvain, no French armament came to his assistance. His company condemned\nhis policy and furnished him with no aid. But still he persisted,\nbribed, intrigued, promised, lavished his private fortune, and\neverywhere tried to raise new enemies to the government at Madras, but\nall to no purpose. At length, when his last hope for empire died out,\nbroken in fortune and spirits, he returned to his native country to\ndie obscure and neglected.",
        "29. “Clive went back to England for a brief space, but after a year or\ntwo he returned to India as governor of Madras. His first service\nafter his return was to rout out a nest of pirates which had for a\nlong time maintained a stronghold upon the coast. He then turned his\nattention to reform in the company’s business, and to strengthening\nBritish influence with the natives in all directions. Before two\nmonths had expired he received intelligence which called forth all the\nenergies of his bold and active mind.",
        "30. “Of the large provinces into which the Mogul Empire was divided\nthe wealthiest was Bengal. No part of India possessed such natural\nadvantages, both for agriculture and commerce. The Ganges, rushing\nthrough a hundred channels to the sea, has formed a vast plain of rich\nmold which, even under the tropical sky, rivals the verdure of an\nEnglish April. The rice-fields yield an increase such as is elsewhere\nunknown. Spices, sugar, vegetable oils are produced with marvelous\nexuberance. The rivers afford an inexhaustible supply of fish. The\ndesolate islands along the sea-coast, overgrown with noxious\nvegetation and swarming with deer and tigers, supply the cultivated\ndistricts with salt. The great stream which fertilizes the soil is at\nthe same time the chief highway of Eastern commerce. On its banks, and\non those of its tributary waters, are the wealthiest marts, the most\nsplendid capitals, and the most sacred shrines of India. In numbers\nits inhabitants exceed 60,000,000; a population greater than that of\nEngland and France combined.",
        "31. “The race by which this rich tract was peopled, enervated by a\nsoft climate and accustomed to peaceful employments, bore the same\nrelation to other Asiatics which the Asiatics generally bear to the\nbold and energetic children of Europe. Whatever the Bengalee does, he\ndoes languidly. His favorite pursuits are sedentary. He shrinks from\nbodily exertion, and, though voluble in dispute and able in the war of\nchicane, he seldom engages in a personal conflict, and scarcely ever\nenlists as a soldier. There never, perhaps, existed a people so\nthoroughly fitted by nature and by habit for a foreign yoke.",
        "32. “The great commercial companies of Europe had long possessed\nfactories in Bengal. The French, the Dutch, and the English had\nstations on the Hoogly, the chief branch of the Ganges. Of these the\nEnglish Fort William, on the site of the present city of Calcutta, was\nnearest the sea. A church and ample warehouses rose in the vicinity, a\nrow of spacious houses, belonging to the chief officers of the East\nIndia Company, lined the banks of the river, and in the neighborhood\nhad sprung up a large and busy native town. For the ground on which\nthe settlement stood, the English paid rent to the government, and\nwere permitted to have practical control of their own domain.",
        "33. “The province of Bengal had long been governed by a viceroy of the\nMogul, who had become practically independent. In 1756 the sovereignty\ndescended to a youth under twenty years of age, who bore the name of\nSurajah Dowlah. Oriental despots are perhaps the worst class of human\nbeings, and this unhappy boy was one of the worst specimens of his\nclass. His understanding was naturally feeble, and his temper\nunamiable. His education had been such as would have enervated even a\nvigorous intellect, and perverted even a generous disposition. He was\nunreasonable, because nobody ever dared to reason with him, and\nselfish, because he had never been made to feel himself dependent on\nthe good will of others.",
        "34. “Early debauchery had unnerved his body and his mind. He indulged\nimmoderately in the use of ardent spirits, which inflamed his weak\nbrain almost to madness. His chosen companions were flatterers sprung\nfrom the dregs of the people. It is said that he had arrived at the\nlast stage of human depravity, when cruelty becomes pleasing for its\nown sake, when the sight of pain as pain is an agreeable excitement.\nIt had early been his amusement to torture beasts and birds, and when\nhe grew up he enjoyed with still greater relish the misery of his\nfellow-creatures.",
        "35. “From a child Surajah Dowlah had hated the English. It was his\nwhim to do so; and his whims were never opposed. He had formed a very\nexaggerated notion of the wealth which might be obtained by plundering\nthem, and his feeble mind could not perceive that the riches of\nCalcutta, however great, could not compensate him for what he must\nlose if the European trade should be driven by his violence to some\nother quarter. Pretexts for a quarrel were readily found, and Surajah\nDowlah marched with a great army against Fort William.",
        "36. “The servants of the company at Madras had been forced to become\nstatesmen and soldiers. Those in Bengal were still mere traders, and\nwere in no condition to defend themselves against the formidable\nattack. The fort was taken, after a feeble resistance, and nearly the\nwhole English population fell into the hands of the conqueror. A few,\nincluding the governor, had saved themselves by taking refuge in the\nships. The Nabob seated himself with regal pomp in the principal ball\nof the factory and ordered Mr. Holwell, the first in rank among the\nprisoners, to be brought before him. His Highness talked about the\ninsolence of the English, and grumbled at the smallness of the\ntreasure he had found; but he promised to spare their lives, and\nretired to rest.",
        "37. “Then was committed that great crime, memorable for its singular\natrocity, memorable for the terrible retribution by which it was\nfollowed. The English captives were left to the mercy of the guards,\nand the guards determined to secure them for the night in the prison\nof the garrison, a chamber known by the fearful name of the Black\nHole. The space was only twenty feet square. The air-boles were small\nand obstructed. It was the summer solstice, the season when the fierce\nheat of Bengal can scarcely be rendered tolerable to natives of\nEngland by lofty hills and by the constant waving of fans.",
        "38. “The number of prisoners was one hundred and forty-six, and they\nwere driven into the cell at the point of the sword. They cried for\nmercy. They strove to burst the door. Holwell offered large bribes to\nthe jailers; but the answer was that nothing could be done without the\nNabob’s orders, and that the Nabob was asleep and would be angry if\nanybody waked him. Then the prisoners went mad with despair, and\nfought for places near the windows where they might obtain air. The\njailers in the mean time held lights at the bars and shouted with\nlaughter at the frantic struggles of their victims.",
        "39. “At length the tumult died away in low gaspings and moanings. The\nday broke. The Nabob had slept off his debauch, and permitted the door\nto be opened. Twenty-three ghastly figures staggered out of the\ncharnel-house, one hundred and twenty-three bodies were hastily thrown\ninto a pit and covered up, and the Black Hole of Calcutta has gone\ninto history as a synonym for all that is dreadful and all that is\npossible in human suffering.",
        "40. “The horror which daylight revealed awakened neither pity nor\nremorse in the bosom of the savage Nabob. He inflicted no punishment\non the murderers. He shoved no tenderness to the survivors. He sent\nletters to the Court of Delhi, describing his conquest in most pompous\nlanguage. He placed a garrison at Fort William, and forbade Englishmen\nto dwell in the neighborhood.",
        "41. “In August the news of the fall of Calcutta reached Madras, and\nexcited the fiercest and bitterest resentment. The cry of the whole\nsettlement was for vengeance. Within forty-eight hours after the\narrival of the intelligence it was determined that an expedition\nshould be sent to the Hoogly, and that Clive should be at the head of\nthe land forces. The naval armament was under the command of Admiral\nWatson. Nine hundred English infantry and fifteen hundred Sepoys\nsailed to punish a prince who ruled over 60,000,000 of people. In\nOctober the expedition sailed; but it had to make its way against\nadverse winds, and did not reach Bengal until December.",
        "42. “In the mean time the Surajah Dowlah was reveling in fancied\nsecurity. He was so ignorant of the state of foreign countries that he\noften used to say that there were not ten thousand men in all Europe,\nand it never occurred to him that it was possible that the English\nwould dare to invade his dominions. But while in no fear of the\nEnglish, he began to miss them greatly. His revenues fell off, and his\nministers at length made him understand that it was more profitable to\nprotect traders than to plunder them. He was disposed to permit the\ncompany to resume their operations when he heard of the arrival of\nClive in the Hoogly. He instantly marched with his troops toward\nCalcutta.",
        "43. “Clive commenced operations with his usual vigor. He routed the\ngarrison at Fort William, recovered Calcutta, and stormed and sacked\nthe Nabob’s stations along the river. The Nabob, alarmed at this proof\nof power and spirit, made overtures of peace. He offered to restore\nthe factory, and to give compensation to those whom he had despoiled.",
        "44. “Clive, considering the disparity of his force and the uncertainty\nof war, consented to negotiate. The terms which he demanded were those\nwhich guaranteed much greater power to the English than they ever had\nbefore. His manner was cool and determined, as though conscious of\npossessing power sufficient to enforce his demands. The Nabob behaved\nwith all the faithlessness of an Indian statesman and with all the\nlevity of a boy. He promised, retracted, hesitated, evaded. At one\ntime he advanced with his army in a threatening manner toward\nCalcutta, but when he saw the resolute front which the English\npresented, be fell back in alarm, and consented to make peace on their\nown terms.",
        "45. “The treaty was no sooner concluded than he formed new designs\nagainst them. He intrigued with the French upon the Hoogly. He invited\nthe French force in the Deccan to come and drive the English out of\nBengal. All this was well known to Clive and Watson. They resolved to\nrid themselves of one source of danger before the Nabob’s plans were\nconsummated. They attacked the French factory upon the Hoogly. Watson\ndirected the expedition by water, and Clive by land. Their success was\nrapid and complete. The fort, the garrison, the artillery, the\nmilitary stores, all fell into the hands of the English. Fresh from\nthis victory Clive returned to his negotiations with the Surajah\nDowlah.",
        "46. “The Nabob was confounded by this sudden movement and the\ndestruction of the French power. He regarded the English with still\ngreater fear and still greater hatred. He oscillated between servility\nand insolence. One day he sent a large sum to Calcutta, as part of the\ncompensation due for the wrongs he had committed. The nest day he sent\nvaluable jewels to Bussy, the French commander in the Deccan,\nimploring that officer to hasten and protect Bengal against Clive,\nwhom ’may all bad fortune attend.’ He ordered his army to march\nagainst the English. He countermanded his orders. He tore Clive’s\nletters. He sent answers in the most florid language of compliment. He\nthreatened to impale Mr. Watts, the English agent. He sent for Mr.\nWatts and begged pardon for the insult.",
        "47. “In the mean time his folly, his vices, his dissolute manners, and\nhis love of low company disgusted all classes of his own subjects, and\na formidable conspiracy was formed against him in his own capital. The\nconspirators entered into negotiation with Clive, and he agreed to\nplace Meer Jaffler, the head of the movement, upon the throne of\nBengal. In his diplomacy Clive seems to have laid aside his character\nas a bluff soldier, and to have taken lessons from his wily and\ntreacherous Indian foes. He intrigued and deceived until the last\nmoment, when the conspiracy was ripe and his army ready.",
        "48. “The moment for action came. Mr. Watts, the English agent,\nsecretly fled and took refuge in Calcutta. Clive put his troops in\nmotion, and wrote to the Nabob a letter in which he set forth the\nEnglish wrongs, and concluded by saying that, as the rains were about\nto set in, he and his men would do themselves the honor of waiting\nupon his Highness for an answer.",
        "49. “Surajah Dowlah instantly assembled his whole force and marched to\nencounter the English. It had been arranged that Meer Jaffier should\nseparate himself from the Nabob, and carry over his division to Clive.\nBut as the decisive moment approached, the fears of the conspirator\novercame his ambition. Clive advanced to the river which separated him\nfrom his foe. The Nabob lay with a mighty power a few miles off at\nPlassey. Meer Jaffier delayed, and returned evasive answers to the\nremonstrances of the English general.",
        "50. “Clive was in an anxious and painful situation. He could place no\nconfidence in the sincerity or the courage of his confederate; and\nwhatever confidence he might have in his own military talents, and in\nthe valor and discipline of his troops, it was no light thing to\nengage an army twenty times as numerous as his own. Before him lay a\nriver over which it was easy to advance, but over which, if things\nwent ill, not one of his little band would return.",
        "51. “On this occasion, for the first and for the last time, his\ndauntless spirit, during a few hours, shrank from the fearful\nresponsibility of making a decision. He called a council of war. The\nmajority pronounced against fighting, and Clive declared his\nconcurrence with the majority. Long afterward he said that he had\nnever called but one council of war, and that if he had taken their\nadvice the British would never have been masters of Bengal. But\nscarcely had the meeting broke up than he was himself again. He\nretired alone under the shade of some trees, and passed an hour there\nin thought. He came back determined to take the risk, and gave orders\nthat all should be in readiness for passing the river on the morrow.",
        "52. “The river was passed; and, at the close of a toilsome day’s\nmarch, the army, long after sunset, took up its quarters in a grove of\nmango-trees near Plassey, within a mile of the enemy. Clive was unable\nto steep; he heard through the night the sound of drums and cymbals\nfrom the vast camp of the Nabob. It is not strange that even his stout\nheart should now and then have sunk, when he reflected against what\nodds, and for what a prize, he was in a few hours to contend.",
        "53. “Nor was the rest of Surajah Dowlah more peaceful. His mind, at\nonce weak and stormy, was distracted by wild and horrible\napprehensions. Appalled by the greatness and nearness of the crisis,\ndistrusting his captains, dreading every one who approached him,\ndreading to be left alone, lie sat gloomily in his tent, haunted, a\nGreek poet would have said, by the Furies of those who had cursed him\nwith their last breath in the Black Hole.",
        "54. “The day broke–the day which was to decide the fate of India. At\nsunrise the army of the Nabob, pouring through many openings of the\ncamp, began to move toward the grove where the English lay. Forty\nthousand infantry, armed with firelocks, pikes, swords, bows and\narrows, covered the plain. They were accompanied by fifty pieces of\nordnance of the largest size, each tugged by a long team of white\noxen, and each pushed on from behind by an elephant. Some smaller\nguns, under the direction of French soldiers, were perhaps more\nformidable.",
        "55. “The cavalry were fifteen thousand, drawn from the bolder races\nwhich inhabit the northern provinces; and the practiced eye of Clive\ncould perceive that the men and horses were more powerful than those\nof the Carnatic. The force opposed to this great multitude consisted\nof only three thousand men; but of these, nearly one thousand were\nEnglish, and all were led by English officers and trained in the\nEnglish discipline.",
        "56. “The battle commenced with a cannonade, in which the artillery of\nthe Nabob did scarcely any execution, while the field-pieces of the\nEnglish produced great effect. Several officers in Surajah Dowlah’s\nservice fell. Disorder began to spread through his ranks. His own\nterror increased every moment. One of the conspirators advised him to\nretreat. This advice, agreeing as it did with what his own terrors\nsuggested, was readily received. He ordered his army to fall back, and\nthis order decided his fate. Clive snatched the moment, and ordered\nhis troops to advance.",
        "57. “The confused and dispirited multitude gave way before the onset\nof disciplined valor. No mob attacked by regular soldiers was ever\nmore completely routed. The little band of Frenchmen, who alone\nventured to confront the English, were swept down the stream of the\nfugitives. In an hour the forces of Surajah Dowlah were dispersed,\nnever to re-assemble. Only five hundred of the vanquished were slain;\nbut their camp, their guns, their baggage, innumerable wagons,\ninnumerable cattle, remained in the power of the conqueror. With a\nloss of twenty-two soldiers killed and fifty wounded, Clive had\nscattered an army of sixty thousand men, and had subdued an empire\nlarger and more populous than Great Britain.”",
        "58. This brilliant success of Clive added Plassey as one of the\nbattle-fields of the world which has shaped national destinies and\ndecided the fate of trillions of people. Though much was yet to be\ndone before the fruits of victory could be fully realized, Clive at\nonce became almost supreme in authority. Surajah Dowlah fled in\ndisguise, and disappeared from history in complete obscurity. Meer\nJaffler held Clive in slavish awe. He once reproved a native of high\nrank for some trouble with the company’s Sepoys. “Are you yet to\nlearn,” he said, “who Colonel Clive is, and in what station God has\nplaced him?” The answer was: “I affront the colonel! I who never get\nup in the morning without making three low bows to his jackass!”",
        "59. The policy inaugurated by Clive was continued by his successors.\nThe British rule was extended by setting up native princes, or setting\nthem aside, as expediency dictated, until the whole vast region south\nof the Himalayas passed under their control. The weak trading\ncompanies of 1755 have blossomed out into an empire.",
        "60. British India to-day, in extent of territory and in absolute\nsafety, is immeasurably greater than that of the Moguls in the height\nof their glory. The first wild exercise of irresponsible power has\nbeen corrected, and governmental affairs under British rule are now\nadministered on the foundation of substantial justice. The peasant no\nlonger flies from governmental officers to the more merciful\ncompanionship of the cobra and tiger, and all who toil find protection\nas never before. The races of the Orient have been brought face to\nface with the arts and sciences of the West, and untold millions have\ncause to bless the day when Robert Clive was forced to close the\nledger and take up the sword.",
        "1. The Pilgrims had passed away. Long years had elapsed since the last\nof the New England fathers had exchanged the earthly for the heavenly\nkingdom. The grandchildren and the great-grandchildren of the first\nimmigrants possessed the soil. No aliens they, seeking a refuge in an\nunknown land, but the sturdy possessors of homes where they were born,\nand around which clustered all tender family ties. The passionate love\nfor England, filtered through three generations, had moderated to a\nfilial respect without impairing filial obedience.",
        "2. Marvelous the change in outward conditions of that century and a\nhalf! Wave after wave of intelligent activity had passed over the\nland. Settlers’ fires hunted the track of Indians westward bound. On\nthe site of primeval forests, fields of grain shimmered in the sun.\nThe rude hut, hastily built for shelter, had given place to the\ncomfortable farm-house and the elegant mansion. Village and city had\ngrown up in the centers of trade. The mechanic arts had slowly made\ntheir way. Change vast, weighty, permanent–not sudden, but orderly\ngrowth–fruit of seed sown, but none the less marvelous for that.",
        "3. Internal change had accompanied the external. Spiritual growth had\ngone hand in hand with increase of life’s comforts. Persecution as a\nmeans of conversion had disappeared before common dangers and\nsufferings. Intolerance had toned down into a mild form of bigotry.\nThe shovel-hat of the parson and the flowing robes of the magistrate\nhad lost much of their superstitious significance. The hard,\nself-imposed restraints of the Puritans had become less rigid at home\nand in public. Individual life was freer, fuller, and more complete.",
        "4. So sped the years until after the French war–until the last of\nEngland’s rivals had been effectually subdued. Now England, for the\nfirst time, seems to have been brought face to face with her sturdy\noffspring. Now she deliberately made up her mind to make him\nuseful–pay her debts, fight her enemies, subserve her interests first\nand always. So, with blustering words about rights, she imposed\nburdens, with significant hints in regard to chastisements; she\nwithheld privileges; the cherishing mother in word and deed proving to\nbe a veritable step-mother with the hardest of hearts.",
        "5. Here trouble began. The son had an equal share with the parent in\nAgincourt and Magna Charta. He was confiding and unsuspicious, but\nthe experience of three generations in the wilds had accustomed him to\nfreedom, and had given him hardihood. His shoulders were broad, but it\nwas difficult to bind burdens upon them against his will. As the\npolicy of the parent dawned upon him, first came incredulous\nquestioning, “What does this mean?\"–then protest, showing the injury\nand suggesting “There must be some mistake!\"–last, conviction of\nintended injustice, the hot wrath, and the emphatic statement, “I will\nnot obey!” The angry note of defiance was heard rolling along the\nAtlantic coast from New England to Georgia. Descendants of Roundheads,\nCavaliers, and Huguenots forgot their ancient prejudices and united\nagainst this common danger. Patrick Henry responded to the sentiments\nof Otis and Adams, and Virginia sent friendly greetings to the\ncommonwealth of Massachusetts.",
        "6. The madness that afflicted the last years of the life of George III\nseems to have taken possession of the British ministry. Exaction\nfollowed exaction in increasing intensity and number. The history of\ncoercive legislation can scarcely find a parallel to that of the\nBritish Parliament for the fifteen years following the fall of Quebec.\nWithal, no excuse was ever made for injustice done, no sympathy was\never expressed for suffering inflicted, but all communication conveyed\nthe stern purpose to subdue. Hungry for affection, the half-grown\noffspring turned his face toward England for the smallest caress, and\nthe east wind brought back across the Atlantic full in his face the\nsharp crack of a whip.",
        "7. Then came a period of aggression and resistance. The Stamp Act was\npassed, but stamp could not be sold, and the lives of stamp-venders\nbecame miserable. Soldiers crowded citizens upon Boston Common;\ncitizens mobbed the soldiers; soldiers fired, killing five citizens,\nand were saved from destruction only by the active interference of the\npatriot leaders. This affray marked the first shedding of blood, and\nhas gone into history as “The Boston Massacre.” Tea was taxed, but\nthe matrons took to catnip and sage, and no tea was sold. Three\ncargoes of taxed tea were sent into Boston harbor, but a war-whoop was\nheard; the vessels were boarded by a band of painted savages, tomahawk\nin band; the tea-chests were broken up and the tea was thrown into the\nwater. This last act demanded special punishment, and the Boston Port\nBill shut up the port of Boston, allowing no ship to go in or out. The\nsympathetic people of Salem and Marblehead placed wharf and warehouse\nat the disposal of Boston merchants, softening the blow as much as\npossible. Relief to the suffering poor of Boston poured in from all\nsides, and the British ministry saw that the whole people were making\ncommon cause in resistance to oppression.",
        "8. The next step is the vigorous use of the strong arm. Filial love\nmust be forced in by means of bayonets, and affection secured by\ngunpowder and bullets. A strong force of soldiers under General Gage\ntook possession of Boston. The troops were quartered in the City Hall\nand other buildings sacred in the eyes of the people to justice and\npeace. The city government was superseded by the military. Sentinels\npatrolled the streets. Arbitrary edicts took the place of law.\nCitizens were interfered with while in the pursuit of private\nbusiness. For soldiers’ insults there was no redress. The leading\npatriots, John Adams, Joseph Warren, James Otis, John Hancock, and\nSamuel Adams, were hunted, and a price was set on their heads. Boston\nwas in the strong hands of military power. Outwardly it was subdued,\nbut beneath was a seething fire, ready to burst into flame when the\nmoment for conflagration should arrive.",
        "9. But Massachusetts was aroused. Town and country were one. The war\nspirit invoked engendered its kind. Committees of Safety were formed\nin every town. The drum and fife echoed from mountain to valley. The\nmusket of the old war, the shot-gun of the sportsman, and the rifle of\nthe hunter were brought from their resting-places and prepared for\nuse. Forge and hammer were busy in making guns and swords. Minute-men\nin every hamlet prepared to march on the moment. Nor were the women\nidle; wheel and loom were busy as never before. The patriot soldier,\nstarting for the front, was clad in serviceable home-spun, prepared by\nloving hands, and he departed amid the tears, prayers, and blessings\nof loving yet steadfast hearts.",
        "10. The General Court of Massachusetts was convened. It was denounced\nand proscribed by General Gage, but in the eyes of the people its\nmandates had all the force of law. Taxes were levied and cheerfully\npaid. The colony was divided into military districts, and each one\nplaced under the command of a competent officer. Powder, arms, and\nother military stores were collected, and all needful preparations\nwere made for war. The other New England colonies fully shared in the\nexcitement of Massachusetts. The note of alarm spread through the\nland, and a Continental Congress was called to meet at Philadelphia to\nconsider the policy best to be pursued for the common weal.",
        "11. But General Gage became impatient. He would strike a blow that\nwould at once assert British power and terrify the whole rebel race.\nThe mailed hand must be seen beneath the soft glove. The opportunity\nwas not long wanting. A military depot at Concord, eighteen miles\nnorthwest of Boston, he determined to seize. A force of eight hundred\nmen, under Lieutenant-Colonel Smith and Major Pitcairn, was to set out\non the evening of April 18th. The patriot leaders were early aware\nthat some movement was on foot, and eager eyes watched for indications\nof its force and direction. But it was kept a profound secret, and it\nwas not until the troops were upon the march that their destination\ncould be guessed. Let the poet tell how the purpose was discovered and\nthe news carried to the country:",
        "  12. Listen, my children, and you shall hear\n  Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,\n  On the eighteenth of April, seventy-five.\n  Hardly a man is now alive\n  Who remembers that famous day and year.\n\n  13. He said to his friend, “If the British march\n  By land or sea from the town to-night,\n  Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch\n  In the North Church tower as a signal light–\n  One if by land, and two if by sea;\n  And I on the opposite shore will be,\n  Ready to ride and spread the alarm\n  Through every Middlesex village and farm,\n  For the country folk to be up and to arm.\"\n\n  14. Then he said “Good night!” and with muffled oar\n  Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore,\n  Just as the moon rose over the bay,\n  Where, swinging wide at her moorings, lay\n  The Somerset, British man-of-war:\n  A phantom ship, with each mast and spar\n  Across the moon like a prison bar,\n  And a huge black hulk, that was magnified\n  By its own reflection in the tide.\n\n  15. Meanwhile his friend, through alley and street,\n  Watches and wanders, with eager ears,\n  Till in the silence around him he hears\n  The muster of men at the barrack door,\n  The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet,\n  And the measured tread of the grenadiers,\n  Marching down to their boats on the shore.\n\n  16. Then he climbed the tower of the old North Church,\n  By the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread,\n  To the belfry chamber overhead,\n  And startled the pigeons from their perch\n  On the somber rafters, that round him made\n  Masses and moving shapes of shade;\n  By the trembling ladder, steep and tall,\n  To the highest window in the wall,\n  Where he paused to listen and look down\n  A moment on the roofs of the town,\n  And the moonlight flowing over all.\n\n  17. Beneath in the churchyard lay the dead,\n  In their night-encampment on the hill,\n  Wrapped in a silence so deep and still\n  That he could hear, like a sentinel’s tread,\n  The watchful night-wind as it went\n  Creeping along from tent to tent,\n  And seeming to whisper “All is well!\"\n\n  18. A moment only he feels the spell\n  Of the place and the hour, and the secret dread\n  Of the lonely belfry and the dead;\n  For suddenly all his thoughts were bent\n  On a shadowy something far away,\n  Where the river widens to meet the bay–\n  A line of black that bends and floats\n  On the rising tide like a bridge of boats.\n\n  19. Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,\n  Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride,\n  On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere.\n  Now he patted his horse’s side,\n  Now gazed on the landscape far and near,\n  Then, impetuous, stamped the earth,\n  And turned and tightened his saddle-girth;\n  But mostly lie watched with eager search\n  The belfry-tower of the old North Church,\n  As it rose above the graves on the hill,\n  Lonely and spectral and somber and still.\n  And lo! as he looks, on the belfry’s height\n  A glimmer, and then a gleam of light.\n  He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,\n  But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight\n  A second lamp in the belfry burns.\n\n  20. A hurry of hoofs in the village street,\n  A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,\n  And beneath, from the pebbles in passing, a spark\n  Struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet.\n  That was all! and yet, through the gloom and the light,\n  The fate of a nation was riding that night;\n  And the spark struck out by that steed in its flight\n  Kindled the land into flame with its heat.",
        "21. The British column moved on through the darkness with no sound\nsave the steady tread of marching feet. At first, farm-house and\nhamlet were wrapped in a deep repose, but as the night wore on signs\nof life began to appear. At every cross-road, horsemen galloped off at\ntheir approach, and hurried lights at chamber windows showed that\nslumber had been suddenly interrupted. At day-break the invading force\nreached Lexington, a little village twelve miles from Boston. Here\nminute-men to the number of about one hundred and twenty, aroused by\nthe cry of Paul Revere, had hastily assembled. They offered no\nopposition to the British troops, but stood silent spectators to the\nunusual sight.",
        "22. The British column halted, and Major Pitcairn rode forward, and,\nin the most peremptory tone of command, cried out: “Disperse, you\nrebels! Throw down your arms and disperse!” No one obeyed, and he\ngave the order to fire. Out blazed the muskets, and what remained of\nthe little group sought safety in flight. The British marched on,\nleaving on that peaceful common, under the very shadow of the church,\neight figures stark and motionless in death. From this baptism of\nblood they moved on, regretful, perhaps, at the stern necessity of\ntheir action, but rejoicing that all opposition had been so easily and\ncompletely overcome.",
        "23. On they sped. The sun arose in its glory to cheer them on their\nmarch. Their thoughts were jubilant as in fancy they posed as heroes\nbefore their fellows left behind. No vision of the dead men staring\nupward from the blood-drenched grass of Lexington haunted them. The\nsilent march of the night had ended, and now they could press onward\nwith clatter and song. The six miles to Concord were soon passed over.\nA strong guard was left at the bridge, for, with all his confidence,\nColonel Smith was a skillful commander, and would neglect no\nprecaution to secure the safety of his troops. So careful was he that\nhe sent back a secret messenger from Lexington for more men. On press\nthe exulting soldiers, on through the streets of Concord in search of\nthe military stores. But lo! they had taken wings and flown to a place\nof safety. A few barrels of flour, half destroyed, a, few hundred\ncannon-balls thrown into wells, was the sole outcome of the intended\ndestruction. The Committee of Safety had performed their duty\ndiscreetly and in time.",
        "24. But hark! What means that musketry? Not the scattering fire of a\nskirmish, but volley answering volley! Has the impossible come to\npass? Have the rebels dared to fire upon the king’s troops? But the\nfiring grows warmer, louder. Hasten to the bridge lest retreat be cut\noff! The guards, sore beset, welcome the aid. Armed foes spring up on\nevery side! They are behind, before–everywhere! No safety now but in\ninstant, rapid retreat.",
        "  25. “You know the rest. In the books you have read,\n  How the British regulars fired and fled–\n  How the farmers gave them ball for ball,\n  From behind each fence and farm-yard wall;\n  Chasing the red-coats down the lane,\n  Then crossing the fields, to emerge again\n  Under the trees, at the bend of the road,\n  And only pausing to fire and load.”",
        "26. Discipline and valor are of no avail here. Vollied musketry has\nlittle chance against backwoods sharpshooters occupying every\nvantage ground that their knowledge of the country enabled them to do.\nThe day was wearing on. Noon found them a disorganized mass, flying\nthrough Lexington streets, the scene of their morning victory.",
        "27. In the mean time Lord Percy, with eight hundred fresh troops and\ntwo field-pieces, is marching out on the Lexington road; not that any\ndanger was apprehended, but simply as a precautionary measure. Between\ntwo and three o’clock, while yet two miles short of Lexington, ominous\nsounds of conflict smote his ears: not the rolling volleys and stately\ntread of victory, but the confused noise of fight and flight,\nbetokening irretrievable disaster. The fresh troops were formed into a\nhollow square, and pell-mell the hunted fugitives came rushing into\ntheir place of refuge. Exhausted by their long march and hot fight,\nmany of them fell prone upon the ground, “their tongues,” says a high\nauthority, “hanging out of their mouths.”",
        "28. But Lord Percy must not delay. Ten miles lie between him and\nsafety, and many hours of day remain before darkness will lend its\nfriendly aid. Short time for rest. Beat off the fierce and persistent\nattacks! Speed away while yet unsurrounded! A British army must never\nsuffer the humiliation of defeat and capture by a horde of rebel\nYankees. So through the afternoon the red-coats marched quickly,\nsullenly, dejectedly, fighting desperately for very life. The day\nclosed as they neared the river, and under the starlight they\nembarked, finding safety and rest at last–not quite yet, for as the\nlast boat left the shore a rifle blazed out, and one more victim was\nsent to atone for the wanton murder on Lexington Common.",
        "29. The eventful day ended with a loss on the part of the British of\ntwo hundred and seventy-three, while the aggregate loss of the\npatriots was one hundred and five. Without discipline, and with the\nmost reckless exposure to danger, they had inflicted a loss nearly\nthree times as great as they had sustained.",
        "30. The news of Lexington spread, everywhere producing wild\nexcitement. The notes of warlike preparation were heard throughout the\nland. With deliberate purpose General Gage had sown the dragon’s\nteeth, and there literally sprung up a bountiful crop of armed men.\nEvery village and every farm-house helped to swell the number. The\nremotest hamlet furnished its contingent. In distant Connecticut,\ngallant old General Putnam heard the news while plowing. Prompt as\nwhen he dragged the wolf from its den, he unyoked his oxen, left his\nplow in the furrow, and, leaping to his saddle, galloped to the fray.\nFiery Ethan Allen, at the head of his Green Mountain Boys, was eager\nto march, but paused to execute that marvelous enterprise which\nsecured for the patriot cause the formidable fortresses of Ticonderoga\nand Crown Point, with all their military stores. Day by day the\nmultitude increased, until thirty thousand men were encamped around\nBoston, from Charlestown Neck to Dorchester.",
        "31. From the evening of the Lexington fight General Gage was shut up\nin Boston. The patriots kept a strict guard on every road, and no\nparties were permitted to pass out or provisions to pass in. All\nsupplies for the town came by sea. The officers chafed under the\nenforced inactivity. They would be done with the ignoble work of\ndefense behind fortifications. They longed for an opportunity to\nregain the prestige lost on that fatal nineteenth of April. But\nGeneral Gage was too wise a commander to risk the safety of his army,\nso he held the impatience of his officers in check and awaited events.",
        "32. The patriot leaders were equally impatient. The enthusiasm of the\nmoment must be turned to good account. The men were all unused to\nliving in camps, and were peculiarly exposed to camp diseases and camp\nvices. Discipline had not yet counteracted the demoralizing tendencies\nof army life. The different divisions of the army were ranged under\nfavorite local leaders, and while there was some show of order there\nwas little or no concert of action. It was now the middle of June. Two\nmonths had elapsed since Lord Percy was driven back into Boston. All\nmeans to lure General Gage from the town had failed, and an aggressive\nmovement was devised. It was resolved to take a new position\nthreatening the town and the shipping in the port. The place selected\nwas the highland on the Charlestown peninsula known as Bunker Hill,\nand the time fixed upon for the enterprise the night of June 16th.",
        "33. Eight hundred men armed with shovels and picks assembled at six\no’clock. The movement was known to be a perilous one, and every man\nfelt that he took his life in his hand. President Langdon, of Harvard\nCollege, offered prayer with the ancient Puritan fervor. Colonel\nPrescott took command of the military operations and Colonel Gridley\nconducted the engineering. In early evening they set out. The march\nwas in profound silence. With suppressed breathing and stealthy tread\nthey made their way–an army of ghosts entering the land of shadows.\nBut the grim faces of the officers and the clinched hands of the men\nshowed more than ghostly purpose. About midnight the march ceased.\nClear in the starlight they could see British ship and camp, and could\nhear the sentinel proclaim, “All is well.” A redoubt eight rods\nsquare was laid out, and these eight hundred husbandmen bent their\nseasoned muscles to the work. The embankment grew up in the darkness,\nand at day-break its six feet of height amply protected the workers\nwithin.",
        "34. In the American camp all was excitement and expectation.\nSupporting parties were organized, supplies hurried up, and means for\nre-enforcement and retreat provided. It was now that the fatal\nweakness of the patriot organization was made manifest. Different\nleaders had notions inconsistent with each other, and divided councils\nled to indecisive action. The brunt of the coming engagement was left\nto one tenth of the patriot forces. Scarred veterans scented the\nbattle from afar, and hastened to the front to share the danger and\nthe glory. With no command, officers were content to act as volunteers\nand handle muskets. Putnam, with military foresight, took charge of\nthe line of communication, and with true farmer instinct he converted\ntwo rail-fences and a field of new-mown hay into a line of serviceable\nbreastworks reaching across Charlestown Neck into the country.",
        "35. At day-break the astonished Britons gazed upon this vision of the\nnight. A moment’s pause, then instantaneous, rapid action. That\nnocturnal growth threatened their very lives. Those audacious and\ninsolent rebels must be swept from existence. Without orders the\nBoston battery at Copp’s Hill opened upon the redoubt as soon as it\nwas discovered. Ships in the bay poured in furious broadsides. The\ncannonade awoke Boston from her slumbers. Citizens half dressed rushed\ninto the streets. Every roof and steeple that commanded a view of the\nscene was soon crowded with anxious spectators, who remained there\nduring the livelong day. Patriot and royalist mingled, and fierce\npassions and wordy wars accompanied the progress of the conflict\noutside. Exultation at patriot success was often too great to be\nsuppressed, and wild cheers sounded from the house-tops and echoed\nthrough the streets.",
        "36. So passed the forenoon. The little band on the hill, protected by\nthe earth-works, worked on with speed and safety. The hurtling masses\nof iron aimed at their destruction either buried themselves in the\nyielding earth or passed overhead without injury. One man only paid\nwith his life the penalty of his curiosity in looking over the\nbreastworks. An early luncheon was served and then work again. But\neven iron muscles have their limit of endurance, and the earth-walls\ngrew less rapidly as the day wore on, until at high noon work\naltogether ceased.",
        "37. But what of the enemy! By this time they are aware of the\nuselessness of their cannonade. Other and stronger measures must be\ntaken, and that on the instant. The military renown gained on so many\nbattle-fields must not be lost in a conflict with rude peasants–the\nbest point of vantage in a general war must not be lost to the king.\nEvery sentiment of ambition and loyalty urged to action. A ship\ndropped down the river and took position to command Charlestown Neck.\nBut the rail-fence and the new-mown hay resisted the shock, and the\nAmerican line remained unturned. Rough old Putnam’s foresight became\nan important factor in the day’s conflict.",
        "38. Suddenly the drum’s loud beat and the shrill scream of the fife\nstartled all hearts into a fiercer life. The notes, with no tremor of\nfear, rang out sonorous, triumphant. For centuries such notes had led\nBritons to victory, and to-day British soldiers will do or die. Four\nthousand grenadiers, under Lord Howe, march down to the shore with the\nquick, elastic tread of soldiers upon a holiday excursion. In that\nresolute front and precision of movement there was little to raise the\nspirits or inspire hope in the hearts of the thousands of patriotic\nobservers who were watching the movements with feverish anxiety. In\nperfect order they embark, and in perfect order they land upon the\nCharlestown shore. In their advance toward the silent redoubt no line\nwavered and no step faltered, though every man was aware of the\nfearful peril before him.",
        "39. Within the little earth-work all was activity and expectation.\nPomeroy, Stark, Putnam came to help–not to dictate. At the last\nmoment General Warren, from the State Committee of Safety, unable to\nconceal his anxiety, came and took his place in the ranks. These\nofficers all outranked Colonel Prescott, but neither of them would\ntake the command from the officer who had proved himself capable and\nworthy of it. Shovels and picks gave place to rifles and muskets, and,\nas experienced eyes glanced along the death-dealing tubes, grave\nsmiles lit up rugged faces at the thought of the welcome the enemy\nwould soon receive. “Be steady! Be firm!” is the parting injunction of\nPutnam, as he takes his way to his command at the rail-fence. “We must\nconquer or die,” is the sentiment of Warren, as he grasps the musket\nof a common soldier, showing to the last that noble patriotism which\nmakes his name so dear to all who love their country. “Keep cool. Wait\nuntil you see the color of their eyes! Aim at their red coats. Pick\noff their commanders!” are the fiery last commands of Prescott, as the\nscarlet column moved up the hill. Each soldier is in place, each eye\nunflinchingly is fixed on the enemy, and each right hand is pressed\nupon the musket, ready for the supreme moment.",
        "40. The batteries, which had been covering the advancing columns,\nceased as they neared the summit. An ominous silence succeeded the\ntumult of the preceding hours. No sound is heard but the short, quick\nwords of command in the British ranks, and the steady tread of the\nmarching files. The space had diminished to a few rods, and still a\ngrave-like silence wrapped the redoubt. At the last moment had the\nhearts of the patriots failed? Did the near approach of the red-coats\ndeprive them of their courage? By the double-quick, forward march!\"\nrang out from the British lines. A sudden rush, and one deafening\nvolley! Was it lightning from heaven that struck down every man in\ntheir first rank? Was it the earthquake’s shock that left those long\nlines of dead heaped like grass before the mower’s scythe? The rear\nranks, paralyzed by the terrible disaster, held their ground, but no\nhuman courage could withstand the fire that blazed fierce and\nmerciless from the redoubt. A moment’s pause, and then a wild,\nheadlong flight to the sheltering boats on the shore.",
        "41. As shouts of triumph went up from thousands of sympathizing\nhearts, the contending forces were in a state of intense activity.\nWithin the breastworks Prescott, cool, deliberate, masterful, watched\nevery detail and directed every action. Warren, Stark, and Pomeroy put\nsoul into every movement. Putnam defended his own line, and sent the\ngood news outward to cheer the thousands who had taken no part in the\ncontest, and to urge immediate re-enforcements. In the British\nquarters new officers took the place of those who lay stretched on the\nhill-side; the men were rallied and reformed; new regiments came over\nfrom Boston, and again four thousand men breasted the hill and marched\nup to the breastworks with colors flying and drums beating. This time\nthey were permitted to come within the reach of friendly greeting,\nwhen again a solid sheet of flame leaped forth from the breastworks,\nagain covering the earth with the dead. The rear columns for a few\nmoments stood fast, but nothing could withstand that hail of shot\naimed to take life, and again they fled to the shore.",
        "42. The day was wearing on. It was now five o’clock. If the Americans\ncan hold on until the friendly darkness sets in, they may retain\npossession of Charlestown and force the British to evacuate Boston.\nGeneral Ward was at Cambridge, trying in vain to secure order in time\nfor action. General Knox ranged up and down the lines, frantically\nurging the men to follow him to the fray. Putnam, blazing with\nexcitement and fully comprehending the danger, was everywhere\nanimating and urging on the fresh troops. Now he sent almost frantic\nappeals for powder; now he implored the men in reserve to move at\nonce, and now he rallied his own men to repel the attack upon his own\nlines. A considerable force was at last rallied to march, but upon\nreaching Charlestown Neck the firing from the British ships was so\ndeadly that they dared not venture to cross. In the redoubt was the\ncourage of despair. The powder had given out, and for many of the\nmuskets only a single cartridge remained to meet the coming charge.\nBut all remained firm while the sun slowly sunk in the west.",
        "43. After their second repulse, the force under Lord Howe, cowed and\ndemoralized, refuse to again advance into the jaws of death. The idea\nis gaining ground that the rebel position is impregnable, and that a\nwise policy demands that no more blood shall be shed in a vain\nendeavor to reduce it. The impetuous Sir Henry Clinton refuses to take\nthis view of the situation, and his counsels are heeded. Every\nmilitary resource at the command of General Gage is now brought into\nrequisition. All the ships in the harbor are ordered to direct their\nfire upon the fort and the line of communication. New batteries are\nerected by competent engineers to sweep through the outer breastworks\nand render them untenable. The reserve forces are ordered up, and\nevery available man is in the ranks. The charge must now be made on\nevery side and the little band of eight hundred literally crushed by\nnumbers. All this and the final charge must be made within the few\nhours of remaining daylight, or British power is forever at an end in\nAmerica.",
        "41. At last all preparation ends and the time for action arrives. Shot\nfrom the new batteries drive the defenders with severe loss within\ntheir interior defenses. The advance of the swarming enemies is met\nwith a feeble, scattering fire in place of the volleyed death of the\nprevious charges. Showers of stones and blows from clubbed muskets\ngreet those who first mount the ramparts; but nothing could resist the\nlast desperate bayonet charge of the British. The defenders of the\nfort slowly and sullenly retired before the overwhelming numbers of\ntheir adversaries. At the last moment Major Pitcairn meets his death,\nand thus expiates as far as possible his bloody orders at Lexington.\nAt nearly the same moment General Warren, in the very rear of the\nretreating troops, is shot, sealing with his life his devotion to his\ncountry. That the retreating Americans were not annihilated was due to\nthe rail-fence of General Putnam, and to his skill in holding the\nenemy in check while the flying fugitives found safety in the country.",
        "45. The battle of Bunker Hill is ended. The cross of St. George flies\nover Prescott’s redoubt. Four hundred and fifty patriots and fifteen\nhundred Britons are killed, wounded, and missing. Eighty-nine British\nofficers–numbers unprecedented–sleep in the dust. Patriot courage\nand endurance are found to equal patriot enthusiasm. Technically the\nbattle is lost; morally it is won. Where Warren fell a nation is born.\nThe Fourth of July records the fact–Yorktown attests the record. A\nnation is born–from the Pilgrims inheriting love of freedom, from\nstout Roger Williams toleration–a nation charged with the sacred\nmission of organizing human rights upon the basis of human liberty.",
