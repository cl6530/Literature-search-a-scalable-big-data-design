        "There were two divisions of the Winnebago Indians, one of which was paid\nby the Agent, at the Portage, the other at Prairie du Chien, by General\nStreet. The first, between four and five thousand in number, received,\naccording to treaty stipulations, fifteen thousand dollars annually,\nbesides a considerable amount of presents, and a certain number of\nrations of bread and pork, to be issued in times of emergency throughout\nthe year.",
        "The principal villages of this division of the tribe were at Lake\nWinnebago, Green and Fox Lakes, the Barribault, Mud Lake, the Four\nLakes, Kosh-ko-nong, and Turtle Creek. Messengers were dispatched, at or\nbefore the arrival of the annuity-money, to all the different villages,\nto notify the heads of families or lodges to assemble at “the Portage.”",
        "When arrived, the masters of families, under their different chiefs,\ngive in their names, and the number in their lodges, to be registered.\nAs, in paying, a certain sum of money is apportioned to each individual,\nit is, of course, an object to the head of a lodge to make the number\nregistered as great as possible. Each one brings his little bundle of\nsticks, and presents it to the Agent to register. Sometimes a dialogue\nlike the following occurs:",
        "“How many have you in your lodge?”",
        "The Indian carefully, and with great ceremony, counts his bundle of\nsticks–\"Fifteen”",
        "“How many men?”",
        "“Two.” The Agent lays aside two sticks",
        "“How many women?”",
        "“Three.” Three more sticks are separated.",
        "“How many children?”",
        "“Eight” Eight sticks are added to the heap.",
        "“What is the meaning of these two sticks that remain?”",
        "The culprit, whose arithmetic has not served him to carry out his\ndeception, disappears amid the shouts and jeers of his companions, who\nare always well pleased at the detection of any roguery in which they\nhave had no share.",
        "The young officers generally assisted in counting out and delivering the\nmoney at these payments, and it was no unusual thing, as the last band\ncame up, for the chiefs to take a quantity of silver out of the box and\nrequest their Father to pay his friends for their trouble, seeming\nreally disturbed at his refusal. In this, as in almost every instance,\nwe see the native courtesy and politeness, which are never lost sight of\namong them. If a party comes to their Father to beg for provisions, and\nfood is offered them, however hungry they may be, each waits patiently\nuntil one of the company makes an equal distribution of the whole, and\nthen, taking his share, eats it quietly, with the greatest moderation. I\nnever saw this rule violated, save in one instance.",
        "Our friend, Pawnee Blanc, the Old Dandy, once came with a party of\nIndians, requesting permission to dance for us in the open space before\nthe door. It was a warm, dusty afternoon, and as our friends grew heated\nand fatigued with the violent and long-continued exercise, a pitcher of\nraspberry negus was prepared and sent out to them. Pawnee received the\npitcher and tumbler, and, pouring the latter about half full, gave it to\nthe first of the circle, then filled the same for the next, and so on,\nuntil it suddenly occurred to him to look into the pitcher. What he saw\nthere determined his course of action; so, setting the tumbler upon the\nground, he raised the pitcher with both hands to his lips and gave a\nhearty pull, after which he went on, giving less and less, until he was\ncalled to have the pitcher replenished. All present agreed it was the\nonly instance they had ever witnessed, of an Indian’s appearing afraid\nof getting less of a thing than his share.",
        "During the payment a good many kegs of whiskey find their way into the\nlodges of the Indians, notwithstanding the watchfulness of both officers\nand Agent. Where there is a demand there will always be a supply, let\nthe legal prohibitions be what they may. The last day of the payment is,\ninvariably, one of general carousing.",
        "When the men begin their frolic, the women carefully gather all the\nguns, knives, tomahawks, and weapons of every description, and secrete\nthem, that as little mischief as possible may be done in the absence of\nall restraint and reason. I am sorry to record that our little friend,\nPawnee Blanc, was greatly addicted to the pleasures of the bottle.",
        "Among the presents for the chiefs, which Shaw-nee-aw-kee had brought\nfrom the East, was a trunk of blue cloth coats, trimmed with broad gold\nlace, and a box of round black hats, ornamented in a similar manner. All\nwho are familiar with Indians, of whatever tribe, will have observed\nthat their first step towards civilization, whether in man or woman, is\nmounting a man’s hat, decorated with tinsel; ribbons, or feathers.\nPawnee was among the happy number remembered in the distribution; so,\ndonning at once his new costume, and tying a few additional bunches of\ngay-colored ribbons to a long spear, that was always his baton of\nceremony, he came at once, followed by an admiring train, chiefly of\nwomen, to pay me a visit of state.",
        "The solemn gravity of his countenance, as he motioned away those who\nwould approach too near and finger his newly-received finery–the\ndignity with which he strutted along, edging this way and that to avoid\nany possible contact from homely, every-day wardrobes–augured well for\na continuance of propriety and self-respect, and a due consideration of\nthe good opinion of all around. But, alas for Pawnee! late in the day we\nsaw him assisted towards his lodge by two stout young Indians, who had\npulled him out of a ditch, his fine coat covered with mud, his hat\nbattered and bruised, his spear shorn of its gay streamers, and poor\nPawnee himself weeping and uttering all the doleful lamentations of a\ntipsy Indian.",
        "Among the women with whom I early made acquaintance was the wife of\nWau-kaun-zee-kah, the Yellow Thunder. She had accompanied her husband,\nwho was one of the deputation to visit the President, and from that time\nforth she had been known as “the Washington woman.” She had a pleasant,\nold-acquaintance sort of air in greeting me, as much as to say, “You\nand I have seen something of the world.” No expression of surprise or\nadmiration escaped her lips, as her companions, with childlike, laughing\nsimplicity, exclaimed and clapped their hands at the different wonderful\nobjects I showed them. Her deportment said plainly, “Yes, yes, my\nchildren, I have seen all these things before.” It was not until I put\nto her ear a tropical shell, of which I had a little cabinet, and she\nheard its murmuring sound, that she laid aside her apathy of manner. She\npoked her finger into the opening to get at the animal within, shook it\nviolently, then raised it to her ear again, and finally burst into a\nhearty laugh, and laid it down, acknowledging, by her looks, that this\nwas beyond her comprehension.",
        "I had one shell of peculiar beauty–my favorite in the whole\ncollection–a small conch, covered with rich, dark veins. Each of the\nvisitors successively took up this shell, and by words and gestures\nexpressed her admiration, evidently showing that she had an eye for\nbeauty–this was on the occasion of the parting visit of my red\ndaughters.",
        "Shortly after the payment had been completed, and the Indians had left,\nI discovered that my valued shell was missing from the collection. Could\nit be that one of the squaws had stolen it? It was possible–they would\noccasionally, though rarely, do such things under the influence of\nstrong temptation. I tried to recollect which, among the party, looked\nmost likely to have been the culprit. It could not have been the\nWashington woman–she was partly civilized, and knew better.",
        "A few weeks afterwards Mrs. Yellow Thunder again made her appearance,\nand carefully unfolding a gay-colored chintz shawl, which she carried\nrolled up in her hand, she produced the shell, and laid it on the table\nbefore me. I did not know whether to show, by my countenance,\ndispleasure at the trick she had played me, or joy at receiving my\ntreasure back again, but at length decided that it was the best policy\nto manifest no emotion whatever.",
        "She prolonged her visit until my husband’s return, and he then\nquestioned her about the matter.",
        "“She had taken the shell to her village, to show to some of her people,\nwho did not come to the payment.”",
        "“Why had she not asked her mother’s leave before carrying it away?”",
        "“Because she saw that her mother liked the shell, and she was afraid she\nwould say, No.”",
        "This was not the first instance in which Madame Washington had displayed\nthe shrewdness which was a predominant trait in her character. During\nthe visit of the Indians to the Eastern cities, they were taken to\nvarious exhibitions, museums, menageries, theatres, etc. It did not\nescape their observation that some silver was always paid before\nentrance, and they inquired the reason. It was explained to them. The\nwoman brightened up, as if struck with an idea.",
        "“How much do you pay for each one?”",
        "Her Father told her.",
        "“How do you say that in English?”",
        "“Two shillings.”",
        "“Two shinnin–humph” (good).",
        "The next day, when, as usual, visitors began to flock to the rooms where\nthe Indians were sojourning, the woman and a young Indian, her\nconfederate, took their station by the door, which they kept closed.\nWhen any one knocked, the door was cautiously opened, and the woman,\nextending her hand, exclaimed–”Two shinnin.”",
        "This was readily paid in each instance, and the game went on, until she\nhad accumulated a considerable sum. But this did not satisfy her. At the\nfirst attempt of a visitor to leave the room, the door was held close,\nas before, the hand was extended, and ’Two shinnin” again met his ear.\nHe tried to explain that, having paid for his entrance, he must go out\nfree. With an innocent shake of the head, ’Two shinnin,” was all the\nEnglish she could understand.",
        "The Agent, who had entered a short time before, and who, overhearing the\ndialogue, sat laughing behind his newspaper, waiting to see how it would\nall end, now came forward and interfered, and the guests were permitted\nto go forth without a further contribution.",
        "The good woman was moreover admonished that it was far from the custom\nof white people to tax their friends and visitors in this manner, and\nthat the practice must be laid aside in future.",
        "Another instance of the disposition of the Indians to avail themselves\nof all the goods that fortune throws in their way, was the following:",
        "Upon the same trip, while passing through Ohio, one of the party\ninquired of the Agent,–",
        "“Do you pay for all those provisions that are set before us at the\nhotels?”",
        "“Yes. Why do you ask?”",
        "“Nothing: I thought you perhaps paid for just what we ate of them.”",
        "At the next stopping-place a fine breakfast was set upon the table, of\nwhich, as usual, they partook plentifully. Just as they had finished,\nthe horn sounded for all to take their places in the stage-coaches. Each\nsprang to his feet. One seized the plates of biscuits and poured them\ninto the corner of his blanket; another the remains of a pair of\nchickens; a third emptied the sugar-bowls; each laid hold of what was\nnearest him, and in a trice nothing was left upon the table but the\nempty plates and dishes. The landlord and waiters, meanwhile, stood\nlaughing and enjoying the trick as much as any of the spectators.",
        "Upon another occasion, their Father had endeavored to impress upon them\nthe unseemliness of throwing their refuse pieces, bones, and fragments\nof food about on the table-cloth, pointing out to them the orderly\nmanner of the whites at table, and the propriety of keeping everything\nneat and nice around them.",
        "At their next meal, they were served first with a chicken-pie, of which\nthey ate very heartily, and the accumulation of bones on their plates\nwas very abundant. Presently another and more favorite dish appeared,–a\nfine, large, roasted turkey. A gentleman sat near, and was evidently\npreparing to carve it. No time was to be lost. What was to be done with\nthe bones? They looked around in some perplexity. A large apple-pie was\nstanding near. The most eager drew it towards him, and quick as thought\nall the bones were deposited upon it, while, with a triumphant laugh at\nthe happy idea, he coolly transferred the bird to his own dish, and\nproceeded to distribute it among his companions. The amazed stranger\nsoon joined in the laugh at the unceremonious manner in which his share\nof the dinner had vanished.",
