        "We had a pleasant little meal together, during which Holmes would\ntalk about nothing but violins, narrating with great exultation\nhow he had purchased his own Stradivarius, which was worth at\nleast five hundred guineas, at a Jew broker’s in Tottenham Court\nRoad for fifty-five shillings.  This led him to Paganini, and we\nsat for an hour over a bottle of claret while he told me anecdote\nafter anecdote of that extraordinary man.  The afternoon was far\nadvanced and the hot glare had softened into a mellow glow before\nwe found ourselves at the police-station.  Lestrade was waiting\nfor us at the door.",
        "“A telegram for you, Mr. Holmes,” said he.",
        "“Ha!  It is the answer!”  He tore it open, glanced his eyes over\nit, and crumpled it into his pocket.  “That’s all right,” said\nhe.",
        "“Have you found out anything?”",
        "“I have found out everything!”",
        "“What!” Lestrade stared at him in amazement.  “You are joking.”",
        "“I was never more serious in my life.  A shocking crime has been\ncommitted, and I think I have now laid bare every detail of it.”",
        "“And the criminal?”",
        "Holmes scribbled a few words upon the back of one of his visiting\ncards and threw it over to Lestrade.",
        "“That is the name,” he said.  “You cannot effect an arrest until\nto-morrow night at the earliest.  I should prefer that you do not\nmention my name at all in connection with the case, as I choose\nto be only associated with those crimes which present some\ndifficulty in their solution.  Come on, Watson.”  We strode off\ntogether to the station, leaving Lestrade still staring with a\ndelighted face at the card which Holmes had thrown him.",
        "\n“The case,” said Sherlock Holmes as we chatted over or cigars\nthat night in our rooms at Baker Street, “is one where, as in the\ninvestigations which you have chronicled under the names of ’A\nStudy in Scarlet’ and of ’The Sign of Four,’ we have been\ncompelled to reason backward from effects to causes.  I have\nwritten to Lestrade asking him to supply us with the details\nwhich are now wanting, and which he will only get after he had\nsecured his man.  That he may be safely trusted to do, for\nalthough he is absolutely devoid of reason, he is as tenacious as\na bulldog when he once understands what he has to do, and indeed,\nit is just this tenacity which has brought him to the top at\nScotland Yard.”",
        "“Your case is not complete, then?” I asked.",
        "“It is fairly complete in essentials.  We know who the author of\nthe revolting business is, although one of the victims still\nescapes us.  Of course, you have formed your own conclusions.”",
        "“I presume that this Jim Browner, the steward of a Liverpool\nboat, is the man whom you suspect?”",
        "“Oh! it is more than a suspicion.”",
        "“And yet I cannot see anything save very vague indications.”",
        "“On the contrary, to my mind nothing could be more clear.  Let me\nrun over the principal steps.  We approached the case, you\nremember, with an absolutely blank mind, which is always an\nadvantage.  We had formed no theories.  We were simply there to\nobserve and to draw inferences from our observations.  What did\nwe see first?  A very placid and respectable lady, who seemed\nquite innocent of any secret, and a portrait which showed me that\nshe had two younger sisters.  It instantly flashed across my mind\nthat the box might have been meant for one of these.  I set the\nidea aside as one which could be disproved or confirmed at our\nleisure.  Then we went to the garden, as you remember, and we saw\nthe very singular contents of the little yellow box.",
        "“The string was of the quality which is used by sail-makers\naboard ship, and at once a whiff of the sea was perceptible in\nour investigation.  When I observed that the knot was one which\nis popular with sailors, that the parcel had been posted at a\nport, and that the male ear was pierced for an earring which is\nso much more common among sailors than landsmen, I was quite\ncertain that all the actors in the tragedy were to be found among\nour seafaring classes.",
        "“When I came to examine the address of the packet I observed that\nit was to Miss S. Cushing.  Now, the oldest sister would, of\ncourse, be Miss Cushing, and although her initial was ’S’ it\nmight belong to one of the others as well.  In that case we\nshould have to commence our investigation from a fresh basis\naltogether.  I therefore went into the house with the intention\nof clearing up this point.  I was about to assure Miss Cushing\nthat I was convinced that a mistake had been made when you may\nremember that I came suddenly to a stop.  The fact was that I had\njust seen something which filled me with surprise and at the same\ntime narrowed the field of our inquiry immensely.",
        "“As a medical man, you are aware, Watson, that there is no part\nof the body which varies so much as the human ear.  Each ear is\nas a rule quite distinctive and differs from all other ones.  In\nlast year’s Anthropological Journal you will find two short\nmonographs from my pen upon the subject.  I had, therefore,\nexamined the ears in the box with the eyes of an expert and had\ncarefully noted their anatomical peculiarities.  Imagine my\nsurprise, then, when on looking at Miss Cushing I perceived that\nher ear corresponded exactly with the female ear which I had just\ninspected.  The matter was entirely beyond coincidence.  There\nwas the same shortening of the pinna, the same broad curve of the\nupper lobe, the same convolution of the inner cartilage.  In all\nessentials it was the same ear.",
        "“In the first place, her sister’s name was Sarah, and her address\nhad until recently been the same, so that it was quite obvious\nhow the mistake had occurred and for whom the packet was meant.\nThen we heard of this steward, married to the third sister, and\nlearned that he had at one time been so intimate with Miss Sarah\nthat she had actually gone up to Liverpool to be near the\nBrowners, but a quarrel had afterwards divided them.  This\nquarrel had put a stop to all communications for some months, so\nthat if Browner had occasion to address a packet to Miss Sarah,\nhe would undoubtedly have done so to her old address.",
        "“And now the matter had begun to straighten itself out\nwonderfully.  We had learned of the existence of this steward, an\nimpulsive man, of strong passions—you remember that he threw up\nwhat must have been a very superior berth in order to be nearer\nto his wife—subject, too, to occasional fits of hard drinking.\nWe had reason to believe that his wife had been murdered, and\nthat a man—presumably a seafaring man—had been murdered at the\nsame time.  Jealousy, of course, at once suggests itself as the\nmotive for the crime.  And why should these proofs of the deed be\nsent to Miss Sarah Cushing?  Probably because during her\nresidence in Liverpool she had some hand in bringing about the\nevents which led to the tragedy.  You will observe that this line\nof boats call at Belfast, Dublin, and Waterford; so that,\npresuming that Browner had committed the deed and had embarked at\nonce upon his steamer, the May Day, Belfast would be the first\nplace at which he cold post his terrible packet.",
        "“A second solution was at this stage obviously possible, and\nalthough I thought it exceedingly unlikely, I was determined to\nelucidate it before going further.  An unsuccessful lover might\nhave killed Mr. and Mrs. Browner, and the male ear might have\nbelonged to the husband.  There were many grave objections to\nthis theory, but it was conceivable.  I therefore sent off a\ntelegram to my friend Algar, of the Liverpool force, and asked\nhim to find our if Mrs. Browner were at home, and if Browner had\ndeparted in the May Day.  Then we went on to Wallington to visit\nMiss Sarah.",
        "“I was curious, in the first place, to see how far the family ear\nhad been reproduced in her.  Then, of course, she might give us\nvery important information, but I was not sanguine that she\nwould.  She must have heard of the business the day before, since\nall Croydon was ringing with it, and she alone could have\nunderstood for whom the packet was meant.  If she had been\nwilling to help justice she would probably have communicated with\nthe police already.  However, it was clearly our duty to see her,\nso we went.  We found that the news of the arrival of the packet-\n-for her illness dated from that time—had such an effect upon\nher as to bring on brain fever.  It was clearer than ever that\nshe understood its full significance, but equally clear that we\nshould have to wait some time for any assistance from her.",
        "“However, we were really independent of her help.  Our answers\nwere waiting for us at the police-station, where I had directed\nAlgar to send them.  Nothing could be more conclusive.  Mrs.\nBrowner’s house had been closed for more than three days, and the\nneighbours were of opinion that she had gone south to see her\nrelatives.  It had been ascertained at the shipping offices that\nBrowner had left aboard of the May Day, and I calculate that she\nis due in the Thames tomorrow night.  When he arrives he will be\nmet by the obtuse but resolute Lestrade, and I have no doubt that\nwe shall have all our details filled in.”",
        "Sherlock Holmes was not disappointed in his expectations.  Two\ndays later he received a bulky envelope, which contained a short\nnote from the detective, and a typewritten document, which\ncovered several pages of foolscap.",
        "“Lestrade has got him all right,” said Holmes, glancing up at me.\n“Perhaps it would interest you to hear what he says.",
        "“My dear Mr. Holmes:",
        "In accordance with the scheme which we had formed in order to\ntest our theories” [\"the ’we’ is rather fine, Watson, is it\nnot?\"] “I went down to the Albert Dock yesterday at 6 p.m., and\nboarded the S.S. May Day, belonging to the Liverpool, Dublin, and\nLondon Steam Packet Company.  On inquiry, I found that there was\na steward on board of the name of James Browner and that he had\nacted during the voyage in such an extraordinary manner that the\ncaptain had been compelled to relieve him of his duties.  On\ndescending to his berth, I found him seated upon a chest with his\nhead sunk upon his hands, rocking himself to and fro.  He is a\nbig, powerful chap, clean-shaven, and very swarthy—something\nlike Aldrige, who helped us in the bogus laundry affair.  He\njumped up when he heard my business, and I had my whistle to my\nlips to call a couple of river police, who were round the corner,\nbut he seemed to have no heart in him, and he held out his hands\nquietly enough for the darbies.  We brought him along to the\ncells, and his box as well, for we thought there might be\nsomething incriminating; but, bar a big sharp knife such as most\nsailors have, we got nothing for our trouble.  However, we find\nthat we shall want no more evidence, for on being brought before\nthe inspector at the station he asked leave to make a statement,\nwhich was, of course, taken down, just as he made it, by our\nshorthand man.  We had three copies typewritten, one of which I\nenclose.  The affair proves, as I always thought it would, to be\nan extremely simple one, but I am obliged to you for assisting me\nin my investigation.  With kind regards,",
        "“Yours very truly,",
        "“G. Lestrade.",
        "“Hum!  The investigation really was a very simple one,” remarked\nHolmes, “but I don’t think it struck him in that light when he\nfirst called us in.  However, let us see what Jim Browner has to\nsay for himself.  This is his statement as made before Inspector\nMontgomery at the Shadwell Police Station, and it has the\nadvantage of being verbatim.”",
        "\n“’Have I anything to say?  Yes, I have a deal to say.  I have to\nmake a clean breast of it all.  You can hang me, or you can leave\nme alone.  I don’t care a plug which you do.  I tell you I’ve not\nshut an eye in sleep since I did it, and I don’t believe I ever\nwill again until I get past all waking.  Sometimes it’s his face,\nbut most generally it’s hers.  I’m never without one or the other\nbefore me.  He looks frowning and black-like, but she has a kind\no’ surprise upon her face.  Ay, the white lamb, she might well be\nsurprised when she read death on a face that had seldom looked\nanything but love upon her before.",
        "“’But it was Sarah’s fault, and may the curse of a broken man put\na blight on her and set the blood rotting in her veins!  It’s not\nthat I want to clear myself.  I know that I went back to drink,\nlike the beast that I was.  But she would have forgiven me; she\nwould have stuck as close to me a rope to a block if that woman\nhad never darkened our door.  For Sarah Cushing loved me—that’s\nthe root of the business—she loved me until all her love turned\nto poisonous hate when she knew that I thought more of my wife’s\nfootmark in the mud than I did of her whole body and soul.",
        "“’There were three sisters altogether.  The old one was just a\ngood woman, the second was a devil, and the third was an angel.\nSarah was thirty-three, and Mary was twenty-nine when I married.\nWe were just as happy as the day was long when we set up house\ntogether, and in all Liverpool there was no better woman than my\nMary.  And then we asked Sarah up for a week, and the week grew\ninto a month, and one thing led to another, until she was just\none of ourselves.",
        "“’I was blue ribbon at that time, and we were putting a little\nmoney by, and all was as bright as a new dollar.  My God, whoever\nwould have thought that it cold have come to this?  Whoever would\nhave dreamed it?",
        "“’I used to be home for the week-ends very often, and sometimes\nif the ship were held back for cargo I would have a whole week at\na time, and in this way I saw a deal of my sister-in-law, Sarah.\nShe was a fine tall woman, black and quick and fierce, with a\nproud way of carrying her head, and a glint from her eye like a\nspark from a flint. But when little Mary was there I had never a\nthought of her, and that I swear as I hope for God’s mercy.",
        "“’It had seemed to me sometimes that she liked to be alone with\nme, or to coax me out for a walk with her, but I had never\nthought anything of that.  But one evening my eyes were opened.\nI had come up from the ship and found my wife out, but Sarah at\nhome.  “Where’s Mary?” I asked.  “Oh, she has gone to pay some\naccounts.”  I was impatient and paced up and down the room.\n“Can’t you be happy for five minutes without Mary, Jim?” says\nshe.  “It’s a bad compliment to me that you can’t be contented\nwith my society for so short a time.”  “That’s all right, my\nlass,” said I, putting out my hand towards her in a kindly way,\nbut she had it in both hers in an instant, and they burned as if\nthey were in a fever.  I looked into her eyes and I read it all\nthere.  There was no need for her to speak, nor for me either.  I\nfrowned and drew my hand away.  Then she stood by my side in\nsilence for a bit, and then put up her hand and patted me on the\nshoulder.  “Steady old Jim!” said she, and with a kind o’ mocking\nlaugh, she ran out of the room.",
        "“’Well, from that time Sarah hated me with her whole heart and\nsoul, and she is a woman who can hate, too. I was a fool to let\nher go on biding with us—a besotted fool—but I never said a\nword to Mary, for I knew it would grieve her.  Things went on\nmuch as before, but after a time I began to find that there was a\nbit of a change in Mary herself.  She had always been so trusting\nand so innocent, but now she became queer and suspicious, wanting\nto know where I had been and what I had been doing, and whom my\nletters were from, and what I had in my pockets, and a thousand\nsuch follies.  Day by day she grew queerer and more irritable,\nand we had ceaseless rows about nothing.  I was fairly puzzled by\nit all.  Sarah avoided me now, but she and Mary were just\ninseparable.  I can see now how she was plotting and scheming and\npoisoning my wife’s mind against me, but I was such a blind\nbeetle that I could not understand it at the time.  Then I broke\nmy blue ribbon and began to drink again, but I think I should not\nhave done it if Mary had been the same as ever. She had some\nreason to be disgusted with me now, and the gap between us began\nto be wider and wider.  And then this Alec Fairbairn chipped in,\nand things became a thousand times blacker.",
        "“’It was to see Sarah that he came to my house first, but soon it\nwas to see us, for he was a man with winning ways, and he made\nfriends wherever he went.  He was a dashing, swaggering chap,\nsmart and curled, who had seen half the world and could talk of\nwhat he had seen.  He was good company, I won’t deny it, and he\nhad wonderful polite ways with him for a sailor man, so that I\nthink there must have been a time when he knew more of the poop\nthan the forecastle.  For a month he was in and out of my house,\nand never once did it cross my mind that harm might come of his\nsoft, tricky ways.  And then at last something made me suspect,\nand from that day my peace was gone forever.",
        "“’It was only a little thing, too.  I had come into the parlour\nunexpected, and as I walked in at the door I saw a light of\nwelcome on my wife’s face.  But as she saw who it was it faded\nagain, and she turned away with a look of disappointment.  That\nwas enough for me.  There was no one but Alec Fairbairn whose\nstep she could have mistaken for mine.  If I could have seen him\nthen I should have killed him, for I have always been like a\nmadman when my temper gets loose.  Mary saw the devil’s light in\nmy eyes, and she ran forward with her hands on my sleeve.\n“Don’t, Jim, don’t!” says she.  “Where’s Sarah?” I asked.  “In\nthe kitchen,” says she.  “Sarah,” says I as I went in, “this man\nFairbairn is never to darken my door again.”  “Why not?” says\nshe.  “Because I order it.”  “Oh!” says she, “if my friends are\nnot good enough for this house, then I am not good enough for it\neither.”  “You can do what you like,” says I, “but if Fairbairn\nshows his face here again I’ll send you one of his ears for a\nkeepsake.”  She was frightened by my face, I think, for she never\nanswered a word, and the same evening she left my house.",
        "“’Well, I don’t know now whether it was pure devilry on the part\nof this woman, or whether she thought that she could turn me\nagainst my wife by encouraging her to misbehave.  Anyway, she\ntook a house just two streets off and let lodgings to sailors.\nFairbairn used to stay there, and Mary would go round to have tea\nwith her sister and him.  How often she went I don’t know, but I\nfollowed her one day, and as I broke in at the door Fairbairn got\naway over the back garden wall, like the cowardly skunk that he\nwas.  I swore to my wife that I would kill her if I found her in\nhis company again, and I led her back with me, sobbing and\ntrembling, and as white as a piece of paper.  There was no trace\nof love between us any longer.  I could see that she hated me and\nfeared me, and when the thought of it drove me to drink, then she\ndespised me as well.",
        "“’Well, Sarah found that she could not make a living in\nLiverpool, so she went back, as I understand, to live with her\nsister in Croydon, and things jogged on much the same as ever at\nhome.  And then came this week and all the misery and ruin.",
        "“’It was in this way.  We had gone on the May Day for a round\nvoyage of seven days, but a hogshead got loose and started one of\nour plates, so that we had to put back into port for twelve\nhours.  I left the ship and came home, thinking what a surprise\nit would be for my wife, and hoping that maybe she would be glad\nto see me so soon.  The thought was in my head as I turned into\nmy own street, and at that moment a cab passed me, and there she\nwas, sitting by the side of Fairbairn, the two chatting and\nlaughing, with never a thought for me as I stood watching them\nfrom the footpath.",
        "“’I tell you, and I give you my word for it, that from that\nmoment I was not my own master, and it is all like a dim dream\nwhen I look back on it.  I had been drinking hard of late, and\nthe two things together fairly turned my brain.  There’s\nsomething throbbing in my head now, like a docker’s hammer, but\nthat morning I seemed to have all Niagara whizzing and buzzing in\nmy ears.",
        "“’Well, I took to my heels, and I ran after the cab.  I had a\nheavy oak stick in my hand, and I tell you I saw red from the\nfirst; but as I ran I got cunning, too, and hung back a little to\nsee them without being seen.  They pulled up soon at the railway\nstation.  There was a good crowd round the booking-office, so I\ngot quite close to them without being seen.  They took tickets\nfor New Brighton.  So did I, but I got in three carriages behind\nthem.  When we reached it they walked along the Parade, and I was\nnever more than a hundred yards from them.  At last I saw them\nhire a boat and start for a row, for it was a very hot day, and\nthey thought, no doubt, that it would be cooler on the water.",
        "“’It was just as if they had been given into my hands.  There was\na bit of a haze, and you could not see more than a few hundred\nyards.  I hired a boat for myself, and I pulled after them.  I\ncould see the blur of their craft, but they were going nearly as\nfast as I, and they must have been a long mile from the shore\nbefore I caught them up.  The haze was like a curtain all round\nus, and there were we three in the middle of it.  My God, shall I\never forget their faces when they saw who was in the boat that\nwas closing in upon them?  She screamed out.  He swore like a\nmadman and jabbed at me with an oar, for he must have seen death\nin my eyes.  I got past it and got one in with my stick that\ncrushed his head like an egg.  I would have spared her, perhaps,\nfor all my madness, but she threw her arms round him, crying out\nto him, and calling him “Alec.”  I struck again, and she lay\nstretched beside him.  I was like a wild beast then that had\ntasted blood.  If Sarah had been there, by the Lord, she should\nhave joined them.  I pulled out my knife, and—well, there! I’ve\nsaid enough.  It gave me a kind of savage joy when I thought how\nSarah would feel when she had such signs as these of what her\nmeddling had brought about.  Then I tied the bodies into the\nboat, stove a plank, and stood by until they had sunk.  I knew\nvery well that the owner would think that they had lost their\nbearings in the haze, and had drifted off out to sea.  I cleaned\nmyself up, got back to land, and joined my ship without a soul\nhaving a suspicion of what had passed.  That night I made up the\npacket for Sarah Cushing, and next day I sent it from Belfast.",
        "“’There you have the whole truth of it.  You can hang me, or do\nwhat you like with me, but you cannot punish me as I have been\npunished already.  I cannot shut my eyes but I see those two\nfaces staring at me—staring at me as they stared when my boat\nbroke through the haze.  I killed them quick, but they are\nkilling me slow; and if I have another night of it I shall be\neither mad or dead before morning.  You won’t put me alone into a\ncell, sir?  For pity’s sake don’t, and may you be treated in your\nday of agony as you treat me now.’",
        "“What is the meaning of it, Watson?” said Holmes solemnly as he\nlaid down the paper.  “What object is served by this circle of\nmisery and violence and fear?  It must tend to some end, or else\nour universe is ruled by chance, which is unthinkable.  But what\nend?  There is the great standing perennial problem to which\nhuman reason is as far from an answer as ever.”",
