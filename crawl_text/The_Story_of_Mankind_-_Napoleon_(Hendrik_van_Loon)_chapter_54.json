        "NAPOLEON",
        "NAPOLEON was born in the year 1769, the third son\nof Carlo Maria Buonaparte, an honest notary public of\nthe city of Ajaccio in the island of Corsica, and his good\nwife, Letizia Ramolino. He therefore was not a Frenchman,\nbut an Italian whose native island (an old Greek, Carthaginian\nand Roman colony in the Mediterranean Sea) had\nfor years been struggling to regain its independence,\nfirst of all from the Genoese, and after the middle of the\neighteenth century from the French, who had kindly offered\nto help the Corsicans in their struggle for freedom and had\nthen occupied the island for their own benefit.",
        "During the first twenty years of his life, young Napoleon\nwas a professional Corsican patriot–a Corsican Sinn Feiner,\nwho hoped to deliver his beloved country from the yoke of the\nbitterly hated French enemy. But the French revolution had\nunexpectedly recognised the claims of the Corsicans and gradually\nNapoleon, who had received a good training at the military\nschool of Brienne, drifted into the service of his adopted country.\nAlthough he never learned to spell French correctly or\nto speak it without a broad Italian accent, he became a Frenchman.\nIn due time he came to stand as the highest expression\nof all French virtues. At present he is regarded as the symbol\nof the Gallic genius.",
        "Napoleon was what is called a fast worker. His career\ndoes not cover more than twenty years. In that short span\nof time he fought more wars and gained more victories and\nmarched more miles and conquered more square kilometers and\nkilled more people and brought about more reforms and generally\nupset Europe to a greater extent than anybody (including\nAlexander the Great and Jenghis Khan) had ever managed\nto do.",
        "He was a little fellow and during the first years of his life\nhis health was not very good. He never impressed anybody\nby his good looks and he remained to the end of his days very\nclumsy whenever he was obliged to appear at a social function.\nHe did not enjoy a single advantage of breeding or birth or\nriches. For the greater part of his youth he was desperately\npoor and often he had to go without a meal or was obliged\nto make a few extra pennies in curious ways.",
        "He gave little promise as a literary genius. When he competed\nfor a prize offered by the Academy of Lyons, his essay\nwas found to be next to the last and he was number 15 out of\n16 candidates. But he overcame all these difficulties through\nhis absolute and unshakable belief in his own destiny, and in\nhis own glorious future. Ambition was the main-spring of his\nlife. The thought of self, the worship of that capital letter\n“N” with which he signed all his letters, and which recurred\nforever in the ornaments of his hastily constructed palaces, the\nabsolute will to make the name Napoleon the most important\nthing in the world next to the name of God, these desires carried\nNapoleon to a pinnacle of fame which no other man has\never reached.",
        "When he was a half-pay lieutenant, young Bonaparte was\nvery fond of the “Lives of Famous Men” which Plutarch, the\nRoman historian, had written. But he never tried to live up\nto the high standard of character set by these heroes of the\nolder days. Napoleon seems to have been devoid of all those\nconsiderate and thoughtful sentiments which make men\ndifferent from the animals. It will be very difficult to decide\nwith any degree of accuracy whether he ever loved anyone\nbesides himself. He kept a civil tongue to his mother, but\nLetizia had the air and manners of a great lady and after the\nfashion of Italian mothers, she knew how to rule her brood of\nchildren and command their respect. For a few years he was\nfond of Josephine, his pretty Creole wife, who was the daughter\nof a French officer of Martinique and the widow of the\nVicomte de Beauharnais, who had been executed by Robespierre\nwhen he lost a battle against the Prussians. But\nthe Emperor divorced her when she failed to give him a son\nand heir and married the daughter of the Austrian Emperor,\nbecause it seemed good policy.",
        "During the siege of Toulon, where he gained great fame\nas commander of a battery, Napoleon studied Macchiavelli\nwith industrious care. He followed the advice of the Florentine\nstatesman and never kept his word when it was to his\nadvantage to break it. The word “gratitude” did not occur in\nhis personal dictionary. Neither, to be quite fair, did he expect\nit from others. He was totally indifferent to human suffering.\nHe executed prisoners of war (in Egypt in 1798) who had\nbeen promised their lives, and he quietly allowed his wounded\nin Syria to be chloroformed when he found it impossible to\ntransport them to his ships. He ordered the Duke of Enghien\nto be condemned to death by a prejudiced court-martial and to\nbe shot contrary to all law on the sole ground that the\n“Bourbons needed a warning.” He decreed that those German\nofficers who were made prisoner while fighting for their\ncountry’s independence should be shot against the nearest wall,\nand when Andreas Hofer, the Tyrolese hero, fell into his hands\nafter a most heroic resistance, he was executed like a common\ntraitor.",
        "In short, when we study the character of the Emperor, we\nbegin to understand those anxious British mothers who used\nto drive their children to bed with the threat that “Bonaparte,\nwho ate little boys and girls for breakfast, would come and get\nthem if they were not very good.” And yet, having said these\nmany unpleasant things about this strange tyrant, who looked\nafter every other department of his army with the utmost care,\nbut neglected the medical service, and who ruined his uniforms\nwith Eau de Cologne because he could not stand the smell of\nhis poor sweating soldiers; having said all these unpleasant\nthings and being fully prepared to add many more, I must\nconfess to a certain lurking feeling of doubt.",
        "Here I am sitting at a comfortable table loaded heavily\nwith books, with one eye on my typewriter and the other on\nLicorice the cat, who has a great fondness for carbon paper,\nand I am telling you that the Emperor Napoleon was a most\ncontemptible person. But should I happen to look out of\nthe window, down upon Seventh Avenue, and should the endless\nprocession of trucks and carts come to a sudden halt, and\nshould I hear the sound of the heavy drums and see the little\nman on his white horse in his old and much-worn green uniform,\nthen I don’t know, but I am afraid that I would leave\nmy books and the kitten and my home and everything else to\nfollow him wherever he cared to lead. My own grandfather\ndid this and Heaven knows he was not born to be a hero.\nMillions of other people’s grandfathers did it. They received\nno reward, but they expected none. They cheerfully\ngave legs and arms and lives to serve this foreigner, who took\nthem a thousand miles away from their homes and marched\nthem into a barrage of Russian or English or Spanish or\nItalian or Austrian cannon and stared quietly into space while\nthey were rolling in the agony of death.",
        "If you ask me for an explanation, I must answer that I\nhave none. I can only guess at one of the reasons. Napoleon\nwas the greatest of actors and the whole European continent\nwas his stage. At all times and under all circumstances\nhe knew the precise attitude that would impress the spectators\nmost and he understood what words would make the deepest\nimpression. Whether he spoke in the Egyptian desert, before\nthe backdrop of the Sphinx and the pyramids, or addressed\nhis shivering men on the dew-soaked plains of Italy, made no\ndifference. At all times he was master of the situation. Even\nat the end, an exile on a little rock in the middle of the Atlantic,\na sick man at the mercy of a dull and intolerable British governor,\nhe held the centre of the stage.",
        "After the defeat of Waterloo, no one outside of a few\ntrusted friends ever saw the great Emperor. The people of\nEurope knew that he was living on the island of St. Helena–\nthey knew that a British garrison guarded him day and night\n–they knew that the British fleet guarded the garrison which\nguarded the Emperor on his farm at Longwood. But he was\nnever out of the mind of either friend or enemy. When illness\nand despair had at last taken him away, his silent eyes continued\nto haunt the world. Even to-day he is as much of a force\nin the life of France as a hundred years ago when people\nfainted at the mere sight of this sallow-faced man who stabled\nhis horses in the holiest temples of the Russian Kremlin, and\nwho treated the Pope and the mighty ones of this earth as if\nthey were his lackeys.",
        "To give you a mere outline of his life would demand\ncouple of volumes. To tell you of his great political reform\nof the French state, of his new codes of laws which were\nadopted in most European countries, of his activities in every\nfield of public activity, would take thousands of pages. But\nI can explain in a few words why he was so successful during\nthe first part of his career and why he failed during the last\nten years. From the year 1789 until the year 1804, Napoleon\nwas the great leader of the French revolution. He was not\nmerely fighting for the glory of his own name. He defeated\nAustria and Italy and England and Russia because he, himself,\nand his soldiers were the apostles of the new creed of\n“Liberty, Fraternity and Equality” and were the enemies of\nthe courts while they were the friends of the people.",
        "But in the year 1804, Napoleon made himself Hereditary\nEmperor of the French and sent for Pope Pius VII to come\nand crown him, even as Leo III, in the year 800 had crowned\nthat other great King of the Franks, Charlemagne, whose example\nwas constantly before Napoleon’s eyes.",
        "Once upon the throne, the old revolutionary chieftain became\nan unsuccessful imitation of a Habsburg monarch. He\nforgot his spiritual Mother, the Political Club of the Jacobins.\nHe ceased to be the defender of the oppressed. He became the\nchief of all the oppressors and kept his shooting squads ready\nto execute those who dared to oppose his imperial will. No\none had shed a tear when in the year 1806 the sad remains of\nthe Holy Roman Empire were carted to the historical dustbin\nand when the last relic of ancient Roman glory was destroyed\nby the grandson of an Italian peasant. But when the Napoleonic\narmies had invaded Spain, had forced the Spaniards to\nrecognise a king whom they detested, had massacred the poor\nMadrilenes who remained faithful to their old rulers, then\npublic opinion turned against the former hero of Marengo and\nAusterlitz and a hundred other revolutionary battles. Then\nand only then, when Napoleon was no longer the hero of the\nrevolution but the personification of all the bad traits of the\nOld Regime, was it possible for England to give direction to\nthe fast-spreading sentiment of hatred which was turning all\nhonest men into enemies of the French Emperor.",
        "The English people from the very beginning had felt\ndeeply disgusted when their newspapers told them the gruesome\ndetails of the Terror. They had staged their own great\nrevolution (during the reign of Charles I) a century before.\nIt had been a very simple affair compared to the upheaval of\nParis. In the eyes of the average Englishman a Jacobin was\na monster to be shot at sight and Napoleon was the Chief Devil.\nThe British fleet had blockaded France ever since the year\n1798. It had spoiled Napoleon’s plan to invade India by way\nof Egypt and had forced him to beat an ignominious retreat,\nafter his victories along the banks of the Nile. And finally,\nin the year 1805, England got the chance it had waited for so\nlong.",
        "Near Cape Trafalgar on the southwestern coast of Spain,\nNelson annihilated the Napoleonic fleet, beyond a possible\nchance of recovery. From that moment on, the Emperor was\nlandlocked. Even so, he would have been able to maintain\nhimself as the recognised ruler of the continent had he understood\nthe signs of the times and accepted the honourable peace\nwhich the powers offered him. But Napoleon had been blinded\nby the blaze of his own glory. He would recognise no equals.\nHe could tolerate no rivals. And his hatred turned against\nRussia, the mysterious land of the endless plains with its\ninexhaustible supply of cannon-fodder.",
        "As long as Russia was ruled by Paul I, the half-witted son\nof Catherine the Great, Napoleon had known how to deal with\nthe situation. But Paul grew more and more irresponsible\nuntil his exasperated subjects were obliged to murder him\n(lest they all be sent to the Siberian lead-mines) and the son of\nPaul, the Emperor Alexander, did not share his father’s affection\nfor the usurper whom he regarded as the enemy of mankind,\nthe eternal disturber of the peace. He was a pious man\nwho believed that he had been chosen by God to deliver the\nworld from the Corsican curse. He joined Prussia and England\nand Austria and he was defeated. He tried five times\nand five times he failed. In the year 1812 he once more taunted\nNapoleon until the French Emperor, in a blind rage, vowed\nthat he would dictate peace in Moscow. Then, from far and\nwide, from Spain and Germany and Holland and Italy and\nPortugal, unwilling regiments were driven northward, that the\nwounded pride of the great Emperor might be duly avenged.\nThe rest of the story is common knowledge. After a march\nof two months, Napoleon reached the Russian capital and\nestablished his headquarters in the holy Kremlin. On the night\nof September 15 of the year 1812, Moscow caught fire. The\ntown burned four days. When the evening of the fifth day\ncame, Napoleon gave the order for the retreat. Two weeks\nlater it began to snow. The army trudged through mud and\nsleet until November the 26th when the river Berezina was\nreached. Then the Russian attacks began in all seriousness.\nThe Cossacks swarmed around the “Grande Armee” which\nwas no longer an army but a mob. In the middle of December\nthe first of the survivors began to be seen in the German cities\nof the East.",
        "Then there were many rumours of an impending revolt.\n“The time has come,” the people of Europe said, “to free ourselves\nfrom this insufferable yoke.” And they began to look\nfor old shotguns which had escaped the eye of the ever-present\nFrench spies. But ere they knew what had happened, Napoleon\nwas back with a new army. He had left his defeated soldiers\nand in his little sleigh had rushed ahead to Paris, making\na final appeal for more troops that he might defend the sacred\nsoil of France against foreign invasion.",
        "Children of sixteen and seventeen followed him when he\nmoved eastward to meet the allied powers. On October 16,\n18, and 19 of the year 1813, the terrible battle of Leipzig took\nplace where for three days boys in green and boys in blue\nfought each other until the Elbe ran red with blood. On the\nafternoon of the 17th of October, the massed reserves of Russian\ninfantry broke through the French lines and Napoleon\nfled.",
        "Back to Paris he went. He abdicated in favour of his small\nson, but the allied powers insisted that Louis XVIII, the\nbrother of the late king Louis XVI, should occupy the French\nthrone, and surrounded by Cossacks and Uhlans, the dull-eyed\nBourbon prince made his triumphal entry into Paris.",
        "As for Napoleon he was made the sovereign ruler of the\nlittle island of Elba in the Mediterranean where he organised\nhis stable boys into a miniature army and fought battles on a\nchess board.",
        "But no sooner had he left France than the people began\nto realise what they had lost. The last twenty years, however\ncostly, had been a period of great glory. Paris had been the\ncapital of the world. The fat Bourbon king who had learned\nnothing and had forgotten nothing during the days of his\nexile disgusted everybody by his indolence.",
        "On the first of March of the year 1815, when the representatives\nof the allies were ready to begin the work of unscrambling\nthe map of Europe, Napoleon suddenly landed near\nCannes. In less than a week the French army had deserted\nthe Bourbons and had rushed southward to offer their swords\nand bayonets to the “little Corporal.” Napoleon marched\nstraight to Paris where he arrived on the twentieth of March.\nThis time he was more cautious. He offered peace, but the\nallies insisted upon war. The whole of Europe arose against\nthe “perfidious Corsican.” Rapidly the Emperor marched\nnorthward that he might crush his enemies before they should\nbe able to unite their forces. But Napoleon was no longer his\nold self. He felt sick. He got tired easily. He slept when he\nought to have been up directing the attack of his advance-\nguard. Besides, he missed many of his faithful old generals.\nThey were dead.",
        "Early in June his armies entered Belgium. On the 16th\nof that month he defeated the Prussians under Blucher. But\na subordinate commander failed to destroy the retreating army\nas he had been ordered to do.",
        "Two days later, Napoleon met Wellington near Waterloo.\nIt was the 18th of June, a Sunday. At two o’clock of the\nafternoon, the battle seemed won for the French. At three a\nspeck of dust appeared upon the eastern horizon. Napoleon\nbelieved that this meant the approach of his own cavalry who\nwould now turn the English defeat into a rout. At four o’clock\nhe knew better. Cursing and swearing, old Blucher drove\nhis deathly tired troops into the heart of the fray. The shock\nbroke the ranks of the guards. Napoleon had no further reserves.\nHe told his men to save themselves as best they could,\nand he fled.",
        "For a second time, he abdicated in favor of his son. Just\none hundred days after his escape from Elba, he was making\nfor the coast. He intended to go to America. In the year\n1803, for a mere song, he had sold the French colony of\nLouisiana (which was in great danger of being captured by\nthe English) to the young American Republic. “The Americans,\"\nso he said, “will be grateful and will give me a little bit\nof land and a house where I may spend the last days of my life\nin peace and quiet.” But the English fleet was watching all\nFrench harbours. Caught between the armies of the Allies\nand the ships of the British, Napoleon had no choice. The\nPrussians intended to shoot him. The English might be more\ngenerous. At Rochefort he waited in the hope that something\nmight turn up. One month after Waterloo, he received orders\nfrom the new French government to leave French soil inside\nof twenty-four hours. Always the tragedian, he wrote a letter\nto the Prince Regent of England (George IV, the king, was\nin an insane asylum) informing His Royal Highness of his\nintention to “throw himself upon the mercy of his enemies and\nlike Themistocles, to look for a welcome at the fireside of his\nfoes . . .",
        "On the 15th of July he went on board the “Bellerophon,\"\nand surrendered his sword to Admiral Hotham. At Plymouth\nhe was transferred to the “Northumberland” which carried him\nto St. Helena. There he spent the last seven years of his\nlife. He tried to write his memoirs, he quarrelled with his\nkeepers and he dreamed of past times. Curiously enough he\nreturned (at least in his imagination) to his original point of\ndeparture. He remembered the days when he had fought the\nbattles of the Revolution. He tried to convince himself that\nhe had always been the true friend of those great principles of\n“Liberty, Fraternity and Equality” which the ragged soldiers\nof the convention had carried to the ends of the earth. He\nliked to dwell upon his career as Commander-in-Chief and\nConsul. He rarely spoke of the Empire. Sometimes he\nthought of his son, the Duke of Reichstadt, the little eagle,\nwho lived in Vienna, where he was treated as a “poor relation\"\nby his young Habsburg cousins, whose fathers had trembled at\nthe very mention of the name of Him. When the end came,\nhe was leading his troops to victory. He ordered Ney to attack\nwith the guards. Then he died.",
        "But if you want an explanation of this strange career, if\nyou really wish to know how one man could possibly rule so\nmany people for so many years by the sheer force of his will,\ndo not read the books that have been written about him. Their\nauthors either hated the Emperor or loved him. You will\nlearn many facts, but it is more important to “feel history\"\nthan to know it. Don’t read, but wait until you have a chance\nto hear a good artist sing the song called “The Two Grenadiers.\"\nThe words were written by Heine, the great German\npoet who lived through the Napoleonic era. The music was\ncomposed by Schumann, a German who saw the Emperor,\nthe enemy of his country, whenever he came to visit his imperial\nfather-in-law. The song therefore is the work of two\nmen who had every reason to hate the tyrant.",
        "Go and hear it. Then you will understand what a thousand\nvolumes could not possibly tell you.",
