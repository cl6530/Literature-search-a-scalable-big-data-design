        "Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his\nsuccessful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the\nvestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw\nElizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards\nthe staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and\ncongratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy\nprospect or their nearer connection.  Mr. Collins received and\nreturned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then\nproceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the\nresult of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied,\nsince the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him\nwould naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine\ndelicacy of her character.",
        "This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would\nhave been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had\nmeant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals,\nbut she dared not believe it, and could not help saying so.",
        "“But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,” she added, “that Lizzy shall\nbe brought to reason.  I will speak to her about it directly.\nShe is a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her\nown interest but I will make her know it.”",
        "“Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,” cried Mr. Collins;\n“but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether\nshe would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my\nsituation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage\nstate.  If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit,\nperhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me,\nbecause if liable to such defects of temper, she could not\ncontribute much to my felicity.”",
        "“Sir, you quite misunderstand me,” said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed.\n“Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these.  In everything\nelse she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived.  I will go\ndirectly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her,\nI am sure.”",
        "She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to\nher husband, called out as she entered the library, “Oh! Mr.\nBennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.\nYou must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows\nshe will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will\nchange his mind and not have her.”",
        "Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and\nfixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in\nthe least altered by her communication.",
        "“I have not the pleasure of understanding you,” said he, when\nshe had finished her speech.  “Of what are you talking?”",
        "“Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy.  Lizzy declares she will not have\nMr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not\nhave Lizzy.”",
        "“And what am I to do on the occasion?  It seems an hopeless\nbusiness.”",
        "“Speak to Lizzy about it yourself.  Tell her that you insist upon\nher marrying him.”",
        "“Let her be called down.  She shall hear my opinion.”",
        "Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to\nthe library.",
        "“Come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared.  “I have\nsent for you on an affair of importance.  I understand that Mr.\nCollins has made you an offer of marriage.  Is it true?”  Elizabeth\nreplied that it was.  “Very well–and this offer of marriage you\nhave refused?”",
        "“I have, sir.”",
        "“Very well.  We now come to the point.  Your mother insists\nupon your accepting it.  Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?”",
        "“Yes, or I will never see her again.”",
        "“An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth.  From this day\nyou must be a stranger to one of your parents.  Your mother will\nnever see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will\nnever see you again if you do.”",
        "Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a\nbeginning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her\nhusband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively\ndisappointed.",
        "“What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way?  You\npromised me to insist upon her marrying him.”",
        "“My dear,” replied her husband, “I have two small favours to\nrequest.  First, that you will allow me the free use of my\nunderstanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my\nroom.  I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as\nmay be.”",
        "Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband,\ndid Mrs. Bennet give up the point.  She talked to Elizabeth again\nand again; coaxed and threatened her by turns.  She endeavoured\nto secure Jane in her interest; but Jane, with all possible\nmildness, declined interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with\nreal earnestness, and sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to\nher attacks.  Though her manner varied, however, her determination\nnever did.",
        "Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had\npassed.  He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what\nmotives his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was\nhurt, he suffered in no other way.  His regard for her was quite\nimaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother’s\nreproach prevented his feeling any regret.",
        "While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to\nspend the day with them.  She was met in the vestibule by Lydia,\nwho, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, “I am glad you are\ncome, for there is such fun here!  What do you think has\nhappened this morning?  Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy,\nand she will not have him.”",
        "Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by\nKitty, who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they\nentered the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than\nshe likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her\ncompassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to\ncomply with the wishes of all her family.  “Pray do, my dear\nMiss Lucas,” she added in a melancholy tone, “for nobody is on\nmy side, nobody takes part with me.  I am cruelly used, nobody\nfeels for my poor nerves.”",
        "Charlotte’s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and\nElizabeth.",
        "“Aye, there she comes,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “looking as\nunconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we\nwere at York, provided she can have her own way.  But I tell\nyou, Miss Lizzy–if you take it into your head to go on refusing\nevery offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband\nat all–and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you\nwhen your father is dead.  I shall not be able to keep you–and\nso I warn you.  I have done with you from this very day.  I told\nyou in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you\nagain, and you will find me as good as my word.  I have no\npleasure in talking to undutiful children.  Not that I have much\npleasure, indeed, in talking to anybody.  People who suffer as\nI do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for\ntalking.  Nobody can tell what I suffer!  But it is always so.\nThose who do not complain are never pitied.”",
        "Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible\nthat any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only\nincrease the irritation.  She talked on, therefore, without\ninterruption from any of them, till they were joined by Mr.\nCollins, who entered the room with an air more stately than\nusual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls, “Now, I do\ninsist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and\nlet me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation together.”",
        "Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty\nfollowed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she\ncould; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins,\nwhose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute,\nand then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to\nthe window and pretending not to hear.  In a doleful voice Mrs.\nBennet began the projected conversation: “Oh! Mr. Collins!”",
        "“My dear madam,” replied he, “let us be for ever silent on this\npoint.  Far be it from me,” he presently continued, in a voice that\nmarked his displeasure, “to resent the behaviour of your daughter.\nResignation to inevitable evils is the evil duty of us all; the\npeculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I\nhave been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned.\nPerhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive\nhappiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I\nhave often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when\nthe blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our\nestimation.  You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any\ndisrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing\nmy pretensions to your daughter’s favour, without having paid\nyourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to\ninterpose your authority in my behalf.  My conduct may, I fear,\nbe objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your\ndaughter’s lips instead of your own.  But we are all liable to\nerror.  I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.  My\nobject has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with\ndue consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if\nmy manner has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to\napologise.”",
