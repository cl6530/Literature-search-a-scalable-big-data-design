Is any discontented with his parents? let him be a\nbad son, and lament. Is any discontented with his children? let\nhim be a bad father.—\"Throw him into prison!\"—What prison?—\nWhere he is already: for he is there against his will; and\nwherever a man is against his will, that to him is a prison.\nThus Socrates was not in prison, since he was there with his own\nconsent.",
