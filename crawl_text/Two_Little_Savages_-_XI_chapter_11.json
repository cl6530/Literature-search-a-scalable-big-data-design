        "Lung Balm",
        "One day as this girl went with him through a little grove on the edge\nof the town, she stopped at a certain tree and said:",
        "“If that ain’t Black-cherry!”",
        "“You mean Choke-cherry.”",
        "“No, Black-cherry. Choke-cherry ain’t no good; but Black-cherry bark’s\nawful good for lung complaint. Grandma always keeps it. I’ve been\nfeeling a bit queer meself” [she was really as strong as an ox].\n“Guess I’ll git some.” So she and Yan planned an expedition together.\nThe boldness of it scared the boy. The girl helped herself to a\nhatchet in the tool box–the sacred tool box of his father.",
        "Yan’s mother saw her with it and demanded why she had it. With ready\neffrontery she said it was to hammer in the hook that held the\nclothesline, and proceeded to carry out the lie with a smiling face.\nThat gave Yan a new lesson and not a good one. The hatchet was at once\nput back in the box, to be stolen more carefully later on.",
        "Biddy announced that she was going to the grocery shop. She met Yan\naround the corner and they made for the lot. Utterly regardless of\nproperty rights, she showed Yan how to chip off the bark of the\nBlack-cherry. “Don’t chip off all around; that’s bad luck–take it\non’y from the sunny side.” She filled a basket with the pieces and\nthey returned home.",
        "Here she filled a jar with bits of the inner layer, then, pouring\nwater over it, let it stand for a week. The water was then changed to\na dark brown stuff with a bitter taste and a sweet, aromatic smell.",
        "“It’s terrible good,” she said. “Granny always keeps it handy. It\ncures lots of people. Now there was Bud Ellis–the doctors just guv\nhim up. They said he didn’t have a single lung left, and he come\naround to Granny. He used to make fun of Granny; but now he wuz plumb\nscairt. At first Granny chased him away; then when she seen that he\nwas awful sick, she got sorry and told him how to make Lung Balm. He\nwas to make two gallons each time and bring it to her. Then she took\nand fixed it so it was one-half as much and give it back to him. Well,\nin six months if he wasn’t all right.”",
        "Biddy now complained nightly of “feelin’s” in her chest. These\nfeelings could be controlled only by a glass or two of Lung Balm.\nHer condition must have been critical, for one night after several\nnecessary doses of Balm her head seemed affected. She became\nabusive to the lady of the house and at the end of the month a less\ninteresting help was in her place.",
        "There were many lessons good and bad that Yan might have drawn from\nthis; but the only one that he took in was that the Black-cherry bark\nis a wonderful remedy. The family doctor said that it really was so,\nand Yan treasured up this as a new and precious fragment of woodcraft.",
        "Having once identified the tree, he was surprised to see that it was\nrather common, and was delighted to find it flourishing in his own\nGlenyan.",
        "This made him set down on paper all the trees he knew, and he was\nsurprised to find how few they were and how uncertain he was about\nthem.",
        "  Maple–hard and soft.\n  Beach.\n  Elm–swamp and slippery.\n  Ironwood.\n  Birch–white and black.\n  Ash–white and black.\n  Pine.\n  Cedar.\n  Balsam.\n  Hemlock and Cherry.",
        "He had heard that the Indians knew the name and properties of every\ntree and plant in the woods, and that was what he wished to be able to\nsay of himself.",
        "One day by the bank of the river he noticed a pile of empty shells of\nthe fresh-water Mussel, or Clam. The shells were common enough, but\nwhy all together and marked in the same way? Around the pile on the\nmud were curious tracks and marks. There were so many that it was hard\nto find a perfect one, but when he did, remembering the Coon track,\nhe drew a picture of it. It was too small to be the mark of his old\nacquaintance. He did not find any one to tell him what it was, but one\nday he saw a round, brown animal hunched up on the bank eating a clam.\nIt dived into the water at his approach, but it reappeared swimming\nfarther on. Then, when it dived again, Yan saw by its long thin\ntail that it was a Muskrat, like the stuffed one he had seen in the\ntaxidermist’s window.",
        "He soon learned that the more he studied those tracks the more\ndifferent kinds he found. Many were rather mysterious, so he could\nonly draw them and put them aside, hoping some day for light. One\nof the strangest and most puzzling turned out to be the trail of a\nSnapper, and another proved to be merely the track of a Common Crow\nthat came to the water’s edge to drink.",
        "The curios that he gathered and stored in his shanty increased in\nnumber and in interest. The place became more and more part of\nhimself. Its concealment bettered as the foliage grew around it again,\nand he gloried in its wild seclusion and mystery, and wandered through\nthe woods with his bow and arrows, aiming harmless, deadly blows at\nsnickering Red-squirrels–though doubtless he would have been as sorry\nas they had he really hit one.",
        "Yan soon found out that he was not the only resident of the shanty.\nOne day as he sat inside wondering why he had not made a fireplace, so\nthat he could sit at an indoor fire, he saw a silent little creature\nflit along between two logs in the back wall. He remained still. A\nbeautiful little Woodmouse, for such it was, soon came out in plain\nview and sat up to look at Yan and wash its face. Yan reached out for\nhis bow and arrow, but the Mouse was gone in a flash. He fitted a\nblunt arrow to the string, then waited, and when the Mouse returned he\nshot the arrow. It missed the Mouse, struck the log and bounded back\ninto Yan’s face, giving him a stinging blow on the cheek. And as Yan\nrolled around grunting and rubbing his cheek, he thought, “This is\nwhat I tried to do to the Woodmouse.” Thenceforth, Yan made no attempt\nto harm the Mouse; indeed, he was willing to share his meals with it.\nIn time they became well acquainted, and Yan found that not one, but a\nwhole family, were sharing with him his shanty in the woods.",
        "Biddy’s remark about the Indian tobacco bore fruit. Yan was not a\nsmoker, but now he felt he must learn. He gathered a lot of this\ntobacco, put it to dry, and set about making a pipe–a real Indian\npeace pipe. He had no red sandstone to make it of, but a soft red\nbrick did very well. He first roughed out the general shape with his\nknife, and was trying to bore the bowl out with the same tool, when\nhe remembered that in one of the school-readers was an account of the\nIndian method of drilling into stone with a bow-drill and wet sand.\nOne of his schoolmates, the son of a woodworker, had seen his father\nuse a bow-drill. This knowledge gave him new importance in Yan’s eyes.\nUnder his guidance a bow-drill was made, and used much and on many\nthings till it was understood, and now it did real Indian service by\ndrilling the bowl and stem holes of the pipe.",
        "He made a stem of an Elderberry shoot, punching out the pith at home\nwith a long knitting-needle. Some white pigeon wing feathers trimmed\nsmall, and each tipped with a bit of pitch, were strung on a stout\nthread and fastened to the stem for a finishing touch; and he would\nsit by his camp fire solemnly smoking–a few draws only, for he did\nnot like it–then say, “Ugh, heap hungry,” knock the ashes out, and\nproceed with whatever work he had on hand.",
        "Thus he spent the bright Saturdays, hiding his accouterments each\nday in his shanty, washing the paint from his face in the brook, and\nreplacing the hated paper collar that the pride and poverty of his\nfamily made a daily necessity, before returning home. He was a little\ndreamer, but oh! what happy dreams. Whatever childish sorrow he found\nat home he knew he could always come out here and forget and be happy\nas a king–be a real King in a Kingdom wholly after his heart, and all\nhis very own.",
