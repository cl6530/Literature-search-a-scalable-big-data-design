        "When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been\ncautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her\nsister just how very much she admired him.",
        "“He is just what a young man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,\ngood-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!–so\nmuch ease, with such perfect good breeding!”",
        "“He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man\nought likewise to be, if he possibly can.  His character is thereby\ncomplete.”",
        "“I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second\ntime.  I did not expect such a compliment.”",
        "“Did not you? I did for you.  But that is one great difference\nbetween us.  Compliments always take you by surprise, and\nme never.  What could be more natural than his asking you\nagain?  He could not help seeing that you were about five times\nas pretty as every other woman in the room.  No thanks to his\ngallantry for that.  Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I\ngive you leave to like him.  You have liked many a stupider\nperson.”",
        "“Dear Lizzy!”",
        "“Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in\ngeneral.  You never see a fault in anybody.  All the world are\ngood and agreeable in your eyes.  I never heard you speak ill of\na human being in your life.”",
        "“I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always\nspeak what I think.”",
        "“I know you do; and it is that which makes the wonder.  With yourgood sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense\nof others!  Affectation of candour is common enough–one meets\nwith it everywhere.  But to be candid without ostentation or\ndesign–to take the good of everybody’s character and make it\nstill better, and say nothing of the bad–belongs to you alone.\nAnd so you like this man’s sisters, too, do you?  Their manners\nare not equal to his.”",
        "“Certainly not–at first.  But they are very pleasing women when\nyou converse with them.  Miss Bingley is to live with her\nbrother, and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall\nnot find a very charming neighbour in her.”",
        "Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their\nbehaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in\ngeneral; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy\nof temper than her sister, and with a judgement too unassailed by\nany attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve\nthem.  They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good\nhumour when they were pleased, nor in the power of making\nthemselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and\nconceited.  They were rather handsome, had been educated in\none of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of\ntwenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more\nthan they ought, and of associating with people of rank, and\nwere therefore in every respect entitled to think well of\nthemselves, and meanly of others.  They were of a respectable\nfamily in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply\nimpressed on their memories than that their brother’s fortune\nand their own had been acquired by trade.",
        "Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a\nhundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to\npurchase an estate, but did not live to do it.  Mr. Bingley\nintended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county;\nbut as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of\na manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the\neasiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the\nremainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next\ngeneration to purchase.",
        "His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,\nthough he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley\nwas by no means unwilling to preside at his table–nor was Mrs.\nHurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less\ndisposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.\nMr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted\nby an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House.\nHe did look at it, and into it for half-an-hour–was pleased with\nthe situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the\nowner said in its praise, and took it immediately.",
        "Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in\nspite of great opposition of character.  Bingley was endeared to\nDarcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper,\nthough no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own,\nand though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied.  On the\nstrength of Darcy’s regard, Bingley had the firmest reliance, and\nof his judgement the highest opinion.  In understanding, Darcy\nwas the superior.  Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy\nwas clever.  He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and\nfastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting.\nIn that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.  Bingley was\nsure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually\ngiving offense.",
        "The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was\nsufficiently characteristic.  Bingley had never met with more\npleasant people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been\nmost kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no\nstiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and, as\nto Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.\nDarcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom\nthere was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had\nfelt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention\nor pleasure.  Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she\nsmiled too much.",
        "Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so–but still they\nadmired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet\ngirl, and one whom they would not object to know more of.\nMiss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their\nbrother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as\nhe chose.",
