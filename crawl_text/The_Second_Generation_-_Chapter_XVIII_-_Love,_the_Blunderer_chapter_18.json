        "As Dory had several months’ work before him at Paris, he and Del took a\nfurnished apartment in the Rue de Rivoli, high up, attractive within,\nbefore its balconied windows the stately trees, the fountains, the bright\nflower beds, the thronged playgrounds of the Tuileries. But they were not\nlong left to themselves; in their second week, the concierge’s little\ngirl late one afternoon brought Janet’s card up to Adelaide. As Janet\nentered, Del regretted having yielded to impulse and admitted her. For,\nthe granddaughter of “blue-jeans Jones,” the tavern keeper, was looking\nthe elegant and idle aristocrat from the tip of the tall, graceful plume\nin her most Parisian of hats to the buckles of shoes which matched her\ndress, parasol, and jewels. A lovely Janet, a marvelous Janet; a toilette\nit must have taken her two hours to make, and spiritual hazel eyes that\nforbade the idea of her giving so much as a moment’s thought to any\nmaterial thing, even to dress. Adelaide had spent with the dressmakers a\ngood part of the letter of credit her mother slipped into her traveling\nbag at the parting; she herself was in a negligee which had as much style\nas Janet’s costume and, in addition, individual taste, whereof Janet had\nbut little; and besides, while her beauty had the same American\ndelicateness, as of the finest, least florid Sèvres or Dresden, it also\nhad a look of durability which Janet’s beauty lacked–for Janet’s beauty\ndepended upon those fragilities, coloring and contour. Adelaide was not\nnotably vain, had a clear sense of her defects, tended to exaggerate\nthem, rather than her many and decisive good points. It was not Janet’s\nappearance that unsettled Del; she brought into the room the atmosphere\nDel had breathed during all those important years of girlhood, and had\nnot yet lost her fondness for. It depressed her at once about herself to\nnote how this vision of the life that had been but would never be again\naffected her.",
        "“You are sad, dear,” said Janet, as she kissed her on both cheeks with a\ndiffusing of perfume that gave her a sense of a bouquet of priceless\nexotics waving before her face.",
        "“You are sad, dear,” she repeated, with that air of tenderest sympathy\nwhich can be the safest cover for subtle malice.",
        "Adelaide shrank.",
        "“I’m so glad I’ve come when I may be able to do some good.”",
        "Adelaide winced.",
        "“How cozy these rooms are–”",
        "At “cozy” Adelaide shuddered. No one ever used, except apologetically,\nthat word, which is the desperate last resort of compliment.",
        "“And what a beautiful view from the windows–so much better than ours at\nthe pompous old Bristol, looking out on that bare square!”",
        "Adelaide laughed. Not by chance, she knew, did Miss Janet, with her\nsoftly sheathed but swift and sharp cat claws, drag in the delicate hint\nthat while Adelaide was “cozy” in an unaristocratic maison meublée, she\nherself was ensconced in the haunts of royalty; and it suddenly came back\nto Del how essentially cheap was “aristocracy.”",
        "“But I mustn’t look at those adorable gardens,” continued Janet. “They\nfill me with longing for the country, for the pure, simple things. I am\nso sick of the life mamma and I lead. And you are married to dear\nDory–how romantic! And I hear that Arthur is to marry Margaret\nSchultz–or whatever her name was–that splendid creature! She was a\ndear friend of the trained nurse I had last spring, and what the nurse\ntold me about her made me positively love her. Such character! And\ngetting ready to lead such a useful life.” This without the least\nsuggestion of struggle with a difficult subject. “Arthur is a noble\nfellow, too. If we had been in spiritual accord, I’d have loved to go and\nlead his life with him.”",
        "Adelaide was in high good humor now–Janet was too preposterous to be\ntaken seriously. “What do you want me to do for you, Jen?” said she.",
        "“Why, nothing!” exclaimed Janet, looking a little wonder and much\nreproach.",
        "Del laughed. “Now, really, Jen,” said she. “You know you never in the\nworld went to all the trouble of getting my address, and then left\nroyalty at the Bristol for a maison meublée, four flights up and no\nelevator, just to see me!”",
        "“I had thought of something I was sure would give you pleasure,” said\nJanet, injured.",
        "“What do you want me to do for you?” repeated Adelaide, with smiling\npersistence.",
        "“Mamma and I have an invitation to spend a week at Besançon–you know,\nit’s the splendid old chateau Louis Treize used to love to visit. It’s\nstill the seat of the Saint Berthè family, and the present Marquis, a\ndear friend of ours, is such a wonderful, fine old nobleman–so simple\nand gracious and full of epigrams. He really ought to wear lace and\nruffles and a beautiful peruke. At any rate, as I was saying, he has\nasked us down. But mamma has to go to England to see papa before he\nsails, and I thought you’d love to visit the chateau–you and Dory. It’s\nso poetic–and historic, too.”",
        "“Your mother is going away and you’ll be unable to make this visit unless\nyou get a chaperon, and you want me to chaperon you,” said Adelaide, who\nwas not minded to be put in the attitude of being the recipient of a\nfavor from this particular young woman at this particular time, when in\ntruth she was being asked to confer a favor. “Adversity” had already\nsharpened her wits to the extent of making her alert to the selfishness\ndisguised as generosity which the prosperous love to shower upon their\nlittle brothers and sisters of the poor. She knew at once that Janet must\nhave been desperately off for a chaperon to come to her.",
        "A look of irritation marred Janet’s spiritual countenance for an\ninstant. But she never permitted anything whatsoever to stand between her\nand what she wished. She masked herself and said sweetly: “Won’t you go,\ndear? I know you’ll enjoy it–you and Dory. And it would be a great favor\nto me. I don’t see how I can go unless you consent. You know, I mayn’t go\nwith just anyone.”",
        "Adelaide’s first impulse was to refuse; but she did not. She put off\ndecision by saying, “I’ll ask Dory to-night, and let you know in the\nmorning. Will that do?”",
        "“Perfectly,” said Janet, rising to go. “I’ll count on you, for I know\nDory will want to see the chateau and get a glimpse of life in the old\naristocracy. It will be so educational.”",
        "Dory felt the change in Del the instant he entered their little\nsalon–felt that during the day some new element had intruded into\ntheir friendly life together, to interrupt, to unsettle, and to cloud the\nbrightening vistas ahead. At the mention of Janet he began to understand.\nHe saw it all when she said with a show of indifference that deceived\nonly herself, “Wouldn’t you like to go down to Besançon?”",
        "“Not I,” replied he coldly. “Europe is full of that kind of places. You\ncan’t glance outdoors without seeing a house or a ruin where the sweat\nand blood of peasants were squandered.”",
        "“Janet thought you’d be interested in it as history,” persisted Adelaide,\nbeginning to feel irritated.",
        "“That’s amusing,” said Dory. “You might have told her that scandal isn’t\nhistory, that history never was made in such places. As for the people\nwho live there now, they’re certainly not worth while–the same\npretentious ignoramuses that used to live there, except they no longer\nhave fangs.”",
        "“You ought not to be so prejudiced,” said Adelaide, who in those days\noften found common sense irritating. She had the all but universal habit\nof setting down to “prejudice” such views as are out of accord with the\nset of views held by one’s business or professional or social associates.",
        "Her irritation confirmed Dory’s suspicions. “I spoke only for myself,\"\nsaid he. “Of course, you’ll accept Janet’s invitation. She included me\nonly as a matter of form.”",
        "“I couldn’t, without you.”",
        "“Why not?”",
        "“Well–wouldn’t, then.”",
        "“But I urge you to go–want you to go! I can’t possibly leave Paris, not\nfor a day–at present.”",
        "“I shan’t go without you,” said Adelaide, trying hard to make her tone\nfirm and final.",
        "Dory leaned across the table toward her–they were in the garden of a\ncafe in the Latin Quarter. “If you don’t go, Del,” said he, “you’ll make\nme feel that I am restraining you in a way far meaner than a direct\nrequest not to go. You want to go. I want you to go. There is no reason\nwhy you shouldn’t.”",
        "Adelaide smiled shamefacedly. “You honestly want to get rid of me?”",
        "“Honestly. I’d feel like a jailer, if you didn’t go.”",
        "“What’ll you do in the evenings?”",
        "“Work later, dine later, go to bed and get up earlier.”",
        "“Work–always work,” she said. She sighed, not wholly insincerely. “I\nwish I weren’t so idle and aimless. If I were the woman I ought to be–”",
        "“None of that–none of that!” he cried, in mock sternness.",
        "“I ought to be interested in your work.”",
        "“Why, I thought you were!” he exclaimed, in smiling astonishment.",
        "“Oh, of course, in a way–in an ’entertainment’ sort of way. I like to\nhear you talk about it–who wouldn’t? But I don’t give the kind of\ninterest I should–the interest that thinks and suggests and stimulates.”",
        "“Don’t be too sure of that,” said Dory. “The ’helpful’ sort of people are\nusually a nuisance.”",
        "But she knew the truth, though passion might still be veiling it from\nhim. Life, before her father’s will forced an abrupt change, had been to\nher a showman, submitting his exhibits for her gracious approval,\nshifting them as soon as she looked as if she were about to be bored; and\nthe change had come before she had lived long enough to exhaust and weary\nof the few things he has for the well-paying passive spectator, but not\nbefore she had formed the habit of making only the passive spectator’s\nslight mental exertion.",
        "“Dory is so generous,” she thought, with the not acutely painful kind of\nremorse we lay upon the penitential altar for our own shortcomings, “that\nhe doesn’t realize how I’m shirking and letting him do all the pulling.\"\nAnd to him she said, “If you could have seen into my mind while Janet was\nhere, you’d give me up as hopeless.”",
        "Dory laughed. “I had a glimpse of it just now–when you didn’t like it\nbecause I couldn’t see my way clear to taking certain people so seriously\nas you think they deserve.”",
        "“But you are prejudiced on that subject,” she maintained.",
        "“And ever shall be,” admitted he, so good-humoredly that she could not\nbut respond. “It’s impossible for me to forget that every luxurious idler\nmeans scores who have to work long hours for almost nothing in order that\nhe may be of no use to the world or to himself.”",
        "“You’d have the whole race on a dead level,” said Adelaide.",
        "“Of material prosperity–yes,” replied Dory. “A high dead level. I’d\nabolish the coarse, brutal contrasts between waste and want. Then there’d\nbe a chance for the really interesting contrasts–the infinite varieties\nof thought and taste and character and individuality.”",
        "“I see,” said Adelaide, as if struck by a new idea. “You’d have the\ncontrasts, differences among flowers, not merely between flower and weed.\nYou’d abolish the weeds.”",
        "“Root and stalk,” answered Dory, admiring her way of putting it. “My\nobjection to these aristocratic ideals is that they are so vulgar–and so\ndishonest. Is that prejudice?”",
        "“No–oh, no!” replied Del sincerely. “Now, it seems to me, I don’t care\nto go with Janet.”",
        "“Not to oblige me–very particularly? I want you to go. I want you to\nsee for yourself, Del.”",
        "She laughed. “Then I’ll go–but only because you ask it.”",
        "That was indeed an elegant company at Besançon–elegant in dress, elegant\nin graceful carelessness of manners, elegant in graceful sinuosities of\ncleverly turned phrases. But after the passing of the first and second\ndays’ sensations, Hiram and Ellen Ranger’s daughter began to have\nsomewhat the same feeling she remembered having as a little girl, when\nshe went to both the afternoon and the evening performances of the\ncircus. These people, going through always the same tricks in the same\nold narrow ring of class ideas, lost much of their charm after a few\nrepetitions of their undoubtedly clever and attractive performance; she\neven began to see how they would become drearily monotonous. “No wonder\nthey look bored,” she thought. “They are.” What enormous importance they\nattached to trifles! What ludicrous tenacity in exploded delusions! And\nwhat self-complacent claiming of remote, powerful ancestors who had\nfounded their families, when those ancestors would have disclaimed them\nas puny nonentities. Their ideas were wholly provided for them, precisely\nas were their clothes and every artistic thing that gave them\n“background.” They would have made as absurd a failure of trying to\nevolve the one as the other. Yet they posed–and were widely accepted–as\nthe superiors of those who made their clothes and furniture and of those\nwho made their ideas. And she had thought Dory partly insincere, partly\nprejudiced when he had laughed at them. Why, he had only shown the\nplainest kind of American good sense. As for snobbishness, was not the\nsilly-child American brand of it less ridiculous than this unblushing and\nunconcealed self-reverence, without any physical, mental or material\njustification whatsoever? They hadn’t good manners even, because–as Dory\nhad once said–no one could have really good manners who believed, and\nacted upon the belief, that he was the superior of most of the members of\nhis own family–the human race.",
        "“I suppose I could compress myself back into being satisfied with this\nsort of people and things,” she thought, as she looked round the ballroom\nfrom which pose and self-consciousness and rigid conventionality had\nbanished spontaneous gayety. “I suppose I could even again come to\nfancying this the only life. But I certainly don’t care for it now.”",
        "But, although Adelaide was thus using her eyes and her mind–her own eyes\nand her own mind–in observing what was going on around her, she did not\ndisconcert the others, not even Janet, by expressing her thoughts. Common\nsense–absolute common sense–always sounds incongruous in a conventional\natmosphere. In its milder forms it produces the effect of wit; in\nstronger doses it is a violent irritant; in large quantity, it causes\nthose to whom it is administered to regard the person administering it as\ninsane. Perhaps Adelaide might have talked more or less frankly to Janet\nhad Janet not been so obviously in the highest of her own kind of\nheavens. She was raised to this pinnacle by the devoted attentions of the\nViscount Brunais, eldest son of Saint Berthè and the most agreeable and\nadaptable of men, if the smallest and homeliest. Adelaide spoke of his\nintelligence to Janet, when they were alone before dinner on the fourth\nday, and Janet at once responded.",
        "“And such a soul!” she exclaimed. “He inherits all the splendid, noble\ntraditions of their old, old family. You see in his face that he is\ndescended from generations of refinement and–and–freedom from contact\nwith vulgarizing work, don’t you?”",
        "“That hadn’t struck me,” said Adelaide amiably. “But he’s a well-meaning,\ngood-hearted little man, and, of course, he feels as at home in the\nsurroundings he’s had all his life as a bird on a bough. Who doesn’t?”",
        "“But when you know him better, when you know him as I know him–” Janet’s\nexpression disclosed the secret.",
        "“But won’t you be lonely–away off here–among–foreign people?\"\nsaid Adelaide.",
        "“Oh, I should love it here!” exclaimed Janet. “It seems to me I–he\nand I–must have lived in this very chateau in a former existence. We\nhave talked about it, and he agrees with me. We are so harmonious.”",
        "“You’ve really made up your mind to–to marry him?” Adelaide had almost\nsaid “to buy him\"; she had a sense that it was her duty to disregard\nJanet’s pretenses, and “buy” was so exactly the word to use with these\npeople to whom money was the paramount consideration, the thought behind\nevery other thought, the feeling behind every other feeling, the\nmainspring of their lives, the mainstay of all the fictions of their\naristocracy.",
        "“That depends on father,” replied Janet. “Mother has gone to talk to him\nabout it.”",
        "“I’m sure your father won’t stand between you and happiness,” said\nAdelaide.",
        "“But he doesn’t understand these aristocratic people,” replied she. “Of\ncourse, if it depended upon Aristide and me, we should be married without\nconsulting anybody. But he can’t legally marry without his father’s\nconsent, and his father naturally wants proper settlements. It’s a cruel\nlaw, don’t you think?”",
        "Adelaide thought not; she thought it, on the contrary, an admirable\ndevice to “save the face” of a mercenary lover posing as a sentimentalist\nand money-spurner. But she merely said, “I think it’s most\ncharacteristic, most aristocratic.” She knew Janet, how shrewd she was,\nhow thoroughly she understood the “coarse side of life.” She added, “And\nyour father’ll come round.”",
        "“I wish I could believe it,” sighed Janet. “The Saint Berthès have an\nexaggerated notion of papa’s wealth. Besides, they need a good deal. They\nwere robbed horribly by those dreadful revolutionists. They used to own\nall this part of the country. All these people round here with their\nlittle farms were once the peasants of Aristide’s ancestors. Now–even\nthis chateau has a mortgage on it. I couldn’t keep back the tears, while\nAristide was telling me.”",
        "Adelaide thought of Charles Whitney listening to that same recital, and\nalmost laughed. “Well, I feel sure it will turn out all right,” she said.\n“Your mother’ll see to that. And I believe you’ll be very, very happy.\"\nTheatricals in private life was Janet’s passion–why should she not be\nhappy? Frenchmen were famous for their politeness and consideration to\ntheir wives; Aristide would never let her see or feel that she bored him,\nthat her reverence for the things he was too intelligent and modern not\nto despise appealed to him only through his sense of humor. Janet would\npush her shrewd, soulful way into social leadership, would bring her\nchildren up to be more aristocratic than the children of the oldest\naristocrats.",
        "Adelaide smiled as she pictured it all–smiled, yet sighed. She was not\nunder Janet’s fixed and unshakable delusions. She saw that high-sounding\ntitles were no more part of the personalities bearing them than the mass\nof frankly false hair so grandly worn by Aristide’s grand-aunt was part\nof the wisp-like remnant of natural head covering. But that other self of\nhers, so reluctant to be laughed or frowned down and out by the self that\nwas Hiram Ranger’s daughter, still forced her to share in the ancient,\nignorant allegiance to “appearances.” She did not appreciate how bored\nshe was, how impatient to be back with Dory, the never monotonous, the\nalways interesting, until she discovered that Janet, with her usual\nsubtlety, had arranged for them to stay another week, had made it\nimpossible for her to refuse without seeming to be disobliging and even\ndownright rude. They were to have returned to Paris on a Monday. On\nSunday she wrote Dory to telegraph for her on Tuesday.",
        "“I’d hate to be looking forward to that life of dull foolery,” thought\nshe, as the mossy bastions of Besançon drifted from her horizon–she was\njourneying up alone, Janet staying on with one of the Saint Berthè women\nas chaperone. “It is foolery and it is dull. I don’t see how grown-up\npeople endure it, unless they’ve never known any better. Yet I seem\nunable to content myself with the life father stands for–and Dory.” She\nappreciated the meaning of the legend of the creature with the two\nbodies and the two wills, each always opposed to the other, with the\nresult that all motion was in a dazing circle in which neither wished to\ngo. “Still,” she concluded, “I am learning\"–which was the truth;\nindeed, she was learning with astonishing rapidity for a girl who had had\nsuch an insidiously wrong start and was getting but slight encouragement.",
        "Dory, of course, was helping her, but not as he might. Instead of\nbringing to bear that most powerful of influences, the influence of\npassionate love, he held to his stupid compact with his supersensitive\nself–the compact that he would never intrude his longings upon her. He\nconstantly reminded himself how often woman gives through a sense of duty\nor through fear of alienating or wounding one she respects and likes;\nand, so he saw in each impulse to enter Eden boldly a temptation to him\nto trespass, a temptation to her to mask her real feelings and suffer it.\nThe mystery in which respectable womanhood is kept veiled from the male,\nhas bred in him an awe of the female that she does not fully realize or\naltogether approve–though she is not slow to advantage herself of it. In\nthe smaller cities and towns of the West, this awe of respectable\nwomanhood exists in a degree difficult for the sophisticated to believe\npossible, unless they have had experience of it. Dory had never had that\nfamiliarity with women which breeds knowledge of their absolute and\nunmysterious humanness. Thus, not only did he not have the key which\nenables its possessor to unlock them; he did not even know how to use it\nwhen Del offered it to him, all but thrust it into his hand. Poor Dory,\nindeed–but let only those who have not loved too well to love wisely\nstrut at his expense by pitying him; for, in matters of the heart,\nsophisticated and unsophisticated act much alike. “Men would dare much\nmore, if they knew what women think,” says George Sand. It is also true\nthat the men who dare most, who win most, are those who do not stop to\nbother about what the women think. Thought does not yet govern the world,\nbut appetite and action–bold appetite and the courage of it.",
