        "\n\n",
        "I have been asked to speak on the question how to make the best of\nlife, but may as well confess at once that I know nothing about it.\nI cannot think that I have made the best of my own life, nor is it\nlikely that I shall make much better of what may or may not remain\nto me.  I do not even know how to make the best of the twenty\nminutes that your committee has placed at my disposal, and as for\nlife as a whole, who ever yet made the best of such a colossal\nopportunity by conscious effort and deliberation?  In little things\nno doubt deliberate and conscious effort will help us, but we are\nspeaking of large issues, and such kingdoms of heaven as the making\nthe best of these come not by observation.",
        "The question, therefore, on which I have undertaken to address you\nis, as you must all know, fatuous, if it be faced seriously.  Life\nis like playing a violin solo in public and learning the instrument\nas one goes on.  One cannot make the best of such impossibilities,\nand the question is doubly fatuous until we are told which of our\ntwo lives—the conscious or the unconscious—is held by the asker to\nbe the truer life.  Which does the question contemplate—the life we\nknow, or the life which others may know, but which we know not?",
        "Death gives a life to some men and women compared with which their\nso-called existence here is as nothing.  Which is the truer life of\nShakespeare, Handel, that divine woman who wrote the “Odyssey,” and\nof Jane Austen—the life which palpitated with sensible warm motion\nwithin their own bodies, or that in virtue of which they are still\npalpitating in ours?  In whose consciousness does their truest life\nconsist—their own, or ours?  Can Shakespeare be said to have begun\nhis true life till a hundred years or so after he was dead and\nburied?  His physical life was but as an embryonic stage, a coming\nup out of darkness, a twilight and dawn before the sunrise of that\nlife of the world to come which he was to enjoy hereafter.  We all\nlive for a while after we are gone hence, but we are for the most\npart stillborn, or at any rate die in infancy, as regards that life\nwhich every age and country has recognised as higher and truer than\nthe one of which we are now sentient.  As the life of the race is\nlarger, longer, and in all respects more to be considered than that\nof the individual, so is the life we live in others larger and more\nimportant than the one we live in ourselves.  This appears nowhere\nperhaps more plainly than in the case of great teachers, who often\nin the lives of their pupils produce an effect that reaches far\nbeyond anything produced while their single lives were yet\nunsupplemented by those other lives into which they infused their\nown.",
        "Death to such people is the ending of a short life, but it does not\ntouch the life they are already living in those whom they have\ntaught; and happily, as none can know when he shall die, so none can\nmake sure that he too shall not live long beyond the grave; for the\nlife after death is like money before it—no one can be sure that it\nmay not fall to him or her even at the eleventh hour.  Money and\nimmortality come in such odd unaccountable ways that no one is cut\noff from hope.  We may not have made either of them for ourselves,\nbut yet another may give them to us in virtue of his or her love,\nwhich shall illumine us for ever, and establish us in some heavenly\nmansion whereof we neither dreamed nor shall ever dream.  Look at\nthe Doge Loredano Loredani, the old man’s smile upon whose face has\nbeen reproduced so faithfully in so many lands that it can never\nhenceforth be forgotten—would he have had one hundredth part of the\nlife he now lives had he not been linked awhile with one of those\nheaven-sent men who know che cosa e amor?  Look at Rembrandt’s old\nwoman in our National Gallery; had she died before she was eighty-\nthree years old she would not have been living now.  Then, when she\nwas eighty-three, immortality perched upon her as a bird on a\nwithered bough.",
        "I seem to hear some one say that this is a mockery, a piece of\nspecial pleading, a giving of stones to those that ask for bread.\nLife is not life unless we can feel it, and a life limited to a\nknowledge of such fraction of our work as may happen to survive us\nis no true life in other people; salve it as we may, death is not\nlife any more than black is white.",
        "The objection is not so true as it sounds.  I do not deny that we\nhad rather not die, nor do I pretend that much even in the case of\nthe most favoured few can survive them beyond the grave.  It is only\nbecause this is so that our own life is possible; others have made\nroom for us, and we should make room for others in our turn without\nundue repining.  What I maintain is that a not inconsiderable number\nof people do actually attain to a life beyond the grave which we can\nall feel forcibly enough, whether they can do so or not—that this\nlife tends with increasing civilisation to become more and more\npotent, and that it is better worth considering, in spite of its\nbeing unfelt by ourselves, than any which we have felt or can ever\nfeel in our own persons.",
        "Take an extreme case.  A group of people are photographed by\nEdison’s new process—say Titiens, Trebelli, and Jenny Lind, with\nany two of the finest men singers the age has known—let them be\nphotographed incessantly for half an hour while they perform a scene\nin “Lohengrin\"; let all be done stereoscopically.  Let them be\nphonographed at the same time so that their minutest shades of\nintonation are preserved, let the slides be coloured by a competent\nartist, and then let the scene be called suddenly into sight and\nsound, say a hundred years hence.  Are those people dead or alive?\nDead to themselves they are, but while they live so powerfully and\nso livingly in us, which is the greater paradox—to say that they\nare alive or that they are dead?  To myself it seems that their life\nin others would be more truly life than their death to themselves is\ndeath.  Granted that they do not present all the phenomena of life—\nwho ever does so even when he is held to be alive?  We are held to\nbe alive because we present a sufficient number of living phenomena\nto let the others go without saying; those who see us take the part\nfor the whole here as in everything else, and surely, in the case\nsupposed above, the phenomena of life predominate so powerfully over\nthose of death, that the people themselves must be held to be more\nalive than dead.  Our living personality is, as the word implies,\nonly our mask, and those who still own such a mask as I have\nsupposed have a living personality.  Granted again that the case\njust put is an extreme one; still many a man and many a woman has so\nstamped him or herself on his work that, though we would gladly have\nthe aid of such accessories as we doubtless presently shall have to\nthe livingness of our great dead, we can see them very sufficiently\nthrough the master pieces they have left us.",
        "As for their own unconsciousness I do not deny it.  The life of the\nembryo was unconscious before birth, and so is the life—I am\nspeaking only of the life revealed to us by natural religion—after\ndeath.  But as the embryonic and infant life of which we were\nunconscious was the most potent factor in our after life of\nconsciousness, so the effect which we may unconsciously produce in\nothers after death, and it may be even before it on those who have\nnever seen us, is in all sober seriousness our truer and more\nabiding life, and the one which those who would make the best of\ntheir sojourn here will take most into their consideration.",
        "Unconsciousness is no bar to livingness.  Our conscious actions are\na drop in the sea as compared with our unconscious ones.  Could we\nknow all the life that is in us by way of circulation, nutrition,\nbreathing, waste and repair, we should learn what an infinitesimally\nsmall part consciousness plays in our present existence; yet our\nunconscious life is as truly life as our conscious life, and though\nit is unconscious to itself it emerges into an indirect and\nvicarious consciousness in our other and conscious self, which\nexists but in virtue of our unconscious self.  So we have also a\nvicarious consciousness in others.  The unconscious life of those\nthat have gone before us has in great part moulded us into such men\nand women as we are, and our own unconscious lives will in like\nmanner have a vicarious consciousness in others, though we be dead\nenough to it in ourselves.",
        "If it is again urged that it matters not to us how much we may be\nalive in others, if we are to know nothing about it, I reply that\nthe common instinct of all who are worth considering gives the lie\nto such cynicism.  I see here present some who have achieved, and\nothers who no doubt will achieve, success in literature.  Will one\nof them hesitate to admit that it is a lively pleasure to her to\nfeel that on the other side of the world some one may be smiling\nhappily over her work, and that she is thus living in that person\nthough she knows nothing about it?  Here it seems to me that true\nfaith comes in.  Faith does not consist, as the Sunday School pupil\nsaid, “in the power of believing that which we know to be untrue.\"\nIt consists in holding fast that which the healthiest and most\nkindly instincts of the best and most sensible men and women are\nintuitively possessed of, without caring to require much evidence\nfurther than the fact that such people are so convinced; and for my\nown part I find the best men and women I know unanimous in feeling\nthat life in others, even though we know nothing about it, is\nnevertheless a thing to be desired and gratefully accepted if we can\nget it either before death or after.  I observe also that a large\nnumber of men and women do actually attain to such life, and in some\ncases continue so to live, if not for ever, yet to what is\npractically much the same thing.  Our life then in this world is, to\nnatural religion as much as to revealed, a period of probation.  The\nuse we make of it is to settle how far we are to enter into another,\nand whether that other is to be a heaven of just affection or a hell\nof righteous condemnation.",
        "Who, then, are the most likely so to run that they may obtain this\nveritable prize of our high calling?  Setting aside such lucky\nnumbers drawn as it were in the lottery of immortality, which I have\nreferred to casually above, and setting aside also the chances and\nchanges from which even immortality is not exempt, who on the whole\nare most likely to live anew in the affectionate thoughts of those\nwho never so much as saw them in the flesh, and know not even their\nnames?  There is a nisus, a straining in the dull dumb economy of\nthings, in virtue of which some, whether they will it and know it or\nno, are more likely to live after death than others, and who are\nthese?  Those who aimed at it as by some great thing that they would\ndo to make them famous?  Those who have lived most in themselves and\nfor themselves, or those who have been most ensouled consciously,\nbut perhaps better unconsciously, directly but more often\nindirectly, by the most living souls past and present that have\nflitted near them?  Can we think of a man or woman who grips us\nfirmly, at the thought of whom we kindle when we are alone in our\nhonest daw’s plumes, with none to admire or shrug his shoulders, can\nwe think of one such, the secret of whose power does not lie in the\ncharm of his or her personality—that is to say, in the wideness of\nhis or her sympathy with, and therefore life in and communion with\nother people?  In the wreckage that comes ashore from the sea of\ntime there is much tinsel stuff that we must preserve and study if\nwe would know our own times and people; granted that many a dead\ncharlatan lives long and enters largely and necessarily into our own\nlives; we use them and throw them away when we have done with them.\nI do not speak of these, I do not speak of the Virgils and Alexander\nPopes, and who can say how many more whose names I dare not mention\nfor fear of offending.  They are as stuffed birds or beasts in a\nMuseum, serviceable no doubt from a scientific standpoint, but with\nno vivid or vivifying hold upon us.  They seem to be alive, but are\nnot.  I am speaking of those who do actually live in us, and move us\nto higher achievements though they be long dead, whose life thrusts\nout our own and overrides it.  I speak of those who draw us ever\nmore towards them from youth to age, and to think of whom is to feel\nat once that we are in the hands of those we love, and whom we would\nmost wish to resemble.  What is the secret of the hold that these\npeople have upon us?  Is it not that while, conventionally speaking,\nalive, they most merged their lives in, and were in fullest\ncommunion with those among whom they lived?  They found their lives\nin losing them.  We never love the memory of any one unless we feel\nthat he or she was himself or herself a lover.",
        "I have seen it urged, again, in querulous accents, that the so-\ncalled immortality even of the most immortal is not for ever.  I see\na passage to this effect in a book that is making a stir as I write.\nI will quote it.  The writer says:-",
        "“So, it seems to me, is the immortality we so glibly predicate of\ndeparted artists.  If they survive at all, it is but a shadowy life\nthey live, moving on through the gradations of slow decay to distant\nbut inevitable death.  They can no longer, as heretofore, speak\ndirectly to the hearts of their fellow-men, evoking their tears or\nlaughter, and all the pleasures, be they sad or merry, of which\nimagination holds the secret.  Driven from the marketplace they\nbecome first the companions of the student, then the victims of the\nspecialist.  He who would still hold familiar intercourse with them\nmust train himself to penetrate the veil which in ever-thickening\nfolds conceals them from the ordinary gaze; he must catch the tone\nof a vanished society, he must move in a circle of alien\nassociations, he must think in a language not his own.” {5}",
        "This is crying for the moon, or rather pretending to cry for it, for\nthe writer is obviously insincere.  I see the Saturday Review says\nthe passage I have just quoted “reaches almost to poetry,” and\nindeed I find many blank verses in it, some of them very aggressive.\nNo prose is free from an occasional blank verse, and a good writer\nwill not go hunting over his work to rout them out, but nine or ten\nin little more than as many lines is indeed reaching too near to\npoetry for good prose.  This, however, is a trifle, and might pass\nif the tone of the writer was not so obviously that of cheap\npessimism.  I know not which is cheapest, pessimism or optimism.\nOne forces lights, the other darks; both are equally untrue to good\nart, and equally sure of their effect with the groundlings.  The one\nextenuates, the other sets down in malice.  The first is the more\namiable lie, but both are lies, and are known to be so by those who\nutter them.  Talk about catching the tone of a vanished society to\nunderstand Rembrandt or Giovanni Bellini!  It’s nonsense—the folds\ndo not thicken in front of these men; we understand them as well as\nthose among whom they went about in the flesh, and perhaps better.\nHomer and Shakespeare speak to us probably far more effectually than\nthey did to the men of their own time, and most likely we have them\nat their best.  I cannot think that Shakespeare talked better than\nwe hear him now in “Hamlet” or “Henry the Fourth\"; like enough he\nwould have been found a very disappointing person in a drawing-room.\nPeople stamp themselves on their work; if they have not done so they\nare naught; if they have we have them; and for the most part they\nstamp themselves deeper in their work than on their talk.  No doubt\nShakespeare and Handel will be one day clean forgotten, as though\nthey had never been born.  The world will in the end die; mortality\ntherefore itself is not immortal, and when death dies the life of\nthese men will die with it—but not sooner.  It is enough that they\nshould live within us and move us for many ages as they have and\nwill.  Such immortality, therefore, as some men and women are born\nto, achieve, or have thrust upon them, is a practical if not a\ntechnical immortality, and he who would have more let him have\nnothing.",
        "I see I have drifted into speaking rather of how to make the best of\ndeath than of life, but who can speak of life without his thoughts\nturning instantly to that which is beyond it?  He or she who has\nmade the best of the life after death has made the best of the life\nbefore it; who cares one straw for any such chances and changes as\nwill commonly befall him here if he is upheld by the full and\ncertain hope of everlasting life in the affections of those that\nshall come after?  If the life after death is happy in the hearts of\nothers, it matters little how unhappy was the life before it.",
        "And now I leave my subject, not without misgiving that I shall have\ndisappointed you.  But for the great attention which is being paid\nto the work from which I have quoted above, I should not have\nthought it well to insist on points with which you are, I doubt not,\nas fully impressed as I am:  but that book weakens the sanctions of\nnatural religion, and minimises the comfort which it affords us,\nwhile it does more to undermine than to support the foundations of\nwhat is commonly called belief.  Therefore I was glad to embrace\nthis opportunity of protesting.  Otherwise I should not have been so\nserious on a matter that transcends all seriousness.  Lord\nBeaconsfield cut it shorter with more effect.  When asked to give a\nrule of life for the son of a friend he said, “Do not let him try\nand find out who wrote the letters of Junius.”  Pressed for further\ncounsel he added, “Nor yet who was the man in the iron mask\"—and he\nwould say no more.  Don’t bore people.  And yet I am by no means\nsure that a good many people do not think themselves ill-used unless\nhe who addresses them has thoroughly well bored them—especially if\nthey have paid any money for hearing him.  My great namesake said,\n“Surely the pleasure is as great of being cheated as to cheat,” and\ngreat as the pleasure both of cheating and boring undoubtedly is, I\nbelieve he was right.  So I remember a poem which came out some\nthirty years ago in Punch, about a young lady who went forth in\nquest to “Some burden make or burden bear, but which she did not\ngreatly care, oh Miserie.”  So, again, all the holy men and women\nwho in the Middle Ages professed to have discovered how to make the\nbest of life took care that being bored, if not cheated, should have\na large place in their programme.  Still there are limits, and I\nclose not without fear that I may have exceeded them.",
