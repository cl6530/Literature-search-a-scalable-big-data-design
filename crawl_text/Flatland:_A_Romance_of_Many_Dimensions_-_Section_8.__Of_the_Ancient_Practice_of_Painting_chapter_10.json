        "\nIf my Readers have followed me with any attention up to this point,\nthey will not be surprised to hear that life is somewhat dull\nin Flatland.  I do not, of course, mean that there are not battles,\nconspiracies, tumults, factions, and all those other phenomena which\nare supposed to make History interesting; nor would I deny\nthat the strange mixture of the problems of life and the problems\nof Mathematics, continually inducing conjecture and giving\nthe opportunity of immediate verification, imparts to our existence\na zest which you in Spaceland can hardly comprehend.  I speak now\nfrom the aesthetic and artistic point of view when I say that life\nwith us is dull; aesthetically and artistically, very dull indeed.",
        "How can it be otherwise, when all one’s prospect, all one’s\nlandscapes, historical pieces, portraits, flowers, still life,\nare nothing but a single line, with no varieties except degrees of\nbrightness and obscurity?",
        "It was not always thus.  Colour, if Tradition speaks the truth,\nonce for the space of half a dozen centuries or more,\nthrew a transient splendour over the lives of our ancestors\nin the remotest ages.  Some private individual — a Pentagon\nwhose name is variously reported — having casually discovered\nthe constituents of the simpler colours and a rudimentary method\nof painting, is said to have begun decorating first his house,\nthen his slaves, then his Father, his Sons, and Grandsons,\nlastly himself.  The convenience as well as the beauty of the results\ncommended themselves to all.  Wherever Chromatistes, —\nfor by that name the most trustworthy authorities concur\nin calling him, — turned his variegated frame, there he at once\nexcited attention, and attracted respect.  No one now needed\nto “feel” him; no one mistook his front for his back;\nall his movements were readily ascertained by his neighbours\nwithout the slightest strain on their powers of calculation;\nno one jostled him, or failed to make way for him; his voice was saved\nthe labour of that exhausting utterance by which we colourless Squares\nand Pentagons are often forced to proclaim our individuality\nwhen we move amid a crowd of ignorant Isosceles.",
        "The fashion spread like wildfire.  Before a week was over,\nevery Square and Triangle in the district had copied the example\nof Chromatistes, and only a few of the more conservative Pentagons\nstill held out.  A month or two found even the Dodecagons\ninfected with the innovation.  A year had not elapsed before\nthe habit had spread to all but the very highest of the Nobility.\nNeedless to say, the custom soon made its way from the district of\nChromatistes to surrounding regions; and within two generations no one\nin all Flatland was colourless except the Women and the Priests.",
        "Here Nature herself appeared to erect a barrier, and to plead\nagainst extending the innovation to these two classes.\nMany-sidedness was almost essential as a pretext for the Innovators.\n“Distinction of sides is intended by Nature to imply distinction\nof colours” — such was the sophism which in those days\nflew from mouth to mouth, converting whole towns at a time\nto the new culture.  But manifestly to our Priests and Women\nthis adage did not apply.  The latter had only one side,\nand therefore — plurally and pedantically speaking — NO SIDES.\nThe former — if at least they would assert their claim to be\nreally and truly Circles, and not mere high-class Polygons\nwith an infinitely large number of infinitesimally small sides —\nwere in the habit of boasting (what Women confessed and deplored)\nthat they also had no sides, being blessed with a perimeter of\none line, or, in other words, a Circumference.  Hence it came to pass\nthat these two Classes could see no force in the so-called axiom about\n“Distinction of Sides implying Distinction of Colour\"; and when\nall others had succumbed to the fascinations of corporal decoration,\nthe Priests and the Women alone still remained pure from\nthe pollution of paint.",
        "Immoral, licentious, anarchical, unscientific — call them\nby what names you will — yet, from an aesthetic point of view,\nthose ancient days of the Colour Revolt were the glorious childhood of\nArt in Flatland — a childhood, alas, that never ripened into manhood,\nnor even reached the blossom of youth.  To live was then in itself\na delight, because living implied seeing.  Even at a small party,\nthe company was a pleasure to behold; the richly varied hues\nof the assembly in a church or theatre are said to have more than once\nproved too distracting for our greatest teachers and actors;\nbut most ravishing of all is said to have been the unspeakable\nmagnificence of a military review.",
        "The sight of a line of battle of twenty thousand Isosceles suddenly\nfacing about, and exchanging the sombre black of their bases for\nthe orange and purple of the two sides including their acute angle;\nthe militia of the Equilateral Triangles tricoloured in red, white,\nand blue; the mauve, ultra-marine, gamboge, and burnt umber\nof the Square artillerymen rapidly rotating near their vermilion guns;\nthe dashing and flashing of the five-coloured and six-coloured\nPentagons and Hexagons careering across the field in their offices\nof surgeons, geometricians and aides-de-camp — all these may well\nhave been sufficient to render credible the famous story\nhow an illustrious Circle, overcome by the artistic beauty\nof the forces under his command, threw aside his marshal’s baton\nand his royal crown, exclaiming that he henceforth exchanged them\nfor the artist’s pencil.  How great and glorious the sensuous\ndevelopment of these days must have been is in part\nindicated by the very language and vocabulary of the period.\nThe commonest utterances of the commonest citizens in the time\nof the Colour Revolt seem to have been suffused with a richer tinge\nof word or thought; and to that era we are even now indebted for\nour finest poetry and for whatever rhythm still remains\nin the more scientific utterance of these modern days.",
