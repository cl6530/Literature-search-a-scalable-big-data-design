        "    You Can Do It!",
        "The editor laid a nervous hand on Stephen’s shoulder.",
        "–I want you to write something for me, he said. Something with a bite in\nit. You can do it. I see it in your face. IN THE LEXICON OF YOUTH ...",
        "See it in your face. See it in your eye. Lazy idle little schemer.",
        "–Foot and mouth disease! the editor cried in scornful invective. Great\nnationalist meeting in Borris-in-Ossory. All balls! Bulldosing the public!\nGive them something with a bite in it. Put us all into it, damn its soul.\nFather, Son and Holy Ghost and Jakes M’Carthy.",
        "–We can all supply mental pabulum, Mr O’Madden Burke said.",
        "Stephen raised his eyes to the bold unheeding stare.",
        "–He wants you for the pressgang, J. J. O’Molloy said.",
        "    the Great Gallaher",
        "–You can do it, Myles Crawford repeated, clenching his hand in emphasis.\nWait a minute. We’ll paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher used to say when\nhe was on the shaughraun, doing billiardmarking in the Clarence. Gallaher,\nthat was a pressman for you. That was a pen. You know how he made his\nmark? I’ll tell you. That was the smartest piece of journalism ever known.\nThat was in eightyone, sixth of May, time of the invincibles, murder in\nthe Phoenix park, before you were born, I suppose. I’ll show you.",
        "He pushed past them to the files.",
        "–Look at here, he said turning. The NEW YORK WORLD cabled for a special.\nRemember that time?",
        "Professor MacHugh nodded.",
        "–NEW YORK WORLD, the editor said, excitedly pushing back his straw hat.\nWhere it took place. Tim Kelly, or Kavanagh I mean. Joe Brady and the\nrest of them. Where Skin-the-Goat drove the car. Whole route, see?",
        "–Skin-the-Goat, Mr O’Madden Burke said. Fitzharris. He has that\ncabman’s shelter, they say, down there at Butt bridge. Holohan told me.\nYou know Holohan?",
        "–Hop and carry one, is it? Myles Crawford said.",
        "–And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding stones for\nthe corporation. A night watchman.",
        "Stephen turned in surprise.",
        "–Gumley? he said. You don’t say so? A friend of my father’s, is it?",
        "–Never mind Gumley, Myles Crawford cried angrily. Let Gumley mind\nthe stones, see they don’t run away. Look at here. What did Ignatius\nGallaher do? I’ll tell you. Inspiration of genius. Cabled right away. Have\nyou WEEKLY FREEMAN of 17 March? Right. Have you got that?",
        "He flung back pages of the files and stuck his finger on a point.",
        "–Take page four, advertisement for Bransome’s coffee, let us say. Have\nyou got that? Right.",
        "The telephone whirred.",
        "    a Distant Voice",
        "–I’ll answer it, the professor said, going.",
        "–B is parkgate. Good.",
        "His finger leaped and struck point after point, vibrating.",
        "–T is viceregal lodge. C is where murder took place. K is Knockmaroon\ngate.",
        "The loose flesh of his neck shook like a cock’s wattles. An illstarched\ndicky jutted up and with a rude gesture he thrust it back into his\nwaistcoat.",
        "–Hello? EVENING TELEGRAPH here ... Hello?... Who’s there? ...\nYes ... Yes ... Yes.",
        "–F to P is the route Skin-the-Goat drove the car for an alibi, Inchicore,\nRoundtown, Windy Arbour, Palmerston Park, Ranelagh. F.A.B.P. Got that?\nX is Davy’s publichouse in upper Leeson street.",
        "The professor came to the inner door.",
        "–Bloom is at the telephone, he said.",
        "–Tell him go to hell, the editor said promptly. X is Davy’s publichouse,\nsee?",
        "    Clever, Very",
        "–Clever, Lenehan said. Very.",
        "–Gave it to them on a hot plate, Myles Crawford said, the whole bloody\nhistory.",
        "Nightmare from which you will never awake.",
        "–I saw it, the editor said proudly. I was present. Dick Adams, the\nbesthearted bloody Corkman the Lord ever put the breath of life in, and\nmyself.",
        "Lenehan bowed to a shape of air, announcing:",
        "–Madam, I’m Adam. And Able was I ere I saw Elba.",
        "–History! Myles Crawford cried. The Old Woman of Prince’s street was\nthere first. There was weeping and gnashing of teeth over that. Out of an\nadvertisement. Gregor Grey made the design for it. That gave him the leg\nup. Then Paddy Hooper worked Tay Pay who took him on to the STAR.\nNow he’s got in with Blumenfeld. That’s press. That’s talent. Pyatt! He\nwas all their daddies!",
        "–The father of scare journalism, Lenehan confirmed, and the\nbrother-in-law of Chris Callinan.",
        "–Hello? ... Are you there? ... Yes, he’s here still. Come across\nyourself.",
        "–Where do you find a pressman like that now, eh? the editor cried.\nHe flung the pages down.",
        "–Clamn dever, Lenehan said to Mr O’Madden Burke.",
        "–Very smart, Mr O’Madden Burke said.",
        "Professor MacHugh came from the inner office.",
        "–Talking about the invincibles, he said, did you see that some hawkers\nwere up before the recorder ...",
        "–O yes, J. J. O’Molloy said eagerly. Lady Dudley was walking home\nthrough the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that cyclone\nlast year and thought she’d buy a view of Dublin. And it turned out to be\na commemoration postcard of Joe Brady or Number One or Skin-the-Goat.\nRight outside the viceregal lodge, imagine!",
        "–They’re only in the hook and eye department, Myles Crawford said.\nPsha! Press and the bar! Where have you a man now at the bar like those\nfellows, like Whiteside, like Isaac Butt, like silvertongued O’Hagan. Eh?\nAh, bloody nonsense. Psha! Only in the halfpenny place.",
        "His mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain.",
        "Would anyone wish that mouth for her kiss? How do you know? Why did\nyou write it then?",
        "    Rhymes and Reasons",
        "Mouth, south. Is the mouth south someway? Or the south a mouth?\nMust be some. South, pout, out, shout, drouth. Rhymes: two men dressed\nthe same, looking the same, two by two.",

        "He saw them three by three, approaching girls, in green, in rose, in\nrusset, entwining, PER L’AER PERSO, in mauve, in purple, QUELLA PACIFICA\nORIAFIAMMA, gold of oriflamme, DI RIMIRAR FE PIU ARDENTI. But I old men,\npenitent, leadenfooted, underdarkneath the night: mouth south: tomb womb.",
        "–Speak up for yourself, Mr O’Madden Burke said.",
        "    Sufficient For the Day ...",
        "J. J. O’Molloy, smiling palely, took up the gage.",
        "–My dear Myles, he said, flinging his cigarette aside, you put a false\nconstruction on my words. I hold no brief, as at present advised, for the\nthird profession qua profession but your Cork legs are running away with\nyou. Why not bring in Henry Grattan and Flood and Demosthenes and\nEdmund Burke? Ignatius Gallaher we all know and his Chapelizod boss,\nHarmsworth of the farthing press, and his American cousin of the Bowery\nguttersheet not to mention PADDY KELLY’S BUDGET, PUE’S OCCURRENCES and our\nwatchful friend THE SKIBBEREEN EAGLE. Why bring in a master of forensic\neloquence like Whiteside? Sufficient for the day is the newspaper thereof.",
        "    Links With Bygone Days of Yore",
        "–Grattan and Flood wrote for this very paper, the editor cried in his\nface. Irish volunteers. Where are you now? Established 1763. Dr Lucas.\nWho have you now like John Philpot Curran? Psha!",
        "–Well, J. J. O’Molloy said, Bushe K.C., for example.",
        "–Bushe? the editor said. Well, yes: Bushe, yes. He has a strain of it in\nhis blood. Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe.",
        "–He would have been on the bench long ago, the professor said, only\nfor ... But no matter.",
        "J. J. O’Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly:",
        "–One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my life\nfell from the lips of Seymour Bushe. It was in that case of fratricide,\nthe Childs murder case. Bushe defended him.",
        "    and in the Porches of Mine Ear Did Pour.",
        "By the way how did he find that out? He died in his sleep. Or the\nother story, beast with two backs?",
        "–What was that? the professor asked.",
        "    Italia, Magistra Artium",
        "–He spoke on the law of evidence, J. J. O’Molloy said, of Roman justice\nas contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code, the LEX TALIONIS. And he cited\nthe Moses of Michelangelo in the vatican.",
        "–Ha.",
        "–A few wellchosen words, Lenehan prefaced. Silence!",
        "Pause. J. J. O’Molloy took out his cigarettecase.",
        "False lull. Something quite ordinary.",
        "Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar.",
        "I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that\nit was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match,\nthat determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives.",
        "    a Polished Period",
        "J. J. O’Molloy resumed, moulding his words:",
        "–He said of it: THAT STONY EFFIGY IN FROZEN MUSIC, HORNED AND TERRIBLE,\nOF THE HUMAN FORM DIVINE, THAT ETERNAL SYMBOL OF WISDOM AND OF PROPHECY\nWHICH, IF AUGHT THAT THE IMAGINATION OR THE HAND OF SCULPTOR HAS WROUGHT\nIN MARBLE OF SOULTRANSFIGURED AND OF SOULTRANSFIGURING DESERVES TO LIVE,\nDESERVES TO LIVE.",
        "His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall.",
        "–Fine! Myles Crawford said at once.",
        "–The divine afflatus, Mr O’Madden Burke said.",
        "–You like it? J. J. O’Molloy asked Stephen.",
        "Stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed.\nHe took a cigarette from the case. J. J. O’Molloy offered his case to\nMyles Crawford. Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his\ntrophy, saying:",
        "–Muchibus thankibus.",
        "    a Man of High Morale",
        "–Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J. J. O’Molloy said to\nStephen. What do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal hush\npoets: A. E. the mastermystic? That Blavatsky woman started it. She was a\nnice old bag of tricks. A. E. has been telling some yankee interviewer\nthat you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about\nplanes of consciousness. Magennis thinks you must have been pulling\nA. E.’s leg. He is a man of the very highest morale, Magennis.",
        "Speaking about me. What did he say? What did he say? What did he\nsay about me? Don’t ask.",
        "–No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside.\nWait a moment. Let me say one thing. The finest display of oratory I ever\nheard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical\nsociety. Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had\nspoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days),\nadvocating the revival of the Irish tongue.",
        "He turned towards Myles Crawford and said:",
        "–You know Gerald Fitzgibbon. Then you can imagine the style of his\ndiscourse.",
        "–He is sitting with Tim Healy, J. J. O’Molloy said, rumour has it, on\nthe Trinity college estates commission.",
        "–He is sitting with a sweet thing, Myles Crawford said, in a child’s\nfrock. Go on. Well?",
        "–It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator,\nfull of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will not\nsay the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man’s contumely upon the\nnew movement. It was then a new movement. We were weak, therefore\nworthless.",
        "He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an\noutspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and\nringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new focus.",
        "    Impromptu",
        "In ferial tone he addressed J. J. O’Molloy:",
        "–Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed. That he had\nprepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one\nshorthandwriter in the hall. His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy\nbeard round it. He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he\nlooked (though he was not) a dying man.",
        "His gaze turned at once but slowly from J. J. O’Molloy’s towards\nStephen’s face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking. His unglazed\nlinen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his withering hair.\nStill seeking, he said:",
        "–When Fitzgibbon’s speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply.\nBriefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these.",
        "He raised his head firmly. His eyes bethought themselves once more.\nWitless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet.",
        "He began:",
        "–MR CHAIRMAN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: GREAT WAS MY ADMIRATION IN LISTENING\nTO THE REMARKS ADDRESSED TO THE YOUTH OF IRELAND A MOMENT SINCE BY MY\nLEARNED FRIEND. IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HAD BEEN TRANSPORTED INTO A COUNTRY\nFAR AWAY FROM THIS COUNTRY, INTO AN AGE REMOTE FROM THIS AGE, THAT I STOOD\nIN ANCIENT EGYPT AND THAT I WAS LISTENING TO THE SPEECH OF SOME HIGHPRIEST\nOF THAT LAND ADDRESSED TO THE YOUTHFUL MOSES.",
        "His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes\nascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech. And let our\ncrooked smokes. Noble words coming. Look out. Could you try your hand at\nit yourself?",
        "–AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HEARD THE VOICE OF THAT EGYPTIAN HIGHPRIEST\nRAISED IN A TONE OF LIKE HAUGHTINESS AND LIKE PRIDE. I HEARD HIS WORDS AND\nTHEIR MEANING WAS REVEALED TO ME.",
        "    From the Fathers",
        "It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are\ncorrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were\ngood could be corrupted. Ah, curse you! That’s saint Augustine.",
        "–WHY WILL YOU JEWS NOT ACCEPT OUR CULTURE, OUR RELIGION AND OUR\nLANGUAGE? YOU ARE A TRIBE OF NOMAD HERDSMEN: WE ARE A MIGHTY PEOPLE. YOU\nHAVE NO CITIES NOR NO WEALTH: OUR CITIES ARE HIVES OF HUMANITY AND OUR\nGALLEYS, TRIREME AND  QUADRIREME, LADEN WITH ALL MANNER MERCHANDISE FURROW\nTHE WATERS OF THE KNOWN GLOBE. YOU HAVE BUT EMERGED FROM PRIMITIVE\nCONDITIONS: WE HAVE A LITERATURE, A PRIESTHOOD, AN AGELONG HISTORY AND A\nPOLITY.",

        "Child, man, effigy.",
        "By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man\nsupple in combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone.",
        "–YOU PRAY TO A LOCAL AND OBSCURE IDOL: OUR TEMPLES, MAJESTIC AND\nMYSTERIOUS, ARE THE ABODES OF ISIS AND OSIRIS, OF HORUS AND AMMON RA.\nYOURS SERFDOM, AWE AND HUMBLENESS: OURS THUNDER AND THE SEAS. ISRAEL IS\nWEAK AND FEW ARE HER CHILDREN: EGYPT IS AN HOST AND TERRIBLE ARE HER ARMS.\n VAGRANTS AND DAYLABOURERS ARE YOU CALLED: THE WORLD TREMBLES AT OUR NAME.",
        "A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech. He lifted his voice above it\nboldly:",
        "–BUT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, HAD THE YOUTHFUL MOSES LISTENED TO AND\nACCEPTED THAT VIEW OF LIFE, HAD HE BOWED HIS HEAD AND BOWED HIS WILL AND\nBOWED HIS SPIRIT BEFORE THAT ARROGANT ADMONITION HE WOULD NEVER HAVE\nBROUGHT THE CHOSEN PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR HOUSE OF BONDAGE, NOR FOLLOWED THE\nPILLAR OF THE CLOUD BY DAY. HE WOULD NEVER HAVE SPOKEN WITH THE ETERNAL\nAMID LIGHTNINGS ON SINAI’S MOUNTAINTOP NOR EVER HAVE COME DOWN WITH THE\nLIGHT OF INSPIRATION SHINING IN HIS COUNTENANCE AND BEARING IN HIS ARMS\nTHE TABLES OF THE LAW, GRAVEN IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE OUTLAW.",
        "He ceased and looked at them, enjoying a silence.",
        "    Ominous–For Him!",
        "J. J. O’Molloy said not without regret:",
        "–And yet he died without having entered the land of promise.",
        "–A sudden–at–the–moment–though–from–lingering–illness–\noften–previously–expectorated–demise, Lenehan added. And with a\ngreat future behind him.",
        "The troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and\npattering up the staircase.",
        "–That is oratory, the professor said uncontradicted. Gone with the wind.\nHosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings. Miles of ears of porches.\nThe tribune’s words, howled and scattered to the four winds. A people\nsheltered within his voice. Dead noise. Akasic records of all that ever\nanywhere wherever was. Love and laud him: me no more.",
        "I have money.",
        "–Gentlemen, Stephen said. As the next motion on the agenda paper may I\nsuggest that the house do now adjourn?",
        "–You take my breath away. It is not perchance a French compliment? Mr\nO’Madden Burke asked. ’Tis the hour, methinks, when the winejug,\nmetaphorically speaking, is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry.",
        "–That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved. All that are in favour\nsay ay, Lenehan announced. The contrary no. I declare it carried. To which\nparticular boosing shed? ... My casting vote is: Mooney’s!",
        "He led the way, admonishing:",
        "–We will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters, will we not? Yes,\nwe will not. By no manner of means.",
        "Mr O’Madden Burke, following close, said with an ally’s lunge of his\numbrella:",
        "–Lay on, Macduff!",
        "–Chip of the old block! the editor cried, clapping Stephen on the\nshoulder. Let us go. Where are those blasted keys?",
        "He fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets.",
        "–Foot and mouth. I know. That’ll be all right. That’ll go in. Where are\nthey? That’s all right.",
        "He thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office.",
        "    Let Us Hope",
        "J. J. O’Molloy, about to follow him in, said quietly to Stephen:",
        "–I hope you will live to see it published. Myles, one moment.",
        "He went into the inner office, closing the door behind him.",
        "–Come along, Stephen, the professor said. That is fine, isn’t it? It has\nthe prophetic vision. FUIT ILIUM! The sack of windy Troy. Kingdoms of this\nworld. The masters of the Mediterranean are fellaheen today.",
        "The first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and\nrushed out into the street, yelling:",
        "–Racing special!",
        "Dublin. I have much, much to learn.",
        "They turned to the left along Abbey street.",
        "–I have a vision too, Stephen said.",
        "–Yes? the professor said, skipping to get into step. Crawford will\nfollow.",
        "Another newsboy shot past them, yelling as he ran:",
        "–Racing special!",
        "    Dear Dirty Dublin",
        "Dubliners.",
        "–Two Dublin vestals, Stephen said, elderly and pious, have lived fifty\nand fiftythree years in Fumbally’s lane.",
        "–Where is that? the professor asked.",
        "–Off Blackpitts, Stephen said.",
        "Damp night reeking of hungry dough. Against the wall. Face\nglistering tallow under her fustian shawl. Frantic hearts. Akasic records.\nQuicker, darlint!",
        "On now. Dare it. Let there be life.",
        "–They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelson’s pillar.\nThey save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox. They\nshake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies with\nthe blade of a knife. Two and three in silver and one and seven in\ncoppers. They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their\numbrellas for fear it may come on to rain.",
        "–Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said.",
        "    Life On the Raw",
        "–They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at\nthe north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate Collins,\nproprietress ... They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from a girl at\nthe foot of Nelson’s pillar to take off the thirst of the brawn. They give\ntwo threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin to waddle\nslowly up the winding staircase, grunting, encouraging each other, afraid\nof the dark, panting, one asking the other have you the brawn, praising\nGod and the Blessed Virgin, threatening to come down, peeping at the\nairslits. Glory be to God. They had no idea it was that high.",
        "Their names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe. Anne Kearns\nhas the lumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water, given her by a lady\nwho got a bottleful from a passionist father. Florence MacCabe takes a\ncrubeen and a bottle of double X for supper every Saturday.",
        "–Antithesis, the professor said nodding twice. Vestal virgins. I can see\nthem. What’s keeping our friend?",
        "He turned.",
        "A bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps, scattering in\nall directions, yelling, their white papers fluttering. Hard after them\nMyles Crawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet face,\ntalking with J. J. O’Molloy.",
        "–Come along, the professor cried, waving his arm.",
        "He set off again to walk by Stephen’s side.",

        "–Yes, he said. I see them.",
        "Mr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the\noffices of the IRISH CATHOLIC AND DUBLIN PENNY JOURNAL, called:",

        "–TELEGRAPH! Racing special!",
        "–What is it? Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace.",
        "A newsboy cried in Mr Bloom’s face:",

        "    Interview With the Editor",
        "–Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps,\npuffing, and taking the cutting from his pocket. I spoke with Mr Keyes\njust now. He’ll give a renewal for two months, he says. After he’ll see.\nBut he wants a par to call attention in the TELEGRAPH too, the Saturday\npink. And he wants it copied if it’s not too late I told councillor\nNannetti from the KILKENNY PEOPLE. I can have access to it in the national\nlibrary. House of keys, don’t you see? His name is Keyes. It’s a play on\nthe name. But he practically promised he’d give the renewal. But he wants\njust a little puff. What will I tell him, Mr Crawford?",
        "    K.m.a.",
        "–Will you tell him he can kiss my arse? Myles Crawford said throwing out\nhis arm for emphasis. Tell him that straight from the stable.",
        "A bit nervy. Look out for squalls. All off for a drink. Arm in arm.\nLenehan’s yachting cap on the cadge beyond. Usual blarney. Wonder is\nthat young Dedalus the moving spirit. Has a good pair of boots on him\ntoday. Last time I saw him he had his heels on view. Been walking in muck\nsomewhere. Careless chap. What was he doing in Irishtown?",
        "–Well, Mr Bloom said, his eyes returning, if I can get the design I\nsuppose it’s worth a short par. He’d give the ad, I think. I’ll tell\nhim ...",
        "    K.m.r.i.a.",

        "    Raising the Wind",
        "–NULLA BONA, Jack, he said, raising his hand to his chin. I’m up to\nhere. I’ve been through the hoop myself. I was looking for a fellow to\nback a bill for me no later than last week. Sorry, Jack. You must take the\nwill for the deed. With a heart and a half if I could raise the wind\nanyhow.",
        "J. J. O’Molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently. They caught\nup on the others and walked abreast.",
        "–When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty\nfingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the\nrailings.",
        "–Something for you, the professor explained to Myles Crawford. Two old\nDublin women on the top of Nelson’s pillar.",
        "    SOME COLUMN!–\n    THAT’S WHAT WADDLER ONE SAID",
        "–That’s new, Myles Crawford said. That’s copy. Out for the waxies\nDargle. Two old trickies, what?",

        "Urbane, to comfort them, the quaker librarian purred:",
        "–And we have, have we not, those priceless pages of WILHELM MEISTER. A\ngreat poet on a great brother poet. A hesitating soul taking arms against\na sea of troubles, torn by conflicting doubts, as one sees in real life.",
        "He came a step a sinkapace forward on neatsleather creaking and a step\nbackward a sinkapace on the solemn floor.",
        "A noiseless attendant setting open the door but slightly made him a\nnoiseless beck.",
        "–Directly, said he, creaking to go, albeit lingering. The beautiful\nineffectual dreamer who comes to grief against hard facts. One always\nfeels that Goethe’s judgments are so true. True in the larger analysis.",
        "Twicreakingly analysis he corantoed off. Bald, most zealous by the door\nhe gave his large ear all to the attendant’s words: heard them: and was\ngone.",
        "Two left.",
        "–Monsieur de la Palice, Stephen sneered, was alive fifteen minutes\nbefore his death.",
        "–Have you found those six brave medicals, John Eglinton asked with\nelder’s gall, to write PARADISE LOST at your dictation? THE SORROWS OF\nSATAN he calls it.",
        "Smile. Smile Cranly’s smile.",
        "    FIRST HE TICKLED HER\n    THEN HE PATTED HER\n    THEN HE PASSED THE FEMALE CATHETER.\n    FOR HE WAS A MEDICAL\n    JOLLY OLD MEDI ...",
        "–I feel you would need one more for HAMLET. Seven is dear to the mystic\nmind. The shining seven W.B. calls them.",
        "Glittereyed his rufous skull close to his greencapped desklamp sought the\nface bearded amid darkgreener shadow, an ollav, holyeyed. He laughed low:\na sizar’s laugh of Trinity: unanswered.",
        "    ORCHESTRAL SATAN, WEEPING MANY A ROOD\n    TEARS SUCH AS ANGELS WEEP.\n    ED EGLI AVEA DEL CUL FATTO TROMBETTA.",
        "He holds my follies hostage.",
        "Cranly’s eleven true Wicklowmen to free their sireland. Gaptoothed\nKathleen, her four beautiful green fields, the stranger in her house. And\none more to hail him: AVE, RABBI: the Tinahely twelve. In the shadow of\nthe glen he cooees for them. My soul’s youth I gave him, night by night.\nGod speed. Good hunting.",
        "Mulligan has my telegram.",
        "Folly. Persist.",
        "–Our young Irish bards, John Eglinton censured, have yet to create a\nfigure which the world will set beside Saxon Shakespeare’s Hamlet though\nI admire him, as old Ben did, on this side idolatry.",
        "–All these questions are purely academic, Russell oracled out of his\nshadow. I mean, whether Hamlet is Shakespeare or James I or Essex.\nClergymen’s discussions of the historicity of Jesus. Art has to reveal to\nus ideas, formless spiritual essences. The supreme question about a work\nof art is out of how deep a life does it spring. The painting of Gustave\nMoreau is the painting of ideas. The deepest poetry of Shelley, the words\nof Hamlet bring our minds into contact with the eternal wisdom, Plato’s\nworld of ideas. All the rest is the speculation of schoolboys for\nschoolboys.",
        "A. E. has been telling some yankee interviewer. Wall, tarnation strike\nme!",
        "–The schoolmen were schoolboys first, Stephen said superpolitely.\nAristotle was once Plato’s schoolboy.",
        "–And has remained so, one should hope, John Eglinton sedately said. One\ncan see him, a model schoolboy with his diploma under his arm.",
        "He laughed again at the now smiling bearded face.",
        "Formless spiritual. Father, Word and Holy Breath. Allfather, the heavenly\nman. Hiesos Kristos, magician of the beautiful, the Logos who suffers in\nus at every moment. This verily is that. I am the fire upon the altar. I\nam the sacrificial butter.",
        "Dunlop, Judge, the noblest Roman of them all, A.E., Arval, the Name\nIneffable, in heaven hight: K.H., their master, whose identity is no\nsecret to adepts. Brothers of the great white lodge always watching to\nsee if they can help. The Christ with the bridesister, moisture of light,\nborn of an ensouled virgin, repentant sophia, departed to the plane of\nbuddhi. The life esoteric is not for ordinary person. O.P. must work off\nbad karma first. Mrs Cooper Oakley once glimpsed our very illustrious\nsister H.P.B.’s elemental.",
        "O, fie! Out on’t! PFUITEUFEL! You naughtn’t to look, missus, so you\nnaughtn’t when a lady’s ashowing of her elemental.",
        "Mr Best entered, tall, young, mild, light. He bore in his hand with grace\na notebook, new, large, clean, bright.",
        "–That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet’s musings about\nthe afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and\nundramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato’s.",
        "John Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth:",
        "–Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle\nwith Plato.",
        "–Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from his\ncommonwealth?",
        "Unsheathe your dagger definitions. Horseness is the whatness of allhorse.\nStreams of tendency and eons they worship. God: noise in the street: very\nperipatetic. Space: what you damn well have to see. Through spaces\nsmaller than red globules of man’s blood they creepycrawl after Blake’s\nbuttocks into eternity of which this vegetable world is but a shadow.\nHold to the now, the here, through which all future plunges to the past.",
        "Mr Best came forward, amiable, towards his colleague.",
        "–Haines is gone, he said.",
        "–Is he?",
        "–I was showing him Jubainville’s book. He’s quite enthusiastic, don’t\nyou know, about Hyde’s LOVESONGS OF CONNACHT. I couldn’t bring him in to\nhear the discussion. He’s gone to Gill’s to buy it.",
        "    BOUND THEE FORTH, MY BOOKLET, QUICK\n    TO GREET THE CALLOUS PUBLIC.\n    WRIT, I WEEN, ’TWAS NOT MY WISH\n    IN LEAN UNLOVELY ENGLISH.",
        "–The peatsmoke is going to his head, John Eglinton opined.",
        "We feel in England. Penitent thief. Gone. I smoked his baccy. Green\ntwinkling stone. An emerald set in the ring of the sea.",
        "–People do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be, the auric egg of\nRussell warned occultly. The movements which work revolutions in the\nworld are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasant’s heart on the\nhillside. For them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the living\nmother. The rarefied air of the academy and the arena produce the\nsixshilling novel, the musichall song. France produces the finest flower\nof corruption in Mallarme but the desirable life is revealed only to the\npoor of heart, the life of Homer’s Phaeacians.",
        "From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.",
        "–Mallarme, don’t you know, he said, has written those wonderful prose\npoems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris. The one about HAMLET.\nHe says: IL SE PROMENE, LISANT AU LIVRE DE LUI-MEME, don’t you know,\nREADING THE BOOK OF HIMSELF. He describes HAMLET given in a French town,\ndon’t you know, a provincial town. They advertised it.",
        "His free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air.",
        "    HAMLET\n    OU\n    LE DISTRAIT\n    PIECE DE SHAKESPEARE",
        " He repeated to John Eglinton’s newgathered frown:",
        "–PIECE DE SHAKESPEARE, don’t you know. It’s so French. The French point\nof view. HAMLET OU ...",
        "–The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended.",
        " John Eglinton laughed.",
        "–Yes, I suppose it would be, he said. Excellent people, no doubt, but\ndistressingly shortsighted in some matters.",
        " Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.",
        "–A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen said. Not for\nnothing was he a butcher’s son, wielding the sledded poleaxe and spitting\nin his palms. Nine lives are taken off for his father’s one. Our Father\nwho art in purgatory. Khaki Hamlets don’t hesitate to shoot. The\nbloodboltered shambles in act five is a forecast of the concentration\ncamp sung by Mr Swinburne.",
        "Cranly, I his mute orderly, following battles from afar.",
        "    WHELPS AND DAMS OF MURDEROUS FOES WHOM NONE\n    BUT WE HAD SPARED ...",
        "Between the Saxon smile and yankee yawp. The devil and the deep sea.",
        "–He will have it that HAMLET is a ghoststory, John Eglinton said for Mr\nBest’s behoof. Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our flesh\ncreep.",
        "    List! List! O List!",
        "My flesh hears him: creeping, hears.",
        "    IF THOU DIDST EVER ...",
        "–What is a ghost? Stephen said with tingling energy. One who has faded\ninto impalpability through death, through absence, through change of\nmanners. Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris\nlies from virgin Dublin. Who is the ghost from LIMBO PATRUM, returning to\nthe world that has forgotten him? Who is King Hamlet?",
        "John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.",
