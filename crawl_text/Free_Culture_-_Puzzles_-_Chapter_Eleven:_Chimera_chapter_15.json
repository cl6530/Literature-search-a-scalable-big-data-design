        "In a well-known short story by H. G. Wells, a mountain climber named Nunez trips \n(literally, down an ice slope) into an unknown and isolated valley in the \nPeruvian Andes. [1] The valley is extraordinarily beautiful, with sweet water, \npasture, an even climate, slopes of rich brown soil with tangles of a shrub that \nbore an excellent fruit. But the villagers are all blind. Nunez takes this as \nan opportunity. In the Country of the Blind, he tells himself, the One-Eyed \nMan is King. So he resolves to live with the villagers to explore life as a \nking.",
        "Things don’t go quite as he planned. He tries to explain the idea of sight to \nthe villagers. They don’t understand. He tells them they are blind. They don’t \nhave the word blind. They think he’s just thick. Indeed, as they increasingly \nnotice the things he can’t do (hear the sound of grass being stepped on, for \nexample), they increasingly try to control him. He, in turn, becomes \nincreasingly frustrated. You don’t understand,’ he cried, in a voice that was \nmeant to be great and resolute, and which broke. You are blind and I can see. \nLeave me alone!’",
        "The villagers don’t leave him alone. Nor do they see (so to speak) the virtue of \nhis special power. Not even the ultimate target of his affection, a young woman \nwho to him seems the most beautiful thing in the whole of creation, \nunderstands the beauty of sight. Nunez’s description of what he sees seemed to \nher the most poetical of fancies, and she listened to his description of the \nstars and the mountains and her own sweet white-lit beauty as though it was a \nguilty indulgence. She did not believe, Wells tells us, and she could only \nhalf understand, but she was mysteriously delighted.",
        "When Nunez announces his desire to marry his mysteriously delighted love, the \nfather and the village object. You see, my dear, her father instructs, he’s \nan idiot. He has delusions. He can’t do anything right. They take Nunez to the \nvillage doctor.",
        "After a careful examination, the doctor gives his opinion. His brain is \naffected, he reports.",
        "What affects it? the father asks.",
        "Those queer things that are called the eyes ... are diseased ... in such a way \nas to affect his brain.",
        "The doctor continues: I think I may say with reasonable certainty that in order \nto cure him completely, all that we need to do is a simple and easy surgical \noperationnamely, to remove these irritant bodies [the eyes].",
        "Thank Heaven for science! says the father to the doctor. They inform Nunez of \nthis condition necessary for him to be allowed his bride. (You’ll have to read \nthe original to learn what happens in the end. I believe in free culture, but \nnever in giving away the end of a story.)",
        "It sometimes happens that the eggs of twins fuse in the mother’s womb. That \nfusion produces a chimera. A chimera is a single creature with two sets of \nDNA. The DNA in the blood, for example, might be different from the DNA of the \nskin. This possibility is an underused plot for murder mysteries. But the DNA \nshows with 100 percent certainty that she was not the person whose blood was at \nthe scene. ...",
        "Before I had read about chimeras, I would have said they were impossible. A \nsingle person can’t have two sets of DNA. The very idea of DNA is that it is the \ncode of an individual. Yet in fact, not only can two individuals have the same \nset of DNA (identical twins), but one person can have two different sets of DNA \n(a chimera). Our understanding of a person should reflect this reality.",
        "The more I work to understand the current struggle over copyright and culture, \nwhich I’ve sometimes called unfairly, and sometimes not unfairly enough, the \ncopyright wars, the more I think we’re dealing with a chimera. For example, in \nthe battle over the question What is p2p file sharing? both sides have it \nright, and both sides have it wrong. One side says, File sharing is just like \ntwo kids taping each others’ recordsthe sort of thing we’ve been doing for the \nlast thirty years without any question at all. That’s true, at least in part. \nWhen I tell my best friend to try out a new CD that I’ve bought, but rather than \njust send the CD, I point him to my p2p server, that is, in all relevant \nrespects, just like what every executive in every recording company no doubt did \nas a kid: sharing music.",
        "But the description is also false in part. For when my p2p server is on a p2p \nnetwork through which anyone can get access to my music, then sure, my friends \ncan get access, but it stretches the meaning of friends beyond recognition to \nsay my ten thousand best friends can get access. Whether or not sharing my \nmusic with my best friend is what we have always been allowed to do, we have \nnot always been allowed to share music with our ten thousand best friends.",
        "Likewise, when the other side says, File sharing is just like walking into a \nTower Records and taking a CD off the shelf and walking out with it, that’s \ntrue, at least in part. If, after Lyle Lovett (finally) releases a new album, \nrather than buying it, I go to Kazaa and find a free copy to take, that is very \nmuch like stealing a copy from Tower.",
        "But it is not quite stealing from Tower. After all, when I take a CD from Tower \nRecords, Tower has one less CD to sell. And when I take a CD from Tower Records, \nI get a bit of plastic and a cover, and something to show on my shelves. (And, \nwhile we’re at it, we could also note that when I take a CD from Tower Records, \nthe maximum fine that might be imposed on me, under California law, at least, is \n$1,000. According to the RIAA, by contrast, if I download a ten-song CD, I’m \nliable for $1,500,000 in damages.)",
        "The point is not that it is as neither side describes. The point is that it is \nbothboth as the RIAA describes it and as Kazaa describes it. It is a chimera. \nAnd rather than simply denying what the other side asserts, we need to begin to \nthink about how we should respond to this chimera. What rules should govern it?",
        "We could respond by simply pretending that it is not a chimera. We could, with \nthe RIAA, decide that every act of file sharing should be a felony. We could \nprosecute families for millions of dollars in damages just because file sharing \noccurred on a family computer. And we can get universities to monitor all \ncomputer traffic to make sure that no computer is used to commit this crime. \nThese responses might be extreme, but each of them has either been proposed or \nactually implemented. [2]",
        "Alternatively, we could respond to file sharing the way many kids act as though \nwe’ve responded. We could totally legalize it. Let there be no copyright \nliability, either civil or criminal, for making copyrighted content available on \nthe Net. Make file sharing like gossip: regulated, if at all, by social norms \nbut not by law.",
        "Either response is possible. I think either would be a mistake. Rather than \nembrace one of these two extremes, we should embrace something that recognizes \nthe truth in both. And while I end this book with a sketch of a system that does \njust that, my aim in the next chapter is to show just how awful it would be for \nus to adopt the zero-tolerance extreme. I believe either extreme would be \nworse than a reasonable alternative. But I believe the zero-tolerance solution \nwould be the worse of the two extremes.",
        "Yet zero tolerance is increasingly our government’s policy. In the middle of the \nchaos that the Internet has created, an extraordinary land grab is occurring. \nThe law and technology are being shifted to give content holders a kind of \ncontrol over our culture that they have never had before. And in this extremism, \nmany an opportunity for new innovation and new creativity will be lost.",
        "I’m not talking about the opportunities for kids to steal music. My focus \ninstead is the commercial and cultural innovation that this war will also kill. \nWe have never seen the power to innovate spread so broadly among our citizens, \nand we have just begun to see the innovation that this power will unleash. Yet \nthe Internet has already seen the passing of one cycle of innovation around \ntechnologies to distribute content. The law is responsible for this passing. As \nthe vice president for global public policy at one of these new innovators, \neMusic.com, put it when criticizing the DMCA’s added protection for copyrighted \nmaterial,",
        "eMusic opposes music piracy. We are a distributor of copyrighted material, and \nwe want to protect those rights.",
        "But building a technology fortress that locks in the clout of the major labels \nis by no means the only way to protect copyright interests, nor is it \nnecessarily the best. It is simply too early to answer that question. Market \nforces operating naturally may very well produce a totally different industry \nmodel.",
        "This is a critical point. The choices that industry sectors make with respect \nto these systems will in many ways directly shape the market for digital media \nand the manner in which digital media are distributed. This in turn will \ndirectly influence the options that are available to consumers, both in terms of \nthe ease with which they will be able to access digital media and the equipment \nthat they will require to do so. Poor choices made this early in the game will \nretard the growth of this market, hurting everyone’s interests. [3]",
        "In April 2001, eMusic.com was purchased by Vivendi Universal, one of the major \nlabels. Its position on these matters has now changed.",
        "Reversing our tradition of tolerance now will not merely quash piracy. It will \nsacrifice values that are important to this culture, and will kill opportunities \nthat could be extraordinarily valuable.",
