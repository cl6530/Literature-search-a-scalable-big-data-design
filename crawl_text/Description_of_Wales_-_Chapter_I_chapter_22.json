        "Of the inconstancy and instability of this nation, and their want\nof reverence for good faith and oaths",
        "These people are no less light in mind than in body, and are by no\nmeans to be relied upon.  They are easily urged to undertake any\naction, and are as easily checked from prosecuting it - a people\nquick in action, but more stubborn in a bad than in a good cause,\nand constant only in acts of inconstancy.  They pay no respect to\noaths, faith, or truth; and so lightly do they esteem the covenant\nof faith, held so inviolable by other nations, that it is usual to\nsacrifice their faith for nothing, by holding forth the right hand,\nnot only in serious and important concerns, but even on every\ntrifling occasion, and for the confirmation of almost every common\nassertion.  They never scruple at taking a false oath for the sake\nof any temporary emolument or advantage; so that in civil and\necclesiastical causes, each party, being ready to swear whatever\nseems expedient to its purpose, endeavours both to prove and\ndefend, although the venerable laws, by which oaths are deemed\nsacred, and truth is honoured and respected, by favouring the\naccused and throwing an odium upon the accuser, impose the burden\nof bringing proofs upon the latter.  But to a people so cunning and\ncrafty, this yoke is pleasant, and this burden is light.",
