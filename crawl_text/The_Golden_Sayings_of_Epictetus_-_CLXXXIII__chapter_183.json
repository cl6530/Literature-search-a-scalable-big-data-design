        "Favorinus(20) tells us how Epictetus would also say that there\nwere two faults far graver and fouler than any others—inability\nto bear, and inability to forbear, when we neither patiently bear\nthe blows that must be borne, nor abstain from the things and the\npleasures we ought to abstain from. “So,” he went on, “if a man\nwill only have these two words at heart, and heed them carefully\nby ruling and watching over himself, he will for the most part\nfall into no sin, and his life will be tranquil and serene.” He\nmeant the words  Avexou kai apexou—\"Bear and Forbear.”",
