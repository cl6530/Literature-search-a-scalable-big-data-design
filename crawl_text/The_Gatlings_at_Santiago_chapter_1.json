        "On the morning of July 1st, the dismounted cavalry, including my\nregiment, stormed Kettle Hill, driving the Spaniards from their\ntrenches. After taking the crest, I made the men under me turn and\nbegin volley-firing at the San Juan Blockhouse and intrenchments\nagainst which Hawkins’ and Kent’s Infantry were advancing. While thus\nfiring, there suddenly smote on our ears a peculiar drumming sound.\nOne or two of the men cried out, “The Spanish machine guns!” but,\nafter listening a moment, I leaped to my feet and called, “It’s the\nGatlings, men! It’s our Gatlings!” Immediately the troopers began to\ncheer lustily, for the sound was most inspiring. Whenever the drumming\nstopped, it was only to open again a little nearer the front. Our\nartillery, using black powder, had not been able to stand within range\nof the Spanish rifles, but it was perfectly evident that the Gatlings\nwere troubled by no such consideration, for they were advancing all\nthe while.",
        "Soon the infantry took San Juan Hill, and, after one false start, we\nin turn rushed the next line of block-houses and intrenchments, and\nthen swung to the left and took the chain of hills immediately\nfronting Santiago. Here I found myself on the extreme front, in\ncommand of the fragments of all six regiments of the cavalry division.\nI received orders to halt where I was, but to hold the hill at all\nhazards. The Spaniards were heavily reinforced and they opened a\ntremendous fire upon us from their batteries and trenches. We laid\ndown just behind the gentle crest of the hill, firing as we got the\nchance, but, for the most part, taking the fire without responding. As\nthe afternoon wore on, however, the Spaniards became bolder, and made\nan attack upon the position. They did not push it home, but they did\nadvance, their firing being redoubled. We at once ran forward to the\ncrest and opened on them, and, as we did so, the unmistakable drumming\nof the Gatlings opened abreast of us, to our right, and the men\ncheered again. As soon as the attack was definitely repulsed, I\nstrolled over to find out about the Gatlings, and there I found Lieut.\nParker with two of his guns right on our left, abreast of our men, who\nat that time were closer to the Spaniards than any others.",
        "From thence on, Parker’s Gatlings were our inseparable companions\nthroughout the siege. They were right up at the front. When we dug our\ntrenches, he took off the wheels of his guns and put them in the\ntrenches. His men and ours slept in the same bomb-proofs and shared\nwith one another whenever either side got a supply of beans or coffee\nand sugar. At no hour of the day or night was Parker anywhere but\nwhere we wished him to be, in the event of an attack. If a troop of my\nregiment was sent off to guard some road or some break in the lines,\nwe were almost certain to get Parker to send a Gatling along, and,\nwhether the change was made by day or by night, the Gatling went.\nSometimes we took the initiative and started to quell the fire of the\nSpanish trenches; sometimes they opened upon us; but, at whatever hour\nof the twenty-four the fighting began, the drumming of the Gatlings\nwas soon heard through the cracking of our own carbines.",
        "I have had too little experience to make my judgment final; but\ncertainly, if I were to command either a regiment or a brigade,\nwhether of cavalry or infantry, I would try to get a Gatling\nbattery–under a good man–with me. I feel sure that the greatest\npossible assistance would be rendered, under almost all circumstances,\nby such a Gatling battery, if well handled; for I believe that it\ncould be pushed fairly to the front of the firing-line. At any rate,\nthis is the way that Lieut. Parker used his battery when he went into\naction at San Juan, and when he kept it in the trenches beside the\nRough Riders before Santiago.",
