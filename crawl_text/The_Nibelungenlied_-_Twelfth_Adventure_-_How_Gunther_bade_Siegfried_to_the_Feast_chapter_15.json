        "Now all time bethought her / royal Gunther’s wife:\n“How now doth Lady Kriemhild / lead so haughty life?\nIn sooth her husband Siegfried / doth homage to us owe,\nBut now full long unto us / little service he doth show.”",
        "725",
        "That in her heart in secret / eke she pondered o’er.\nThat they were strangers to her / did grieve her heart full sore,\nAnd so seldom sign of service / came from Siegfried’s land.\nHow it thus was fallen, / that she fain would understand.",
        "726",
        "She probed then the monarch, / if the thing might be,\nThat she the Lady Kriemhild / once again might see.\nShe spake it all in secret / whereon her heart did dwell;\nThe thing she then did speak of / pleased the monarch passing well.",
        "727",
        "“How might we bring them hither\" / –spake the mighty king–\n“Unto this my country? / ’Twere ne’er to do, such thing.\nThey dwell too distant from us, / the quest I fear to make.\"\nThereto gave answer Brunhild, / and in full crafty wise she spake:",
        "728",
        "“How high soe’er and mighty / king’s man were ever one,\nWhate’er should bid his master, / may he not leave undone.\"\nThereat did smile King Gunther, / as such words spake she:\nNe’er bade he aught of service, / oft as Siegfried he did see.",
        "729",
        "She spake: “Full loving master, / as thou hold’st me dear,\nHelp me now that Siegfried / and thy sister fair\nCome to this our country, / that them we here may see;\nIn sooth no thing could ever / unto me more welcome be.",
        "730",
        "“Thy sister’s lofty bearing / and all her courtesy,\nWhene’er I think upon it, / full well it pleaseth me,\nHow we did sit together / when erst I was thy spouse!\nWell in sooth with honor / might she the valiant Siegfried choose.”",
        "731",
        "She pleaded with the monarch / so long till answered he:\n“Know now that guests none other / so welcome were to me.\nTo gain thy wish ’tis easy: / straight messengers of mine\nTo both shall message carry, / that hither come they to the Rhine.”",
        "732",
        "Thereto the queen gave answer: / “Now further shalt thou say,\nWhen thou them wilt summon, / or when shall be the day\nThat our dear friends come hither / unto our country.\nWho’ll bear thy message thither, / shalt thou eke make known to me.”",
        "733",
        "“That will I,” spake the monarch. / “Thirty of my men\nShall thither ride unto them.\" / The same he summoned then,\nAnd bade them with the message / to Siegfried’s land to fare.\nThey joyed as gave them Brunhild / stately raiment rich to wear.",
        "734",
        "Then further spake the monarch: / “Ye knights from me shall bring\nThis message, nor withhold ye / of it anything,\nUnto the doughty Siegfried / and eke my sister fair:\nIn the world could never any / to them a better purpose bear.",
        "735",
        "“And pray them both that hither / they come unto the Rhine.\nWith me will e’er my lady / such grace to pay combine,\nEre turn of sun in summer / he and his men shall know\nThat liveth here full many / to them would willing honor show.",
        "736",
        "“Unto royal Siegmund / bear greeting fair from me,\nThat I and my friends ever / to him well-minded be.\nAnd tell ye eke my sister / she shall no wise omit\nHither to friends to journey: / ne’er feast could better her befit.”",
        "737",
        "Brunhild and Ute / and ladies all at hand,\nThey sent a fairest greeting / unto Siegfried’s land\nTo winsome ladies many / and many a warrior brave.\nWith godspeed from the monarch / and friends the messengers took leave.",
        "738",
        "They fared with full equipment: / their steeds did ready stand\nAnd rich were they attired: / so rode they from that land\nThey hastened on the journey / whither they would fare;\nEscort safe the monarch / had bidden eke for them prepare.",
        "739",
        "Their journey had they ended / e’er three weeks were spent.\nAt the Nibelungen castle, / whither they were sent,\nIn the mark of Norway / found they the knight they sought,\nAnd weary were the horses / the messengers so far had brought.",
        "740",
        "Then was told to Siegfried / and to Kriemhild fair\nHow knights were there arrived / who did raiment wear\nLike as in land of Burgundy / of wont the warriors dressed.\nThereat did hasten Kriemhild / from couch where she did lying rest.",
        "741",
        "Then bade eke to a window / one of her maids to go.\nShe saw the valiant Gere / stand in the court below,\nAnd with him his companions, / who did thither fare.\nTo hear such joyous tidings, / how soon her heart forgot its care.",
        "742",
        "She spake unto the monarch: / “Look now thitherward\nWhere with the doughty Gere / stand in the castle yard\nWhom to us brother Gunther / adown the Rhine doth send!\"\nThereto spake doughty Siegfried: / “With greeting fair we’ll them\n      attend.”",
        "743",
        "Then hastened their retainers / all the guests to meet,\nAnd each of them in special / manner then did greet\nThe messengers full kindly / and warmest welcome bade.\nSiegmund did likewise / o’er their coming wax full glad.",
        "744",
        "In fitting way was harbored / Gere and his men,\nAnd steeds in charge were taken. / The messengers went then\nWhere beside Sir Siegfried / the Lady Kriemhild sat.\nTo court the guests were bidden, / where them did greeting fair await.",
        "745",
        "The host with his fair lady, / straightway up stood he,\nAnd greeted fairly Gere / of the land of Burgundy\nAnd with him his companions / King Gunther’s men also.\nGere, knight full mighty, / bade they to a settle go.",
        "746",
        "“Allow that first the message / we give ere sit we down;\nThe while we’ll stand, though weary / upon our journey grown.\nTidings bring we to you / what greetings high have sent\nGunther and Brunhild / who live in royal fair content.",
        "747",
        "“Eke what from Lady Ute / thy mother now we’ve brought.\nThe youthful Giselher / and also Sir Gernot\nAnd best among thy kinsmen / have sent us here to thee:\nA fairest greeting send they / from the land of Burgundy.”",
        "748",
        "“God give them meed,” spake Siegfried; / “Good will and faith withal\nI trow full well they harbor, / as with friends we shall;\nLikewise doth eke their sister. / Now further shall ye tell\nIf that our friends beloved / at home in high estate do dwell.",
        "749",
        "“Since that we from them parted / hath any dared to do\nScathe to my lady’s kinsmen? / That shall ye let me know.\nI’ll help them ever truly / all their need to bear\nTill that their enemies / have good cause my help to fear.”",
        "750",
        "Then spake the Margrave / Gere, a knight full good:\n“In all that maketh knighthood / right proud they stand of mood.\nUnto the Rhine they bid you / to high festivity:\nThey’d see you there full gladly, / thereof may ye not doubtful be.",
        "751",
        "“And bid they eke my Lady / Kriemhild that she too,\nWhen ended is the winter, / thither come with you.\nEre turn of sun in summer / trust they you to see.\"\nThen spake the doughty Siegfried: / “That same thing might hardly be.”",
        "752",
        "Thereto did answer Gere / of the land of Burgundy:\n“Your high mother Ute / hath message sent by me,\nLikewise Gernot and Giselher, / that they plead not in vain.\nThat you they see so seldom / daily hear I them complain.",
        "753",
        "“Brunhild my mistress / and all her company\nOf fair maids rejoice them; / if the thing might be\nThat they again should see you, / of merry mood they were.\"\nThen joy to hear the tidings / filled the Lady Kriemhild fair.",
        "754",
        "Gere to her was kinsman. / The host did bid him rest,\nNor long were they in pouring / wine for every guest.\nThither came eke Siegmund / where the strangers he did see,\nAnd in right friendly manner / spake to the men of Burgundy:",
        "755",
        "“Welcome be, ye warriors, / ye Gunther’s men, each one.\nSince that fair Kriemhild / Siegfried my son\nFor spouse did take unto him, / we should you ofter see\nHere in this our country, / an ye good friends to us would be.”",
        "756",
        "They spake, whene’er he wished it, / full glad to come were they.\nAll their mickle weariness / with joy was ta’en away.\nThe messengers were seated / and food to them they bore,\nWhereof did Siegfried offer / unto his guests a goodly store.",
        "757",
        "Until nine days were over / must they there abide,\nWhen did at last the valiant / knights begin to chide\nThat they did not ride thither / again unto their land.\nThen did the royal Siegfried / summon his good knights to hand.",
        "758",
        "He asked what they did counsel: / should they unto the Rhine?\n“Me unto him hath bidden / Gunther, friend of mine,\nHe and his good kinsmen, / to high festivity.\nThither went I full gladly, / but that his land so far doth lie.",
        "759",
        "“Kriemhild bid they likewise / that she with me shall fare.\nGood friends, now give ye counsel / how we therefor prepare.\nAnd were it armies thirty / to lead in distant land,\nYet must serve them gladly / evermore Siegfried’s hand.”",
        "760",
        "Then answer gave his warriors. / “An’t pleaseth thee to go\nThither to the festival, / we’ll counsel what thou do.\nThou shalt with thousand warriors / unto Rhine river ride.\nSo may’st thou well with honor / in the land of Burgundy abide.”",
        "761",
        "Then spake of Netherland / Siegmund the king:\n“Will ye to the festival, / why hide from me the thing!\nI’ll journey with you thither, / if it not displeasing be,\nAnd lead good thanes a hundred / wherewith to swell your company.”",
        "762",
        "“And wilt thou with us journey, / father full dear to me,\"\nSpake the valiant Siegfried, / “full glad thereat I’ll be.\nBefore twelve days are over / from these my lands I fare.\"\nTo all who’d join the journey / steeds gave they and apparel rare.",
        "763",
        "When now the lofty monarch / was minded thus to ride\nBade he the noble messengers / longer not to bide,\nAnd to his lady’s kinsmen / to the Rhine a message sent,\nHow that he would full gladly / join to make them merriment.",
        "764",
        "Siegfried and Kriemhild, / this same tale we hear,\nTo the messengers gave so richly / that the burden could not bear\nTheir horses with them homeward, / such wealth in sooth he had.\nThe horses heavy-laden / drove they thence with hearts full glad.",
        "765",
        "Siegfried and Siegmund / their people richly clad.\nEckewart the Margrave, / straightway he bade\nFor ladies choose rich clothing, / the best that might be found,\nOr e’er could be procured / in all Siegfried’s lands around.",
        "766",
        "The shields and the saddles / gan they eke prepare,\nTo knights and fair ladies / who with them should fare\nLacked nothing that they wished for, / but of all they were possessed.\nThen to his friends led Siegfried / many a high and stately guest.",
        "767",
        "The messengers swift hasted / homeward on their way,\nAnd soon again came Gere / to the land of Burgundy.\nFull well was he received, / and there dismounted all\nHis train from off their horses / before the royal Gunther’s Hall.",
        "768",
        "Old knights and youthful squires / crowded, as is their way,\nTo ask of them the tidings. / Thus did the brave knight say:\n“When to the king I tell them / then shall ye likewise hear.\"\nHe went with his companions / and soon ’fore Gunther did appear.",
        "769",
        "Full of joy the monarch / did from the settle spring;\nAnd did thank them also / for their hastening\nBrunhild the fair lady. / Spake Gunther eagerly:\n“How now liveth Siegfried, / whose arm hath oft befriended me?”",
        "770",
        "Then spake the valiant Gere: / “Joy o’er the visage went\nOf him and eke thy sister. / To friends was never sent\nA more faithful greeting / by good knight ever one,\nThan now the mighty Siegfried / and his royal sire have done.”",
        "771",
        "Then spake unto the Margrave / the noble monarch’s wife:\n“Now tell me, cometh Kriemhild? / And marketh yet her life\nAught of the noble bearing / did her erstwhile adorn?\"\n“She cometh to thee surely,\" / Gere answer did return.",
        "772",
        "Ute straightway the messengers / to her did command.\nThen might ye by her asking / full well understand\nTo her was joyous tidings / how Kriemhild did betide.\nHe told her how he found her, / and that she soon would hither ride.",
        "773",
        "Eke of all the presents / did they naught withhold,\nThat had given them Siegfried: / apparel rich and gold\nDisplayed they to the people / of the monarchs three.\nTo him were they full grateful / who thus had dealt so bounteously.",
        "774",
        "“Well may he,” quoth Hagen, / “of his treasure give,\nNor could he deal it fully, / should he forever live:\nHoard of the Nibelungen / beneath his hand doth lie.\nHeigh-ho, if came it ever / into the land of Burgundy!”",
        "775",
        "All the king’s retainers / glad they were thereat,\nThat the guests were coming. / Early then and late\nFull little were they idle, / the men of monarchs three.\nSeats builded they full many / toward the high festivity.",
        "776",
        "The valiant knight Hunold / and Sindold doughty thane\nLittle had of leisure. / Meantime must the twain,\nStands erect full many, / as their high office bade.\nTherein did help them Ortwein, / and Gunther’s thanks therefor they had.",
        "777",
        "Rumold the High Steward / busily he wrought\nAmong them that did serve him. / Full many a mighty pot,\nAnd spacious pans and kettles, / how many might ye see!\nFor those to them were coming / prepared they victuals plenteously.",
