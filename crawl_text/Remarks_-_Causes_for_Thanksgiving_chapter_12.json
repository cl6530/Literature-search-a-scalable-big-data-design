        "We are now rapidly approaching the date of our great national\nthanksgiving. Another year has almost passed by on the wings of tireless\ntime.",
        "Since last we gathered about the festive board and spattered the true\ninwardness of the family gobbler over the table cloth, remorseless time,\nwho knows not the weight of weariness, has sought out the good, the true\nand the beautiful, as well as the old, the sinful and the tough, and has\nlaid his heavy hand upon them. We have no more fitting illustration of the\ngreat truth that death prefers the young and tender than the deceased\nturkey upon which we are soon to operate. How still he lies, mowed down in\nlife’s young morn to make a yankee holiday.",
        "How changed he seems! Once so gay and festive, now so still, so strangely\nquiet and reserved. How calmly he lies, with his bare limbs buried in the\nlurid atmosphere like those of a hippytehop artist on the west side.",
        "Soon the amateur carver will plunge the shining blade into the unresisting\nbird, and the air will be filled with stuffing and half smothered\nprofanity. The Thanksgiving turkey is a grim humorist, and nothing pleases\nhim so well as to hide his joint in a new place and then flip over and\nsmile when the student misses it and buries the knife in the bosom of a\npersonal friend. Few men can retain their sang froid before company when\nthey have to get a step ladder and take down the second joint and the\nmerry thought from the chandelier while people are looking at them.",
        "And what has the past year brought us? Speaking from a Republican\nstandpoint, it has brought us a large wad of dark blue gloom. Speaking\nfrom a Democratic standpoint, it has been very prolific of fourth-class\npostoffices worth from $200 down to $1.35 per annum. Politically, the past\nyear has been one of wonderful changes. Many have, during the year just\npast, held office for the first time. Many, also, have gone out into the\ncold world since last Thanksgiving and seriously considered the great\nproblem of how to invest a small amount of actual perspiration in plain\ngroceries.",
        "Many who considered the life of a politician to be one of high priced food\nand inglorious ease, have found, now that they have the fruit, that it is\nashes on their lips.",
        "Our foreign relations have been mutually pleasant, and those who dwell\nacross the raging main, far removed from the refining influences of our\nprohibitory laws, have still made many grand strides toward the\namelioration of our lost and undone race. Many foreigners who have never\nexperienced the pleasure of drinking mysterious beverages from gas\nfixtures and burial caskets in Maine, or from a blind pig in Iowa, or a\nBabcock fire extinguisher in Kansas, still enjoy life by bombarding the\nCzar as he goes out after a scuttle of coal at night, or by putting a\nsurprise package of dynamite on the throne of a tottering dynasty, where\nsaid tottering dynasty will have to sit down upon it and then pass rapidly\nto another sphere of existence.",
        "Many startling changes have taken place since last November. The political\nfabric in our own land has assumed a different hue, and men who a year ago\nwere unnoticed and unknown are even more so now. This is indeed a healthy\nsign. No matter what party or faction may be responsible for this, I say\nin a wholly non-partisan spirit, that I am glad of it.",
        "I am glad to notice that, owing to the active enforcement of the Edmunds\nbill in Utah, polygamy has been made odorous. The day is not far distant\nwhen Utah will be admitted as a State and her motto will be “one country,\none flag, and one wife at a time.” Then will peace and prosperity unite to\nmake the modern Zion the habitation of men. The old style of hand-made\nvalley tan will give place to a less harmful beverage, and we will welcome\nthe new sister in the great family circle of States, not clothed in the\ndisagreeable endowment robe, but dressed up in the Mother Hubbard wrapper,\nwith a surcingle around it, such as the goddess of liberty wears when she\nhas her picture taken.",
        "Crops throughout the northwest have been fairly good, though the gain\nyield has been less in quantity and inferior in quality to that of last\nyear. A Democratic administration has certainly frowned upon the\nprofessional, partisan office seekers, but it has been unable to stay the\nonward march of the chintz bug or to produce a perceptible falling off in\npip among the yellow-limbed fowls. While Jeffersonian purity and economy\nhave seemed to rage with great virulence at Washington, in the northwest\nheaves and botts among horses and common, old-fashioned hollow horn among\ncattle have been the prevailing complaints.",
        "And yet there is much for which we should be thankful. Many broad-browed\nmen who knew how a good paper ought to be conducted, but who had no other\nvisible means of support, have passed on to another field of labor,\nleaving the work almost solely in the hands of the vast army of novices\nwho at the present are at the head of journalism throughout the country,\nand who sadly miss those timely words of caution that were wont to fall\nfrom the lips of those men whose spirits are floating through space,\nfinding fault with the arrangement of the solar system.",
        "The fool-killer, in the meantime, has not been idle. With his old, rusty,\nunloaded musket, he has gathered in enough to make his old heart swell\nwith pride, and to this number he has added many by using “rough on rats,\"\na preparation that never killed anything except those that were\nunfortunate enough to belong to the human family.",
        "Still the fool-killer has missed a good many on account of the great rush\nof business in his line, and I presume that no one has a greater reason to\nbe thankful for this oversight than I have.",
