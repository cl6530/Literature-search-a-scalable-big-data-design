        "Wednesday, Nov. 5th.  The weather was fine during the previous night,\nand we had a clear view of the Magellan Clouds, and of the Southern Cross.\nThe Magellan Clouds consist of three small nebulae in the southern\npart of the heavens,–two bright, like the milky-way, and one dark.\nThese are first seen, just above the horizon, soon after crossing\nthe southern tropic.  When off Cape Horn, they are nearly overhead.\nThe cross is composed of four stars in that form, and is said to be\nthe brightest constellation in the heavens.",
        "During the first part of this day (Wednesday) the wind was light,\nbut after noon it came on fresh, and we furled the royals.  We still\nkept the studding-sails out, and the captain said he should go round\nwith them, if he could.  Just before eight o’clock, (then about sun-down,\nin that latitude,) the cry of “All hands ahoy!” was sounded down\nthe fore scuttle and the after hatchway, and hurrying upon deck,\nwe found a large black cloud rolling on toward us from the south-west,\nand blackening the whole heavens.  “Here comes the Cape Horn!” said\nthe chief mate; and we had hardly time to haul down and clew up,\nbefore it was upon us.  In a few moments, a heavier sea was raised\nthan I had ever seen before, and as it was directly ahead, the little\nbrig, which was no better than a bathing machine, plunged into it,\nand all the forward part of her was under water; the sea pouring in\nthrough the bow-ports and hawse-hole and over the knight-heads,\nthreatening to wash everything overboard.  In the lee scuppers it\nwas up to a man’s waist.  We sprang aloft and double reefed the\ntopsails, and furled all the other sails, and made all snug.\nBut this would not do; the brig was laboring and straining against\nthe head sea, and the gale was growing worse and worse.  At the same\ntime the sleet and hail were driving with all fury against us.\nWe clewed down, and hauled out the reef-tackles again, and close-reefed\nthe fore-topsail, and furled the main, and hove her to on the starboard\ntack.  Here was an end to our fine prospects.  We made up our minds to\nhead winds and cold weather; sent down the royal yards, and unrove\nthe gear, but all the rest of the top hamper remained aloft, even to\nthe sky-sail masts and studding-sail booms.",
        "Throughout the night it stormed violently–rain, hail, snow, and\nsleet beating down upon the vessel–the wind continuing to break ahead,\nand the sea running high.  At daybreak (about three, A.M.) the deck\nwas covered with snow.  The captain sent up the steward with a glass\nof grog to each of the watch; and all the time that we were off the Cape,\ngrog was given to the morning watch, and to all hands whenever we reefed\ntopsails.  The clouds cleared away at sun-rise, and the wind becoming\nmore fair, we again made sail and stood nearly up to our course.",
        "Thursday, Nov. 6th.  It continued more pleasant through the first\npart of the day, but at night we had the same scene over again.\nThis time, we did not heave to, as on the night before, but endeavored\nto beat to windward under close-reefed top-sails, balance-reefed trysail,\nand fore top-mast stay-sail.  This night it was my turn to steer, or,\nas the sailors say, my trick at the helm, for two hours.  Inexperienced\nas I was, I made out to steer to the satisfaction of the officer,\nand neither S––- nor myself gave up our tricks, all the time that\nwe were off the Cape.  This was something to boast of, for it requires\na good deal of skill and watchfulness to steer a vessel close hauled,\nin a gale of wind, against a heavy head sea.  “Ease her when she pitches,\"\nis the word; and a little carelessness in letting her ship a heavy sea,\nmight sweep the decks, or knock masts out of her.",
        "Friday, Nov. 7th.  Towards morning the wind went down, and during\nthe whole forenoon we lay tossing about in a dead calm, and in the\nmidst of a thick fog.  The calms here are unlike those in most parts\nof the world, for there is always such a high sea running, and the\nperiods of calm are so short, that it has no time to go down;\nand vessels, being under no command of sails or rudder, lie like\nlogs upon the water.  We were obliged to steady the booms and yards\nby guys and braces, and to lash everything well below.  We now found\nour top hamper of some use, for though it is liable to be carried\naway or sprung by the sudden “bringing up” of a vessel when pitching\nin a chopping sea, yet it is a great help in steadying a vessel when\nrolling in a long swell; giving it more slowness, ease, and regularity\nto the motion.",
        "The calm of the morning reminds me of a scene which I forgot to\ndescribe at the time of its occurrence, but which I remember from\nits being the first time that I had heard the near breathing of whales.\nIt was on the night that we passed between the Falkland Islands and\nStaten Land.  We had the watch from twelve to four, and coming upon deck,\nfound the little brig lying perfectly still, surrounded by a thick fog,\nand the sea as smooth as though oil had been poured upon it; yet now\nand then a long, low swell rolling over its surface, slightly lifting\nthe vessel, but without breaking the glassy smoothness of the water.\nWe were surrounded far and near by shoals of sluggish whales and\ngrampuses; which the fog prevented our seeing, rising slowly to the\nsurface, or perhaps lying out at length, heaving out those peculiar\nlazy, deep, and long-drawn breathings which give such an impression\nof supineness and strength.  Some of the watch were asleep, and the\nothers were perfectly still, so that there was nothing to break the\nillusion, and I stood leaning over the bulwarks, listening to the\nslow breathing of the mighty creatures–now one breaking the water\njust alongside, whose black body I almost fancied that I could see\nthrough the fog; and again another, which I could just hear in the\ndistance–until the low and regular swell seemed like the heaving\nof the ocean’s mighty bosom to the sound of its heavy and long-drawn\nrespirations.",
        "Towards the evening of this day, (Friday 7th,) the fog cleared off,\nand we had every appearance of a cold blow; and soon after sun-down\nit came on.  Again it was clew up and haul down, reef and furl,\nuntil we had got her down to close-reefed topsails, double-reefed\ntrysail, and reefed forespenser.  Snow, hail, and sleet were driving\nupon us most of the night, and the sea was breaking over the bows\nand covering the forward part of the little vessel; but as she would\nlay her course the captain refused to heave her to.",
        "Saturday, Nov. 8th.  This day commenced with calm and thick fog,\nand ended with hail, snow, a violent wind, and close-reefed topsails.",
        "Sunday, Nov. 9th.  To-day the sun rose clear and continued so until\ntwelve o’clock, when the captain got an observation.  This was very\nwell for Cape Horn, and we thought it a little remarkable that,\nas we had not had one unpleasant Sunday during the whole voyage,\nthe only tolerable day here should be a Sunday.  We got time to\nclear up the steerage and forecastle, and set things to rights,\nand to overhaul our wet clothes a little.  But this did not last\nvery long.  Between five and six–the sun was then nearly three\nhours high–the cry of “All starbowlines ahoy!” summoned our watch\non deck; and immediately all hands were called.  A true specimen\nof Cape Horn was coming upon us.  A great cloud of a dark slate-color\nwas driving on us from the south-west; and we did our best to take\nin sail, (for the light sails had been set during the first part of\nthe day,) before we were in the midst of it.  We had got the light\nsails furled, the courses hauled up, and the topsail reef-tackles\nhauled out, and were just mounting the fore-rigging, when the storm\nstruck us.  In an instant the sea, which had been comparatively quiet,\nwas running higher and higher; and it became almost as dark as night.\nThe hail and sleet were harder than I had yet felt them; seeming to\nalmost pin us down to the rigging.  We were longer taking in sail\nthan ever before; for the sails were stiff and wet, the ropes and\nrigging covered with snow and sleet, and we ourselves cold and nearly\nblinded with the violence of the storm.  By the time we had got down\nupon deck again, the little brig was plunging madly into a tremendous\nhead sea, which at every drive rushed in through the bow-ports and\nover the bows, and buried all the forward part of the vessel.  At this\ninstant the chief mate, who was standing on the top of the windlass,\nat the foot of the spenser mast, called out, “Lay out there and furl\nthe jib!”  This was no agreeable or safe duty, yet it must be done.\nAn old Swede, (the best sailor on board,) who belonged on the forecastle,\nsprang out upon the bowsprit.  Another one must go: I was near the mate,\nand sprang forward, threw the down-haul over the windlass, and jumped\nbetween the knight-heads out upon the bowsprit.  The crew stood abaft\nthe windlass and hauled the jib down, while we got out upon the weather\nside of the jib-boom, our feet on the foot ropes, holding on by the spar,\nthe great jib flying off to leeward and slatting so as almost to throw\nus off of the boom.  For some time we could do nothing but hold on,\nand the vessel diving into two huge seas, one after the other, plunged us\ntwice into the water up to our chins.  We hardly knew whether we were\non or off; when coming up, dripping from the water, we were raised high\ninto the air.  John (that was the sailor’s name) thought the boom\nwould go, every moment, and called out to the mate to keep the vessel\noff, and haul down the staysail; but the fury of the wind and the\nbreaking of the seas against the bows defied every attempt to make\nourselves heard, and we were obliged to do the best we could in our\nsituation.  Fortunately, no other seas so heavy struck her, and we\nsucceeded in furling the jib “after a fashion\"; and, coming in over\nthe staysail nettings, were not a little pleased to find that all\nwas snug, and the watch gone below; for we were soaked through,\nand it was very cold.  The weather continued nearly the same\nthrough the night.",
        "Monday, Nov. 10th.  During a part of this day we were hove to,\nbut the rest of the time were driving on, under close-reefed sails,\nwith a heavy sea, a strong gale, and frequent squalls of hail and snow.",
        "Tuesday, Nov. 11th.  The same.",
        "Wednesday, Nov. 12th.  The same.",
        "Thursday, Nov. 13th.  The same.",
        "We had now got hardened to Cape weather, the vessel was under\nreduced sail, and everything secured on deck and below, so that\nwe had little to do but steer and to stand our watch.  Our clothes\nwere all wet through, and the only change was from wet to more wet.\nIt was in vain to think of reading or working below, for we were\ntoo tired, the hatchways were closed down, and everything was wet\nand uncomfortable, black and dirty, heaving and pitching.  We had\nonly to come below when the watch was out, wring out our wet clothes,\nhang them up, and turn in and sleep as soundly as we could, until the\nwatch was called again.  A sailor can sleep anywhere–no sound of\nwind, water, wood or iron can keep him awake–and we were always\nfast asleep when three blows on the hatchway, and the unwelcome\ncry of “All starbowlines ahoy! eight bells there below! do you\nhear the news?” (the usual formula of calling the watch), roused us\nup from our berths upon the cold, wet decks.  The only time when we\ncould be said to take any pleasure was at night and morning, when we\nwere allowed a tin pot full of hot tea, (or, as the sailors significantly\ncall it, “water bewitched,”) sweetened with molasses.  This, bad as\nit was, was still warm and comforting, and, together with our sea\nbiscuit and cold salt beef, made quite a meal.  Yet even this meal\nwas attended with some uncertainty.  We had to go ourselves to the\ngalley and take our kid of beef and tin pots of tea, and run the\nrisk of losing them before we could get below.  Many a kid of beef\nhave I seen rolling in the scuppers, and the bearer lying at his\nlength on the decks.  I remember an English lad who was always the\nlife of the crew, but whom we afterwards lost overboard, standing for\nnearly ten minutes at the galley, with this pot of tea in his hand,\nwaiting for a chance to get down into the forecastle; and seeing\nwhat he thought was a “smooth spell,” started to go forward.  He had\njust got to the end of the windlass, when a great sea broke over the\nbows, and for a moment I saw nothing of him but his head and shoulders;\nand at the next instant, being taken off of his legs, he was carried\naft with the sea, until her stern lifting up and sending the water\nforward, he was left high and dry at the side of the long-boat,\nstill holding on to his tin pot, which had now nothing in it but\nsalt water.  But nothing could ever daunt him, or overcome, for a\nmoment, his habitual good humor.  Regaining his legs, and shaking\nhis fist at the man at the wheel, he rolled below, saying, as he\npassed, “A man’s no sailor, if he can’t take a joke.”  The ducking\nwas not the worst of such an affair, for, as there was an allowance\nof tea, you could get no more from the galley; and though sailors\nwould never suffer a man to go without, but would always turn in\na little from their own pots to fill up his, yet this was at best\nbut dividing the loss among all hands.",
        "Something of the same kind befell me a few days after.  The cook\nhad just made for us a mess of hot “scouse\"–that is, biscuit pounded\nfine, salt beef cut into small pieces, and a few potatoes, boiled up\ntogether and seasoned with pepper.  This was a rare treat, and I,\nbeing the last at the galley, had it put in my charge to carry down\nfor the mess.  I got along very well as far as the hatchway, and was\njust getting down the steps, when a heavy sea, lifting the stern out\nof water, and passing forward, dropping it down again, threw the steps\nfrom their place, and I came down into the steerage a little faster\nthan I meant to, with the kid on top of me, and the whole precious\nmess scattered over the floor.  Whatever your feelings may be,\nyou must make a joke of everything at sea; and if you were to fall\nfrom aloft and be caught in the belly of a sail, and thus saved\nfrom instant death, it would not do to look at all disturbed,\nor to make a serious matter of it.",
        "Friday, Nov. 14th.  We were now well to the westward of the Cape\nand were changing our course to the northward as much as we dared,\nsince the strong south-west winds, which prevailed then, carried us\nin toward Patagonia.  At two, P.M., we saw a sail on our larboard beam,\nand at four we made it out to be a large ship, steering our course,\nunder single-reefed topsails.  We at that time had shaken the reefs\nout of our topsails, as the wind was lighter, and set the main\ntop-gallant sail.  As soon as our captain saw what sail she was under,\nhe set the fore top-gallant sail and flying jib; and the old whaler–\nfor such, his boats and short sail showed him to be–felt a little\nashamed, and shook the reefs out of his topsails, but could do no more,\nfor he had sent down his top-gallant masts off the Cape.  He ran down\nfor us, and answered our hail as the whale-ship, New England,\nof Poughkeepsie, one hundred and twenty days from New York.\nOur captain gave our name, and added, ninety-two days from Boston.\nThey then had a little conversation about longitude, in which they\nfound that they could not agree.  The ship fell astern, and continued\nin sight during the night.  Toward morning, the wind having become\nlight, we crossed our royal and skysail yards, and at daylight we\nwere seen under a cloud of sail, having royal and skysails fore\nand aft.  The “spouter,” as the sailors call a whaleman, had sent\nup his main top-gallant mast and set the sail, and made signal for\nus to heave to.  About half-past seven their whale-boat came alongside,\nand Captain Job Terry sprang on board, a man known in every port and\nby every vessel in the Pacific ocean.  “Don’t you know Job Terry?\nI thought everybody knew Job Terry,” said a green-hand, who came in\nthe boat, to me, when I asked him about his captain.  He was indeed\na singular man.  He was six feet high, wore thick, cowhide boots,\nand brown coat and trowsers, and, except a sun-burnt complexion,\nhad not the slightest appearance of a sailor; yet he had been forty\nyears in the whale trade, and, as he said himself, had owned ships,\nbuilt ships, and sailed ships.  His boat’s crew were a pretty raw set,\njust out of the bush, and as the sailor’s phrase is, “hadn’t got the\nhayseed out of their hair.”  Captain Terry convinced our captain that\nour reckoning was a little out, and, having spent the day on board,\nput off in his boat at sunset for his ship, which was now six or\neight miles astern.  He began a “yarn” when he came on board,\nwhich lasted, with but little intermission, for four hours.\nIt was all about himself, and the Peruvian government, and the\nDublin frigate, and Lord James Townshend, and President Jackson,\nand the ship Ann M’Kim of Baltimore.  It would probably never have\ncome to an end, had not a good breeze sprung up, which sent him off\nto his own vessel.  One of the lads who came in his boat, a thoroughly\ncountrified-looking fellow, seemed to care very little about the vessel,\nrigging, or anything else, but went round looking at the live stock,\nand leaned over the pig-sty, and said he wished he was back again\ntending his father’s pigs.",
        "At eight o’clock we altered our course to the northward, bound for\nJuan Fernandez.",
        "This day we saw the last of the albatrosses, which had been our\ncompanions a great part of the time off the Cape.  I had been\ninterested in the bird from descriptions which I had read of it,\nand was not at all disappointed.  We caught one or two with a\nbaited hook which we floated astern upon a shingle.  Their long,\nflapping wings, long legs, and large, staring eyes, give them a\nvery peculiar appearance.  They look well on the wing; but one\nof the finest sights that I have ever seen, was an albatross\nasleep upon the water, during a calm, off Cape Horn, when a heavy\nsea was running.  There being no breeze, the surface of the water\nwas unbroken, but a long, heavy swell was rolling, and we saw the\nfellow, all white, directly ahead of us, asleep upon the waves,\nwith his head under his wing; now rising on the top of a huge billow,\nand then falling slowly until he was lost in the hollow between.\nHe was undisturbed for some time, until the noise of our bows,\ngradually approaching, roused him, when, lifting his head, he stared\nupon us for a moment, and then spread his wide wings and took his flight.",
