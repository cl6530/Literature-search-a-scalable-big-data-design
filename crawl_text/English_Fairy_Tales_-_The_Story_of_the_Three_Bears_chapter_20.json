        "Once upon a time there were Three Bears, who lived together in a house\nof their own, in a wood. One of them was a Little, Small Wee Bear; and\none was a Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a Great, Huge Bear.\nThey had each a pot for their porridge, a little pot for the Little,\nSmall, Wee Bear; and a middle-sized pot for the Middle Bear, and a\ngreat pot for the Great, Huge Bear. And they had each a chair to sit\nin; a little chair for the Little, Small, Wee Bear; and a middle-sized\nchair for the Middle Bear; and a great chair for the Great, Huge Bear.\nAnd they had each a bed to sleep in; a little bed for the Little,\nSmall, Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bed for the Middle Bear; and a\ngreat bed for the Great, Huge Bear.",
        "One day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, and\npoured it into their porridge-pots, they walked out into the wood\nwhile the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths,\nby beginning too soon to eat it. And while they were walking, a little\nold Woman came to the house. She could not have been a good, honest\nold Woman; for first she looked in at the window, and then she peeped\nin at the keyhole; and seeing nobody in the house, she lifted the\nlatch. The door was not fastened, because the Bears were good Bears,\nwho did nobody any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm\nthem. So the little old Woman opened the door, and went in; and well\npleased she was when she saw the porridge on the table. If she had\nbeen a good little old Woman, she would have waited till the Bears\ncame home, and then, perhaps, they would have asked her to breakfast;\nfor they were good Bears–a little rough or so, as the manner of\nBears is, but for all that very good-natured and hospitable. But she\nwas an impudent, bad old Woman, and set about helping herself.",
        "So first she tasted the porridge of the Great, Huge Bear, and that was\ntoo hot for her; and she said a bad word about that. And then she\ntasted the porridge of the Middle Bear, and that was too cold for her;\nand she said a bad word about that too. And then she went to the\nporridge of the Little, Small, Wee Bear, and tasted that; and that was\nneither too hot, nor too cold, but just right; and she liked it so\nwell, that she ate it all up: but the naughty old Woman said a bad\nword about the little porridge-pot, because it did not hold enough for\nher.",
        "Then the little old Woman sate down in the chair of the Great, Huge\nBear, and that was too hard for her. And then she sate down in the\nchair of the Middle Bear, and that was too soft for her. And then she\nsate down in the chair of the Little, Small, Wee Bear, and that was\nneither too hard, nor too soft, but just right. So she seated herself\nin it, and there she sate till the bottom of the chair came out, and\ndown she came, plump upon the ground. And the naughty old Woman said a\nwicked word about that too.",
        "Then the little old Woman went upstairs into the bed-chamber in which\nthe three Bears slept. And first she lay down upon the bed of the\nGreat, Huge Bear; but that was too high at the head for her. And next\nshe lay down upon the bed of the Middle Bear; and that was too high at\nthe foot for her. And then she lay down upon the bed of the Little,\nSmall, Wee Bear; and that was neither too high at the head, nor at the\nfoot, but just right. So she covered herself up comfortably, and lay\nthere till she fell fast asleep.",
        "By this time the Three Bears thought their porridge would be cool\nenough; so they came home to breakfast. Now the little old Woman had\nleft the spoon of the Great, Huge Bear, standing in his porridge.",
        "“Somebody has been at my porridge!”",
        "said the Great, Huge Bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice. And when\nthe Middle Bear looked at his, he saw that the spoon was standing in\nit too. They were wooden spoons; if they had been silver ones, the\nnaughty old Woman would have put them in her pocket.",
        "“Somebody has been at my porridge!”",
        "said the Middle Bear in his middle voice.",
        "Then the Little, Small, Wee Bear looked at his, and there was the\nspoon in the porridge-pot, but the porridge was all gone.",
        "“Somebody has been at my porridge, and has eaten it all up!”",
        "said the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his little, small, wee voice.",
        "Upon this the Three Bears, seeing that some one had entered their\nhouse, and eaten up the Little, Small, Wee Bear’s breakfast, began to\nlook about them. Now the little old Woman had not put the hard cushion\nstraight when she rose from the chair of the Great, Huge Bear.",
        "“Somebody has been sitting in my chair!”",
        "said the Great, Huge Bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice.",
        "And the little old Woman had squatted down the soft cushion of the\nMiddle Bear.",
        "“Somebody has been sitting in my chair!”",
        "said the Middle Bear, in his middle voice.",
        "And you know what the little old Woman had done to the third chair.",
        "“Somebody has been sitting in my chair and has sate the bottom out of\nit!”",
        "said the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his little, small, wee voice.",
        "Then the Three Bears thought it necessary that they should make\nfarther search; so they went upstairs into their bedchamber. Now the\nlittle old Woman had pulled the pillow of the Great, Huge Bear, out of\nits place.",
        "“Somebody has been lying in my bed!”",
        "said the Great, Huge Bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice.",
        "And the little old Woman had pulled the bolster of the Middle Bear out\nof its place.",
        "“Somebody has been lying in my bed!”",
        "said the Middle Bear, in his middle voice.",
        "And when the Little, Small, Wee Bear came to look at his bed, there\nwas the bolster in its place; and the pillow in its place upon the\nbolster; and upon the pillow was the little old Woman’s ugly, dirty\nhead,–which was not in its place, for she had no business there.",
        "“Somebody has been lying in my bed,–and here she is!”",
        "said the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his little, small, wee voice.",
        "The little old Woman had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruff\nvoice of the Great, Huge Bear; but she was so fast asleep that it was\nno more to her than the roaring of wind, or the rumbling of thunder.\nAnd she had heard the middle voice, of the Middle Bear, but it was\nonly as if she had heard some one speaking in a dream. But when she\nheard the little, small, wee voice of the Little, Small, Wee Bear, it\nwas so sharp, and so shrill, that it awakened her at once. Up she\nstarted; and when she saw the Three Bears on one side of the bed, she\ntumbled herself out at the other, and ran to the window. Now the\nwindow was open, because the Bears, like good, tidy Bears, as they\nwere, always opened their bedchamber window when they got up in the\nmorning. Out the little old Woman jumped; and whether she broke her\nneck in the fall; or ran into the wood and was lost there; or found\nher way out of the wood, and was taken up by the constable and sent to\nthe House of Correction for a vagrant as she was, I cannot tell. But\nthe Three Bears never saw anything more of her.",
