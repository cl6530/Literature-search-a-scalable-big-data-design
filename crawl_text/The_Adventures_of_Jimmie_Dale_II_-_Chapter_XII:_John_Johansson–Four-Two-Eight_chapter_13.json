        "Nearly midnight already!  It was even later than he had thought.\nLarry the Bat pressed his face against a shop’s windowpane on the\nBowery for a glance at a clock that had caught his eye on the wall\nwithin.  Nearly midnight!",
        "He slouched on again hurriedly, still debating in his mind, as he\nhad been debating it all the way from the Tocsin’s, the question of\nreturning again to the Sanctuary.  So far, the way both to Spider\nJack’s and the Sanctuary had been in the same direction–but the\nSanctuary was on the next street.",
        "Jimmie Dale reached the corner–and hesitated.  It was strange how\nstrong was the intuition upon him to-night that bade him go on and\nmake all speed to Spider Jack’s–while equally strong was the cold,\nstubborn logic that bade him go first to the Sanctuary.  There were\nthings that he needed there that would probably be absolutely\nessential to him before the night was out, things without which he\nmight be so badly handicapped as to invite failure from the start;\nand yet–it was already midnight!",
        "Ostensibly both Makoff and Spider Jack closed their places at\neleven.  But that might mean anything–depending upon their own\nrespective inclinations, or on what of their own peculiar brand of\ndeviltry might be afoot.  If they were still about, still in\nevidence, he was still too early, midnight though it was; though, on\nthe other hand, if the coast was clear, he could ill afford to lose\na moment of the time between now and the hour that the Magpie had\nplanned for the robbery of Henry LaSalle, for it would not be an\neasy matter, even once inside Spider Jack’s, to find that package–\nsince it was Spider’s open boast that things committed to his care\nwere where the police, or any one else, might as well whistle and\nsuck their thumbs as try to find them!",
        "And then, with sudden decision, taking his hesitation, as it were,\nby the throat, Jimmie Dale hurried on again–to the Sanctuary.  At\nmost, it could delay him but another fifteen minutes, and by half-\npast twelve, or a quarter to one at the latest, he would be at\nSpider Jack’s.",
        "Disdaining the secrecy of the side door on the alley, for who had a\nbetter right or was better known there than Larry the Bat, a tenant\nof years, he entered the tenement by the front door, scuffled up the\nstairs to the first landing, and let himself into his disreputable\nroom.  He locked the door behind him, lighted the choked and wheezy\ngas jet, in a single, sharp-flung glance assured himself that the\nblinds were tightly shut, and, kneeling in the far corner, threw\nback the oilcloth and lifted up the loose section of the flooring\nbeneath.  He reached inside, fumbling under the neatly folded\nclothes of Jimmie Dale, and in a moment laid his leather girdle with\nits kit of burglar’s tools on the floor beside him; and beside that\nagain an electric flashlight, a black silk mask, and–what he had\nnever expected to use again when, early the night before, he had, as\nhe had believed, put it away forever–the thin, metal insignia case\nof the Gray Seal.  Another moment, and, with the flooring replaced,\nthe oilcloth rolled back into position, he had stripped off his coat\nand was pulling his spotted, greasy shirt off over his head; then,\nstooping quickly, he picked up the girdle, put it on, put on his\nshirt again over it, put on his coat, put the metal case, the\nflashlight, and the mask in his pockets–and once more the Sanctuary\nwas in darkness.",
        "It was perhaps fifteen minutes later that Jimmie Dale turned into\nthe upper section of Thompson Street.  Here he slowed his pace, that\nhad been almost a run since he had left the Sanctuary, and began to\nshuffle leisurely along; for the street, that a few hours before\nwould have been choked with its pushcarts and venders, its half\nnaked children playing where they could find room in the gutters,\nits sidewalks thronged with shawled women and picturesquely dressed,\nearringed, dark-visaged men, a scene, as it were, transported from\nsome foreign land, was still far from deserted; the quiet, if quiet\nit could be called, was but comparative, there were many yet about,\nand he had no desire to attract attention by any evidence of undue\nhaste.  And, besides, Spider Jack’s was just ahead, making the\ncorner of the alleyway a few hundred feet farther on, and he had\nvery good reasons for desiring to approach Spider’s little novelty\nstore at a pace that would afford him every opportunity for\nobservation.",
        "On he shuffled along the street, until, reaching Spider Jack’s, a\nlittle two-storied, tumble-down brick structure, a muttered\nexclamation of satisfaction escaped him.  The shop was closed and\ndark; and, though Spider Jack lived above the store, there were no\nlights even in the upper windows.  Spider Jack presumably was either\nout, or in bed!  So far, then, he could have asked for nothing more.",
        "Jimmie Dale edged in close to the building as he slouched by, so\nclose that his hat brim seemed to touch the windowpane.  It was\npossible that from a room at the rear of the store there might be a\nlight with a telltale ray perhaps filtering through, say, a door\ncrack.  But there was nothing–only blackness within.",
        "He paused at the corner of the building by the alleyway.  Down here,\nadjoining the high board fence of Spider Jack’s back yard, Makoff\nmade pretense at pawnbrokering in a small and dingy wooden building,\nthat was little more pretentious than a shed–and in Makoff’s place,\nso far as he could see, there was no light, either.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s fingers were industriously rolling a cigarette, as,\nunder the brim of his slouch hat, his eyes were noting every detail\naround him.  A yard in against the wall of Spider Jack’s, the wall\ncutting off the rays of the street lamp at a sharp angle, it was\nshadowy and black–and beyond that, farther in, the alleyway was\nlike a pit.  It would take less, far less, than the fraction of a\nsecond to gain that yard, but some one was approaching behind him,\nand a little group of people loitered, with annoying persistency,\ndirectly across the way on the other side of the street.  Jimmie\nDale stuck the cigarette between his lips, fumbled in his pockets,\nand finally produced a box of matches.  The group opposite was\nmoving on now; the footsteps he had heard behind him, those of a\nman, drew nearer, the man passed by–and the box of matches in\nJimmie Dale’s hand dropped to the ground.  He reached to pick them\nup, and in his stooping posture, without seeming to turn his head,\nflung a quick glance behind him up the street.  No one, for that\nfraction of a second that he needed, was near enough to see–and in\nthat fraction of a second Jimmie Dale disappeared.",
        "A dozen yards down the lane, he sprang for the top of the high\nfence, gripped it, and, lithe and active as a cat, swung himself up\nand over, and dropped noiselessly to the ground on the other side.\nHere he stood motionless for a moment, close against the fence, to\nget his bearings.  The rear of Spider Jack’s building loomed up\nbefore him–the back windows as unlighted as those in front.  Luck\nso far, at least, was with him!  He turned and looked about him,\nand, his eyes growing accustomed to the darkness, he could just make\nout Makoff’s place, bordering the end of the yard–nor, from this\nnew vantage point, could he discover, any more than before, a single\nsign of life about the pawnbroker’s establishment.",
        "Jimmie Dale stole forward across the yard, mounted the three steps\nof the low stoop at Spider Jack’s back door, and tried the door\ncautiously.  It was locked.  From his pocket came the small steel\ninstrument that had stood Larry the Bat in good stead a hundred\ntimes before in similar circumstances.  He inserted it in the\nkeyhole, worked deftly with it for an instant–and tried the door\nagain.  It was still locked.  And then Jimmie Dale smiled almost\napologetically.  Spider Jack did not use ordinary locks on his back\ndoor!",
        "The discountenanced instrument went back into his pocket, and now\nJimmie Dale’s hand slipped inside his shirt, and from one of the\nlittle, upright pockets of the leather belt, and from still another,\nand from after that a third, came the vicious little blued-steel\ntools.  The sensitive fingers travelled slowly up and down the side\nof the door–and then he was at work in earnest.  A minute passed–\nanother–there was a dull, low, grating sound, a snick as of metal\nyielding suddenly–and Jimmie Dale was coolly stowing away his tools\nagain inside his shirt.",
        "He pushed the door open an inch, listened, then swung it wide,\nstepped inside, and closed it behind him.  A round, white beam of\nlight flashed in a quick circle–and went out.  It was a sort of\nstoreroom, innocent enough and orderly enough in appearance, bare-\nfloored, with boxes and packing cases piled neatly against the\nwalls.  In one corner a staircase led to the story above–and from\nabove, quite audibly now, he caught the sound of snoring.  Spider\nJack was in bed, then!",
        "Directly facing him was the open door of another room, and Jimmie\nDale, moving softly forward, entered it.  He had never been in\nSpider Jack’s before, and his first concern was to form an intimate\nacquaintanceship with his surroundings.  Again the flashlight\ncircled, and again went out.",
        "“No windows!” muttered Jimmie Dale under his breath.  “Nothing very\nfancy about the architecture!  Three rooms in a row!  Store in front\nof this room through that door of course.  Wonder if the door’s\nlocked, though it’s a foregone conclusion the package wouldn’t be in\nthere.”",
        "Not a sound, his tread silent, he crossed to the closed door that he\nhad noticed.  It was unlocked, and he opened it tentatively a little\nway.  A faint glow of light diffused itself through the opening.\nJimmie Dale nodded his head and closed the door again.  The street\nlamp, shining through the shop windows, accounted for the light.",
        "And now the flashlight played with steady inquisitiveness about him.\nThe room in which he stood seemed to combine a sort of office, with\na lounging room, in which Spider Jack, no doubt, entertained his\nparticular cronies.  There was table in the centre, cards still upon\nit, chairs about it.  Against the wall farthest away from the shop\nstood a huge, old-fashioned cabinet; and a little farther along,\nanglewise, partitioning off the corner, as it were, hung, for some\npurpose or other, a cretonne curtain.  Also, against the wall next\nto the lane, bringing a commiserating smile to Jimmie Dale’s lips as\nhis eyes fell upon it, was a clumsy, lumbering, antique safe.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s eyes returned to the curtain.  What was it doing\nthere?  What was it for?  Instinctively he stepped over to examine\nit.  A single glance, however, as he lifted it aside, sufficed.  It\nwas nothing but a make-shift clothes closet.  He turned from it,\nswitched off the flashlight, and stood staring meditatively into the\ndarkness.  In a strange house, with the knowledge to begin with that\nwhat he sought was carefully hidden, it was no sinecure to find that\npackage.  He had never for a moment imagined that it would be.  But\nof one thing, however, there was no uncertainty in his mind–he\nwould get the package!–by search if possible, by other means if\nsearch failed.  It was now close to one o’clock.  If by two o’clock\nhis efforts had been fruitless, Spider Jack would hand over the\npackage–at the revolver point!  It was quite simple!  Meanwhile–\nJimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders, and, going over to the safe,\nknelt down in front of it–meanwhile, as well begin here as anywhere\nelse.",
        "The trained fingers closed on the handle–and on the instant, as\nthough in startled amazement, shifted to the dial.  They came back\nto the handle–a wrench–then a low, amused chuckle–and the door\nswung open.  The great, unwieldy thing was only a monumental bluff!\nIt not only had not been locked, but it COULD NOT be locked–the\nmechanism was out of order, the bolts could not be moved by so much\nas a hair’s breadth!",
        "Still chuckling, Jimmie Dale shot the flashlight’s ray into the\ninterior of the safe–and the chuckle died on his lips, and into his\nface came a look of strained bewilderment.  Inside, everything was\nin chaos, books, papers, a miscellany of articles, as though they\nhad first been ruthlessly pulled out on the floor, then gathered up\nin an armful and crammed back inside again.  For an instant he did\nnot move, and then a queer, hard, mirthless smile drew down the\ncorners of his mouth.  With a sort of bitter, expectant nod of his\nhead, he turned the light upon the door of the safe.  Yes, there\nwere the scratches that the tools had left; and, as though in\nsardonic jest, the holes, where the steel bit had bored, were\nplugged with putty and rubbed over with some black substance that\nwas still wet and came off, smearing his finger, as he touched it.\nIt could not have been done long ago, then!  How long?  A half hour–\nan hour?  Not more than that!",
        "Mechanically he closed the door of the safe, rose to his feet and,\nalmost heedless of noise now, the flashlight ray dancing before him,\nhe jumped across to the old-fashioned cabinet and pulled the door\nopen.  Here, as within the safe, all inside, plain evidence of\nthorough, if hasty, search, was scattered and tossed about in\nhopeless confusion.",
        "He shut the cabinet door; the flashlight went out; and he stood like\na man stunned, the sense of some abysmal disaster upon him.  He was\ntoo late!  The game was up!  If it had ever been here, the package\nwas gone now–GONE!  The Crime Club had been here before him!",
        "“The game was up!  The game was up!\"–his mind seemed to keep on\nrepeating that.  The Crime Club had beaten him by an hour, at most,\nand had been here, and had searched.  It was strange, though, that\nthey should have been at such curious pains to cover their tracks by\nleaving the room in order, by such paltry efforts to make the safe\nappear untouched when the first glance that was at all critical\nwould disclose immediately what had been done!  Why should they need\nto cover their tracks at all; or, if it was necessary, why, above\nall, in such a pitifully inadequate way!  His mind barked back to\nthe same ghastly refrain–\"the game was up!”",
        "NO!  Not yet!  There was still a chance!  There was still Spider\nJack!  Suppose, in spite of their search, they had failed to find\nthe package!  Jimmie Dale’s lips set in a thin line, as he started\nabruptly toward the door.  There was still that chance, and one\nthing was grimly certain–Spider Jack would, at least, show him\nwhere the package HAD BEEN!",
        "And then, halfway to the door, he halted suddenly, and stood still–\nlistening.  An electric bell was ringing loudly, imperiously,\nsomewhere upstairs.  Followed almost immediately the sound of some\none, Spider Jack presumably, moving hurriedly about overhead; and\nthen, a moment later, steps coming down the staircase in the\nadjoining room.",
        "Jimmie Dale drew back, flattening himself against the wall.  Spider\nJack entered the room, stumbled across it, in the darkness, fumbled\nfor the door that led into his little shop, opened it, passed\nthrough, fumbled around in there again, for matches evidently, then\nlighted a gas jet in the store, and, going to the street door,\nopened it.",
        "Jimmie Dale had edged along the wall a little to a position where he\nhad an unobstructed view through the open doorway connecting the\nshop and the room in which he stood.  Spider Jack, in trousers and\nshirt, hastily donned, no doubt, as he had got out of bed, was\nstanding in the street doorway, and beyond him loomed the forms of\nseveral men.  Spider Jack stepped aside to allow his visitors to\nenter–and suddenly, a cry barely suppressed upon his lips, Jimmie\nDale involuntarily strained forward.  Three men had entered, but his\neyes were fixed, fascinated, upon only one–the first of the three.\nWas it an hallucination?  Was he mad–-dreaming?  It was Hilton\nTravers, THE CHAUFFEUR–the man whom he could have sworn he had last\nseen dead, lashed in that chair, in that ghastly death chamber of\nthe Crime Club!",
        "“Rather rough on you, Spider, to pull you out of bed at this hour,\"\nthe chauffeur was saying apologetically.",
        "“Oh, that’s all right, seein’ it’s you, Travers,” Spider Jack\nanswered, gruffly amiable.  “Only I was kind of lookin’ for you last\nnight.”",
        "“I know,” the chauffeur replied; “but I couldn’t connect with my\nfriends here.  Shake hands with them, Spider–Bob Marvin–Harry\nStead.”",
        "“Glad to know you, gents,” said Spider Jack, with a handgrip apiece.",
        "The chauffeur lowered his voice a little.",
        "“I suppose we’re alone here, eh, Spider?  Yes?  Well, then, you know\nwhat I’ve come for–that package–Marvin and Stead, here, are the\nones that are in on it with me.  Get it for me, will you, Spider?”",
        "“Sure–Mr. Johansson!” Spider grinned.  “Sure!  Come on into the\nback room and make yourselves comfortable.  I’ll be mabbe five\nminutes, or so.”",
        "Jimmie Dale’s brain was whirling.  What did it mean?  He could not\nseem to understand.  His mind seemed to refuse its functions.\nTravers, the chauffeur–ALIVE!  He drew in his breath sharply.  That\ncurtain in the corner!  He must see this out now!  They were coming!\nQuick, noiseless, he stole along the side of the wall, reached the\ncorner, and slipped in behind the curtain, as Spider Jack, striking\na match, entered the room.",
        "Spider Jack lighted the gas, and, as the others followed behind him,\nwaved them toward the chairs around the table.",
        "“I’ll just ask you gents not to leave the room,” he said meaningly,\nover his shoulder, as he stepped toward the rear door.  “It’s kind\nof a fad of mine to keep some things even from my wife!”",
        "“All right, Spider–I understand,” the chauffeur returned readily.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s knife cut a tiny slit in the cretonne on a level with\nhis eyes.  The three men had seated themselves at the table, and\nappeared to be listening intently.  Spider Jack’s footsteps echoed\nback as he crossed the rear room, sounded dull and muffled\ndescending the stoop outside, and died away.",
        "“I told you it wasn’t in the house!” the man who had been introduced\nas Stead laughed shortly.  “We wasted the hour we had here.”",
        "The third man spoke crisply, incisively, to the chauffeur.",
        "“Turn down that gas jet a little!  You’ve got across with it so far–\nbut you can’t stand a searchlight, Clarke!",
        "And at the words, in a flash, the meaning of it, all of it, to the\nlast detail that was spelling death, ruin, and disaster for her, the\nTocsin, for himself as well, burst upon Jimmie Dale.  That VOICE!\nHe would have known it, recognised it, among a thousand–it was the\nmasked man of the night before, the leader, the head of the Crime\nClub!  And it was not Travers there at all!  He remembered now, too\nwell, that second room they had showed him in the Crime Club–its\nmultitude of disguises, though in this case they had the dead man’s\nclothes ready to their hands–the leader’s boast that impersonation\nwas but child’s play to them!  And now he understood why they had\ncovered up the traces of their search in only so curiously\ninadequate a manner.  They had failed to find the package, and, as a\nlast resort, had adopted the ruse of impersonating Hilton Travers,\nthe chauffeur, which made it necessary that when they called Spider\nJack from his bed, as they had just done, that Spider Jack, at a\nCASUAL glance, should notice nothing amiss–but it would be no more\nthan a casual glance, for, who should know better than they, he\nwould not have to go for the package to any place that they had\ndisturbed!  And he, Jimmie Dale, could only stand here and watch\nthem, helpless, powerless to move!  Three of them!  A step out into\nthe room was to invite certain death.  It would not matter, his\ndeath–if he could gain anything for her, for the Tocsin, by it.\nBut what could he gain–by dying?  He clenched his hands until the\nnails bit into the flesh.",
        "Spider Jack re-entered the room, carrying what looked like a large,\nbulky, manila envelope, heavily sealed, in his hand.  He tossed it\non the table.",
        "“There you are, Travers!” he said.",
        "“I wonder,” suggested the leader pleasantly, “if, now that we’re\nhere, Travers, your friend would mind letting us have this room for\na few minutes to ourselves to clean up the business?”",
        "“Sure!” agreed Spider Jack cordially.  “You’re welcome to it!  I’ll\nwait out here in the store until you say the word.”",
        "He went out, closing the door after him.  The leader picked up the\npackage.",
        "“We’ll take no chances with this,” he said grimly.  “It’s been too\nclose a call.  After we’ve had a look at it, we’ll put it out of\nharm’s way on the spot, here, while we’ve got it–before we leave!”",
        "He ripped the package open, and disclosed perhaps a dozen official-\nlooking documents, besides a miscellaneous number of others.  He\ntook up the first of the papers, glanced through it hurriedly, then\ntossed it to the pseudo chauffeur.",
        "“Tear it up, and tear it up–SMALL!” he ordered tersely.  The next,\nafter examining it as he had the first, he tossed to the other man.\n“Go ahead!\"–curtly.  “Work fast!  From the looks of these, Travers\nhad us cold!  There’s proof enough here of LaSalle’s murder to send\nus all to the chair!”",
        "He went on glancing through the documents; and then suddenly,\njoining the others in their work, began to rip and tear at the\npapers himself.",
        "A sort of cold horror had settled upon Jimmie Dale, and his forehead\nwas clammy wet.  The inhuman irony of it!  That he should stand\nthere and watch, impotent to prevent it, the destruction of what he\nwould have given his life to secure!  And then slowly, a grim, hard,\nmerciless smile came to his lips.  He had recognised the leader’s\nvoice–now he would recognise the leader’s FACE.  At least, that was\nleft to him–perhaps the master trump of all.  It would not be very\nhard to find the Crime Club now–with that man to lead the way!",
        "The scraps of paper, tiny shreds, mounted into a heap on the table–\nand with the last of the contents of the package destroyed, the\nleader stood up.",
        "“Put these pieces in your pockets; we don’t want to leave them\nhere,” he directed quietly.  “And then let’s get out.”",
        "In scarcely a moment, the last scrap of paper had vanished.  The\nthree men walked to the door, passed through it, and joined Spider\nJack in the store–and Jimmie Dale, slipping out from behind the\ncurtain, gained the door of the rear room, crept through it, reached\nthe stoop, and then, darting like the wind across the yard, was over\nthe fence in a second, and in another was out of the alleyway and on\nthe street.",
        "He was in time–in plenty of time.  They had just left Spider\nJack’s, and were, perhaps, fifty yards or so ahead of him.  He\nslouched on behind them–the cold, grim smile on his lips once more.\nIt was the Crime Club now, that hell’s cradle where their devil’s\nschemes were hatched, that was the one thing left to him; they would\nlead him to that, and then–and then it would be his turn to STRIKE!",
        "They turned the first corner.  And suddenly, as the racing engine of\nan automobile caught his ear, he broke into a run, and dashed around\nthe corner after them–in time to see them jump into a car, and the\ncar speed off along the street!  He halted, as though he were\nsuddenly dazed–started involuntarily to run forward again–stopped\nwith a hollow laugh at the futility of it–and stood still and\nmotionless on the sidewalk.",
        "And then he swayed a little, and his face grew gray.  Failure,\ndefeat, ruin–in that moment he knew them all to their bitterest\ndregs.  How could he go to her!  How could he face her, and tell her\nthat they were beaten, that the last hope was gone, that he had\nfailed!",
        "“God!” he cried aloud, and clenched his hands.",
        "Then deep in his consciousness a thought stirred, and he swept a\nshaking hand across his eyes.  Why had it come again, that thought!\nDid it mean that HE must play–the last card!  There was a way–\nthere had always been a way.  The way the Crime Club took–MURDER.\nIt was their own weapon!  If the man who posed as Henry LaSalle were\nkilled!  If that man–were killed!",
        "“The Magpie was to be there at three!” he muttered–and started\nmechanically back along the street.",
