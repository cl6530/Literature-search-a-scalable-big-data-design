        "And so another two weeks passed. Then, one day, a comet of amazing\nbrilliancy shot suddenly into our social orbit, and things happened.\nThat this interesting stellar phenomenon was a Russian grand duke, a\nnephew of the Czar, but added to the piquancy of the situation.",
        "The hotel was all in a flutter; the manager was beside himself with\njoy; bell-boys danced jig steps in the corridors; chambermaids went\nabout with a distracted air—and all because the grand duke,\nAlexander Melovich, was to arrive on the morrow. It was an epoch-\nmaking event. It was better than a circus, for it was free. Copies\nof the Almanach de Gotha appeared, as if by magic. Everybody was\ninterested. Everybody was charmed, until—",
        "The rumor flew rapidly along the verandas. It was denied by the head\nwaiter, it was confirmed by the chief clerk; it was referred to the\nmanager himself and again confirmed. Alas, it was true! The Grand\nDuke Alexander was coming, not to honor the hotel, but to honor Mrs.\nCarmichael Porter; she would receive him as her guest, she would pay\nthe royal hotel bill, she would pay the bills of the royal suite.\nYes, Blakely’s mother had captured the grand duke.",
        "A wave of indignation swept the columns of the rank and file. They\ndidn’t want the grand duke themselves, but they didn’t want\nBlakely’s mother to have him; Blakely’s mother and Mrs. Sanderson-\nSpear, and Mrs. Tudor Carstairs. In a way, it was better than a\ncomic opera; it was fearfully amusing.",
        "The grand duke, accompanied, according to the newspapers, “by the\nRoyal Suite and the Choicest Flower of San Francisco Society,\"\narrived on a special train direct from Del Monte. Having captured a\ngrand duke, these “Choicest Flowers” (ten in number) were loath to\nlose him, so they accompanied him. They did more; they paid for the\nspecial train. Blakely’s mother greeted them, one and all, in a most\nfriendly manner. There was an aristocratic air about the whole\nproceeding that was distinctly uplifting.",
        "And now began a round of gaieties, the first being a tea were real\nRussian samovars were in evidence, and sandwiches of real Russian\ncaviar were served. Real Russian cigarettes were smoked, real\nRussian vodka was sipped; the Czar’s health was drunk; no bombs were\nthrown, no bonds were offered for sale, the Russian loan was not\ndiscussed; the Japanese servants were not present, having been given\na half holiday. Oh, it was a little triumph, that tea! Blakely’s\nmother was showered with congratulations. The “Choicest Flowers\"\nvied with one another in assurances of their distinguished approval.",
        "Indeed, they were all crazy about it—except the grand duke. Blakely\nsaid the grand duke was bored to death, and that he had led him off\nto the bar and given him a whisky-and-soda out of sheer pity. From\nthat time on the duke stuck to him like a postage stamp, so that\nBlakely had an awful time escaping that night to dine with Dad and\nme. He told us all about the tea at dinner, and I was surprised to\nlearn (I hadn’t seen him yet) that the duke was just Blakely’s age,\nand, as Blakely put it, “a very decent sort.” Not that there is any\nreason why a grand duke shouldn’t be a decent sort, but Rumor was\nbusy just then proclaiming that this particular grand duke was a\nperfect pig.",
        "The next day I had a chance to judge for myself. It seems the duke\nnoticed me as I got into my automobile for my morning ride, and\nafter finding out who I was, sent for Blakely and demanded that I be\npresented to him.",
        "Blakely was awfully angry. He said: “Look here, I don’t know what\nyou’ve been used to, but in this country, where a man wishes to meet\na young lady, he asks to be presented to her. Not only that, but he\ndoesn’t take it for granted that she’ll be honored by the request.\nMiss Middleton is my fiancee. I don’t know whether she cares to meet\nyou or not. If she does, I’ll let you know.” The duke was terribly\nmortified. He apologized beautifully.",
        "Then Blakely apologized for getting angry, and they became better\nfriends than ever, with the result that the duke was presented to me\nthat very afternoon.",
        "The Grand Duke Alexander was short and fat and fair, with a yellow\nmustache of the Kaiser Wilhelm variety. It was rather a shock to me,\nfor I had expected a dashing black-haired person with flashing eyes\nand a commanding presence. No, he wasn’t at all my idea of what a\ngrand duke should look like; he looked much more like a little\nbrother to the ox (a well-bred, well-dressed, bath-loving little\nbrother, of course) than a member of an imperial family. Not that he\ndidn’t have his points: he had nice hands and nice feet, and his\nsmile was charming.",
        "You should have seen his face light up when he found I spoke French.\nThe poor fellow wasn’t a bit at home in the English language and the\neagerness with which he plunged into French was really pathetic.\nLuckily, Blakely spoke French, too—not very well, but he understood\nit lots better than he spoke it—so we three spent a pleasant hour\ntogether on the veranda. Of course, in a way, it was a little\ntriumph for me; the women whom Blakely’s mother had snubbed enjoyed\nthe sight immensely, and when she appeared, accompanied by Mrs.\nSanderson-Spear and some of the “Choicest Flowers,” and saw what was\nhappening to her duke, she was too angry for words. Heavens, how\nthat woman did hate me that afternoon!",
        "The next morning six more “Choicest Flowers” arrived from San\nFrancisco (rare orchids whose grandfathers had come over from\nIreland in the steerage). The third son of an English baronet who\nowned a chicken-ranch near Los Angeles and a German count who sold\nRhine wines to the best families also appeared; for that night\nBlakely’s mother was to give such a dinner as had never before been\ngiven in Santa Barbara.",
        "Under the heading:",
        "SANTA BARBARA NOW THE MOST COSMOPOLITAN CITY IN AMERICA",
        "an enterprising Los Angeles newspaper devoted a whole page to the\ncoming event. Adjective was piled on adjective, split infinitive on\nsplit infinitive. The dinner was to be given in the ballroom of the\nhotel.... The bank accounts of the assembled guests would total\n$4oo,ooo,ooo.... The terrapin had been specially imported from\nBaltimore.... The decorations were to be magnificent beyond the\nwildest dream.... The duke was to sit on the right of his\nhostess.... Mr. Sanderson-Spear, the Pierpont Morgan of\nPennsylvania, who would arrive that morning from Pittsburg in his\nprivate car, would sit on her left.... Count Boris Beljaski,\nintimate friend and traveling companion of the grand duke, would\nappear in the uniform of the imperial guard.... The Baroness\nReinstadt was hurrying from San Diego, in her automobile.... As a\nwinter resort, Santa Barbara was, as usual, eclipsing Florida,\netc.,... Blakely and I read the paper together; we laughed over it\ntill we cried.",
        "“It would be lots funnier if it wasn’t my mother who was making such\na holy show of herself,” Blakely said. “Do you know, my dear—”",
        "He was silent for a moment. When he did speak, there was a wicked\ngleam in his eyes. “By Jove,” he cried, “I’ll do it!”",
        "“Do what?” I asked.",
        "“Oh, nothing much. I’ll tell you all about it later—if there’s\nanything to tell. Now I must run away. Good-by, dear.”",
