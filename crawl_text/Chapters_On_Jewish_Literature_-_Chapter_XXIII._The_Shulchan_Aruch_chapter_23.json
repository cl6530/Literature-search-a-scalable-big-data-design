        "The religious literature of the Jews, so far as practical life was\nconcerned, culminated in the publication of the “Table Prepared\"\n(Shulchan Aruch), in 1565. The first book of its kind compiled after\nthe invention of printing, the Shulchan Aruch obtained a popularity\ndenied to all previous works designed to present a digest of Jewish\nethics and ritual observances. It in no sense superseded the “Strong\nHand” of Maimonides, but it was so much more practical in its scope, so\nmuch clearer as a work of general reference, so much fuller of\nMinhag, or established custom, that it speedily became the universal\nhand-book of Jewish life in many of its phases. It was not accepted in\nall its parts, and its blemishes were clearly perceived. The author,\nJoseph Karo, was too tender to the past, and admitted some things which\nhad a historical justification, but which Karo himself would have been\nthe first to reject as principles of conduct for his own or later times.\nOn the whole, the book was a worthy summary of the fundamental Jewish\nview, that religion is co-extensive with life, and that everything worth\ndoing at all ought to be done in accordance with a general principle of\nobedience to the divine will. The defects of such a view are the defects\nof its qualities.",
        "The Shulchan Aruch was the outcome of centuries of scholarship. It was\noriginal, yet it was completely based on previous works. In particular\nthe “Four Rows” (Arbäa Turim) of Jacob Asheri (1283-1340) was one of\nthe main sources of Karo’s work. The “Four Rows,” again, owed everything\nto Jacob’s father, Asher, the son of Yechiel, who migrated from Germany\nto Toledo at the very beginning of the fourteenth century. But besides\nthe systematic codes of his predecessors, Karo was able to draw on a\nvast mass of literature on the Talmud and on Jewish Law, accumulated in\nthe course of centuries.",
        "There was, in the first place, a large collection of “Novelties\"\n(Chiddushim), or Notes on the Talmud, by various authorities. More\nsignificant, however, were the “Responses” (Teshuboth), which\nresembled those of the Gaonim referred to in an earlier chapter. The\nRabbinical Correspondence, in the form of Responses to Questions sent\nfrom far and near, covered the whole field of secular and religious\nknowledge. The style of these “Responses” was at first simple, terse,\nand full of actuality. The most famous representatives of this form of\nliterature after the Gaonim were both of the thirteenth century,\nSolomon, the son of Adereth, in Spain, and Meir of Rothenburg in\nGermany. Solomon, the son of Adereth, of Barcelona, was a man whose\nmoral earnestness, mild yet firm disposition, profound erudition, and\ntolerant character, won for him a supreme place in Jewish life for half\na century. Meir of Rothenburg was a poet and martyr as well as a\nprofound scholar. He passed many years in prison rather than yield to\nthe rapacious demands of the local government for a ransom, which Meir’s\nfriends would willingly have paid. As a specimen of Meir’s poetry, the\nfollowing verses are taken from a dirge composed by him in 1285, when\ncopies of the Pentateuch were publicly committed to the flames. The\n“Law” is addressed in the second person:",
        "    Dismay hath seized upon my soul; how then\n      Can food be sweet to me?\n    When, O thou Law! I have beheld base men\n      Destroying thee?",
        "    Ah! sweet ’twould be unto mine eyes alway\n      Waters of tears to pour,\n    To sob and drench thy sacred robes, till they\n      Could hold no more.",
        "    But lo! my tears are dried, when, fast outpoured,\n      They down my cheeks are shed,\n    Scorched by the fire within, because thy Lord\n      Hath turned and sped.",
        "    Yea, I am desolate and sore bereft,\n      Lo! a forsaken one,\n    Like a sole beacon on a mountain left,\n      A tower alone.",
        "    I hear the voice of singers now no more,\n      Silence their song hath bound,\n    For broken are the strings on harps of yore,\n      Viols of sweet sound.",
        "    I am astonied that the day’s fair light\n      Yet shineth brilliantly\n    On all things; but is ever dark as night\n      To me and thee.",
        "    Even as when thy Rock afflicted thee,\n      He will assuage thy woe,\n    And turn again the tribes’ captivity,\n      And raise the low.",
        "    Yet shalt thou wear thy scarlet raiment choice,\n      And sound the timbrels high,\n    And glad amid the dancers shalt rejoice,\n      With joyful cry.",
        "    My heart shall be uplifted on the day\n      Thy Rock shall be thy light,\n    When he shall make thy gloom to pass away,\n      Thy darkness bright.",
        "This combination of the poetical with the legal mind was parallelled by\nother combinations in such masters of “Responses” as the Sheshet and\nDuran families in Algiers in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. In\nthese men depth of learning was associated with width of culture.\nOthers, such as Moses and Judah Minz, Jacob Weil, and Israel Isserlein,\nwhose influence was paramount in Germany in the fifteenth century, were\nless cultivated, but their learning was associated with a geniality and\nsense of humor that make their “Responses” very human and very\nentertaining. There is the same homely, affectionate air in the\ncollection of Minhagim, or Customs, known as the Maharil, which\nbelongs to the same period. On the other hand, David Abi Zimra, Rabbi of\nCairo in the sixteenth century, was as independent as he was learned. It\nwas he, for instance, who abolished the old custom of dating Hebrew\ndocuments from the Seleucid era (311 B.C.E.). And, to pass beyond the\ntime of Karo, the writers of “Responses” include the gifted Jair Chayim\nBacharach (seventeenth century), a critic as well as a legalist; Chacham\nZevi and Jacob Emden in Amsterdam, and Ezekiel Landau in Prague, the\nformer two of whom opposed the Messianic claims of Sabbatai Zevi, and\nthe last of whom was an antagonist to the Germanizing tendency of Moses\nMendelssohn.",
        "Joseph Karo himself was a man of many parts. He was born in Spain in\n1488, and died in Safed, the nest of mysticism, in 1575. Master of the\nTalmudic writings of his predecessors from his youth, Karo devoted\nthirty-two years to the preparation of an exhaustive commentary on the\n“Four Rows” of Jacob Asheri. This occupied him from 1522 to 1554. Karo\nwas an enthusiast as well as a student, and the emotional side of the\nKabbala had much fascination for him. He believed that he had a\nfamiliar, or Maggid, the personification of the Mishnah, who appeared\nto him in dreams, and held communion with him. He found a congenial home\nin Safed, where the mystics had their head-quarters in the sixteenth\ncentury. Karo’s companion on his journey to Safed was Solomon Alkabets,\nauthor of the famous Sabbath hymn “Come, my Friend” (Lecha Dodi), with\nthe refrain:",
        "    Come forth, my friend, the Bride to meet,\n    Come, O my friend, the Sabbath greet!",
        "The Shulchan Aruch is arranged in four parts, called fancifully, “Path\nof Life” (Orach Chayim), “Teacher of Knowledge” (Yoreh Deah),\n“Breastplate of Judgment” (Choshen ha-Mishpat), and “Stone of Help\"\n(Eben ha-Ezer). The first part is mainly occupied with the subject of\nprayer, benedictions, the Sabbath, the festivals, and the observances\nproper to each. The second part deals with food and its preparation,\nShechitah, or slaughtering of animals for food, the relations between\nJews and non-Jews, vows, respect to parents, charity, and religious\nobservances connected with agriculture, such as the payment of tithes,\nand, finally, the rites of mourning. This section of the Shulchan Aruch\nis the most miscellaneous of the four; in the other three the\nassociation of subjects is more logical. The Eben ha-Ezer treats of the\nlaws of marriage and divorce from their civil and religious aspects. The\nChoshen ha-Mishpat deals with legal procedure, the laws regulating\nbusiness transactions and the relations between man and man in the\nconduct of worldly affairs. A great number of commentaries on Karo’s\nCode were written by and for the Acharonim (=later scholars). It fully\ndeserved this attention, for on its own lines the Shulchan Aruch was a\nmasterly production. It brought system into the discordant opinions of\nthe Rabbinical authorities of the Middle Ages, and its publication in\nthe sixteenth century was itself a stroke of genius. Never before had\nsuch a work been so necessary as then. The Jews were in sight of what\nwas to them the darkest age, the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.\nThough the Shulchan Aruch had an evil effect in stereotyping Jewish\nreligious thought and in preventing the rapid spread of the critical\nspirit, yet it was a rallying point for the disorganized Jews, and saved\nthem from the disintegration which threatened them. The Shulchan Aruch\nwas the last great bulwark of the Rabbinical conception of life. Alike\nin its form and contents it was a not unworthy close to the series of\ncodes which began with the Mishnah, and in which life itself was\ncodified.",
