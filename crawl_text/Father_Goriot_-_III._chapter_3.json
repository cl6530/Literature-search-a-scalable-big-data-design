        "“Sylvie,” said Christophe, as he dipped a piece of toast into the\ncoffee, “M. Vautrin, who is not such a bad sort, all the same, had two\npeople come to see him again last night. If madame says anything, mind\nyou say nothing about it.”",
        "“Has he given you something?”",
        "“He gave me a five-franc piece this month, which is as good as saying,\n’Hold your tongue.’”",
        "“Except him and Mme. Couture, who doesn’t look twice at every penny,\nthere’s no one in the house that doesn’t try to get back with the left\nhand all that they give with the right at New Year,” said Sylvie.",
        "“And, after all,” said Christophe, “what do they give you? A miserable\nfive-franc piece. There is Father Goriot, who has cleaned his shoes\nhimself these two years past. There is that old beggar Poiret, who\ngoes without blacking altogether; he would sooner drink it than put it\non his boots. Then there is that whipper-snapper of a student, who\ngives me a couple of francs. Two francs will not pay for my brushes,\nand he sells his old clothes, and gets more for them than they are\nworth. Oh! they’re a shabby lot!”",
        "“Pooh!” said Sylvie, sipping her coffee, “our places are the best in\nthe Quarter, that I know. But about that great big chap Vautrin,\nChristophe; has any one told you anything about him?”",
        "“Yes. I met a gentleman in the street a few days ago; he said to me,\n’There’s a gentleman in your place, isn’t there? a tall man that dyes\nhis whiskers?’ I told him, ’No, sir; they aren’t dyed. A gay fellow\nlike him hasn’t the time to do it.’ And when I told M. Vautrin about\nit afterwards, he said, ’Quite right, my boy. That is the way to\nanswer them. There is nothing more unpleasant than to have your little\nweaknesses known; it might spoil many a match.’”",
        "“Well, and for my part,” said Sylvie, “a man tried to humbug me at the\nmarket wanting to know if I had seen him put on his shirt. Such bosh!\nThere,” she cried, interrupting herself, “that’s a quarter to ten\nstriking at the Val-de-Grace, and not a soul stirring!”",
        "“Pooh! they are all gone out. Mme. Couture and the girl went out at\neight o’clock to take the wafer at Saint-Etienne. Father Goriot\nstarted off somewhere with a parcel, and the student won’t be back\nfrom his lecture till ten o’clock. I saw them go while I was sweeping\nthe stairs; Father Goriot knocked up against me, and his parcel was as\nhard as iron. What is the old fellow up to, I wonder? He is as good as\na plaything for the rest of them; they can never let him alone; but he\nis a good man, all the same, and worth more than all of them put\ntogether. He doesn’t give you much himself, but he sometimes sends you\nwith a message to ladies who fork out famous tips; they are dressed\ngrandly, too.”",
        "“His daughters, as he calls them, eh? There are a dozen of them.”",
        "“I have never been to more than two–the two who came here.”",
        "“There is madame moving overhead; I shall have to go, or she will\nraise a fine racket. Just keep an eye on the milk, Christophe; don’t\nlet the cat get at it.”",
        "Sylvie went up to her mistress’ room.",
        "“Sylvie! How is this? It’s nearly ten o’clock, and you let me sleep\nlike a dormouse! Such a thing has never happened before.”",
        "“It’s the fog; it is that thick, you could cut it with a knife.”",
        "“But how about breakfast?”",
        "“Bah! the boarders are possessed, I’m sure. They all cleared out\nbefore there was a wink of daylight.”",
        "“Do speak properly, Sylvie,” Mme. Vauquer retorted; “say a blink of\ndaylight.”",
        "“Ah, well, madame, whichever you please. Anyhow, you can have\nbreakfast at ten o’clock. La Michonnette and Poiret have neither of\nthem stirred. There are only those two upstairs, and they are sleeping\nlike the logs they are.”",
        "“But, Sylvie, you put their names together as if––”",
        "“As if what?” said Sylvie, bursting into a guffaw. “The two of them\nmake a pair.”",
        "“It is a strange thing, isn’t it, Sylvie, how M. Vautrin got in last\nnight after Christophe had bolted the door?”",
        "“Not at all, madame. Christophe heard M. Vautrin, and went down and\nundid the door. And here are you imagining that––?”",
        "“Give me my bodice, and be quick and get breakfast ready. Dish up the\nrest of the mutton with the potatoes, and you can put the stewed pears\non the table, those at five a penny.”",
        "A few moments later Mme. Vauquer came down, just in time to see the\ncat knock down a plate that covered a bowl of milk, and begin to lap\nin all haste.",
        "“Mistigris!” she cried.",
        "The cat fled, but promptly returned to rub against her ankles.",
        "“Oh! yes, you can wheedle, you old hypocrite!” she said. “Sylvie!\nSylvie!”",
        "“Yes, madame; what is it?”",
        "“Just see what the cat has done!”",
        "“It is all that stupid Christophe’s fault. I told him to stop and lay\nthe table. What has become of him? Don’t you worry, madame; Father\nGoriot shall have it. I will fill it up with water, and he won’t know\nthe difference; he never notices anything, not even what he eats.”",
        "“I wonder where the old heathen can have gone?” said Mme. Vauquer,\nsetting the plates round the table.",
        "“Who knows? He is up to all sorts of tricks.”",
        "“I have overslept myself,” said Mme. Vauquer.",
        "“But madame looks as fresh as a rose, all the same.”",
        "The door bell rang at that moment, and Vautrin came through the\nsitting-room, singing loudly:",
        "  “’Tis the same old story everywhere,\n   A roving heart and a roving glance . .",
        "“Oh! Mamma Vauquer! good-morning!” he cried at the sight of his\nhostess, and he put his arm gaily round her waist.",
        "“There! have done––”",
        "“’Impertinence!’ Say it!” he answered. “Come, say it! Now, isn’t that\nwhat you really mean? Stop a bit, I will help you to set the table.\nAh! I am a nice man, am I not?",
        "  “For the locks of brown and the golden hair\n     A sighing lover . . .",
        "“Oh! I have just seen something so funny––",
        "                     . . . . led by chance.”",
        "“What?” asked the widow.",
        "“Father Goriot in the goldsmith’s shop in the Rue Dauphine at\nhalf-past eight this morning. They buy old spoons and forks and gold\nlace there, and Goriot sold a piece of silver plate for a good round\nsum. It had been twisted out of shape very neatly for a man that’s\nnot used to the trade.”",
        "“Really? You don’t say so?”",
        "“Yes. One of my friends is expatriating himself; I had been to see him\noff on board the Royal Mail steamer, and was coming back here. I\nwaited after that to see what Father Goriot would do; it is a comical\naffair. He came back to this quarter of the world, to the Rue des\nGres, and went into a money-lender’s house; everybody knows him,\nGobseck, a stuck-up rascal, that would make dominoes out of his\nfather’s bones, a Turk, a heathen, an old Jew, a Greek; it would be a\ndifficult matter to rob him, for he puts all his coin into the\nBank.”",
        "“Then what was Father Goriot doing there?”",
        "“Doing?” said Vautrin. “Nothing; he was bent on his own undoing. He is\na simpleton, stupid enough to ruin himself by running after––”",
        "“There he is!” cried Sylvie.",
        "“Christophe,” cried Father Goriot’s voice, “come upstairs with me.”",
        "Christophe went up, and shortly afterwards came down again.",
        "“Where are you going?” Mme. Vauquer asked of her servant.",
        "“Out on an errand for M. Goriot.”",
        "“What may that be?” said Vautrin, pouncing on a letter in Christophe’s\nhand. ’Mme. la Comtesse Anastasie de Restaud,” he read. “Where are\nyou going with it?” he added, as he gave the letter back to\nChristophe.",
        "“To the Rue du Helder. I have orders to give this into her hands\nmyself.”",
        "“What is there inside it?” said Vautrin, holding the letter up to the\nlight. “A banknote? No.” He peered into the envelope. “A receipted\naccount!” he cried. “My word! ’tis a gallant old dotard. Off with you,\nold chap,” he said, bringing down a hand on Christophe’s head, and\nspinning the man round like a thimble; “you will have a famous tip.”",
        "By this time the table was set. Sylvie was boiling the milk, Mme.\nVauquer was lighting a fire in the stove with some assistance from\nVautrin, who kept humming to himself:",
        "  “The same old story everywhere,\n   A roving heart and a roving glance.”",
        "When everything was ready, Mme. Couture and Mlle. Taillefer came in.",
        "“Where have you been this morning, fair lady?” said Mme. Vauquer,\nturning to Mme. Couture.",
        "“We have just been to say our prayers at Saint-Etienne du Mont. To-day\nis the day when we must go to see M. Taillefer. Poor little thing! She\nis trembling like a leaf,” Mme. Couture went on, as she seated herself\nbefore the fire and held the steaming soles of her boots to the blaze.",
        "“Warm yourself, Victorine,” said Mme. Vauquer.",
        "“It is quite right and proper, mademoiselle, to pray to Heaven to\nsoften your father’s heart,” said Vautrin, as he drew a chair nearer\nto the orphan girl; “but that is not enough. What you want is a friend\nwho will give the monster a piece of his mind; a barbarian that has\nthree millions (so they say), and will not give you a dowry; and a\npretty girl needs a dowry nowadays.”",
        "“Poor child!” said Mme. Vauquer. “Never mind, my pet, your wretch of a\nfather is going just the way to bring trouble upon himself.”",
        "Victorine’s eyes filled with tears at the words, and the widow checked\nherself at a sign from Mme. Couture.",
        "“If we could only see him!” said the Commissary-General’s widow; “if I\ncould speak to him myself and give him his wife’s last letter! I have\nnever dared to run the risk of sending it by post; he knew my\nhandwriting––”",
        "“’Oh woman, persecuted and injured innocent!’” exclaimed Vautrin,\nbreaking in upon her. “So that is how you are, is it? In a few days’\ntime I will look into your affairs, and it will be all right, you\nshall see.”",
        "“Oh! sir,” said Victorine, with a tearful but eager glance at Vautrin,\nwho showed no sign of being touched by it, “if you know of any way of\ncommunicating with my father, please be sure and tell him that his\naffection and my mother’s honor are more to me than all the money in\nthe world. If you can induce him to relent a little towards me, I will\npray to God for you. You may be sure of my gratitude––”",
        "“The same old story everywhere,” sang Vautrin, with a satirical\nintonation. At this juncture, Goriot, Mlle. Michonneau, and Poiret\ncame downstairs together; possibly the scent of the gravy which Sylvie\nwas making to serve with the mutton had announced breakfast. The seven\npeople thus assembled bade each other good-morning, and took their\nplaces at the table; the clock struck ten, and the student’s footstep\nwas heard outside.",
        "“Ah! here you are, M. Eugene,” said Sylvie; “every one is breakfasting\nat home to-day.”",
        "The student exchanged greetings with the lodgers, and sat down beside\nGoriot.",
        "“I have just met with a queer adventure,” he said, as he helped\nhimself abundantly to the mutton, and cut a slice of bread, which Mme.\nVauquer’s eyes gauged as usual.",
        "“An adventure?” queried Poiret.",
        "“Well, and what is there to astonish you in that, old boy?” Vautrin\nasked of Poiret. “M. Eugene is cut out for that kind of thing.”",
        "Mlle. Taillefer stole a timid glance at the young student.",
        "“Tell us about your adventure!” demanded M. Vautrin.",
        "“Yesterday evening I went to a ball given by a cousin of mine, the\nVicomtesse de Beauseant. She has a magnificent house; the rooms are\nhung with silk–in short, it was a splendid affair, and I was as happy\nas a king–-”",
        "“Fisher,” put in Vautrin, interrupting.",
        "“What do you mean, sir?” said Eugene sharply.",
        "“I said ’fisher,’ because kingfishers see a good deal more fun than\nkings.”",
        "“Quite true; I would much rather be the little careless bird than a\nking,” said Poiret the ditto-ist, “because––”",
        "“In fact\"–the law-student cut him short–\"I danced with one of the\nhandsomest women in the room, a charming countess, the most exquisite\ncreature I have ever seen. There was peach blossom in her hair, and\nshe had the loveliest bouquet of flowers–real flowers, that scented\nthe air––but there! it is no use trying to describe a woman glowing\nwith the dance. You ought to have seen her! Well, and this morning I\nmet this divine countess about nine o’clock, on foot in the Rue de\nGres. Oh! how my heart beat! I began to think––”",
        "“That she was coming here,” said Vautrin, with a keen look at the\nstudent. “I expect that she was going to call on old Gobseck, a\nmoney-lender. If ever you explore a Parisian woman’s heart, you will\nfind the money-lender first, and the lover afterwards. Your countess\nis called Anastasie de Restaud, and she lives in the Rue du Helder.”",
        "The student stared hard at Vautrin. Father Goriot raised his head at\nthe words, and gave the two speakers a glance so full of intelligence\nand uneasiness that the lodgers beheld him with astonishment.",
        "“Then Christophe was too late, and she must have gone to him!” cried\nGoriot, with anguish in his voice.",
        "“It is just as I guessed,” said Vautrin, leaning over to whisper in\nMme. Vauquer’s ear.",
        "Goriot went on with his breakfast, but seemed unconscious of what he\nwas doing. He had never looked more stupid nor more taken up with his\nown thoughts than he did at that moment.",
        "“Who the devil could have told you her name, M. Vautrin?” asked\nEugene.",
        "“Aha! there you are!” answered Vautrin. “Old Father Goriot there knew\nit quite well! and why should I not know it too?”",
        "“M. Goriot?” the student cried.",
        "“What is it?” asked the old man. “So she was very beautiful, was she,\nyesterday night?”",
        "“Who?”",
        "“Mme. de Restaud.”",
        "“Look at the old wretch,” said Mme. Vauquer, speaking to Vautrin; “how\nhis eyes light up!”",
        "“Then does he really keep her?” said Mlle. Michonneau, in a whisper to\nthe student.",
        "“Oh! yes, she was tremendously pretty,” Eugene answered. Father Goriot\nwatched him with eager eyes. “If Mme. de Beauseant had not been there,\nmy divine countess would have been the queen of the ball; none of the\nyounger men had eyes for any one else. I was the twelfth on her list,\nand she danced every quadrille. The other women were furious. She must\nhave enjoyed herself, if ever creature did! It is a true saying that\nthere is no more beautiful sight than a frigate in full sail, a\ngalloping horse, or a woman dancing.”",
        "“So the wheel turns,” said Vautrin; “yesterday night at a duchess’\nball, this morning in a money-lender’s office, on the lowest rung of\nthe ladder–just like a Parisienne! If their husbands cannot afford to\npay for their frantic extravagance, they will sell themselves. Or if\nthey cannot do that, they will tear out their mothers’ hearts to find\nsomething to pay for their splendor. They will turn the world upside\ndown. Just a Parisienne through and through!”",
        "Father Goriot’s face, which had shone at the student’s words like the\nsun on a bright day, clouded over all at once at this cruel speech of\nVautrin’s.",
        "“Well,” said Mme. Vauquer, “but where is your adventure? Did you speak\nto her? Did you ask her if she wanted to study law?”",
        "“She did not see me,” said Eugene. “But only think of meeting one of\nthe prettiest women in Paris in the Rue des Gres at nine o’clock! She\ncould not have reached home after the ball till two o’clock this\nmorning. Wasn’t it queer? There is no place like Paris for this sort\nof adventures.”",
        "“Pshaw! much funnier things than that happen here!” exclaimed\nVautrin.",
        "Mlle. Taillefer had scarcely heeded the talk, she was so absorbed by\nthe thought of the new attempt that she was about to make. Mme.\nCouture made a sign that it was time to go upstairs and dress; the two\nladies went out, and Father Goriot followed their example.",
        "“Well, did you see?” said Mme. Vauquer, addressing Vautrin and the\nrest of the circle. “He is ruining himself for those women, that is\nplain.”",
        "“Nothing will ever make me believe that that beautiful Comtesse de\nRestaud is anything to Father Goriot,” cried the student.",
        "“Well, and if you don’t,” broke in Vautrin, “we are not set on\nconvincing you. You are too young to know Paris thoroughly yet; later\non you will find out that there are what we call men with a\npassion––”",
        "Mlle. Michonneau gave Vautrin a quick glance at these words. They\nseemed to be like the sound of a trumpet to a trooper’s horse. “Aha!\"\nsaid Vautrin, stopping in his speech to give her a searching glance,\n“so we have had our little experiences, have we?”",
        "The old maid lowered her eyes like a nun who sees a statue.",
        "“Well,” he went on, “when folk of that kind get a notion into their\nheads, they cannot drop it. They must drink the water from some\nparticular spring–it is stagnant as often as not; but they will sell\ntheir wives and families, they will sell their own souls to the devil\nto get it. For some this spring is play, or the stock-exchange, or\nmusic, or a collection of pictures or insects; for others it is some\nwoman who can give them the dainties they like. You might offer these\nlast all the women on earth–they would turn up their noses; they will\nhave the only one who can gratify their passion. It often happens that\nthe woman does not care for them at all, and treats them cruelly; they\nbuy their morsels of satisfaction very dear; but no matter, the fools\nare never tired of it; they will take their last blanket to the\npawnbroker’s to give their last five-franc piece to her. Father Goriot\nhere is one of that sort. He is discreet, so the Countess exploits\nhim–just the way of the gay world. The poor old fellow thinks of her\nand of nothing else. In all other respects you see he is a stupid\nanimal; but get him on that subject, and his eyes sparkle like\ndiamonds. That secret is not difficult to guess. He took some plate\nhimself this morning to the melting-pot, and I saw him at Daddy\nGobseck’s in the Rue des Gres. And now, mark what follows–he came\nback here, and gave a letter for the Comtesse de Restaud to that\nnoodle of a Christophe, who showed us the address; there was a\nreceipted bill inside it. It is clear that it was an urgent matter if\nthe Countess also went herself to the old money lender. Father Goriot\nhas financed her handsomely. There is no need to tack a tale together;\nthe thing is self-evident. So that shows you, sir student, that all\nthe time your Countess was smiling, dancing, flirting, swaying her\npeach-flower crowned head, with her gown gathered into her hand, her\nslippers were pinching her, as they say; she was thinking of her\nprotested bills, or her lover’s protested bills.”",
        "“You have made me wild to know the truth,” cried Eugene; “I will go to\ncall on Mme. de Restaud to-morrow.”",
        "“Yes,” echoed Poiret; “you must go and call on Mme. de Restaud.”",
        "“And perhaps you will find Father Goriot there, who will take payment\nfor the assistance he politely rendered.”",
        "Eugene looked disgusted. “Why, then, this Paris of yours is a slough.”",
        "“And an uncommonly queer slough, too,” replied Vautrin. “The mud\nsplashes you as you drive through it in your carriage–you are a\nrespectable person; you go afoot and are splashed–you are a\nscoundrel. You are so unlucky as to walk off with something or other\nbelonging to somebody else, and they exhibit you as a curiosity in the\nPlace du Palais-de-Justice; you steal a million, and you are pointed\nout in every salon as a model of virtue. And you pay thirty millions\nfor the police and the courts of justice, for the maintenance of law\nand order! A pretty slate of things it is!”",
        "“What,” cried Mme. Vauquer, “has Father Goriot really melted down his\nsilver posset-dish?”",
        "“There were two turtle-doves on the lid, were there not?” asked\nEugene.",
        "“Yes, that there were.”",
        "“Then, was he fond of it?” said Eugene. “He cried while he was\nbreaking up the cup and plate. I happened to see him by accident.”",
        "“It was dear to him as his own life,” answered the widow.",
        "“There! you see how infatuated the old fellow is!” cried Vautrin. “The\nwoman yonder can coax the soul out of him.”",
        "The student went up to his room. Vautrin went out, and a few moments\nlater Mme. Couture and Victorine drove away in a cab which Sylvie had\ncalled for them. Poiret gave his arm to Mlle. Michonneau, and they\nwent together to spend the two sunniest hours of the day in the Jardin\ndes Plantes.",
        "“Well, those two are as good as married,” was the portly Sylvie’s\ncomment. “They are going out together to-day for the first time. They\nare such a couple of dry sticks that if they happen to strike against\neach other they will draw sparks like flint and steel.”",
        "“Keep clear of Mlle. Michonneau’s shawl, then,” said Mme. Vauquer,\nlaughing; “it would flare up like tinder.”",
        "At four o’clock that evening, when Goriot came in, he saw, by the\nlight of two smoky lamps, that Victorine’s eyes were red. Mme. Vauquer\nwas listening to the history of the visit made that morning to M.\nTaillefer; it had been made in vain. Taillefer was tired of the annual\napplication made by his daughter and her elderly friend; he gave them\na personal interview in order to arrive at an understanding with them.",
        "“My dear lady,” said Mme. Couture, addressing Mme. Vauquer, “just\nimagine it; he did not even ask Victorine to sit down, she was\nstanding the whole time. He said to me quite coolly, without putting\nhimself in a passion, that we might spare ourselves the trouble of\ngoing there; that the young lady (he would not call her his daughter)\nwas injuring her cause by importuning him (importuning! once a year,\nthe wretch!); that as Victorine’s mother had nothing when he married\nher, Victorine ought not to expect anything from him; in fact, he said\nthe most cruel things, that made the poor child burst out crying. The\nlittle thing threw herself at her father’s feet and spoke up bravely;\nshe said that she only persevered in her visits for her mother’s sake;\nthat she would obey him without a murmur, but that she begged him to\nread her poor dead mother’s farewell letter. She took it up and gave\nit to him, saying the most beautiful things in the world, most\nbeautifully expressed; I do not know where she learned them; God must\nhave put them into her head, for the poor child was inspired to speak\nso nicely that it made me cry like a fool to hear her talk. And what\ndo you think the monster was doing all the time? Cutting his nails! He\ntook the letter that poor Mme. Taillefer had soaked with tears, and\nflung it on to the chimney-piece. ’That is all right,’ he said. He\nheld out his hands to raise his daughter, but she covered them with\nkisses, and he drew them away again. Scandalous, isn’t it? And his\ngreat booby of a son came in and took no notice of his sister.”",
        "“What inhuman wretches they must be!” said Father Goriot.",
        "“And then they both went out of the room,” Mme. Couture went on,\nwithout heeding the worthy vermicelli maker’s exclamation; “father and\nson bowed to me, and asked me to excuse them on account of urgent\nbusiness! That is the history of our call. Well, he has seen his\ndaughter at any rate. How he can refuse to acknowledge her I cannot\nthink, for they are as alike as two peas.”",
        "The boarders dropped in one after another, interchanging greetings and\nempty jokes that certain classes of Parisians regard as humorous and\nwitty. Dulness is their prevailing ingredient, and the whole point\nconsists in mispronouncing a word or a gesture. This kind of argot is\nalways changing. The essence of the jest consists in some catchword\nsuggested by a political event, an incident in the police courts, a\nstreet song, or a bit of burlesque at some theatre, and forgotten in a\nmonth. Anything and everything serves to keep up a game of battledore\nand shuttlecock with words and ideas. The diorama, a recent invention,\nwhich carried an optical illusion a degree further than panoramas, had\ngiven rise to a mania among art students for ending every word with\nrama. The Maison Vauquer had caught the infection from a young artist\namong the boarders.",
        "“Well, Monsieur-r-r Poiret,” said the employe from the Museum, “how\nis your health-orama?” Then, without waiting for an answer, he turned\nto Mme. Couture and Victorine with a “Ladies, you seem melancholy.”",
        "“Is dinner ready?” cried Horace Bianchon, a medical student, and a\nfriend of Rastignac’s; “my stomach is sinking usque ad talones.”",
        "“There is an uncommon frozerama outside,” said Vautrin. “Make room\nthere, Father Goriot! Confound it, your foot covers the whole front of\nthe stove.”",
        "“Illustrious M. Vautrin,” put in Bianchon, “why do you say\nfrozerama? It is incorrect; it should be frozenrama.”",
        "“No, it shouldn’t,” said the official from the Museum; ’frozerama is\nright by the same rule that you say ’My feet are froze.’”",
        "“Ah! ah!”",
        "“Here is his Excellency the Marquis de Rastignac, Doctor of the Law of\nContraries,” cried Bianchon, seizing Eugene by the throat, and almost\nthrottling him.",
        "“Hallo there! hallo!”",
        "Mlle. Michonneau came noiselessly in, bowed to the rest of the party,\nand took her place beside the three women without saying a word.",
        "“That old bat always makes me shudder,” said Bianchon in a low voice,\nindicating Mlle. Michonneau to Vautrin. “I have studied Gall’s system,\nand I am sure she has the bump of Judas.”",
        "“Then you have seen a case before?” said Vautrin.",
        "“Who has not?” answered Bianchon. “Upon my word, that ghastly old maid\nlooks just like one of the long worms that will gnaw a beam through,\ngive them time enough.”",
        "“That is the way, young man,” returned he of the forty years and the\ndyed whiskers:",
        "  “The rose has lived the life of a rose–\n   A morning’s space.”",
        "“Aha! here is a magnificent soupe-au-rama,” cried Poiret as\nChristophe came in bearing the soup with cautious heed.",
        "“I beg your pardon, sir,” said Mme. Vauquer; “it is soupe aux\nchoux.”",
        "All the young men roared with laughter.",
        "“Had you there, Poiret!”",
        "“Poir-r-r-rette! she had you there!”",
        "“Score two points to Mamma Vauquer,” said Vautrin.",
        "“Did any of you notice the fog this morning?” asked the official.",
        "“It was a frantic fog,” said Bianchon, “a fog unparalleled, doleful,\nmelancholy, sea-green, asthmatical–a Goriot of a fog!”",
        "“A Goriorama,” said the art student, “because you couldn’t see a thing\nin it.”",
        "“Hey! Milord Gaoriotte, they air talking about yoo-o-ou!”",
        "Father Goriot, seated at the lower end of the table, close to the door\nthrough which the servant entered, raised his face; he had smelt at a\nscrap of bread that lay under his table napkin, an old trick acquired\nin his commercial capacity, that still showed itself at times.",
        "“Well,” Madame Vauquer cried in sharp tones, that rang above the\nrattle of spoons and plates and the sound of other voices, “and is\nthere anything the matter with the bread?”",
        "“Nothing whatever, madame,” he answered; “on the contrary, it is made\nof the best quality of corn; flour from Etampes.”",
        "“How could you tell?” asked Eugene.",
        "“By the color, by the flavor.”",
        "“You knew the flavor by the smell, I suppose,” said Mme. Vauquer. “You\nhave grown so economical, you will find out how to live on the smell\nof cooking at last.”",
        "“Take out a patent for it, then,” cried the Museum official; “you\nwould make a handsome fortune.”",
        "“Never mind him,” said the artist; “he does that sort of thing to\ndelude us into thinking that he was a vermicelli maker.”",
        "“Your nose is a corn-sampler, it appears?” inquired the official.",
        "“Corn what?” asked Bianchon.",
        "“Corn-el.”",
        "“Corn-et.”",
        "“Corn-elian.”",
        "“Corn-ice.”",
        "“Corn-ucopia.”",
        "“Corn-crake.”",
        "“Corn-cockle.”",
        "“Corn-orama.”",
        "The eight responses came like a rolling fire from every part of the\nroom, and the laughter that followed was the more uproarious because\npoor Father Goriot stared at the others with a puzzled look, like a\nforeigner trying to catch the meaning of words in a language which he\ndoes not understand.",
        "“Corn? . . .” he said, turning to Vautrin, his next neighbor.",
        "“Corn on your foot, old man!” said Vautrin, and he drove Father\nGoriot’s cap down over his eyes by a blow on the crown.",
        "The poor old man thus suddenly attacked was for a moment too\nbewildered to do anything. Christophe carried off his plate, thinking\nthat he had finished his soup, so that when Goriot had pushed back his\ncap from his eyes his spoon encountered the table. Every one burst out\nlaughing. “You are a disagreeable joker, sir,” said the old man, “and\nif you take any further liberties with me––”",
        "“Well, what then, old boy?” Vautrin interrupted.",
        "“Well, then, you shall pay dearly for it some day––”",
        "“Down below, eh?” said the artist, “in the little dark corner where\nthey put naughty boys.”",
        "“Well, mademoiselle,” Vautrin said, turning to Victorine, “you are\neating nothing. So papa was refractory, was he?”",
        "“A monster!” said Mme. Couture.",
        "“Mademoiselle might make application for aliment pending her suit; she\nis not eating anything. Eh! eh! just see how Father Goriot is staring\nat Mlle. Victorine.”",
        "The old man had forgotten his dinner, he was so absorbed in gazing at\nthe poor girl; the sorrow in her face was unmistakable,–the slighted\nlove of a child whose father would not recognize her.",
        "“We are mistaken about Father Goriot, my dear boy,” said Eugene in a\nlow voice. “He is not an idiot, nor wanting in energy. Try your Gall\nsystem on him, and let me know what you think. I saw him crush a\nsilver dish last night as if it had been made of wax; there seems to\nbe something extraordinary going on in his mind just now, to judge by\nhis face. His life is so mysterious that it must be worth studying.\nOh! you may laugh, Bianchon; I am not joking.”",
        "“The man is a subject, is he?” said Bianchon; “all right! I will\ndissect him, if he will give me the chance.”",
        "“No; feel his bumps.”",
        "“Hm!–his stupidity might perhaps be contagious.”",
        "The next day Rastignac dressed himself very elegantly, and about three\no’clock in the afternoon went to call on Mme. de Restaud. On the way\nthither he indulged in the wild intoxicating dreams which fill a young\nhead so full of delicious excitement. Young men at his age take no\naccount of obstacles nor of dangers; they see success in every\ndirection; imagination has free play, and turns their lives into a\nromance; they are saddened or discouraged by the collapse of one of\nthe visionary schemes that have no existence save in their heated\nfancy. If youth were not ignorant and timid, civilization would be\nimpossible.",
        "Eugene took unheard-of pains to keep himself in a spotless condition,\nbut on his way through the streets he began to think about Mme. de\nRestaud and what he should say to her. He equipped himself with wit,\nrehearsed repartees in the course of an imaginary conversation, and\nprepared certain neat speeches a la Talleyrand, conjuring up a series\nof small events which should prepare the way for the declaration on\nwhich he had based his future; and during these musings the law\nstudent was bespattered with mud, and by the time he reached the\nPalais Royal he was obliged to have his boots blacked and his trousers\nbrushed.",
        "“If I were rich,” he said, as he changed the five-franc piece he had\nbrought with him in case anything might happen, “I would take a cab,\nthen I could think at my ease.”",
        "At last he reached the Rue du Helder, and asked for the Comtesse de\nRestaud. He bore the contemptuous glances of the servants, who had\nseen him cross the court on foot, with the cold fury of a man who\nknows that he will succeed some day. He understood the meaning of\ntheir glances at once, for he had felt his inferiority as soon as he\nentered the court, where a smart cab was waiting. All the delights of\nlife in Paris seemed to be implied by this visible and manifest sign\nof luxury and extravagance. A fine horse, in magnificent harness, was\npawing the ground, and all at once the law student felt out of humor\nwith himself. Every compartment in his brain which he had thought to\nfind so full of wit was bolted fast; he grew positively stupid. He\nsent up his name to the Countess, and waited in the ante-chamber,\nstanding on one foot before a window that looked out upon the court;\nmechanically he leaned his elbow against the sash, and stared before\nhim. The time seemed long; he would have left the house but for the\nsouthern tenacity of purpose which works miracles when it is\nsingle-minded.",
        "“Madame is in her boudoir, and cannot see any one at present, sir,\"\nsaid the servant. “She gave me no answer; but if you will go into the\ndining-room, there is some one already there.”",
        "Rastignac was impressed with a sense of the formidable power of the\nlackey who can accuse or condemn his masters by a word; he coolly\nopened the door by which the man had just entered the ante-chamber,\nmeaning, no doubt, to show these insolent flunkeys that he was\nfamiliar with the house; but he found that he had thoughtlessly\nprecipitated himself into a small room full of dressers, where lamps\nwere standing, and hot-water pipes, on which towels were being dried;\na dark passage and a back staircase lay beyond it. Stifled laughter\nfrom the ante-chamber added to his confusion.",
        "“This way to the drawing-room, sir,” said the servant, with the\nexaggerated respect which seemed to be one more jest at his expense.",
        "Eugene turned so quickly that he stumbled against a bath. By good\nluck, he managed to keep his hat on his head, and saved it from\nimmersion in the water; but just as he turned, a door opened at the\nfurther end of the dark passage, dimly lighted by a small lamp.\nRastignac heard voices and the sound of a kiss; one of the speakers\nwas Mme. de Restaud, the other was Father Goriot. Eugene followed the\nservant through the dining-room into the drawing-room; he went to a\nwindow that looked out into the courtyard, and stood there for a\nwhile. He meant to know whether this Goriot was really the Goriot that\nhe knew. His heart beat unwontedly fast; he remembered Vautrin’s\nhideous insinuations. A well-dressed young man suddenly emerged from\nthe room almost as Eugene entered it, saying impatiently to the\nservant who stood at the door: “I am going, Maurice. Tell Madame la\nComtesse that I waited more than half an hour for her.”",
        "Whereupon this insolent being, who, doubtless, had a right to be\ninsolent, sang an Italian trill, and went towards the window where\nEugene was standing, moved thereto quite as much by a desire to see\nthe student’s face as by a wish to look out into the courtyard.",
        "“But M. le Comte had better wait a moment longer; madame is\ndisengaged,” said Maurice, as he returned to the ante-chamber.",
        "Just at that moment Father Goriot appeared close to the gate; he had\nemerged from a door at the foot of the back staircase. The worthy soul\nwas preparing to open his umbrella regardless of the fact that the\ngreat gate had opened to admit a tilbury, in which a young man with a\nribbon at his button-hole was seated. Father Goriot had scarcely time\nto start back and save himself. The horse took fright at the umbrella,\nswerved, and dashed forward towards the flight of steps. The young man\nlooked round in annoyance, saw Father Goriot, and greeted him as he\nwent out with constrained courtesy, such as people usually show to a\nmoney-lender so long as they require his services, or the sort of\nrespect they feel it necessary to show for some one whose reputation\nhas been blown upon, so that they blush to acknowledge his\nacquaintance. Father Goriot gave him a little friendly nod and a\ngood-natured smile. All this happened with lightning speed. Eugene\nwas so deeply interested that he forgot that he was not alone till\nhe suddenly heard the Countess’ voice.",
        "“Oh! Maxime, were you going away?” she said reproachfully, with a\nshade of pique in her manner. The Countess had not seen the incident\nnor the entrance of the tilbury. Rastignac turned abruptly and saw her\nstanding before him, coquettishly dressed in a loose white cashmere\ngown with knots of rose-colored ribbon here and there; her hair was\ncarelessly coiled about her head, as is the wont of Parisian women in\nthe morning; there was a soft fragrance about her–doubtless she was\nfresh from a bath;–her graceful form seemed more flexible, her beauty\nmore luxuriant. Her eyes glistened. A young man can see everything at\na glance; he feels the radiant influence of woman as a plant discerns\nand absorbs its nutriment from the air; he did not need to touch her\nhands to feel their cool freshness. He saw faint rose tints through\nthe cashmere of the dressing gown; it had fallen slightly open, giving\nglimpses of a bare throat, on which the student’s eyes rested. The\nCountess had no need of the adventitious aid of corsets; her girdle\ndefined the outlines of her slender waist; her throat was a challenge\nto love; her feet, thrust into slippers, were daintily small. As\nMaxime took her hand and kissed it, Eugene became aware of Maxime’s\nexistence, and the Countess saw Eugene.",
        "“Oh! is that you M. de Rastignac? I am very glad to see you,” she\nsaid, but there was something in her manner that a shrewd observer\nwould have taken as a hint to depart.",
        "Maxime, as the Countess Anastasie had called the young man with the\nhaughty insolence of bearing, looked from Eugene to the lady, and from\nthe lady to Eugene; it was sufficiently evident that he wished to be\nrid of the latter. An exact and faithful rendering of the glance might\nbe given in the words: “Look here, my dear; I hope you intend to send\nthis little whipper-snapper about his business.”",
        "The Countess consulted the young man’s face with an intent\nsubmissiveness that betrays all the secrets of a woman’s heart, and\nRastignac all at once began to hate him violently. To begin with, the\nsight of the fair carefully arranged curls on the other’s comely head\nhad convinced him that his own crop was hideous; Maxime’s boots,\nmoreover, were elegant and spotless, while his own, in spite of all\nhis care, bore some traces of his recent walk; and, finally, Maxime’s\novercoat fitted the outline of his figure gracefully, he looked like a\npretty woman, while Eugene was wearing a black coat at half-past two.\nThe quick-witted child of the Charente felt the disadvantage at which\nhe was placed beside this tall, slender dandy, with the clear gaze and\nthe pale face, one of those men who would ruin orphan children without\nscruple. Mme. de Restaud fled into the next room without waiting for\nEugene to speak; shaking out the skirts of her dressing-gown in her\nflight, so that she looked like a white butterfly, and Maxime hurried\nafter her. Eugene, in a fury, followed Maxime and the Countess, and\nthe three stood once more face to face by the hearth in the large\ndrawing-room. The law student felt quite sure that the odious Maxime\nfound him in the way, and even at the risk of displeasing Mme. de\nRestaud, he meant to annoy the dandy. It had struck him all at once\nthat he had seen the young man before at Mme. de Beauseant’s ball; he\nguessed the relation between Maxime and Mme. de Restaud; and with the\nyouthful audacity that commits prodigious blunders or achieves signal\nsuccess, he said to himself, “This is my rival; I mean to cut him\nout.”",
        "Rash resolve! He did not know that M. le Comte Maxime de Trailles\nwould wait till he was insulted, so as to fire first and kill his man.\nEugene was a sportsman and a good shot, but he had not yet hit the\nbulls’s eye twenty times out of twenty-two. The young Count dropped\ninto a low chair by the hearth, took up the tongs, and made up the\nfire so violently and so sulkily, that Anastasie’s fair face suddenly\nclouded over. She turned to Eugene, with a cool, questioning glance\nthat asked plainly, “Why do you not go?” a glance which well-bred\npeople regard as a cue to make their exit.",
        "Eugene assumed an amiable expression.",
        "“Madame,” he began, “I hastened to call upon you––”",
        "He stopped short. The door opened, and the owner of the tilbury\nsuddenly appeared. He had left his hat outside, and did not greet the\nCountess; he looked meditatively at Rastignac, and held out his hand\nto Maxime with a cordial “Good morning,” that astonished Eugene not a\nlittle. The young provincial did not understand the amenities of a\ntriple alliance.",
        "“M. de Restaud,” said the Countess, introducing her husband to the law\nstudent.",
        "Eugene bowed profoundly.",
        "“This gentleman,” she continued, presenting Eugene to her husband, “is\nM. de Rastignac; he is related to Mme. la Vicomtesse de Beauseant\nthrough the Marcillacs; I had the pleasure of meeting him at her last\nball.”",
        "Related to Mme. la Vicomtesse de Beauseant through the Marcillacs!These words, on which the countess threw ever so slight an emphasis,\nby reason of the pride that the mistress of a house takes in showing\nthat she only receives people of distinction as visitors in her house,\nproduced a magical effect. The Count’s stiff manner relaxed at once as\nhe returned the student’s bow.",
        "“Delighted to have an opportunity of making your acquaintance,” he\nsaid.",
        "Maxime de Trailles himself gave Eugene an uneasy glance, and suddenly\ndropped his insolent manner. The mighty name had all the power of a\nfairy’s wand; those closed compartments in the southern brain flew\nopen again; Rastignac’s carefully drilled faculties returned. It was\nas if a sudden light had pierced the obscurity of this upper world of\nParis, and he began to see, though everything was indistinct as yet.\nMme. Vauquer’s lodging-house and Father Goriot were very far remote\nfrom his thoughts.",
        "“I thought that the Marcillacs were extinct,” the Comte de Restaud\nsaid, addressing Eugene.",
        "“Yes, they are extinct,” answered the law student. “My great-uncle,\nthe Chevalier de Rastignac, married the heiress of the Marcillac\nfamily. They had only one daughter, who married the Marechal de\nClarimbault, Mme. de Beauseant’s grandfather on the mother’s side. We\nare the younger branch of the family, and the younger branch is all\nthe poorer because my great-uncle, the Vice-Admiral, lost all that he\nhad in the King’s service. The Government during the Revolution\nrefused to admit our claims when the Compagnie des Indes was\nliquidated.”",
        "“Was not your great-uncle in command of the Vengeur before 1789?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“Then he would be acquainted with my grandfather, who commanded the\nWarwick.”",
        "Maxime looked at Mme. de Restaud and shrugged his shoulders, as who\nshould say, “If he is going to discuss nautical matters with that\nfellow, it is all over with us.” Anastasie understood the glance that\nM. de Trailles gave her. With a woman’s admirable tact, she began to\nsmile and said:",
        "“Come with me, Maxime; I have something to say to you. We will leave\nyou two gentlemen to sail in company on board the Warwick and the\nVengeur.”",
        "She rose to her feet and signed to Maxime to follow her, mirth and\nmischief in her whole attitude, and the two went in the direction of\nthe boudoir. The morganatic couple (to use a convenient German\nexpression which has no exact equivalent) had reached the door, when\nthe Count interrupted himself in his talk with Eugene.",
        "“Anastasie!” he cried pettishly, “just stay a moment, dear; you know\nvery well that––”",
        "“I am coming back in a minute,” she interrupted; “I have a commission\nfor Maxime to execute, and I want to tell him about it.”",
        "She came back almost immediately. She had noticed the inflection in\nher husband’s voice, and knew that it would not be safe to retire to\nthe boudoir; like all women who are compelled to study their husbands’\ncharacters in order to have their own way, and whose business it is to\nknow exactly how far they can go without endangering a good\nunderstanding, she was very careful to avoid petty collisions in\ndomestic life. It was Eugene who had brought about this untoward\nincident; so the Countess looked at Maxime and indicated the law\nstudent with an air of exasperation. M. de Trailles addressed the\nCount, the Countess, and Eugene with the pointed remark, “You are\nbusy, I do not want to interrupt you; good-day,” and he went.",
        "“Just wait a moment, Maxime!” the Count called after him.",
        "“Come and dine with us,” said the Countess, leaving Eugene and her\nhusband together once more. She followed Maxime into the little\ndrawing-room, where they sat together sufficiently long to feel sure\nthat Rastignac had taken his leave.",
        "The law student heard their laughter, and their voices, and the pauses\nin their talk; he grew malicious, exerted his conversational powers\nfor M. de Restaud, flattered him, and drew him into discussions, to\nthe end that he might see the Countess again and discover the nature\nof her relations with Father Goriot. This Countess with a husband and\na lover, for Maxime clearly was her lover, was a mystery. What was the\nsecret tie that bound her to the old tradesman? This mystery he meant\nto penetrate, hoping by its means to gain a sovereign ascendency over\nthis fair typical Parisian.",
        "“Anastasie!” the Count called again to his wife.",
        "“Poor Maxime!” she said, addressing the young man. “Come, we must\nresign ourselves. This evening––”",
        "“I hope, Nasie,” he said in her ear, “that you will give orders not to\nadmit that youngster, whose eyes light up like live coals when he\nlooks at you. He will make you a declaration, and compromise you, and\nthen you will compel me to kill him.”",
        "“Are you mad, Maxime?” she said. “A young lad of a student is, on the\ncontrary, a capital lightning-conductor; is not that so? Of course, I\nmean to make Restaud furiously jealous of him.”",
        "Maxime burst out laughing, and went out, followed by the Countess, who\nstood at the window to watch him into his carriage; he shook his whip,\nand made his horse prance. She only returned when the great gate had\nbeen closed after him.",
        "“What do you think, dear?” cried the Count, her husband, “this\ngentleman’s family estate is not far from Verteuil, on the Charente;\nhis great-uncle and my grandfather were acquainted.”",
        "“Delighted to find that we have acquaintances in common,” said the\nCountess, with a preoccupied manner.",
        "“More than you think,” said Eugene, in a low voice.",
        "“What do you mean?” she asked quickly.",
        "“Why, only just now,” said the student, “I saw a gentleman go out at\nthe gate, Father Goriot, my next door neighbor in the house where I am\nlodging.”",
        "At the sound of this name, and the prefix that embellished it, the\nCount, who was stirring the fire, let the tongs fall as though they\nhad burned his fingers, and rose to his feet.",
        "“Sir,” he cried, “you might have called him ’Monsieur Goriot’!”",
        "The Countess turned pale at first at the sight of her husband’s\nvexation, then she reddened; clearly she was embarrassed, her answer\nwas made in a tone that she tried to make natural, and with an air of\nassumed carelessness:",
        "“You could not know any one who is dearer to us both . . .”",
        "She broke off, glanced at the piano as if some fancy had crossed her\nmind, and asked, “Are you fond of music, M. de Rastignac?”",
        "“Exceedingly,” answered Eugene, flushing, and disconcerted by a dim\nsuspicion that he had somehow been guilty of a clumsy piece of folly.",
        "“Do you sing?” she cried, going to the piano, and, sitting down\nbefore it, she swept her fingers over the keyboard from end to end.\nR-r-r-rah!",
        "“No, madame.”",
        "The Comte de Restaud walked to and fro.",
        "“That is a pity; you are without one great means of success.\n–Ca-ro, ca-a-ro, ca-a-a-ro, non du-bi-ta-re,” sang the Countess.",
        "Eugene had a second time waved a magic wand when he uttered Goriot’s\nname, but the effect seemed to be entirely opposite to that produced\nby the formula “related to Mme. de Beauseant.” His position was not\nunlike that of some visitor permitted as a favor to inspect a private\ncollection of curiosities, when by inadvertence he comes into\ncollision with a glass case full of sculptured figures, and three or\nfour heads, imperfectly secured, fall at the shock. He wished the\nearth would open and swallow him. Mme. de Restaud’s expression was\nreserved and chilly, her eyes had grown indifferent, and sedulously\navoided meeting those of the unlucky student of law.",
        "“Madame,” he said, “you wish to talk with M. de Restaud; permit me to\nwish you good-day––”",
        "The Countess interrupted him by a gesture, saying hastily, “Whenever\nyou come to see us, both M. de Restaud and I shall be delighted to see\nyou.”",
        "Eugene made a profound bow and took his leave, followed by M. de\nRestaud, who insisted, in spite of his remonstrances, on accompanying\nhim into the hall.",
        "“Neither your mistress nor I are at home to that gentleman when he\ncalls,” the Count said to Maurice.",
        "As Eugene set foot on the steps, he saw that it was raining.",
        "“Come,” said he to himself, “somehow I have just made a mess of it, I\ndo not know how. And now I am going to spoil my hat and coat into the\nbargain. I ought to stop in my corner, grind away at law, and never\nlook to be anything but a boorish country magistrate. How can I go\ninto society, when to manage properly you want a lot of cabs,\nvarnished boots, gold watch chains, and all sorts of things; you have\nto wear white doeskin gloves that cost six francs in the morning, and\nprimrose kid gloves every evening? A fig for that old humbug of a\nGoriot!”",
        "When he reached the street door, the driver of a hackney coach, who\nhad probably just deposited a wedding party at their door, and asked\nnothing better than a chance of making a little money for himself\nwithout his employer’s knowledge, saw that Eugene had no umbrella,\nremarked his black coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, and varnished\nboots, and stopped and looked at him inquiringly. Eugene, in the blind\ndesperation that drives a young man to plunge deeper and deeper into\nan abyss, as if he might hope to find a fortunate issue in its lowest\ndepths, nodded in reply to the driver’s signal, and stepped into the\ncab; a few stray petals of orange blossom and scraps of wire bore\nwitness to its recent occupation by a wedding party.",
        "“Where am I to drive, sir?” demanded the man, who, by this time, had\ntaken off his white gloves.",
        "“Confound it!” Eugene said to himself, “I am in for it now, and at\nleast I will not spend cab-hire for nothing!–Drive to the Hotel\nBeauseant,” he said aloud.",
        "“Which?” asked the man, a portentous word that reduced Eugene to\nconfusion. This young man of fashion, species incerta, did not know\nthat there were two Hotels Beauseant; he was not aware how rich he was\nin relations who did not care about him.",
        "“The Vicomte de Beauseant, Rue––”",
        "“De Grenelle,” interrupted the driver, with a jerk of his head. “You\nsee, there are the hotels of the Marquis and Comte de Beauseant in the\nRue Saint-Dominique,” he added, drawing up the step.",
        "“I know all about that,” said Eugene, severely.–\"Everybody is\nlaughing at me to-day, it seems!” he said to himself, as he deposited\nhis hat on the opposite seat. “This escapade will cost me a king’s\nransom, but, at any rate, I shall call on my so-called cousin in a\nthoroughly aristocratic fashion. Goriot has cost me ten francs\nalready, the old scoundrel. My word! I will tell Mme. de Beauseant\nabout my adventure; perhaps it may amuse her. Doubtless she will know\nthe secret of the criminal relation between that handsome woman and\nthe old rat without a tail. It would be better to find favor in my\ncousin’s eyes than to come in contact with that shameless woman, who\nseems to me to have very expensive tastes. Surely the beautiful\nVicomtesse’s personal interest would turn the scale for me, when the\nmere mention of her name produces such an effect. Let us look higher.\nIf you set yourself to carry the heights of heaven, you must face\nGod.”",
        "The innumerable thoughts that surged through his brain might be summed\nup in these phrases. He grew calmer, and recovered something of his\nassurance as he watched the falling rain. He told himself that though\nhe was about to squander two of the precious five-franc pieces that\nremained to him, the money was well laid out in preserving his coat,\nboots, and hat; and his cabman’s cry of “Gate, if you please,” almost\nput him in spirits. A Swiss, in scarlet and gold, appeared, the great\ndoor groaned on its hinges, and Rastignac, with sweet satisfaction,\nbeheld his equipage pass under the archway and stop before the flight\nof steps beneath the awning. The driver, in a blue-and-red greatcoat,\ndismounted and let down the step. As Eugene stepped out of the cab, he\nheard smothered laughter from the peristyle. Three or four lackeys\nwere making merry over the festal appearance of the vehicle. In\nanother moment the law student was enlightened as to the cause of\ntheir hilarity; he felt the full force of the contrast between his\nequipage and one of the smartest broughams in Paris; a coachman, with\npowdered hair, seemed to find it difficult to hold a pair of spirited\nhorses, who stood chafing the bit. In Mme. de Restaud’s courtyard, in\nthe Chaussee d’Antin, he had seen the neat turnout of a young man of\nsix-and-twenty; in the Faubourg Saint-Germain he found the luxurious\nequipage of a man of rank; thirty thousand francs would not have\npurchased it.",
        "“Who can be here?” said Eugene to himself. He began to understand,\nthough somewhat tardily, that he must not expect to find many women in\nParis who were not already appropriated, and that the capture of one\nof these queens would be likely to cost something more than bloodshed.\n“Confound it all! I expect my cousin also has her Maxime.”",
        "He went up the steps, feeling that he was a blighted being. The glass\ndoor was opened for him; the servants were as solemn as jackasses\nunder the curry comb. So far, Eugene had only been in the ballroom on\nthe ground floor of the Hotel Beauseant; the fete had followed so\nclosely on the invitation, that he had not had time to call on his\ncousin, and had therefore never seen Mme. de Beauseant’s apartments;\nhe was about to behold for the first time a great lady among the\nwonderful and elegant surroundings that reveal her character and\nreflect her daily life. He was the more curious, because Mme. de\nRestaud’s drawing-room had provided him with a standard of comparison.",
        "At half-past four the Vicomtesse de Beauseant was visible. Five\nminutes earlier she would not have received her cousin, but Eugene\nknew nothing of the recognized routine of various houses in Paris. He\nwas conducted up the wide, white-painted, crimson-carpeted staircase,\nbetween the gilded balusters and masses of flowering plants, to Mme.\nde Beauseant’s apartments. He did not know the rumor current about\nMme. de Beauseant, one of the biographies told, with variations, in\nwhispers, every evening in the salons of Paris.",
        "For three years past her name had been spoken of in connection with\nthat of one of the most wealthy and distinguished Portuguese nobles,\nthe Marquis d’Ajuda-Pinto. It was one of those innocent liaisons which\npossess so much charm for the two thus attached to each other that\nthey find the presence of a third person intolerable. The Vicomte de\nBeauseant, therefore, had himself set an example to the rest of the\nworld by respecting, with as good a grace as might be, this morganatic\nunion. Any one who came to call on the Vicomtesse in the early days of\nthis friendship was sure to find the Marquis d’Ajuda-Pinto there. As,\nunder the circumstances, Mme. de Beauseant could not very well shut\nher door against these visitors, she gave them such a cold reception,\nand showed so much interest in the study of the ceiling, that no one\ncould fail to understand how much he bored her; and when it became\nknown in Paris that Mme. de Beauseant was bored by callers between two\nand four o’clock, she was left in perfect solitude during that\ninterval. She went to the Bouffons or to the Opera with M. de\nBeauseant and M. d’Ajuda-Pinto; and M. de Beauseant, like a well-bred\nman of the world, always left his wife and the Portuguese as soon as\nhe had installed them. But M. d’Ajuda-Pinto must marry, and a Mlle. de\nRochefide was the young lady. In the whole fashionable world there was\nbut one person who as yet knew nothing of the arrangement, and that\nwas Mme. de Beauseant. Some of her friends had hinted at the\npossibility, and she had laughed at them, believing that envy had\nprompted those ladies to try to make mischief. And now, though the\nbans were about to be published, and although the handsome Portuguese\nhad come that day to break the news to the Vicomtesse, he had not\nfound courage as yet to say one word about his treachery. How was it?\nNothing is doubtless more difficult than the notification of an\nultimatum of this kind. There are men who feel more at their ease when\nthey stand up before another man who threatens their lives with sword\nor pistol than in the presence of a woman who, after two hours of\nlamentations and reproaches, falls into a dead swoon and requires\nsalts. At this moment, therefore, M. d’Ajuda-Pinto was on thorns, and\nanxious to take his leave. He told himself that in some way or other\nthe news would reach Mme. de Beauseant; he would write, it would be\nmuch better to do it by letter, and not to utter the words that should\nstab her to the heart.",
        "So when the servant announced M. Eugene de Rastignac, the Marquis\nd’Ajuda-Pinto trembled with joy. To be sure, a loving woman shows even\nmore ingenuity in inventing doubts of her lover than in varying the\nmonotony of his happiness; and when she is about to be forsaken, she\ninstinctively interprets every gesture as rapidly as Virgil’s courser\ndetected the presence of his companion by snuffing the breeze. It was\nimpossible, therefore, that Mme. de Beauseant should not detect that\ninvoluntary thrill of satisfaction; slight though it was, it was\nappalling in its artlessness.",
        "Eugene had yet to learn that no one in Paris should present himself in\nany house without first making himself acquainted with the whole\nhistory of its owner, and of its owner’s wife and family, so that he\nmay avoid making any of the terrible blunders which in Poland draw\nforth the picturesque exclamation, “Harness five bullocks to your\ncart!” probably because you will need them all to pull you out of the\nquagmire into which a false step has plunged you. If, down to the\npresent day, our language has no name for these conversational\ndisasters, it is probably because they are believed to be impossible,\nthe publicity given in Paris to every scandal is so prodigious. After\nthe awkward incident at Mme. de Restaud’s, no one but Eugene could\nhave reappeared in his character of bullock-driver in Mme. de\nBeauseant’s drawing-room. But if Mme. de Restaud and M. de Trailles\nhad found him horribly in the way, M. d’Ajuda hailed his coming with\nrelief.",
        "“Good-bye,” said the Portuguese, hurrying to the door, as Eugene made\nhis entrance into a dainty little pink-and-gray drawing-room, where\nluxury seemed nothing more than good taste.",
        "“Until this evening,” said Mme. de Beauseant, turning her head to give\nthe Marquis a glance. “We are going to the Bouffons, are we not?”",
        "“I cannot go,” he said, with his fingers on the door handle.",
        "Mme. de Beauseant rose and beckoned to him to return. She did not pay\nthe slightest attention to Eugene, who stood there dazzled by the\nsparkling marvels around him; he began to think that this was some\nstory out of the Arabian Nights made real, and did not know where to\nhide himself, when the woman before him seemed to be unconscious of\nhis existence. The Vicomtesse had raised the forefinger of her right\nhand, and gracefully signed to the Marquis to seat himself beside her.\nThe Marquis felt the imperious sway of passion in her gesture; he came\nback towards her. Eugene watched him, not without a feeling of envy.",
        "“That is the owner of the brougham!” he said to himself. “But is it\nnecessary to have a pair of spirited horses, servants in livery, and\ntorrents of gold to draw a glance from a woman here in Paris?”",
        "The demon of luxury gnawed at his heart, greed burned in his veins,\nhis throat was parched with the thirst of gold.",
        "He had a hundred and thirty francs every quarter. His father, mother,\nbrothers, sisters, and aunt did not spend two hundred francs a month\namong them. This swift comparison between his present condition and\nthe aims he had in view helped to benumb his faculties.",
        "“Why not?” the Vicomtesse was saying, as she smiled at the Portuguese.\n“Why cannot you come to the Italiens?”",
        "“Affairs! I am to dine with the English Ambassador.”",
        "“Throw him over.”",
        "When a man once enters on a course of deception, he is compelled to\nadd lie to lie. M. d’Ajuda therefore said, smiling, “Do you lay your\ncommands on me?”",
        "“Yes, certainly.”",
        "“That was what I wanted to have you say to me,” he answered,\ndissembling his feelings in a glance which would have reassured any\nother woman.",
        "He took the Vicomtesse’s hand, kissed it, and went.",
        "Eugene ran his fingers through his hair, and constrained himself to\nbow. He thought that now Mme. de Beauseant would give him her\nattention; but suddenly she sprang forward, rushed to a window in the\ngallery, and watched M. d’Ajuda step into his carriage; she listened\nto the order that he gave, and heard the Swiss repeat it to the\ncoachman:",
        "“To M. de Rochefide’s house.”",
        "Those words, and the way in which M. d’Ajuda flung himself back in the\ncarriage, were like a lightning flash and a thunderbolt for her; she\nwalked back again with a deadly fear gnawing at her heart. The most\nterrible catastrophes only happen among the heights. The Vicomtesse\nwent to her own room, sat down at a table, and took up a sheet of\ndainty notepaper.",
        "  “When, instead of dining with the English Ambassador,\"\n   she wrote, “you go to the Rochefides, you owe me an\n   explanation, which I am waiting to hear.”",
        "She retraced several of the letters, for her hand was trembling so\nthat they were indistinct; then she signed the note with an initial C\nfor “Claire de Bourgogne,” and rang the bell.",
        "“Jacques,” she said to the servant, who appeared immediately, “take\nthis note to M. de Rochefide’s house at half-past seven and ask for\nthe Marquis d’Ajuda. If M. d’Ajuda is there, leave the note without\nwaiting for an answer; if he is not there, bring the note back to me.”",
        "“Madame la Vicomtess, there is a visitor in the drawing-room.”",
        "“Ah! yes, of course,” she said, opening the door.",
        "Eugene was beginning to feel very uncomfortable, but at last the\nVicomtesse appeared; she spoke to him, and the tremulous tones of her\nvoice vibrated through his heart.",
        "“Pardon me, monsieur,” she said; “I had a letter to write. Now I am\nquite at liberty.”",
        "She scarcely knew what she was saying, for even as she spoke she\nthought, “Ah! he means to marry Mlle. de Rochefide? But is he still\nfree? This evening the marriage shall be broken off, or else . . . But\nbefore to-morrow I shall know.”",
        "“Cousin . . .” the student replied.",
        "“Eh?” said the Countess, with an insolent glance that sent a cold\nshudder through Eugene; he understood what that “Eh?” meant; he had\nlearned a great deal in three hours, and his wits were on the alert.\nHe reddened:",
        "“Madame . . .” he began; he hesitated a moment, and then went on.\n“Pardon me; I am in such need of protection that the nearest scrap of\nrelationship could do me no harm.”",
        "Mme. de Beauseant smiled but there was sadness in her smile; even now\nshe felt forebodings of the coming pain, the air she breathed was\nheavy with the storm that was about to burst.",
        "“If you knew how my family are situated,” he went on, “you would love\nto play the part of a beneficent fairy godmother who graciously clears\nthe obstacles from the path of her protege.”",
        "“Well, cousin,” she said, laughing, “and how can I be of service to\nyou?”",
        "“But do I know even that? I am distantly related to you, and this\nobscure and remote relationship is even now a perfect godsend to me.\nYou have confused my ideas; I cannot remember the things that I meant\nto say to you. I know no one else here in Paris. . . . Ah! if I could\nonly ask you to counsel me, ask you to look upon me as a poor child\nwho would fain cling to the hem of your dress, who would lay down his\nlife for you.”",
        "“Would you kill a man for me?”",
        "“Two,” said Eugene.",
        "“You, child. Yes, you are a child,” she said, keeping back the tears\nthat came to her eyes; “you would love sincerely.”",
        "“Oh!” he cried, flinging up his head.",
        "The audacity of the student’s answer interested the Vicomtesse in him.\nThe southern brain was beginning to scheme for the first time. Between\nMme. de Restaud’s blue boudoir and Mme. de Beauseant’s rose-colored\ndrawing-room he had made a three years’ advance in a kind of law which\nis not a recognized study in Paris, although it is a sort of higher\njurisprudence, and, when well understood, is a highroad to success of\nevery kind.",
        "“Ah! that is what I meant to say!” said Eugene. “I met Mme. de Restaud\nat your ball, and this morning I went to see her.",
        "“You must have been very much in the way,” said Mme. de Beauseant,\nsmiling as she spoke.",
        "“Yes, indeed. I am a novice, and my blunders will set every one\nagainst me, if you do not give me your counsel. I believe that in\nParis it is very difficult to meet with a young, beautiful, and\nwealthy woman of fashion who would be willing to teach me, what you\nwomen can explain so well–life. I shall find a M. de Trailles\neverywhere. So I have come to you to ask you to give me a key to a\npuzzle, to entreat you to tell me what sort of blunder I made this\nmorning. I mentioned an old man––”",
        "“Madame la Duchess de Langeais,” Jacques cut the student short; Eugene\ngave expression to his intense annoyance by a gesture.",
        "“If you mean to succeed,” said the Vicomtesse in a low voice, “in the\nfirst place you must not be so demonstrative.”",
        "“Ah! good morning, dear,” she continued, and rising and crossing the\nroom, she grasped the Duchess’ hands as affectionately as if they had\nbeen sisters; the Duchess responded in the prettiest and most gracious\nway.",
        "“Two intimate friends!” said Rastignac to himself. “Henceforward I\nshall have two protectresses; those two women are great friends, no\ndoubt, and this newcomer will doubtless interest herself in her\nfriend’s cousin.”",
        "“To what happy inspiration do I owe this piece of good fortune, dear\nAntoinette?” asked Mme. de Beauseant.",
        "“Well, I saw M. d’Ajuda-Pinto at M. de Rochefide’s door, so I thought\nthat if I came I should find you alone.”",
        "Mme. de Beauseant’s mouth did not tighten, her color did not rise, her\nexpression did not alter, or rather, her brow seemed to clear as the\nDuchess uttered those deadly words.",
        "“If I had known that you were engaged––” the speaker added, glancing\nat Eugene.",
        "“This gentleman is M. Eugene de Rastignac, one of my cousins,” said\nthe Vicomtesse. “Have you any news of General de Montriveau?” she\ncontinued. “Serizy told me yesterday that he never goes anywhere now;\nhas he been to see you to-day?”",
        "It was believed that the Duchess was desperately in love with M. de\nMontriveau, and that he was a faithless lover; she felt the question\nin her very heart, and her face flushed as she answered:",
        "“He was at the Elysee yesterday.”",
        "“In attendance?”",
        "“Claire,” returned the Duchess, and hatred overflowed in the glances\nshe threw at Mme. de Beauseant; “of course you know that M.\nd’Ajuda-Pinto is going to marry Mlle. de Rochefide; the bans will be\npublished to-morrow.”",
        "This thrust was too cruel; the Vicomtesse’s face grew white, but she\nanswered, laughing, “One of those rumors that fools amuse themselves\nwith. What should induce M. d’Ajuda to take one of the noblest names\nin Portugal to the Rochefides? The Rochefides were only ennobled\nyesterday.”",
        "“But Bertha will have two hundred thousand livres a year, they say.”",
        "“M. d’Ajuda is too wealthy to marry for money.”",
        "“But, my dear, Mlle. de Rochefide is a charming girl.”",
        "“Indeed?”",
        "“And, as a matter of fact, he is dining with them to-day; the thing is\nsettled. It is very surprising to me that you should know so little\nabout it.”",
