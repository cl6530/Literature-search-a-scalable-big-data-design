        "On Monday morning, September 5th, 1819, I saw from the heights of\nFrederiksburg, Copenhagen, for the first time. At this place I alighted\nfrom the carriage, and with my little bundle in my hand, entered the\ncity through the castle garden, the long alley and the suburb.",
        "The evening before my arrival had been made memorable by the breaking\nout of the so-called Jews quarrel, which spread through many European\ncountries. The whole city was in commotion [Footnote: This remarkable\ndisturbance makes a fine incident in Anderson’s romance of “Only a\nFiddler.\"–M. H.]; every body was in the streets; the noise and tumult\nof Copenhagen far exceeded, therefore, any idea which my imagination\nhad formed of this, at that time, to me great city.",
        "With scarcely ten dollars in my pocket, I turned into a small public-\nhouse. My first ramble was to the theatre. I went round it many times;\nI looked up to its walls, and regarded them almost as a home. One of\nthe bill-sellers, who wandered about here each day, observed me, and\nasked me if I would have a bill. I was so wholly ignorant of the world,\nthat I thought the man wished to give me one; I therefore accepted his\noffer with thankfulness. He fancied I was making fun of him and was\nangry; so that I was frightened, and hastened from the place which was\nto me the dearest in the city. Little did I then imagine that ten years\nafterwards my first dramatic piece would be represented there, and that\nin this manner I should make my appearance before the Danish public. On\nthe following day I dressed myself in my confirmation suit, nor were\nthe boots forgotten, although, this time, they were worn, naturally,\nunder my trousers; and thus, in my best attire, with a hat on, which\nfell half over my eyes, I hastened to present my letter of introduction\nto the dancer, Madame Schall. Before I rung at the bell, I fell on my\nknees before the door and prayed God that I here might find help and\nsupport. A maid-servant came down the steps with her basket in her\nhand; she smiled kindly at me, gave me a skilling (Danish), and tripped\non. Astonished, I looked at her and the money. I had on my confirmation\nsuit, and thought I must look very smart. How then could she think that\nI wanted to beg? I called after her.",
        "“Keep it, keep it!” said she to me, in return, and was gone.",
        "At length I was admitted to the dancer; she looked at me in great\namazement, and then heard what I had to say. She had not the slightest\nknowledge of him from whom the letter came, and my whole appearance and\nbehavior seemed very strange to her. I confessed to her my heartfelt\ninclination for the theatre; and upon her asking me what characters I\nthought I could represent, I replied, Cinderella. This piece had been\nperformed in Odense by the royal company, and the principal characters\nhad so greatly taken my fancy, that I could play the part perfectly\nfrom memory. In the mean time I asked her permission to take off my\nboots, otherwise I was not light enough for this character; and then\ntaking up my broad hat for a tambourine, I began to dance and sing,–",
        "  “Here below, nor rank nor riches,   Are exempt from pain and woe.”",
        "My strange gestures and my great activity caused the lady to think me\nout of my mind, and she lost no time in getting rid of me.",
        "From her I went to the manager of the theatre, to ask for an\nengagement. He looked at me, and said that I was “too thin for the\ntheatre.”",
        "“Oh,” replied I, “if you will only engage me with one hundred rix\ndollars banco salary, then I shall soon get fat!” The manager bade me\ngravely go my way, adding, that they only engaged people of education.",
        "I stood there deeply wounded. I knew no one in all Copenhagen who could\ngive me either counsel or consolation. I thought of death as being the\nonly thing, and the best thing for me; but even then my thoughts rose\nupwards to God, and with all the undoubting confidence of a child in\nhis father, they riveted themselves upon Him. I wept bitterly, and then\nI said to myself, “When everything happens really miserably, then he\nsends help. I have always read so. People must first of all suffer a\ngreat deal before they can bring anything to accomplishment.”",
        "I now went and bought myself a gallery-ticket for the opera of Paul and\nVirginia. The separation of the lovers affected me to such a degree,\nthat I burst into violent weeping. A few women, who sat near me,\nconsoled me by saying that it was only a play, and nothing to trouble\noneself about; and then they gave me a sausage sandwich. I had the\ngreatest confidence in everybody, and therefore I told them, with the\nutmost openness, that I did not really weep about Paul and Virginia,\nbut because I regarded the theatre as my Virginia, and that if I must\nbe separated from it, I should be just as wretched as Paul. They looked\nat me, and seemed not to understand my meaning. I then told them why I\nhad come to Copenhagen, and how forlorn I was there. One of the women,\ntherefore, gave me more, bread and butter, with fruit and cakes.",
        "On the following morning I paid my bill, and to my infinite trouble I\nsaw that my whole wealth consisted in one rix dollar banco. It was\nnecessary, therefore, either that I should find some vessel to take me\nhome, or put myself to work with some handicraftsman. I considered that\nthe last was the wiser of the two, because, if I returned to Odense, I\nmust there also put myself to work of a similar kind; besides which, I\nknew very well that the people there would laugh at me if I came back\nagain. It was to me a matter of indifference what handicraft trade I\nlearned,–I only should make use of it to keep life within me in\nCopenhagen. I bought a newspaper, therefore. I found among the\nadvertisements that a cabinet maker was in want of an apprentice. The\nman received me kindly, but said that before I was bound to him he must\nhave an attestation, and my baptismal register from Odense; and that\ntill these came I could remove to his house, and try how the business\npleased me. At six o’clock the next morning I went to the workshop:\nseveral journeymen were there, and two or three apprentices; but the\nmaster was not come. They fell into merry and idle discourse. I was as\nbashful as a girl, and as they soon perceived this, I was unmercifully\nrallied upon it. Later in the day the rude jests of the young fellows\nwent so far, that, in remembrance of the scene at the manufactory, I\ntook the resolute determination not to remain a single day longer in\nthe workshop. I went down to the master, therefore, and told him that I\ncould not stand it; he tried to console me, but in vain: I was too much\naffected, and hastened away.",
        "I now went through the streets; nobody knew me; I was quite forlorn. I\nthen bethought myself of having read in a newspaper in Odense the name\nof an Italian, Siboni, who was the director of the Academy of Music in\nCopenhagen. Everybody had praised my voice; perhaps he would assist me\nfor its sake; if not, then that very evening I must seek out the master\nof some vessel who would take me home again. At the thoughts of the\njourney home I became still more violently excited, and in this state\nof suffering I hastened to Siboni’s house.",
        "It happened that very day that he had a large party to dinner; our\ncelebrated composer Weyse was there, the poet Baggesen, and other\nguests. The housekeeper opened the door to me, and to her I not only\nrelated my wish to be engaged as a singer, but also the whole history\nof my life. She listened to me with the greatest sympathy, and then she\nleft me. I waited a long time, and she must have been repeating to the\ncompany the greater part of what I had said, for, in a while, the door\nopened, and all the guests came out and looked at me. They would have\nme to sing, and Siboni heard me attentively. I gave some scenes out of\nHolberg, and repeated a few poems; and then, all at once, the sense of\nmy unhappy condition so overcame me that I burst into tears; the whole\ncompany applauded.",
        "“I prophesy,” said Baggesen, “that one day something will come out of\nhim; but do not be vain when, some day, the whole public shall applaud\nthee!” and then he added something about pure, true nature, and that\nthis is too often destroyed by years and by intercourse with mankind. I\ndid not understand it all.",
        "Siboni promised to cultivate my voice, and that I therefore should\nsucceed as singer at the Theatre Royal. It made me very happy; I\nlaughed and wept; and as the housekeeper led me out and saw the\nexcitement under which I labored, she stroked my cheeks, and said that\non the following day I should go to Professor Weyse, who meant to do\nsomething for me, and upon whom I could depend.",
        "I went to Weyse, who himself had risen from poverty; he had deeply felt\nand fully comprehended my unhappy situation, and had raised by a\nsubscription seventy rix dollars banco for me. I then wrote my first\nletter to my mother, a letter full of rejoicing, for the good fortune\nof the whole world seemed poured upon me. My mother in her joy showed\nmy letter to all her friends; many heard of it with astonishment;\nothers laughed at it, for what was to be the end of it? In order to\nunderstand Siboni it was necessary for me to learn something of German.\nA woman of Copenhagen, with whom I travelled from Odense to this city,\nand who gladly, according to her means, would have supported me,\nobtained, through one of her acquaintance, a language-master, who\ngratuitously gave me some German lessons, and thus I learned a few\nphrases in that language. Siboni received me into his house, and gave\nme food and instruction; but half a year afterwards my voice broke, or\nwas injured, in consequence of my being compelled to wear bad shoes\nthrough the winter, and having besides no warm under-clothing. There\nwas no longer any prospect that I should become a fine singer. Siboni\ntold me that candidly, and counselled me to go to Odense, and there\nlearn a trade.",
        "I, who in the rich colors of fancy had described to my mother the\nhappiness which I actually felt, must now return home and become an\nobject of derision! Agonized with this thought, I stood as if crushed\nto the earth. Yet, precisely amid this apparently great un-happiness\nlay the stepping-stones of a better fortune.",
        "As I found myself again abandoned, and was pondering by myself upon\nwhat was best for me next to do, it occurred to me that the Poet\nGuldberg, a brother of the Colonel of that name in Odense, who had\nshown me so much kindness, lived in Copenhagen. He lived at that time\nnear the new church-yard outside the city, of which he has so\nbeautifully sung in his poems. I wrote to him, and related to him\neverything; afterwards I went to him myself, and found him surrounded\nwith books and tobacco pipes. The strong, warm-hearted man received me\nkindly; and as he saw by my letter how incorrectly I wrote, he promised\nto give me instruction in the Danish tongue; he examined me a little in\nGerman, and thought that it would be well if he could improve me in\nthis respect also. More than this, he made me a present of the profits\nof a little work which he had just then published; it became known, and\nI believe they exceeded one hundred rix dollars banco; the excellent\nWeyse and others also supported me.",
        "It was too expensive for me to lodge at a public house; I was therefore\nobliged to seek for private lodgings. My ignorance of the world led me\nto a widow who lived in one of the most disreputable streets of\nCopenhagen; she was inclined to receive me into her house, and I never\nsuspected what kind of world it was which moved around me. She was a\nstern, but active dame; she described to me the other people of the\ncity in such horrible colors as made me suppose that I was in the only\nsafe haven there. I was to pay twenty rix dollars monthly for one room,\nwhich was nothing but an empty store-room, without window and light,\nbut I had permission to sit in her parlor. I was to make trial of it at\nfirst for two days, meantime on the following day she told me that I\ncould decide to stay or immediately go. I, who so easily attach myself\nto people, already liked her, and felt myself at home with her; but\nmore than sixteen dollars per month Weyse had told me I must not pay,\nand this was the sum which I had received from him and Guldberg, so\nthat no surplus remained to me for my other expenses. This troubled me\nvery much; when she was gone out of the room, I seated myself on the\nsofa, and contemplated the portrait of her deceased husband.",
        "I was so wholly a child, that as the tears rolled down my own cheeks, I\nwetted the eyes of the portrait with my tears, in order that the dead\nman might feel how troubled I was, and influence the heart of his wife.\nShe must have seen that nothing more was to be drained out of me, for\nwhen she returned to the room she said that she would receive me into\nher house for the sixteen rix dollars. I thanked God and the dead man.\nI found myself in the midst of the mysteries of Copenhagen, but I did\nnot understand how to interpret them. There was in the house in which I\nlived a friendly young lady, who lived alone, and often wept; every\nevening her old father came and paid her a visit. I opened the door to\nhim frequently; he wore a plain sort of coat, had his throat very much\ntied up, and his hat pulled over his eyes. He always drank his tea with\nher, and nobody dared to be present, because he was not fond of\ncompany: she never seemed very glad at his coming. [Footnote: This\ncharacter will be recognised in Steffen Margaret, in Only a Fiddler.–\nM. H.] Many years afterwards, when I had reached another step on the\nladder of life, when the refined world of fashionable life was opened\nbefore me, I saw one evening, in the midst of a brilliantly lighted\nhall, a polite old gentleman covered with orders–that was the old\nfather in the shabby coat, he whom I had let in. He had little idea\nthat I had opened the door to him when he played his part as guest, but\nI, on my side, then had also no thought but for my own comedy-playing;\nthat is to say, I was at that time so much of a child that I played\nwith my puppet-theatre and made my dolls’ clothes; and in order that I\nmight obtain gaily-colored fragments for this purpose, I used to go to\nthe shops and ask for patterns of various kinds of stuffs and ribbons.\nI myself did not possess a single farthing; my landlady received all\nthe money each month in advance; only now and then, when I did any\nerrands for her, she gave me something, and that went in the purchase\nof paper or for old play-books. I was now very happy, and was doubly so\nbecause Professor Guldberg had induced Lindgron, the first comic actor\nat the theatre, to give me instruction. He gave me several parts in\nHolberg to learn, such as Hendrik, and the Silly Boy, for which I had\nshown some talent. My desire, however, was to play the Correggio. I\nobtained permission to learn this piece in my own way, although\nLindgron asked, with comic gravity, whether I expected to resemble the\ngreat painter? I, however, repeated to him the soliloquy in the picture\ngallery with so much feeling, that the old man clapped me on the\nshoulder and said, “Feeling you have; but you must not be an actor,\nthough God knows what else. Speak to Guldberg about your learning\nLatin: that always opens the way for a student.”",
        "I a student! That was a thought which had never come before into my\nhead. The theatre lay nearer to me, and was dearer too; but Latin I had\nalso always wished to learn. But before I spoke on the subject to\nGuldberg, I mentioned it to the lady who gave me gratuitous instruction\nin German; but she told me that Latin was the most expensive language\nin the world, and that it was not possible to gain free instruction  in\nit. Guldberg, however, managed it so that one of his friends, out of\nkindness, gave me two lessons a week.",
        "The dancer, Dahlen, whose wife at that time was one of the first\nartistes on the Danish boards, opened his house to me. I passed many an\nevening there, and the gentle, warm-hearted lady was kind to me. The\nhusband took me with him to the dancing-school, and that was to me one\nstep nearer to the theatre. There stood I for whole mornings, with a\nlong staff, and stretched my legs; but notwithstanding all my good-\nwill, it was Dahlen’s opinion that I should never get beyond a\nfigurante. One advantage, however, I had gained; I might in an evening\nmake my appearance behind the scenes of the theatre; nay, even sit upon\nthe farthest bench in the box of the figurantes. It seemed to me as if\nI had got my foot just within the theatre, although I had never yet\nbeen upon the stage itself.",
        "One night the little opera of the Two Little Savoyards was given; in\nthe market scene every one, even the mechanists, might go up to help in\nfilling the stage; I heard them say so, and rouging myself a little, I\nwent happily up with the others. I was in my ordinary dress; the\nconfirmation coat, which still held together, although, with regard to\nbrushing and repairs, it looked but miserably, and the great hat which\nfell down over my face. I was very conscious of the ill condition of my\nattire, and would have been glad to have concealed it; but, through the\nendeavor to do so, my movements became still more angular. I did not\ndare to hold myself upright, because, by so doing, I exhibited all the\nmore plainly the shortness of my waistcoat, which I had outgrown. I had\nthe feeling very plainly that people would make themselves merry about\nme; yet, at this moment, I felt nothing but the happiness of stepping\nfor the first time before the foot-lamps. My heart beat; I stepped\nforward; there came up one of the singers, who at that time was much\nthought of, but now is forgotten; he took me by the hand, and jeeringly\nwished me happiness on my d but. “Allow me to introduce you to the\nDanish public,” said he, and drew me forward to the lamps. The people\nwould laugh at me–I felt it; the tears rolled down my cheeks; I tore\nmyself loose, and left the stage full of anguish.",
        "Shortly after this, Dahlen arranged a ballet of Armida, in which I\nreceived a little part: I was a spirit. In this ballet I became\nacquainted with the lady of Professor Heiberg, the wife of the poet,\nand now a highly esteemed actress on the Danish stage; she, then a\nlittle girl, had also a part in it, and our names stood printed in the\nbill. That was a moment in my life, when my name was printed! I fancied\nI could see it a nimbus of immortality. I was continually looking at\nthe printed paper. I carried the programme of the ballet with me at\nnight to bed, lay and read my name by candle light–in short, I was\nhappy.",
        "I had now been two years in Copenhagen. The sum of money which had been\ncollected for me was expended, but I was ashamed of making known my\nwants and my necessities. I had removed to the house of a woman whose\nhusband, when living, was master of a trading-vessel, and there I had\nonly lodging and breakfast. Those were heavy, dark days for me.",
        "The lady believed that I went out to dine with various families, whilst\nI only ate a little bread on one of the benches in the royal garden.\nVery rarely did I venture into some of the lowest eating-houses, and\nchoose there the least expensive dish. I was, in truth, very forlorn;\nbut I did not feel the whole weight of my condition. Every person who\nspoke to me kindly I took for a faithful friend. God was with me in my\nlittle room; and many a night, when I have said my evening prayer, I\nasked of Him, like a child, “Will things soon be better with me?” I had\nthe notion, that as it went with me on New Year’s Day, so would it go\nwith me through the whole year; and my highest wishes were to obtain a\npart in a play.",
        "It was now New Year’s Day. The theatre was closed, and only a half-\nblind porter sat at the entrance to the stage, on which there was not a\nsoul. I stole past him with beating heart, got between the movable\nscenes and the curtain, and advanced to the open part of the stage.\nHere I fell down upon my knees, but not a single verse for declamation\ncould I recall to my memory. I then said aloud the Lord’s Prayer, and\nwent out with the persuasion, that because I had spoken from the stage\non New Year’s Day, I should in the course of the year succeed in\nspeaking still more, as well as in having a part assigned to me.",
        "During the two years of my residence in Copenhagen I had never been out\ninto the open country. Once only had I been in the park, and there I\nhad been deeply engrossed by studying the diversions of the people and\ntheir gay tumult. In the spring of the third year, I went out for the\nfirst time amid the verdure of a spring morning. It was into the garden\nof the Fredericksberg, the summer residence of Frederick VI. I stood\nstill suddenly under the first large budding beech tree. The sun made\nthe leaves transparent–there was a fragrance, a freshness–the birds\nsang. I was overcome by it–I shouted aloud for joy, threw my arms\naround the tree and kissed it.",
        "“Is he mad?” said a man close behind me. It was one of the servants of\nthe castle. I ran away, shocked at what I had heard, and then went\nthoughtfully and calmly back to the city.",
        "My voice had, in the mean time, in part regained its richness. The\nsinging master of the choir-school heard it, offered me a place in the\nschool, thinking that, by singing with the choir, I should acquire\ngreater freedom in the exercise of my powers on the stage. I thought\nthat I could see by this means a new way opened for me. I went from the\ndancing-school into the singing-school, and entered the choir, now as a\nshepherd, and now as a warrior. The theatre was my world. I had\npermission to go in the pit, and thus it fared ill with my Latin. I\nheard many people say that there was no Latin required for singing in\nthe choir, and that without the knowledge of this language it was\npossible to become a great actor. I thought there was good sense in\nthat, and very often, either with or without reason, excused myself\nfrom my Latin evening lesson. Guldberg became aware of this, and for\nthe first time I received a reprimand which almost crushed me to the\nearth. I fancy that no criminal could suffer more by hearing the\nsentence of death pronounced upon him. My distress of mind must have\nexpressed itself in my countenance, for he said “Do not act any more\ncomedy.” But it was no comedy to me.",
        "I was now to learn Latin no longer. I felt my dependence upon the\nkindness of others in such a degree as I had never done before.\nOccasionally I had had gloomy and earnest thoughts in looking forward\nto my future, because I was in want of the very necessaries of life; at\nother times I had the perfect thoughtlessness of a child.",
        "The widow of the celebrated Danish statesman, Christian Colbj÷rnsen,\nand her daughter, were the first ladies of high rank who cordially\nbefriended the poor lad; who listened to me with sympathy, and saw me\nfrequently. Mrs. von Colbj÷rnsen resided, during the summer, at\nBakkehus, where also lived the poet Rahbek and his interesting wife.\nRahbek never spoke to me; but his lively and kind-hearted wife often\namused herself with me. I had at that time again begun to write a\ntragedy, which I read aloud to her. Immediately on hearing the first\nscenes, she exclaimed, “But you have actually taken whole passages out\nof Oehlenschl ger and Ingemann.”",
        "“Yes, but they are so beautiful!” replied I in my simplicity, and read\non.",
        "One day, when I was going from her to Mrs. von Colbj÷rnsen, she gave me\na handful of roses, and said, “Will you take them up to her? It will\ncertainly give her pleasure to receive them from the hand of a poet.\"\nThese words were said half in jest; but it was the first time that\nanybody had connected my name with that of poet. It went through me,\nbody and soul, and tears filled my eyes. I know that, from this very\nmoment, my mind was awoke to writing and poetry. Formerly it had been\nmerely an amusement by way of variety from my puppet-theatre.",
        "At Bakkehus lived also Professor Thiele, a young student at that time,\nbut even then the editor of the Danish popular legends, and known to\nthe public as the solver of Baggesen’s riddle, and as the writer of\nbeautiful poetry. He was possessed of sentiment, true inspiration, and\nheart. He had calmly and attentively watched the unfolding of my mind,\nuntil we now became friends. He was one of the few who, at that time,\nspoke the truth of me, when other people were making themselves merry\nat my expense, and having only eyes for that which was ludicrous in me.\nPeople had called me, in jest, the little orator, and, as such, I was\nan object of curiosity. They found amusement in me, and I mistook every\nsmile for a smile of applause. One of my later friends has told me that\nit probably was about this period that he saw me for the first time. It\nwas in the drawing-room of a rich tradesman, where people were making\nthemselves very merry with me. They desired me to repeat one of my\npoems, and, as I did this with great feeling, the merriment was changed\ninto sympathy with me.",
        "I heard it said every day, what a good thing it would be for me if I\ncould study. People advised me to devote myself to science, but no one\nmoved one step to enable me to do so; it was labor enough for me to\nkeep body and soul together. It therefore occurred to me to write a\ntragedy, which I would offer to the Theatre Royal, and would then begin\nto study with the money which I should thus obtain. Whilst Guldberg\ninstructed me in Danish, I had written a tragedy from a German story,\ncalled The Chapel in the Wood; yet as this was done merely as an\nexercise in the language, and, as he forbade me in the most decided\nmanner to bring it out, I would not do so. I originated my own\nmaterial, therefore; and within fourteen days I wrote my national\ntragedy called the Robbers in Wissenberg (the name of a little village\nin Funen.) There was scarcely a word in it correctly written, as I had\nno person to help me, because I meant it to be anonymous; there was,\nnevertheless, one person admitted into the secret, namely, the young\nlady whom I had met with in Odense, during my preparation for\nconfirmation, the only one who at that time showed me kindness and\ngood-will. It was through her that I was introduced to the Colbj÷rnsen\nfamily, and thus known and received in all those circles of which the\none leads into the other. She paid some one to prepare a legible copy\nof my piece, and undertook to present it for perusal. After an interval\nof six weeks, I received it back, accompanied by a letter which said\nthe people did not frequently wish to retain works which betrayed, in\nso great a degree, a want of elementary knowledge.",
        "It was just at the close of the theatrical season, in May, 1823, that I\nreceived a letter from the directors, by which I was dismissed from the\nsinging and dancing school, the letter adding also, that my\nparticipation in the school-teaching could lead to no advantage for me,\nbut that they wished some of my many friends would enable me to receive\nan education, without which, talent availed nothing. I felt myself\nagain, as it were, cast out into the wide world without help and\nwithout support. It was absolutely necessary that I should write a\npiece for the theatre, and that must be accepted; there was no\nother salvation for me. I wrote, therefore, a tragedy founded on a\npassage in history, and I called it Alfsol. I was delighted with the\nfirst act, and with this I immediately went to the Danish translator of\nShakspeare, Admiral Wulff, now deceased, who good-naturedly heard me\nread it. In after years I met with the most cordial reception in his\nfamily. At that time I also introduced myself to our celebrated\nphysician Oersted, and his house has remained to me to this day an\naffectionate home, to which my heart has firmly attached itself, and\nwhere I find my oldest and most unchangeable friends.",
        "A favorite preacher, the rural dean Gutfeldt, was living at that time,\nand he it was who exerted himself most earnestly for my tragedy, which\nwas now finished; and having written a letter of recommendation, he\nsent it to the managers of the theatre. I was suspended between hope\nand fear. In the course of the summer I endured bitter want, but I told\nit to no one, else many a one, whose sympathy I had experienced, would\nhave helped me to the utmost of their means. A false shame prevented me\nfrom confessing what I endured. Still happiness filled my heart. I read\nthen for the first time the works of Walter Scott. A new world was\nopened to me: I forgot the reality, and gave to the circulating library\nthat which should have provided me with a dinner.",
        "The present conference councillor, Collin, one of the most\ndistinguished men of Denmark, who unites with the greatest ability the\nnoblest and best heart, to whom I looked up with confidence in all\nthings, who has been a second father to me, and in whose children I\nhave found brothers and sisters;–this excellent man I saw now for the\nfirst time. He was at that time director of the Theatre Royal, and\npeople universally told me that it would be the best thing for me if he\nwould interest himself on my behalf: it was either Oersted or Gutfeldt\nwho first mentioned me to him; and now for the first time I went to\nthat house which was to become so dear to me. Before the ramparts of\nCopenhagen were extended, this house lay outside the gate, and served\nas a summer residence to the Spanish Ambassador; now, however, it\nstands, a crooked, angular frame-work building, in a respectable\nstreet; an old-fashioned wooden balcony leads to the entrance, and a\ngreat tree spreads its green branches over the court and its pointed\ngables. It was to become a paternal house to me. Who does not willingly\nlinger over the description of home?",
        "I discovered only the man of business in Collin; his conversation was\ngrave and in few words. I went away, without expecting any sympathy\nfrom this man; and yet it was precisely Collin who in all sincerity\nthought for my advantage, and who worked for it silently, as he had\ndone for others, through the whole course of his active life. But at\nthat time I did not understand the apparent calmness with which he\nlistened, whilst his heart bled for the afflicted, and he always\nlabored for them with zeal and success, and knew how to help them. He\ntouched so lightly upon my tragedy, which had been sent to him, and on\naccount of which many people had overwhelmed me with flattering\nspeeches, that I regarded him rather as an enemy than a protector.",
        "In a few day I was sent for by the directors of the theatre, when\nRahbek gave me back my play as useless for the stage; adding, however,\nthat there were so many grains of corn scattered in it, that it was\nhoped, that perhaps, by earnest study, after going to school and the\nprevious knowledge of all that is requisite, I might, some time, be\nable to write a work which should be worthy of being acted on the\nDanish stage.",
        "In order therefore to obtain the means for my support and the necessary\ninstruction, Collin recommended me to King Frederick the Sixth, who\ngranted to me a certain sum annually for some years; and, by means of\nCollin also, the directors of the high schools allowed me to receive\nfree instruction in the grammar school at Slagelse, where just then a\nnew, and, as was said, an active rector was appointed. I was almost\ndumb with astonishment: never had I thought that my life would take\nthis direction, although I had no correct idea of the path which I had\nnow to tread. I was to go with the earliest mail to Slagelse, which lay\ntwelve Danish miles from Copenhagen, to the place where also the poets\nBaggesen and Ingemann had gone to school. I was to receive money\nquarterly from Collin; I was to apply to him in all cases, and he it\nwas who was to ascertain my industry and my progress.",
        "I went to him the second time to express to him my thanks. Mildly and\nkindly he said to me, “Write to me without restraint about everything\nwhich you require, and tell me how it goes with you.” From this hour I\nstruck root in his heart; no father could have been more to me than he\nwas, and is; none could have more heartily rejoiced in my happiness,\nand my after reception with the public; none have shared my sorrow more\nkindly; and I am proud to say that one of the most excellent men which\nDenmark possesses feels towards me as towards his own child. His\nbeneficence was conferred without his making me feel it painful either\nby word or look. That was not the case with every one to whom, in this\nchange of my fortunes, I had to offer my thanks; I was told to think of\nmy inconceivable happiness and my poverty; in Collin’s words was\nexpressed the warm-heartedness of a father, and to him it was that\nproperly I was indebted for everything.",
        "The journey was hastily determined upon, and I had yet for myself some\nbusiness to arrange. I had spoken to an acquaintance from Odense who\nhad the management of a small printing concern, for a widow, to get\n“Alfsal” printed, that I might, by the sale of the work, make a little\nmoney. Before, however, the piece was printed, it was necessary that I\nshould obtain a certain number of subscribers; but these were not\nobtained, and the manuscript lay in the printing-office, which, at the\ntime I went to fetch it away, was shut up. Some years afterwards,\nhowever, it suddenly made its appearance in print without my knowledge\nor my desire, in its unaltered shape, but without my name.",
        "On a beautiful autumn day I set off with the mail from Copenhagen to\nbegin my school-life in Slagelse. A young student, who a month before\nhad passed his first examination, and now was travelling home to\nJutland to exhibit himself there as a student, and to see once more his\nparents and his friends, sate at my side and exulted for joy over the\nnew life which now lay before him; he assured me that he should be the\nmost unhappy of human beings if he were in my place, and were again\nbeginning to go to the grammar school. But I travelled with a good\nheart towards the little city of Zealand. My mother received a joyful\nletter from me. I only wished that my father and the old grandmother\nyet lived, and could hear that I now went to the grammar school.",
