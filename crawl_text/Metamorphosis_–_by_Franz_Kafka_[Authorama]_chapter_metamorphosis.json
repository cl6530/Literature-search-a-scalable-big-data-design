        "One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he\nfound himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.\nHe lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a\nlittle he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and\ndivided by arches into stiff sections.  The bedding was\nhardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any\nmoment.  His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the\nsize of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he\nlooked.",
        "“What’s happened to me?” he thought.  It wasn’t a dream.\nHis room, a proper human room although a little too small,\nlay peacefully between its four familiar walls.  A\ncollection of textile samples lay spread out on the table –\nSamsa was a travelling salesman – and above it there hung a\npicture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated\nmagazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame.  It showed a\nlady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright,\nraising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower\narm towards the viewer.",
        "Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull\nweather.  Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane,\nwhich made him feel quite sad.  “How about if I sleep a\nlittle bit longer and forget all this nonsense”, he thought,\nbut that was something he was unable to do because he was\nused to sleeping on his right, and in his present state\ncouldn’t get into that position.  However hard he threw\nhimself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he\nwas.  He must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes\nso that he wouldn’t have to look at the floundering legs,\nand only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull pain\nthere that he had never felt before.",
        "“Oh, God”, he thought, “what a strenuous career it is that\nI’ve chosen!  Travelling day in and day out.  Doing business\nlike this takes much more effort than doing your own\nbusiness at home, and on top of that there’s the curse of\ntravelling, worries about making train connections, bad and\nirregular food, contact with different people all the time\nso that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly\nwith them.  It can all go to Hell!”  He felt a slight itch\nup on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on his back\ntowards the headboard so that he could lift his head better;\nfound where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with\nlots of little white spots which he didn’t know what to make\nof; and when he tried to feel the place with one of his legs\nhe drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it he\nwas overcome by a cold shudder.",
        "He slid back into his former position.  “Getting up early\nall the time”, he thought, “it makes you stupid.  You’ve got\nto get enough sleep.  Other travelling salesmen live a life\nof luxury.  For instance, whenever I go back to the guest\nhouse during the morning to copy out the contract, these\ngentlemen are always still sitting there eating their\nbreakfasts.  I ought to just try that with my boss; I’d get\nkicked out on the spot.  But who knows, maybe that would be\nthe best thing for me.  If I didn’t have my parents to think\nabout I’d have given in my notice a long time ago, I’d have\ngone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him\neverything I would, let him know just what I feel.  He’d\nfall right off his desk!  And it’s a funny sort of business\nto be sitting up there at your desk, talking down at your\nsubordinates from up there, especially when you have to go\nright up close because the boss is hard of hearing.  Well,\nthere’s still some hope; once I’ve got the money together to\npay off my parents’ debt to him – another five or six years\nI suppose – that’s definitely what I’ll do.  That’s when\nI’ll make the big change.  First of all though, I’ve got to\nget up, my train leaves at five.”",
        "And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest\nof drawers.  “God in Heaven!” he thought.  It was half past\nsix and the hands were quietly moving forwards, it was even\nlater than half past, more like quarter to seven.  Had the\nalarm clock not rung?  He could see from the bed that it had\nbeen set for four o’clock as it should have been; it\ncertainly must have rung.  Yes, but was it possible to\nquietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise?  True,\nhe had not slept peacefully, but probably all the more\ndeeply because of that.  What should he do now?  The next\ntrain went at seven; if he were to catch that he would have\nto rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not\npacked, and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and\nlively.  And even if he did catch the train he would not\navoid his boss’s anger as the office assistant would have\nbeen there to see the five o’clock train go, he would have\nput in his report about Gregor’s not being there a long time\nago.  The office assistant was the boss’s man, spineless,\nand with no understanding.  What about if he reported sick?\nBut that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in\nfifteen years of service Gregor had never once yet been ill.\nHis boss would certainly come round with the doctor from the\nmedical insurance company, accuse his parents of having a\nlazy son, and accept the doctor’s recommendation not to make\nany claim as the doctor believed that no-one was ever ill\nbut that many were workshy.  And what’s more, would he have\nbeen entirely wrong in this case?  Gregor did in fact, apart\nfrom excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel\ncompletely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.",
        "He was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to\ndecide to get out of the bed, when the clock struck quarter\nto seven.  There was a cautious knock at the door near his\nhead.  “Gregor”, somebody called – it was his mother – “it’s\nquarter to seven.  Didn’t you want to go somewhere?”  That\ngentle voice!  Gregor was shocked when he heard his own\nvoice answering, it could hardly be recognised as the voice\nhe had had before.  As if from deep inside him, there was a\npainful and uncontrollable squeaking mixed in with it, the\nwords could be made out at first but then there was a sort\nof echo which made them unclear, leaving the hearer unsure\nwhether he had heard properly or not.  Gregor had wanted to\ngive a full answer and explain everything, but in the\ncircumstances contented himself with saying: “Yes, mother,\nyes, thank-you, I’m getting up now.”  The change in Gregor’s\nvoice probably could not be noticed outside through the\nwooden door, as his mother was satisfied with this\nexplanation and shuffled away.  But this short conversation\nmade the other members of the family aware that Gregor,\nagainst their expectations was still at home, and soon his\nfather came knocking at one of the side doors, gently, but\nwith his fist.  “Gregor, Gregor”, he called, “what’s wrong?\"\nAnd after a short while he called again with a warning\ndeepness in his voice: “Gregor! Gregor!”  At the other side\ndoor his sister came plaintively: “Gregor? Aren’t you well?\nDo you need anything?”",
        "Gregor answered to both sides: “I’m ready, now”, making an\neffort to remove all the strangeness from his voice by\nenunciating very carefully and putting long pauses between\neach, individual word.  His father went back to his\nbreakfast, but his sister whispered: “Gregor, open the door,\nI beg of you.”  Gregor, however, had no thought of opening\nthe door, and instead congratulated himself for his cautious\nhabit, acquired from his travelling, of locking all doors at\nnight even when he was at home.",
        "The first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace\nwithout being disturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to\nhave his breakfast.  Only then would he consider what to do\nnext, as he was well aware that he would not bring his\nthoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in bed.  He\nremembered that he had often felt a slight pain in bed,\nperhaps caused by lying awkwardly, but that had always\nturned out to be pure imagination and he wondered how his\nimaginings would slowly resolve themselves today.  He did\nnot have the slightest doubt that the change in his voice\nwas nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold,\nwhich was an occupational hazard for travelling salesmen.",
        "It was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had\nto blow himself up a little and they fell off by themselves.\nBut it became difficult after that, especially as he was so\nexceptionally broad.  He would have used his arms and his\nhands to push himself up; but instead of them he only had\nall those little legs continuously moving in different\ndirections, and which he was moreover unable to control.  If\nhe wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first one\nthat would stretch itself out; and if he finally managed to\ndo what he wanted with that leg, all the others seemed to be\nset free and would move about painfully.  “This is\nsomething that can’t be done in bed”, Gregor said to\nhimself, “so don’t keep trying to do it”.",
        "The first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of\nhis body out of the bed, but he had never seen this lower\npart, and could not imagine what it looked like; it turned\nout to be too hard to move; it went so slowly; and finally,\nalmost in a frenzy, when he carelessly shoved himself\nforwards with all the force he could gather, he chose the\nwrong direction, hit hard against the lower bedpost, and\nlearned from the burning pain he felt that the lower part of\nhis body might well, at present, be the most sensitive.",
        "So then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the\nbed first, carefully turning his head to the side.  This he\nmanaged quite easily, and despite its breadth and its\nweight, the bulk of his body eventually followed slowly in\nthe direction of the head.  But when he had at last got his\nhead out of the bed and into the fresh air it occurred to\nhim that if he let himself fall it would be a miracle if his\nhead were not injured, so he became afraid to carry on\npushing himself forward the same way.  And he could not\nknock himself out now at any price; better to stay in bed\nthan lose consciousness.",
        "It took just as much effort to get back to where he had been\nearlier, but when he lay there sighing, and was once more\nwatching his legs as they struggled against each other even\nharder than before, if that was possible, he could think of\nno way of bringing peace and order to this chaos.  He told\nhimself once more that it was not possible for him to stay\nin bed and that the most sensible thing to do would be to\nget free of it in whatever way he could at whatever\nsacrifice.  At the same time, though, he did not forget to\nremind himself that calm consideration was much better than\nrushing to desperate conclusions.  At times like this he\nwould direct his eyes to the window and look out as clearly\nas he could, but unfortunately, even the other side of the\nnarrow street was enveloped in morning fog and the view had\nlittle confidence or cheer to offer him.  “Seven o’clock,\nalready”, he said to himself when the clock struck again,\n\"seven o’clock, and there’s still a fog like this.”  And he\nlay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as if he\nperhaps expected the total stillness to bring things back to\ntheir real and natural state.",
        "But then he said to himself: “Before it strikes quarter past\nseven I’ll definitely have to have got properly out of bed.\nAnd by then somebody will have come round from work to ask\nwhat’s happened to me as well, as they open up at work\nbefore seven o’clock.”  And so he set himself to the task of\nswinging the entire length of his body out of the bed all at\nthe same time.  If he succeeded in falling out of bed in\nthis way and kept his head raised as he did so he could\nprobably avoid injuring it.  His back seemed to be quite\nhard, and probably nothing would happen to it falling onto\nthe carpet.  His main concern was for the loud noise he was\nbound to make, and which even through all the doors would\nprobably raise concern if not alarm. But it was something\nthat had to be risked.",
        "When Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed –\nthe new method was more of a game than an effort, all he had\nto do was rock back and forth – it occurred to him how\nsimple everything would be if somebody came to help him.\nTwo strong people – he had his father and the maid in mind –\nwould have been more than enough; they would only have to\npush their arms under the dome of his back, peel him away\nfrom the bed, bend down with the load and then be patient\nand careful as he swang over onto the floor, where,\nhopefully, the little legs would find a use.  Should he\nreally call for help though, even apart from the fact that\nall the doors were locked?  Despite all the difficulty he\nwas in, he could not suppress a smile at this thought.",
        "After a while he had already moved so far across that it\nwould have been hard for him to keep his balance if he\nrocked too hard.  The time was now ten past seven and he\nwould have to make a final decision very soon.   Then there\nwas a ring at the door of the flat.  “That’ll be someone\nfrom work”, he said to himself, and froze very still,\nalthough his little legs only became all the more lively as\nthey danced around.  For a moment everything remained quiet.\n\"They’re not opening the door”, Gregor said to himself,\ncaught in some nonsensical hope.  But then of course, the\nmaid’s firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it.\nGregor only needed to hear the visitor’s first words of\ngreeting and he knew who it was – the chief clerk himself.\nWhy did Gregor have to be the only one condemned to work for\na company where they immediately became highly suspicious at\nthe slightest shortcoming?  Were all employees, every one of\nthem, louts, was there not one of them who was faithful and\ndevoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that he\ncouldn’t get out of bed if he didn’t spend at least a couple\nof hours in the morning on company business? Was it really\nnot enough to let one of the trainees make enquiries –\nassuming enquiries were even necessary – did the chief clerk\nhave to come himself, and did they have to show the whole,\ninnocent family that this was so suspicious that only the\nchief clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to\ninvestigate it?  And more because these thoughts had made\nhim upset than through any proper decision, he swang himself\nwith all his force out of the bed.   There was a loud thump,\nbut it wasn’t really a loud noise.  His fall was softened a\nlittle by the carpet, and Gregor’s back was also more\nelastic than he had thought, which made the sound muffled\nand not too noticeable.  He had not held his head carefully\nenough, though, and hit it as he fell; annoyed and in pain,\nhe turned it and rubbed it against the carpet.",
        "“Something’s fallen down in there”, said the chief clerk in\nthe room on the left.  Gregor tried to imagine whether\nsomething of the sort that had happened to him today could\never happen to the chief clerk too; you had to concede that\nit was possible.  But as if in gruff reply to this question,\nthe chief clerk’s firm footsteps in his highly polished\nboots could now be heard in the adjoining room.  From the\nroom on his right, Gregor’s sister whispered to him to let\nhim know: “Gregor, the chief clerk is here.”",
        "“Yes, I know”, said Gregor to himself; but without daring to\nraise his voice loud enough for his sister to hear him.",
        "“Gregor”, said his father now from the room to his left,\n\"the chief clerk has come round and wants to know why you\ndidn’t leave on the early train.  We don’t know what to say\nto him.  And anyway, he wants to speak to you personally.\nSo please open up this door.  I’m sure he’ll be good enough\nto forgive the untidiness of your room.”",
        "Then the chief clerk called “Good morning, Mr. Samsa”.",
        "“He isn’t well”, said his mother to the chief clerk, while\nhis father continued to speak through the door. “He isn’t\nwell, please believe me.  Why else would Gregor have missed\na train!  The lad only ever thinks about the business.  It\nnearly makes me cross the way he never goes out in the\nevenings; he’s been in town for a week now but stayed home\nevery evening.  He sits with us in the kitchen and just\nreads the paper or studies train timetables.  His idea of\nrelaxation is working with his fretsaw.  He’s made a little\nframe, for instance, it only took him two or three evenings,\nyou’ll be amazed how nice it is; it’s hanging up in his\nroom; you’ll see it as soon as Gregor opens the door.\nAnyway, I’m glad you’re here; we wouldn’t have been able to\nget Gregor to open the door by ourselves; he’s so stubborn;\nand I’m sure he isn’t well, he said this morning that he is,\nbut he isn’t.”",
        "“I’ll be there in a moment”, said Gregor slowly and\nthoughtfully, but without moving so that he would not miss\nany word of the conversation.  “Well I can’t think of any\nother way of explaining it, Mrs. Samsa”, said the chief\nclerk, “I hope it’s nothing serious.  But on the other hand,\nI must say that if we people in commerce ever become\nslightly unwell then, fortunately or unfortunately as you\nlike, we simply have to overcome it because of business\nconsiderations.”  “Can the chief clerk come in to see you\nnow then?”, asked his father impatiently, knocking at the\ndoor again.  “No”, said Gregor.  In the room on his right\nthere followed a painful silence; in the room on his left\nhis sister began to cry.",
        "So why did his sister not go and join the others?  She had\nprobably only just got up and had not even begun to get\ndressed.  And why was she crying?  Was it because he had not\ngot up, and had not let the chief clerk in, because he was\nin danger of losing his job and if that happened his boss\nwould once more pursue their parents with the same demands\nas before?  There was no need to worry about things like\nthat yet.  Gregor was still there and had not the slightest\nintention of abandoning his family.  For the time being he\njust lay there on the carpet, and no-one who knew the\ncondition he was in would seriously have expected him to let\nthe chief clerk in.  It was only a minor discourtesy, and a\nsuitable excuse could easily be found for it later on, it\nwas not something for which Gregor could be sacked on the\nspot.  And it seemed to Gregor much more sensible to leave\nhim now in peace instead of disturbing him with talking at\nhim and crying.  But the others didn’t know what was\nhappening, they were worried, that would excuse their\nbehaviour.  The chief clerk now raised his voice, “Mr.\nSamsa”, he called to him, “what is wrong?  You barricade\nyourself in your room, give us no more than yes or no for an\nanswer, you are causing serious and unnecessary concern to\nyour parents and you fail – and I mention this just by the\nway – you fail to carry out your business duties in a way\nthat is quite unheard of.  I’m speaking here on behalf of\nyour parents and of your employer, and really must request a\nclear and  immediate explanation.  I am astonished, quite\nastonished.  I thought I knew you as a calm and sensible\nperson, and now you suddenly seem to be showing off with\npeculiar whims.   This morning, your employer did suggest a\npossible reason for your failure to appear, it’s true – it\nhad to do with the money that was recently entrusted to you\n– but I came near to giving him my word of honour that that\ncould not be the right explanation.  But now that I see your\nincomprehensible stubbornness I no longer feel any wish\nwhatsoever to intercede on your behalf.  And nor is your\nposition all that secure.  I had originally intended to say\nall this to you in private, but since you cause me to waste\nmy time here for no good reason I don’t see why your parents\nshould not also learn of it.  Your turnover has been very\nunsatisfactory of late; I grant you that it’s not the time\nof year to do especially good business, we recognise that;\nbut there simply is no time of year to do no business at\nall, Mr. Samsa, we cannot allow there to be.”",
        "“But Sir”, called Gregor, beside himself and forgetting all\nelse in the excitement, “I’ll open up immediately, just a\nmoment.  I’m slightly unwell, an attack of dizziness, I\nhaven’t been able to get up.  I’m still in bed now.  I’m\nquite fresh again now, though.  I’m just getting out of bed.\nJust a moment.  Be patient!  It’s not quite as easy as I’d\nthought.  I’m quite alright now, though.  It’s shocking,\nwhat can suddenly happen to a person!  I was quite alright\nlast night, my parents know about it, perhaps better than\nme, I had a small symptom of it last night already.  They\nmust have noticed it.  I don’t know why I didn’t let you\nknow at work!  But you always think you can get over an\nillness without staying at home.  Please, don’t make my\nparents suffer!  There’s no basis for any of the accusations\nyou’re making; nobody’s ever said a word to me about any of\nthese things.  Maybe you haven’t read the latest contracts I\nsent in.  I’ll set off with the eight o’clock train, as\nwell, these few hours of rest have given me strength.  You\ndon’t need to wait, sir; I’ll be in the office soon after\nyou, and please be so good as to tell that to the boss and\nrecommend me to him!”  And while Gregor gushed out these\nwords, hardly knowing what he was saying, he made his way\nover to the chest of drawers – this was easily done,\nprobably because of the practise he had already had in bed –\nwhere he now tried to get himself upright.  He really did\nwant to open the door, really did want to let them see him\nand to speak with the chief clerk; the others were being so\ninsistent, and he was curious to learn what they would say\nwhen they caught sight of him.  If they were shocked then it\nwould no longer be Gregor’s responsibility and he could\nrest.  If, however, they took everything calmly he would\nstill have no reason to be upset, and if he hurried he\nreally could be at the station for eight o’clock.  The first\nfew times he tried to climb up on the smooth chest of\ndrawers he just slid down again, but he finally gave himself\none last swing and stood there upright; the lower part of\nhis body was in serious pain but he no longer gave any\nattention to it.  Now he let himself fall against the back\nof a nearby chair and held tightly to the edges of it with\nhis little legs.  By now he had also calmed down, and kept\nquiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was\nsaying.",
        "“Did you understand a word of all that?” the chief clerk\nasked his parents, “surely he’s not trying to make fools of\nus”.  “Oh, God!” called his mother, who was already in\ntears, “he could be seriously ill and we’re making him\nsuffer. Grete! Grete!” she then cried.  “Mother?” his sister\ncalled from the other side.  They communicated across\nGregor’s room.  “You’ll have to go for the doctor straight\naway.  Gregor is ill.  Quick, get the doctor.  Did you hear\nthe way Gregor spoke just now?\"\n\"That was the voice of an animal”, said the chief clerk,\nwith a calmness that was in contrast with his mother’s\nscreams.  “Anna! Anna!” his father called into the kitchen\nthrough the entrance hall, clapping his hands, “get a\nlocksmith here, now!”  And the two girls, their skirts\nswishing, immediately ran out through the hall, wrenching\nopen the front door of the flat as they went.  How had his\nsister managed to get dressed so quickly?  There was no\nsound of the door banging shut again; they must have left it\nopen;  people often do in homes where something awful has\nhappened.",
        "Gregor, in contrast, had become much calmer.  So they\ncouldn’t understand his words any more, although they seemed\nclear enough to him, clearer than before – perhaps his ears\nhad become used to the sound.  They had realised, though,\nthat there was something wrong with him, and were ready to\nhelp.  The first response to his situation had been\nconfident and wise, and that made him feel better.  He felt\nthat he had been drawn back in among people, and from the\ndoctor and the locksmith he expected great and surprising\nachievements – although he did not really distinguish one\nfrom the other.  Whatever was said next would be crucial,\nso, in order to make his voice as clear as possible, he\ncoughed a little, but taking care to do this not too loudly\nas even this might well sound different from the way that a\nhuman coughs and he was no longer sure he could judge this\nfor himself.  Meanwhile, it had become very quiet in the\nnext room.  Perhaps his parents were sat at the table\nwhispering with the chief clerk, or perhaps they were all\npressed against the door and listening.",
        "Gregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the\nchair.  Once there he let go of it and threw himself onto\nthe door, holding himself upright against it using the\nadhesive on the tips of his legs.  He rested there a little\nwhile to recover from the effort involved and then set\nhimself to the task of turning the key in the lock with his\nmouth.  He seemed, unfortunately, to have no proper teeth –\nhow was he, then, to grasp the key? – but the lack of teeth\nwas, of course, made up for with a very strong jaw; using\nthe jaw, he really was able to start the key turning,\nignoring the fact that he must have been causing some kind\nof damage as a brown fluid came from his mouth, flowed over\nthe key and dripped onto the floor.",
        "“Listen”, said the chief clerk in the next room, “he’s\nturning the key.”  Gregor was greatly encouraged by this;\nbut they all should have been calling to him, his father and\nhis mother too: “Well done, Gregor”, they should have cried,\n\"keep at it, keep hold of the lock!”  And with the idea that\nthey were all excitedly following his efforts, he bit on the\nkey with all his strength, paying no attention to the pain\nhe was causing himself.  As the key turned round he turned\naround the lock with it, only holding himself upright with\nhis mouth, and hung onto the key or pushed it down again\nwith the whole weight of his body as needed.  The clear\nsound of the lock as it snapped back was Gregor’s sign that\nhe could break his concentration, and as he regained his\nbreath he said to himself: “So, I didn’t need the locksmith\nafter all”.  Then he lay his head on the handle of the door\nto open it completely.",
        "Because he had to open the door in this way, it was already\nwide open before he could be seen.  He had first to slowly\nturn himself around one of the double doors, and he had to\ndo it very carefully if he did not want to fall flat on his\nback before entering the room.  He was still occupied with\nthis difficult movement, unable to pay attention to anything\nelse, when he heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud “Oh!”,\nwhich sounded like the soughing of the wind.  Now he also\nsaw him – he was the nearest to the door – his hand pressed\nagainst his open mouth and slowly retreating as if driven by\na steady and invisible force.  Gregor’s mother, her hair\nstill dishevelled from bed despite the chief clerk’s being\nthere, looked at his father.  Then she unfolded her arms,\ntook two steps forward towards Gregor and sank down onto the\nfloor into her skirts that spread themselves out around her\nas her head disappeared down onto her breast.  His father\nlooked hostile, and clenched his fists as if wanting to\nknock Gregor back into his room.  Then he looked uncertainly\nround the living room, covered his eyes with his hands and\nwept so that his powerful chest shook.",
        "So Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the\ninside of the other door which was still held bolted in\nplace.  In this way only half of his body could be seen,\nalong with his head above it which he leant over to one side\nas he peered out at the others.  Meanwhile the day had\nbecome much lighter; part of the endless, grey-black\nbuilding on the other side of the street – which was a\nhospital – could be seen quite clearly with the austere and\nregular line of windows piercing its facade; the rain was\nstill falling, now throwing down large, individual droplets\nwhich hit the ground one at a time.  The washing up from\nbreakfast lay on the table; there was so much of it because,\nfor Gregor’s father, breakfast was the most important meal\nof the day and he would stretch it out for several hours as\nhe sat reading a number of different newspapers.  On the\nwall exactly opposite there was photograph of Gregor when he\nwas a lieutenant in the army, his sword in his hand and a\ncarefree smile on his face as he called forth respect for\nhis uniform and bearing.  The door to the entrance hall was\nopen and as the front door of the flat was also open  he\ncould see onto the landing and the stairs where they began\ntheir way down below.",
        "“Now, then”, said Gregor, well aware that he was the only\none to have kept calm, “I’ll get dressed straight away now,\npack up my samples and set off.  Will you please just let me\nleave?   You can see”, he said to the chief clerk, “that I’m\nnot stubborn and like I like to do my job; being a\ncommercial traveller is arduous but without travelling I\ncouldn’t earn my living.  So where are you going, in to the\noffice? Yes?  Will you report everything accurately, then?\nIt’s quite possible for someone to be temporarily unable to\nwork, but that’s just the right time to remember what’s been\nachieved in the past and consider that later on, once the\ndifficulty has been removed, he will certainly work with all\nthe more diligence and concentration.  You’re well aware\nthat I’m seriously in debt to our employer as well as having\nto look after my parents and my sister, so that I’m trapped\nin a difficult situation, but I will work my way out of it\nagain.  Please don’t make things any harder for me than they\nare already, and don’t take sides against me at the office.\nI know that nobody likes the travellers.  They think we earn\nan enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it.\nThat’s just prejudice but they have no particular reason to\nthink better it.  But you, sir, you have a better overview\nthan the rest of the staff, in fact, if I can say this in\nconfidence, a better overview than the boss himself – it’s\nvery easy for a businessman like him to make mistakes about\nhis employees and judge them more harshly than he should.\nAnd you’re also well aware that we travellers spend almost\nthe whole year away from the office, so that we can very\neasily fall victim to gossip and chance and groundless\ncomplaints, and it’s almost impossible to defend yourself\nfrom that sort of thing, we don’t usually even hear about\nthem, or if at all it’s when we arrive back home exhausted\nfrom a trip, and that’s when we feel the harmful effects of\nwhat’s been going on without even knowing what caused them.\nPlease, don’t go away, at least first say something to show\nthat you grant that I’m at least partly right!”",
        "But the chief clerk had turned away as soon as Gregor had\nstarted to speak, and, with protruding lips, only stared\nback at him over his trembling shoulders as he left.  He did\nnot keep still for a moment while Gregor was speaking, but\nmoved steadily towards the door without taking his eyes off\nhim.  He moved very gradually, as if there had been some\nsecret prohibition on leaving the room.  It was only when he\nhad reached the entrance hall that he made a sudden\nmovement, drew his foot from the living room, and rushed\nforward in a panic.  In the hall, he stretched his right\nhand far out towards the stairway as if out there, there\nwere some supernatural force waiting to save him.",
        "Gregor realised that it was out of the question to let the\nchief clerk go away in this mood if his position in the firm\nwas not to be put into extreme danger.  That was something\nhis parents did not understand very well; over the years,\nthey had become convinced that this job would provide for\nGregor for his entire life, and besides, they had so much to\nworry about at present that they had lost sight of any\nthought for the future.  Gregor, though, did think about the\nfuture.  The chief clerk had to be held back, calmed down,\nconvinced and finally won over; the future of Gregor and his\nfamily depended on it!  If only his sister were here!  She\nwas clever; she was already in tears while Gregor was still\nlying peacefully on his back.   And the chief clerk was a\nlover of women, surely she could persuade him; she would\nclose the front door in the entrance hall and talk him out\nof his shocked state.  But his sister was not there, Gregor\nwould have to do the job himself.",
        "And without considering that he still was not familiar with\nhow well he could move about in his present state, or that\nhis speech still might not – or probably would not – be\nunderstood, he let go of  the door; pushed himself through\nthe opening; tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing\nwho, ridiculously, was holding on to the banister with both\nhands; but Gregor fell immediately over and, with a little\nscream as he sought something to hold onto, landed on his\nnumerous little legs.  Hardly had that happened than, for\nthe first time that day, he began to feel alright with his\nbody; the little legs had the solid ground under them; to\nhis pleasure, they did exactly as he told them; they were\neven making the effort to carry him where he wanted to go;\nand he was soon believing that all his sorrows would soon be\nfinally at an end.   He held back the urge to move but\nswayed from side to side as he crouched there on the floor.\nHis mother was not far away in front of him and seemed, at\nfirst, quite engrossed in herself, but then she suddenly\njumped up with her arms outstretched and her fingers spread\nshouting: “Help, for pity’s sake, Help!”  The way she held\nher head suggested she wanted to see Gregor better, but the\nunthinking way she was hurrying backwards showed that she\ndid not; she had forgotten that the table was behind her\nwith all the breakfast things on it; when she reached the\ntable she sat quickly down on it without knowing what she\nwas doing; without even seeming to notice that the coffee\npot had been knocked over and a gush of coffee was pouring\ndown onto the carpet.",
        "“Mother, mother”, said Gregor gently, looking up at her.  He\nhad completely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment, but\ncould not help himself snapping in the air with his jaws at\nthe sight of the flow of coffee.  That set his mother\nscreaming anew, she fled from the table and into the arms of\nhis father as he rushed towards her.  Gregor, though, had no\ntime to spare for his parents now; the chief clerk had\nalready reached the stairs; with his chin on the banister,\nhe looked back for the last time.  Gregor made a run for\nhim; he wanted to be sure of reaching him; the chief clerk\nmust have expected something, as he leapt down several steps\nat once and disappeared; his shouts resounding all around\nthe staircase.  The flight of the chief clerk seemed,\nunfortunately, to put Gregor’s father into a panic as well.\nUntil then he had been relatively self controlled, but now,\ninstead of running after the chief clerk himself, or at\nleast not impeding Gregor as he ran after him, Gregor’s\nfather seized the chief clerk’s stick in his right hand (the\nchief clerk had left it behind on a chair, along with his\nhat and overcoat), picked up a large newspaper from the\ntable with his left, and used them to drive Gregor back into\nhis room, stamping his foot at him as he went.  Gregor’s\nappeals to his father were of no help, his appeals were\nsimply not understood, however much he humbly turned his\nhead his father merely stamped his foot all the harder.",
        "Across the room, despite the chilly weather, Gregor’s mother\nhad pulled open a window, leant far out of it and pressed\nher hands to her face.  A strong draught of air flew in from\nthe street towards the stairway, the curtains flew up, the\nnewspapers on the table fluttered and some of them were\nblown onto the floor.  Nothing would stop Gregor’s father as\nhe drove him back, making hissing noises at him like a wild\nman.  Gregor had never had any practice in moving backwards\nand was only able to go very slowly.  If Gregor had only\nbeen allowed to turn round he would have been back in his\nroom straight away, but he was afraid that if he took the\ntime to do that his father would become impatient, and there\nwas the threat of a lethal blow to his back or head from the\nstick in his father’s hand any moment.  Eventually, though,\nGregor realised that he had no choice as he saw, to his\ndisgust, that he was quite incapable of going backwards in a\nstraight line; so he began, as quickly as possible and with\nfrequent anxious glances at his father, to turn himself\nround.  It went very slowly, but perhaps his father was able\nto see his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him,\nin fact now and then he used the tip of his stick to give\ndirections from a distance as to which way to turn.",
        "If only his father would stop that unbearable hissing!  It\nwas making Gregor quite confused.  When he had nearly\nfinished turning round, still listening to that hissing, he\nmade a mistake and turned himself back a little the way he\nhad just come.  He was pleased when he finally had his head\nin front of the doorway, but then saw that it was too\nnarrow, and his body was too broad to get through it without\nfurther difficulty.  In his present mood, it obviously did\nnot occur to his father to open the other of the double\ndoors so that Gregor would have enough space to get through.\nHe was merely fixed on the idea that Gregor should be got\nback into his room as quickly as possible.  Nor would he\never have allowed Gregor the time to get himself upright as\npreparation for getting through the doorway.  What he did,\nmaking more noise than ever, was to drive Gregor forwards\nall the harder as if there had been nothing in the way; it\nsounded to Gregor as if there was now more than one father\nbehind him; it was not a pleasant experience, and Gregor\npushed himself into the doorway without regard for what\nmight happen.  One side of his body lifted itself, he lay at\nan angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on the white door\nand was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks on it,\nsoon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move\nat all by himself, the little legs along one side hung\nquivering in the air while those on the other side were\npressed painfully against the ground.  Then his father gave\nhim a hefty shove from behind which released him from where\nhe was held and sent him flying, and heavily bleeding, deep\ninto his room.  The door was slammed shut with the stick,\nthen, finally, all was quiet.",
        "It was not until it was getting dark that evening that\nGregor awoke from his deep and coma-like sleep.   He would\nhave woken soon afterwards anyway even if he hadn’t been\ndisturbed, as he had had enough sleep and felt fully rested.\nBut he had the impression that some hurried steps and the\nsound of the door leading into the front room being\ncarefully shut had woken him.  The light from the electric\nstreet lamps shone palely here and there onto the ceiling\nand tops of the furniture, but down below, where Gregor was,\nit was dark.  He pushed himself over to the door, feeling\nhis way clumsily with his antennae – of which he was now\nbeginning to learn the value – in order to see what had been\nhappening there.  The whole of his left side seemed like\none, painfully stretched scar,  and he limped badly on his\ntwo rows of legs.  One of the legs had been badly injured in\nthe events of that morning – it was nearly a miracle that\nonly one of them had been – and dragged along lifelessly.\nIt was only when he had reached the door that he realised\nwhat it actually was that had drawn him over to it; it was\nthe smell of something to eat.  By the door there was a dish\nfilled with sweetened milk with little pieces of white bread\nfloating in it.  He was so pleased he almost laughed, as he\nwas even hungrier than he had been that morning, and\nimmediately dipped his head into the milk, nearly covering\nhis eyes with it.  But he soon drew his head back again in\ndisappointment; not only did the pain in his tender left\nside make it difficult to eat the food – he was only able to\neat if his whole body worked together as a snuffling whole –\nbut the milk did not taste at all nice.  Milk like this was\nnormally his favourite drink, and his sister had certainly\nleft it there for him because of that, but he turned, almost\nagainst his own will, away from the dish and crawled back\ninto the centre of the room.",
        "Through the crack in the door, Gregor could see that the gas\nhad been lit in the living room.  His father at this time\nwould normally be sat with his evening paper, reading it out\nin a loud voice to Gregor’s mother, and sometimes to his\nsister, but there was now not a sound to be heard. Gregor’s\nsister would often write and tell him about this reading,\nbut maybe his father had lost the habit in recent times.  It\nwas so quiet all around too, even though there must have\nbeen somebody in the flat.  “What a quiet life it is the\nfamily lead”, said Gregor to himself, and, gazing into the\ndarkness, felt a great pride that he was able to provide a\nlife like that in such a nice home for his sister and\nparents.  But what now, if all this peace and wealth and\ncomfort should come to a horrible and frightening end?  That\nwas something that Gregor did not want to think about too\nmuch, so he started to move about, crawling up and down the\nroom.",
        "Once during that long evening, the door on one side of the\nroom was opened very slightly and hurriedly closed again;\nlater on the door on the other side did the same; it seemed\nthat someone needed to enter the room but thought better of\nit.  Gregor went and waited immediately by the door,\nresolved either to bring the timorous visitor into the room\nin some way or at least to find out who it was; but the door\nwas opened no more that night and Gregor waited in vain.\nThe previous morning while the doors were locked everyone\nhad wanted to get in there to him, but now, now that he had\nopened up one of the doors and the other had clearly been\nunlocked some time during the day, no-one came, and the keys\nwere in the other sides.",
        "It was not until late at night that the gaslight in the\nliving room was put out, and now it was easy to see that\nparents and sister had stayed awake all that time, as they\nall could be distinctly heard as they went away together on\ntip-toe.  It was clear that no-one would come into Gregor’s\nroom any more until morning; that gave him plenty of time to\nthink undisturbed about how he would have to re-arrange his\nlife.  For some reason, the tall, empty room where he was\nforced to remain made him feel uneasy as he lay there flat\non the floor, even though he had been living in it for five\nyears.  Hardly aware of what he was doing other than a\nslight feeling of shame, he hurried under the couch.  It\npressed down on his back a little, and he was no longer able\nto lift his head, but he nonetheless felt immediately at\nease and his only regret was that his body was too broad to\nget it all underneath.  He spent the whole night there.\nSome of the time he passed in a light sleep, although he\nfrequently woke from it in alarm because of his hunger, and\nsome of the time was spent in worries and vague hopes which,\nhowever, always led to the same conclusion: for the time\nbeing he must remain calm, he must show patience and the\ngreatest consideration so that his family could bear the\nunpleasantness that he, in his present condition, was forced\nto impose on them.",
        "Gregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his\ndecisions, as early the next morning, almost before the\nnight had ended, his sister, nearly fully dressed, opened\nthe door from the front room and looked anxiously in.  She\ndid not see him straight away, but when she did notice him\nunder the couch – he had to be somewhere, for God’s sake, he\ncouldn’t have flown away – she was so shocked that she lost\ncontrol of herself and slammed the door shut again from\noutside.  But she seemed to regret her behaviour, as she\nopened the door again straight away and came in on tip-toe\nas if entering the room of someone seriously ill or even of\na stranger.  Gregor had pushed his head forward, right to\nthe edge of the couch, and watched her.  Would she notice\nthat he had left the milk as it was, realise that it was not\nfrom any lack of hunger and bring him in some other food\nthat was more suitable?  If she didn’t do it herself he\nwould rather go hungry than draw her attention to it,\nalthough he did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from\nunder the couch, throw himself at his sister’s feet and beg\nher for something good to eat.  However, his sister noticed\nthe full dish immediately and looked at it and the few drops\nof milk splashed around it with some surprise.  She\nimmediately picked it up – using a rag, not her bare hands –\nand carried it out.  Gregor was extremely curious as to what\nshe would bring in its place, imagining the wildest\npossibilities, but he never could have guessed what his\nsister, in her goodness, actually did bring.  In order to\ntest his taste, she brought him a whole selection of things,\nall spread out on an old newspaper.  There were old, half-\nrotten vegetables; bones from the evening meal, covered in\nwhite sauce that had gone hard; a few raisins and almonds;\nsome cheese that Gregor had declared inedible two days\nbefore; a dry roll and some bread spread with butter and\nsalt.  As well as all that she had poured some water into\nthe dish, which had probably been permanently set aside for\nGregor’s use, and placed it beside them.  Then, out of\nconsideration for Gregor’s feelings, as she knew that he\nwould not eat in front of her, she hurried out again and\neven turned the key in the lock so that Gregor would know he\ncould make things as comfortable for himself as he liked.\nGregor’s little legs whirred, at last he could eat. What’s\nmore, his injuries must already have completely healed as he\nfound no difficulty in moving.  This amazed him, as more\nthan a month earlier he had cut his finger slightly with a\nknife, he thought of how his finger had still hurt the day\nbefore yesterday.",
        "“Am I less sensitive than I used to be, then?”, he thought,\nand was already sucking greedily at the cheese which had\nimmediately, almost compellingly, attracted him much more\nthan the other foods on the newspaper.  Quickly one after\nanother, his eyes watering with pleasure, he consumed the\ncheese, the vegetables and the sauce; the fresh foods, on\nthe other hand, he didn’t like at all, and even dragged the\nthings he did want to eat a little way away from them\nbecause he couldn’t stand the smell.  Long after he had\nfinished eating and lay lethargic in the same place, his\nsister slowly turned the key in the lock as a sign to him\nthat he should withdraw.  He was immediately startled,\nalthough he had been half asleep, and he hurried back under\nthe couch.  But he needed great self-control to stay there\neven for the short time that his sister was in the room, as\neating so much food had rounded out his body a little and he\ncould hardly breathe in that narrow space.  Half\nsuffocating, he watched with bulging eyes as his sister\nunselfconsciously took a broom and swept up the left-overs,\nmixing them in with the food he had not even touched at all\nas if it could not be used any more.  She quickly dropped it\nall into a bin, closed it with its wooden lid, and carried\neverything out.  She had hardly turned her back before\nGregor came out again from under the couch and stretched\nhimself.",
        "This was how Gregor received his food each day now, once in\nthe morning while his parents and the maid were still\nasleep, and the second time after everyone had eaten their\nmeal at midday as his parents would sleep for a little while\nthen as well, and Gregor’s sister would send the maid away\non some errand.  Gregor’s father and mother certainly did\nnot want him to starve either, but perhaps it would have\nbeen more than they could stand to have any more experience\nof his feeding than being told about it, and perhaps his\nsister wanted to spare them what distress she could as they\nwere indeed suffering enough.",
        "It was impossible for Gregor to find out what they had told\nthe doctor and the locksmith that first morning to get them\nout of the flat.  As nobody could understand him, nobody,\nnot even his sister, thought that he could understand them,\nso he had to be content to hear his sister’s sighs and\nappeals to the saints as she moved about his room.  It was\nonly later, when she had become a little more used to\neverything – there was, of course, no question of her ever\nbecoming fully used to the situation – that Gregor would\nsometimes catch a friendly comment, or at least a comment\nthat could be construed as friendly.   “He’s enjoyed his\ndinner today”, she might say when he had diligently cleared\naway all the food left for him, or if he left most of it,\nwhich slowly became more and more frequent, she would often\nsay, sadly, “now everything’s just been left there again”.",
        "Although Gregor wasn’t able to hear any news directly he did\nlisten to much of what was said in the next rooms, and\nwhenever he heard anyone speaking he would scurry straight\nto the appropriate door and press his whole body against it.\nThere was seldom any conversation, especially at first, that\nwas not about him in some way, even if only in secret.  For\ntwo whole days, all the talk at every mealtime was about\nwhat they should do now; but even between meals they spoke\nabout the same subject as there were always at least two\nmembers of the family at home – nobody wanted to be at home\nby themselves and it was out of the question to leave the\nflat entirely empty.  And on the very first day the maid had\nfallen to her knees and begged Gregor’s mother to let her go\nwithout delay.  It was not very clear how much she knew of\nwhat had happened but she left within a quarter of an hour,\ntearfully thanking Gregor’s mother for her dismissal as if\nshe had done her an enormous service.  She even swore\nemphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what had\nhappened, even though no-one had asked that of her.  Now\nGregor’s sister also had to help his mother with the\ncooking; although that was not so much bother as no-one ate\nvery much.  Gregor often heard how one of them would\nunsuccessfully urge another to eat, and receive no more\nanswer than “no thanks, I’ve had enough” or something\nsimilar.  No-one drank very much either.  His sister would\nsometimes ask his father whether he would like a beer,\nhoping for the chance to go and fetch it herself.  When his\nfather then said nothing she would add, so that he would not\nfeel selfish, that she could send the housekeeper for it,\nbut then his father would close the matter with a big, loud\n\"No”, and no more would be said.",
        "Even before the first day had come to an end, his father had\nexplained to Gregor’s mother and sister what their finances\nand prospects were.  Now and then he stood up from the table\nand took some receipt or document from the little cash box\nhe had saved from his business when it had collapsed five\nyears earlier.  Gregor heard how he opened the complicated\nlock and then closed it again after he had taken the item he\nwanted.  What he heard his father say was some of the  first\ngood news that Gregor heard since he had first been\nincarcerated in his room.  He had thought that nothing at\nall remained from his father’s business, at least he had\nnever told him anything different, and Gregor had never\nasked him about it anyway.  Their business misfortune had\nreduced the family to a state of total despair, and Gregor’s\nonly concern at that time had been to arrange things so that\nthey could all forget about it as quickly as possible.  So\nthen he started working especially hard, with a fiery vigour\nthat raised him from a junior salesman to a travelling\nrepresentative almost overnight, bringing with it  the\nchance to earn money in quite different ways. Gregor\nconverted his success at work straight into cash that he\ncould lay on the table at home for the benefit of his\nastonished and delighted family.  They had been good times\nand they had never come again, at least not with the same\nsplendour, even though Gregor had later earned so much that\nhe was in a position to bear the costs of the whole family,\nand did bear them.  They had even got used to it, both\nGregor and the family, they took the money with gratitude\nand he was glad to provide it, although there was no longer\nmuch warm affection given in return.  Gregor only remained\nclose to his sister now.  Unlike him, she was very fond of\nmusic and a gifted and expressive violinist, it was his\nsecret plan to send her to the conservatory next year even\nthough it would cause great expense that would have to be\nmade up for in some other way.  During Gregor’s short\nperiods in town, conversation with his sister would often\nturn to the conservatory but it was only ever mentioned as a\nlovely dream that could never be realised.  Their parents\ndid not like to hear this innocent talk, but Gregor thought\nabout it quite hard and decided he would let them know what\nhe planned with a grand announcement of it on Christmas day.\nThat was the sort of totally pointless thing that went\nthrough his mind in his present state, pressed upright\nagainst the door and listening.  There were times when he\nsimply became too tired to continue listening, when his head\nwould fall wearily against the door and he would pull it up\nagain with a start, as even the slightest noise he caused\nwould be heard next door and they would all go silent.\n\"What’s that he’s doing now”, his father would say after a\nwhile, clearly having gone over to the door, and only then\nwould the interrupted conversation slowly be taken up again.",
        "When explaining things, his father repeated himself several\ntimes, partly because it was a long time since he had been\noccupied with these matters himself and partly because\nGregor’s mother did not understand everything first time.\nFrom these repeated explanations Gregor learned, to his\npleasure, that despite all their misfortunes there was still\nsome money available from the old days.  It was not a lot,\nbut it had not been touched in the meantime and some\ninterest had accumulated.  Besides that, they had not been\nusing up all the money that Gregor had been bringing home\nevery month, keeping only a little for himself, so that\nthat, too, had been accumulating.  Behind the door, Gregor\nnodded with enthusiasm in his pleasure at this unexpected\nthrift and caution.  He could actually have used this\nsurplus money to reduce his father’s debt to his boss, and\nthe day when he could have freed himself from that job would\nhave come much closer, but now it was certainly better the\nway his father had done things.",
        "This money, however, was certainly not enough to enable the\nfamily to live off the interest; it was enough to maintain\nthem for, perhaps, one or two years, no more.  That’s to\nsay, it was money that should not really be touched but set\naside for emergencies; money to live on had to be earned.\nHis father was healthy but old, and lacking in self\nconfidence.  During the five years that he had not been\nworking – the first holiday in a life that had been full of\nstrain and no success –  he had put on a lot of weight and\nbecome very slow and clumsy.  Would Gregor’s elderly mother\nnow have to go and earn money?  She suffered from asthma and\nit was a strain for her just to move about the home, every\nother day would be spent struggling for breath on the sofa\nby the open window.  Would his sister have to go and earn\nmoney?  She was still a child of seventeen, her life up till\nthen had been very enviable, consisting of wearing nice\nclothes, sleeping late, helping out in the business, joining\nin with a few modest pleasures and most of all playing the\nviolin.  Whenever they began to talk of the need to earn\nmoney, Gregor would always first let go of the door and then\nthrow himself onto the cool, leather sofa next to it, as he\nbecame quite hot with shame and regret.  He would often lie\nthere the whole night through, not sleeping a wink but\nscratching at the leather for hours on end.  Or he might go\nto all the effort of pushing a chair to the window, climbing\nup onto the sill and, propped up in the chair, leaning on\nthe window to stare out of it.  He had used to feel a great\nsense of freedom from doing this, but doing it now was\nobviously something more remembered than experienced,  as\nwhat he actually saw in this way was becoming less distinct\nevery day, even things that were quite near; he had used to\ncurse the ever-present view of  the hospital across the\nstreet, but now he could not see it at all, and if he had\nnot known that he lived in Charlottenstrasse, which was a\nquiet street despite being in the middle of the city, he\ncould have thought that he was looking out the window at a\nbarren waste where the grey sky and the grey earth mingled\ninseparably.  His observant sister only needed to notice the\nchair twice before she would always push it back to its\nexact position by the window after she had tidied up the\nroom, and even left the inner pane of the window open from\nthen on.",
        "If Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and\nthank her for all that she had to do for him it would have\nbeen easier for him to bear it; but as it was it caused him\npain.  His sister, naturally, tried as far as possible to\npretend there was nothing burdensome about it, and the\nlonger it went on, of course, the better she was able to do\nso, but as time went by Gregor was also able to see through\nit all so much better.  It had even become very unpleasant\nfor him, now, whenever she entered the room.  No sooner had\nshe come in than she would quickly close the door as a\nprecaution so that no-one would have to suffer the view into\nGregor’s room, then she would go straight to the window and\npull it hurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating.\nEven if it was cold, she would stay at the window breathing\ndeeply for a little while.  She would alarm Gregor twice a\nday with this running about and noise making; he would stay\nunder the couch shivering the whole while, knowing full well\nthat she would certainly have liked to spare him this\nordeal, but it was impossible for her to be in the same room\nwith him with the windows closed.",
        "One day, about a month after Gregor’s transformation when\nhis sister no longer had any particular reason to be shocked\nat his appearance, she came into the room a little earlier\nthan usual and found him still staring out the window,\nmotionless, and just where he would be most horrible.  In\nitself, his sister’s not coming into the room would have\nbeen no surprise for Gregor as it would have been difficult\nfor her to immediately open the window while he was still\nthere, but not only did she not come in, she went straight\nback and closed the door behind her, a stranger would have\nthought he had threatened her and tried to bite her.  Gregor\nwent straight to hide himself under the couch, of course,\nbut he had to wait until midday before his sister came back\nand she seemed much more uneasy than usual.  It made him\nrealise that she still found his appearance unbearable and\nwould continue to do so, she probably even had to overcome\nthe urge to flee when she saw the little bit of him that\nprotruded from under the couch.  One day, in order to spare\nher even this sight, he spent four hours carrying the\nbedsheet over to the couch on his back and arranged it so\nthat he was completely covered and his sister would not be\nable to see him even if she bent down.  If she did not think\nthis sheet was necessary then all she had to do was take it\noff again, as it was clear enough that it was no pleasure\nfor Gregor to cut himself off so completely.  She left the\nsheet where it was.  Gregor even thought he glimpsed a look\nof gratitude one time when he carefully looked out from\nunder the sheet to see how his sister liked the new\narrangement.",
        "For the first fourteen days, Gregor’s parents could not\nbring themselves to come into the room to see him.  He would\noften hear them say how they appreciated all the new work\nhis sister was doing even though, before, they had seen her\nas a girl who was somewhat useless and frequently been\nannoyed with her.  But now the two of them, father and\nmother, would often both wait outside the door of Gregor’s\nroom while his sister tidied up in there, and as soon as she\nwent out again she would have to tell them exactly how\neverything looked, what Gregor had eaten, how he had behaved\nthis time and whether, perhaps, any slight improvement could\nbe seen.  His mother also wanted to go in and visit Gregor\nrelatively soon but his father and sister at first persuaded\nher against it.  Gregor listened very closely to all this,\nand approved fully.  Later, though, she had to be held back\nby force, which made her call out: “Let me go and see\nGregor, he is my unfortunate son!  Can’t you understand I\nhave to see him?”, and Gregor would think to himself that\nmaybe it would be better if his mother came in, not every\nday of course, but one day a week, perhaps; she could\nunderstand everything much better than his sister who, for\nall her courage, was still just a child after all, and\nreally might not have had an adult’s appreciation of the\nburdensome job she had taken on.",
        " Gregor’s wish to see his mother was soon realised.  Out of\nconsideration for his parents, Gregor wanted to avoid being\nseen at the window during the day, the few square meters of\nthe floor did not give him much room to crawl about, it was\nhard to just lie quietly through the night, his food soon\nstopped giving him any pleasure at all, and so, to entertain\nhimself, he got into the habit of crawling up and down the\nwalls and ceiling.  He was especially fond of hanging from\nthe ceiling; it was quite different from lying on the floor;\nhe could breathe more freely; his body had a light swing to\nit; and up there, relaxed and almost happy, it might happen\nthat he would surprise even himself by letting go of the\nceiling and landing on the floor with a crash.  But now, of\ncourse, he had far better control of his body than before\nand, even with a fall as great as that, caused himself no\ndamage.  Very soon his sister noticed Gregor’s new way of\nentertaining himself – he had, after all, left traces of the\nadhesive from his feet as he crawled about – and got it into\nher head to make it as easy as possible for him by removing\nthe furniture that got in his way, especially the chest of\ndrawers and the desk.",
        "Now, this was not something that she would be able to do by\nherself; she did not dare to ask for help from her father;\nthe sixteen year old maid had carried on bravely since the\ncook had left but she certainly would not have helped in\nthis, she had even asked to be allowed to keep the kitchen\nlocked at all times and never to have to open the door\nunless it was especially important; so his sister had no\nchoice but to choose some time when Gregor’s father was not\nthere and fetch his mother to help her.  As she approached\nthe room, Gregor could hear his mother express her joy, but\nonce at the door she went silent.  First, of course, his\nsister came in and looked round to see that everything in\nthe room was alright; and only then did she let her mother\nenter.  Gregor had hurriedly pulled the sheet down lower\nover the couch and put more folds into it so that everything\nreally looked as if it had just been thrown down by chance.\nGregor also refrained, this time, from spying out from under\nthe sheet; he gave up the chance to see his mother until\nlater and was simply glad that she had come.  “You can come\nin, he can’t be seen”, said his sister, obviously leading\nher in by the hand.  The old chest of drawers was too heavy\nfor a pair of feeble women to be heaving about, but Gregor\nlistened as they pushed it from its place, his sister always\ntaking on the heaviest part of the work for herself and\nignoring her mother’s warnings that she would strain\nherself.  This lasted a very long time.  After labouring at\nit for fifteen minutes or more his mother said it would be\nbetter to leave the chest where it was, for one thing it was\ntoo heavy for them to get the job finished before Gregor’s\nfather got home and leaving it in the middle of the room it\nwould be in his way even more, and for another thing it\nwasn’t even sure that taking the furniture away would really\nbe any help to him.  She thought just the opposite; the\nsight of the bare walls saddened her right to her heart; and\nwhy wouldn’t Gregor feel the same way about it, he’d been\nused to this furniture in his room for a long time and it\nwould make him feel abandoned to be in an empty room like\nthat.",
        "Then, quietly, almost whispering as if wanting Gregor (whose\nwhereabouts she did not know) to hear not even the tone of\nher voice, as she was convinced that he did not understand\nher words, she added “and by taking the furniture away,\nwon’t it seem like we’re showing that we’ve given up all\nhope of improvement and we’re abandoning him to cope for\nhimself?  I think it’d be best to leave the room exactly the\nway it was before so that when Gregor comes back to us again\nhe’ll find everything unchanged and he’ll be able to forget\nthe time in between all the easier”.",
        "Hearing these words from his mother made Gregor realise that\nthe lack of any direct human communication, along with the\nmonotonous life led by the family during these two months,\nmust have made him confused – he could think of no other way\nof explaining to himself why he had seriously wanted his\nroom emptied out.  Had he really wanted to transform his\nroom into a cave, a warm room fitted out with the nice\nfurniture he had inherited?  That would have let him crawl\naround unimpeded in any direction, but it would also have\nlet him quickly forget his past when he had still been\nhuman.  He had come very close to forgetting, and it had\nonly been the voice of his mother, unheard for so long, that\nhad shaken him out of it.  Nothing should be removed;\neverything had to stay; he could not do without the good\ninfluence the furniture had on his condition; and if the\nfurniture made it difficult for him to crawl about\nmindlessly that was not a loss but a great advantage.",
        "His sister, unfortunately, did not agree; she had become\nused to the idea, not without reason, that she was Gregor’s\nspokesman to his parents about the things that concerned\nhim.  This meant that his mother’s advice now was sufficient\nreason for her to insist on removing not only the chest of\ndrawers and the desk, as she had thought at first, but all\nthe furniture apart from the all-important couch.  It was\nmore than childish perversity, of course, or the unexpected\nconfidence she had recently acquired, that made her insist;\nshe had indeed noticed that Gregor needed a lot of room to\ncrawl about in, whereas the furniture, as far as anyone\ncould see, was of no use to him at all.",
        "Girls of that age, though, do become enthusiastic about\nthings and feel they must get their way whenever they can.\nPerhaps this was what tempted Grete to make Gregor’s\nsituation seem even more shocking than it was so that she\ncould do even more for him.  Grete would probably be the\nonly one who would dare enter a room dominated by Gregor\ncrawling about the bare walls by himself.  So she refused to\nlet her mother dissuade her.  Gregor’s mother already looked\nuneasy in his room, she soon stopped speaking and helped\nGregor’s sister to get the chest of drawers out with what\nstrength she had.  The chest of drawers was something that\nGregor could do without if he had to, but the writing desk\nhad to stay.  Hardly had the two women pushed the chest of\ndrawers, groaning, out of the room than Gregor poked his\nhead out from under the couch to see what he could do about\nit.  He meant to be as careful and considerate as he could,\nbut, unfortunately, it was his mother who came back first\nwhile Grete in the next room had her arms round the chest,\npushing and pulling at it from side to side by herself\nwithout, of course, moving it an inch.  His mother was not\nused to the sight of Gregor, he might have made her ill, so\nGregor hurried backwards to the far end of the couch.  In\nhis startlement, though, he was not able to prevent the\nsheet at its front from moving a little.  It was enough to\nattract his mother’s attention.  She stood very still,\nremained there a moment, and then went back out to Grete.",
        "Gregor kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual\nwas happening, it was just a few pieces of furniture being\nmoved after all, but he soon had to admit that the women\ngoing to and fro, their little calls to each other, the\nscraping of the furniture on the floor, all these things\nmade him feel as if  he were being assailed from all sides.\nWith his head and legs pulled in against him and his body\npressed to the floor, he was forced to admit to himself that\nhe could not stand all of this much longer.  They were\nemptying his room out; taking away everything that was dear\nto him; they had already taken out the chest containing his\nfretsaw and other tools; now they threatened to remove the\nwriting desk with its place clearly worn into the floor, the\ndesk where he had done his homework as a business trainee,\nat high school, even while he had been at infant school – he\nreally could not wait any longer to see whether the two\nwomen’s intentions were good. He had nearly forgotten they\nwere there anyway, as they were now too tired to say\nanything while they worked and he could only hear their feet\nas they stepped heavily on the floor.",
        "So, while the women were leant against the desk in the other\nroom catching their breath, he sallied out, changed\ndirection four times not knowing what he should save first\nbefore his attention was suddenly caught by the picture on\nthe wall – which was already denuded of everything else that\nhad been on it – of the lady dressed in copious fur.   He\nhurried up onto the picture and pressed himself against its\nglass, it held him firmly and felt good on his hot belly.\nThis picture at least, now totally covered by Gregor, would\ncertainly be taken away by no-one.  He turned his head to\nface the door into the living room so that he could watch\nthe women when they came back.",
        "They had not allowed themselves a long rest and came back\nquite soon; Grete had put her arm around her mother and was\nnearly carrying her.  “What shall we take now, then?”, said\nGrete and looked around.  Her eyes met those of Gregor on\nthe wall.  Perhaps only because her mother was there, she\nremained calm, bent her face to her so that she would not\nlook round and said, albeit hurriedly and with a tremor in\nher voice: “Come on, let’s go back in the living room for a\nwhile?”  Gregor could see what Grete had in mind, she wanted\nto take her mother somewhere safe and then chase him down\nfrom the wall.  Well, she could certainly try it!  He sat\nunyielding on his picture.  He would rather jump at Grete’s\nface.",
        "But Grete’s words had made her mother quite worried, she\nstepped to one side, saw the enormous brown patch against\nthe flowers of the wallpaper, and before she even realised\nit was Gregor that she saw screamed: “Oh God, oh God!”  Arms\noutstretched, she fell onto the couch as if she had given up\neverything and stayed there immobile.  “Gregor!” shouted his\nsister, glowering at him and shaking her fist.  That was the\nfirst word she had spoken to him directly since his\ntransformation.  She ran into the other room to fetch some\nkind of smelling salts to bring her mother out of her faint;\nGregor wanted to help too – he could save his picture later,\nalthough he stuck fast to the glass and had to pull himself\noff by force; then he, too, ran into the next room as if he\ncould advise his sister like in the old days; but he had to\njust stand behind her doing nothing; she was looking into\nvarious bottles, he startled her when she turned round; a\nbottle fell to the ground and broke; a splinter cut Gregor’s\nface, some kind of caustic medicine splashed all over him;\nnow, without delaying any longer, Grete took hold of all the\nbottles she could and ran with them in to her mother; she\nslammed the door shut with her foot.  So now Gregor was shut\nout from his mother, who, because of him, might be near to\ndeath; he could not open the door if he did not want to\nchase his sister away, and she had to stay with his mother;\nthere was nothing for him to do but wait; and, oppressed\nwith anxiety and self-reproach, he began to crawl about, he\ncrawled over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling, and\nfinally in his confusion as the whole room began to spin\naround him he fell down into the middle of the dinner table.",
        "He lay there for a while, numb and immobile, all around him\nit was quiet, maybe that was a good sign.  Then there was\nsomeone at the door.  The maid, of course, had locked\nherself in her kitchen so that Grete would have to go and\nanswer it.  His father had arrived home.  “What’s happened?\"\nwere his first words; Grete’s appearance must have made\neverything clear to him.  She answered him with subdued\nvoice, and openly pressed her face into his chest: “Mother’s\nfainted, but she’s better now. Gregor got out.”  “Just as I\nexpected”, said his father, “just as I always said, but you\nwomen wouldn’t listen, would you.”",
        "It was clear to Gregor that Grete had not said enough and\nthat his father took it to mean that something bad had\nhappened, that he was responsible for some act of violence.\nThat meant Gregor would now have to try to calm his father,\nas he did not have the time to explain things to him even if\nthat had been possible.  So he fled to the door of his room\nand pressed himself against it so that his father, when he\ncame in from the hall, could see straight away that Gregor\nhad the best intentions and would go back into his room\nwithout delay, that it would not be necessary to drive him\nback but that they had only to open the door and he would\ndisappear.",
        "His father, though, was not in the mood to notice subtleties\nlike that; “Ah!”, he shouted as he came in, sounding as if\nhe were both angry and glad at the same time.  Gregor drew\nhis head back from the door and lifted it towards his\nfather.  He really had not imagined his father the way he\nstood there now; of late, with his new habit of crawling\nabout, he had neglected to pay attention to what was going\non the rest of the flat the way he had done before.  He\nreally ought to have expected things to have changed, but\nstill, still, was that really his father?  The same tired\nman as used to be laying there entombed in his bed when\nGregor came back from his business trips, who would receive\nhim sitting in the armchair in his nightgown when he came\nback in the evenings; who was hardly even able to stand up\nbut, as a sign of his pleasure, would just raise his arms\nand who, on the couple of times a year when they went for a\nwalk together on a Sunday or public holiday wrapped up\ntightly in his overcoat between Gregor and his mother, would\nalways labour his way forward a little more slowly than\nthem, who were already walking slowly for his sake; who\nwould place his stick down carefully and, if he wanted to\nsay something would invariably stop and gather his\ncompanions around him.",
        "He was standing up straight enough now; dressed in a smart\nblue uniform with gold buttons, the sort worn by the\nemployees at the banking institute; above the high, stiff\ncollar of the coat his strong double-chin emerged; under the\nbushy eyebrows, his piercing, dark eyes looked out fresh and\nalert; his normally unkempt white hair was combed down\npainfully close to his scalp.  He took his cap, with its\ngold monogram from, probably, some bank, and threw it in an\narc right across the room onto the sofa, put his hands in\nhis trouser pockets, pushing back the bottom of his long\nuniform coat, and, with look of determination, walked\ntowards Gregor.",
        "He probably did not even know himself what he had in mind,\nbut nonetheless lifted his feet unusually high.  Gregor was\namazed at the enormous size of the soles of his boots, but\nwasted no time with that – he knew full well, right from the\nfirst day of his new life, that his father thought it\nnecessary to always be extremely strict with him.  And so he\nran up to his father, stopped when his father stopped,\nscurried forwards again when he moved, even slightly.  In\nthis way they went round the room several times without\nanything decisive happening, without even giving the\nimpression of a chase as everything went so slowly.  Gregor\nremained all this time on the floor, largely because he\nfeared his father might see it as especially provoking if he\nfled onto the wall or ceiling.  Whatever he did, Gregor had\nto admit that he certainly would not be able to keep up this\nrunning about for long, as for each step his father took he\nhad to carry out countless movements.  He became noticeably\nshort of breath, even in his earlier life his lungs had not\nbeen very reliable.  Now, as he lurched about in his efforts\nto muster all the strength he could for running he could\nhardly keep his eyes open; his thoughts became too slow for\nhim to think of any other way of saving himself than\nrunning; he almost forgot that the walls were there for him\nto use although, here, they were concealed behind carefully\ncarved furniture full of notches and protrusions – then,\nright beside him, lightly tossed, something flew down and\nrolled in front of him.  It was an apple; then another one\nimmediately flew at him; Gregor froze in shock; there was no\nlonger any point in running as his father had decided to\nbombard him.  He had filled his pockets with fruit from the\nbowl on the sideboard and now, without even taking the time\nfor careful aim, threw one apple after another.  These\nlittle, red apples rolled about on the floor, knocking into\neach other as if they had electric motors.  An apple thrown\nwithout much force glanced against Gregor’s back and slid\noff without doing any harm.  Another one however,\nimmediately following it, hit squarely and lodged in his\nback; Gregor wanted to drag himself away, as if he could\nremove the surprising, the incredible pain by changing his\nposition; but he felt as if nailed to the spot and spread\nhimself out, all his senses in confusion.  The last thing he\nsaw was the door of his room being pulled open, his sister\nwas screaming, his mother ran out in front of her in her\nblouse (as his sister had taken off some of her clothes\nafter she had fainted to make it easier for her to breathe),\nshe ran to his father, her skirts unfastened and sliding one\nafter another to the ground, stumbling over the skirts she\npushed herself to his father, her arms around him, uniting\nherself with him totally – now Gregor lost his ability to\nsee anything – her hands behind his father’s head begging\nhim to spare Gregor’s life.",
        "No-one dared to remove the apple lodged in Gregor’s flesh,\nso it remained there as a visible reminder of his injury.\nHe had suffered it there for more than a month, and his\ncondition seemed serious enough to remind even his father\nthat Gregor, despite his current sad and revolting form, was\na family member who could not be treated as an enemy.  On\nthe contrary, as a family there was a duty to swallow any\nrevulsion for him and to be patient, just to be patient.\nBecause of his injuries, Gregor had lost much of his\nmobility – probably permanently.  He had been reduced to the\ncondition of an ancient invalid and it took him long, long\nminutes to crawl across his room – crawling over the ceiling\nwas out of the question – but this deterioration in his\ncondition was fully (in his opinion) made up for by the door\nto the living room being left open every evening.  He got\ninto the habit of closely watching it for one or two hours\nbefore it was opened and then, lying in the darkness of his\nroom where he could not be seen from the living room, he\ncould watch the family in the light of the dinner table and\nlisten to their conversation –  with everyone’s permission,\nin a way, and thus quite differently from before.",
        "They no longer held the lively conversations of earlier\ntimes, of course, the ones that Gregor always thought about\nwith longing when he was tired and getting into the damp bed\nin some small hotel room.  All of them were usually very\nquiet nowadays.  Soon after dinner, his father would go to\nsleep in his chair; his mother and sister would urge each\nother to be quiet; his mother, bent deeply under the lamp,\nwould sew fancy underwear for a fashion shop; his sister,\nwho had taken a sales job, learned shorthand and French in\nthe evenings so that she might be able to get a better\nposition later on.  Sometimes his father would wake up and\nsay to Gregor’s mother “you’re doing so much sewing again\ntoday!”, as if he did not know that he had been dozing – and\nthen he would go back to sleep again while mother and sister\nwould exchange a tired grin.  With a kind of stubbornness,\nGregor’s father refused to take his uniform off even at\nhome; while his nightgown hung unused on its peg Gregor’s\nfather would slumber where he was, fully dressed, as if\nalways ready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of his\nsuperior even here.  The uniform had not been new to start\nwith, but as a result of this it slowly became even shabbier\ndespite the efforts of Gregor’s mother and sister to look\nafter it.  Gregor would often spend the whole evening\nlooking at all the stains on this coat, with its gold\nbuttons always kept polished and shiny, while the old man in\nit would sleep, highly uncomfortable but peaceful.",
        "As soon as it struck ten, Gregor’s mother would speak gently\nto his father to wake him and try to persuade him to go to\nbed, as he couldn’t sleep properly where he was and he\nreally had to get his sleep if he was to be up at six to get\nto work.  But since he had been in work he had become more\nobstinate and would always insist on staying longer at the\ntable, even though he regularly fell asleep and it was then\nharder than ever to persuade him to exchange the chair for\nhis bed.  Then, however much mother and sister would\nimportune him with little reproaches and warnings he would\nkeep slowly shaking his head for a quarter of an hour with\nhis eyes closed and refusing to get up.  Gregor’s mother\nwould tug at his sleeve, whisper endearments into his ear,\nGregor’s sister would leave her work to help her mother, but\nnothing would have any effect on him.  He would just sink\ndeeper into his chair.  Only when the two women took him\nunder the arms he would abruptly open his eyes, look at them\none after the other and say: “What a life!  This is what\npeace I get in my old age!”  And supported by the two women\nhe would lift himself up carefully as if he were carrying\nthe greatest load himself, let the women take him to the\ndoor, send them off and carry on by himself while Gregor’s\nmother would throw down her needle and his sister her pen so\nthat they could run after his father and continue being of\nhelp to him.",
        "Who, in this tired and overworked family, would have had\ntime to give more attention to Gregor than was absolutely\nnecessary?  The household budget became even smaller; so now\nthe maid was dismissed; an enormous, thick-boned charwoman\nwith white hair that flapped around her head came every\nmorning and evening to do the heaviest work; everything else\nwas looked after by Gregor’s mother on top of the large\namount of sewing work she did.  Gregor even learned,\nlistening to the evening conversation about what price they\nhad hoped for, that several items of jewellery belonging to\nthe family had been  sold, even though both mother and\nsister had been very fond of wearing them at functions and\ncelebrations.  But the loudest complaint was that although\nthe flat was much too big for their present circumstances,\nthey could not move out of it, there was no imaginable way\nof transferring Gregor to the new address.  He could see\nquite well, though, that there were more reasons than\nconsideration for him that made it difficult for them to\nmove, it would have been quite easy to transport him in any\nsuitable crate with a few air holes in it; the main thing\nholding the family back from their decision to move was much\nmore to do with their total despair, and the thought that\nthey had been struck with a misfortune unlike anything\nexperienced by anyone else they knew or were related to.",
        "They carried out absolutely everything that the world\nexpects from poor people, Gregor’s father brought bank\nemployees their breakfast, his mother sacrificed herself by\nwashing clothes for strangers, his sister ran back and forth\nbehind her desk at the behest of the customers, but they\njust did not have the strength to do any more.  And the\ninjury in Gregor’s back began to hurt as much as when it was\nnew.  After they had come back from taking his father to bed\nGregor’s mother and sister would now leave their work where\nit was and sit close together, cheek to cheek; his mother\nwould point to Gregor’s room and say “Close that door,\nGrete”, and then, when he was in the dark again, they would\nsit in the next room and their tears would mingle, or they\nwould simply sit there staring dry-eyed at the table.",
        "Gregor hardly slept at all, either night or day.  Sometimes\nhe would think of taking over the family’s affairs, just\nlike before, the next time the door was opened; he had long\nforgotten about his boss and the chief clerk, but they would\nappear again in his thoughts, the salesmen and the\napprentices, that stupid teaboy, two or three friends from\nother businesses, one of the chambermaids from a provincial\nhotel, a tender memory that appeared and disappeared again,\na cashier from a hat shop for whom his attention had been\nserious but too slow, – all of them appeared to him, mixed\ntogether with strangers and others he had forgotten, but\ninstead of helping him and his family they were all of them\ninaccessible, and he was glad when they disappeared.",
        "Other times he was not at all in the mood to look after his\nfamily, he was filled with simple rage about the lack of\nattention he was shown, and although he could think of\nnothing he would have wanted, he made plans of how he could\nget into the pantry where he could take all the things he\nwas entitled to, even if he was not hungry.  Gregor’s sister\nno longer thought about how she could please him but would\nhurriedly push some food or other into his room with her\nfoot before she rushed out to work in the morning and at\nmidday, and in the evening she would sweep it away again\nwith the broom, indifferent as to whether it had been eaten\nor – more often than not – had been left totally untouched.\nShe still cleared up the room in the evening, but now she\ncould not have been any quicker about it.  Smears of dirt\nwere left on the walls, here and there were little balls of\ndust and filth.  At first, Gregor went into one of the worst\nof these places when his sister arrived as a reproach to\nher, but he could have stayed there for weeks without his\nsister doing anything about it; she could see the dirt as\nwell as he could but she had simply decided to leave him to\nit.",
        "At the same time she became touchy in a way that was quite\nnew for her and which everyone in the family understood –\ncleaning up Gregor’s room was for her and her alone.\nGregor’s mother did once thoroughly clean his room, and\nneeded to use several bucketfuls of water to do it –\nalthough that much dampness also made Gregor ill and he lay\nflat on the couch, bitter and immobile.  But his mother was\nto be punished still more for what she had done, as hardly\nhad his sister arrived home in the evening than she noticed\nthe change in Gregor’s room and, highly aggrieved, ran back\ninto the living room where, despite her mothers raised and\nimploring hands, she broke into convulsive tears.  Her\nfather, of course, was startled out of his chair and the two\nparents looked on astonished and helpless; then they, too,\nbecame agitated; Gregor’s father, standing to the right of\nhis mother, accused her of not leaving the cleaning of\nGregor’s room to his sister; from her left, Gregor’s sister\nscreamed at her that she  was never to clean Gregor’s room\nagain; while his mother tried to draw his father, who was\nbeside himself with anger, into the bedroom; his sister,\nquaking with tears, thumped on the table with her small\nfists; and Gregor hissed in anger that no-one had even\nthought of closing the door to save him the sight of this\nand all its noise.",
        "Gregor’s sister was exhausted from going out to work, and\nlooking after Gregor as she had done before was even more\nwork for her, but even so his mother ought certainly not to\nhave taken her place.  Gregor, on the other hand, ought not\nto be neglected.  Now, though, the charwoman was here.  This\nelderly widow, with a robust bone structure that made her\nable to withstand the hardest of things in her long life,\nwasn’t really repelled by Gregor.  Just by chance one day,\nrather than any real curiosity, she opened the door to\nGregor’s room and found herself face to face with him.  He\nwas taken totally by surprise, no-one was chasing him but he\nbegan to rush to and fro while she just stood there in\namazement with her hands crossed in front of her.  From then\non she never failed to open the door slightly every evening\nand morning and look briefly in on him.  At first she would\ncall to him as she did so with words that she probably\nconsidered friendly, such as “come on then, you old dung-\nbeetle!”, or “look at the old dung-beetle there!”  Gregor\nnever responded to being spoken to in that way, but just\nremained where he was without moving as if the door had\nnever even been opened.  If only they had told this\ncharwoman to clean up his room every day instead of letting\nher disturb him for no reason whenever she felt like it!\nOne day, early in the morning while a heavy rain struck the\nwindowpanes, perhaps indicating that spring was coming, she\nbegan to speak to him in that way once again.  Gregor was so\nresentful of it that he started to move toward her, he was\nslow and infirm, but it was like a kind of attack.  Instead\nof being afraid, the charwoman just lifted up one of the\nchairs from near the door and stood there with her mouth\nopen, clearly intending not to close her mouth until the\nchair in her hand had been slammed down into Gregor’s back.\n\"Aren’t you coming any closer, then?”, she asked when Gregor\nturned round again, and she calmly put the chair back in the\ncorner.",
        "Gregor had almost entirely stopped eating.  Only if he\nhappened to find himself next to the food that had been\nprepared for him he might take some of it into his mouth to\nplay with it, leave it there a few hours and then, more\noften than not, spit it out again.  At first he thought it\nwas distress at the state of his room that stopped him\neating, but he had soon got used to the changes made there.\nThey had got into the habit of putting things into this room\nthat they had room for anywhere else, and there were now\nmany such things as one of the rooms in the flat had been\nrented out to three gentlemen.  These earnest gentlemen –\nall three of them had full beards, as Gregor learned peering\nthrough the crack in the door one day – were painfully\ninsistent on things’ being tidy.  This meant not only in\ntheir own room but, since they had taken a room in this\nestablishment, in the entire flat and especially in the\nkitchen.  Unnecessary clutter was something they could not\ntolerate, especially if it was dirty.  They had moreover\nbrought most of their own furnishings and equipment with\nthem.  For this reason, many things had become superfluous\nwhich, although they could not be sold, the family did not\nwish to discard.  All these things found their way into\nGregor’s room.  The dustbins from the kitchen found their\nway in there too.  The charwoman was always in a hurry, and\nanything she couldn’t use for the time being she would just\nchuck in there.  He, fortunately, would usually see no more\nthan the object and the hand that held it.  The woman most\nlikely meant to fetch the things back out again when she had\ntime and the opportunity, or to throw everything out in one\ngo, but what actually happened was that they were left where\nthey landed when they had first been thrown unless Gregor\nmade his way through the junk and moved it somewhere else.\nAt first he moved it because, with no other room free where\nhe could crawl about, he was forced to, but later on he came\nto enjoy it although moving about in the way left him sad\nand tired to death and he would remain immobile for hours\nafterwards.",
        "The gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take their\nevening meal at home in the living room that was used by\neveryone, and so the door to this room was often kept closed\nin the evening.   But Gregor found it easy to give up having\nthe door open, he had, after all, often failed to make use\nof it when it was open and, without the family having\nnoticed it, lain in his room in its darkest corner.  One\ntime, though, the charwoman left the door to the living room\nslightly open, and it remained open when the gentlemen who\nrented the room came in in the evening and the light was put\non.  They sat up at the table where, formerly, Gregor had\ntaken his meals with his father and mother, they unfolded\nthe serviettes and picked up their knives and forks.\nGregor’s mother immediately appeared in the doorway with a\ndish of meat and soon behind her came his sister with a dish\npiled high with potatoes.  The food was steaming, and filled\nthe room with its smell.  The gentlemen bent over the dishes\nset in front of them as if they wanted to test the food\nbefore eating it, and the gentleman in the middle, who\nseemed to count as an authority for the other two, did\nindeed cut off a piece of meat while it was still in its\ndish, clearly wishing to establish whether it was\nsufficiently cooked or whether it should be sent back to the\nkitchen.  It was to his satisfaction, and Gregor’s mother\nand sister, who had been looking on anxiously, began to\nbreathe again and smiled.",
        "The family themselves ate in the kitchen.  Nonetheless,\nGregor’s father came into the living room before he went\ninto the kitchen, bowed once with his cap in his hand and\ndid his round of the table.  The gentlemen stood as one, and\nmumbled something into their beards.  Then, once they were\nalone, they ate in near perfect silence.  It seemed\nremarkable to Gregor that above all the various noises of\neating their chewing teeth could still be heard, as if they\nhad wanted to Show Gregor that you need teeth in order to\neat and it was not possible to perform anything with jaws\nthat are toothless however nice they might be.  “I’d like to\neat something”, said Gregor anxiously, “but not anything\nlike they’re eating.  They do feed themselves.  And here I\nam, dying!”",
        "Throughout all this time, Gregor could not remember having\nheard the violin being played, but this evening it began to\nbe heard from the kitchen.  The three gentlemen had already\nfinished their meal, the one in the middle had produced a\nnewspaper, given a page to each of the others, and now they\nleant back in their chairs reading them and smoking.  When\nthe violin began playing they became attentive, stood up and\nwent on tip-toe over to the door of the hallway where they\nstood pressed against each other.  Someone must have heard\nthem in the kitchen, as Gregor’s father called out: “Is the\nplaying perhaps unpleasant for the gentlemen?  We can stop\nit straight away.”",
        "“On the contrary”, said the middle gentleman, “would the young lady\nnot like to come in and play for us here in the room, where it is,\nafter all, much more cosy and comfortable?”  “Oh yes, we’d love to”,\ncalled back Gregor’s father as if he had been the violin player\nhimself.  The gentlemen stepped back into the room and waited.\nGregor’s father soon appeared with the music stand, his mother with\nthe music and his sister with the violin.  She calmly prepared\neverything for her to begin playing; his parents, who had never rented\na room out before and therefore showed an exaggerated courtesy towards\nthe three gentlemen, did not even dare to sit on their own chairs; his\nfather leant against the door with his right hand pushed in between\ntwo buttons on his uniform coat; his mother, though, was offered a\nseat by one of the gentlemen and sat – leaving the chair where the\ngentleman happened to have placed it – out of the way in a corner.",
        "His sister began to play; father and mother paid close\nattention, one on each side, to the movements of her hands.\nDrawn in by the playing, Gregor had dared to come forward a\nlittle and already had his head in the living room. Before,\nhe had taken great pride in how considerate he was but now\nit hardly occurred to him that he had become so thoughtless\nabout the others.  What’s more, there was now all the  more\nreason to keep himself hidden as he was covered in the dust\nthat lay everywhere in his room and flew up at the slightest\nmovement; he carried threads, hairs, and remains of food\nabout on his back and sides; he was much too indifferent to\neverything now to lay on his back and wipe himself on the\ncarpet like he had used to do several times a day.  And\ndespite this condition, he was not too shy to move forward a\nlittle onto the immaculate floor of the living room.",
        "No-one noticed him, though.  The family was totally\npreoccupied with the violin playing; at first, the three\ngentlemen had put their hands in their pockets and come up\nfar too close behind the music stand to look at all the\nnotes being played, and they must have disturbed Gregor’s\nsister, but soon, in contrast with the family, they\nwithdrew back to the window with their heads sunk and\ntalking to each other at half volume, and they stayed by the\nwindow while Gregor’s father observed them anxiously.  It\nreally now seemed very obvious that they had expected to\nhear some beautiful or entertaining violin playing but had\nbeen disappointed, that they had had enough of the whole\nperformance and it was only now out of politeness that they\nallowed their peace to be disturbed.   It was especially\nunnerving, the way they all blew the smoke from their\ncigarettes upwards from their mouth and noses.  Yet Gregor’s\nsister was playing so beautifully.  Her face was leant to\none side, following the lines of music with a careful and\nmelancholy expression.  Gregor crawled a little further\nforward, keeping his head close to the ground so that he\ncould meet her eyes if the chance came.  Was he an animal if\nmusic could captivate him so?  It seemed to him that he was\nbeing shown the way to the unknown nourishment he had been\nyearning for.  He was determined to make his way forward to\nhis sister and tug at her skirt to show her she might come\ninto his room with her violin, as no-one appreciated her\nplaying here as much as he would.  He never wanted to let\nher out of his room, not while he lived, anyway; his\nshocking appearance should, for once, be of some use to him;\nhe wanted to be at every door of his room at once to hiss\nand spit at the attackers; his sister should not be forced\nto stay with him, though, but stay of her own free will; she\nwould sit beside him on the couch with her ear bent down to\nhim while he told her how he had always intended to send her\nto the conservatory, how he would have told everyone about\nit last Christmas – had Christmas really come and gone\nalready? – if this misfortune hadn’t got in the way, and\nrefuse to let anyone dissuade him from it.  On hearing all\nthis, his sister would break out in tears of emotion, and\nGregor would climb up to her shoulder and kiss her neck,\nwhich, since she had been going out to work, she had kept\nfree without any necklace or collar.",
        "“Mr. Samsa!”, shouted the middle gentleman to Gregor’s\nfather, pointing, without wasting any more words, with his\nforefinger at Gregor as he slowly moved forward.  The violin\nwent silent, the middle of the three gentlemen first smiled\nat his two friends, shaking his head, and then looked back\nat Gregor.  His father seemed to think it more important to\ncalm the three gentlemen before driving Gregor out, even\nthough they were not at all upset and seemed to think Gregor\nwas more entertaining that the violin playing had been.  He\nrushed up to them with his arms spread out and attempted to\ndrive them back into their room at the same time as trying\nto block their view of Gregor with his body.  Now they did\nbecome a little annoyed, and it was not clear whether it was\nhis father’s behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning\nrealisation that they had had a neighbour like Gregor in the\nnext room without knowing it.  They asked Gregor’s father\nfor explanations, raised their arms like he had, tugged\nexcitedly at heir beards and moved back towards their room\nonly very slowly.  Meanwhile Gregor’s sister had overcome\nthe despair she had fallen into when her playing was\nsuddenly interrupted.  She had let her hands drop and let\nviolin and bow hang limply for a while but continued to look\nat the music as if still playing, but then she suddenly\npulled herself together, lay the instrument on her mother’s\nlap who still sat laboriously struggling for breath where\nshe was, and ran into the next room which, under pressure\nfrom her father, the three gentlemen were more quickly\nmoving toward.  Under his sister’s experienced hand, the\npillows and covers on the beds flew up and were put into\norder and she had already finished making the beds and\nslipped out again before the three gentlemen had reached the\nroom.  Gregor’s father seemed so obsessed with what he was\ndoing that he forgot all the respect he owed to his tenants.\nHe urged them and pressed them until, when he was already at\nthe door of the room, the middle of the three gentlemen\nshouted like thunder and stamped his foot and thereby\nbrought Gregor’s father to a halt.  “I declare here and\nnow”, he said, raising his hand and glancing at Gregor’s\nmother and sister to gain their attention too, “that with\nregard to the repugnant conditions that prevail in this flat\nand with this family” – here he looked briefly but\ndecisively at the floor – “I give immediate notice on my\nroom.  For the days that I have been living here I will, of\ncourse, pay nothing at all, on the contrary I will consider\nwhether to proceed with some kind of action for damages from\nyou, and believe me it would be very easy to set out the\ngrounds for such an action.”  He was silent and looked\nstraight ahead as if waiting for something.  And indeed, his\ntwo friends joined in with the words: “And we also give\nimmediate notice.”  With that, he took hold of the door\nhandle and slammed the door.",
        "Gregor’s father staggered back to his seat, feeling his way\nwith his hands, and fell into it; it looked as if he was\nstretching himself out for his usual evening nap but from\nthe uncontrolled way his head kept nodding it could be seen\nthat he was not sleeping at all.  Throughout all this,\nGregor had lain still where the three gentlemen had first\nseen him.  His disappointment at the failure of his plan,\nand perhaps also because he was weak from hunger, made it\nimpossible for him to move.  He was sure that everyone would\nturn on him any moment, and he waited.  He was not even\nstartled out of this state when the violin on his mother’s\nlap fell from her trembling fingers and landed loudly on the\nfloor.",
        "“Father, Mother”, said his sister, hitting the table with\nher hand as introduction, “we can’t carry on like this.\nMaybe you can’t see it, but I can.  I don’t want to call\nthis monster my brother, all I can say is: we have to try\nand get rid of it.  We’ve done all that’s humanly possible\nto look after it and be patient, I don’t think anyone could\naccuse us of doing anything wrong.”  “She’s absolutely\nright”, said Gregor’s father to himself.  His mother, who\nstill had not had time to catch her breath, began to cough\ndully, her hand held out in front of her and a deranged\nexpression in her eyes.",
        "Gregor’s sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her\nforehead.  Her words seemed to give Gregor’s father some\nmore definite ideas.  He sat upright, played with his\nuniform cap between the plates left by the three gentlemen\nafter their meal, and occasionally looked down at Gregor as\nhe lay there immobile.",
        "“We have to try and get rid of it”, said Gregor’s sister,\nnow speaking only to her father, as her mother was too\noccupied with coughing to listen, “it’ll be the death of\nboth of you, I can see it coming.  We can’t all work as hard\nas we have to and then come home to be tortured like this,\nwe can’t endure it.  I can’t endure it any more.”  And she\nbroke out so heavily in tears that they flowed down the face\nof her mother, and she wiped them away with mechanical hand\nmovements.  “My child”, said her father with sympathy and\nobvious understanding, “what are we to do?”  His sister just\nshrugged her shoulders as a sign of the helplessness that\nhad taken hold of her, displacing her earlier certainly when\nshe had broken into tears.",
        "“If he could just understand us”, said his father almost as\na question; his sister shook her hand vigorously through her\ntears as a sign that of that there was no question.",
        "“If he could just understand us”, repeated Gregor’s father,\nclosing his eyes in acceptance of his sister’s certainty\nthat that was quite impossible, “then perhaps we could come\nto some kind of arrangement with him.  But as it is ...”",
        "“It’s got to go”, shouted his sister, “that’s the only way,\nFather.  You’ve got to get rid of the idea that that’s\nGregor.  We’ve only harmed ourselves by believing it for so\nlong.  How can that be Gregor?  If it were Gregor he would\nhave seen long ago that it’s not possible for human beings\nto live with an animal like that and he would have gone of\nhis own free will.  We wouldn’t have a brother any more,\nthen, but we could carry on with our lives and remember him\nwith respect.  As it is this animal is persecuting us, it’s\ndriven out our tenants, it obviously wants to take over the\nwhole flat and force us to sleep on the streets.  Father,\nlook, just look”, she suddenly screamed, “he’s starting\nagain!”   In her alarm, which was totally beyond Gregor’s\ncomprehension, his sister even abandoned his mother as she\npushed herself vigorously out of her chair as if more\nwilling to sacrifice her own mother than stay anywhere near\nGregor.  She rushed over to behind her father, who had\nbecome excited merely because she was and stood up half\nraising his hands in front of Gregor’s sister as if to\nprotect her.",
        "But Gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone, least\nof all his sister.  All he had done was begin to turn round\nso that he could go back into his room, although that was in\nitself quite startling as his pain-wracked condition meant\nthat turning round required a great deal of effort and he\nwas using his head to help himself do it, repeatedly raising\nit and striking it against the floor.  He stopped and looked\nround.  They seemed to have realised his good intention and\nhad only been alarmed briefly.  Now they all looked at him\nin unhappy silence.  His mother lay in her chair with her\nlegs stretched out and pressed against each other, her eyes\nnearly closed with exhaustion; his sister sat next to his\nfather with her arms around his neck.",
        "“Maybe now they’ll let me turn round”, thought Gregor and\nwent back to work.  He could not help panting loudly with\nthe effort and had sometimes to stop and take a rest.  No-\none was making him rush any more, everything was left up to\nhim.  As soon as he had finally finished turning round he\nbegan to move straight ahead.  He was amazed at the great\ndistance that separated him from his room, and could not\nunderstand how he had covered that distance in his weak\nstate a little while before and almost without noticing it.\nHe concentrated on crawling as fast as he could and hardly\nnoticed that there was not a word, not any cry, from his\nfamily to distract him.",
        "He did not turn his head until he had reached the doorway.\nHe did not turn it all the way round as he felt his neck\nbecoming stiff, but it was nonetheless enough to see that\nnothing behind him had changed, only his sister had stood\nup.  With his last glance he saw that his mother had now\nfallen completely asleep.",
        "He was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly\nshut, bolted and locked.  The sudden noise behind Gregor so\nstartled him that his little legs collapsed under him. It\nwas his sister who had been in so much of a rush.  She had\nbeen standing there waiting and sprung forward lightly,\nGregor had not heard her coming at all, and as she turned\nthe key in the lock she said loudly to her parents “At\nlast!”.",
        "“What now, then?”, Gregor asked himself as he looked round\nin the darkness.  He soon made the discovery that he could\nno longer move at all.  This was no surprise to him, it\nseemed rather that being able to actually move around on\nthose spindly little legs until then was unnatural.  He also\nfelt relatively comfortable.  It is true that his entire\nbody was aching, but the pain seemed to be slowly getting\nweaker and weaker and would finally disappear altogether.\nHe could already hardly feel the decayed apple in his back\nor the inflamed area around it, which was entirely covered\nin white dust.  He thought back of his family with emotion\nand love.  If it was possible, he felt that he must go away\neven more strongly than his sister.  He remained in this\nstate of empty and peaceful rumination until he heard the\nclock tower strike three in the morning.  He watched as it\nslowly began to get light everywhere outside the window too.\nThen, without his willing it, his head sank down completely,\nand his last breath flowed weakly from his nostrils.",
        "When the cleaner came in early in the morning – they’d often\nasked her not to keep slamming the doors but with her\nstrength and in her hurry she still did, so that everyone in\nthe flat knew when she’d arrived and from then on it was\nimpossible to sleep in peace – she made her usual brief look\nin on Gregor and at first found nothing special.  She\nthought he was laying there so still on purpose, playing the\nmartyr; she attributed all possible understanding to him.\nShe happened to be holding  the long broom in her hand, so\nshe tried to tickle Gregor with it from the doorway.  When\nshe had no success with that she tried to make a nuisance of\nherself and poked at him a little, and only when she found\nshe could shove him across the floor with no resistance at\nall did she start to pay attention.  She soon realised what\nhad really happened, opened her eyes wide, whistled to\nherself, but did not waste time to yank open the bedroom\ndoors and shout loudly into the darkness of the bedrooms:\n\"Come and ’ave a look at this, it’s dead, just lying there,\nstone dead!”",
        "Mr. and Mrs. Samsa sat upright there in their marriage bed\nand had to make an effort to get over the  shock caused by\nthe cleaner before they could grasp what she was saying.\nBut then, each from his own side, they hurried out of bed.\nMr. Samsa threw the blanket over his shoulders, Mrs. Samsa\njust came out in her nightdress; and that is how they went\ninto Gregor’s room.  On the way they opened the door to the\nliving room where Grete had been sleeping since the three\ngentlemen had moved in; she was fully dressed as if she  had\nnever been asleep, and the paleness of her face seemed to\nconfirm this.  “Dead?”, asked Mrs. Samsa, looking at the\ncharwoman enquiringly, even though she could have checked\nfor herself and could have known it even without checking.\n\"That’s what I said”,  replied the cleaner, and to prove it\nshe gave Gregor’s body another shove with the broom, sending\nit sideways across the floor.  Mrs. Samsa made a movement as\nif she wanted to hold back the broom, but did not complete\nit.  “Now then”, said Mr. Samsa, “let’s give thanks to God\nfor that”.  He crossed himself, and the three women followed\nhis example.",
        "Grete, who had not taken her eyes from the corpse, said:\n\"Just look how thin he was.  He didn’t eat anything for so\nlong.  The food came out again just the same as when it went\nin”.  Gregor’s body was indeed completely dried up and flat,\nthey had not seen it until then, but now he was not lifted\nup on his little legs, nor did he do anything to make them\nlook away.",
        "“Grete, come with us in here for a little while”, said Mrs.\nSamsa with a pained smile, and Grete followed her parents\ninto the bedroom but not without looking back at the body.\nThe cleaner shut the door and opened the window wide.\nAlthough it was still early in the morning the fresh air had\nsomething of warmth mixed in with it.  It was already the\nend of March, after all.",
        "The three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked\nround in amazement for their breakfasts;  they had been\nforgotten about.  “Where is our breakfast?”, the middle\ngentleman asked the cleaner irritably.  She just put her\nfinger on her lips and made a quick and silent sign to the\nmen that they might like to come into Gregor’s room.  They\ndid so, and stood around Gregor’s corpse with their hands in\nthe pockets of their well-worn coats.  It was now quite\nlight in the room.",
        "Then the door of the bedroom opened and Mr. Samsa appeared\nin his uniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on\nthe other.  All of them had been crying a little; Grete now\nand then pressed her face against her father’s arm.",
        "“Leave my home.  Now!”, said Mr. Samsa, indicating the door\nand without letting the women from him.  “What do you\nmean?”, asked the middle of the three gentlemen somewhat\ndisconcerted, and he smiled sweetly.  The other two held\ntheir hands behind their backs and continually rubbed them\ntogether in gleeful anticipation of a loud quarrel which\ncould only end in their favour.  “I mean just what I said”,\nanswered Mr. Samsa, and, with his two companions, went in a\nstraight line towards the man.  At first, he stood there\nstill, looking at the ground as if the contents of his head\nwere rearranging themselves into new positions.  “Alright,\nwe’ll go then”, he said, and looked up at Mr. Samsa as if he\nhad been suddenly overcome with humility and wanted\npermission again from Mr. Samsa for his decision.  Mr. Samsa\nmerely opened his eyes wide and briefly nodded to him\nseveral times.  At that, and without delay, the man actually\ndid take long strides into the front hallway; his two\nfriends had stopped rubbing their hands some time before and\nhad been listening to what was being said.  Now they jumped\noff after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear that\nMr. Samsa might go into the hallway in front of them and\nbreak the connection with their leader.  Once there, all\nthree took their hats from the stand, took their sticks from\nthe holder, bowed without a word and left the premises.  Mr.\nSamsa and the two women followed them out onto the landing;\nbut they had had no reason to mistrust the men’ intentions\nand as they leaned over the landing they saw how the three\ngentlemen made slow but steady progress down the many steps.\nAs they turned the corner on each floor they disappeared and\nwould reappear a few moments later; the further down they\nwent, the more that the Samsa family lost interest in them;\nwhen a butcher’s boy, proud of posture with his tray on his\nhead, passed them on his way up and came nearer than they\nwere, Mr. Samsa and the women came away from the landing and\nwent, as if relieved, back into the flat.",
        "They decided the best way to make use of that day was for\nrelaxation and to go for a walk; not only had they earned a\nbreak from work but they were in serious need of it.  So\nthey sat at the table and wrote three letters of excusal,\nMr. Samsa to his employers, Mrs. Samsa to her contractor and\nGrete to her principal.  The cleaner came in while they were\nwriting to tell them she was going, she’d finished her work\nfor that morning.  The three of them at first just nodded\nwithout looking up from what they were writing, and it was\nonly when the cleaner still did not seem to want to leave\nthat they looked up in irritation.  “Well?”, asked Mr.\nSamsa.  The charwoman stood in the doorway with a smile on\nher face as if she had some tremendous good news to report,\nbut would only do it if she was clearly asked to.  The\nalmost vertical little ostrich feather on her hat, which had\nbeen source of irritation to Mr. Samsa all the time she had\nbeen working for them, swayed gently in all directions.\n\"What is it you want then?”, asked Mrs. Samsa, whom the\ncleaner had the most respect for.  “Yes”, she answered, and\nbroke into a friendly laugh that made her unable to speak\nstraight away, “well then, that thing in there, you needn’t\nworry about how you’re going to get rid of it.  That’s all\nbeen sorted out.”  Mrs. Samsa and Grete bent down over their\nletters as if intent on continuing with what they were\nwriting; Mr. Samsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start\ndescribing everything in detail but, with outstretched hand,\nhe made it quite clear that she was not to.  So, as she was\nprevented from telling them all about it, she suddenly\nremembered what a hurry she was in and, clearly peeved,\ncalled out “Cheerio then, everyone”, turned round sharply\nand left, slamming the door terribly as she went.",
        "“Tonight she gets sacked”, said Mr. Samsa, but he received\nno reply from either his wife or his daughter as the\ncharwoman seemed to have destroyed the peace they had only\njust gained.  They got up and went over to the window where\nthey remained with their arms around each other.  Mr. Samsa\ntwisted round in his chair to look at them and sat there\nwatching for a while.  Then he called out: “Come here, then.\nLet’s forget about all that old stuff, shall we.  Come and\ngive me a bit of attention”.  The two women immediately did\nas he said, hurrying over to him where they kissed him and\nhugged him and then they quickly finished their letters.\nAfter that, the three of them left the flat together, which\nwas something they had not done for months, and took the\ntram out to the open country outside the town.  They had the\ntram, filled with warm sunshine, all to themselves.  Leant\nback comfortably on their seats, they discussed their\nprospects and found that on closer examination they were not\nat all bad – until then they had never asked each other\nabout their work but all three had jobs which were very good\nand held particularly good promise for the future.  The\ngreatest improvement for the time being, of course, would be\nachieved quite easily by moving house; what they needed now\nwas a flat that was smaller and cheaper than the current one\nwhich had been chosen by Gregor, one that was in a better\nlocation and, most of all, more practical.  All the time,\nGrete was becoming livelier.  With all the worry they had\nbeen having of late her cheeks had become pale, but, while\nthey were talking, Mr. and Mrs. Samsa were struck, almost\nsimultaneously, with the thought of how their daughter was\nblossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady.  They\nbecame quieter.  Just from each other’s glance and almost\nwithout knowing it they agreed that it would soon be time to\nfind a good man for her.  And, as if in confirmation of\ntheir new dreams and good intentions, as soon as they\nreached their destination Grete was the first to get up and\nstretch out her young body.",
