        "I",
        "The Cardinal said very little to Percy when they met again that evening,\nbeyond congratulating him on the way he had borne himself with the Pope.\nIt seemed that the priest had done right by his extreme frankness. Then\nhe told him of his duties.",
        "Percy was to retain the couple of rooms that had been put at his\ndisposal; he was to say mass, as a rule, in the Cardinal’s oratory; and\nafter that, at nine, he was to present himself for instructions: he was\nto dine at noon with the Cardinal, after which he was to consider\nhimself at liberty till Ave Maria: then, once more he was to be at his\nmaster’s disposal until supper. The work he would principally have to do\nwould be the reading of all English correspondence, and the drawing up\nof a report upon it.",
        "Percy found it a very pleasant and serene life, and the sense of home\ndeepened every day. He had an abundance of time to himself, which he\noccupied resolutely in relaxation. From eight to nine he usually walked\nabroad, going sedately through the streets with his senses passive,\nlooking into churches, watching the people, and gradually absorbing the\nstrange naturalness of life under ancient conditions. At times it\nappeared to him like an historical dream; at times it seemed that there\nwas no other reality; that the silent, tense world of modern\ncivilisation was itself a phantom, and that here was the simple\nnaturalness of the soul’s childhood back again. Even the reading of the\nEnglish correspondence did not greatly affect him, for the stream of his\nmind was beginning to run clear again in this sweet old channel; and he\nread, dissected, analysed and diagnosed with a deepening tranquillity.",
        "There was not, after all, a great deal of news. It was a kind of lull\nafter storm. Felsenburgh was still in retirement; he had refused the\noffers made to him by France and Italy, as that of England; and,\nalthough nothing definite was announced, it seemed that he was confining\nhimself at present to an unofficial attitude. Meanwhile the Parliaments\nof Europe were busy in the preliminary stages of code-revision. Nothing\nwould be done, it was understood, until the autumn sessions.",
        "Life in Rome was very strange. The city had now become not only the\ncentre of faith but, in a sense, a microcosm of it. It was divided into\nfour huge quarters–Anglo-Saxon, Latin, Teutonic and Eastern–besides\nTrastevere, which was occupied almost entirely by Papal offices,\nseminaries, and schools. Anglo-Saxondom occupied the southwestern\nquarter, now entirely covered with houses, including the Aventine, the\nCelian and Testaccio. The Latins inhabited old Rome, between the Course\nand the river; the Teutons the northeastern quarter, bounded on the\nsouth by St. Laurence’s Street; and the Easterns the remaining quarter,\nof which the centre was the Lateran. In this manner the true Romans were\nscarcely conscious of intrusion; they possessed a multitude of their own\nchurches, they were allowed to revel in narrow, dark streets and hold\ntheir markets; and it was here that Percy usually walked, in a passion\nof historical retrospect. But the other quarters were strange enough,\ntoo. It was curious to see how a progeny of Gothic churches, served by\nnorthern priests, had grown up naturally in the Anglo-Saxon and Teutonic\ndistricts, and how the wide, grey streets, the neat pavements, the\nsevere houses, showed how the northerns had not yet realised the\nrequirements of southern life. The Easterns, on the other hand,\nresembled the Latins; their streets were as narrow and dark, their\nsmells as overwhelming, their churches as dirty and as homely, and their\ncolours even more brilliant.",
        "Outside the walls the confusion was indescribable. If the city\nrepresented a carved miniature of the world, the suburbs represented the\nsame model broken into a thousand pieces, tumbled in a bag and shot out\nat random. So far as the eye could see, on all sides from the roof of\nthe Vatican, there stretched an endless plain of house-roofs, broken by\nspires, towers, domes and chimneys, under which lived human beings of\nevery race beneath the sun. Here were the great manufactories, the\nmonster buildings of the new world, the stations, the schools, the\noffices, all under secular dominion, yet surrounded by six millions of\nsouls who lived here for love of religion. It was these who had\ndespaired of modern life, tired out with change and effort, who had fled\nfrom the new system for refuge to the Church, but who could not obtain\nleave to live in the city itself. New houses were continually springing\nup in all directions. A gigantic compass, fixed by one leg in Rome, and\nwith a span of five miles, would, if twirled, revolve through packed\nstreets through its entire circle. Beyond that too houses stretched into\nthe indefinite distance.",
        "But Percy did not realise the significance of all that he saw, until the\noccasion of the Pope’s name-day towards the end of August.",
        "It was yet cool and early, when he followed his patron, whom he was to\nserve as chaplain, along the broad passages of the Vatican towards the\nroom where the Pope and Cardinals were to assemble. Through a window, as\nhe looked out into the Piazza, the crowd was yet more dense, if that\nwere possible, than it had been an hour before. The huge oval square was\ncobbled with heads, through which ran a broad road, kept by papal troops\nfor the passage of the carriages; and up the broad ribbon, white in the\neastern light, came monstrous vehicles, a blaze of gilding and colour\nand cream tint; slow cheers swelled up and died, and through all came\nthe rush and patter of wheels over the stones, like the sound of a\ntide-swept pebbly beach.",
        "As they waited in an ante-chamber, halted by the pressure in front and\nbehind–a pack of scarlet and white and purple–he looked out again, and\nrealised what he had known only intellectually before, that here before\nhis eyes was the royalty of the old world assembled–and he began to\nperceive its significance.",
        "Round the steps of the basilica spread a great fan of coaches, each\nyoked to eight horses–the white of France and Spain, the black of\nGermany, Italy and Russia, and the cream-coloured of England. Those\nstood out in the near half-circle, and beyond was the sweep of the\nlesser powers: Greece, Norway, Sweden, Roumania and the Balkan States.\nOne, the Turk, was alone wanting, he reminded himself. The emblems of\nsome were visible–eagles, lions, leopards–guarding the royal crown\nabove the roof of each. From the foot of the steps to the head ran a\nbroad scarlet carpet, lined with soldiers.",
        "Percy leaned against the shutter, and began to meditate. Here was all\nthat was left of Royalty. He had seen their palaces before, here and\nthere in the various quarters, with standards flying, and\nscarlet-liveried men lounging on the steps. He had raised his hat a\ndozen times as a landau thundered past him up the Course; be had even\nseen the lilies of France and the leopards of England pass together in\nthe solemn parade of the Pincian Hill. He had read in the papers every\nnow and again during the last five years that family after family had\nmade its way to Rome, after papal recognition had been granted; he had\nbeen told by the Cardinal on the previous evening that William of\nEngland, with his Consort, had landed at Ostia in the morning and that\nthe tale of the Powers was complete. But he had never before realised\nthe stupendous, overwhelming fact of the assembly of the world’s royalty\nunder the shadow of Peter’s Throne, nor the appalling danger that its\npresence constituted in the midst of a democratic world. That world, he\nknew, affected to laugh at the folly and the childishness of it all–at\nthe desperate play-acting of Divine Right on the part of fallen and\ndespised families; but the same world, he knew very well, had not yet\nlost quite all its sentiment; and if that sentiment should happen to\nbecome resentful–-",
        "The pressure relaxed; Percy slipped out of the recess, and followed in\nthe slow-moving stream.",
        "Half-an-hour later he was in his place among the ecclesiastics, as the\npapal procession came out through the glimmering dusk of the chapel of\nthe Blessed Sacrament into the nave of the enormous church; but even\nbefore he had entered the chapel he heard the quiet roar of recognition\nand the cry of the trumpets that greeted the Supreme Pontiff as he came\nout, a hundred yards ahead, borne on the sedia gestatoria, with the\nfans going behind him. When Percy himself came out, five minutes later,\nwalking in his quaternion, and saw the sight that was waiting, he\nremembered with a sudden throb at his heart that other sight he had seen\nin London in a summer dawn three months before....",
        "Far ahead, seeming to cleave its way through the surging heads, like the\npoop of an ancient ship, moved the canopy beneath which sat the Lord of\nthe world, and between him and the priest, as if it were the wake of\nthat same ship, swayed the gorgeous procession–Protonotaries Apostolic,\nGenerals of Religious Orders and the rest–making its way along with\nwhite, gold, scarlet and silver foam between the living banks on either\nside. Overhead hung the splendid barrel of the roof, and far in front\nthe haven of God’s altar reared its monstrous pillars, beneath which\nburned the seven yellow stars that were the harbour lights of sanctity.\nIt was an astonishing sight, but too vast and bewildering to do anything\nbut oppress the observers with a consciousness of their own futility.\nThe enormous enclosed air, the giant statues, the dim and distant roofs,\nthe indescribable concert of sound–of the movement of feet, the murmur\nof ten thousand voices, the peal of organs like the crying of gnats, the\nthin celestial music–the faint suggestive smell of incense and men and\nbruised bay and myrtle–and, supreme above all, the vibrant atmosphere\nof human emotion, shot with supernatural aspiration, as the Hope of the\nWorld, the holder of Divine Vice-Royalty, passed on his way to stand\nbetween God and man–this affected the priest as the action of a drug\nthat at once lulls and stimulates, that blinds while it gives new\nvision, that deafens while it opens stopped ears, that exalts while it\nplunges into new gulfs of consciousness. Here, then, was the other\nformulated answer to the problem of life. The two Cities of Augustine\nlay for him to choose. The one was that of a world self-originated,\nself-organised and self-sufficient, interpreted by such men as Marx and\nHerve, socialists, materialists, and, in the end, hedonists, summed up\nat last in Felsenburgh. The other lay displayed in the sight he saw\nbefore him, telling of a Creator and of a creation, of a Divine purpose,\na redemption, and a world transcendent and eternal from which all sprang\nand to which all moved. One of the two, John and Julian, was the Vicar,\nand the other the Ape, of God.... And Percy’s heart in one more spasm of\nconviction made its choice....",
        "But the summit was not yet reached.",
        "As Percy came at last out from the nave beneath the dome, on his way to\nthe tribune beyond the papal throne, he became aware of a new element.",
        "A great space was cleared about the altar and confession, extending, as\nhe could see at least on his side, to the point that marked the entrance\nto the transepts; at this point ran rails straight across from side to\nside, continuing the lines of the nave. Beyond this red-hung barrier lay\na gradual slope of faces, white and motionless; a glimmer of steel\nbounded it, and above, a third of the distance down the transept, rose\nin solemn serried array a line of canopies. These were of scarlet, like\ncardinalitial baldachini, but upon the upright surface of each burned\ngigantic coats supported by beasts and topped by crowns. Under each was\na figure or two–no more–in splendid isolation, and through the\ninterspaces between the thrones showed again a misty slope of faces.",
        "His heart quickened as he saw it–as he swept his eyes round and across\nto the right and saw as in a mirror the replica of the left in the right\ntransept. It was there then that they sat–those lonely survivors of\nthat strange company of persons who, till half-a-century ago, had\nreigned as God’s temporal Vicegerents with the consent of their\nsubjects. They were unrecognised, now, save by Him from whom they drew\ntheir sovereignty–pinnacles clustering and hanging from a dome, from\nwhich the walls had been withdrawn. These were men and women who had\nlearned at last that power comes from above, and their title to rule\ncame not from their subjects but from the Supreme Ruler of\nall–shepherds without sheep, captains without soldiers to command. It\nwas piteous–horribly piteous, yet inspiring. The act of faith was so\nsublime; and Percy’s heart quickened as he understood it. These, then,\nmen and women like himself, were not ashamed to appeal from man to God,\nto assume insignia which the world regarded as playthings, but which to\nthem were emblems of supernatural commission. Was there not mirrored\nhere, he asked himself, some far-off shadow of One Who rode on the colt\nof an ass amid the sneers of the great and the enthusiasm of\nchildren?...",
        "It was yet more kindling as the mass went on, and he saw the male\nsovereigns come down to do their services at the altar, and to go to and\nfro between it and the Throne. There they went bareheaded, the stately\nsilent figures. The English king, once again Fidei Defensor, bore the\ntrain in place of the old king of Spain, who, with the Austrian Emperor,\nalone of all European sovereigns, had preserved the unbroken continuity\nof faith. The old man leaned over his fald-stool, mumbling and weeping,\neven crying out now and again in love and devotion, as, like Simeon, he\nsaw his Salvation. The Austrian Emperor twice administered the Lavabo;\nthe German sovereign, who had lost his throne and all but his life upon\nhis conversion four years before, by a new privilege placed and withdrew\nthe cushion, as his Lord kneeled before the Lord of them both. So\nmovement by movement the gorgeous drama was enacted; the murmuring of\nthe crowds died to a stillness that was but one wordless prayer as the\ntiny White Disc rose between the white hands, and the thin angelic music\npealed in the dome. For here was the one hope of these thousands, as\nmighty and as little as once within the Manger. There was none other\nthat fought for them but only God. Surely then, if the blood of men and\nthe tears of women could not avail to move the Judge and Observer of all\nfrom His silence, surely at least here the bloodless Death of His only\nSon, that once on Calvary had darkened heaven and rent the earth,\npleaded now with such sorrowful splendour upon this island of faith amid\na sea of laughter and hatred–this at least must avail! How could it\nnot?",
        "Percy had just sat down, tired out with the long ceremonies, when the\ndoor opened abruptly, and the Cardinal, still in his robes, came in\nswiftly, shutting the door behind him.",
        "“Father Franklin,” he said, in a strange breathless voice, “there is the\nworst of news. Felsenburgh is appointed President of Europe.”",
