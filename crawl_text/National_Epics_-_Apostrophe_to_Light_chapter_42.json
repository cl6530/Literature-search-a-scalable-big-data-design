        "This passage forms the beginning of Book III., in which the poet visits\nthe realms of light after having described Hell and its inhabitants.",
        "  Hail, holy Light, offspring of Heaven first-born!\n  Or of the Eternal coeternal beam\n  May I express thee unblamed? since God is light,\n  And never but in unapproachèd light\n  Dwelt from eternity–dwelt then in thee,\n  Bright effluence of bright essence increate!\n  Or hear’st thou rather pure Ethereal stream,\n  Whose fountain who shall tell? Before the Sun,\n  Before the Heavens, thou wert, and at the voice\n  Of God, as with a mantle, didst invest\n  The rising World of waters dark and deep,\n  Won from the void and formless Infinite!\n  Thee I revisit now with bolder wing,\n  Escaped the Stygian Pool, though long detained\n  In that obscure sojourn, while in my flight,\n  Through utter and through middle Darkness borne,\n  With other notes than to the Orphean lyre\n  I sung of Chaos and eternal Night,\n  Taught by the Heavenly Muse to venture down\n  The dark descent, and up to re-ascend,\n  Though hard and rare. Thee I revisit safe,\n  And feel thy sovran vital lamp; but thou\n  Revisit’st not these eyes, that roll in vain\n  To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn;\n  So thick a drop serene hath quenched their orbs,\n  Or dim suffusion veiled. Yet not the more\n  Cease I to wander where the Muses haunt\n  Clear spring, or shady grove, or sunny hill,\n  Smit with the love of sacred song; but chief\n  Thee, Sion, and the flowery brooks beneath,\n  That wash thy hallowed feet, and warbling flow,\n  Nightly I visit: nor sometimes forget\n  Those other two equalled with me in fate,\n  So were I equalled with them in renown,\n  Blind Thamyris and blind Mæonides,\n  And Tiresias and Phineus, prophets old:\n  Then feed on thoughts that voluntary move\n  Harmonious numbers; as the wakeful bird\n  Sings darkling, and, in shadiest covert hid,\n  Tunes her nocturnal note. Thus with the year\n  Seasons return; but not to me returns\n  Day, or the sweet approach of even or morn,\n  Or sight of vernal bloom, or summer’s rose,\n  Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine;\n  But cloud instead and ever-during dark\n  Surrounds me, from the cheerful ways of men\n  Cut off, and, for the book of knowledge fair,\n  Presented with a universal blank\n  Of Nature’s works, to me expunged and rased,\n  And wisdom at one entrance quite shut out.\n  So much the rather thou, Celestial Light,\n  Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers\n  Irradiate; there plant eyes; all mist from thence\n  Purge and disperse, that I may see and tell\n  Of things invisible to mortal sight.\n                       Book III\nPARADISE REGAINED.",
        "  “A cold and noble epic.\"–TAINE.",
        "Paradise regained was written by Milton, judging from a passage in the\nAutobiography of Thomas Ellwood, in the winter of 1665-6, but was not\npublished until 1671. It was printed at Milton’s expense in a small volume\ntogether with Samson Agonistes.",
        "Paradise Regained tells the story of Christ’s temptation in the\nWilderness, and the material was taken from the accounts of Matthew and\nLuke, which the poet, with great skill, expanded without essentially\ndeviating from them.",
        "The title has been criticised on the ground that the poem should have\nextended over the whole of Christ’s life on earth. But Paradise Regained\nwas written as a sequel to Paradise Lost, and, as in the first poem the\npoet showed that Paradise was lost by the yielding of Adam and Eve to\nSatan, so in the second, he wished to show that Paradise was regained by\nthe resistance of Christ to temptation, Satan’s defeat signifying the\nregaining of Paradise for men by giving them the hope of Christ’s second\ncoming. Therefore the poem naturally ends with Satan’s rebuff and his\nfinal abandonment of the attempt on the pinnacle of the Temple.",
        "The poem has been criticised for its shortness, some scholars even\naffecting to believe it unfinished; its lack of variety, in that it has\nbut two characters, its lack of action, and the absence of figurative\nlanguage.",
        "But with all these faults, it has a charm of its own, entirely different\nfrom that of Paradise Lost. Satan has degenerated during his years of\n“roaming up and down the earth;” he is no longer the fallen angel of\nParadise Lost, who struggled with himself before making evil his good. He\nis openly given over to evil practices, and makes little effort to play\nthe hypocrite. His temptations are worked up from that of hunger to that\nof the vision of the kingdoms of the earth with a wonderful power of\ndescription which makes up for the lack of action and the few actors. The\npathless, rockbound desert, the old man, poorly clad, who accosts the\nChrist, the mountain-top from which all the earth was visible, the night\nof horror in the desert, and the sublime figure of the Savior, are all\nenduring pictures which compensate for any rigidity of treatment. If\nfigurative language is omitted it is because the theme does not need it,\nand does not show that the poem is less carefully finished than Paradise\nLost. Its lack of action and similarity of subject to the longer poem\nsufficiently account for its not meeting with popular favor. Johnson was\ncorrect when he said, “had this poem been written not by Milton, but by\nsome imitator, it would have claimed and received universal praise.”",
