        "LABOR, n.  One of the processes by which A acquires property for B.",
        "LAND, n.  A part of the earth’s surface, considered as property.  The \ntheory that land is property subject to private ownership and control \nis the foundation of modern society, and is eminently worthy of the \nsuperstructure.  Carried to its logical conclusion, it means that some \nhave the right to prevent others from living; for the right to own \nimplies the right exclusively to occupy; and in fact laws of trespass \nare enacted wherever property in land is recognized.  It follows that \nif the whole area of terra firma is owned by A, B and C, there will \nbe no place for D, E, F and G to be born, or, born as trespassers, to \nexist.",
        "  A life on the ocean wave,\n      A home on the rolling deep,\n  For the spark the nature gave\n      I have there the right to keep.",
        "  They give me the cat-o’-nine\n      Whenever I go ashore.\n  Then ho! for the flashing brine —\n      I’m a natural commodore!",
        "Dodle",
        "\nLANGUAGE, n.  The music with which we charm the serpents guarding \nanother’s treasure.",
        "LAOCOON, n.  A famous piece of antique scripture representing a priest \nof that name and his two sons in the folds of two enormous serpents.  \nThe skill and diligence with which the old man and lads support the \nserpents and keep them up to their work have been justly regarded as \none of the noblest artistic illustrations of the mastery of human \nintelligence over brute inertia.",
        "LAP, n.  One of the most important organs of the female system — an \nadmirable provision of nature for the repose of infancy, but chiefly \nuseful in rural festivities to support plates of cold chicken and \nheads of adult males.  The male of our species has a rudimentary lap, \nimperfectly developed and in no way contributing to the animal’s \nsubstantial welfare.",
        "LAST, n.  A shoemaker’s implement, named by a frowning Providence as \nopportunity to the maker of puns.",
        "  Ah, punster, would my lot were cast,\n      Where the cobbler is unknown,\n  So that I might forget his last\n      And hear your own.",
        "Gargo Repsky",
        "\nLAUGHTER, n.  An interior convulsion, producing a distortion of the \nfeatures and accompanied by inarticulate noises.  It is infectious \nand, though intermittent, incurable.  Liability to attacks of laughter \nis one of the characteristics distinguishing man from the animals — \nthese being not only inaccessible to the provocation of his example, \nbut impregnable to the microbes having original jurisdiction in \nbestowal of the disease.  Whether laughter could be imparted to \nanimals by inoculation from the human patient is a question that has \nnot been answered by experimentation.  Dr. Meir Witchell holds that \nthe infection character of laughter is due to the instantaneous \nfermentation of sputa diffused in a spray.  From this peculiarity he \nnames the disorder Convulsio spargens.",
        "LAUREATE, adj.  Crowned with leaves of the laurel.  In England the \nPoet Laureate is an officer of the sovereign’s court, acting as \ndancing skeleton at every royal feast and singing-mute at every royal \nfuneral.  Of all incumbents of that high office, Robert Southey had \nthe most notable knack at drugging the Samson of public joy and \ncutting his hair to the quick; and he had an artistic color-sense \nwhich enabled him so to blacken a public grief as to give it the \naspect of a national crime.",
        "LAUREL, n.  The laurus, a vegetable dedicated to Apollo, and \nformerly defoliated to wreathe the brows of victors and such poets as \nhad influence at court.  (Vide supra.)",
        "LAW, n.",
        "  Once Law was sitting on the bench,\n      And Mercy knelt a-weeping.\n  “Clear out!” he cried, “disordered wench!\n      Nor come before me creeping.\n  Upon your knees if you appear,\n  ’Tis plain your have no standing here.”",
        "  Then Justice came.  His Honor cried:\n      “Your status? — devil seize you!\"\n  “Amica curiae,” she replied —\n      “Friend of the court, so please you.\"\n  “Begone!” he shouted — “there’s the door —\n  I never saw your face before!”",
        "G.J.",
        "\nLAWFUL, adj.  Compatible with the will of a judge having jurisdiction.",
        "LAWYER, n.  One skilled in circumvention of the law.",
        "LAZINESS, n.  Unwarranted repose of manner in a person of low degree.",
        "LEAD, n.  A heavy blue-gray metal much used in giving stability to \nlight lovers — particularly to those who love not wisely but other \nmen’s wives.  Lead is also of great service as a counterpoise to an \nargument of such weight that it turns the scale of debate the wrong \nway.  An interesting fact in the chemistry of international \ncontroversy is that at the point of contact of two patriotisms lead is \nprecipitated in great quantities.",
        "  Hail, holy Lead! — of human feuds the great\n      And universal arbiter; endowed\n      With penetration to pierce any cloud\n  Fogging the field of controversial hate,\n  And with a sift, inevitable, straight,\n      Searching precision find the unavowed\n      But vital point.  Thy judgment, when allowed\n  By the chirurgeon, settles the debate.\n  O useful metal! — were it not for thee\n      We’d grapple one another’s ears alway:\n  But when we hear thee buzzing like a bee\n      We, like old Muhlenberg, “care not to stay.\"\n  And when the quick have run away like pellets\n  Jack Satan smelts the dead to make new bullets.",
        "LEARNING, n.  The kind of ignorance distinguishing the studious.",
        "LECTURER, n.  One with his hand in your pocket, his tongue in your ear \nand his faith in your patience.",
        "LEGACY, n.  A gift from one who is legging it out of this vale of \ntears.",
        "LEONINE, adj.  Unlike a menagerie lion.  Leonine verses are those in \nwhich a word in the middle of a line rhymes with a word at the end, as \nin this famous passage from Bella Peeler Silcox:",
        "  The electric light invades the dunnest deep of Hades.\n  Cries Pluto, ’twixt his snores:  “O tempora! O mores!”",
        "  It should be explained that Mrs. Silcox does not undertake to \nteach pronunciation of the Greek and Latin tongues.  Leonine verses \nare so called in honor of a poet named Leo, whom prosodists appear to \nfind a pleasure in believing to have been the first to discover that a \nrhyming couplet could be run into a single line.",
        "LETTUCE, n.  An herb of the genus Lactuca, “Wherewith,” says that \npious gastronome, Hengist Pelly, “God has been pleased to reward the \ngood and punish the wicked.  For by his inner light the righteous man \nhas discerned a manner of compounding for it a dressing to the \nappetency whereof a multitude of gustible condiments conspire, being \nreconciled and ameliorated with profusion of oil, the entire \ncomestible making glad the heart of the godly and causing his face to \nshine.  But the person of spiritual unworth is successfully tempted to \nthe Adversary to eat of lettuce with destitution of oil, mustard, egg, \nsalt and garlic, and with a rascal bath of vinegar polluted with \nsugar.  Wherefore the person of spiritual unworth suffers an \nintestinal pang of strange complexity and raises the song.”",
        "LEVIATHAN, n.  An enormous aquatic animal mentioned by Job.  Some \nsuppose it to have been the whale, but that distinguished \nichthyologer, Dr. Jordan, of Stanford University, maintains with \nconsiderable heat that it was a species of gigantic Tadpole (Thaddeus \nPolandensis) or Polliwig — Maria pseudo-hirsuta.  For an \nexhaustive description and history of the Tadpole consult the famous \nmonograph of Jane Potter, Thaddeus of Warsaw.",
        "LEXICOGRAPHER, n.  A pestilent fellow who, under the pretense of \nrecording some particular stage in the development of a language, does \nwhat he can to arrest its growth, stiffen its flexibility and \nmechanize its methods.  For your lexicographer, having written his \ndictionary, comes to be considered “as one having authority,” whereas \nhis function is only to make a record, not to give a law.  The natural \nservility of the human understanding having invested him with judicial \npower, surrenders its right of reason and submits itself to a \nchronicle as if it were a statue.  Let the dictionary (for example) \nmark a good word as “obsolete” or “obsolescent” and few men \nthereafter venture to use it, whatever their need of it and however \ndesirable its restoration to favor — whereby the process of \nimproverishment is accelerated and speech decays.  On the contrary, \nrecognizing the truth that language must grow by innovation if it grow \nat all, makes new words and uses the old in an unfamiliar sense, has \nno following and is tartly reminded that “it isn’t in the dictionary” \n— although down to the time of the first lexicographer (Heaven \nforgive him!) no author ever had used a word that was in the \ndictionary.  In the golden prime and high noon of English speech; when \nfrom the lips of the great Elizabethans fell words that made their own \nmeaning and carried it in their very sound; when a Shakespeare and a \nBacon were possible, and the language now rapidly perishing at one end \nand slowly renewed at the other was in vigorous growth and hardy \npreservation — sweeter than honey and stronger than a lion — the \nlexicographer was a person unknown, the dictionary a creation which \nhis Creator had not created him to create.",
        "  God said:  “Let Spirit perish into Form,\"\n  And lexicographers arose, a swarm!\n  Thought fled and left her clothing, which they took,\n  And catalogued each garment in a book.\n  Now, from her leafy covert when she cries:\n  “Give me my clothes and I’ll return,” they rise\n  And scan the list, and say without compassion:\n  “Excuse us — they are mostly out of fashion.”",
        "Sigismund Smith",
        "\nLIAR, n.  A lawyer with a roving commission.",
        "LIBERTY, n.  One of Imagination’s most precious possessions.",
        "  The rising People, hot and out of breath,\n  Roared around the palace:  “Liberty or death!\"\n  “If death will do,” the King said, “let me reign;\n  You’ll have, I’m sure, no reason to complain.”",
        "Martha Braymance",
        "\nLICKSPITTLE, n.  A useful functionary, not infrequently found editing \na newspaper.  In his character of editor he is closely allied to the \nblackmailer by the tie of occasional identity; for in truth the \nlickspittle is only the blackmailer under another aspect, although the \nlatter is frequently found as an independent species.  Lickspittling \nis more detestable than blackmailing, precisely as the business of a \nconfidence man is more detestable than that of a highway robber; and \nthe parallel maintains itself throughout, for whereas few robbers will \ncheat, every sneak will plunder if he dare.",
        "LIFE, n.  A spiritual pickle preserving the body from decay.  We live \nin daily apprehension of its loss; yet when lost it is not missed.  \nThe question, “Is life worth living?” has been much discussed; \nparticularly by those who think it is not, many of whom have written \nat great length in support of their view and by careful observance of \nthe laws of health enjoyed for long terms of years the honors of \nsuccessful controversy.",
        "  “Life’s not worth living, and that’s the truth,\"\n  Carelessly caroled the golden youth.\n  In manhood still he maintained that view\n  And held it more strongly the older he grew.\n  When kicked by a jackass at eighty-three,\n  “Go fetch me a surgeon at once!” cried he.",
        "Han Soper",
        "\nLIGHTHOUSE, n.  A tall building on the seashore in which the \ngovernment maintains a lamp and the friend of a politician.",
        "LIMB, n.  The branch of a tree or the leg of an American woman.",
        "  ’Twas a pair of boots that the lady bought,\n      And the salesman laced them tight\n      To a very remarkable height —\n  Higher, indeed, than I think he ought —\n      Higher than can be right.\n  For the Bible declares — but never mind:\n      It is hardly fit\n  To censure freely and fault to find\n  With others for sins that I’m not inclined\n      Myself to commit.\n  Each has his weakness, and though my own\n      Is freedom from every sin,\n      It still were unfair to pitch in,\n  Discharging the first censorious stone.\n  Besides, the truth compels me to say,\n  The boots in question were made that way.\n  As he drew the lace she made a grimace,\n      And blushingly said to him:\n  “This boot, I’m sure, is too high to endure,\n  It hurts my — hurts my — limb.\"\n  The salesman smiled in a manner mild,\n  Like an artless, undesigning child;\n  Then, checking himself, to his face he gave\n  A look as sorrowful as the grave,\n      Though he didn’t care two figs\n  For her paints and throes,\n  As he stroked her toes,\n  Remarking with speech and manner just\n  Befitting his calling:  “Madam, I trust\n      That it doesn’t hurt your twigs.”",
        "B. Percival Dike",
        "\nLINEN, n.  “A kind of cloth the making of which, when made of hemp, \nentails a great waste of hemp.” — Calcraft the Hangman.",
        "LITIGANT, n.  A person about to give up his skin for the hope of \nretaining his bones.",
        "LITIGATION, n.  A machine which you go into as a pig and come out of \nas a sausage.",
        "LIVER, n.  A large red organ thoughtfully provided by nature to be \nbilious with.  The sentiments and emotions which every literary \nanatomist now knows to haunt the heart were anciently believed to \ninfest the liver; and even Gascoygne, speaking of the emotional side \nof human nature, calls it “our hepaticall parte.”  It was at one time \nconsidered the seat of life; hence its name — liver, the thing we \nlive with.  The liver is heaven’s best gift to the goose; without it \nthat bird would be unable to supply us with the Strasbourg pate.",
        "LL.D.  Letters indicating the degree Legumptionorum Doctor, one \nlearned in laws, gifted with legal gumption.  Some suspicion is cast \nupon this derivation by the fact that the title was formerly LL.d., \nand conferred only upon gentlemen distinguished for their wealth.  At \nthe date of this writing Columbia University is considering the \nexpediency of making another degree for clergymen, in place of the old \nD.D. — Damnator Diaboli.  The new honor will be known as Sanctorum \nCustus, and written $$c.  The name of the Rev. John Satan has been \nsuggested as a suitable recipient by a lover of consistency, who \npoints out that Professor Harry Thurston Peck has long enjoyed the \nadvantage of a degree.",
        "LOCK-AND-KEY, n.  The distinguishing device of civilization and \nenlightenment.",
        "LODGER, n.  A less popular name for the Second Person of that \ndelectable newspaper Trinity, the Roomer, the Bedder, and the Mealer.",
        "LOGIC, n.  The art of thinking and reasoning in strict accordance with \nthe limitations and incapacities of the human misunderstanding.  The \nbasic of logic is the syllogism, consisting of a major and a minor \npremise and a conclusion — thus:\n  Major Premise:  Sixty men can do a piece of work sixty times as \nquickly as one man.\n  Minor Premise:  One man can dig a posthole in sixty seconds; \ntherefore —\n  Conclusion:  Sixty men can dig a posthole in one second.\n  This may be called the syllogism arithmetical, in which, by \ncombining logic and mathematics, we obtain a double certainty and are \ntwice blessed.",
        "LOGOMACHY, n.  A war in which the weapons are words and the wounds \npunctures in the swim-bladder of self-esteem — a kind of contest in \nwhich, the vanquished being unconscious of defeat, the victor is \ndenied the reward of success.",
        "  ’Tis said by divers of the scholar-men\n  That poor Salmasius died of Milton’s pen.\n  Alas! we cannot know if this is true,\n  For reading Milton’s wit we perish too.",
        "LOGANIMITY, n.  The disposition to endure injury with meek forbearance \nwhile maturing a plan of revenge.",
        "LONGEVITY, n.  Uncommon extension of the fear of death.",
        "LOOKING-GLASS, n.  A vitreous plane upon which to display a fleeting \nshow for man’s disillusion given.\n  The King of Manchuria had a magic looking-glass, whereon whoso \nlooked saw, not his own image, but only that of the king.  A certain \ncourtier who had long enjoyed the king’s favor and was thereby \nenriched beyond any other subject of the realm, said to the king:  \n“Give me, I pray, thy wonderful mirror, so that when absent out of \nthine august presence I may yet do homage before thy visible shadow, \nprostrating myself night and morning in the glory of thy benign \ncountenance, as which nothing has so divine splendor, O Noonday Sun of \nthe Universe!\"\n  Please with the speech, the king commanded that the mirror be \nconveyed to the courtier’s palace; but after, having gone thither \nwithout apprisal, he found it in an apartment where was naught but \nidle lumber.  And the mirror was dimmed with dust and overlaced with \ncobwebs.  This so angered him that he fisted it hard, shattering the \nglass, and was sorely hurt.  Enraged all the more by this mischance, \nhe commanded that the ungrateful courtier be thrown into prison, and \nthat the glass be repaired and taken back to his own palace; and this \nwas done.  But when the king looked again on the mirror he saw not his \nimage as before, but only the figure of a crowned ass, having a bloody \nbandage on one of its hinder hooves — as the artificers and all who \nhad looked upon it had before discerned but feared to report.  Taught \nwisdom and charity, the king restored his courtier to liberty, had the \nmirror set into the back of the throne and reigned many years with \njustice and humility; and one day when he fell asleep in death while \non the throne, the whole court saw in the mirror the luminous figure \nof an angel, which remains to this day.",
        "LOQUACITY, n.  A disorder which renders the sufferer unable to curb \nhis tongue when you wish to talk.",
        "LORD, n.  In American society, an English tourist above the state of a \ncostermonger, as, lord ’Aberdasher, Lord Hartisan and so forth.  The \ntraveling Briton of lesser degree is addressed as “Sir,” as, Sir ’Arry \nDonkiboi, or ’Amstead ’Eath.  The word “Lord” is sometimes used, also, \nas a title of the Supreme Being; but this is thought to be rather \nflattery than true reverence.",
        "  Miss Sallie Ann Splurge, of her own accord,\n  Wedded a wandering English lord —\n  Wedded and took him to dwell with her “paw,\"\n  A parent who throve by the practice of Draw.\n  Lord Cadde I don’t hesitate to declare\n  Unworthy the father-in-legal care\n  Of that elderly sport, notwithstanding the truth\n  That Cadde had renounced all the follies of youth;\n  For, sad to relate, he’d arrived at the stage\n  Of existence that’s marked by the vices of age.\n  Among them, cupidity caused him to urge\n  Repeated demands on the pocket of Splurge,\n  Till, wrecked in his fortune, that gentleman saw\n  Inadequate aid in the practice of Draw,\n  And took, as a means of augmenting his pelf,\n  To the business of being a lord himself.\n  His neat-fitting garments he wilfully shed\n  And sacked himself strangely in checks instead;\n  Denuded his chin, but retained at each ear\n  A whisker that looked like a blasted career.\n  He painted his neck an incarnadine hue\n  Each morning and varnished it all that he knew.\n  The moony monocular set in his eye\n  Appeared to be scanning the Sweet Bye-and-Bye.\n  His head was enroofed with a billycock hat,\n  And his low-necked shoes were aduncous and flat.\n  In speech he eschewed his American ways,\n  Denying his nose to the use of his A’s\n  And dulling their edge till the delicate sense\n  Of a babe at their temper could take no offence.\n  His H’s — ’twas most inexpressibly sweet,\n  The patter they made as they fell at his feet!\n  Re-outfitted thus, Mr. Splurge without fear\n  Began as Lord Splurge his recouping career.\n  Alas, the Divinity shaping his end\n  Entertained other views and decided to send\n  His lordship in horror, despair and dismay\n  From the land of the nobleman’s natural prey.\n  For, smit with his Old World ways, Lady Cadde\n  Fell — suffering Caesar! — in love with her dad!",
        "G.J.",
        "\nLORE, n.  Learning — particularly that sort which is not derived from \na regular course of instruction but comes of the reading of occult \nbooks, or by nature.  This latter is commonly designated as folk-lore \nand embraces popularly myths and superstitions.  In Baring-Gould’s \nCurious Myths of the Middle Ages the reader will find many of these \ntraced backward, through various people son converging lines, toward a \ncommon origin in remote antiquity.  Among these are the fables of \n“Teddy the Giant Killer,” “The Sleeping John Sharp Williams,” “Little \nRed Riding Hood and the Sugar Trust,” “Beauty and the Brisbane,” “The \nSeven Aldermen of Ephesus,” “Rip Van Fairbanks,” and so forth.  The \nfable with Goethe so affectingly relates under the title of “The Erl- \nKing” was known two thousand years ago in Greece as “The Demos and the \nInfant Industry.”  One of the most general and ancient of these myths \nis that Arabian tale of “Ali Baba and the Forty Rockefellers.”",
        "LOSS, n.  Privation of that which we had, or had not.  Thus, in the \nlatter sense, it is said of a defeated candidate that he “lost his \nelection\"; and of that eminent man, the poet Gilder, that he has “lost \nhis mind.”  It is in the former and more legitimate sense, that the \nword is used in the famous epitaph:",
        "  Here Huntington’s ashes long have lain\n  Whose loss is our eternal gain,\n  For while he exercised all his powers\n  Whatever he gained, the loss was ours.",
        "LOVE, n.  A temporary insanity curable by marriage or by removal of \nthe patient from the influences under which he incurred the disorder.  \nThis disease, like caries and many other ailments, is prevalent only \namong civilized races living under artificial conditions; barbarous \nnations breathing pure air and eating simple food enjoy immunity from \nits ravages.  It is sometimes fatal, but more frequently to the \nphysician than to the patient.",
        "LOW-BRED, adj.  “Raised” instead of brought up.",
        "LUMINARY, n.  One who throws light upon a subject; as an editor by not \nwriting about it.",
        "LUNARIAN, n.  An inhabitant of the moon, as distinguished from \nLunatic, one whom the moon inhabits.  The Lunarians have been \ndescribed by Lucian, Locke and other observers, but without much \nagreement.  For example, Bragellos avers their anatomical identity \nwith Man, but Professor Newcomb says they are more like the hill \ntribes of Vermont.",
        "LYRE, n.  An ancient instrument of torture.  The word is now used in a \nfigurative sense to denote the poetic faculty, as in the following \nfiery lines of our great poet, Ella Wheeler Wilcox:",
        "  I sit astride Parnassus with my lyre,\n  And pick with care the disobedient wire.\n  That stupid shepherd lolling on his crook\n  With deaf attention scarcely deigns to look.\n  I bide my time, and it shall come at length,\n  When, with a Titan’s energy and strength,\n  I’ll grab a fistful of the strings, and O,\n  The word shall suffer when I let them go!",
