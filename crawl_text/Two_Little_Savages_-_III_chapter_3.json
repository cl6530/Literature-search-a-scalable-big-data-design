        "His Adjoining Brothers",
        "Yan had many brothers, but only those next him in age were important\nin his life. Rad was two years older–a strong boy, who prided himself\non his “common sense.” Though so much older, he was Yan’s inferior\nat school. He resented this, and delighted in showing his muscular\nsuperiority at all opportunities. He was inclined to be religious,\nand was strictly proper in his life and speech. He never was known to\nsmoke a cigarette, tell a lie, or say “gosh” or “darn.” He was plucky\nand persevering, but he was cold and hard, without a human fiber or a\ndrop of red blood in his make-up. Even as a boy he bragged that he had\nno enthusiasms, that he believed in common sense, that he called a\nspade a spade, and would not use two words where one would do. His\nintelligence was above the average, but he was so anxious to be\nthought a person of rare sagacity and smartness, unswayed by emotion,\nthat nothing was too heartless for him to do if it seemed in line\nwith his assumed character. He was not especially selfish, and yet he\npretended to be so, simply that people should say of him significantly\nand admiringly: “Isn’t he keen? Doesn’t he know how to take care of\nhimself?” What little human warmth there was in him died early, and he\nsucceeded only in making himself increasingly detested as he grew up.",
        "His relations to Yan may be seen in one incident.",
        "Yan had been crawling about under the house in the low wide cobwebby\nspace between the floor beams and the ground. The delightful sensation\nof being on an exploring expedition led him farther (and ultimately to\na paternal thrashing for soiling his clothes), till he discovered a\nhollow place near one side, where he could nearly stand upright. He\nat once formed one of his schemes–to make a secret, or at least a\nprivate, workroom here. He knew that if he were to ask permission\nhe would be refused, but if he and Rad together were to go it might\nreceive favourable consideration on account of Rad’s self-asserted\nreputation for common sense. For a wonder, Rad was impressed with the\nscheme, but was quite sure that they had “better not go together to\nask Father.” He “could manage that part better alone,” and he did.",
        "Then they set to work. The first thing was to deepen the hole from\nthree feet to six feet everywhere, and get rid of the earth by working\nit back under the floor of the house. There were many days of labour\nin this, and Yan stuck to it each day after returning from school.\nThere were always numerous reasons why Rad could not share in the\nlabour. When the ten by fourteen-foot hole was made, boards to line\nand floor it were needed. Lumber was very cheap–inferior, second-hand\nstuff was to be had for the asking–and Yan found and carried boards\nenough to make the workroom. Rad was an able carpenter and now took\ncharge of the construction. They worked together evening after\nevening, Yan discussing all manner of plans with warmth and\nenthusiasm–what they would do in their workshop when finished–how\nthey might get a jig-saw in time and saw picture frames, so as to\nmake some money. Rad assented with grunts or an occasional Scripture\ntext–that was his way. Each day he told Yan what to go on with while\nhe was absent.",
        "The walls were finished at length; a window placed in one side; a door\nmade and fitted with lock and key. What joy! Yan glowed with pleasure\nand pride at the triumphant completion of his scheme. He swept up the\nfloor for the finishing ceremony and sat down on the bench for a grand\ngloat, when Rad said abruptly:",
        "“Going to lock up now.” That sounded gratifyingly important. Yan\nstepped outside. Rad locked the door, put the key in his pocket, then\nturning, he said with cold, brutal emphasis:",
        "“Now you keep out of my workshop from this on. You have nothing\nto do with it. It’s mine. I got the permission to make it.” All of\nwhich he could prove, and did.",
        "Alner, the youngest, was eighteen months younger than Yan, and about\nthe same size, but the resemblance stopped there. His chief aim in\nlife was to be stylish. He once startled his mother by inserting into\nhis childish prayers the perfectly sincere request: “Please, God,\nmake me an awful swell, for Jesus sake.” Vanity was his foible, and\nlaziness his sin.",
        "He could be flattered into anything that did not involve effort. He\nfairly ached to be famous. He was consuming with desire to be pointed\nout for admiration as the great this, that or the other thing–it did\nnot matter to him what, as long as he could be pointed out. But he\nnever had the least idea of working for it. At school he was a sad\ndunce. He was three grades below Yan and at the bottom of his grade.\nThey set out for school each day together, because that was a paternal\nruling; but they rarely reached there together. They had nothing in\ncommon. Yan was full of warmth, enthusiasm, earnestness and energy,\nbut had a most passionate and ungovernable temper. Little put him in a\nrage, but it was soon over, and then an equally violent reaction set\nin, and he was always anxious to beg forgiveness and make friends\nagain. Alner was of lazy good temper and had a large sense of humour.\nHis interests were wholly in the playground. He had no sympathy with\nYan’s Indian tastes–\"Indians in nasty, shabby clothes. Bah! Horrid!\"\nhe would scornfully say.",
        "These, then, were his adjoining brothers.",
        "What wonder that Yan was daily further from them.",
