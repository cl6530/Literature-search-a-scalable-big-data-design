        "Brahma, creator of the universe, though all powerful, could not revoke a\npromise once made. For this reason, Ravana, the demon god of Ceylon, stood\non his head in the midst of five fires for ten thousand years, and at the\nend of that time boldly demanded of Brahma as a reward that he should not\nbe slain by gods, demons, or genii. He also requested the gift of nine\nother heads and eighteen additional arms and hands.",
        "These having been granted, he began by the aid of his evil spirits, the\nRakshasas, to lay waste the earth and to do violence to the good,\nespecially to the priests.",
        "At the time when Ravana’s outrages were spreading terror throughout the\nland, and Brahma, looking down from his throne, shuddered to see the\nmonster he had gifted with such fell power, there reigned in Ayodhya, now\nthe city of Oude, a good and wise raja, Dasaratha, who had reigned over\nthe splendid city for nine thousand years without once growing weary. He\nhad but one grief,–that he was childless,–and at the opening of the\nstory he was preparing to make the great sacrifice, Asva-medha, to\npropitiate the gods, that they might give him a son.",
        "The gods, well pleased, bore his request to Brahma in person, and\nincidentally preferred a request that he provide some means of destroying\nthe monster Ravana that was working such woe among their priests, and\ndisturbing their sacrifices.",
        "Brahma granted the first request, and, cudgeling his brains for a device\nto destroy Ravana, bethought himself that while he had promised that\nneither gods, genii, nor demons should slay him, he had said nothing of\nman. He accordingly led the appealing gods to Vishnu, who proclaimed that\nthe monster should be slain by men and monkeys, and that he would himself\nbe re-incarnated as the eldest son of Dasaratha and in this form compass\nthe death of Ravana.",
        "In course of time, as a reward for his performance of the great sacrifice,\nfour sons were born to Dasaratha, Rama by Kausalya, his oldest wife,\nBharata, whose mother was Kaikeyi, and twin sons, Lakshmana and Satrughna,\nwhose mother was Sumitra.",
        "Rama, the incarnation of Vishnu, destined to destroy Ravana, grew daily in\ngrace, beauty, and strength. When he was but sixteen years old, having\nbeen sent for by a sage to destroy the demons who were disturbing the\nforest hermits in their religious rites, he departed unattended, save by\nhis brother Lakshmana and a guide, into the pathless forests, where he\nsuccessfully overcame the terrible Rakshasa, Tarika, and conveyed her body\nto the grateful sage.",
        "While he was journeying through the forests, destroying countless\nRakshasas, he chanced to pass near the kingdom of Mithila and heard that\nits king, Janaka, had offered his peerless daughter, Sita, in marriage to\nthe man who could bend the mighty bow of Siva the destroyer, which, since\nits owner’s death, had been kept at Janaka’s court.",
        "Rama at once determined to accomplish the feat, which had been essayed in\nvain by so many suitors. When he presented himself at court Janaka was at\nonce won by his youth and beauty; and when the mighty bow, resting upon an\neight-wheeled car, was drawn in by five thousand men, and Rama without\napparent effort bent it until it broke, he gladly gave him his beautiful\ndaughter, and after the splendid wedding ceremonies were over, loaded the\nhappy pair with presents to carry back to Ayodhya.",
        "When Dasaratha, who had attended the marriage of his son at Mithila,\nreturned home, he began to feel weary of reigning, and bethought himself\nof the ancient Hindu custom of making the eldest son and heir apparent a\nYuva-Raja,–that is appointing him assistant king. Rama deserved this\nhonor, and would, moreover, be of great assistance to him.",
        "His happy people received the announcement of his intention with delight;\nthe priests approved of it as well, and the whole city was in the midst of\nthe most splendid preparations for the ceremony, when it occurred to\nDasaratha that all he lacked was the congratulations of his youngest and\nfavorite wife, Kaikeyi, on this great event. The well-watered streets and\nthe garlanded houses had already aroused the suspicions of\nKaikeyi,–suspicions speedily confirmed by the report of her maid. Angered\nand jealous because the son of Kausalya and not her darling Bharata, at\nthat time absent from the city, was to be made Yuva-Raja, she fled to the\n“Chamber of Sorrows,” and was there found by the old Raja.",
        "Though Kaikeyi was his youngest and most beautiful wife, her tears,\nthreats, and entreaties would have been of no avail had she not recalled\nthat, months before, the old Raja, in gratitude for her devoted nursing\nduring his illness, had granted her two promises. She now demanded the\nfulfilment of these before she would consent to smile upon him, and the\nconsent won, she required him, first, to appoint Bharata Yuva-Raja; and,\nsecond, to exile Rama for fourteen years to the terrible forest of\nDandaka.",
        "The promise of a Hindu, once given, cannot be revoked. In spite of the\ngrief of the old Raja, of Kausalya, his old wife, and of all the people,\nwho were at the point of revolt at the sudden disgrace of their favorite\nprince, the terrible news was announced to Rama, and he declared himself\nready to go, to save his father from dishonor.",
        "He purposed to go alone, but Sita would not suffer herself to be thus\ndeserted. Life without him, she pleaded, was worse than death; and so\neloquent was her grief at the thought of parting that she was at last\npermitted to don the rough garment of bark provided by the malicious\nKaikeyi.",
        "The people of Ayodhya, determined to share the fate of their favorites,\naccompanied them from the city, their tears laying the dust raised by\nRama’s chariot wheels. But when sleep overcame them, Rama, Sita, and\nLakshmana escaped from them, dismissed their charioteer, and, crossing the\nGanges, made their way to the mountain of Citra-kuta, where they took up\ntheir abode.",
        "No more beautiful place could be imagined. Flowers of every kind,\ndelicious fruits, and on every side the most pleasing prospects, together\nwith perfect love, made their hermitage a paradise on earth. Here the\nexiles led an idyllic existence until sought out by Bharata, who, learning\nfrom his mother on his return home the ruin she had wrought in the Raj,\nhad indignantly spurned her, and hastened to Dandaka. The old Raja had\ndied from grief soon after the departure of the exiles, and Bharata now\ndemanded that Rama should return to Ayodhya and become Raja, as was his\nright, as eldest son.",
        "When Rama refused to do this until the end of his fourteen years of exile,\nBharata vowed that for fourteen years he would wear the garb of a devotee\nand live outside the city, committing the management of the Raj to a pair\nof golden sandals which he took from Rama’s feet. All the affairs of state\nwould be transacted under the authority of the sandals, and Bharata, while\nruling the Raj, would pay homage to them.",
        "Soon after the departure of Bharata the exiles were warned to depart from\ntheir home on Citra-kuta and seek a safer hermitage, for terrible\nrakshasas filled this part of the forest. They accordingly sought the\nabode of Atri the hermit, whose wife Anasuya was so pleased with Sita’s\npiety and devotion to her husband that she bestowed upon her the crown of\nimmortal youth and beauty. They soon found a new abode in the forest of\nPancarati, on the banks of the river Godavari, where Lakshmana erected a\nspacious bamboo house.",
        "Their happiness in this elysian spot was destined to be short-lived. Near\nthem dwelt a horrible rakshasa, Surpanakha by name, who fell in love with\nRama. When she found that he did not admire the beautiful form she assumed\nto win him, and that both he and Lakshmana laughed at her advances, she\nattempted to destroy Sita, only to receive in the attempt a disfiguring\nwound from the watchful Lakshmana. Desiring revenge for her disfigured\ncountenance and her scorned love, she hastened to the court of her brother\nRavana, in Ceylon, and in order to induce him to avenge her wrongs, dwelt\nupon the charms of the beautiful wife of Rama.",
        "Some days after, Sita espied a golden fawn, flecked with silver, among the\ntrees near their home. Its shining body, its jewel-like horns, so\ncaptivated her fancy that she implored Rama, if possible, to take it alive\nfor her; if not, at least to bring her its skin for a couch. As Rama\ndeparted, he warned Lakshmana not to leave Sita for one moment; he would\nsurely return, since no weapon could harm him. In the depths of the forest\nthe fawn fell by his arrow, crying as it fell, “O Sita! O Lakshmana!” in\nRama’s very tones.",
        "When Sita heard the cry she reproached Lakshmana for not going to his\nbrother’s aid, until he left her to escape her bitter words. He had no\nsooner disappeared in the direction of the cry than a hermit appeared and\nasked her to minister unto his wants.",
        "Sita carried him food, bathed his feet, and conversed with him until, able\nno longer to conceal his admiration for her, he revealed himself in his\ntrue form as the demon god of Ceylon.",
        "When she indignantly repulsed him he seized her, and mounting his chariot\ndrove rapidly towards Ceylon.",
        "When Rama and Lakshmana returned home, soon after, they found the house\nempty. As they searched through the forest for traces of her they found a\ngiant vulture dying from wounds received while endeavoring to rescue the\nshrieking Sita. Going farther, they encountered the monkey king Sugriva\nand his chiefs, among whom Sita had dropped from the chariot her scarf and\nornaments.",
        "Sugriva had been deposed from his kingdom by his brother Bali, who had\nalso taken his wife from him. Rama agreed to conquer Bali if Sugriva would\nassist in the search for Sita; and, the agreement made, they at once\nmarched upon Kishkindha, together slew Bali, and gained possession of the\nwealthy city and the queen Tara. They were now ready to search for the\nlost Sita.",
        "In his quest through every land, Hanuman, the monkey general, learned from\nthe king of the vultures that she had been carried to Ceylon. He\nimmediately set out for the coast with his army, only to find a bridgeless\nocean stretching between them and the island. Commanding his soldiers to\nremain where they were, Hanuman expanded his body to enormous proportions,\nleaped the vast expanse of water, and alighted upon a mountain, from which\nhe could look down upon Lanka, the capital city of Ceylon. Perceiving the\ncity to be closely guarded, he assumed the form of a cat, and thus,\nunsuspected, crept through the barriers and examined the city. He found\nthe demon god in his apartments, surrounded by beautiful women, but Sita\nwas not among them. Continuing his search, he at last discovered her, her\nbeauty dimmed by grief, seated under a tree in a beautiful asoka grove,\nguarded by hideous rakshasas with the faces of buffaloes, dogs, and swine.",
        "Assuming the form of a tiny monkey, Hanuman crept down the tree, and\ngiving her the ring of Rama, took one from her. He offered to carry her\naway with him, but Sita declared that Rama must himself come to her\nrescue. While they were talking together, the demon god appeared, and,\nafter fruitless wooing, announced that if Sita did not yield herself to\nhim in two months he would have her guards “mince her limbs with steel\"\nfor his morning repast.",
        "In his rage, Hanuman destroyed a mango grove and was captured by the\ndemon’s guards, who were ordered to set his tail on fire. As soon as this\nwas done, Hanuman made himself so small that he slipped from his bonds,\nand, jumping upon the roofs, spread a conflagration through the city of\nLanka.",
        "He leaped back to the mainland, conveyed the news of Sita’s captivity to\nRama and Sugriva, and was soon engaged in active preparations for the\ncampaign.",
        "As long as the ocean was unbridged it was impossible for any one save\nHanuman to cross it. In his anger at being so thwarted, Rama turned his\nweapons against it, until from the terrified waves rose the god of the\nocean, who promised him that if Nala built a bridge, the waves should\nsupport the materials as firmly as though it were built on land.",
        "Terror reigned in Lanka at the news of the approach of Rama. Vibishana,\nRavana’s brother, deserted to Rama, because of the demon’s rage when he\nadvised him to make peace with Rama. Fiercely fought battles ensued, in\nwhich even the gods took part, Vishnu and Indra taking sides with Rama,\nand the evil spirits fighting with Ravana.",
        "After the war had been carried on for some time, with varying results, it\nwas decided to determine it by single combat between Ravana and Rama. Then\neven the gods were terrified at the fierceness of the conflict. At each\nshot Rama’s mighty bow cut off a head of the demon, which at once grew\nback, and the hero was in despair until he remembered the all-powerful\narrow given him by Brahma.",
        "As the demon fell by this weapon, flowers rained from heaven upon the\nhappy victor, and his ears were ravished with celestial music.",
        "Touched by the grief of Ravana’s widows, Rama ordered his foe a splendid\nfuneral, and then sought the conquered city.",
        "Sita was led forth, beaming with happiness at finding herself re-united to\nher husband; but her happiness was destined to be of short duration. Rama\nreceived her with coldness and with downcast eyes, saying that she could\nno longer be his wife, after having dwelt in the zenana of the demon. Sita\nassured him of her innocence; but on his continuing to revile her, she\nordered her funeral pyre to be built, since she would rather die by fire\nthan live despised by Rama. The sympathy of all the bystanders was with\nSita, but Rama saw her enter the flames without a tremor. Soon Agni, the\ngod of fire, appeared, bearing the uninjured Sita in his arms. Her\ninnocence thus publicly proved by the trial by fire, she was welcomed by\nRama, whose treatment she tenderly forgave.",
        "The conquest made, the demon destroyed, and Sita restored, Rama returned\nin triumph to Ayodhya, and assumed the government. The city was\nprosperous, the people were happy, and for a time all went well. It was\nnot long, however, before whispers concerning Sita’s long abode in Ceylon\nspread abroad, and some one whispered to Rama that a famine in the country\nwas due to the guilt of Sita, who had suffered the caresses of the demon\nwhile in captivity in Ceylon. Forgetful of the trial by fire, forgetful of\nSita’s devotion to him through weal and woe, the ungrateful Rama\nimmediately ordered her to the forest in which they had spent together the\nhappy years of their exile.",
        "Without a murmur the unhappy Sita, alone and unbefriended, dragged herself\nto the forest, and, torn with grief of body and spirit, found the\nhermitage of Valmiki, where she gave birth to twin sons, Lava and Kuça.\nHere she reared them, with the assistance of the hermit, who was their\nteacher, and under whose care they grew to manhood, handsome and strong.",
        "It chanced about the time the youths were twenty years old, that Rama, who\nhad grown peevish and disagreeable with age, began to think the gods were\nangered with him because he had killed Ravana, who was the son of a\nBrahman. Determined to propitiate them by means of the great sacrifice, he\ncaused a horse to be turned loose in the forest. When his men went to\nretake it, at the end of the year, it was caught by two strong and\nbeautiful youths who resisted all efforts to capture them. In his rage\nRama went to the forest in person, only to learn that the youths were his\ntwin sons, Lava and Kuça. Struck with remorse, Rama recalled the\nsufferings of his wife Sita, and on learning that she was at the hermitage\nof Valmiki, ordered her to come to him, that he might take her to him\nagain, having first caused her to endure the trial by fire to prove her\ninnocence to all his court.",
        "Sita had had time to recover from the love of her youth, and the prospect\nof life with Rama, without the couleur de rose of youthful love, was\nnot altogether pleasant. At first, she even refused to see him; but\nfinally, moved by the appeals of Valmiki and his wife, she clad herself in\nher richest robes, and, young and beautiful as when first won by Rama, she\nstood before him. Not deigning to look in his face, she appealed to the\nearth. If she had never loved any man but Rama, if her truth and purity\nwere known to the earth, let it open its bosom and take her to it. While\nthe armies stood trembling with horror, the earth opened, a gorgeous\nthrone appeared, and the goddess of earth, seated upon it, took Sita\nbeside her and conveyed her to the realms of eternal happiness, leaving\nthe too late repentant Rama to wear out his remaining years in shame and\npenitence.",
