        "Ever since the receipt of my orders I had made a study of the terrain\nsurrounding Santiago, gathering information mainly from the former\nresidents of the city, several of whom were on the transports with me.\nAt this interview all the possible points of attack were for the last\ntime carefully weighed, and then, for the information and guidance of\nAdmiral Sampson and Gen. Garcia, I outlined the plan of campaign,\nwhich was as follows:",
        "With the assistance of the small boats of the Navy, the disembarkation\nwas to commence on the morning of the 22d at Baiquiri; on the 21st 500\ninsurgent troops were to be transferred from Aserraderos to Cujababo,\nincreasing the force already there to 1,000 men. This force, under\nGen. Castillo, was to attack the Spanish force at Baiquiri in the rear\nat the time of disembarkation. This movement was successfully made. To\nmislead the enemy as to the real point of our intended landing, I\nrequested Gen. Garcia to send a small force (about 500 men), under\nGen. Rabi, to attack the little town of Cabanas, situated on the coast\na few miles to the west of the entrance to Santiago harbor, and where\nit was reported the enemy had several men intrenched, and from which a\ntrail leads around the west side of the bay to Santiago.",
        "I also requested Admiral Sampson to send several of his warships, with\na number of my transports, opposite this town, for the purpose of\nmaking a show of disembarking there.",
        "In addition, I asked the admiral to cause a bombardment to be made at\nCabanas and also at the forts around the Morro and at the towns of\nAguadores, Siboney, and Baiquiri. The troops under Gen. Garcia\nremaining at Aserraderos were to be transferred to Baiquiri or Siboney\non the 24th. This was successfully accomplished at Siboney.",
        "These movements committed me to approaching Santiago from the east\nover a narrow road, at first in some places not better than a trail,\nrunning from Baiquiri through Siboney and Sevilla, and making attack\nfrom that quarter. This, in my judgment, was the only feasible plan,\nand subsequent information and results confirmed my judgment.",
        "On the morning of the 22d the Army commenced to disembark at Baiquiri.\nThe following general order indicates the manner in which the troops\nleft the transports and the amount of supplies carried immediately\nwith them:",
