        "THERE is a difference between one and another hour of\nlife in their authority and subsequent effect. Our faith\ncomes in moments; our vice is habitual. Yet there is a\ndepth in those brief moments which constrains us to\nascribe more reality to them than to all other experiences.\nFor this reason the argument which is always forthcoming\nto silence those who conceive extraordinary hopes of man,\nnamely the appeal to experience, is for ever invalid and\nvain. We give up the past to the objector, and yet we hope.\nHe must explain this hope. We grant that human life is mean,\nbut how did we find out that it was mean? What is the ground\nof this uneasiness of ours; of this old discontent? What is\nthe universal sense of want and ignorance, but the fine\ninnuendo by which the soul makes its enormous claim? Why\ndo men feel that the natural history of man has never been\nwritten, but he is always leaving behind what you have said\nof him, and it becomes old, and books of metaphysics\nworthless? The philosophy of six thousand years has not\nsearched the chambers and magazines of the soul. In its\nexperiments there has always remained, in the last analysis,\na residuum it could not resolve. Man is a stream whose\nsource is hidden. Our being is descending into us from\nwe know not whence. The most exact calculator has no\nprescience that somewhat incalculable may not balk the very\nnext moment. I am constrained every moment to acknowledge a\nhigher origin for events than the will I call mine.",
        "As with events, so is it with thoughts. When I watch\nthat flowing river, which, out of regions I see not,\npours for a season its streams into me, I see that I\nam a pensioner; not a cause, but a surprised spectator\nof this ethereal water; that I desire and look up and\nput myself in the attitude of reception, but from some\nalien energy the visions come.",
        "The Supreme Critic on the errors of the past and the\npresent, and the only prophet of that which must be,\nis that great nature in which we rest as the earth\nlies in the soft arms of the atmosphere; that Unity,\nthat Over-soul, within which every man’s particular\nbeing is contained and made one with all other; that\ncommon heart of which all sincere conversation is the\nworship, to which all right action is submission; that\noverpowering reality which confutes our tricks and\ntalents, and constrains every one to pass for what he\nis, and to speak from his character and not from his\ntongue, and which evermore tends to pass into our\nthought and hand and become wisdom and virtue and power\nand beauty. We live in succession, in division, in parts,\nin particles. Meantime within man is the soul of the\nwhole; the wise silence; the universal beauty, to which\nevery part and particle is equally related; the eternal\nONE. And this deep power in which we exist and whose\nbeatitude is all accessible to us, is not only self-\nsufficing and perfect in every hour, but the act of\nseeing and the thing seen, the seer and the spectacle,\nthe subject and the object, are one. We see the world\npiece by piece, as the sun, the moon, the animal, the\ntree; but the whole, of which these are the shining parts,\nis the soul. Only by the vision of that Wisdom can the\nhoroscope of the ages be read, and by falling back on our\nbetter thoughts, by yielding to the spirit of prophecy\nwhich is innate in every man, we can know what it saith.\nEvery man’s words who speaks from that life must sound\nvain to those who do not dwell in the same thought on\ntheir own part. I dare not speak for it. My words do not\ncarry its august sense; they fall short and cold. Only\nitself can inspire whom it will, and behold! their speech\nshall be lyrical, and sweet, and universal as the rising\nof the wind.  Yet I desire, even by profane words, if I\nmay not use sacred, to indicate the heaven of this deity\nand to report what hints I have collected of the\ntranscendent simplicity and energy of the Highest Law.",
        "If we consider what happens in conversation, in reveries,\nin remorse, in times of passion, in surprises, in the\ninstructions of dreams, wherein often we see ourselves\nin masquerade,—the droll disguises only magnifying and\nenhancing a real element and forcing it on our distinct\nnotice,—we shall catch many hints that will broaden and\nlighten into knowledge of the secret of nature. All goes\nto show that the soul in man is not an organ, but animates\nand exercises all the organs; is not a function, like the\npower of memory, of calculation, of comparison, but uses\nthese as hands and feet; is not a faculty, but a light;\nis not the intellect or the will, but the master of the\nintellect and the will; is the background of our being,\nin which they lie,—an immensity not possessed and that\ncannot be possessed. From within or from behind, a light\nshines through us upon things and makes us aware that we\nare nothing, but the light is all. A man is the facade of\na temple wherein all wisdom and all good abide. What we\ncommonly call man, the eating, drinking, planting, counting\nman, does not, as we know him, represent himself, but\nmisrepresents himself. Him we do not respect, but the soul,\nwhose organ he is, would he let it appear through his\naction, would make our knees bend. When it breathes through\nhis intellect, it is genius; when it breathes through his\nwill, it is virtue; when it flows through his affection, it\nis love. And the blindness of the intellect begins when it\nwould be something of itself. The weakness of the will begins\nwhen the individual would be something of himself. All reform\naims in some one particular to let the soul have its way\nthrough us; in other words, to engage us to obey.",
        "Of this pure nature every man is at some time sensible.\nLanguage cannot paint it with his colors. It is too\nsubtile. It is undefinable, unmeasurable; but we know\nthat it pervades and contains us. We know that all\nspiritual being is in man. A wise old proverb says, “God\ncomes to see us without bell;” that is, as there is no\nscreen or ceiling between our heads and the infinite\nheavens, so is there no bar or wall in the soul where\nman, the effect, ceases, and God, the cause, begins. The\nwalls are taken away. We lie open on one side to the deeps\nof spiritual nature, to the attributes of God. Justice we\nsee and know, Love, Freedom, Power. These natures no man\never got above, but they tower over us, and most in the\nmoment when our interests tempt us to wound them.",
        "The sovereignty of this nature whereof we speak is made\nknown by its independency of those limitations which\ncircumscribe us on every hand. The soul circumscribes\nall things. As I have said, it contradicts all experience.\nIn like manner it abolishes time and space. The influence\nof the senses has in most men overpowered the mind to that\ndegree that the walls of time and space have come to look\nreal and insurmountable; and to speak with levity of these\nlimits is, in the world, the sign of insanity. Yet time and\nspace are but inverse measures of the force of the soul.\nThe spirit sports with time,—",
        "We are often made to feel that there is another youth\nand age than that which is measured from the year of\nour natural birth. Some thoughts always find us young,\nand keep us so. Such a thought is the love of the\nuniversal and eternal beauty. Every man parts from that\ncontemplation with the feeling that it rather belongs\nto ages than to mortal life. The least activity of the\nintellectual powers redeems us in a degree from the\nconditions of time. In sickness, in languor, give us a\nstrain of poetry or a profound sentence, and we are\nrefreshed; or produce a volume of Plato or Shakspeare,\nor remind us of their names, and instantly we come into\na feeling of longevity. See how the deep divine thought\nreduces centuries and millenniums and makes itself\npresent through all ages. Is the teaching of Christ\nless effective now than it was when first his mouth\nwas opened? The emphasis of facts and persons in my\nthought has nothing to do with time. And so always the\nsoul’s scale is one, the scale of the senses and the\nunderstanding is another. Before the revelations of the\nsoul, Time, Space and Nature shrink away. In common\nspeech we refer all things to time, as we habitually\nrefer the immensely sundered stars to one concave sphere.\nAnd so we say that the Judgment is distant or near, that\nthe Millennium approaches, that a day of certain political,\nmoral, social reforms is at hand, and the like, when we\nmean that in the nature of things one of the facts we\ncontemplate is external and fugitive, and the other is\npermanent and connate with the soul. The things we now\nesteem fixed shall, one by one, detach themselves like\nripe fruit from our experience, and fall. The wind shall\nblow them none knows whither. The landscape, the figures,\nBoston, London, are facts as fugitive as any institution\npast, or any whiff of mist or smoke, and so is society,\nand so is the world. The soul looketh steadily forwards,\ncreating a world before her, leaving worlds behind her.\nShe has no dates, nor rites, nor persons, nor specialties\nnor men. The soul knows only the soul; the web of events\nis the flowing robe in which she is clothed.",
        "After its own law and not by arithmetic is the rate of\nits progress to be computed. The soul’s advances are not\nmade by gradation, such as can be represented by motion\nin a straight line, but rather by ascension of state,\nsuch as can be represented by metamorphosis,—from the\negg to the worm, from the worm to the fly. The growths\nof genius are of a certain total character, that does\nnot advance the elect individual first over John, then\nAdam, then Richard, and give to each the pain of\ndiscovered inferiority,—but by every throe of growth\nthe man expands there where he works, passing, at each\npulsation, classes, populations, of men. With each divine\nimpulse the mind rends the thin rinds of the visible and\nfinite, and comes out into eternity, and inspires and\nexpires its air. It converses with truths that have always\nbeen spoken in the world, and becomes conscious of a closer\nsympathy with Zeno and Arrian than with persons in the house.",
        "This is the law of moral and of mental gain. The simple\nrise as by specific levity not into a particular virtue,\nbut into the region of all the virtues. They are in the\nspirit which contains them all. The soul requires purity,\nbut purity is not it; requires justice, but justice is\nnot that; requires beneficence, but is somewhat better;\nso that there is a kind of descent and accommodation felt\nwhen we leave speaking of moral nature to urge a virtue\nwhich it enjoins. To the well-born child all the virtues\nare natural, and not painfully acquired. Speak to his\nheart, and the man becomes suddenly virtuous.",
        "Within the same sentiment is the germ of intellectual\ngrowth, which obeys the same law. Those who are capable\nof humility, of justice, of love, of aspiration, stand\nalready on a platform that commands the sciences and\narts, speech and poetry, action and grace. For whoso\ndwells in this moral beatitude already anticipates those\nspecial powers which men prize so highly. The lover has\nno talent, no skill, which passes for quite nothing with\nhis enamoured maiden, however little she may possess of\nrelated faculty; and the heart which abandons itself to\nthe Supreme Mind finds itself related to all its works,\nand will travel a royal road to particular knowledges and\npowers. In ascending to this primary and aboriginal\nsentiment we have come from our remote station on the\ncircumference instantaneously to the centre of the world,\nwhere, as in the closet of God, we see causes, and\nanticipate the universe, which is but a slow effect.",
        "One mode of the divine teaching is the incarnation of\nthe spirit in a form,—in forms, like my own. I live\nin society, with persons who answer to thoughts in my\nown mind, or express a certain obedience to the great\ninstincts to which I live. I see its presence to them.\nI am certified of a common nature; and these other souls,\nthese separated selves, draw me as nothing else can.\nThey stir in me the new emotions we call passion; of love,\nhatred, fear, admiration, pity; thence come conversation,\ncompetition, persuasion, cities and war. Persons are\nsupplementary to the primary teaching of the soul. In\nyouth we are mad for persons. Childhood and youth see\nall the world in them. But the larger experience of man\ndiscovers the identical nature appearing through them all.\nPersons themselves acquaint us with the impersonal. In all\nconversation between two persons tacit reference is made,\nas to a third party, to a common nature. That third party\nor common nature is not social; it is impersonal; is God.\nAnd so in groups where debate is earnest, and especially\non high questions, the company become aware that the\nthought rises to an equal level in all bosoms, that all\nhave a spiritual property in what was said, as well as\nthe sayer. They all become wiser than they were. It arches\nover them like a temple, this unity of thought in which\nevery heart beats with nobler sense of power and duty, and\nthinks and acts with unusual solemnity. All are conscious\nof attaining to a higher self-possession. It shines for\nall. There is a certain wisdom of humanity which is common\nto the greatest men with the lowest, and which our ordinary\neducation often labors to silence and obstruct. The mind is\none, and the best minds, who love truth for its own sake,\nthink much less of property in truth. They accept it\nthankfully everywhere, and do not label or stamp it with\nany man’s name, for it is theirs long beforehand, and from\neternity. The learned and the studious of thought have no\nmonopoly of wisdom. Their violence of direction in some\ndegree disqualifies them to think truly.  We owe many\nvaluable observations to people who are not very acute or\nprofound, and who say the thing without effort which we want\nand have long been hunting in vain. The action of the soul\nis oftener in that which is felt and left unsaid than in\nthat which is said in any conversation. It broods over every\nsociety, and they unconsciously seek for it in each other.\nWe know better than we do. We do not yet possess ourselves,\nand we know at the same time that we are much more. I feel\nthe same truth how often in my trivial conversation with my\nneighbors, that somewhat higher in each of us overlooks this\nby-play, and Jove nods to Jove from behind each of us.",
        "Men descend to meet. In their habitual and mean service\nto the world, for which they forsake their native\nnobleness, they resemble those Arabian sheiks who dwell\nin mean houses and affect an external poverty, to escape\nthe rapacity of the Pacha, and reserve all their display\nof wealth for their interior and guarded retirements.",
        "As it is present in all persons, so it is in every\nperiod of life. It is adult already in the infant man.\nIn my dealing with my child, my Latin and Greek, my\naccomplishments and my money stead me nothing; but as\nmuch soul as I have avails. If I am wilful, he sets his\nwill against mine, one for one, and leaves me, if I\nplease, the degradation of beating him by my superiority\nof strength. But if I renounce my will and act for the\nsoul, setting that up as umpire between us two, out of\nhis young eyes looks the same soul; he reveres and loves\nwith me.",
        "The soul is the perceiver and revealer of truth. We know\ntruth when we see it, let skeptic and scoffer say what\nthey choose. Foolish people ask you, when you have spoken\nwhat they do not wish to hear, ’How do you know it is\ntruth, and not an error of your own?’ We know truth when\nwe see it, from opinion, as we know when we are awake that\nwe are awake. It was a grand sentence of Emanuel Swedenborg,\nwhich would alone indicate the greatness of that man’s\nperception,—\"It is no proof of a man’s understanding to\nbe able to confirm whatever he pleases; but to be able to\ndiscern that what is true is true, and that what is false\nis false,—this is the mark and character of intelligence.\"\nIn the book I read, the good thought returns to me, as\nevery truth will, the image of the whole soul. To the bad\nthought which I find in it, the same soul becomes a\ndiscerning, separating sword, and lops it away. We are wiser\nthan we know. If we will not interfere with our thought, but\nwill act entirely, or see how the thing stands in God, we\nknow the particular thing, and every thing, and every man.\nFor the Maker of all things and all persons stands behind\nus and casts his dread omniscience through us over things.",
        "But beyond this recognition of its own in particular\npassages of the individual’s experience, it also reveals\ntruth. And here we should seek to reinforce ourselves by\nits very presence, and to speak with a worthier, loftier\nstrain of that advent. For the soul’s communication of\ntruth is the highest event in nature, since it then does\nnot give somewhat from itself, but it gives itself, or\npasses into and becomes that man whom it enlightens; or,\nin proportion to that truth he receives, it takes him to\nitself.",
        "We distinguish the announcements of the soul, its\nmanifestations of its own nature, by the term Revelation.\nThese are always attended by the emotion of the sublime.\nFor this communication is an influx of the Divine mind\ninto our mind. It is an ebb of the individual rivulet\nbefore the flowing surges of the sea of life. Every distinct\napprehension of this central commandment agitates men with\nawe and delight. A thrill passes through all men at the\nreception of new truth, or at the performance of a great\naction, which comes out of the heart of nature. In these\ncommunications the power to see is not separated from the\nwill to do, but the insight proceeds from obedience, and\nthe obedience proceeds from a joyful perception. Every\nmoment when the individual feels himself invaded by it is\nmemorable. By the necessity of our constitution a certain\nenthusiasm attends the individual’s consciousness of that\ndivine presence. The character and duration of this\nenthusiasm varies with the state of the individual, from an\necstasy and trance and prophetic inspiration,—which is its\nrarer appearance,—to the faintest glow of virtuous emotion,\nin which form it warms, like our household fires, all the\nfamilies and associations of men, and makes society possible.\nA certain tendency to insanity has always attended the opening\nof the religious sense in men, as if they had been “blasted\nwith excess of light.” The trances of Socrates, the “union\"\nof Plotinus, the vision of Porphyry, the conversion of Paul,\nthe aurora of Behmen, the convulsions of George Fox and his\nQuakers, the illumination of Swedenborg, are of this kind.\nWhat was in the case of these remarkable persons a ravishment,\nhas, in innumerable instances in common life, been exhibited\nin less striking manner. Everywhere the history of religion\nbetrays a tendency to enthusiasm.  The rapture of the Moravian\nand Quietist; the opening of the internal sense of the Word,\nin the language of the New Jerusalem Church; the revival of\nthe Calvinistic churches; the experiences of the Methodists,\nare varying forms of that shudder of awe and delight with\nwhich the individual soul always mingles with the universal\nsoul.",
        "The nature of these revelations is the same; they are\nperceptions of the absolute law. They are solutions\nof the soul’s own questions. They do not answer the\nquestions which the understanding asks. The soul\nanswers never by words, but by the thing itself that\nis inquired after.",
        "Revelation is the disclosure of the soul. The popular\nnotion of a revelation is that it is a telling of\nfortunes. In past oracles of the soul the understanding\nseeks to find answers to sensual questions, and undertakes\nto tell from God how long men shall exist, what their\nhands shall do and who shall be their company, adding\nnames and dates and places. But we must pick no locks.\nWe must check this low curiosity. An answer in words is\ndelusive; it is really no answer to the questions you ask.\nDo not require a description of the countries towards\nwhich you sail. The description does not describe them to\nyou, and to-morrow you arrive there and know them by\ninhabiting them. Men ask concerning the immortality of\nthe soul, the employments of heaven, the state of the\nsinner, and so forth. They even dream that Jesus has left\nreplies to precisely these interrogatories. Never a moment\ndid that sublime spirit speak in their patois. To truth,\njustice, love, the attributes of the soul, the idea of\nimmutableness is essentially associated. Jesus, living in\nthese moral sentiments, heedless of sensual fortunes, heeding\nonly the manifestations of these, never made the separation\nof the idea of duration from the essence of these attributes,\nnor uttered a syllable concerning the duration of the soul.\nIt was left to his disciples to sever duration from the\nmoral elements, and to teach the immortality of the soul\nas a doctrine, and maintain it by evidences. The moment the\ndoctrine of the immortality is separately taught, man is\nalready fallen. In the flowing of love, in the adoration of\nhumility, there is no question of continuance. No inspired\nman ever asks this question or condescends to these evidences.\nFor the soul is true to itself, and the man in whom it is\nshed abroad cannot wander from the present, which is infinite,\nto a future which would be finite.",
        "These questions which we lust to ask about the future\nare a confession of sin. God has no answer for them. No\nanswer in words can reply to a question of things. It is\nnot in an arbitrary “decree of God,” but in the nature\nof man, that a veil shuts down on the facts of to-morrow;\nfor the soul will not have us read any other cipher than\nthat of cause and effect. By this veil which curtains\nevents it instructs the children of men to live in to-day.\nThe only mode of obtaining an answer to these questions\nof the senses is to forego all low curiosity, and,\naccepting the tide of being which floats us into the\nsecret of nature, work and live, work and live, and all\nunawares the advancing soul has built and forged for\nitself a new condition, and the question and the answer\nare one.",
        "By the same fire, vital, consecrating, celestial, which\nburns until it shall dissolve all things into the waves\nand surges of an ocean of light, we see and know each\nother, and what spirit each is of. Who can tell the\ngrounds of his knowledge of the character of the several\nindividuals in his circle of friends? No man. Yet their\nacts and words do not disappoint him. In that man, though\nhe knew no ill of him, he put no trust. In that other,\nthough they had seldom met, authentic signs had yet passed,\nto signify that he might be trusted as one who had an\ninterest in his own character. We know each other very well,\n—which of us has been just to himself and whether that\nwhich we teach or behold is only an aspiration or is our\nhonest effort also.",
        "We are all discerners of spirits. That diagnosis lies\naloft in our life or unconscious power. The intercourse\nof society, its trade, its religion, its friendships,\nits quarrels, is one wide, judicial investigation of\ncharacter. In full court, or in small committee, or\nconfronted face to face, accuser and accused, men offer\nthemselves to be judged. Against their will they exhibit\nthose decisive trifles by which character is read. But\nwho judges? and what? Not our understanding. We do not\nread them by learning or craft. No; the wisdom of the\nwise man consists herein, that he does not judge them;\nhe lets them judge themselves and merely reads and\nrecords their own verdict.",
        "By virtue of this inevitable nature, private will\nis overpowered, and, maugre our efforts or our\nimperfections, your genius will speak from you,\nand mine from me. That which we are, we shall teach,\nnot voluntarily but involuntarily. Thoughts come into\nour minds by avenues which we never left open, and\nthoughts go out of our minds through avenues which we\nnever voluntarily opened. Character teaches over our\nhead. The infallible index of true progress is found\nin the tone the man takes. Neither his age, nor his\nbreeding, nor company, nor books, nor actions, nor\ntalents, nor all together can hinder him from being\ndeferential to a higher spirit than his own. If he\nhave not found his home in God, his manners, his\nforms of speech, the turn of his sentences, the build,\nshall I say, of all his opinions will involuntarily\nconfess it, let him brave it out how he will. If he\nhave found his centre, the Deity will shine through\nhim, through all the disguises of ignorance, of\nungenial temperament, of unfavorable circumstance.\nThe tone of seeking is one, and the tone of having\nis another.",
        "The great distinction between teachers sacred or\nliterary,—between poets like Herbert, and poets\nlike Pope,—between philosophers like Spinoza, Kant\nand Coleridge, and philosophers like Locke, Paley,\nMackintosh and Stewart,—between men of the world\nwho are reckoned accomplished talkers, and here and\nthere a fervent mystic, prophesying half insane under\nthe infinitude of his thought,—is that one class\nspeak from within, or from experience, as parties\nand possessors of the fact; and the other class from\nwithout, as spectators merely, or perhaps as acquainted\nwith the fact on the evidence of third persons. It is\nof no use to preach to me from without. I can do that\ntoo easily myself. Jesus speaks always from within,\nand in a degree that transcends all others. In that is\nthe miracle. I believe beforehand that it ought so to\nbe. All men stand continually in the expectation of the\nappearance of such a teacher.  But if a man do not speak\nfrom within the veil, where the word is one with that it\ntells of, let him lowly confess it.",
        "The same Omniscience flows into the intellect, and makes\nwhat we call genius. Much of the wisdom of the world is\nnot wisdom, and the most illuminated class of men are no\ndoubt superior to literary fame, and are not writers.\nAmong the multitude of scholars and authors, we feel no\nhallowing presence; we are sensible of a knack and skill\nrather than of inspiration; they have a light and know\nnot whence it comes and call it their own; their talent\nis some exaggerated faculty, some overgrown member, so\nthat their strength is a disease. In these instances the\nintellectual gifts do not make the impression of virtue,\nbut almost of vice; and we feel that a man’s talents stand\nin the way of his advancement in truth. But genius is\nreligious. It is a larger imbibing of the common heart.\nIt is not anomalous, but more like and not less like other\nmen. There is in all great poets a wisdom of humanity\nwhich is superior to any talents they exercise. The author,\nthe wit, the partisan, the fine gentleman, does not take\nplace of the man. Humanity shines in Homer, in Chaucer, in\nSpenser, in Shakspeare, in Milton. They are content with\ntruth. They use the positive degree. They seem frigid and\nphlegmatic to those who have been spiced with the frantic\npassion and violent coloring of inferior but popular\nwriters. For they are poets by the free course which they\nallow to the informing soul, which through their eyes\nbeholds again and blesses the things which it hath made.\nThe soul is superior to its knowledge, wiser than any of\nits works. The great poet makes us feel our own wealth,\nand then we think less of his compositions. His best\ncommunication to our mind is to teach us to despise all\nhe has done. Shakspeare carries us to such a lofty strain\nof intelligent activity as to suggest a wealth which\nbeggars his own; and we then feel that the splendid works\nwhich he has created, and which in other hours we extol\nas a sort of self-existent poetry, take no stronger hold\nof real nature than the shadow of a passing traveller on\nthe rock. The inspiration which uttered itself in Hamlet\nand Lear could utter things as good from day to day for\never. Why then should I make account of Hamlet and Lear,\nas if we had not the soul from which they fell as syllables\nfrom the tongue?",
        "This energy does not descend into individual life on\nany other condition than entire possession. It comes\nto the lowly and simple; it comes to whomsoever will\nput off what is foreign and proud; it comes as insight;\nit comes as serenity and grandeur. When we see those\nwhom it inhabits, we are apprised of new degrees of\ngreatness. From that inspiration the man comes back\nwith a changed tone. He does not talk with men with\nan eye to their opinion. He tries them. It requires\nof us to be plain and true. The vain traveller attempts\nto embellish his life by quoting my lord and the prince\nand the countess, who thus said or did to him. The\nambitious vulgar show you their spoons and brooches and\nrings, and preserve their cards and compliments. The\nmore cultivated, in their account of their own experience,\ncull out the pleasing, poetic circumstance,—the visit to\nRome, the man of genius they saw, the brilliant friend\nThey know; still further on perhaps the gorgeous landscape,\nthe mountain lights, the mountain thoughts they enjoyed\nyesterday,—and so seek to throw a romantic color over\ntheir life. But the soul that ascends to worship the\ngreat God is plain and true; has no rose-color, no fine\nfriends, no chivalry, no adventures; does not want\nadmiration; dwells in the hour that now is, in the\nearnest experience of the common day,—by reason of the\npresent moment and the mere trifle having become porous\nto thought and bibulous of the sea of light.",
        "Converse with a mind that is grandly simple, and\nliterature looks like word-catching. The simplest\nutterances are worthiest to be written, yet are\nthey so cheap and so things of course, that in the\ninfinite riches of the soul it is like gathering a\nfew pebbles off the ground, or bottling a little\nair in a phial, when the whole earth and the whole\natmosphere are ours. Nothing can pass there, or make\nyou one of the circle, but the casting aside your\ntrappings, and dealing man to man in naked truth,\nplain confession, and omniscient affirmation.",
        "Souls such as these treat you as gods would, walk as\ngods in the earth, accepting without any admiration\nyour wit, your bounty, your virtue even,—say rather\nyour act of duty, for your virtue they own as their\nproper blood, royal as themselves, and over-royal,\nand the father of the gods. But what rebuke their\nplain fraternal bearing casts on the mutual flattery\nwith which authors solace each other and wound\nthemselves! These flatter not. I do not wonder that\nthese men go to see Cromwell and Christina and Charles\nthe Second and James the First and the Grand Turk. For\nthey are, in their own elevation, the fellows of kings,\nand must feel the servile tone of conversation in the\nworld. They must always be a godsend to princes, for\nthey confront them, a king to a king, without ducking\nor concession, and give a high nature the refreshment\nand satisfaction of resistance, of plain humanity, of\neven companionship and of new ideas. They leave them\nwiser and superior men. Souls like these make us feel\nthat sincerity is more excellent than flattery. Deal so\nplainly with man and woman as to constrain the utmost\nsincerity and destroy all hope of trifling with you. It\nis the highest compliment you can pay. Their “highest\npraising,” said Milton, “is not flattery, and their\nplainest advice is a kind of praising.”",
        "Ineffable is the union of man and God in every act\nof the soul. The simplest person who in his integrity\nworships God, becomes God; yet for ever and ever the\ninflux of this better and universal self is new and\nunsearchable. It inspires awe and astonishment. How\ndear, how soothing to man, arises the idea of God,\npeopling the lonely place, effacing the scars of our\nmistakes and disappointments! When we have broken our\ngod of tradition and ceased from our god of rhetoric,\nthen may God fire the heart with his presence. It is\nthe doubling of the heart itself, nay, the infinite\nenlargement of the heart with a power of growth to a\nnew infinity on every side. It inspires in man an\ninfallible trust. He has not the conviction, but the\nsight, that the best is the true, and may in that\nthought easily dismiss all particular uncertainties\nand fears, and adjourn to the sure revelation of time\nthe solution of his private riddles. He is sure that\nhis welfare is dear to the heart of being. In the\npresence of law to his mind he is overflowed with a\nreliance so universal that it sweeps away all cherished\nhopes and the most stable projects of mortal condition\nin its flood. He believes that he cannot escape from\nhis good. The things that are really for thee gravitate\nto thee. You are running to seek your friend. Let your\nfeet run, but your mind need not. If you do not find\nhim, will you not acquiesce that it is best you should\nnot find him? for there is a power, which, as it is in\nyou, is in him also, and could therefore very well bring\nyou together, if it were for the best. You are preparing\nwith eagerness to go and render a service to which your\ntalent and your taste invite you, the love of men and\nthe hope of fame. Has it not occurred to you that you\nhave no right to go, unless you are equally willing to\nbe prevented from going? O, believe, as thou livest, that\nevery sound that is spoken over the round world, which\nthou oughtest to hear, will vibrate on thine ear! Every\nproverb, every book, every byword that belongs to thee\nfor aid or comfort, shall surely come home through open\nor winding passages. Every friend whom not thy fantastic\nwill but the great and tender heart in thee craveth,\nshall lock thee in his embrace. And this because the\nheart in thee is the heart of all; not a valve, not a\nwall, not an intersection is there anywhere in nature,\nbut one blood rolls uninterruptedly an endless circulation\nthrough all men, as the water of the globe is all one sea,\nand, truly seen, its tide is one.",
        "Let man then learn the revelation of all nature and\nall thought to his heart; this, namely; that the\nHighest dwells with him; that the sources of nature\nare in his own mind, if the sentiment of duty is\nthere. But if he would know what the great God\nspeaketh, he must ’go into his closet and shut the\ndoor,’ as Jesus said. God will not make himself\nmanifest to cowards. He must greatly listen to himself,\nwithdrawing himself from all the accents of other men’s\ndevotion. Even their prayers are hurtful to him, until\nhe have made his own. Our religion vulgarly stands on\nnumbers of believers. Whenever the appeal is made,—no\nmatter how indirectly,—to numbers, proclamation is then\nand there made that religion is not. He that finds God a\nsweet enveloping thought to him never counts his company.\nWhen I sit in that presence, who shall dare to come in?\nWhen I rest in perfect humility, when I burn with pure\nlove, what can Calvin or Swedenborg say?",
        "It makes no difference whether the appeal is to\nnumbers or to one. The faith that stands on authority\nis not faith. The reliance on authority measures the\ndecline of religion, the withdrawal of the soul. The\nposition men have given to Jesus, now for many centuries\nof history, is a position of authority. It characterizes\nthemselves. It cannot alter the eternal facts. Great is\nthe soul, and plain. It is no flatterer, it is no\nfollower; it never appeals from itself. It believes in\nitself. Before the immense possibilities of man all mere\nexperience, all past biography, however spotless and\nsainted, shrinks away. Before that heaven which our\npresentiments foreshow us, we cannot easily praise any\nform of life we have seen or read of.  We not only affirm\nthat we have few great men, but, absolutely speaking,\nthat we have none; that we have no history, no record of\nany character or mode of living that entirely contents\nus. The saints and demigods whom history worships we are\nconstrained to accept with a grain of allowance. Though\nin our lonely hours we draw a new strength out of their\nmemory, yet, pressed on our attention, as they are by\nthe thoughtless and customary, they fatigue and invade.\nThe soul gives itself, alone, original and pure, to the\nLonely, Original and Pure, who, on that condition, gladly\ninhabits, leads and speaks through it. Then is it glad,\nyoung and nimble. It is not wise, but it sees through all\nthings. It is not called religious, but it is innocent.\nIt calls the light its own, and feels that the grass grows\nand the stone falls by a law inferior to, and dependent\non, its nature. Behold, it saith, I am born into the great,\nthe universal mind. I, the imperfect, adore my own Perfect.\nI am somehow receptive of the great soul, and thereby I do\nOverlook the sun and the stars and feel them to be the fair\naccidents and effects which change and pass. More and more\nthe surges of everlasting nature enter into me, and I\nbecome public and human in my regards and actions. So come\nI to live in thoughts and act with energies which are\nimmortal. Thus revering the soul, and learning, as the\nancient said, that “its beauty is immense,” man will come\nto see that the world is the perennial miracle which the\nsoul worketh, and be less astonished at particular wonders;\nhe will learn that there is no profane history; that all\nhistory is sacred; that the universe is represented in an\natom, in a moment of time. He will weave no longer a spotted\nlife of shreds and patches, but he will live with a divine\nunity. He will cease from what is base and frivolous in his\nlife and be content with all places and with any service he\ncan render. He will calmly front the morrow in the negligency\nof that trust which carries God with it and so hath already\nthe whole future in the bottom of the heart.",
