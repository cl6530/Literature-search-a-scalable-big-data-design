        "Goriot had brought with him a considerable wardrobe, the gorgeous\noutfit of a retired tradesman who denies himself nothing. Mme.\nVauquer’s astonished eyes beheld no less than eighteen\ncambric-fronted shirts, the splendor of their fineness being enhanced\nby a pair of pins each bearing a large diamond, and connected by a\nshort chain, an ornament which adorned the vermicelli-maker’s shirt\nfront. He usually wore a coat of corn-flower blue; his rotund and\nportly person was still further set off by a clean white waistcoat,\nand a gold chain and seals which dangled over that broad expanse. When\nhis hostess accused him of being “a bit of a beau,” he smiled with the\nvanity of a citizen whose foible is gratified. His cupboards\n(ormoires, as he called them in the popular dialect) were filled\nwith a quantity of plate that he brought with him. The widow’s eyes\ngleamed as she obligingly helped him to unpack the soup ladles,\ntable-spoons, forks, cruet-stands, tureens, dishes, and breakfast\nservices–all of silver, which were duly arranged upon shelves, besides\na few more or less handsome pieces of plate, all weighing no\ninconsiderable number of ounces; he could not bring himself to part\nwith these gifts that reminded him of past domestic festivals.",
        "“This was my wife’s present to me on the first anniversary of our\nwedding day,” he said to Mme. Vauquer, as he put away a little silver\nposset dish, with two turtle-doves billing on the cover. “Poor dear!\nshe spent on it all the money she had saved before we were married. Do\nyou know, I would sooner scratch the earth with my nails for a living,\nmadame, than part with that. But I shall be able to take my coffee out\nof it every morning for the rest of my days, thank the Lord! I am not\nto be pitied. There’s not much fear of my starving for some time to\ncome.”",
        "Finally, Mme. Vauquer’s magpie’s eye had discovered and read certain\nentries in the list of shareholders in the funds, and, after a rough\ncalculation, was disposed to credit Goriot (worthy man) with something\nlike ten thousand francs a year. From that day forward Mme. Vauquer\n(nee de Conflans), who, as a matter of fact, had seen forty-eight\nsummers, though she would only own to thirty-nine of them–Mme.\nVauquer had her own ideas. Though Goriot’s eyes seemed to have shrunk\nin their sockets, though they were weak and watery, owing to some\nglandular affection which compelled him to wipe them continually, she\nconsidered him to be a very gentlemanly and pleasant-looking man.\nMoreover, the widow saw favorable indications of character in the\nwell-developed calves of his legs and in his square-shaped nose,\nindications still further borne out by the worthy man’s full-moon\ncountenance and look of stupid good-nature. This, in all probability,\nwas a strongly-build animal, whose brains mostly consisted in a\ncapacity for affection. His hair, worn in ailes de pigeon, and duly\npowdered every morning by the barber from the Ecole Polytechnique,\ndescribed five points on his low forehead, and made an elegant setting\nto his face. Though his manners were somewhat boorish, he was always\nas neat as a new pin and he took his snuff in a lordly way, like a man\nwho knows that his snuff-box is always likely to be filled with\nmaccaboy, so that when Mme. Vauquer lay down to rest on the day of M.\nGoriot’s installation, her heart, like a larded partridge, sweltered\nbefore the fire of a burning desire to shake off the shroud of Vauquer\nand rise again as Goriot. She would marry again, sell her\nboarding-house, give her hand to this fine flower of citizenship,\nbecome a lady of consequence in the quarter, and ask for subscriptions\nfor charitable purposes; she would make little Sunday excursions to\nChoisy, Soissy, Gentilly; she would have a box at the theatre when she\nliked, instead of waiting for the author’s tickets that one of her\nboarders sometimes gave her, in July; the whole Eldorado of a little\nParisian household rose up before Mme. Vauquer in her dreams. Nobody\nknew that she herself possessed forty thousand francs, accumulated sou\nby sou, that was her secret; surely as far as money was concerned she\nwas a very tolerable match. “And in other respects, I am quite his\nequal,” she said to herself, turning as if to assure herself of the\ncharms of a form that the portly Sylvie found moulded in down feathers\nevery morning.",
        "For three months from that day Mme. Veuve Vauquer availed herself of\nthe services of M. Goriot’s coiffeur, and went to some expense over\nher toilette, expense justifiable on the ground that she owed it to\nherself and her establishment to pay some attention to appearances\nwhen such highly-respectable persons honored her house with their\npresence. She expended no small amount of ingenuity in a sort of\nweeding process of her lodgers, announcing her intention of receiving\nhenceforward none but people who were in every way select. If a\nstranger presented himself, she let him know that M. Goriot, one of\nthe best known and most highly-respected merchants in Paris, had\nsingled out her boarding-house for a residence. She drew up a\nprospectus headed MAISON VAUQUER, in which it was asserted that hers\nwas ’one of the oldest and most highly recommended boarding-houses in\nthe Latin Quarter.” “From the windows of the house,” thus ran the\nprospectus, “there is a charming view of the Vallee des Gobelins (so\nthere is–from the third floor), and a beautiful garden, extendingdown to an avenue of lindens at the further end.” Mention was made\nof the bracing air of the place and its quiet situation.",
        "It was this prospectus that attracted Mme. la Comtesse de\nl’Ambermesnil, a widow of six and thirty, who was awaiting the final\nsettlement of her husband’s affairs, and of another matter regarding a\npension due to her as the wife of a general who had died “on the field\nof battle.” On this Mme. Vauquer saw to her table, lighted a fire\ndaily in the sitting-room for nearly six months, and kept the promise\nof her prospectus, even going to some expense to do so. And the\nCountess, on her side, addressed Mme. Vauquer as “my dear,” and\npromised her two more boarders, the Baronne de Vaumerland and the\nwidow of a colonel, the late Comte de Picquoisie, who were about to\nleave a boarding-house in the Marais, where the terms were higher than\nat the Maison Vauquer. Both these ladies, moreover, would be very well\nto do when the people at the War Office had come to an end of their\nformalities. “But Government departments are always so dilatory,” the\nlady added.",
        "After dinner the two widows went together up to Mme. Vauquer’s room,\nand had a snug little chat over some cordial and various delicacies\nreserved for the mistress of the house. Mme. Vauquer’s ideas as to\nGoriot were cordially approved by Mme. de l’Ambermesnil; it was a\ncapital notion, which for that matter she had guessed from the very\nfirst; in her opinion the vermicelli maker was an excellent man.",
        "“Ah! my dear lady, such a well-preserved man of his age, as sound as\nmy eyesight–a man who might make a woman happy!” said the widow.",
        "The good-natured Countess turned to the subject of Mme. Vauquer’s\ndress, which was not in harmony with her projects. “You must put\nyourself on a war footing,” said she.",
        "After much serious consideration the two widows went shopping\ntogether–they purchased a hat adorned with ostrich feathers and a cap\nat the Palais Royal, and the Countess took her friend to the Magasin\nde la Petite Jeannette, where they chose a dress and a scarf. Thus\nequipped for the campaign, the widow looked exactly like the prize\nanimal hung out for a sign above an a la mode beef shop; but she\nherself was so much pleased with the improvement, as she considered\nit, in her appearance, that she felt that she lay under some\nobligation to the Countess; and, though by no means open-handed, she\nbegged that lady to accept a hat that cost twenty francs. The fact was\nthat she needed the Countess’ services on the delicate mission of\nsounding Goriot; the countess must sing her praises in his ears. Mme.\nde l’Ambermesnil lent herself very good-naturedly to this manoeuvre,\nbegan her operations, and succeeded in obtaining a private interview;\nbut the overtures that she made, with a view to securing him for\nherself, were received with embarrassment, not to say a repulse. She\nleft him, revolted by his coarseness.",
        "“My angel,” said she to her dear friend, “you will make nothing of\nthat man yonder. He is absurdly suspicious, and he is a mean\ncurmudgeon, an idiot, a fool; you would never be happy with him.”",
        "After what had passed between M. Goriot and Mme. de l’Ambermesnil, the\nCountess would no longer live under the same roof. She left the next\nday, forgot to pay for six months’ board, and left behind her\nwardrobe, cast-off clothing to the value of five francs. Eagerly and\npersistently as Mme. Vauquer sought her quondam lodger, the Comtesse\nde l’Ambermesnil was never heard of again in Paris. The widow often\ntalked of this deplorable business, and regretted her own too\nconfiding disposition. As a matter of fact, she was as suspicious as a\ncat; but she was like many other people, who cannot trust their own\nkin and put themselves at the mercy of the next chance comer–an odd\nbut common phenomenon, whose causes may readily be traced to the\ndepths of the human heart.",
        "Perhaps there are people who know that they have nothing more to look\nfor from those with whom they live; they have shown the emptiness of\ntheir hearts to their housemates, and in their secret selves they are\nconscious that they are severely judged, and that they deserve to be\njudged severely; but still they feel an unconquerable craving for\npraises that they do not hear, or they are consumed by a desire to\nappear to possess, in the eyes of a new audience, the qualities which\nthey have not, hoping to win the admiration or affection of strangers\nat the risk of forfeiting it again some day. Or, once more, there are\nother mercenary natures who never do a kindness to a friend or a\nrelation simply because these have a claim upon them, while a service\ndone to a stranger brings its reward to self-love. Such natures feel\nbut little affection for those who are nearest to them; they keep\ntheir kindness for remoter circles of acquaintance, and show most to\nthose who dwell on its utmost limits. Mme. Vauquer belonged to both\nthese essentially mean, false, and execrable classes.",
        "“If I had been there at the time,” Vautrin would say at the end of the\nstory, “I would have shown her up, and that misfortune would not have\nbefallen you. I know that kind of phiz!”",
        "Like all narrow natures, Mme. Vauquer was wont to confine her\nattention to events, and did not go very deeply into the causes that\nbrought them about; she likewise preferred to throw the blame of her\nown mistakes on other people, so she chose to consider that the honest\nvermicelli maker was responsible for her misfortune. It had opened her\neyes, so she said, with regard to him. As soon as she saw that her\nblandishments were in vain, and that her outlay on her toilette was\nmoney thrown away, she was not slow to discover the reason of his\nindifference. It became plain to her at once that there was some\nother attraction, to use her own expression. In short, it was evident\nthat the hope she had so fondly cherished was a baseless delusion, and\nthat she would “never make anything out of that man yonder,” in the\nCountess’ forcible phrase. The Countess seemed to have been a judge of\ncharacter. Mme. Vauquer’s aversion was naturally more energetic than\nher friendship, for her hatred was not in proportion to her love, but\nto her disappointed expectations. The human heart may find here and\nthere a resting-place short of the highest height of affection, but we\nseldom stop in the steep, downward slope of hatred. Still, M. Goriot\nwas a lodger, and the widow’s wounded self-love could not vent itself\nin an explosion of wrath; like a monk harassed by the prior of his\nconvent, she was forced to stifle her sighs of disappointment, and to\ngulp down her craving for revenge. Little minds find gratification for\ntheir feelings, benevolent or otherwise, by a constant exercise of\npetty ingenuity. The widow employed her woman’s malice to devise a\nsystem of covert persecution. She began by a course of retrenchment\n–various luxuries which had found their way to the table appeared\nthere no more.",
        "“No more gherkins, no more anchovies; they have made a fool of me!\"\nshe said to Sylvie one morning, and they returned to the old bill of\nfare.",
        "The thrifty frugality necessary to those who mean to make their way in\nthe world had become an inveterate habit of life with M. Goriot. Soup,\nboiled beef, and a dish of vegetables had been, and always would be,\nthe dinner he liked best, so Mme. Vauquer found it very difficult to\nannoy a boarder whose tastes were so simple. He was proof against her\nmalice, and in desperation she spoke to him and of him slightingly\nbefore the other lodgers, who began to amuse themselves at his\nexpense, and so gratified her desire for revenge.",
        "Towards the end of the first year the widow’s suspicions had reached\nsuch a pitch that she began to wonder how it was that a retired\nmerchant with a secure income of seven or eight thousand livres, the\nowner of such magnificent plate and jewelry handsome enough for a kept\nmistress, should be living in her house. Why should he devote so small\na proportion of his money to his expenses? Until the first year was\nnearly at an end, Goriot had dined out once or twice every week, but\nthese occasions came less frequently, and at last he was scarcely\nabsent from the dinner-table twice a month. It was hardly expected\nthat Mme. Vauquer should regard the increased regularity of her\nboarder’s habits with complacency, when those little excursions of his\nhad been so much to her interest. She attributed the change not so\nmuch to a gradual diminution of fortune as to a spiteful wish to annoy\nhis hostess. It is one of the most detestable habits of a Liliputian\nmind to credit other people with its own malignant pettiness.",
        "Unluckily, towards the end of the second year, M. Goriot’s conduct\ngave some color to the idle talk about him. He asked Mme. Vauquer to\ngive him a room on the second floor, and to make a corresponding\nreduction in her charges. Apparently, such strict economy was called\nfor, that he did without a fire all through the winter. Mme. Vauquer\nasked to be paid in advance, an arrangement to which M. Goriot\nconsented, and thenceforward she spoke of him as “Father Goriot.”",
        "What had brought about this decline and fall? Conjecture was keen, but\ninvestigation was difficult. Father Goriot was not communicative; in\nthe sham countess’ phrase he was “a curmudgeon.” Empty-headed people\nwho babble about their own affairs because they have nothing else to\noccupy them, naturally conclude that if people say nothing of their\ndoings it is because their doings will not bear being talked about; so\nthe highly respectable merchant became a scoundrel, and the late beau\nwas an old rogue. Opinion fluctuated. Sometimes, according to Vautrin,\nwho came about this time to live in the Maison Vauquer, Father Goriot\nwas a man who went on ’Change and dabbled (to use the sufficiently\nexpressive language of the Stock Exchange) in stocks and shares after\nhe had ruined himself by heavy speculation. Sometimes it was held that\nhe was one of those petty gamblers who nightly play for small stakes\nuntil they win a few francs. A theory that he was a detective in the\nemploy of the Home Office found favor at one time, but Vautrin urged\nthat “Goriot was not sharp enough for one of that sort.” There were\nyet other solutions; Father Goriot was a skinflint, a shark of a\nmoney-lender, a man who lived by selling lottery tickets. He was by\nturns all the most mysterious brood of vice and shame and misery; yet,\nhowever vile his life might be, the feeling of repulsion which he\naroused in others was not so strong that he must be banished from\ntheir society–he paid his way. Besides, Goriot had his uses, every\none vented his spleen or sharpened his wit on him; he was pelted with\njokes and belabored with hard words. The general consensus of opinion\nwas in favor of a theory which seemed the most likely; this was Mme.\nVauquer’s view. According to her, the man so well preserved at his\ntime of life, as sound as her eyesight, with whom a woman might be\nvery happy, was a libertine who had strange tastes. These are the\nfacts upon which Mme. Vauquer’s slanders were based.",
        "Early one morning, some few months after the departure of the unlucky\nCountess who had managed to live for six months at the widow’s\nexpense, Mme. Vauquer (not yet dressed) heard the rustle of a silk\ndress and a young woman’s light footstep on the stair; some one was\ngoing to Goriot’s room. He seemed to expect the visit, for his door\nstood ajar. The portly Sylvie presently came up to tell her mistress\nthat a girl too pretty to be honest, “dressed like a goddess,” and not\na speck of mud on her laced cashmere boots, had glided in from the\nstreet like a snake, had found the kitchen, and asked for M. Goriot’s\nroom. Mme. Vauquer and the cook, listening, overheard several words\naffectionately spoken during the visit, which lasted for some time.\nWhen M. Goriot went downstairs with the lady, the stout Sylvie\nforthwith took her basket and followed the lover-like couple, under\npretext of going to do her marketing.",
        "“M. Goriot must be awfully rich, all the same, madame,” she reported\non her return, “to keep her in such style. Just imagine it! There was\na splendid carriage waiting at the corner of the Place de l’Estrapade,\nand she got into it.”",
        "While they were at dinner that evening, Mme. Vauquer went to the\nwindow and drew the curtain, as the sun was shining into Goriot’s\neyes.",
        "“You are beloved of fair ladies, M. Goriot–the sun seeks you out,\"\nshe said, alluding to his visitor. ’Peste! you have good taste; she\nwas very pretty.”",
        "“That was my daughter,” he said, with a kind of pride in his voice,\nand the rest chose to consider this as the fatuity of an old man who\nwishes to save appearances.",
        "A month after this visit M. Goriot received another. The same daughter\nwho had come to see him that morning came again after dinner, this\ntime in evening dress. The boarders, in deep discussion in the\ndining-room, caught a glimpse of a lovely, fair-haired woman, slender,\ngraceful, and much too distinguished-looking to be a daughter of\nFather Goriot’s.",
        "“Two of them!” cried the portly Sylvie, who did not recognize the lady\nof the first visit.",
        "A few days later, and another young lady–a tall, well-moulded\nbrunette, with dark hair and bright eyes–came to ask for M. Goriot.",
        "“Three of them!” said Sylvie.",
        "Then the second daughter, who had first come in the morning to see her\nfather, came shortly afterwards in the evening. She wore a ball dress,\nand came in a carriage.",
        "“Four of them!” commented Mme. Vauquer and her plump handmaid. Sylvie\nsaw not a trace of resemblance between this great lady and the girl in\nher simple morning dress who had entered her kitchen on the occasion\nof her first visit.",
        "At that time Goriot was paying twelve hundred francs a year to his\nlandlady, and Mme. Vauquer saw nothing out of the common in the fact\nthat a rich man had four or five mistresses; nay, she thought it very\nknowing of him to pass them off as his daughters. She was not at all\ninclined to draw a hard-and-fast line, or to take umbrage at his\nsending for them to the Maison Vauquer; yet, inasmuch as these visits\nexplained her boarder’s indifference to her, she went so far (at the\nend of the second year) as to speak of him as an “ugly old wretch.\"\nWhen at length her boarder declined to nine hundred francs a year, she\nasked him very insolently what he took her house to be, after meeting\none of these ladies on the stairs. Father Goriot answered that the\nlady was his eldest daughter.",
        "“So you have two or three dozen daughters, have you?” said Mme.\nVauquer sharply.",
        "“I have only two,” her boarder answered meekly, like a ruined man who\nis broken in to all the cruel usage of misfortune.",
        "Towards the end of the third year Father Goriot reduced his expenses\nstill further; he went up to the third story, and now paid forty-five\nfrancs a month. He did without snuff, told his hairdresser that he no\nlonger required his services, and gave up wearing powder. When Goriot\nappeared for the first time in this condition, an exclamation of\nastonishment broke from his hostess at the color of his hair–a dingy\nolive gray. He had grown sadder day by day under the influence of some\nhidden trouble; among all the faces round the table, his was the most\nwoe-begone. There was no longer any doubt. Goriot was an elderly\nlibertine, whose eyes had only been preserved by the skill of the\nphysician from the malign influence of the remedies necessitated by\nthe state of his health. The disgusting color of his hair was a result\nof his excesses and of the drugs which he had taken that he might\ncontinue his career. The poor old man’s mental and physical condition\nafforded some grounds for the absurd rubbish talked about him. When\nhis outfit was worn out, he replaced the fine linen by calico at\nfourteen sous the ell. His diamonds, his gold snuff-box, watch-chain\nand trinkets, disappeared one by one. He had left off wearing the\ncorn-flower blue coat, and was sumptuously arrayed, summer as well as\nwinter, in a coarse chestnut-brown coat, a plush waistcoat, and\ndoeskin breeches. He grew thinner and thinner; his legs were shrunken,\nhis cheeks, once so puffed out by contented bourgeois prosperity, were\ncovered with wrinkles, and the outlines of the jawbones were\ndistinctly visible; there were deep furrows in his forehead. In the\nfourth year of his residence in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve he was\nno longer like his former self. The hale vermicelli manufacturer,\nsixty-two years of age, who had looked scarce forty, the stout,\ncomfortable, prosperous tradesman, with an almost bucolic air, and\nsuch a brisk demeanor that it did you good to look at him; the man\nwith something boyish in his smile, had suddenly sunk into his dotage,\nand had become a feeble, vacillating septuagenarian.",
        "The keen, bright blue eyes had grown dull, and faded to a steel-gray\ncolor; the red inflamed rims looked as though they had shed tears of\nblood. He excited feelings of repulsion in some, and of pity in\nothers. The young medical students who came to the house noticed the\ndrooping of his lower lip and the conformation of the facial angle;\nand, after teasing him for some time to no purpose, they declared that\ncretinism was setting in.",
        "One evening after dinner Mme. Vauquer said half banteringly to him,\n“So those daughters of yours don’t come to see you any more, eh?\"\nmeaning to imply her doubts as to his paternity; but Father Goriot\nshrank as if his hostess had touched him with a sword-point.",
        "“They come sometimes,” he said in a tremulous voice.",
        "“Aha! you still see them sometimes?” cried the students. “Bravo,\nFather Goriot!”",
        "The old man scarcely seemed to hear the witticisms at his expense that\nfollowed on the words; he had relapsed into the dreamy state of mind\nthat these superficial observers took for senile torpor, due to his\nlack of intelligence. If they had only known, they might have been\ndeeply interested by the problem of his condition; but few problems\nwere more obscure. It was easy, of course, to find out whether Goriot\nhad really been a vermicelli manufacturer; the amount of his fortune\nwas readily discoverable; but the old people, who were most\ninquisitive as to his concerns, never went beyond the limits of the\nQuarter, and lived in the lodging-house much as oysters cling to a\nrock. As for the rest, the current of life in Paris daily awaited\nthem, and swept them away with it; so soon as they left the Rue\nNeuve-Sainte-Genevieve, they forgot the existence of the old man,\ntheir butt at dinner. For those narrow souls, or for careless youth,\nthe misery in Father Goriot’s withered face and its dull apathy were\nquite incompatible with wealth or any sort of intelligence. As for the\ncreatures whom he called his daughters, all Mme. Vauquer’s boarders\nwere of her opinion. With the faculty for severe logic sedulously\ncultivated by elderly women during long evenings of gossip till they\ncan always find an hypothesis to fit all circumstances, she was wont\nto reason thus:",
        "“If Father Goriot had daughters of his own as rich as those ladies who\ncame here seemed to be, he would not be lodging in my house, on the\nthird floor, at forty-five francs a month; and he would not go about\ndressed like a poor man.”",
        "No objection could be raised to these inferences. So by the end of the\nmonth of November 1819, at the time when the curtain rises on this\ndrama, every one in the house had come to have a very decided opinion\nas to the poor old man. He had never had either wife or daughter;\nexcesses had reduced him to this sluggish condition; he was a sort of\nhuman mollusk who should be classed among the capulidoe, so one of the\ndinner contingent, an employe at the Museum, who had a pretty wit of\nhis own. Poiret was an eagle, a gentleman, compared with Goriot.\nPoiret would join the talk, argue, answer when he was spoken to; as a\nmatter of fact, his talk, arguments, and responses contributed nothing\nto the conversation, for Poiret had a habit of repeating what the\nothers said in different words; still, he did join in the talk; he was\nalive, and seemed capable of feeling; while Father Goriot (to quote\nthe Museum official again) was invariably at zero degrees–Reaumur.",
        "Eugene de Rastignac had just returned to Paris in a state of mind not\nunknown to young men who are conscious of unusual powers, and to those\nwhose faculties are so stimulated by a difficult position, that for\nthe time being they rise above the ordinary level.",
        "Rastignac’s first year of study for the preliminary examinations in\nlaw had left him free to see the sights of Paris and to enjoy some of\nits amusements. A student has not much time on his hands if he sets\nhimself to learn the repertory of every theatre, and to study the ins\nand outs of the labyrinth of Paris. To know its customs; to learn the\nlanguage, and become familiar with the amusements of the capital, he\nmust explore its recesses, good and bad, follow the studies that\nplease him best, and form some idea of the treasures contained in\ngalleries and museums.",
        "At this stage of his career a student grows eager and excited about\nall sorts of follies that seem to him to be of immense importance. He\nhas his hero, his great man, a professor at the College de France,\npaid to talk down to the level of his audience. He adjusts his cravat,\nand strikes various attitudes for the benefit of the women in the\nfirst galleries at the Opera-Comique. As he passes through all these\nsuccessive initiations, and breaks out of his sheath, the horizons of\nlife widen around him, and at length he grasps the plan of society\nwith the different human strata of which it is composed.",
        "If he begins by admiring the procession of carriages on sunny\nafternoons in the Champs-Elysees, he soon reaches the further stage of\nenvying their owners. Unconsciously, Eugene had served his\napprenticeship before he went back to Angouleme for the long vacation\nafter taking his degrees as bachelor of arts and bachelor of law. The\nillusions of childhood had vanished, so also had the ideas he brought\nwith him from the provinces; he had returned thither with an\nintelligence developed, with loftier ambitions, and saw things as they\nwere at home in the old manor house. His father and mother, his two\nbrothers and two sisters, with an aged aunt, whose whole fortune\nconsisted in annuities, lived on the little estate of Rastignac. The\nwhole property brought in about three thousand francs; and though the\namount varied with the season (as must always be the case in a\nvine-growing district), they were obliged to spare an unvarying twelve\nhundred francs out of their income for him. He saw how constantly the\npoverty, which they had generously hidden from him, weighed upon them;\nhe could not help comparing the sisters, who had seemed so beautiful\nto his boyish eyes, with women in Paris, who had realized the beauty\nof his dreams. The uncertain future of the whole family depended upon\nhim. It did not escape his eyes that not a crumb was wasted in the\nhouse, nor that the wine they drank was made from the second pressing;\na multitude of small things, which it is useless to speak of in detail\nhere, made him burn to distinguish himself, and his ambition to\nsucceed increased tenfold.",
        "He meant, like all great souls, that his success should be owing\nentirely to his merits; but his was pre-eminently a southern\ntemperament, the execution of his plans was sure to be marred by the\nvertigo that seizes on youth when youth sees itself alone in a wide\nsea, uncertain how to spend its energies, whither to steer its course,\nhow to adapt its sails to the winds. At first he determined to fling\nhimself heart and soul into his work, but he was diverted from this\npurpose by the need of society and connections; then he saw how great\nan influence women exert in social life, and suddenly made up his mind\nto go out into this world to seek a protectress there. Surely a clever\nand high-spirited young man, whose wit and courage were set off to\nadvantage by a graceful figure and the vigorous kind of beauty that\nreadily strikes a woman’s imagination, need not despair of finding a\nprotectress. These ideas occurred to him in his country walks with his\nsisters, whom he had once joined so gaily. The girls thought him very\nmuch changed.",
        "His aunt, Mme. de Marcillac, had been presented at court, and had\nmoved among the brightest heights of that lofty region. Suddenly the\nyoung man’s ambition discerned in those recollections of hers, which\nhad been like nursery fairy tales to her nephews and nieces, the\nelements of a social success at least as important as the success\nwhich he had achieved at the Ecole de Droit. He began to ask his aunt\nabout those relations; some of the old ties might still hold good.\nAfter much shaking of the branches of the family tree, the old lady\ncame to the conclusion that of all persons who could be useful to her\nnephew among the selfish genus of rich relations, the Vicomtesse de\nBeauseant was the least likely to refuse. To this lady, therefore, she\nwrote in the old-fashioned style, recommending Eugene to her; pointing\nout to her nephew that if he succeeded in pleasing Mme. de Beauseant,\nthe Vicomtesse would introduce him to other relations. A few days\nafter his return to Paris, therefore, Rastignac sent his aunt’s letter\nto Mme. de Beauseant. The Vicomtesse replied by an invitation to a\nball for the following evening. This was the position of affairs at\nthe Maison Vauquer at the end of November 1819.",
        "A few days later, after Mme. de Beauseant’s ball, Eugene came in at\ntwo o’clock in the morning. The persevering student meant to make up\nfor the lost time by working until daylight. It was the first time\nthat he had attempted to spend the night in this way in that silent\nquarter. The spell of a factitious energy was upon him; he had beheld\nthe pomp and splendor of the world. He had not dined at the Maison\nVauquer; the boarders probably would think that he would walk home at\ndaybreak from the dance, as he had done sometimes on former occasions,\nafter a fete at the Prado, or a ball at the Odeon, splashing his silk\nstockings thereby, and ruining his pumps.",
        "It so happened that Christophe took a look into the street before\ndrawing the bolts of the door; and Rastignac, coming in at that\nmoment, could go up to his room without making any noise, followed by\nChristophe, who made a great deal. Eugene exchanged his dress suit for\na shabby overcoat and slippers, kindled a fire with some blocks of\npatent fuel, and prepared for his night’s work in such a sort that the\nfaint sounds he made were drowned by Christophe’s heavy tramp on the\nstairs.",
        "Eugene sat absorbed in thought for a few moments before plunging into\nhis law books. He had just become aware of the fact that the\nVicomtesse de Beauseant was one of the queens of fashion, that her\nhouse was thought to be the pleasantest in the Faubourg Saint-Germain.\nAnd not only so, she was, by right of her fortune, and the name she\nbore, one of the most conspicuous figures in that aristocratic world.\nThanks to the aunt, thanks to Mme. de Marcillac’s letter of\nintroduction, the poor student had been kindly received in that house\nbefore he knew the extent of the favor thus shown to him. It was\nalmost like a patent of nobility to be admitted to those gilded\nsalons; he had appeared in the most exclusive circle in Paris, and now\nall doors were open for him. Eugene had been dazzled at first by the\nbrilliant assembly, and had scarcely exchanged a few words with the\nVicomtesse; he had been content to single out a goddess among this\nthrong of Parisian divinities, one of those women who are sure to\nattract a young man’s fancy.",
        "The Comtesse Anastasie de Restaud was tall and gracefully made; she\nhad one of the prettiest figures in Paris. Imagine a pair of great\ndark eyes, a magnificently moulded hand, a shapely foot. There was a\nfiery energy in her movements; the Marquis de Ronquerolles had called\nher “a thoroughbred,” “a pure pedigree,” these figures of speech have\nreplaced the “heavenly angel” and Ossianic nomenclature; the old\nmythology of love is extinct, doomed to perish by modern dandyism. But\nfor Rastignac, Mme. Anastasie de Restaud was the woman for whom he had\nsighed. He had contrived to write his name twice upon the list of\npartners upon her fan, and had snatched a few words with her during\nthe first quadrille.",
        "“Where shall I meet you again, Madame?” he asked abruptly, and the\ntones of his voice were full of the vehement energy that women like so\nwell.",
        "“Oh, everywhere!” said she, “in the Bois, at the Bouffons, in my own\nhouse.”",
        "With the impetuosity of his adventurous southern temper, he did all he\ncould to cultivate an acquaintance with this lovely countess, making\nthe best of his opportunities in the quadrille and during a waltz that\nshe gave him. When he told her that he was a cousin of Mme. de\nBeauseant’s, the Countess, whom he took for a great lady, asked him to\ncall at her house, and after her parting smile, Rastignac felt\nconvinced that he must make this visit. He was so lucky as to light\nupon some one who did not laugh at his ignorance, a fatal defect among\nthe gilded and insolent youth of that period; the coterie of\nMaulincourts, Maximes de Trailles, de Marsays, Ronquerolles,\nAjuda-Pintos, and Vandenesses who shone there in all the glory of\ncoxcombry among the best-dressed women of fashion in Paris–Lady\nBrandon, the Duchesse de Langeais, the Comtesse de Kergarouet, Mme. de\nSerizy, the Duchesse de Carigliano, the Comtesse Ferraud, Mme. de Lanty,\nthe Marquise d’Aiglemont, Mme. Firmiani, the Marquise de Listomere and\nthe Marquise d’Espard, the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse and the Grandlieus.\nLuckily, therefore, for him, the novice happened upon the Marquis de\nMontriveau, the lover of the Duchesse de Langeais, a general as simple\nas a child; from him Rastignac learned that the Comtesse lived in the\nRue du Helder.",
        "Ah, what it is to be young, eager to see the world, greedily on the\nwatch for any chance that brings you nearer the woman of your dreams,\nand behold two houses open their doors to you! To set foot in the\nVicomtesse de Beauseant’s house in the Faubourg Saint-Germain; to fall\non your knees before a Comtesse de Restaud in the Chaussee d’Antin; to\nlook at one glance across a vista of Paris drawing-rooms, conscious\nthat, possessing sufficient good looks, you may hope to find aid and\nprotection there in a feminine heart! To feel ambitious enough to\nspurn the tight-rope on which you must walk with the steady head of an\nacrobat for whom a fall is impossible, and to find in a charming woman\nthe best of all balancing poles.",
        "He sat there with his thoughts for a while, Law on the one hand, and\nPoverty on the other, beholding a radiant vision of a woman rise above\nthe dull, smouldering fire. Who would not have paused and questioned\nthe future as Eugene was doing? who would not have pictured it full of\nsuccess? His wondering thoughts took wings; he was transported out of\nthe present into that blissful future; he was sitting by Mme. de\nRestaud’s side, when a sort of sigh, like the grunt of an overburdened\nSt. Joseph, broke the silence of the night. It vibrated through the\nstudent, who took the sound for a death groan. He opened his door\nnoiselessly, went out upon the landing, and saw a thin streak of light\nunder Father Goriot’s door. Eugene feared that his neighbor had been\ntaken ill; he went over and looked through the keyhole; the old man\nwas busily engaged in an occupation so singular and so suspicious that\nRastignac thought he was only doing a piece of necessary service to\nsociety to watch the self-styled vermicelli maker’s nocturnal\nindustries.",
        "The table was upturned, and Goriot had doubtless in some way secured a\nsilver plate and cup to the bar before knotting a thick rope round\nthem; he was pulling at this rope with such enormous force that they\nwere being crushed and twisted out of shape; to all appearance he\nmeant to convert the richly wrought metal into ingots.",
        "“Peste! what a man!” said Rastignac, as he watched Goriot’s muscular\narms; there was not a sound in the room while the old man, with the\naid of the rope, was kneading the silver like dough. “Was he then,\nindeed, a thief, or a receiver of stolen goods, who affected\nimbecility and decrepitude, and lived like a beggar that he might\ncarry on his pursuits the more securely?” Eugene stood for a moment\nrevolving these questions, then he looked again through the keyhole.",
        "Father Goriot had unwound his coil of rope; he had covered the table\nwith a blanket, and was now employed in rolling the flattened mass of\nsilver into a bar, an operation which he performed with marvelous\ndexterity.",
        "“Why, he must be as strong as Augustus, King of Poland!” said Eugene\nto himself when the bar was nearly finished.",
        "Father Goriot looked sadly at his handiwork, tears fell from his eyes,\nhe blew out the dip which had served him for a light while he\nmanipulated the silver, and Eugene heard him sigh as he lay down\nagain.",
        "“He is mad,” thought the student.",
        "“Poor child!” Father Goriot said aloud. Rastignac, hearing those\nwords, concluded to keep silence; he would not hastily condemn his\nneighbor. He was just in the doorway of his room when a strange sound\nfrom the staircase below reached his ears; it might have been made by\ntwo men coming up in list slippers. Eugene listened; two men there\ncertainly were, he could hear their breathing. Yet there had been no\nsound of opening the street door, no footsteps in the passage.\nSuddenly, too, he saw a faint gleam of light on the second story; it\ncame from M. Vautrin’s room.",
        "“There are a good many mysteries here for a lodging-house!” he said to\nhimself.",
        "He went part of the way downstairs and listened again. The rattle of\ngold reached his ears. In another moment the light was put out, and\nagain he distinctly heard the breathing of two men, but no sound of a\ndoor being opened or shut. The two men went downstairs, the faint\nsounds growing fainter as they went.",
        "“Who is there?” cried Mme. Vauquer out of her bedroom window.",
        "“I, Mme. Vauquer,” answered Vautrin’s deep bass voice. “I am coming\nin.”",
        "“That is odd! Christophe drew the bolts,” said Eugene, going back to\nhis room. “You have to sit up at night, it seems, if you really mean\nto know all that is going on about you in Paris.”",
        "These incidents turned his thought from his ambitious dreams; he\nbetook himself to his work, but his thought wandered back to Father\nGoriot’s suspicious occupation; Mme. de Restaud’s face swam again and\nagain before his eyes like a vision of a brilliant future; and at last\nhe lay down and slept with clenched fists. When a young man makes up\nhis mind that he will work all night, the chances are that seven times\nout of ten he will sleep till morning. Such vigils do not begin before\nwe are turned twenty.",
        "The next morning Paris was wrapped in one of the dense fogs that throw\nthe most punctual people out in their calculations as to the time;\neven the most business-like folk fail to keep their appointments in\nsuch weather, and ordinary mortals wake up at noon and fancy it is\neight o’clock. On this morning it was half-past nine, and Mme. Vauquer\nstill lay abed. Christophe was late, Sylvie was late, but the two sat\ncomfortably taking their coffee as usual. It was Sylvie’s custom to\ntake the cream off the milk destined for the boarders’ breakfast for\nher own, and to boil the remainder for some time, so that madame\nshould not discover this illegal exaction.",
