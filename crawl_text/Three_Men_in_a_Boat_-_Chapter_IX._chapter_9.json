        "WE made George work, now we had got him.  He did not want to work, of \ncourse; that goes without saying.  He had had a hard time in the City, so \nhe explained.  Harris, who is callous in his nature, and not prone to \npity, said:",
        "“Ah! and now you are going to have a hard time on the river for a change; \nchange is good for everyone.  Out you get!”",
        "He could not in conscience – not even George’s conscience – object, \nthough he did suggest that, perhaps, it would be better for him to stop \nin the boat, and get tea ready, while Harris and I towed, because getting \ntea was such a worrying work, and Harris and I looked tired.  The only \nreply we made to this, however, was to pass him over the tow-line, and he \ntook it, and stepped out.",
        "There is something very strange and unaccountable about a tow-line.  You \nroll it up with as much patience and care as you would take to fold up a \nnew pair of trousers, and five minutes afterwards, when you pick it up, \nit is one ghastly, soul-revolting tangle.",
        "I do not wish to be insulting, but I firmly believe that if you took an \naverage tow-line, and stretched it out straight across the middle of a \nfield, and then turned your back on it for thirty seconds, that, when you \nlooked round again, you would find that it had got itself altogether in a \nheap in the middle of the field, and had twisted itself up, and tied \nitself into knots, and lost its two ends, and become all loops; and it \nwould take you a good half-hour, sitting down there on the grass and \nswearing all the while, to disentangle it again.",
        "That is my opinion of tow-lines in general.  Of course, there may be \nhonourable exceptions; I do not say that there are not.  There may be \ntow-lines that are a credit to their profession – conscientious, \nrespectable tow-lines – tow-lines that do not imagine they are crochet-\nwork, and try to knit themselves up into antimacassars the instant they \nare left to themselves.  I say there MAY be such tow-lines; I sincerely \nhope there are.  But I have not met with them.",
        "This tow-line I had taken in myself just before we had got to the lock.  \nI would not let Harris touch it, because he is careless.  I had looped it \nround slowly and cautiously, and tied it up in the middle, and folded it \nin two, and laid it down gently at the bottom of the boat.  Harris had \nlifted it up scientifically, and had put it into George’s hand.  George \nhad taken it firmly, and held it away from him, and had begun to unravel \nit as if he were taking the swaddling clothes off a new-born infant; and, \nbefore he had unwound a dozen yards, the thing was more like a badly-made \ndoor-mat than anything else.",
        "It is always the same, and the same sort of thing always goes on in \nconnection with it.  The man on the bank, who is trying to disentangle \nit, thinks all the fault lies with the man who rolled it up; and when a \nman up the river thinks a thing, he says it.",
        "“What have you been trying to do with it, make a fishing-net of it?  \nYou’ve made a nice mess you have; why couldn’t you wind it up properly, \nyou silly dummy?” he grunts from time to time as he struggles wildly with \nit, and lays it out flat on the tow-path, and runs round and round it, \ntrying to find the end.",
        "On the other hand, the man who wound it up thinks the whole cause of the \nmuddle rests with the man who is trying to unwind it.",
        "“It was all right when you took it!” he exclaims indignantly.  “Why don’t \nyou think what you are doing?  You go about things in such a slap-dash \nstyle.  You’d get a scaffolding pole entangled you would!”",
        "And they feel so angry with one another that they would like to hang each \nother with the thing.",
        "Ten minutes go by, and the first man gives a yell and goes mad, and \ndances on the rope, and tries to pull it straight by seizing hold of the \nfirst piece that comes to his hand and hauling at it.  Of course, this \nonly gets it into a tighter tangle than ever.  Then the second man climbs \nout of the boat and comes to help him, and they get in each other’s way, \nand hinder one another.  They both get hold of the same bit of line, and \npull at it in opposite directions, and wonder where it is caught.  In the \nend, they do get it clear, and then turn round and find that the boat has \ndrifted off, and is making straight for the weir.",
        "This really happened once to my own knowledge.  It was up by Boveney, one \nrather windy morning.  We were pulling down stream, and, as we came round \nthe bend, we noticed a couple of men on the bank.  They were looking at \neach other with as bewildered and helplessly miserable expression as I \nhave ever witnessed on any human countenance before or since, and they \nheld a long tow-line between them.  It was clear that something had \nhappened, so we eased up and asked them what was the matter.",
        "“Why, our boat’s gone off!” they replied in an indignant tone.  “We just \ngot out to disentangle the tow-line, and when we looked round, it was \ngone!”",
        "And they seemed hurt at what they evidently regarded as a mean and \nungrateful act on the part of the boat.",
        "We found the truant for them half a mile further down, held by some \nrushes, and we brought it back to them.  I bet they did not give that \nboat another chance for a week.",
        "I shall never forget the picture of those two men walking up and down the \nbank with a tow-line, looking for their boat.",
        "One sees a good many funny incidents up the river in connection with \ntowing.  One of the most common is the sight of a couple of towers, \nwalking briskly along, deep in an animated discussion, while the man in \nthe boat, a hundred yards behind them, is vainly shrieking to them to \nstop, and making frantic signs of distress with a scull.  Something has \ngone wrong; the rudder has come off, or the boat-hook has slipped \noverboard, or his hat has dropped into the water and is floating rapidly \ndown stream.",
        "He calls to them to stop, quite gently and politely at first.",
        "“Hi! stop a minute, will you?” he shouts cheerily.  “I’ve dropped my hat \nover-board.”",
        "Then: “Hi!  Tom – Dick! can’t you hear?” not quite so affably this time.",
        "Then: “Hi!  Confound YOU, you dunder-headed idiots!  Hi! stop!  Oh you – \n!”",
        "After that he springs up, and dances about, and roars himself red in the \nface, and curses everything he knows.  And the small boys on the bank \nstop and jeer at him, and pitch stones at him as he is pulled along past \nthem, at the rate of four miles an hour, and can’t get out.",
        "Much of this sort of trouble would be saved if those who are towing would \nkeep remembering that they are towing, and give a pretty frequent look \nround to see how their man is getting on.  It is best to let one person \ntow.  When two are doing it, they get chattering, and forget, and the \nboat itself, offering, as it does, but little resistance, is of no real \nservice in reminding them of the fact.",
        "As an example of how utterly oblivious a pair of towers can be to their \nwork, George told us, later on in the evening, when we were discussing \nthe subject after supper, of a very curious instance.",
        "He and three other men, so he said, were sculling a very heavily laden \nboat up from Maidenhead one evening, and a little above Cookham lock they \nnoticed a fellow and a girl, walking along the towpath, both deep in an \napparently interesting and absorbing conversation.  They were carrying a \nboat-hook between them, and, attached to the boat-hook was a tow-line, \nwhich trailed behind them, its end in the water.  No boat was near, no \nboat was in sight.  There must have been a boat attached to that tow-line \nat some time or other, that was certain; but what had become of it, what \nghastly fate had overtaken it, and those who had been left in it, was \nburied in mystery.  Whatever the accident may have been, however, it had \nin no way disturbed the young lady and gentleman, who were towing.  They \nhad the boat-hook and they had the line, and that seemed to be all that \nthey thought necessary to their work.",
        "George was about to call out and wake them up, but, at that moment, a \nbright idea flashed across him, and he didn’t.  He got the hitcher \ninstead, and reached over, and drew in the end of the tow-line; and they \nmade a loop in it, and put it over their mast, and then they tidied up \nthe sculls, and went and sat down in the stern, and lit their pipes.",
        "And that young man and young woman towed those four hulking chaps and a \nheavy boat up to Marlow.",
        "George said he never saw so much thoughtful sadness concentrated into one \nglance before, as when, at the lock, that young couple grasped the idea \nthat, for the last two miles, they had been towing the wrong boat.  \nGeorge fancied that, if it had not been for the restraining influence of \nthe sweet woman at his side, the young man might have given way to \nviolent language.",
        "The maiden was the first to recover from her surprise, and, when she did, \nshe clasped her hands, and said, wildly:",
        "“Oh, Henry, then WHERE is auntie?”",
        "“Did they ever recover the old lady?” asked Harris.",
        "George replied he did not know.",
        "Another example of the dangerous want of sympathy between tower and towed \nwas witnessed by George and myself once up near Walton.  It was where the \ntow-path shelves gently down into the water, and we were camping on the \nopposite bank, noticing things in general.  By-and-by a small boat came \nin sight, towed through the water at a tremendous pace by a powerful \nbarge horse, on which sat a very small boy.  Scattered about the boat, in \ndreamy and reposeful attitudes, lay five fellows, the man who was \nsteering having a particularly restful appearance.",
        "“I should like to see him pull the wrong line,” murmured George, as they \npassed.  And at that precise moment the man did it, and the boat rushed \nup the bank with a noise like the ripping up of forty thousand linen \nsheets.  Two men, a hamper, and three oars immediately left the boat on \nthe larboard side, and reclined on the bank, and one and a half moments \nafterwards, two other men disembarked from the starboard, and sat down \namong boat-hooks and sails and carpet-bags and bottles.  The last man \nwent on twenty yards further, and then got out on his head.",
        "This seemed to sort of lighten the boat, and it went on much easier, the \nsmall boy shouting at the top of his voice, and urging his steed into a \ngallop.  The fellows sat up and stared at one another.  It was some \nseconds before they realised what had happened to them, but, when they \ndid, they began to shout lustily for the boy to stop.  He, however, was \ntoo much occupied with the horse to hear them, and we watched them, \nflying after him, until the distance hid them from view.",
        "I cannot say I was sorry at their mishap.  Indeed, I only wish that all \nthe young fools who have their boats towed in this fashion – and plenty \ndo – could meet with similar misfortunes.  Besides the risk they run \nthemselves, they become a danger and an annoyance to every other boat \nthey pass.  Going at the pace they do, it is impossible for them to get \nout of anybody else’s way, or for anybody else to get out of theirs.  \nTheir line gets hitched across your mast, and overturns you, or it \ncatches somebody in the boat, and either throws them into the water, or \ncuts their face open.  The best plan is to stand your ground, and be \nprepared to keep them off with the butt-end of a mast.",
        "Of all experiences in connection with towing, the most exciting is being \ntowed by girls.  It is a sensation that nobody ought to miss.  It takes \nthree girls to tow always; two hold the rope, and the other one runs \nround and round, and giggles.  They generally begin by getting themselves \ntied up.  They get the line round their legs, and have to sit down on the \npath and undo each other, and then they twist it round their necks, and \nare nearly strangled.  They fix it straight, however, at last, and start \noff at a run, pulling the boat along at quite a dangerous pace.  At the \nend of a hundred yards they are naturally breathless, and suddenly stop, \nand all sit down on the grass and laugh, and your boat drifts out to mid-\nstream and turns round, before you know what has happened, or can get \nhold of a scull.  Then they stand up, and are surprised.",
        "“Oh, look!” they say; “he’s gone right out into the middle.”",
        "They pull on pretty steadily for a bit, after this, and then it all at \nonce occurs to one of them that she will pin up her frock, and they ease \nup for the purpose, and the boat runs aground.",
        "You jump up, and push it off, and you shout to them not to stop.",
        "“Yes.  What’s the matter?” they shout back.",
        "“Don’t stop,” you roar.",
        "“Don’t what?”",
        "“Don’t stop – go on – go on!”",
        "“Go back, Emily, and see what it is they want,” says one; and Emily comes \nback, and asks what it is.",
        "“What do you want?” she says; “anything happened?”",
        "” No,” you reply, “it’s all right; only go on, you know – don’t stop.”",
        "“Why not?”",
        "“Why, we can’t steer, if you keep stopping.  You must keep some way on \nthe boat.”",
        "“Keep some what?”",
        "“Some way – you must keep the boat moving.”",
        "“Oh, all right, I’ll tell `em.  Are we doing it all right?”",
        "“Oh, yes, very nicely, indeed, only don’t stop.”",
        "“It doesn’t seem difficult at all.  I thought it was so hard.”",
        "“Oh, no, it’s simple enough.  You want to keep on steady at it, that’s \nall.”",
        "“I see.  Give me out my red shawl, it’s under the cushion.”",
        "You find the shawl, and hand it out, and by this time another one has \ncome back and thinks she will have hers too, and they take Mary’s on \nchance, and Mary does not want it, so they bring it back and have a \npocket-comb instead.  It is about twenty minutes before they get off \nagain, and, at the next corner, they see a cow, and you have to leave the \nboat to chivy the cow out of their way.",
        "There is never a dull moment in the boat while girls are towing it.",
        "George got the line right after a while, and towed us steadily on to \nPenton Hook.  There we discussed the important question of camping.  We \nhad decided to sleep on board that night, and we had either to lay up \njust about there, or go on past Staines.  It seemed early to think about \nshutting up then, however, with the sun still in the heavens, and we \nsettled to push straight on for Runnymead, three and a half miles \nfurther, a quiet wooded part of the river, and where there is good \nshelter.",
        "We all wished, however, afterward that we had stopped at Penton Hook.  \nThree or four miles up stream is a trifle, early in the morning, but it \nis a weary pull at the end of a long day.  You take no interest in the \nscenery during these last few miles.  You do not chat and laugh.  Every \nhalf-mile you cover seems like two.  You can hardly believe you are only \nwhere you are, and you are convinced that the map must be wrong; and, \nwhen you have trudged along for what seems to you at least ten miles, and \nstill the lock is not in sight, you begin to seriously fear that somebody \nmust have sneaked it, and run off with it.",
        "I remember being terribly upset once up the river (in a figurative sense, \nI mean).  I was out with a young lady – cousin on my mother’s side – and \nwe were pulling down to Goring.  It was rather late, and we were anxious \nto get in – at least SHE was anxious to get in.  It was half-past six \nwhen we reached Benson’s lock, and dusk was drawing on, and she began to \nget excited then.  She said she must be in to supper.  I said it was a \nthing I felt I wanted to be in at, too; and I drew out a map I had with \nme to see exactly how far it was.  I saw it was just a mile and a half to \nthe next lock – Wallingford – and five on from there to Cleeve.",
        "“Oh, it’s all right!” I said.  “We’ll be through the next lock before \nseven, and then there is only one more;” and I settled down and pulled \nsteadily away.",
        "We passed the bridge, and soon after that I asked if she saw the lock.  \nShe said no, she did not see any lock; and I said, “Oh!” and pulled on.  \nAnother five minutes went by, and then I asked her to look again.",
        "“No,” she said; “I can’t see any signs of a lock.”",
        "“You – you are sure you know a lock, when you do see one?” I asked \nhesitatingly, not wishing to offend her.",
        "The question did offend her, however, and she suggested that I had better \nlook for myself; so I laid down the sculls, and took a view.  The river \nstretched out straight before us in the twilight for about a mile; not a \nghost of a lock was to be seen.",
        "“You don’t think we have lost our way, do you?” asked my companion.",
        "I did not see how that was possible; though, as I suggested, we might \nhave somehow got into the weir stream, and be making for the falls.",
        "This idea did not comfort her in the least, and she began to cry.  She \nsaid we should both be drowned, and that it was a judgment on her for \ncoming out with me.",
        "It seemed an excessive punishment, I thought; but my cousin thought not, \nand hoped it would all soon be over.",
        "I tried to reassure her, and to make light of the whole affair.  I said \nthat the fact evidently was that I was not rowing as fast as I fancied I \nwas, but that we should soon reach the lock now; and I pulled on for \nanother mile.",
        "Then I began to get nervous myself.  I looked again at the map.  There \nwas Wallingford lock, clearly marked, a mile and a half below Benson’s.  \nIt was a good, reliable map; and, besides, I recollected the lock myself.  \nI had been through it twice.  Where were we?  What had happened to us?  I \nbegan to think it must be all a dream, and that I was really asleep in \nbed, and should wake up in a minute, and be told it was past ten.",
        "I asked my cousin if she thought it could be a dream, and she replied \nthat she was just about to ask me the same question; and then we both \nwondered if we were both asleep, and if so, who was the real one that was \ndreaming, and who was the one that was only a dream; it got quite \ninteresting.",
        "I still went on pulling, however, and still no lock came in sight, and \nthe river grew more and more gloomy and mysterious under the gathering \nshadows of night, and things seemed to be getting weird and uncanny.  I \nthought of hobgoblins and banshees, and will-o’-the-wisps, and those \nwicked girls who sit up all night on rocks, and lure people into whirl-\npools and things; and I wished I had been a better man, and knew more \nhymns; and in the middle of these reflections I heard the blessed strains \nof “He’s got `em on,” played, badly, on a concertina, and knew that we \nwere saved.",
        "I do not admire the tones of a concertina, as a rule; but, oh! how \nbeautiful the music seemed to us both then – far, far more beautiful than \nthe voice of Orpheus or the lute of Apollo, or anything of that sort \ncould have sounded.  Heavenly melody, in our then state of mind, would \nonly have still further harrowed us.  A soul-moving harmony, correctly \nperformed, we should have taken as a spirit-warning, and have given up \nall hope.  But about the strains of “He’s got `em on,” jerked \nspasmodically, and with involuntary variations, out of a wheezy \naccordion, there was something singularly human and reassuring.",
        "The sweet sounds drew nearer, and soon the boat from which they were \nworked lay alongside us.",
        "It contained a party of provincial `Arrys and `Arriets, out for a \nmoonlight sail.  (There was not any moon, but that was not their fault.)  \nI never saw more attractive, lovable people in all my life.  I hailed \nthem, and asked if they could tell me the way to Wallingford lock; and I \nexplained that I had been looking for it for the last two hours.",
        "“Wallingford lock!” they answered.  “Lor’ love you, sir, that’s been done \naway with for over a year.  There ain’t no Wallingford lock now, sir.  \nYou’re close to Cleeve now.  Blow me tight if `ere ain’t a gentleman been \nlooking for Wallingford lock, Bill!”",
        "I had never thought of that.  I wanted to fall upon all their necks and \nbless them; but the stream was running too strong just there to allow of \nthis, so I had to content myself with mere cold-sounding words of \ngratitude.",
        "We thanked them over and over again, and we said it was a lovely night, \nand we wished them a pleasant trip, and, I think, I invited them all to \ncome and spend a week with me, and my cousin said her mother would be so \npleased to see them.  And we sang the soldiers’ chorus out of FAUST, and \ngot home in time for supper, after all.",
