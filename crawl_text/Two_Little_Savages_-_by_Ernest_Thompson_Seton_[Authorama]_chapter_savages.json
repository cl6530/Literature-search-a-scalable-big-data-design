        "Glenyan & Yan",
        "Glimmerings",
        "Because I have known the torment of thirst I would\ndig a well where others may drink.",
        "Yan was much like other twelve-year-old boys in having a keen interest\nin Indians and in wild life, but he differed from most in this, that\nhe never got over it. Indeed, as he grew older, he found a yet keener\npleasure in storing up the little bits of woodcraft and Indian lore\nthat pleased him as a boy.",
        "His father was in poor circumstances. He was an upright man of refined\ntastes, but indolent–a failure in business, easy with the world and\nstern with his family. He had never taken an interest in his son’s\nwildwood pursuits; and when he got the idea that they might interfere\nwith the boy’s education, he forbade them altogether.",
        "There was certainly no reason to accuse Yan of neglecting school. He\nwas the head boy of his class, although there were many in it older\nthan himself. He was fond of books in general, but those that dealt\nwith Natural Science and Indian craft were very close to his heart.\nNot that he had many–there were very few in those days, and the\nPublic Library had but a poor representation of these. “Lloyd’s\nScandinavian Sports,” “Gray’s Botany” and one or two Fenimore Cooper\nnovels, these were all, and Yan was devoted to them. He was a timid,\nobedient boy in most things, but the unwise command to give up what\nwas his nature merely made him a disobedient boy–turned a good boy\ninto a bad one. He was too much in terror of his father to disobey\nopenly, but he used to sneak away at all opportunities to the fields\nand woods, and at each new bird or plant he found he had an exquisite\nthrill of mingled pleasure and pain–the pain because he had no name\nfor it or means of learning its nature.",
        "The intense interest in animals was his master passion, and thanks to\nthis, his course to and from school was a very crooked one, involving\nmany crossings of the street, because thereby he could pass first a\nsaloon in whose window was a champagne advertising chromo that\nportrayed two Terriers chasing a Rat; next, directly opposite this,\nwas a tobacconist’s, in the window of which was a beautiful effigy of\nan Elephant, laden with tobacco. By going a little farther out of his\nway, there was a game store where he might see some Ducks, and was\nsure, at least, of a stuffed Deer’s head; and beyond that was a\nfurrier shop, with an astonishing stuffed Bear. At another point he\ncould see a livery stable Dog that was said to have killed a Coon, and\nat yet another place on Jervie Street was a cottage with a high\nveranda, under which, he was told, a chained Bear had once been kept.\nHe never saw the Bear. It had been gone for years, but he found\npleasure in passing the place. At the corner of Pemberton and Grand\nstreets, according to a schoolboy tradition, a Skunk had been killed\nyears ago and could still be smelled on damp nights. He always\nstopped, if passing near on a wet night, and sniffed and enjoyed that\nSkunk smell. The fact that it ultimately turned out to be a leakage of\nsewer gas could never rob him of the pleasure he originally found in\nit.",
        "[Illustration: “Gazing spellbound in that window\"]",
        "Yan had no good excuse for these weaknesses, and he blushed for shame\nwhen his elder brother talked “common sense” to him about his follies.\nHe only knew that such things fascinated him.",
        "But the crowning glory was a taxidermist’s shop kept on Main Street by\na man named Sander. Yan spent, all told, many weeks gazing spellbound,\nwith his nose flat white against that window. It contained some Fox\nand Cat heads grinning ferociously, and about fifty birds beautifully\ndisplayed. Nature might have got some valuable hints in that window\non showing plumage to the very best advantage. Each bird seemed more\nwonderful than the last.",
        "There were perhaps fifty of them on view, and of these, twelve had\nlabels, as they had formed part of an exhibit at the Annual County\nFair. These labels were precious truths to him, and the birds:",
        "Osprey                    Partridge or Ruffed Grouse\nKingfisher                Bittern\nBluejay                   Highholder\nRosebreasted Grosbeak     Sawwhet Owl\nWoodthrush                Oriole\nScarlet Tanager           * * * * * * *",
        "were, with their names, deeply impressed on his memory and added to\nhis woodlore, though not altogether without a mixture of error. For\nthe alleged Woodthrush was not a Woodthrush at all, but turned out\nto be a Hermit Thrush. The last bird of the list was a long-tailed,\nbrownish bird with white breast. The label was placed so that Yan\ncould not read it from outside, and one of his daily occupations was\nto see if the label had been turned so that he could read it. But it\nnever was, so he never learned the bird’s name.",
        "After passing this for a year or more, he formed a desperate plan. It\nwas nothing less than to go inside. It took him some months to\nscrew up courage, for he was shy and timid, but oh! he was so hungry\nfor it. Most likely if he had gone in openly and asked leave, he\nwould have been allowed to see everything; but he dared not. His home\ntraining was all of the crushing kind. He picked on the most curious\nof the small birds in the window–a Sawwhet Owl then grit his teeth\nand walked in. How frightfully the cowbell on the door did clang! Then\nthere succeeded a still more appalling silence, then a step and the\ngreat man himself came.",
        "“How–how–how much is that Owl?”",
        "“Two dollars.”",
        "Yan’s courage broke down now. He fled. If he had been told ten cents,\nit would have been utterly beyond reach. He scarcely heard what the\nman said. He hurried out with a vague feeling that he had been in\nheaven but was not good enough to stay there. He saw nothing of the\nwonderful things around him.",
        "Spring",
        "Yan, though not strong, revelled in deeds of brawn. He would rather\nhave been Samson than Moses–Hercules than Apollo. All his tastes\ninclined him to wild life. Each year when the spring came, he felt the\ninborn impulse to up and away. He was stirred through and through when\nthe first Crow, in early March, came barking over-head. But it fairly\nboiled in his blood when the Wild Geese, in long, double, arrow-headed\nprocession, went clanging northward. He longed to go with them.\nWhenever a new bird or beast appeared, he had a singular prickling\nfeeling up his spine and his back as though he had a mane that was\nstanding up. This feeling strengthened with his strength.",
        "All of his schoolmates used to say that they “liked” the spring, some\nof the girls would even say that they “dearly loved” the spring, but\nthey could not understand the madness that blazed in Yan’s eyes when\nspringtime really came–the flush of cheek–the shortening breath–the\nrestless craving for action–the chafing with flashes of rebellion at\nschool restraints–the overflow of nervous energy–the bloodthirst\nin his blood–the hankering to run–to run to the north, when the\nspringtime tokens bugled to his every sense.",
        "Then the wind and sky and ground were full of thrill. There was\nclamour everywhere, but never a word. There was stirring within and\nwithout. There was incentive in the yelping of the Wild Geese; but it\nwas only tumult, for he could not understand why he was so stirred.\nThere were voices that he could not hear–messages that he could not\nread; all was confusion of tongues. He longed only to get away.",
        "“If only I could get away. If–if–Oh, God!” he stammered in torment\nof inexpression, and then would gasp and fling himself down on some\nbank, and bite the twigs that chanced within reach and tremble and\nwonder at himself.",
        "Only one thing kept him from some mad and suicidal move–from joining\nsome roving Indian band up north, or gypsies nearer–and that was the\nstrong hand at home.",
        "His Adjoining Brothers",
        "Yan had many brothers, but only those next him in age were important\nin his life. Rad was two years older–a strong boy, who prided himself\non his “common sense.” Though so much older, he was Yan’s inferior\nat school. He resented this, and delighted in showing his muscular\nsuperiority at all opportunities. He was inclined to be religious,\nand was strictly proper in his life and speech. He never was known to\nsmoke a cigarette, tell a lie, or say “gosh” or “darn.” He was plucky\nand persevering, but he was cold and hard, without a human fiber or a\ndrop of red blood in his make-up. Even as a boy he bragged that he had\nno enthusiasms, that he believed in common sense, that he called a\nspade a spade, and would not use two words where one would do. His\nintelligence was above the average, but he was so anxious to be\nthought a person of rare sagacity and smartness, unswayed by emotion,\nthat nothing was too heartless for him to do if it seemed in line\nwith his assumed character. He was not especially selfish, and yet he\npretended to be so, simply that people should say of him significantly\nand admiringly: “Isn’t he keen? Doesn’t he know how to take care of\nhimself?” What little human warmth there was in him died early, and he\nsucceeded only in making himself increasingly detested as he grew up.",
        "His relations to Yan may be seen in one incident.",
        "Yan had been crawling about under the house in the low wide cobwebby\nspace between the floor beams and the ground. The delightful sensation\nof being on an exploring expedition led him farther (and ultimately to\na paternal thrashing for soiling his clothes), till he discovered a\nhollow place near one side, where he could nearly stand upright. He\nat once formed one of his schemes–to make a secret, or at least a\nprivate, workroom here. He knew that if he were to ask permission\nhe would be refused, but if he and Rad together were to go it might\nreceive favourable consideration on account of Rad’s self-asserted\nreputation for common sense. For a wonder, Rad was impressed with the\nscheme, but was quite sure that they had “better not go together to\nask Father.” He “could manage that part better alone,” and he did.",
        "Then they set to work. The first thing was to deepen the hole from\nthree feet to six feet everywhere, and get rid of the earth by working\nit back under the floor of the house. There were many days of labour\nin this, and Yan stuck to it each day after returning from school.\nThere were always numerous reasons why Rad could not share in the\nlabour. When the ten by fourteen-foot hole was made, boards to line\nand floor it were needed. Lumber was very cheap–inferior, second-hand\nstuff was to be had for the asking–and Yan found and carried boards\nenough to make the workroom. Rad was an able carpenter and now took\ncharge of the construction. They worked together evening after\nevening, Yan discussing all manner of plans with warmth and\nenthusiasm–what they would do in their workshop when finished–how\nthey might get a jig-saw in time and saw picture frames, so as to\nmake some money. Rad assented with grunts or an occasional Scripture\ntext–that was his way. Each day he told Yan what to go on with while\nhe was absent.",
        "The walls were finished at length; a window placed in one side; a door\nmade and fitted with lock and key. What joy! Yan glowed with pleasure\nand pride at the triumphant completion of his scheme. He swept up the\nfloor for the finishing ceremony and sat down on the bench for a grand\ngloat, when Rad said abruptly:",
        "“Going to lock up now.” That sounded gratifyingly important. Yan\nstepped outside. Rad locked the door, put the key in his pocket, then\nturning, he said with cold, brutal emphasis:",
        "“Now you keep out of my workshop from this on. You have nothing\nto do with it. It’s mine. I got the permission to make it.” All of\nwhich he could prove, and did.",
        "Alner, the youngest, was eighteen months younger than Yan, and about\nthe same size, but the resemblance stopped there. His chief aim in\nlife was to be stylish. He once startled his mother by inserting into\nhis childish prayers the perfectly sincere request: “Please, God,\nmake me an awful swell, for Jesus sake.” Vanity was his foible, and\nlaziness his sin.",
        "He could be flattered into anything that did not involve effort. He\nfairly ached to be famous. He was consuming with desire to be pointed\nout for admiration as the great this, that or the other thing–it did\nnot matter to him what, as long as he could be pointed out. But he\nnever had the least idea of working for it. At school he was a sad\ndunce. He was three grades below Yan and at the bottom of his grade.\nThey set out for school each day together, because that was a paternal\nruling; but they rarely reached there together. They had nothing in\ncommon. Yan was full of warmth, enthusiasm, earnestness and energy,\nbut had a most passionate and ungovernable temper. Little put him in a\nrage, but it was soon over, and then an equally violent reaction set\nin, and he was always anxious to beg forgiveness and make friends\nagain. Alner was of lazy good temper and had a large sense of humour.\nHis interests were wholly in the playground. He had no sympathy with\nYan’s Indian tastes–\"Indians in nasty, shabby clothes. Bah! Horrid!\"\nhe would scornfully say.",
        "These, then, were his adjoining brothers.",
        "What wonder that Yan was daily further from them.",
        "The Book",
        "But the greatest event of Yan’s then early life now took place. His\nschool readers told him about Wilson and Audubon, the first and last\nAmerican naturalists. Yan wondered why no other great prophet had\narisen. But one day the papers announced that at length he had\nappeared. A work on the Birds of Canada, by ..., had come at last,\nprice one dollar.",
        "Money never before seemed so precious, necessary and noble a thing.\n\"Oh! if I only had a dollar.” He set to work to save and scrape. He\nwon marbles in game, swopped marbles for tops, tops for jack-knives as\nthe various games came around with strange and rigid periodicity. The\njack-knives in turn were converted into rabbits, the rabbits into cash\nof small denominations. He carried wood for strange householders;\nhe scraped and scraped and saved the scrapings; and got, after some\nmonths, as high as ninety cents. But there was a dread fatality\nabout that last dime. No one seemed to have any more odd jobs; his\ncommercial luck deserted him. He was burnt up with craving for that\nbook. None of his people took interest enough in him to advance the\ncash even at the ruinous interest (two or three times cent per cent)\nthat he was willing to bind himself for. Six weeks passed before he\nachieved that last dime, and he never felt conscience-clear about it\nafterward.",
        "He and Alner had to cut the kitchen wood. Each had his daily\nallotment, as well as other chores. Yan’s was always done faithfully,\nbut the other evaded his work in every way. He was a notorious little\nfop. The paternal poverty did not permit his toilet extravagance to\nsoar above one paper collar per week, but in his pocket he carried a\npiece of ink eraser with which he was careful to keep the paper collar\nup to standard. Yan cared nothing about dress–indeed, was inclined to\nbe slovenly. So the eldest brother, meaning to turn Alner’s weakness\nto account, offered a prize of a twenty-five-cent necktie of the\nwinner’s own choice to the one who did his chores best for a month.\nFor the first week Alner and Yan kept even, then Alner wearied, in\nspite of the dazzling prize. The pace was too hot. Yan kept on his\nusual way and was duly awarded the twenty-five cents to be spent on a\nnecktie. But in the store a bright thought came tempting him. Fifteen\ncents was as much as any one should spend on a necktie–that’s sure;\nthe other ten would get the book. And thus the last dime was added to\nthe pile. Then, bursting with joy and with the pride of a capitalist,\nhe went to the book-shop and asked for the coveted volume.",
        "He was tense with long-pent feeling. He expected to have the\nbookseller say that the price had gone up to one thousand dollars, and\nthat all were sold. But he did not. He turned silently, drew the book\nout of a pile of them, hesitated and said, “Green or red cover?”",
        "“Green,” said Yan, not yet believing. The book-man looked inside, then\nlaid it down, saying in a cold, business tone, “Ninety cents.”",
        "“Ninety cents,” gasped Yan. Oh! if only he had known the ways of\nbooksellers or the workings of cash discounts. For six weeks had\nhe been barred this happy land–had suffered starvation; he had\nmisappropriated funds, he had fractured his conscience and all to\nraise that ten cents–that unnecessary dime.",
        "He read that book reverentially all the way home. It did not give him\nwhat he wanted, but that doubtless was his own fault. He pored over\nit, studied it, loved it, never doubting that now he had the key to\nall the wonders and mysteries of Nature. It was five years before\nhe fully found out that the text was the most worthless trash ever\nfoisted on a torpid public. Nevertheless, the book held some useful\nthings; first, a list of the bird names; second, some thirty vile\ntravesties of Audubon and Wilson’s bird portraits.",
        "These were the birds thus maligned:",
        "Duck Hawk                     Rose-breasted Grosbeak\nSparrow Hawk                  Bobolink\nWhite-headed Eagle            Meadow Lark\nGreat Horned Owl              Bluejay\nSnowy Owl                     Ruffed Grouse\nRed-headed Woodpecker         Great Blue Heron\nGolden-winged Woodpecker      Bittern\nBarn-swallow                  Wilson’s Snipe\nWhip-poor-will                Long-biller Curlew\nNight Hawk                    Purple Gallinule\nBelted Kingfisher             Canada Goose\nKingbird                      Wood Duck\nWoodthrush                    Hooded Merganser\nCatbird                       Double-crested Cormorant\nWhite-bellied Nuthatch        Arctic Tern\nBrown Creeper                 Great Northern Diver\nBohemian Chatterer            Stormy Petrel\nGreat Northern Shrike         Arctic Puffin\nShore Lark                    Black Guillemot",
        "[Illustration: “He already knew the Downy Woodpecker\"]",
        "But badly as they were presented, the pictures were yet information,\nand were entered in his memory as lasting accessions to his store of\ntruth about the Wild Things.",
        "Of course, he already knew some few birds whose names are familiar\nto every schoolboy: the Robin, Bluebird, Kingbird, Wild Canary,\nWoodpecker, Barn-swallow, Wren, Chickadee, Wild Pigeon, Humming-bird,\nPewee, so that his list was steadily increased.",
        "The Collarless Stranger",
        "  Oh, sympathy! the noblest gift of God to man.\n  The greatest bond there is twixt man and man.\n  The strongest link in any friendship chain.\n  The single lasting hold in kinship’s claim.\n  The only incorrosive strand in marriage bonds.\n  The blazing torch where genius lights her lamp.\n  The ten times noble base of noblest love.\n  More deep than love–more strong than hate–the biggest thing\n  in all the universe–the law of laws.\n  Grant but this greatest gift of God to man–this single link\n  concatenating grant, and all the rest are worthless or comprised.",
        "Each year the ancient springtime madness came more strongly on Yan.\nEach year he was less inclined to resist it, and one glorious day of\nlate April in its twelfth return he had wandered northward along to a\nlittle wood a couple of miles from the town. It was full of unnamed\nflowers and voices and mysteries. Every tree and thicket had a\nvoice–a long ditch full of water had many that called to him.\n\"_Peep-peep-peep,” they seemed to say in invitation for him to\ncome and see. He crawled again and again to the ditch and watched\nand waited. The loud whistle would sound only a few rods away,\n\"_Peep-peep-peep,” but ceased at each spot when he came\nnear–sometimes before him, sometimes behind, but never where he was.\nHe searched through a small pool with his hands, sifted out sticks and\nleaves, but found nothing else. A farmer going by told him it was only\na “spring Peeper,” whatever that was, “some kind of a critter in the\nwater.”",
        "Under a log not far away Yan found a little Lizard that tumbled out of\nsight into a hole. It was the only living thing there, so he decided\nthat the “Peeper” must be a “Whistling Lizard.” But he was determined\nto see them when they were calling. How was it that the ponds all\naround should be full of them calling to him and playing hide and seek\nand yet defying his most careful search? The voices ceased as soon as\nhe came near, to be gradually renewed in the pools he had left. His\npresence was a husher. He lay for a long time watching a pool, but\nnone of the voices began again in range of his eye. At length, after\nrealizing that they were avoiding him, he crawled to a very noisy pond\nwithout showing himself, and nearer and yet nearer until he was within\nthree feet of a loud peeper in the floating grass. He located the spot\nwithin a few inches and yet could see nothing. He was utterly baffled,\nand lay there puzzling over it, when suddenly all the near Peepers\nstopped, and Yan was startled by a footfall; and looking around, he\nsaw a man within a few feet, watching him.",
        "Yan reddened–a stranger was always an enemy; he had a natural\naversion to all such, and stared awkwardly as though caught in crime.",
        "The man, a curious looking middle-aged person, was in shabby clothes\nand wore no collar. He had a tin box strapped on his bent shoulders,\nand in his hands was a long-handled net. His features, smothered in a\ngrizzly beard, were very prominent and rugged. They gave evidence of\nintellectual force, with some severity, but his gray-blue eyes had a\nkindly look.",
        "He had on a common, unbecoming, hard felt hat, and when he raised it\nto admit the pleasant breeze Yan saw that the wearer had hair like his\nown–a coarse, paleolithic mane, piled on his rugged brow, like a mass\nof seaweed lodged on some storm-beaten rock.",
        "“F’what are ye fynding, my lad?” said he in tones whose gentleness was\nin no way obscured by a strong Scottish tang.",
        "Still resenting somewhat the stranger’s presence, Yan said:",
        "“I’m not finding anything; I am only trying to see what that Whistling\nLizard is like.”",
        "The stranger’s eyes twinkled. “Forty years ago Ah was laying by a pool\njust as Ah seen ye this morning, looking and trying hard to read the\nriddle of the spring Peeper. Ah lay there all day, aye, and mony\nanither day, yes, it was nigh onto three years before Ah found it oot.\nAh’ll be glad to save ye seeking as long as Ah did, if that’s yer\nmind. Ah’ll show ye the Peeper.”",
        "Then he raked carefully among the leaves near the ditch, and soon\ncaptured a tiny Frog, less than an inch long.",
        "“Ther’s your Whistling Lizard: he no a Lizard at all, but a Froggie.\nBook men call him Hyla pickeringii, an’ a gude Scotchman he’d\nmake, for ye see the St. Andrew’s cross on his wee back. Ye see the\nwhistling ones in the water put on’y their beaks oot an’ is hard to\nsee. Then they sinks to the bottom when ye come near. But you tak\nthis’n home and treat him well and ye’ll see him blow out his throat\nas big as himsel’ an’ whistle like a steam engine.”",
        "Yan thawed out now. He told about the Lizard he had seen.",
        "“That wasna a Lizard; Ah niver see thim aboot here. It must a been\na two-striped Spelerpes. A Spelerpes is nigh kin to a\nFrog–a kind of dry-land tadpole, while a Lizard is only a Snake with\nlegs.”",
        "This was light from heaven. All Yan’s distrust was gone. He warmed to\nthe stranger. He plied him with questions; he told of his getting the\nBird Book. Oh, how the stranger did snort at “that driveling trash.\"\nYan talked of his perplexities. He got a full hearing and intelligent\nanswers. His mystery of the black ground-bird with a brown mate was\nresolved into the Common Towhee. The unknown wonderful voice in the\nspring morning, sending out its ’cluck, cluck, cluck, clucker,\"\nin the distant woods, the large gray Woodpecker that bored in some\nhigh stub and flew in a blaze of gold, and the wonderful spotted bird\nwith red head and yellow wings and tail in the taxidermist’s window,\nwere all resolved into one and the same–the Flicker or Golden-winged\nWoodpecker. The Hang-nest and the Oriole became one. The unknown\npoisonous-looking blue Hornet, that sat on the mud with palpitating\nbody, and the strange, invisible thing that made the mud-nests inside\nold outbuildings and crammed them with crippled Spiders, were both\nidentified as the Mud-wasp or Pelopæus.",
        "A black Butterfly flew over, and Yan learned that it was a Camberwell\nBeauty, or, scientifically, a Vanessa antiopa, and that this\none must have hibernated to be seen so early in the spring, and yet\nmore, that this beautiful creature was the glorified spirit of the\ncommon brown and black spiney Caterpillar.",
        "The Wild Pigeons were flying high above them in great flocks as they\nsat there, and Yan learned of their great nesting places in the far\nSouth, and of their wonderful but exact migrations without regard to\nanything but food; their northward migration to gather the winged nuts\nof the Slippery Elm in Canada; their August flight to the rice-fields\nof Carolina; their Mississippi Valley pilgrimage when the acorns and\nbeech-mast were falling ripe.",
        "What a rich, full morning that was. Everything seemed to turn up for\nthem. As they walked over a piney hill, two large birds sprang from\nthe ground and whirred through the trees.",
        "“Ruffed Grouse or ’patridge’, as the farmers call them. There’s a pair\nlives nigh aboots here. They come on this bank for the Wintergreen\nberries.”",
        "And Yan was quick to pull and taste them. He filled his pockets with\nthe aromatic plant–berries and all–and chewed it as he went. While\nthey walked, a faint, far drum-thump fell on their ears. “What’s\nthat?” he exclaimed, ever on the alert. The stranger listened and\nsaid:",
        "“That’s the bird ye ha’ just seen; that’s the Cock Partridge drumming\nfor his mate.”",
        "The Pewee of his early memories became the Phoebe of books. That day\nhis brookside singer became the Song-sparrow; the brown triller, the\nVeery Thrush. The Trilliums, white and red, the Dogtooth Violet, the\nSpring-beauty, the Trailing Arbutus–all for the first time got\nnames and became real friends, instead of elusive and beautiful, but\ndepressing mysteries.",
        "The stranger warmed, too, and his rugged features glowed; he saw in\nYan one minded like himself, tormented with the knowledge-hunger, as\nin youth he himself had been; and now it was a priceless privilege to\nsave the boy some of what he had suffered. His gratitude to Yan grew\nfervid, and Yan–he took in every word; nothing that he heard was\nforgotten. He was in a dream, for he had found at last the greatest\nthing on earth–sympathy–broad, intelligent, comprehensive sympathy.",
        "That spring morning was ever after like a new epoch in Yan’s mind–not\nhis memory, that was a thing of the past–but in his mind, his living\npresent.",
        "And the strongest, realest thing in it all was, not the rugged\nstranger with his kind ways, not the new birds and plants, but the\nsmell of the Wintergreen.",
        "Smell’s appeal to the memory is far better, stronger, more real than\nthat of any other sense. The Indians know this; many of them, in time,\nfind out the smell that conjures up their happiest hours, and keep it\nby them in the medicine bag. It is very real and dear to them–that\nhandful of Pine needles, that lump of Rat-musk, or that piece of\nSpruce gum. It adds the crown of happy memory to their reveries.",
        "And yet this belief is one of the first attacked by silly White-men,\nwho profess to enlighten the Red-man’s darkness. They, in their\nignorance, denounce it as absurd, while men of science know its simple\ntruth.",
        "Yan did not know that he had stumbled on a secret of the Indian\nmedicine bag. But ever afterward that wonderful day was called back to\nhim, conjured up by his “medicine,” this simple, natural magic, the\nsmell of the Wintergreen.",
        "He appreciated that morning more than he could tell, and yet he did a\ncharacteristic foolish thing, that put him in a wrong light and left\nhim so in the stranger’s mind.",
        "It was past noon. They had long lingered; the Stranger spoke of the\nmany things he had at home; then at length said he must be going.\n\"Weel, good-by, laddie; Ah hope Ah’ll see you again.” He held out his\nhand. Yan shook it warmly; but he was dazed with thinking and with\nreaction; his diffidence and timidity were strong; he never rose to\nthe stranger’s veiled offer. He let him go without even learning his\nname or address.",
        "When it was too late, Yan awoke to his blunder. He haunted all those\nwoods in hopes of chancing on him there again, but he never did.",
        "Glenyan",
        "Oh! what a song the Wild Geese sang that year! How their trumpet clang\nwent thrilling in his heart, to smite there new and hidden chords that\nstirred and sang response. Was there ever a nobler bird than that\ngreat black-necked Swan, that sings not at his death, but in his flood\nof life, a song of home and of peace–of stirring deeds and hunting\nin far-off climes–of hungerings and food, and raging thirsts to meet\nwith cooling drink. A song of wind and marching, a song of bursting\ngreen and grinding ice–of Arctic secrets and of hidden ways. A song\nof a long black marsh, a low red sky, and a sun that never sets.",
        "An Indian jailed for theft bore bravely through the winter, but when\nthe springtime brought the Gander-clang in the black night sky, he\nstarted, fell, and had gone to his last, long, hunting home.",
        "Who can tell why Jericho should fall at the trumpet blast?",
        "Who can read or measure the power of the Honker-song?",
        "Oh, what a song the Wild Geese sang that year! And yet, was it a new\nsong? No, the old, old song, but Yan heard it with new ears. He was\nlearning to read its message. He wandered on their trailless track, as\noften as he could, northward, ever northward, up the river from the\ntown, and up, seeking the loneliest ways and days. The river turned to\nthe east, but a small stream ran into it from the north: up that Yan\nwent through thickening woods and walls that neared each other, on and\nup until the walls closed to a crack, then widened out into a little\ndale that was still full of original forest trees. Hemlock, Pine,\nBirch and Elm of the largest size abounded and spread over the clear\nbrook a continuous shade. Fox vines trailed in the open places, the\nrarest wild-flowers flourished, Red-squirrels chattered from the\ntrees. In the mud along the brook-side were tracks of Coon and Mink\nand other strange fourfoots. And in the trees overhead, the Veery, the\nHermit-thrush, or even a Woodthrush sang his sweetly solemn strain, in\nthat golden twilight of the midday forest. Yan did not know them all\nby name as yet, but he felt their vague charm and mystery. It seemed\nsuch a far and lonely place, so unspoiled by man, that Yan persuaded\nhimself that surely he was the first human being to stand there, that\nit was his by right of discovery, and so he claimed it and named it\nafter its discoverer–Glenyan.",
        "This place became the central thought in his life. He went there at\nall opportunities, but never dared to tell any one of his discovery.\nHe longed for a confidant sometimes, he hankered to meet the stranger\nand take him there, and still he feared that the secret would get out.\nThis was his little kingdom; the Wild Geese had brought him here, as\nthe Seagulls had brought Columbus to a new world–where he could lead,\nfor brief spells, the woodland life that was his ideal. He was tender\nenough to weep over the downfall of a lot of fine Elm trees in town,\nwhen their field was sold for building purposes, and he used to suffer\na sort of hungry regret when old settlers told how plentiful the Deer\nused to be. But now he had a relief from these sorrows, for surely\nthere was one place where the great trees should stand and grow as in\nthe bright bygone; where the Coon, the Mink and the Partridge should\nlive and flourish forever. No, indeed, no one else should know of it,\nfor if the secret got out, at least hosts of visitors would come and\nGlenyan be defiled. No, better that the secret should “die with him,\"\nhe said. What that meant he did not really know, but he had read the\nphrase somewhere and he liked the sound of it. Possibly he would\nreveal it on his deathbed.",
        "Yes, that was the proper thing, and he pictured a harrowing scene of\nweeping relatives around, himself as central figure, all ceasing their\nwailing and gasping with wonder as he made known the mighty secret of\nhis life–delicious! it was almost worth dying for.",
        "So he kept the place to himself and loved it more and more. He would\nlook out through the thick Hemlock tops, the blots of Basswood green\nor the criss-cross Butternut leafage and say: “My own, my own.” Or\ndown by some pool in the limpid stream he would sit and watch the\narrowy Shiners and say: “You are mine, all; you are mine. You shall\nnever be harmed or driven away.”",
        "A spring came from the hillside by a green lawn, and here Yan would\neat his sandwiches varied with nuts and berries that he did not like,\nbut ate only because he was a wildman, and would look lovingly up the\nshady brookland stretches and down to the narrow entrance of the glen,\nand say and think and feel. “This is mine, my own, my very own.”",
        "The Shanty",
        "He had none but the poorest of tools, but he set about building a\nshanty. He was not a resourceful boy. His effort to win the book\nhad been an unusual one for him, as his instincts were not at all\ncommercial. When that matter came to the knowledge of the Home\nGovernment, he was rebuked for doing “work unworthy of a gentleman’s\nson” and forbidden under frightful penalties “ever again to resort to\nsuch degrading ways of raising money.”",
        "They gave him no money, so he was penniless. Most boys would have\npossessed themselves somehow of a good axe and spade. He had neither.\nAn old plane blade, fastened to a stick with nails, was all the axe\nand spade he had, yet with this he set to work and offset its poorness\nas a tool by dogged persistency. First, he selected the quietest\nspot near the spring–a bank hidden by a mass of foliage. He knew no\nspecial reason for hiding it, beyond the love of secrecy. He had\nread in some of his books “how the wily scouts led the way through a\npathless jungle, pulled aside a bough and there revealed a comfortable\ndwelling that none without the secret could possibly have discovered,\"\nso it seemed very proper to make it a complete mystery–a sort of\nsecret panel in the enchanted castle–and so picture himself as the\nwily scout leading his wondering companions to the shanty, though, of\ncourse, he had not made up his mind to reveal his secret to any one.\nHe often wished he could have the advantage of Rad’s strong arms and\nefficacious tools; but the workshop incident was only one of many that\ntaught him to leave his brother out of all calculation.",
        "Mother Earth is the best guardian of a secret, and Yan with his crude\nspade began by digging a hole in the bank. The hard blue clay made the\nwork slow, but two holidays spent in steady labour resulted in a hole\nseven feet wide and about four feet into the bank.",
        "In this he set about building the shanty. Logs seven or eight feet\nlong must be got to the place–at least twenty-five or thirty would\nbe needed, and how to cut and handle them with his poor axe was a\nquestion. Somehow, he never looked for a better axe. The half-formed\nnotion that the Indians had no better was sufficient support, and he\nstruggled away bravely, using whatever ready sized material he could\nfind. Each piece as he brought it was put into place. Some boys would\nhave gathered the logs first and built it all at once, but that\nwas not Yan’s way; he was too eager to see the walls rise. He had\npainfully and slowly gathered logs enough to raise the walls three\nrounds, when the question of a door occurred to him. This, of course,\ncould not be cut through the logs in the ordinary way; that required\nthe best of tools. So he lifted out all the front logs except the\nlowest, replacing them at the ends with stones and blocks to sustain\nthe sides. This gave him the sudden gain of two logs, and helped the\nrest of the walls that much. The shanty was now about three feet high,\nand no two logs in it were alike: some were much too long, most were\ncrooked and some were half rotten, for the simple reason that these\nwere the only ones he could cut. He had exhausted the logs in the\nneighbourhood and was forced to go farther. Now he remembered seeing\none that might do, half a mile away on the home trail (they were\nalways “trails\"; he never called them “roads” or “paths”). He went\nafter this, and to his great surprise and delight found that it was\none of a dozen old cedar posts that had been cut long before and\nthrown aside as culls, or worthless. He could carry only one at a\ntime, so that to bring each one meant a journey of a mile, and the\npost got woefully heavy each time before that mile was over. To\nget those twelve logs he had twelve miles to walk. It took several\nSaturdays, but he stuck doggedly to it. Twelve good logs completed\nhis shanty, making it five feet high and leaving three logs over for\nrafters. These he laid flat across, dividing the spaces equally. Over\nthem he laid plenty of small sticks and branches till it was thickly\ncovered. Then he went down to a rank, grassy meadow and, with his\nknife, cut hay for a couple of hours. This was spread thickly on the\nroof, to be covered with strips of Elm bark then on top of all he\nthrew the clay dug from the bank, piling it well back, stamping on it,\nand working it down at the edges. Finally, he threw rubbish and leaves\nover it, so that it was confused with the general tangle.",
        "Thus the roof was finished, but the whole of the front was open. He\ndreaded the search for more logs, so tried a new plan. He found,\nfirst, some sticks about six feet long and two or three inches\nthrough. Not having an axe to sharpen and drive them, he dug pairs of\nholes a foot deep, one at each end and another pair near the middle of\nthe front ground log.",
        "Into each of these he put a pair of upright sticks, leading up to the\neave log, one inside and one outside of it, then packed the earth\naround them in the holes. Next, he went to the brook-side and cut a\nnumber of long green willow switches about half an inch thick at the\nbutt. These switches he twisted around the top of each pair of stakes\nin a figure 8, placing them to hold the stake tight against the bottom\nand top logs at the front.",
        "Down by the spring he now dug a hole and worked water and clay\ntogether into mortar, then with a trowel cut out of a shingle, and\nmortar carried in an old bucket, he built a wall within the stakes,\nusing sticks laid along the outside and stones set in mud till the\nfront was closed up, except a small hole for a window and a large hole\nfor a door.",
        "Now he set about finishing the inside. He gathered moss in the woods\nand stuffed all the chinks in the upper parts, and those next the\nground he filled with stones and earth. Thus the shanty was finished;\nbut it lacked a door.",
        "The opening was four feet high and two feet wide, so in the woodshed\nat home he cut three boards, each eight inches wide and four feet\nhigh, but he left at each end of one a long point. Doing this at home\ngave him the advantage of a saw. Then with these and two shorter\nboards, each two feet long and six inches wide, he sneaked out to\nGlenyan, and there, with some nails and a stone for a hammer, he\nfastened them together into a door. In the ground log he pecked a hole\nbig enough to receive one of the points and made a corresponding hole\nin the under side of the top log. Then, prying up the eave log, he put\nthe door in place, let the eave log down again, and the door was hung.\nA string to it made an outside fastening when it was twisted around a\nprojecting snag in the wall, and a peg thrust into a hole within made\nan inside fastener. Some logs, with fir boughs and dried grass, formed\na bunk within. This left only the window, and for lack of better cover\nhe fastened over it a piece of muslin brought from home. But finding\nits dull white a jarring note, he gathered a quart of butternuts, and\nwatching his chance at home, he boiled the cotton in water with the\nnuts and so reduced it to a satisfactory yellowish brown.",
        "His final task was to remove all appearance of disturbance and to\nfully hide the shanty in brush and trailing vines. Thus, after weeks\nof labour, his woodland home was finished. It was only five feet high\ninside, six feet long and six feet wide–dirty and uncomfortable–but\nwhat a happiness it was to have it.",
        "Here for the first time in his life he began to realize something\nof the pleasure of single-handed achievement in the line of a great\nambition.",
        "Beginnings of Woodlore",
        "During this time Yan had so concentrated all his powers on the shanty\nthat he had scarcely noticed the birds and wild things. Such was his\ntemperament–one idea only, and that with all his strength.",
        "His heart was more and more in his kingdom now he longed to come\nand live here. But he only dared to dream that some day he might be\nallowed to pass a night in the shanty. This was where he would lead\nhis ideal life–the life of an Indian with all that is bad and cruel\nleft out. Here he would show men how to live without cutting down all\nthe trees, spoiling all the streams, and killing every living thing.\nHe would learn how to get the fullest pleasure out of the woods\nhimself and then teach others how to do the same. Though the birds and\nFourfoots fascinated him, he would not have hesitated to shoot one\nhad he been able, but to see a tree cut down always caused him\ngreat distress. Possibly he realized that the bird might be quickly\nreplaced, but the tree, never.",
        "To carry out his plan he must work hard at school, for books had\nmuch that he needed. Perhaps some day he might get a chance to see\nAudubon’s drawings, and so have all his bird worries settled by a\nsingle book.",
        "That summer a new boy at school added to Yan’s savage equipment. This\nboy was neither good nor bright; he was a dunce, and had been expelled\nfrom a boarding school for misconduct, but he had a number of\nschoolboy accomplishments that gave him a tinge of passing glory.\nHe could tie a lot of curious knots in a string. He could make a\nwonderful birdy warble, and he spoke a language that he called Tutnee.\nYan was interested in all, but especially the last. He teased and\nbribed till he was admitted to the secret. It consisted in spelling\nevery word, leaving the five vowels as they are, but doubling each\nconsonant and putting a “u” between. Thus “b” became “bub,” “d” “dud,\"\n\"m” “mum,” and so forth, except that “c” was “suk,” “h” “hash,” “x\"\n\"zux,” and “w” “wak.”",
        "The sample given by the new boy, “sus-hash-u-tut u-pup yak-o-u-rur\nmum-o-u-tut-hash,” was said to be a mode of enjoining silence.",
        "This language was “awful useful,” the new boy said, to keep the other\nfellows from knowing what you were saying, which it certainly did. Yan\npractised hard at it and within a few weeks was an adept. He could\nhandle the uncouth sentences better than his teacher, and he was\nsingularly successful in throwing in accents and guttural tones that\nimparted a delightfully savage flavour, and he rejoiced in jabbering\naway to the new boy in the presence of others so that he might bask in\nthe mystified look on the faces of those who were not skilled in the\ntongue of the Tutnees.",
        "He made himself a bow and arrows. They were badly made and he could\nhit nothing with them, but he felt so like an Indian when he drew the\narrow to its head, that it was another pleasure.",
        "He made a number of arrows with hoop-iron heads, these he could\nfile at home in the woodshed. The heads were jagged and barbed and\ndouble-barbed. These arrows were frightful-looking things. They seemed\npositively devilish in their ferocity, and were proportionately\ngratifying. These he called his “war arrows,” and would send one into\na tree and watch it shiver, then grunt “Ugh, heap good,” and rejoice\nin the squirming of the imaginary foe he had pierced.",
        "He found a piece of sheepskin and made of it a pair of very poor\nmoccasins. He ground an old castaway putty knife into a scalping\nknife; the notch in it for breaking glass was an annoying defect until\nhe remembered that some Indians decorate their weapons with a notch\nfor each enemy it has killed, and this, therefore, might do duty as a\nkill-tally. He made a sheath for the knife out of scraps of leather\nleft off the moccasins. Some water-colours, acquired by a school swap,\nand a bit of broken mirror held in a split stick, were necessary parts\nof his Indian toilet. His face during the process of make-up was\nalways a battle-ground between the horriblest Indian scowl\nand a grin of delight at his success in diabolizing his visage with\nthe paints. Then with painted face and a feather in his hair he would\nproudly range the woods in his little kingdom and store up every scrap\nof woodlore he could find, invent or learn from his schoolmates.",
        "[Illustration: Yan’s toilet]",
        "Odd things that he found in the woods he would bring to his shanty:\ncurled sticks, feathers, bones, skulls, fungus, shells, an old\ncowhorn–things that interested him, he did not know why. He made\nIndian necklaces of the shells, strung together alternately with\nthe backbone of a fish. He let his hair grow as long as possible,\nemploying various stratagems, even the unpalatable one of combing it\nto avoid the monthly trim of the maternal scissors. He lay for hours\nwith the sun beating on his face to correct his colour to standard,\nand the only semblance of personal vanity that he ever had was\npleasure in hearing disparaging remarks about the darkness of his\ncomplexion. He tried to do everything as an Indian would do it,\nstriking Indian poses, walking carefully with his toes turned in,\nbreaking off twigs to mark a place, guessing at the time by the sun,\nand grunting “Ugh” or “Wagh” when anything surprised him. Disparaging\nremarks about White-men, delivered in supposed Indian dialect, were\nan important part of his pastime. “Ugh, White-men heap no good” and\n\"Wagh, paleface–pale fool in woods,” were among his favourites.",
        "He was much influenced by phrases that caught his ear. “The brown\nsinewy arm of the Indian,” was one of them. It discovered to him that\nhis own arms were white as milk. There was, however, a simple remedy.\nHe rolled up his sleeves to the shoulder and exposed them to the full\nglare of the sun. Then later, under the spell of the familiar phrase,\n\"The warrior was naked to the waist,” he went a step further–he\ndetermined to be brown to the waist–so discarded his shirt during the\nwhole of one holiday. He always went to extremes. He remembered now\nthat certain Indians put their young warriors through an initiation\ncalled the Sun-dance, so he danced naked round the fire in the blazing\nsun and sat around naked all one day.",
        "He noticed a general warmness before evening, but it was at night that\nhe really felt the punishment of his indiscretion. He was in a burning\nheat. He scarcely slept all night. Next day he was worse, and his arm\nand shoulder were blistered. He bore it bravely, fearing only that the\nHome Government might find it out, in which case he would have fared\nworse. He had read that the Indians grease the skin for sunburn, so he\nwent to the bathroom and there used goose grease for lack of Buffalo\nfat. This did give some relief, and in a few days he was better and\nhad the satisfaction of peeling the dead skin from his shoulders and\narms.",
        "Yan made a number of vessels out of Birch bark, stitching the edges\nwith root fibers, filling the bottom with a round wooden disc, and\ncementing the joints with pine gum so that they would hold water.",
        "In the distant river he caught some Catfish and brought them\nhome–that, is, to his shanty. There he made a fire and broiled\nthem–very badly–but he ate them as a great delicacy. The sharp bone\nin each of their side fins he saved, bored a hole through its thick\nend, smoothed it, and so had needles to stitch his Birch bark. He kept\nthem in a bark box with some lumps of resin, along with some bark\nfiber, an Indian flint arrow-head given him by a schoolmate, and\nthe claws of a large Owl, found in the garbage heap back of the\ntaxidermist’s shop.",
        "One day on the ash heap in their own yard in town he saw a new,\nstrange bird. He was always seeing new birds, but this was of unusual\ninterest. He drew its picture as it tamely fed near him. A dull, ashy\ngray, with bronzy yellow spots on crown and rump, and white bars on\nits wings. His “Birds of Canada” gave no light; he searched through\nall the books he could find, but found no clew to its name. It was\nyears afterward before he learned that this was the young male Pine\nGrosbeak.",
        "Another day, under the bushes not far from his shanty, he found a\nsmall Hawk lying dead. He clutched it as a wonderful prize, spent an\nhour in looking at its toes, its beak, its wings, its every feather;\nthen he set to work to make a drawing of it. A very bad drawing it\nproved, although it was the labour of days, and the bird was crawling\nwith maggots before he had finished. But every feather and every spot\nwas faithfully copied, was duly set down on paper. One of his\nfriends said it was a Chicken-hawk. That name stuck in Yan’s memory.\nThenceforth the Chicken-hawk and its every marking were familiar to\nhim. Even in after years, when he had learned that this must have been\na young “Sharp-shin,” the name “Chicken-hawk” was always readier on\nhis lips.",
        "But he met with another and a different Hawk soon afterward. This one\nwas alive and flitting about in the branches of a tree over his head.\nIt was very small–less than a foot in length. Its beak was very\nshort, its legs, wings and tail long; its head was bluish and its back\ncoppery red; on the tail was a broad, black crossbar. As the bird flew\nabout and balanced on the boughs, it pumped its tail. This told him\nit was a Hawk, and the colours he remembered were those of the male\nSparrow-hawk, for here his bird book helped with its rude travesty of\n\"Wilson’s” drawing of this bird. Yet two other birds he saw close at\nhand and drew partly from memory. The drawings were like this, and\nfrom the picture on a calendar he learned that one was a Rail; from\na drawing in the bird book that the other was a Bobolink. And these\nnames he never forgot. He had his doubts about the sketching at\nfirst–it seemed an un-Indian thing to do, until he remembered that\nthe Indians painted pictures on their shields and on their teepees. It\nwas really the best of all ways for him to make reliable observation.",
        "The bookseller of the town had some new books in his window about this\ntime. One, a marvellous work called “Poisonous Plants,” Yan was eager\nto see. It was exposed in the window for a time. Two of the large\nplates were visible from the street; one was Henbane, the other\nStramonium. Yan gazed at them as often as he could. In a week they\nwere gone; but the names and looks were forever engraved on his\nmemory. Had he made bold to go in and ask permission to see the work,\nhis memory would have seized most of it in an hour.",
        "Tracks",
        "In the wet sand down by the edge of the brook he one day found some\ncurious markings–evidently tracks. Yan pored over them, then made a\nlife-size drawing of one. He shrewdly suspected it to be the track of\na Coon–nothing was too good or wild or rare for his valley. As soon\nas he could, he showed the track to the stableman whose dog was said\nto have killed a Coon once, and hence the man must be an authority on\nthe subject.",
        "“Is that a Coon track?” asked Yan timidly.",
        "“How do I know?” said the man roughly, and went on with his work. But\na stranger standing near, a curious person with shabby clothes, and\na new silk hat on the back of his head, said, “Let me see it.” Yan\nshowed it.",
        "“Is it natural size?”",
        "“Yes, sir.”",
        "“Yep, that’s a Coon track, all right. You look at all the big trees\nnear about whar you saw that; then when you find one with a hole in\nit, you look on the bark and you will find some Coon hars. Then you\nwill know you’ve got a Coon tree.”",
        "[Illustration: The Coon track]",
        "Yan took the earliest chance. He sought and found a great Basswood\nwith some gray hairs caught in the bark. He took them home with him,\nnot sure what kind they were. He sought the stranger, but he was gone,\nand no one knew him.",
        "How to identify the hairs was a question; but he remembered a friend\nwho had a Coon-skin carriage robe. A few hairs of these were compared\nwith those from the tree and left no doubt that the climber was a\nCoon. Thus Yan got the beginning of the idea that the very hairs of\neach, as well as its tracks, are different. He learned, also, how wise\nit is to draw everything that he wished to observe or describe. It\nwas accident, or instinct on his part, but he had fallen on a sound\nprinciple; there is nothing like a sketch to collect and convey\naccurate information of form–there is no better developer of true\nobservation.",
        "One day he noticed a common plant like an umbrella. He dug it up by\nthe root, and at the lower end he found a long white bulb. He tasted\nthis. It was much like a cucumber. He looked up “Gray’s School\nBotany,” and in the index saw the name, Indian Cucumber. The\ndescription seemed to tally, as far as he could follow its technical\nterms, though like all such, without a drawing it was far from\nsatisfactory. So he added the Indian Cucumber to his woodlore.",
        "On another occasion he chewed the leaves of a strange plant because he\nhad heard that that was the first test applied by the Indians. He soon\nbegan to have awful pains in his stomach. He hurried home in agony.\nHis mother gave him mustard and water till he vomited, then she boxed\nhis ears. His father came in during the process and ably supplemented\nthe punishment. He was then and there ordered to abstain forever from\nthe woods. Of course, he did not. He merely became more cautious about\nit all, and enjoyed his shanty with the added zest of secret sin.",

The hatchet was at once\nput back in the box, to be stolen more carefully later on.",
        "Biddy announced that she was going to the grocery shop. She met Yan\naround the corner and they made for the lot. Utterly regardless of\nproperty rights, she showed Yan how to chip off the bark of the\nBlack-cherry. “Don’t chip off all around; that’s bad luck–take it\non’y from the sunny side.” She filled a basket with the pieces and\nthey returned home.",

At first Granny chased him away; then when she seen that he\nwas awful sick, she got sorry and told him how to make Lung Balm. He\nwas to make two gallons each time and bring it to her. Then she took\nand fixed it so it was one-half as much and give it back to him. Well,\nin six months if he wasn’t all right.”",
        "Biddy now complained nightly of “feelin’s” in her chest. These\nfeelings could be controlled only by a glass or two of Lung Balm.\nHer condition must have been critical, for one night after several\nnecessary doses of Balm her head seemed affected. She became\nabusive to the lady of the house and at the end of the month a less\ninteresting help was in her place.",
        "There were many lessons good and bad that Yan might have drawn from\nthis; but the only one that he took in was that the Black-cherry bark\nis a wonderful remedy. The family doctor said that it really was so,\nand Yan treasured up this as a new and precious fragment of woodcraft.",
        "Having once identified the tree, he was surprised to see that it was\nrather common, and was delighted to find it flourishing in his own\nGlenyan.",
        "This made him set down on paper all the trees he knew, and he was\nsurprised to find how few they were and how uncertain he was about\nthem.",

        "He had heard that the Indians knew the name and properties of every\ntree and plant in the woods, and that was what he wished to be able to\nsay of himself.",
        "One day by the bank of the river he noticed a pile of empty shells of\nthe fresh-water Mussel, or Clam. The shells were common enough, but\nwhy all together and marked in the same way? Around the pile on the\nmud were curious tracks and marks. There were so many that it was hard\nto find a perfect one, but when he did, remembering the Coon track,\nhe drew a picture of it. It was too small to be the mark of his old\nacquaintance. He did not find any one to tell him what it was, but one\nday he saw a round, brown animal hunched up on the bank eating a clam.\nIt dived into the water at his approach, but it reappeared swimming\nfarther on. Then, when it dived again, Yan saw by its long thin\ntail that it was a Muskrat, like the stuffed one he had seen in the\ntaxidermist’s window.",
        "He soon learned that the more he studied those tracks the more\ndifferent kinds he found. Many were rather mysterious, so he could\nonly draw them and put them aside, hoping some day for light. One\nof the strangest and most puzzling turned out to be the trail of a\nSnapper, and another proved to be merely the track of a Common Crow\nthat came to the water’s edge to drink.",
        "The curios that he gathered and stored in his shanty increased in\nnumber and in interest. The place became more and more part of\nhimself. Its concealment bettered as the foliage grew around it again,\nand he gloried in its wild seclusion and mystery, and wandered through\nthe woods with his bow and arrows, aiming harmless, deadly blows at\nsnickering Red-squirrels–though doubtless he would have been as sorry\nas they had he really hit one.",
        "Yan soon found out that he was not the only resident of the shanty.\nOne day as he sat inside wondering why he had not made a fireplace, so\nthat he could sit at an indoor fire, he saw a silent little creature\nflit along between two logs in the back wall. He remained still. A\nbeautiful little Woodmouse, for such it was, soon came out in plain\nview and sat up to look at Yan and wash its face. Yan reached out for\nhis bow and arrow, but the Mouse was gone in a flash. He fitted a\nblunt arrow to the string, then waited, and when the Mouse returned he\nshot the arrow. It missed the Mouse, struck the log and bounded back\ninto Yan’s face, giving him a stinging blow on the cheek. And as Yan\nrolled around grunting and rubbing his cheek, he thought, “This is\nwhat I tried to do to the Woodmouse.” Thenceforth, Yan made no attempt\nto harm the Mouse; indeed, he was willing to share his meals with it.\nIn time they became well acquainted, and Yan found that not one, but a\nwhole family, were sharing with him his shanty in the woods.",
        "Biddy’s remark about the Indian tobacco bore fruit. Yan was not a\nsmoker, but now he felt he must learn. He gathered a lot of this\ntobacco, put it to dry, and set about making a pipe–a real Indian\npeace pipe. He had no red sandstone to make it of, but a soft red\nbrick did very well. He first roughed out the general shape with his\nknife, and was trying to bore the bowl out with the same tool, when\nhe remembered that in one of the school-readers was an account of the\nIndian method of drilling into stone with a bow-drill and wet sand.\nOne of his schoolmates, the son of a woodworker, had seen his father\nuse a bow-drill. This knowledge gave him new importance in Yan’s eyes.\nUnder his guidance a bow-drill was made, and used much and on many\nthings till it was understood, and now it did real Indian service by\ndrilling the bowl and stem holes of the pipe.",
        "He made a stem of an Elderberry shoot, punching out the pith at home\nwith a long knitting-needle. Some white pigeon wing feathers trimmed\nsmall, and each tipped with a bit of pitch, were strung on a stout\nthread and fastened to the stem for a finishing touch; and he would\nsit by his camp fire solemnly smoking–a few draws only, for he did\nnot like it–then say, “Ugh, heap hungry,” knock the ashes out, and\nproceed with whatever work he had on hand.",
        "Thus he spent the bright Saturdays, hiding his accouterments each\nday in his shanty, washing the paint from his face in the brook, and\nreplacing the hated paper collar that the pride and poverty of his\nfamily made a daily necessity, before returning home. He was a little\ndreamer, but oh! what happy dreams. Whatever childish sorrow he found\nat home he knew he could always come out here and forget and be happy\nas a king–be a real King in a Kingdom wholly after his heart, and all\nhis very own.",
        "A Crisis",
        "At school he was a model boy except in one respect–he had strange,\nuncertain outbreaks of disrespect for his teachers. One day he amused\nhimself by covering the blackboard with ridiculous caricatures of the\nprincipal, whose favourite he undoubtedly was. They were rather clever\nand proportionately galling. The principal set about an elaborate plan\nto discover who had done them. He assembled the whole school and began\ncross-examining one wretched dunce, thinking him the culprit. The lad\ndenied it in a confused and guilty way; the principal was convinced of\nhis guilt, and reached for his rawhide, while the condemned set up a\nhowl. To the surprise of the assembly, Yan now spoke up, and in a tone\nof weary impatience said:",
        "“Oh, let him alone. I did it.”",
        "His manner and the circumstances were such that every one laughed. The\nprincipal was nettled to fury. He forgot his manhood; he seized Yan\nby the collar. He was considered a timid boy; his face was white; his\nlips set. The principal beat him with the rawhide till the school\ncried “Shame,” but he got no cry from Yan.",
        "That night, on undressing for bed, his brother Rad saw the long black\nwales from head to foot, and an explanation was necessary. He was\nincapable of lying; his parents learned of his wickedness, and new and\nharsh punishments were added. Next day was Saturday. He cut his usual\ndouble or Saturday’s share of wood for the house, and, bruised and\nsmarting, set out for the one happy spot he knew. The shadow lifted\nfrom his spirit as he drew near. He was already forming a plan for\nadding a fireplace and chimney to his house. He followed the secret\npath he had made with aim to magnify its secrets. He crossed the open\nglade, was, nearly at the shanty, when he heard voices–loud, coarse\nvoices–coming from his shanty. He crawled up close. The door\nwas open. There in his dear cabin were three tramps playing cards and\ndrinking out of a bottle. On the ground beside them were his shell\nnecklaces broken up to furnish poker chips. In a smouldering fire\noutside were the remains of his bow and arrows.",
        "Poor Yan! His determination to be like an Indian under torture\nhad sustained him in the teacher’s cruel beating and in his home\npunishments, but this was too much. He fled to a far and quiet corner\nand there flung himself down and sobbed in grief and rage–he would\nhave killed them if he could. After an hour or two he came trembling\nback to see the tramps finish their game and their liquor; then they\ndefiled the shanty and left it in ruins.",
        "The brightest thing in his life was gone–a King discrowned,\ndethroned. Feeling now every wale on his back and legs, he sullenly\nwent home.",
        "This was late in the summer. Autumn followed last, with shortening\ndays and chilly winds. Yan had no chance to see his glen, even had he\ngreatly wished it. He became more studious; books were his pleasure\nnow. He worked harder than ever, winning honour at school, but\nattracting no notice at the home, where piety reigned.",
        "The teachers and some of the boys remarked that Yan was getting very\nthin and pale. Never very robust, he now looked like an invalid; but\nat home no note was taken of the change. His mother’s thoughts were\nall concentrated on his scapegrace younger brother. For two years she\nhad rarely spoken to Yan peaceably. There was a hungry place in\nhis heart as he left the house unnoticed each morning and saw his\ngraceless brother kissed and darlinged. At school their positions\nwere reversed. Yan was the principal’s pride. He had drawn no more\ncaricatures, and the teacher flattered himself that that beating was\nwhat had saved the pale-faced head boy.",
        "He grew thinner and heart-hungrier till near Christmas, when the\nbreakdown came.",
        "“He is far gone in consumption,” said the physician. “He cannot live\nover a month or two”",
        "[Illustration: “There in his dear cabin were three tramps\"]",
        "“He must live,” sobbed the conscience-stricken mother. “He must\nlive–O God, he must live.”",
        "All that suddenly awakened mother’s love could do was done. The\nskilful physician did his best, but it was the mother that saved him.\nShe watched over him night and day; she studied his wishes and comfort\nin every way. She prayed by his bedside, and often asked God to\nforgive her for her long neglect. It was Yan’s first taste of\nmother-love. Why she had ignored him so long was unknown. She was\nsimply erratic, but now she awoke to his brilliant gifts, his steady,\nearnest life, already purposeful.",
        "The Lynx",
        "As winter waned, Yan’s strength returned. He was wise enough to use\nhis new ascendency to get books. The public librarian, a man of broad\nculture who had fought his own fight, became interested in him, and\nhelped him to many works that otherwise he would have missed.",
        "“Wilson’s Ornithology” and “Schoolcraft’s Indians” were the most\nimportant. And they were sparkling streams in the thirst-parched land.",
        "In March he was fast recovering. He could now take long walks; and one\nbright day of snow he set off with his brother’s Dog. His steps bent\nhillward. The air was bright and bracing, he stepped with unexpected\nvigour, and he made for far Glenyan, without at first meaning to go\nthere. But, drawn by the ancient attraction, he kept on. The secret\npath looked not so secret, now the leaves were off; but the Glen\nlooked dearly familiar as he reached the wider stretch.",
        "His eye fell on a large, peculiar track quite fresh in the snow. It\nwas five inches across, big enough for a Bear track, but there were no\nsigns of claws or toe pads. The steps were short and the tracks had\nnot sunken as they would for an animal as heavy as a Bear.",
        "As one end of each showed the indications of toes, he could see what\nway it went, and followed up the Glen. The dog sniffed at it uneasily,\nbut showed no disposition to go ahead. Yan tramped up past the ruins\nof his shanty, now painfully visible since the leaves had fallen, and\nhis heart ached at the sight. The trail led up the valley, and crossed\nthe brook on a log, and Yan became convinced that he was on the track\nof a large Lynx. Though a splendid barker, Grip, the dog, was known to\nbe a coward, and now he slunk behind the boy, sniffing at the great\ntrack and absolutely refusing to go ahead.",
        "Yan was fascinated by the long rows of footprints, and when he came\nto a place where the creature had leaped ten or twelve feet without\nvisible cause, he felt satisfied that he had found a Lynx, and the\nlove of adventure prompted him to go on, although he had not even a\nstick in his hand or a knife in his pocket. He picked up the best club\nhe could find–a dry branch two feet long and two inches through, and\nfollowed. The dog was now unwilling to go at all; he hung back, and\nhad to be called at each hundred yards.",
        "They were at last in the dense Hemlock woods at the upper end of the\nvalley, when a peculiar sound like the call of a deep-voiced cat was\nheard.",
        "Yow! Yow! Yowl!\nYan stood still. The dog, although a large and powerful retriever,\nwhimpered, trembled and crawled up close.",
        "The sound increased in volume. The yowling meouw came louder,\nlouder and nearer, then suddenly clear and close, as though the\ncreature had rounded a point and entered an opening. It was positively\nblood-curdling now. The dog could stand it no more; he turned and went\nas fast as he could for home, leaving Yan to his fate. There was no\nlonger any question that it was a Lynx. Yan had felt nervous before\nand the abject flight of the dog reacted on him. He realized how\ndefenseless he was, still weak from his illness, and he turned and\nwent after the dog. At first he walked. But having given in to his\nfears, they increased; and as the yowling continued he finally ran his\nfastest. The sounds were left behind, but Yan never stopped until he\nhad left the Glen and was once more in the open valley of the river.\nHere he found the valiant retriever trembling all over. Yan received\nhim with a contemptuous kick, and, boylike, as soon as he could find\nsome stones, he used them till Grip was driven home.",
        "Most lads have some sporting instinct, and his elder brother, though\nnot of Yan’s tastes, was not averse to going gunning when there was a\nprospect of sport.",
        "Yan decided to reveal to Rad the secret of his glen. He had never been\nallowed to use a gun, but Rad had one, and Yan’s vivid account of his\nadventure had the desired effect. His method was characteristic.",
        "[Illustration: “It surely was a Lynx.\"]",
        "“Rad, would you go huntin’ if there was lots to hunt?”",
        "“Course I would.”",
        "“Well, I know a place not ten miles away where there are all kinds of\nwild animals–hundreds of them.”",
        "“Yes, you do, I don’t think. Humph!”",
        "“Yes, I do; and I’ll tell you, if you will promise never to tell a\nsoul.”",
        "“Ba-ah!”",
        "“Well, I just had an adventure with a Lynx up there now, and if you\nwill come with your gun we can get him.”",
        "Then Yan related all that had passed, and it lost nothing in his\ntelling. His brother was impressed enough to set out under Yan’s\nguidance on the following Saturday.",
        "Yan hated to reveal to his sneering, earthy-minded brother all the\njoys and sorrows he had found in the Glen, but now that it seemed\ncompulsory he found keen pleasure in playing the part of the crafty\nguide. With unnecessary caution he first led in a wrong direction,\nthen trying, but failing, to extort another promise of secrecy, he\nturned at an angle, pointed to a distant tree, saying with all the\nmeaning he could put into it: “Ten paces beyond that tree is a trail\nthat shall lead us into the secret valley.” After sundry other\nceremonies of the sort, they were near the inway, when a man came\nwalking through the bushes. On his shoulders he carried something.\nWhen he came close, Yan saw to his deep disgust that that something\nwas the Lynx–yes, it surely was his Lynx.",
        "They eagerly plied the man with questions. He told them that he had\nkilled it the day before, really. It had been prowling for the last\nweek or more about Kernore’s bush; probably it was a straggler from up\nnorth.",
        "This was all intensely fascinating to Yan, but in it was a jarring\nnote. Evidently this man considered the Glen–his Glen–as an\nordinary, well-known bit of bush, possibly part of his farm–not by\nany means the profound mystery that Yan would have had it.",
        "The Lynx was a fine large one. The stripes on its face and the wide\nopen yellow eyes gave a peculiarly wild, tiger-like expression that\nwas deeply gratifying to Yan’s romantic soul.",
        "It was not so much of an adventure as a might-have-been adventure;\nbut it left a deep impress on the boy, and it also illustrated the\naccuracy of his instincts in identifying creatures that he had never\nbefore seen, but knew only through the slight descriptions of very\nunsatisfactory books.",
        "Froth",
        "From now on to the spring Yan was daily gaining in strength, and he\nand his mother came closer together. She tried to take an interest in\nthe pursuits that were his whole nature. But she also strove hard to\nmake him take an interest in her world. She was a morbidly religious\nwoman. Her conversation was bristling with Scripture texts. She had\na vast store of them–indeed, she had them all; and she used them on\nevery occasion possible and impossible, with bewildering efficiency.",
        "If ever she saw a group of young people dancing, romping, playing any\ngame, or even laughing heartily, she would interrupt them to say,\n\"Children, are you sure you can ask God’s blessing on all this? Do you\nthink that beings with immortal souls to save should give rein to such\nfrivolity! I fear you are sinning, and be sure your sin will find\nyou out. Remember, that for every idle word and deed we must give an\naccount to the Great Judge of Heaven and earth.”",
        "She was perfectly sincere in all this, but she never ceased, except\nduring the time of her son’s illness, when, under orders from the\ndoctor, she avoided the painful topic of eternal happiness and tried\nto simulate an interest in his pursuits. This was the blessed truce\nthat brought them together.",
        "He found a confidante for the first time since he met the collarless\nstranger, and used to tell all his loves and fears among the woodfolk\nand things. He would talk about this or that bird or flower, and hoped\nto find out its name, till the mother would suddenly feel shocked that\nany being with an immortal soul to save could talk so seriously\nabout anything outside of the Bible; then gently reprove her son and\nherself, too, with a number of texts.",
        "He might reply with others, for he was well equipped. But her\nunanswerable answer would be: “There is but one thing needful. What\nprofiteth it a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?”",
        "These fencing bouts grew more frequent as Yan grew stronger and the\ndoctor’s inhibition was removed.",
        "After one of unusual warmth, Yan realized with a chill that all her\ninterest in his pursuits had been an affected one. He was silent a\nlong time, then said: “Mother! you like to talk about your Bible. It\ntells you the things that you long to know, that you love to learn.\nYou would be unhappy if you went a day without reading a chapter or\ntwo. That is your nature; God made you so.",
        "“I have been obliged to read the Bible all my life. Every day I read a\nchapter; but I do not love it. I read it because I am forced to do it.\nIt tells me nothing I want to know. It does not teach me to love God,\nwhich you say is the one thing needful. But I go out into the woods,\nand every bird and flower I see stirs me to the heart with something,\nI do not know what it is; only I love them: I love them with all my\nstrength, and they make me feel like praying when your Bible does not.\nThey are my Bible. This is my nature. God made me so.”",
        "The mother was silent after this, but Yan could see that she was\npraying for him as for a lost soul.",
        "A few days later they were out walking in the early spring morning.\nA Shore-lark on a clod whistled prettily as it felt the growing\nsunshine.",
        "Yan strained his eyes and attention to take it in. He crept up near\nit. It took wing, and as it went he threw after it a short stick he\nwas carrying. The stick whirled over and struck the bird. It fell\nfluttering. Yan rushed wildly after it and caught it in spite of his\nmother’s calling him back.",
        "He came with the bird in his hand, but it did not live many minutes.\nHis mother was grieved and disgusted. She said. “So this is the great\nlove you have for the wild things; the very first spring bird to sing\nyou must club to death. I do not understand your affections. Are not\ntwo sparrows sold for one farthing, and yet not one of them falls to\nthe ground without the knowledge of your heavenly Father.”",
        "Yan was crushed. He held the dead bird in his hand and said,\ncontradictorily, as the tears stood in his eyes, “I wish I hadn’t; but\noh, it was so beautiful.”",
        "He could not explain, because he did not understand, and yet was no\nhypocrite.",
        "Weeks later a cheap trip gave him the chance for the first time in his\nlife to see Niagara. As he stood with his mother watching the racing\nflood, in the gorge below the cataract, he noticed straws, bubbles and\nfroth, that seemed to be actually moving upstream. He said:",
        "“Mother, you see the froth how it seems to go up-stream.”",
        "“Well!”",
        "“Yet we know it is a trifle and means nothing. We know that just below\nthe froth is the deep, wide, terrible, irresistible, arrowy flood,\nsurging all the other way.”",
        "“Yes, my son.”",
        "“Well, Mother, when I killed the Shore-lark, that was froth going the\nwrong way, I did love the little bird. I know now why I killed it.\nBecause it was going away from me. If I could have seen it near and\ncould have touched it, or even have heard it every day, I should never\nhave wished to harm it. I didn’t mean to kill it, only to\nget it. You gather flowers because you love to keep them near you,\nnot because you want to destroy them. They die and you are sorry. I\nonly tried to gather the Shore-lark as you would a flower. It died,\nand I was very, very sorry.”",
        "“Nevertheless,” the mother replied, “the merciful man is merciful unto\nhis beast. He who hearkens when the young Ravens cry, surely took note\nof it, and in His great Book of Remembrance it is written down against\nyou.”",
        "And from that time they surely drifted apart.",
        "SANGER & SAM",
        "The New Home",
        "Yan was now fourteen years old long-legged, thin, and growing fast The\ndoctor marked this combination and said: “Send him on a farm for a\nyear.”",
        "Thus it was that an arrangement was made for Yan to work for his board\nat the farmhouse of William Raften of Sanger.",
        "Sanger was a settlement just emerging from the early or backwoods\nperiod.",
        "The recognized steps are, first, the frontier or woods where all\nis unbroken forest and Deer abound; next the backwoods where small\nclearings appear; then a settlement where the forest and clearings are\nabout equal and the Deer gone; last, an agricultural district, with\nmere shreds of forest remaining.",
        "Thirty years before, Sanger had been “taken up” by a population\nchiefly from Ireland, sturdy peasantry for the most part, who brought\nwith them the ancient feud that has so long divided Ireland–the\nbitter quarrel between the Catholics or “Dogans” (why so called none\nknew) and Protestants, more usually styled “Prattisons.” The colours\nof the Catholics were green and white; of the Protestants orange\nand blue; and hence another distinctive name of the latter was\n\"Orangemen.”",
        "These two factions split the social structure in two vertically. There\nwere, in addition, several horizontal lines of cleavage which, like\ngeological seams, ran across both segments.",
        "In those days, the early part of the nineteenth century, the British\nGovernment used to assist desirable persons who wished to emigrate to\nCanada from Ireland. This aid consisted of a free ocean passage. Many\nwho could not convince the Government of their desirability and yet\ncould raise the money, came with them, paying their regular steerage\nrate of $15. These were alike to the outside world, but not to\nthemselves. Those who paid their way were “passengers,” and were, in\ntheir own opinion, many social worlds above the assisted ones, who\nwere called “Emmy Grants.” This distinction was never forgotten among\nthe residents of Sanger.",
        "Yet two other social grades existed. Every man and boy in Sanger was\nan expert with the axe; was wonderfully adroit. The familiar phrase,\n\"He’s a good man,” had two accepted meanings: If obviously applied to\na settler during the regular Saturday night Irish row in the little\ntown of Downey’s Dump, it meant he was an able man with his fists;\nbut if to his home life on the farm, it implied that he was unusually\ndexterous with the axe. A man who fell below standard was despised.\nSince the houses of hewn logs were made by their owners, they\nreflected the axemen’s skill. There were two styles of log\narchitecture; the shanty with corners criss-cross, called hog-pen\nfinish, and the other, the house with the corners neatly finished,\ncalled dovetail finish. In Sanger it was a social black eye to live in\na house of the first kind. The residents were considered “scrubs” or\n\"riff-raff” by those whose superior axemanship had provided the\nmore neatly finished dwelling. A later division crept in among the\n\"dovetailers” themselves when a brickyard was opened. The more\nprosperous settlers put up neat little brick houses. To the surprise\nof all, one Phil O’Leary, a poor but prolific Dogan, leaped at once\nfrom a hog-pen log to a fine brick, and caused no end of perplexity\nto the ruling society queens, simply paralyzing the social register,\nsince his nine fat daughters now had claims with the best. Many,\nhowever, whose brick houses were but five years old, denounced the\nO’Learys as upstarts and for long witheld all social recognition.\nWilliam Raften, as the most prosperous man in the community, was\nfirst to appear in red bricks. His implacable enemy, Char-less (two\nsyllables) Boyle, egged on by his wife, now also took the red brick\nplunge, though he dispensed with masons and laid the bricks himself,\nwith the help of his seventeen sons. These two men, though Orangemen\nboth, were deadly enemies, as the wives were social rivals. Raften was\nthe stronger and richer man, but Boyle, whose father had paid his own\nsteerage rate, knew all about Raften’s father, and always wound up\nany discussion by hurling in Raften’s teeth: “Don’t talk to me, ye\nupstart. Everybody knows ye are nothing but a Emmy Grant.” This was\nthe one fly in the Raften ointment. No use denying it. His father\nhad accepted a free passage, true, and Boyle had received a free\nhomestead, but what of that–that counted for nothing. Old Boyle had\nbeen a “PASSENGER,” old Raften an “EMMY GRANT.”",
        "This was the new community that Yan had entered, and the words Dogan\nand Prattison, “green” and “orange and blue,” began to loom large,\nalong with the ideas and animosities they stood for.",
        "The accent of the Sangerite was mixed. First, there was a rich Irish\nbrogue with many Irish words; this belonged chiefly to the old folks.\nThe Irish of such men as Raften was quite evident in their speech, but\nnot strong enough to warrant the accepted Irish spelling of books,\nexcept when the speaker was greatly excited. The young generation\nhad almost no Irish accent, but all had sifted down to the peculiar\nburring nasal whine of the backwoods Canadian.",
        "Mr. and Mrs. Raften met Yan at the station. They had supper together\nat the tavern and drove him to their home, where they showed him into\nthe big dining-room–living-room–kitchen. Over behind the stove was\na tall, awkward boy with carroty hair and small, dark eyes set much\naslant in the saddest of faces. Mrs. Raften said, “Come, Sam, and\nshake hands with Yan.” Sam came sheepishly forward, shook hands in a\nflabby way, and said, in drawling tones, “How-do,” then retired behind\nthe stove to gaze with melancholy soberness at Yan, whenever he could\ndo so without being caught at it. Mr. and Mrs. Raften were attending\nto various matters elsewhere, and Yan was left alone and miserable.\nThe idea of giving up college to go on a farm had been a hard one for\nhim to accept, but he had sullenly bowed to his father’s command and\nthen at length learned to like the prospect of getting away from\nBonnerton into the country. After all, it was but for a year, and it\npromised so much of joy. Sunday-school left behind. Church reduced to\na minimum. All his life outdoors, among fields and woods–surely this\nspelled happiness; but now that he was really there, the abomination\nof desolation seemed sitting on all things and the evening was one\nof unalloyed misery. He had nothing to tell of, but a cloud of black\ndespair seemed to have settled for good on the world. His mouth was\npinching very hard and his eyes blinking to keep back the tears when\nMrs. Raften came into the room. She saw at a glance what was wrong.\n\"He’s homesick,” she said to her husband. “He’ll be all right\nto-morrow,” and she took Yan by the hand and led him upstairs to bed.",
        "Twenty minutes later she came to see if he was comfortable. She tucked\nthe clothes in around him, then, stooping down for a good-night kiss,\nshe found his face wet with tears. She put her arms about him for a\nmoment, kissed him several times, and said, “Never mind, you will feel\nall right to-morrow,” then wisely left him alone.",
        "Whence came that load of misery and horror, or whither it went, Yan\nnever knew. He saw it no more, and the next morning he began to\ninterest himself in his new world.",
        "William Raften had a number of farms all in fine order and clear\nof mortgages; and each year he added to his estates. He was sober,\nshrewd, even cunning, hated by most of his neighbours because he was\ntoo clever for them and kept on getting richer. His hard side was for\nthe world and his soft side for his family. Not that he was really\nsoft in any respect. He had had to fight his life-battle alone,\nbeginning with nothing, and the many hard knocks had hardened him, but\nthe few who knew him best could testify to the warm Irish heart that\ncontinued unchanged within him, albeit it was each year farther\nfrom the surface. His manners, even in the house, were abrupt and\nmasterful. There was no mistaking his orders, and no excuse for not\ncomplying with them. To his children when infants, and to his wife\nonly, he was always tender, and those who saw him cold and grasping,\noverreaching the sharpers of the grain market, would scarcely have\nrecognized the big, warm-hearted happy-looking father at home an hour\nlater when he was playing horse with his baby daughter or awkwardly\npaying post-graduate court to his smiling wife.",
        "He had little “eddication,” could hardly read, and was therefore\ngreatly impressed with the value of “book larnin’,” and determined\nthat his own children should have the “best that money could git in\nthat line,” which probably meant that they should read fluently. His\nown reading was done on Sunday mornings, when he painfully spelled out\nthe important items in a weekly paper; “important” meant referring\nto the produce market or the prize ring, for he had been known and\nrespected as a boxer, and dearly loved the exquisite details of the\nlatest bouts. He used to go to church with his wife once a month to\nplease her, and thought it very unfair therefore that she should take\nno interest in his favourite hobby–the manly art.",
        "Although hard and even brutal in his dealings with men, he could not\nbear to see an animal ill used. “The men can holler when they’re hurt,\nbut the poor dumb baste has no protection.” He was the only farmer in\nthe country that would not sell or shoot a worn-out horse. “The poor\nbrute has wurruked hard an’ hez airned his kape for the rest av his\ndays.” So Duncan, Jerry and several others were “retired” and lived\ntheir latter days in idleness, in one case for more than ten years.",
        "Raften had thrashed more than one neighbour for beating a horse, and\nonce, on interfering, was himself thrashed, for he had the ill-luck to\nhappen on a prizefighter. But that had no lasting effect on him. He\ncontinued to champion the dumb brute in his own brutal way.",
        "Among the neighbours the perquisites of the boys were the calfskins.\nThe cows’ milk was needed and the calves of little value, so usually\nthey were killed when too young for food. The boys did the killing,\nmaking more or less sport of it, and the skins, worth fifty cents\napiece green and twenty-five cents dry, at the tannery, were their\nproper pay. Raften never allowed his son to kill the calves. “Oi can’t\nkill a poor innocent calf mesilf an’ I won’t hev me boy doin’ it,” he\nsaid. Thus Sam was done out of a perquisite, and did not forget the\ngrievance.",
        "Mrs. Raften was a fine woman, a splendid manager, loving her home and\nher family, her husband’s loyal and ablest supporter, although she\nthought that William was sometimes a “leetle hard” on the boys. They\nhad had a large family, but most of the children had died. Those\nremaining were Sam, aged fifteen, and Minnie, aged three.",
        "Yan’s duties were fixed at once. The poultry and half the pigs and\ncows were to be his charge. He must also help Sam with various other\nchores.",
        "There was plenty to do and clear rules about doing it. But there was\nalso time nearly every day for other things more in the line of his\ntastes; for even if he were hard on the boys in work hours, Raften\nsaw to it that when they did play they should have a good time. His\nroughness and force made Yan afraid of him, and as it was Raften’s\nway to say nothing until his mind was fully made up, and then say it\n\"strong,” Yan was left in doubt as to whether or not he was giving\nsatisfaction.",
        "Sam",
        "Sam Raften turned out to be more congenial than he looked. His slow,\ndrawling speech had given a wrong impression of stupidity, and, after\na formal showing of the house under Mr. Raften, a real investigation\nwas headed by Sam. “This yer’s the paaar-le-r,” said he, unlocking a\nsort of dark cellar aboveground and groping to open what afterward\nproved to be a dead, buried and almost forgotten window. In Sanger\nsettlement the farmhouse parlour is not a room; it is an institution.\nIt is kept closed all the week except when the minister calls, and\nthe one at Raften’s was the pure type. Its furniture consisted of six\npainted chairs (fifty cents each), two rockers ($1.49), one melodeon\n(thirty-two bushels of wheat–the agent asked forty), a sideboard made\nat home of the case the melodeon came in, one rag carpet woofed at\nhome and warped and woven in exchange for wool, one center-table\nvarnished (!) ($9.00 cash, $11.00 catalogue). On the center-table was\none tintype album, a Bible, and some large books for company use.\nThough dusted once a week, they were never moved, and it was years\nlater before they were found to have settled permanently into the\nvarnish of the table. In extremely uncostly frames on the wall were\nthe coffin-plates of the departed members of the family. It was the\ncustom at Sanger to honour the dead by bringing back from the funeral\nthe name-plate and framing it on a black background with some supposed\nappropriate scripture text.",
        "The general atmosphere of the room was dusty and religious as it\nwas never opened except on Sundays or when the parson called, which\ninstituted a sort of temporary Sunday, and the two small windows were\nkept shut and plugged as well as muffled always, with green paper\nblinds and cotton hangings. It was a thing apart from the rest of the\nhouse–a sort of family ghost-room: a chamber of horrors, seen but\nonce a week.",
        "But it contained one thing at least of interest–something that at\nonce brought Sam and Yan together. This was a collection of a score\nof birds’ eggs. They were all mixed together in an old glass-topped\ncravat box, half full of bran. None of them were labelled or properly\nblown. A collector would not have given it a second glance, but it\nproved an important matter. It was as though two New Yorkers, one\ndisguised as a Chinaman and the other as a Negro, had accidently\nmet in Greenland and by chance one had made the sign of the secret\nbrotherhood to which they both belonged.",
        "“Do you like these things?” said Yan, with sudden interest and warmth,\nin spite of the depressing surroundings.",
        "“You bet,” said Sam. “And I’d a-had twice as many only Da said it was\ndoing no good and birds was good for the farm.”",
        "“Well, do you know their names?”",
        "“Wall, I should say so. I know every Bird that flies and all about it,\nor putty near it,” drawled Sam, with an unusual stretch for him, as he\nwas not given to bragging.",
        "“I wish I did. Can’t I get some eggs to take home?”",
        "“No; Da said if I wouldn’t take any more he’d lend me his Injun Chief\ngun to shoot Rabbits with.”",
        "“What? Are there Rabbits here?”",
        "“Wall, I should say so. I got three last winter.”",
        "“But I mean now,” said Yan, with evident disappointment.",
        "“They ain’t so easy to get at now, but we can try. Some day\nwhen all the work’s done I’ll ask Da for his gun.”",
        "“When all the work’s done,” was a favourite expression of the Raftens\nfor indefinitely shelving a project, it sounded so reasonable and was\nreally so final.",
        "Sam opened up the lower door of the sideboard and got out some flint\narrow-heads picked up in the ploughing, the teeth of a Beaver dating\nfrom the early days of the settlement, and an Owl very badly stuffed.\nThe sight of these precious things set Yan all ablaze. “Oh!” was all\nhe could say. Sam was gratified to see such effect produced by the\nfamily possessions and explained, “Da shot that off’n the barn an’ the\nhired man stuffed it.”",
        "The boys were getting on well together now. They exchanged\nconfidences all day as they met in doing chores. In spite of the long\ninterruptions, they got on so well that Sam said after supper, “Say,\nYan, I’m going to show you something, but you must promise never\nto tell–Swelpye!” Of course Yan promised and added the absolutely\nbinding and ununderstandable word–\"Swelpme.”",
        "“Le’s both go to the barn,” said Sam.",
        "When they were half way he said: “Now I’ll let on I went back\nfor something. You go on an’ round an’ I’ll meet you under the\n’rusty-coat’ in the orchard.” When they met under the big russet apple\ntree, Sam closed one of his melancholy eyes and said in a voice of\nunnecessary hush, “Follow me.” He led to the other end of the orchard\nwhere stood the old log house that had been the home before the\nbuilding of the brick one. It was now used as a tool house. Sam led up\na ladder to the loft (this was all wholly delightful). There at the\nfar end, and next the little gable pane, he again cautioned secrecy,\nthen when on invitation Yan had once more “swelped” himself, he\nrummaged in a dirty old box and drew out a bow, some arrows, a rusty\nsteel trap, an old butcher knife, some fish-hooks, a flint and steel,\na box full of matches, and some dirty, greasy-looking stuff that he\nsaid-was dried meat. “You see,” he explained, “I always wanted to be a\nhunter, and Da was bound I’d be a dentist. Da said there was no money\nin hunting, but one day he had to go to the dentist an’ it cost four\ndollars, an’ the man wasn’t half a day at the job, so he wanted me to\nbe a dentist, but I wanted to be a hunter, an’ one day he licked me\nand Bud (Bud, that’s my brother that died a year ago. If you hear Ma\ntalk you’ll think he was an angel, but I always reckoned he was a\ncrazy galoot, an’ he was the worst boy in school by odds). Wall, Da\nlicked us awful for not feeding the hogs, so Bud got ready to clear\nout, an’ at first I felt just like he did an’ said I’d go too, an’\nwe’d j’ine the Injuns. Anyhow, I’d sure go if ever I was licked again,\nan’ this was the outfit we got together. Bud wanted to steal Da’s gun\nan’ I wouldn’t. I tell you I was hoppin’ mad that time, an’ Bud was\nwuss–but I cooled off an’ talked to Bud. I says, ’Say now, Bud, it\nwould take about a month of travel to get out West, an’ if the Injuns\ndidn’t want nothin’ but our scalps that wouldn’t be no fun, an’ Da\nain’t really so bad, coz we sho’ly did starve them pigs so one of\n’em died.’ I reckon we deserved all we got–anyhow, it was all dumb\nfoolishness about skinnin’ out, though I’d like mighty well to be a\nhunter. Well, Bud died that winter. You seen the biggest coffin plate\non the wall? Well, that’s him. I see Ma lookin’ at it an’ cryin’ the\nother day. Da says he’ll send me to college if I’ll be a dentist or a\nlawyer–lawyers make lots of money: Da had a lawsuit once–an’ if I\ndon’t, he says I kin go to–you know.”",
        "Here was Yan’s own kind of mind, and he opened his heart. He told all\nabout his shanty in the woods and how he had laboured at and loved it.\nHe was full of enthusiasm as of old, boiling over with purpose and\nenergy, and Sam, he realized, had at least two things that he had\nnot–ability with tools and cool judgment. It was like having the best\nparts of his brother Rad put into a real human being. And remembering\nthe joy of his Glen, Yan said:",
        "“Let’s build a shanty in the woods by the creek; your father won’t\ncare, will he?”",
        "“Not he, so long as the work’s done.”",
        "The Wigwam",
        "The very next day they must begin. As soon as every chore was done\nthey went to the woods to select a spot.",
        "The brook, or “creek,” as they called it, ran through a meadow, then\nthrough a fence into the woods. This was at first open and grassy, but\nfarther down the creek it was joined by a dense cedar swamp. Through\nthis there was no path, but Sam said that there was a nice high place\nbeyond. The high ground seemed a long way off in the woods, though\nonly a hundred yards through the swamp, but it was the very place for\na camp–high, dry and open hard woods, with the creek in front and the\ncedar swamp all around. Yan was delighted. Sam caught no little of the\nenthusiasm, and having brought an axe, was ready to begin the shanty.\nBut Yan had been thinking hard all morning, and now he said: “Sam, we\ndon’t want to be White hunters. They’re no good; we want to be\nIndians.”",
        "“Now, that’s just where you fool yourself,” said Sam. “Da says there\nain’t nothin’ an Injun can do that a White-man can’t do better.”",
        "“Oh, what are you talking about?” said Yan warmly. “A White hunter\ncan’t trail a moccasined foot across a hard granite rock. A White\nhunter can’t go into the woods with nothing but a knife and make\neverything he needs. A White hunter can’t hunt with bows and arrows,\nand catch game with snares, can he? And there never yet was a White\nman could make a Birch canoe.” Then, changing his tone, Yan went on:\n\"Say, now, Sam, we want to be the best kind of hunters, don’t we, so\nas to be ready for going out West. Let’s be Injuns and do everything\nlike Injuns.”",
        "After all, this had the advantage of romance and picturesqueness, and\nSam consented to “try it for awhile, anyhow.” And now came the point\nof Yan’s argument. “Injuns don’t live in shanties; they live in\nteepees. Why not make a teepee instead?”",
        "“That would be just bully,” said Sam, who had seen pictures enough to\nneed no description, “but what are we to make it of?”",
        "“Well,” answered Yan, promptly assuming the leadership and rejoicing\nin his ability to speak as an authority, “the Plains Injuns make their\nteepees of skins, but the wood Injuns generally use Birch bark.”",
        "“Well, I bet you can’t find skins or Birch bark enough in this woods\nto make a teepee big enough for a Chipmunk to chaw nuts in.”",
        "“We can use Elm bark.”",
        "“That’s a heap easier,” replied Sam, “if it’ll answer, coz we cut a\nlot o’ Elm logs last winter and the bark’ll be about willin’ to peel\nnow. But first let’s plan it out.”",
        "This was a good move, one Yan would have overlooked. He would probably\nhave got a lot of material together and made the plan afterward, but\nSam had been taught to go about his work with method.",
        "So Yan sketched on a smooth log his remembrance of an Indian teepee.\n\"It seems to me it was about this shape, with the poles sticking up\nlike that, a hole for the smoke here and another for the door there.”",
        "“Sounds like you hain’t never seen one,” remarked Sam, with more point\nthan politeness, “but we kin try it. Now ’bout how big?”",
        "Eight feet high and eight feet across was decided to be about right.\nFour poles, each ten feet long, were cut in a few minutes, Yan\ncarrying them to a smooth place above the creek as fast as Sam cut\nthem.",
        "“Now, what shall we tie them with?” said Yan.",
        "“You mean for rope?”",
        "“Yes, only we must get everything in the woods; real rope ain’t\nallowed.”",
        "“I kin fix that,” said Sam; “when Da double-staked the orchard fence,\nhe lashed every pair of stakes at the top with Willow withes.”",
        "“That’s so–I quite forgot,” said Yan. In a few minutes they were\nat work trying to tie the four poles together with slippery stiff\nWillows, but it was no easy matter. They had to be perfectly tight or\nthey would slip and fall in a heap each time they were raised, and it\nseemed at length that the boys would be forced to the impropriety of\nusing hay wire, when they heard a low grunt, and turning, saw William\nRaften standing with his hands behind him as though he had watched\nthem for hours.",
        "The boys were no little startled. Raften had a knack of turning up at\nany point when something was going on, taking in the situation fully,\nand then, if he disapproved, of expressing himself in a few words of\nblistering mockery delivered in a rich Irish brogue. Just what view\nhe would take of their pastime the boys had no idea, but awaited with\nuneasiness. If they had been wasting time when they should have been\nworking there is no question but that they would have been sent with\ncontumely to more profitable pursuits, but this was within their\nrightful play hours, and Raften, after regarding them with a searching\nlook, said slowly: “Bhoys!” (Sam felt easier; his father would have\nsaid ’Bhise_” if really angry.) “Fhat’s the good o’ wastin’ yer\ntime” (Yan’s heart sank) “wid Willow withes fur a job like that? They\ncan’t be made to howld. Whoi don’t ye git some hay woire or coord at\nthe barrun?”",
        "The boys were greatly relieved, but still this friendly overture might\nbe merely a feint to open the way for a home thrust. Sam was silent.\nSo Yan said, presently, “We ain’t allowed to use anything but what the\nIndians had or could get in the woods.”",
        "“An’ who don’t allow yez?”",
        "“The rules.”",
        "“Oh,” said William, with some amusement. “Oi see! Hyar.”",
        "He went into the woods looking this way and that, and presently\nstopped at a lot of low shrubs.",
        "“Do ye know what this is, Yan?”",
        "“No, sir.”",
        "“Le’s see if yer man enough to break it aff.”",
        "Yan tried. The wood was brittle enough, but the bark, thin, smooth and\npliant, was as tough as leather, and even a narrow strip defied his\nstrength.",
        "“That’s Litherwood,” said Raften. “That’s what the Injuns used; that’s\nwhat we used ourselves in the airly days of this yer settlement.”",
        "The boys had looked for a rebuke, and here was a helping hand. It all\nturned on the fact that this was “play hours,” Raften left with a\nparting word: “In wan hour an’ a half the pigs is fed.”",
        "“You see Da’s all right when the work ain’t forgot,” said Sam, with\na patronizing air. “I wonder why I didn’t think o’ that there\nLeatherwood meself. I’ve often heard that that’s what was used fur\ntying bags in the old days when cord was scarce, an’ the Injuns used\nit for tying their prisoners, too. Ain’t it the real stuff?”",
        "Several strips were now used for tying four poles together at the top,\nthen these four were raised on end and spread out at the bottom to\nserve as the frame of the teepee, or more properly wigwam, since it\nwas to be made of bark.",
        "After consulting, they now got a long, limber Willow rod an inch\nthick, and bending it around like a hoop, they tied it with\nLeatherwood to each pole at a point four feet from the ground. Next\nthey cut four short poles to reach from the ground to this. These were\nlashed at their upper ends to the Willow rod, and now they were ready\nfor the bark slabs. The boys went to the Elm logs and again Sam’s able\nuse of the axe came in. He cut the bark open along the top of one log,\nand by using the edge of the axe and some wooden wedges they pried off\na great roll eight feet long and four feet across. It was a pleasant\nsurprise to see what a wide piece of bark the small log gave them.",
        "Three logs yielded three fine large slabs and others yielded pieces of\nvarious sizes. The large ones were set up against the frame so as to\nmake the most of them. Of course they were much too big for the top,\nand much too narrow for the bottom; but the little pieces would do to\npatch if some way could be found to make them stick.",
        "Sam suggested nailing them to the posts, and Yan was horrified at the\nidea of using nails. “No Indian has any nails.”",
        "“Well, what would they use?” said Sam.",
        "“They used thongs, an’–an’–maybe wooden pegs. I don’t know, but\nseems to me that would be all right.”",
        "“But them poles is hard wood,” objected the practical Sam. “You can\ndrive Oak pegs into Pine, but you can’t drive wooden pegs into hard\nwood without you make some sort of a hole first. Maybe I’d better\nbring a gimlet.”",
        "“Now, Sam, you might just as well hire a carpenter–thatwouldn’t be Indian at all. Let’s play it right. We’ll find some way. I\nbelieve we can tie them up with Leatherwood.”",
        "So Sam made a sharp Oak pick with his axe, and Yan used it to pick\nholes in each piece of bark and then did a sort of rude sewing till\nthe wigwam seemed beautifully covered in. But when they went inside\nto look they were unpleasantly surprised to find how many holes\nthere were. It was impossible to close them all because the bark was\ncracking in so many places, but the boys plugged the worst of them and\nthen prepared for the great sacred ceremony–the lighting of the fire\nin the middle.",
        "They gathered a lot of dry fuel, then Yan produced a match.",
        "“That don’t look to me very Injun,” drawled Sam critically. “I don’t\nthink Injuns has matches.”",
        "“Well, they don’t,” admitted Yan, humbly. “But I haven’t a flint and\nsteel, and don’t know how to work rubbing-sticks, so we just got to\nuse matches, if we want a fire.”",
        "“Why, of course we want a fire. I ain’t kicking,” said Sam. “Go ahead\nwith your old leg-fire sulphur stick. A camp without a fire would be\n’bout like last year’s bird’s nest or a house with the roof off.”",
        "Yan struck a match and put it to the wood. It went out. He struck\nanother–same result. Yet another went out.",
        "Sam remarked:",
        "“Pears to me you don’t know much about lightin’ a fire. Lemme show\nyou. Let the White hunter learn the Injun somethin’ about the woods,\"\nsaid he with a leer.",
        "Sam took the axe and cut some sticks of a dry Pine root. Then with his\nknife he cut long curling shavings, which he left sticking in a fuzz\nat the end of each stick.",
        "“Oh, I’ve seen a picture of an Indian making them. They call them\n’prayer-sticks,’” said Yan.",
        "“Well, prayer-sticks is mighty good kindlin’” replied the other. He\nstruck a match, and in a minute he had a blazing fire in the middle of\nthe wigwam.",
        "“Old Granny de Neuville, she’s a witch–she knows all about the woods,\nand cracked Jimmy turns everything into poetry what she says. He says\nshe says when you want to make a fire in the woods you take–",
        "  “First a curl of Birch bark as dry as it kin be,\n  Then some twigs of soft-wood, dead, but on the tree,\n  Last o’ all some Pine knots to make the kittle foam,\n  An’ thar’s a fire to make you think you’re settin’ right at home.”",
        "“Who’s Granny de Neuville?”",
        "“Oh, she’s the old witch that lives down at the bend o’ the creek.”",
        "“What? Has she got a granddaughter named Biddy?” said Yan, suddenly\nremembering that his ancient ally came from this part of Sanger.",
        "“Oh, my! Hain’t she? Ain’t Biddy a peach–drinks like a fish, talks\neverybody to death about the time she resided in Bonnerton. Gits a\nletter every mail begging her to come back and ’reside’ with them some\nmore.”",
        "“Ain’t this fine,” said Yan, as he sat on a pile of Fir boughs in the\nwigwam.",
        "“Looks like the real thing,” replied Sam from his seat on the other\nside. “But say, Yan, don’t make any more fire; it’s kind o’ warm here,\nan’ there seems to be something wrong with that flue–wants sweepin’,\nprob’ly–hain’t been swep’ since I kin remember.”",
        "The fire blazed up and the smoke increased. Just a little of it\nwandered out of the smoke-hole at the top, then it decided that this\nwas a mistake and thereafter positively declined to use the vent. Some\nof it went out by chinks, and a large stream issued from the door, but\nby far the best part of it seemed satisfied with the interior of the\nwigwam, so that in a minute or less both boys scrambled out. Their\neyes were streaming with smoke-tears and their discomfiture was\ncomplete.",
        "“’Pears to me,” observed Sam, “like we got them holes mixed. The dooer\nshould ’a ’been at the top, sence the smoke has a fancy for usin’ it,\nan’ then we’d had a chance.”",
        "“The Indians make it work,” said Yan; “a White hunter ought to know\nhow.”",
        "“Now’s the Injun’s chance,” said Sam. “Maybe it wants a dooer to\nclose, then the smoke would have to go out.”",
        "They tried this, and of course some of the smoke was crowded out, but\nnot till long after the boys were.",
        "“Seems like what does get out by the chinks is sucked back agin by\nthat there double-action flue,” said Sam.",
        "It was very disappointing. The romance of sitting by the fire in one’s\nteepee appealed to both of the boys, but the physical torture of\nthe smoke made it unbearable. Their dream was dispelled, and Sam\nsuggested, “Maybe we’d better try a shanty.”",
        "“No,” said Yan, with his usual doggedness. “I know it can be done,\nbecause the Indians do it. We’ll find out in time.”",
        "But all their efforts were in vain. The wigwam was a failure, as far\nas fire was concerned. It was very small and uncomfortable, too; the\nwind blew through a hundred crevices, which grew larger as the Elm\nbark dried and cracked. A heavy shower caught them once, and they were\nrather glad to be driven into their cheerless lodge, but the rain came\nabundantly into the smoke-hole as well as through the walls, and they\nfound it but little protection.",
        "[Illustration: “The wigwam was a failure.\"]",
        "“Seems to me, if anything, a leetle wetter in here than\noutside,” said Sam, as he led in a dash for home.",
        "That night a heavy storm set in, and next day the boys found their\nflimsy wigwam blown down–nothing but a heap of ruins.",
        "Some time after, Raften asked at the table in characteristic stern\nstyle, “Bhoys, what’s doin’ down to yer camp? Is yer wigwam finished?”",
        "“No good,” said Sam. “All blowed down.”",
        "“How’s that?”",
        "“I dunno’. It smoked like everything. We couldn’t stay in it.”",
        "“Couldn’t a-been right made,” said Raften; then with a sudden\ninterest, which showed how eagerly he would have joined in this forty\nyears ago, he said, “Why don’t ye make a rale taypay?”",
        "“Dunno’ how, an’ ain’t got no stuff.”",
        "“Wall, now, yez have been pretty good an’ ain’t slacked on the wurruk,\nyez kin have the ould wagon kiver. Cousin Bert could tache ye how to\nmake it, if he wuz here. Maybe Caleb Clark knows,” he added, with a\nsignificant twinkle of his eye. “Better ask him.” Then he turned to\ngive orders to the hired men, who, of course, ate at the family table.",
        "“Da, do you care if we go to Caleb?”",
        "“I don’t care fwhat ye do wid him,” was the reply.",
        "Raften was no idle talker and Sam knew that, so as soon as “the law\nwas off” he and Yan got out the old wagon cover. It seemed like an\nacre of canvas when they spread it out. Having thus taken possession,\nthey put it away again in the cow-house, their own domain, and Sam\nsaid: “I’ve a great notion to go right to Caleb; he sho’ly knows more\nabout a teepee than any one else here, which ain’t sayin’ much.”",
        "“Who’s Caleb?”",
        "“Oh, he’s the old Billy Goat that shot at Da oncet, just after Da beat\nhim at a horse trade. Let on it was a mistake: ’twas, too, as he\nfound out, coz Da bought up some old notes of his, got ’em cheap, and\nsqueezed him hard to meet them. He’s had hard luck ever since.",
        "“He’s a mortal queer old duck, that Caleb. He knows heaps about the\nwoods, coz he was a hunter an’ trapper oncet. My! wouldn’t he be down\non me if he knowed who was my Da, but he don’t have to know.”",
        "The Sanger Witch",
        "  The Sanger Witch dwelt in the bend of the creek,\n  And neither could read nor write;\n  But she knew in a day what few knew in a week,\n  For hers was the second sight.\n  “Read?” said she, “I am double read;\n  You fools of the ink and pen\n  Count never the eggs, but the sticks of the nest,\n  See the clothes, not the souls of men.”",
        "  –Cracked Jimmy’s Ballad of Sanger.",
        "The boys set out for Caleb’s. It was up the creek away from the camp\nground. As they neared the bend they saw a small log shanty, with some\npoultry and a pig at the door.",
        "“That’s where the witch lives,” said Sam.",
        "“Who–old Granny de Neuville?”",
        "“Yep, and she just loves me. Oh, yes; about the same way an old hen\nloves a Chicken-hawk. ’Pears to me she sets up nights to love me.”",
        "“Why?”",
        "“Oh, I guess it started with the pigs. No, let’s see: first about the\ntrees. Da chopped off a lot of Elm trees that looked terrible nice\nfrom her windy. She’s awful queer about a tree. She hates to see ’em\ncut down, an’ that soured her same as if she owned ’em. Then there\nwuz the pigs. You see, one winter she was awful hard up, an’ she had\ntwo pigs worth, maybe, $5.00 each–anyway, she said they was, an’ she\nought to know, for they lived right in the shanty with her–an’ she\ncome to Da (I guess she had tried every one else first) an’ Da he\nsqueezed her down an’ got the two pigs for $7.00. He al’ays does that.\nThen he comes home an’ says to Ma, ’Seems to me the old lady is\npretty hard put. ’Bout next Saturday you take two sacks of flour and\nsome pork an’ potatoes around an’ see that she is fixed up right.’\nDa’s al’ays doin’ them things, too, on the quiet. So Ma goes with\nabout $15.00 worth o’ truck. The old witch was kinder ’stand off.’\nShe didn’t say much. Ma was goin’ slow, not knowin’ just whether to\ngive the stuff out an’ out, or say it could be worked for next year,\nor some other year, when there was two moons, or some time when the\nwork was all done. Well, the old witch said mighty little until the\nstuff was all put in the cellar, then she grabs up a big stick an’\nbreaks out at Ma:",
        "“’Now you git out o’ my house, you dhirty, sthuck-up thing. I ain’t\ntakin’ no charity from the likes o’ you. That thing you call your\nhusband robbed me o’ my pigs, an’ we ain’t any more’n square now, so\ngit out an’ don’t you dar set fut in my house agin’.",
        "“Well, she was sore on us when Da bought her pigs, but she was five\ntimes wuss after she clinched the groceries. ’Pears like they soured\non her stummick.”",
        "“What a shame, the old wretch,” said Yan, with ready sympathy for the\nRaftens.",
        "“No,” replied Sam; “she’s only queer. There’s lots o’ folk takes her\nside. But she’s awful queer. She won’t have a tree cut if she can help\nit, an’ when the flowers come in the spring she goes out in the woods\nand sets down beside ’em for hours an’ calls ’em ’Me beauty–me little\nbeauty,’ an’ she just loves the birds. When the boys want to rile her\nthey get a sling-shot an’ shoot the birds in her garden an’ she just\ngoes crazy. She pretty near starves herself every winter trying to\nfeed all the birds that come around. She has lots of ’em to feed right\nout o’ her hand. Da says they think its an old pine root, but she has\na way o’ coaxin’ ’em that’s awful nice. There she’ll stand in freezin’\nweather calling them ’Me beauties’.",
        "“You see that little windy in the end?” he continued, as they came\nclose to the witch’s hut. “Well, that’s the loft, an’ it’s full o’ all\nsorts o’ plants an’ roots.”",
        "“What for?”",
        "“Oh, for medicine. She’s great on hairbs.”",
        "“Oh, yes, I remember now Biddy did say that her Granny was a herb\ndoctor.”",
        "“Doctor? She ain’t much of a doctor, but I bet she knows every plant\nthat grows in the woods, an’ they’re sure strong after they’ve been up\nthere for a year, with the cat sleepin’ on them.”",
        "“I wish I could go and see her.”",
        "“Guess we can,” was the reply.",
        "“Doesn’t she know you?”",
        "“Yes, but watch me fix her,” drawled Sam. “There ain’t nothin’ she\nlikes better’n a sick pusson.”",
        "Sam stopped now, rolled up his sleeves and examined both arms,\napparently without success, for he then loosed his suspenders, dropped\nhis pants, and proceeded to examine his legs. Of course, all boys\nhave more or less cuts and bruises in various stages of healing. Sam\nselected his best, just below the knee, a scratch from a nail in the\nfence. He had never given it a thought before, but now he “reckoned\nit would do.” With a lead pencil borrowed from Yan he spread a hue\nof mortification all around it, a green butternut rind added the\nunpleasant yellowish-brown of human decomposition, and the result\nwas a frightful looking plague spot. By chewing some grass he made a\nyellowish-green dye and expectorated this on the handkerchief which he\nbound on the sore. He then got a stick and proceeded to limp painfully\ntoward the witch’s abode. As they drew near, the partly open door was\nslammed with ominous force. Sam, quite unabashed, looked at Yan and\nwinked, then knocked. The bark of a small dog answered. He knocked\nagain. A sound now of some one moving within, but no answer. A third\ntime he knocked, then a shrill voice: “Get out o’ that. Get aff my\nplace, you dirthy young riff-raff.”",
        "Sam grinned at Yan. Then drawling a little more than usual, he said:",
        "“It’s a poor boy, Granny. The doctors can’t do nothin’ for him,” which\nlast, at least, was quite true.",
        "There was no reply, so Sam made bold to open the door. There sat the\nold woman glowering with angry red eyes across the stove, a cat in her\nlap, a pipe in her mouth, and a dog growling toward the strangers.",
        "“Ain’t you Sam Raften?” she asked fiercely.",
        "“Yes, marm. I get hurt on a nail in the fence. They say you kin git\nblood-p’isinin’ that way,” said Sam, groaning a little and trying to\nlook interesting. The order to “get out” died on the witch’s lips. Her\ngood old Irish heart warmed to the sufferer. After all, it was rather\npleasant to have the enemy thus humbly seek her aid, so she muttered:",
        "“Le’s see it.”",
        "Sam was trying amid many groans to expose the disgusting mess he had\nmade around his knee, when a step was heard outside. The door opened\nand in walked Biddy.",
        "She and Yan recognized each other at once. The one had grown much\nlonger, the other much broader since the last meeting, but the\ngreeting was that of two warm-hearted people glad to see each other\nonce more.",
        "“An’ how’s yer father an’ yer mother an’ how is all the fambily? Law,\ndo ye mind the Cherry Lung-balm we uster make? My, but we wuz greenies\nthen! Ye mind, I uster tell ye about Granny? Well, here she is.\nGranny, this is Yan. Me an’ him hed lots o’ fun together when I\n’resided’ with his mamma, didn’t we, Yan? Now, Granny’s the one to\ntell ye all about the plants.”",
        "A long groan from Sam now called all attention his way.",
        "“Well, if it ain’t Sam Raften,” said Biddy coldly.",
        "“Yes, an’ he’s deathly sick,” added Granny. “Their own docther guv him\nup an said mortal man couldn’t save him nohow, so he jest hed to come\nto me.”",
        "Another long groan was ample indorsement.",
        "“Le’s see. Gimme my scissors, Biddy; I’ll hev to cut the pant leg\naff.”",
        "“No, no,” Sam blurted out with sudden vigour, dreading the\nconsequences at home. “I kin roll it up.”",
        "“Thayer, thot’ll do. Now I say,” said the witch. “Yes, sure enough,\nthayer is proud flesh. I moight cut it out,” said she, fumbling\nin her pocket (Sam supposed for a knife, and made ready to dash for\nthe door), “but le’s see, no–that would be a fool docther trick. I\nkin git on without.”",
        "“Yes, sure,” said Sam, clutching at the idea, “that’s just what a fool\ndoctor would do, but you kin give me something to take that’s far\nbetter.”",
        "“Well, sure an’ I kin,” and Yan and Sam breathed more freely.\n\"Shwaller this, now,” and she offered him a tin cup of water into\nwhich she spilled some powder of dry leaves. Sam did so. “An’ you\ntake this yer bundle and bile it in two gallons of wather and drink a\nglassful ivery hour, an’ hev a loive chicken sphlit with an axe an’\nlaid hot on the place twicet ivery day, till the proud flesh goes, an’\nit’ll be all right wid ye–a fresh chicken ivery toime, moind ye.”",
        "“Wouldn’t–turkeys–do–better?” groaned Sam, feebly. “I’m me mother’s\npet, Granny, an’ expense ain’t any objek\"–a snort that may have meant\nmortal agony escaped him.",
        "“Niver moind, now. Sure we won’t talk of yer father an’ mother;\nthey’re punished pretty bad already. Hiven forbid they don’t lose\nthe rest o’ ye fur their sins. It ain’t meself that ’ud bear ony\nill-will.”",
        "A long groan cut short what looked like a young sermon.",
        "“What’s the plant, Granny?” asked Yan, carefully avoiding Sam’s gaze.",
        "“Shure, an’ it grows in the woods.”",
        "“Yes, but I want to know what it’s like and what it’s called.”",
        "“Shure, ’tain’t like nothin’ else. It’s just like itself, an’ it’s\ncalled Witch-hazel.",
        "  “’Witch-hazel blossoms in the faal,\n  To cure the chills and Fayvers aall,’",
        "“as cracked Jimmy says.”",
        "“I’ll show you some av it sometime,” said Biddy.",
        "“Can it be made into Lung-balm?” asked Yan, mischievously.",
        "“I guess we’ll have to go now,” Sam feebly put in. “I’m feeling much\nbetter. Where’s my stick? Here, Yan, you kin carry my medicine, an’\nbe very keerful of it.”",
        "Yan took the bundle, not daring to look Sam in the face.",
        "Granny bade them both come back again, and followed to the door with a\nhearty farewell. At the same moment she said:",
        "“Howld on!” Then she went to the one bed in the room, which also was\nthe house, turned down the clothes, and in the middle exposed a lot of\nrosy apples. She picked out two of the best and gave one to each of\nthe boys.",
        "“Shure, Oi hev to hoide them thayer fram the pig, for they’re the\nfoinest iver grew.”",
        "“I know they are,” whispered Sam, as he limped out of hearing, “for\nher son Larry stole them out of our orchard last fall. They’re the\nonly kind that keeps over. They’re the best that grow, but a trifle\ntoo warm just now.”",
        "“Good-by, and thank you much,” said Yan.",
        "“I-feel-better-already,” drawled Sam. “That tired feeling has left me,\nan’ sense tryin’ your remedy I have took no other,” but added aside,\n\"I wish I could throw up the stuff before it pisens me,” and then,\nwith a keen eye to the picturesque effect, he wanted to fling his\nstick away and bound into the woods.",
        "It was all Yan could do to make him observe some of the decencies\nand limp a little till out of sight. As it was, the change was quite\nmarked and the genial old witch called loudly on Biddy to see with\nher own eyes how quickly she had helped young Raften “afther all the\ndochters in the country hed giv him up.”",
        "“Now for Caleb Clark, Esq., Q.C.,” said Sam.",
        "“Q.C.?” inquired his friend.",
        "“Some consider it means Queen’s Counsel, an’ some claims as it stands\nfor Queer Cuss. One or other maybe is right.”",
        "“You’re stepping wonderfully for a crippled boy the doctors have given\nup,” remarked Yan.",
        "“Yes; that’s the proud flesh in me right leg that’s doin’ the high\nsteppin’. The left one is jest plain laig.”",
        "“Let’s hide this somewhere till we get back,” and Yan held up the\nbundle of Witch-hazel.",
        "“I’ll hide that,” said Sam, and he hurled the bundle afar into the\ncreek.",
        "“Oh, Sam, that’s mean. Maybe she wants it herself.”",
        "“Pooh, that’s all the old brush is good for. I done more’n me duty\nwhen I drank that swill. I could fairly taste the cat in it.”",
        "“What’ll you tell her next time?”",
        "“Well, I’ll tell her I put the sticks in the right place an’ where\nthey done the most good. I soaked ’em in water an’ took as much as I\nwanted of the flooid.",
        "“She’ll see for herself I really did pull through, and will be a\nblamed sight happier than if I drank her old pisen brushwood an’ had\nto send for a really truly doctor.”",
        "Yan was silenced, but not satisfied. It seemed discourteous to throw\nthe sticks away–so soon, anyway; besides, he had curiosity to know\njust what they were and how they acted.",
        "Caleb",
        "A mile farther was the shanty of Caleb Clark, a mere squatter now on a\nfarm once his own. As the boys drew near, a tall, round-shouldered man\nwith a long white beard was seen carrying in an armful of wood.",
        "“Ye see the Billy Goat?” said Sam.",
        "Yan sniffed as he gasped the “why” of the nickname.",
        "“I guess you better do the talking; Caleb ain’t so easy handled as the\nwitch, and he’s just as sour on Da.”",
        "So Yan went forward rather cautiously and knocked at the open door of\nthe shanty. A deep-voiced Dog broke into a loud bay, the long beard\nappeared, and its owner said, “Wall?”",
        "“Are you Mr. Clark?”",
        "“Yep.” Then, “Lie down, Turk,” to a black-and-tan Hound that came\ngrowling out.",
        "“I came–I–we wanted to ask some questions–if you don’t mind.”",
        "“What might yer name be?”",
        "“Yan.”",
        "“An’ who is this?”",
        "“He’s my chum, Sam.”",
        "“I’m Sam Horn,” said Sam, with some truth, for he was Samuel\nHorn Raften, but with sufficient deception to make Yan feel very\nuncomfortable.",
        "“And where are ye from?”",
        "“Bonnerton,” said Yan.",
        "“To-day?” was the rejoinder, with a tone of doubt.",
        "“Well, no,” Yan began; but Sam, who had tried to keep out of notice\nfor fear of recognition, saw that his ingenuous companion was being\nquickly pumped and placed, and now interposed: “You see, Mr. Clark, we\nare camped in the woods and we want to make a teepee to live in. We\nhave the stuff an’ was told that you knew all about the making.”",
        "“Who told ye?”",
        "“The old witch at the bend of the creek.”",
        "“Where are ye livin’ now?”",
        "“Well,” said Sam, hastening again to forestall Yan, whose simple\ndirectness he feared, “to tell the truth, we made a wigwam of bark in\nthe woods below here, but it wasn’t a success.”",
        "“Whose woods?”",
        "“Oh, about a mile below on the creek.”",
        "“Hm! That must be Raften’s or Burns’s woods.”",
        "“I guess it is,” said Sam.",
        "“_An’ you look uncommon like Sam Raften. You consarned young\nwhelp, to come here lyin’ an’ tryin’ to pull the wool over my eyes.\nGet out o’ this now, or I’ll boot ye.”",
        "[Illustration: “Get out o’ this now, or I’ll boot ye.\"]",
        "Yan turned very red. He thought of the scripture text, “Be sure your\nsin will find you out,” and he stepped back. Sam stuck his tongue in\nhis cheek and followed. But he was his father’s son. He turned and\nsaid:",
        "“Now see here, Mr. Clark, fair and square; we come here to ask a\nsimple question about the woods. You are the only man that knows or we\nwouldn’t ’a’ bothered you. I knowed you had it in for Da, so I tried\nto fool you, and it didn’t go. I wish now I had just come out square\nand said, ’I’m Sam Raften; will you tell me somethin’ I want to know,\nor won’t you?’ I didn’t know you hed anything agin me or me friend\nthat’s camping with me.”",
        "There is a strong bond of sympathy between all Woodcrafters. The mere\nfact that a man wants to go his way is a claim on a Woodcrafter’s\nnotice. Old Caleb, though soured by trouble and hot-tempered, had a\nkind heart; he resisted for a moment the first impulse to slam the\ndoor in their faces; then as he listened he fell into the tempter’s\nsnare, for it was baited with the subtlest of flatteries.

        "And Sam remarked: “I see now why Da said we could have it. I reckon\nwe’ll have to patch it before we cut out the teepee.”",
        "“No,” said Yan, assuming control, as he was apt to do in matters\npertaining to the woods; “we better draw our plans first so as not to\npatch any part that’s going to be cut off afterward.”",
        "“Great head! But I’m afraid them patches won’t be awful ornamental.”",

        "“Look out,” said Sam; “that’s my festered knee. It’s near as bad\nto-day as it was when we called on the witch.”",
        "Yan was measuring. “Let’s see. We can cut off all those rags and still\nmake a twelve-foot teepee. Twelve foot high–that will be twenty-four\nfeet across the bottom of the stuff. Fine! That’s just the thing. Now\nI’ll mark her off.”",
        "“Hold on, there,” protested his friend; “you can’t do that with chalk.\nCaleb said the Injuns used a burnt stick. You hain’t got no right to\nuse chalk. ’You might as well hire a carpenter.’”",

        "Pack-thread, needles and very l-o-n-g stitches were used, but\nthe work went slowly on. All the spare time of one day was given to\npatching. Sam, of course, kept up a patter of characteristic remarks\nto the piece he was sewing. Yan sewed in serious silence.

        "As the boys went down the road by the outer fence of their own orchard\na Hawk came sailing over, silencing as he came the singing within a\ngiven radius. Many of the singers hid, but a Meadow Lark that had been\nwhistling on a stake in the open was now vainly seeking shelter in the\nbroad field. The Hawk was speeding his way. The Lark dodged and put on\nall power to reach the orchard, but the Hawk was after him now–was\ngaining–in another moment would, have clutched the terrified\nmusician, but out of the Apple trees there dashed a small\nblack-and-white bird–the Kingbird. With a loud harsh twitter–his\nwar-cry–repeated again and again, with his little gray head-feathers\nraised to show the blood-and-flame-coloured undercrest–his war\ncolours–he darted straight at the great robber.",
        "“Clicker-a-clicker,” he fairly screamed, and made for the huge Hawk,\nten times his size.",
        "“Clicker-a-clicker!” he shrieked, like a cateran shouting the\n\"slogan,” and down like a black-and-white dart–to strike the Hawk\nfairly between the shoulders just as the Meadow Lark dropped in\ndespair to the bare ground and hid its head from the approaching\nstroke of death.",
        "“Clicker-a-clicker\"–and the Hawk wheeled in sudden consternation.\n\"Clicker-a-clicker\"–and the dauntless little warrior dropped between\nhis wings, stabbing and tearing.",
        "The Hawk bucked like a mustang, the Kingbird was thrown, but sprung on\nagile pinions above again.",
        "“Clicker-a-clicker,” and he struck as before. Large brown feathers\nwere floating away on the breeze now. The Meadow Lark was forgotten.\nThe Hawk thought only of escape.",
        "“Clicker-a-clicker,” the slogan still was heard. The Hawk was putting\non all speed to get away, but the Kingbird was riding him most of the\ntime. Several brown feathers floated down, the Hawk dwindled in the\ndistance to a Sparrow and the Kingbird to a fly dancing on his back.\nThe Hawk made a final plunge into a thicket, and the king came home\nagain, uttering the shrill war-cry once or twice, probably to let the\nqueen know that he was coming back, for she flew to a high branch of\nthe Apple tree where she could greet the returning hero. He came with\nan occasional “clicker-a-clicker\"–then, when near her, he sprung\nfifty feet in the air and dashed down, screaming his slogan without\ninterruption, darting zigzag with the most surprising evolutions and\nturns–this way, that way, sideways and downward, dealing the\ndeadliest blows right and left at an imaginary foe, then soared, and\ndid it all over again two or three times, just to show how far he was\nfrom being tired, and how much better he could have done it had it\nbeen necessary. Then with a final swoop and a volley of “clickers” he\ndashed into the bush to receive the congratulations of the one for\nwhom it all was meant and the only spectator for whose opinion he\ncared in the least.",

        "“Oh, ain’t that awful nice?” and Yan was dumb with a sort of saddened\njoy.",
        "Birds hate the wind, and this was one of those birdy days that come\nonly with a dead calm.",
        "They passed a barn with two hundred pairs of Swallows flying and\ntwittering around, a cut bank of the road had a colony of 1,000 Sand\nMartins, a stream had its rattling Kingfishers, and a marsh was the\nplayground of a multitude of Red-winged Blackbirds.",
        "Yan was lifted up with the joy of the naturalist at seeing so many\nbeautiful living things. Sam felt it, too; he grew very silent, and\nthe last half-mile to the “Corner” was passed without a word. The\nboots were got. Sam swung them around his neck and the boys set out\nfor home. The sun was gone, but not the birds, and the spell of the\nevening was on them still. A Song Sparrow by the brook and a Robin\nhigh in the Elm were yet pouring out their liquid notes in the\ngloaming.",
        "“I wish I could be always here,” said Yan, but he started a little\nwhen he remembered how unwilling he had been to come.",
        "There was a long silence as they lingered on the darkening road. Each\nwas thinking hard.",
        "A loud, startling but soft “Ohoo–O-hoo–O-hoooooo,” like the coo of a\ngiant dove, now sounded about their heads in a tree. They stopped and\nSam whispered, “Owl; big Hoot Owl.” Yan’s heart leaped with pleasure.\nHe had read all his life of Owls, and even had seen them alive in\ncages, but this was the first time he had ever heard the famous\nhooting of the real live wild Owl, and it was a delicious experience.",
        "The night was quite dark now, but there were plenty of sounds that\ntold of life. A Whippoorwill was chanting in the woods, a hundred\nToads and Frogs creaked and trilled, a strange rolling, laughing cry\non a marshy pond puzzled them both, then a Song Sparrow in the black\nnight of a dense thicket poured forth its sweet little sunshine song\nwith all the vigour and joy of its best daytime doing.",
        "They listened attentively for a repetition of the serenade, when a\nhigh-pitched but not loud ’Wa–wa–wa–wa–wa–wa–wa–wa!\"\nreached their ears from a grove of heavy timbers.",
        "“Hear that?” exclaimed Sam.",
        "Again it came, a quavering squall, apparently much nearer. It was a\nrather shrill sound, quite unbirdy, and Sam whispered:",
        "“Coon–that’s the whicker of a Coon. We can come down here some time\nwhen corn’s ’in roastin’’ an’ have a Coon hunt.”",
        "“Oh, Sam, wouldn’t that be glorious!” said Yan. “How I wish it was\nnow. I never saw a Coon hunt or any kind of a hunt. Do we have to wait\ntill ’roasting-ear’ time?”",
        "“Oh, yes; it’s easier to find them then. You say to your Coons, ’Me\nan’ me dogs will meet you to-night at the nearest roastin’-ear patch,’\nan’ sure nuff they’ll keep the appointment.”",
        "“But they’re around now, for we just heard one, and there’s\nanother.”",
        "A long faint ’Lil–lil–lil–lil–lil–li-looo!_” now sounded\nfrom the trees. It was like the other, but much softer and sweeter.",
        "“There’s where you fool yerself,” replied Sam, “an’ there’s where many\na hunter is fooled. That last one’s the call of a Screech Owl. You see\nit’s softer and whistlier than the Coon whicker.”",
        "They heard it again and again from the trees. It was a sweet musical\nsound, and Yan remembered how squally the Coon call was in comparison,\nand yet many hunters never learn the difference.",
        "As they came near the tree whence the Owl called at intervals, a gray\nblot went over their heads, shutting out a handful of stars for a\nmoment as it passed over them, but making no noise. “There he goes,\"\nwhispered Sam. “That’s the Screech Owl. Not much of a screech, was\nit?” Not long afterward Yan came across a line of Lowell’s which says,\n\"The song of the Screech Owl is the sweetest sound in nature,” and\nappreciated the absurdity of the name.",
        "“I want to go on a Coon hunt,” continued Yan, and the sentence was\njust tinged with the deep-laid doggedness that was usually lost in his\ncourteous manner.",
        "“That settles it,” answered the other, for he was learning what that\ntone meant. “We’ll surely go when you talk that way, for, of coorse,\nit kin be done. You see, I know more about animals than birds,\"\nhe continued. “I’m just as likely to be a dentist as a hunter so far\nas serious business is concerned, but I’d sure love to be a hunter for\nawhile, an’ I made Da promise to go with me some time. Maybe we kin\nget a Deer by going back ten miles to the Long Swamp. I only wish Da\nand Old Caleb hadn’t fought, ’cause Caleb sure knows the woods, an’\nthat old Hound of his has treed more Coons than ye could shake a stick\nat in a month o’ Sundays.”",
        "“Well, if that’s the only Coon dog around, I’m going to get him.\nYou’ll see,” was the reply.",
        "“I believe you will,” answered Sam, in a tone of mixed admiration and\namusement.",
        "It was ten o’clock when they got home, and every one was in bed but\nMr. Raften. The boys turned in at once, but next morning, on going\nto the barn, they found that Si had not only sewed on and hemmed the\nsmoke-flaps, but had resewn the worst of the patches and hemmed the\nwhole bottom of the teepee cover with a small rope in the hem, so that\nthey were ready now for the pins and poles.",
        "The cover was taken at once to the camp ground. Yan carried the axe.\nWhen they came to the brush fence over the creek at the edge of the\nswamp, he said:",
        "“Sam, I want to blaze that trail for old Caleb. How do you do it?”",
        "“Spot the trees with the axe every few yards.”",
        "“This way?” and Yan cut a tree in three places, so as to show three\nwhite spots or blazes.",
        "“No; that’s a trapper’s blaze for a trap or a ’special blaze’, but\na ’road blaze’ is one on the front of the tree and one on the\nback–so–then ye can run the trail both ways, an’ you put them\nthicker if it’s to be followed at night.”",
        "The Sacred Fire",
        "“Ten strong poles and two long thin ones,” said Yan, reading off. These\nwere soon cut and brought to the camp ground.",
        "“Tie them together the same height as the teepee cover––”",
        "“Tie them? With what?”",
        "“’Rawhide rope,’ he said, but he also said ’Make the cover of skins.’\nI’m afraid we shall have to use common rope for the present,” and Yan\nlooked a little ashamed of the admission.",
        "“I reckoned so,” drawled Sam, “and so I put a coil of quarter-inch in\nthe cover, but I didn’t dare to tell you that up at the barn.”",
        "The tripod was firmly lashed with the rope and set up. Nine poles were\nduly leaned around in a twelve-foot circle, for a teepee twelve feet\nhigh usually has a twelve-foot base. A final lashing of the ropes held\nthese, and the last pole was then put up opposite to the door, with\nthe teepee cover tied to it at the point between the flaps. The ends\nof the two smoke-poles carried the cover round. Then the lacing-pins\nwere needed. Yan tried to make them of Hickory shoots, but the large,\nsoft pith came just where the point was needed. So Sam said, “You\ncan’t beat White Oak for pins.” He cut a block of White Oak, split it\ndown the middle, then split half of it in the middle again, and so on\ntill it was small enough to trim and finish with his knife. Meanwhile\nYan took the axe to split another, but found that it ran off to one\nside instead of going straight down the grain.",
        "“No good,” was Sam’s comment. “You must keep halving each time\nor it will run out toward the thin pieces. You want to split shingles\nall winter to larn that.”",
        "Ten pins were made eight inches long and a quarter of an inch thick.\nThey were used just like dressmakers’ stickpins, only the holes had to\nbe made first, and, of course, they looked better for being regular.\nThus the cover was laced on. The lack of ground-pegs was then seen.",
        "“You make ten Oak pins a foot long and an inch square, Sam. I’ve a\nnotion how to fix them.” Then Yan cut ten pieces of the rope, each two\nfeet long, and made a hole about every three feet around the base of\nthe cover above the rope in the outer seam. He passed one end of each\nshort rope through this and knotted it to the other end. Thus he had\nten peg-loops, and the teepee was fastened down and looked like a\nglorious success.",
        "Now came the grand ceremony of all, the lighting of the first fire.\nThe boys felt it to be a supreme and almost a religious moment. It is\ncurious to note that they felt very much as savages do under the same\ncircumstances–that the setting up of the new teepee and lighting its\nfirst fire is an act of deep significance, and to be done only with\nproper regard for its future good luck.",
        "“Better go slow and sure about that fire. It’d be awfully unlucky to\nhave it fizzle for the first time.”",
        "“That’s so,” replied Yan, with the same sort of superstitious dread.\n\"Say, Sam, if we could really light it with rubbing-sticks, wouldn’t\nit be great?”",
        "“Hallo!”",
        "The boys turned, and there was Caleb close to them. He came over and\nnodded. “Got yer teepee, I see? Not bad, but what did ye face her to\nthe west fur?”",
        "“Fronting the creek,” explained Yan.",
        "“I forgot to tell ye,” said Caleb, “an Injun teepee always fronts the\neast; first, that gives the morning sun inside; next, the most wind is\nfrom the west, so the smoke is bound to draw.”",
        "“And what if the wind is right due east?” asked Sam, “which it surely\nwill be when it rains?”",
        "“And when the wind’s east,” continued Caleb, addressing no one in\nparticular, and not as though in answer to a question, “ye lap the\nflaps across each other tight in front, so,” and he crossed his hands\nover his chest. “That leaves the east side high and shuts out the\nrain; if it don’t draw then, ye raise the bottom of the cover under\nthe door just a little–that always fetches her. An’ when you change\nher round don’t put her in under them trees. Trees is dangerous; in a\nstorm they draw lightning, an’ branches fall from them, an’ after rain\nthey keep on dripping for an hour. Ye need all the sun ye kin get on a\nteepee.",
        "“Did you ever see Indians bring fire out of two sticks by rubbing, Mr.\nClark?”",
        "“Oh, yes. Most of the Injuns now carry matches, but in the early days\nI seen it done often enough.”",
        "“Does it take long? Is it hard?”",
        "“Not so long, and it’s easy enough, when ye know how.”",
        "“My! I’d rather bring fire out of two sticks than have a ten dollar\nbill,” said Yan, with enthusiasm that meant much, for one dollar was\nhis high-water mark of affluence, and this he had reached but once in\nhis life.",
        "“Oh, I dunno’; that depends,” was Sam’s more guarded response.",
        "“Can you do it?” asked Yan.",
        "“Wall, yes, if I kin get the right stuff. Ye see, it ain’t every wood\nthat will do it. It’s got to be jest right. The Plains Injuns use\nCottonwood root, an’ the Mountain Injuns use Sage-brush root. I’ve\nseen the Canadian Injuns use Basswood, Cedar and dry White Pine,\nbut the Chippewas mostly use Balsam Fir. The easiest way is with a\nbow-drill. Have ye any buckskin?”",
        "“No.”",
        "“Or a strip o’ soft leather?”",
        "“I’ve got a leather shoe-lace,” said Yan.",
        "“Rather slim; but we’ll double it an’ make it do. A cord will answer,\nbut it frays out so soon.” Caleb took the lace and the axe, then said,\n\"Find me a stone ’bout the size of an egg, with a little hole into\nit–like a socket hole–’bout a quarter inch deep.”",
        "The boys went to the creek to seek a stone and Caleb went into the\nwoods.",
        "They heard him chopping, and presently he came back with a flat piece\nof very dry Balsam Fir, a fifteen-inch pin of the same, a stick about\nthree feet long, slightly bent, some dry Pine punk and some dry Cedar.",
        "The pin was three-quarters of an inch thick and was roughly\neight-sided, “so the lace would grip.” It was pointed at both ends. He\nfastened the lace to the bent stick like a bow-string, but loosely, so\nthat when it had one turn around the pin it was quite tight. The flat\npiece of Balsam he trimmed down to about half an inch thick. In the\nedge of this he now cut a notch one-quarter inch wide and half an inch\ndeep, then on the top of this fire-board or block, just beyond the\nnotch, he made with the point of his knife a little pit.",
        "He next scraped and shredded a lot of dry Cedar wood like lint. Then\nmaking a hole half an inch deep in the ground, he laid in that a flat\npiece of Pine punk, and across this he set the fire-board. The point\nof the pin or drill was put in the pit of the fire-board, which he\nheld down with one foot; the lace was given one turn on the pin, and\nits top went into the hole of the stone the boys brought. The stone\nwas held firmly in Caleb’s left hand.",
        "“Sometimes,” he remarked, “when ye can’t find a stone, a Pine knot\nwill do–ye kin make the socket-hole with a knife-point.”",
        "Now holding the bow in his right hand, he began to draw it back and\nforth with long, steady strokes, causing the pin to whirl round in the\nsocket. Within a few seconds a brown powder began to run out of the\nnotch of the fire-board onto the punk. The pit increased in size and\nblackened, the powder darkened, and a slight smoke arose from the pit.\nCaleb increased the pressure of his left hand a little, and sawed\nfaster with the right. The smoke steadily increased and the black\npowder began to fill the notch. The smoke was rolling in little clouds\nfrom under the pin, and it even seemed to come from the heap of\npowder. As soon as he saw that, Caleb dropped the bow and gently\nfanned the powder heap. It still smoked. He removed the fire-board,\nand lifting the punk, showed the interior of the powder to be one\nglowing coal. On this he laid the Cedar tinder and over that a second\npiece of punk. Then raising it, he waved it in the air and blew gently\nfor awhile. It smouldered and then burst into a flame. The other\nmaterial was handy, and in a very short time they had a blazing fire\nin the middle of the new teepee.",

        "All three were pictures of childish delight. The old man’s face fairly\nbeamed with triumph. Had he failed in his experiment he would have\ngone off hating those boys, but having made a brilliant success he was\nready to love every one concerned, though they had been nothing more\nthan interested spectators of his exploit.",
        "[Illustration: RUBBING-STICKS–FOR FIRE-MAKING (See Description Below)]",
        "Two tools and two sticks are needed. The tools are bow and\ndrill-socket; the sticks are drill and fire-board.",
        "1. The simplest kind of bow–a bent stick with a stout leather thong\nfastened at each end. The stick must not spring. It is about 27 inches\nlong and 5/8 inch thick.",
        "2. A more elaborate bow with a hole at each end for the thong. At the\nhandle end it goes through a disc of wood. This is to tighten the\nthong by pressure of the hand against the disc while using.",
        "3. Simplest kind of drill-socket–a pine or hemlock knot with a\nshallow hole or pit in it. 3a is under view of same. It is\nabout 4-1/2 inches long.",
        "4. A more elaborate drill-socket–a pebble cemented with gum in a\nwooden holder. 4a is under view of same.",
        "5. A very elaborate drill-socket; it is made of tulip wood, carved to\nrepresent the Thunderbird. It has eyes of green felspar cemented in\nwith resin. On the under side (_5a_) is seen, in the middle, a\nsoapstone socket let into the wood and fastened with pine gum, and\non the head a hole kept filled with grease, to grease the top of the\ndrill before use.",
        "6. The drill, 12 to 18 inches long and about 3/4 of an inch thick; it\nis roughly 8-sided so the thong will not slip, pointed at each end.\nThe best wood for the drill is old, dry, brash, but not punky balsam\nfir or cotton-wood roots; but basswood, white cedar, red cedar,\ntamarack, and sometimes even white pine, will do.",
        "7. Fire-board or block, about 3/4 of an inch thick and any length\nhandy; a is notch with pit just below shows the pit after once\nusing and in good trim for a second time; c shows the pit bored\nthrough and useless; the notch is 1/2 inch wide and 3/4 inch deep.",
        "8. Shows the way of using the sticks. The block (_a_) is held\ndown with one foot, the end of the drill in the pit, the drill-socket\n(_c_) is held on top in left hand, one end of the bow (_d_)\nis held in the right hand the bow is drawn back and forth.",
        "9. Is a little wooden fire-pan, not essential but convenient; its thin\nedge is put under the notch to catch the powder that falls.",
        "The Bows and Arrows",
        "“I don’t think much of your artillery,” said Yan one day as they were\nshooting in the orchard with Sam’s “Western outfit.” “It’s about like\nthe first one I made when I was young.”",
        "“Well, grandpa, let’s see your up-to-date make?”",
        "“It’d be about five times as strong, for one thing.”",
        "“You couldn’t pull it.”",
        "“Not the way you hold the arrow! But last winter I got a book about\narchery from the library and learned something worth while. You pinch\nthe arrow that way and you can draw six or eight pounds, maybe, but\nyou hook your fingers in the string–so–and you can draw five times\nas much, and that’s the right way to shoot.”",
        "“Feels mighty clumsy,” said Sam, trying it.",
        "“Of course it does at first, and you have to have a deep notch in the\narrow or you can’t do it at all.”",
        "“You don’t seem to manage any better than I do.”",
        "“First time I ever had a chance to try since I read about it. But I\nwant to make a first-class bow and a lot of arrows. It’s not much good\ngoing with one.”",
        "[Illustration: The Archer’s Grip]",
        "“Well, go ahead an’ make an outfit if you know how. What’s the best\nwood? Did the book tell you that?”",
        "“The best wood is Spanish Yew.”",
        "“Don’t know it.”",
        "“An’ the next is Oregon Yew.”",
        "“Nope.”",
        "“Then Lancewood and Osage Orange.”",
        "’Try again.”",
        "“Well, Red Cedar, Apple tree, Hickory and Elm seem to be the only ones\nthat grow around here.”",
        "“Hain’t seen any Red Cedar, but the rest is easy.”",
        "“It has to be thoroughly seasoned winter-cut wood, and cut so as to\nhave heart on one side and sap wood on the other.”",
        "“How’s that?” and Sam pointed to a lot of half-round Hickory sticks\non the rafters of the log house. “Those have been there a couple of\nyears.”",
        "A good one of five feet long was selected and split and hewn with the\naxe till the boys had the two bow staves, five and one-half feet long\nand two inches square, with the line of the heart and sap wood down\nthe middle of each.",
        "Guided by his memory of that precious book and some English long bows\nthat he had seen in a shop in town, Yan superintended the manufacture.\nSam was apt with tools, and in time they finished two bows, five feet\nlong and drawing possibly twenty-five pounds each. In the middle they\nwere one and one-half inches wide and an inch thick (see page 183).\nThis size they kept for nine inches each way, making an eighteen-inch\nmiddle part that did not bend, but their two limbs were shaved down\nand scraped with glass till they bent evenly and were well within the\nboys’ strength.",
        "The string was the next difficulty. All the ordinary string they could\nget around the house proved too weak, never lasting more than two\nor three shots, till Si Lee, seeing their trouble, sent them to the\ncobbler’s for a hank of unbleached linen thread and some shoemaker’s\nwax. Of this thread he reeled enough for a strong cord tight around\ntwo pegs seven feet apart, then cutting it loose at one end he divided\nit equally in three parts, and, after slight waxing, he loosely\nplaited them together. At Yan’s suggestion he then spliced a loop at\none end, and with a fine waxed thread lashed six inches of the middle\nwhere the arrow fitted, as well as the splice of the loop. This last\nenabled them to unstring the bow when not in use (see page 183).\n\"There,” said he, “you won’t break that.” The finishing touch was\nthinly coating the bows with some varnish found among the paint\nsupplies.",
        "“Makes my old bow look purty sick,” remarked Sam, as he held up the\nreally fine new weapon in contrast with the wretched little hoop that\nhad embodied his early ideas. “Now what do you know about arrers,\nmister?” as he tried his old arrow in the new bow.",
        "“I know that that’s no good,” was the reply; “an’ I can tell you that\nit’s a deal harder to make an arrow than a bow–that is, a good one.”",
        "“That’s encouraging, considering the trouble we’ve had already.”",
        "“’Tisn’t meant to be, but we ought to have a dozen arrows each.”",
        "“How do the Injuns make them?”",
        "“Mostly they get straight sticks of the Arrow-wood; but I haven’t seen\nany Arrow-wood here, and they’re not so awfully straight. You see, an\narrow must be straight or it’ll fly crooked. ’Straight as an arrow’\nmeans the thing itself. We can do better than the Indians ’cause we\nhave better tools. We can split them out of the solid wood.”",
        "“What wood? Some bloomin’ foreign kind that no White-man never saw nor\nheard of before?”",
        "“No sir-ree. There ain’t anything better ’n White Pine for target and\nAsh or Hickory for hunting arrows. Which are we making?”",
        "“I’m a hunter. Give me huntin’ arrows every time. What’s needed next?”",
        "“Seasoned Ash twenty-five inches long, split to three-eighths of an\ninch thick, hot glue, and turkey-wing feathers.”",
        "“I’ll get the feathers and let you do the rest,” said Sam, producing\na bundle of turkey-wings, laid away as stove-dusters, and then belied\nhis own statement by getting a block of Ash and splitting it up,\nhalving it each time till he had a pile of two dozen straight sticks\nabout three-quarters of an inch thick.",
        "Yan took one and began with his knife to whittle it down to proper\nsize and shape, but Sam said, “I can do better than that,” then took\nthe lot to the workbench and set to work with a smoothing plane. Yan\nlooked worried and finally said:",
        "“Injuns didn’t have planes.”",
        "“Nor jack-knives neither,” was the retort.",
        "That was true, and yet somehow Yan’s ideal that he hankered after\nwas the pre-Columbian Indian, the one who had no White-man’s help or\ntools.",
        "“It seems to me it’d be more Injun to make these with just what we get\nin the woods. The Injuns didn’t have jack-knives, but they had sharp\nflints in the old days.”",
        "“Yan, you go ahead with a sharp stone. You’ll find lots on the road if\nyou take off your shoes and walk barefoot–awful sharp; an’ I’ll go\nahead with the smoothing plane an’ see who wins.”",
        "Yan was not satisfied, but he contented himself with promising that he\nwould some day make some arrows of Arrow-wood shoots and now he\nwould finish at least one with his knife. He did so, but Sam, in the\nmeantime, made six much better ones with the smoothing plane.",
        "“What about heads?” said he.",
        "“I’ve been thinking,” was the reply. “Of course the Indians used stone\nheads fastened on with sinew, but we haven’t got the stuff to do that.\nBought heads of iron with a ferrule for the end of the arrow are best,\nbut we can’t get them. Bone heads and horn heads will do. I made some\nfine ones once filing bones into the shape, but they were awfully\nbrittle; and I made some more of big nails cut off and set in with a\nlashing of fine wire around the end to stop the wood splitting. Some\nIndian arrows have no point but the stick sharpened after it’s\nscorched to harden it.”",
        "[Illustration: SIX SAMPLE ARROWS, SHOWING DIFFERENT FEATHERS]",
        "“That sounds easy enough for me,” said Sam; “let’s make some of them\nthat way.”",
        "So the arrows were made, six each with nail points filed sharp and\nlashed with broom wire. These were called “War arrows,” and six each\nwith fire-hardened wood points for hunting arrows.",
        "“Now for the feathering,” and Yan showed Sam how to split the midrib\nof a turkey feather and separate the vane.",
        "“Le’s see, you want twice twenty-four–that’s forty-eight feathers.”",
        "“No,” said Yan, “that’s a poor feathering, two on each. We want three\non each arrow–seventy-two strips in all, and mind you, we want all\nthree that are on one arrow from the same side of the bird.”",
        "“I know. I’ll bet it’s bad luck to mix sides; arrows doesn’t know\nwhich way to turn.”",
        "At this moment Si Lee came in. “How are ye gettin’ on with the bows?”",
        "“Waitin’ for arrows now.”",
        "“How do ye put on the feathers?”",
        "    A is a far-flying steel-pointed bobtail, very good in wind.\n    B is another very good arrow, with a horn point. This went\n    even better than A if there were no wind. C is an\n    Omaha war and deer arrow. Both heads and feathers are lashed on\n    with sinew. The long tufts of down left on the feathers are to\n    help in finding it again, as they are snow-white and wave in the\n    breeze. The grooves on the shaft are to make the victim bleed more\n    freely and be more easily tracked. D is another Omaha\n    arrow with a peculiar owner’s mark of lines carved in the middle,\n    E is a bone-headed bird shaft made by the Indians of the\n    Mackenzie River. F is a war arrow made by Geronimo, the\n    famous Apache chief. Its shaft is three joints of a straight cane.\n    The tip is of hard wood, and on that is a fine quartz point; all\n    being lashed together with sinew.",
        "“White-men glue them on, and Injuns lash them on,” replied Yan,\nquoting from memory from “that book.”",
        "“Which is best?”",
        "“Glued on flies better, but lashed on stands the weather better.”",
        "“Why not both?”",
        "“Have no sinew.”",
        "“Let me show ye a trick. Where’s yer glue an’ linen thread?”",
        "These were brought, whereupon Si added: “’Pears to me ye oughter put\nthe feathers on last. Better cut the notch first.”",
        "“That’s so; we nearly forgot.”",
        "“_You nearly forgot, you mean. Don’t drag me in the mud,\"\nsaid Sam, with owlish dignity. A small saw cut, cleaned up and widened\nwith a penknife, proved the best; a notch one-fourth inch deep was\nquickly made in each arrow, and Si set about both glueing\nand lashing on the feathers, but using wax-end instead of\nsinew.",
        "Yan had marked the place for each feather so that none would strike\nthe bow in passing (see Cut page 183). He first glued them on,\nthen made a lashing for half an inch on the projecting ends of the\nfeather-rib, and another behind, carrying this second lashing back to\nthe beginning of the notch to guard against the wood splitting. When\nhe had trimmed all loose ends and rolled the waxed thread well on the\nbench with a flat stick, the threads seemed to disappear and leave\nsimply a smooth black ring.",

        "“Do the Injuns have them?” asked Sam, with a keen eye to orthodoxy\nwhen it promised to cut short the hard work.",
        "“Well, I should say so; couldn’t live without them.”",
        "“All right; hurry up. I’m spoiling for a hunt. What are they made of?”",
        "“Oh, ’most anything.”",
        "“Haven’t got it.”",

        "“That’s us. You mind the stuff left off the teepee?”",
        "“Do till we get better.” So each made a sort of canvas bag shorter\nthan the arrows. Yan painted an Indian device on each, and they were\nready.",
        "“Now bring on your Bears,” said the older boy, and feeling a sense of\ncomplete armament, they went out.",
        "“See who can hit that tree.” Both fired together and missed, but Sam’s\narrow struck another tree and split open.",
        "“Guess we’d better get a soft target,” he remarked. Then after\ndiscussion they got a large old corn sack full of hay, painted on it\nsome rings around a bull’s eye (a Buffalo’s eye, Sam called it) and\nset it up at twenty yards.",
        "They were woefully disappointed at first in their shooting. It did\nseem a very easy mark, and it was disappointing to have the arrows fly\nsome feet away to the left.",
        "“Le’s get in the barn and shoot at that,” suggested Sam.",
        "“We might hit it if we shut the door tight,” was the optimistic reply.\nAs well as needing practice, the boys had to learn several little\nrules about Archery. But Yan had some pencil notes from “that book\"\nand some more in his brain that with much practice gradually taught\nhim: To stand with his heel centres in line with the target; his right\nelbow in line with the arrow; his left hand fixed till the arrow\nstruck; his right thumb always on the same place on his cheek when he\nfired, and the bow plumb.",
        "They soon found that they needed guards for the left arm where the bow\nstrings struck, and these they made out of the leg of an old boot (see\nCut page 183), and an old glove to protect the fingers of the right\nhand when they practised very much. After they learned to obey the\nrules without thinking about them, the boys improved quickly and soon\nthey were able to put all the arrows into the hay sack at twenty\nyards, increasing the distance later till they could make fair\nshooting at forty yards.",
        "They were not a little surprised to find how much individuality the\narrows had, although meant to be exactly alike.",
        "Sam had one that continued to warp until it was much bent, and the\nresult was some of the most surprising curves in its flight. This he\ncalled the “Boomerang.” Another, with a very small feather, travelled\nfarther than any of the rest. This was the “Far-killer.” His best\narrow, one that he called “Sure-death,” was a long-feathered Turkey\nshaft with a light head. It was very reliable on a calm day, but\napt to swerve in the wind. Yet another, with a small feather, was\ncorrespondingly reliable on a windy day. This was “Wind-splitter.”",
        "The one Yan whittled with the knife was called the “Whittler,” and\nsometimes the “Joker.” It was a perpetual mystery, they never knew\njust what it would do next. His particular pet was one with a hollow\naround the point, which made a whistling sound when it flew, and was\nsometimes called the “Whistler” and sometimes the “Jabberwock,\"\n\"which whiffled through the tulgy wood and burbled as it came.”",
        "[Illustration: CORRECT FORM IN SHOOTING The diagram at bottom is to\nshow the centres of heels in line with target.]",
        "The Dam",
        "One hot day early in July they were enjoying themselves in the shallow\nbathing-hole of the creek, when Sam observed: “It’s getting low. It\ngoes dry every summer.”",
        "This was not pleasing to foresee, and Yan said, “Why can’t we make a\ndam?”",
        "“A little too much like work.”",
        "“Oh, pshaw! That’d be fun and we’d have a swimming-place for all\nsummer, then. Come on; let’s start now.”",
        "“Never heard of Injuns doing so much work.”",
        "“Well, we’ll play Beaver while we do it. Come on, now; here’s for\na starter,” and Yan carried a big stone to what seemed to him the\nnarrowest place. Then he brought more, and worked with enthusiasm till\nhe had a line of stones right across the creek bed.",
        "Sam still sat naked on the bank, his knees to his chin and his arms\naround them. The war-paint was running down his chest in blue and red\nstreaks.",
        "“Come on, here, you lazy freak, and work,” cried Yan, and flung a\nhandful of mud to emphasize the invite.",
        "“My festered knee’s broke out again,” was the reply.",
        "At length Yan said, “I’m not going to do it all alone,” and\nstraightened up his back.",
        "“Look a-here,” was the answer. “I’ve been thinking. The cattle water\nhere. The creek runs dry in summer, then the cattle has to go to the\nbarnyard and drink at the trough–has to be pumped for, and hang round\nfor hours after hoping some one will give them some oats, instead of\nhustling back to the woods to get fat. Now, two big logs across there\nwould be more’n half the work. I guess we’ll ask Da to lend us the\nteam to put them logs across to make a drinking-pond for the cattle.\nThem cattle is awful on my mind. Didn’t sleep all night thinking o’\nthem. I just hate like pizen to see them walking all the way to the\nbarn in hot weather for a drink–’tain’t right.” So Sam waited for a\nproper chance to “tackle” his father. It did not come that day, but at\nbreakfast next morning Raften looked straight at Yan across the table,\nand evidently thinking hard about something, said:",
        "“Yahn, this yer room is twenty foot by fifteen, how much ilecloth\nthree foot wide will it call fur?”",
        "“Thirty-three and one-third yards,” Yan said at once.",
        "Raften was staggered. Yan’s manner was convincing, but to do all that\nin his head was the miracle. Various rude tests were applied and the\ngeneral opinion prevailed that Yan was right.",
        "The farmer’s face beamed with admiration for the first time. “Luk at\nthat,” he said to the table, “luk at that fur eddication. When’ll you\nbe able to do the like?” he said to Sam.",
        "“Never,” returned his son, with slow promptness. “Dentists don’t have\nto figger on ilecloth.”",
        "“Say, Yan,” said Sam aside, “guess you better tackle Da about\nthe dam. Kind o’ sot up about ye this mornin’; your eddication has\nsoftened him some, an’ it’ll last till about noon, I jedge. Strike\nwhile the iron is hot.”",
        "So after breakfast Yan commenced:",
        "“Mr. Raften, the creek’s running dry. We want to make a pond for the\ncattle to drink, but we can’t make a dam without two big logs across.\nWill you let us have the team a few minutes to place the logs?”",
        "“It ain’t fur a swimmin’-pond, is it, ye mean?” said Raften, with a\ntwinkle in his eye.",
        "“It would do for that as well,” and Yan blushed.",
        "“Sounds to me like Sam talking through Yan’s face,” added Raften,\nshrewdly taking in the situation. “I’ll see fur meself.”",
        "Arrived at the camp, he asked: “Now, whayer’s yer dam to be? Thar?\nThat’s no good. It’s narrer but it’d be runnin’ round both ends afore\nye had any water to speak of. Thayer’s a better place, a bit wider,\nbut givin’ a good pond. Whayer’s yer logs? Thayer? What–my seasoning\ntimber? Ye can’t hev that. That’s the sill fur the new barrn; nor\nthat–it’s seasonin’ fur gate posts. Thayer’s two ye kin hev. I’ll\nsend the team, but don’t let me ketch ye stealin’ any o’ my seasonin’\ntimber or the fur’ll fly.”",
        "With true Raften promptness the heavy team came, the two great logs\nwere duly dragged across and left as Yan requested (four feet apart\nfor the top of the dam).",
        "The boys now drove in a row of stakes against each log on the inner\nside, to form a crib, and were beginning to fill in the space with mud\nand stones. They were digging and filling it up level as they went.\nClay was scarce and the work went slowly; the water, of course, rising\nas the wall arose, added to the difficulty. But presently Yan said:",
        "“Hold on. New scheme. Let’s open her and dig a deep trench on one\nside so all the water will go by, then leave a clay wall to it” [the\ntrench] “and dig a deep hole on the other side of it. That will give\nus plenty of stuff for the dam and help to deepen the pond.”",
        "Thus they worked. In a week the crib was full of packed clay and\nstone. Then came the grand finish–the closing of this sluiceway\nthrough the dam. It was not easy with the full head of water running,\nbut they worked like beavers and finally got it stopped.",
        "That night there was a heavy shower. Next day when they came near they\nheard a dull roar in the woods. They stopped and listened in doubt,\nthen Yan exclaimed gleefully: “The dam! That’s the water running over\nthe dam.”",
        "They both set off with a yell and ran their fastest. As soon as they\ncame near they saw a great sheet of smooth water where the stony creek\nbottom had been and a steady current over the low place left as an\noverflow in the middle of the dam.",
        "What a thrill of pleasure that was!",
        "“Last in’s a dirty sucker.”",
        "“Look out for my bad knee,” was the response.",
        "The rest of the race was a mixture of stripping and sprinting and the\nboys splashed in together.",
        "Five feet deep in the deep hole, a hundred yards long, and all their\nown doing.",
        "“Now, wasn’t it worth it?” asked Yan, who had had much difficulty in\nkeeping Sam steadily at play that looked so very much like work.",
        "“Wonder how that got here? I thought I left that in the teepee?” and\nSam pointed to a log that he used for a seat in the teepee, but now it\nwas lodged in the overflow.",
        "Yan was a good swimmer, and as they played and splashed, Sam said:\n\"Now I know who you are. You can’t hide it from me no longer. I\nsuspicioned it when you were working on the dam. You’re that tarnal\nRedskin they call ’Little Beaver.’”",
        "“I’ve been watching you,” retorted Yan, “and it seems to me I’ve run up\nagainst that copper-coloured scallawag–’Young-Man-Afraid-of-a-Shovel.’”",
        "[Illustration: The dam was a great success]",
        "“No, you don’t,” said Sam. “Nor I ain’t\n’_Bald-Eagle-Settin’-on-a-Rock-with-his-Tail-Hangin’-over-the-Edge,’nuther. In fact, I don’t keer to be recognized just now. Ain’t it a\nrelief to think the cattle don’t have to take that walk any more?”",
        "Sam was evidently trying to turn the subject, but Yan would not be\nbalked. “I heard Si call you ’Woodpecker’ the other day.”",
        "“Yep. I got that at school. When I was a kid to hum I heerd Ma talk\nabout me be-a-u-tiful golden hair, but when I got big enough\nto go to school I learned that it was only red, an’ they called\nme the ’Red-headed Woodpecker.’ I tried to lick them, but lots of them\ncould lick me an’ rubbed it in wuss. When I seen fightin’ didn’t\nwork, I let on to like it, but it was too late then. Mostly it’s just\n’Woodpecker’ for short. I don’t know as it ever lost me any sleep.”",
        "Half an hour later, as they sat by the fire that Yan made with\nrubbing-sticks, he said, “Say, Woodpecker, I want to tell you a\nstory.” Sam grimaced, pulled his ears forward, and made ostentatious\npreparations to listen.",
        "“There was once an Indian squaw taken prisoner by some other tribe way\nup north. They marched her 500 miles away, but one night she escaped\nand set out, not on the home trail, for she knew they would follow\nthat way and kill her, but to one side. She didn’t know the country\nand got lost. She had no weapons but a knife, and no food but berries.\nWell, she travelled fast for several days till a rainstorm came, then\nshe felt safe, for she knew her enemies could not trail her now. But\nwinter was near and she could not get home before it came. So she set\nto work right where she was.",
        "“She made a wigwam of Birch bark and a fire with rubbing-sticks, using\nthe lace of her moccasin for a bow-string. She made snares of the\ninner bark of the Willow and of Spruce roots, and deadfalls, too, for\nRabbits. She was starving sometimes, at first, but she ate the buds\nand inner bark of Birch trees till she found a place where there were\nlots of Rabbits. And when she caught some she used every scrap of\nthem. She made a fishing-line of the sinews, and a hook of the bones\nand teeth lashed together with sinew and Spruce gum.",
        "“She made a cloak of Rabbit skins, sewed with needles of Rabbit bone\nand thread of Rabbit sinew, and a lot of dishes of Birch bark sewed\nwith Spruce roots.",
        "“She put in the whole winter there alone, and when the spring came she\nwas found by Samuel Hearne, the great traveller. Her precious knife\nwas worn down, but she was fat and happy and ready to set out for her\nown people.”",
        "“Well, I say that’s mighty inter-est-in’,” said Sam–he had listened\nattentively–\"an’ I’d like nothin’ better than to try it myself if I\nhad a gun an’ there was lots of game.”",
        "“Pooh, who wouldn’t?”",
        "“Mighty few–an’ there’s mighty few who could.\"\n\"I could.”",
        "“What, make everything with just a knife? I’d like to see you make\na teepee,” then adding earnestly, “Sam, we’ve been kind o’ playing\nInjuns; now let’s do it properly. Let’s make everything out of what we\nfind in the woods.”",
        "“Guess we’ll have to visit the Sanger Witch again. She knows all about\nplants.”",
        "“We’ll be the Sanger Indians. We can both be Chiefs,” said Yan, not\nwishing to propose himself as Chief or caring to accept Sam as his\nsuperior. “I’m Little Beaver. Now what are you?”",
        "“Bloody-Thundercloud-in-the-Afternoon.”",
        "“No, try again. Make it something you can draw, so you can make your\ntotem, and make it short.”",
        "“What’s the smartest animal there is?”",
        "“I–I–suppose the Wolverine.”",
        "“What! Smarter’n a Fox?”",
        "“The books say so.”",
        "“Kin he lick a Beaver?”",
        "“Well, I should say so.”",
        "“Well, that’s me.”",
        "“No, you don’t. I’m not going around with a fellow that licks me. It\ndon’t fit you as well as ’Woodpecker,’ anyhow. I always get youwhen I want a nice tree spoiled or pecked into holes,” retorted Yan,\nmagnanimously ignoring the personal reason for the name.",
        "“Tain t as bad as beavering,” answered Sam",
        "“Beavering” was a word with a history. Axes and timber were the\nbiggest things in the lives of the Sangerites. Skill with the axe was\nthe highest accomplishment. The old settlers used to make everything\nin the house out of wood, and with the axe for the only tool. It was\neven said that some of them used to “edge her up a bit” and shave with\nher on Sundays. When a father was setting his son up in life he gave\nhim simply a good axe. The axe was the grand essential of life and\nwork, and was supposed to be a whole outfit. Skill with the axe was\ngeneral. Every man and boy was more or less expert, and did not know\nhow expert he was till a real “greeny” came among them. There is a\nright way to cut for each kind of grain, and a certain proper way of\nfelling a tree to throw it in any given direction with the minimum of\nlabour. All these things are second nature to the Sangerite. A Beaver\nis credited with a haphazard way of gnawing round and round a tree\ntill somehow it tumbles, and when a chopper deviates in the least from\nthe correct form, the exact right cut in the exact right place, he is\nsaid to be “beavering\"; therefore, while “working like a Beaver” is\nhigh praise, “beavering” a tree is a term of unmeasured reproach, and\nSam’s final gibe had point and force that none but a Sangerite could\npossibly have appreciated.",
        "Yan and the Witch",
        "  The Sanger Witch hated the Shanty-man’s axe\n  And wildfire, too, they tell,\n  But the hate that she had for the Sporting man\n  Was wuss nor her hate of Hell!",
        "  –Cracked Jimmie’s Ballad of Sanger.",
        "Yan took his earliest opportunity to revisit the Sanger Witch.",
        "“Better leave me out,” advised Sam, when he heard of it. “She’d never\nlook at you if I went. You look too blame healthy.”",
        "So Yan went alone, and he was glad of it. Fond as he was of Sam, his\nvoluble tongue and ready wit left Yan more or less in the shade, made\nhim look sober and dull, and what was worse, continually turned the\nconversation just as it was approaching some subject that was of\ndeepest interest to him.",
        "As he was leaving, Sam called out, “Say, Yan, if you want to stay\nthere to dinner it’ll be all right–we’ll know why you hain’t turned\nup.” Then he stuck his tongue in his cheek, closed one eye and went to\nthe barn with his usual expression of inscrutable melancholy.",
        "Yan carried his note-book–he used it more and more, also his\nsketching materials. On the road he gathered a handful of flowers and\nherbs. His reception by the old woman was very different this time.",
        "“Come in, come in, God bless ye, an’ hoo air ye, an’ how is yer father\nan’ mother–come in an’ set down, an’ how is that spalpeen, Sam\nRaften?”",
        "“Sam’s all right now,” said Yan with a blush.",
        "“All right! Av coorse he’s all right. I knowed I’d fix him all right,\nan’ he knowed it, an’ his Ma knowed it when she let him come. Did she\nsay onything about it?”",
        "“No, Granny, not a word.”",
        "“The dhirty hussy! Saved the boy’s life in sphite of their robbin’ me\nan’ she ain’t human enough to say ’thank ye’–the dhirty hussy!\nMay God forgive her as I do,” said the old woman with evident and\nimplacable enmity.",
        "“Fwhat hev ye got thayer? Hivin be praised, they can’t kill them all\noff. They kin cut down the trees, but the flowers comes ivery year, me\nlittle beauties–me little beauties!” Yan spread them out. She picked\nup an Arum and went on. “Now, that’s Sorry-plant, only some calls it\nInjun Turnip, an’ I hear the childer call it Jack-in-the-Pulpit. Don’t\nye never put the root o’ that near yer tongue. It’ll sure burn ye like\nfire. First thing whin they gits howld av a greeny the bhise throis to\nmake him boite that same.

        "Golden Seal (_Hydrastis canadensis_), the plant she had used for\nSam’s knee, was duly recognized and praised, its wonderful golden\nroot, “the best goold iver came out av the ground,” was described with\nits impression of the seal of the Wise King.",
        "“Thim’s Mandrakes, an’ they’re moighty late, an’ ye shure got\nthim in the woods. Some calls it May Apples, an’ more calls it\nKingroot. The Injuns use it fur their bowels, an’ it has cured many a\nhorse of pole evil that I seen meself.",
        "“An’ Blue Cohosh, only I call that Spazzum-root.

        "“Now luk at thot,” said she, clawing over the bundle and picking out a\nyellow Cypripedium, “that’s Moccasin-plant wid the Injuns, but mercy\non ’em fur bloind, miserable haythens. They don’t know nothin’ an’\ndon’t want to larn it. That’s Umbil, or Sterrick-root. It’s powerful\ngood fur sterricks. Luk at it!

It’s ayther in the\nflower or in the root, so when the flower is thayer the root’s no more\ngood than an ould straw.

        "“Yes,” replied Yan; “that’s just where I got it. But hold on, Granny,\nI want to sketch all those and note down their names and what you say\nabout them.”",
        "“Shure, you’d hev a big book when I wuz through,” said the old woman\nwith pride, as she lit her pipe, striking the match on what would have\nbeen the leg of her pants had she been a man.",
        "“An’ shure ye don’t need to write down what they’re good fur, fur the\ngood Lord done that Himself long ago. Luk here, now.

        "“Faix, an’ they differ fur different things.”",
        "“Yes, but what are they?” Then seeing how general questions failed, he\nwent at it in detail.",
        "“What do they use for yellow dye on the Porcupine quills–I mean\nbefore the boughten dyes came?”",
        "“Well, shure an’ that’s a purty yellow flower that grows in the fall\nout in the field an’ along the fences. The Yaller Weed, I call it,\nan’ some calls it Goldenrod. They bile the quills in wather with the\nflower. Luk! Thar’s some wool dyed that way.”",
        "“An’ the red?” said Yan, scribbling away.",
        "“Faix, an’ they had no rale good red. They made a koind o’ red o’\nberry juice b’iled, an’ wanst I seen a turrible nice red an ol’ squaw\nmade b’ilin’ the quills fust in yaller awhile an’ next awhile in red.”",
        "“What berries make the best red, Granny?”",
        "“Well, ’tain’t the red wans, as ye moight think. Ye kin make it of\nRosberries or Sumac or Huckleberries an’ lots more, but Black Currants\nis redder than Red Currants, an’ Squaw berries is best av them all.”",
        "“What are they like?”",
        "“Shure, an’ Oi’ll show ye that same hairb,” and they wandered around\noutside the shanty in vain search. “It’s too airly,” said Granny, “but\nit’s round thayer in heaps in August an’ is the purtiest red iver\ngrew. ’An Pokeweed, too, it ain’t har’ly flowerin’ yit, but in the\nfall it hez berries that’s so red they’re nigh black, an’ dyes the\npurtiest kind o’ a purple.”",
        "“What makes blue?”",
        "“Oi niver sane none in the quills. Thayer may be some. The good Lord\nmade iverything grow in the woods, but I ain’t found it an’ niver seen\nnone. Ye kin make a grane av the young shoots av Elder, but it ain’t\npurty like that,” and she pointed to a frightful emerald ribbon that\nBiddy wore, “an’ a brown of Butternut bark, an’ a black av White Oak\nchips an’ bark. Ye kin make a kind o’ grane av two dips, wan of yaller\nan wan av black. Ye kin dye black wid Hickory bark, an’ orange (bad\nscran to it) wid the inner bark of Birch, an’ yaller wid the roots\nav Hoop Ash, an’ a foine scarlet from the bark av the little root av\nDogwood, but there ain’t no rale blue in the woods, an’ that’s what I\ntell them orange-an’-blue Prattisons on the 12th o’ July, fur what the\nLord didn’t make the divil did.",
        "“Ye kin make a koind of blue out o’ the Indigo hairb, but ’tain’t like\nthis,” pointing to some screaming cobalt, “an’ if it ain’t in the\nwoods the good Lord niver meant us to have it. Yis! I tell ye it’s\nthe divil’s own colour, that blue-orange an’ blue is the divil’s own\ncolours, shure enough, fur brimstone’s yaller; an’ its blue whin it’s\nburnin’, that I hed from his riv’rince himself–bless him!”",
        "Dinner with the Witch",
        "Biddy meanwhile had waddled around the room slapping the boards with\nher broad bare feet as she prepared their dinner. She was evidently\ntrying to put on style, for she turned out her toes excessively.\nShe spoke several times about “the toime when she resoided with yer\nmamma,” then at length, “Whayer’s the tablecloth, Granny?”",
        "“Now, wud ye listen to thot, an’ she knowin’ that divil a clath hev we\nin the wurruld, an’ glad enough to hev vittles on the table, let\nalone a clath,” said Granny, oblivious of the wreck she was making of\nBiddy’s pride.",
        "“Will ye hay tay or coffee, Yahn?” said Biddy.",
        "“Tea,” was Yan’s choice.",
        "“Faix, an’ Oi’m glad ye said tay, fur Oi ain’ seen a pick o’ coffee\nsense Christmas, an’ the tay Oi kin git in the woods, but thayer is\nsomethin’ Oi kin set afore ye that don’t grow in the woods,” and the\nold woman hobbled to a corner shelf, lifted down an old cigar box and\nfrom among matches, tobacco, feathers, tacks, pins, thread and dust\nshe picked six lumps of cube sugar, formerly white.",
        "“Thayer, shure, an’ Oi wuz kapin’ this fur whin his riv’rence comes;\nwanst a year he’s here, God bless him! but that’s fower wakes ahid,\nan’ dear knows fwhat may happen afore thin. Here, an’ a hearty\nwelcome,” said she, dropping three of the lumps in Yan’s tea. “We’ll\nkape the rest fur yer second cup. Hev some crame?” and she pushed over\na sticky-handled shaving-mug full of excellent cream. “Biddy, give\nYahn some bread.”",
        "The loaf, evidently the only one, was cut up and two or three slices\nforced into Yan’s plate.",
        "“Mebbe the butther is a little hoigh,” exclaimed the hostess, noting\nthat Yan was sparing of it. “Howld on.” She went again to the corner\nshelf and got down an old glass jar with scalloped edge and a flat tin\ncover. It evidently contained jam. She lifted the cover and exclaimed:",
        "“Well, Oi niver!” Then going to the door she fished out with her\nfingers a dead mouse and threw it out, remarking placidly, “Oi’ve\nwondered whayer the little divil wuz. Oi ain’t sane him this two\nwakes, an’ me a-thinkin’ it wuz Tom ate him. May Oi be furgiven the\nonjustice av it. Consarn them flies! That cover niver did fit.” And\nagain her finger was employed, this time to scrape off an incrustation\nof unhappy flies that had died, like Clarence, in their favourite\nbeverage.",
        "“Thayer, Yan, now ate hearty, all av it, an’ welcome. It does me good\nto see ye ate–thayer’s lots more whayer that come from,” though it\nwas obvious that she had put her all upon the table.",
        "Poor Yan was in trouble. He felt instinctively that the good old soul\nwas wrecking her week’s resources in this lavish hospitality, but he\nalso felt that she would be deeply hurt if he did not appear to enjoy\neverything. The one possibly clean thing was the bread. He devoted\nhimself to that; it was of poorest quality; one or two hairs looping\nin his teeth had been discouraging, but when he bit at a piece of\nlinen rag with a button on it he was fairly upset. He managed to hide\nthe rag, but could not conceal his sudden loss of appetite.",
        "“Hev some more av this an’ this,” and in spite of himself his\nplate was piled up with things for him to eat, including a lot of\nbeautifully boiled potatoes, but unfortunately the hostess carried\nthem from the pot on the stove in a corner of her ancient and somber\napron, and served him with her skinny paw.",
        "Yan’s appetite was wholly gone now, to the grief of his kind\nentertainer, “Shure an’ she’d fix him up something to stringthen him,\"\nand Yan had hard work to beg off.",
        "“Would ye like an aig,” ventured Biddy.",
        "“Why, yes! oh, yes, please,” exclaimed Yan, with almost too much\nenthusiasm. He thought, “Well, hens are pure-minded creatures, anyway.\nAn egg’s sure to be clean.”",
        "Biddy waddled away to the ’barrun’ and soon reappeared with three\neggs.",
        "“B’iled or fried?”",
        "“Boiled,” said Yan, aiming to keep to the safe side.",
        "Biddy looked around for a pot.",
        "“Shure, that’s b’ilin’ now,” said Granny, pointing to the great\nmass of her undergarments seething in the boiler, and accordingly the\neggs were dropped in there.",
        "Yan fervently prayed that they might not break. As it was, two did\ncrack open, but he got the other one, and that was virtually his\ndinner.",
        "A Purple Blackbird came hopping in the door now.",
        "“Will, now, thayer’s Jack. Whayer hev ye been? I thought ye wuz gone\nfur good. Shure Oi saved him from a murtherin’ gunner,” she explained.\n\"(Bad scran to the baste! I belave he was an Or’ngeman.) But he’s all\nright now an’ comes an’ goes like he owned the place. Now, Jack, you\ngit out av that wather pail,” as the beautiful bird leaped into the\nhalf-filled drinking bucket and began to take a bath.",
        "“Now luk at that,” she shouted, “ye little rascal, come out o’ that\noven,” for now the Blackbird had taken advantage of the open door to\nscramble into the dark warm oven.",
        "“Thayer he goes to warrum his futs. Oh, ye little rascal! Next thing\nye know some one’ll slam the dooer, not knowin’ a thing, and fire up,\nan’ it’s roastin’ aloive ye’ll be. Shure an’ it’s tempted Oi am to\nwring yer purty neck to save yer loife,” and she drove him out with\nthe harshest of words and the gentlest of hands.",
        "Then Yan, with his arms full of labelled plants, set out for home.",
        "“Good-boi, choild, come back agin and say me soon. Bring some more\nhairbs. Good-boi, an’ bless ye. Oi hope it’s no sin to say so, fur Oi\nknow yer a Prattison an’ ye are all on yez goin’ to hell, but yer a\nfoine bhoy. Oi’m tumble sorry yer a Prattison.”",
        "When Yan got back to the Raftens’ he found the dinner table set for\none, though it was now three in the afternoon.",
        "“Come and get your dinner,” said Mrs. Raften in her quiet motherly\nway. “I’ll put on the steak. It will be ready in five minutes.”",
        "“But I’ve had my dinner with Granny de Neuville.”",
        "“Yes, I know!”",
        "“Did she stir yer tea with one front claw an’ put jam on yer bread\nwith the other?” asked Raften, rather coarsely.",
        "“Did she b’ile her pet Blackbird fur yer soup?” said Sam.",
        "Yan turned very red. Evidently all had a good idea of what he had\nexperienced, but it jarred on him to hear their mockery of the good\nold soul.",
        "He replied warmly, “She was just as kind and nice as she could be.”",
        "“You had better have a steak now,” said Mrs. Raften, in solicitous\ndoubt.",
        "How tempting was the thought of that juicy brown steak! How his empty\nstomach did crave it! But the continued mockery had stirred him. He\nwould stand up for the warm-hearted old woman who had ungrudgingly\ngiven him the best she had–had given her all–to make a hearty\nwelcome for a stranger. They should never know how gladly he would\nhave eaten now, and in loyalty to his recent hostess he added the\nfirst lie of his life:",
        "“No, thank you very much, but really I am not in the least hungry. I\nhad a fine dinner at Granny de Neuville’s.”",
        "Then, defying the inner pangs of emptiness, he went about his evening\nchores.",
        "The Hostile Spy",
        "“Wonder where Caleb got that big piece of Birch bark,” said Yan; “I’d\nlike some for dishes.”",
        "“Guess I know. He was over to Burns’s bush. There’s none in ours. We\nkin git some.”",
        "“Will you ask him?”",
        "“Naw, who cares for an old Birch tree. We’ll go an’ borrow it when he\nain’t lookin’.”",
        "Yan hesitated.",
        "Sam took the axe. “We’ll call this a war party into the enemy’s\ncountry. There’s sure ’nuff war that-a-way. He’s one of Da’s\n’_friends.’_”",
        "Yan followed, in doubt still as to the strict honesty of the\nproceeding.",
        "Over the line they soon found a good-sized canoe Birch, and were busy\nwhacking away to get off a long roll, when a tall man and a small boy,\napparently attracted by the chopping, came in sight and made toward\nthem. Sam called under his breath: “It’s old Burns. Let’s git.”",
        "There was no time to save anything but themselves and the axe. They\nran for the boundary fence, while Burns contented himself with\nshouting out threats and denunciations. Not that he cared a straw for\nthe Birch tree–timber had no value in that country–but unfortunately\nRaften had quarrelled with all his immediate neighbours, therefore\nBurns did his best to make a fearful crime of the petty depredation.",
        "His valiant son, a somewhat smaller boy than either Yan or Sam, came\nnear enough to the boundary to hurl opprobrious epithets.",
        "“Red-head–red-head! You red-headed thief! Hol’ on till my paw gits\nhol’ o’ you–Raften, the Baften, the rick-strick Straften,” and others\nequally galling and even more exquisitely refined.",
        "“War party escaped and saved their scalps,” and Sam placidly laid the\naxe in its usual place.",
        "“Nothing lost but honour,” added Yan. “Who’s the kid?”",
        "“Oh, that’s Guy Burns. I know him. He’s a mean little cuss, always\nsneaking and peeking. Lies like sixty. Got the prize–a big\nscrubbing-brush–for being the dirtiest boy in school. We all voted,\nand the teacher gave it to him.”",
        "Next day the boys made another war party for Birch bark, but had\nhardly begun operations when there was an uproar not far away, and a\nvoice, evidently of a small boy, mouthing it largely, trying to pass\nitself off as a man’s voice: “Hi, yer the –– ––. Yer git off my\n–– –– place –– ––”",
        "“Le’s capture the little cuss, Yan.”",
        "“An’ burn him at the stake with horrid torture,” was the rejoinder.",
        "They set out in his direction, but again the appearance of Burns\nchanged their war-party onslaught into a rapid retreat.",
        "(More opprobrium.)",
        "During the days that followed the boys were often close to the\nboundary, but it happened that Burns was working near and Guy had the\nquickest of eyes and ears. The little rat seemed ever on the alert. He\nsoon showed by his long-distance remarks that he knew all about the\nboys’ pursuits–had doubtless visited the camp in their absence.\nSeveral times they saw him watching them with intense interest when\nthey were practising with bow and arrow, but he always retreated to a\nsafe distance when discovered, and then enjoyed himself breathing out\nfire and slaughter.",
        "One day the boys came to the camp at an unusual hour. On going into a\nnear thicket Yan saw a bare foot under some foliage. “Hallo, what’s\nthis?” He stooped down and found a leg to it and at the end of that\nGuy Burns.",
        "Up Guy jumped, yelling “Paw–Paw–PAW!” He ran for his life, the\nIndians uttering blood-curdlers on his track. But Yan was a runner,\nand Guy’s podgy legs, even winged by fear, had no chance. He was\nseized and dragged howling back to the camp.",
        "“You let me alone, you Sam Raften–now you let me alone!” There was,\nhowever, a striking lack of opprobrium in his remarks now. (Such\ndelicacy is highly commendable in the very young.)",
        "“First thing is to secure the prisoner, Yan.”",
        "Sam produced a cord.",
        "“Pooh,” said Yan. “You’ve got no style about you. Bring me some\nLeatherwood.”",
        "This was at hand, and in spite of howls and scuffles, Guy was solemnly\ntied to a tree–a green one–because, as Yan pointed out, that would\nresist the fire better.",
        "The two Warriors now squatted cross-legged by the fire. The older one\nlighted a peace-pipe, and they proceeded to discuss the fate of the\nunhappy captive.",
        "“Brother,” said Yan, with stately gestures, “it is very pleasant to\nhear the howls of this miserable paleface.” (It was really getting to\nbe more than they could endure.)",
        "“Ugh–heap good,” said the Woodpecker.",
        "“Ye better let me alone. My Paw’ll fix you for this, you dirty\ncowards,” wailed the prisoner, fast losing control of his tongue.",
        "“Ugh! Take um scalp first, burn him after,” and Little Beaver made\nsome expressive signs.",
        "“Wah–bully–me heap wicked,” rejoined the Woodpecker, expectorating\non a stone and beginning to whet his jack-knife.",
        "The keen and suggestive ’weet, weet, weet_” of the knife on the\nstone smote on Guy’s ears and nerves with appalling effect.",
        "“Brother Woodpecker, the spirit of our tribe calls out for the blood\nof the victim–all of it.”",
        "“Great Chief Woodpecker, you mean,” said Sam, aside. “If you don’t\ncall me Chief, I won’t call you Chief, that’s all.”",
        "The Great Woodpecker and Little Beaver now entered the teepee,\nrepainted each other’s faces, adjusted their head-dresses and stepped\nout to the execution.",
        "The Woodpecker re-whetted his knife. It did not need it, but he liked\nthe sound.",
        "Little Beaver now carried a lot of light firewood and arranged it in\nfront of the prisoner, but Guy’s legs were free and he gave it a kick\nwhich sent it all flying. The two War-chiefs leaped aside. “Ugh! Heap\nsassy,” said the ferocious Woodpecker. “Tie him legs, oh, Brother\nGreat Chief Little Beaver!”",
        "A new bark strip tied his legs securely to the tree. Then Chief\nWoodpecker approached with his knife and said:",
        "“Great Brother Chief Little Beaver, if we scalp him there is only one\nscalp, and you will have nothing to show, except you’re content\nwith the wishbone.”",
        "Here was a difficulty, artificial yet real, but Yan suggested:",
        "“Great Brother Chief\nRed-headed-Woodpecker-Settin’-on-a-Stump-with-his-Tail-Waggling-over-the\nEdge, no scalp him; skin his hull head, then each take half skin.”",
        "“Wah! Very good, oh Brother Big-Injun-Chief Great-Little-Beaver-\nChaw-a-Tree-Down.”",
        "Then the Woodpecker got a piece of charcoal and proceeded in horrid\ngravity to mark out on the tow hair of the prisoner just what he\nconsidered a fair division. Little Beaver objected that he was\nentitled to an ear and half of the crown, which is the essential part\nof the scalp. The Woodpecker pointed out that fortunately the prisoner\nhad a cow-lick that was practically a second crown. This ought to do\nperfectly well for the younger Chief’s share. The charcoal lines were\ndusted off for a try-over. Both Chiefs got charcoal now and a new\nsketch plan was made on Guy’s tow top and corrected till it was\naccepted by both.",
        "[Illustration: “Ugh! Heap sassy!\"]",
        "The victim had really never lost heart till now. His flow of threats\nand epithets had been continuous and somewhat tedious. He had\nthreatened to tell his “paw” and “the teacher,” and all the world, but\nfinally he threatened to tell Mr. Raften. This was the nearest to a\nhome thrust of any yet, and in some uneasiness the Woodpecker turned\nto Little Beaver and said:",
        "“Brother Chief, do you comprehend the language of the blithering\nPaleface? What does he say?”",
        "“Ugh, I know not,” was the reply. “Maybe he now singeth a death song\nin his own tongue.”",
        "Guy was not without pluck. He had kept up heart so far believing that\nthe boys were “foolin’,” but when he felt the awful charcoal line\ndrawn to divide his scalp satisfactorily between these two inhuman,\npainted monsters, and when with a final ’weet, weet, weet_\"\nof the knife on the stone the implacable Woodpecker approached and\ngrabbed his tow locks in one hand, then he broke down and wept\nbitterly.",
        "“Oh, please don’t––Oh, Paw! Oh, Maw! Let me go this time an’ I’ll\nnever do it again.” What he would not do was not specified, but the\nevidence of surrender was complete.",
        "“Hold on, Great Brother Chief,” said Little Beaver. “It is the custom\nof the tribes to release or even to adopt such prisoners as have shown\nnotable fortitude.”",
        "“Showed fortitude enough for six if it’s the same thing as yellin’,\"\nsaid the Woodpecker, dropping into his own vernacular.",
        "“Let us cut his bonds so that he may escape to his own people.”",
        "“Thar’d be more style to it if we left him thar overnight an’ found\nnext mornin’ he had escaped somehow by himself,” said the older Chief.\nThe victim noted the improvement in his situation and now promised\namid sobs to get them all the Birch bark they wanted–to do anything,\nif they would let him go. He would even steal for them the choicest\nproducts of his father’s orchard.",
        "Little Beaver drew his knife and cut bond after bond.",
        "Woodpecker got his bow and arrow, remarking “Ugh, heap fun shoot him\nrunnin’.”",
        "The last bark strip was cut. Guy needed no urging. He ran for the\nboundary fence in silence till he got over; then finding himself safe\nand unpursued, he rilled the air with threats and execrations. No part\nof his statement would do to print here.",
        "After such a harrowing experience most boys would have avoided that\nswamp, but Guy knew Sam at school as a good-natured fellow. He began\nto think he had been unduly scared. He was impelled by several\nmotives, a burning curiosity being, perhaps the most important. The\nresult was that one day when the boys came to camp they saw Guy\nsneaking off. It was fun to capture him and drag him back. He was very\nsullen, and not so noisy as the other time, evidently less scared.\nThe Chiefs talked of fire and torture and of ducking him in the pond\nwithout getting much response. Then they began to cross-examine the\nprisoner. He gave no answer. Why did he come to the camp? What was he\ndoing–stealing? etc. He only looked sullen.",
        "“Let’s blindfold him and drive a Gyascutus down his back,” said Yan in\na hollow voice.",
        "“Good idee,” agreed Sam, not knowing any more than the prisoner what a\nGyascutus was. Then he added, “just as well be merciful. It’ll put him\nout o’ pain.”",
        "It is the unknown that terrifies. The prisoner’s soul was touched\nagain. His mouth was trembling at the corners. He was breaking down\nwhen Yan followed it up: “Then why don’t you tell us what you are\ndoing here?”",
        "He blubbered out, “I want to play Injun, too.”",
        "The boys broke down in another way. They had not had time to paint\ntheir faces, so that their expressions were very clear on this\noccasion.",
        "Then Little Beaver arose and addressed the Council.",
        "“Great Chiefs of the Sanger Nation: The last time we tortured and\nburned to death this prisoner, he created quite an impression. Never\nbefore has one of our prisoners shown so many different kinds of\ngifts. I vote to receive him into the Tribe.”",
        "The Woodpecker now arose and spoke:",
        "“O wisest Chief but one in this Tribe, that’s all right enough, but\nyou know that no warrior can join us without first showing that he’s\ngood stuff and clear grit, all wool, and a cut above the average\nsomehow. It hain’t never been so. Now he’s got to lick some Warrior of\nthe Tribe. Kin you do that?”",
        "“Nope.”",
        "“Or outrun one or outshoot him or something–or give us all a present.\nWhat kin you do?”",
        "“I kin steal watermillyons, an’ I kin see farder ’n any boy in school,\nan’ I kin sneak to beat all creation. I watched you fellers lots of\ntimes from them bushes. I watched you buildin’ that thar dam. I\nswum in it ’fore you did, an’ I uster set an’ smoke in your teepee\nwhen you wasn’t thar, an’ I heerd you talk the time you was fixin’ up\nto steal our Birch bark.”",
        "“Don’t seem to me like it all proves much fortitude. Have you\ngot any presents for the oldest head Chief of the tribe?”",
        "“I’ll get you all the Birch bark you want. I can’t git what you cut,\ncoz me an’ Paw burned that so you couldn’t git it, but I’ll git you\nlots more, an’ maybe–I’ll steal you a chicken once in awhile.”",
        "“His intentions are evidently honourable Let’s take him in on\nsufferance,” said Yan.",
        "“All right,” replied the head Chief, “he kin come in, but that don’t\nspile my claim to that left half of his scalp down to that tuft of\nyellow moss on the scruff of his neck where the collar has wore off\nthe dirt. I’m liable to call for it any time, an’ the ear goes with\nit.”",
        "Guy wanted to treat this as a joke, but Sam’s glittering eyes and\ninscrutable face were centered hungrily on that “yaller tuft” in a way\nthat gave him the “creeps” again.",
        "“Say, Yan–I mean Great Little Beaver–you know all about it, what\nkind o’ stunts did they have to do to get into an Injun tribe,\nanyhow?”",
        "“Different tribes do different ways, but the Sun Dance and the Fire\nTest are the most respectable and both terribly hard.”",
        "“Well, what did you do?” queried the Great Woodpecker.",
        "“Both,” said Yan grinning, as he remembered his sunburnt arms and\nshoulders.",
        "“Quite sure?” said the older Chief in a tone of doubt.",
        "“Yes, sir; and I bore it so well that every one there agreed that\nI was the best one in the Tribe,” said Little Beaver, omitting to\nmention the fact that he was the only one in it. “I was unanimously\nnamed ’Howling Sunrise.’”",
        "“Well, I want to be ’Howling Sunrise,’” piped Guy in his shrill voice.",
        "“You? You don’t know whether you can pass at all, you Yaller\nMossback.”",
        "“Come, Mossy, which will you do?”",
        "Guy’s choice was to be sunburnt to the waist. He was burnt and\nfreckled already to the shoulders, on arms as well as on neck, and his\nmiserable cotton shirt so barely turned the sun’s rays that he was\nelsewhere of a deep yellow tinge with an occasional constellation of\nfreckles. Accordingly he danced about camp all one day with nothing on\nbut his pants, and, of course, being so seasoned, he did not burn.",
        "As the sun swung low the Chiefs assembled in Council.",
        "The head Chief looked over the new Warrior, shook his head gravely and\nsaid emphatically: “Too green to burn. Your name is Sapwood.”",
        "Protest was in vain. “Sappy,” he was and had to be until he won a\nbetter name. The peace pipe was smoked all round and he was proclaimed\nthird War Chief of the Sanger Indians (the word War inserted by\nspecial request).",
        "He was quite the most harmless member of the band and therefore took\nunusual pleasure in posing as the possessor of a perennial thirst for\nhuman heart-blood. War-paint was his delight, and with its aid he was\nsingularly successful in correcting his round and smiling face into\na savage visage of revolting ferocity. Paint was his hobby and his\npride, but alas! how often it happens one’s deepest sorrow is in the\nmidst of one’s greatest joy–the deepest lake is the old crater on top\nof the highest mountain. Sappy’s eyes were not the sinister\nblack beads of the wily Red-man, but a washed-out blue. His ragged,\ntow-coloured locks he could hide under wisps of horsehair, the paint\nitself redeemed his freckled skin, but there was no remedy for the\nwhite eyelashes and the pale, piggy, blue eyes. He kept his sorrow to\nhimself, however, for he knew that if the others got an inkling of his\nfeelings on the subject his name would have been promptly changed\nto “Dolly” or “Birdy,” or some other equally horrible and un-Indian\nappellation.",
        "The Quarrel",
        "“Say, Yan, I saw a Blood-Robin this morning.”",
        "“That’s a new one,” said Yan, in a tone of doubt.",
        "“Well, it’s the purtiest bird in the country.”",
        "“What? A Humming-bird?”",
        "“Na-aw-w-w. They ain’t purty, only small.”",
        "“Well, that shows what you know,” retorted Yan, “’for these exquisite\nwinged gems are at once the most diminutive and brilliantly coloured\nof the whole feathered race.’” This phrase Yan had read some where and\nhis overapt memory had seized on it.",
        "“Pshaw!” said Sam. “Sounds like a book, but I’ll bet I seen hundreds\nof Hummin’-birds round the Trumpet-vine and Bee-balm in the garden,\nan’ they weren’t a millionth part as purty as this. Why, it’s just as\nred as blood, shines like fire and has black wings. The old Witch says\nthe Indians call it a War-bird ’cause when it flew along the trail\nthere was sure going to be war, which is like enough, fur they wuz at\nit all the hull time.”",
        "“Oh, I know,” said Yan. “A Scarlet Tanager. Where did you see it?”",
        "“Why, it came from the trees, then alighted on the highest pole of the\nteepee.”",
        "“Hope there isn’t going to be any war there, Sam. I wish I had one to\nstuff.”",
        "“Tried to get him for you, sonny, spite of the Rules. Could ’a’ done\nit, too, with a gun. Had a shy at him with an arrow an’ I hain’t been\nbird or arrow since. ’Twas my best arrow, too–old Sure-Death.”",
        "“Will ye give me the arrow if I kin find it?” said Guy.",
        "“Now you bet I won’t. What good’d that be to me?”",
        "“Will you give me your chewin’ gum?”",
        "“No.”",
        "“Will you lend it to me?”",
        "“Yep.”",
        "“Well, there’s your old arrow,” said Guy, pulling it from between the\nlogs where it had fallen. “I seen it go there an’ reckoned I’d lay low\nan’ watch the progress of events, as Yan says,” and Guy whinnied.",
        "Early in the morning the Indians in war-paint went off on a prowl.\nThey carried their bows and arrows, of course, and were fully alert,\nstudying the trail at intervals and listening for “signs of the\nenemy.”",
        "Their moccasined feet gave forth no sound, and their keen eyes took in\nevery leaf that stirred as their sinewy forms glided among the huge\ntrunks of the primeval vegetation–at least, Yan’s note-book said they\ndid. They certainly went with very little noise, but they disturbed a\nsmall Hawk that flew from a Balsam-fir–a “Fire tree” they now called\nit, since they had discovered the wonderful properties of the wood.",
        "Three arrows were shot after it and no harm done. Yan then looked into\nthe tree and exclaimed:",
        "“A nest.”",
        "“Looks to me like a fuzz-ball,” said Guy.",
        "“Guess not,” replied Yan. “Didn’t we scare the Hawk off?”",
        "He was a good climber, quite the best of the three, and dropping his\nhead-dress, coat, leggings and weapon, she shinned up the Balsam\ntrunk, utterly regardless of the gum which hung in crystalline drops\nor easily burst bark-bladders on every part.",
        "He was no sooner out of sight in the lower branches than Satan entered\ninto Guy’s small heart and prompted him thus:",
        "“Le’s play a joke on him an’ clear out.”",
        "Sam’s sense of humour beguiled him. They stuffed Yan’s coat and\npants with leaves and rubbish, put them properly together with the\nhead-dress, then stuck one of his own arrows through the breast of the\ncoat into the ground and ran away.",
        "Meanwhile Yan reached the top of the tree and found that the nest was\nonly one of the fuzz-balls so common on Fir trees. He called out to\nhis comrades but got no reply, so came down. At first the ridiculous\ndummy seemed funny, then he found that his coat had been injured and\nthe arrow broken. He called for his companions, but got no answer;\nagain and again, without reply. He went to where they all had intended\ngoing, but if they were there they hid from him, and feeling himself\nscurvily deserted he went back to camp in no very pleasant humour.\nThey were not there. He sat by the fire awhile, then, yielding to his\nhabit of industry, he took off his coat and began to work at the dam.",
        "He became engrossed in his work and did not notice the return of the\nrunaways till he heard a voice saying “What’s this?”",
        "On turning he saw Sam poring over his private note-book and then\nbeginning to read aloud:",
        "  “Kingbird, fearless crested Kingbird\n  Thou art––”",
        "But Yan snatched it out of his hands.",
        "“I’ll bet the rest was something about ’Singbird,’” said Sam.",
        "Yan’s face was burning with shame and anger. He had a poetic streak,\nand was morbidly sensitive about any one seeing its product. The\nKingbird episode of their long evening walk was but one of many\nsimilar. He had learned to delight in these daring attacks of the\nintrepid little bird on the Hawks and Crows, and so magnified them\ninto high heroics until he must try to record them in rhyme. It was\nvery serious to him, and to have his sentiments afford sport to\nthe others was more than he could bear. Of course Guy came out and\ngrinned, taking his cue from Sam. Then he remarked in colourless\ntones, as though announcing an item of general news, “They say there\nwas a fearless-crested Injun shot in the woods to-day.”",
        "The morning’s desertion left Yan in no mood for chaffing. He rightly\nattributed the discourtesy to Guy. Turning savagely toward him he\nsaid, meaningly:",
        "“Now, no more of your sass, you dirty little sneak.”",
        "“I ain’t talkin’ to you,” Guy snickered, and followed Sam into the\nteepee. There were low voices within for a time. Yan went over toward\nthe dam and began to plug mud into some possible holes. Presently\nthere was more snickering in the teepee, then Guy came out alone,\nstruck a theatrical attitude and began to recite to a tree above Yan’s\nhead:",
        "    “Kingbird, fearless crested Kingbird,\n    Thou art but a blooming sing bird–”",
        "But the mud was very handy and Yan hurled a mass that spattered Guy\nthoroughly and sent him giggling into the teepee.",
        "“Them’s the bow-kays,” Sam was heard to say. “Go out an’ git some\nmore; dead sure you deserve ’em. Let me know when the calls for\n’author’ begin?” Then there was more giggling. Yan was fast losing all\ncontrol of himself. He seized a big stick and strode into the teepee,\nbut Sam lifted the cover of the far side and slipped out. Guy tried to\ndo the same, but Yan caught him.",
        "“Here, I ain’t doin’ nothin’.”",
        "The answer was a sounding whack which made him wriggle.",
        "“You let me alone, you big coward. I ain’t doin’ nothin’ to you. You\nbetter let me alone. Sam! S-A-M! S-A-A-A-M!!!” as the stick came down\nagain and again.",
        "“Don’t bother me,” shouted Sam outside. “I’m writin’ poethry–terrible\npartic’lar job, poethry. He only means it in kindness, anyhow.”",
        "Guy was screaming now and weeping copiously.",
        "“You’ll get some more if you give me any more of your lip,” said Yan,\nand stepped out to meet Sam with the note-book again, apparently\nscribbling away. As soon as he saw Yan he stood up, cleared his throat\nand began:",
        "    “Kingbird, fearless crested–”",
        "But he did not finish it. Yan struck him a savage blow on the mouth.\nSam sprang back a few steps. Yan seized a large stone.",
        "“Don’t you throw that at me,” said Sam seriously. Yan sent it with his\ndeadliest force and aim. Sam dodged it and then in self-defense ran at\nYan and they grappled and fought, while Guy, eager for revenge, rushed\nto help Sam, and got in a few trifling blows.",
        "Sam was heavier and stronger than Yan, but Yan had gained wonderfully\nsince coming to Sanger. He was thin, but wiry, and at school he had\nlearned the familiar hip-throw that is as old as Cain and Abel. It was\nall he did know of wrestling, but now it stood him in good stead. He\nwas strong with rage, too–and almost as soon as they grappled he\nfound his chance. Sam’s heels flew up and he went sprawling in the\ndust. One straight blow on the nose sent Guy off howling, and seeing\nSam once more on his feet, Yan rushed at him again like a wild beast.\nA moment later the big boy went tumbling over the bank into the pond.",
        "“_You see if I don’t get you sent about your business from\nhere,” spluttered Sam, now thoroughly angry. “I’ll tell Da you hender\nthe wurruk.” His eyes were full of water and Guy’s were full of stars\nand of tears. Neither saw the fourth party near; but Yan did. There,\nnot twenty yards away, stood William Raften, spectator of the whole\naffair–an expression not of anger but of infinite sorrow and\ndisappointment on his face–not because they had quarrelled–no–he\nknew boy nature well enough not to give that a thought–but that\nhis son, older and stronger than the other and backed by\nanother boy, should be licked in fair fight by a thin, half-invalid.",
        "It was as bitter a pill as he had ever had to swallow. He turned in\nsilence and disappeared, and never afterward alluded to the matter.",
        "[Illustration: “There stood Raften, spectator of the whole affair.\"]",
        "The Peace of Minnie",
        "That night the two avoided each other. Yan ate but little, and to Mrs.\nRaften’s kindly solicitous questions he said he was not feeling well.",
        "After supper they were sitting around the table, the men sleepily\nsilent, Yan and Sam moodily so. Yan had it all laid out in his mind\nnow. Sam would make a one-sided report of the affair; Guy would\nsustain him. Raften himself was witness of Yan’s violence.",
        "The merry days at Sanger were over. He was doomed, and felt like a\ncondemned felon awaiting the carrying out of the sentence. There was\nonly one lively member of the group. That was little Minnie. She was\nbarely three, but a great chatterbox. Like all children, she dearly\nloved a “secret,” and one of her favourite tricks was to beckon to\nsome one, laying her pinky finger on her pinker lips, and then when\nthey stooped she would whisper in their ear, “Don’t tell.” That was\nall. It was her Idea of a “seek-it.”",
        "She was playing at her brother’s knee. He picked her up and they\nwhispered to each other, then she scrambled down and went to Yan. He\nlifted her with a tenderness that was born of the thought that she\nalone loved him now. She beckoned his head down, put her chubby arms\naround his neck and whispered, ’Don’t tell,” then slid down,\nholding her dear innocent little finger warningly before her mouth.",
        "What did it mean? Had Sam told her to do that, or was it a mere\nrepetition of her old trick? No matter, it brought a rush of warm\nfeeling into Yan’s heart. He coaxed the little cherub back and\nwhispered, “No, Minnie, I’ll never tell.” He began to see how crazy he\nhad been. Sam was such a good fellow, he was very fond of him, and he\nwanted to make up; but no–with Sam holding threats of banishment over\nhim, he could not ask for forgiveness. No, he would do nothing but\nwait and see.",
        "He met Mr. Raften again and again that evening and nothing was said.\nHe slept little that night and was up early. He met Mr. Raften\nalone–rather tried to meet him alone. He wanted to have it over with.\nHe was one of the kind not prayed for in the Litany that crave “sudden\ndeath.” But Raften was unchanged. At breakfast Sam was as usual,\nexcept to Yan, and not very different to him. He had a swelling on his\nlip that he said he got “tusslin’ with the boys somehow or nuther.”",
        "After breakfast Raften said:",
        "“Yahn, I want you to come with me to the schoolhouse.”",
        "“It’s come at last,” thought Yan, for the schoolhouse was on the road\nto the railroad station. But why did not Raften say “the station”?\nHe was not a man to mince words. Nothing was said about his handbag\neither, and there was no room for it in the buggy anyway.",
        "Raften drove in silence. There was nothing unusual in that. At length\nhe said:",
        "“Yahn, what’s yer father goin’ to make of ye?”",
        "“An artist,” said Yan, wondering what this had to do with his\ndismissal.",
        "“Does an artist hev to be bang-up eddicated?”",
        "“They’re all the better for it.”",
        "“Av coorse, av coorse, that’s what I tell Sam. It’s eddication that\ncounts. Does artists make much money?”",
        "“Yes, some of them. The successful ones sometimes make millions.”",
        "“Millions? I guess not. Ain’t you stretchin’ it just a leetle?”",
        "“No, sir. Turner made a million. Titian lived in a palace, and so did\nRaphael.”",
        "“Hm. Don’t know ’em, but maybe so–maybe so. It’s wonderful what\neddication does–that’s what I tell Sam.”",
        "They now drew near the schoolhouse. It was holiday time, but the door\nwas open and on the steps were two graybearded men. They nodded to\nRaften. These men were the school trustees. One of them was Char-less\nBoyle; the other was old Moore, poor as a church mouse, but a genial\nsoul, and really put on the Board as a lubricant between Boyle and\nRaften. Boyle was much the more popular. But Raften was always made\ntrustee, for the people knew that he would take extremely good care of\nfunds and school as well as of scholars.",
        "This was a special meeting called to arrange for a new schoolhouse.\nRaften got out a lot of papers, including letters from the Department\nof Education. The School District had to find half the money; the\nDepartment would supply the other half if all conditions were complied\nwith. Chief of these, the schoolhouse had to have a given number of\ncubic feet of air for each pupil. This was very important, but how\nwere they to know in advance if they had the minimum and were not\ngreatly over. It would not do to ask the Department that. They could\nnot consult the teacher, for he was away now and probably would cheat\nthem with more air than was needed. It was Raften who brilliantly\nsolved this frightful mathematical problem and discovered a doughty\nchampion in the thin, bright-eyed child.",
        "“Yahn,” he said, offering him a two-foot rule, “can ye tell me how\nmany foot of air is in this room for every scholar when the seats is\nfull?”",
        "“You mean cubic feet?”",
        "“Le’s see,” and Raften and Moore, after stabbing at the plans with\nhuge forefingers and fumbling cumberously at the much-pawed documents,\nsaid together: “Yes, it says cubic feet.” Yan quickly measured the\nlength of the room and took the height with the map-lifter. The three\ngraybeards gazed with awe and admiration as they saw how surehe seemed. He then counted the seats and said, “Do you count the\nteacher?” The men discussed this point, then decided, “Maybe ye\nbetter; he uses more wind than any of them. Ha, ha!”",
        "Yan made a few figures on paper, then said, “Twenty feet, rather\nbetter.”",
        "“Luk at thot,” said Raften in a voice of bullying and triumph; “jest\nagrees with the Gover’ment Inspector. I towld ye he could. Now\nlet’s put the new buildin’ to test.”",
        "More papers were pawed over.",
        "“Yahn, how’s this–double as many children, one teacher an’ the\nbuildin’ so an’ so.”",
        "Yan figured a minute and said, “Twenty-five feet each.”",
        "“Thar, didn’t I tell ye,” thundered Raften; “didn’t I say that that\ndhirty swindler of an architect was playing us into the conthractor’s\nhands–thought we wuz simple–a put-up job, the hull durn thing. Luk\nat it! They’re nothing but a gang of thieves.”",
        "Yan glanced at the plan that was being flourished in the air.",
        "“Hold on,” he said, with an air of authority that he certainly never\nbefore had used to Raften, “there’s the lobby and cloak-room to come\noff.” He subtracted their bulk and found the plan all right–the\nGovernment minimum of air.",
        "Boyle’s eye had now just a little gleam of triumphant malice. Raften\nseemed actually disappointed not to have found some roguery.",
        "“Well, they’re a shcaly lot, anyhow. They’ll bear watchin’,” he added,\nin tones of self-justification.",
        "“Now, Yahn, last year the township was assessed at $265,000 an’ we\nraised $265 with a school-tax of wan mill on the dollar. This year the\nnew assessment gives $291,400; how much will the same tax raise if\ncost of collecting is same?”",
        "“Two hundred and ninety-one dollars and forty cents,” said Yan,\nwithout hesitation–and the three men sat back in their chairs and\ngasped.",
        "It was the triumph of his life. Even old Boyle beamed in admiration,\nand Raften glowed, feeling that not a little of it belonged to him.",
        "There was something positively pathetic in the simplicity of the three\nshrewd men and their abject reverence for the wonderful scholarship of\nthis raw boy, and not less touching was their absolute faith in his\ninfallibility as a mathematician.",
        "Raften grinned at him in a peculiar, almost a weak way. Yan had never\nseen that expression on his face before, excepting once, and that\nwas as he shook hands with a noted pugilist just after he had won a\nmemorable fight. Yan did not know whether he liked it or not.",
        "On the road home Raften talked with unusual freeness about his plans\nfor his son. (Yan began to realize that the storm had blown over.) He\nharped on his favourite theme, “eddication.” If Yan had only known,\nthat was the one word of comfort that Raften found when he saw his big\nboy go down: “It’s eddication done it. Oh, but he’s fine eddicated.\"\nYan never knew until years afterward, when a grown man and he and\nRaften were talking of the old days, that he had been for some time\nwinning respect from the rough-and-ready farmer, but what finally\nraised him to glorious eminence was the hip-throw that he served that\nday on Sam.",
        "Raften was all right, Yan believed, but what of Sam? They had not\nspoken yet. Yan wished to make up, but it grew harder. Sam had got\nover his wrath and wanted a chance, but did not know how.",
        "He had just set down his two buckets after feeding the pigs when\nMinnie came toddling out.",
        "“Sam! Sam! Take Minnie to ’ide,” then seeing Yan she added, “Yan, you\nmate a tair, tate hold Sam’s hand.”",
        "The queen must be obeyed. Sam and Yan sheepishly grasped hands to make\na queen’s chair for the little lady. She clutched them both around\nthe neck and brought their heads close together. They both loved the\npink-and-white baby between them, and both could talk to her though\nnot to each other. But there is something in touch that begets\ncomprehension. The situation was becoming ludicrous when Sam suddenly\nburst out laughing, then:",
        "“Say, Yan, let’s be friends.”",
        "“I–I want–to–be,” stammered Yan, with tears standing in his eyes.\n\"I’m awfully sorry. I’ll never do it again,”",
        "“Oh, shucks! I don’t care,” said Sam. “It was all that dirty little\nsneak that made the trouble; but never mind, it’s all right. The\nonly thing that worries me is how you sent me flying. I’m bigger an’\nstronger an’ older, I can heft more an’ work harder, but you throwed\nme like a bag o’ shavings, I only wish I knowed how you done it.”",
        "IN THE WOODS",
        "Really in the Woods",
        "“Ye seem to waste a powerful lot o’ time goin’ up an’ down to yer camp;\nwhy don’t ye stay thayer altogether?” said Raften one day, in the\ncolourless style that always worried every one, for they did not know\nwhether it was really meant or was mere sarcasm.",
        "“Suits me. ’Tain’t our choice to come home,” replied his son.",
        "“We’d like nothing better than to sleep there, too,” said Yan.",
        "“Well, why don’t ye? That’s what I’d do if I was a boy playin’ Injun;\nI’d go right in an’ play.”",
        "“_All right now,” drawled Sam (he always drawled in proportion\nto his emphasis), “that suits us; now we’re a-going sure.”",
        "“All right, bhoys,” said Raften; “but mind ye the pigs an’ cattle’s to\nbe ’tended to every day.”",
        "“Is that what ye call lettin’ us camp out–come home to work jest the\nsame?”",
        "“No, no, William,” interposed Mrs. Raften; “that’s not fair. That’s no\nway to give them a holiday. Either do it or don’t. Surely one of the\nmen can do the chores for a month.”",
        "“Month–I didn’t say nothin’ about a month.”",
        "“Well, why don’t you now?”",
        "“Whoi, a month would land us into harvest,” and William had the air of\na man at bay, finding them all against him.",
        "“I’ll do Yahn’s chores for a fortnight if he’ll give me that thayer\npictur he drawed of the place,” now came in Michel’s voice from\nthe far end of the table–\"except Sunday,” he added, remembering a\nstanding engagement, which promised to result in something of vast\nimportance to him.",
        "“Wall, I’ll take care o’ them Sundays,” said Si Lee.",
        "“Yer all agin me,” grumbled William with comical perplexity. “But\nbhoys ought to be bhoys. Ye kin go.”",
        "“Whoop!” yelled Sam.",
        "“Hooray!” joined in Yan, with even more interest though with less\nunrestraint.",
        "“But howld on, I ain’t through–”",
        "“I say, Da, we want your gun. We can’t go camping without a gun.”",
        "“Howld on, now. Give me a chance to finish. Ye can go fur two weeks,\nbut ye got to go; no snakin’ home nights to sleep. Ye can’t hev\nno matches an’ no gun. I won’t hev a lot o’ children foolin’ wid a\ndidn’t-know-it-was-loaded, an’ shootin’ all the birds and squirrels\nan’ each other, too. Ye kin hev yer bows an’ arrows an’ ye ain’t\nlikely to do no harrum. Ye kin hev all the mate an’ bread an’ stuff\nye want, but ye must cook it yerselves, an’ if I see any signs of\nsettin’ the Woods afire I’ll be down wid the rawhoide an’ cut the\nvery livers out o’ ye.”",
        "The rest of the morning was devoted to preparation, Mrs. Raften taking\nthe leading hand.",
        "“Now, who’s to be cook?” she asked.",
        "“Sam\"–\"Yan\"–said the boys in the same breath.",
        "“Hm! You seem in one mind about it. Suppose you take it turn and turn\nabout–Sam first day.”",
        "Then followed instructions for making coffee in the morning, boiling\npotatoes, frying bacon. Bread and butter enough they were to take with\nthem–eggs, too.",
        "“You better come home for milk every day or every other day, at\nleast,” remarked the mother.",
        "“We’d ruther steal it from the cows in the pasture,” ventured Sam,\n\"seems naturaler to me Injun blood.”",
        "“If I ketch ye foolin’ round the cows or sp’ilin’ them the fur’ll\nfly,” growled Raften.",
        "“Well, kin we hook apples and cherries?” and Sam added in explanation;\n\"they’re no good to us unless they’re hooked.”",
        "“Take all the fruit ye want.”",
        "“An’ potatoes?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“An’ aigs?”",
        "“Well, if ye don’t take more’n ye need.”",
        "“An’ cakes out of the pantry? Indians do that.”",
        "“No; howld on now. That is a good place to draw the line. How are ye\ngoin’ to get yer staff down thayer? It’s purty heavy. Ye see thayer\nare yer beds an’ pots an’ pans, as well as food.”",
        "“We’ll have to take a wagon to the swamp and then carry them on our\nbacks on the blazed trail,” said Sam, and explained “our backs” by\npointing to Michel and Si at work in the yard.",
        "“The road goes as far as the creek,” suggested Yan; “let’s make a raft\nthere an’ take the lot in it down to the swimming-pond; that’d be real\nInjun.”",
        "“What’ll ye make the raft of?” asked Raften.",
        "“Cedar rails nailed together,” answered Sam.",
        "“No nails in mine,” objected Yan; “that isn’t Injun.”",
        "“An’ none o’ my cedar rails fur that. ’Pears to me it’d be less work\nan’ more Injun to pack the stuff on yer backs an’ no risk o’ wettin’\nthe beds.”",
        "So the raft was given up, and the stuff was duly carted to the creek’s\nside. Raften himself went with it. He was a good deal of a boy at\nheart and he was much in sympathy with the plan. His remarks showed\na mixture of interest, and doubt as to the wisdom of letting himself\ntake so much interest.",
        "“Hayre, load me up,” he said, much to the surprise of the boys, as\nthey came to the creek’s edge. His broad shoulders carried half of the\nload. The blazed trail was only two hundred yards long, and in two\ntrips the stuff was all dumped down in front of the teepee.",
        "Sam noted with amusement the unexpected enthusiasm of his father.\n\"Say, Da, you’re just as bad as we are. I believe you’d like to join\nus.”",
        "“’Moinds me o’ airly days here,” was the reply, with a wistful note in\nhis voice. “Many a night me an’ Caleb Clark slep’ out this way on this\nvery crick when them fields was solid bush. Do ye know how to make a\nbed?”",
        "“Don’t know a thing,” and Sam winked at Yan. “Show us.”",
        "“I’ll show ye the rale thing. Where’s the axe?”",
        "“Haven’t any,” said Yan. “There’s a big tomahawk and a little\ntomahawk.”",
        "Raften grinned, took the big “tomahawk” and pointed to a small Balsam\nFir. “Now there’s a foine bed-tree.”",
        "“Why, that’s a fire-tree, too,” said Yan, as with two mighty strokes\nRaften sent it toppling down, then rapidly trimmed it of its flat\ngreen boughs. A few more strokes brought down a smooth young Ash and\ncut it into four pieces, two of them seven feet long and two of them\nfive feet. Next he cut a White Oak sapling and made four sharp pegs\neach two feet long.",
        "“Now, boys, whayer do you want yer bed?” then stopping at a thought\nhe added, “Maybe ye didn’t want me to help–want to do everything\nyerselves?”",
        "“Ugh, bully good squaw. Keep it up–wagh!” said his son and heir, as\nhe calmly sat on a log and wore his most “Injun brave” expression of\nhaughty approval.",
        "The father turned with an inquiring glance to Yan, who replied:",
        "“We’re mighty glad of your help. You see, we don’t know how. It seems\nto me that I read once the best place in the teepee is opposite the\ndoor and a little to one side. Let’s make it here.” So Raften placed\nthe four logs for the sides and ends of the bed and drove in the\nground the four stakes to hold them. Yan brought in several armfuls of\nbranches, and Raften proceeded to lay them like shingles, beginning at\nthe head-log of the bed and lapping them very much. It took all the\nfir boughs, but when all was done there was a solid mass of soft green\ntips a foot thick, all the butts being at the ground.",
        "“Thayer,” said Raften, “that’s an Injun feather bed an’ safe\nan’ warrum. Slapin’ on the ground’s terrible dangerous, but that’s all\nright. Now make your bed on that.” Sam and Yan did so, and when it was\nfinished Raften said: “Now, fetch that little canvas I told yer ma to\nput in; that’s to fasten to the poles for an inner tent over the bed.”",
        "Yan stood still and looked uncomfortable.",
        "“Say, Da, look at Yan. He’s got that tired look that he wears when the\nrules is broke.”",

        "“Indians don’t have them that I ever heard of,” said Little Beaver.",
        "“Yan, did ye iver hear of a teepee linin’ or a dew-cloth?”",
        "“Yes,” was the answer, in surprise at the unexpected knowledge of the\nfarmer.",
        "“Do ye know what they’re like?”",
        "“No–at least–no–”",
        "“Well, I do; that’s what it’s like. That’s something I do know,\nfur I seen old Caleb use wan.”",
        "“Oh, I remember reading about it now, and they are like that, and it’s\non them that the Indians paint their records. Isn’t that bully,” as he\nsaw Raften add two long inner stakes which held the dew-cloth like a\ncanopy.",
        "“Say, Da, I never knew you and Caleb were hunting together. Thought ye\nwere jest natural born enemies.”",
        "“Humph!” grunted Raften. “We wuz chums oncet. Never had no fault to\nfind till we swapped horses.”",
        "“Sorry you ain’t now, ’cause he’s sure sharp in the woods.”",
        "“He shouldn’t a-tried to make an orphan out o’ you.”",
        "“Are you sure he done it?”",
        "“If ’twasn’t him I dunno who ’twas. Yan, fetch some of them pine knots\nthayer.”",
        "Yan went after the knots; it was some yards into the woods, and out\nthere he was surprised to see a tall man behind a tree. A second’s\nglance showed it to be Caleb. The Trapper laid one finger on his lips\nand shook his head. Yan nodded assent, gathered the knots, and went\nback to the camp, where Sam continued:",

        "The First Night and Morning",
        "It was a strange new feeling that took possession of the boys as they\nsaw Mr. Raften go, and when his step actually died away on the blazed\ntrail they felt that they were really and truly alone in the woods and\ncamping out. To Yan it was the realization of many dreams, and the\nweirdness of it was helped by the remembrance of the tall old man he\nhad seen watching them from behind the trees. He made an excuse to\nwander out there, but of course Caleb was gone.",
        "“Fire up,” Sam presently called out. Yan was the chief expert with the\nrubbing-sticks, and within a minute or two he had the fire going in\nthe middle of the teepee and Sam set about preparing the evening meal.\nThis was supposed to be Buffalo meat and Prairie roots (beef and\npotatoes). It was eaten rather quietly, and then the boys sat down on\nthe opposite sides of the fire. The conversation dragged, then died\na natural death; each was busy with his thoughts, and there was,\nmoreover, an impressive and repressive something or other all around\nthem. Not a stillness, for there were many sounds, but beyond those\na sort of voiceless background that showed up all the myriad voices.\nSome of these were evidently Bird, some Insect, and a few were\nrecognized as Tree-frog notes. In the near stream were sounds of\nsplashing or a little plunge.",
        "“Must be Mushrat,” whispered Sam to the unspoken query of his friend.",
        "A loud, far “Oho-oho-oho” was familiar to both as the cry of the\nHorned Owl, but a strange long wail rang out from the trees overhead.",
        "“What’s that?”",
        "“Don’t know,” was all they whispered, and both felt very\nuncomfortable. The solemnity and mystery of the night was on them\nand weighing more heavily with the waning light. The feeling was\noppressive. Neither had courage enough to propose going to the house\nor their camping would have ended. Sam arose and stirred the fire,\nlooked around for more wood, and, seeing none, he grumbled (to\nhimself) and stepped outside in the darkness to find some. It was not\ntill long afterward that he admitted having had to dare himself\nto step out into the darkness. He brought in some sticks and fastened\nthe door as tightly as possible. The blazing fire in the teepee was\ncheering again. The boys perhaps did not realize that there was\nactually a tinge of homesickness in their mood, yet both were thinking\nof the comfortable circle at the house. The blazing fire smoked a\nlittle, and Sam said:",
        "“Kin you fix that to draw? You know more about it ’an me.”",
        "Yan now forced himself to step outside. The wind was rising and had\nchanged. He swung the smoke poles till the vent was quartering down,\nthen hoarsely whispered, “How’s that?”",
        "“That’s better,” was the reply in a similar tone, though there was no\nobvious difference yet.",
        "He went inside with nervous haste and fastened up the entrance.",
        "“Let’s make a good fire and go to bed.”",
        "So they turned in after partly undressing, but not to sleep for hours.\nYan in particular was in a state of nervous excitement. His heart had\nbeaten violently when he went out that time, and even now that mysterious\ndread was on him. The fire was the one comfortable thing. He dozed off,\nbut started up several times at some slight sound. Once it was a peculiar\n\"_Tick, tick, scr-a-a-a-a-pe, lick-scra-a-a-a-a-a-pe,” down the teepee\nover his head. ’A Bear_” was his first notion, but on second thoughts\nhe decided it was only a leaf sliding down the canvas. Later he was\nroused by a ’Scratch, scratch, scratch_” close to him. He listened\nsilently for some time. This was no leaf; it was an animal! Yes,\nsurely–it was a Mouse. He slapped the canvas violently and “hissed\"\ntill it went away, but as he listened he heard again that peculiar\nwail in the tree-tops. It almost made his hair sit up. He reached out\nand poked the fire together into a blaze. All was still and in time he\ndozed off. Once more he was wide awake in a flash and saw Sam sitting\nup in bed listening.",
        "[Illustration: “Where’s the axe?\"]",
        "“What is it, Sam?” he whispered.",

        "Sam woke slowly, but knowing perfectly where he was, and drawled:",
        "“Get up yourself. You’re cook to-day, an’ I’ll take my breakfast in\nbed. Seems like my knee is broke out again.”",
        "“Oh, get up, and let’s have a swim before breakfast.”",
        "“No, thank you, I’m too busy just now; ’sides, it’s both cold and wet\nin that pond, this time o’ day.”",
        "The morning was fresh and bright; many birds were singing, although it\nwas July, a Red-eyed Vireo and a Robin were in full song; and as Yan\nrose to get the breakfast he wondered why he had been haunted by such\nstrange feelings the night before. It was incomprehensible now. He\nwished that appalling wail in the tree-tops would sound again, so he\nmight trace it home.",
        "There still were some live coals in the ashes, and in a few minutes he\nhad a blazing fire, with the pot boiling for coffee, and the bacon in\nthe fryer singing sweetest music for the hungry.",
        "Sam lay on his back watching his companion and making critical\nremarks.",
        "“You may be an A1 cook–at least, I hope you are, but you don’t know\nmuch about fire-wood,” said he. “Now look at that,” as one huge spark\nafter another exploded from the fire and dropped on the bed and the\nteepee cover.",
        "“How can I help it?”",
        "“I’ll bet Da’s best cow against your jack-knife you got some Ellum or\nHemlock in that fire.”",
        "“Well, I have,” Yan admitted, with an air of surrender.",
        "“My son,” said the Great Chief Woodpecker, “no sparking allowed in the\nteepee. Beech, Maple, Hickory or Ash never spark. Pine knots an’ roots\ndon’t, but they make smoke like–like–oh–you know. Hemlock, Ellum,\nChestnut, Spruce and Cedar is public sparkers, an’ not fit for dacint\nteepee sassiety. Big Injun heap hate noisy, crackling fire. Enemy hear\nthat, an’–an’–it burns his bedclothes.”",
        "“All right, Grandpa,” and the cook made a mental note, then added in\ntones of deadly menace, “You get up now, do you understand!” and he\npicked up a bucket of water.",
        "“That might scare the Great Chief Woodpecker if the Great Chief Cook\nhad a separate bed, but now he smiles kind o’ scornful,” was all the\nsatisfaction he got. Then seeing that breakfast really was ready,\nSam scrambled out a few minutes later. The coffee acted like an\nelixir–their spirits rose, and before the meal was ended it would\nhave been hard to find two more hilarious and enthusiastic campers.\nEven the vague terrors of the night were now sources of amusement.",

        "“Well, it’s just like this. If it was at school or any other place I\nwouldn’t be bothered with the dirty little cuss, but out in the woods\nlike this one feels kind o’ friendly, an’ three’s better than two.\nBesides, he has been admitted to the Tribe already.”",
        "“Yes, that’s what I say. Let’s give him a yell.”",
        "So the boys uttered a long yell, produced by alternating the voice\nbetween a high falsetto and a natural tone. This was the “yell,” and\nhad never failed to call Guy forth to join them unless he had some\nchore on hand and his “Paw” was too near to prevent his renegading to\nthe Indians. He soon appeared waving a branch, the established signal\nthat he came as a friend.",
        "He came very slowly, however, and the boys saw that he limped\nfrightfully, helping himself along with a stick. He was barefoot, as\nusual, but his left foot was swaddled in a bundle of rags.",
        "“Hello, Sappy; what happened? Out to Wounded Knee River?”",
        "“Nope. Struck luck. Paw was bound I’d ride the Horse with the scuffler\nall day, but he gee’d too short an’ I arranged to tumble off’n him,\nan’ Paw cuffled me foot some. Law! how I did holler! You should ’a’\nheard me.”",

        "“Yesterday about four.”",
        "“Exactly. We heard an awful screech and Yan says, says he, ’There’s\nthe afternoon train at Kelly’s Crossing, but ain’t she late?’",
        "“’Train!’ says I. ’Pooh. I’ll bet that’s Guy Burns getting a new\nlicking.’”",
        "“Guess I’ll well up now,” said War Chief Sapwood, so stripped his\nfoot, revealing a scratch that would not have cost a thought had he\ngot it playing ball. He laid the rags away carefully and with them\nevery trace of the limp, then entered heartily into camp life.",
        "The vast advantage of being astir early now was seen. There were\nSquirrels in every other tree, there were birds on every side, and\nwhen they ran to the pond a wild Duck spattered over the surface and\nwhistled out of sight.",
        "“What you got?” called Sam, as he saw Yan bending eagerly over\nsomething down by the pond.",
        "Yan did not answer, and so Sam went over and saw him studying out a\nmark in the mud. He was trying to draw it in his note-book.",
        "“What is it?” repeated Sam.",
        "“Don’t know. Too stubby for a Muskrat, too much claw for a Cat, too\nsmall for a Coon, too many toes for a Mink.”",
        "“I’ll bet it’s a Whangerdoodle.”",
        "Yan merely chuckled in answer to this.",
        "“Don’t you laugh,” said the Woodpecker, solemnly, “You’d be more apt\nto cry if you seen one walk into the teepee blowing the whistle at the\nend of his tail. Then it’d be, ’Oh, Sam, where’s the axe?’”",
        "“Tell you what I do believe it is,” said Yan, not noticing this\nterrifying description; “it’s a Skunk.”",
        "“Little Beaver, my son! I thought I would tell you, then I sez to\nmeself, ’No; it’s better for him to find out by his lone. Nothing like\na struggle in early life to develop the stuff in a man. It don’t do to\nhelp him too much,’ sez I, an’ so I didn’t.”",
        "Here Sam condescendingly patted the Second War Chief on the head and\nnodded approvingly. Of course he did not know as much about the track\nas Yan did, but he prattled on:",
        "“Little Beaver! you’re a heap struck on tracks–Ugh–good! You kin\ntell by them everything that passes in the night. Wagh! Bully! You’re\nlikely to be the naturalist of our Tribe. But you ain’t got gumption.\nNow, in this yer hunting-ground of our Tribe there is only one place\nwhere you can see a track, an’ that is that same mud-bank; all the\nrest is hard or grassy. Now, what I’d do if I was a Track-a-mist, I’d\ngive the critters lots o’ chance to leave tracks. I’d fix it all\nround with places so nothing could come or go ’thout givin’ us his\nimpressions of the trip. I’d have one on each end of the trail coming\nin, an’ one on each side of the creek where it comes in an’ goes out.”",
        "“Well, Sam, you have a pretty level head. I wonder I didn’t think of\nthat myself.”",
        "“My son, the Great Chief does the thinking. It’s the rabble–that’s\nyou and Sappy–that does the work.”",
        "But all the same he set about it at once with Yan, Sappy following\nwith a slight limp now. They removed the sticks and rubbish for\ntwenty feet of the trail at each end and sprinkled this with three\nor four inches of fine black loam. They cleared off the bank of the\nstream at four places, one at each side where it entered the woods,\nand one at each side where it went into the Burns’s Bush.",
        "“Now,” said Sam, “there’s what I call visitors’ albums like the one\nthat Phil Leary’s nine fatties started when they got their brick house\nand their swelled heads, so every one that came in could write their\nnames an’ something about ’this happy, happy, ne’er-to-be-forgotten\nvisit’–them as could write. Reckon that’s where our visitors get the\nstart, for all of ours kin write that has feet.”",
        "“Wonder why I didn’t think o’ that,” said Yan, again and again. “But\nthere’s one thing you forget,” he said. “We want one around the\nteepee.”",
        "This was easily made, as the ground was smooth and bare there, and\nSappy forgot his limp and helped to carry ashes and sand from the\nfire-hole. Then planting his broad feet down in the dust, with many\nsnickers, he left some very interesting tracks.",
        "“I call that a bare track” said Sam.",
        "“Go ahead and draw it,” giggled Sappy",
        "“Why not?” and Yan got out his book.",
        "“Bet you can’t make it life-size,” and Sam glanced from the little\nnote-book to the vast imprint.",
        "After it was drawn, Sam said, “Guess I’ll peel off and show you a\nhuman track.” He soon gave an impression of his foot for the artist,\nand later Yan added his own; the three were wholly different.",
        "“Seems to me it would be about right, if you had the ways the toes\npointed and the distance apart to show how long the legs wuz.”",
        "Again Sam had given Yan a good idea. From that time he noted these two\npoints and made his records much better.",
        "“Air you fellers roostin’ here now?” said Sappy in surprise, as he\nnoted the bed as well as the pots and pans.",
        "“Yep.”",
        "“Well, I wanter, too. If I kin git hol’ o’ Maw ’thout Paw, it’ll be\nO.K.”",
        "“You let on we don’t want you and Paw’ll let you come. Tell him\nOle Man Raften ordered you off the place an’ he’ll fetch you here\nhimself.”",
        "“I guess there’s room enough in that bed fur three,” remarked the\nThird War Chief.",
        "“Well, I guess there ain’t,” said Woodpecker. “Not when the third one\nwon first prize for being the dirtiest boy in school. You can get\nstuff an’ make your own bed, across there on the other side the fire.”",
        "“Don’t know how.”",
        "“We’ll show you, only you’ll have to go home for blankets an’ grub.”",
        "The boys soon cut a Fir-bough bed, but Guy put off going home for the\nblankets as long as he could. He knew and they suspected that there\nwas no chance of his rejoining them again that day. So after sundown\nhe replaced his foot-rags and limped down the trail homeward, saying,\n\"I’ll be back in a few minutes,” and the boys knew perfectly well that\nhe would not.",
        "The evening meal was over; they had sat around wondering if the night\nwould repeat its terrors. An Owl “Hoo-hoo-ed” in the trees. There was\na pleasing romance in the sound. The boys kept up the fire till about\nten, then retired, determined that they would not be scared this time.\nThey were barely off to sleep when the most awful outcry arose in the\nnear woods, like “a Wolf with a sore throat,” then the yells of a\nhuman being in distress. Again the boys sat up in fright. There was a\nscuffling outside–a loud and terrified “Hi–hi–hi–Sam!” Then an\nattack was made on the door. It was torn open, and in tumbled Guy. He\nwas badly frightened; but when the fire was lighted and he calmed down\na little he confessed that Paw had sent him to bed, but when all was\nstill he had slipped out the window, carrying the bedclothes. He was\nnearly back to the camp when he decided to scare the boys by letting\noff a few wolfish howls, but he made himself very scary by doing it,\nand when a wild answer came from the tree-tops–a hideous, blaring\nscreech–he lost all courage, dropped the bedding, and ran toward the\nteepee yelling for help.",
        "The boys took torches presently and went nervously in search of the\nmissing blankets. Guy’s bed was made and in an hour they were once\nmore asleep.",
        "In the morning Sam was up and out first. From the home trail he\nsuddenly called:",
        "“Yan, come here.”",
        "“Do you mean me?” said Little Beaver, with haughty dignity.",
        "“Yep, Great Chief; git a move on you. Hustle out here. Made a find. Do\nyou see who was visiting us last night while we slept?” and he pointed\nto the “album” on the inway. “I hain’t shined them shoes every week\nwith soot off the bottom of the pot without knowin’ that one pair of\n’em was wore by Ma an’ one of ’em by Da. But let’s see how far they\ncome. Why, I orter looked round the teepee before tramplin’ round.\"\nThey went back, and though the trails were much hidden by their own,\nthey found enough around the doorway to show that during the night, or\nmore likely late in the evening, the father and mother had paid them a\nvisit in secret–had inspected the camp as they slept, but finding no\none stirring and the boys breathing the deep breath of healthy sleep,\nthey had left them undisturbed.",
        "“Say, boys–I mean Great Chiefs–what we want in camp is a Dog, or one\nof these nights some one will steal our teeth out o’ our heads an’ we\nwon’t know a thing till they come back for the gums. All Injun camps\nhave Dogs, anyway.”",
        "The next morning the Third War Chief was ordered out by the Council,\nfirst to wash himself clean, then to act as cook for the day. He\ngrumbled as he washed, that “’Twan’t no good–he’d be all dirty again\nin two minutes,” which was not far from the truth. But he went at the\ncooking with enthusiasm, which lasted nearly an hour. After this he\ndid not see any fun in it, and for once he, as well as the others,\nbegan to realize how much was done for them at home. At noon Sappy set\nout nothing but dirty dishes, and explained that so long as each got\nhis own it was all right. His foot was very troublesome at meal time\nalso. He said it was the moving round when he was hurrying that made\nit so hard to bear, but in their expedition with bows and arrows later\non he found complete relief.",
        "“Say, look at the Red-bird,” he shouted, as a Tanager flitted onto a\nlow branch and blazed in the sun. “Bet I hit him first shot!” and he\ndrew an arrow.",
        "“Here you, Saphead,” said Sam, “quit that shooting at little birds.\nIt’s bad medicine. It’s against the rules; it brings bad luck–it\nbrings awful bad luck. I tell you there ain’t no worse luck than Da’s\nraw-hide–that I know.”",
        "“Why, what’s the good o’ playin’ Injun if we can’t shoot a blame\nthing?” protested Sappy.",
        "“You kin shoot Crows an’ Jays if you like, an’ Woodchucks, too.”",
        "“I know where there’s a Woodchuck as big as a Bear.”",
        "“Ah! What size Bear?”",
        "“Well, it is. You kin laugh all you want to. He has a den in our\nclover field, an’ he made it so big that the mower dropped in an’\nthrowed Paw as far as from here to the crick.”",
        "“An’ the horses, how did they get out?”",
        "“Well! It broke the machine, an’ you should have heard Paw swear. My!\nbut he was a socker. Paw offered me a quarter if I’d kill the old\nwhaler. I borrowed a steel trap an’ set it in the hole, but he’d dig\nout under it an’ round it every time. I’ll bet there ain’t anything\nsmarter’n an old Woodchuck.”",
        "“Is he there yet?” asked War Chief No. 2.",
        "“You just bet he is. Why, he has half an acre of clover all eat up.”",
        "“Let’s try to get him,” said Yan. “Can we find him?”",
        "“Well, I should say so. I never come by but I see the old feller. He’s\nso big he looks like a calf, an’ so old an’ wicked he’s gray-headed.”",
        "“Let’s have a shot at him,” suggested the Woodpecker. “He’s fair game.\nMaybe your Paw’ll give us a quarter each if we kill him.”",
        "Guy snickered. “Guess you don’t know my Paw,” then he giggled\nbubblously through his nose again.",
        "Arrived at the edge of the clover, Sam asked, “Where’s your\nWoodchuck?”",
        "“Right in there.”",
        "“I don’t see him.”",
        "“Well, he’s always here.”",
        "“Not now, you bet.”",
        "“Well, this is the very first time I ever came here and didn’t see\nhim. Oh, I tell you, he’s a fright. I’ll bet he’s a blame sight\nbigger’n that stump.”",
        "“Well, here’s his track, anyway,” said Woodpecker, pointing to some\ntracks he had just made unseen with his own broad palm.",
        "“Now,” said Sappy, in triumph. “Ain’t he an old socker?”",
        "“Sure enough. You ain’t missed any cows lately, have you? Wonder you\nain’t scared to live anyways near!”",
        "A “Massacree” of Palefaces",
        "“Say, fellers, I know where there’s a stavin’ Birch tree–do you want\nany bark?”",
        "“Yes, I want some,” said Little Beaver.",
        "“But hold on; I guess we better not, coz it’s right on the edge o’ our\nbush, an’ Paw’s still at the turnips.”",
        "“Now if you want a real war party,” said the Head Chief, “let’s\nmassacree the Paleface settlement up the crick and get some milk.\nWe’re just out, and I’d like to see if the place has changed any.”",
        "So the boys hid their bows and arrows and headdresses, and, forgetting\nto take a pail, they followed in Indian file the blazed trail,\ncarefully turning in their toes as they went and pointing silently to\nthe track, making signs of great danger. First they crawled up, under\ncover of one of the fences, to the barn. The doors were open and men\nworking at something. A pig wandered in from the barnyard. Then the\nboys heard a sudden scuffle, and a squeal from the pig as it scrambled\nout again, and Raften’s voice: “Consarn them pigs! Them boys ought to\nbe here to herd them.” This was sufficiently alarming to scare the\nWarriors off in great haste. They hid in the huge root-cellar and\nthere held a council of war.",
        "“Here, Great Chiefs of Sanger,” said Yan, “behold I take three straws.\nThat long one is for the Great Woodpecker, the middle size is for\nLittle Beaver, and the short thick one with the bump on the end and\na crack on top is Sappy. Now I will stack them up in a bunch and let\nthem fall, then whichever way they point we must go, for this is Big\nMedicine.”",
        "So the straws fell. Sam’s straw pointed nearly to the house, Yan’s a\nlittle to the south of the house, and Guy’s right back home.",
        "“Aha, Sappy, you got to go home; the straw says so.”",
        "“I ain’t goin’ to believe no such foolishness.”",
        "“It’s awful unlucky to go against it.”",
        "“I don’t care, I ain’t goin’ back,” said Guy doggedly.",
        "“Well, my straw says go to the house; that means go scouting for milk,\nI reckon.”",
        "Yan’s straw pointed toward the garden, and Guy’s to the residence and\ngrounds of “J.G. Burns, Esq.”",
        "“I don’t care,” said Sappy, “I ain’t goin’. I am goin’ after some\nof them cherries in your orchard, an’ ’twon’t be the first time,\nneither.”",
        "“We kin meet by the Basswood at the foot of the lane with whatever\nwe get,” said the First War Chief, as he sneaked into the bushes and\ncrawled through the snake fence and among the nettles and manure\nheaps on the north side of the barnyard till he reached the woodshed\nadjoining the house. He knew where the men were, and he could guess\nwhere his mother was, but he was worried about the Dog. Old Cap might\nbe on the front doorstep, or he might be prowling at just the wrong\nplace for the Injun plan. The woodshed butted on the end of the\nkitchen. The milk was kept in the cellar, and one window of the cellar\nopened into a dark corner of the woodshed. This was easily raised, and\nSam scrambled down into the cool damp cellar. Long rows of milk pans\nwere in sight on the shelves. He lifted the cover of the one he knew\nto be the last put there and drank a deep, long draught with his mouth\ndown to it, then licked the cream from his lips and remembered that he\nhad come without a pail. But he knew where to get one. He went\ngently up the stairs, avoiding steps Nos. 1 and 7 because they were\n\"creakers,” as he found out long ago, when he used to ’hook’ maple\nsugar from the other side of the house. The door at the top was closed\nand buttoned, but he put his jack-knife blade through the crack and\nturned the button. After listening awhile and hearing no sound in the\nkitchen, he gently opened the squeaky old door. There was no one to\nbe seen but the baby, sound asleep in her cradle. The outer door was\nopen, but no Dog lying on the step as usual. Over the kitchen was a\ngarret entered by a trap-door and a ladder. The ladder was up and the\ntrap-door open, but all was still. Sam stood over the baby, grunted,\n\"Ugh, Paleface papoose,” raised his hand as if wielding a war club,\naimed a deadly blow at the sleeping cherub, then stooped and kissed\nher rosy mouth so lightly that her pink fists went up to rub it at\nonce. He now went to the pantry, took a large pie and a tin pail,\nthen down into the cellar again. He, at first, merely closed the door\nbehind him and was leaving it so, but remembered that Minnie might\nawaken and toddle around till she might toddle into the cellar,\ntherefore he turned the button so that just a corner showed over the\ncrack, closed the door and worked with his knife blade on that corner\ntill the cellar was made as safe as before. He now escaped with his\npie and pail.",
        "Meanwhile his mother’s smiling face beamed out of the dark loft. Then\nshe came down the ladder. She had seen him come and enter the cellar,\nby chance she was in the loft when he reached the kitchen, but she had\nkept quiet to enjoy the joke.",
        "Next time the Woodpecker went to the cellar he found a paper with this\non it: ’Notice to hostile Injuns–Next time you massacree this\nsettlement, bring back the pail, and don’t leave the covers off the\nmilk pans.”",
        "Yan had followed the fence that ran south of the house. There was\nplenty of cover, but he crawled on hands and knees, going right down\non his breast when he came to places more open than the rest. In this\nway he had nearly reached the garden when he heard a noise behind and,\nturning, he saw Sappy.",
        "“Here, what are you following me for? Your straw pointed the other\nway. You ain’t playing fair.”",
        "“Well, I don’t care, I ain’t going home. You fixed it up so my\nstraw would point that way. It ain’t fair, an’ I won’t do it.”",
        "“You got no right following me.”",
        "“I ain’t following you, but you keep going just the place I want to\ngo. It’s you following me, on’y keepin’ ahead. I told you I was after\ncherries.”",
        "“Well, the cherries are that way and I’m going this way, and I don’t\nwant you along.”",
        "“You couldn’t get me if you wanted me.”",
        "“Erh––”",
        "“Erh––”",
        "So Sappy went cherryward and Yan waited awhile, then crawled toward\nthe fruit garden. After twenty or thirty yards more, he saw a gleam of\nred, then under it a bright yellow eye glaring at him. He had chanced\non a hen sitting on her nest. He came nearer, she took alarm and ran\naway, not clucking, but cackling loudly. There were a dozen eggs of\ntwo different styles, all bright and clean, and the hen’s comb was\nbright red. Yan knew hens. This was easy to read: Two stray hens\nlaying in one nest, and neither of them sitting yet.",
        "“So ho! Straws show which way the hens go.”",
        "He gathered up the eggs into his hat and crawled back toward the tree\nwhere all had to meet.",
        "But before he had gone far he heard a loud barking, then yells for\nhelp, and turned in time to see Guy scramble up a tree while Cap, the\nold Collie, barked savagely at him from below. Now that he was in no\ndanger Sappy had the sense to keep quiet. Yan came back as quickly\nas possible. The Dog at once recognized and obeyed him, but\ndoubtless was much puzzled to make out why he should be pelted back to\nthe house when he had so nobly done his duty by the orchard.",
        "“Now, you see, maybe next time you’ll do what the medicine straw tells\nyou. Only for me you’d been caught and fed to the pigs, sure.”",
        "“Only for you I wouldn’t have come. I wasn’t scared of your old Dog,\nanyway. Just in about two minutes more I was comin’ down to kick the\nstuffin’ out o’ him myself.”",
        "“Perhaps you’d like to go back and do it now. I’ll soon call him.”",
        "“Oh, I hain’t got time now, but some other time–Let’s find Sam.”",
        "So they foregathered at the tree, and laden with their spoils, they\nreturned gloriously to camp.",
        "The Deer Hunt",
        "That evening they had a feast and turned in to sleep at the usual\nhour. The night passed without special alarm. Once about daylight\nSappy called them, saying he believed there was a Bear outside, but\nhe had a trick of grinding his teeth in his sleep, and the other boys\ntold him that was the Bear he heard.",
        "Yan went around to the mud albums and got some things he could\nnot make out and a new mark that gave him a sensation. He drew it\ncarefully. It was evidently the print of a small sharp hoof. This was\nwhat he had hungered for so long. He shouted, “Sam–Sam–Sapwood, come\nhere; here’s a Deer track.”",
        "The boys shouted back, “Ah, what you givin’ us now!” “Call off your\nDog!” and so forth.",
        "But Yan persisted. The boys were so sure it was a trick that they\nwould not go for some time, then the sun had risen high, shining\nstraight down on the track instead of across, so it became very dim.\nSoon the winds, the birds and the boys themselves helped to wipe it\nout. But Yan had his drawing, and persisted in spite of the teasing\nthat it was true.",
        "At length Guy said aside to Sam: “Seems to me a feller that hunts\ntracks so terrible serious ought to see the critter some time.\n’Tain’t right to let him go on sufferin’. I think he ought to\nsee that Deer. We ought to help him.” Here he winked a volley or two\nand made signs for Sam to take Yan away.",
        "This was easily done.",
        "“Let’s see if your Deer went out by the lower mud album.” So they\nwalked down that way, while Guy got an old piece of sacking, stuffed\nit with grass, and, hastily tying it in the form of a Deer’s head,\nstuck it on a stick. He put in two flat pieces of wood for ears, took\ncharcoal and made two black spots for eyes and one for a nose, then\naround each he drew a ring of blue clay from the bed of the brook.\nThis soon dried and became white. Guy now set up this head in the\nbushes, and when all was ready he ran swiftly and silently through the\nwood to find Sam and Yan. He beckoned vigorously and called under\nhis voice: “Sam–Yan–a Deer! Here’s that there Deer that made them\ntracks, I believe.”",
        "Guy would have failed to convince Yan if Sam had not looked so much\ninterested. They ran back to the teepee, got their bows and arrows,\nthen, guided by Guy, who, however, kept back, they crawled to where he\nhad seen the Deer.",
        "“There–there, now, ain’t he a Deer? There–see him move!”",
        "Yan’s first feeling was a most exquisite thrill of pleasure. It was\nlike the uplift of joy he had had the time he got his book, but was\nstronger. The savage impulse to kill came quickly, and his bow was in\nhis hand, but he hesitated.",
        "“Shoot! Shoot!” said Sam and Guy.",
        "Yan wondered why they did not shoot. He turned, and in spite of\nhis agitation he saw that they were making fun of him. He glanced at\nthe Deer again, moved up a little closer and saw the trick.",
        "Then they hooted aloud. Yan was a little crestfallen. Oh, it had been\nsuch an exquisite feeling! The drop was long and hard, but he rallied\nquickly.",
        "“I’ll shoot your Deer for you,” he said, and sent an arrow close under\nit.",
        "“Well, I kin beat that,” and Sam and Guy both fired. Sam’s arrow stuck\nin the Deer’s nose. At that he gave a yell; then all shot till the\nhead was stuck full of arrows, and they returned to the teepee to\nget dinner. They were still chaffing Yan about the Deer when he said\nslowly to Guy:",
        "“Generally you are not so smart as you think you are, but this time\nyou’re smarter. You’ve given me a notion.”",
        "So after dinner he got a sack about three feet long and stuffed it\nfull of dry grass; then he made a small sack about two and a half feet\nlong and six inches thick, but with an elbow in it and pointed at one\nend. This he also stuffed with hay and sewed with a bone needle to the\nbig sack. Next he cut four sticks of soft pine for legs and put them\ninto the four corners of the big sack, wrapping them with bits of\nsacking to be like the rest. Then he cut two ears out of flat sticks;\npainted black eyes and nose with a ring of white around each, just as\nSappy had done, but finally added a black spot on each side of the\nbody, and around that a broad gray hand. Now he had completed what\nevery one could see was meant for a Deer.",
        "The other boys helped a little, but not did cease to chaff him.",
        "“Who’s to be fooled this time?” asked Guy.",
        "“You,” was the answer.",
        "“I’ll bet you’ll get buck fever the first time you come across it,\"\nchuckled the Head Chief.",
        "“Maybe I will, but you’ll all have a chance. Now you fellers stay here\nand I’ll hide the Deer. Wait till I come back.”",
        "So Yan ran off northward with the dummy, then swung around to the east\nand hid it at a place quite out of the line that he first took. He\nreturned nearly to where he came out, shouting “Ready!”",
        "Then the hunters sallied forth fully armed, and Yan explained: “First\nto find it counts ten and has first shot. If he misses, next one can\nwalk up five steps and shoot; if he misses, next walks five steps\nmore, and so on until the Deer is hit. Then all the shooting must be\ndone from the place where that arrow was fired. A shot in the heart\ncounts ten; in the gray counts five; that’s a body wound–and a hit\noutside of that counts one–that’s a scratch. If the Deer gets away\nwithout a shot in the heart, then I count twenty-five, and the first\none to find it is Deer for next hunt–twelve shots each is the limit.”",
        "The two hunters searched about for a long time. Sam made disparaging\nremarks about the trail this Deer did not leave, and Guy\nsneaked and peaked in every thicket.",
        "Sappy was not an athlete nor an intellectual giant, but his little\npiggy eyes were wonderfully sharp and clear.",
        "“I see him,” he yelled presently, and pointed out the place\nseventy-five yards away where he saw one ear and part of the head.",
        "“Tally ten for Sappy,” and Yan marked it down.",
        "Guy was filled with pride at his success. He made elaborate\npreparation to shoot, remarking, “I could ’a’ seen it twicet as\nfar–if–if–if–it was–if I had a fair chance.”",
        "He drew his bow and left fly. The arrow went little more than half\nway. So Sam remarked, “Five steps up I kin go. It don’t say nothing\nabout how long the steps?”",
        "“No.”",
        "“Well, here goes,” and he began the most wonderful Kangaroo hops that\nhe could do. He covered about thirty feet in those five steps, and by\nswerving a little aside he got a good view of the Deer. He was now\nless than sixty-five yards away. He fired and missed. Now Guy had the\nright to walk up five steps. He also missed. Finally at thirty yards\nSam sent an arrow close past a tree, deep in the Deer’s gray flank.",
        "“Bully shot! Body wound! Count five for the Great War Chief. All\nshooting from this spot now,” said Yan, “and I don’t know why I\nshouldn’t shoot as well as the others.”",
        "“Coz you’re the Deer and that’d be suicide,” was Sam’s objection. “But\nit’s all right. You won’t hit.”",
        "The objection was not sustained, and Yan tried his luck also. Two or\nthree shots in the brown of the Deer’s haunch, three or four into the\ntree that stood half way between, but nearly in line, a shot or two\ninto the nose, then “Hooray!” a shot from Guy right into the Deer’s\nheart put an end to the chase. Now they went up to draw and count the\narrows.",
        "Guy was ahead with a heart shot, ten, a body wound, five, and a\nscratch, one, that’s sixteen, with ten more for finding it–twenty-six\npoints. Sam followed with two body wounds and two scratches–twelve\npoints, and Yan one body wound and five scratches–ten points. The\nDeer looked like an old Porcupine when they came up to it, and Guy,\nbursting with triumph, looked like a young Emperor.",
        "“I tell you it takes me to larn you fellers to Deer hunt. I’ll bet\nI’ll hit him in the heart first thing next time.”",
        "“I’ll bet you won’t, coz you’ll be Deer and can’t shoot till we both\nhave.”",
        "Guy thought this the finest game he had ever played. He pranced away\nwith the dummy on his back, scheming as he went to make a puzzle for\nthe others. He hid the Deer in a dense thicket east of the camp, then\nsneaked around to the west of the camp and yelled “Ready!” They had a\nlong, tedious search and had to give it up.",
        "“Now what to do? Who counts?” asked the Woodpecker.",
        "“When Deer escapes it counts twenty-five,” replied the inventer of the\ngame; and again Guy was ahead.",
        "“This is the bulliest game I ever seen” was his ecstatic remark.",
        "“Seems to me there’s something wrong; that Deer ought to have a\ntrail.”",
        "“That’s so,” assented Yan. “Wonder if he couldn’t drag an old root!”",
        "“If there was snow it’d be easy.”",
        "“I’ll tell you, Sam; we’ll tear up paper and leave a paper trail.”",
        "“Now you’re talking.” So all ran to camp. Every available scrap of\nwrapping paper was torn up small and put in a “scent bag.”",
        "Since no one found the Deer last time, Guy had the right to hide it\nagain.",
        "He made a very crooked trail and a very careful hide, so that the boys\nnearly walked onto the Deer before they saw it about fifteen yards\naway. Sam scored ten for the find. He fired and missed. Yan now\nstepped up his five paces and fired so hastily that he also missed.\nGuy now had a shot at it at five yards, and, of course, hit the Deer\nin the heart. This succession of triumphs swelled his head nearly to\nthe bursting point, and his boasting passed all bounds. But it now\nbecame clear that there must be a limit to the stepping up. So the new\nrule was made, “No stepping up nearer than fifteen paces.”",
        "The game grew as they followed it. Its resemblance to real hunting was\nvery marked. The boys found that they could follow the trail, or sweep\nthe woods with their eyes as they pleased, and find the game, but the\nwisest way was a combination. Yan was too much for the trail, Sam\ntoo much for the general lookout, but Guy seemed always in luck. His\nlittle piglike eyes took in everything, and here at length he found a\ndepartment in which he could lead. It looked as though little pig-eyed\nGuy was really cut out for a hunter. He made a number of very clever\nhidings of the Deer. Once he led the trail to the pond, then, across,\nand right opposite he put the Deer in full view, so that they saw it\nat once in the open; they were obliged either to shoot across the\npond, or step farther away round the edge, or step into the deep\nwater, and again Guy scored. It was found necessary to bar hiding the\nDeer on a ridge and among stones, because in one case arrows which\nmissed were lost in the bushes and in the other they were broken.",
        "They played this game so much that they soon found a new difficulty.\nThe woods were full of paper trails, and there was no means of\ndeciding which was the old and which the new. This threatened to end\nthe fun altogether. But Yan hit on the device of a different colour\nof paper. This gave them a fresh start, but their supply was limited.\nThere was paper everywhere in the woods now, and it looked as though\nthe game was going to kill itself, when old Caleb came to pay them a\nvisit. He always happened round as though it was an accident, but the\nboys were glad to see him, as he usually gave some help.",
        "“Ye got some game, I see,” and the old man’s eye twinkled as he noted\nthe dummy, now doing target duty on the forty-yard range. “Looks like\nthe real thing. Purty good–purty good.” He chuckled as he learned\nabout the Deer hunt, and a sharp observer might have discerned a\nslight increase of interest when he found that it was not Sam Raften\nthat was the “crack” hunter.",
        "“Good fur you, Guy Burns. Me an’ your Paw hev hunted Deer together on\nthis very crik many a time.”",
        "When he learned the difficulty about the scent, he said “Hm,” and\npuffed at his pipe for awhile in silence. Then at length:",
        "“Say, Yan, why don’t you and Guy get a bag o’ wheat or Injun corn for\nscent: that’s better than paper, an’ what ye lay to-day is all clared\nup by the birds and Squirrels by to-morrow.”",
        "“Bully!” shouted Sam. (He had not been addressed at all, but he was\nnot thin-skinned.) Within ten minutes he had organized another “White\nmassacree\"–that is, a raid on the home barn, and in half an hour he\nreturned with a peck of corn.",
        "“Now, lemme be Deer,” said Caleb. “Give me five minutes’ start, then\nfollow as fast as ye like. I’ll show ye what a real Deer does.”",
        "He strode away bearing the dummy, and in five minutes as they set out\non the trail he came striding back again. Oh, but that seemed a long\nrun. The boys followed the golden corn trail–a grain every ten feet\nwas about all they needed now, they were so expert. It was a straight\nrun for a time, then it circled back till it nearly cut itself again\n(at X, page 298). The boys thought it did so, and claimed the right to\nknow, as on a real Deer trail you could tell. So Caleb said, “No, it\ndon’t cut the old trail.” Where, then, did it go? After beating about,\nSam said that the trail looked powerful heavy, like it might be\ndouble.",
        "“Bet I know,” said Guy. “He’s doubled back,” which was exactly what he\ndid do, though Caleb gave no sign. Yan looked back on the trail and\nfound where the new one had forked. Guy gave no heed to the ground\nonce he knew the general directions. He ran ahead (toward Y), so did\nSam, but Guy glanced back to Yan on the trail to make sure of the\nline.",
        "They had not gone far beyond the nearest bushes before Yan found\nanother quirk in the trail. It doubled back at Z. He unravelled the\ndouble, glanced around, and at O he plainly saw the Deer lying on\nits side in the grass. He let off a triumphant yell, “Yi, yi, yi,\nDeer!” and the others came running back just in time to see Yan\nsend an arrow straight into its heart.",
        "WAR BONNET, TEEPEE AND COUPS",
        "Forty yards and first shot. Well, that’s what the Injuns would call a\n’_grand coup,’ and Caleb’s face wore the same pleasant look as\nwhen he made the fire with rubbing-sticks.",
        "“What’s a grand coup?_” asked Little Beaver.",
        "“Oh, I suppose it’s a big deed. The Injuns call a great feat a\n’_coup,’ an’ an extra big one a ’grand coup.’ Sounds like\nFrench, an’ maybe ’tis, but the Injuns says it. They had a regular way\nof counting their coup, and for each they had the right to an\nEagle feather in their bonnet, with a red tuft of hair on the end for\nthe extra good ones. At least, they used to. I reckon now they’re\nforgetting it all, and any buck Injun wears just any feather he can\nsteal and stick in his head.”",
        "“What do you think of our head-dresses?” Yan ventured.",
        "’Hm! You ain’t never seen a real one or you wouldn’t go at them that\nway at all. First place, the feathers should all be white with black\ntips, an’ fastened not solid like that, but loose on a cap of soft\nleather. Each feather, you see, has a leather loop lashed on the quill\nend for a lace to run through and hold it to the cap, an’ then a\nstring running through the middle of each feather to hold it–just so.\nThen there are ways of marking each feather to show how it was got.\nI mind once I was out on a war party with a lot of Santees–that’s a\nbrand of Sioux–an’ we done a lot o’ sneaking an’ stealing an’ scalped\nsome of the enemy. Then we set out for home, and when we was still\nabout thirty miles away we sent on an Injun telegram of good luck. The\nleader of our crowd set fire to the grass after he had sent two men\nhalf a mile away on each side to do the same thing, an’ up went three\nbig smokes. There is always some one watching round an Injun village,\nan’ you bet when they seen them three smokes they knowed that we wuz\na-coming back with scalps.",
        "“The hull Council come out to meet us, but not too reckless, coz this\nmight have been the trick of enemies to surprise them.",
        "“Well, when we got there, maybe there wasn’t a racket. You see, we\ndidn’t lose a man, and we brung in a hundred horses and seven scalps.\nOur leader never said a word to the crowd, but went right up to the\nCouncil teepee. He walked in–we followed. There was the Head Chief\nan’ all the Council settin’ smoking. Our leader give the ’How,\nan’ then we all ’Howed.’ Then we sat an’ smoked, an’ the Chief\ncalled on our leader for an account of the little trip. He stood up\nan’ made a speech.",
        "“’Great Chief and Council of my Tribe,’ says he. ’After we left the\nvillage and the men had purified themselves, we travelled seven days\nand came to the Little Muddy River. There we found the track of a\ntravelling band of Arapaho. In two days we found their camp, but\nthey were too strong for us, so we hid till night; then I went alone\ninto their camp and found that some of them were going off on a hunt\nnext day. As I left I met a lone warrior coming in. I killed him\nwith my knife. For that I claim a coup; and I scalped him–for\nthat I claim another coup; an’ before I killed him I slapped his\nface with my hand–for this I claim a grand coup; and I brought\nhis horse away with me–for that I claim another coup. Is it not\nso,’ sez he, turning to us, and we all yelled ’How! How! How!_’\nFor this fellow, ’Whooping Crane,’ was awful good stuff. Then the\nCouncil agreed that he should wear three Eagle feathers, the first\nfor killing and scalping the enemy in his own camp–that was a grand\ncoup, and the feather had a tuft of red hair on it an’ a red spot on\nthe web. The next feather was for slapping the feller’s face first,\nwhich, of course, made it more risky. This Eagle feather had a red\ntuft on top an’ a red hand on the web; the one for stealing the horse\nhad a horseshoe, but no tuft, coz it wasn’t counted A1.",
        "“Then the other Injuns made their claims, an’ we all got some kind of\nhonours. I mind one feller was allowed to drag a Fox tail at each\nheel when he danced, an’ another had ten horseshoe marks on an Eagle\nfeather for stealing ten horses, an’ I tell you them Injuns were\nprouder of them feathers than a general would be of his medals.”",

Many a hot night on the\nplains I’ve been woke up by hearing ’Tap-tap-tap’ all around me in the\nstill black night and wondered why all the squaws was working, but\nthey was up to drop the cover and drive all the pegs deeper, an’\nwithin a half hour there never failed to come up a big storm. How they\nknew it was a-comin’ I never could tell. One old woman said a Coyote\ntold her, an’ maybe that’s true, for they do change their song for\ntrouble ahead; another said it was the flowers lookin’ queer at\nsundown, an’ another had a bad dream.

Then I said, ’Why don’t you get Bull-calf’s squaw to\nput up their big teepee? I tell you that’s a howler.’ So off he goes,\nand after dickering awhile he got the squaw to put it up for three\ndollars. You bet it was a stunner, sure–all painted red, with green\nan’ yaller–animals an’ birds an’ scalps galore. It made that\nfeller’s eyes bug out to see it. He started in to make some\nportygrafs, then was taking another by hand, so as to get the colours,\nan’ I bet it would have crowded him to do it, but jest when he got\na-going the old squaw yelled to the other–the Chief hed two of\nthem–an’ lighted out to take down that there teepee. That artist he\nhollered to stop, said he had hired it to stay up an’ a bargain was a\nbargain. But the old squaw she jest kept on a-jabberin’ an’ pintin’ at\nthe west. Pretty soon they had the hull thing down and rolled up an’\nthat artist a-cussin’ like a cow-puncher. Well, I mind it was a fine\nday, but awful hot, an’ before five minutes there come a little dark\ncloud in the west, then in ten minutes come a-whoopin’ a regular small\ncyclone, an’ it went through that village and wrecked all the teepees\nof any size.

        "“I want to know about war bonnets,” Yan now put in. “I mean about\nthings to do to wear feathers–that is, things we can do.”",
        "“Ye kin have races, an’ swimmin’ an bownarrer shootin’. I should say\nif you kin send one o’ them arrers two hundred yards that would kill a\nBuffalo at twenty feet. I’d think that was pretty good. Yes, I’d call\nthat way up.”",
        "“What–a grand coup?_”",
        "“Yes, I reckon; an’ if you fell short on’y fifty yards that’d still\nkill a Deer, an’ we could call that a coup. If,” continued\nCaleb, “you kin hit that old gunny-sack buck plunk in the heart at\nfifty yards first shot I’d call that away up; an’ if you hit it at\nseventy-five yards in the heart no matter how many tries, I’d call\nyou a shot. If you kin hit a nine-inch bull’s-eye two out of three at\nforty yards every time an’ no fluke, you’d hold your own among Injuns\nthough I must say they don’t go in much for shooting at a target. They\nshoot at ’most anything they see in the woods. I’ve seen the little\ncopper-coloured kids shooting away at butterflies. Then they have\nmatches–they try who can have most arrers in the air at one time. To\nhave five in the air at once is considered good. It means powerful\nfast work and far shooting. You got to hold a bunch handy in the left\nhand fur that. The most I ever seen one man have up at once was eight.\nThat was reckoned ’big medicine,’ an’ any one that can keep up seven\nis considered swell.”",

One player takes five rings an’ five nuts an’ sets\nthem around on the squares of one set, an’ don’t let the other see\ntill all is ready; then the other turns an’ looks at it while some one\nelse sings a little song that one of the boys turned into:",

        "“Here, you let me alone. I ain’t bragging. I’m only telling the simple\ntruth.”",
        "“Ugh! Better tell some simple lies, then–much safer,” said the Great\nWoodpecker, with horrid calm and meaning. “If ever I lift that scalp\nyou’ll catch cold and die, do ye know it?”",
        "Again Yan could see that Caleb had to look far away to avoid taking an\napparent interest.",
        "“There’s another game. I don’t know as it’s Injun, but it’s the kind\no’ game where an Injun could win. They first made two six-inch\nsquares of white wood or card, then on each they made rings like a\ntarget or squares like the quicksight game, or else two Rabbits the\nsame on each. One feller takes six spots of black, half an inch\nacross, an’ sticks them on one, scattering anyhow, an’ sets it up a\nhundred yards off; another feller takes same number of spots an’ the\nother Rabbit an’ walks up till he can see to fix his Rabbit the same.\nIf he kin do it at seventy-five yards he’s a swell; if he kin do it at\nsixty yards he’s away up, but less than fifty yards is no good. I seen\nthe boys have lots o’ fun out o’ it. They try to fool each other every\nway, putting one spot right on another or leaving some off. It’s a\nsure ’nough test of good eyes.”",
        "“I’ll bet–” began Sappy again, but a loud savage “Grrrr” from\nSam, who knew perfectly well what was coming, put a stop to the bet,\nwhatever it was.",
        "“There was two other Injun tests of eyes that I mind now. Some old\nBuck would show the youngsters the Pleiades–them’s the little stars\nthat the Injuns call the Bunch–an’ ask ’How many kin you see?’ Some\ncould sho’ly see five or six an’ some could make out seven. Them as\nsees seven is mighty well off for eyes. Ye can’t see the Pleiades\nnow–they belong to the winter nights; but you kin see the Dipper the\nhull year round, turning about the North Star. The Injuns call this\nthe ’Broken Back,’ an’ I’ve heard the old fellers ask the boys: ’You\nsee the Old Squaw–that’s the star, second from the end, the one at\nthe bend of the handle–well, she has a papoose on her back. Kin you\nsee the papoose?’ an’ sure enough, when my eyes was real good I could\nsee the little baby star tucked in by the big un. It’s a mighty good\ntest of eyes if you kin see that.”",
        "“Eh–” began Guy.",
        "But “Grrrrrrrrr” from Sam stopped him in time. Again Caleb’s eyes\nwandered afar. Then he stepped out of the teepee and Yan heard him\nmutter, “Consarn that whelp, he makes me laugh spite o’ myself.\"\nHe went off a little way into the woods and presently called “Yan!\nGuy! Come here.” All three ran out. “Talking about eyes, what’s\nthat?” An opening in the foliage gave a glimpse of the distant\nBurns’s clover field. “Looks like a small Bear.”",
        "“Woodchuck! That’s our Woodchuck! That’s the ole sinner that throwed\nPaw off’n the mower. Where’s my bone-arrer?” and Guy went for his\nweapons.",
        "The boys ran for the fence of the clover field, going more cautiously\nas they came near. Still the old Woodchuck heard something and sat up\nerect on his haunches. He was a monster, and out on the smooth clover\nfield he did look like a very small Bear. His chestnut breast was\ncuriously relieved by his unusually gray back and head.",

        "So all drew together, standing in a row like an old picture of the\nbattle of Crecy. The arrows scattered about the Woodchuck.

        "“No.”",
        "Caleb went into the teepee, felt the blankets, then grunted: “H-m!\nJest so. They’re nigh soppin’. You turn in night after night an’ sweat\nan’ sweat in them blankets an’ wonder why they’re damp. Hain’t you\nseen your ma air the blankets every day at home? Every Injun squaw\nknows that much, an’ every other day at least she gives the blankets a\nsun roast for three hours in the middle of the day, or, failing that,\ndries them at the fire. Dry out your blankets and you won’t have no\nmore chills.”",
        "The boys set about it at once, and that night they experienced again\nthe sweet, warm sleep of healthy youth.",
        "There was another lesson they had to learn in campercraft. The\nMosquitoes were always more or less of a plague. At night they forced\nthe boys into the teepee, but they soon learned to smudge the insects\nwith a wad of green grass on the hot fire. This they would throw on\nat sundown, then go outside, closing the teepee tight and eat supper\naround the cooking fire. After that was over they would cautiously\nopen the teepee to find the grass all gone and the fire low, a dense\ncloud of smoke still in the upper part, but below it clear air.\nThey would then brush off the Mosquitoes that had alighted on their\nclothes, crawl into the lodge and close the door tight. Not a Mosquito\nwas left alive in it, and the smoke hanging about the smoke-vent was\nenough to keep them from coming in, and so they slept in peace. Thus\nthey could baffle the worst pest of the woods. But there was yet\nanother destroyer of comfort by day, and this was the Blue-bottle\nflies. There seemed more of them as time went on, and they laid masses\nof yellowish eggs on anything that smelled like meat or corruption.\nThey buzzed about the table and got into the dishes; their dead,\ndrowned and mangled bodies were polluting all the food, till Caleb\nremarked during one of his ever-increasing visits: “It’s your own\nfault. Look at all the filth ye leave scattered about.”",
        "There was no blinking the fact; for fifty feet around the teepee the\nground was strewn with scraps of paper, tins and food. To one side\nwas a mass of potato peelings, bones, fish-scales and filth, and\neverywhere were the buzzing flies, to be plagues all day, till at\nsundown the Mosquitoes relieved them and took the night shift of the\noffice of torment.",
        "“I want to learn, especially if it’s Injun,” said Little Beaver. “What\nhad we best do?”",
        "“Wall, first ye could move camp; second, ye could clean this.”",
        "As there was no other available camp ground they had no choice, and\nYan said with energy: “Boys, we got to clean this and keep it clean,\ntoo. We’ll dig a hole for everything that won’t burn.”",
        "So Yan seized the spade and began to dig in the bushes not far from\nthe teepee. Sam and Guy were gradually drawn in. They began gathering\nall the rubbish and threw it into the hole. As they tumbled in bones,\ntins and scraps of bread Yan said: “I just hate to see that bread go\nin. It doesn’t seem right when there’s so many living things would be\nglad to get it.”",
        "At this, Caleb, who was sitting on a log placidly smoking, said:",
        "“Now, if ye want to be real Injun, ye gather all the eatables ye don’t\nwant–meat, bread and anything, an’ every day put it on some\nhigh place. Most generally the Injuns has a rock–they call it\nWakan; that means sacred medicine–an’ there they leave scraps\nof food to please the good spirits. Av coorse it’s the birds and\nSquirrels gets it all; but the Injun is content as long as it’s gone,\nan’ if ye argy with them that ’tain’t the spirits gets it, but the\nbirds, they say: ’That doesn’t matter. The birds couldn’t get it if\nthe spirits didn’t want them to have it,’ or maybe the birds took it\nto carry to the spirits!”",
        "Then the Grand Council went out in a body to seek the Wakan\nRock. They found a good one in the open part of the woods, and it\nbecame a daily duty of one to carry the remnants of food to the rock.\nThey were probably less acceptable to the wood creatures than they\nwould have been half a year later, but they soon found that there were\nmany birds glad to eat at the Wakan; and moreover, that before\nlong there was a trail from the brook, only twenty-five yards away,\nthat told of four-foots also enjoying the bounty of the good spirits.",
        "Within three days of this the plague of Bluebottles was over, and the\nboys realized that, judging by its effects, the keeping of a dirty\ncamp is a crime.",
        "One other thing old Caleb insisted on: “Yan,” said he, “you didn’t\nought to drink that creek water now; it ain’t hardly runnin’. The sun\nhez it het up, an’ it’s gettin’ too crawly to be healthy.”",
        "“Well, what are we going to do?” said Sam, though he might as well\nhave addressed the brook itself.",
        "“What can we do, Mr. Clark?”",
        "“Dig a well!”",
        "“Phew! We’re out here for fun!” was Sam’s reply.",
        "“Dig an Injun well,” Caleb said. “Half an hour will do it. Here, I’ll\nshow you.”",
        "He took the spade and, seeking a dry spot, about twenty feet from the\nupper end of the pond he dug a hole some two feet square. By the time\nhe was down three feet the water was oozing in fast. He got it down\nabout four feet and then had to stop, on account of inflow. He took a\nbucket and bailed the muddy stuff out right to the bottom, and let it\nfill up to be again bailed out. After three bailings the water came in\ncold, sweet, and pure as crystal.",
        "“There,” said he, “that water is from your pond, but it is filtered\nthrough twenty feet of earth and sand. That’s the way to get cool,\npure water out of the dirtiest of swamps. That’s an Injun well.”",
        "The Indian Drum",
        "  “Oh, that hair of horse and skin of sheep should\n  Have such power to move the souls of men.”",
        "“If you were real Injun you’d make a drum of that,” said Caleb to\nYan, as they came to a Basswood blown over by a recent storm and now\nshowing its weakness, for it was quite hollow–a mere shell.",
        "“How do they do it? I want to know how.”",
        "“Get me the axe.”",
        "Yan ran for the axe. Caleb cut out a straight unbroken section about\ntwo feet long. This they carried to camp.",
        "“Coorse ye know,” said Caleb, “ye can’t have a drum without skins for\nheads.”",
        "“What kind of skins?”",
        "“Oh, Horse, Dog, Cow, Calf–’most any kind that’s strong enough.”",
        "“I got a Calfskin in our barn, an’ I know where there’s another in the\nshed, but it’s all chawed up with Rats. Them’s mine. I killed them\nCalves. Paw give me the skins for killin’ an’ skinnin’ them. Oh, you\njest ought to see me kill a Calf–”",
        "Guy was going off into one of his autopanegyrics when Sam who was now\nbeing rubbed on a sore place, gave a “Whoop!” and grabbed the tow-tuft\nwith a jerk that sent the Third War Chief sprawling and ended the\npanegyric in the usual volley of “you-let-me-’lones.”",
        "“Oh, quit, Sam,” objected Little Beaver. “You can’t stop a Dog\nbarking. It’s his nature.” Then to Guy: “Never mind, Guy; you are not\nhurt. I’ll bet you can beat him hunting Deer, and you can see twice as\nfar as he can.”",
        "“Yes, I kin; that’s what makes him so mad. I’ll bet I kin see three\ntimes as far–maybe five times,” was the answer in injured tones.",
        "“Go on now, Guy, and get the skins–that is, if you want a drum for\nthe war dance. You’re the only one in the crowd that’s man enough to\nmake the raise of a hide,” and fired by this flattery, Guy sped away.",
        "Meanwhile Caleb worked on the hollow log. He trimmed off the bark,\nthen with the hatchet he cleared out all the punk and splinters\ninside. He made a fire on the ground in the middle of the drum-log as\nit stood on end, and watching carefully, he lifted it off from time to\ntime and chopped away all the charred parts, smoothing and trimming\ntill he had the log down thin and smooth within and without. They\nheard Guy shouting soon after he left. They thought him near at hand,\nbut he did not come. Trimming the drum-log took a couple of hours, and\nstill Guy did not return. The remark from Caleb, “’Bout ready for the\nskins now!” called from Sam the explanation, “Guess Old Man Burns\nsnapped him up and put him to weeding the garden. Probably that was\nhim we heard gettin’ licked.”",
        "“Old Man Burns” was a poor and shiftless character, a thin,\nstoop-shouldered man. He was only thirty-five years of age, but, being\nmarried, that was enough to secure for him the title “Old Man.” In\nSanger, if Tom Nolan was a bachelor at eighty years of age he would\nstill be Tom Nolan, “wan of the bhoys,” but if he married at twenty he\nat once became “Old Man Nolan.”",
        "Mrs. Burns had produced the usual string of tow-tops, but several had\ndied, the charitable neighbours said of starvation, leaving Guy, the\neldest, his mother’s darling, then a gap and four little girls, four,\nthree, two and one years of age. She was a fat, fair, easy-going\nperson, with a general sense of antagonism to her husband, who was,\nof course, the natural enemy of the children. Jim Burns cherished the\nideal of bringing “that boy” up right–that is, getting all the work\nhe could out of him–and Guy clung to his own ideal of doing as little\nwork as possible. In this clash of ideals Guy’s mother was his firm,\nthough more or less secret, ally. He was without fault in her eyes:\nall that he did was right. His freckled visage and pudgy face were\ntypes of noble beauty, standards of comeliness and human excellence;\nhis ways were ways of pleasantness and all his paths were peace;\nMargat Burns was sure of it.",
        "Burns had a good deal of natural affection, but he was erratic;\nsometimes he would flog Guy mercilessly for nothing, and again laugh\nat some serious misdeed, so that the boy never knew just what to\nexpect, and kept on the safe side by avoiding his “Paw” as much as\npossible. His visits to the camp had been thoroughly disapproved,\npartly because it was on Old Man Raften’s land and partly because it\nenabled Guy to dodge the chores. Burns had been quite violent about it\nonce or twice, but Mrs. Burns had the great advantage of persistence,\nand like the steady strain of the skilful angler on the slender line,\nit wins in the end against the erratic violence of the strongest\ntrout. She had managed then that Guy should join the Injun camp, and\ngloried in his outrageously exaggerated accounts of how he could lick\nthem all at anything, “though they wuz so much older’n bigger’n he\nwuz.”",
        "But on this day he was fallen in hard luck. His father saw him coming,\nmet him with a “gad” and lashed him furiously. Knowing perfectly well\nthat the flogging would not stop till the proper effect was produced,\nand that was to be gauged by the racket, Guy yelled his loudest. This\nwas the uproar the boys had heard.",
        "“Now, ye idle young scut! I’ll larn ye to go round leaving bars down.\nYou go an’ tend to your work.” So instead of hiking back gloriously\nladen with Calfskins, Guy was sent to ignominious and un-Injun toil in\nthe garden.",
        "Soon he heard his mother: “Guysie, Guysie.” He dropped his hoe and\nwalked to the kitchen.",
        "“Where you goin’?” roared his father from afar. “Go back and mind your\nwork.”",
        "“Maw wants me. She called me.”",
        "“You mind your work. Don’t you dar’ on your life to go thayer.”",
        "But Guy took no notice and walked on to his mother. He knew that at\nthis post-thrashing stage of wrath his father was mouthy and harmless,\nand soon he was happy eating a huge piece of bread and jam.",
        "“Poor dear, you must be hungry, an’ your Paw was so mean to\nyou. There, now, don’t cry,” for Guy began to weep again at the\nrecollection of his wrongs. Then she whispered confidentially: “Paw’s\ngoing to Downey’s this afternoon, an’ you can slip away as soon as\nhe’s gone, an’ if you work well before that he won’t be so awful mad\nafter you come back. But be sure you don’t let down the bars, coz if\nthe pig was to get in Raften’s woods dear knows what.”",
        "This was the reason of Guy’s delay. He did not return to camp with the\nskins till late that day. As soon as he was gone, his foolish, doting\nmother, already crushed with the burden of the house, left everything\nand hoed two or three extra rows of cabbages, so “Paw” should find a\ngreat showing of work when he came back.",
        "The Calfskins were hard as tin and, of course, had the hair on.",
        "Caleb remarked, “It’ll take two or three days to get them right,” and\nburied them in a marshy, muddy pool in the full sunlight. “The warmer\nthe better.”",
        "Three days later he took them out. Instead of being thin, hard,\nyellow, semi-transparent, they now were much thicker, densely white,\nand soft as silk. The hair was easily scraped off and the two pieces\nwere pronounced all right for drumheads.",
        "Caleb washed them thoroughly in warm water, with soap to clear off\nthe grease, scraping them on both sides with a blunt knife; then he\nstraightened the outer edge of the largest, and cut a thin strip\nround and round it till he had some sixty feet of rawhide line, about\nthree-quarters of an inch wide. This he twisted, rolled and stretched\nuntil it was nearly round, then he cut from the remainder a circular\npiece thirty inches across, and a second from the “unchawed” part of\nthe other skin. He laid these one on the other, and with the sharp\npoint of a knife he made a row of holes in both, one inch from the\nedge and two inches apart. Then he set one skin on the ground, the\ndrum-log on that and the other skin on the top, and bound them\ntogether with the long lace, running it from hole No. 1 on the top\nto No. 2 on the bottom, then to No. 3 on the top, and No. 4 on the\nbottom, and so on twice around, till every hole had a lace through it\nand the crossing laces made a diamond pattern all around. At first\nthis was done loosely, but tightened up when once around, and\nfinally both the drum-heads were drawn tense. To the surprise of all,\nGuy promptly took possession of the finished drum. “Them’s my\nCalfskins,” which, of course, was true.",
        "And Caleb said, with a twinkle in his eye, “The wood seems to\ngo with the skins.”",
        "A drumstick of wood, with a piece of sacking lashed on to soften it,\nwas made, and Guy was disgusted to find how little sound the drum gave\nout.",
        "“’Bout like pounding a fur cap with a lamb’s tail,” Sam thought.",
        "“You hang that up in the shade to dry and you’ll find a change,” said\nthe Trapper.",
        "It was quite curious to note the effect of the drying as the hours\nwent by. The drum seemed to be wracking and straining itself in\nthe agony of effort, and slight noises came from it at times. When\nperfectly dry the semi-transparency of the rawhide came back, and the\nsound now was one to thrill the Red-man’s heart.",
        "Caleb taught them a little Indian war chant, and they danced round\nto it as he drummed and sang, till their savage instincts seemed to\nrevive. But above all it worked on Yan. As he pranced around in step\nhis whole nature seemed to respond; he felt himself a part of that\ndance. It was in himself; it thrilled him through and through and sent\nhis blood exulting. He would gladly have given up all the White-man’s\n\"glorious gains” to live with the feeling called up by that Indian\ndrum.",
        "The Cat And The Skunk",
        "Sam was away on a “massacree” to get some bread. Guy had been trapped\nby his natural enemy and was serving a term of hard labour in the\ngarden; so Yan was alone in camp. He went around the various mud\nalbums, but discovered nothing new, except the fact that tracks were\ngetting more numerous. There were small Skunk and Mink tracks with the\nlarge ones now. As he came by the brush fence at the end of the blazed\ntrail he saw a dainty little Yellow Warbler feeding a great lubberly\nyoung Cow-bird that, evidently, it had brought up. He had often heard\nthat the Cow-bird habitually “plays Cuckoo” and leaves its egg in the\nnest of another bird, but this was the first time he had actually\nseen anything of it with his own eyes. As he watched the awkward\nmud-coloured Cow-bird flutter its ungrown wings and beg help from the\nbrilliant little Warbler, less than half its size, he wondered whether\nthe fond mother really was fooled into thinking it her own young, or\nwhether she did it simply out of compassion for the foundling. He now\nturned down creek to the lower mud album, and was puzzled by a new\ntrack like this.",
        "[Illustration: Track of small mud turtle]",
        "He sketched it, but before the drawing was done it dawned on him that\nthis must be the track of a young Mud-turtle. He also saw a lot of\nvery familiar tracks, not a few being those of the common Cat, and he\nwondered why they should be about so much and yet so rarely seen. Of\ncourse the animals were chiefly nocturnal, but the boys were partly\nso, and always on the ground now, so that explanation was not\nsatisfactory. He lay down on his breast at the edge of the brook,\nwhich had here cut in a channel with steep clay walls six feet high\nand twenty feet apart. The stream was very small now–a mere thread\nof water zigzagging over the level muddy floor of the “cañon,” as Yan\nloved to call it. A broad, muddy margin at each side of the water made\na fine place of record for the travelling Four-foots, and tracks new\nand old were there in abundance.",
        "The herbage on the bank was very rank and full of noisy Grasshoppers\nand Crickets. Great masses of orange Jewelweed on one side were\nvariegated with some wonderful Cardinal flowers. Yan viewed all this\nwith placid content. He knew their names now, and thus they were\ntransferred from the list of tantalizing mysteries to that of engaging\nand wonderful friends. As he lay there on his breast his thoughts\nwandered back to the days when he did not know the names of any\nflowers or birds–when all was strange and he alone in his hunger to\nknow them, and Bonnerton came back to him with new, strange force of\nreminder. His father and mother, his brother and schoolmates were\nthere. It seemed like a bygone existence, though only two months ago.\nHe had written his mother to tell of his arrival, and once since to\nsay that he was well. He had received a kind letter from his mother,\nwith a scripture text or two, and a postscript from his father with\nsome sound advice and more scripture texts. Since then he had not\nwritten. He could not comprehend how he could so completely drift\naway, and yet clearly it was because he had found here in Sanger the\nwell for which he had thirsted.",
        "As he lay there thinking, a slight movement nearer the creek caught\nhis eye. A large Basswood had been blown down. Like most of its kind,\nit was hollow. Its trunk was buried in the tangle of rank summer\ngrowth, but a branch had been broken off and left a hole in the main\nstem. In the black cavern of the hole there appeared a head with\nshining green eyes, then out there glided onto the log a common gray\nCat. She sat there in the sunshine, licked her paws, dressed her fur\ngenerally, stretched her claws and legs after the manner of her kind,\nwalked to the end of the log, then down the easy slope to the bottom\nof the cañon. Here she took a drink, daintily shook the water from\nher paws, and set the hair just right with a stroke. Then to Yan’s\namusement she examined all the tracks much as he had done, though it\nseemed clear that her nose, not her eyes, was judge. She walked down\nstream, leaving some very fine impressions that Yan mentally resolved\nto have in his note-book, very soon suddenly stopped, looked upward\nand around, a living picture of elegance, sleekness and grace, with\neyes of green fire then deliberately leaped from the creek bed to the\ntangle of the bank and disappeared.",
        "This seemed a very commonplace happening, but the fact of a house Cat\ntaking to the woods lent her unusual interest, and Yan felt much of\nthe thrill that a truly wild animal would have given him, and had gone\nfar enough in art to find exquisite pleasure in the series of pictures\nthe Cat had presented to his eyes.",
        "He lay there for some minutes expecting her to reappear; then far up\nthe creek he heard slight rattling of the gravel. He turned and saw,\nnot the Cat, but a very different and somewhat larger animal. Low,\nthick-set, jet black, with white marks and an immense bushy tail–Yan\nrecognized the Skunk at once, although he had never before met a wild\none in daylight. It came at a deliberate waddle, nosing this way and\nthat. It rounded the bend and was nearly opposite Yan, when three\nlittle Skunks of this year’s brood came toddling after the mother.",
        "The old one examined the tracks much as the Cat had done, and Yan got\na singular sense of brotherhood in seeing the wild things at his own\nstudy.",
        "Then the old Skunk came to the fresh tracks of the Cat and paused so\nlong to smell them that the three young ones came up and joined in.\nOne of the young ones went to the bank where the Cat came down. As it\nblew its little nose over the fresh scent, the old Skunk waddled to\nthe place, became quite interested, then climbed the bank. The little\nones followed in a disjointed procession, varied by one of them\ntumbling backward from the steep trail.",
        "The old Skunk reached the top of the bank, then mounted the log and\nfollowed unerringly the Cat’s back trail to the hole in the trunk.\nDown this she peered a minute, then, sniffing, walked in, till nothing\ncould be seen but her tail. Now Yan heard loud, shrill mewing from the\nlog, ’Mew, mew, m-e-u-w, m-e-e-u-w,” and the old Skunk came\nbacking out, holding a small gray Kitten.",
        "The little thing mewed and spit energetically, holding on to the\ninside of the log. But the old Skunk was too strong–she dragged it\nout. Then holding it down with both paws, she got a good firm grip\nof its neck and turned to carry it down to the bed of the brook.\nThe Kitten struggled vigorously, and at last got its claws into the\nSkunk’s eye and gave such a wrench that the ill-smelling villain\nloosened its hold a little and so gave the Kitten another chance to\nsqueal, which it did with a will, putting all its strength into a\nsuccession of heartrending mee-ow–mee-ows. Yan’s heart\nwas touched. He was about to dash to the rescue when there was a\nscrambling in the far grass, a rush of gray, and the Cat–the old\nmother Cat was on the scene, a picture of demon rage, eyes ablaze, fur\nerect, ears back. With the spring of a Deer and the courage of a Lion\nshe made for the black murderer. Eye could not follow the flashings\nof her paws. The Skunk recoiled and stared stupidly, but not long;\nnothing was “long” about it. Her every superb muscle was tingling with\nforce and mad with hate as the mother Cat closed like a swooping\nFalcon. The Skunk had no time to aim that dreadful gun, and in the\nexcitement fired a volley of the deadly musky spray backward,\ndrenching her own young as they huddled in the trail.",
        "[Illustration: “The Cat and the Skunk\"]",
        "Tooth and claw and deadly grip–the old Cat raged and tore, the black\nfur flew in every direction, and the Skunk for once lost her head and\nfired random shots of choking spray that drenched herself as well as\nthe Cat. The Skunk’s head and neck were terribly torn. The air was\nsuffocating with the poisonous musk. The Skunk was desperately wounded\nand threw herself backward into the water. Blinded and choking, though\nscarcely bleeding, the old Cat would have followed even there, but the\nKitten, wedged under the log, mewed piteously and stayed the mother’s\nfury. She dragged it out unharmed but drenched with musk and carried\nit quickly to the den in the hollow log, then came out again and stood\nerect, blinking her blazing eyes–for they were burning with the\nspray–lashing her tail, the image of a Tigress eager to fight either\npart or all the world for the little ones she nursed. But the old\nSkunk had had more than enough. She scrambled off down the cañon. Her\nthree young ones had tumbled over each other to get out of the way\nwhen they got that first accidental charge of their mother’s battery.\nShe waddled away, leaving a trail of blood and smell, and they waddled\nafter, leaving an odour just as strong.",
        "[Illustration: “The old Cat raged and tore\"]",
        "Yan was thrilled by the desperate fight of the heroic old Cat. Her\nwhole race went up higher in his esteem that day; and the fact that\nthe house Cat really could take to the woods and there maintain\nherself by hunting was all that was needed to give her a place in his\nlist of animal heroes.",
        "Pussy walked uneasily up and down the log, from the hole where the\nKittens were to the end overlooking the cañon. She blinked very hard\nand was evidently suffering severely, but Yan knew quite well that\nthere was no animal on earth big enough or strong enough to frighten\nthat Cat from her post at the door of her home. There is no courage\nmore indomitable than that of a mother Cat who is guarding her young.",
        "At length all danger of attack seemed over, and Pussy, shaking her\npaws and wiping her eyes, glided into her hole. Oh, what a shock it\nmust have been to the poor Kittens, though partly prepared by their\nbrother’s unsavoury coming back. There was the mother, whose return\nhad always been heralded by a delicious odour of fresh Mouse or bird,\ninterwoven with a loving and friendly odour of Cat, that was in itself\na promise of happiness. Scent is the main thing in Cat life, and now\nthe hole was darkened by a creature that was rank with every nasal\nguarantee of deadly enmity. Little wonder that they all fled puffing\nand spitting to the dark corners. It was a hard case; all the little\nstomachs were upset for a long time. They could do nothing but make\nthe best of it and get used to it. The den never smelt any better\nwhile they were there, and even after they grew up and lived elsewhere\nmany storms passed overhead before the last of the Skunk smell left\nthem.",
        "THE ADVENTURES OF A SQUIRREL FAMILY",
        "“I’ll bet I kin make a Woodpecker come out of that hole,” said\nSapwood, one day as the three Red-men proceeded, bow in hand, through\na far corner of Burns’s Bush. He pointed to a hole in the top of a\ntall dead stub, then going near he struck the stub a couple of heavy\nblows with a pole. To the surprise of all there flew out, not a\nWoodpecker, but a Flying Squirrel. It scrambled to the top of the\nstub, looked this way and that, then spread its legs, wings and tail\nand sailed downward, to rise slightly at the end of its flight against\na tree some twenty feet away. Yan bounded to catch it. His fingers\nclutched on its furry back, but he got such a cut from its sharp teeth\nthat he was glad to let it go. It scrambled up the far side of the\ntrunk and soon was lost in the branches.",
        "Guy was quite satisfied that he had carried out his promise of\nbringing a Woodpecker out of the hole, “For ain’t a Flying Squirrel a\nkind of Woodpecker?” he argued. He was, in consequence, very “cocky\"\nthe rest of the day, proposing to produce a Squirrel whenever they\ncame to a stub with a hole in it, and at length, after many failures,\nhad the satisfaction of driving a belated Woodpecker out of its nest.",
        "The plan was evidently a good one for discovering living creatures.\nYan promptly adopted it, and picking up a big stick as they drew near\nanother stub with holes, he gave three or four heavy thumps. A Red\nSquirrel scrambled out of a lower hole and hid in an upper one;\nanother sharp blow made it pop out and jump to the top of the stub,\nbut eventually back into the lower hole.",
        "The boys became much excited. They hammered the stub now without\nmaking the Squirrel reappear.",
        "“Let’s cut it down,” said Little Beaver.",
        "“Show you a better trick than that,” replied the Woodpecker. He looked\nabout and got a pole some twenty feet long. This he placed against a\nrough place high up on the stub and gave it a violent push, watching\ncarefully the head of the stub. Yes! It swayed just a little. Sam\nrepeated the push, careful to keep time with the stub and push always\njust as it began to swing away from him. The other boys took hold of\nthe pole and all pushed together, as Sam called, “Now–now–now–”",
        "A single push of 300 or 400 pounds would scarcely have moved the stub,\nbut these little fifty-pound pushes at just the right time made it\ngive more and more, and after three or four minutes the roots, that\nhad begun to crack, gave way with a craunching sound, and down crashed\nthe great stub. Its hollow top struck across a fallen log and burst\nopen in a shower of dust, splinters and rotten wood. The boys rushed\nto the spot to catch the Squirrel, if possible. It did not scramble\nout as they expected it would, even when they turned over the\nfragments. They found the front of the stub with the old Woodpecker\nhole in it, and under that was a mass of finely shredded cedar bark,\nevidently a nest. Yan eagerly turned it over, and there lay the Red\nSquirrel, quite still and unharmed apparently, but at the end of her\nnose was a single drop of blood. Close beside her were five little\nSquirrels, evidently a very late brood, for they were naked, blind and\nhelpless. One of them had at its nose a drop of blood and it lay as\nstill as the mother. At first the hunters thought the old one was\nplaying ’Possum, but the stiffness of death soon set in.",
        "Now the boys felt very guilty and sorry. By thoughtlessly giving way\nto their hunting instincts they had killed a harmless mother Squirrel\nin the act of protecting her young, and the surviving little ones had\nno prospect but starvation.",
        "Yan had been the most active in the chase, and now was far more\nconscience-stricken than either of the others.",
        "“What are we going to do with them?” asked the Woodpecker. “They are\ntoo young to be raised for pets.”",
        "“Better drown them and be done with them,” suggested Sappy, recalling\nthe last honours of several broods of Kittens at home.",
        "“I wish we could find another Squirrel’s nest to put them into,\"\nsaid Little Beaver remorsefully, and then as he looked at the four\nsquirming, helpless things in his hand the tears of repentance filled\nhis eyes. “We might as well kill them and end their misery. We can’t\nfind another Squirrel’s nest so late as this.” But after a little\nsilence he added, “I know some one who will put them out of pain. She\nmay as well have them. She’d get them anyway, and that’s the old gray\nwild Cat. Let’s put them in her nest when she’s away.”",
        "This seemed a reasonable, simple and merciful way of getting rid of\nthe orphans. So the boys made for the “cañon” part of the brook. At\none time of the afternoon the sun shone so as to show plainly all that\nwas in the hole. The boys went very quietly to Yan’s lookout bank, and\nseeing that only the Kittens were there, Yan crept across and dropped\nthe young Squirrels into the nest, then went back to his friends to\nwatch, like Miriam, the fate of the foundlings.",
        "They had a full hour to wait for the old Cat, and as they were very\nstill all that time they were rewarded with a sight of many pretty\nwild things.",
        "A Humming-bird “boomed” into view and hung in a misty globe of wings\nbefore one Jewel-flower after another.",
        "“Say, Beaver, you said Humming-birds was something or other awful\nbeautiful,” said Woodpecker, pointing to the dull grayish-green bird\nbefore them.",
        "“And I say so yet. Look at that,” as, with a turn in the air, the\nhanging Hummer changed its jet-black throat to flame and scarlet that\nsilenced the critic.",
        "After the Humming-bird went away a Field-mouse was seen for a moment\ndodging about in the grass, and shortly afterward a Shrew-mole, not so\nbig as the Mouse, was seen in hot pursuit on its trail.",
        "Later a short-legged brown animal, as big as a Rabbit, came nosing up\nthe dry but shady bed of the brook, and as it went beneath them Yan\nrecognized by its little Beaver-like head and scaly oar-shaped tail\nthat it was a Muskrat, apparently seeking for water.",
        "There was plenty in the swimming-pond yet, and the boys realized that\nthis had become a gathering place for those wild things that were\n\"drowned out by the drought,” as Sam put it.",
        "The Muskrat had not gone more than twenty minutes before another\ndeep-brown animal appeared. “Another Muskrat; must be a meeting,\"\nwhispered the Woodpecker. But this one, coming close, proved a very\ndifferent creature. As long as a Cat, but lower, with broad, flat head\nand white chin and throat, short legs, in shape a huge Weasel, there\nwas no mistaking it; this was a Mink, the deadly enemy of the Muskrat,\nand now on the track of its prey. It rapidly turned the corner, nosing\nthe trail like a Hound. If it overtook the Muskrat before it got to\nthe pond there would be a tragedy. If the Muskrat reached the deep\nwater it might possibly escape. But just as sure as the pond became a\ngathering place for Muskrats it would also become a gathering place\nfor Mink.",
        "Not five minutes had gone since the Mink went by before a silent gray\nform flashed upon the log opposite. Oh, how sleek and elegant it\nlooked! What perfection of grace she seemed after the waddling, hunchy\nMuskrat and the quick but lumbering Mink. There is nothing more supple\nand elegant than a fine Cat, and men of science the world over have\ntaken the Cat as the standard of perfection in animal make-up. Pussy\nglanced about for danger. She had brought no bird or Mouse, for the\nKittens were yet too young for such training. The boys watched her\nwith intensest interest. She glided along the log to the hole–the\nSkunk-smelling hole–uttered her low ’purrow, purrow,” that\nalways sets the hungry Kittens agog, and was curling in around them,\nwhen she discovered the pink Squirrel-babies among her own. She\nstopped licking the nearest Kitten, stared at a young Squirrel, and\nsmelled it. Yan wondered what help that could be when everything\nsmelled of Skunk. But it did seem to decide her, for she licked it\na moment, then lying down she gathered them all in her four-legged\nembrace, turned her chin up in the air and Sappy announced gleefully\nthat “The little Squirrels were feeding with the little Cats.”",
        "The boys waited a while longer, then having made sure that the little\nSquirrels had been lovingly adopted by their natural enemy, they went\nquietly back to camp. Now they found a daily pleasure in watching the\nmixed family.",
        "And here it may be as well to give the rest of the story. The old gray\nCat faithfully and lovingly nursed those foundlings. They seemed\nto prosper, and Yan, recalling that he had heard of a Cat actually\nraising a brood of Rabbits, looked forward to the day when Kittens\nand Squirrelets should romp together in the sun. After a week Sappy\nmaintained that only one Squirrel appeared at the breakfast table, and\nin ten days none. Yan stole over to the log and learned the truth. All\nfour were dead in the bottom of the nest. There was nothing to tell\nwhy. The old Cat had done her best–had been all love and tenderness,\nbut evidently had not been able to carry out her motherly intentions.",

        "HOW TO SEE THE WOODFOLK",
        "The days went merrily now, beginning each morning with a hunting of\nthe Woodchuck. The boys were on terms of friendship with the woods\nthat contrasted strongly with the feelings of that first night.",
        "This was the thought in Sam’s mind when he one day remarked, “Say,\nYan, do you remember the night I slep’ with the axe an’ you with the\nhatchet?”",
        "The Indians had learned to meet and conquer all the petty annoyances\nof camp life, and so forgot them. Their daily routine was simplified.\nTheir acquaintance with woodfolk and wood-ways had grown so fast\nthat now they were truly at home. The ringing ’Kow–Kow–Kow_\"\nin the tree-tops was no longer a mere wandering voice, but the\nsummer song of the Black-billed Cuckoo. The loud, rattling, birdy\nwhistle in the low trees during dull weather Yan had traced to the\nTree-frog.",
        "The long-drawn ’Pee–re-e-e-e” of hot afternoons was the call\nof the Wood-peewee, and a vast number of mysterious squeaks and\nwarbles had been traced home to the ever-bright and mischievous Blue\nJay.",
        "The nesting season was now over, as well as the song season; the birds,\ntherefore, were less to be seen, but the drying of the streams had\nconcentrated much life in the swimming-pond. The fence had been\narranged so that the cattle could reach one end of it to drink, but\nthe lower parts were safe from their clumsy feet, and wild life of\nmany kinds were there in abundance.",
        "The Muskrats were to be seen every evening in the calm pool, and fish\nin great numbers were in the deeper parts. Though they were small,\nthe boys found them so numerous and so ready to bite that fishing was\ngreat sport, and more than one good meal they had from that pond.\nThere were things of interest discovered daily. In a neighbour’s field\nSam had found another Woodchuck with a “price on his head.” Rabbits\nbegan to come about the camp at night, especially when the moon was\nbright, and frequently of late they had heard a querulous, yelping\nbark that Caleb said was made by a Fox “probably that old rascal that\nlives in Callahan’s woods.”",
        "The gray Cat in the log was always interesting. The boys went very\nregularly to watch from a distance, but for good reasons did not go\nnear. First, they did not wish to scare her; second, they knew that if\nthey went too close she would not hesitate to attack them.",
        "One of the important lessons that Yan learned was this. In the woods\nthe silent watcher sees the most. The great difficulty in\nwatching was how to pass the time, and the solution was to sit and\nsketch. Reading would have done had books been at hand, but\nnot so well as sketching, because then the eyes are fixed on the book\ninstead of the woods, and the turning of the white pages is apt to\nalarm the shy woodfolk.",
        "Thus Yan put in many hours making drawings of things about the edge of\nthe pond.",
        "[Illustration: Kingfisher]",
        "As he sat one day in stillness a Minnow leaped from the water and\ncaught a Fly. Almost immediately a Kingfisher that had been shooting\npast stopped in air, hovered, and darting downward, came up with a\nMinnow in his beak, flew to a branch to swallow its prey, but no\nsooner got there when a Chicken-hawk flashed out of a thick tree,\nstruck the Kingfisher with both feet and bore him downward to the\nbank–in a moment would have killed him, but a long, brown creature\nrushed from a hole in the bank and sprang on the struggling pair, to\nchange the scene in a twinkling. The three stragglers separated, the\nHawk to the left, the Kingfisher to the right, the Minnow flopped back\ninto the pool, and the Mink was left on the shore with a mouthful of\nfeathers and looking very foolish. As it stood shaking the down from\nits nose another animal came gliding down through the shrubbery to the\nshore–the old gray Cat. The Mink wrinkled up his nose, showed two\nrows of sharp teeth and snarled in a furious manner, but backed off\nunder a lot of roots. The Cat laid down her ears; the fur on her back\nand tail stood up; she crouched a little, her eyes blazing and the end\nof her tail twitching, and she answered the snarling of the Mink with\na low growl. The Mink was evidently threatening “sudden death” to the\nCat, and Pussy evidently was not much impressed. The Mink retreated\nfarther under the roots till nothing but the green glowing of his eyes\nwas to be seen, and the Cat, coming forward, walked calmly by his\nhiding-place and went about her business. The snarling under the root\ndied away, and as soon as his enemy was gone the Mink dived into the\nwater and was lost to view.",
        "These two animals had a second meeting, as Yan had the luck to witness\nfrom his watching-place. He had heard the “plop” of a deft plunge, and\nlooked in time only to see the spreading rings near the shore. Then\nthe water was ruffled far up in the pond. A brown spot showed and was\ngone. A second appeared, to vanish as the first had done. Later, a\nMuskrat crawled out on the shore, waddled along for twenty feet, then,\nplunging in, swam below, came up at the other bank, and crawled under\na lot of overhanging roots. A minute later the Mink appeared, his hair\nall plastered close till he looked like a four-legged Snake. He landed\nwhere the Muskrat had come out, followed the trail so that it was\nlost, then galloped up and down the shore, plunged in, swam across,\nand beat about the other shore. At last he struck the trail and\nfollowed. Under the root there were sounds of a struggle, the snarling\nof the mink, and in two or three minutes he appeared dragging out the\nbody of the Muskrat. He sucked its blood and was eating the brains\nwhen again the gray Cat came prowling up the edge of the pond and,\nnot ten feet off, stood face to face with the Mink, as she had done\nbefore.",
        "The Water Weasel saw his enemy but made no attempt to escape from\nher. He stood with forepaws on his victim and snarling a warning and\ndefiance to the Cat. Pussy, after glaring for a few seconds, leaped\nlightly to the high bank, passed above the Mink, then farther on\nleaped down, and resumed her journey up the shore.",
        "Why should the Mink fear the Cat the first time, and the Cat the Mink\nthe second? Yan believed that ordinarily the Cat could “lick,\"\nbut that now the Mink had right on his side; he was defending his\nproperty, and the Cat, knowing that, avoided a quarrel; whereas the\nsame Cat would have faced a thousand Mink in defense of her Kittens.",
        "These two scenes did not happen the same day, but are told together\nbecause Yan always told them together afterward to show that the\nanimals understand something of right and wrong.",
        "But later Yan had another experience with the Muskrats. He and Sam\nwere smoothing out the lower album for the night, when a long stream\nof water came briskly down the middle of the creek bed, which had been\ndry for more than a week.",
        "“Hallo,” said Woodpecker, “where’s that from?”",
        "“A leak in the dam,” said Little Beaver, with fear in his voice.",
        "The boys ran up to the dam and learned that the guess was right.\nThe water had found an escape round the end of the dam, and a close\nexamination showed that it had been made by a burrowing Muskrat.",
        "It was no little job to get it tightly closed up. But the spade was\nhandy, and a close-driven row of stakes with plenty of stiff clay\npacked behind not only stopped the leak but gave a guarantee that in\nfuture that corner at least would be safe.",
        "When Caleb heard of the Muskrat mischief he said:",
        "“Now ye know why the Beavers are always so dead sore on the Muskrats.\nThey know the Rats are liable to spoil their dams any time, so they\nkill them whenever they get the chance.”",
        "Little Beaver rarely watched an hour without seeing something of\ninterest in the swamp. The other warriors had not the patience to wait\nso long and they were not able to make a pastime of sketching.",
        "Yan made several hiding-places where he found that living things were\nmost likely to be seen. Just below the dam was a little pool where\nvarious Crawfish and thread-like Eels abounding proved very attractive\nto Kingfisher and Crow, while little Tip-ups or Teetering Snipe would\nwiggle their latter end on the level dam, or late in the day the\nnever-failing Muskrat would crawl out on a flat stone and sit like\na fur cap. The cañon part of the creek was another successful\nhiding-place, but the very best was at the upper end of the pond, for\nthe simple reason that it gave a view of more different kinds of land.\nFirst the water with Muskrats and occasionally a Mink, next the little\nmarsh, always there, but greatly increased now by the back-up of the\nwater. Here one or two Field-mice and a pair of Sora Rails were at\nhome. Close at hand was the thick woods, where Partridges and Black\nSquirrels were sometimes seen.",
        "Yan was here one day sketching the trunk of a Hemlock to pass the\nwatching time, but also because he had learned to love that old tree.\nHe never sketched because he loved sketching; he did not; the motive\nalways was love of the thing he was drawing.",
        "A Black-and-white Creeper had crawled like a Lizard over all the\ntrunks in sight. A Downy Woodpecker had digged a worm out of a log by\nlabour that most birds would have thought ill-paid by a dozen such\nworms. A Chipmunk had come nearer and nearer till it had actually run\nover his foot and then scurried away chattering in dismay at its\nown rashness; finally, a preposterous little Cock Chickadee sang\n\"_Spring soon–spring soon,” as though any one were interested in\nthe gratuitous and unconvincing fib, when a brown, furry form hopped\nnoiselessly from the green leaves by the pond, skipped over a narrow\nbay without wetting its feet, paused once or twice, then in the middle\nof the open glade it sat up in plain view–a Rabbit. It sat so long\nand so still that Yan first made a sketch that took three of four\nminutes, then got out his watch and timed it for three minutes longer\nbefore it moved in the least. Then it fed for some time, and Yan\ntried to make a list of the things it ate and the things it shunned,\nbut could not do so with certainty.",
        "A noisy Flicker came out and alighted close by on a dried branch. The\nRabbit, or really a Northern Hare, “froze\"–that is, became perfectly\nstill for a moment–but the Flicker marks were easy to read and had\nlong ago been learned as the uniform of a friend, so the Rabbit\nresumed his meal, and when the Flicker flew again he paid no heed.\nA Crow passed over, and yet another. “No; no danger from them.” A\nRed-shouldered Hawk wailed in the woods; the Rabbit heard that and\nevery other sound, but the Red-shoulder is not dangerous, and he knew\nit. A large Hawk with red tail circled silently over the glade,\nand the Rabbit froze on the instant. That same red tail was the mark\nof a dreaded foe. How well Bunny had learned to know them all!",
        "A bunch of clover tempted him to a full repast, after which he hopped\ninto a tussock in the midst of the glade and there turned himself into\na moss-bump, his legs swallowed up in his fur, and his ears laid over\nhis back like a pair of empty gloves or a couple of rounded shingles;\nhis nose-wabblings reduced in number, and he seemed to be sleeping in\nthe last warm rays of the sun. Yan was very anxious to see whether his\neyes were open or not; he had been told that Rabbits sleep with\nopen eyes, but at this distance he could not be sure. He had no\nfield-glass and Guy was not at hand, so the point remained in doubt.",
        "The last sun-blots had gone from the trail and the pond was all\nshadowed by the trees on the western side. A Robin began its evening\nhymn on a tall tree, where it could see the red sun going down, and a\nVeery was trilling his weary, weary, weary in the Elder thicket\nalong the brook, when another, a larger animal, loomed up in the\ndistant trail and glided silently toward Yan. Its head was low and he\ncould not make out what it was. As it stood there for a few seconds\nYan wet his finger in his mouth and held it up. A slight coolness on\nthe side next the coming creature told Yan that the breeze was from it\nto him and would not betray him. It came on, seeming to grow larger,\nturned a little to one side, and then Yan saw plainly by the sharp\nnose and ears and the bushy tail that it was nothing less than a Fox,\nprobably the one that often barked near camp at night.",
        "It was trotting away at an angle, knowing nothing of the watching boy\nnor of the crouching Rabbit, when Yan, merely to get a better look at\nthe cunning one, put the back of his hand to his mouth and by sucking\nmade a slight Mouse-like squeak, sweetest music, potent spellbinder,\nto a hungry Fox, and he turned like a flash. For a moment he stood,\nhead erect, full of poise and force in curb; a second squeak–he came\nslowly back toward the sound and in so doing passed between Yan and\nthe Rabbit. He had crossed its old trail without feeling much\ninterest, but now the breeze brought its body scent. Instantly the\nFox gave up the Mouse hunt–no hunter goes after Mice when big game is\nat hand–and began an elaborate and beautiful stalk of the Rabbit–the\nRabbit that he had not seen. But his nose was his best guide. He\ncautiously zigzagged up the wind, picking his steps with the greatest\ncare, and pointing with his nose like a Pointer Dog. Each step was\nbringing him nearer to Bunny as it slept or seemed asleep in the\ntussock. Yan wondered whether he ought not to shout out and end the\nstalk before the Rabbit was caught, but as a naturalist he was eager\nto see the whole thing out and learn how the Fox would make the\ncapture. The red-furred gentleman was now within fifteen feet of the\ntussock and still the gray one moved not. Now he was within twelve\nfeet–and no move; ten feet–and Bunny seemed in tranquil sleep; eight\nfeet–and now the Fox for the first time seemed to actually see his\nvictim. Yan had hard work to keep from shouting a warning; six\nfeet–and now the Fox was plainly preparing for a final spring.",
        "“Is it right to let him?” and Yan’s heart beat with excitement.",
        "The Fox brought his feet well under him, tried the footing till it\nwas perfect, gathered all his force, then with silent, vicious energy\nsprung straight for the sleeper. Sleeping? Oh, no! Not at all. Bunny\nwas playing his own game. The moment the Fox leaped, he leaped with\nequal vigour the opposite way and out under his enemy, so Reynard\nlanded on the empty bunch of grass. Again he sprang, but the Rabbit\nhad rebounded like a ball in the other direction, and continued this\nbewildering succession of marvellous erratic hops. The Fox in vain\ntried to keep up, for these wonderful side jumps are the Rabbit’s\nstrength and the Fox’s weakness; and Bunny went zigzag–hop–skip–\ninto the thicket and was gone before the Fox could get his heavier\nbody under speed at all.",
        "Had the Rabbit bounded out as soon as he saw the Fox coming he might\nhave betrayed himself unnecessarily; had he gone straight away when\nthe Fox leaped for him he might have been caught in three or four\nleaps, for the enemy was under full speed, but by biding his time he\nhad courted no danger, and when it did come he had played the only\npossible offset, and “lives in the greenwood still.”",
        "The Fox had to seek his supper somewhere else, and Yan went to camp\nhappy in having learned another of the secrets of the woods.",
        "Indian Signs And Getting Lost",
        "“What do you mean when you say Indian signs, Mr. Clark?”",
        "“Pretty near anything that shows there’s Injuns round: a moccasin\ntrack, a smell of smoke, a twig bent, a village, one stone a-top of\nanother or a white settlement scalped and burned–they all are Injun\nsigns. They all mean something, and the Injuns read them an’ make\nthem, too, jest as you would writing.”",
        "“You remember the other day you told us three smokes meant you were\ncoming back with scalps.”",
        "“Well, no; it don’t har’ly mean that. It means ’Good news’–that is,\nwith some tribes. Different tribes uses ’em different.”",
        "“Well, what does one smoke mean?”",
        "“As a rule just simply ’Camp is here_’”",
        "“And two smokes?”",
        "“Two smokes means ’Trouble_’–may mean, ’I am lost.’_”",
        "“I’ll remember that; double for trouble.”",
        "“Three means good news. There’s luck in odd numbers.”",
        "“And what is four?”",
        "“Well, it ain’t har’ly ever used. If I seen four smokes in camp I’d\nknow something big was on–maybe a Grand Council.”",
        "“Well, if you saw five smokes what would you think?”",
        "“I’d think some blame fool was settin’ the hull place a-blaze,” Caleb\nreplied with the sniff end of a laugh.",
        "“Just now you said one stone on another was a sign. What does it\nmean?”",
        "“Course I can’t speak for all Injuns. Some has it for one thing an’\nsome for another, but usually in the West two stones or ’Buffalo\nchips’ settin’ one on the other means ’This is the trail’; and a\nlittle stone at the left of the two would mean ’Here we turned off to\nthe left’; and at the other side, ’Here we turned to the right.’ Three\nstones settin’ one on top of another means, ’This is sure enough the\ntrail,’ ’Special’ or ’Particular’ or ’Look out’; an’ a pile of stones\njust throwed together means ’We camped here ’cause some one was sick.’\nThey’d be the stones used for giving the sick one a steam bath.”",
        "“Well, what would they do if there were no stones?”",
        "“Ye mean in the woods?”",
        "“Yes, or smooth prairie.”",
        "“Well, I pretty near forget, it’s so long ago, but le’s see now,” and\nYan worried Caleb and Caleb threshed his memory till they got out a\ngeneral scheme, or Indian code, though Caleb was careful to say that\n\"some Injuns done it differently.”",
        "[Illustration: INDIAN SIGNS]",
        "Yan must needs set about making a signal fire at once, and was\ndisappointed to find that a hundred yards away the smoke could not be\nseen above the tree-tops, till Caleb showed him the difference between\na clear fire and a smoke or smudge fire.",
        "“Begin with a clear fire to get the heat, then smother it with green\ngrass and rotten wood. There, now you see the difference,” and a great\ncrooked, angling pillar of smoke rolled upward as soon as the grass\nand punk began to sizzle in the glow of embers.",
        "“I bet ye kin see that ten miles away if ye’r on a high place to look\nfor it.”",
        "“I bet I could see it twenty miles,” chirped in Guy.",
        "“Mr. Clark, were you ever lost?” continued the tireless asker.",
        "“Why, course I was, an’ more than once. Every one that goes in the\nwoods is bound to get lost once in awhile.”",
        "“What–do the Indians?”",
        "“Of course! Why not? They’re human, an’ I tell you when you hear a man\nbrag that he never was lost, I know he never was far from his mother’s\napron string. Every one is bound to get lost, but the real woodsman\ngets out all right; that’s the difference.”",
        "“Well, what would you do if you got lost?”",
        "“Depends on where. If it was a country that I didn’t know, and I had\nfriends in camp, after I’d tried my best I’d jest set right down and\nmake two smoke fires. ’Course, if I was alone I’d try to make a bee\nline in the likeliest direction, an’ this is easy to make if ye kin\nsee the sun and stars, but stormy weather ’tain’t possible. No man kin\ndo it, an’ if ye don’t know the country ye have to follow some stream;\nbut I’m sorry for ye if ever ye have to do that, for it’s the worst\nwalking on earth.

        "Tanning Skins and Making Moccasins",
        "Sam had made a find. A Calf had been killed and its skin hung limp on\na beam in the barn. His father allowed him to carry this off, and now\nhe appeared with a “fresh Buffalo hide to make a robe.”",
        "“I don’t know how the Injuns dress their robes,” he explained,\n\"but Caleb does, and he’ll tell you, and, of course, I’ll pay no\nattention.”",
        "The old Trapper had nothing to do, and the only bright spots in his\nlonely life, since his own door was shut in his face, were visits\nto the camp. These had become daily, so it was taken as a matter of\ncourse when, within an hour after Sam’s return, he “happened round.”",
        "“How do the Indians tan furs and robes?” Yan asked at once.",
        "“Wall, different ways–”",
        "But before he could say more Hawkeye reappeared and shouted:",
        "“Say, boys, Paw’s old Horse died!” and he grinned joyfully, merely\nbecause he was the bearer of news.",
        "“Sappy, you grin so much your back teeth is gettin’ sunburned,” and\nthe Head Chief eyed him sadly.",
        "“Well, it’s so, an’ I’m going to skin out his tail for a scalp. I bet\nI’ll be the Injunest one of the crowd.”",
        "“Why don’t you skin the hull thing, an’ I’ll show you how to make lots\nof Injun things of the hide,” Caleb added, as he lighted his pipe.",
        "“Will you help me?",
        "“It’s same as skinnin a Calf. I’ll show you where to get the sewing\nsinew after the hide’s off.”",
        "So the whole camp went to Burns’s field. Guy hung back and hid when he\nsaw his father there drawing the dead Horse away with the plough team.",
        "“Good-day, Jim,” was Caleb’s greeting, for they were good friends.\n\"Struck hard luck with the Horse?”",
        "“No! Not much. Didn’t cost nothing; got him for boot in a swap. Glad\nhe’s dead, for he was foundered.”",
        "“We want his skin, if you don’t.”",
        "“You’re welcome to the hull thing.”",
        "“Well, just draw it over by the line fence we’ll bury what’s left when\nwe’re through.”",
        "“All right. You hain’t seen that durn boy o’ mine, have you?”",
        "“Why, yes; I seen him not long ago,” said Sam. “He was p’inting right\nfor home then.”",
        "“H-m. Maybe I’ll find him at the house.”",
        "“Maybe you will.” Then Sam added under his breath, “I don’t think.”",
        "So Burns left them, and a few minutes later Guy sneaked out of the\nwoods to take a secondary part in the proceedings.",
        "Caleb showed them how to split the skin along the under side of each\nleg and up the belly. It was slow work skinning, but not so unpleasant\nas Yan feared, since the animal was fresh.",
        "Caleb did the most of the work; Sam and Yan helped. Guy assisted with\nreminiscences of his own Calf-skinning and with suggestions drawn from\nhis vast experiences.",
        "When the upper half of the skin was off, Caleb remarked: “Don’t\nbelieve we can turn him over, and when the Injuns didn’t have a Horse\nat hand to turn over the Buffalo they used to cut the skin in two down\nthe line of the back. I guess we better do that. We’ve got all the\nrawhide we need, anyhow.”",
        "So they cut off the half they had skinned, took the tail and the mane\nfor “scalps,” and then Caleb sent Yan for the axe and a pail.",
        "He cut out a lump of liver and the brains of the Horse. “That,” said\nhe, “is for tanning, an’ here is where the Injun woman gits her sewing\nthread.”",
        "He made a deep cut alongside the back bone from the middle of the back\nto the loin, then forcing his fingers under a broad band of whitish\nfibrous tissue, he raised it up, working and cutting till it ran down\nto the hip bone and forward to the ribs. This sewing sinew was about\nfour inches wide, very thin, and could easily be split again and again\ntill it was like fine thread.",
        "“There,” he said, “is a hank o’ thread. Keep that. It’ll dry up, but\ncan be split at any time, and soaking in warm water for twenty minutes\nmakes it soft and ready for use. Usually, when she’s sewing, the squaw\nkeeps a thread soaking in her mouth to be ready. Now we’ve got a Horse\nskin and a Calfskin I guess we better set up a tan-yard.”",
        "“Well, how do you tan furs, Mr. Clark?”",
        "“Good many different ways. Sometimes just scrape and scrape till I get\nall the grease and meat off the inside, then coat it with alum and\nsalt and leave it rolled up for a couple of days till the alum has\nstruck through and made the skin white at the roots of the hair, then\nwhen this is half dry pull and work it till it is all soft.",
        "“But the Injuns don’t have alum and salt, and they make a fine tan out\nof the liver and brains, like I’m going to do with this.”",
        "“Well, I want to do it the Indian way.”",
        "“All right, you take the brains and liver of your Calf.”",
        "“Why not some of the Horse brains and liver?”",
        "“Oh, I dunno. They never do it that way that I’ve seen. Seems like it\nwent best with its own brains.”",
        "“Now,” remarked the philosophical Woodpecker, “I call that a wonderful\nprovision of nature, always to put Calf brains and liver into a\nCalfskin, and just enough to tan it.”",
        "“First thing always is to clean your pelt, and while you do that I’ll\nput the Horsehide in the mud to soak off the hair.” He put it in the\nwarm mud to soak there a couple of days, just as he had done the\nCalfskin for the drum-heads, then came to superintend the dressing of\nthe Buffalo “robe.”",
        "Sam first went home for the Calf brains and liver, then he and Yan\nscraped the skin till they got out a vast quantity of grease, leaving\nthe flesh side bluish-white and clammy, but not greasy to the touch.\nThe liver of the Calf was boiled for an hour and then mashed up with\nthe raw brains into a tanning “dope” or mash and spread on the flesh\nside of the hide, which was doubled, rolled up and put in a cool place\nfor two days. It was then opened out, washed clean in the brook and\nhung till nearly dry. Then Caleb cut a hardwood stake to a sharp edge\nand showed Yan how to pull and work the hide over the edge till it was\nall soft and leathery.",
        "The treatment of the Horsehide was the same, once the hair was\nremoved, but the greater thickness needed a longer soaking in the “tan\ndope.”",
        "After two days the Trapper scraped it clean and worked it on the\nsharp-edged stake. It soon began to look like leather, except in one\nor two spots. On examining these he said:",
        "“H-m, Tanning didn’t strike right through every place. So he buttered\nit again with the mash and gave it a day more; then worked it as\nbefore over the angle of the pole till it was soft and fibrous.",
        "“There,” said he, “that’s Injun tan leather. I have seen it done by\nsoaking the hide for a few days in liquor made by boiling Hemlock or\nBalsam bark in water till it’s like brown ink, but it ain’t any better\nthan that. Now it needs one thing more to keep it from hardening after\nbeing wet. It has to be smoked.”",
        "So he made a smoke fire by smothering a clear fire with rotten wood;\nthen fastening the Horsehide into a cone with a few wooden pins, he\nhung it in the dense smoke for a couple of hours, first one side out,\nthen the other till it was all of a rich smoky-tan colour and had the\nsmell so well known to those who handle Indian leather.",
        "“There it is; that’s Injun tan, an’ I hope you see that elbow grease\nis the main thing in tannin’.”",
        "“Now, will you show us how to make moccasins and war-shirts?” asked\nLittle Beaver, with his usual enthusiasm.",
        "“Well, the moccasins is easy, but I won’t promise about the\nwar-shirts. That’s pretty much a case of following the pattern of your\nown coat, with the front in one piece, but cut down just far enough\nfor your head to go through, instead of all the way, and fixed with\ntie-strings at the throat and fringes at the seams and at the bottom;\nit hain’t easy to do. But any one kin larn to make moccasins. There is\ntwo styles of them–that is, two main styles. Every Tribe has its own\nmake, and an Injun can tell what language another speaks as soon as\nhe sees his footgear. The two best known are the Ojibwa, with soft\nsole–sole and upper all in one, an’ a puckered instep–that’s what\nOjibwa means–’puckered moccasin.’ The other style is the one most\nused in the Plains. You see, they have to wear a hard sole, ’cause the\ncountry is full of cactus and thorns as well as sharp stones.”",
        "“I want the Sioux style. We have copied their teepee and war\nbonnet–and the Sioux are the best Indians, anyway.”",
        "“Or the worst, according to what side you’re on,” was Caleb’s reply.\nBut he went on: “Sioux Injuns are Plains Injuns and wear a hard sole.\nLet’s see, now. I’ll cut you a pair.”",
        "“No, make them for me. It’s my Horse,” said Guy.",
        "“No, you don’t. Your Paw give that to me.” Caleb’s tone said plainly\nthat Guy’s laziness had made a bad impression, so he had to stand\naside while Yan was measured. Caleb had saved a part of the hide\nuntanned though thoroughly cleaned. This was soaked in warm water till\nsoft. Yan’s foot was placed on it and a line drawn around the foot\nfor a guide; this when cut out made the sole of one moccasin (A, cut\nbelow), and by turning it underside up it served as pattern to cut the\nother.",
        "Now Caleb measured the length of the foot and added one inch, and\nthe width across the instep, adding half an inch, and with these as\ngreatest length and breadth cut out a piece of soft leather (B). Then\nin this he made the cut a b on the middle line one way and c\nd on the middle line the other way. A second piece the reverse of\nthis was cut, and next a piece of soft leather for inside tongue (C)\nwas sewn to the large piece (B), so that the edge a b of C was\nfast to a b of B. A second piece was sewn to the other leather\n(B reversed).",
        "“Them’s your vamps for uppers. Now’s the time to bead ’em if you want\nto.”",
        "“Don’t know how.”",
        "“Well, I can’t larn you that; that’s a woman’s work. But I kin show\nyou the pattern of the first pair I ever wore; I ain’t likely to\nforget ’em, for I killed the Buffalo myself and seen the hull making.\"\nHe might have added that he subsequently married the squaw, but he did\nnot.",
        "“There’s about the style” [D]. “Them three-cornered red and white\nthings all round is the hills where the moccasins was to carry me\nsafely; on the heel is a little blue pathway with nothing in it: that\nis behind–it’s past. On the instep is three red, white and blue\npathways where the moccasin was to take me: they’re ahead–in the\nfuture. Each path has lots of things in it, mostly changes and trails,\nan’ all three ends in an Eagle feather–that stands for an honour. Ye\nkin paint them that way after they’re made. Well, now, we’ll sew on\nthe upper with a good thick strand of sinew in the needle–or if you\nhave an awl you kin do without a needle on a pinch–and be sure to\nbring the stitches out the edge of the sole instead of right through,\nthen they don’t wear off. That’s the way.” [E.]",
        "So they worked away, clumsily, while Guy snickered and sizzled, and\nSam suggested that Si Lee would make a better squaw than both of them.",
        "The sole as well as the upper being quite soft allowed them to turn\nthe moccasin inside out as often as they liked–and they did like; it\nseemed necessary to reverse it every few minutes. But at length the\ntwo pieces were fastened together all around, the seam gap at the heel\nwas quickly sewn up, four pairs of lace holes were made (_a, b, c,\nd, in D), and an eighteen-inch strip of soft leather run through\nthem for a lace.",
        "Now Yan painted the uppers with his Indian paints in the pattern that\nCaleb had suggested, and the moccasins were done.",
        "A squaw would have made half a dozen good pairs while Yan and Caleb\nmade the one poor pair, but she would not have felt so happy about it.",
        "Caleb’s Philosophy",
        "The tracks of Mink appeared from time to time on Yan’s creekside mud\nalbums, and at length another of these tireless watchers, placed at\nthe Wakan Rock, reported to him that Mink as well as Skunks came there\nnow for a nightly feast.",
        "The Mink was a large one, judging by the marks, and Caleb was asked to\nhelp in trapping it.",
        "“How do you trap Mink, Mr. Clark?” was the question.",
        "“Don’t trap ’em at all this time o’ year, for they’re no good till\nOctober,” was the answer.",
        "“Well, how do you trap them when they are in season?”",
        "“Oh, different ways.”",
        "It was slow work, but Yan kept on and at length got the old man going.",
        "“Airly days we always used a deadfall for Mink. That’s made like this,\nwith a bird or a Partridge head for bait. That kills him sure, sudden\nand merciful. Then if it’s cold weather he freezes and keeps O.K.\ntill you come around to get him; but in warm weather lots o’ pelts are\nspoiled by being kept too long, so ye have to go round pretty often\nto save all you kill. Then some one brought in them new-fangled steel\ntraps that catches them by the foot and holds them for days and days,\nsome times, till they jest starve to death or chaw their foot off to\nget free. I mind once I ketched a Mink with only two legs left. He had\nbeen in a steel trap twice before and chawed off his leg to get\naway. Them traps save the trapper going round so often, but they’re\nexpensive, and heavy to carry, and you have got to be awful\nhard-hearted before ye kin use ’em. I tell ye, when I thought of all\nthe sufferin’ that Mink went through it settled me for steel traps.\nSince then, says I, if ye must trap, use a deadfall or a ketchalive,\none or other; no manglin’ an’ tormentin’ for days. I tell ye that thar\nnew Otter trap that grabs them in iron claws ought to be forbid by\nlaw; it ain’t human.",
        "“Same way about huntin’. Huntin’s great sport, an’ it can’t be bad,\n’cause I can’t for the life of me see that it makes men bad. ’Pears\nto me men as hunt is humaner than them as is above it; as for the\ncruelty–wall, we know that no wild animal dies easy abed. They all\nget killed soon or late, an’ if it’s any help to man to kill them I\nreckon he has as good a right to do it as Wolves an’ Wildcats. It\ndon’t hurt any more–yes, a blame sight less–to be killed by a rifle\nball than to be chawed by Wolves. The on’y thing I says is don’t do\nit cruel–an’ don’t wipe out the hull bunch. If ye never kill a thing\nthat’s no harm to ye ’live an’ no good to ye dead nor more than the\ncountry kin stand, ’pears to me ye won’t do much harm, an’ ye’ll have\na lot o’ real fun to think about afterward.",
        "“But I mind a feller from Europe, some kind o’ swell, that I was\nguidin’ out West. He had crippled a Deer so it couldn’t get away. Then\nhe sat down to eat lunch right by, and every few moments he’d fire a\nshot into some part or another, experimentin’ an’ aimin’ not to kill\nit for awhile. I heard the shootin’ an’ blattin’, an when I come up I\ntell ye it set my blood a-boilin’. I called him some names men don’t\nlike, an’ put that Deer out o’ pain quick as I could pull trigger.\nThat bu’st up our party–I didn’t want no more o’ him. He come pretty\nnear lyin’ by the Deer that day. It makes me hot yet when I think of\nit.",
        "“If he’d shot that Deer down runnin’ an’ killed it as quick as he\ncould it wouldn’t ’a’ suffered more than if it had been snagged a\nlittle, ’cause bullets of right weight numb when they hit. The Deer\nwouldn’t have suffered more than he naturally would at his finish,\nmaybe less, an’ he’d ’a’ suffered it at a time when he could be some\ngood to them as hunted him. An’ these yer new repeatin’ guns is a\ncurse. A feller knows he has lots of shot and so blazes away into a\nband o’ Deer as long as he can see, an lots gets away crippled, to\nsuffer an’ die; but when a feller has only one shot he’s going to\nplace it mighty keerful. Ef it’s sport ye want, get a single-shot\nrifle, ef it’s destruction, get a Gatling-gun.",
        "“Sport’s good, but I’m agin this yer wholesale killin’ an’ cruelty.\nSteel traps, light-weight bullets an’ repeatin’ guns ain’t human. I\ntell ye it’s them as makes all the sufferin’.”",
        "This was a long speech for Caleb, but it was really less connected\nthan here given. Yan had to keep him going with occasional questions.\nThis he followed up.",
        "“What do you think about bows and arrows, Mr. Clark?”",
        "“I wouldn’t like to use them on big game like Bear and Deer, but I’d\nbe glad if shotguns was done away with and small game could be killed\nonly with arrows. They are either sure death or clear miss. There’s no\ncripples to get away and die. You can’t fire an arrow into a flock of\nbirds and wipe out one hundred, like you can with one of them blame\nscatterguns. It’s them things that is killing off all the small game.\nSome day they’ll invent a scattergun that is a pump repeater like them\nnew rifles, and when every fool has one they’ll wonder where all the\nsmall game has gone to.",
        "“No, sir, I’m agin them. Bows and arrows is less destructful an’ calls\nfor more Woodcraft an’ give more sport–that is, for small game.\nBesides, they don’t make that awful racket, an’ you know who is the\nparty that owns the shot, for every arrow is marked.”",
        "Yan was sorry that Caleb did not indorse the arrow for big game, too.",
        "The Trapper was well started now; he seemed ready enough with\ninformation to-day, and Yan knew enough to “run the rapids on the\nfreshet.”",
        "“How do you make a ketchalive?”",
        "“What for?”",
        "“Oh, Mink.”",
        "“They ain’t fit to catch now, and the young ones need the mothers.”",
        "“I wouldn’t keep it. I only want to make a drawing.”",
        "“Guess that won’t harm it if you don’t keep it too long. Have ye any\nboards? We used to chop the whole thing out of a piece of Balsam wood\nor White Pine, but the more stuff ye find ready-made the easier it is.\nNow I’ll show you how to make a ketchalive if ye’ll promise me never\nto miss a day going to it while it is set.”",
        "The boys did not understand how any one could miss a day in visiting a\nplace of so much interest, and readily promised.",
        "So they made a ketchalive, or box-trap, two feet long, using hay wire\nto make a strong netting at one end.",
        "“Now,” said the trapper, “that will catch Mink, Muskrat, Skunk,\nRabbit–’most anything, ’cording to where you put it and how you bait\nit.”",
        "“Seems to me the Wakan Rock will be a good place to try.”",
        "So the trap was baited with a fish head firmly lashed on the wire\ntrigger.",
        "In the morning, as Yan approached, he saw that it was sprung. A\npeculiar whining and scratching came from it and he shouted in great\nexcitement: “Boys, boys, I’ve got him! I’ve got the Mink!”",
        "They seized the trap and held it cautiously up for the sunlight to\nshine through the bars, and there saw to their disgust that they had\ncaptured only the old gray Cat. As soon as the lid was raised she\nbounded away, spitting and hissing, no doubt to hurry home to tell the\nKittens that it was all right, although she had been away so long.",
        "A Visit from Raften",
        "“Sam, I must have another note-book. It’s no good getting up a new\n’massacree’ of Whites, ’cause there ain’t any note-books there, but\nmaybe your father would get one the next time he drove to Downey’s\nDump. I suppose I’ll have to go on a peace party to ask him.”",
        "Sam made no answer, but looked and listened out toward the trail, then\nsaid: “Talk of the er–Angels, here comes Da.”",
        "When the big man strode up Yan and Guy became very shy and held back.\nSam, in full war-paint, prattled on in his usual style.",
        "“Morning, Da; I’m yer kid. Bet ye’r in trouble an’ want advice or\nsomething.”",
        "Raften rolled up his pendulous lips and displayed his huge front tusks\nin a vast purple-and-yellow grin that set the boys’ hearts at ease.",
        "“Kind o’ thought you’d be sick av it before now.”",
        "“Will you let us stay here till we are?” chimed in Sam, then without\nawaiting the reply that he did not want, “Say, Da, how long is it\nsince there was any Deer around here?”",
        "“Pretty near twenty years, I should say.”",
        "“Well, look at that now,” whispered the Woodpecker.",
        "Raften looked and got quite a thrill for the dummy, half hidden in the\nthicket, looked much like a real deer.",
        "“Don’t you want to try a shot?” ventured Yan.",
        "Raften took the bow and arrow and made such a poor showing that he\nreturned them with the remark. “Sure a gun’s good enough for me,\"\nthen, “Ole Caleb been around since?”",
        "“Old Caleb? I should say so; why, he’s our stiddy company.”",
        "“’Pears fonder o’you than he is of me.”",
        "“Say, Da, tell us about that. How do you know it was Caleb shot at\nyou?”",
        "“Oh, I don’t know it to prove it in a coort o’ law, but we quarr’led\nthat day in town after the Horse trade an’ he swore he’d fix me an’\nleft town. His own stepson, Dick Pogue, stood right by and heard him\nsay it; then at night when I came along the road by the green bush I\nwas fired at, an’ next day we found Caleb’s tobacco pouch and some\nletters not far away. That’s about all I know, an’ all I want to know.\nPogue served him a mean trick about the farm, but that’s none o’ my\nbusiness. I ’spect the old fellow will have to get out an’ scratch for\nhimself pretty soon.”",
        "“He seems kind-hearted,” said Yan.",
        "“Ah, he’s got an awful temper, an’ when he gets drunk he’d do\nanything. Other times he’s all right.”",
        "“Well, how is it about the farm?” Sam asked. “Doesn’t he own it?”",
        "“No, I guess not now. I don’t r’aly know. I only hear them say. Av\ncoorse, Saryann ain’t his own daughter. She’s nowt o’ kin, but he has\nno one else, and Dick was my hired man–a purty slick feller with his\ntongue; he could talk a bird off a bush; but he was a good worker. He\nmarried Sary and persuaded the old man to deed them the place, him to\nlive in comfort with them to the end of his days. But once they got\nthe place, ’twas aisy to see that Dick meant to get rid o’ Caleb, an’\nthe capsheaf was put last year, about his Dog, old Turk. They wouldn’t\nhave him ’round. They said he was scaring the hens and chasing sheep,\nwhich is like enough, for I believe he killed wan ov my lambs, an’ I’d\ngive ten dollars to have him killed–making sure ’twas him, av coorse.\nRather than give up the Dog, Caleb moved out into the shanty on the\ncreek at the other end of the place. Things was better then, for Dick\nand Saryann let up for awhile an’ sent him lots o’ flour an’ stuff,\nbut folks say they’re fixin’ it to put the old man out o’ that and get\nshet of him for good. But I dunno; it’s none o’ my business, though he\ndoes blame me for putting Dick up to it.”",
        "“How’s the note-book?” as Raften’s eye caught sight of the open\nsketch-book still in Yan’s hand.",
        "“Oh, that reminds me,” was the reply. “But what is this?” He showed\nthe hoof-mark be had sketched. Raften examined it curiously.",
        "“H-m, I dunno’; ’pears to me moighty loike a big Buck. But I guess\nnot; there ain’t any left.”",
        "“Say, Da,” Sam persisted, “wouldn’t you be sore if you was an old man\nrobbed and turned out?”",
        "“Av coorse; but I wouldn’t lose in a game of swap-horse, an’ then go\ngunnin’ after the feller. If I had owt agin him I’d go an’ lick him or\nbe licked, an’ take it all good-natured. Now that’s enough. We’ll talk\nabout something else.”",
        "“Will you buy me another note-book next time you go to Downey’s Dump?\nI don’t know how much it will cost or I’d give you the money,” said\nYan, praying mentally that it be not more than the five or ten cents\nwhich was all his capital.",
        "“Shure; I’ll charge it up. But ye needn’t wait till next week.\nThayer’s one back at the White settlement ye can have for nothin’.”",
        "“Say, Mr. Raften,” Guy broke in, “I kin lick them all at\nDeer-hunting.”",
        "Sam looked at Yan and Yan looked at Sam, then glanced at Guy, made\nsome perfectly diabolical signs, seized each a long knife and sprung\ntoward the Third War Chief, but he dodged behind Raften and commenced\nhis usual “Now you let me ’lone–”",
        "Raften’s eye twinkled. “Shure, I thought ye was all wan Tribe an’\npaceable.”",
        "“We’ve got to suppress crime,” retorted his son.",
        "“Make him let me ’lone,” whimpered Sapwood.",
        "“We’ll let ye off this time if ye find that Woodchuck. It’s near two\ndays since we’ve had a skirmish.”",
        "“All right,” and he went. Within five minutes he came running back,\nbeckoning. The boys got their bows and arrows, but fearing a trick\nthey held back. Guy dashed for his own weapons with unmistakable and\nreassuring zest; then all set out for the field. Raften followed,\nafter asking if it would be safe for him to come along.",
        "The grizzly old Woodchuck was there feeding in a bunch of clover. The\nboys sneaked under the fence, crawling through the grass in true Injun\nfashion, till the Woodchuck stood up to look around, then they lay\nstill; when he went down they crawled again, and all got within forty\nyards. Now the old fellow seemed suspicious, so Sam said, “Next time\nhe feeds we all fire together.” As soon, then, as the Woodchuck’s\nbreast was replaced by the gray back, the boys got partly up and\nfired. The arrows whizzed around Old Grizzly, but all missed, and he\nhad scrambled to his hole before they could send a second volley.",
        "“Hallo, why didn’t you hit him, Sappy?”",
        "“I’ll bet I do next time.”",
        "When they returned to Raften he received them with ridicule.",
        "“But ye’r a poor lot o’ hunters. Ye’d all starve if it wasn’t for the\nWhite settlement nearby. Faith, if ye was rale Injun ye’d sit up all\nnight at that hole till he come out in the morning: then ye’d get him;\nan’ when ye get through with that one I’ve got another in the high\npasture ye kin work on.”",
        "So saying, he left them, and Sam called after him:",
        "“Say, Da; where’s that note-book for Yan? He’s the Chief of the\n’coup-tally,’ and I reckon he’ll soon have a job an’ need his book. I\nfeel it in my bones.”",
        "“I’ll lave it on yer bed.” Which he did, and Yan and Sam had the\npleasure of lifting it out of the window with a split stick.",
        "How Yan Knew the Ducks Afar",
        "One day as the great Woodpecker lay on his back in the shade he said\nin a tone of lofty command:",
        "“Little Beaver, I want to be amused. Come hyar. Tell me a story.”",
        "“How would you like a lesson in Tutnee?” was the Second Chief’s\nreply, but he had tried this before, and he found neither Sam nor Guy\ninclined to take any interest in the very dead language.",
        "“Tell me a story, I said,” was the savage answer of the scowling and\nferocious Woodpecker.",
        "“All right,” said Little Beaver. “I’ll tell you a story of such a fine\nboy–oh, he was the noblest little hero that ever wore pantaloons or\ngot spanked in school. Well, this boy went to live in the woods, and\nhe wanted to get acquainted with all the living wild things. He found\nlots of difficulties and no one to help him, but he kept on and\non–oh! he was so noble and brave–and made notes, and when he learned\nanything new he froze on to it like grim death. By and by he got a\nbook that was some help, but not much. It told about some of the birds\nas if you had them in your hand. But this heroic youth only saw\nthem at a distance and he was stuck. One day he saw a wild Duck on a\npond so far away he could only see some spots of colour, but he made\na sketch of it, and later he found out from that rough sketch that it\nwas a Whistler, and then this wonderful boy had an idea. All the\nDucks are different; all have little blots and streaks that are their\nlabels, or like the uniforms of soldiers. ’Now, if I can put their\nuniforms down on paper I’ll know the Ducks as soon as I see them on a\npond a long way off.’ So he set to work and drew what he could\nfind. One of his friends had a stuffed Wood-duck, so the\n’Boy-that-wanted-to-know’ drew that from a long way off. He got\nanother from an engraving and two more from the window of a\ntaxidermist shop. But he knew perfectly well that there are twenty or\nthirty different kinds of Ducks, for he often saw others at a distance\nand made far-sketches, hoping some day he’d find out what they were.\nWell, one day the ’Boy-that-wanted-to-know’ sketched a new Duck on a\npond, and he saw it again and again, but couldn’t find out what it\nwas, and there was his b-e-a-u-t-i-f-u-l sketch, but no one to tell\nhim its name, so when he saw that he just had to go into the teepee\nand steal the First War Chief’s last apple and eat it to hide his\nemotion.”",
        "Here Yan produced an apple and began to eat it with an air of sadness.",
        "Without changing a muscle, the Great Woodpecker continued the tale:",
        "“Then when the First War Chief heard the harrowing tale of a blighted\nlife, he said: ’Shucks, I didn’t want that old apple. It was fished\nout of the swill-barrel anyway, but ’pears to me when a feller sets\nout to do a thing an’ don’t he’s a ’dumb failure,’ which ain’t much\ndifference from a ’durn fool.’",
        "“Now, if this heroic youth had had gumption enough to come out\nflat-footed, an’ instead of stealing rotten apples that the pigs has\nwalked on, had told his trouble to the Great Head War Chief, that\nnative-born noble Red-man would ’a’ said: ’Sonny, quite right. When in\ndoubt come to Grandpa. You want to get sharp on Duck. Ugh! Good’–then\nhe’d ’a’ took that simple youth to Downey’s Hotel at Downey’s Dump an’\nthere showed him every kind o’ Duck that ever was born, an’ all tagged\nan’ labelled. Wah! I have spoken.”",
        "And the Great Woodpecker scowled ferociously at Guy, who was vainly\nsearching his face for a clue, not sure but what this whole thing was\nsome subtle mockery. But Yan had been on the lookout for this. Sam’s\nface throughout had shown nothing but real and growing interest. The\ngood sense of this last suggestion was evident, and the result was an\nexpedition was formed at once for Downey’s Dump, a little town five\nmiles away, where the railroad crossed a long bog on the Skagbog\nRiver. Here Downey, the contractor, had carried the railroad dump\nacross a supposed bottomless morass and by good luck had soon made\na bottom and in consequence a small fortune, with which he built a\nhotel, and was now the great man of the town for which he had done so\nmuch.",
        "“Guess we’ll leave the Third War Chief in charge of camp,” said Sam,\n\"an’ I think we ought to go disguised as Whites.”",
        "“You mean to go back to the Settlement and join the Whites?”",
        "“Yep, an’ take a Horse an’ buggy, too. It’s five miles.”",
        "That was a jarring note. Yan’s imagination had pictured a foot\nexpedition through the woods, but this was more sensible, so he\nyielded.",
        "They went to the house to report and had a loving reception from\nthe mother and little Minnie. The men were away. The boys quickly\nharnessed a Horse and, charged also with some commissions from the\nmother, they drove to Downey’s Dump.",
        "On arriving they went first to the livery-stable to put up the horse,\nthen to the store, where Sam delivered his mother’s orders, and having\nmade sure that Yan had pencil, paper and rubber, they went into\nDowney’s. Yan’s feelings were much like those of a country boy going\nfor the first time to a circus–now he is really to see the things he\nhas dreamed of so long; now all heaven is his.",
        "And, curiously enough, he was not disappointed. Downey was a rough,\nvigorous business man. He took no notice of the boys beyond a brief\n\"Morning, Sam,” till he saw that Yan was making very fair sketches.\nAll the world loves an artist, and now there was danger of too much\nassistance.",
        "The cases could not be opened, but were swung around and shades\nraised to give the best light. Yan went at once to the bird he\nhad “far-sketched” on the pond. To his surprise, it was a female\nWood-duck. He put in the whole afternoon drawing those Ducks, male\nand female, and as Downey had more than fifty specimens Yan felt like\nAladdin in the Fairy Garden–overpowered with abundance of treasure.\nThe birds were fairly well labelled with the popular names, and Yan\nbrought away a lot of sketches, which made him very happy. These he\nafterward carefully finished and put together in a Duck Chart that\nsolved many of his riddles about the Common Duck.",

        "Sam’s Woodcraft Exploit",
        "Sam’s “long suit,” as he put it, was axemanship. He was remarkable\neven in this land of the axe, and, of course, among the “Injuns” he\nwas a marvel. Yan might pound away for half an hour at some block that\nhe was trying to split and make no headway, till Sam would say, “Yan,\nhit it right there,” or perhaps take the axe and do it for him; then\nat one tap the block would fly apart. There was no rule for this happy\nhit. Sometimes it was above the binding knot, sometimes beside it,\nsometimes right in the middle of it, and sometimes in the end of the\nwood away from the binder altogether–often at the unlikeliest places.\nSometimes it was done by a simple stroke, sometimes a glancing stroke,\nsometimes with the grain or again angling, and sometimes a compound of\none or more of each kind of blow; but whatever was the right stroke,\nSam seemed to know it instinctively and applied it to exactly the\nright spot, the only spot where the hard, tough log was open to\nattack, and rarely failed to make it tumble apart as though it were a\ntrick got ready beforehand. He did not brag about it. He simply took\nit for granted that he was the master of the art, and as such the\nothers accepted him.",
        "On one occasion Yan, who began to think he now had some skill, was\nwhacking away at a big, tough stick till he had tried, as he thought,\nevery possible combination and still could make no sign of a crack.\nThen Guy insisted on “showing him how,” without any better result.",
        "“Here, Sam,” cried Yan, “I’ll bet this is a baffler for you.”",
        "Sam turned the stick over, selected a hopeless-looking spot, one as\nyet not touched by the axe, set the stick on end, poured a cup of\nwater on the place, then, when that had soaked in, he struck with all\nhis force a single straight blow at the line where the grain spread to\nembrace the knot. The aim was true to a hair and the block flew open.",
        "“Hooray!” shouted Little Beaver in admiration.",
        "“Pooh!” said Sapwood. “That was just chance. He couldn’t do that\nagain.”",
        "“Not to the same stick!” retorted Yan. He recognized the consummate\nskill and the cleverness of knowing that the cup of water was just\nwhat was needed to rob the wood of its spring and turn the balance.",
        "But Guy continued contemptuously, “I had it started for him.”",
        "“_I think that should count a coup,” said Little Beaver.",
        "“Coup nothin’,” snorted the Third War Chief, in scorn. “I’ll give you\nsomething to do that’ll try if you can chop. Kin you chop a six-inch\ntree down in three minutes an’ throw it up the wind ?”",
        "“What kind o’ tree?” asked the Woodpecker.",
        "“Oh, any kind.”",
        "“I’ll bet you five dollars I kin cut down a six-inch White Pine in two\nminutes an’ throw it any way I want to. You pick out the spot for me\nto lay it. Mark it with a stake an’ I’ll drive the stake.”",
        "“I don’t think any of the Tribe has five dollars to bet. If you can do\nit we’ll give you a grand coup feather,” answered Little Beaver.",
        "“No spring pole,” said Guy, eager to make it impossible.",
        "“All right,” replied the Woodpecker; “I’ll do it without using a\nspring pole.”",
        "So he whetted up his axe, tried the lower margin of the head, found it\nwas a trifle out of the true–that is, its under curve centred, not on\nthe handle one span down, but half an inch out from the handle. A nail\ndriven into the point of the axe-eye corrected this and the chiefs\nwent forth to select a tree. A White Pine that measured roughly six\ninches through was soon found, and Sam was allowed to clear away the\nbrush around it. Yan and Guy now took a stout stake and, standing\nclose to the tree, looked up the trunk. Of course, every tree in the\nwoods leans one way or another, and it was easy to see that this\nleaned slightly southward. What wind there was came from the north, so\nYan decided to set the stake due north.",
        "Sam’s little Japanese eyes twinkled. But Guy who, of course, knew\nsomething of chopping, fairly exploded with scorn. “Pooh! What do you\nknow? That’s easy; any one can throw it straight up the wind. Give him\na cornering shot and let him try. There, now,” and Guy set the stake\noff to the north-west. “Now, smarty. Let’s see you do that.”",
        "“All right. You’ll see me. Just let me look at it a minute.”",
        "Sam walked round the tree, studied its lean and the force of the wind\non its top, rolled up his sleeves, slipped his suspenders, spat on his\npalms, and, standing to west of the tree, said “Ready.”",
        "Yan had his watch out and shouted ’Go.”",
        "Two firm, unhasty strokes up on the south side of the tree left a\nclean nick across and two inches deep in the middle. The chopper then\nstepped forward one pace and on the north-northwesterly side, eighteen\ninches lower down than the first cut, after reversing his hands–which\nis what few can do–he rapidly chopped a butt-kerf. Not a stroke\nwas hasty; not a blow went wrong. The first chips that flew were\nten inches long, but they quickly dwindled as the kerf sank in. The\nbutt-kerf was two-thirds through the tree when Yan called “One minute\nup.” Sam stopped work, apparently without cause, leaned one hand\nagainst the south side of the tree and gazed unconcernedly up at its\ntop.",
        "“Hurry up, Sam. You’re losing time!” called his friend. Sam made no\nreply. He was watching the wind pushes and waiting for a strong one.\nIt came–it struck the tree-top. There was an ominous crack, but Sam\nhad left enough and pushed hard to make sure; as soon as the recoil\nbegan he struck in very rapid succession three heavy strokes, cutting\naway all the remaining wood on the west side and leaving only a\nthree-inch triangle of uncut fibre. All the weight was now northwest\nof this. The tree toppled that way, but swung around on the uncut\npart; another puff of wind gave help, the swing was lost, the tree\ncrashed down to the northwest and drove the stake right out of sight\nin the ground.",
        "“Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! One minute and forty-five seconds!” How Yan\ndid cheer. Sam was silent, but his eyes looked a little less dull and\nstupid than usual, and Guy said “Pooh? That’s nothin’.”",
        "Yan took out his pocket rule and went to the stump. As soon as he laid\nit on, he exclaimed “Seven and one-half inches through where you cut,\"\nand again he had to swing his hat and cheer.",
        "“Well, old man, you surely did it that time. That’s a grand coup if\never I saw one,” and so, notwithstanding Guy’s proposal to “leave it\nto Caleb,” Sam got his grand Eagle feather as Axeman A1 of the Sanger\nIndians.",
        "The Owls and The Night School",
        "One night Sam was taking a last look at the stars before turning in. A\nHorned Owl had been hooting not far away.",
        "“_Hoo–hohoo-hoho–hoooooo.”",
        "And as he looked, what should silently sail to the top of the medicine\npole stuck in the ground twenty yards away but the Owl.",
        "“Yan! Yan! Give me my bow and arrow, quick. Here’s a Cat-Owl–a\nchicken stealer, he’s fair game.”",
        "“He’s only codding you, Yan,” said Guy sleepily from his blanket. “I\nwouldn’t go.”",
        "But Yan rushed out with his own and Sam’s weapons.",
        "Sam fired at the great feathery creature, but evidently missed, for\nthe Owl spread its wings and sailed away.",
        "“There goes my best arrow. That was my ’Sure-death.’”",
        "“Pshaw!” growled Yan, as he noted the miss. “You can’t shoot a little\nbit.”",
        "But as they stood, there was a fluttering of broad wings, and there,\nalighting as before on the medicine pole, was the Owl again.",
        "“My turn now!” exclaimed Yan in a gaspy whisper.",
        "He drew his bow, the arrow flew, and the Owl slipped off unharmed as\nit had the first time.",
        "“Yan, you’re no good. An easy shot like that. Why, any idiot could hit\nthat. Why didn’t you fetch her?”",
        "“’Cause I’m not an idiot, I suppose. I hit the same place as you did,\nanyway, and drew just as much blood.”",
        "“Ef he comes back again you call me,” piped Guy in his shrill voice.\n\"I’ll show you fellers how to shoot. You’re no good at all ’thout me.\nWhy, I mind the time I was Deer-shooting––” but a fierce dash of the\nwhole Tribe for Sappy’s bed put a stop to the reminiscent flow and\nreplaced it with whines of “Now you let me alone. I ain’t doin’\nnothin’ to you.”",
        "During the night they were again awakened by the screech in the\ntree-tops, and Yan, sitting up, said, “Say, boys, that’s nothing but\nthat big Cat Owl.”",
        "“So it is,” was Sam’s answer; “wonder I didn’t think of that before.”",
        "“I did,” said Guy; “I knew it all the time.”",
        "In the morning they went out to find their arrows. The medicine pole\nwas a tall pole bearing a feathered shield, with the tribal totem, a\nwhite Buffalo, which Yan had set up to be in Indian fashion. Sighting\nin line from the teepee over this, they walked on, looking far beyond,\nfor they had learned always to draw the arrow to the head. They\nhad not gone twenty-five feet before Yan burst out in unutterable\nastonishment: “Look! Look at that–and that–––”",
        "There on the ground not ten feet apart were two enormous Horned Owls,\nboth shot fairly through the heart, one with Sam’s “Sure-death” arrow,\nthe other with Yan’s “Whistler\"; both shots had been true, and the\nboys could only say, “Well, if you saw that in print you would say it\nwas a big lie!” It was indeed one of those amazing things which happen\nonly in real life, and the whole of the Tribe with one exception voted\na grand coup to each of the hunters.",
        "Guy was utterly contemptuous. “They got so close they hit by chance\nan’ didn’t know they done it. If he had been shooting,” etc., etc.,\netc.",
        "“How about that screech in the tree-tops, Guy?”",
        "“Errrrh.”",
        "What a fascination the naturalist always finds in a fine Bird. Yan\nrevelled in these two. He measured their extent of wing and the length\nfrom beak to tail of each. He studied the pattern on their quills;\nhe was thrilled by their great yellow eyes and their long, powerful\nclaws, and he loved their every part. He hated to think that in a few\ndays these wonderful things would be disgusting and fit only to be\nburied.",
        "“I wish I knew hew to stuff them,” he said.",
        "“Why don’t you get Si Lee to show you,” was Sam’s suggestion. “Seems\nto me I often seen pictures of Injun medicine men with stuffed birds,\"\nhe added shrewdly and happily.",
        "“Well, that’s just what I will do.”",
        "Then arose a knotty question. Should he go to Si Lee and thereby turn\n\"White” and break the charm of the Indian life, or should he attempt\nthe task of persuading Si to come down there to work without proper\nconveniences. They voted to bring Si to camp. “Da might think we was\nbacking out.” After all, the things needed were easily carried, and\nSi, having been ambushed by a scout, consented to come and open a\nnight-school in taxidermy.",
        "The tools and things that he brought were a bundle of tow made by\nunravelling a piece of rope, some cotton wool, strong linen thread,\ntwo long darning needles, arsenical soap worked up like cream,\ncorn-meal, some soft iron wire about size sixteen and some of\nstovepipe size, a file, a pair of pliers, wire cutters, a sharp knife,\na pair of stout scissors, a gimlet, two ready-made wooden stands, and\nlast of all a good lamp. The boys hitherto had been content with the\nfirelight.",
        "Thus in the forest teepee Yan had his first lesson in the art that was\nto give him so much joy and some sorrow in the future.",
        "Guy was interested, though scornful; Sam was much interested; Yan was\nsimply rapt, and Si Lee was in his glory. His rosy red cheeks and his\nround figure swelled with pride; even his semi-nude head and fat,\nfumbling fingers seemed to partake of his general elation and\nimportance.",
        "First he stuffed the Owls’ throats and wounds with cotton wool.",
        "Then he took one, cut a slit from the back of the breast-bone nearly\nto the tail (_A to B, Fig. 1), while Yan took the other and tried\nfaithfully to follow his example.",
        "He worked the skin from the body chiefly by the use of his finger\nnails, till he could reach the knee of each leg and cut this through\nat the joint with the knife (_Kn, Fig. 1). The flesh was removed from\neach leg-bone down to the heel-joint (_Hl, Hl, Fig. 1), leaving the\nleg and skin as in Lg, Figure 2. Then working back on each side of\nthe tail, he cut the “pope’s nose” from the body and left it as part\nof the skin, with the tail feathers in it, and this, Si explained, was\na hard place to get around. Sam called it “rounding Cape Horn.” As the\nflesh was exposed Si kept it powdered thickly with corn-meal, and this\nsaved the feathers from soiling.",
        "Once around Cape Horn it was easy sailing. The skin was rapidly pushed\noff till the wings were reached. These were cut off at the joint deep\nin the breast (under J J, Fig. 1, or seen on the back, W J, Fig. 2),\nthe first bone of each wing was cleared of meat, and the skin, now\ninside out and well mealed, was pushed off the neck up to the head.",
        "Here Si explained that in most birds it would slip easily over the head,\nbut in Owls, Woodpeckers, Ducks and some others one had sometimes to\nhelp it by a lengthwise slit on the nape (_Sn, Fig. 2). “Owls is hard,\nanyway,” he went on, “though not so bad as Water-fowl. If ye want a real\neasy bird for a starter, take a Robin or a Blackbird, or any land Bird\nabout that size except Woodpeckers.”",
        "When the ears were reached they were skinned and pulled out of the skull\nwithout cutting, then, after the eyes were passed, the skin and body\nlooked as in Figure 2. Now the back of the head with the neck and body\nwas cut off (_Ct, Fig. 2), and the first operation of the skinning was\ndone.",
        "Yan got along fairly well, tearing and cutting the skin once or twice,\nbut learning very quickly to manage it.",
        "Now began the cleaning of the skin.",
        "The eyes were cut clean out and the brains and flesh carefully scraped\naway from the skull.",
        "The wing bones were already cleaned of meat down to the elbow joint,\nwhere the big quill feathers began, and the rest of the wing had to\nbe cleared of flesh by cutting open the under side of the next joint\n(_H to El, Fig. 1). The “pope’s nose” and the skin generally was\nfreed from meat and grease by scraping with a knife and rubbing with\nthe meal.",
        "Then came the poisoning. Every part of the bones and flesh had to be\npainted with the creamy arsenical soap, then the head was worked back\ninto its place and the skin turned right side out.",
        "When this was done it was quite late. Guy was asleep, Sam was nearly\nso, and Yan was thoroughly tired out.",
        "“Guess I’ll go now,” said Si. “Them skins is in good shape to keep,\nonly don’t let them dry,” so they were wrapped up in a damp sack and\nput away in a tin till next night, when Si promised to return and\nfinish the course in one more lesson.",

The last operation is to remove the threads\n    and cut all the wires off close so that the feathers hide what\n    remains.",
        "While they were so working Sam had busied himself opening the Owls’\nstomachs–\"looking up their records,” as he called it. He now reported\nthat one had lynched a young Partridge and the other had killed a\nRabbit for its latest meal.",
        "Next night Si Lee came as promised, but brought bad news. He had\nfailed to find the glass Owl eyes he had hoped were in his trunk. His\ningenuity, however, was of the kind that is never balked in a small\nmatter. He produced some black and yellow oil paints, explaining,\n\"Guess we’ll make wooden eyes do for the present, an’ when you get to\ntown you can put glass ones in their place.” So Sam was set to work\nwhittling four wooden eyes the shape of well-raised buns and about\nthree-quarters of an inch across. When whittled, scraped and smooth,\nSi painted them brilliant yellow with a central black spot and put\nthem away to dry (shown on a large scale on Owl Stuffing Plate, Fig. 9,\na and b_).",
        "Meanwhile, he and Yan got out the two skins. The bloody feathers on\nthe breasts were washed clean in a cup of warm water, then dried with\ncotton and dusted all over with meal to soak up any moisture left. The\nleg and wing bones were now wrapped with as much tow as would take the\nplace of the removed meat. The eye sockets were partly filled with\ncotton, then a long soft roll of tow about the length and thickness of\nthe original neck was worked up into the neck skin and into the skull\nand left hanging. The ends of the two wing bones were fastened two\ninches apart with a shackle of strong string (_X, Fig. 2 and\nFig. 7). Now the body was needed.",
        "For this Si rolled and lashed a wad of tow with strong thread until\nhe made a dummy of the same size and shape as the body taken out,\nsqueezing and sewing it into a hard solid mass. Next he cut about two\nand a half feet of the large wire, filed both ends sharp, doubled\nabout four inches of one end back in a hook (Fig. 5), then drove the\nlong end through the tow body from the tail end out where the neck\nshould join on (Figs. 3 and 4). This was driven well in so that the\nshort end of the hook was buried out of sight. Now Si passed the\nprojecting ends of the long wire up the neck in the middle of the tow\nroll or neck already there, worked it through the skull and out at the\ntop of the Owl’s head, and got the tow body properly placed in the\nskin with the string that bound the wing bones across the back\n(_X, Fig. 7).",
        "Two heavy wires each eighteen inches long and sharp at one end were\nneeded for the legs. These were worked up one through the sole of\neach foot under the skin of the leg behind (_Lw, Fig. 6), then\nthrough the tow body at the middle of the side (_W, Fig. 7),\nafter which the sharp end was bent with pliers into a hook and driven\nback into the hard body (after the manner of the neck wire, Fig. 4).",
        "Another wire was sharpened and driven through the bones of the tail,\nfastening that also to the tow body (_Tw, Fig. 7).",
        "Now a little soft tow was packed into places where it seemed needed\nto fit the skin on, and it remained to sew up the opening below\n(_Bc in Fig. 6), the wing slits (_El, H, Fig. 6 and Fig.\n1), and the slit in the nape (_Sn Sn, Fig. 2) with half a dozen\nstitches, always putting the needle into the skin from the flesh side.",
        "The projecting wires of the feet were put through gimlet holes in the\nperch and made firm, and Si’s Owls were ready for their positions.\nThey were now the most ridiculous looking things imaginable, wings\nfloppy, heads hanging.",
        "“Here is where the artist comes in,” said Si proudly, conscious that\nthis was himself. He straightened up the main line of the body by\nbending the leg wires and set the head right by hunching the neck into\nthe shoulders. “An Owl always looks over its shoulder,” he explained,\nbut took no notice of Sam’s query as to “whose shoulder he expected it\nto look over.” He set two toes of each foot forward on the perch and\ntwo back to please Yan, who insisted that that was Owly, though Si\nhad his doubts. He spread the tail a little by pinning it between two\npieces of card (_Tl, Fig. 10), gave it the proper slant, and now\nhad the wings to arrange.",
        "They were drooping like those of a clucking hen. A sharp wire of the\nsmall size was driven into the bend of each wing (_0, Fig. 7),\nnailing it in effect to the body (_Ww and Ww, Fig. 10). A long pin\nwas set in the middle of the back (_Bp, Fig. 10), then using these\nwith the wing wires and head wire as lashing points, Si wrapped the\nwhole bird with the thread (Fig. 10), putting a wad of cotton here or\na bit of stick there under the wrapping till he had the position and\n\"feathering” perfect, as he put it.",
        "“We can put in the eyes now,” said he, “or later, if we soften\nthe skin around the eye-sockets by putting wet cotton in them for\ntwenty-four hours.”",
        "Yan had carefully copied Si’s method with the second Owl, and\ndeveloped unusual quickness at it.",
        "His teacher remarked, “Wall, I larned lots o’ fellows to stuff birds,\nbut you ketch on the quickest I ever seen.”",
        "Si’s ideas of perfection might differ from those of a trained\ntaxidermist; indeed, these same Owls afforded Yan no little amusement\nin later years, but for the present they were an unmitigated joy.",
        "They were just the same in position. Si knew only one; all his birds\nhad that. But when they had dried fully, had their wrappings removed,\nthe wires cut off flush and received the finishing glory of their\nwooden eyes, they were a source of joy and wonder to the whole Tribe\nof Indians.",
        "The Trial of Grit",
        "The boys had made war bonnets after the “really truly” Indian style\nlearned from Caleb. White Turkey tail-feathers and white Goose\nwing-feathers dyed black at the tips made good Eagle feathers. Some\nwisps of red-dyed horsehair from an old harness tassel; strips of red\nflannel from an old shirt, and some scraps of sheepskin supplied the\nremaining raw material. Caleb took an increasing interest, and helped\nthem not only to make the bonnet, but also to decide on what things\nshould count coup and what grand coup. Sam had a number\nof feathers for shooting, diving, “massacreeing the Whites,” and his\ngrand tufted feathers for felling the pine and shooting the Cat-Owl.",
        "Among other things, Yan had counted coup for trailing. The Deer hunt\nhad been made still more real by having the “Deer-boy” wear a pair of\nsandals made from old boots; on the sole of each they put two lines\nof hobnails in V shape, pointing forward. These made hooflike marks\nwherever the Deer went. One of the difficulties with the corn was that\nit gave no clue to the direction or doubling of the trail, but the\nsandals met the trouble, and with a very little corn to help they had\nan ideal trail. All became very expert, and could follow fast a very\nslight track, but Yan continued the best, for what he lacked in\neyesight he more than made up in patience and observation. He already\nhad a grand coup for finding and shooting the Deer in the heart,\nthat time, at first shot before the others came up even, and had won\nsix other grand coups–one for swimming 200 yards in five minutes,\none for walking four measured miles in one hour, one for running 100\nyards in twelve seconds, one for knowing 100 wild plants, one for\nknowing 100 birds, and the one for shooting the Horned Owl.",
        "Guy had several good coups, chiefly for eyesight. He could see\n\"the papoose on the squaws back,” and in the Deer hunt he had several\ntimes won coups that came near being called grand coup,\nbut so far fate was against him, and even old Caleb, who was partial\nto him, could not fairly vote him a grand coup.",
        "“What is it that the Injuns most likes in a man: I mean, what would\nthey druther have, Caleb?” asked Sappy one day, confidently expecting\nto have his keen eyesight praised.",
        "“Bravery,” was the reply. “They don’t care what a man is if he’s\nbrave. That’s their greatest thing–that is, if the feller has the\nstuff to back it up. An’ it ain’t confined to Injuns; I tell you there\nain’t anything that anybody goes on so much. Some men pretends to\nthink one thing the best of all, an’ some another, but come right down\nto it, what every man, woman an’ child in the country loves an’\nworships is pluck, clear grit, well backed up.”",
        "“_Well, I tell you,” said Guy, boiling up with enthusiasm at\nthis glorification of grit, ’I ain’t scared o’ nothin’.”",
        "“Wall, how’d you like to fight Yan there?”",
        "“Oh, that ain’t fair. He’s older an’ bigger’n I am.”",
        "“Say, Sappy, I’ll give you one. Suppose you go to the orchard alone\nan’ get a pail of cherries. All the men’ll be away at nine o’clock.”",
        "“Yes, and have old Cap chaw me up.”",
        "“Thought you weren’t scared of anything, an’ a poor little Dog smaller\nthan a yearling Heifer scares you.”",
        "“Well, I don’t like cherries, anyhow.”",
        "“Here, now, Guy, I’ll give you a real test. You see that stone?” and\nCaleb held up a small round stone with a hole in it. “Now, you know\nwhere old Garney is buried?”",
        "Garney was a dissolute soldier who blew his head off, accidentally,\nhis friends claimed, and he was buried on what was supposed to be his\nown land just north of Raften’s, but it afterward proved to be part of\nthe highway where a sidepath joined in, and in spite of its diggers\nthe grave was at the crossing of two roads. Thus by the hand of\nfate Bill Garney was stamped as a suicide.",
        "The legend was that every time a wagon went over his head he must\ngroan, but unwilling to waste those outcries during the rumbling of\nthe wheels, he waited till midnight and rolled them out all together.\nAnyone hearing should make a sympathetic reply or they would surely\nsuffer some dreadful fate. This was the legend that Caleb called up\nto memory and made very impressive by being properly impressed\nhimself.",
        "“Now,” said he, “I am going to hide this stone just behind the rock\nthat marks the head of Garney’s grave, an’ I’ll send you to git it\nsome night. Air ye game?”",
        "“Y-e-s, I’ll go,” said the Third War Chief without visible enthusiasm.",
        "“If he’s so keen for it now, there’ll be no holding him back when\nnight comes,” remarked the Woodpecker.",
        "“Remember, now,” said Caleb, as he left them to return to his own\nmiserable shanty, “this is the chance to show what you’re made of.\nI’ll tie a cord to the stone to make sure that you get it.”",
        "“We’re just going to eat. Won’t you stay and jine with us,” called\nSam, but Caleb strode off without taking notice of the invitation.",
        "In the middle of the night the boys were aroused by a man’s voice\noutside and the scratching of a stick on the canvas.",
        "“Boys! Guy–Yan! Oh, Guy!”",
        "“Hello! Who is it?”",
        "“Caleb Clark! Say, Guy, it’s about half-past eleven now. You have just\nabout time to go to Garney’s grave by midnight an’ get that stone,\nand if you can’t find the exact spot you listen for the groaning\n–that’ll guide you.”",
        "This cheerful information was given in a hoarse whisper that somehow\nconveyed the idea that the old man was as scared as he could be.",
        "“I–I–I–” stammered Guy, “I can’t see the way.”",
        "“This is the chance of your life, boy. You get that stone and you’ll\nget a grand coup feather, top honours fur grit. I’ll wait here\ntill you come back.”",
        "“I–I–can’t find the blamed old thing on such a dark night.\nI–I–ain’t goin’.”",
        "“Errr–you’re scared,” whispered Caleb.",
        "“I ain’t scared, on’y what’s the use of goin’ when I couldn’t find the\nplace? I’ll go when it’s moonlight.”",
        "“Err–anybody here brave enough to go after that stone?”",
        "“I’ll go,” said the other two at the same time, though with a certain\nair of “But I hope I don’t have to, all the same.”",
        "“You kin have the honour, Yan,” said the Woodpecker, with evident\nrelief.",
        "“Of course, I’d like the chance–but–but–I don’t want to push ahead\nof you–you’re the oldest; that wouldn’t be square,” was the reply.",
        "“Guess we’d better draw straws for it.”",
        "So Sam sought a long straw while Yan stirred up the coals to a blaze.\nThe long straw was broken in two unequal pieces and hidden in Sam’s\nhand. Then after shuffling he held it toward Yan, showing only the\ntwo tips, and said, “Longest straw takes the job.” Yan knew from old\nexperience that a common trick was to let the shortest straw stick out\nfarthest, so he took the other, drew it slowly out and out–it seemed\nendless. Sam opened his hand and showed that the short straw remained,\nthen added with evident relief: “You got it. You are the luckiest\nfeller I ever did see. Everything comes your way.”",
        "If there had been any loophole Yan would have taken it, but it was\nnow clearly his duty to go for that stone. It was pride rather than\ncourage that carried him through. He dressed quietly and nervously;\nhis hands trembled a little as he laced his shoes. Caleb waited\noutside when he heard that it was Yan who was going. He braced him up\nby telling him: “You’re the stuff. I jest love to see grit. I’ll\ngo with you to the edge of the woods–’twouldn’t be fair to go\nfarther–and wait there till you come back. It’s easy to find. Go four\npanels of fence past the little Elm, then right across on the other\nside of the road is the big stone. Well, on the side next the north\nfence you’ll find the ring pebble. The coord is lying kind o’ cross\nthe big white stone, so you’ll find it easy; and here, take this\nchalk; if your grit gives out, you mark on the fence how far you did\nget, but don’t you worry about that groaning–it’s nothing but a\nyarn–don’t be scairt.”",
        "“I am afraid I am scared, but still I’ll go.”",
        "“That’s right,” said the Trapper with emphasis. “Bravery ain’t so much\nnot being scairt as going ahead when you are scairt, showing that you\nkin boss your fears.”",
        "So they talked till they struck out of the gloom of the trees to the\ncomparative light of the open field.",
        "“It’s just fifteen minutes to midnight,” said Caleb, looking at his\nwatch with the light of a match, “You’ll make it easy. I’ll wait\nhere.”",
        "Then Yan went on alone.",
        "It was a somber night, but he felt his way along the field fence to\nthe line fence and climbed that into the road that was visible as a\nless intense darkness on the black darkness of the grass. Yan walked\non up the middle cautiously. His heart beat violently and his hands\nwere cold. It was a still night, and once or twice little mousey\nsounds in the fence corner made him start, but he pushed on. Suddenly\nin the blackness to the right of the road he heard a loud “whisk,\"\nthen he caught sight of a white thing that chilled his blood. It was\nthe shape of a man wrapped in white, but lacked a head, just as the\nstory had it. Yan stood frozen to the ground. Then his intellect came\nto the rescue of his trembling body. “What nonsense! It must be a\nwhite stone.” But no, it moved. Yan had a big stick in his hand. He\nshouted: “Sh, sh, sh!” Again the “corpse” moved. Yan groped on the\nroad for some stones and sent one straight at the “white thing.” He\nheard a “whooff” and a rush. The “white thing” sprang up and ran past\nhim with a clatter that told him he had been scared by Granny de\nNeuville’s white-faced cow. At first the reaction made him weak at the\nknees, but that gave way to a better feeling. If a harmless old Cow\ncould lie out there all night, why should he fear? He went on more\nquietly till he neared the rise in the road. He should soon see the\nlittle Elm. He kept to the left of the highway and peered into the\ngloom, going more slowly. He was not so near as he had supposed, and\nthe tension of the early part of the expedition was coming back more\nthan ever. He wondered if he had not passed the Elm–should he go\nback? But no, he could not bear the idea; that would mean retreat.\nAnyhow, he would put his chalk mark here to show how far he did get.\nHe sneaked cautiously toward the fence to make it, then to his relief\nmade out the Elm not twenty-five feet away. Once at the tree, he\ncounted off the four panels westward and knew that he was opposite the\ngrave of the suicide. It must now be nearly midnight. He thought he\nheard sounds not far away, and there across the road he saw a whitish\nthing–the headstone. He was greatly agitated as he crawled quietly as\npossible toward it. Why quietly he did not know. He stumbled through\nthe mud of the shallow ditch at each side, reached the white stone,\nand groped with clammy, cold hands over the surface for the string. If\nCaleb had put it there it was gone now. So he took his chalk and wrote\non the stone “Yan.”",
        "Oh, what a scraping that chalk made! He searched about with his\nfingers around the big boulder. Yes, there it was; the wind, no doubt,\nhad blown it off. He pulled it toward him. The pebble was drawn across\nthe boulder with another and louder rasping that sounded fearfully\nin the night. Then at once a gasp, a scuffle, a rush, a splash of\nsomething in mud, or water–horrible sounds of a being choking,\nstrangling or trying to speak. For a moment Yan sank down in terror.\nHis lips refused to move. But the remembrance of the cow came to help\nhim. He got up and ran down the road as fast as he could go, a cold\nsweat on him. He ran so blindly he almost ran into a man who shouted\n\"Ho, Yan; is that you?” It was Caleb coming to meet him. Yan could\nnot speak. He was trembling so violently that he had to cling to the\nTrapper’s arm.",
        "“What was it, boy? I heard it, but what was it?”",
        "“I–I–don’t know,” he gasped; “only it was at the g-g-grave.”",
        "“Gosh! I heard it, all right,” and Caleb showed no little uneasiness,\nbut added, “We’ll be back in camp in ten minutes.”",
        "He took Yan’s trembling hand and led him for a little while, but he\nwas all right when he came to the blazed trail. Caleb stepped ahead,\ngroping in the darkness.",
        "Yan now found voice to say, “I got the stone all right, and I wrote my\nname on the grave, too.”",
        "“Good boy! You’re the stuff!” was the admiring response.",
        "They were very glad to see that there was a fire in the teepee\nwhen they drew near. At the edge of the clearing they gave a loud\n\"_O-hoo–O-hoo–O-hoo-oo,” the Owl cry that they had\nadopted because it is commonly used by the Indians as a night signal,\nand they got the same in reply from within.",
        "“All right,” shouted Caleb; “he done it, an’ he’s bully good stuff and\ngets an uncommon grand coup.”",
        "“Wish I had gone now,” said Guy. “I could ’a’ done it just as well as\nYan.”",
        "“Well, go on now.”",
        "“Oh, there ain’t any stone to get now for proof.”",
        "“You can write your name on the grave, as I did.”",
        "“Ah, that wouldn’t prove nothin’,” and Guy dropped the subject.",
        "Yan did not mean to tell his adventure that night, but his excitement\nwas evident, and they soon got it out of him in full. They were\na weird-looking crowd as they sat around the flickering fire,\nexperiencing as he told it no small measure of the scare he had just\nbeen through.",
        "When he had finished Yan said, “Now, Guy, don’t you want to go and try\nit?”",
        "“Oh, quit,” said Guy; “I never saw such a feller as you for yammering\naway on the same subjek.”",
        "Caleb looked at his watch now, as though about to leave, when Yan\nsaid:",
        "“Say, Mr. Clark, won’t you sleep here? There’s lots o’ room in Guy’s\nbed.”",
        "“Don’t mind if I do, seem’ it’s late.”",
        "The White Revolver",
        "In the morning Caleb had the satisfaction of eating a breakfast\nprepared by the son of his enemy, for Sam was cook that day.",
        "The Great Woodpecker expressed the thought of the whole assembly when\nafter breakfast he said: “Now I want to go and see that grave. I\nbelieve Yan wrote his name on some old cow that was lying down and she\ndidn’t like it and said so out loud!”",
        "They arrived at the spot in a few minutes. Yes, there it was\nplainly written on the rude gravestone, rather shaky, but perfectly\nlegible–\"Yan.”",
        "“Pretty poor writing,” was Guy’s remark.",
        "“Well, you sure done it! Good boy!” said Sam warmly. “Don’t believe\nI’d ’a’ had the grit.”",
        "“Bet I would,” said Guy.",
        "“Here’s where I crossed the ditch. See my trail in the mud? Out there\nis where I heard the yelling. Let’s see if ghosts make tracks. Hallo,\nwhat the–”",
        "There were the tracks in the mud of a big man. He had sprawled,\nfalling on his hands and knees. Here was the print of his hands\nseveral times, and in the mud, half hidden, something shining–Guy saw\nit first and picked it up. It was a white-handled Colt’s revolver.",
        "“Let’s see that,” said Caleb. He wiped off the mud. His eye kindled.\n\"That’s my revolver that was stole from me ’way back, time I lost my\nclothes and money.” He looked it over and, glancing about, seemed lost\nin thought. “This beats me!” He shook his head and muttered from time\nto time, “This beats me!” There seemed nothing more of interest to\nsee, so the boys turned homeward.",
        "On the way back Caleb was evidently thinking hard. He walked in\nsilence till they got opposite Granny de Neuville’s shanty, which was\nthe nearest one to the grave. At the gate he turned and said: “Guess\nI’m going in here. Say, Yan, you didn’t do any of that hollering last\nnight, did you?”",
        "“No, sir; not a word. The only sound I made was dragging the\nring-stone over the boulder.”",
        "“Well, I’ll see you at camp,” he said, and turned in to Granny’s.",
        "“The tap o’ the marnin’ to ye, an’ may yer sowl rest in pace,” was the\ncheery old woman’s greeting. “Come in–come in, Caleb, an’ set down.\nAn’ how is Saryann an’ Dick?”",
        "“They seem happy an’ prosperin’,” said the old man with bitterness.\n\"Say, Granny, did you ever hear the story about Garney’s grave out\nthere on the road?”",
        "“For the love av goodness, an’ how is it yer after askin’ me that now?\nSure an’ I heard the story many a time, an’ I’m after hearin’ the\nghost last night, an’ it’s a-shiverin’ yit Oi am.”",
        "“What did you hear, Granny?”",
        "“Och, an’ it was the most divilish yells iver let out av a soul in\nhell. Shure the Dog and the Cat both av thim was scairt, and the owld\nwhite-faced cow come a-runnin’ an’ jumped the bars to get aff av the\nroad.”",
        "Here was what Caleb wanted, and he kept her going by his evident\ninterest. After she tired of providing more realistic details of\nthe night’s uproar, Caleb deliberately tapped another vintage of\ntittle-tattle in hope of further information leaking out.",
        "“Granny, did you hear of a robbery last week down this side of\nDowney’s Dump?”",
        "“Shure an’ I did not,” she exclaimed, her eyes ablaze with\ninterest–neither had Caleb, for that matter; but he wanted to start\nthe subject–\"An” who was it was robbed?”",
        "“Don’t know, unless it was John Evans’s place.”",
        "“Shure an’ I don’t know him, but I warrant he could sthand to lose.\nShure an’ it’s when the raskils come after me an’ Cal Conner the\nmoment it was talked around that we had sold our Cow; then sez I, it’s\ngittin’ onraisonable, an’ them divils shorely seems to know whin a wad\no’ money passes.”",
        "“That’s the gospel truth. But when wuz you robbed, Granny?”",
        "“Robbed? I didn’t say I wuz robbed,” and she cackled. “But the robbers\nhad the best av intintions when they came to me,” and she related\nat length her experience with the two who broke in when her Cow was\nreported sold. She laughed over their enjoyment of the Lung Balm, and\nbriefly told how the big man was sulky and the short, broad one was\nfunny. Their black beards, the “big wan” with his wounded head, his\nleft-handedness and his accidental exposure of the three fingers of\nthe right hand, all were fully talked over.",
        "“When was it, Granny?”",
        "“Och, shure an’ it wuz about three years apast.”",
        "Then after having had his lungs treated, old Caleb left Granny and set\nout to do some very hard thinking.",
        "There had been robberies all around for the last four years; There was\nno clue but this: They were all of the same character; nothing but\ncash was taken, and the burglars seemed to have inside knowledge of\nthe neighbourhood, and timed all their visits to happen just after the\nhouseholder had come into possession of a roll of bills.",
        "As soon as Caleb turned in at the de Neuville gate, Yan, acting on a\nbelated thought, said:",
        "“Boys, you go on to camp; I’ll be after you in five minutes.” He wanted\nto draw those tracks in the mud and try to trail that man, so went\nback to the grave.",
        "He studied the marks most carefully and by opening out the book he was\nable to draw the boot tracks life-size, noting that each had three\nrows of small hobnails on the heel, apparently put in at home because\nso irregular, while the sole of the left was worn into a hole. Then he\nstudied the hand tracks, selected the clearest, and was drawing the\nright hand when something odd caught his attention.",
        "Yes! It appeared in all the impressions of that hand–the middle\nfinger was gone.",
        "[Illustration: The three-fingered hand-print]",
        "Yan followed the track on the road a little way, but at the corner it\nturned southward and was lost in the grass.",
        "As he was going back to camp he overtook Caleb also returning.",
        "“Mr. Clark,” he said. “I went back to sketch those tracks, and do you\nknow–that man had only three fingers on his right hand?”",
        "“Consarn me!” said Caleb. “Are you sure?”",
        "“Come and see for yourself.”",
        "Yes! It surely was true, and Caleb on the road back said, “Yan, don’t\nsay a word of this to the others just now.”",
        "The old Trapper went to the Pogue house at once. He found the tracks\nrepeated in the dust near the door, but they certainly were not made\nby Dick. On a line was a pair of muddy trousers drying.",
        "From this night Yan went up and Guy went down in the old man’s\nopinion, for he spoke his own mind that day when he gave first place\nto grit. He invited Yan to come to his shanty to see a pair of\nsnow-shoes he was making. The invitation was vague and general, so the\nwhole Tribe accepted. Yan had not been there since his first visit.\nThe first part of their call was as before. In answer to their knock\nthere was a loud baying from the Hound, then a voice ordering him\nback. Caleb opened the door, but now said “Step in.” If he was\ndispleased with the others coming he kept it to himself. While Yan\nwas looking at the snow-shoes Guy discovered something much more\ninteresting on the old man’s bunk; that was the white revolver, now\ncleaned up and in perfect order. Caleb’s delight at its recovery,\nthough not very apparent, was boundless. He had not been able to buy\nhimself another, and this was as warmly welcomed back as though a\nlong-lost only child.",
        "“Say, Caleb, let’s try a shot. I bet I kin beat the hull gang,\"\nexclaimed Sapwood.",
        "Caleb got some cartridges and pointed to a white blaze on a stump\nforty yards away. Guy had three or four shots and Yan had the same\nwithout hitting the stump. Then Caleb said, “Lemme show you.”",
        "His big rugged hand seemed to swallow up the little gun-stock. His\nlong knobbed finger fitted around the lock in a strange but familiar\nway. Caleb was a bent-arm shot, and the short barrel looked like his\nown forefinger pointing at the target as he pumped away six times in\nquick succession. All went into the blaze and two into the charcoal\nspot that marked the centre.",
        "“By George! Look at that for shooting!” and the boys were loud in\ntheir praise.",
        "“Well, twenty year ago I used to be a pretty good shot,” Caleb\nproceeded to explain with an air of unnecessary humility and a very\ngenial expression on his face. “But that’s dead easy. I’ll show you\nsome real tricks.”",
        "Twenty-five feet away he set up three cartridges in a row, their caps\ntoward him, and exploded them in succession with three rapid shots.\nThen he put the revolver in the side pocket of his coat, and\nrecklessly firing it without drawing, much less sighting or even\nshowing it, he peppered a white blaze at twenty yards. Finally he\nlooked around for an old fruit tin. Then he cocked the revolver,\nlaid it across his right hand next the thumb and the tin across the\nfingers. He then threw them both in the air with a jerk that sent the\nrevolver up ten feet and the tin twenty. As the revolver came down he\nseized it and shot a hole through the tin before it could reach the\nground.",
        "The boys were simply dumbfounded. They had used up all their\nexclamations on the first simple target trial.",
        "Caleb stepped into the shanty to get a cleaning-rag for his darling,\nand Sam burst out:",
        "“Well, now I know he never shot at Da, for if he did he’d ’a’ got him\nsure.”",
        "It was not meant for Caleb’s ears, but it reached him, and the old\nTrapper came to the door at once with a long, expressive “H-m-m-mrr.”",
        "Thus was broken the dam of silent scorn, for it was the first time\nCaleb had addressed himself to Sam. The flood had forced the barrier,\nbut it still left plenty of stuff in the channel to be washed away by\ntime and wear, and it was long before he talked to Sam as freely as to\nthe others, but still in time he learned.",
        "There was an air of geniality on all now, and Yan took advantage of\nthis to ask for something he had long kept in mind.",
        "“Mr. Clark, will you take us out for a Coon hunt? We know where there\nare lots of Coons that feed in a corn patch up the creek.”",
        "If Yan had asked this a month ago he would have got a contemptuous\nrefusal. Before the visit to Carney’s grave it might have been, “Oh, I\ndunno–I ain’t got time,” but he was on the right side of Caleb now,\nand the answer was:",
        "“Well, yes! Don’t mind if I do, first night it’s coolish, so the Dog\nkin run.”",

        "The Triumph Of Guy",
        "The boys had hunted the Woodchuck quite regularly since first meeting\nit. Their programme was much the same–each morning about nine or ten\nthey would sneak out to the clover field. It was usually Guy who first\ndiscovered the old Grizzly, then all would fire a harmless shot, the\nWoodchuck would scramble into his den and the incident be closed for\nthe day. This became as much a part of the day’s routine as getting\nbreakfast, and much more so than the washing of the dishes. Once or\ntwice the old Grizzly had narrow escapes, but so far he was none the\nworse, rather the better, being wiser. The boys, on the other\nhand, gained nothing, with the possible exception of Guy. Always\nquick-sighted, his little washed-out optics developed a marvellous\nkeenness. At first it was as often Yan or Sam who saw the old Grizzly,\nbut later it was always Guy.",
        "One morning Sam approached the game from one point, Guy and Yan from\nanother some yards away. “No Woodchuck!” was the first opinion, but\nsuddenly Guy called “I see him.” There in a little hollow fully sixty\nyards from his den, and nearly a hundred from the boys, concealed in a\nbunch of clover, Guy saw a patch of gray fur hardly two inches square.\n\"That’s him, sure.”",
        "Yan could not see it at all. Sam saw but doubted. An instant later\nthe Woodchuck (for it was he) stood up on his hind legs, raised his\nchestnut breast above the clover, and settled all doubt.",
        "“By George!” exclaimed Yan in admiration. ’That is great. You\nhave the most wonderful eyes I ever did see. Your name ought to be\n’Hawkeye’–that should be your name.”",
        "“All right,” shrilled out Guy enthusiastically. “Will you–will\nyou, Sam, will you call me Hawkeye? I think you ought to,” he added\npleadingly.",
        "“I think so, Sam,” said the Second Chief. “He’s turned out great\nstuff, an’ it’s regular Injun.”",
        "“We’ll have to call a Council and settle that. Now let’s to business.”",
        "“Say, Sapwood, you’re so smart, couldn’t you go round through the\nwoods to your side and crawl through the clover so as get between the\nold Grizzly and his den?” suggested the Head Chief.",
        "“I bet I can, an’ I’ll bet a dollar–”",
        "“Here, now,” said Yan, “Injuns don’t have dollars.”",
        "“Well, I’ll bet my scalp–my black scalp, I mean–against Sam’s that I\nkill the old Grizzly first.”",
        "“Oh, let me do it first–you do it second,” said Sam imploringly.",
        "“Errr–yer scared of yer scalp.”",
        "“I’ll go you,” said Sam.",
        "Each of the boys had a piece of black horsehair that he called his\nscalp. It was tied with a string to the top of his head–and this was\nwhat Guy wished to wager.",
        "Yan now interfered: “Quit your squabbling, you Great War Chiefs, an’\n’tend to business. If Woodpecker kills old Grizzly he takes Sapwood’s\nscalp; if Sappy kills him he takes the Woodpecker’s scalp, an’ the\nwinner gets a grand feather, too.”",
        "Sam and Yan waited impatiently in the woods while Guy sneaked around.\nThe Woodchuck seemed unusually bold this day. He wandered far from his\nden and got out of sight in hollows at times. The boys saw Guy crawl\nthrough the fence, though the Woodchuck did not. The fact was, that he\nhad always had the enemy approach him from the other side, and was not\nwatching eastward.",
        "Guy, flat on his breast, worked his way through the clover. He crawled\nabout thirty yards and now was between the Woodchuck and his den.\nStill old Grizzly kept on stuffing himself with clover and watching\ntoward the Raften woods. The boys became intensely excited. Guy could\nsee them, but not the Woodchuck. They pointed and gesticulated. Guy\nthought that meant “Now shoot.” He got up cautiously. The Woodchuck\nsaw him and bounded straight for its den–that is, toward Guy. Guy\nfired wildly. The arrow went ten feet over the Grizzly’s head, and,\nthat “huge, shaking mass of fur” bounding straight at him, struck\nterror to his soul. He backed up hastily, not knowing where to run. He\nwas close to the den.",
        "The Woodchuck chattered his teeth and plunged to get by the boy, each\nas scared as could be. Guy gave a leap of terror and fell heavily just\nas the Woodchuck would have passed under him and home. But the boy\nweighed nearly 100 pounds, and all that weight came with crushing\nforce on old Grizzly, knocking the breath out of his body. Guy\nscrambled to his feet to run for his life, but he saw the Woodchuck\nlying squirming, and plucked up courage enough to give him a couple\nof kicks on the nose that settled him. A loud yell from the other two\nboys was the first thing that assured Guy of his victory. They came\nrunning over and found him standing like the hunter in an amateur\nphotograph, holding his bow in one hand and the big Woodchuck by the\ntail in the other.",
        "[Illustration: The hunter]",
        "“Now, I guess you fellers will come to me to larn you how to kill\nWoodchucks. Ain’t he an old socker? I bet he weighs fifty pounds–yes,\nnear sixty.” (It weighed about ten pounds.)",
        "“Good boy! Bully boy! Hooray for the Third War Chief! Hooray for Chief\nSapwood!” and Guy had no cause to complain of lack of appreciation on\nthe part of the others.",
        "He swelled out his chest and looked proud and haughty. “Wished I knew\nwhere there was some more Woodchucks,” he said. ’I know how to\nget them, if the rest don’t.”",
        "“Well, that should count for a grand coup, Sappy.”",
        "[Illustration: “Guy gave a leap of terror and fell.\"]",
        "“You tole me you wuz goin’ to call me ’Hawkeye’ after this morning.”",
        "“We’ll have to have a Grand Council to fix that up,” replied the Head\nChief.",
        "“All right; let’s have it this afternoon, will you?”",
        "“All right.”",
        "“’Bout four o’clock?”",
        "“Why, yes; any time.”",
        "“And you’ll fix me up as ’Hawkeye,’ and give me a dandy Eagle feather\nfor killing the Woodchuck, at four o’clock?”",
        "“Yes, sure, only, why do you want it at four o’clock?”",
        "But Guy seemed not to hear, and right away after dinner he\ndisappeared.",
        "“He’s dodging the dishwashing again,” suggested the Woodpecker.",
        "“No, he isn’t,” said the Second Chief. “I believe he’s going to bring\nhis folks to see him in his triumph.”",
        "“That’s so. Let’s chip right in and make it an everlasting old\nblowout–kind of a new date in history. You’ll hear me lie like sixty\nto help him out.”",
        "“Good enough. I’m with you. You go and get your folks. I’ll go after\nold Caleb, and we’ll fix it up to call him ’Hawkeye’ and give him his\ngrand coup feather all at once.”",
        "“’Feard my folks and Caleb wouldn’t mix,” replied Sam, “but I believe\nfor a splurge like this Guy’d ruther have my folks. You see, Da has\nthe mortgage on their place.”",
        "So it was agreed Sam was to go for his mother, while Yan was to\nprepare the Eagle feather and skin the Woodchuck.",
        "It was not “as big as a bear,” but it was a very large Woodchuck, and\nYan was as much elated over the victory as any of them. He still had\nan hour or more before four o’clock, and eager to make Guy’s triumph\nas Indian as possible, he cut off all the Woodchuck’s claws, then\nstrung them on a string, with a peeled and pithed Elder twig an inch\nlong between each two. Some of the claws were very, very small, but\nthe intention was there to make a Grizzly-claw necklace.",
        "Guy made for home as fast as he could go. His father hailed him as he\nneared the garden and evidently had plans of servitude, but Guy\ndarted into the dining-room-living-room-bedroom-kitchen-room, which\nconstituted nine-tenths of the house.",
        "“Oh, Maw, you just ought to seen me; you just want to come this\nafternoon–I’m the Jim Dandy of the hull Tribe, an they’re going to\nmake me Head Chief. I killed that whaling old Woodchuck that pooty\nnigh killed Paw. They couldn’t do a thing without me–them fellers in\ncamp. They tried an’ tried more’n a thousand times to get that old\nWoodchuck–yes, I bet they tried a million times, an’ I just waited\ntill they was tired and give up, then I says, ’Now, I’ll show you\nhow.’ First I had to point him out. Them fellers is no good to see\nthings. Then I says, ’Now, Sam and Yan, you fellers stay here, an’\njust to show how easy it is when you know how, I’ll leave all my\nbosenarrers behind an’ go with nothing.’ Wall, there they stood an’\nwatched me, an’ I s-n-e-a-k-e-d round the fence an’ c-r-a-w-l-e-d in\nthe clover just like an Injun till I got between him an’ his hole, and\nthen I hollers and he come a-snortin’ an’ a-chatterin’ his teeth at\nme to chaw me up, for he seen I had no stick nor nothin’, an’ I never\nturned a hair; I kep’ cool an’ waited till jest as he was going to\njump for my throat, then I turned and gave him one kick on the snoot\nthat sent him fifty feet in the air, an’ when he come down he was\ndeader’n Kilsey’s hen when she was stuffed with onions. Oh, Maw, I’m\njust the bully boy; they can’t do nothin’ in camp ’thout me. I had to\nlarn ’em to hunt Deer an’ see things–an’–an’–an’–lots o’ things,\nso they are goin’ to make me Head Chief of the hull Tribe, an’ call\nme ’Hawkeye,’ too; that’s the way the Injuns does. It’s to be at four\no’clock this afternoon, an’ you got to come.”",
        "Burns scoffed at the whole thing and told Guy to get to work at the\npotatoes, and if he left down the bars so that the Pig got out he’d\nskin him alive; he would have no such fooling round his place. But Mrs\nBurns calmly informed him that she was going. It was to her\nmuch like going to see a university degree conferred on her boy.",
        "Since Burns would not assist, the difficulty of the children now\narose. This, however, was soon settled. They should go along. It was\ntwo hours’ toil for the mother to turn the four brown-limbed, nearly\nnaked, dirty, happy towsle-tops into four little martyrs, befrocked,\nberibboned, becombed and be-booted. Then they all straggled across the\nfield, Mrs. Burns carrying the baby in one arm and a pot of jam in\nthe other. Guy ran ahead to show the way, and four-year-old,\nthree-year-old and two-year-old, hand in hand, formed a diagonal line\nin the wake of the mother.",
        "They were just a little surprised on getting to camp to find Mrs.\nRaften and Minnie there in holiday clothes. Marget’s first feeling was\nresentment, but her second thought was a pleasant one. That “stuck-up\"\nwoman, the enemy’s wife, should see her boy’s triumph, and Mrs. Burns\nat once seized on the chance to play society cat.",
        "“How do ye do, Mrs. Raften; hope you’re well,” she said with a tinge\nof malicious pleasure and a grand attempt at assuming the leadership.",
        "“Quite well, thank you. We came down to see how the boys were getting\non in camp.”",
        "“They’ve got on very nicely sense my boy j’ined them,” retorted\nMrs. Burns, still fencing.",
        "“So I understand; the other two have become very fond of him,\"\nreturned Mrs. Raften, seeking to disarm her enemy.",
        "This speech had its effect. Mrs. Burns aimed only to forestall the\nfoe, but finding to her surprise that the enemy’s wife was quite\ngentle, a truce was made, and by the time Mrs. Raften had petted and\npraised the four tow-tops and lauded Guy to the utmost the air of\nlatent battle was replaced by one of cordiality.",
        "The boys now had everything ready for the grand ceremony. On the\nCalfskin rug at one end was the Council; Guy, seated on the skin of\nthe Woodchuck and nearly hiding it from view, Sam on his left hand\nand Yan with the drum, on his right. In the middle the Council fire\nblazed. To give air, the teepee cover was raised on the shady side and\nthe circle of visitors was partly in the teepee and partly out.",
        "The Great War Chief first lighted the peace pipe, puffed for a minute,\nthen blew off the four smokes to the four winds and handed it to the\nSecond and Third War Chiefs, who did the same.",
        "Little Beaver gave three thumps on the drum for silence, and the Great\nWoodpecker rose up:",
        "“Big Chiefs, Little Chiefs, Braves, Warriors, Councillors, Squaws,\nand Papooses of the Sanger Indians: When our Tribe was at war with\nthem–them–them–other Injuns–them Birchbarks, we took prisoner one\nof their warriors and tortured him to death two or three times, and he\nshowed such unusual stuff that we took him into our Tribe–”",
        "Loud cries of “How–How–How,” led by Yan.",
        "“We gave a sun-dance for his benefit, but he didn’t brown–seemed too\ngreen–so we called him Sapwood. From that time he has fought his way\nup from the ranks and got to be Third War Chief–”",
        "“How–How–How.”",
        "“The other day the hull Tribe j’ined to attack an’ capture a big\nGrizzly and was licked bad, when the War Chief Sapwood came to the\nrescue an’ settled the owld baste with one kick on the snoot. Deeds\nlike this is touching. A feller that kin kick like that didn’t orter\nbe called Sapwood nor Saphead nor Sapanything. No, sirree! It ain’t\nright. He’s the littlest Warrior among the War Chiefs, but he kin see\nfarder an’ do it oftener an’ better than his betters. He kin see round\na corner or through a tree. ’Cept maybe at night, he’s the swell seer\nof the outfit, an’ the Council has voted to call him ’Hawkeye.’”",
        "“How–How–How–How–How–”",
        "Here Little Beaver handed the Head War Chief a flat white stick on\nwhich was written in large letters “Sapwood.”",
        "“Here’s the name he went by before he was great an’ famous, an’ this\nis the last of it.” The Chief put the stick in the fire, saying, “Now\nlet us see if you’re too green to burn.” Little Beaver then handed\nWoodpecker a fine Eagle feather, red-tufted, and bearing in outline\na man with a Hawk’s head and an arrow from his eye. “This here’s a\nswagger Eagle feather for the brave deed he done, and tells about him\nbeing Hawkeye, too” (the feather was stuck in Guy’s hair and the claw\nnecklace put about his neck amid loud cries of “How–How–” and thumps\nof the drum), “and after this, any feller that calls him Sapwood has to\ndouble up and give Hawkeye a free kick.”",
        "There was a great chorus of “How–How.” Guy tried hard to look\ndignified and not grin, but it got beyond him. He was smiling right\nacross and half way round. His mother beamed with pride till her eyes\ngot moist and overflowed.",
        "Every one thought the ceremony was over, but Yan stood up and began:\n\"There is something that has been forgotten, Chiefs, Squaws and\nPappooses of the Sanger Nation: When we went out after this Grizzly I\nwas witness to a bargain between two of the War Chiefs. According to a\ncustom of our Tribe, they bet their scalps, each that he would be the\none to kill the Grizzly. The Head Chief Woodpecker was one and Hawkeye\nwas the other. Hawkeye, you can help yourself to Woodpecker’s scalp.”",
        "Sam had forgotten about this, but he bowed his head. Guy cut the\nstring, and holding up the scalp, he uttered a loud, horrible\nwar-whoop which every one helped with some sort of noise. It was the\ncrowning event. Mrs. Burns actually wept for joy to see her heroic boy\nproperly recognized at last.",
        "Then she went over to Sam and said, “Did you bring your folks here to\nsee my boy get praised?”",
        "Sam nodded and twinkled an eye.",
        "“Well, I don’t care who ye are, Raften or no Raften, you got a good\nheart, an’ it’s in the right place. I never did hold with them as says\n’There ain’t no good in a Raften.’ I always hold there’s some good in\nevery human. I know your Paw did buy the mortgage on our place,\nbut I never did believe your Maw stole our Geese, an’ I never\nwill, an’ next time I hear them runnin’ on the Raftens I’ll jest\nopen out an’ tell what I know.”",
        "[Illustration: The picture on the Teepee Lining, to record Guy’s\nExploit.]",
        "The Coon Hunt",
        "Yan did not forget the proposed Coon hunt–in fact, he was most\nimpatient for it, and within two days the boys came to Caleb about\nsundown and reminded him of his promise. It was a sultry night, but\nYan was sure it was just right for a Coon hunt, and his enthusiasm\ncarried all before it. Caleb was quietly amused at the ’cool\nnight_” selected, but reckoned it would be “better later.”",
        "“Set down–set down, boys,” he said, seeing them standing ready for an\nimmediate start. “There’s no hurry. Coons won’t be running for three\nor four hours after sundown.”",
        "So he sat and smoked, while Sam vainly tried to get acquainted with\nold Turk; Yan made notes on some bird wings nailed to the wall,\nand Guy got out the latest improved edition of his exploits in\nDeer-hunting and Woodchuck killing, as well as enlarged on his plans\nfor gloriously routing any Coon they might encounter.",
        "By insisting that it would take an hour to get to the place, Yan\ngot them started at nine o’clock, Caleb, on a suggestion from Guy,\ncarrying a small axe. Keeping old Turk well in hand, they took the\nhighway, and for half an hour tramped on toward the “Corners.” Led by\nSam, they climbed a fence crossed a potato field, and reached the corn\npatch by the stream.",
        "“Go ahead, Turk. Sic him! Sic him! Sic him!” and the company sat in a\nrow on the fence to await developments.",
        "Turk was somewhat of a character. He hunted what he pleased and when\nhe pleased. His master could bring him on the Coon grounds, but he\ncouldn’t make him hunt Coon nor anything else unless it suited his own\nfancy. Caleb had warned the boys to be still, and they sat along the\nfence in dead silence, awaiting the summons from the old Hound. He had\ngone off beating and sniffing among the cornstalks. His steps sounded\nvery loud and his sniffs like puffs of steam. It was a time of tense\nattention; but the Hound wandered, farther away, and even his noisy\nsteps were lost.",
        "They had sat for two long minutes, when a low yelp from a distant part\nof the field, then a loud ’bow-wow” from the Hound, set Yan’s\nheart jumping.",
        "“Game afoot,” said Sam in a low voice.",
        "“Bet I heered him first,” piped Guy.",
        "Yan’s first thought was to rush pell-mell after the Dog. He had often\nread of the hunt following furiously the baying of the Hounds, but\nCaleb restrained him.",
        "“Hold on, boy; plenty of time. Don’t know yet what it is.”",
        "For Turk, like most frontier Hounds, would run almost any trail–had\neven been accused of running on his own–and it rested with those who\nknew him best to discover from his peculiar style of tonguing just\nwhat the game might be. But they waited long and patiently without\ngetting another bay from the Hound. Presently a rustling was heard and\nTurk came up to his master and lay down at his feet.",
        "“Go ahead, Turk, put him up,” but the Dog stirred not. “Go ahead,” and\nCaleb gave him a rap with a small stick. The Dog dodged away, but lay\ndown again, panting.",
        "“What was it, Mr. Clark?” demanded Yan.",
        "“Don’t hardly know. Maybe he only spiked himself on a snag. But this\nis sure; there’s no Coons here to-night. There won’t be after this. We\ncome too early, and it’s too hot for the Dog, anyway.”",
        "“We could cross the creek and go into Boyle’s bush,” suggested the\nWoodpecker. “We’re like to strike anything there. Larry de Neuville\nswears he saw a Unicorn there the night he came back from Garney’s\nwake.”",
        "“How can you tell the kind of game by the Dog’s barking?” asked Yan.",
        "“H-m!” answered Caleb, as he put a fresh quid in his lantern jaw. “You\nsurely can if you know the country an’ the game an’ the Dog. Course,\nno two Dogs is alike; you got to study your Dog, an’ if he’s good\nhe’ll larn you lots about trailing.”",
        "The brook was nearly dry now, so they crossed where they would. Then\nfeeling their way through the dark woods with eyes for the most part\nclosed, they groped toward Boyle’s open field, then across it to the\nheavy timber. Turk had left them at the brook, and, following its\ncourse till he came to a pool, had had a bath. As they entered the\ntimber tract he joined them, dripping wet and ready for business.",
        "“Go ahead, Turk,” and again all sat down to await the opinion of the\nexpert.",
        "It came quickly. The old Hound, after circling about in a way that\nseemed to prove him independent of daylight, began to sniff loudly,\nand gave a low whine. He followed a little farther, and now his tail\nwas heard to ’tap, tap, tap_’ the brush as he went through a dry\nthicket.",
        "“Hear that? He’s got something this time,” said Caleb in a low voice.\n\"Wait a little.”",
        "The Hound was already working out a puzzle, and when at last he got\nfar enough to be sure, he gave a short bark. There was another\nspell of sniffing, then another bark, then several little barks at\nintervals, and at last a short bay; then the baying recommenced, but\nwas irregular and not full-chested. The sounds told that the Hound was\nrunning in a circle about the forest, but at length ceased moving,\nfor all the barking was at one place. When the hunters got there\nthey found the Dog half-way in a hole under a stump, barking and\nscratching.",
        "“Humph,” said Caleb; “nothing but a Cottontail. Might ’a’ knowed that\nby the light scent an’ the circling without treeing.”",
        "So Turk was called off and the company groped through the inky woods\nin quest of more adventures.",
        "“There’s a kind of swampy pond down the lower end of the bush–a\nlikely place for Coons on a Frog-hunt,” suggested the Woodpecker.",
        "So the Hound was again “turned on” near the pond. The dry woods were\npoor for scent, but the damp margin of the marsh proved good, and Turk\nbecame keenly interested and very sniffy. A preliminary ’Woof!_\"\nwas followed by one or two yelps and then a full-chested\n\"_Boooow!” that left no doubt he had struck a hot trail at last.\nOh, what wonderfully thrilling horn-blasts those were! Yan for the\nfirst time realized the power of the “full cry,” whose praises are so\noften sung.",
        "The hunters sat down to await the result, for, as Caleb pointed out,\nthere was “no saying where the critter might run.”",
        "The Hound bayed his fullest, roundest notes at quick intervals, but\ndid not circle. The sound of his voice told them that the chase was\nstraight away, out of the woods, easterly across an open field, and at\na hot pace, with regular, full bellowing, unbroken by turn or doubt.",
        "“I believe he’s after the old Callaghan Fox,” said the Trapper.\n\"They’ve tried it together before now, an’ there ain’t anything but a\nFox will run so straight and fetch such a tune out of Turk.”",
        "The baying finally was lost in the distance, probably a mile away, but\nthere was nothing for it but to wait. If Turk had been a full-bred and\ntrained Foxhound he would have stuck to that trail all night, but in\nhalf an hour he returned, puffing and hot, to throw himself into the\nshallow pond.",
        "“Everything scared away now,” remarked Caleb. “We might try the other\nside of the pond.” Once or twice the dog became interested, but\ndecided that there was nothing in it, and returned to pant by his\nmaster’s feet.",
        "They had now travelled so far toward home that a very short cut across\nfields would bring them into their own woods.",
        "The moon arose as they got there, and after their long groping in the\nmurky darkness this made the night seem very bright and clear.",
        "They had crossed the brook below Granny de Neuville’s, and were\nfollowing the old timber trail that went near the stream, when Turk\nstopped to sniff, ran back and forth two or three times, then stirred\nthe echoes with a full-toned bugle blast and led toward the water.",
        "“_Bow–bow–bow–bow,” he bawled for forty yards and came to a\nstop. The baying was exactly the same that he gave on the Fox trail,\nbut the course of the animal was crooked, and now there was a break.",
        "They could hear the dog beating about close at hand and far away, but\nsilent so far as tongue was concerned.",
        "“What is it, Caleb?” said Sam with calm assurance, forgetting how\nrecent was their acquaintance.",
        "“Dunno,” was the short reply.",
        "“’Tisn’t a Fox, is it?” asked Yan.",
        "But a sudden renewal of ’Bow–bow–bow–” from the Hound one\nhundred yards away, at the fence, ended all discussion. The dog had\nthe hot trail again. The break had been along the line of a fence that\nshowed, as Caleb said, “It was a Coon, ’cept it might be some old\nhouse Cat maybe; them was the only things that would run along top of\na fence in the night time.”",
        "It was easy to follow now; the moonlight was good, and the baying of\nthe Hound was loud and regular. It led right down the creek, crossing\nseveral pools and swamps.",
        "“That settles it,” remarked the Trapper decisively. “Cats don’t take\nto the water. That’s a Coon,” and as they hurried they heard a sudden\nchange in the dog’s note, no longer a deep rich ’B-o-o-w-w.’ It\nbecame an outrageous clamour of mingled yelps, growls and barks.",
        "“Ha–heh. That means he’s right on it. That is what he does when he\nsees the critter.”",
        "But the “view halloo” was quickly dropped and the tonguing of the dog\nwas now in short, high-pitched yelps at one place.",
        "“Jest so! He’s treed! That’s a Coon, all right!” and Caleb led\nstraight for the place.",
        "The Hound was barking and leaping against a big Basswood, and Caleb’s\ncomment was: “Hm, never knowed a Coon to do any other way–always gets\nup the highest and tarnalest tree to climb in the hull bush. Now who’s\nthe best climber here?”",
        "“Yan is,” volunteered Sam.",
        "“Kin ye do it, Yan?”",
        "“I’ll try.”",
        "“Guess we’ll make a fire first and see if we can’t see him,” said the\nWoodpecker.",
        "“If it was a Woodchuck I’d soon get him for you,” chimed in Hawkeye,\nbut no one heeded.",
        "Sam and Yan gathered stuff and soon had a flood of flickering red\nlight on all the surrounding trees. They scanned the big Basswood\nwithout getting sight of their quarry. Caleb took a torch and found on\nthe bark some fresh mud. By going back on the trail to where it had\ncrossed the brook they found the footprint–undoubtedly that of a\nlarge Coon.",
        "“Reckon he’s in some hollow; he’s surely up that tree, and Basswood’s\nare always hollow.”",
        "Yan now looked at the large trunk in doubt as to whether he could\nmanage it.",
        "Caleb remarked his perplexity and said: “Yes; that’s so. You ain’t\nfifteen foot spread across the wings, are you? But hold on–”",
        "He walked to a tall thin tree near at hand, cut it through with the\naxe in a few minutes, and threw it so as to rest against the lowest\nbranch of the big Basswood. Up this Yan easily swarmed, carrying a\nstout Elm stick tied behind. When he got to the great Basswood he felt\nlost in the green mass, but the boys below carried torches so as to\nshed light on each part in turn. At first Yan found neither hole in\nthe trunk nor Coon, but after long search in the upper branches he saw\na great ball of fur on a high crotch and in it two glowing eyes that\ngave him a thrill. He yelled: “Here he is! Look out below.” He climbed\nup nearer and tried to push the Coon off, but it braced itself firmly\nand defied him until he climbed above it, when it leaped and scrambled\nto a lower branch.",
        "Yan followed it, while his companions below got greatly excited, as\nthey could see nothing, and only judged by the growling and snarling\nthat Yan and the Coon were fighting. After another passage at arms\nthe Coon left the second crotch and scrambled down the trunk till it\nreached the leaning sapling, and there perched, glaring at the hunters\nbelow. The old Hound raised a howl when he saw the quarry, and Caleb,\nstepping to one side, drew his revolver and fired. The Coon fell dead\ninto their midst. Turk sprang to do battle, but he was not needed, and\nCaleb fondly and proudly wiped the old white pistol as though it alone\nwere to be thanked for the clever shot.",
        "Yan came down quickly, though he found it harder to get down than up.\nHe hurried excitedly into the ring and stroked the Coon with a mixture\nof feelings–admiring its fur–sorry, after all, that it was killed,\nand triumphant that he had led the way. It was his Coon, and\nall admitted that. Sam “hefted” it by one leg and said, “Weighs thirty\npounds, I bet.”",
        "Guy said: “Pooh! Tain’t half as big as that there big Woodchuck I\nkilled, an’ you never would have got him if I hadn’t thought of the\naxe.”",
        "Yan thought it would weigh thirty-five pounds. Caleb guessed it at\ntwenty-five (and afterward they found out that it barely weighed\neighteen). While they were thus talking the Dog broke into an angry\nbarking such as he gave for strangers–his “human voice,” Caleb called\nit–and at once there stepped into the circle William Raften. He had\nseen the lights in the woods, and, dreading a fire at this dry season,\nhad dressed and come out.",
        "“Hello, Da; why ain’t you in bed, where you ought to be?”",
        "Raften took no notice of his son, but said sneeringly to Caleb: “Ye\nain’t out trying to get another shot at me, air ye?” ’Tain’t worth\nyour while; I hain’t got no cash on me to-night.”",
        "“Now see here, Da,” said Sam, interrupting before Caleb could answer,\n\"you don’t play fair. I know, an’ you ought to know, that’s all rot\nabout Caleb shooting at you. If he had, he’d ’a’ got you sure. I’ve\nseen him shoot.”",
        "“Not when he was drunk.”",
        "“Last time I was drunk we was in it together,” said Caleb fiercely,\nfinding his voice.",
        "“Purty good for a man as swore he had no revolver,” and Raften pointed\nto Caleb’s weapon. “I seen you with that ten years ago. An’ sure\nI’m not scairt of you an’ yer revolver,” said Raften, seeing Caleb\nfingering his white pet; “an’ I tell ye this. I won’t have ye and yer\nSheep-killing cur ramatacking through my woods an’ making fires this\ndry saison.”",
        "“D–– you, Raften, I’ve stood all I’m goin’ to stand from you.” The\nrevolver was out in a flash, and doubtless Caleb would have lived up\nto his reputation, but Sam, springing to push his father back, came\nbetween, and Yan clung to Caleb’s revolver arm, while Guy got safely\nbehind a tree.",
        "“Get out o’ the way, you kids!” snarled Caleb.",
        "“By all manes,” said Raften scoffingly; “now that he’s got me\nunarrumed again. You dhirty coward! Get out av the way, bhoys, an\nOi’ll settle him,” for Raften was incapable of fear, and the boys\nwould have been thrust aside and trouble follow, but that Raften as he\nleft the house had called his two hired men to follow and help fight\nthe fire, and now they came on the scene. One of them was quite\nfriendly with Caleb, the other neutral, and they succeeded in stopping\nhostilities for a time, while Sam exploded:",
        "“Now see here, Da, ’twould just ’a’ served you right if you’d got a\nhole through you. You make me sick, running on Caleb. He didn’t make\nthat fire; ’twas me an’ Yan, an’ we’ll put it out safe enough. You\nskinned Caleb an’ he never done you no harm. You run on him just as\nGranny de Neuville done on you after she grabbed your groceries. You\nought to be ashamed of yourself. Tain’t square, an’ ’tain’t being a\nman. When you can’t prove nothin’ you ought to shut up.”",
        "Raften was somewhat taken aback by this outburst, especially as he\nfound all the company against him. He had often laughed at Granny de\nNeuville’s active hatred against him when he had done her nothing but\ngood. It never occurred to him that he was acting a similar part. Most\nmen would have been furious at the disrespectful manner of their son,\nbut Raften was as insensitive as he was uncowardly. His first shock\nof astonishment over, his only thought of Sam was, “Hain’t he got a\ncheek! My! but he talks like a lawyer, an’ he sasses right back like a\nfightin’ man; belave I’ll make him study law instid of tooth-pullin’.”",
        "The storm was over, for Caleb’s wrath was of the short and fierce\nkind, and Raften, turning away in moral defeat, growled: “See that ye\nput that fire out safe. Ye ought all to be in yer beds an’ aslape,\nlike dacint folks.”",
        "“Well, ain’t you dacint?” retorted Sam.",
        "Raften turned away, heeding neither that nor Guy’s shrill attempt\nto interpolate some details of his own importance in this present\nhunt–\"Ef it hadn’t been for me they wouldn’t had no axe along, Mr.\nRaften\"–but William had disappeared.",
        "The boys put out the fire carefully and made somewhat silently for\ncamp. Sam and Yan carried the Coon between them on a stick, and before\nthey reached the teepee they agreed that the carcass weighed at least\neighty pounds.",
        "Caleb left them, and they all turned in at once and slept the sleep of\nthe tired camper.",
        "The Banshee’s Wail and the Huge Night Prowler",
        "Next day while working on the Coon-skin Sam and Yan discussed\nthoroughly the unpleasant incident of the night before, but they\ndecided that it would be unwise to speak of it to Caleb unless he\nshould bring up the subject, and Guy was duly cautioned.",
        "That morning Yan went to the mud albums on one of his regular rounds\nand again found, first that curious hoof-mark that had puzzled\nhim before, and down by the pond album the track of a very large\nbird–much like a Turkey track, indeed. He brought Caleb to see them.\nThe Trapper said that one was probably the track of a Blue Crane\n(Heron), and the other, “Well, I don’t hardly know; but it looks to me\nmighty like the track of a big Buck–only there ain’t any short of the\nLong Swamp, and that’s ten miles at least. Of course, when there’s\nonly out it ain’t a track; it’s an accident.”",
        "“Yes; but I’ve found lots of them–a trail every time, but not quite\nenough to follow.”",
        "That night after dark, when he was coming to camp with the product of\na “massacree,” Yan heard a peculiar squawking, guttural sound that\nrose from the edge of the pond and increased in strength, drawing\nnearer, till it was a hideous and terrifying uproar. It was exactly\nthe sound that Guy had provoked on that first night when he came and\ntried to frighten the camp. It passed overhead, and Yan saw for a\nmoment the form of a large slow-flying bird.",
        "Next day it was Yan’s turn to cook. At sunrise, as he went for water,\nhe saw a large Blue Heron rise from the edge of the pond and fly on\nheavy pinions away over the tree-tops. It was a thrilling sight. The\nboy stood gazing after it, absolutely rapt with delight, and when it\nwas gone he went to the place where it rose and found plenty of large\ntracks just like the one he had sketched. Unquestionably it was the\nsame bird as on the night before, and the mystery of the Wolf with the\nsore throat was solved. This explanation seemed quite satisfactory to\neverybody but Guy. He had always maintained stoutly that the woods\nwere full of Bears right after sundown. Where they went at other times\nwas a mystery, but he “reckoned he hadn’t yet run across the bird that\ncould scare him–no, nor the beast, nuther.”",
        "Caleb agreed that the grating cry must be that of the Blue Crane, but\nthe screech and wail in the tree-tops at night he could shed no light\non.",
        "There were many other voices of the night that became more or less\nfamiliar. Some of them were evidently birds; one was the familiar\nSong-Sparrow, and high over the tree-tops from the gloaming sky they\noften heard a prolonged sweet song. It was not till years afterward\nthat Yan found out this to be the night-song of the Oven-bird, but he\nwas able to tell them at once the cause of the startling outcry that\nhappened one evening an hour after sundown.",
        "The Woodpecker was outside, the other two inside the teepee. A\npeculiar sound fell on his ear. It kept on–a succession of long\nwhines, and getting stronger. As it gave no sign of ending, Sam called\nthe other boys. They stood in a row there and heard this peculiar\n\"_whine, whine, whine_” develop into a loud, harsh ’whow,\nwhow, whow.”",
        "“It must be some new Heron cry,” Yan whispered.",
        "But the sound kept on increasing till it most resembled the yowling\nof a very strong-voiced Cat, and still grew till each separate\n\"_meow_” might have been the yell of a Panther. Then at its\nhighest and loudest there was a prolonged ’meow” and silence,\nfollowed finally by the sweet chant of the Song-sparrow.",
        "A great light dawned on Little Beaver. Now he remembered that voice in\nGlenyan so long ago, and told the others with an air of certainty:",
        "“Boys, that’s the yelling of a Lynx,” and the next day Caleb said that\nYan was right.",
        "Some days later they learned that another lamb had been taken from the\nRaften flock that night.",
        "In the morning Yan took down the tom-tom for a little music and found\nit flat and soft.",
        "“Hallo,” said he; “going to rain.”",
        "Caleb looked up at him with an amused expression. “You’re a reg’lar\nInjun. It’s surely an Injun trick that. When the tom-tom won’t sing\nwithout being warmed at the fire they allus says ’rain before night.’”",
        "The Trapper stayed late that evening. It had been cloudy all the\nafternoon, and at sundown it began to rain, so he was invited to\nsupper. The shower grew heavier instead of ending. Caleb went out and\ndug a trench all round the teepee to catch the rain, then a leader to\ntake it away. After supper they sat around the campfire in the teepee;\nthe wind arose and the rain beat down. Yan had to go out and swing the\nsmoke poles, and again his ear was greeted with the screech. He\nbrought in an armful of wood and made the inside of the teepee a blaze\nof cheerful light. A high wind now came in gusts, so that the canvas\nflopped unpleasantly on the poles.",
        "“Where’s your anchor rope?” asked the Trapper.",
        "Sam produced the loose end; the other was fastened properly to the\npoles above. It had never been used, for so far the weather had been\nfine; but now Caleb sunk a heavy stake, lashed the anchor rope to that,\nthen went out and drove all the pegs a little deeper, and the Tribe\nfelt safe from any ordinary storm.",
        "There was nothing to attract the old Trapper to his own shanty. His\nheirs had begun to forget that he needed food, and what little they\ndid send was of vilest quality. The old man was as fond of human\nsociety as any one, and was easily persuaded now to stay all night,\n\"if you can stand Guy for a bedfeller.” So Caleb and Turk settled down\nfor a comfortable evening within, while the storm raged without.",
        "“Say, don’t you touch that canvas, Guy; you’ll make it leak.”",
        "“What, me? Oh, pshaw! How can it leak for a little thing like that?\"\nand Guy slapped it again in bravado.",
        "“All right, it’s on your side of the bed,” and sure enough, within two\nminutes a little stream of water was trickling from the place he had\nrubbed, while elsewhere the canvas turned every drop.",
        "This is well known to all who have camped under canvas during a storm,\nand is more easily remembered than explained.",
        "The smoke hung heavy in the top of the teepee and kept crowding down\nuntil it became unpleasant.",
        "“Lift the teepee cover on the windward side, Yan. There, that’s\nit–but hold on,” as a great gust came in, driving the smoke and ashes\naround in whirlwinds. “You had ought to have a lining. Give me that\ncanvas: that’ll do.” Taking great care not to touch the teepee cover,\nCaleb fastened the lining across three pole spaces so that the opening\nunder the canvas was behind it. This turned the draught from their\nbacks and, sending it over their heads, quickly cleared the teepee of\nsmoke as well as kept off what little rain entered by the smoke hole.",
        "“It’s on them linings the Injuns paint their records and adventures.\nThey mostly puts their totems on the outside an’ their records on the\nlining.”",
        "“Bully,” said Sam; “now there’s a job for you. Little Beaver; by the\ntime you get our adventures on the inside and our totems on the out I\ntell you we’ll be living in splendour.”",
        "“I think,” answered Yan indirectly, “we ought to take Mr. Clark into\nthe Tribe. Will you be our Medicine Man?” Caleb chuckled in a quiet\nway, apparently consenting. “Now I have four totems to paint on the\noutside,” and this was the beginning of the teepee painting that Yan\ncarried out with yellow clay, blue clay dried to a white, yellow clay\nburned to red, and charcoal, all ground in Coon grease and Pine gum,\nto be properly Indian. He could easily have gotten bright colours\nin oil paint, but scorned such White-man’s truck, and doubtless the\ngeneral effect was all the better for it.",
        "“Say, Caleb,” piped Guy, “tell us about the Injuns–about their\nbravery. Bravery is what I like,” he added with emphasis,\nconscious of being now on his own special ground. “Why, I mind the\ntime that old Woodchuck was coming roaring at me–I bet some fellers\nwould just ’a’ been so scared–”",
        "“_Hssh!_” said Sam.",
        "Caleb smoked in silence. The rain pattered on the teepee without; the\nwind heaved the cover. They all sat silently. Then sounded loud\nand clear a terrifying ’scrrrrrr–oouwurr.” The boys were\nstartled–would have been terrified had they been outside or alone.",
        "“That’s it–that’s the Banshee,” whispered Sam.",
        "Caleb looked up sharply.",
        "“What is it?” queried Yan. “We’ve heard it a dozen times, at least.”",
        "Caleb shook his head, made no reply, but turned to his Dog. Turk was\nlying on his side by the fire, and at this piercing screech he had\nmerely lifted his head, looked backward over his shoulder, turned his\nbig sad eyes on his master, then laid down again.",
        "“Turk don’t take no stock in it.”",
        "“Dogs never hear a Banshee,” objected Sam, “no more than they can see\na ghost; anyway, that’s what Granny de Neuville says.” So the Dog’s\nnegative testimony was the reverse of comforting.",
        "“Hawkeye,” said the Woodpecker, “you’re the bravest one of the crowd.\nDon’t you want to go out and try a shot at the Banshee? I’ll lend you\nmy Witch-hazel arrow. We’ll give you a grand coup feather if\nyou hit him. Go ahead, now–you know bravery is what you like.”",
        "“Yer nothin’ but a passel o’ blame dumb fools,” was the answer, “an’ I\nwouldn’t be bothered talking to ye. Caleb, tell us something about the\nIndians.”",
        "“What the Injuns love is bravery,” said the Medicine Man with a\ntwinkle in his eye, and everybody but Guy laughed, not very loudly,\nfor each was restrained by the thought that he would rather not\nbe called upon to show his bravery to-night.",
        "“I’m going to bed,” said Hawkeye with unnecessary energy.",
        "“Don’t forget to roost under the waterspout you started when you got\nfunny,” remarked the Woodpecker.",
        "Yan soon followed Guy’s example, and Sam, who had already learned to\nsmoke, sat up with Caleb. Not a word passed between them until after\nGuy’s snore and Yan’s regular puffs told of sound sleep, when Sam,\ntaking advantage of a long-awaited chance, opened out rather abruptly:",
        "“Say, Caleb, I ain’t going to side with no man against Da, but I know\nhim just about as well as he knows me. Da’s all right; he’s plumb and\nsquare, and way down deep he’s got an awful kind heart; it’s pretty\ndeep, I grant you, but it’s there, O.K. The things he does on the\nquiet to help folks is done on the quiet and ain’t noticed. The things\nhe does to beat folks–an’ he does do plenty–is talked all over\ncreation. But I know he has a wrong notion of you, just as you have of\nhim, and it’s got to be set right.”",
        "Sam’s good sense was always evident, and now, when he laid aside his\nbuffoonery, his voice and manner were very impressive–more like those\nof a grown man than of a fifteen-year-old boy.",
        "Caleb simply grunted and went on smoking, so Sam continued, “I want to\nhear your story, then Ma an’ me’ll soon fix Da.”",
        "The mention of “Ma” was a happy stroke. Caleb had known her from youth\nas a kind-hearted girl. She was all gentleness and obedience to her\nhusband except in matters of what she considered right and wrong, and\nhere she was immovable. She had always believed in Caleb, even after\nthe row, and had not hesitated to make known her belief.",
        "“There ain’t much to tell,” replied Caleb bitterly. “He done me on\nthat Horse-trade, an’ crowded me on my note so I had to pay it off\nwith oats at sixty cents, then he turned round and sold them within\nhalf an hour for seventy-five cents. We had words right there, an’ I\nbelieve I did say I’d fix him for it. I left Downey’s Dump early that\nday. He had about $300 in his pocket–$300 of my money–the last I had\nin the world. He was too late to bank it, so was taking it home, when\nhe was fired at in going through the ’green bush’. My tobacco pouch\nand some letters addressed to me was found there in the morning.\nCourse he blamed me, but I didn’t have any shootin’-iron then; my\nrevolver, the white one, was stole from me a week before–along with\nthem same letters, I expect. I consider they was put there to lay the\nblame on me, an’ it was a little overdone, most folks would think.\nWell, then your Da set Dick Pogue on me, an’ I lost my farm–that’s\nall.”",
        "Sam smoked gravely for awhile, then continued:",
        "“That’s true about the note an’ the oats an’ the Horse-trade–just\nwhat Da would do; that’s all in the game: but you’re all wrong about\nDick Pogue–that’s too dirty for Da.”",
        "“_You may think so, but I don’t.”",
        "Sam made no answer, but after a minute laid his hand on Turk, who\nresponded with a low growl. This made Caleb continue: “Down on me,\ndown on my Dog. Pogue says he kills Sheep ’an’ every one is ready to\nbelieve it. I never knowed a Hound turn Sheep-killer, an’ I never\nknowed a Sheep-killer kill at home, an’ I never knowed a Sheep-killer\ncontent with one each night, an’ I never knowed a Sheep-killer leave\nno tracks, an’ Sheep was killed again and again when Turk was locked\nup in the shanty with me.”",
        "“Well, whose Dog is it does it?”",
        "“I don’t know as it’s any Dog, for part of the Sheep was eat each\ntime, they say, though I never seen one o’ them that was killed or I\ncould tell. It’s more likely a Fox or a Lynx than a Dog.”",
        "There was a long silence, then outside again the hair-lifting screech\nto which the Dog paid no heed, although the Trapper and the boy were\nevidently startled and scared.",
        "They made up a blazing fire and turned in silently for the night.",
        "The rain came down steadily, and the wind swept by in gusts. It was\nthe Banshee’s hour, and two or three times, as they were dropping off,\nthat fearful, quavering human wail, “like a woman in distress,” came\nfrom the woods to set their hearts a-jumping, not Caleb and Sam only,\nbut all four.",
        "In the diary which Yan kept of those times each day was named after\nits event; there was Deer day, Skunk-and-Cat day, Blue Crane day, and\nthis was noted down as the night of the Banshee’s wailing.",
        "Caleb was up and had breakfast ready before the others were fully\nawake. They had carefully kept and cleaned the Coon meat, and Caleb\nmade of it a “prairie pie,” in which bacon, potatoes, bread, one small\nonion and various scraps of food were made important. This, warmed\nup for breakfast and washed down with coffee, made a royal meal, and\nfeasting they forgot the fears of the night.",
        "The rain was over, but the wind kept on. Great blockish clouds were\ntumbling across the upper sky Yan went out to look for tracks. He\nfound none but those of raindrops.",
        "The day was spent chiefly about camp, making arrows and painting the\nteepee.",
        "Again Caleb was satisfied to sleep in the camp. The Banshee called\nonce that night, and again Turk seemed not to hear, but half an hour\nlater there was a different and much lower sound outside, a light,\nnasal ’wow.” The boys scarcely heard it, but Turk sprang up\nwith bristling hair, growling, and forcing his way out under the door,\nhe ran, loudly barking, into the woods.",
        "“He’s after something now, all right,” said his master; “and now he’s\ntreed it,” as the Dog began his high-pitched yelps.",
        "“Good old Dog; he’s treed the Banshee,” and Yan rushed out into\nthe darkness. The others followed, and they found Turk barking and\nscratching at a big leaning Beech, but could get no hint of what the\ncreature up it might be like.",
        "“How does he usually bark for a Banshee?” asked the Woodpecker, but\ngot no satisfaction, and wondering why Turk should bother himself so\nmightily over a little squeal and never hear that awful scream, they\nretired to camp.",
        "Next morning in the mud not far from the teepee Yan found the track of\na common Cat, and shrewdly guessed that this was the prowler that had\nbeen heard and treed by the Dog; probably it was his old friend of the\nSkunk fight. The wind was still high, and as Yan pored over the tracks\nhe heard for the first time in broad daylight the appalling screech.\nIt certainly was loud, though less dreadful than at night, and\npeering up Yan saw two large limbs that crossed and rubbed each\nother, when the right puff of wind came. This was the Banshee that\ndid the wailing that had scared them all–all but the Dog. His\nkeener senses, unspoiled by superstition, had rightly judged the awful\nsound as the harmless scraping of two limbs in the high wind, but the\nlower, softer noise made by the prowling Cat he had just as truly\nplaced and keenly followed up.",
        "Guy was the only one not convinced. He clung to his theory of Bears.",
        "Late in the night the two Chiefs were awakened by Guy. “Say, Sam–Sam.\nYan–Yan–Yan–Yan, get up; that big Bear is ’round again. I told you\nthere was a Bear, an’ you wouldn’t believe me.”",
        "There was a loud champing sound outside, and occasionally growls or\ngrumbling.",
        "“There’s surely something there, Sam. I wish Turk and Caleb were here\nnow.”",
        "The boys opened the door a little and peered out. There, looming up in\nthe dim starlight, was a huge black animal, picking up scraps of meat\nand digging up the tins that were buried in the garbage hole. All\ndoubts were dispelled. Guy had another triumph, and he would have\nexpressed his feelings to the full but for fear of the monster\noutside.",
        "“What had we better do?”",
        "“Better not shoot him with arrows. That’ll only rile him. Guy, you\nblow up the coals and get a blaze.”",
        "All was intense excitement now, “Oh, why haven’t we got a gun!”",
        "“Say, Sam, while Sap–I mean Hawkeye–makes a blaze, let’s you and me\nshoot with blunt arrows, if the Bear comes toward the teepee.” So they\narranged themselves, Guy puttering in terror at the fire and begging\nthem not to shoot.",
        "“What’s the good o’ riling him? It–it–it’s croo-oo-el.”",
        "Sam and Yan stood with bows ready and arrows nocked.",
        "Guy was making a failure of the fire, and the Bear began nosing\nnearer, champing his teeth and grunting. Now the boys could see the\ngreat ears as the monster threw up its head.",
        "“Let’s shoot before he gets any nearer.” At this Guy promptly\nabandoned further attempts to make a fire and scrambled up on a cross\nstick that was high in the teepee for hanging the pot. He broke out\ninto tears when he saw Sam and Yan actually drawing their bows.",
        "“He’ll come in and eat us, he will.”",
        "But the Bear was coming anyway, and having the two tomahawks ready,\nthe boys let fly. At once the Bear wheeled and ran off, uttering the\nloud, unmistakable squeal of an old Pig–Burns’s own Pig–for young\nBurns had again forgotten to put up the bars that crossed his trail\nfrom the homestead to the camp.",
        "Guy came down quickly to join in the laugh. “I tole you fellers not to\nshoot. I just believed it was our old Hog, an’ I couldn’t help crying\nwhen I thought how mad Paw’d be when he found out.”",
        "“I s’pose you got up on that cross pole to see if Paw was coming,\ndidn’t you?”",
        "“No; he got up there to show how brave he was.”",
        "This was the huge night prowler that Guy had seen, and in the morning\none more mystery was explained, for careful examination of Yan’s diary\nof the big Buck’s track showed that it was nothing more than the track\nof Burns’s old Hog. Why had Caleb and Raften both been mistaken?\nFirst, because it was a long time since they had seen a Buck track,\nand second, because this Pig happened to have a very unpiggy foot–one\nas much like that of a Buck as of a Hog.",

        "“That’s Hawkeye with a big story of bravery; let’s hide.”",
        "So Sam and Yan scrambled quickly into the teepee, hid behind the\nlining and watched through an “arrow hole.” Guy came proudly stepping,\nchin in air, uttering his war-whoop at intervals as he drew near, and\ncarrying his coat bundled up under one arm.",
        "“_Coup! Grand coup! Wa wa wa wa!_” he yelled again and again, but\nlooked simple and foolish when he found the camp apparently deserted.",
        "So he ceased his yells and, walking deliberately into the teepee,\npulled out the sugar box and was stuffing a handful into his mouth\nwhen the other two Chiefs let off their wildest howls and, leaping\nfrom their concealment, chased him into the woods–not far, for Yan\nlaughed too much, and Sam had on but one boot.",
        "This was their re-gathering after a new search for adventures. Early\nin the morning, as he wiped off the breakfast knives by sticking them\ninto the sod, the Second War Chief had suggested: “Say, boys, in old\ndays Warriors would sometimes set out in different directions in\nsearch of adventure, then agree to meet at a given time. Let’s do that\nto-day and see what we run across.”",
        "“Get your straws,” was Woodpecker’s reply, as he returned from putting\nthe scraps on the Wakan Rock.",
        "“No you don’t,” put in Hawkeye hastily; “at least, not unless you let\nme hold the straws. I know you’ll fix it so I’ll have to go home.”",
        "“All right. You can hold the three straws; long one is\nWoodpecker–that’s his head with a bit of red flannel to prevent\nmistakes; the middle-sized thin one is me; and the short fat one is\nyou. Now let them drop. Sudden death and no try over.”",
        "The straws fell, and the two boys gave a yell as Hawkeye’s fate\npointed straight to the Burns homestead.",
        "“Oh, get out; that’s no good. We’ll take the other end,” he said\nangrily, and persisted in going the opposite way.",
        "“Now we all got to go straight till we find something, and meet here\nagain when that streak of sunlight gets around in the teepee to that\npole.”",
        "As the sunstreak, which was their Indian clock, travelled just about\none pole for two hours, this gave about four hours for adventures.",

I’m not scared\nof the front trail,” and he turned his little slit eyes sadly on Guy,\n\"and I kep’ right on, and when I came to the dry bed of the creek it\ndidn’t turn me; no, not a dozen rods; and I kept right till I\ncame to a Wasp’s nest, and I turned and went round that coz it’s\ncruel to go blundering into a nest of a lot of poor innocent little\nWasps–and I kep’ on, till I heard a low growl, and I looked up and\ndidn’t see a thing. Then the growling got louder, and I seen it was a\nhungry Chipmunk roaring at me and jest getting ready to spring. Then\nwhen I got out my bonearrer he says to me, he says, as bold as brass\n’Is your name Woodpecker?’ Now that scared me, and so I told a lie–my\nvery first. I says, says I. ’No,’ says I. ’I’m Hawkeye.’ Well, you\nshould ’a seen him. He just turned pale; every stripe on his back\nfaded when I said that name, and he made for a hollow log and\ngot in. Now I was mad, and tried to get him out, but when I’d run to\none end he’d run to the other, so we ran up and down till I had a\ndeep-worn trail alongside the log, an’ he had a deep-worn trail inside\nthe log, an’ I was figgerin’ to have him wear it right through at the\nbottom so the log’d open, but all of a sudden I says, ’I know what to\ndo for you.’ I took off my boot and stuffs the leg into one end of the\nlog. Then I rattles a stick at the other end and I heard him run into\nthe boot. Then I squeezes in the leg and ties a string around it an’\nbrings him home, me wearing one boot and the Chipmunk the other, and\nthere he is in it now,” and Sam curled up his free bunch of toes in\ngraphic comment and added: “Humph! I s’pose you fellers thought I\ndidn’t know what I was about when I drawed on my long boots this\nmorning.”",
        "“Well, I just want to see that Chipmunk an’ maybe I’ll believe you.”",
        "“In there hunting for a loose patch,” and Sam held up the boot.",
        "“Let’s turn him out,” suggested the Second Chief.",
        "So the string was cut and the Chipmunk scrambled out and away to a\nsafer refuge.",

        "“Oh, shucks! That’s no adventure. Why, I–”",
        "“Hold on, Hawkeye; Little Beaver next.”",
        "“Well, I don’t care. I bet I–”",
        "Sam grabbed his knife and interrupted: “Do you know what Callahan’s\nspring lamb did when it saw the old man gathering mint? Go ahead,\nLittle Beaver.”",
        "“I hadn’t much of an adventure, but I went straight through the woods\nwhere my straw pointed and ran into a big dead stub. It was too old\nand rotten for Birds to use now, as well as too late in the season, so\nI got a pole and pushed it over, and I found the whole history of a\ntenement in that stub. First of all, a Flicker had come years ago\nand dug put a fine big nesting-place, and used it maybe two or three\ntimes. When he was through, or maybe between seasons, the Chickadees\nmade a winter den of it, for there were some Chickadee tail-feathers\nin the bottom. Next a Purple Blackbird came and used the hole, piling\nup a lot of roots with mud on them. Next year it seems it came again\nand made another nest on top of the last; then that winter the\nChickadees again used it for a cubby-hole, for there were some more\nChickadee feathers. Next year a Blue Jay found it out and nested\nthere. I found some of her egg-shells among the soft stuff of the\nnest. Then I suppose a year after a pair of Sparrow-hawks happened on\nthe place, found it suited them, and made their nest in it and hatched\na brood of little Sparrow-hawks. Well, one day this bold robber\nbrought home to his little ones a Shrew.”",
        "“What’s that?”",
        "“Oh, a little thing like a Mouse, only it isn’t a Mouse at all; it is\nsecond cousin to a Mole.”",
        "“I allus thought a Mole was a Mouse specie,” remarked Hawkeye,\nnot satisfied with Yan’s distinction.",
        "“Oh, you!” interrupted Sam. “You’ll try to make out the Burnses is\nsome kin to the Raftens next.”",
        "“I bet I won’t!” and for once Guy got even.",
        "“Well,” Yan continued, “it so happened–about the first time in about\na million years–the little Hawks were not hungry just then. The Shrew\nwasn’t gobbled up at once, and though wounded, it set to work to\nescape as soon as it was free of the old one’s claws. First it hid\nunder the little ones, then it began to burrow down through the\nfeather-bed of the Sparrow-hawk’s nest, then through the Blue Jay’s\nnest, then through the soft stuff of the Blackbird’s nest and among\nthe old truck left by the Chickadees till it struck the hard mud\nfloor of the Blackbird’s nest, and through that it could not dig. Its\nstrength gave out now, and it died there and lay hidden in the lowest\nnest of the house, till years after I came by and broke open the old\nstub and made it tell me a sad and mournful story–that–maybe–never\nhappened at all. But there’s the drawing I made of it at the place,\nshowing all the nests just as I found them, and there’s the dried up\nbody of the little Shrew.”",
        "Sam listened with intense interest, but Guy was at no pains to conceal\nhis contempt. “Oh, pshaw! That’s no adventure–just a whole lot of\n’s’posens’ without a blame thing doing. Now I’ll tell you what I done.\nI–”",
        "“Now, Hawkeye,” Sam put in, “please don’t be rough about it. Leave out\nthe awful things: I ain’t well to-day. You keep back the scary parts\ntill to-morrow.”",
        "“I tell you I left here and went straight as a die, an’ I seen a\nWoodchuck, but he wasn’t in line, so I says: ’No, some other day. I\nkin get you easy any time.’ Then I seen a Hawk going off with\na Chicken, but that was off my beat, an’ I found lots o’ old stumps\nan’ hundreds o’ Chipmunks an’ wouldn’t be bothered with them. Then I\ncome to a farmhouse an’–an’ I went around that so’s not to scare the\nDog, an’ I went pretty near as far as Downey’s Dump–yes, a little\na-past it–only to one side–when up jumps a Partridge as big as a\nTurkey, an’ a hull gang of young ones–about thirty or forty. I bet I\nseen them forty rod away, an’ they all flew, but one that lighted on\na tree as far as–oh, ’cross that field, anyway. I bet you fellers\nwouldn’t ’a’ seen it at all. Well, I jest hauled off as ca’m as ca’m\nan’ let him have it. I aimed straight for his eye–an’ that’s where I\nhit him. Now who gets a grand coup, for there he is!” Hawkeye\nunrolled his coat and turned out a bobtailed young Robin in the\nspeckled plumage, shot through the body.",
        "“So that’s your Partridge. I call that a young Robin,” said the First\nChief with slow emphasis. “Rules is broke. Killed a Song-bird. Little\nBeaver, arrest the criminal.”",
        "But Hawkeye struggled with all the ferocity born of his recent\nexploit, and had to be bound hand and foot while a full Council was\ncalled to try the case. The angry protests weakened when he found how\nserious the Councillors were. Finally he pleaded “guilty” and was\ncondemned to wear a black feather of disgrace and a white feather for\ncowardice for three days, as well as wash the dishes for a week. They\nwould also have made him cook for that term, but that they had had\nsome unhappy experiences with some dishes of Guy’s make.",

        "Broad-shouldered, beetle-browed, brutal and lazy was Bill Hennard, son\nof a prosperous settler. He had inherited a fine farm, but he was\nas lazy as he was strong, and had soon run through his property and\nfollowed the usual course from laziness to crime. Bill had seen the\ninside of more than one jail. He was widely known in the adjoining\ntownship of Emolan; many petty thefts were traced to him, and it was\nopenly stated that but for the help of a rich and clever confederate\nhe would certainly be in the penitentiary. It was darkly hinted,\nfurther, that this confederate was a well-to-do Sangerite who had many\nfarms and a wife and son and a little daughter, and his first name was\nWilliam, and his second name Ra–– “But never mind; and don’t for the\nworld say I told you.” Oh, it’s easy to get rich–if you know how. Of\ncourse, these rumours never reached the parties chiefly concerned.",
        "Hennard had left Downey’s Dump the evening before, and avoiding the\nroads, had struck through the woods, to visit his partner, with\nimportant matters to arrange–very important for Hennard. He was much\nfuddled when he left Downey’s, the night was cloudy, and consequently\nhe had wandered round and round till he was completely lost. He slept\nunder a tree (a cold, miserable sleep it was), and in the sunless\nmorning he set out with little certainty to find his “pal.” After\nsome time he stumbled on the trail that led him to the boys’ camp. He\nwas now savage with hunger and annoyance, and reckless with bottle\nassistance, for he carried a flask. No longer avoiding being seen, he\nwalked up to the teepee just as Little Beaver was frying meat for the\nnoonday meal he expected to eat alone. At the sound of footsteps Yan\nturned, supposing that one of his companions had come back, but there\ninstead was a big, rough-looking tramp.",

        "“Well, sonny, cookin’ dinner? I’ll be glad to j’ine ye,” he said with\nan unpleasant and fawning smile.",

        "“That’s my bow!” replied Yan, in fear and indignation.",
        "“I won’t tell ye a second time–hand me that stick, or I’ll\nspifflicate ye.”",
        "Yan stood still. The desperado strode forward, seized the bow, and\ngave him two or three blows on the back and legs.",

        "Yan now realized that he had fallen into the power of the worst enemy\nof the harmless camper, and saw too late the folly of neglecting\nRaften’s advice to have a big Dog in camp. He glanced around and would\nhave run, but the tramp was too quick for him and grabbed him by the\ncollar. “Oh, no you don’t; hold on, sonny. I’ll fix you so you’ll do\nas you’re told.” He cut the bowstring from its place, and violently\nthrowing Yan down, he tied his feet so that they had about eighteen\ninches’ play.",
        "“Now rush around and get my dinner; I’m hungry. An’ don’t you spile it\nin the cooking or I’ll use the gad on you; an’ if you holler or cut\nthat cord I’ll kill ye. See that?” and he got out an ugly-looking\nknife.",
        "Tears of fear and pain ran down Yan’s face as he limped about to obey\nthe brute’s orders.",
        "“Here, you move a little faster!” and the tramp turned from poking the\nfire with the bow to give another sounding blow. If he had looked down\nthe trail he would have seen a small tow-topped figure that turned and\nscurried away at the sound.",
        "Yan was trained to bear punishment, but the tyrant seemed careless of\neven his life.",
        "“Are you going to kill me?” he burst out, after another attack for\nstumbling in his shackles.",
        "“Don’t know but I will when I’ve got through with ye,” replied the\ndesperado with brutal coolness. “I’ll take some more o’ that meat–an’\ndon’t you let it burn, neither. Where’s the sugar for the coffee? I’ll\nget a bigger club if ye don’t look spry,” and so the tramp was served\nwith his meal. “Now bring me some tobaccer.”",
        "Yan hobbled into the teepee and reached down Sam’s tobacco bag.",

        "“I can’t. It’s locked, and Sam has the key.”",
        "“He has, has he? Well, I have a key that will open it,” and so he\nsmashed the lid with the axe; then he went through the pockets, got\nYan’s old silver watch and chain, and in Sam’s trousers pocket he got\ntwo dollars.",
        "“Ha! That’s just what I want, sonny,” and the tramp put them in his\nown pockets. “’Pears to me the fire needs a little wood,” he remarked,\nas his eye fell on Yan’s quiverful of arrows, and he gave that a kick\nthat sent many of them into the blaze.",
        "“Now, sonny, don’t look at me quite so hard, like you was taking\nnotes, or I may have to cut your throat and put you in the swamp hole\nto keep ye from telling tales.”",
        "Yan was truly in terror of his life now.",
        "“Bring me the whetstone,” the tyrant growled, “an’ some more coffee.\"\nYan did so. The tramp began whetting his long knife, and Yan saw\ntwo things that stuck in his memory: first, the knife, which was of\nhunting pattern, had a brass Deer on the handle; second, the hand that\ngrasped it had only three fingers.",
        "“What’s that other box in there?”",
        "“That’s–that’s–only our food box.”",

        "The boy was badly bruised, but saw his only chance. The big knife was\nthere. He seized it, cut the cord on his legs, flung the knife afar\nin the swamp and ran like a Deer. The tramp rushed out of the teepee\nyelling and cursing. Yan might have gotten away had he been in good\nshape, but the tramp’s cruelty really had crippled him, and the brute\nwas rapidly overtaking him. As he sped down the handiest, the south\ntrail, he sighted in the trees ahead a familiar figure, and yelling\nwith all his remaining strength, “Caleb! Caleb!! Caleb Clark!!!” he\nfell swooning in the grass.",
        "There is no mistaking the voice of dire distress. Caleb hurried up,\nand with one impulse he and the tramp grappled in deadly struggle.\nTurk was not with his master, and the tramp had lost his knife, so it\nwas a hand-to-hand conflict. A few clinches, a few heavy blows, and\nit was easy to see who must win. Caleb was old and slight. The tramp,\nstrong, heavy-built, and just drunk enough to be dangerous, was too\nmuch for him, and after a couple of rounds the Trapper fell writhing\nwith a foul blow. The tramp felt again for his knife, swore savagely,\nlooked around for a club, found only a big stone, and would have done\nno one knows what, when there was a yell from behind, another big man\ncrashed down the trail, and the tramp faced William Raften, puffing\nand panting, with Guy close behind. The stone meant for Caleb he\nhurled at William, who dodged it, and now there was an even fight. Had\nthe tramp had his knife it might have gone hard with Raften, but fist\nto fist the farmer had the odds. His old-time science turned the\nday, and the desperado went down with a crusher “straight from the\nshoulder.”",

        "Yan told his story and Guy supplied an important chapter. He had\nreturned earlier than expected, and was near to camp, when he heard\nthe tramp beating Yan. His first impulse to run home to his puny\nfather was replaced with the wiser one to go for brawny Mr. Raften.",

The tramp was forced to go ahead; Guy followed,\njerking the rope and playing Horse, shouting, “Ch’–ch’–ch’–get\nup, Horsey,” while William helped old Caleb with a gentleness that\nrecalled a time long ago when Caleb had so helped him after a falling\ntree had nearly killed him in the woods.",
        "At camp they found Sam. He was greatly astonished at the procession,\nfor he knew nothing of the day’s events, and fearfully disappointed he\nwas on learning what he had missed.",
        "Caleb still looked white and sick when they got him to the fire, and\nRaften said, “Sam, go home and get your mother to give you a little\nbrandy.”",
        "“You don’t need to go so far,” said Yan, “for that fellow has a bottle\nin his pocket.”",
        "“I wouldn’t touch a dhrap of annything he has, let alone give it to a\nsick friend,” was William’s reply.",
        "So Sam went for the brandy and was back with it in half an hour.",
        "“Here now, Caleb,” said William, “drink that now an’ ye’ll feel\nbetter,” and as he offered the cup he felt a little reviving glow of\nsympathy for his former comrade.",
        "When Sam went home that morning it was with a very clear purpose.\nHe had gone straight to his mother and told all he knew about the\nrevolver and the misunderstanding with Caleb, and they two had had a\nlong, unsatisfactory interview with the father. Raften was brutal and\noutspoken as usual. Mrs. Raften was calm and clear-witted. Sam was\nshrewd. The result was a complete defeat for William–a defeat that he\nwould not acknowledge; and Sam came back to camp disappointed for the\ntime being, but now to witness the very thing he had been striving\nfor–his father and the Trapper reconciled; deadly enemies two hours\nago, but now made friends through a fight. Though overpowered in\nargument, Raften’s rancour was not abated, but rather increased toward\nthe man he had evidently misused, until the balance was turned by the\nchance of his helping that man in a time of direst straits.",
        "WINNING BACK THE FARM",
        "Oh, the magic of the campfire! No unkind feeling long withstands its\nglow. For men to meet at the same campfire is to come closer, to have\nbetter understanding of each other, and to lay the foundations of\nlasting friendship. “He and I camped together once!” is enough to\nexplain all cordiality between the men most wide apart, and Woodcraft\ndays are days of memories happy, bright and lifelong.",
        "To sit at the same camp fireside has always been a sacred bond, and\nthe scene of twenty years before was now renewed in the Raften woods,\nthanks to that campfire lit a month before–the sacred fire. How well\nit had been named! William and Caleb were camped together in good\nfellowship again, marred though it was with awkwardness as yet, but\nstill good fellowship.",
        "Raften was a magistrate. He sent Sam with an order to the constable\nto come for the prisoner. Yan went to the house for provisions and to\nbring Mrs. Raften, and Guy went home with an astonishing account of\nhis latest glorious doings. The tramp desperado was securely fastened\nto a tree; Caleb was in the teepee lying down. Raften went in for a\nfew minutes, and when he came out the tramp was gone. His bonds were\ncut, not slipped. How could he nave gotten away without help?",
        "“Never mind,” said Raften. “That three-fingered hand is aisy to\nfollow. Caleb, ain’t that Bill Hennard?”",
        "“I reckon.”",
        "The men had a long talk. Caleb told of the loss of his revolver–he\nwas still living in the house with the Pogues then–and of its\nrecovery. They both remembered that Hennard was close by at the time\nof the quarrel over the Horse-trade. There was much that explained\nitself and much of mystery that remained.",
        "But one thing was clear. Caleb had been tricked out of everything he\nhad in the world, for it was just a question of days now before Pogue\nwould, in spite of Saryann, throw off all pretense and order Caleb\nfrom the place to shift for himself.",
        "Raften sat a long time thinking, then said:",
        "“Caleb, you do exactly as Oi tell ye and ye’ll get yer farrum back.\nFirst, Oi’ll lend ye wan thousand dollars for wan week.”",
        "A thousand dollars!!! Caleb’s eyes opened, and what was next he\ndid not then learn, for the boys came back and interrupted, but later\nthe old Trapper was fully instructed.",
        "When Mrs. Raften heard of it she was thunderstruck. A thousand dollars\nin Sanger was like one hundred thousand dollars in a big city. It was\nuntold wealth, and Mrs. Raften fairly gasped.",
        "“A thousand dollars, William! Why! isn’t that a heavy strain to put on\nthe honesty of a man who thinks still that he has some claim on you?\nIs it safe to risk it?”",
        "“Pooh!” said William. “Oi’m no money-lender, nor spring gosling\nnayther. Thayer’s the money Oi’ll lend him,” and Raften produced a\nroll of counterfeit bills that he as magistrate had happened to have\nin temporary custody. “Thayer’s maybe five hundred or six hundred\ndollars, but it’s near enough.”",
        "Caleb, however, was allowed to think it real money, and fully\nprepared, he called at his own–the Pogue house–the next day,\nknocked, and walked in.",
        "“Good morning, father,” said Saryann, for she had some decency and\nkindness.",
        "“What do you want here?” said Dick savagely; “bad enough to have you\non the place, without forcing yerself on us day and night.”",
        "“Hush now, Dick; you forget–”",
        "“Forget–I don’t forget nothin’,” retorted Dick, interrupting his\nwife. “He had to help with the chores an’ work, an’ he don’t do a\nthing and expects to live on me.”",
        "“Oh, well, you won’t have me long to bother you,” said Caleb sadly,\nas he tottered to a chair. His face was white and he looked sick and\nshaky.",
        "“What’s the matter, father?”",
        "“Oh, I’m pretty bad. I won’t last much longer You’ll be quit o’ me\nbefore many days.”",
        "“Big loss!” grumbled Dick.",
        "“I–I give you my farm an’ everything I had–”",
        "“Oh, shut up. I’m sick of hearing about it.”",
        "“At least–’most–everything. I–I–I–didn’t say nothing about a\nlittle wad o’–o’–bills I had stored away. I–I–” and the old man\ntrembled violently–\"I’m so cold.”",
        "“Dick, do make a fire,” said his wife.",
        "“I won’t do no sich fool trick. It’s roastin’ hot now.”",
        "“’Tain’t much,” went on the trembling old man, “only fif–fif–teen\nhundred–dollars. I got it here now,” and he drew out the roll of\ngreenbacks.",
        "FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS! Twice as much as the whole farm and\nstock were worth! Dick’s eyes fairly popped out, and Caleb was careful\nto show also the handle of the white revolver.",
        "“Why, father,” exclaimed Saryann, “you are ill: Let me go get you some\nbrandy. Dick, make a fire. Father is cold as ice.”",
        "“Yes–please–fire–I’m all of–a–tremble–with–cold.”",
        "Dick rushed around now and soon the big fire place was filled with\nblaze and the room unpleasantly warm.",
        "“Here, father, have some brandy and water,” said Dick, in a very\ndifferent tone. “Would you like a little quinine?”",
        "“No, no–I’m better now; but I was saying–I only got a few days to\nlive, an’ having no legal kin–this here wad’d go to the gover’ment,\nbut I spoke to the lawyer, an’ all I need do–is–add–a word to the\ndeed o’ gift–for the farm–to include this–an’ it’s very right you\nshould have it, too.” Old Caleb shook from head to foot and coughed\nterribly.",
        "“Oh, father, let me send for the doctor,” pleaded Saryann, and Dick\nadded feebly, “Yes, father, let me go for the doctor.”",
        "“No, no; never mind. It don’t matter. I’ll be better off soon. Have\nyou the deed o’ gift here?”",
        "“Oh, yes, Dick has it in his chest.” Dick ran to get the deed, for\nthese were the days before registration in Canada; possession of the\ndeed was possession of the farm, and to lose the deed was to lose the\nland.",
        "The old man tremblingly fumbled over the money, seeming to count\nit–\"Yes–just–fif-teen hun’erd,” as Dick came clumping down the\nladder with the deed.",
        "“Have you got a–pen–and ink–”",
        "Dick went for the dried-up ink bottle while Saryann hunted for\nthe pen. Caleb’s hand trembled violently as he took the\nparchment, glanced carefully over it–yes, this was it–the thing that\nhad made him a despised pauper. He glanced around quickly. Dick and\nSaryann were at the other end of the room. He rose, took one step\nforward and stuffed the deed into the blazing fire. Holding his\nrevolver in his right hand and the poker in the left, he stood erect\nand firm, all sign of weakness gone; his eyes were ablaze, and with\nvoice of stern command he hissed ’Stand back!_” And pointed the\npistol as he saw Dick rushing to rescue the deed. In a few seconds it\nwas wholly consumed, and with that, as all knew, the last claim of the\nPogues on the property, for Caleb’s own possessory was safe in a vault\nat Downey’s.",
        "“Now,” thundered Caleb, “you dirty paupers, get out of my house! Get\noff my land, and don’t you dare touch a thing belonging to me.”",
        "He raised his voice in a long “halloo” and rapped three times on the\ntable. Steps were heard outside. Then in came Raften with two men.",
        "“Magistrate Raften, clear my house of them interlopers, if ye please.”",
        "Caleb gave them a few minutes to gather up their own clothes, then\nthey set out on foot for Downey’s, wild with helpless rage, penniless\nwanderers in the world, as they had meant to leave old Caleb.",
        "Now he was in possession of his own again, once more comfortably\n\"fixed.” After the men had had their rough congratulations and\nuproarious laughter over the success of the trick, Raften led up to\nthe question of money, then left a blank, wondering what Caleb would\ndo. The good old soul pulled out the wad.",
        "“There it is, Bill. I hain’t even counted it, and a thousand times\nobliged. If ever you need a friend, call on me.”",
        "Raften chuckled, counted the greenbacks and said “All right!” and to\nthis day Caleb doesn’t know that the fortune he held in his hand that\nday was nothing but a lot of worthless paper.",
        "A week later, as the old Trapper sat alone getting his evening meal,\nthere was a light rap at the door.",
        "“Come in.”",
        "A woman entered. Turk had sprung up growling, but now wagged his tail,\nand when she lifted a veil Caleb recognized Saryann.",
        "“What do you want?” he demanded savagely.",
        "“’Twasn’t my doing, father; you know it wasn’t; and now he’s left me\nfor good.” She told him her sorrowful story briefly. Dick had not\ncourted Saryann, but the farm, and now that that was gone he had no\nfurther use for her. He had been leading a bad life, “far worse than\nany one knew,” and now he had plainly told her he was done with her.",
        "Caleb’s hot anger never lasted more than five minutes. He must have\nfelt that her story was true, for the order of former days was\nreestablished, and with Saryann for housekeeper the old man had a\ncomfortable home to the end of his days.",
        "Pogue disappeared; folks say he went to the States. The three-fingered\ntramp never turned up again, and about this time the serious robberies\nin the region ceased. Three years afterward they learned that two\nburglars had been shot while escaping from an American penitentiary.\nOne of them was undoubtedly Dick Pogue, and the other was described as\na big dark man with three fingers on the right hand.",
        "THE RIVAL TRIBE",
        "The winning back of the farm, according to Sanger custom must be\ncelebrated in a “sociable” that took the particular form of a grand\nhouse-warming, in which the Raftens, Burnses and Boyles were fully\nrepresented, as Char-less was Caleb’s fast friend. The Injun band\nwas very prominent, for Caleb saw that it was entirely owing to the\nmeetings at the camp that the glad event had come about.",
        "Caleb acted as go-between for Char-less Boyle and William Raften,\nand their feud was forgotten–for the time at least–as they related\nstories of their early hunting days, to the delight of Yan and the\nTribe. There were four other boys there whom Little Beaver met for the\nfirst time. They were Wesley Boyle, a dark-skinned, low-browed, active\nboy of Sam’s age; his brother Peter, about twelve, fair, fat and\nfreckled, and with a marvellous squint; and their cousin Char-less\nBoyle, Jr., good-natured, giggly, and of spongy character; also Cyrus\nDigby, a smart city boy, who was visiting “the folks,” and who usually\nappeared in white cuffs and very high stand-up collar. These boys were\ngreatly interested in the Sanger Indian camp, and one outcome of the\nmeeting at Caleb’s was the formation of another Tribe of Indians,\ncomposed of the three Boyle boys and their town friend.",
        "Since most of these were Boyles and the hunting-ground was the Boyles\nwoods about that marshy pond, and especially because they had read of\na band of Indians named Boilers or Stoneboilers (Assineboines), they\ncalled themselves the “Boilers.” Wesley was the natural leader. He was\nalert as well as strong, and eager to do things, so made a fine Chief.\nHis hooked nose and black hair and eyes won for him the appropriate\nname of “Blackhawk.” The city boy being a noisy “show-off,” who did\nlittle work, was called “Bluejay” Peter Boyle was “Peetweet,” and\nChar-less, from his peculiar snickering and showing two large front\nteeth, was called “Red-squirrel.”",
        "They made their camp as much as possible like that of the Sangers, and\nadopted their customs; but a deadly rivalry sprang up between them\nfrom the first. The Sangers felt that they were old and experienced\nWoodcrafters. The Boilers thought they knew as much and more, and they\noutnumbered the Sangers. Active rivalry led to open hostilities. There\nwas a general battle with fists and mud; that proved a draw. Then a\nduel between leaders was arranged, and Blackhawk won the fight and\nthe Woodpecker’s scalp. The Boilers were wild with enthusiasm. They\nproposed to take the whole Sanger camp, but in a hand-to-hand fight\nof both tribes it was another draw. Guy, however, scored a glorious\ntriumph over Char-less and secured his scalp at the moment of victory.",
        "Now Little Beaver sent a challenge to Blackhawk. It was scornfully\naccepted. Again the Boiler Chief was victor and won another scalp,\nwhile Little Beaver got a black eye and a bad licking, but the enemy\nretired.",
        "Yan had always been considered a timid boy at Bonnerton, but that was\nlargely the result of his repressive home training. Sanger was working\ngreat changes. To be treated with respect by the head of the house was\na new and delightful experience. It developed his self-respect. His\nwood life was making him wonderfully self-reliant, and improved health\nhelped his courage, so next day, when the enemy appeared in full\nforce, every one was surprised when Yan again challenged Blackhawk. It\nreally cost him a desperate and mighty effort to do so, for it is one\nthing to challenge a boy that you think you can “lick” and another to\nchallenge one the very day after he has licked you. Indeed, if the\ntruth were known, Yan did it in fear and trembling, and therein lay\nthe courage–in going ahead when fear said “Go back.”",
        "It is quite certain that a year before he would not have ventured in\nsuch a fight, and he only did it now because he had realized that\nBlackhawk was left-handed, and a plan to turn this to account had\nsuggested itself. Every one was much surprised at the challenge,\nbut much more so when, to the joy of his tribe, Little Beaver won a\nbrilliant victory.",
        "Inspired by this, they drove the Boilers from the field, scored a\ngrand triumph, and Sam and Yan each captured a scalp.",
        "The Sangers held a Council and scalp-dance in celebration that night\naround an outdoor fire. The Medicine Man was sent for to be in it.",
        "After the dance, Chief Beaver, his face painted to hide his black\neye, made a speech. He claimed that the Boilers would surely look for\nreinforcements and attempt a new attack, and that, therefore, the\nSangers should try to add to their number, too.",
        "“I kin lick Char-less any time,” piped in Guy proudly, and swung the\nscalp he had won.",
        "But the Medicine Man said: “If I were you boys I’d fix up a peace. Now\nyou’ve won you ought to ask them to a big pow-wow.”",
        "These were the events that led to the friendly meeting of the two\nTribes in full war-paint.",
        "Chief Woodpecker first addressed them: “Say, fellers–Brother Chiefs,\nI mean–this yere quar’lin’ don’t pay. We kin have more fun working\ntogether. Let’s be friends an’ join in one Tribe. There’s more fun\nwhen there’s a crowd.”",
        "“All right,” said Blackhawk; “but we’ll call the tribe the ’Boilers,’\ncoz we have the majority, and leave me Head Chief.”",
        "“You are wrong about that. Our Medicine Men makes us even number\nand more than even weight. We’ve got the best camp–have the\nswimming-pond, and we are the oldest Tribe, not to speak of the\nsuccess we had in a certain leetle business not long ago which the\nyoungest of us kin remember,” and Guy grinned in appreciation of this\nevident reference to his exploit.",
        "As a matter of fact, it was the swimming-pond that turned the day. The\nBoilers voted to join the Sangers. Their holiday was only ten days,\nthe Sangers had got a week’s extension, and all knew that they could\nget most out of their time by going to the pond camp. The question of\na name was decided by Little Beaver.",
        "“Boiler Warriors,” said he, “it is the custom of the Indians to have\nthe Tribes divided in clans. We are the Sanger clan. You are the\nBoiler clan. But as we all live in Sanger we are all Sanger Indians.”",
        "“Who’s to be Head Chief?”",
        "Blackhawk had no notion of submitting to Woodpecker, whom he had\nlicked, nor would Woodpecker accept a Chief of the inferior tribe.\nOne suggested that Little Beaver be Chief, but out of loyalty to his\nfriend, the Woodpecker, Yan declined.",
        "“Better leave that for a few days till you get acquainted,” was the\nMedicine Man’s wise suggestion.",
        "That day and the next were spent in camp. The Boilers had their teepee\nto make and beds to prepare. The Sangers merrily helped, making a\n\"bee” of it.",
        "Bow and arrow making were next to do. Little Beaver had not fully\nreplaced his own destroyed by the robber. A hunt of the Burlap Deer\nwas a pleasant variation of the second day, though there were but two\nbows for all, and the Boilers began to realize that they were really\nfar behind the Sangers in knowledge of Woodcraft.",
        "At swimming Blackhawk was easily first. Of course, this greatly\nincreased his general interest in the swimming-pond, and he chiefly\nwas responsible for the making of a canoe later on.",
        "The days went on right merrily–oh, so fast! Little Beaver showed all\nthe things of interest in his kingdom. How happy he was in showing\nthem–playing experienced guide as he used to dream it! Peetweet took\na keen interest; so did the city boy. Char-less took a little interest\nin it all, helped a little, was generally a little in everything, and\ngiggled a good deal. Hawkeye was disposed to bully Char-less, since he\nfound him quite lickable. His tone was high and haughty when he spoke\nto him–not at all like his whining when addressing the others. He\nvolunteered to discipline Char-less if he should ill-treat any of the\nothers, and was about to administer grievous personal punishment for\nsome trifling offense, when Blackhawk gave him a warning that had good\neffect.",
        "Yan’s note-book was fully discussed and his drawings greatly admired.\nHe set to work at once with friendly enthusiasm to paint the Boilers’\nteepee. Not having any adventures that seemed important, except,\nperhaps, Blackhawk’s defeat of Woodpecker and Little Beaver, subjects\nthat did not interest the artist, the outside decorations were the\ntotem of the clan and its members.",
        "White-Man’s Woodcraft",
        "Blackhawk was the introducer of a new game which he called “judging.”",
        "“How far is it from here to that tree?” he would ask, and when each\nhad written down his guess they would measure, and usually it was\nWoodpecker or Blackhawk that came nearest to the truth. Guy still held\nthe leadership “for far sight,” for which reason he suggested that\ngame whenever a change of amusement was wanted.",
        "Yan, following up Blackhawk’s suggestion, brought in the new game of\n\"White-man’s Woodcraft.”",
        "“Can you,” asked he, “tell a Dog’s height by its track?”",
        "“No; nor you nor any one else,” was the somewhat scornful reply.",
        "“Oh, yes, I can. Take the length in inches of his forefoot track,\nmultiply it by 8, and that gives his height at the shoulder. You try\nit and you’ll see. A little Dog has a 2-1/4-inch foot and stands about\n18 inches, a Sheep Dog with a 3-inch track stands 24 inches, and a\nMastiff or any big Dog with a 4-inch track gives 30 to 32 inches.”",
        "“You mean every Dog is 8 feet high?” drawled Sam, doubtfully, but Yan\nwent on. “And you can tell his weight, too, by the track. You multiply\nthe width of his forefoot in inches by the length, and multiply that\nby 5, and that gives pretty near his weight in pounds. I tried old\nCap. His foot is 3-1/2 by 3; that equals 10-1/2, multiplied by 5\nequals 52-1/2 pounds: just about right.”",
        "“I’ll bet I seen a Dog at the show that that wouldn’t work on,\"\ndrawled Sam. “He was as long as my two arms, he had feet as big as a\nyoung Bear, an’ he wasn’t any higher than a brick. He was jest about\nthe build of a Caterpiller, only he didn’t have but four legs at the\nfar ends. They was so far apart he couldn’t keep step. He looked like\nhe was raised under a bureau. I think when they was cutting down so on\nhis legs they might have give him more of them; a row in the middle\nwould ’a’ been ’bout right.”",
        "“Yes, I know him. That’s a Dachshund. But you can’t reckon on freaks;\nnothing but straight Dog. It works on wild animals, too–that is, on\nWolves and Foxes and maybe other things,” then changing the subject\nBeaver continued:",
        "“Can you tell the height of a tree by its shadow?”",
        "“Never thought of that. How do you do it?”",
        "“Wait till your own shadow is the same length as yourself–that is,\nabout eight in the morning or four in the afternoon–then measure the\ntree’s shadow. That gives its length.”",
        "“You’d have to wait all day to work that, and you can’t do it at all\nin the woods or on a dull day,” objected Blackhawk. “I’d rather do it\nby guess.”",
        "“I’ll bet my scalp against yours I can tell the height of that\ntree right now without climbing it, and get closer than you can by\nguessing,” said Little Beaver.",
        "“No, I won’t bet scalps on that–but I’ll bet who’s to wash the\ndishes.”",
        "“All right. To the top of that tree, how much is it?”",
        "“Better not take the top, ’cause we can’t get there to measure it, but\nsay that knot,” was the rejoinder. “Here, Woodpecker, you be judge.”",
        "“No, I want to be in this guessing. The loser takes the next turn of\ndishwashing for each of the others.”",
        "So Blackhawk studied the knot carefully and wrote down his\nguess–Thirty-eight feet.",
        "Sam said, “Blackhawk! Ground’s kind of uneven. I’d like to know the\nexact spot under the tree that you’d measure to. Will you mark it with\na peg?”",
        "So Blackhawk went over and put in a white peg, at the same time\nunwittingly giving Woodpecker what he wanted–a gauge, for he knew\nBlackhawk was something more than five feet high; judging then as he\nstood there Sam wrote down Thirty-five feet.",
        "Now it was Yan’s turn to do it by “White-man’s Woodcraft,” as he\ncalled it. He cut a pole exactly ten feet long, and choosing the\nsmoothest ground, he walked about twenty yards from the tree, propped\nthe pole upright, then lay down so that his eye was level with the\ntree base and in line with the top of the pole and the knot on the\ntree. A peg marked the spot.",
        "Now he measured from this “eye peg” to the foot of the pole; it was 31\nfeet. Then from the eye peg to the peg under the tree; it was 87 feet.\nSince the 10-foot pole met the line at 31 feet, then 31 is to 10 as 87\nis to the tree–or 28 feet. Now one of the boys climbed and measured\nthe height of the knot. It was 29 feet, and Yan had an easy victory.",
        "“Here, you close guessers, do you want another try, and I’ll give you\nodds this time, if you come within ten feet you’ll win. I want only\ntwo feet to come and go on.”",
        "“All right. Pick your trees.”",
        "“’Tisn’t a tree this time, but the distance across that pond, from\nthis peg (H, in diagram) to that little Hemlock (D). You put down your\nguesses and I’ll show you another trick.”",
        "Sam studied it carefully and wrote Forty feet. Wes put down\nForty-five.",
        "“Here, I want to be in this. I’ll show you fellers how,” exclaimed Guy\nin his usual scornful manner, and wrote down Fifty feet.",
        "“Let’s all try it for scalps,” said Char-less, but this was ruled\ntoo unimportant for scalps, and again the penalty of failure was\ndishwashing, so the other boys came and put down their guesses close\nto that of their Chief–Forty-four, Forty-six and Forty-nine feet.",
        "“Now we’ll find out exactly,” and Little Beaver, with an air of calm\nsuperiority, took three straight poles of exactly the same length and\npegged them together in a triangle, leaving the pegs sticking up. He\nplaced this triangle on the bank at A B C, sighting the line\nA B for the little Hemlock D, and put three pegs in the\nground exactly under the three pegs where the triangle was; moved the\ntriangle to E F G and placed it so that F G should line\nwith A C and E G with D. Now A G D also must be an equilateral\ntriangle; therefore, according to arithmetic, the line D H must be\nseven-eighths of A G. A G was easily measured–70 feet. Seven-eighths\nof 70 equals 61-1/4 feet. The width of the pond–they measured it with\ntape line–was found to be 60 feet, so Yan was nearest, but Guy claimed\nthat 50 feet was within 10 feet of it, which was allowed. Thus there\nwere two winners–two who escaped dishwashing; and Hawkeye’s bragging\nbecame insufferable. He never again got so close in a guess, but no\nnumber of failures could daunt him after such a success.",
        "Sam was interested in the White-man’s Woodcraft chiefly on Yan’s\naccount, but Blackhawk was evidently impressed with the study itself,\nand said:",
        "“Little Beaver, I’ll give you one more to do. Can you measure how far\napart those two trees are on that bank, without crossing?”",
        "“Yes,” said Yan; “easily.” So he cut three poles 6, 8 and 10 feet long\nand pegged them together in a triangle (in diagram). “Now,” said he,\n\"_A B C is a right angle; it must be, when the legs of the\ntriangle are 6, 8 and 10; that’s a law.”",
        "He placed this on the shore, the side A B pointing to the inner\nside of the first tree, and the side B C as nearly as possible\nparallel with the line between the two trees. Then he put in a stake\nat B, another at C, and continued this line toward K. Now he\nslid his triangle along this till the side G F pointed to E, and\nthe side H G in line with C B. The distance from D to E, of\ncourse, is equal to B G, which can be measured, and again the tape\nline showed Yan to be nearly right.",
        "This White-man’s Woodcraft was easy for him, and he volunteered to\nteach the other Indians, but they thought it looked “too much like\nschool.” They voted him a coup on finding how well he could do\nit. But when Raften heard of it he exclaimed in wonder and admiration,\n\"My, but that’s mightiful!” and would not be satisfied till the\ncoup was made a grand coup.",
        "“Say, Beaver,” said Woodpecker sadly, harking back, “if a Dog’s front\nfoot is 3-1/2 inches long and 3 inches wide, what colour is the end of\nhis tail?”",
        "“White,” was the prompt reply; “’cause a Dog with feet that size and\nshape is most likely to be a yaller Dog, and a yaller Dog always has\nsome white hairs in the end of his tail.”",
        "“Well, this ’un hadn’t, ’cause his tail was cut off in the days of his\nyouth!”",
        "The Long Swamp",
        "The union of the tribes, however, was far from complete. Blackhawk was\ninclined to be turbulent. He was heavier than Beaver. He could not\nunderstand how that slighter, younger boy could throw him, and he\nwished to try again. Now Yan was growing stronger every day. He was\nquick and of very wiry build. In the first battle, which was entirely\nfisty, he was worsted; on the try-over, which cost him such an effort,\nhe had arranged “a rough-and-tumble,” as they called it, and had\nwon chiefly by working his only trick. But now Blackhawk was not\nsatisfied, and while he did not care to offer another deadly\nchallenge, by way of a feeler he offered, some days after the peace,\nto try a friendly throw for scalps.",
        "“Fists left out!” Just what Beaver wanted, and the biggest boy was\nsent flying. “If any other Boiler would like to try I’d be pleased\nto oblige him,” said Yan, just a little puffed up, as he held up the\nsecond scalp he had won from Blackhawk.",
        "Much to his surprise, Bluejay, the city boy, accepted, and he was\nstill more surprised when the city boy sent him down in the\ndust.",
        "“Best out of three!” shouted Woodpecker quickly, in the interest of\nhis friend, taking advantage of an unwritten law that when it is not\nstated to be in one try, usually called “sudden death,” it is “best\ntwo out of three” that counts.",
        "Yan knew now that he had found a worthy foe. He dodged, waiting for an\nopening–gripped–locked–and had him on the hip, he thought, but the\ncity boy squirmed in time, yielding instead of resisting, and both\nwent down tight-gripped. For a minute it was doubtful.",
        "“Go it, Yan.”",
        "“Give it to him, Bluejay.”",
        "But Yan quickly threw out one leg, got a little purchase, and turned\nthe city boy on his back.",
        "“Hooray for Little Beaver!”",
        "“One try more! So far even!” cried Blackhawk.",
        "They closed again, but Yan was more than ever careful. The city boy\nwas puffing hard. The real trial was over and Cy went down quite\neasily.",
        "“Three cheers for Little Beaver!” A fourth scalp was added to his\ncollection, and Sam patted him on the back, while Bluejay got out a\npocket mirror and comb and put his hair straight.",
        "But this did not help out in the matter of leadership, and when the\nMedicine Man heard of the continued deadlock he said:",
        "“Boys, you know when there is a doubt about who is to lead the only\nway is for all Chiefs to resign and have a new election.” The boys\nacted on this suggestion but found another deadlock. Little Beaver\nrefused to be put up. Woodpecker got three votes, Blackhawk four, and\nGuy one (his own), and the Sangers refused to stand by the decision.",
        "“Let’s wait till after the ’hard trip’–that will show who is the real\nChief–then have a new election,” suggested Little Beaver, with an eye\nto Woodpecker’s interest, for this hard trip was one that had been\npromised them by Caleb–a three-days’ expedition in the Long Swamp.",
        "This swamp was a wild tract, ten miles by thirty, that lay a dozen\nmiles north of Sanger. It was swampy only in parts, but the dry places\nwere mere rocky ridges, like islands in the bogs. The land on these\nwas worthless and the timber had been ruined by fire, so Long Swamp\ncontinued an uninhabited wilderness.",
        "There was said to be a few Deer on the hardwood ridges. Bears and Lynx\nwere occasionally seen, and Wolves had been heard in recent winters.\nOf course there were Foxes, Grouse and Northern Hare. The streams were\nmore or less choked with logs, but were known to harbour a few Beavers\nand an occasional Otter. There were no roads for summer use, only\nlong, dim openings across the bogs, known as winter trails and timber\nroads. This was the region that the boys proposed to visit under\nCaleb’s guidance.",
        "Thus at last they were really going on an “Indian trip\"–to explore\nthe great unknown, with every probability of adventure.",
        "At dawn Yan tapped the tom-tom. It sang a high and vibrant note, in\nguarantee of a sunny day.",
        "They left camp at seven in the morning, and after three hours’ tramp\nthey got to the first part of the wilderness, a great tract of rocky\nland, disfigured with blackened trees and stumps, but green in places\nwith groves of young Poplars or quaking Aspen.",
        "The Indians were very ready to camp now, but the Medicine Man said,\n\"No; better keep on till we find water.” In another mile they reached\nthe first stretch of level Tamarack bog and a welcome halt for lunch\nwas called. “Camp!” shouted the leader, and the Indians ran each to do\nhis part. Sam got wood for the fire and Blackhawk went to seek water,\nand with him was Blue jay, conspicuous in a high linen collar and\nbroad cuffs, for Caleb unfortunately had admitted that he once saw an\nIndian Chief in high hat and stand-up collar.",
        "Beaver was just a little disappointed to see the Medicine Man light\nthe fire with a match. He wanted it all in truly Indian style, but the\nTrapper remarked, “Jest as well to have some tinder and a thong along\nwhen you’re in the woods, but matches is handier than rubbing-sticks.”",
        "Blackhawk and Bluejay returned with two pails of dirty, tepid, swampy\nwater.",
        "“Why, that’s all there is!” was their defense.",
        "“Yan, you go and show them how to get good water,” said Caleb, so\nthe Second Sanger Chief, remembering his training, took the axe and\nquickly made a wooden digger, then went to the edge of the swamp, and\non the land twenty feet from the bog he began to dig a hole in the\nsandy loam. He made it two feet across and sunk it down three feet.\nThe roily water kept oozing in all around, and Bluejay was scornful.\n\"Well, I’d rather have what we got.” Beaver dug on till there was a\nfoot of dirty water in the hole. Then he took a pail and bailed it all\nout as fast as possible, left it to fill, bailed it out a second time,\nand ten minutes later cautiously dipped out with a cup a full pail of\ncrystal-clear cold water, and thus the Boilers learned how to make an\nIndian well and get clear water out of a dirty puddle.",
        "After their simple meal of tea, bread and meat Caleb told his plan.\n\"You never get the same good of a trip if you jest wander off; better\nhave a plan–something to do; and do it without a guide if ye want\nadventures. Now eight is too many to travel together; you’d scare\neverything with racket and never see a livin’ thing. Better divide in\nparties. I’ll stay in camp and get things ready for the night.”",
        "Thus the leaders, Sam and Yan, soon found themselves paired with\nGuy and Peetweet. Wes felt bound to take care of his little cousin\nChar-less.",
        "Bluejay, finding himself the odd man, decided to stay with Caleb,\nespecially as the swamp evidently was without proper footpaths.",
        "“Now,” said Caleb, “northwest of here there is a river called the\nBeaver, that runs into Black River. I want one of you to locate that.\nIt’s thirty or forty feet wide and easy to know, for it’s the only big\nstream in the swamp. Right north there is an open stretch of plain,\nwith a little spring creek, where there’s a band of Injuns camped.\nSomewhere northeast they say there’s a tract of Pine bush not burned\noff, and there is some Deer there. None of the places is ten miles\naway except, maybe, the Injuns’ camp. I want ye to go scoutin’ and\nreport. You kin draw straws to say who goes where.”",
        "So the straws were marked and drawn. Yan drew the timber hunt. He\nwould rather have had the one after the Indians. Sam had to seek the\nriver, and Wesley the Indian camp. Caleb gave each of them a few\nmatches and this parting word:",
        "“I’ll stay here till you come back. I’ll keep up a fire, and toward\nsundown I’ll make a smoke with rotten wood and grass so you kin find\nyour way back. Remember, steer by the sun; keep your main lines of\ntravel; don’t try to remember trees and mudholes; and if you get lost,\nyou make two smokes well apart and stay right there and holler\nevery once in awhile; some one will be sure to come.”",
        "So about eleven o’clock the boys set out eagerly. As they were going\nBlackhawk called to the others, “First to carry out his job wins a\ngrand coup!”",
        "“Let the three leaders stake their scalps,” said the Woodpecker.",
        "“All right. First winner home gets a scalp from each of the others and\nsaves his own.”",
        "“Say, boys, you better take along; your hull outfit, some grub an’\nyour blankets,” was the Medicine Man’s last suggestion. “You may have\nto stay out all night.”",
        "Yan would rather have had Sam along, but that couldn’t be, and\nPeetweet proved a good fellow, though rather slow. They soon left the\nhigh ground and came to the bog–flat and seemingly endless and with a\nfew tall Tamaracks. There were some Cedar-birds catching Flies on\nthe tall tree-tops, and a single Flycatcher was calling out:\n\"_Whoit–whoit–whoit!_” Yan did not know until long after that\nit was the Olive-side. A Sparrow-hawk sailed over, and later a Bald\nEagle with a Sparrow-hawk in hot and noisy pursuit. But the most\ncurious thing was the surface of the bog. The spongy stretch of moss\namong the scattering Tamaracks was dotted with great masses of Pitcher\nPlant, and half concealed by the curious leaves were thousands of\nDroseræ, or fly-eating plants, with their traps set to secure their\nprey.",
        "The bog was wonderful, but very bad walking. The boys sank knee-deep\nin the soft moss, and as they went farther, steering only by the sun,\nthey found the moss sank till their feet reached the water below and\nthey were speedily wet to the knees. Yan cut for each a long pole to\ncarry in the hand; in case the bog gave way this would save them from\nsinking. After two miles of this Peetweet wanted to go back, but was\nscornfully suppressed by Little Beaver.",
        "Shortly afterward they came to a sluggish little stream in the bog\nwith a peculiar red-and-yellow scum along its banks. It was deep and\nsoft-bottomed. Yan tried it with the pole–did not dare to wade, so\nthey walked along its course till they found a small tree lying from\nbank to bank, then crossed on this. Half a mile farther on the bog got\ndryer, and a mass of green ahead marked one of the islands of high\nland. Over this they passed quickly, keeping the northwest course.\nThey now had a succession of small bogs and large islands. The sun was\nhot here and Peetweet was getting tired. He was thirsty, too, and\npersisted in drinking the swamp water whenever he found a hole.",
        "“Say, Peetweet, you’ll suffer for that if you don’t quit; that water\nisn’t fit to drink unless you boil it.”",
        "But Peetweet complained of burning thirst and drank recklessly. After\ntwo hours’ tramp he was very tired and wanted to turn back. Yan sought\na dry island and then gathered sticks for a fire, but found all\nthe matches they had were soaking wet with wading through the bog.\nPeetweet was much upset by this, not on account of fire now, but in\ncase they should be out all night.",
        "“You wait and see what an Indian does,” said Little Beaver. He sought\nfor a dried Balsam Fir, cut the rubbing-sticks, made a bow of a\nslightly bent branch, and soon had a blazing fire, to Peter’s utter\namazement, for he had never seen the trick of making a fire by\nrubbing-sticks.",
        "After drinking some tea and eating a little, Pete felt more\nencouraged.",
        "“We have travelled more than six miles now, I reckon,” said the Chief;\n\"an hour longer and we shall be in sight of the forest if there is\none,” and Yan led off across swamps more or less open and islands of\nburned timber.",
        "Pete began to be appalled by the distance they were putting between\nthem and their friends. “What if we should get lost? They never could\nfind us.”",
        "“We won’t get lost,” said Yan in some impatience; “and if we did, what\nof it? We have only to keep on straight north or south for four or\nfive hours and we reach some kind of a settlement.”",
        "After an hour’s tramp northeast they came to an island with a tall\ntree that had branches right to the ground. Yan climbed up. A vast\nextent of country lay all about him–open flat bogs and timber\nislands, and on far ahead was a long, dark mass of solid\never-green–surely the forest he sought. Between him and it he saw\nwater sparkling.",
        "“Oh, Pete, you ought to be up here,” he shouted joyfully; “it’s worth\nthe climb to see this view.”",
        "“I’d rather see our own back-yard,” grumbled Pete.",
        "Yan came down, his face aglow with pleasure, and exclaimed: “It’s\nclose to, now! I saw the Pine woods. Just off there.”",
        "“How far?”",
        "“Oh, a couple of miles, at most.”",
        "“That’s what you have been saying all along.”",
        "“Well, I saw it this time; and there is water out there. I saw that,\ntoo.”",
        "He tramped on, and in half an hour they came to the water, a deep,\nclear, slow stream, fringed with scrub willows, covered with\nlily-pads, and following the middle of a broad, boggy flat. Yan had\nlooked for a pond, and was puzzled by the stream. Then it struck him.\n\"Caleb said there was only one big stream through this swamp. This\nmust be it. This is Beaver River.”",
        "The stream was barely forty feet across, but it was clearly out of the\nquestion to find a pole for a bridge, so Yan stripped off, put all his\nthings in a bundle, and throwing them over, swam after them. Pete had\nto come now or be left.",
        "As they were dressing on the northern side there was a sudden loud\n\"_Bang–swish!” A torrent of water was thrown in the air, with\nlily-pads broken from their mooring, the water pattered down, the\nwavelets settled, and the boys stood in astonishment to see what\nstrange animal had made this disturbance; but nothing more of it was\nseen, and the mystery remained unsolved.",
        "Then Yan heard a familiar ’Quack!_” down the stream. He took his\nbow and arrow, while Pete sat gloomily on a hummock. As soon as he\npeered through the rushes in a little bay he saw three Mallard close\nat hand. He waited till two were in line, then fired, killing one\ninstantly, and the others flew away. The breeze wafted it within reach\nof a stick, and he seized it and returned in triumph to Pete, but\nfound him ready to cry. “I want to go home!” he said miserably. The\nsight of the Mallard cheered him a little, and Yan said: “Come now,\nPete, don’t spoil everything, there’s a good fellow. Brace up, and if\nI don’t show you the Pine woods in twenty minutes I’ll turn and take\nyou home.”",
        "As soon as they got to the next island they saw the Pine wood–a solid\ngreen bank not half a mile away, and the boys gave a little cheer, and\nfelt, no doubt, as Mungo Park did when first he sighted the Niger. In\nfifteen minutes they were walking in its dry and delightful aisles.",
        "“Now we’ve won,” said Yan, “whatever the others do, and all that\nremains is to get back.”",
        "“I’m awfully tired,” said Pete; “let’s rest awhile.”",
        "Yan looked at his watch. “It’s four o’clock. I think we’d better camp\nfor the night.”",
        "“Oh, no; I want to go home. It looks like rain.”",
        "It certainly did, but Yan replied, “Well, let’s eat first.” He delayed\nas much as possible so as to compel the making of a camp, and the rain\ncame unexpectedly, before he even had a fire. Yet to his own delight\nand Peter’s astonishment he quickly made a rubbing-stick fire, and\nthey hung up their wet clothes about it. Then he dug an Indian well\nand took lots of time in the preparation, so it was six o’clock before\nthey began to eat, and seven when finished–evidently too late to move\nout even though the rain seemed to be over. So Yan collected firewood,\nmade a bed of Fir boughs and a windbreak of bushes and bark. The\nweather was warm, and with the fire and two blankets they passed a\ncomfortable night. They heard their old friend the Horned Owl, a Fox\nbarked his querulous ’Yap-yurr!_” close at hand, and once or\ntwice they were awakened by rustling footsteps in the leaves, but\nslept fairly well.",
        "At dawn Yan was up. He made a fire and heated some water for tea. They\nhad very little bread left, but the Mallard was untouched.",
        "Yan cleaned it, rolled it in wet clay, hid it in the ashes and covered\nit with glowing coals. This is an Indian method of cooking, but Yan\nhad not fully mastered it. In half an hour he opened his clay pie and\nfound the Duck burned on one side and very raw on the other. Part of\nit was good, however, so he called his companion to breakfast. Pete\nsat up white-faced and miserable, evidently a sick boy. Not only had\nhe caught cold, but he was upset by the swamp water he had taken. He\nwas paying the penalty of his indiscretion. He ate a little and drank\nsome tea, then felt better, but clearly was unable to travel that day.\nNow for the first time Yan felt a qualm of fear. Separated by a dozen\nmiles of swamp from all help, what could he do with a sick boy? He\nbarked a small dead tree with a knife, then on the smooth surface\nwrote with a pencil, “Yan Yeoman and Pete Boyle camped here August 10,\n18–”",
        "He made Pete comfortable by the fire, and, looking for tracks, he\nfound that during the night two Deer had come nearly into the camp;\nthen he climbed a high tree and scanned the southern horizon for a\nsmoke sign. He saw none there, but to the northwest, beyond some\nshining yellow hills, he discovered a level plain dotted over with\nblack Fir clumps; from one of these smoke went up, and near it were\ntwo or three white things like teepees.",
        "Yan hurried down to tell Pete the good news, but when he confessed\nthat it was two miles farther from home Pete had no notion of going\nto the Indian camp; so Yan made a smoke fire, and knife-blazing the\nsaplings on two sides as he went, he set out alone for the Indian\ncamp. Getting there in half an hour, he found two log shanties and\nthree teepees. As he came near he had to use a stick to keep off the\nnumerous Dogs. The Indians proved shy, as usual, to White visitors.\nYan made some signs that he had learned from Caleb. Pointing to\nhimself, he held up two fingers–meaning that he was two. Then he\npointed to the Pine woods and made sign of the other lying down, and\nadded the hungry sign by pressing in his stomach with the edges of the\nhands, meaning “I am cut in two here.” The Chief Indian offered him\na Deer-tongue, but did not take further interest. Yan received it\nthankfully, made a hasty sketch of the camp, and returned to find Pete\nmuch better, but thoroughly alarmed at being so long alone. He was\nable and anxious now to go back. Yan led off, carrying all the things\nof the outfit, and his comrade followed slowly and peevishly. When\nthey came to the river, Pete held back in fear, believing that the\nloud noise they had heard was made by some monster of the deep, who\nwould seize them.",
        "Yan was certain it could be only an explosion of swamp gas, and forced\nPete to swim across by setting the example. What the cause really was\nthey never learned.",
        "They travelled very fast now for a time. Pete was helped by the\nknowledge that he was really going home. A hasty lunch of Deer-tongue\ndelayed them but little. At three they sighted Caleb’s smoke signal,\nand at four they burst into camp with yells of triumph.",
        "Caleb fired off his revolver, and Turk bayed his basso profundo\nfull-cry Fox salute. All the others had come back the night before.",
        "Sam said he had “gone ten mile and never got a sight of that blamed\nriver.” Guy swore they had gone forty miles, and didn’t believe there\nwas any such river.",
        "“What kind o’ country did you see?”",
        "“Nothin’ but burned land and rocks.”",
        "“H-m, you went too far west–was runnin’ parallel with Beaver River.”",
        "“Now, Blackhawk, give an account of yourself to Little Beaver,” said\nWoodpecker. “Did you two win out?”",
        "“Well,” replied the Boiler Chief, “if Hawkeye travelled forty miles,\nwe must have gone sixty. We pointed straight north for three hours and\nnever saw a thing but bogs and islands of burned timber–never a sign\nof a plain or of Indians. I don’t believe there are any.”",
        "“Did you see any sandhills?” asked Little Beaver.",
        "“No.”",
        "“Then you didn’t get within miles of it.”",
        "Now he told his own story, backed by Pete, and he was kind enough to\nleave out all about Peetweet’s whimpering. His comrade responded\nto this by giving a glowing account of Yan’s Woodcraft, especially\ndwelling on the feat of the rubbing-stick fire in the rain, and when\nthey finished Caleb said:",
        "“Yan, you won, and you more than won, for you found the green timber\nyou went after, you found the river Sam went after, an’ the Injuns\nWesley went after. Sam and Wesley, hand over your scalps.”",
        "A New Kind of Coon",
        "A merry meal now followed, chaffing and jokes passed several hours\naway, but the boys were rested and restless by nine o’clock and eager\nfor more adventures.",
        "“Aren’t there any Coons ’round here, Mr. Clark?”",
        "“Oh, I reckon so. Y-e-s! Down a piece in the hardwood bush near Widdy\nBiddy Baggs’s place there’s lots o’ likely Cooning ground.”",
        "That was enough to stir them all, for the place was near at hand.\nPeetweet alone was for staying in camp, but when told that he might\nstay and keep house by himself he made up his mind to get all the fun\nhe could. The night was hot and moonless, Mosquitoes abundant, and\nin trampling and scrambling through the gloomy woods the hunters had\nplenty of small troubles, but they did not mind that so long as Turk\nwas willing to do his part. Once or twice he showed signs of interest\nin the trail, but soon decided against it.",
        "Thus they worked toward the Widdy Baggs’s till they came to a dry\nbrook bed. Turk began at once to travel up this, while Caleb tried\nto make him go down. But the Dog recognized no superior officer when\nhunting. After leading his impatient army a quarter of a mile away\nfrom the really promising heavy timber, Turk discovered what hewas after, and that was a little muddy puddle. In this he calmly lay\ndown, puffing, panting and lapping with energy, and his humble human\nfollowers had nothing to do but sit on a log and impatiently await\nhis lordship’s pleasure. Fifteen minutes went by, and Turk was still\nenjoying himself, when Sam ventured at last:",
        "“’Pears to me if I owned a Dog I’d own him.”",
        "“There’s no use crowdin’ him,” was the answer. “He’s runnin’ this\nhunt, an’ he knows it. A Dog without a mind of his own is no ’count.”",
        "So when Turk had puffed like a Porpoise, grunted and wallowed like\na Hog, to his heart’s content and to the envy of the eight who sat\nsweltering and impatient, he arose, all dribbling ooze, probably to\nseek a new wallowing place, when his nose discovered something on the\nbank that had far more effect than all the coaxings and threats of the\n\"waiting line,” and he gave a short bark that was a note of joy for\nthe boys. They were all attention now, as the old Hound sniffed it\nout, and in a few moments stirred the echoes with an opening blast of\nhis deepest strain.",
        "“Turk’s struck it rich!” opined Caleb.",
        "The old Dog’s bawling was strong now, but not very regular, showing\nthat the hunted animal’s course was crooked. Then there was a long\nbreak in it, showing possibly that the creature had run a fence or\nswung from one tree to another.",
        "“That’s a Coon,” said Yan eagerly, for he had not forgotten any detail\nof the other lesson.",
        "Caleb made no reply.",
        "The Hound tongued a long way off, but came back to the pond and had\none or two checks.",
        "“It’s a great running for a Coon,” Yan remarked, at length in doubt.\nThen to Caleb, “What do you think?”",
        "Caleb answered slowly: “I dunno what to think. It runs too far for a\nCoon, an’ ’tain’t treed yet; an’ I kin tell by the Dog’s voice he’s\nmad. If you was near him now you’d see all his back hair stannin’ up.”",
        "Another circle was announced by the Dog’s baying, and then the long,\ncontinuous, high-pitched yelping told that the game was treed at last.",
        "“Well, that puts Fox and Skunk out of it,” said the Trapper, “but it\ncertainly don’t act like a Coon on the ground.”",
        "“First there gets the Coon!” shouted Blackhawk, and the boys skurried\nthrough the dark woods, getting many a scratch and fall. As it was,\nYan and Wesley arrived together and touched the tree at the same\nmoment. The rest came straggling up, with Char-less last and Guy a\nlittle ahead of him. Guy wanted to relate the full particulars of his\nlatest glorious victory over Char-less, but all attention was now on\nold Turk, who was barking savagely up the tree.",
        "“Don’t unnerstan’ it at all, at all,” said Caleb. “Coony kind o’ tree,\nbut Dog don’t act Coony.”",
        "“Let’s have a fire,” said the Woodpecker, and the two crowds of boys\nbegan each a fire and strove hard to get theirs first ablaze.",
        "The firelight reached far up into the night, and once or twice the\nhunters thought they saw the shining eyes of the Coon.",
        "“Now who’s to climb?” asked the Medicine Man.",
        "“I will, I will,” etc., seven times repeated; even Guy and Char-less\nchimed in.",
        "“You’re mighty keen hunters, but I want you to know I can’t tell what\nit is that’s up that tree. It may be a powerful big Coon, but seems to\nme the Dog acts a little like it was a Cat, and ’tain’t so long since\nthere was Painter in this county. The fact of him treeing for Turk\ndon’t prove that he’s afraid of a Dog; lots of animals does that\n’cause they don’t want to be bothered with his noise. If it’s a Cat,\nhim as climbs is liable to get his face scratched. Judging by the\nactions of the Dog, I think it’s something dangerous. Now who\nwants the job?”",
        "For awhile no one spoke. Then Yan, “I’ll go if you’ll lend me the\nrevolver.”",
        "“So would I,” said Wesley quickly.",
        "“Well, now, we’ll draw straws\"–and Yan won. Caleb felled a thin tree\nagainst the big one and Yan climbed as he had done once before.",
        "There was an absence of the joking and chaffing that all had kept\nup when on the other occasion Yan went after the Coon. There was a\ntension that held them still and reached the climber to thrill him\nwith a weird sense of venturing into black darkness to face a fearful\nand mysterious danger. The feeling increased as he climbed from the\nleaning tree to the great trunk of the Basswood, to lose sight of his\ncomrades in the wilderness of broad leaves and twisted tree-arms.\nThe dancing firelight sent shadow-blots and light-spots in a dozen\ndirections with fantastic effect. Some of the feelings of the night at\nGarney’s grave came back to him, but this time with the knowledge of\nreal danger. A little higher and he was out of sight of his friends\nbelow. The danger began to appal him; he wanted to go back, and to\njustify the retreat he tried to call out, “No Coon here!” but his\nvoice failed him, and, as he clung to the branch, he remembered\nCaleb’s words, “There’s nothing ahead of grit, an’ grit ain’t so much\nnot bein’ scairt as it is goin’ straight ahead when you arescairt.” No; he would go on, come what would.",
        "“Find anything?” drawled a cheery voice below, just at the right time.",
        "Yan did not pause to answer, but continued to climb into the gloom.\nThen he thought he heard a Coon snarl above him. He swung to a higher\nbranch and shouted, “Coon here, all right!” but the moment he did so\na rattling growl sounded close to him, and looking down he saw a huge\ngrey beast spring to a large branch between him and the ground, then\ncome climbing savagely toward him. As it leaped to a still nearer\nplace Yan got a dim view of a curious four-cornered face, shaggy\nand striped, like the one he saw so long ago in Glenyan–it was an\nenormous Lynx.",
        "Yan got such a shock that he nearly lost his hold, but quickly\nrecovering, he braced himself in a crotch, and got out the revolver\njust as the Lynx with a fierce snarl leaped to a side branch that\nbrought it nearly on a level with him. He nervously cocked the pistol,\nand scarcely attempting to sight in the darkness, he fired and missed.\nThe Lynx recoiled a little and crouched at the report. The boys below\nraised a shout and Turk outdid them all in racket.",
        "“A Lynx!” shouted Yan, and his voice betrayed his struggle with fear.",
        "“Look out!” Caleb called. “You better not let him get too close.”",
        "The Lynx was growling ferociously. Yan put forth all his will-power to\ncontrol his trembling hand, took more deliberate aim, and fired. The\nfierce beast was struck, but leaped wildly at the boy. He threw up his\narm and it buried its teeth in his flesh, while Yan clung desperately\nto the tree with the other arm. In a moment he knew he would be\ndragged off and thrown to the ground, yet felt less fear now than he\nhad before. He clutched for the revolver with the left hand, but it\nfound only the fur of the Lynx, and the revolver dropped from his\ngrasp. Now he was indeed without hope, and dark fear fell on him. But\nthe beast was severely wounded. Its hind quarters were growing heavy.\nIt loosed its hold of Yan and struggled to get on the limb. A kick from\nhis right foot upset its balance; it slipped from the tree and flopped\nto the ground below, wounded, but full of fight. Turk rushed at it, but\ngot a blow from its armed paw that sent him off howling.",
        "[Illustration: “He nervously fired and missed.\"]",
        "A surge of reaction came over Yan. He might have fainted, but again he\nremembered the Trapper’s words, “Bravery is keeping on even when you\nare skairt.” He pulled himself together and very cautiously\nworked his way back to the leaning tree. Hearing strange sounds,\nyells, growls, sounds of conflict down below, expecting every moment\nto hear the Lynx scramble up the trunk again, to finish him, dimly\nhearing but not comprehending the shouts, he rested once at the\nleaning tree and breathed freely.",
        "“Hurry up, Yan, with that revolver,” shouted Blackhawk.",
        "“I dropped it long ago.”",
        "“Where is it?”",
        "Yan slid down the sapling without making reply. The Lynx had gone,\nbut not far. It would have got away, but Turk kept running around and\nbothering it so it could not even climb a tree, and the noise they\nmade in the thicket was easy to follow.",
        "“Where’s the revolver?” shouted Caleb, with unusual excitement.",
        "“I dropped it in the fight.”",
        "“I know. I heard it fall in the bushes,” and Sam soon found it.",
        "Caleb seized it, but Yan said feebly, “Let me! Let me! It’s my fight!”",
        "Caleb surrendered the pistol, said “Look out for the Dog!” and Yan\ncrawled through the bushes till that dark moving form was seen again.\nAnother shot and another. The sound of combat died away, and the\nIndians raised a yell of triumph–all but Little Beaver. A giddiness\ncame over him; he trembled and reeled, and sank down on a root. Caleb\nand Sam came up quickly.",
        "“What’s the matter, Yan?”",
        "“I’m sick–I––”",
        "Caleb took his arm. It was wet. A match was struck.",
        "“Hallo, you’re bleeding.”",
        "“Yes, he had me–he caught me up the tree. I–I–thought I was a\ngoner.”",
        "All interest was now turned from the dead Lynx to the wounded boy.",
        "“Let’s get him to the water.”",
        "“Guess the camp well is the nearest.”",
        "Caleb and Sam took care of Yan, while the others brought the Lynx.\nYan grew better as they moved slowly homeward. He told all about the\nattack of the Lynx.",
        "“Gosh! I’d ’a’ been scared out o’ my wits,” said Sam.",
        "“Guess I would, too,” added Caleb, to the surprise of the Tribe; “up\nthere, helpless, with a wounded Lynx–I tell you!”",
        "“Well, I was scared–just as scared as I could be,” admitted\nYan.",
        "At camp a blazing fire gave its lurid light. Cold water was handy and\nYan’s bleeding arm was laid bare. He was shocked and yet secretly\ndelighted to see what a mauling he had got, for his shirt sleeve was\nsoaked with blood, and the wondering words of his friends was sweetest\nmusic to his ears.",
        "Caleb and the city boy dressed his wounds, and when washed they did\nnot look so very dreadful.",
        "They were too much excited to sleep for an hour at least, and as they\nsat about the fire–that they did not need but would not dream of\ndoing without–Yan found no lack of enthusiasm in the circle, and\nblushed with pleasure to be the hero of the camp. Guy didn’t see\nanything to make so much fuss about, but Caleb said, “I knowed it; I\nalways knowed you was the stuff, after the night you went to Garney’s\ngrave.”",
        "On the Old Camp Ground",
        "It was threatening to rain again in the morning and the Indians\nexpected to tramp home heavy laden in the wet. But their Medicine Man\nhad a surprise in store. “I found an old friend not far from here and\nfixed it up with him to take us all home in his wagon.” They walked\nout to the edge of the rough land and found a farm wagon with two\nhorses and a driver. They got in, and in little less than a hour were\nsafely back to the dear old camp by the pond.",
        "The rain was over now, and as Caleb left for his own home he said:",
        "“Say, boys, how about that election for Head Chief? I reckon it’s due\nnow. Suppose you wait till to-morrow afternoon at four o’clock an’\nI’ll show you how to do it.”",
        "That night Yan and his friend were alone in their teepee. His arm was\nbound up, and proud he was of those bandages and delighted with the\ntrifling red spots that appeared yet on the last layer; but he was not\nin pain, nor, indeed, the worse for the adventure, for, thanks to his\nthick shirt, there was no poisoning. He slept as usual till long after\nmidnight, then awoke in bed with a peculiar feeling of well-being and\nclearness of mind. He had no bodily sense; he seemed floating alone,\nnot in the teepee nor in the woods, but in the world–not dreaming,\nbut wide awake–more awake than ever in his life before, for all his\nlife came clearly into view as never before: his stern, religious\ntraining; his father, refined and well-meaning, but blind, compelling\nhim to embark in a profession to which he was little inclined, and to\ngive up the one thing next his heart–his Woodcraft lore.",
        "Then Raften stepped into view, loud-voiced, externally coarse, but\nblessed with a good heart and a sound head. The farmer suffered sadly\nin contrast with the father, and yet Yan had to suppress the wish that\nRaften were his father. What had they in common? Nothing; and yet\nRaften had given him two of the dearest things in life. He, the\nhead of the house, a man of force and success, had treated Yan with\nrespect. Yan was enough like his own father to glory in the unwonted\ntaste; and like that other rugged stranger long ago in Glenyan, Raften\nhad also given him sympathy. Instead of considering his Woodcraft\npursuits mere trifling, the farmer had furthered them, and even joined\nto follow for a time. The thought of Bonnerton came back. Yan knew he\nmust return in a year at most; he knew that his dearest ambition of a\ncollege course in zoology was never to be realized, for his father\nhad told him he must go as errand boy at the first opening. Again his\nrebellious spirit was stirred, to what purpose he did not know. He\nwould rather stay here on the farm with the Raftens. But his early\nScriptural training was not without effect. “Honour thy father and\nthy mother” was of lasting force. He felt it to be a binding duty. He\ncould not rebel if he would. No, he would obey; and in that resolution\nnew light came. In taking him from college and sending him to the farm\nhis father had apparently cut off his hope of studies next his heart.\nInstead of suffering loss by this obedience, he had come to the\nlargest opportunity of his life.",
        "Yes! He would go back–be errand boy or anything to make a living, but\nin his hours of freedom he would keep a little kingdom of his own. The\nroad to it might lie through the cellar of a grocer’s shop, but he\nwould not flinch. He would strive and struggle as a naturalist. When\nhe had won the insight he was seeking, the position he sought would\nfollow, for every event in the woodland life had shown him–had shown\nthem all, that his was the kingdom of the Birds and Beasts and the\npower to comprehend them.",
        "And he seemed to float, happy in the fading of all doubt, glad in\nthe sense of victory. There was a noise outside. The teepee door was\nforced gently; a large animal entered. At another time Yan might\nhave been alarmed, but the uplift of his vision was on him still. He\nwatched it with curious unalarm. It gently came to his bed, licked his\nhand and laid down beside him. It was old Turk, and this was the first\ntime he had heeded any of them but Caleb.",
        "[Illustration: Old Turk]",
        "The New War Chief",
        "Caleb had been very busy all the day before doing no one knew what,\nand Saryann was busy, too. She had been very busy for long, but now\nshe was bustling. Then, it seems, Caleb had gone to Mrs. Raften, and\nshe was very busy, and Guy made a flying visit to Mrs. Burns, and\nshe had become busy. Thus they turned the whole neighbourhood into a\n\"bee.”",
        "For this was Sanger, where small gatherings held the same place as the\nclub, theatre and newspaper do in the lives of city folk. No matter\nwhat the occasion, a christening, wedding or funeral, a logging, a\nthreshing, a home-coming or a parting, the finishing of a new house\nor the buying of a new harness or fanning-mill, any one of these was\nample grounds for one of their “talking bees\"; so it was easy to set\nthe wheels a-running.",
        "At three o’clock three processions might have been seen wending\nthrough the woods. One was from Burns’s, including the whole family;\none from Raften’s, comprising the family and the hired men; one from\nCaleb’s, made up of Saryann and many of the Boyles. All brought\nbaskets.",
        "They were seated in a circle on the pleasant grassy bank of the\npond. Caleb and Sam took charge of the ceremonies. First, there were\nfoot-races, in which Yan won in spite of his wounded arm, the city boy\nmaking a good second; then target-shooting and “Deer-hunting,” that\nYan could not take part in. It was not in the programme, but Raften\ninsisted on seeing Yan measure the height of a knot in a tree without\ngoing to it, and grinned with delight when he found it was accurate.",
        "“Luk at that for eddication, Sam!” he roared. “When will ye be able to\ndo the like? Arrah, but ye’re good stuff, Yan, an’ I’ve got something\nhere’ll plase ye.”",
        "Raften now pulled out his purse and as magistrate paid over with\nevident joy the $5 bounty due for killing the Lynx. Then he added:\n\"An’ if it turns out as ye all claim” [and it did] “that this yer\nbeast is the Sheep-killer instid av old Turk, I’ll add that other\ntin.”",
        "Thus Yan came into the largest sum be had ever owned in his life.",
        "Then the Indians went into their teepees. Caleb set up a stake in the\nground and on that a new shield of wood covered with rawhide; over the\nrawhide was lightly fastened a piece of sacking.",
        "The guests were in a circle around this; at one side were some\nskins–Yan’s Lynx and Coon–and the two stuffed Owls.",
        "Then the drum was heard, “Túm-tum–túm-tum–túm-tum–túm-tum––\"\nThere was a volley of war-whoops, and out of the teepees dashed the\nSanger Indians in full war paint.",
        "  “Ki ki–ki yi–ki yi yi yi\n  Ki yi–ki yi–ki yi yi yi!”",
        "They danced in exact time to the two-measure of the drum that was\npounded by Blackhawk. Three times round the central post with the\nshield they danced, then the drum stopped, and they joined in a grand\nfinal war-whoop and squatted in a circle within that of the guests.",
        "The Great Woodpecker now arose–his mother had to be told who it\nwas–and made a characteristic speech:",
        "“Big Chiefs, Little Chiefs, and Squapooses of the Sanger Indians: A\nnumber of things has happened to rob this yer nation of its noble Head\nChief; they kin never again expect to have his equal, but this yer\nassembly is for to pick out a new one. We had a kind of whack at it\nthe other day, but couldn’t agree. Since then we had a hard trip, and\nthings has cleared up some, same as puttin’ Kittens in a pond will\ntell which one is the swimmer, an’ we’re here to-day to settle it.”",
        "Loud cries of “How–how–how–how–” while Blackhawk pounded the drum\nvigorously.",
        "“O’ course different ones has different gifts. Now who in all this\nTribe is the best runner? That’s Little Beaver.”",
        "(\"How–how–how–how–how–” and drum.)",
        "“That’s my drum, Ma!” said Guy aside, forgetting to applaud.",
        "“Who is the best trailer and climber? Little Beaver, again, I reckon.”",
        "(\"How–how–how–how–” and drum.)",
        "(\"He can’t see worth a cent!” whispered Guy to his mother.)",
        "“Who was it won the trial of grit at Garney’s grave? Why, it was\nLittle Beaver.”",
        "(\"An’ got pretty badly scared doin’ it!” was Guy’s aside.)",
        "“But who was it shot the Cat-Owl plumb in the heart, an’ fit the Lynx\nhand to hand, not to speak of the Coon? Little Beaver every time.”",
        "(\"He never killed a Woodchuck in his life, Ma!”)",
        "“Then, again, which of us can lay all the others on his back? Little\nBeaver, I s’pose.”",
        "(\"Well, I can lick Char-less, any time,” was Guy’s aside.)",
        "“Which of us has most grand coups and scalps?”",
        "“Ye’re forgittin’ his eddication,” put in Raften to be scornfully\nignored; even Little Beaver resented this as un-Indian.",
        "“Which has most scalps?” Sam repeated with sternness. “Here’s a scalp\nwon in battle with the inimy,” Woodpecker held it up, and the Medicine\nMan fastened it on the edge of the shield that hung from the post.",
        "“Here is one tuk from the Head Chief of the hostiles,” and Caleb\nfastened that to the shield. “Here is another tuk from the Second\nChief of the hostiles,” and Caleb placed it. “Here is one tuk from the\nGreat Head War Chief of the Sangers, and here is one from the Head\nChief of the Boilers, and another tuk in battle. Six scalps from six\nfamous warriors. This yere is the record for the whole Tribe, an’\nLittle Beaver done it; besides which, he draws pictures, writes\npoethry and cooks purty good, an’ I say Little Beaver is the one for\nChief! What says the rest?” and with one voice they shouted, “Hoorah\nfor Little Beaver!”",
        "“How–how–how–how–how–thump, thump, thump, thump.”",
        "“Any feller anything to say agin it?”",
        "“I eh–” Guy began.",
        "–\"has got to lick the Chief,” Sam continued, and Guy did not complete\nhis objection, though he whispered to his mother, “If it was Char-less\nI bet I’d show him.”",
        "[Illustration: The shield]",
        "Caleb now pulled the cover off the shield that he fastened the scalps\nto, and it showed the white Buffalo of the Sangers with a Little\nBeaver above it. Then he opened a bundle lying near and produced a\ngorgeous war-shirt of buff leather, a pair of leggins and moccasins,\nall fringed, beaded and painted, made by Saryann under Caleb’s\nguidance. They were quickly put on the new Chief; his war bonnet,\nsplendid with the plumes of his recent exploits, was all ready; and\nproud and happy in his new-found honours, not least of which were his\nwounds, he stepped forward.",
        "[Illustration: Little Beaver, the New War Chief]",
        "Caleb viewed him with paternal pride and said: “I knowed ye was the\nstuff the night ye went to Garney’s grave, an’ I knowed it again when\nye crossed the Big Swamp. Yan, ye could travel anywhere that man could\ngo,” and in that sentence the boy’s happiness was complete. He surely\nwas a Woodcrafter now. He stammered in a vain attempt to say something\nappropriate, till Sam relieved him by: “Three cheers for the Head War\nChief!” and when the racket was over the women opened their baskets\nand spread the picnic feast. Raften, who had been much gratified by\nhis son’s flow of speech, recorded a new vow to make him study law,\nbut took advantage of the first gap in the chatter to say:",
