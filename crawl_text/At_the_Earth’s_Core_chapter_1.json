        "In the first place please bear in mind that I do not\nexpect you to believe this story. Nor could you wonder\nhad you witnessed a recent experience of mine when,\nin the armor of blissful and stupendous ignorance,\nI gaily narrated the gist of it to a Fellow of the Royal\nGeological Society on the occasion of my last trip to London.",
        "You would surely have thought that I had been detected\nin no less a heinous crime than the purloining of the Crown\nJewels from the Tower, or putting poison in the coffee\nof His Majesty the King.",
        "The erudite gentleman in whom I confided congealed\nbefore I was half through!—it is all that saved him\nfrom exploding—and my dreams of an Honorary Fellowship,\ngold medals, and a niche in the Hall of Fame faded into\nthe thin, cold air of his arctic atmosphere.",
        "But I believe the story, and so would you, and so would\nthe learned Fellow of the Royal Geological Society, had you\nand he heard it from the lips of the man who told it to me.\nHad you seen, as I did, the fire of truth in those gray eyes;\nhad you felt the ring of sincerity in that quiet voice;\nhad you realized the pathos of it all—you, too, would believe.\nYou would not have needed the final ocular proof that I\nhad—the weird rhamphorhynchus-like creature which he\nhad brought back with him from the inner world.",
        "I came upon him quite suddenly, and no less unexpectedly,\nupon the rim of the great Sahara Desert. He was standing\nbefore a goat-skin tent amidst a clump of date palms within\na tiny oasis. Close by was an Arab douar of some eight\nor ten tents.",
        "I had come down from the north to hunt lion. My party\nconsisted of a dozen children of the desert—I was the only\n“white” man. As we approached the little clump of verdure\nI saw the man come from his tent and with hand-shaded eyes\npeer intently at us. At sight of me he advanced rapidly\nto meet us.",
        "“A white man!” he cried. “May the good Lord be praised! I\nhave been watching you for hours, hoping against hope that\nTHIS time there would be a white man. Tell me the date.\nWhat year is it?”",
        "And when I had told him he staggered as though he had\nbeen struck full in the face, so that he was compelled\nto grasp my stirrup leather for support.",
        "“It cannot be!” he cried after a moment. “It cannot be!\nTell me that you are mistaken, or that you are but joking.”",
        "“I am telling you the truth, my friend,” I replied.\n“Why should I deceive a stranger, or attempt to, in so\nsimple a matter as the date?”",
        "For some time he stood in silence, with bowed head.",
        "“Ten years!” he murmured, at last. “Ten years, and I\nthought that at the most it could be scarce more than one!\"\nThat night he told me his story—the story that I give you\nhere as nearly in his own words as I can recall them.",
