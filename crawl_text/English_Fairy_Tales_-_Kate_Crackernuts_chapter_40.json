        "Once upon a time there was a king and a queen, as in many lands have\nbeen. The king had a daughter, Anne, and the queen had one named Kate,\nbut Anne was far bonnier than the queen’s daughter, though they loved\none another like real sisters. The queen was jealous of the king’s\ndaughter being bonnier than her own, and cast about to spoil her\nbeauty. So she took counsel of the henwife, who told her to send the\nlassie to her next morning fasting.",
        "So next morning early, the queen said to Anne, “Go, my dear, to the\nhenwife in the glen, and ask her for some eggs.” So Anne set out, but\nas she passed through the kitchen she saw a crust, and she took and\nmunched it as she went along.",
        "When she came to the henwife’s she asked for eggs, as she had been\ntold to do; the henwife said to her, “Lift the lid off that pot there\nand see.” The lassie did so, but nothing happened. “Go home to your\nminnie and tell her to keep her larder door better locked,” said the\nhenwife. So she went home to the queen and told her what the henwife\nhad said. The queen knew from this that the lassie had had something\nto eat, so watched the next morning and sent her away fasting; but the\nprincess saw some country-folk picking peas by the roadside, and being\nvery kind she spoke to them and took a handful of the peas, which she\nate by the way.",
        "When she came to the henwife’s, she said, “Lift the lid off the pot\nand you’ll see.” So Anne lifted the lid but nothing happened. Then the\nhenwife was rare angry and said to Anne, “Tell your minnie the pot\nwon’t boil if the fire’s away.” So Anne went home and told the queen.",
        "The third day the queen goes along with the girl herself to the\nhenwife. Now, this time, when Anne lifted the lid off the pot, off\nfalls her own pretty head, and on jumps a sheep’s head.",
        "So the queen was now quite satisfied, and went back home.",
        "Her own daughter, Kate, however, took a fine linen cloth and wrapped\nit round her sister’s head and took her by the hand and they both went\nout to seek their fortune. They went on, and they went on, and they\nwent on, till they came to a castle. Kate knocked at the door and\nasked for a night’s lodging for herself and a sick sister. They went\nin and found it was a king’s castle, who had two sons, and one of them\nwas sickening away to death and no one could find out what ailed him.\nAnd the curious thing was that whoever watched him at night was never\nseen any more. So the king had offered a peck of silver to anyone who\nwould stop up with him. Now Katie was a very brave girl, so she\noffered to sit up with him.",
        "Till midnight all goes well. As twelve o clock rings, however, the\nsick prince rises, dresses himself, and slips downstairs. Kate\nfollowed, but he didn’t seem to notice her. The prince went to the\nstable, saddled his horse, called his hound, jumped into the saddle,\nand Kate leapt lightly up behind him. Away rode the prince and Kate\nthrough the greenwood, Kate, as they pass, plucking nuts from the\ntrees and filling her apron with them. They rode on and on till they\ncame to a green hill. The prince here drew bridle and spoke, “Open,\nopen, green hill, and let the young prince in with his horse and his\nhound,” and Kate added, “and his lady him behind.”",
        "Immediately the green hill opened and they passed in. The prince\nentered a magnificent hall, brightly lighted up, and many beautiful\nfairies surrounded the prince and led him off to the dance. Meanwhile,\nKate, without being noticed, hid herself behind the door. There she\nsees the prince dancing, and dancing, and dancing, till he could dance\nno longer and fell upon a couch. Then the fairies would fan him till\nhe could rise again and go on dancing.",
        "At last the cock crew, and the prince made all haste to get on\nhorseback; Kate jumped up behind, and home they rode. When the morning\nsun rose they came in and found Kate sitting down by the fire and\ncracking her nuts. Kate said the prince had a good night; but she\nwould not sit up another night unless she was to get a peck of gold.\nThe second night passed as the first had done. The prince got up at\nmidnight and rode away to the green hill and the fairy ball, and Kate\nwent with him, gathering nuts as they rode through the forest. This\ntime she did not watch the prince, for she knew he would dance and\ndance, and dance. But she sees a fairy baby playing with a wand, and\noverhears one of the fairies say: “Three strokes of that wand would\nmake Kate’s sick sister as bonnie as ever she was.” So Kate rolled\nnuts to the fairy baby, and rolled nuts till the baby toddled after\nthe nuts and let fall the wand, and Kate took it up and put it in her\napron. And at cockcrow they rode home as before, and the moment Kate\ngot home to her room she rushed and touched Anne three times with the\nwand, and the nasty sheep’s head fell off and she was her own pretty\nself again. The third night Kate consented to watch, only if she\nshould marry the sick prince. All went on as on the first two nights.\nThis time the fairy baby was playing with a birdie; Kate heard one of\nthe fairies say: “Three bites of that birdie would make the sick\nprince as well as ever he was.” Kate rolled all the nuts she had to\nthe fairy baby till the birdie was dropped, and Kate put it in her\napron.",
        "At cockcrow they set off again, but instead of cracking her nuts as\nshe used to do, this time Kate plucked the feathers off and cooked the\nbirdie. Soon there arose a very savoury smell. “Oh!” said the sick\nprince, “I wish I had a bite of that birdie,” so Kate gave him a bite\nof the birdie, and he rose up on his elbow. By-and-by he cried out\nagain: “Oh, if I had another bite of that birdie!” so Kate gave him\nanother bite, and he sat up on his bed. Then he said again: “Oh! if I\nonly had a third bite of that birdie!” So Kate gave him a third bite,\nand he rose quite well, dressed himself, and sat down by the fire, and\nwhen the folk came in next morning they found Kate and the young\nprince cracking nuts together. Meanwhile his brother had seen Annie\nand had fallen in love with her, as everybody did who saw her sweet\npretty face. So the sick son married the well sister, and the well son\nmarried the sick sister, and they all lived happy and died happy, and\nnever drank out of a dry cappy.",
