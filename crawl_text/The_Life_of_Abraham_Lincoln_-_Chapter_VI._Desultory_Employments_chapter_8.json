        "\nAbraham Lincoln (1809-1865)\n16th President of the United States",
        "\n\n",
        "Upon the arrival of the Lincoln family in Illinois, they had the few\ntools which would be considered almost necessary to every frontiersman:\nnamely, a common ax, broad-ax, hand-saw, whip-saw. The mauls and wedges\nwere of wood and were made by each workman for himself. To this stock\nof tools may also be added a small supply of nails brought from\nIndiana, for at that period nails were very expensive and used with the\nstrictest economy. By means of pegs and other devices people managed to\nget along without them.",
        "When Abraham Lincoln went to New Salem it was (like all frontier towns)\na promising place. It grew until it had the enormous population of\nabout one hundred people, housed–or log-cabined–in fifteen primitive\nstructures. The tributary country was not very important in a\ncommercial sense. To this population no less than four general stores–\nthat is, stores containing nearly everything that would be needed in\nthat community–offered their wares.",
        "The town flourished, at least it lived, about through the period that\nLincoln dwelt there, after which it disappeared.",
        "Lincoln was ready to take any work that would get him a living. A\nneighbor advised him to make use of his great strength in the work of a\nblacksmith. He seriously thought of learning the trade, but was,\nfortunately for the country, diverted from doing so.",
        "The success of the expedition to New Orleans had won the admiration of\nhis employer, Denton Offutt, and he now offered Lincoln a clerkship in\nhis prospective store. The offer was accepted partly because it gave\nhim some time to read, and it was here that he came to know the two\ngreat poets, Burns and Shakespeare.",
        "Offutt’s admiration of the young clerk did him credit, but his voluble\nexpression of it was not judicious. He bragged that Lincoln was smart\nenough to be president, and that he could run faster, jump higher,\nthrow farther, and “wrastle” better than any man in the country. In the\nneighborhood there was a gang of rowdies, kind at heart but very rough,\nknown as “the Clary’s Grove boys.” They took the boasting of Offutt as\na direct challenge to themselves and eagerly accepted it. So they put\nup a giant by the name of Jack Armstrong as their champion and arranged\na “wrastling” match. All went indifferently for a while until Lincoln\nseemed to be getting the better of his antagonist, when the “boys\"\ncrowded in and interfered while Armstrong attempted a foul. Instantly\nLincoln was furious. Putting forth all his strength he lifted Jack up\nand shook him as a terrier shakes a rat. The crowd, in their turn,\nbecame angry and set out to mob him. He backed up against a wall and in\nhot indignation awaited the onset. Armstrong was the first to recover\nhis good sense. Exclaiming, “Boys, Abe Lincoln’s the best fellow that\never broke into the settlement,” he held out his hand to Lincoln who\nreceived it with perfect good nature. From that day these boys never\nlost their admiration for him. He was their hero. From that day, too,\nhe became the permanent umpire, the general peacemaker of the region.\nHis good nature, his self-command, and his manifest fairness placed his\ndecisions beyond question. His popularity was established once for all\nin the entire community.",
        "There are some, anecdotes connected with his work in the store which\nare worth preserving because they illustrate traits of his character.\nHe once sold a half pound of tea to a customer. The next morning as he\nwas tidying up the store he saw, by the weights which remained in the\nscales, that he had inadvertently given her four, instead of eight,\nounces. He instantly weighed out the balance and carried it to her, not\nwaiting for his breakfast.",
        "At another time when he counted up his cash at night he discovered that\nhe had charged a customer an excess of six and a quarter cents. He\nclosed up the store at once and walked to the home of the customer, and\nreturned the money. It was such things as these, in little matters as\nwell as great, that gave him the nickname of “honest Abe” which, to his\nhonor be it said, clung to him through life.",
        "One incident illustrates his chivalry. While he was waiting upon some\nwomen, a ruffian came into the store using vulgar language. Lincoln\nasked him to desist, but he became more abusive than ever. After the\nwomen had gone, Lincoln took him out of the store, threw him on the\nground, rubbed smartweed in his face and eyes until he howled for\nmercy, and then he gave him a lecture which did him more practical good\nthan a volume of Chesterfield’s letters.",
        "Some time after Offutt’s store had “winked out,” while Lincoln was\nlooking for employment there came a chance to buy one half interest in\na store, the other half being owned by an idle, dissolute fellow named\nBerry who ultimately drank himself into his grave. Later, another\nopening came in the following way: the store of one Radford had been\nwrecked by the horse-play of some ruffians, and the lot was bought by\nMr. Greene for four hundred dollars. He employed Lincoln to make an\ninvoice of the goods and he in turn offered Greene two hundred and\nfifty dollars for the bargain and the offer was accepted. But even that\nwas not the last investment. The fourth and only remaining store in the\nhamlet was owned by one Rutledge. This also was bought out by the firm\nof Berry & Lincoln. Thus they came to have the monopoly of the\nmercantile business in the hamlet of New Salem.",
        "Be it known that in all these transactions not a dollar in money\nchanged hands. Men bought with promissory notes and sold for the same\nconsideration. The mercantile venture was not successful. Berry was\ndrinking and loafing, and Lincoln, who did not work as faithfully for\nhimself as for another, was usually reading or telling stories. So when\na couple of strangers, Trent by name, offered to buy out the store, the\noffer was accepted and more promissory notes changed hands. About the\ntime these last notes came due, the Trent brothers disappeared between\ntwo days. Then Berry died.",
        "The outcome of the whole series of transactions was that Lincoln was\nleft with an assortment of promissory notes bearing the names of the\nHerndons, Radford, Greene, Rutledge, Berry, and the Trents. With one\nexception, which will be duly narrated, his creditors told him to pay\nwhen he was able. He promised to put all of his earnings, in excess of\nmodest living expenses, into the payment of these obligations. It was\nthe burden of many years and he always called it “the national debt.\"\nBut he kept his word, paying both principal and the high rate of\ninterest until 1848, or after fifteen years, when a member of congress,\nhe paid the last cent. He was still “honest Abe.” This narrative ranks\nthe backwoodsman with Sir Walter Scott and Mark Twain, though no\ndinners were tendered to him and no glowing eulogies were published\nfrom ocean to ocean.",
        "His only further experience in navigation was the piloting of a\nCincinnati steamboat, the Talisman, up the Sangamon River (during the\nhigh water in spring time) to show that that stream was navigable.\nNothing came of it however, and Springfield was never made “the head of\nnavigation.”",
        "It was in the midst of the mercantile experiences above narrated that\nthe Black Hawk war broke out. Black Hawk was chief of the Sac Indians,\nwho, with some neighboring tribes, felt themselves wronged by the\nwhites. Some of them accordingly put on the paint, raised the whoop,\nand entered the warpath in northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin.\nThe governor called for soldiers, and Lincoln volunteered with the\nrest.",
        "The election of captain of the company was according to an original\nmethod. The two candidates were placed a short distance apart and the\nmen were invited to line up with one or the other according to their\npreference. When this had been done it was seen that Lincoln had about\nthree quarters of the men. This testimony to his popularity was\ngratifying. After he became president of the United States he declared\nthat no success that ever came to him gave him so much solid\nsatisfaction.",
        "Lincoln saw almost nothing of the war. His only casualty came after its\nclose. He had been mustered out and his horse was stolen so that he was\ncompelled to walk most of the way home. After the expiration of his\nterm of enlistment he reenlisted as a private. As he saw no fighting\nthe war was to him almost literally a picnic. But in 1848, when he was\nin congress, the friends of General Cass were trying to make political\ncapital out of his alleged military services. This brought from Lincoln\na speech which showed that he had not lost the power of satire which he\npossessed while a lad in Indiana.",
        "“Did you know, Mr. Speaker, I am a military hero? In the days of the\nBlack Hawk war I fought, bled, and–came away. I was not at Stillman’s\ndefeat, but I was about as near it as General Cass was to Hull’s\nsurrender; and, like him, I saw the place very soon afterwards. It is\nquite certain I did not break my sword, for I had none to break, but I\nbent my musket pretty bad on one occasion. If General Cass went in\nadvance of me picking whortleberries, I guess I surpassed him in\ncharges on the wild onions. If he saw any live fighting Indians, it was\nmore than I did, but I had a good many bloody struggles with the\nmosquitoes; and although I never fainted from loss of blood, I can\ntruly say I was often very hungry. If ever I should conclude to doff\nwhatever our Democratic friends may suppose there is of black-cockade\nFederalism about me, and thereupon they shall take me up as their\ncandidate for the Presidency, I protest that they shall not make fun of\nme, as they have of General Cass, by attempting to write me into a\nmilitary hero.”",
        "In 1833 Lincoln was appointed postmaster at New Salem. To him the chief\nadvantage of this position was the fact that it gave him the means of\nreading the papers. The principal one of these was the Louisville\nJournal, an exceedingly able paper, for it was in charge of\nGeorge D. Prentice, one of the ablest editors this country has ever\nproduced. The duties of the post-office were few because the mail was\nlight. The occasional letters which came were usually carried around by\nthe postmaster in his hat. When one asked for his mail, he would\ngravely remove his hat and search through the package of letters.",
        "This office was discontinued in a short time, but no agent of the\ngovernment came to close up the accounts. Years afterwards, when\nLincoln was in Springfield, the officer suddenly appeared and demanded\nthe balance due to the United States, the amount being seventeen\ndollars and a few cents. A friend who was by, knowing that Lincoln was\nshort of funds, in order to save him from embarrassment, offered to\nlend him the needful sum. “Hold on a minute and let’s see how we come\nout,” said he. He went to his room and returned with an old rag\ncontaining money. This he counted out, being the exact sum to a cent.\nIt was all in small denominations of silver and copper, just as it had\nbeen received. In all his emergencies of need he had never touched this\nsmall fund which he held in trust. To him it was sacred. He was still\n“honest Abe.”",
        "In the early thirties, when the state of Illinois was being settled\nwith great rapidity, the demand for surveyors was greater than the\nsupply. John Calhoun, surveyor for the government, was in urgent need\nof a deputy, and Lincoln was named as a man likely to be able to fit\nhimself for the duties on short notice. He was appointed. He borrowed\nthe necessary book and went to work in dead earnest to learn the\nscience. Day and night he studied until his friends, noticing the\nwearing effect on his health, became alarmed. But by the end of six\nweeks, an almost incredibly brief period of time, he was ready for\nwork.",
        "It is certain that his outfit was of the simplest description, and\nthere is a tradition that at first, instead of a surveyor’s chain he\nused a long, straight, wild-grape vine. Those who understand the\nconditions and requirements of surveying in early days say that this is\nnot improbable. A more important fact is that Lincoln’s surveys have\nnever been called in question, which is something that can be said of\nfew frontier surveyors. Though he learned the science in so short a\ntime, yet here, as always, he was thorough.",
        "It was said in the earlier part of this chapter that to the holders of\nLincoln’s notes who consented to await his ability to pay, there was\none exception. One man, when his note fell due, seized horse and\ninstruments, and put a temporary stop to his surveying. But a neighbor\nbought these in and returned them to Lincoln. He never forgot the\nkindness of this man, James Short by name, and thirty years later\nappointed him Indian agent.",
        "At this point may be mentioned an occurrence which took place a year or\ntwo later. It was his first romance of love, his engagement to a\nbeautiful girl, Ann Rutledge, and his bereavement. Her untimely death\nnearly unsettled his mind. He was afflicted with melancholy to such a\ndegree that his friends dared not leave him alone. For years afterwards\nthe thought of her would shake his whole frame with emotion, and he\nwould sit with his face buried in his hands while the tears trickled\nthrough. A friend once begged him to try to forget his sorrow. “I\ncannot,” he said; “the thought of the rain and snow on her grave fills\nme with indescribable grief.”",
        "Somehow, we know not how, the poem “Oh, why should the spirit of mortal\nbe proud?” was in his mind connected with Ann Rutledge. Possibly it may\nhave been a favorite with her. There was certainly some association,\nand through his whole life he was fond of it and often repeated it. Nor\ndid he forget her. It was late in life that he said: “I really and\ntruly loved the girl and think often of her now.” Then, after a pause,\n“And I have loved the name of Rutledge to this day.”",
        "This bereavement took much from Lincoln. Did it give him nothing?\nPatience, earnestness, tenderness, sympathy–these are sometimes the\ngifts which are sent by the messenger Sorrow. We are justified in\nbelieving that this sad event was one of the means of ripening the\ncharacter of this great man, and that to it was due a measure of his\nusefulness in his mature years.",
