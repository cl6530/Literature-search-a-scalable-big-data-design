        "The Rangers’ neighbors saw the visits of Hargrave and Torrey. Immediately\na rumor of a bequest to Tecumseh was racing through the town and up the\nBluffs and through the fashionable suburb. It arrived at Point Helen, the\nseat of the Whitneys, within an hour after Torrey left Ranger. It had\naccumulated confirmatory detail by that time–the bequest was large; was\nvery large; was half his fortune–and the rest of the estate was to go to\nthe college should Arthur and Adelaide die childless.",
        "Mrs. Whitney lost no time. At half-past four she was seated in the same\nchair in which Hargrave and Torrey had sat. It was not difficult to bring\nup the subject of the two marriages, which were doubly to unite the\nhouses and fortunes of Ranger and Whitney–the marriages of Arthur and\nJanet, of Ross and Adelaide. “And, of course,” said Mrs. Whitney, “we all\nwant the young people started right. I don’t believe children ought to\nfeel dependent on their parents. It seems to me that puts filial and\nparental love on a very low plane. Don’t you think so?”",
        "“Yes,” said Hiram.",
        "“The young people ought to feel that their financial position is secure.\nAnd, as you and Ellen and Charles and I have lived for our children, have\ntoiled to raise them above the sordid cares and anxieties of life, we\nought to complete our work now and make them–happy.”",
        "Hiram did not speak, though she gave him ample time.",
        "“So,” pursued Mrs. Whitney, “I thought I wouldn’t put off any longer\ntalking about what Charles and I have had in mind some months. Ross and\nJanet will soon be here, and I know all four of the children are anxious\nto have the engagements formally completed.”",
        "“Completed?” said Hiram.",
        "“Yes,” reaffirmed Matilda. “Of course they can’t be completed until we\nparents have done our share. You and Ellen want to know that Arthur and\nAdelaide won’t be at the mercy of any reverse in business Charles might\nhave–or of any caprice which might influence him in making his will. And\nCharles and I want to feel the same way as to our Ross and Janet.”",
        "“Yes,” said Hiram. “I see.” A smile of stern irony roused his features\nfrom their repose into an expressiveness that made Mrs. Whitney\nexceedingly uncomfortable–but the more resolute.",
        "“Charles is willing to be liberal both in immediate settlement and in\nbinding himself in the matter of his will,” she went on. “He often says,\n’I don’t want my children to be impatient for me to die. I want to make\n’em feel they’re getting, if anything, more because I’m alive.’”",
        "A long pause, then Hiram said: “That’s one way of looking at it.”",
        "“That’s your way,” said Matilda, as if the matter were settled. And\nshe smiled her softest and sweetest. But Hiram saw only the glitter in\nher cold brown eyes, a glitter as hard as the sheen of her\nhenna-stained hair.",
        "“No,” said he emphatically, “that’s not my way. That’s the broad and\neasy way that leads to destruction. Ellen and I,” he went on, his\nexcitement showing only in his lapses into dialect, “we hain’t worked\nall our lives so that our children’ll be shiftless idlers, settin’\n’round, polishin’ their fingernails, and thinkin’ up foolishness and\nbreedin’ fools.”",
        "Matilda had always known that Hiram and Ellen were hopelessly vulgar; but\nshe had thought they cherished a secret admiration for the “higher\nthings” beyond their reach, and were resolved that their son should be a\ngentleman and their daughter a lady. She found in Hiram’s energetic\nbitterness nothing to cause her to change her view. “He simply wants to\nhold on to his property to the last, and play the tyrant,” she said to\nherself. “All people of property naturally feel that way.” And she held\nsteadily to her programme. “Well, Hiram,” she proceeded tranquilly, “if\nthose marriages are to take place, Charles and I will expect you to meet\nus halfway.”",
        "“If Ross and my Delia and Arthur and your Jane are fond of each other,\nlet ’em marry as you and Charles, as Ellen and I married. I ain’t buyin’\nyour son, nor sellin’ my daughter. That’s my last word, Tillie.”",
        "On impulse, he pressed the electric button in the wall behind him.\nWhen the new upstairs girl came, he said: “Tell the children I want\nto see ’em.”",
        "Arthur and Adelaide presently came, flushed with the exercise of the\ntennis the girl had interrupted.",
        "“Mrs. Whitney, here,” said Hiram, “tells me her children won’t marry\nwithout settlements, as it’s called. And I’ve been tellin’ her that my\nson and daughter ain’t buyin’ and sellin’.”",
        "Mrs. Whitney hid her fury. “Your father has a quaint way of expressing\nhimself,” she said, laughing elegantly. “I’ve simply been trying to\npersuade him to do as much toward securing the future of you two as Mr.\nWhitney is willing to do. Don’t be absurd, Hiram. You know better than to\ntalk that way.”",
        "Hiram looked steadily at her. “You’ve been travelin’ about, ’Tilda,\"\nhe said, “gettin’ together a lot of newfangled notions. Ellen and I\nand our children stick to the old way.” And he looked at Arthur, then\nat Adelaide.",
        "Their faces gave him a twinge at the heart. “Speak up!” he said. “Do you\nor do you not stick to the old way?”",
        "“I can’t talk about it, father,” was Adelaide’s evasive answer, her face\nscarlet and her eyes down.",
        "“And you, sir?” said Hiram to his son.",
        "“You’ll have to excuse me, sir,” replied Arthur coldly.",
        "Hiram winced before Mrs. Whitney’s triumphant glance. He leaned forward\nand, looking at his daughter, said: “Del, would you marry a man who\nwouldn’t take you unless you brought him a fortune?”",
        "“No, father,” Adelaide answered. She was meeting his gaze now. “But, at\nthe same time, I’d rather not be dependent on my husband.”",
        "“Do you think your mother is dependent on me?”",
        "“That’s different,” said Adelaide, after a pause.",
        "“How?” asked Hiram.",
        "Adelaide did not answer, could not answer. To answer honestly would be\nto confess that which had been troubling her greatly of late–the\nfeeling that there was something profoundly unsatisfactory in the\nrelations between Ross and herself; that what he was giving her was\ndifferent not only in degree but even in kind from what she wanted, or\nought to want, from what she was trying to give him, or thought she\nought to try to give him.",
        "“And you, Arthur?” asked Hiram in the same solemn, appealing tone.",
        "“I should not ask Janet to marry me unless I was sure I could support her\nin the manner to which she is accustomed,” said Arthur. “I certainly\nshouldn’t wish to be dependent upon her.”",
        "“Then, your notion of marrying is that people get married for a\nliving, for luxury. I suppose you’d expect her to leave you if you\nlost your money?”",
        "“That’s different,” said Arthur, restraining the impulse to reason with\nhis illogical father whose antiquated sentimentalism was as unfitted to\nthe new conditions of American life as were his ideas about work.",
        "“You see, Hiram,” said Mrs. Whitney, good-humoredly, “your children\noutvote you.”",
        "The master workman brought his fist down on the arm of his chair–not a\ngesture of violence, but of dignity and power. “I don’t stand for the\nnotion that marriage is living in luxury and lolling in carriages and\nshowing off before strangers. I told you what my last word was, Matilda.”",
        "Mrs. Whitney debated with herself full half a minute before she\nspoke. In a tone that betrayed her all but departed hope of changing\nhim, she said: “It is a great shock to me to have you even pretend to\nbe so heartless–to talk of breaking these young people’s hearts–just\nfor a notion.”",
        "“It’s better to break their hearts before marriage,” replied Hiram, “than\nto let them break their lives, and their hearts, too, on such marriages.\nThe girl that wants my son only if he has money to enable her to make a\nfool of herself, ain’t fit to be a wife–and a mother. As for Del and\nRoss–The man that looks at what a woman has will never look at what\nshe is–and my daughter’s well rid of him.”",
        "A painful silence, then Mrs. Whitney rose. “If I hadn’t suspected, Hiram,\nthat you intended to cheat your children out of their rights in order to\nget a reputation as a philanthropist, I’d not have brought this matter up\nat this time. I see my instincts didn’t mislead me. But I don’t give up\nhope. I’ve known you too many years, Hiram Ranger, not to know that your\nheart is in the right place. And, after you think it over, you will give\nup this wicked–yes, wicked–plan old Doctor Hargrave has taken advantage\nof your sickness to wheedle you into.”",
        "Hiram, his face and hands like yellow wax, made no answer. Arthur and\nAdelaide followed Mrs. Whitney from the room. “Thank you, Mrs. Whitney,\"\nsaid Arthur, gratefully, when they were out of his father’s hearing. “I\ndon’t know what has come over him of late. He has gone back to his\nchildhood and under the spell of the ideas that seemed, and no doubt\nwere, right then. I believe you have set him to thinking. He’s the best\nfather in the world when he is well and can see things clearly.”",
        "Mrs. Whitney was not so sanguine, but she concealed it. She appreciated\nwhat was troubling Hiram. While she encouraged her own son, her Ross, to\nbe a “gentleman,” she had enough of the American left to see the flaws in\nthat new ideal of hers–when looking at another woman’s son. And the\nsuperciliousness which delighted her in Ross, irritated her in Arthur;\nfor, in him, it seemed a sneering reflection upon the humble and\ntoilsome beginnings of Charles and herself. She believed–not without\nreason–that, under Ross’s glossy veneer of gentleman, there was a shrewd\nand calculating nature; it, she thought, would not permit the gentleman\nto make mess of those matters, which, coarse and sordid though they were,\nstill must be looked after sharply if the gentleman was to be kept going.\nBut she was, not unnaturally, completely taken in by Arthur’s similar\ngame, the more easily as Arthur put into it an intensity of energy which\nRoss had not. She therefore thought Arthur as unpractical as he so\nfashionably professed, thought he accepted without reservation “our\nset’s” pretenses of aristocracy for appearance’s sake. “Of course, your\nfather’ll come round,” she said, friendly but not cordial. “All that’s\nnecessary is that you and Adelaide use a little tact.”",
        "And she was in her victoria and away, a very grand-looking lady, indeed,\nwith two in spick and span summer livery on the box, with her exquisite\nwhite and gold sunshade, a huge sapphire in the end of the handle, a\nstring of diamonds worth a small fortune round her neck, a gold bag,\nstudded with diamonds, in her lap, and her superb figure clad in a\nclose-fitting white cloth dress. In the gates she swept past Torrey and\nhis two clerks accompanying him as witnesses. She understood; her face\nwas anything but an index to her thoughts as she bowed and smiled\ngraciously in response to the old judge’s salutation.",
        "Torrey read the will to Hiram slowly, pausing after each paragraph for\nsign of approval or criticism. But Hiram gave no more indication of his\nthought, by word or expression or motion, than if he had been a seated\nstatue. The reading came to an end, but neither man spoke. The choir of\nbirds, assembled in the great trees round the house, flooded the room\nwith their evening melody. At last, Hiram said: “Please move that table\nin front of me.”",
        "Torrey put the table before him, laid the will upon it ready for\nthe signing.",
        "Hiram took a pen; Torrey went to the door and brought in the two clerks\nwaiting in the hall. The three men stood watching while Hiram’s eyes\nslowly read each word of the will. He dipped the pen and, with a hand\nthat trembled in spite of all his obvious efforts to steady it, wrote his\nname on the line to which Torrey silently pointed. The clerks signed as\nwitnesses.",
        "“Thank you,” said Hiram. “You had better take it with you, judge.”",
        "“Very well,” said Torrey, tears in his eyes, a quaver in his voice.",
        "A few seconds and Hiram was alone staring down at the surface of the\ntable, where he could still see and read the will. His conscience told\nhim he had “put his house in order\"; but he felt as if he had set fire to\nit with his family locked within, and was watching it and them burn to\nashes, was hearing their death cries and their curses upon him.",
        "The two young people, chilled by Mrs. Whitney’s manner, flawless though\nit was, apparently, had watched with sinking hearts the disappearance of\nher glittering chariot and her glistening steeds. Then they had gone into\nthe garden before Torrey and the clerks arrived. And they sat there\nthinking each his own kind of melancholy thoughts.",
        "“What did she mean by that remark about Doctor Hargrave?” asked Arthur,\nafter some minutes of this heavy silence.",
        "“I don’t know,” said Adelaide.",
        "“We must get mother to go at father,” Arthur continued.",
        "Adelaide made no answer.",
        "Arthur looked at her irritably. “What are you thinking about, Del?\"\nhe demanded.",
        "“I don’t like Mrs. Whitney. Do you?”",
        "“Oh, she’s a good enough imitation of the real thing,” said Arthur. “You\ncan’t expect a lady in the first generation.”",
        "Adelaide’s color slowly mounted. “You don’t mean that,” said she.",
        "He frowned and retorted angrily: “There’s a great deal of truth that\nwe don’t like. Why do you always get mad at me for saying what we\nboth think?”",
        "“I admit it’s foolish and wrong of me,” said she; “but I can’t help it.\nAnd if I get half-angry with you, I get wholly angry with myself for\nbeing contemptible enough to think those things. Don’t you get angry at\nyourself for thinking them?”",
        "Arthur laughed mirthlessly–an admission.",
        "“We and father can’t both be right,” she pursued. “I suppose we’re both\npartly right and partly wrong–that’s usually the way it is. But I can’t\nmake up my mind just where he begins to be wrong.”",
        "“Why not admit he’s right through and through, and be done with it?\"\ncried Arthur impatiently. “Why not tell him so, and square yourself\nwith him?”",
        "Adelaide, too hurt to venture speech, turned away. She lingered a while\nin the library; on her way down the hall to ascend to her own room she\nlooked in at her father. There he sat so still that but for the regular\nrise and fall of his chest she would have thought him dead. “He’s\nasleep,” she murmured, the tears standing in her eyes and raining in her\nheart. Her mother she could judge impartially; her mother’s disregard of\nthe changes which had come to assume so much importance in her own and\nArthur’s lives often made her wince. But the same disregard in a man did\nnot offend her; it had the reverse effect. It seemed to her, to the woman\nin her, the fitting roughness of the colossal statue. “That’s a man!\"\nshe now said to herself proudly, as she gazed at him.",
        "His eyes opened and fixed upon her in a look so agonized, that she\nleaned, faint, against the door jamb. “What is it, father?” she gasped.",
        "He did not answer–did not move–sat rigidly on, with that expression\nunchanging, as if it had been fixed there by the sculptor who had made\nthe statue. She tried to go to him, but at the very thought she was\noverwhelmed by such fear as she had not had since she, a child, lay in\nher little bed in the dark, too terrified by the phantoms that beset her\nto cry out or to move. “Father! What is it?” she repeated, then wheeled\nand fled along the hall crying: “Mother! Mother!”",
        "Ellen came hurrying down the stairs.",
        "“It’s father!” cried Adelaide.",
        "Together they went into the back parlor. He was still motionless, with\nthat same frozen yet fiery expression. They went to him, tried to lift\nhim. Ellen dropped the lifeless arm, turned to her daughter. And Adelaide\nsaw into her mother’s inmost heart, saw the tragic lift of one of those\ntremendous emotions, which, by their very coming into a human soul, give\nit the majesty and the mystery of the divine.",
        "“Telephone for Dr. Schulze,” she commanded; then, as Adelaide sped, she\nsaid tenderly to her husband: “Where is the pain? What can I do?”",
        "But he did not answer. And if he could have answered, what could she have\ndone? The pain was in his heart, was the burning agony of remorse for\nhaving done that which he still believed to be right, that which he now\nthought he would give his soul’s salvation for the chance to undo. For,\nas the paralysis began to lock his body fast in its vise, the awful\nthought had for the first time come to him: “When my children know what I\nhave done they will hate me! They will hate me all their lives.”",
        "Dr. Schulze examined him. “Somewhat sooner than I expected,” he muttered.",
        "“How long will it last?” said Ellen.",
        "“Some time–several weeks–months–perhaps.” He would let her learn\ngradually that the paralysis would not relax its grip until it had borne\nhim into the eternal prison and had handed him over to the jailer who\nmakes no deliveries.",
