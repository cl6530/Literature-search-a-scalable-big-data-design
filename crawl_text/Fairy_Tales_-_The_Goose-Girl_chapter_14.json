        "The king of a great land died, and left his queen to take care of\ntheir only child. This child was a daughter, who was very beautiful;\nand her mother loved her dearly, and was very kind to her. And there\nwas a good fairy too, who was fond of the princess, and helped her\nmother to watch over her. When she grew up, she was betrothed to a\nprince who lived a great way off; and as the time drew near for her to\nbe married, she got ready to set off on her journey to his country.\nThen the queen her mother, packed up a great many costly things;\njewels, and gold, and silver; trinkets, fine dresses, and in short\neverything that became a royal bride. And she gave her a waiting-maid\nto ride with her, and give her into the bridegroom’s hands; and each\nhad a horse for the journey. Now the princess’s horse was the fairy’s\ngift, and it was called Falada, and could speak.",
        "When the time came for them to set out, the fairy went into her bed-\nchamber, and took a little knife, and cut off a lock of her hair, and\ngave it to the princess, and said, ’Take care of it, dear child; for\nit is a charm that may be of use to you on the road.’ Then they all\ntook a sorrowful leave of the princess; and she put the lock of hair\ninto her bosom, got upon her horse, and set off on her journey to her\nbridegroom’s kingdom.",
        "One day, as they were riding along by a brook, the princess began to\nfeel very thirsty: and she said to her maid, ’Pray get down, and fetch\nme some water in my golden cup out of yonder brook, for I want to\ndrink.’ ’Nay,’ said the maid, ’if you are thirsty, get off yourself,\nand stoop down by the water and drink; I shall not be your waiting-\nmaid any longer.’ Then she was so thirsty that she got down, and knelt\nover the little brook, and drank; for she was frightened, and dared\nnot bring out her golden cup; and she wept and said, ’Alas! what will\nbecome of me?’ And the lock answered her, and said:",
        " ’Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’",
        "But the princess was very gentle and meek, so she said nothing to her\nmaid’s ill behaviour, but got upon her horse again.",
        "Then all rode farther on their journey, till the day grew so warm, and\nthe sun so scorching, that the bride began to feel very thirsty again;\nand at last, when they came to a river, she forgot her maid’s rude\nspeech, and said, ’Pray get down, and fetch me some water to drink in\nmy golden cup.’ But the maid answered her, and even spoke more\nhaughtily than before: ’Drink if you will, but I shall not be your\nwaiting-maid.’ Then the princess was so thirsty that she got off her\nhorse, and lay down, and held her head over the running stream, and\ncried and said, ’What will become of me?’ And the lock of hair\nanswered her again:",
        " ’Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’",
        "And as she leaned down to drink, the lock of hair fell from her bosom,\nand floated away with the water. Now she was so frightened that she\ndid not see it; but her maid saw it, and was very glad, for she knew\nthe charm; and she saw that the poor bride would be in her power, now\nthat she had lost the hair. So when the bride had done drinking, and\nwould have got upon Falada again, the maid said, ’I shall ride upon\nFalada, and you may have my horse instead’; so she was forced to give\nup her horse, and soon afterwards to take off her royal clothes and\nput on her maid’s shabby ones.",
        "At last, as they drew near the end of their journey, this treacherous\nservant threatened to kill her mistress if she ever told anyone what\nhad happened. But Falada saw it all, and marked it well.",
        "Then the waiting-maid got upon Falada, and the real bride rode upon\nthe other horse, and they went on in this way till at last they came\nto the royal court. There was great joy at their coming, and the\nprince flew to meet them, and lifted the maid from her horse, thinking\nshe was the one who was to be his wife; and she was led upstairs to\nthe royal chamber; but the true princess was told to stay in the court\nbelow.",
        "Now the old king happened just then to have nothing else to do; so he\namused himself by sitting at his kitchen window, looking at what was\ngoing on; and he saw her in the courtyard. As she looked very pretty,\nand too delicate for a waiting-maid, he went up into the royal chamber\nto ask the bride who it was she had brought with her, that was thus\nleft standing in the court below. ’I brought her with me for the sake\nof her company on the road,’ said she; ’pray give the girl some work\nto do, that she may not be idle.’ The old king could not for some time\nthink of any work for her to do; but at last he said, ’I have a lad\nwho takes care of my geese; she may go and help him.’ Now the name of\nthis lad, that the real bride was to help in watching the king’s\ngeese, was Curdken.",
        "But the false bride said to the prince, ’Dear husband, pray do me one\npiece of kindness.’ ’That I will,’ said the prince. ’Then tell one of\nyour slaughterers to cut off the head of the horse I rode upon, for it\nwas very unruly, and plagued me sadly on the road’; but the truth was,\nshe was very much afraid lest Falada should some day or other speak,\nand tell all she had done to the princess. She carried her point, and\nthe faithful Falada was killed; but when the true princess heard of\nit, she wept, and begged the man to nail up Falada’s head against a\nlarge dark gate of the city, through which she had to pass every\nmorning and evening, that there she might still see him sometimes.\nThen the slaughterer said he would do as she wished; and cut off the\nhead, and nailed it up under the dark gate.",
        "Early the next morning, as she and Curdken went out through the gate,\nshe said sorrowfully:",
        " ’Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’",
        "and the head answered:",
        " ’Bride, bride, there thou gangest!\n  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’",
        "Then they went out of the city, and drove the geese on. And when she\ncame to the meadow, she sat down upon a bank there, and let down her\nwaving locks of hair, which were all of pure silver; and when Curdken\nsaw it glitter in the sun, he ran up, and would have pulled some of\nthe locks out, but she cried:",
        " ’Blow, breezes, blow!\n  Let Curdken’s hat go!\n  Blow, breezes, blow!\n  Let him after it go!\n  O’er hills, dales, and rocks,\n  Away be it whirl’d\n  Till the silvery locks\n  Are all comb’d and curl’d!",
        "Then there came a wind, so strong that it blew off Curdken’s hat; and\naway it flew over the hills: and he was forced to turn and run after\nit; till, by the time he came back, she had done combing and curling\nher hair, and had put it up again safe. Then he was very angry and\nsulky, and would not speak to her at all; but they watched the geese\nuntil it grew dark in the evening, and then drove them homewards.",
        "The next morning, as they were going through the dark gate, the poor\ngirl looked up at Falada’s head, and cried:",
        " ’Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’",
        "and the head answered:",
        " ’Bride, bride, there thou gangest!\n  Alas! alas! if they mother knew it,\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’",
        "Then she drove on the geese, and sat down again in the meadow, and\nbegan to comb out her hair as before; and Curdken ran up to her, and\nwanted to take hold of it; but she cried out quickly:",
        " ’Blow, breezes, blow!\n  Let Curdken’s hat go!\n  Blow, breezes, blow!\n  Let him after it go!\n  O’er hills, dales, and rocks,\n  Away be it whirl’d\n  Till the silvery locks\n  Are all comb’d and curl’d!",
        "Then the wind came and blew away his hat; and off it flew a great way,\nover the hills and far away, so that he had to run after it; and when\nhe came back she had bound up her hair again, and all was safe. So\nthey watched the geese till it grew dark.",
        "In the evening, after they came home, Curdken went to the old king,\nand said, ’I cannot have that strange girl to help me to keep the\ngeese any longer.’ ’Why?’ said the king. ’Because, instead of doing\nany good, she does nothing but tease me all day long.’ Then the king\nmade him tell him what had happened. And Curdken said, ’When we go in\nthe morning through the dark gate with our flock of geese, she cries\nand talks with the head of a horse that hangs upon the wall, and says:",
        " ’Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’",
        "and the head answers:",
        " ’Bride, bride, there thou gangest!\n  Alas! alas! if they mother knew it,\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’",
        "And Curdken went on telling the king what had happened upon the meadow\nwhere the geese fed; how his hat was blown away; and how he was forced\nto run after it, and to leave his flock of geese to themselves. But\nthe old king told the boy to go out again the next day: and when\nmorning came, he placed himself behind the dark gate, and heard how\nshe spoke to Falada, and how Falada answered. Then he went into the\nfield, and hid himself in a bush by the meadow’s side; and he soon saw\nwith his own eyes how they drove the flock of geese; and how, after a\nlittle time, she let down her hair that glittered in the sun. And then\nhe heard her say:",
        " ’Blow, breezes, blow!\n  Let Curdken’s hat go!\n  Blow, breezes, blow!\n  Let him after it go!\n  O’er hills, dales, and rocks,\n  Away be it whirl’d\n  Till the silvery locks\n  Are all comb’d and curl’d!",
        "And soon came a gale of wind, and carried away Curdken’s hat, and away\nwent Curdken after it, while the girl went on combing and curling her\nhair. All this the old king saw: so he went home without being seen;\nand when the little goose-girl came back in the evening he called her\naside, and asked her why she did so: but she burst into tears, and\nsaid, ’That I must not tell you or any man, or I shall lose my life.’",
        "But the old king begged so hard, that she had no peace till she had\ntold him all the tale, from beginning to end, word for word. And it\nwas very lucky for her that she did so, for when she had done the king\nordered royal clothes to be put upon her, and gazed on her with\nwonder, she was so beautiful. Then he called his son and told him that\nhe had only a false bride; for that she was merely a waiting-maid,\nwhile the true bride stood by. And the young king rejoiced when he saw\nher beauty, and heard how meek and patient she had been; and without\nsaying anything to the false bride, the king ordered a great feast to\nbe got ready for all his court. The bridegroom sat at the top, with\nthe false princess on one side, and the true one on the other; but\nnobody knew her again, for her beauty was quite dazzling to their\neyes; and she did not seem at all like the little goose-girl, now that\nshe had her brilliant dress on.",
        "When they had eaten and drank, and were very merry, the old king said\nhe would tell them a tale. So he began, and told all the story of the\nprincess, as if it was one that he had once heard; and he asked the\ntrue waiting-maid what she thought ought to be done to anyone who\nwould behave thus. ’Nothing better,’ said this false bride, ’than that\nshe should be thrown into a cask stuck round with sharp nails, and\nthat two white horses should be put to it, and should drag it from\nstreet to street till she was dead.’ ’Thou art she!’ said the old\nking; ’and as thou has judged thyself, so shall it be done to thee.’\nAnd the young king was then married to his true wife, and they reigned\nover the kingdom in peace and happiness all their lives; and the good\nfairy came to see them, and restored the faithful Falada to life\nagain.",
