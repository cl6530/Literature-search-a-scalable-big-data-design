        "Combray at a distance, from a twenty-mile radius, as we used to see it\nfrom the railway when we arrived there every year in Holy Week, was no\nmore than a church epitomising the town, representing it, speaking of it\nand for it to the horizon, and as one drew near, gathering close about its\nlong, dark cloak, sheltering from the wind, on the open plain, as a\nshepherd gathers his sheep, the woolly grey backs of its flocking houses,\nwhich a fragment of its mediaeval ramparts enclosed, here and there, in an\noutline as scrupulously circular as that of a little town in a primitive\npainting. To live in, Combray was a trifle depressing, like its streets,\nwhose houses, built of the blackened stone of the country, fronted with\noutside steps, capped with gables which projected long shadows downwards,\nwere so dark that one had, as soon as the sun began to go down, to draw\nback the curtains in the sitting-room windows; streets with the solemn\nnames of Saints, not a few of whom figured in the history of the early\nlords of Combray, such as the Rue Saint-Hilaire, the Rue Saint-Jacques, in\nwhich my aunt’s house stood, the Rue Sainte-Hildegarde, which ran past her\nrailings, and the Rue du Saint-Esprit, on to which the little garden gate\nopened; and these Combray streets exist in so remote a quarter of my\nmemory, painted in colours so different from those in which the world is\ndecked for me to-day, that in fact one and all of them, and the church\nwhich towered above them in the Square, seem to me now more unsubstantial\nthan the projections of my magic-lantern; while at times I feel that to be\nable to cross the Rue Saint-Hilaire again, to engage a room in the Rue de\nl’Oiseau, in the old hostelry of the Oiseau Flesché, from whose windows in\nthe pavement used to rise a smell of cooking which rises still in my mind,\nnow and then, in the same warm gusts of comfort, would be to secure a\ncontact with the unseen world more marvellously supernatural than it would\nbe to make Golo’s acquaintance and to chat with Geneviève de Brabant.",
        "My grandfather’s cousin–by courtesy my great-aunt–with whom we used to\nstay, was the mother of that aunt Léonie who, since her husband’s (my\nuncle Octave’s) death, had gradually declined to leave, first Combray,\nthen her house in Combray, then her bedroom, and finally her bed; and who\nnow never ’came down,’ but lay perpetually in an indefinite condition of\ngrief, physical exhaustion, illness, obsessions, and religious\nobservances.  Her own room looked out over the Rue Saint-Jacques, which\nran a long way further to end in the Grand-Pré (as distinct from the\nPetit-Pré, a green space in the centre of the town where three streets\nmet) and which, monotonous and grey, with the three high steps of stone\nbefore almost every one of its doors, seemed like a deep furrow cut by\nsome sculptor of gothic images in the very block of stone out of which he\nhad fashioned a Calvary or a Crib. My aunt’s life was now practically\nconfined to two adjoining rooms, in one of which she would rest in the\nafternoon while they, aired the other. They were rooms of that country\norder which (just as in certain climes whole tracts of air or ocean are\nilluminated or scented by myriads of protozoa which we cannot see)\nfascinate our sense of smell with the countless odours springing from\ntheir own special virtues, wisdom, habits, a whole secret system of life,\ninvisible, superabundant and profoundly moral, which their atmosphere\nholds in solution; smells natural enough indeed, and coloured by\ncircumstances as are those of the neighbouring countryside, but already\nhumanised, domesticated, confined, an exquisite, skilful, limpid jelly,\nblending all the fruits of the season which have left the orchard for the\nstore-room, smells changing with the year, but plenishing, domestic\nsmells, which compensate for the sharpness of hoar frost with the sweet\nsavour of warm bread, smells lazy and punctual as a village clock, roving\nsmells, pious smells; rejoicing in a peace which brings only an increase\nof anxiety, and in a prosiness which serves as a deep source of poetry to\nthe stranger who passes through their midst without having lived amongst\nthem. The air of those rooms was saturated with the fine bouquet of a\nsilence so nourishing, so succulent that I could not enter them without a\nsort of greedy enjoyment, particularly on those first mornings, chilly\nstill, of the Easter holidays, when I could taste it more fully, because I\nhad just arrived then at Combray: before I went in to wish my aunt good\nday I would be kept waiting a little time in the outer room, where the\nsun, a wintry sun still, had crept in to warm itself before the fire,\nlighted already between its two brick sides and plastering all the room\nand everything in it with a smell of soot, making the room like one of\nthose great open hearths which one finds in the country, or one of the\ncanopied mantelpieces in old castles under which one sits hoping that in\nthe world outside it is raining or snowing, hoping almost for a\ncatastrophic deluge to add the romance of shelter and security to the\ncomfort of a snug retreat; I would turn to and fro between the prayer-desk\nand the stamped velvet armchairs, each one always draped in its crocheted\nantimacassar, while the fire, baking like a pie the appetising smells with\nwhich the air of the room, was thickly clotted, which the dewy and sunny\nfreshness of the morning had already ’raised’ and started to ’set,’ puffed\nthem and glazed them and fluted them and swelled them into an invisible\nthough not impalpable country cake, an immense puff-pastry, in which,\nbarely waiting to savour the crustier, more delicate, more respectable,\nbut also drier smells of the cupboard, the chest-of-drawers, and the\npatterned wall-paper I always returned with an unconfessed gluttony to\nbury myself in the nondescript, resinous, dull, indigestible, and fruity\nsmell of the flowered quilt.",
        "In the next room I could hear my aunt talking quietly to herself. She\nnever spoke save in low tones, because she believed that there was\nsomething broken in her head and floating loose there, which she might\ndisplace by talking too loud; but she never remained for long, even when\nalone, without saying something, because she believed that it was good for\nher throat, and that by keeping the blood there in circulation it would\nmake less frequent the chokings and other pains to which she was liable;\nbesides, in the life of complete inertia which she led she attached to the\nleast of her sensations an extraordinary importance, endowed them with a\nProtean ubiquity which made it difficult for her to keep them secret, and,\nfailing a confidant to whom she might communicate them, she used to\npromulgate them to herself in an unceasing monologue which was her sole\nform of activity. Unfortunately, having formed the habit of thinking\naloud, she did not always take care to see that there was no one in the\nadjoining room, and I would often hear her saying to herself: “I must not\nforget that I never slept a wink\"–for “never sleeping a wink” was her\ngreat claim to distinction, and one admitted and respected in our\nhousehold vocabulary; in the morning Françoise would not ’call’ her, but\nwould simply ’come to’ her; during the day, when my aunt wished to take a\nnap, we used to say just that she wished to ’be quiet’ or to ’rest’; and\nwhen in conversation she so far forgot herself as to say “what made me\nwake up,” or “I dreamed that,” she would flush and at once correct\nherself.",
        "After waiting a minute, I would go in and kiss her; Françoise would be\nmaking her tea; or, if my aunt were feeling ’upset,’ she would ask instead\nfor her ’tisane,’ and it would be my duty to shake out of the chemist’s\nlittle package on to a plate the amount of lime-blossom required for\ninfusion in boiling water. The drying of the stems had twisted them into a\nfantastic trellis, in whose intervals the pale flowers opened, as though a\npainter had arranged them there, grouping them in the most decorative\nposes. The leaves, which had lost or altered their own appearance, assumed\nthose instead of the most incongruous things imaginable, as though the\ntransparent wings of flies or the blank sides of labels or the petals of\nroses had been collected and pounded, or interwoven as birds weave the\nmaterial for their nests. A thousand trifling little details–the charming\nprodigality of the chemist–details which would have been eliminated from\nan artificial preparation, gave me, like a book in which one is astonished\nto read the name of a person whom one knows, the pleasure of finding that\nthese were indeed real lime-blossoms, like those I had seen, when coming\nfrom the train, in the Avenue de la Gare, altered, but only because they\nwere not imitations but the very same blossoms, which had grown old. And\nas each new character is merely a metamorphosis from something older, in\nthese little grey balls I recognised green buds plucked before their time;\nbut beyond all else the rosy, moony, tender glow which lit up the blossoms\namong the frail forest of stems from which they hung like little golden\nroses–marking, as the radiance upon an old wall still marks the place of\na vanished fresco, the difference between those parts of the tree which\nhad and those which had not been ’in bloom’–shewed me that these were\npetals which, before their flowering-time, the chemist’s package had\nembalmed on warm evenings of spring. That rosy candlelight was still their\ncolour, but half-extinguished and deadened in the diminished life which\nwas now theirs, and which may be called the twilight of a flower.\nPresently my aunt was able to dip in the boiling infusion, in which she\nwould relish the savour of dead or faded blossom, a little madeleine, of\nwhich she would hold out a piece to me when it was sufficiently soft.",
        "At one side of her bed stood a big yellow chest-of-drawers of lemon-wood,\nand a table which served at once as pharmacy and as high altar, on which,\nbeneath a statue of Our Lady and a bottle of Vichy-Célestins, might be\nfound her service-books and her medical prescriptions, everything that she\nneeded for the performance, in bed, of her duties to soul and body, to\nkeep the proper times for pepsin and for vespers. On the other side her\nbed was bounded by the window: she had the street beneath her eyes, and\nwould read in it from morning to night to divert the tedium of her life,\nlike a Persian prince, the daily but immemorial chronicles of Combray,\nwhich she would discuss in detail afterwards with Françoise.",
        "I would not have been five minutes with my aunt before she would send me\naway in case I made her tired. She would hold out for me to kiss her sad\nbrow, pale and lifeless, on which at this early hour she would not yet\nhave arranged the false hair and through which the bones shone like the\npoints of a crown of thorns–or the beads of a rosary, and she would say to\nme: “Now, my poor child, you must go away; go and get ready for mass; and\nif you see Françoise downstairs, tell her not to stay too long amusing\nherself with you; she must come up soon to see if I want anything.”",
        "Françoise, who had been for many years in my aunt’s service and did not at\nthat time suspect that she would one day be transferred entirely to ours,\nwas a little inclined to desert my aunt during the months which we spent\nin her house. There had been in my infancy, before we first went to\nCombray, and when my aunt Léonie used still to spend the winter in Paris\nwith her mother, a time when I knew Françoise so little that on New Year’s\nDay, before going into my great-aunt’s house, my mother put a five-franc\npiece in my hand and said: “Now, be careful. Don’t make any mistake. Wait\nuntil you hear me say ’Good morning, Françoise,’ and I touch your arm\nbefore you give it to her.” No sooner had we arrived in my aunt’s dark\nhall than we saw in the gloom, beneath the frills of a snowy cap as stiff\nand fragile as if it had been made of spun sugar, the concentric waves of\na smile of anticipatory gratitude. It was Françoise, motionless and erect,\nframed in the small doorway of the corridor like the statue of a saint in\nits niche. When we had grown more accustomed to this religious darkness we\ncould discern in her features a disinterested love of all humanity,\nblended with a tender respect for the ’upper classes’ which raised to the\nmost honourable quarter of her heart the hope of receiving her due reward.\nMamma pinched my arm sharply and said in a loud voice: “Good morning,\nFrançoise.” At this signal my fingers parted and I let fall the coin,\nwhich found a receptacle in a confused but outstretched hand. But since we\nhad begun to go to Combray there was no one I knew better than Françoise.\nWe were her favourites, and in the first years at least, while she shewed\nthe same consideration for us as for my aunt, she enjoyed us with a keener\nrelish, because we had, in addition to our dignity as part of ’the family’\n(for she had for those invisible bonds by which community of blood unites\nthe members of a family as much respect as any Greek tragedian), the fresh\ncharm of not being her customary employers.  And so with what joy would\nshe welcome us, with what sorrow complain that the weather was still so\nbad for us, on the day of our arrival, just before Easter, when there was\noften an icy wind; while Mamma inquired after her daughter and her\nnephews, and if her grandson was good-looking, and what they were going to\nmake of him, and whether he took after his granny.",
        "Later, when no one else was in the room, Mamma, who knew that Françoise\nwas still mourning for her parents, who had been dead for years, would\nspeak of them kindly, asking her endless little questions about them and\ntheir lives.",
        "She had guessed that Françoise was not over-fond of her son-in-law, and\nthat he spoiled the pleasure she found in visiting her daughter, as the\ntwo could not talk so freely when he was there. And so one day, when\nFrançoise was going to their house, some miles from Combray, Mamma said to\nher, with a smile: “Tell me, Françoise, if Julien has had to go away, and\nyou have Marguerite to yourself all day, you will be very sorry, but will\nmake the best of it, won’t you?”",
        "And Françoise answered, laughing: “Madame knows everything; Madame is\nworse than the X-rays” (she pronounced ’x’ with an affectation of\ndifficulty and with a smile in deprecation of her, an unlettered woman’s,\ndaring to employ a scientific term) “they brought here for Mme.  Octave,\nwhich see what is in your heart\"–and she went off, disturbed that anyone\nshould be caring about her, perhaps anxious that we should not see her in\ntears: Mamma was the first person who had given her the pleasure of\nfeeling that her peasant existence, with its simple joys and sorrows,\nmight offer some interest, might be a source of grief or pleasure to some\none other than herself.",
        "My aunt resigned herself to doing without Françoise to some extent during\nour visits, knowing how much my mother appreciated the services of so\nactive and intelligent a maid, one who looked as smart at five o’clock in\nthe morning in her kitchen, under a cap whose stiff and dazzling frills\nseemed to be made of porcelain, as when dressed for churchgoing; who did\neverything in the right way, who toiled like a horse, whether she was well\nor ill, but without noise, without the appearance of doing anything; the\nonly one of my aunt’s maids who when Mamma asked for hot water or black\ncoffee would bring them actually boiling; she was one of those servants\nwho in a household seem least satisfactory, at first, to a stranger,\ndoubtless because they take no pains to make a conquest of him and shew\nhim no special attention, knowing very well that they have no real need of\nhim, that he will cease to be invited to the house sooner than they will\nbe dismissed from it; who, on the other hand, cling with most fidelity to\nthose masters and mistresses who have tested and proved their real\ncapacity, and do not look for that superficial responsiveness, that\nslavish affability, which may impress a stranger favourably, but often\nconceals an utter barrenness of spirit in which no amount of training can\nproduce the least trace of individuality.",
        "When Françoise, having seen that my parents had everything they required,\nfirst went upstairs again to give my aunt her pepsin and to find out from\nher what she would take for luncheon, very few mornings pased but she was\ncalled upon to give an opinion, or to furnish an explanation, in regard to\nsome important event.",
        "“Just fancy, Françoise, Mme. Goupil went by more than a quarter of an hour\nlate to fetch her sister: if she loses any more time on the way I should\nnot be at all surprised if she got in after the Elevation.”",
        "“Well, there’d be nothing wonderful in that,” would be the answer. Or:",
        "“Françoise, if you had come in five minutes ago, you would have seen Mme.\nImbert go past with some asparagus twice the size of what mother Callot\nhas: do try to find out from her cook where she got them. You know you’ve\nbeen putting asparagus in all your sauces this spring; you might be able\nto get some like these for our visitors.”",
        "“I shouldn’t be surprised if they came from the Curé’s,” Françoise would\nsay, and:",
        "“I’m sure you wouldn’t, my poor Françoise,” my aunt would reply, raising\nher shoulders. “From the Curé’s, indeed! You know quite well that he can\nnever grow anything but wretched little twigs of asparagus, not asparagus\nat all. I tell you these ones were as thick as my arm. Not your arm, of\ncourse, but my-poor arm, which has grown so much thinner again this year.\"\nOr:",
        "“Françoise, didn’t you hear that bell just now! It split my head.”",
        "“No, Mme. Octave.”",
        "“Ah, poor girl, your skull must be very thick; you may thank God for that.\nIt was Maguelone come to fetch Dr. Piperaud. He came out with her at once\nand they went off along the Rue de l’Oiseau. There must be some child\nill.”",
        "“Oh dear, dear; the poor little creature!” would come with a sigh from\nFrançoise, who could not hear of any calamity befalling a person unknown\nto her, even in some distant part of the world, without beginning to\nlament. Or:",
        "“Françoise, for whom did they toll the passing-bell just now? Oh dear, of\ncourse, it would be for Mme. Rousseau. And to think that I had forgotten\nthat she passed away the other night. Indeed, it is time the Lord called\nme home too; I don’t know what has become of my head since I lost my poor\nOctave. But I am wasting your time, my good girl.”",
        "“Indeed no, Mme. Octave, my time is not so precious; whoever made our time\ndidn’t sell it to us. I am just going to see that my fire hasn’t gone\nout.”",
        "In this way Françoise and my aunt made a critical valuation between them,\nin the course of these morning sessions, of the earliest happenings of the\nday. But sometimes these happenings assumed so mysterious or so alarming\nan air that my aunt felt she could not wait until it was time for\nFrançoise to come upstairs, and then a formidable and quadruple peal would\nresound through the house.",
        "“But, Mme. Octave, it is not time for your pepsin,” Françoise would begin.\n“Are you feeling faint?”",
        "“No, thank you, Françoise,” my aunt would reply, “that is to say, yes; for\nyou know well that there is very seldom a time when I don’t feel faint;\none day I shall pass away like Mme. Rousseau, before I know where I am;\nbut that is not why I rang. Would you believe that I have just seen, as\nplainly as I see you, Mme. Goupil with a little girl I didn’t know at all.\nRun and get a pennyworth of salt from Camus. It’s not often that Théodore\ncan’t tell you who a person is.”",
        "“But that must be M. Pupin’s daughter,” Françoise would say, preferring to\nstick to an immediate explanation, since she had been perhaps twice\nalready into Camus’s shop that morning.",
        "“M. Pupin’s daughter! Oh, that’s a likely story, my poor Françoise.  Do\nyou think I should not have recognised M. Pupin’s daughter!”",
        "“But I don’t mean the big one, Mme. Octave; I mean the little girl, he one\nwho goes to school at Jouy. I seem to have seen her once already his\nmorning.”",
        "“Oh, if that’s what it is!” my aunt would say, “she must have come over\nfor the holidays. Yes, that is it. No need to ask, she will have come over\nfor the holidays. But then we shall soon see Mme. Sazerat come along and\nring her sister’s door-bell, for her luncheon. That will be it! I saw the\nboy from Galopin’s go by with a tart. You will see that the tart was for\nMme. Goupil.”",
        "“Once Mme. Goupil has anyone in the house, Mme. Octave, you won’t be long\nin seeing all her folk going in to their luncheon there, for it’s not so\nearly as it was,” would be the answer, for Françoise, who was anxious to\nretire downstairs to look after our own meal, was not sorry to leave my\naunt with the prospect of such a distraction.",
        "“Oh! not before midday!” my aunt would reply in a tone of resignation,\ndarting an uneasy glance at the clock, but stealthily, so as not to let it\nbe seen that she, who had renounced all earthly joys, yet found a keen\nsatisfaction in learning that Mme. Goupil was expecting company to\nluncheon, though, alas, she must wait a little more than an hour still\nbefore enjoying the spectacle. “And it will come in the middle of my\nluncheon!” she would murmur to herself. Her luncheon was such a\ndistraction in itself that she did not like any other to come at the same\ntime.  “At least, you will not forget to give me my creamed eggs on one of\nthe flat plates?” These were the only plates which had pictures on them\nand my aunt used to amuse herself at every meal by reading the description\non whichever might have been sent up to her. She would put on her\nspectacles and spell out: “Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,” “Aladdin, or\nthe Wonderful Lamp,” and smile, and say “Very good indeed.”",
        "“I may as well go across to Camus...” Françoise would hazard, seeing that\nmy aunt had no longer any intention of sending her there.",
        "“No, no; it’s not worth while now; it’s certain to be the Pupin girl.  My\npoor Françoise, I am sorry to have made you come upstairs for nothing.”",
        "But it was not for nothing, as my aunt well knew, that she had rung for\nFrançoise, since at Combray a person whom one ’didn’t know at all’ was as\nincredible a being as any mythological deity, and it was apt to be\nforgotten that after each occasion on which there had appeared in the Rue\ndu Saint-Esprit or in the Square one of these bewildering phenomena,\ncareful and exhaustive researches had invariably reduced the fabulous\nmonster to the proportions of a person whom one ’did know,’ either\npersonally or in the abstract, in his or her civil status as being more or\nless closely related to some family in Combray. It would turn out to be\nMme.  Sauton’s son discharged from the army, or the Abbé Perdreau’s niece\ncome home from her convent, or the Curé’s brother, a tax-collector at\nChâteaudun, who had just retired on a pension or had come over to Combray\nfor the holidays. On first noticing them you have been impressed by the\nthought that there might be in Combray people whom you ’didn’t know at\nall,’ simply because, you had failed to recognise or identify them at\nonce. And yet long beforehand Mme. Sauton and the Curé had given warning\nthat they expected their ’strangers.’ In the evening, when I came in and\nwent upstairs to tell my aunt the incidents of our walk, if I was rash\nenough to say to her that we had passed, near the Pont-Vieux, a man whom\nmy grandfather didn’t know:",
        "“A man grandfather didn’t know at all!” she would exclaim. “That’s a\nlikely story.” None the less, she would be a little disturbed by the news,\nshe would wish to have the details correctly, and so my grandfather would\nbe summoned. “Who can it have been that you passed near the Pont-Vieux,\nuncle? A man you didn’t know at all?”",
        "“Why, of course I did,” my grandfather would answer; “it was Prosper, Mme.\nBouilleboeuf’s gardener’s brother.”",
        "“Ah, well!” my aunt would say, calm again but slightly flushed still; “and\nthe boy told me that you had passed a man you didn’t know at all!” After\nwhich I would be warned to be more careful of what I said, and not to\nupset my aunt so by thoughtless remarks. Everyone was so well known in\nCombray, animals as well as people, that if my aunt had happened to see a\ndog go by which she ’didn’t know at all’ she would think about it\nincessantly, devoting to the solution of the incomprehensible problem all\nher inductive talent and her leisure hours.",
        "“That will be Mme. Sazerat’s dog,” Françoise would suggest, without any\nreal conviction, but in the hope of peace, and so that my aunt should not\n’split her head.’",
        "“As if I didn’t know Mme. Sazerat’s dog!\"–for my aunt’s critical mind\nwould not so easily admit any fresh fact.",
        "“Ah, but that will be the new dog M. Galopin has brought her from\nLisieux.”",
        "“Oh, if that’s what it is!”",
        "“It seems, it’s a most engaging animal,” Françoise would go on, having got\nthe story from Théodore, “as clever as a Christian, always in a good\ntemper, always friendly, always everything that’s nice. It’s not often you\nsee an animal so well-behaved at that age. Mme. Octave, it’s high time I\nleft you; I can’t afford to stay here amusing myself; look, it’s nearly\nten o’clock and my fire not lighted yet, and I’ve still to dress the\nasparagus.”",
        "“What, Françoise, more asparagus! It’s a regular disease of asparagus you\nhave got this year: you will make our Parisians sick of it.”",
        "“No, no, Madame Octave, they like it well enough. They’ll be coming back\nfrom church soon as hungry as hunters, and they won’t eat it out of the\nback of their spoons, you’ll see.”",
        "“Church! why, they must be there now; you’d better not lose any time.  Go\nand look after your luncheon.”",
        "While my aunt gossiped on in this way with Françoise I would have\naccompanied my parents to mass. How I loved it: how clearly I can see it\nstill, our church at Combray! The old porch by which we went in, black,\nand full of holes as a cullender, was worn out of shape and deeply\nfurrowed at the sides (as also was the holy water stoup to which it led\nus) just as if the gentle grazing touch of the cloaks of peasant-women\ngoing into the church, and of their fingers dipping into the water, had\nmanaged by agelong repetition to acquire a destructive force, to impress\nitself on the stone, to carve ruts in it like those made by cart-wheels\nupon stone gate-posts against which they are driven every day. Its\nmemorial stones, beneath which the noble dust of the Abbots of Combray,\nwho were buried there, furnished the choir with a sort of spiritual\npavement, were themselves no longer hard and lifeless matter, for time had\nsoftened and sweetened them, and had made them melt like honey and flow\nbeyond their proper margins, either surging out in a milky, frothing wave,\nwashing from its place a florid gothic capital, drowning the white violets\nof the marble floor; or else reabsorbed into their limits, contracting\nstill further a crabbed Latin inscription, bringing a fresh touch of\nfantasy into the arrangement of its curtailed characters, closing together\ntwo letters of some word of which the rest were disproportionately\nscattered. Its windows were never so brilliant as on days when the sun\nscarcely shone, so that if it was dull outside you might be certain of\nfine weather in church.  One of them was filled from top to bottom by a\nsolitary figure, like the king on a playing-card, who lived up there\nbeneath his canopy of stone, between earth and heaven; and in the blue\nlight of its slanting shadow, on weekdays sometimes, at noon, when there\nwas no service (at one of those rare moments when the airy, empty church,\nmore human somehow and more luxurious with the sun shewing off all its\nrich furnishings, seemed to have almost a habitable air, like the\nhall–all sculptured stone and painted glass–of some mediaeval mansion),\nyou might see Mme.  Sazerat kneel for an instant, laying down on the chair\nbeside her own a neatly corded parcel of little cakes which she had just\nbought at the baker’s and was taking home for her luncheon. In another, a\nmountain of rosy snow, at whose foot a battle was being fought, seemed to\nhave frozen the window also, which it swelled and distorted with its\ncloudy sleet, like a pane to which snowflakes have drifted and clung, but\nflakes illumined by a sunrise–the same, doubtless, which purpled the\nreredos of the altar with tints so fresh that they seemed rather to be\nthrown on it for a moment by a light shining from outside and shortly to\nbe extinguished than painted and permanently fastened on the stone. And\nall of them were so old that you could see, here and there, their silvery\nantiquity sparkling with the dust of centuries and shewing in its\nthreadbare brilliance the very cords of their lovely tapestry of glass.\nThere was one among them which was a tall panel composed of a hundred\nlittle rectangular windows, of blue principally, like a great game of\npatience of the kind planned to beguile King Charles VI; but, either\nbecause a ray of sunlight had gleamed through it or because my own\nshifting vision had drawn across the window, whose colours died away and\nwere rekindled by turns, a rare and transient fire–the next instant it\nhad taken on all the iridescence of a peacock’s tail, then shook and\nwavered in a flaming and fantastic shower, distilled and dropping from the\ngroin of the dark and rocky vault down the moist walls, as though it were\nalong the bed of some rainbow grotto of sinuous stalactites that I was\nfollowing my parents, who marched before me, their prayer-books clasped in\ntheir hands; a moment later the little lozenge windows had put on the deep\ntransparence, the unbreakable hardness of sapphires clustered on some\nenormous breastplate; but beyond which could be distinguished, dearer than\nall such treasures, a fleeting smile from the sun, which could be seen and\nfelt as well here, in the blue and gentle flood in which it washed the\nmasonry, as on the pavement of the Square or the straw of the\nmarket-place; and even on our first Sundays, when we came down before\nEaster, it would console me for the blackness and bareness of the earth\noutside by making burst into blossom, as in some springtime in old history\namong the heirs of Saint Louis, this dazzling and gilded carpet of\nforget-me-nots in glass.",
        "Two tapestries of high warp represented the coronation of Esther (in which\ntradition would have it that the weaver had given to Ahasuerus the\nfeatures of one of the kings of France and to Esther those of a lady of\nGuermantes whose lover he had been); their colours had melted into one\nanother, so as to add expression, relief, light to the pictures. A touch\nof red over the lips of Esther had strayed beyond their outline; the\nyellow on her dress was spread with such unctuous plumpness as to have\nacquired a kind of solidity, and stood boldly out from the receding\natmosphere; while the green of the trees, which was still bright in Silk\nand wool among the lower parts of the panel, but had quite ’gone’ at the\ntop, separated in a paler scheme, above the dark trunks, the yellowing\nupper branches, tanned and half-obliterated by the sharp though sidelong\nrays of an invisible sun. All these things and, still more than these, the\ntreasures which had come to the church from personages who to me were\nalmost legendary figures (such as the golden cross wrought, it was said,\nby Saint Eloi and presented by Dagobert, and the tomb of the sons of Louis\nthe Germanic in porphyry and enamelled copper), because of which I used to\ngo forward into the church when we were making our way to our chairs as\ninto a fairy-haunted valley, where the rustic sees with amazement on a\nrock, a tree, a marsh, the tangible proofs of the little people’s\nsupernatural passage–all these things made of the church for me something\nentirely different from the rest of the town; a building which occupied,\nso to speak, four dimensions of space–the name of the fourth being\nTime–which had sailed the centuries with that old nave, where bay after\nbay, chapel after chapel, seemed to stretch across and hold down and\nconquer not merely a few yards of soil, but each successive epoch from\nwhich the whole building had emerged triumphant, hiding the rugged\nbarbarities of the eleventh century in the thickness of its walls, through\nwhich nothing could be seen of the heavy arches, long stopped and blinded\nwith coarse blocks of ashlar, except where, near the porch, a deep groove\nwas furrowed into one wall by the tower-stair; and even there the\nbarbarity was veiled by the graceful gothic arcade which pressed\ncoquettishly upon it, like a row of grown-up sisters who, to hide him from\nthe eyes of strangers, arrange themselves smilingly in front of a\ncountrified, unmannerly and ill-dressed younger brother; rearing into the\nsky above the Square a tower which had looked down upon Saint Louis, and\nseemed to behold him still; and thrusting down with its crypt into the\nblackness of a Merovingian night, through which, guiding us with groping\nfinger-tips beneath the shadowy vault, ribbed strongly as an immense bat’s\nwing of stone, Théodore or his sister would light up for us with a candle\nthe tomb of Sigebert’s little daughter, in which a deep hole, like the bed\nof a fossil, had been bored, or so it was said, “by a crystal lamp which,\non the night when the Frankish princess was murdered, had left, of its own\naccord, the golden chains by which it was suspended where the apse is\nto-day and with neither the crystal broken nor the light extinguished had\nburied itself in the stone, through which it had gently forced its way.”",
        "And then the apse of Combray: what am I to say of that? It was so coarse,\nso devoid of artistic beauty, even of the religious spirit. From outside,\nsince the street crossing which it commanded was on a lower level, its\ngreat wall was thrust upwards from a basement of unfaced ashlar, jagged\nwith flints, in all of which there was nothing particularly\necclesiastical; the windows seemed to have been pierced at an abnormal\nheight, and its whole appearance was that of a prison wall rather than of\na church. And certainly in later years, were I to recall all the glorious\napses that I had seen, it would never enter my mind to compare with any\none of them the apse of Combray. Only, one day, turning out of a little\nstreet in some country town, I came upon three alley-ways that converged,\nand facing them an old wall, rubbed, worn, crumbling, and unusually high;\nwith windows pierced in it far overhead and the same asymmetrical\nappearance as the apse of Combray. And at that moment I did not say to\nmyself, as at Chartres I might have done or at Rheims, with what strength\nthe religious feeling had been expressed in its construction, but\ninstinctively I exclaimed “The Church!”",
        "The church! A dear, familiar friend; close pressed in the Rue\nSaint-Hilaire, upon which its north door opened, by its two neighbours,\nMme.  Loiseau’s house and the pharmacy of M. Rapin, against which its\nwalls rested without interspace; a simple citizen of Combray, who might\nhave had her number in the street had the streets of Combray borne\nnumbers, and at whose door one felt that the postman ought to stop on his\nmorning rounds, before going into Mme. Loiseau’s and after leaving M.\nRapin’s, there existed, for all that, between the church and everything in\nCombray that was not the church a clear line of demarcation which I have\nnever succeeded in eliminating from my mind. In vain might Mme. Loiseau\ndeck her window-sills with fuchsias, which developed the bad habit of\nletting their branches trail at all times and in all directions, head\ndownwards, and whose flowers had no more important business, when they\nwere big enough to taste the joys of life, than to go and cool their\npurple, congested cheeks against the dark front of the church; to me such\nconduct sanctified the fuchsias not at all; between the flowers and the\nblackened stones towards which they leaned, if my eyes could discern no\ninterval, my mind preserved the impression of an abyss.",
        "From a long way off one could distinguish and identify the steeple of\nSaint-Hilaire inscribing its unforgettable form upon a horizon beneath\nwhich Combray had not yet appeared; when from the train which brought us\ndown from Paris at Easter-time my father caught sight of it, as it slipped\ninto every fold of the sky in turn, its little iron cock veering\ncontinually in all directions, he would say: “Come, get your wraps\ntogether, we are there.” And on one of the longest walks we ever took from\nCombray there was a spot where the narrow road emerged suddenly on to an\nimmense plain, closed at the horizon by strips of forest over which rose\nand stood alone the fine point of Saint-Hilaire’s steeple, but so\nsharpened and so pink that it seemed to be no more than sketched on the\nsky by the finger-nail of a painter anxious to give to such a landscape,\nto so pure a piece of ’nature,’ this little sign of art, this single\nindication of human existence. As one drew near it and could make out the\nremains of the square tower, half in ruins, which still stood by its side,\nthough without rivalling it in height, one was struck, first of all, by\nthe tone, reddish and sombre, of its stones; and on a misty morning in\nautumn one would have called it, to see it rising above the violet\nthunder-cloud of the vineyards, a ruin of purple, almost the colour of the\nwild vine.",
        "Often in the Square, as we came home, my grandmother would make me stop to\nlook up at it. From the tower windows, placed two and two, one pair above\nanother, with that right and original proportion in their spacing to which\nnot only human faces owe their beauty and dignity, it released, it let\nfall at regular intervals flights of jackdaws which for a little while\nwould wheel and caw, as though the ancient stones which allowed them to\nsport thus and never seemed to see them, becoming of a sudden\nuninhabitable and discharging some infinitely disturbing element, had\nstruck them and driven them forth. Then after patterning everywhere the\nviolet velvet of the evening air, abruptly soothed, they would return and\nbe absorbed in the tower, deadly no longer but benignant, some perching\nhere and there (not seeming to move, but snapping, perhaps, and swallowing\nsome passing insect) on the points of turrets, as a seagull perches, with\nan angler’s immobility, on the crest of a wave. Without quite knowing why,\nmy grandmother found in the steeple of Saint-Hilaire that absence of\nvulgarity, pretension, and meanness which made her love–and deem rich in\nbeneficent influences–nature itself, when the hand of man had not, as did\nmy great-aunt’s gardener, trimmed it, and the works of genius. And\ncertainly every part one saw of the church served to distinguish the whole\nfrom any other building by a kind of general feeling which pervaded it,\nbut it was in the steeple that the church seemed to display a\nconsciousness of itself, to affirm its individual and responsible\nexistence.  It was the steeple which spoke for the church. I think, too,\nthat in a confused way my grandmother found in the steeple of Combray what\nshe prized above anything else in the world, namely, a natural air and an\nair of distinction. Ignorant of architecture, she would say:",
        "“My dears, laugh at me if you like; it is not conventionally beautiful,\nbut there is something in its quaint old face which pleases me. If it\ncould play the piano, I am sure it would really play.” And when she\ngazed on it, when her eyes followed the gentle tension, the fervent\ninclination of its stony slopes which drew together as they rose, like\nhands joined in prayer, she would absorb herself so utterly in the\noutpouring of the spire that her gaze seemed to leap upwards with it; her\nlips at the same time curving in a friendly smile for the worn old stones\nof which the setting sun now illumined no more than the topmost pinnacles,\nwhich, at the point where they entered that zone of sunlight and were\nsoftened and sweetened by it, seemed to have mounted suddenly far higher,\nto have become truly remote, like a song whose singer breaks into\nfalsetto, an octave above the accompanying air.",
        "It was the steeple of Saint-Hilaire which shaped and crowned and\nconsecrated every occupation, every hour of the day, every point of view\nin the town. From my bedroom window I could discern no more than its base,\nwhich had been freshly covered with slates; but when on Sundays I saw\nthese, in the hot light of a summer morning, blaze like a black sun I\nwould say to myself: “Good heavens! nine o’clock! I must get ready for\nmass at once if I am to have time to go in and kiss aunt Léonie first,\"\nand I would know exactly what was the colour of the sunlight upon the\nSquare, I could feel the heat and dust of the market, the shade behind the\nblinds of the shop into which Mamma would perhaps go on her way to mass,\npenetrating its odour of unbleached calico, to purchase a handkerchief or\nsomething, of which the draper himself would let her see what he had,\nbowing from the waist: who, having made everything ready for shutting up,\nhad just gone into the back shop to put on his Sunday coat and to wash his\nhands, which it was his habit, every few minutes and even on the saddest\noccasions, to rub one against the other with an air of enterprise,\ncunning, and success.",
        "And again, after mass, when we looked in to tell Théodore to bring a\nlarger loaf than usual because our cousins had taken advantage of the fine\nweather to come over from Thiberzy for luncheon, we had in front of us the\nsteeple, which, baked and brown itself like a larger loaf still of ’holy\nbread,’ with flakes and sticky drops on it of sunlight, pricked its sharp\npoint into the blue sky. And in the evening, as I came in from my walk and\nthought of the approaching moment when I must say good night to my mother\nand see her no more, the steeple was by contrast so kindly, there at the\nclose of day, that I would imagine it as being laid, like a brown velvet\ncushion, against–as being thrust into the pallid sky which had yielded\nbeneath its pressure, had sunk slightly so as to make room for it, and had\ncorrespondingly risen on either side; while the cries of the birds\nwheeling to and fro about it seemed to intensify its silence, to elongate\nits spire still further, and to invest it with some quality beyond the\npower of words.",
        "Even when our errands lay in places behind the church, from which it could\nnot be seen, the view seemed always to have been composed with reference\nto the steeple, which would stand up, now here, now there, among the\nhouses, and was perhaps even more affecting when it appeared thus without\nthe church. And, indeed, there are many others which look best when seen\nin this way, and I can call to mind vignettes of housetops with\nsurmounting steeples in quite another category of art than those formed by\nthe dreary streets of Combray. I shall never forget, in a quaint Norman\ntown not far from Balbec, two charming eighteenth-century houses, dear to\nme and venerable for many reasons, between which, when one looks up at\nthem from a fine garden which descends in terraces to the river, the\ngothic spire of a church (itself hidden by the houses) soars into the sky\nwith the effect of crowning and completing their fronts, but in a material\nso different, so precious, so beringed, so rosy, so polished, that it is\nat once seen to be no more a part of them than would be a part of two\npretty pebbles lying side by side, between which it had been washed on the\nbeach, the purple, crinkled spire of some sea-shell spun out into a turret\nand gay with glossy colour. Even in Paris, in one of the ugliest parts of\nthe town, I know a window from which one can see across a first, a second,\nand even a third layer of jumbled roofs, street beyond street, a violet\nbell, sometimes ruddy, sometimes too, in the finest ’prints’ which the\natmosphere makes of it, of an ashy solution of black; which is, in fact,\nnothing else than the dome of Saint-Augustin, and which imparts to this\nview of Paris the character of some of the Piranesi views of Rome. But\nsince into none of these little etchings, whatever the taste my memory may\nhave been able to bring to their execution, was it able to contribute an\nelement I have long lost, the feeling which makes us not merely regard a\nthing as a spectacle, but believe in it as in a creature without parallel,\nso none of them keeps in dependence on it a whole section of my inmost\nlife as does the memory of those aspects of the steeple of Combray from\nthe streets behind the church. Whether one saw it at five o’clock when\ngoing to call for letters at the post-office, some doors away from one, on\nthe left, raising abruptly with its isolated peak the ridge of housetops;\nor again, when one had to go in and ask for news of Mme. Sazerat, one’s\neyes followed the line where it ran low again beyond the farther,\ndescending slope, and one knew that it would be the second turning after\nthe steeple; or yet again, if pressing further afield one went to the\nstation, one saw it obliquely, shewing in profile fresh angles and\nsurfaces, like a solid body surprised at some unknown point in its\nrevolution; or, from the banks of the Vivonne, the apse, drawn muscularly\ntogether and heightened in perspective, seemed to spring upwards with the\neffort which the steeple made to hurl its spire-point into the heart of\nheaven: it was always to the steeple that one must return, always it which\ndominated everything else, summing up the houses with an unexpected\npinnacle, raised before me like the Finger of God, Whose Body might have\nbeen concealed below among the crowd of human bodies without fear of my\nconfounding It, for that reason, with them. And so even to-day in any\nlarge provincial town, or in a quarter of Paris which I do not know well,\nif a passer-by who is ’putting me on the right road’ shews me from afar,\nas a point to aim at, some belfry of a hospital, or a convent steeple\nlifting the peak of its ecclesiastical cap at the corner of the street\nwhich I am to take, my memory need only find in it some dim resemblance to\nthat dear and vanished outline, and the passer-by, should he turn round to\nmake sure that I have not gone astray, would see me, to his astonishment,\noblivious of the walk that I had planned to take or the place where I was\nobliged to call, standing still on the spot, before that steeple, for\nhours on end, motionless, trying to remember, feeling deep within myself a\ntract of soil reclaimed from the waters of Lethe slowly drying until the\nbuildings rise on it again; and then no doubt, and then more uneasily than\nwhen, just now, I asked him for a direction, I will seek my way again, I\nwill turn a corner... but... the goal is in my heart...",
        "On our way home from mass we would often meet M. Legrandin, who, detained\nin Paris by his professional duties as an engineer, could only (except in\nthe regular holiday seasons) visit his home at Combray between Saturday\nevenings and Monday mornings. He was one of that class of men who, apart\nfrom a scientific career in which they may well have proved brilliantly\nsuccessful, have acquired an entirely different kind of culture, literary\nor artistic, of which they make no use in the specialised work of their\nprofession, but by which their conversation profits. More ’literary’ than\nmany ’men of letters’ (we were not aware at this period that M. Legrandin\nhad a distinct reputation as a writer, and so were greatly astonished to\nfind that a well-known composer had set some verses of his to music),\nendowed with a greater ease in execution than many painters, they imagine\nthat the life they are obliged to lead is not that for which they are\nreally fitted, and they bring to their regular occupations either a\nfantastic indifference or a sustained and lofty application, scornful,\nbitter, and conscientious. Tall, with a good figure, a fine, thoughtful\nface, drooping fair moustaches, a look of disillusionment in his blue\neyes, an almost exaggerated refinement of courtesy; a talker such as we\nhad never heard; he was in the sight of my family, who never ceased to\nquote him as an example, the very pattern of a gentleman, who took life in\nthe noblest and most delicate manner. My grandmother alone found fault\nwith him for speaking a little too well, a little too much like a book,\nfor not using a vocabulary as natural as his loosely knotted Lavallière\nneckties, his short, straight, almost schoolboyish coat. She was\nastonished, too, at the furious invective which he was always launching at\nthe aristocracy, at fashionable life, and ’snobbishness’–\"undoubtedly,\"\nhe would say, “the sin of which Saint Paul is thinking when he speaks of\nthe sin for which there is no forgiveness.”",
        "Worldly ambition was a thing which my grandmother was so little capable of\nfeeling, or indeed of understanding, that it seemed to her futile to apply\nso much heat to its condemnation. Besides, she thought it in not very good\ntaste that M. Legrandin, whose sister was married to a country gentleman\nof Lower Normandy near Balbec, should deliver himself of such violent\nattacks upon the nobles, going so far as to blame the Revolution for not\nhaving guillotined them all.",
        "“Well met, my friends!” he would say as he came towards us. “You are lucky\nto spend so much time here; to-morrow I have to go back to Paris, to\nsqueeze back into my niche.",
        "“Oh, I admit,” he went on, with his own peculiar smile, gently ironical,\ndisillusioned and vague, “I have every useless thing in the world in my\nhouse there. The only thing wanting is the necessary thing, a great patch\nof open sky like this. Always try to keep a patch of sky above your life,\nlittle boy,” he added, turning to me. “You have a soul in you of rare\nquality, an artist’s nature; never let it starve for lack of what it\nneeds.”",
        "When, on our reaching the house, my aunt would send to ask us whether Mme.\nGoupil had indeed arrived late for mass, not one of us could inform her.\nInstead, we increased her anxiety by telling her that there was a painter\nat work in the church copying the window of Gilbert the Bad.  Françoise\nwas at once dispatched to the grocer’s, but returned empty-handed owing to\nthe absence of Théodore, whose dual profession of choirman, with a part in\nthe maintenance of the fabric, and of grocer’s assistant gave him not only\nrelations with all sections of society, but an encyclopaedic knowledge of\ntheir affairs.",
        "“Ah!” my aunt would sigh, “I wish it were time for Eulalie to come.  She\nis really the only person who will be able to tell me.”",
        "Eulalie was a limping, energetic, deaf spinster who had ’retired’ after\nthe death of Mme. de la Bretonnerie, with whom she had been in service\nfrom her childhood, and had then taken a room beside the church, from\nwhich she would incessantly emerge, either to attend some service, or,\nwhen there was no service, to say a prayer by herself or to give Théodore\na hand; the rest of her time she spent in visiting sick persons like my\naunt Léonie, to whom she would relate everything that had occurred at mass\nor vespers. She was not above adding occasional pocket-money to the little\nincome which was found for her by the family of her old employers by going\nfrom time to time to look after the Curé’s linen, or that of some other\nperson of note in the clerical world of Combray. Above a mantle of black\ncloth she wore a little white coif that seemed almost to attach her to\nsome Order, and an infirmity of the skin had stained part of her cheeks\nand her crooked nose the bright red colour of balsam. Her visits were the\none great distraction in the life of my aunt Léonie, who now saw hardly\nanyone else, except the reverend Curé. My aunt had by degrees erased every\nother visitor’s name from her list, because they all committed the fatal\nerror, in her eyes, of falling into one or other of the two categories of\npeople she most detested. One group, the worse of the two, and the one of\nwhich she rid herself first, consisted of those who advised her not to\ntake so much care of herself, and preached (even if only negatively and\nwith no outward signs beyond an occasional disapproving silence or\ndoubting smile) the subversive doctrine that a sharp walk in the sun and a\ngood red beefsteak would do her more good (her, who had had two dreadful\nsips of Vichy water on her stomach for fourteen hours!) than all her\nmedicine bottles and her bed. The other category was composed of people\nwho appeared to believe that she was more seriously ill than she thought,\nin fact that she was as seriously ill as she said. And so none of those\nwhom she had allowed upstairs to her room, after considerable\nhesitation and at Franchise’s urgent request, and who in the course of\ntheir visit had shewn how unworthy they were of the honour which had been\ndone them by venturing a timid: “Don’t you think that if you were just to\nstir out a little on really fine days...?” or who, on the other hand, when\nshe said to them: “I am very low, very low; nearing the end, dear\nfriends!” had replied: “Ah, yes, when one has no strength left! Still, you\nmay last a while yet\"; each party alike might be certain that her doors\nwould never open to them again. And if Françoise was amused by the look of\nconsternation on my aunt’s face whenever she saw, from her bed, any of\nthese people in the Rue du Saint-Esprit, who looked as if they were coming\nto see her, or heard her own door-bell ring, she would laugh far more\nheartily, as at a clever trick, at my aunt’s devices (which never failed)\nfor having them sent away, and at their look of discomfiture when they had\nto turn back without having seen her; and would be filled with secret\nadmiration for her mistress, whom she felt to be superior to all these\nother people, inasmuch as she could and did contrive not to see them. In\nshort, my aunt stipulated, at one and the same time, that whoever came to\nsee her must approve of her way of life, commiserate with her in her\nsufferings, and assure her of an ultimate recovery.",
        "In all this Eulalie excelled. My aunt might say to her twenty times in a\nminute: “The end is come at last, my poor Eulalie!”, twenty times Eulalie\nwould retort with: “Knowing your illness as you do, Mme. Octave, you will\nlive to be a hundred, as Mme. Sazerin said to me only yesterday.” For one\nof Eulalie’s most rooted beliefs, and one that the formidable list of\ncorrections which her experience must have compiled was powerless to\neradicate, was that Mme. Sazerat’s name was really Mme. Sazerin.",
        "“I do not ask to live to a hundred,” my aunt would say, for she preferred\nto have no definite limit fixed to the number of her days.",
        "And since, besides this, Eulalie knew, as no one else knew, how to\ndistract my aunt without tiring her, her visits, which took place\nregularly every Sunday, unless something unforeseen occurred to prevent\nthem, were for my aunt a pleasure the prospect of which kept her on those\ndays in a state of expectation, appetising enough to begin with, but at\nonce changing to the agony of a hunger too long unsatisfied if Eulalie\nwere a minute late in coming. For, if unduly prolonged, the rapture of\nwaiting for Eulalie became a torture, and my aunt would never cease from\nlooking at the time, and yawning, and complaining of each of her symptoms\nin turn. Eulalie’s ring, if it sounded from the front door at the very end\nof the day, when she was no longer expecting it, would almost make her\nill.  For the fact was that on Sundays she thought of nothing else than\nthis visit, and the moment that our luncheon was ended Françoise would\nbecome impatient for us to leave the dining-room so that she might go\nupstairs to ’occupy’ my aunt. But–and this more than ever from the day on\nwhich fine weather definitely set in at Combray–the proud hour °f noon,\ndescending from the steeple of Saint-Hilaire which it blazoned for a\nmoment with the twelve points of its sonorous crown, would long have\nechoed about our table, beside the ’holy bread,’ which too had come in,\nafter church, in its familiar way; and we would still be found seated in\nfront of our Arabian Nights plates, weighed down by the heat of the day,\nand even more by our heavy meal. For upon the permanent foundation of\neggs, cutlets, potatoes, preserves, and biscuits, whose appearance on the\ntable she no longer announced to us, Françoise would add–as the labour of\nfields and orchards, the harvest of the tides, the luck of the markets,\nthe kindness of neighbours, and her own genius might provide; and so\neffectively that our bill of fare, like the quatrefoils that were carved\non the porches of cathedrals in the thirteenth century, reflected to some\nextent the march of the seasons and the incidents of human life–a brill,\nbecause the fish-woman had guaranteed its freshness; a turkey, because she\nhad seen a beauty in the market at Roussainville-le-Pin; cardoons with\nmarrow, because she had never done them for us in that way before; a roast\nleg of mutton, because the fresh air made one hungry and there would be\nplenty of time for it to ’settle down’ in the seven hours before dinner;\nspinach, by way of a change; apricots, because they were still hard to\nget; gooseberries, because in another fortnight there would be none left;\nraspberries, which M. Swann had brought specially; cherries, the first to\ncome from the cherry-tree, which had yielded none for the last two years;\na cream cheese, of which in those days I was extremely fond; an almond\ncake, because she had ordered one the evening before; a fancy loaf,\nbecause it was our turn to ’offer’ the holy bread. And when all these had\nbeen eaten, a work composed expressly for ourselves, but dedicated more\nparticularly to my father, who had a fondness for such things, a cream of\nchocolate, inspired in the mind, created by the hand of Françoise, would\nbe laid before us, light and fleeting as an ’occasional piece’ of music,\ninto which she had poured the whole of her talent. Anyone who refused to\npartake of it, saying: “No, thank you, I have finished; I am not hungry,\"\nwould at once have been lowered to the level of the Philistines who, when\nan artist makes them a present of one of his works, examine its weight and\nmaterial, whereas what is of value is the creator’s intention and his\nsignature. To have left even the tiniest morsel in the dish would have\nshewn as much discourtesy as to rise and leave a concert hall while the\n’piece’ was still being played, and under the composer’s-very eyes.",
        "At length my mother would say to me: “Now, don’t stay here all day; you\ncan go up to your room if you are too hot outside, but get a little fresh\nair first; don’t start reading immediately after your food.”",
        "And I would go and sit down beside the pump and its trough, ornamented\nhere and there, like a gothic font, with a salamander, which modelled upon\na background of crumbling stone the quick relief of its slender,\nallegorical body; on the bench without a back, in the shade of a\nlilac-tree, in that little corner of the garden which communicated, by a\nservice door, with the Rue du Saint-Esprit, and from whose neglected soil\nrose, in two stages, an outcrop from the house itself and apparently a\nseparate building, my aunt’s back-kitchen. One could see its red-tiled\nfloor gleaming like porphyry.  It seemed not so much the cave of\nFrançoise as a little temple of Venus. It would be overflowing with the\nofferings of the milkman, the fruiterer, the greengrocer, come sometimes\nfrom distant villages to dedicate here the first-fruits of their fields.\nAnd its roof was always surmounted by the cooing of a dove.",
        "In earlier days I would not have lingered in the sacred grove which\nsurrounded this temple, for, before going upstairs to read, I would steal\ninto the little sitting-room which my uncle Adolphe, a brother of my\ngrandfather and an old soldier who had retired from the service as a\nmajor, used to occupy on the ground floor, a room which, even when its\nopened windows let in the heat, if not actually the rays of the sun which\nseldom penetrated so far, would never fail to emit that vague and yet\nfresh odour, suggesting at once an open-air and an old-fashioned kind of\nexistence, which sets and keeps the nostrils dreaming when one goes into a\ndisused gun-room. But for some years now I had not gone into my uncle\nAdolphe’s room, since he no longer came to Combray on account of a quarrel\nwhich had arisen between him and my family, by my fault, and in the\nfollowing circumstances: Once or twice every month, in Paris, I used to be\nsent to pay him a. visit, as he was finishing his luncheon, wearing a\nplain alpaca coat, and waited upon by his servant in a working-jacket of\nstriped linen, purple and white.  He would complain that I had not been to\nsee him for a long time; that he was being neglected; he would offer me a\nmarchpane or a tangerine, and we would cross a room in which no one ever\nsat, whose fire was never lighted, whose walls were picked out with gilded\nmouldings, its ceiling painted blue in imitation of the sky, and its\nfurniture upholstered in satin, as at my grandparents’, only yellow; then\nwe would enter what he called his ’study,’ a room whose walls were hung\nwith prints which shewed, against a dark background, a plump and rosy\ngoddess driving a car, or standing upon a globe, or wearing a star on her\nbrow; pictures which were popular under the Second Empire because there\nwas thought to be something about them that suggested Pompeii, which were\nthen generally despised, and which now people are beginning to collect\nagain for one single and consistent reason (despite any others which they\nmay advance), namely, that they suggest the Second Empire. And there I\nwould stay with my uncle until his man came, with a message from the\ncoachman, to ask him at what time he would like the carriage. My uncle\nwould then be lost in meditation, while his astonished servant stood\nthere, not daring to disturb him by the least movement, wondering and\nwaiting for his answer, which never varied.  For in the end, after a\nsupreme crisis of hesitation, my uncle would utter, infallibly, the words:\n“A quarter past two,” which the servant would echo with amazement, but\nwithout disputing them: “A quarter past two! Very good, sir... I will go\nand tell him....”",
        "At this date I was a lover of the theatre: a Platonic lover, of necessity,\nsince my parents had not yet allowed me to enter one, and so incorrect was\nthe picture I drew for myself of the pleasures to be enjoyed there that I\nalmost believed that each of the spectators looked, as into a stereoscope,\nupon a stage and scenery which existed for himself alone, though closely\nresembling the thousand other spectacles presented to the rest of the\naudience individually.",
        "Every morning I would hasten to the Moriss column to see what new plays it\nannounced. Nothing could be more disinterested or happier than the dreams\nwith which these announcements filled my mind, dreams which took their\nform from the inevitable associations of the words forming the title of\nthe play, and also from the colour of the bills, still damp and wrinkled\nwith paste, on which those words stood out. Nothing, unless it were such\nstrange titles as the Testament de César Girodot, or Oedipe-Roi,\ninscribed not on the green bills of the Opéra-Comique, but on the\nwine-coloured bills of the Comédie-Française, nothing seemed to me to\ndiffer more profoundly from the sparkling white plume of the Diamants de\nla Couronne than the sleek, mysterious satin of the Domino Noir; and\nsince my parents had told me that, for my first visit to the theatre, I\nshould have to choose between these two pieces, I would study exhaustively\nand in turn the title of one and the title of the other (for those were\nall that I knew of either), attempting to snatch from each a foretaste of\nthe pleasure which it offered me, and to compare this pleasure with that\nlatent in the other title, until in the end I had shewn myself such vivid,\nsuch compelling pictures of, on the one hand, a play of dazzling\narrogance, and on the other a gentle, velvety play, that I was as little\ncapable of deciding which play I should prefer to see as if, at the\ndinner-table, they had obliged me to choose between rice à l’Impératrice\nand the famous cream of chocolate.",
        "All my conversations with my playfellows bore upon actors, whose art,\nalthough as yet I had no experience of it, was the first of all its\nnumberless forms in which Art itself allowed me to anticipate its\nenjoyment. Between one actor’s tricks of intonation and inflection and\nanother’s, the most trifling differences would strike me as being of an\nincalculable importance.  And from what I had been told of them I would\narrange them in the order of their talent in lists which I used to murmur\nto myself all day long: lists which in the end became petrified in my\nbrain and were a source of annoyance to it, being irremovable.",
        "And later, in my schooldays, whenever I ventured in class, when the\nmaster’s head was turned, to communicate with some new friend, I would\nalways begin by asking him whether he had begun yet to go to theatres, and\nif he agreed that our greatest actor was undoubtedly Got, our second\nDelaunay, and so on. And if, in his judgment, Febvre came below Thiron, or\nDelaunay below Coquelin, the sudden volatility which the name of Coquelin,\nforsaking its stony rigidity, would engender in my mind, in which it moved\nupwards to the second place, the rich vitality with which the name of\nDelaunay would suddenly be furnished, to enable it to slip down to fourth,\nwould stimulate and fertilise my brain with a sense of bradding and\nblossoming life.",
        "But if the thought of actors weighed so upon me, if the sight of Maubant,\ncoming out one afternoon from the Théâtre-Français, had plunged me in the\nthroes and sufferings of hopeless love, how much more did the name of a\n’star,’ blazing outside the doors of a theatre, how much more, seen\nthrough the window of a brougham which passed me in the street, the hair\nover her forehead abloom with roses, did the face of a woman who, I would\nthink, was perhaps an actress, leave with me a lasting disturbance, a\nfutile and painful effort to form a picture of her private life.",
        "I classified, in order of talent, the most distinguished: Sarah Bernhardt,\nBerma, Bartet, Madeleine Brohan, Jeanne Samary; but I was interested in\nthem all. Now my uncle knew many of them personally, and also ladies of\nanother class, not clearly distinguished from actresses in my mind. He\nused to entertain them at his house. And if we went to see him on certain\ndays only, that was because on the other days ladies might come whom his\nfamily could not very well have met. So we at least thought; as for my\nuncle, his fatal readiness to pay pretty widows (who had perhaps never\nbeen married) and countesses (whose high-sounding titles were probably no\nmore than noms de guerre) the compliment of presenting them to my\ngrandmother or even of presenting to them some of our family jewels, had\nalready embroiled him more than once with my grandfather. Often, if the\nname of some actress were mentioned in conversation, I would hear my\nfather say, with a smile, to my mother: “One of your uncle’s friends,” and\nI would think of the weary novitiate through which, perhaps for years on\nend, a grown man, even a man of real importance, might have to pass,\nwaiting on the doorstep of some such lady, while she refused to answer his\nletters and made her hall-porter drive him away; and imagine that my uncle\nwas able to dispense a little jackanapes like myself from all these\nsufferings by introducing me in his own home to the actress,\nunapproachable by all the world, but for him an intimate friend.",
        "And so–on the pretext that some lesson, the hour of which had been\naltered, now came at such an awkward time that it had already more than\nonce prevented me, and would continue to prevent me, from seeing my\nuncle–one day, not one of the days which he set apart for our visits, I\ntook advantage of the fact that my parents had had luncheon earlier than\nusual; I slipped out and, instead of going to read the playbills on their\ncolumn, for which purpose I was allowed to go out unaccompanied, I ran all\nthe way to his house. I noticed before his door a carriage and pair, with\nred carnations on the horses’ blinkers and in the coachman’s buttonhole.\nAs I climbed the staircase I could hear laughter and a woman’s voice, and,\nas soon as I had rung, silence and the sound of shutting doors.  The\nman-servant who let me in appeared embarrassed, and said that my uncle was\nextremely busy and probably could not see me; he went in, however, to\nannounce my arrival, and the same voice I had heard before said: “Oh, yes!\nDo let him come in; just for a moment; it will be so amusing.  Is that his\nphotograph there, on your desk? And his mother (your niece, isn’t she?)\nbeside it? The image of her, isn’t he? I should so like to see the little\nchap, just for a second.”",
        "I could hear my uncle grumbling and growing angry; finally the manservant\ntold me to come in.",
        "On the table was the same plate of marchpanes that was always there; my\nuncle wore the same alpaca coat as on other days; but opposite to him, in\na pink silk dress with a great necklace of pearls about her throat, sat a\nyoung woman who was just finishing a tangerine. My uncertainty whether I\nought to address her as Madame or Mademoiselle made me blush, and not\ndaring to look too much in her direction, in case I should be obliged to\nspeak to her, I hurried across to kiss my uncle. She looked at me and\nsmiled; my uncle said “My nephew!” without telling her my name or telling\nme hers, doubtless because, since his difficulties with my grandfather, he\nhad endeavoured as far as possible to avoid any association of his family\nwith this other class of acquaintance.",
        "“How like his mother he is,” said the lady.",
        "“But you have never seen my niece, except in photographs,” my uncle broke\nin quickly, with a note of anger.",
        "“I beg your pardon, dear friend, I passed her on the staircase last year\nwhen you were so ill. It is true I only saw her for a moment, and your\nstaircase is rather dark; but I saw well enough to see how lovely she was.\nThis young gentleman has her beautiful eyes, and also this,” she went on,\ntracing a line with one finger across the lower part of her forehead.\n“Tell me,” she asked my uncle, “is your niece Mme.––; is her name the\nsame as yours?”",
        "“He takes most after his father,” muttered my uncle, who was no more\nanxious to effect an introduction by proxy, in repeating Mamma’s name\naloud, than to bring the two together in the flesh. “He’s his father all\nover, and also like my poor mother.”",
        "“I have not met his father, dear,” said the lady in pink, bowing her head\nslightly, “and I never saw your poor mother. You will remember it was just\nafter your great sorrow that we got to know one another.”",
        "I felt somewhat disillusioned, for this young lady was in no way different\nfrom other pretty women whom I had seen from time to time at home,\nespecially the daughter of one of our cousins, to whose house I went every\nNew Year’s Day. Only better dressed; otherwise my uncle’s friend had the\nsame quick and kindly glance, the same frank and friendly manner.  I could\nfind no trace in her of the theatrical appearance which I admired in\nphotographs of actresses, nothing of the diabolical expression which would\nhave been in keeping with the life she must lead. I had difficulty in\nbelieving that this was one of ’those women,’ and certainly I should never\nhave believed her one of the ’smart ones’ had I not seen the carriage and\npair, the pink dress, the pearly necklace, had I not been aware, too, that\nmy uncle knew only the very best of them. But I asked myself how the\nmillionaire who gave her her carriage and her flat and her jewels could\nfind any pleasure in flinging his money away upon a woman who had so\nsimple and respectable an appearance. And yet, when I thought of what her\nlife must be like, its immorality disturbed me more, perhaps, than if it\nhad stood before me in some concrete and recognisable form, by its secrecy\nand invisibility, like the plot of a novel, the hidden truth of a scandal\nwhich had driven out of the home of her middle-class parents and dedicated\nto the service of all mankind which had brought to the flowering-point of\nher beauty, had raised to fame or notoriety this woman, the play of whose\nfeatures, the intonations of whose voice, like so many others I already\nknew, made me regard her, in spite of myself, as a young lady of good\nfamily, her who was no longer of a family at all.",
        "We had gone by this time into the ’study,’ and my uncle, who seemed a\ntrifle embarrassed by my presence, offered her a cigarette.",
        "“No, thank you, dear friend,” she said. “You know I only smoke the ones\nthe Grand Duke sends me. I tell him that they make you jealous.” And she\ndrew from a case cigarettes covered with inscriptions in gold, in a\nforeign language. “Why, yes,” she began again suddenly. “Of course I have\nmet this young man’s father with you. Isn’t he your nephew? How on earth\ncould I have forgotten? He was so nice, so charming to me,” she went on,\nmodestly and with feeling. But when I thought to myself what must actually\nhave been the rude greeting (which, she made out, had been so charming),\nI, who knew my father’s coldness and reserve, was shocked, as though at\nsome indelicacy on his part, at the contrast between the excessive\nrecognition bestowed on it and his never adequate geniality.  It has since\nstruck me as one of the most touching aspects of the part played in life\nby these idle, painstaking women that they devote all their generosity,\nall their talent, their transferable dreams of sentimental beauty (for,\nlike all artists, they never seek to realise the value of those dreams, or\nto enclose them in the four-square frame of everyday life), and their\ngold, which counts for little, to the fashioning of a fine and precious\nsetting for the rubbed and scratched and ill-polished lives of men. And\njust as this one filled the smoking-room, where my uncle was entertaining\nher in his alpaca coat, with her charming person, her dress of pink silk,\nher pearls, and the refinement suggested by intimacy with a Grand Duke,\nso, in the same way, she had taken some casual remark by my father, had\nworked it up delicately, given it a ’turn,’ a precious title, set in it\nthe gem of a glance from her own eyes, a gem of the first water, blended\nof humility and gratitude; and so had given it back transformed into a\njewel, a work of art, into something altogether charming.",
        "“Look here, my boy, it is time you went away,” said my uncle.",
        "I rose; I could scarcely resist a desire to kiss the hand of the lady in\npink, but I felt that to do so would require as much audacity as a\nforcible abduction of her. My heart beat loud while I counted out to\nmyself “Shall I do it, shall I not?” and then I ceased to ask myself what\nI ought to do so as at least to do something. Blindly, hotly, madly,\nflinging aside all the reasons I had just found to support such action, I\nseized and raised to my lips the hand she held out to me.",
        "“Isn’t he delicious! Quite a ladies’ man already; he takes after his\nuncle.  He’ll be a perfect ’gentleman,’” she went on, setting her teeth so\nas to give the word a kind of English accentuation. “Couldn’t he come to\nme some day for ’a cup of tea,’ as our friends across the channel say; he\nneed only send me a ’blue’ in the morning?”",
        "I had not the least idea of what a ’blue’ might be. I did not understand\nhalf the words which the lady used, but my fear lest there should be\nconcealed in them some question which it would be impolite in me not to\nanswer kept me from withdrawing my close attention from them, and I was\nbeginning to feel extremely tired.",
        "“No, no; it is impossible,” said my uncle, shrugging his shoulders. “He is\nkept busy at home all day; he has plenty of work to do. He brings back all\nthe prizes from his school,” he added in a lower tone, so that I should\nnot hear this falsehood and interrupt with a contradiction. “You can’t\ntell; he may turn out a little Victor Hugo, a kind of Vaulabelle, don’t\nyou know.”",
        "“Oh, I love artistic people,” replied the lady in pink; “there is no one\nlike them for understanding women. Them, and really nice men like\nyourself.  But please forgive my ignorance. Who, what is Vaulabelle? Is it\nthose gilt books in the little glass case in your drawing-room? You know\nyou promised to lend them to me; I will take great care of them.”",
        "My uncle, who hated lending people books, said nothing, and ushered me out\ninto the hall. Madly in love with the lady in pink, I covered my old\nuncle’s tobacco-stained cheeks with passionate kisses, and while he,\nawkwardly enough, gave me to understand (without actually saying) that he\nwould rather I did not tell my parents about this visit, I assured him,\nwith tears in my eyes, that his kindness had made so strong an impression\nupon me that some day I would most certainly find a way of expressing my\ngratitude. So strong an impression had it made upon me that two hours\nlater, after a string of mysterious utterances which did not strike me as\ngiving my parents a sufficiently clear idea of the new importance with\nwhich I had been invested, I found it simpler to let them have a full\naccount, omitting no detail, of the visit I had paid that afternoon. In\ndoing this I had no thought of causing my uncle any unpleasantness. How\ncould I have thought such a thing, since I did not wish it? And I could\nnot suppose that my parents would see any harm in a visit in which I\nmyself saw none. Every day of our lives does not some friend or other ask\nus to make his apologies, without fail, to some woman to whom he has been\nprevented from writing; and do not we forget to do so, feeling that this\nwoman cannot attach much importance to a silence which has none for\nourselves? I imagined, like everyone else, that the brains of other people\nwere lifeless and submissive receptacles with no power of specific\nreaction to any stimulus which might be applied to them; and I had not the\nleast doubt that when I deposited in the minds of my parents the news of\nthe acquaintance I had made at my uncle’s I should at the same time\ntransmit to them the kindly judgment I myself had based on the\nintroduction. Unfortunately my parents had recourse to principles entirely\ndifferent from those which I suggested they should adopt when they came to\nform their estimate of my uncle’s conduct. My father and grandfather had\n’words’ with him of a violent order; as I learned indirectly. A few days\nlater, passing my uncle in the street as he drove by in an open carriage,\nÎ felt at once all the grief, the gratitude, the remorse which I should\nhave liked to convey to him. Beside the immensity of these emotions I\nconsidered that merely to raise my hat to him would be incongruous and\npetty, and might make him think that I regarded myself as bound to shew\nhim no more than the commonest form of courtesy. I decided to abstain from\nso inadequate a gesture, and turned my head away. My uncle thought that,\nin doing so I was obeying my parents’ orders; he never forgave them; and\nthough he did not die until many years later, not one of us ever set eyes\non him again.",
        "And so I no longer used to go into the little sitting-room (now kept shut)\nof my uncle Adolphe; instead, after hanging about on the outskirts of the\nback-kitchen until Françoise appeared on its threshold and announced: “I\nam going to let the kitchen-maid serve the coffee and take up the hot\nwater; it is time I went off to Mme. Octave,” I would then decide to go\nindoors, and would go straight upstairs to my room to read.  The\nkitchen-maid was an abstract personality, a permanent institution to which\nan invariable set of attributes assured a sort of fixity and continuity\nand identity throughout the long series of transitory human shapes in\nwhich that personality was incarnate; for we never found the same girl\nthere two years running. In the year in which we ate such quantities of\nasparagus, the kitchen-maid whose duty it was to dress them was a poor\nsickly creature, some way ’gone’ in pregnancy when we arrived at Combray\nfor Easter, and it was indeed surprising that Françoise allowed her to run\nso many errands in the town and to do so much work in the house, for she\nwas beginning to find a difficulty in bearing before her the mysterious\ncasket, fuller and larger every day, whose splendid outline could be\ndetected through the folds of her ample smocks. These last recalled the\ncloaks in which Giotto shrouds some of the allegorical figures in his\npaintings, of which M. Swann had given me photographs. He it was who\npointed out the resemblance, and when he inquired after the kitchen-maid\nhe would say: “Well, how goes it with Giotto’s Charity?” And indeed the\npoor girl, whose pregnancy had swelled and stoutened every part of her,\neven to her face, and the vertical, squared outlines of her cheeks, did\ndistinctly suggest those virgins, so strong and mannish as to seem matrons\nrather, in whom the Virtues are personified in the Arena Chapel. And I can\nsee now that those Virtues and Vices of Padua resembled her in another\nrespect as well. For just as the figure of this girl had been enlarged by\nthe additional symbol which she carried in her body, without appearing to\nunderstand what it meant, without any rendering in her facial expression\nof all its beauty and spiritual significance, but carried as if it were an\nordinary and rather heavy burden, so it is without any apparent suspicion\nof what she is about that the powerfully built housewife who is portrayed\nin the Arena beneath the label ’Caritas,’ and a reproduction of whose\nportrait hung upon the wall of my schoolroom at Combray, incarnates that\nvirtue, for it seems impossible, that any thought of charity can ever have\nfound expression in her vulgar and energetic face. By a fine stroke of the\npainter’s invention she is tumbling all the treasures of the earth at her\nfeet, but exactly as if she were treading grapes in a wine-press to\nextract their juice, or, still more, as if she had climbed on a heap of\nsacks to raise herself higher; and she is holding out her flaming heart to\nGod, or shall we say ’handing’ it to Him, exactly as a cook might hand up\na corkscrew through the skylight of her underground kitchen to some one\nwho had called down to ask her for it from the ground-level above. The\n’Invidia,’ again, should have had some look on her face of envy. But in\nthis fresco, too, the symbol occupies so large a place and is represented\nwith such realism; the serpent hissing between the lips of Envy is so\nhuge, and so completely fills her wide-opened mouth that the muscles of\nher face are strained and contorted, like a child’s who is filling a\nballoon with his breath, and that Envy, and we ourselves for that matter,\nwhen we look at her, since all her attention and ours are concentrated on\nthe action of her lips, have no time, almost, to spare for envious\nthoughts.",
        "Despite all the admiration that M. Swann might profess for these figures\nof Giotto, it was a long time before I could find any pleasure in seeing\nin our schoolroom (where the copies he had brought me were hung) that\nCharity devoid of charity, that Envy who looked like nothing so much as a\nplate in some medical book, illustrating the compression of the glottis or\nuvula by a tumour in the tongue, or by the introduction of the operator’s\ninstrument, a Justice whose greyish and meanly regular features were the\nvery same as those which adorned the faces of certain good and pious and\nslightly withered ladies of Combray whom I used to see at mass, many of\nwhom had long been enrolled in the reserve forces of Injustice. But in\nlater years I understood that the arresting strangeness, the special\nbeauty of these frescoes lay in the great part played in each of them by\nits symbols, while the fact that these were depicted, not as symbols (for\nthe thought symbolised was nowhere expressed), but as real things,\nactually felt or materially handled, added something more precise and more\nliteral to their meaning, something more concrete and more striking to the\nlesson they imparted. And even in the case of the poor kitchen-maid, was\nnot our attention incessantly drawn to her belly by the load which filled\nit; and in the same way, again, are not the thoughts of men and women in\nthe agony of death often turned towards the practical, painful, obscure,\ninternal, intestinal aspect, towards that ’seamy side’ of death which is,\nas it happens, the side that death actually presents to them and forces\nthem to feel, a side which far more closely resembles a crushing burden, a\ndifficulty in breathing, a destroying thirst, than the abstract idea to\nwhich we are accustomed to give the name of Death?",
        "There must have been a strong element of reality in those Virtues and\nVices of Padua, since they appeared to me to be as much alive as the\npregnant servant-girl, while she herself appeared scarcely less\nallegorical than they. And, quite possibly, this lack (or seeming lack) of\nparticipation by a person’s soul in the significant marks of its own\nspecial virtue has, apart from its aesthetic meaning, a reality which, if\nnot strictly psychological, may at least be called physiognomical. Later\non, when, in the course of my life, I have had occasion to meet with, in\nconvents for instance, literally saintly examples of practical charity,\nthey have generally had the brisk, decided, undisturbed, and slightly\nbrutal air of a busy surgeon, the face in which one can discern no\ncommiseration, no tenderness at the sight of suffering humanity, and no\nfear of hurting it, the face devoid of gentleness or sympathy, the sublime\nface of true goodness.",
        "Then while the kitchen-maid–who, all unawares, made the superior\nqualities of Françoise shine with added lustre, just as Error, by force of\ncontrast, enhances the triumph of Truth–took in coffee which (according\nto Mamma) was nothing more than hot water, and then carried up to our\nrooms hot water which was barely tepid, I would be lying stretched out on\nmy bed, a book in my hand, in my room which trembled with the effort to\ndefend its frail, transparent coolness against the afternoon sun, behind\nits almost closed shutters through which, however, a reflection of the\nsunlight had contrived to slip in on its golden wings, remaining\nmotionless, between glass and woodwork, in a corner, like a butterfly\npoised upon a flower. It was hardly light enough for me to read, and my\nfeeling of the day’s brightness and splendour was derived solely from the\nblows struck down below, in the Rue de la Curé, by Camus (whom Françoise\nhad assured that my aunt was not ’resting’ and that he might therefore\nmake a noise), upon some old packing-cases from which nothing would really\nbe sent flying but the dust, though the din of them, in the resonant\natmosphere that accompanies hot weather, seemed to scatter broadcast a\nrain of blood-red stars; and from the flies who performed for my benefit,\nin their small concert, as it might be the chamber music of summer;\nevoking heat and light quite differently from an air of human music which,\nif you happen to have heard it during a fine summer, will always bring\nthat summer back to your mind, the flies’ music is bound to the season by\na closer, a more vital tie–born of sunny days, and not to be reborn but\nwith them, containing something of their essential nature, it not merely\ncalls up their image in our memory, but gives us a guarantee that they do\nreally exist, that they are close around us, immediately accessible.",
        "This dim freshness of my room was to the broad daylight of the street what\nthe shadow is to the sunbeam, that is to say, equally luminous, and\npresented to my imagination the entire panorama of summer, which my\nsenses, if I had been out walking, could have tasted and enjoyed in\nfragments only; and so was quite in harmony with my state of repose, which\n(thanks to the adventures related in my books, which had just excited it)\nbore, like a hand reposing motionless in a stream of running water, the\nshock and animation of a torrent of activity and life.",
        "But my grandmother, even if the weather, after growing too hot, had\nbroken, and a storm, or just a shower, had burst over us, would come up\nand beg me to go outside. And as I did not wish to leave off my book, I\nwould go on with it in the garden, under the chestnut-tree, in a little\nsentry-box of canvas and matting, in the farthest recesses of which I used\nto sit and feel that I was hidden from the eyes of anyone who might be\ncoming to call upon the family.",
        "And then my thoughts, did not they form a similar sort of hiding-hole, in\nthe depths of which I felt that I could bury myself and remain invisible\neven when I was looking at what went on outside? When I saw any external\nobject, my consciousness that I was seeing it would remain between me and\nit, enclosing it in a slender, incorporeal outline which prevented me from\never coming directly in contact with the material form; for it would\nvolatilise itself in some way before I could touch it, just as an\nincandescent body which is moved towards something wet never actually\ntouches moisture, since it is always preceded, itself, by a zone of\nevaporation. Upon the sort of screen, patterned with different states and\nimpressions, which my consciousness would quietly unfold while I was\nreading, and which ranged from the most deeply hidden aspirations of my\nheart to the wholly external view of the horizon spread out before my eyes\nat the foot of the garden, what was from the first the most permanent and\nthe most intimate part of me, the lever whose incessant movements\ncontrolled all the rest, was my belief in the philosophic richness and\nbeauty of the book I was reading, and my desire to appropriate these to\nmyself, whatever the book might be. For even if I had purchased it at\nCombray, having seen it outside Borange’s, whose grocery lay too far from\nour house for Françoise to be able to deal there, as she did with Camus,\nbut who enjoyed better custom as a stationer and bookseller; even if I had\nseen it, tied with string to keep it in its place in the mosaic of monthly\nparts and pamphlets which adorned either side of his doorway, a doorway\nmore mysterious, more teeming with suggestion than that of a cathedral, I\nshould have noticed and bought it there simply because I had recognised it\nas a book which had been well spoken of, in my hearing, by the\nschool-master or the school-friend who, at that particular time, seemed to\nme to be entrusted with the secret of Truth and Beauty, things half-felt\nby me, half-incomprehensible, the full understanding of which was the\nvague but permanent object of my thoughts.",
        "Next to this central belief, which, while I was reading, would be\nconstantly a motion from my inner self to the outer world, towards the\ndiscovery of Truth, came the emotions aroused in me by the action in which\nI would be taking part, for these afternoons were crammed with more\ndramatic and sensational events than occur, often, in a whole lifetime.\nThese were the events which took place in the book I was reading. It is\ntrue that the people concerned in them were not what Françoise would have\ncalled ’real people.’ But none of the feelings which the joys or\nmisfortunes of a ’real’ person awaken in us can be awakened except through\na mental picture of those joys or misfortunes; and the ingenuity of the\nfirst novelist lay in his understanding that, as the picture was the one\nessential element in the complicated structure of our emotions, so that\nsimplification of it which consisted in the suppression, pure and simple,\nof ’real’ people would be a decided improvement. A ’real’ person,\nprofoundly as we may sympathise with him, is in a great measure\nperceptible only through our senses, that is to say, he remains opaque,\noffers a dead weight which our sensibilities have not the strength to\nlift. If some misfortune comes to him, it is only in one small section of\nthe complete idea we have of him that we are capable of feeling any\nemotion; indeed it is only in one small section of the complete idea he\nhas of himself that he is capable of feeling any emotion either. The\nnovelist’s happy discovery was to think of substituting for those opaque\nsections, impenetrable by the human spirit, their equivalent in immaterial\nsections, things, that is, which the spirit can assimilate to itself.\nAfter which it matters not that the actions, the feelings of this new\norder of creatures appear to us in the guise of truth, since we have made\nthem our own, since it is in ourselves that they are happening, that they\nare holding in thrall, while we turn over, feverishly, the pages of the\nbook, our quickened breath and staring eyes. And once the novelist has\nbrought us to that state, in which, as in all purely mental states, every\nemotion is multiplied ten-fold, into which his book comes to disturb us as\nmight a dream, but a dream more lucid, and of a more lasting impression\nthan those which come to us in sleep; why, then, for the space of an hour\nhe sets free within us all the joys and sorrows in the world, a few of\nwhich, only, we should have to spend years of our actual life in getting\nto know, and the keenest, the most intense of which would never have been\nrevealed to us because the slow course of their development stops our\nperception of them. It is the same in life; the heart changes, and that is\nour worst misfortune; but we learn of it only from reading or by\nimagination; for in reality its alteration, like that of certain natural\nphenomena, is so gradual that, even if we are able to distinguish,\nsuccessively, each of its different states, we are still spared the actual\nsensation of change.",
        "Next to, but distinctly less intimate a part of myself than this human\nelement, would come the view, more or less projected before my eyes, of\nthe country in which the action of the story was taking place, which made\na far stronger impression on my mind than the other, the actual landscape\nwhich would meet my eyes when I raised them from my book. In this way, for\ntwo consecutive summers I used to sit in the heat of our Combray garden,\nsick with a longing inspired by the book I was then reading for a land of\nmountains and rivers, where I could see an endless vista of sawmills,\nwhere beneath the limpid currents fragments of wood lay mouldering in beds\nof watercress; and nearby, rambling and clustering along low walls, purple\nflowers and red. And since there was always lurking in my mind the dream\nof a woman who would enrich me with her love, that dream in those two\nsummers used to be quickened with the freshness and coolness of running\nwater; and whoever she might be, the woman whose image I called to mind,\npurple flowers and red would at once spring up on either side of her like\ncomplementary colours.",
        "This was not only because an image of which we dream remains for ever\ndistinguished, is adorned and enriched by the association of colours not\nits own which may happen to surround it in our mental picture; for the\nscenes in the books I read were to me not merely scenery more vividly\nportrayed by my imagination than any which Combray could spread before my\neyes but otherwise of the same kind. Because of the selection that the\nauthor had made of them, because of the spirit of faith in which my mind\nwould exceed and anticipate his printed word, as it might be interpreting\na revelation, these scenes used to give me the impression–one which I\nhardly ever derived from any place in which I might happen to be, and\nnever from our garden, that undistinguished product of the strictly\nconventional fantasy of the gardener whom my grandmother so despised–of\ntheir being actually part of Nature herself, and worthy to be studied and\nexplored.",
        "Had my parents allowed me, when I read a book, to pay a visit to the\ncountry it described, I should have felt that I was making an enormous\nadvance towards the ultimate conquest of truth. For even if we have the\nsensation of being always enveloped in, surrounded by our own soul, still\nit does not seem a fixed and immovable prison; rather do we seem to be\nborne away with it, and perpetually struggling to pass beyond it, to break\nout into the world, with a perpetual discouragement as we hear endlessly,\nall around us, that unvarying sound which is no echo from without, but the\nresonance of a vibration from within. We try to discover in things,\nendeared to us on that account, the spiritual glamour which we ourselves\nhave cast upon them; we are disillusioned, and learn that they are in\nthemselves barren and devoid of the charm which they owed, in our minds,\nto the association of certain ideas; sometimes we mobilise all our\nspiritual forces in a glittering array so as to influence and subjugate\nother human beings who, as we very well know, are situated outside\nourselves, where we can never reach them. And so, if I always imagined the\nwoman I loved as in a setting of whatever places I most longed, at the\ntime, to visit; if in my secret longings it was she who attracted me to\nthem, who opened to me the gate of an unknown world, that was not by the\nmere hazard of a simple association of thoughts; no, it was because my\ndreams of travel and of love were only moments–which I isolate\nartificially to-day as though I were cutting sections, at different\nheights, in a jet of water, rainbow-flashing but seemingly without flow or\nmotion–were only drops in a single, undeviating, irresistible outrush of\nall the forces of my life.",
        "And then, as I continue to trace the outward course of these impressions\nfrom their close-packed intimate source in my consciousness, and before I\ncome to the horizon of reality which envelops them, I discover pleasures\nof another kind, those of being comfortably seated, of tasting the good\nscent on the air, of not being disturbed by any visitor; and, when an hour\nchimed from the steeple of Saint-Hilaire, of watching what was already\nspent of the afternoon fall drop by drop until I heard the last stroke\nwhich enabled me to add up the total sum, after which the silence that\nfollowed seemed to herald the beginning, in the blue sky above me, of that\nlong part of the day still allowed me for reading, until the good dinner\nwhich Françoise was even now preparing should come to strengthen and\nrefresh me after the strenuous pursuit of its hero through the pages of my\nbook. And, as each hour struck, it would seem to me that a few seconds\nonly had passed since the hour before; the latest would inscribe itself,\nclose to its predecessor, on the sky’s surface, and I would be unable to\nbelieve that sixty minutes could be squeezed into the tiny arc of blue\nwhich was comprised between their two golden figures. Sometimes it would\neven happen that this precocious hour would sound two strokes more than\nthe last; there must then have been an hour which I had not heard strike;\nsomething which had taken place had not taken place for me; the\nfascination of my book, a magic as potent as the deepest slumber, had\nstopped my enchanted ears and had obliterated the sound of that golden\nbell from the azure surface of the enveloping silence. Sweet Sunday\nafternoons beneath the chestnut-tree in our Combray garden, from which I\nwas careful to eliminate every commonplace incident of my actual life,\nreplacing them by a career of strange adventures and ambitions in a land\nwatered by living streams, you still recall those adventures and ambitions\nto my mind when I think of you, and you embody and preserve them by virtue\nof having little by little drawn round and enclosed them (while I went on\nwith my book and the heat of the day declined) in the gradual\ncrystallisation, slowly altering in form and dappled with a pattern of\nchestnut-leaves, of your silent, sonorous, fragrant, limpid hours.",
        "Sometimes I would be torn from my book, in the middle of the afternoon, by\nthe gardener’s daughter, who came running like a mad thing, overturning an\norange-tree in its tub, cutting a finger, breaking a tooth, and screaming\nout “They’re coming, they’re coming!” so that Françoise and I should run\ntoo and not miss anything of the show. That was on days when the cavalry\nstationed in Combray went out for some military exercise, going as a rule\nby the Rue Sainte-Hildegarde. While our servants, sitting in a row on\ntheir chairs outside the garden railings, stared at the people of Combray\ntaking their Sunday walks and were stared at in return, the gardener’s\ndaughter, through the gap which there was between two houses far away in\nthe Avenue de la Gare, would have spied the glitter of helmets. The\nservants then hurried in with their chairs, for when the troopers filed\nthrough the Rue Sainte-Hildegarde they filled it from side to side, and\ntheir jostling horses scraped against the walls of the houses, covering\nand drowning the pavements like banks which present too narrow a channel\nto a river in flood.",
        "“Poor children,” Françoise would exclaim, in tears almost before she had\nreached the railings; “poor boys, to be mown down like grass in a meadow.\nIt’s just shocking to think of,” she would go on, laying a hand over her\nheart, where presumably she had felt the shock.",
        "“A fine sight, isn’t it, Mme. Françoise, all these young fellows not\ncaring two straws for their lives?” the gardener would ask, just to ’draw’\nher. And he would not have spoken in vain.",
        "“Not caring for their lives, is it? Why, what in the world is there that\nwe should care for if it’s not our lives, the only gift the Lord never\noffers us a second time? Oh dear, oh dear; you’re right all the same; it’s\nquite true, they don’t care! I can remember them in ’70; in those wretched\nwars they’ve no fear of death left in them; they’re nothing more nor less\nthan madmen; and then they aren’t worth the price of a rope to hang them\nwith; they’re not men any more, they’re lions.” For by her way of\nthinking, to compare a man with a lion, which she used to pronounce\n’lie-on,’ was not at all complimentary to the man.",
        "The Rue Sainte-Hildegarde turned too sharply for us to be able to see\npeople approaching at any distance, and it was only through the gap\nbetween those two houses in the Avenue de la Gare that we could still make\nout fresh helmets racing along towards us, and flashing in the sunlight.\nThe gardener wanted to know whether there were still many to come, and he\nwas thirsty besides, with the sun beating down upon his head. So then,\nsuddenly, his daughter would leap out, as though from a beleaguered city,\nwould make a sortie, turn the street corner, and, having risked her life a\nhundred times over, reappear and bring us, with a jug of liquorice-water,\nthe news that there were still at least a thousand of them, pouring along\nwithout a break from the direction of Thiberzy and Méséglise. Françoise\nand the gardener, having ’made up’ their difference, would discuss the\nline to be followed in case of war.",
        "“Don’t you see, Françoise,” he would say. “Revolution would be better,\nbecause then no one would need to join in unless he liked.”",
        "“Oh, yes, I can see that, certainly; it’s more straightforward.”",
        "The gardener believed that, as soon as war was declared, they would stop\nall the railways.",
        "“Yes, to be sure; so that we sha’n’t get away,” said Françoise.",
        "And the gardener would assent, with “Ay, they’re the cunning ones,” for he\nwould not allow that war was anything but a kind of trick which the state\nattempted to play on the people, or that there was a man in the world who\nwould not run away from it if he had the chance to do so.",
        "But Françoise would hasten back to my aunt, and I would return to my book,\nand the servants would take their places again outside the gate to watch\nthe dust settle on the pavement, and the excitement caused by the passage\nof the soldiers subside. Long after order had been restored, an abnormal\ntide of humanity would continue to darken the streets of Corn-bray.  And\nin front of every house, even of those where it was not, as a rule,\n’done,’ the servants, and sometimes even the masters would sit and stare,\nfestooning their doorsteps with a dark, irregular fringe, like the border\nof shells and sea-weed which a stronger tide than usual leaves on the\nbeach, as though trimming it with embroidered crape, when the sea itself\nhas retreated.",
        "Except on such days as these, however, I would as a rule be left to read\nin peace. But the interruption which a visit from Swann once made, and the\ncommentary which he then supplied to the course of my reading, which had\nbrought me to the work of an author quite new to me, called Bergotte, had\nthis definite result that for a long time afterwards it was not against a\nwall gay with spikes of purple blossom, but on a wholly different\nbackground, the porch of a gothic cathedral, that I would see outlined the\nfigure of one of the women of whom I dreamed.",
        "I had heard Bergotte spoken of, for the first time, by a friend older than\nmyself, for whom I had a strong admiration, a precious youth of the name\nof Bloch. Hearing me confess my love of the Nuit d’Octobre, he had burst\nout in a bray of laughter, like a bugle-call, and told me, by way of\nwarning: “You must conquer your vile taste for A. de Musset, Esquire. He\nis a bad egg, one of the very worst, a pretty detestable specimen. I am\nbound to admit, natheless,” he added graciously, “that he, and even the\nman Racine, did, each of them, once in his life, compose a line which is\nnot only fairly rhythmical, but has also what is in my eyes the supreme\nmerit of meaning absolutely nothing. One is",
        "    La blanche Oloossone et la blanche Camire,",
        "and the other",
        "    La fille de Minos et de Pasiphaë.”",
        "They were submitted to my judgment, as evidence for the defence of the two\nrunagates, in an article by my very dear master Father Lecomte, who is\nfound pleasing in the sight of the immortal gods. By which token, here is\na book which I have not the time, just now, to read, a book recommended,\nit would seem, by that colossal fellow. He regards, or so they tell me,\nits author, one Bergotte, Esquire, as a subtle scribe, more subtle,\nindeed, than any beast of the field; and, albeit he exhibits on occasion a\ncritical pacifism, a tenderness in suffering fools, for which it is\nimpossible to account, and hard to make allowance, still his word has\nweight with me as it were the Delphic Oracle. Read you then this lyrical\nprose, and, if the Titanic master-builder of rhythm who composed\nBhagavat and the Lévrier de Magnus speaks not falsely, then, by\nApollo, you may taste, even you, my master, the ambrosial joys of\nOlympus.” It was in an ostensible vein of sarcasm that he had asked me to\ncall him, and that he himself called me, “my master.” But, as a matter of\nfact, we each derived a certain amount of satisfaction from the mannerism,\nbeing still at the age in which one believes that one gives a thing real\nexistence by giving it a name.",
        "Unfortunately I was not able to set at rest, by further talks with Bloch,\nin which I might have insisted upon an explanation, the doubts he had\nengendered in me when he told me that fine lines of poetry (from which I,\nif you please, expected nothing less than the revelation of truth itself)\nwere all the finer if they meant absolutely nothing. For, as it happened,\nBloch was not invited to the house again. At first, he had been well\nreceived there. It is true that my grandfather made out that, whenever I\nformed a strong attachment to any one of my friends and brought him home\nwith me, that friend was invariably a Jew; to which he would not have\nobjected on principle–indeed his own friend Swann was of Jewish\nextraction–had he not found that the Jews whom I chose as friends were\nnot usually of the best type. And so I was hardly ever able to bring a new\nfriend home without my grandfather’s humming the “O, God of our fathers\"\nfrom La Juive, or else “Israel, break thy chain,” singing the tune\nalone, of course, to an “um-ti-tum-ti-tum, tra-la\"; but I used to be\nafraid of my friend’s recognising the sound, and so being able to\nreconstruct the words.",
        "Before seeing them, merely on hearing their names, about which, as often\nas not, there was nothing particularly Hebraic, he would divine not only\nthe Jewish origin of such of my friends as might indeed be of the chosen\npeople, but even some dark secret which was hidden in their family.",
        "“And what do they call your friend who is coming this evening?”",
        "“Dumont, grandpapa.”",
        "“Dumont! Oh, I’m frightened of Dumont.”",
        "And he would sing:",
        "  Archers, be on your guard!\n  Watch without rest, without sound,",
        "and then, after a few adroit questions on points of detail, he would call\nout “On guard! on guard,” or, if it were the victim himself who had\nalready arrived, and had been obliged, unconsciously, by my grandfather’s\nsubtle examination, to admit his origin, then my grandfather, to shew us\nthat he had no longer any doubts, would merely look at us, humming almost\ninaudibly the air of",
        "  What! do you hither guide the feet\n  Of this timid Israelite?",
        "or of",
        "  Sweet vale of Hebron, dear paternal fields,",
        "or, perhaps, of",
        "  Yes, I am of the chosen race.",
        "These little eccentricities on my grandfather’s part implied no ill-will\nwhatsoever towards my friends. But Bloch had displeased my family for\nother reasons. He had begun by annoying my father, who, seeing him come in\nwith wet clothes, had asked him with keen interest:",
        "“Why, M. Bloch, is there a change in the weather; has it been raining?  I\ncan’t understand it; the barometer has been ’set fair.’”",
        "Which drew from Bloch nothing more instructive than “Sir, I am absolutely\nincapable of telling you whether it has rained. I live so resolutely apart\nfrom physical contingencies that my senses no longer trouble to inform me\nof them.”",
        "“My poor boy,” said my father after Bloch had gone, “your friend is out of\nhis mind. Why, he couldn’t even tell me what the weather was like.  As if\nthere could be anything more interesting! He is an imbecile.”",
        "Next, Bloch had displeased my grandmother because, after luncheon, when\nshe complained of not feeling very well, he had stifled a sob and wiped\nthe tears from his eyes.",
        "“You cannot imagine that he is sincere,” she observed to me. “Why he\ndoesn’t know me. Unless he’s mad, of course.”",
        "And finally he had upset the whole household when he arrived an hour and a\nhalf late for luncheon and covered with mud from head to foot, and made\nnot the least apology, saying merely: “I never allow myself to be\ninfluenced in the smallest degree either by atmospheric disturbances or by\nthe arbitrary divisions of what is known as Time. I would willingly\nreintroduce to society the opium pipe of China or the Malayan kriss, but I\nam wholly and entirely without instruction in those infinitely more\npernicious (besides being quite bleakly bourgeois) implements, the\numbrella and the watch.”",
        "In spite of all this he would still have been received at Combray. He was,\nof course, hardly the friend my parents would have chosen for me; they\nhad, in the end, decided that the tears which he had shed on hearing of my\ngrandmother’s illness were genuine enough; but they knew, either\ninstinctively or from their own experience, that our early impulsive\nemotions have but little influence over our later actions and the conduct\nof our lives; and that regard for moral obligations, loyalty to our\nfriends, patience in finishing our work, obedience to a rule of life, have\na surer foundation in habits solidly formed and blindly followed than in\nthese momentary transports, ardent but sterile. They would have preferred\nto Bloch, as companions for myself, boys who would have given me no more\nthan it is proper, by all the laws of middle-class morality, for boys to\ngive one another, who would not unexpectedly send me a basket of fruit\nbecause they happened, that morning, to have thought of me with affection,\nbut who, since they were incapable of inclining in my favour, by any\nsingle impulse of their imagination and emotions, the exact balance of the\nduties and claims of friendship, were as incapable of loading the scales\nto my prejudice. Even the injuries we do them will not easily divert from\nthe path of their duty towards us those conventional natures of which my\ngreat-aunt furnished a type: who, after quarrelling for years with a\nniece, to whom she never spoke again, yet made no change in the will in\nwhich she had left that niece the whole of her fortune, because she was\nher next-of-kin, and it was the ’proper thing’ to do.",
        "But I was fond of Bloch; my parents wished me to be happy; and the\ninsoluble problems which I set myself on such texts as the ’absolutely\nmeaningless’ beauty of La fille de Minos et de Pasiphaë tired me more\nand made me more unwell than I should have been after further talks with\nhim, unwholesome as those talks might seem to my mother’s mind. And he\nwould still have been received at Combray but for one thing. That same\nnight, after dinner, having informed me (a piece of news which had a great\ninfluence on my later life, making it happier at one time and then more\nunhappy) that no woman ever thought of anything but love, and that there\nwas not one of them whose resistance a man could not overcome, he had gone\non to assure me that he had heard it said on unimpeachable authority that\nmy great-aunt herself had led a ’gay’ life in her younger days, and had\nbeen notoriously ’kept.’ I could not refrain from passing on so important\na piece of information to my parents; the next time Bloch called he was\nnot admitted, and afterwards, when I met him in the street, he greeted me\nwith extreme coldness.",
        "But in the matter of Bergotte he had spoken truly.",
        "For the first few days, like a tune which will be running in one’s head\nand maddening one soon enough, but of which one has not for the moment\n’got hold,’ the things I was to love so passionately in Bergotte’s style\nhad not yet caught my eye. I could not, it is true, lay down the novel of\nhis which I was reading, but I fancied that I was interested in the story\nalone, as in the first dawn of love, when we go every day to meet a woman\nat some party or entertainment by the charm of which we imagine it is that\nwe are attracted. Then I observed the rare, almost archaic phrases which\nhe liked to employ at certain points, where a hidden flow of harmony, a\nprelude contained and concealed in the work itself would animate and\nelevate his style; and it was at such points as these, too, that he would\nbegin to speak of the “vain dream of life,” of the “inexhaustible torrent\nof fair forms,” of the “sterile, splendid torture of understanding and\nloving,” of the “moving effigies which ennoble for all time the charming\nand venerable fronts of our cathedrals\"; that he would express a whole\nsystem of philosophy, new to me, by the use of marvellous imagery, to the\ninspiration of which I would naturally have ascribed that sound of harping\nwhich began to chime and echo in my ears, an accompaniment to which that\nimagery added something ethereal and sublime. One of these passages of\nBergotte, the third or fourth which I had detached from the rest, filled\nme with a joy to which the meagre joy I had tasted in the first passage\nbore no comparison, a joy which I felt myself to have experienced in some\ninnermost chamber of my soul, deep, undivided, vast, from which all\nobstructions and partitions seemed to have been swept away. For what\nhad happened was that, while I recognised in this passage the same taste\nfor uncommon phrases, the same bursts of music, the same idealist\nphilosophy which had been present in the earlier passages without my\nhaving taken them into account as the source of my pleasure, I now no\nlonger had the impression of being confronted by a particular passage in\none of Bergotte’s works, which traced a purely bi-dimensional figure in\noutline upon the surface of my mind, but rather of the ’ideal passage’ of\nBergotte, common to every one of his books, and to which all the earlier,\nsimilar passages, now becoming merged in it, had added a kind of density\nand volume, by which my own understanding seemed to be enlarged.",
        "I was by no means Bergotte’s sole admirer; he was the favourite writer\nalso of a friend of my mother’s, a highly literary lady; while Dr. du,\nBoulbon had kept all his patients waiting until he finished Bergotte’s\nlatest volume; and it was from his consulting room, and from a house in a\npark near Combray that some of the first seeds were scattered of that\ntaste for Bergotte, a rare-growth in those days, but now so universally\nacclimatised that one finds it flowering everywhere throughout Europe and\nAmerica, and even in the tiniest villages, rare still in its refinement,\nbut in that alone. What my mother’s friend, and, it would seem, what Dr.\ndu Boulbon liked above all in the writings of Bergotte was just what I\nliked, the same flow of melody, the same old-fashioned phrases, and\ncertain others, quite simple and familiar, but so placed by him, in such\nprominence, as to hint at a particular quality of taste on his part; and\nalso, in the sad parts of his books, a sort of roughness, a tone that was\nalmost harsh. And he himself, no doubt, realised that these were his\nprincipal attractions. For in his later books, if he had hit upon some\ngreat truth, or upon the name of an historic cathedral, he would break off\nhis narrative, and in an invocation, an apostrophe, a lengthy prayer,\nwould give a free outlet to that effluence which, in the earlier volumes,\nremained buried beneath the form of his prose, discernible only in a\nrippling of its surface, and perhaps even more delightful, more harmonious\nwhen it was thus veiled from the eye, when the reader could give no\nprecise indication of where the murmur of the current began, or of where\nit died away. These passages in which he delighted were our favourites\nalso. For my own part I knew all of them by heart. I felt even\ndisappointed when he resumed the thread of his narrative. Whenever he\nspoke of something whose beauty had until then remained hidden from me, of\npine-forests or of hailstorms, of Notre-Dame de Paris, of Athalie, or\nof Phèdre, by some piece of imagery he would make their beauty explode\nand drench me with its essence. And so, dimly realising that the universe\ncontained innumerable elements which my feeble senses would be powerless\nto discern, did he not bring them within my reach, I wished that I might\nhave his opinion, some metaphor of his, upon everything in the world, and\nespecially upon such things as I might have an opportunity, some day, of\nseeing for myself; and among such things, more particularly still upon\nsome of the historic buildings of France, upon certain views of the sea,\nbecause the emphasis with which, in his books, he referred to these shewed\nthat he regarded them as rich in significance and beauty. But, alas, upon\nalmost everything in the world his opinion was unknown to me. I had no\ndoubt that it would differ entirely from my own, since his came down from\nan unknown sphere towards which I was striving to raise myself; convinced\nthat my thoughts would have seemed pure foolishness to that perfected\nspirit, I had so completely obliterated them all that, if I happened to\nfind in one of his books something which had already occurred to my own\nmind, my heart would swell with gratitude and pride as though some deity\nhad, in his infinite bounty, restored it to me, had pronounced it to be\nbeautiful and right. It happened now and then that a page of Bergotte\nwould express precisely those ideas which I used often at night, when I\nwas unable to sleep, to write to my grandmother and mother, and so\nconcisely and well that his page had the appearance of a collection of\nmottoes for me to set at the head of my letters. And so too, in later\nyears, when I began to compose a book of my own, and the quality of some\nof my sentences seemed so inadequate that I could not make up my mind to\ngo on with the undertaking, I would find the equivalent of my sentences in\nBergotte’s.  But it was only then, when I read them in his pages, that I\ncould enjoy them; when it was I myself who composed them, in my anxiety\nthat they should exactly reproduce what I seemed to have detected in my\nmind, and in my fear of their not turning out ’true to life,’ I had no\ntime to ask myself whether what I was writing would be pleasant to read!\nBut indeed there was no kind of language, no kind of ideas which I really\nliked, except these. My feverish and unsatisfactory attempts were\nthemselves a token of my love, a love which brought me no pleasure, but\nwas, for all that, intense and deep. And so, when I came suddenly upon\nsimilar phrases in the writings of another, that is to say stripped of\ntheir familiar accompaniment of scruples and repressions and\nself-tormentings, I was free to indulge to the full my own appetite for\nsuch things, just as a cook who, once in a while, has no dinner to prepare\nfor other people, can then find time to gormandise himself. And so, when I\nhad found, one day, in a book by Bergotte, some joke about an old family\nservant, to which his solemn and magnificent style added a great deal of\nirony, but which was in principle what I had often said to my grandmother\nabout Françoise, and when, another time, I had discovered that he thought\nnot unworthy of reflection in one of those mirrors of absolute Truth which\nwere his writings, a remark similar to one which I had had occasion to\nmake on our friend M. Legrandin (and, moreover, my remarks on Françoise\nand M. Legrandin were among those which I would most resolutely have\nsacrificed for Bergotte’s sake, in the belief that he would find them\nquite without interest); then it was suddenly revealed to me that my own\nhumble existence and the Realms of Truth were less widely separated than I\nhad supposed, that at certain points they were actually in contact; and in\nmy new-found confidence and joy I wept upon his printed page, as in the\narms of a long-lost father.",
        "From his books I had formed an impression of Bergotte as a frail and\ndisappointed old man, who had lost his children, and had never found any\nconsolation. And so I would read, or rather sing his sentences in my\nbrain, with rather more dolce, rather more lento than he himself had,\nperhaps, intended, and his simplest phrase would strike my ears with\nsomething peculiarly gentle and loving in its intonation. More than\nanything else in the world I cherished his philosophy, and had pledged\nmyself to it in lifelong devotion. It made me impatient to reach the age\nwhen I should be eligible to attend the class at school called\n’Philosophy.’ I did not wish to learn or do anything else there, but\nsimply to exist and be guided entirely by the mind of Bergotte, and, if I\nhad been told then that the metaphysicians whom I was actually to follow\nthere resembled him in nothing, I should have been struck down by the\ndespair a young lover feels who has sworn lifelong fidelity, when a friend\nspeaks to him of the other mistresses he will have in time to come.",
        "One Sunday, while I was reading in the garden, I was interrupted by Swann,\nwho had come to call upon my parents.",
        "“What are you reading? May I look? Why, it’s Bergotte! Who has been\ntelling you about him?”",
        "I replied that Bloch was responsible.",
        "“Oh, yes, that boy I saw here once, who looks so like the Bellini portrait\nof Mahomet II. It’s an astonishing likeness; he has the same arched\neyebrows and hooked nose and prominent cheekbones. When his beard comes\nhe’ll be Mahomet himself. Anyhow he has good taste, for Bergotte is a\ncharming creature.” And seeing how much I seemed to admire Bergotte,\nSwann, who never spoke at all about the people he knew, made an exception\nin my favour and said: “I know him well; if you would like him to write a\nfew words on the title-page of your book I could ask him for you.”",
        "I dared not accept such an offer, but bombarded Swann with questions about\nhis friend. “Can you tell me, please, who is his favourite actor?”",
        "“Actor? No, I can’t say. But I do know this: there’s not a man on the\nstage whom he thinks equal to Berma; he puts her above everyone. Have you\nseen her?”",
        "“No, sir, my parents do not allow me to go to the theatre.”",
        "“That is a pity. You should insist. Berma in Phèdre, in the Cid; well,\nshe’s only an actress, if you like, but you know that I don’t believe very\nmuch in the ’hierarchy’ of the arts.” As he spoke I noticed, what had\noften struck me before in his conversations with my grandmother’s sisters,\nthat whenever he spoke of serious matters, whenever he used an expression\nwhich seemed to imply a definite opinion upon some important subject, he\nwould take care to isolate, to sterilise it by using a special intonation,\nmechanical and ironic, as though he had put the phrase or word between\ninverted commas, and was anxious to disclaim any personal responsibility\nfor it; as who should say “the ’hierarchy,’ don’t you know, as silly\npeople call it.” But then, if it was so absurd, why did he say the\n’hierarchy’? A moment later he went on: “Her acting will give you as noble\nan inspiration as any masterpiece of art in the world, as–oh, I don’t\nknow–” and he began to laugh, “shall we say the Queens of Chartres?\"\nUntil then I had supposed that his horror of having to give a serious\nopinion was something Parisian and refined, in contrast to the provincial\ndogmatism of my grandmother’s sisters; and I had imagined also that it was\ncharacteristic of the mental attitude towards life of the circle in which\nSwann moved, where, by a natural reaction from the ’lyrical’ enthusiasms\nof earlier generations, an excessive importance was given to small and\nprecise facts, formerly regarded as vulgar, and anything in the nature of\n’phrase-making’ was banned. But now I found myself slightly shocked by\nthis attitude which Swann invariably adopted when face to face with\ngeneralities. He appeared unwilling to risk even having an opinion, and to\nbe at his ease only when he could furnish, with meticulous accuracy, some\nprecise but unimportant detail. But in so doing he did not take into\naccount that even here he was giving an opinion, holding a brief (as they\nsay) for something, that the accuracy of his details had an importance of\nits own.  I thought again of the dinner that night, when I had been so\nunhappy because Mamma would not be coming up to my room, and when he had\ndismissed the balls given by the Princesse de Léon as being of no\nimportance.  And yet it was to just that sort of amusement that he was\ndevoting his life. For what other kind of existence did he reserve the\nduties of saying in all seriousness what he thought about things, of\nformulating judgments which he would not put between inverted commas; and\nwhen would he cease to give himself up to occupations of which at the\nsame, time he made out that they were absurd? I noticed, too, in the\nmanner in which Swann spoke to me of Bergotte, something which, to do him\njustice, was not peculiar to himself, but was shared by all that writer’s\nadmirers at that time, at least by my mother’s friend and by Dr. du\nBoulbon. Like Swann, they would say of Bergotte: “He has a charming mind,\nso individual, he has a way of his own of saying things, which is a little\nfar-fetched, but so pleasant. You never need to look for his name on the\ntitle-page, you can tell his work at once.” But none of them had yet gone\nso far as to say “He is a great writer, he has great talent.” They did not\neven credit him with talent at all. They did not speak, because they were\nnot aware of it. We are very slow in recognising in the peculiar\nphysiognomy of a new writer the type which is labelled ’great talent’ in\nour museum of general ideas. Simply because that physiognomy is new and\nstrange, we can find in it no resemblance to what we are accustomed to\ncall talent. We say rather originality, charm, delicacy, strength; and\nthen one day we add up the sum of these, and find that it amounts simply\nto talent.",
        "“Are there any books in which Bergotte has written about Berma?” I asked\nM. Swann.",
        "“I think he has, in that little essay on Racine, but it must be out of\nprint. Still, there has perhaps been a second impression. I will find out.\nAnyhow, I can ask Bergotte himself all that you want to know next time he\ncomes to dine with us. He never misses a week, from one year’s end to\nanother. He is my daughter’s greatest friend. They go about together, and\nlook at old towns and cathedrals and castles.”",
        "As I was still completely ignorant of the different grades in the social\nhierarchy, the fact that my father found it impossible for us to see\nanything of Swann’s wife and daughter had, for a long time, had the\ncontrary effect of making me imagine them as separated from us by an\nenormous gulf, which greatly enhanced their dignity and importance in my\neyes. I was sorry that my mother did not dye her hair and redden her lips,\nas I had heard our neighbour, Mme. Sazerat, say that Mme. Swann did, to\ngratify not her husband but M. de Charlus; and I felt that, to her, we\nmust be an object of scorn, which distressed me particularly on account of\nthe daughter, such a pretty little girl, as I had heard, and one of whom I\nused often to dream, always imagining her with the same features and\nappearance, which I bestowed upon her quite arbitrarily, but with a\ncharming effect. But from this afternoon, when I had learned that Mile.\nSwann was a creature living in such rare and fortunate circumstances,\nbathed, as in her natural element, in such a sea of privilege that, if she\nshould ask her parents whether anyone were coming to dinner, she would be\nanswered in those two syllables, radiant with celestial light, would hear\nthe name of that golden guest who was to her no more than an old friend of\nher family, Bergotte; that for her the intimate conversation at table,\ncorresponding to what my great-aunt’s conversation was for me, would be\nthe words of Bergotte upon all those subjects which he had not been able\nto take up in his writings, and on which I would fain have heard him utter\noracles; and that, above all, when she went to visit other towns, he would\nbe walking by her side, unrecognised and glorious, like the gods who came\ndown, of old, from heaven to dwell among mortal men: then I realised both\nthe rare worth of a creature such as Mile. Swann, and, at the same time,\nhow coarse and ignorant I should appear to her; and I felt so keenly how\npleasant and yet how impossible it would be for me to become her friend\nthat I was filled at once with longing and with despair. And usually, from\nthis time forth, when I thought of her, I would see her standing before\nthe porch of a cathedral, explaining to me what each of the statues meant,\nand, with a smile which was my highest commendation, presenting me, as her\nfriend, to Bergotte.  And invariably the charm of all the fancies which\nthe thought of cathedrals used to inspire in me, the charm of the hills\nand valleys of the He de France and of the plains of Normandy, would\nradiate brightness and beauty over the picture I had formed in my mind of\nMile. Swann; nothing more remained but to know and to love her. Once we\nbelieve that a fellow-creature has a share in some unknown existence to\nwhich that creature’s love for ourselves can win us admission, that is, of\nall the preliminary conditions which Love exacts, the one to which he\nattaches most importance, the one which makes him generous or indifferent\nas to the rest. Even those women who pretend that they judge a man by his\nexterior only, see in that exterior an emanation from some special way of\nlife. And that is why they fall in love with a soldier or a fireman, whose\nuniform makes them less particular about his face; they kiss and believe\nthat beneath the crushing breastplate there beats a heart different from\nthe rest, more gallant, more adventurous, more tender; and so it is that a\nyoung king or a crown prince may travel in foreign countries and make the\nmost gratifying conquests, and yet lack entirely that regular and classic\nprofile which would be indispensable, I dare say, in an outside-broker.",
        "While I was reading in the garden, a thing my great-aunt would never have\nunderstood my doing save on a Sunday, that being the day on which it was\nunlawful to indulge in any serious occupation, and on which she herself\nwould lay aside her sewing (on a week-day she would have said, “How you\ncan go on amusing yourself with a book; it isn’t Sunday, you know!\"\nputting into the word ’amusing’ an implication of childishness and waste\nof time), my aunt Léonie would be gossiping with Françoise until it was\ntime for Eulalie to arrive. She would tell her that she had just seen Mme.\nGoupil go by “without an umbrella, in the silk dress she had made for her\nthe other day at Châteaudun. If she has far to go before vespers, she may\nget it properly soaked.”",
        "“Very likely” (which meant also “very likely not”) was the answer, for\nFrançoise did not wish definitely to exclude the possibility of a happier\nalternative.",
        "“There, now,” went on my aunt, beating her brow, “that reminds me that I\nnever heard if she got to church this morning before the Elevation.  I\nmust remember to ask Eulalie... Françoise, just look at that black cloud\nbehind the steeple, and how poor the light is on the slates, you may be\ncertain it will rain before the day is out. It couldn’t possibly keep on\nlike this, it’s been too hot. And the sooner the better, for until the\nstorm breaks my Vichy water won’t ’go down,’” she concluded, since, in her\nmind, the desire to accelerate the digestion of her Vichy water was of\ninfinitely greater importance than her fear of seeing Mme. Goupil’s new\ndress ruined.",
        "“Very likely.”",
        "“And you know that when it rains in the Square there’s none too much\nshelter.” Suddenly my aunt turned pale. “What, three o’clock!” she\nexclaimed.  “But vespers will have begun already, and I’ve forgotten my\npepsin!  Now I know why that Vichy water has been lying on my stomach.\"\nAnd falling precipitately upon a prayer-book bound in purple velvet, with\ngilt clasps, out of which in her haste she let fall a shower of the little\npictures, each in a lace fringe of yellowish paper, which she used to mark\nthe places of the greater feasts of the church, my aunt, while she\nswallowed her drops, began at full speed to mutter the words of the sacred\ntext, its meaning being slightly clouded in her brain by the uncertainty\nwhether the pepsin, when taken so long after the Vichy, would still be\nable to overtake it and to ’send it down.’ “Three o’clock! It’s\nunbelievable how time flies.”",
        "A little tap at the window, as though some missile had struck it, followed\nby a plentiful, falling sound, as light, though, as if a shower of sand\nwere being sprinkled from a window overhead; then the fall spread, took on\nan order, a rhythm, became liquid, loud, drumming, musical, innumerable,\nuniversal. It was the rain.",
        "“There, Françoise, what did I tell you? How it’s coming down! But I think\nI heard the bell at the garden gate: go along and see who can be outside\nin this weather.”",
        "Françoise went and returned. “It’s Mme. Amédée” (my grandmother).  “She\nsaid she was going for a walk. It’s raining hard, all the same.”",
        "“I’m not at all surprised,” said my aunt, looking up towards the sky.\n“I’ve always said that she was not in the least like other people. Well,\nI’m glad it’s she and not myself who’s outside in all this.”",
        "“Mme. Amédée is always the exact opposite of the rest,” said Françoise,\nnot unkindly, refraining until she should be alone with the other servants\nfrom stating her belief that my grandmother was ’a bit off her head.’",
        "“There’s Benediction over! Eulalie will never come now,” sighed my aunt.\n“It will be the weather that’s frightened her away.”",
        "“But it’s not five o’clock yet, Mme. Octave, it’s only half-past four.”",
        "“Only half-past four! And here am I, obliged to draw back the small\ncurtains, just to get a tiny streak of daylight. At half-past four! Only a\nweek before the Rogation-days. Ah, my poor Françoise, the dear Lord must\nbe sorely vexed with us. The world is going too far in these days. As my\npoor Octave used to say, we have forgotten God too often, and He is taking\nvengeance upon us.”",
        "A bright flush animated my aunt’s cheeks; it was Eulalie. As ill luck\nwould have it, scarcely had she been admitted to the presence when\nFrançoise reappeared and, with a smile which was meant to indicate her\nfull participation in the pleasure which, she had no doubt, her tidings\nwould give my aunt, articulating each syllable so as to shew that, in\nspite of her having to translate them into indirect speech, she was\nrepeating, as a good servant should, the very words which the new visitor\nhad condescended to use, said: “His reverence the Curé would be delighted,\nenchanted, if Mme. Octave is not resting just now, and could see him. His\nreverence does not wish to disturb Mme. Octave. His reverence is\ndownstairs; I told him to go into the parlour.”",
        "Had the truth been known, the Curé’s visits gave my aunt no such ecstatic\npleasure as Françoise supposed, and the air of jubilation with which she\nfelt bound to illuminate her face whenever she had to announce his\narrival, did not altogether correspond to what was felt by her invalid.\nThe Curé (an excellent man, with whom I am sorry now that I did not\nconverse more often, for, even if he cared nothing for the arts, he knew a\ngreat many etymologies), being in the habit of shewing distinguished\nvisitors over his church (he had even planned to compile a history of the\nParish of Com-bray), used to weary her with his endless explanations,\nwhich, incidentally, never varied in the least degree. But when his visit\nsynchronized exactly with Eulalie’s it became frankly distasteful to my\naunt. She would have preferred to make the most of Eulalie, and not to\nhave had the whole of her circle about her at one time. But she dared not\nsend the Curé away, and had to content herself with making a sign to\nEulalie not to leave when he did, so that she might have her to herself\nfor a little after he had gone.",
        "“What is this I have been hearing, Father, that a painter has set up his\neasel in your church, and is copying one of the windows? Old as I am, I\ncan safely say that I have never even heard of such a thing in all my\nlife!  What is the world coming to next, I wonder! And the ugliest thing\nin the whole church, too.”",
        "“I will not go so far as to say that it is quite the ugliest, for,\nalthough there are certain things in Saint-Hilaire which are well worth a\nvisit, there are others that are very old now, in my poor basilica, the\nonly one in all the diocese that has never even been restored. The Lord\nknows, our porch is dirty and out of date; still, it is of a majestic\ncharacter; take, for instance, the Esther tapestries, though personally I\nwould not give a brass farthing for the pair of them, but experts put them\nnext after the ones at Sens. I can quite see, too, that apart from certain\ndetails which are–well, a trifle realistic, they shew features which\ntestify to a genuine power of observation.  But don’t talk to me about the\nwindows. Is it common sense, I ask you, to leave up windows which shut out\nall the daylight, and even confuse the eyes by throwing patches of colour,\nto which I should be hard put to it to give a name, on a floor in which\nthere are not two slabs on the same level? And yet they refuse to renew\nthe floor for me because, if you please, those are the tombstones of the\nAbbots of Combray and the Lords of Guermantes, the old Counts, you know,\nof Brabant, direct ancestors of the present Duc de Guermantes, and of his\nDuchesse also, since she was a lady of the Guermantes family, and married\nher cousin.” (My grandmother, whose steady refusal to take any interest in\n’persons’ had ended in her confusing all their names and titles, whenever\nanyone mentioned the Duchesse de Guermantes used to make out that she must\nbe related to Mme. de Villeparisis. The whole family would then burst out\nlaughing; and she would attempt to justify herself by harking back to some\ninvitation to a christening or funeral: “I feel sure that there was a\nGuermantes in it somewhere.” And for once I would side with the others,\nand against her, refusing to admit that there could be any connection\nbetween her school-friend and the descendant of Geneviève de Brabant.)",
        "“Look at Roussainville,” the Curé went on. “It is nothing more nowadays\nthan a parish of farmers, though in olden times the place must have had a\nconsiderable importance from its trade in felt hats and clocks. (I am not\ncertain, by the way, of the etymology of Roussainville. I should dearly\nlike to think that the name was originally Rouville, from Radulfi villa,\nanalogous, don’t you see, to Châteauroux, Castrum Radulfi, but we will\ntalk about that some other time.) Very well; the church there has superb\nwindows, almost all quite modern, including that most imposing ’Entry of\nLouis-Philippe into Combray’ which would be more in keeping, surely, at\nCombray itself, and which is every bit as good, I understand, as the\nfamous^windows at Chartres. Only yesterday I met Dr. Percepied’s brother,\nwho goes in for these things, and he told me that he looked upon it as a\nmost beautiful piece of work. But, as I said to this artist, who, by the\nway, seems to be a most civil fellow, and is a regular virtuoso, it\nappears, with his brush; what on earth, I said to him, do you find so\nextraordinary in this window, which is, if anything, a little dingier than\nthe rest?”",
        "“I am sure that if you were to ask his Lordship,” said my aunt in a\nresigned tone, for she had begun to feel that she was going to be ’tired,’\n“he would never refuse you a new window.”",
        "“You may depend upon it, Mme. Octave,” replied the Curé. “Why, it was just\nhis Lordship himself who started the outcry about the window, by proving\nthat it represented Gilbert the Bad, a Lord of Guermantes and a direct\ndescendant of Geneviève de Brabant, who was a daughter of the House of\nGuermantes, receiving absolution from Saint Hilaire.”",
        "“But I don’t see where Saint Hilaire comes in.”",
        "“Why yes, have you never noticed, in the corner of the window, a lady in a\nyellow robe? Very well, that is Saint Hilaire, who is also known, you will\nremember, in certain parts of the country as Saint Illiers, Saint Hèlier,\nand even, in the Jura, Saint Ylie. But these various corruptions of\nSanctus Hilarius are by no means the most curious that have occurred in\nthe names of the blessed Saints. Take, for example, my good Eulalie, the\ncase of your own patron, Sancta Eulalia; do you know what she has become\nin Burgundy?  Saint Eloi, nothing more nor less! The lady has become a\ngentleman.  Do you hear that, Eulalie, after you are dead they will make a\nman of you!”",
        "“Father will always have his joke.”",
        "“Gilbert’s brother, Charles the Stammerer, was a pious prince, but, having\nearly in life lost his father, Pepin the Mad, who died as a result of his\nmental infirmity, he wielded the supreme power with all the arrogance of a\nman who has not been subjected to discipline in his youth, so much so\nthat, whenever he saw a man in a town whose face he did not remember, he\nwould massacre the whole place, to the last inhabitant. Gilbert, wishing\nto be avenged on Charles, caused the church at Combray to be burned down,\nthe original church, that was, which Théodebert, when he and his court\nleft the country residence he had near here, at Thiberzy (which is, of\ncourse, Theodeberiacus), to go out and fight the Burgundians, had\npromised to build over the tomb of Saint Hilaire if the Saint brought him;\nvictory. Nothing remains of it now but the crypt, into which Théodore has\nprobably taken you, for Gilbert burned all the rest. Finally, he defeated\nthe unlucky Charles with the aid of William” which the Curé pronounced\n“Will’am” “the Conqueror, which is why so many English still come to visit\nthe place. But he does not appear to have managed to win the affection of\nthe people of Combray, for they fell upon him as he was coming out from\nmass, and cut off his head. Théodore has a little book, that he lends\npeople, which tells you the whole story.",
        "“But what is unquestionably the most remarkable thing about our church is\nthe view from the belfry, which is full of grandeur. Certainly in your\ncase, since you are not very strong, I should never recommend you: to\nclimb our seven and ninety steps, just half the number they have in the\nfamous cathedral at Milan. It is quite tiring enough for the most active\nperson, especially as you have to go on your hands and knees, if you don’t\nwish to crack your skull, and you collect all the cobwebs off the\nstaircase upon your clothes. In any case you should be well wrapped up,\"\nhe went on, without noticing my aunt’s fury at the mere suggestion that\nshe could ever, possibly, be capable of climbing into his belfry, “for\nthere’s a strong breeze there, once you get to the top. Some people even\nassure me that they have felt the chill of death up there. No matter, on\nSundays there are always clubs and societies, who come, some of them, long\ndistances to admire our beautiful panorama, and they always go home\ncharmed.  Wait now, next Sunday, if the weather holds, you will be sure to\nfind a lot of people there, for Rogation-tide. You must admit, certainly,\nthat the view from up there is like a fairy-tale, with what you might call\nvistas along the plain, which have quite a special charm of their own. On\na clear day you can see as far as Verneuil. And then another thing; you\ncan see at the same time places which you are in the habit of seeing one\nwithout the other, as, for instance, the course of the Vivonne and the\nditches at Saint-Assise-lès-Combray, which are separated, really, by a\nscreen of tall trees; or, to take another example, there are all the\ncanals at Jouy-le-Vicomte, which is Gaudiacus vicecomitis, as of course\nyou know. Each time that I have been to Jouy I have seen a bit of a canal\nin one place, and then I have turned a corner and seen another, but when I\nsaw the second I could no longer see the first. I tried in vain to imagine\nhow they lay by one another; it was no good. But, from the top of\nSaint-Hilaire, it’s quite another matter; the whole countryside is spread\nout before you like a map. Only, you cannot make out the water; you would\nsay that there were great rifts in the town, slicing it up so neatly that\nit looks like a loaf of bread which still holds together after it has been\ncut up. To get it all quite perfect you would have to be in both places at\nonce; up here on the top of Saint-Hilaire and down there at\nJouy-le-Vicomte.”",
        "The Curé had so much exhausted my aunt that no sooner had he gone than she\nwas obliged to send away Eulalie also.",
        "“Here, my poor Eulalie,” she said in a feeble voice, drawing a coin from a\nsmall purse which lay ready to her hand. “This is just something so that\nyou shall not forget me in your prayers.”",
        "“Oh, but, Mme. Octave, I don’t think I ought to; you know very well that I\ndon’t come here for that!” So Eulalie would answer, with the same\nhesitation and the same embarrassment, every Sunday, as though each\ntemptation were the first, and with a look of displeasure which enlivened\nmy aunt and never offended her, for if it so happened that Eulalie, when\nshe took the money, looked a little less sulky than usual, my aunt would\nremark afterwards, “I cannot think what has come over Eulalie; I gave her\njust the trifle I always give, and she did not look at all pleased.”",
        "“I don’t think she has very much to complain of, all the same,” Françoise\nwould sigh grimly, for she had a tendency to regard as petty cash all that\nmy aunt might give her for herself or her children, and as treasure\nriotously squandered on a pampered and ungrateful darling the little coins\nslipped, Sunday by Sunday, into Eulalie’s hand, but so discreetly passed\nthat Françoise never managed to see them. It was not that she wanted to\nhave for herself the money my aunt bestowed on Eulalie. She already\nenjoyed a sufficiency of all that my aunt possessed, in the knowledge that\nthe wealth of the mistress automatically ennobled and glorified the maid\nin the eyes of the world; and that she herself was conspicuous and worthy\nto be praised throughout Combray, Jouy-le-Vicomte, and other cities of\nmen, on account of my aunt’s many farms, her frequent and prolonged visits\nfrom the Curé, and the astonishing number of bottles of Vichy water which\nshe consumed.  Françoise was avaricious only for my aunt; had she had\ncontrol over my aunt’s fortune (which would have more than satisfied her\nhighest ambition) she would have guarded it from the assaults of strangers\nwith a maternal ferocity. She would, however, have seen no great harm in\nwhat my aunt, whom she knew to be incurably generous, allowed herself to\ngive away, had she given only to those who were already rich. Perhaps she\nfelt that such persons, not being actually in need of my aunt’s presents,\ncould not be suspected of simulating affection for her on that account.\nBesides, presents offered to persons of great wealth and position, such as\nMme.  Sazerat, M. Swann, M. Legrandin and Mme. Goupil, to persons of the\n’same class’ as my aunt, and who would naturally ’mix with her,’ seemed to\nFrançoise to be included among the ornamental customs of that strange and\nbrilliant life led by rich people, who hunted and shot, gave balls and\npaid visits, a life which she would contemplate with an admiring smile.\nBut it was by no means the same thing if, for this princely exchange of\ncourtesies, my aunt substituted mere charity, if her beneficiaries were of\nthe class which Françoise would label “people like myself,” or “people no\nbetter than myself,” people whom she despised even more if they did not\naddress her always as “Mme. Françoise,” just to shew that they considered\nthemselves to be ’not as good.’ And when she saw that, despite all her\nwarnings, my aunt continued to do exactly as she pleased, and to fling\nmoney away with both hands (or so, at least, Françoise believed) on\nundeserving objects, she began to find that the presents she herself\nreceived from my aunt were very tiny compared to the imaginary riches\nsquandered upon Eulalie, There was not, in the neighbourhood of Combray, a\nfarm of such prosperity and importance that Françoise doubted Eulalie’s\nability to buy it, without thinking twice, out of the capital which her\nvisits to my aunt had ’brought in.’ It must be added that Eulalie had\nformed an exactly similar estimate of the vast and secret hoards of\nFrançoise. So, every Sunday, after Eulalie had gone, Françoise would\nmercilessly prophesy her coming downfall. She hated Eulalie, but was at\nthe same time afraid of her, and so felt bound, when Eulalie was there, to\n’look pleasant.’ But she would make up for that after the other’s\ndeparture; never, it is true, alluding to her by name, but hinting at her\nin Sibylline oracles, or in utterances of a comprehensive character, like\nthose of Ecclesiastes, the Preacher, but so worded that their special\napplication could not escape my aunt. After peering out at the side of the\ncurtain to see whether Eulalie had shut the front-door behind her;\n“Flatterers know how to make themselves welcome, and to gather up the\ncrumbs; but have patience, have patience; our God is a jealous God, and\none fine day He will be avenged upon them!” she would declaim, with the\nsidelong, insinuating glance of Joash, thinking of Athaliah alone when he\nsays that the",
        "    prosperity\n  Of wicked men runs like a torrent past,\n  And soon is spent.",
        "But on this memorable afternoon, when the Curé had come as well, and by\nhis interminable visit had drained my aunt’s strength, Françoise followed\nEulalie from the room, saying: “Mme. Octave, I will leave you to rest; you\nlook utterly tired out.”",
        "And my aunt answered her not a word, breathing a sigh so faint that it\nseemed it must prove her last, and lying there with closed eyes, as though\nalready dead. But hardly had Françoise arrived downstairs, when four peals\nof a bell, pulled with the utmost violence, reverberated through the\nhouse, and my aunt, sitting erect upon her bed, called out: “Has Eulalie\ngone yet? Would you believe it; I forgot to ask her whether Mme. Goupil\narrived in church before the Elevation. Run after her, quick!”",
        "But Françoise returned alone, having failed to overtake Eulalie.  “It is\nmost provoking,” said my aunt, shaking her head. “The one important thing\nthat I had to ask her.”",
        "In this way life went by for my aunt Léonie, always the same, in the\ngentle uniformity of what she called, with a pretence of deprecation but\nwith a deep tenderness, her ’little jog-trot.’ Respected by all and\nsundry, not merely in her own house, where every one of us, having learned\nthe futility of recommending any healthier mode of life, had become\ngradually resigned to its observance, but in the village as well, where,\nthree streets away, a tradesman who had to hammer nails into a\npacking-case would send first to Françoise to make sure that my aunt was\nnot ’resting’–her ’little jog-trot’ was, none the less, brutally\ndisturbed on one occasion in this same year. Like a fruit hidden among its\nleaves, which has grown and ripened unobserved by man, until it falls of\nits own accord, there came upon us one night the kitchen-maid’s\nconfinement. Her pains were unbearable, and, as there was no midwife in\nCombray, Françoise had to set off before dawn to fetch one from Thiberzy.\nMy aunt was unable to ’rest,’ owing to the cries of the girl, and as\nFrançoise, though the distance was nothing, was very late in returning,\nher services were greatly missed.  And so, in the course of the morning,\nmy mother said to me: “Run upstairs, and see if your aunt wants anything.”",
        "I went into the first of her two rooms, and through the open door of the\nother saw my aunt lying on her side, asleep. I could hear her breathing,\nin what was almost distinguishable as a snore. I was just going to slip\naway when something, probably the sound of my entry, interrupted her\nsleep, and made it ’change speed,’ as they say of motorcars nowadays, for\nthe music of her snore broke off for a second and began again on a lower\nnote; then she awoke, and half turned her face, which I could see for the\nfirst time; a kind of horror was imprinted on it; plainly she had just\nescaped from some terrifying dream. She could not see me from where she\nwas lying, and I stood there not knowing whether I ought to go forward or\nto retire; but all at once she seemed to return to a sense of reality, and\nto grasp the falsehood of the visions that had terrified her; a smile of\njoy, a pious act of thanksgiving to God, Who is pleased to grant that life\nshall be less cruel than our dreams, feebly illumined her face, and, with\nthe habit she had formed of speaking to herself, half-aloud, when she\nthought herself alone, she murmured: “The Lord be praised! We have nothing\nto disturb us here but the kitchen-maid’s baby. And I’ve been dreaming\nthat my poor Octave had come back to life, and was trying to make me take\na walk every day!” She stretched out a hand towards her rosary, which was\nlying on the small table, but sleep was once again getting the mastery,\nand did not leave her the strength to reach it; she fell asleep, calm and\ncontented, and I crept out of the room on tiptoe, without either her or\nanyone’s else ever knowing, from that day to this, what I had seen and\nheard.",
        "When I say that, apart from such rare happenings as this confinement, my\naunt’s ’little jog-trot’ never underwent any variation, I do not include\nthose variations which, repeated at regular intervals and in identical\nform, did no more, really, than print a sort of uniform pattern upon the\ngreater uniformity of her life. So, for instance, every Saturday, as\nFrançoise had to go in the afternoon to market at Roussainville-le-Pin,\nthe whole household would have to have luncheon an hour earlier. And my\naunt had so thoroughly acquired the habit of this weekly exception to her\ngeneral habits, that she clung to it as much as to the rest. She was so\nwell ’routined’ to it, as Françoise would say, that if, on a Saturday, she\nhad had to wait for her luncheon until the regular hour, it would have\n’upset’ her as much as if she had had, on an ordinary day, to put her\nluncheon forward to its Saturday time. Incidentally this acceleration of\nluncheon gave Saturday, for all of us, an individual character, kindly and\nrather attractive. At the moment when, ordinarily, there was still an hour\nto be lived through before meal-time sounded, we would all know that in a\nfew seconds we should see the endives make their precocious appearance,\nfollowed by the special favour of an omelette, an unmerited steak. The\nreturn of this asymmetrical Saturday was one of those petty occurrences,\nintra-mural, localised, almost civic, which, in uneventful lives and\nstable orders of society, create a kind of national unity, and become the\nfavourite theme for conversation, for pleasantries, for anecdotes which\ncan be embroidered as the narrator pleases; it would have provided a\nnucleus, ready-made, for a legendary cycle, if any of us had had the epic\nmind. At daybreak, before we were dressed, without rhyme or reason, save\nfor the pleasure of proving the strength of our solidarity, we would call\nto one another good-humoredly, cordially, patriotically, “Hurry up;\nthere’s no time to be lost; don’t forget, it’s Saturday!” while my aunt,\ngossiping with Françoise, and reflecting that the day would be even longer\nthan usual, would say, “You might cook them a nice bit of veal, seeing\nthat it’s Saturday.” If, at half-past ten, some one absent-mindedly pulled\nout a watch and said, “I say, an hour-and-a-half still before luncheon,\"\neveryone else would be in ecstasies over being able to retort at once:\n“Why, what are you thinking about? Have you for-gotten that it’s\nSaturday?” And a quarter of an hour later we would still be laughing, and\nreminding ourselves to go up and tell aunt Léonie about this absurd\nmistake, to amuse her. The very face of the sky appeared to undergo a\nchange. After luncheon the sun, conscious that it was Saturday, would\nblaze an hour longer in the zenith, and when some one, thinking that we\nwere late in starting for our walk, said, “What, only two o’clock!\"\nfeeling the heavy throb go by him of the twin strokes from the steeple of\nSaint-Hilaire (which as a rule passed no one at that hour upon the\nhighways, deserted for the midday meal or for the nap which follows it, or\non the banks of the bright and ever-flowing stream, which even the angler\nhad abandoned, and so slipped unaccompanied into the vacant sky, where\nonly a few loitering clouds remained to greet them) the whole family would\nrespond in chorus: “Why, you’re forgetting; we had luncheon an hour\nearlier; you know very well it’s Saturday.”",
        "The surprise of a ’barbarian’ (for so we termed everyone who was not\nacquainted with Saturday’s special customs) who had called at eleven\no’clock to speak to my father, and had found us at table, was an event\nwhich used to cause Françoise as much merriment as, perhaps, anything that\nhad ever happened in her life. And if she found it amusing that the\nnonplussed visitor should not have known, beforehand, that we had our\nluncheon an hour earlier on Saturday, it was still more irresistibly funny\nthat my father himself (fully as she sympathised, from the bottom of her\nheart, with the rigid chauvinism which prompted him) should never have\ndreamed that the barbarian could fail to be aware of so simple a matter,\nand so had replied, with no further enlightenment of the other’s surprise\nat seeing us already in the dining-room: “You see, it’s Saturday.” On\nreaching this point in the story, Françoise would pause to wipe the tears\nof merriment from her eyes, and then, to add to her own enjoyment, would\nprolong the dialogue, inventing a further reply for the visitor to whom\nthe word ’Saturday’ had conveyed nothing. And so far from our objecting to\nthese interpolations, we would feel that the story was not yet long\nenough, and would rally her with: “Oh, but surely he said something else\nas well. There was more than that, the first time you told it.”",
        "My great-aunt herself would lay aside her work, and raise her head and\nlook on at us over her glasses.",
        "The day had yet another characteristic feature, namely, that during May we\nused to go out on Saturday evenings after dinner to the ’Month of Mary’\ndevotions.",
        "As we were liable, there, to meet M. Vinteuil, who held very strict views\non “the deplorable untidiness of young people, which seems to be\nencouraged in these days,” my mother would first see that there was\nnothing out of order in my appearance, and then we would set out for the\nchurch.  It was in these ’Month of Mary’ services that I can remember\nhaving first fallen in love with hawthorn-blossom. The hawthorn was not\nmerely in the church, for there, holy ground as it was, we had all of us a\nright of entry; but, arranged upon the altar itself, inseparable from the\nmysteries in whose celebration it was playing a part, it thrust in among\nthe tapers and the sacred vessels its rows of branches, tied to one\nanother horizontally in a stiff, festal scheme of decoration; and they\nwere made more lovely still by the scalloped outline of the dark leaves,\nover which were scattered in profusion, as over a bridal train, little\nclusters of buds of a dazzling whiteness.  Though I dared not look at them\nsave through my fingers, I could feel that the formal scheme was composed\nof living things, and that it was Nature herself who, by trimming the\nshape of the foliage, and by adding the crowning ornament of those snowy\nbuds, had made the decorations worthy of what was at once a public\nrejoicing and a solemn mystery.  Higher up on the altar, a flower had\nopened here and there with a careless grace, holding so unconcernedly,\nlike a final, almost vaporous bedizening, its bunch of stamens, slender as\ngossamer, which clouded the flower itself in a white mist, that in\nfollowing these with my eyes, in trying to imitate, somewhere inside\nmyself, the action of their blossoming, I imagined it as a swift and\nthoughtless movement of the head with an enticing glance from her\ncontracted pupils, by a young girl in white, careless and alive.",
        "M. Vinteuil had come in with his daughter and had sat down beside us.  He\nbelonged to a good family, and had once been music-master to my\ngrandmother’s sisters; so that when, after losing his wife and inheriting\nsome property, he had retired to the neighbourhood of Combray, we used\noften to invite him to our house. But with his intense prudishness he had\ngiven up coming, so as not to be obliged to meet Swann, who had made what\nhe called “a most unsuitable marriage, as seems to be the fashion in these\ndays.” My mother, on hearing that he ’composed,’ told him by way of a\ncompliment that, when she came to see him, he must play her something of\nhis own. M. Vinteuil would have liked nothing better, but he carried\npoliteness and consideration for others to so fine a point, always putting\nhimself in their place, that he was afraid of boring them, or of appearing\negotistical, if he carried out, or even allowed them to suspect what were\nhis own desires. On the day when my parents had gone to pay him a visit, I\nhad accompanied them, but they had allowed me to remain outside, and as M.\nVinteuil’s house, Montjouvain, stood on a site actually hollowed out from\na steep hill covered with shrubs, among which I took cover, I had found\nmyself on a level with his drawing-room, upstairs, and only a few feet\naway from its window. When a servant came in to tell him that my parents\nhad arrived, I had seen M. Vinteuil run to the piano and lay out a sheet\nof music so as to catch the eye. But as soon as they entered the room he\nhad snatched it away and hidden it in a corner. He was afraid, no doubt,\nof letting them suppose that he was glad to see them only because it gave\nhim a chance of playing them some of his compositions. And every time that\nmy mother, in the course of her visit, had returned to the subject of his\nplaying, he had hurriedly protested: “I cannot think who put that on the\npiano; it is not the proper place for it at all,” and had turned the\nconversation aside to other topics, simply because those were of less\ninterest to himself.",
        "His one and only passion was for his daughter, and she, with her somewhat\nboyish appearance, looked so robust that it was hard to restrain a smile\nwhen one saw the precautions her father used to take for her health, with\nspare shawls always in readiness to wrap around her shoulders. My\ngrandmother had drawn our attention to the gentle, delicate, almost timid\nexpression which might often be caught flitting across the face, dusted\nall over with freckles, of this otherwise stolid child. When she had\nspoken, she would at once take her own words in the sense in which her\naudience must have heard them, she would be alarmed at the possibility of\na misunderstanding, and one would see, in clear outline, as though in a\ntransparency, beneath the mannish face of the ’good sort’ that she was,\nthe finer features of a young woman in tears.",
        "When, before turning to leave the church, I made a genuflection before the\naltar, I felt suddenly, as I rose again, a bitter-sweet fragrance of\nalmonds steal towards me from the hawthorn-blossom, and I then noticed\nthat on the flowers themselves were little spots of a creamier colour, in\nwhich I imagined that this fragrance must lie concealed, as the taste of\nan almond cake lay in the burned parts, or the sweetness of Mile.\nVinteuil’s cheeks beneath their freckles. Despite the heavy, motionless\nsilence of the hawthorns, these gusts of fragrance came to me like the\nmurmuring of an intense vitality, with which the whole altar was quivering\nlike a roadside hedge explored by living antennae, of which I was reminded\nby seeing some stamens, almost red in colour, which seemed to have kept\nthe springtime virulence, the irritant power of stinging insects now\ntransmuted into flowers.",
        "Outside the church we would stand talking for a moment with M.  Vinteuil,\nin the porch. Boys would be chevying one another in the Square, and he\nwould interfere, taking the side of the little ones and lecturing the big.\nIf his daughter said, in her thick, comfortable voice, how glad she had\nbeen to see us, immediately it would seem as though some elder and more\nsensitive sister, latent in her, had blushed at this thoughtless,\nschoolboyish utterance, which had, perhaps, made us think that she was\nangling for an invitation to the house. Her father would then arrange a\ncloak over her shoulders, they would clamber into a little dog-cart which\nshe herself drove, and home they would both go to Montjouvain. As for\nourselves, the next day being Sunday, with no need to be up and stirring\nbefore high mass, if it was a moonlight night and warm, then, instead of\ntaking us home at once, my father, in his thirst for personal distinction,\nwould lead us on a long walk round by the Calvary, which my mother’s utter\nincapacity for taking her bearings, or even for knowing which road she\nmight be on, made her regard as a triumph of his strategic genius.\nSometimes we would go as far as the viaduct, which began to stride on its\nlong legs of stone at the railway station, and to me typified all the\nwretchedness of exile beyond the last outposts of civilisation, because\nevery year, as we came down from Paris, we would be warned to take special\ncare, when we got to Combray, not to miss the station, to be ready before\nthe train stopped, since it would start again in two minutes and proceed\nacross the viaduct, out of the lands of Christendom, of which Combray, to\nme, represented the farthest limit. We would return by the Boulevard de la\nGare, which contained the most attractive villas in the town. In each of\ntheir gardens the moonlight, copying the art of Hubert Robert, had\nscattered its broken staircases of white marble, its fountains of water\nand gates temptingly ajar. Its beams had swept away the telegraph office.\nAll that was left of it was a column, half shattered, but preserving the\nbeauty of a ruin which endures for all time. I would by now be dragging my\nweary limbs, and ready to drop with sleep; the balmy scent of the\nlime-trees seemed a consolation which I could obtain only at the price of\ngreat suffering and exhaustion, and not worthy of the effort. From gates\nfar apart the watchdogs, awakened by our steps in the silence, would set\nup an antiphonal barking, as I still hear them bark, at times, in the\nevenings, and it is in their custody (when the public gardens of Combray\nwere constructed on its site) that the Boulevard de la Gare must have\ntaken refuge, for wherever I may be, as soon as they begin their alternate\nchallenge and acceptance, I can see it again with all its lime-trees, and\nits pavement glistening beneath the moon.",
        "Suddenly my father would bring us to a standstill and ask my\nmother–\"Where are we?” Utterly worn out by the walk but still proud of\nher husband, she would lovingly confess that she had not the least idea.\nHe would shrug his shoulders and laugh. And then, as though it had\nslipped, with his latchkey, from his waistcoat pocket, he would point out\nto us, when it stood before our eyes, the back-gate of our own garden,\nwhich had come hand-in-hand with the familiar corner of the Rue du\nSaint-Esprit, to await us, to greet us at the end of our wanderings over\npaths unknown. My mother would murmur admiringly “You really are\nwonderful!” And from that instant I had not to take another step; the\nground moved forward under my feet in that garden where, for so long, my\nactions had ceased to require any control, or even attention, from my\nwill. Custom came to take me in her arms, carried me all the way up to my\nbed, and laid me down there like a little child.",
        "Although Saturday, by beginning an hour earlier, and by depriving her of\nthe services of Françoise, passed more slowly than other days for my aunt,\nyet, the moment it was past, and a new week begun, she would look forward\nwith impatience to its return, as something that embodied all the novelty\nand distraction which her frail and disordered body was still able to\nendure. This was not to say, however, that she did not long, at times, for\nsome even greater variation, that she did not pass through those abnormal\nhours in which one thirsts for something different from what one has, when\nthose people who, through lack of energy or imagination, are unable to\ngenerate any motive power in themselves, cry out, as the clock strikes or\nthe postman knocks, in their eagerness for news (even if it be bad news),\nfor some emotion (even that of grief); when the heartstrings, which\nprosperity has silenced, like a harp laid by, yearn to be plucked and\nsounded again by some hand, even a brutal hand, even if it shall break\nthem; when the will, which has with such difficulty brought itself to\nsubdue its impulse, to renounce its right to abandon itself to its own\nuncontrolled desires, and consequent sufferings, would fain cast its\nguiding reins into the hands of circumstances, coercive and, it may be,\ncruel. Of course, since my aunt’s strength, which was completely drained\nby the slightest exertion, returned but drop by drop into the pool of her\nrepose, the reservoir was very slow in filling, and months would go by\nbefore she reached that surplus which other people use up in their daily\nactivities, but which she had no idea–and could never decide how to\nemploy. And I have no doubt that then–just as a desire to have her\npotatoes served with béchamel sauce, for a change, would be formed,\nultimately, from the pleasure she found in the daily reappearance of those\nmashed potatoes of which she was never ’tired’–she would extract from the\naccumulation of those monotonous days (on which she so much depended) a\nkeen expectation of some domestic cataclysm, instantaneous in its\nhappening, but violent enough to compel her to put into effect, once for\nall, one of those changes which she knew would be beneficial to her\nhealth, but to which she could never make up her mind without some such\nstimulus. She was genuinely fond of us; she would have enjoyed the long\nluxury of weeping for our untimely decease; coming at a moment when she\nfelt ’well’ and was not in a perspiration, the news that the house was\nbeing destroyed by a fire, in which all the rest of us had already\nperished, a fire which, in a little while, would not leave one stone\nstanding upon another, but from which she herself would still have plenty\nof time to escape without undue haste, provided that she rose at once from\nher bed, must often have haunted her dreams, as a prospect which combined\nwith the two minor advantages of letting her taste the full savour of her\naffection for us in long years of mourning, and of causing universal\nstupefaction in the village when she should sally forth to conduct our\nobsequies, crushed but courageous, moribund but erect, the paramount and\npriceless boon of forcing her at the right moment, with no time to be\nlost, no room for weakening hesitations, to go off and spend the summer at\nher charming farm of Mirougrain, where there was a waterfall. Inasmuch as\nnothing of this sort had ever occurred, though indeed she must often have\npondered the success of such a manoeuvre as she lay alone absorbed in her\ninterminable games of patience (and though it must have plunged her in\ndespair from the first moment of its realisation, from the first of those\nlittle unforeseen facts, the first word of calamitous news, whose accents\ncan never afterwards be expunged from the memory, everything that bears\nupon it the imprint of actual, physical death, so terribly different from\nthe logical abstraction of its possibility) she would fall back from time\nto time, to add an interest to her life, upon imagining other, minor\ncatastrophes, which she would follow up with passion. She would beguile\nherself with a sudden suspicion that Françoise had been robbing her, that\nshe had set a trap to make certain, and had caught her betrayer\nred-handed; and being in the habit, when she made up a game of cards by\nherself, of playing her own and her adversary’s hands at once, she would\nfirst stammer out Françoise’s awkward apologies, and then reply to them\nwith such a fiery indignation that any of us who happened to intrude upon\nher at one of these moments would find her bathed in perspiration, her\neyes blazing, her false hair pushed awry and exposing the baldness of her\nbrows. Françoise must often, from the next room, have heard these mordant\nsarcasms levelled at herself, the mere framing of which in words would not\nhave relieved my aunt’s feelings sufficiently, had they been allowed to\nremain in a purely immaterial form, without the degree of substance and\nreality which she added to them by murmuring them half-aloud.  Sometimes,\nhowever, even these counterpane dramas would not satisfy my aunt; she must\nsee her work staged. And so, on a Sunday, with all the doors mysteriously\nclosed, she would confide in Eulalie her doubts of Françoise’s integrity\nand her determination to be rid of her, and on another day she would\nconfide in Françoise her suspicions of the disloyalty of Eulalie, to whom\nthe front-door would very soon be closed for good. A few days more, and,\ndisgusted with her latest confidant, she would again be ’as thick as\nthieves’ with the traitor, while, before the next performance, the two\nwould once more have changed their parts. But the suspicions which Eulalie\nmight occasionally breed in her were no more than a fire of straw, which\nmust soon subside for lack of fuel, since Eulalie was not living with her\nin the house. It was a very different matter when the suspect was\nFrançoise, of whose presence under the same roof as herself my aunt was\nperpetually conscious, while for fear of catching cold, were she to leave\nher bed, she would never dare go downstairs to the kitchen to see for\nherself whether there was, indeed, any foundation for her suspicions. And\nso on by degrees, until her mind had no other occupation than to attempt,\nat every hour of the day, to discover what was being done, what was being\nconcealed from her by Françoise. She would detect the most furtive\nmovement of Françoise’s features, something contradictory in what she was\nsaying, some desire which she appeared to be screening.  And she would\nshew her that she was unmasked, by, a single word, which made Françoise\nturn pale, and which my aunt seemed to find a cruel satisfaction in\ndriving into her unhappy servant’s heart. And the very next Sunday a\ndisclosure by Eulalie–like one of those discoveries which suddenly open\nup an unsuspected field for exploration to some new science which has\nhitherto followed only the beaten paths–proved to my aunt that her own\nworst suspicions fell a long way short of the appalling truth. “But\nFrançoise ought to know that,” said Eulalie, “now that you have given her\na carriage.”",
        "“Now that I have given her a carriage!” gasped my aunt.",
        "“Oh, but I didn’t know; I only thought so; I saw her go by yesterday in\nher open coach, as proud as Artaban, on her way to Roussainville market. I\nsupposed that it must be Mme. Octave who had given it to her.”",
        "So on by degrees, until Françoise and my aunt, the quarry and the hunter,\ncould never cease from trying to forestall each other’s devices.  My\nmother was afraid lest Françoise should develop a genuine hatred of my\naunt, who was doing everything in her power to annoy her. However that\nmight be, Françoise had come, more and more, to pay an infinitely\nscrupulous attention to my aunt’s least word and gesture. When she had to\nask her for anything she would hesitate, first, for a long time, making up\nher mind how best to begin. And when she had uttered her request, she\nwould watch my aunt covertly, trying to guess from the expression on her\nface what she thought of it, and how she would reply. And in this\nway–whereas an artist who had been reading memoirs of the seventeenth\ncentury, and wished to bring himself nearer to the great Louis, would\nconsider that he was making progress in that direction when he constructed\na pedigree that traced his own descent from some historic family, or when\nhe engaged in correspondence with one of the reigning Sovereigns of\nEurope, and so would shut his eyes to the mistake he was making in seeking\nto establish a similarity by an exact and therefore lifeless copy of mere\noutward forms–a middle-aged lady in a small country town, by doing no\nmore than yield whole-hearted obedience to her own irresistible\neccentricities, and to a spirit of mischief engendered by the utter\nidleness of her existence, could see, without ever having given a thought\nto Louis XIV, the most trivial occupations of her daily life, her morning\ntoilet, her luncheon, her afternoon nap, assume, by virtue of their\ndespotic singularity, something of the interest that was to be found in\nwhat Saint-Simon used to call the ’machinery’ of life at Versailles; and\nwas able, too, to persuade herself that her silence, a shade of good\nhumour or of arrogance on her features, would provide Françoise with\nmatter for a mental commentary as tense with passion and terror, as did\nthe silence, the good humour or the arrogance of the King when a courtier,\nor even his greatest nobles, had presented a petition to him, at the\nturning of an avenue, at Versailles.",
        "One Sunday, when my aunt had received simultaneous visits from the Curé\nand from Eulalie, and had been left alone, afterwards, to rest, the whole\nfamily went upstairs to bid her good night, and Mamma ventured to condole\nwith her on the unlucky coincidence that always brought both visitors to\nher door at the same time.",
        "“I hear that things went wrong again to-day, Léonie,” she said kindly,\n“you have had all your friends here at once.”",
        "And my great-aunt interrupted with: “Too many good things...\"\nfor, since her daughter’s illness, she felt herself in duty bound to\nrevive her as far as possible by always drawing her attention to the\nbrighter side of things. But my father had begun to speak.",
        "“I should like to take advantage,” he said, “of the whole family’s being\nhere together, to tell you a story, so as not to have to begin all over\nagain to each of you separately. I am afraid we are in M. Legrandin’s bad\nbooks; he would hardly say ’How d’ye do’ to me this morning.”",
        "I did not wait to hear the end of my father’s story, for I had been with\nhim myself after mass when we had passed M. Legrandin; instead, I went\ndownstairs to the kitchen to ask for the bill of fare for our dinner,\nwhich was of fresh interest to me daily, like the news in a paper, and\nexcited me as might the programme of a coming festivity.",
        "As M. Legrandin had passed close by us on our way from church, walking by\nthe side of a lady, the owner of a country house in the neighbourhood,\nwhom we knew only by sight, my father had saluted him in a manner at once\nfriendly and reserved, without stopping in his walk; M.  Legrandin had\nbarely acknowledged the courtesy, and then with an air of surprise, as\nthough he had not recognised us, and with that distant look characteristic\nof people who do not wish to be agreeable, and who from the suddenly\nreceding depths of their eyes seem to have caught sight of you at the far\nend of an interminably straight road, and at so great a distance that they\ncontent themselves with directing towards you an almost imperceptible\nmovement of the head, in proportion to your doll-like dimensions.",
        "Now, the lady who was walking with Legrandin was a model of virtue, known\nand highly respected; there could be no question of his being out for\namorous adventure, and annoyed at being detected; and my father asked\nhimself how he could possibly have displeased our friend.",
        "“I should be all the more sorry to feel that he was angry with us,” he\nsaid, “because among all those people in their Sunday clothes there is\nsomething about him, with his little cut-away coat and his soft neckties,\nso little ’dressed-up,’ so genuinely simple; an air of innocence, almost,\nwhich is really attractive.”",
        "But the vote of the family council was unanimous, that my father had\nimagined the whole thing, or that Legrandin, at the moment in question,\nhad been preoccupied in thinking about something else. Anyhow, my father’s\nfears were dissipated no later than the following evening. As we returned\nfrom a long walk we saw, near the Pont-Vieux, Legrandin himself, who, on\naccount of the holidays, was spending a few days more in Combray. He came\nup to us with outstretched hand: “Do you know, master book-lover,” he\nasked me, “this line of Paul Desjardins?",
        "  Now are the woods all black, but still the sky is blue.",
        "Is not that a fine rendering of a moment like this? Perhaps you have never\nread Paul Desjardins. Read him, my boy, read him; in these days he is\nconverted, they tell me, into a preaching friar, but he used to have the\nmost charming water-colour touch–",
        "  Now are the woods all black, but still the sky is blue.",
        "May you always see a blue sky overhead, my young friend; and then, even\nwhen the time comes, which is coming now for me, when the woods are all\nblack, when night is fast falling, you will be able to console yourself,\nas I am doing, by looking up to the sky.” He took a cigarette from his\npocket and stood for a long time, his eyes fixed on the horizon. “Goodbye,\nfriends!” he suddenly exclaimed, and left us.",
