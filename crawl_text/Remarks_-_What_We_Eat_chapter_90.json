        "On 3d street, St. Paul, there stands a restaurant that has outside as a\nsign, under a glass case, a rib roast, a slice of ham and a roast duck\nthat I remembered distinctly having seen there in 1860 and before the war.\nI asked an epicure the other day if he thought it right to keep those\nthings there year after year when so many were starving throughout the\nlength and breadth of the land. He then straightway did take me up close\nso that I could see that the food was made of plaster and painted, as\nhereinbefore set forth and by me translated, as Walt Whitman would say.",
        "A day or two afterward, at a rural hotel, I struck some of that same roast\nbeef and ham. I thought that the sign had been put on the table by\nmistake, and I made bold to tell the proprietor about it, on the ground\nthat “any neglect or impertinence on the part of servants should be\nreported at the office.” He received the information with great rudeness\nand a most disagreeable air.",
        "There are two kinds of guests who live at the average hotel. One is the\nparty who gets up and walks over the whole corps de hote, from the\nbald-headed proprietor to the bootblack, while the other is the meek and\nmild-eyed man, doomed to sit at the table and bewail the flight of time\nand the horrors of starvation while waiting for the relief party to come\nwith his food.",
        "I belong to the latter class. Born, as I was, in a private family, and\nearly acquiring the habit of eating food that was intended to assuage\nhunger mostly, it takes me a good while to accustom myself to the style of\ndyspeptic microbe used simply to ornament a bill of fare. Of course it is\nmaintained by some hotel men that food solely for eating purposes is\nbecoming obsolete and outre, and that the stuff they put on their bills\nof fare is just as good to pour down the back of a guest as diet that is\ncooked for the common, low, perverted taste of people who have no higher\naspiration than to eat their food.",
        "Of course the genial, urbane and talented reader will see at once the\nstyle of hotel I am referring to. It is the hotel that apes the good hotel\nand prints a bill of fare solely as a literary effort. That is the hotel\nwhere you find the moth-eaten towel and the bed-ridden coffee. There is\nwhere you get butter that runs the elevator day times and sleeps on the\nflannel cakes at night.",
        "It is there that you meet the weary and way-worn steak that bears the\ntoothprints of other guests who are now in a land where the early-rising\nchambermaid cannot enter.",
        "I also refer to the hotel where the bellboy is simply an animated polisher\nof banisters, and otherwise extremely useless. It is likewise the house\nwhere the syrup tastes like tincture of rhubarb, and the pancakes taste\nlike a hektograph.",
        "The traveling man will call to mind the hotel to which I refer, and he\nwill instantly name it and tell you that he has never spent the Sabbath\nthere.",
        "I honestly believe that some hotel men lose money and custom by trying to\nissue a large blanket-sheet bill of fare every day, when a more modest\nlist containing two or three things that a human being could eat with\nimpunity would be far more acceptable, healthy and remunerative.",
        "Some people can live on cracked wheat, bran and skimmed milk, no matter\nwhere they go, and so they always seem to be perfectly happy; but, while\nsimplicity is my watchword, and while I am Old Simplicity himself, as it\nwere, I haven’t been constructed with stomachs enough to successfully\nwrestle with these things. I like a few plain dishes with victuals on\nthem, cooked by a person who has had some experience in that line before.\nI am not so especially tied to high prices and finger-bowls, for I have\nrisen from the common people, and during the first eighteen years of my\nlife I had to dress myself. I was not always the pampered child of\nenervating luxury that I now am, by any means. So I can subsist for weeks\non good, plain food, and never murmur or repine; but where the mistake at\nsome hotels seems to have been made, is in trying to issue a bill of fare\nevery day that will attract the attention of literary minds and excite the\ncuriosity of linguists instead of people who desire to assuage an internal\ncraving for grub.",
        "I use the term grub in its broadest and most comprehensive sense.",
        "So, if I may take the liberty to do so, let me exhort the landlord who is\ngradually accumulating indebtedness and remorse, to use a plainer, less\nelaborate, but more edible list of refreshments. Otherwise his guests will\nall die young.",
        "Let him discard the seamless waffle and the kiln-dried hen. Let him\nabstain from the debris known as cottage pudding, that being its alias,\nwhile the doctors recognize it as old Gastric Disturbance. Too much of our\nhotel food tastes like the second day of January or the fifth day of July.\nThat’s the whole thing in a few words, and unless the good hotels are\nnearer together we shall have to multiply our cemetery facilities.",
        "Poor hotels are responsible for lots of drunkards every year. The only\ntime I am tempted to soak my sorrows in rum is after I have read a\ndelusive bill of fare and eaten a broiled barn-hinge with gravy on it that\ntasted like the broth of perdition. It is then that the demon of\nintemperance and colic comes to me and, in siren tones, says: “Try our\nbourbon, with ’Polly Narius’ on the side.”",
