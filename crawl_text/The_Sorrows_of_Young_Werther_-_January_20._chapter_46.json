        "I must write to you from this place, my dear Charlotte, from a\nsmall room in a country inn, where I have taken shelter from a\nsevere storm. During my whole residence in that wretched place\nD—, where I lived amongst strangers, — strangers, indeed, to\nthis heart, — I never at any time felt the smallest inclination\nto correspond with you; but in this cottage, in this retirement,\nin this solitude, with the snow and hail beating against my\nlattice-pane, you are my first thought. The instant I entered,\nyour figure rose up before me, and the remembrance! O my Charlotte,\nthe sacred, tender remembrance! Gracious Heaven! restore to me\nthe happy moment of our first acquaintance.",
        "Could you but see me, my dear Charlotte, in the whirl of\ndissipation, — how my senses are dried up, but my heart is at no\ntime full. I enjoy no single moment of happiness: all is vain —\nnothing touches me. I stand, as it were, before the raree-show:\nI see the little puppets move, and I ask whether it is not an\noptical illusion. I am amused with these puppets, or, rather, I\nam myself one of them: but, when I sometimes grasp my neighbour’s\nhand, I feel that it is not natural; and I withdraw mine with a\nshudder. In the evening I say I will enjoy the next morning’s\nsunrise, and yet I remain in bed: in the day I promise to ramble\nby moonlight; and I, nevertheless, remain at home. I know not why\nI rise, nor why I go to sleep.",
        "The leaven which animated my existence is gone: the charm which\ncheered me in the gloom of night, and aroused me from my morning\nslumbers, is for ever fled.",
        "I have found but one being here to interest me, a Miss B—. She\nresembles you, my dear Charlotte, if any one can possibly resemble\nyou. “Ah!” you will say, “he has learned how to pay fine compliments.\"\nAnd this is partly true. I have been very agreeable lately, as\nit was not in my power to be otherwise. I have, moreover, a deal\nof wit: and the ladies say that no one understands flattery better,\nor falsehoods you will add; since the one accomplishment invariably\naccompanies the other. But I must tell you of Miss B—. She has\nabundance of soul, which flashes from her deep blue eyes. Her\nrank is a torment to her, and satisfies no one desire of her heart.\nShe would gladly retire from this whirl of fashion, and we often\npicture to ourselves a life of undisturbed happiness in distant\nscenes of rural retirement: and then we speak of you, my dear\nCharlotte; for she knows you, and renders homage to your merits;\nbut her homage is not exacted, but voluntary, she loves you, and\ndelights to hear you made the subject of conversation.",
        "Oh, that I were sitting at your feet in your favourite little room,\nwith the dear children playing around us! If they became troublesome\nto you, I would tell them some appalling goblin story; and they\nwould crowd round me with silent attention. The sun is setting\nin glory; his last rays are shining on the snow, which covers the\nface of the country: the storm is over, and I must return to my\ndungeon. Adieu!— Is Albert with you? and what is he to you? God\nforgive the question.",
