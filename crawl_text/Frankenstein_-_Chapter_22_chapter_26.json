        "The voyage came to an end.  We landed, and proceeded to Paris.  I soon\nfound that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before I\ncould continue my journey.  My father’s care and attentions were\nindefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and\nsought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill.  He wished me to\nseek amusement in society.  I abhorred the face of man.  Oh, not\nabhorred!  They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt\nattracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an\nangelic nature and celestial mechanism.  But I felt that I had no right\nto share their intercourse.  I had unchained an enemy among them whose\njoy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans.  How they\nwould, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world did they know\nmy unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me!",
        "My father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by\nvarious arguments to banish my despair.  Sometimes he thought that I\nfelt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of\nmurder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.",
        "“Alas!  My father,” said I, “how little do you know me.  Human beings,\ntheir feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such a wretch\nas I felt pride.  Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent as I,\nand she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause\nof this–I murdered her.  William, Justine, and Henry–they all died by\nmy hands.”",
        "My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same\nassertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an\nexplanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring\nof delirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had\npresented itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I\npreserved in my convalescence.",
        "I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence concerning the\nwretch I had created.  I had a persuasion that I should be supposed\nmad, and this in itself would forever have chained my tongue.  But,\nbesides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill\nmy hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the\ninmates of his breast.  I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for\nsympathy and was silent when I would have given the world to have\nconfided the fatal secret.  Yet, still, words like those I have\nrecorded would burst uncontrollably from me.  I could offer no\nexplanation of them, but their truth in part relieved the burden of my\nmysterious woe.  Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression\nof unbounded wonder, “My dearest Victor, what infatuation is this?  My\ndear son, I entreat you never to make such an assertion again.”",
        "“I am not mad,” I cried energetically; “the sun and the heavens, who\nhave viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth.  I am the\nassassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations. \nA thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have\nsaved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not\nsacrifice the whole human race.”",
        "The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were\nderanged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and\nendeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts.  He wished as much as\npossible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in\nIreland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my\nmisfortunes.",
        "As time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my\nheart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own\ncrimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them.  By the utmost\nself-violence I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which\nsometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world, and my manners\nwere calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey\nto the sea of ice.  A few days before we left Paris on our way to\nSwitzerland, I received the following letter from Elizabeth:",
        "     My dear Friend,",
        "     It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle\ndated at Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and I may\nhope to see you in less than a fortnight.  My poor cousin, how much you\nmust have suffered!  I expect to see you looking even more ill than\nwhen you quitted Geneva.  This winter has been passed most miserably,\ntortured as I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in\nyour countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of\ncomfort and tranquillity. ",
        "    Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so\nmiserable a year ago, even perhaps augmented by time.  I would not\ndisturb you at this period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you,\nbut a conversation that I had with my uncle previous to his departure\nrenders some explanation necessary before we meet.   Explanation!  You\nmay possibly say, What can Elizabeth have to explain?  If you really\nsay this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied.  But\nyou are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yet\nbe pleased with this explanation; and in a probability of this being\nthe case, I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your\nabsence, I have often wished to express to you but have never had the\ncourage to begin.",
        "     You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite\nplan of your parents ever since our infancy.  We were told this\nwhen young, and taught to look forward to it as an event that would\ncertainly take place.  We were affectionate playfellows during\nchildhood, and, I believe, dear and valued friends to one another\nas we grew older. But as brother and sister often entertain a\nlively affection towards each other without desiring a more\nintimate union, may not such also be our case?  Tell me, dearest\nVictor.  Answer me, I conjure you by our mutual happiness, with\nsimple truth–Do you not love another?",
        "     You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life\nat Ingolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you\nlast autumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of\nevery creature, I could not help supposing that you might regret\nour connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the\nwishes of your parents, although they opposed themselves to your\ninclinations.  But this is false reasoning.  I confess to you, my\nfriend, that I love you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you\nhave been my constant friend and companion.   But it is your\nhappiness I desire as well as my own when I declare to you that our\nmarriage would render me eternally miserable unless it were the\ndictate of your own free choice.  Even now I weep to think that,\nborne down as you are by the cruellest misfortunes, you may stifle,\nby the word “honour,” all hope of that love and happiness which\nwould alone restore you to yourself.  I, who have so  \ndisinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries\ntenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes.  Ah! Victor, be\nassured that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for\nyou not to be made miserable by this supposition.  Be happy, my\nfriend; and if you obey me in this one request, remain satisfied\nthat nothing on earth will have the power to interrupt my\ntranquillity.",
        "     Do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer tomorrow, \nor the next day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain.\nMy uncle will send me news of your health, and if I see but one\nsmile on your lips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other\nexertion of mine, I shall need no other happiness.",
        "                                                Elizabeth Lavenza",
        "    Geneva, May 18th, 17-",
        "This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the\nthreat of the fiend–\"I WILL BE WITH YOU ON YOUR WEDDING-NIGHT!” Such\nwas my sentence, and on that night would the daemon employ every art to\ndestroy me and tear me from the glimpse of happiness which promised\npartly to console my sufferings.  On that night he had determined to\nconsummate his crimes by my death.  Well, be it so; a deadly struggle\nwould then assuredly take place, in which if he were victorious I\nshould be at peace and his power over me be at an end.  If he were\nvanquished, I should be a free man.  Alas!  What freedom?  Such as the\npeasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his\ncottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless,\npenniless, and alone, but free. Such would be my liberty except that in\nmy Elizabeth I possessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors of\nremorse and guilt which would pursue me until death.",
        "Sweet and beloved Elizabeth!  I read and reread her letter, and some\nsoftened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal\ndreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the\nangel’s arm bared to drive me from all hope.  Yet I would die to make\nher happy.  If the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable;\nyet, again, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate.  My\ndestruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner, but if my torturer\nshould suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he would\nsurely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge.",
        "He had vowed TO BE WITH ME ON MY WEDDING-NIGHT, yet he did not consider\nthat threat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show\nme that he was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval\nimmediately after the enunciation of his threats.  I resolved,\ntherefore, that if my immediate union with my cousin would conduce\neither to hers or my father’s happiness, my adversary’s designs against\nmy life should not retard it a single hour.",
        "In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth.  My letter was calm and\naffectionate.  “I fear, my beloved girl,” I said, “little happiness\nremains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred in\nyou.  Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my life\nand my endeavours for contentment.  I have one secret, Elizabeth, a\ndreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with\nhorror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only\nwonder that I survive what I have endured.  I will confide this tale of\nmisery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place,\nfor, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us.  But\nuntil then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it.  This I most\nearnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.”",
        "In about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth’s letter we returned to\nGeneva.  The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears were\nin her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish  cheeks.  I\nsaw a change in her also.  She was thinner and had lost much of that\nheavenly vivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness and\nsoft looks of compassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted\nand miserable as I was.  The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not\nendure.  Memory brought madness with it, and when I thought of what had\npassed, a real insanity possessed me; sometimes I was furious and burnt\nwith rage, sometimes low and despondent.  I neither spoke nor looked at\nanyone, but sat motionless, bewildered by the multitude of miseries\nthat overcame me.",
        "Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle\nvoice would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with\nhuman feelings when sunk in torpor.  She wept with me and for me.  When\nreason returned, she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with\nresignation.  Ah!  It is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but\nfor the guilty there is no peace.  The agonies of remorse poison the\nluxury there is otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of\ngrief.  Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage\nwith Elizabeth.  I remained silent.",
        "“Have you, then, some other attachment?”",
        "“None on earth.  I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union with\ndelight.  Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate\nmyself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin.”",
        "“My dear Victor, do not speak thus.  Heavy misfortunes have befallen\nus, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love\nfor those whom we have lost to those who yet live.  Our circle will be\nsmall but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune. \nAnd when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of\ncare will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly\ndeprived.”",
        "Such were the lessons of my father.  But to me the remembrance of the\nthreat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had\nyet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as\ninvincible, and that when he had pronounced the words “I SHALL BE WITH\nYOU ON YOUR WEDDING-NIGHT,” I should regard the threatened fate as\nunavoidable.  But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were\nbalanced with it, and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful\ncountenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, the\nceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined,\nthe seal to my fate.",
        "Great God!  If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish\nintention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself\nforever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over\nthe earth than have consented to this miserable marriage.  But, as if\npossessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real\nintentions; and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, I\nhastened that of a far dearer victim.",
        "As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from\ncowardice or a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me.  But\nI concealed my feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought\nsmiles and joy to the countenance of my father, but hardly deceived the\neverwatchful and nicer eye of Elizabeth.  She looked forward to our\nunion with placid contentment, not unmingled with a little fear, which\npast misfortunes had impressed, that what now appeared certain and\ntangible happiness might soon dissipate into an airy dream and leave no\ntrace but deep and everlasting regret.  Preparations were made for the\nevent, congratulatory visits were received, and all wore a smiling\nappearance.  I shut up, as well as I could, in my own heart the anxiety\nthat preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness into the plans\nof my father, although they might only serve as the decorations of my\ntragedy.  Through my father’s exertions a part of the inheritance of\nElizabeth had been restored to her by the Austrian government.  A small\npossession on the shores of Como belonged to her.  It was agreed that,\nimmediately after our union, we should proceed to Villa Lavenza and\nspend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake near which\nit stood.",
        "In the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the\nfiend should openly attack me.  I carried pistols and a dagger\nconstantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and\nby these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity.  Indeed, as the\nperiod approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be\nregarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for\nin my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed\nfor its solemnization drew nearer and I heard it continually spoken of\nas an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.",
        "Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to\ncalm her mind.  But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my\ndestiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her;\nand perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I had\npromised to reveal to her on the following day.  My father was in the\nmeantime overjoyed and in the bustle of preparation only recognized in\nthe melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.",
        "After the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my\nfather’s, but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our\njourney by water, sleeping that night at Evian and continuing our\nvoyage on the following day.  The day was fair, the wind favourable;\nall smiled on our nuptial embarkation.",
        "Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the\nfeeling of happiness.  We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we\nwere sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the\nbeauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw\nMont Saleve, the pleasant banks of Montalegre, and at a distance,\nsurmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc and the assemblage of snowy\nmountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the\nopposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the\nambition that would quit its native country, and an almost\ninsurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.",
        "I took the hand of Elizabeth.  “You are sorrowful, my love.  Ah!  If\nyou knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you would\nendeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this\none day at least permits me to enjoy.”",
        "“Be happy, my dear Victor,” replied Elizabeth; “there is, I hope,\nnothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not\npainted in my face, my heart is contented.  Something whispers to me\nnot to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but I\nwill not listen to such a sinister voice.  Observe how fast we move\nalong and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise\nabove the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still more\ninteresting.  Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in\nthe clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at\nthe bottom.  What a divine day!  How happy and serene all nature\nappears!”",
        "Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all\nreflection upon melancholy subjects.  But her temper was fluctuating;\njoy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place\nto distraction and reverie.",
        "The sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and\nobserved its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the\nlower hills.  The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached\nthe amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary.  The\nspire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range\nof mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.",
        "The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity,\nsank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water\nand caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the\nshore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and\nhay.  The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched\nthe shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp\nme and cling to me forever.",
