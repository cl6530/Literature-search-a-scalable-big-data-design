        "[142] This fundamental ground is our preference of doing to thinking.\nNow this preference is a main element in our nature, and as we study\nit we find ourselves opening up a number of large questions on every\nside.",
        "Let me go back for a moment to what I have already quoted from Bishop\nWilson:–\"First, never go against the best light you have; secondly,\ntake care that your light be not darkness.”  I said we show, as a\nnation, laudable energy and persistence in walking according to the\nbest light we have, but are not quite careful enough, perhaps, to see\nthat our light be not darkness.  This is only another version of the\nold story that energy is our strong point and favourable\ncharacteristic, rather than intelligence.  But we may give to this\nidea a more general form still, in which it will have a yet larger\nrange of application.  We may regard this energy driving at practice,\nthis paramount sense of the obligation of duty, self-control, and\nwork, this earnestness in going manfully with the best light we [143]\nhave, as one force.  And we may regard the intelligence driving at\nthose ideas which are, after all, the basis of right practice, the\nardent sense for all the new and changing combinations of them which\nman’s development brings with it, the indomitable impulse to know and\nadjust them perfectly, as another force.  And these two forces we may\nregard as in some sense rivals,–rivals not by the necessity of their\nown nature, but as exhibited in man and his history,–and rivals\ndividing the empire of the world between them.  And to give these\nforces names from the two races of men who have supplied the most\nsignal and splendid manifestations of them, we may call them\nrespectively the forces of Hebraism and Hellenism.  Hebraism and\nHellenism,–between these two points of influence moves our world.\nAt one time it feels more powerfully the attraction of one of them,\nat another time of the other; and it ought to be, though it never is,\nevenly and happily balanced between them.",
        "The final aim of both Hellenism and Hebraism, as of all great\nspiritual disciplines, is no doubt the same: man’s perfection or\nsalvation.  The very language which they both of them use in\nschooling [144] us to reach this aim is often identical.  Even when\ntheir language indicates by variation,–sometimes a broad variation,\noften a but slight and subtle variation,–the different courses of\nthought which are uppermost in each discipline, even then the unity\nof the final end and aim is still apparent.  To employ the actual\nwords of that discipline with which we ourselves are all of us most\nfamiliar, and the words of which, therefore, come most home to us,\nthat final end and aim is “that we might be partakers of the divine\nnature.”  These are the words of a Hebrew apostle, but of Hellenism\nand Hebraism alike this is, I say, the aim.  When the two are\nconfronted, as they very often are confronted, it is nearly always\nwith what I may call a rhetorical purpose; the speaker’s whole design\nis to exalt and enthrone one of the two, and he uses the other only\nas a foil and to enable him the better to give effect to his purpose.\nObviously, with us, it is usually Hellenism which is thus reduced to\nminister to the triumph of Hebraism.  There is a sermon on Greece and\nthe Greek spirit by a man never to be mentioned without interest and\nrespect, Frederick Robertson, in which this rhetorical use of Greece\nand the Greek [145] spirit, and the inadequate exhibition of them\nnecessarily consequent upon this, is almost ludicrous, and would be\ncensurable if it were not to be explained by the exigences of a\nsermon.  On the other hand, Heinrich Heine, and other writers of his\nsort, give us the spectacle of the tables completely turned, and of\nHebraism brought in just as a foil and contrast to Hellenism, and to\nmake the superiority of Hellenism more manifest.  In both these cases\nthere is injustice and misrepresentation.  The aim and end of both\nHebraism and Hellenism is, as I have said, one and the same, and this\naim and end is august and admirable.",
        "Still, they pursue this aim by very different courses.  The uppermost\nidea with Hellenism is to see things as they really are; the\nuppermost idea with Hebraism is conduct and obedience.  Nothing can\ndo away with this ineffaceable difference; the Greek quarrel with the\nbody and its desires is, that they hinder right thinking, the Hebrew\nquarrel with them is, that they hinder right acting.  “He that\nkeepeth the law, happy is he;” “There is nothing sweeter than to take\nheed unto the commandments of the Lord;\"+–that is the Hebrew [146]\nnotion of felicity; and, pursued with passion and tenacity, this\nnotion would not let the Hebrew rest till, as is well known, he had,\nat last, got out of the law a network of prescriptions to enwrap his\nwhole life, to govern every moment of it, every impulse, every\naction.  The Greek notion of felicity, on the other hand, is\nperfectly conveyed in these words of a great French moralist: “C’est\nle bonheur des hommes\"–when? when they abhor that which is evil?–\nno; when they exercise themselves in the law of the Lord day and\nnight?–no; when they die daily?–no; when they walk about the New\nJerusalem with palms in their hands?–no; but when they think aright,\nwhen their thought hits,–\"quand ils pensent juste.”  At the bottom\nof both the Greek and the Hebrew notion is the desire, native in man,\nfor reason and the will of God, the feeling after the universal\norder,–in a word, the love of God.  But, while Hebraism seizes upon\ncertain plain, capital intimations of the universal order, and rivets\nitself, one may say, with unequalled grandeur of earnestness and\nintensity on the study and observance of them, the bent of Hellenism\nis to follow, with flexible activity, the whole play of the universal\norder, to be [147] apprehensive of missing any part of it, of\nsacrificing one part to another, to slip away from resting in this or\nthat intimation of it, however capital.  An unclouded clearness of\nmind, an unimpeded play of thought, is what this bent drives at.  The\ngoverning idea of Hellenism is spontaneity of consciousness; that of\nHebraism, strictness of conscience.",
        "Christianity changed nothing in this essential bent of Hebraism to\nset doing above knowing.  Self-conquest, self-devotion, the following\nnot our own individual will, but the will of God, obedience, is the\nfundamental idea of this form, also, of the discipline to which we\nhave attached the general name of Hebraism.  Only, as the old law and\nthe network of prescriptions with which it enveloped human life were\nevidently a motive power not driving and searching enough to produce\nthe result aimed at,–patient continuance in well doing, self-\nconquest,–Christianity substituted for them boundless devotion to\nthat inspiring and affecting pattern of self-conquest offered by\nChrist; and by the new motive power, of which the essence was this,\nthough the love and admiration of Christian churches have for\ncenturies been employed in varying, amplifying, [148] and adorning\nthe plain description of it, Christianity, as St. Paul truly says,\n“establishes the law,\"+ and in the strength of the ampler power which\nshe has thus supplied to fulfil it, has accomplished the miracles,\nwhich we all see, of her history.",
        "So long as we do not forget that both Hellenism and Hebraism are\nprofound and admirable manifestations of man’s life, tendencies, and\npowers, and that both of them aim at a like final result, we can\nhardly insist too strongly on the divergence of line and of operation\nwith which they proceed.  It is a divergence so great that it most\ntruly, as the prophet Zechariah says, “has raised up thy sons, O\nZion, against thy sons, O Greece!\"+  The difference whether it is by\ndoing or by knowing that we set most store, and the practical\nconsequences which follow from this difference, leave their mark on\nall the history of our race and of its development.  Language may be\nabundantly quoted from both Hellenism and Hebraism to make it seem\nthat one follows the same current as the other towards the same goal.\nThey are, truly, borne towards the same goal; but the currents which\nbear them are infinitely different.  It is true, Solomon will praise\n[149] knowing: “Understanding is a well-spring of life unto him that\nhath it.\"+  And in the New Testament, again, Christ is a “light,\"+ and\n“truth makes us free.\"+  It is true, Aristotle will undervalue\nknowing: “In what concerns virtue,” says he, “three things are\nnecessary,–knowledge, deliberate will, and perseverance; but,\nwhereas the two last are all important, the first is a matter of\nlittle importance.”  It is true that with the same impatience with\nwhich St. James enjoins a man to be not a forgetful hearer, but a\ndoer of the work,+ Epictetus exhorts us to do what we have\ndemonstrated to ourselves we ought to do; or he taunts us with\nfutility, for being armed at all points to prove that lying is wrong,\nyet all the time continuing to lie.  It is true, Plato, in words\nwhich are almost the words of the New Testament or the Imitation,\ncalls life a learning to die.  But underneath the superficial\nagreement the fundamental divergence still subsists.  The\nunderstanding of Solomon is “the walking in the way of the\ncommandments;” this is “the way of peace,\"+ and it is of this that\nblessedness comes.  In the New Testament, the truth which gives us\nthe peace of God and makes us free, is the love of Christ\nconstraining [150] us to crucify, as he did, and with a like purpose\nof moral regeneration, the flesh with its affections and lusts, and\nthus establishing, as we have seen, the law.  To St. Paul it appears\npossible to “hold the truth in unrighteousness,\"+ which is just what\nSocrates judged impossible.  The moral virtues, on the other hand,\nare with Aristotle but the porch and access to the intellectual, and\nwith these last is blessedness.  That partaking of the divine life,\nwhich both Hellenism and Hebraism, as we have said, fix as their\ncrowning aim, Plato expressly denies to the man of practical virtue\nmerely, of self-conquest with any other motive than that of perfect\nintellectual vision; he reserves it for the lover of pure knowledge,\nof seeing things as they really are,–the philomathês.+",
        "Both Hellenism and Hebraism arise out of the wants of human nature,\nand address themselves to satisfying those wants.  But their methods\nare so different, they lay stress on such different points, and call\ninto being by their respective disciplines such different activities,\nthat the face which human nature presents when it passes from the\nhands of one of them to those of the other, is no longer the [151]\nsame.  To get rid of one’s ignorance, to see things as they are, and\nby seeing them as they are to see them in their beauty, is the simple\nand attractive ideal which Hellenism holds out before human nature;\nand from the simplicity and charm of this ideal, Hellenism, and human\nlife in the hands of Hellenism, is invested with a kind of aërial\nease, clearness, and radiancy; they are full of what we call\nsweetness and light.  Difficulties are kept out of view, and the\nbeauty and rationalness of the ideal have all our thoughts.  “The\nbest man is he who most tries to perfect himself, and the happiest\nman is he who most feels that he is perfecting himself,\"–this\naccount of the matter by Socrates, the true Socrates of the\nMemorabilia, has something so simple, spontaneous, and\nunsophisticated about it, that it seems to fill us with clearness and\nhope when we hear it.  But there is a saying which I have heard\nattributed to Mr. Carlyle about Socrates,–a very happy saying,\nwhether it is really Mr. Carlyle’s or not,–which excellently marks\nthe essential point in which Hebraism differs from Hellenism.\n“Socrates,” this saying goes, “is terribly at ease in Zion\"\nHebraism,–and here is the source of its [152] wonderful strength,–\nhas always been severely preoccupied with an awful sense of the\nimpossibility of being at ease in Zion; of the difficulties which\noppose themselves to man’s pursuit or attainment of that perfection\nof which Socrates talks so hopefully, and, as from this point of view\none might almost say, so glibly.  It is all very well to talk of\ngetting rid of one’s ignorance, of seeing things in their reality,\nseeing them in their beauty; but how is this to be done when there is\nsomething which thwarts and spoils all our efforts?  This something\nis sin; and the space which sin fills in Hebraism, as compared with\nHellenism, is indeed prodigious.  This obstacle to perfection fills\nthe whole scene, and perfection appears remote and rising away from\nearth, in the background.  Under the name of sin, the difficulties of\nknowing oneself and conquering oneself which impede man’s passage to\nperfection, become, for Hebraism, a positive, active entity hostile\nto man, a mysterious power which I heard Dr. Pusey the other day, in\none of his impressive sermons, compare to a hideous hunchback seated\non our shoulders, and which it is the main business of our lives to\nhate and oppose.  The discipline of the [153] Old Testament may be\nsummed up as a discipline teaching us to abhor and flee from sin; the\ndiscipline of the New Testament, as a discipline teaching us to die\nto it.  As Hellenism speaks of thinking clearly, seeing things in\ntheir essence and beauty, as a grand and precious feat for man to\nachieve, so Hebraism speaks of becoming conscious of sin, of\nawakening to a sense of sin, as a feat of this kind.  It is obvious\nto what wide divergence these differing tendencies, actively\nfollowed, must lead.  As one passes and repasses from Hellenism to\nHebraism, from Plato to St. Paul, one feels inclined to rub one’s\neyes and ask oneself whether man is indeed a gentle and simple being,\nshowing the traces of a noble and divine nature; or an unhappy\nchained captive, labouring with groanings that cannot be uttered to\nfree himself from the body of this death.",
        "Apparently it was the Hellenic conception of human nature which was\nunsound, for the world could not live by it.  Absolutely to call it\nunsound, however, is to fall into the common error of its Hebraising\nenemies; but it was unsound at that particular moment of man’s\ndevelopment, it was premature.  The indispensable basis of conduct\nand [154] self-control, the platform upon which alone the perfection\naimed at by Greece can come into bloom, was not to be reached by our\nrace so easily; centuries of probation and discipline were needed to\nbring us to it.  Therefore the bright promise of Hellenism faded, and\nHebraism ruled the world.  Then was seen that astonishing spectacle,\nso well marked by the often quoted words of the prophet Zechariah,\nwhen men of all languages of the nations took hold of the skirt of\nhim that was a Jew, saying:–\"We will go with you, for we have heard\nthat God is with you.\"+  And the Hebraism which thus received and\nruled a world all gone out of the way and altogether become\nunprofitable, was, and could not but be, the later, the more\nspiritual, the more attractive development of Hebraism.  It was\nChristianity; that is to say, Hebraism aiming at self-conquest and\nrescue from the thrall of vile affections, not by obedience to the\nletter of a law, but by conformity to the image of a self-sacrificing\nexample.  To a world stricken with moral enervation Christianity\noffered its spectacle of an inspired self-sacrifice; to men who\nrefused themselves nothing, it showed one who refused [155] himself\neverything;–\"my Saviour banished joy” says George Herbert.  When the\nalma Venus, the life-giving and joy-giving power of nature, so fondly\ncherished by the Pagan world, could not save her followers from self-\ndissatisfaction and ennui, the severe words of the apostle came\nbracingly and refreshingly: “Let no man deceive you with vain words,\nfor because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children\nof disobedience.\"+  Throughout age after age, and generation after\ngeneration, our race, or all that part of our race which was most\nliving and progressive, was baptized into a death;+ and endeavoured,\nby suffering in the flesh, to cease from sin.  Of this endeavour, the\nanimating labours and afflictions of early Christianity, the touching\nasceticism of mediaeval Christianity, are the great historical\nmanifestations.  Literary monuments of it, each, in its own way,\nincomparable, remain in the Epistles of St. Paul, in St. Augustine’s\nConfessions, and in the two original and simplest books of the\nImitation.*",
        "Of two disciplines laying their main stress, the [156] one, on clear\nintelligence, the other, on firm obedience; the one, on\ncomprehensively knowing the grounds of one’s duty, the other, on\ndiligently practising it; the one on taking all possible care (to use\nBishop Wilson’s words again) that the light we have be not darkness,\nthe other, that according to the best light we have we diligently\nwalk,–the priority naturally belongs to that discipline which braces\nman’s moral powers, and founds for him an indispensable basis of\ncharacter.  And, therefore, it is justly said of the Jewish people,\nwho were charged with setting powerfully forth that side of the\ndivine order to which the words conscience and self-conquest point,\nthat they were “entrusted with the oracles of God;\"+ as it is justly\nsaid of Christianity, which followed Judaism and which set forth this\nside with a much deeper effectiveness and a much wider influence,\nthat the wisdom of the old Pagan world was foolishness compared to\nit.  No words of devotion and admiration can be too strong to render\nthanks to these beneficent forces which have so borne forward\nhumanity in its appointed work of coming to the knowledge and\npossession of itself; above all, in those great [157] moments when\ntheir action was the wholesomest and the most necessary.",
        "But the evolution of these forces, separately and in themselves, is\nnot the whole evolution of humanity,–their single history is not the\nwhole history of man; whereas their admirers are always apt to make\nit stand for the whole history.  Hebraism and Hellenism are, neither\nof them, the law of human development, as their admirers are prone to\nmake them; they are, each of them, contributions to human\ndevelopment,–august contributions, invaluable contributions; and\neach showing itself to us more august, more invaluable, more\npreponderant over the other, according to the moment in which we take\nthem, and the relation in which we stand to them.  The nations of our\nmodern world, children of that immense and salutary movement which\nbroke up the Pagan world, inevitably stand to Hellenism in a relation\nwhich dwarfs it, and to Hebraism in a relation which magnifies it.\nThey are inevitably prone to take Hebraism as the law of human\ndevelopment, and not as simply a contribution to it, however\nprecious.  And yet the lesson must perforce be [158] learned, that\nthe human spirit is wider than the most priceless of the forces which\nbear it onward, and that to the whole development of man Hebraism\nitself is, like Hellenism, but a contribution.",
        "Perhaps we may help ourselves to see this clearer by an illustration\ndrawn from the treatment of a single great idea which has profoundly\nengaged the human spirit, and has given it eminent opportunities for\nshowing its nobleness and energy.  It surely must be perceived that\nthe idea of the immortality of the soul, as this idea rises in its\ngenerality before the human spirit, is something grander, truer, and\nmore satisfying, than it is in the particular forms by which St.\nPaul, in the famous fifteenth chapter of the Epistle to the\nCorinthians,+ and Plato, in the Phaedo, endeavour to develope and\nestablish it.  Surely we cannot but feel, that the argumentation with\nwhich the Hebrew apostle goes about to expound this great idea is,\nafter all, confused and inconclusive; and that the reasoning, drawn\nfrom analogies of likeness and equality, which is employed upon it by\nthe Greek philosopher, is over-subtle and sterile?  Above and beyond\nthe inadequate solutions which Hebraism and Hellenism here attempt,\nextends the immense [159] and august problem itself, and the human\nspirit which gave birth to it.  And this single illustration may\nsuggest to us how the same thing happens in other cases also.",
        "But meanwhile, by alternations of Hebraism and Hellenism, of man’s\nintellectual and moral impulses, of the effort to see things as they\nreally are, and the effort to win peace by self-conquest, the human\nspirit proceeds, and each of these two forces has its appointed hours\nof culmination and seasons of rule.  As the great movement of\nChristianity was a triumph of Hebraism and man’s moral impulses, so\nthe great movement which goes by the name of the Renascence* was an\nuprising and re-instatement of man’s intellectual impulses and of\nHellenism.  We in England, the devoted children of Protestantism,\nchiefly know the Renascence by its subordinate and secondary side of\nthe Reformation.  The Reformation has been often called a Hebraising\nrevival, a return to the ardour and sincereness of primitive [160]\nChristianity.  No one, however, can study the development of\nProtestantism and of Protestant churches without feeling that into\nthe Reformation too,–Hebraising child of the Renascence and\noffspring of its fervour, rather than its intelligence, as it\nundoubtedly was,–the subtle Hellenic leaven of the Renascence found\nits way, and that the exact respective parts in the Reformation, of\nHebraism and of Hellenism, are not easy to separate.  But what we may\nwith truth say is, that all which Protestantism was to itself clearly\nconscious of, all which it succeeded in clearly setting forth in\nwords, had the characters of Hebraism rather than of Hellenism.  The\nReformation was strong, in that it was an earnest return to the Bible\nand to doing from the heart the will of God as there written; it was\nweak, in that it never consciously grasped or applied the central\nidea of the Renascence,–the Hellenic idea of pursuing, in all lines\nof activity, the law and science, to use Plato’s words, of things as\nthey really are.  Whatever direct superiority, therefore,\nProtestantism had over Catholicism was a moral superiority, a\nsuperiority arising out of its greater sincerity and earnestness,–at\nthe moment of its apparition at any [161] rate,–in dealing with the\nheart and conscience; its pretensions to an intellectual superiority\nare in general quite illusory.  For Hellenism, for the thinking side\nin man as distinguished from the acting side, the attitude of mind of\nProtestantism towards the Bible in no respect differs from the\nattitude of mind of Catholicism towards the Church.  The mental habit\nof him who imagines that Balaam’s ass spoke, in no respect differs\nfrom the mental habit of him who imagines that a Madonna of wood or\nstone winked; and the one, who says that God’s Church makes him\nbelieve what he believes, and the other, who says that God’s Word\nmakes him believe what he believes, are for the philosopher perfectly\nalike in not really and truly knowing, when they say God’s Church and\nGod’s Word, what it is they say, or whereof they affirm.",
        "In the sixteenth century, therefore, Hellenism re-entered the world,\nand again stood in presence of Hebraism,–a Hebraism renewed and\npurged.  Now, it has not been enough observed, how, in the\nseventeenth century, a fate befell Hellenism in some respects\nanalogous to that which befell it at the commencement of our era.\nThe Renascence, that [162] great re-awakening of Hellenism, that\nirresistible return of humanity to nature and to seeing things as\nthey are, which in art, in literature, and in physics, produced such\nsplendid fruits, had, like the anterior Hellenism of the Pagan world,\na side of moral weakness, and of relaxation or insensibility of the\nmoral fibre, which in Italy showed itself with the most startling\nplainness, but which in France, England, and other countries was very\napparent too.  Again this loss of spiritual balance, this exclusive\npreponderance given to man’s perceiving and knowing side, this\nunnatural defect of his feeling and acting side, provoked a reaction.\nLet us trace that reaction where it most nearly concerns us.",
        "Science has now made visible to everybody the great and pregnant\nelements of difference which lie in race, and in how signal a manner\nthey make the genius and history of an Indo-European people vary from\nthose of a Semitic people.  Hellenism is of Indo-European growth,\nHebraism is of Semitic growth; and we English, a nation of Indo-\nEuropean stock, seem to belong naturally to the movement of\nHellenism.  But nothing more strongly marks the essential unity of\nman than the affinities we can [163] perceive, in this point or that,\nbetween members of one family of peoples and members of another; and\nno affinity of this kind is more strongly marked than that likeness\nin the strength and prominence of the moral fibre, which,\nnotwithstanding immense elements of difference, knits in some special\nsort the genius and history of us English, and of our American\ndescendants across the Atlantic, to the genius and history of the\nHebrew people.  Puritanism, which has been so great a power in the\nEnglish nation, and in the strongest part of the English nation, was\noriginally the reaction, in the seventeenth century, of the\nconscience and moral sense of our race, against the moral\nindifference and lax rule of conduct which in the sixteenth century\ncame in with the Renascence.  It was a reaction of Hebraism against\nHellenism; and it powerfully manifested itself, as was natural, in a\npeople with much of what we call a Hebraising turn, with a signal\naffinity for the bent which was the master-bent of Hebrew life.\nEminently Indo-European by its humour, by the power it shows, through\nthis gift, of imaginatively acknowledging the multiform aspects of\nthe problem of life, and of thus getting itself unfixed from its own\nover- [164] certainty, of smiling at its own over-tenacity, our race\nhas yet (and a great part of its strength lies here), in matters of\npractical life and moral conduct, a strong share of the assuredness,\nthe tenacity, the intensity of the Hebrews.  This turn manifested\nitself in Puritanism, and has had a great part in shaping our history\nfor the last two hundred years.  Undoubtedly it checked and changed\namongst us that movement of the Renascence which we see producing in\nthe reign of Elizabeth such wonderful fruits; undoubtedly it stopped\nthe prominent rule and direct development of that order of ideas\nwhich we call by the name of Hellenism, and gave the first rank to a\ndifferent order of ideas.  Apparently, too, as we said of the former\ndefeat of Hellenism, if Hellenism was defeated, this shows that\nHellenism was imperfect, and that its ascendency at that moment would\nnot have been for the world’s good.",
        "Yet there is a very important difference between the defeat inflicted\non Hellenism by Christianity eighteen hundred years ago, and the\ncheck given to the Renascence by Puritanism.  The greatness of the\ndifference is well measured by the difference in force, beauty,\nsignificance and usefulness, between [165] primitive Christianity and\nProtestantism.  Eighteen hundred years ago it was altogether the hour\nof Hebraism; primitive Christianity was legitimately and truly the\nascendent force in the world at that time, and the way of mankind’s\nprogress lay through its full development.  Another hour in man’s\ndevelopment began in the fifteenth century, and the main road of his\nprogress then lay for a time through Hellenism.  Puritanism was no\nlonger the central current of the world’s progress, it was a side\nstream crossing the central current and checking it.  The cross and\nthe check may have been necessary and salutary, but that does not do\naway with the essential difference between the main stream of man’s\nadvance and a cross or side stream.  For more than two hundred years\nthe main stream of man’s advance has moved towards knowing himself\nand the world, seeing things as they are, spontaneity of\nconsciousness; the main impulse of a great part, and that the\nstrongest part, of our nation, has been towards strictness of\nconscience.  They have made the secondary the principal at the wrong\nmoment, and the principal they have at the wrong moment treated as\nsecondary.  This contravention of the [166] natural order has\nproduced, as such contravention always must produce, a certain\nconfusion and false movement, of which we are now beginning to feel,\nin almost every direction, the inconvenience.  In all directions our\nhabitual courses of action seem to be losing efficaciousness, credit,\nand control, both with others and even with ourselves; everywhere we\nsee the beginnings of confusion, and we want a clue to some sound\norder and authority.  This we can only get by going back upon the\nactual instincts and forces which rule our life, seeing them as they\nreally are, connecting them with other instincts and forces, and\nenlarging our whole view and rule of life.",
