        "This talk was originally given to Microsoft’s Research Group\nand other interested  parties from within the company at their\nRedmond offices on June 17, 2004.",
        "Jason Kottke’s audiobook edition as MP3.",
        "Plain text version.",
        "Greetings fellow pirates! Arrrrr!",
        "I’m here today to talk to you about copyright, technology and\nDRM, I work for the Electronic Frontier Foundation on copyright\nstuff (mostly), and I live in London. I’m not a lawyer – I’m a\nkind of mouthpiece/activist type, though occasionally they shave\nme and stuff me into my Bar Mitzvah suit and send me to a\nstandards body or the UN to stir up trouble. I spend about three\nweeks a month on the road doing completely weird stuff like going\nto Microsoft to talk about DRM.",
        "I lead a double life: I’m also a science fiction writer. That\nmeans I’ve got a dog in this fight, because I’ve been dreaming of\nmaking my living from writing since I was 12 years old.\nAdmittedly, my IP-based biz isn’t as big as yours, but I\nguarantee you that it’s every bit as important to me as yours is\nto you.",
        "Here’s what I’m here to convince you of:",
        "That DRM systems don’t work",
        "That DRM systems are bad for society",
        "That DRM systems are bad for business",
        "That DRM systems are bad for artists",
        "That DRM is a bad business-move for MSFT",
        "It’s a big brief, this talk. Microsoft has sunk a lot of capital\ninto DRM systems, and spent a lot of time sending folks like\nMartha and Brian and Peter around to various smoke-filled rooms\nto make sure that Microsoft DRM finds a hospitable home in the\nfuture world. Companies like Microsoft steer like old Buicks, and\nthis issue has a lot of forward momentum that will be hard to\nsoak up without driving the engine block back into the driver’s\ncompartment. At best I think that Microsoft might convert some of\nthat momentum on DRM into angular momentum, and in so doing, save\nall our asses.",
