        "On yonder side Rhine river / they saw a stately band,\nThe king and host of strangers, / ride down unto the strand,\nAnd also many a lady / sitting on charger led.\nBy those who should receive them / was goodly preparation made.",
        "580",
        "Soon they of Isenland / the ship had entered then,\nAnd with them Siegfried’s vassals / the Nibelungen men;\nThey strained unto the shore / with untiring hand\nWhen they beheld the monarch’s / friends upon the farther strand.",
        "581",
        "Now list ye eke the story / of the stately queen,\nUte, how at her bidding / ladies fair were seen\nForth coming from the castle / to ride her company.\nThen came to know each other / full many a knight and fair lady.",
        "582",
        "The Margrave Gere / but to the castle gate\nThe bridle held for Kriemhild; / the keen Siegfried did wait\nThenceforward upon her. / She was a beauteous maid.\nWell was the knight’s good service / by the lady since repaid.",
        "583",
        "Ortwein the valiant / Queen Ute rode beside,\nAnd many a knight full gallant / was stately lady’s guide.\nAt such a high reception, / that may we say, I ween,\nWas ne’er such host of ladies / in company together seen.",
        "584",
        "With show of rider’s talent / the tilt was carried on,\nFor might the knights full gallant / naught fitting leave undone,\nAs passed down to the river / Kriemhild the lady bright.\nThen helped was many a lady / fair from charger to alight.",
        "585",
        "The king had then come over / and many a stranger too.\nHeigh-ho! What strong shafts splintered / before the ladies flew!\nMany a shaft go crashing / heard you there on shield.\nHeigh-ho! What din of costly / arms resounded o’er the field.",
        "586",
        "The full lovely maidens / upon the shore did stand,\nAs Gunther with the strangers / stepped upon the land;\nHe himself did Brunhild / by the hand lead on.\nThen sparkled towards each other / rich dress and many a shining stone.",
        "587",
        "Then went Lady Kriemhild / with fullest courtesy due,\nTo greet the Lady Brunhild / and her retinue.\nAnd saw ye each the head-band / with fair hand move aside\nWhen they kissed each other: / high courtesy did the ladies guide.",
        "588",
        "Then spake the maiden Kriemhild, / a high-born lady she:\n“Unto this our country / shalt thou right welcome be,\nTo me and to my mother / and each true friend of mine,\nThat we here have with us.\" / Then each did unto each incline.",
        "589",
        "Within their arms the ladies / oft-times clasped each other.\nLike this fond reception / heard ye of ne’er another,\nAs when both the ladies / there the bride did greet,\nQueen Ute and her daughter; / oft-times they kissed her lips so sweet.",
        "590",
        "When all of Brunhild’s ladies / were come upon the strand,\nThen was there taken / full fondly by the hand\nBy the warriors stately / many a fair lady.\nBefore the Lady Brunhild / the train of fair maids might ye see.",
        "591",
        "Before their greetings ended / a mickle time was gone,\nFor lips of rosy color / were kissed there, many a one.\nLong stood they together, / the royal ladies high,\nAnd so to look upon them / pleased many a noble warrior’s eye.",
        "592",
        "Then spied with probing eye, too, / who before did hear\nThat till then was never / aught beheld so fair,\nAs those two royal ladies: / they found it was no lie.\nIn all their person might ye / no manner of deceit espy.",
        "593",
        "Who there could spy fair ladies / and judge of beauty rare,\nThey praised the wife of Gunther / that she was passing fair;\nYet spake again the wise men / who looked with keener gaze,\nThey rather would to Kriemhild / before Brunhild award the praise.",
        "594",
        "Then went unto each other / maid and fair lady.\nFull many a fair one might ye / in rich adornment see.\nThere stood rich tents a many, / silken great and small,\nWherewith in every quarter / ’fore Worms the field was covered all.",
        "595",
        "Of the king’s high kindred / a mighty press there was.\nThen bade they Brunhild / and Kriemhild on to pass,\nAnd with them all the ladies, / where they in shade might be.\nThither did bring them warriors / of the land of Burgundy.",
        "596",
        "When now the strangers also / on horse sat every one,\nPlenteous knightly tilting / at shield was there begun.\nAbove the field rose dust-clouds, / as had the country been\nAll in flames a-burning; / who bore the honors there was seen.",
        "597",
        "Looked on full many a maiden / as the knights did sport them so.\nMeseemeth that Sir Siegfried / full many a to-and-fro\nDid ride with his good followers / along ’fore many a tent.\nWith him of Nibelungen / a thousand stately men there went.",
        "598",
        "Then came of Tronje Hagen, / whom the king did send;\nHe bade in pleasing manner / the tourney have an end,\nBefore in dust be buried / all the ladies fair.\nAnd ready to obey him / soon the courteous strangers were.",
        "599",
        "Then spake Sir Gernot: / “Now let the chargers stand,\nUntil the air is cooler, / for we must be at hand\nAs escort for fair ladies / unto the stately hall;\nAnd will the king take saddle, / so let him find you ready all.”",
        "600",
        "When now the sound of tourney / o’er all the field was spent,\nThen went for pleasant pastime / ’neath many a lofty tent\nThe knights unto the ladies, / and willing thither hied.\nAnd there they passed the hours / till such time as they thence should\n      ride.",
        "601",
        "Just before the evening / when the sun was in the west,\nAnd the air grew cooler, / no longer did they rest,\nBut both knights and ladies / unto the castle passed.\nAnd eyes in loving glances / on many a beauteous maid were cast.",
        "602",
        "By hand of goodly warrior / many a coat was rent,\nFor in the country’s custom / they tourneyed as they went,\nUntil before the palace / the monarch did dismount.\nThey tended fairest ladies / as knights high-spirited are wont.",
        "603",
        "After fairest greeting / the queens did part again.\nDame Ute and her daughter, / thither passed the twain\nWith train of fair attendants / unto a hall full wide.\nDin of merrymaking / heard ye there on every side.",
        "604",
        "Arranged were sitting-places / where the king would be\nWith his guests at table. / By him might ye see\nStanding the fair Brunhild. / She wore a royal crown\nIn the monarch’s country, / the which might well such mistress own.",
        "605",
        "Seats for all the people / at many a spacious board\nThere were, as saith the story, / where victuals rich were stored.\nHow little there was lacking / of all that makes a feast!\nAnd by the monarch saw ye / sitting many a stately guest.",
        "606",
        "The royal host’s attendants / in basins golden red\nCarried water forward. / And should it e’er be said\nBy any that a better / service did receive\nEver guests of monarch, / I never could such thing believe.",
        "607",
        "Before the lord of Rhineland / with water was waited on,\nUnto him Sir Siegfried, / as fitting was, had gone;\nHe called to mind a promise / that made by him had been\nEre that the Lady Brunhild / afar in Isenland he’d seen.",
        "608",
        "He spake: “Thou shalt bethink thee / what once did plight thy hand,\nIf that the Lady Brunhild / should come unto this land,\nThou’dst give to me thy sister. / Where now what thou hast sworn?\nIn this thy wooing journey / not small the labor I have borne.”",
        "609",
        "Then to his guest the monarch: / “Well hast thou minded me,\nAnd by this hand shall never / false word plighted be.\nTo gain thy wish I’d help thee / in the way as best I know.\"\nBidden then was Kriemhild / forth unto the king to go.",
        "610",
        "With her full beauteous maidens / unto the Hall she passed.\nThen sprang the youthful Giselher / adown the steps in haste\n“Bid now these many maidens / wend their way again;\nNone but my sister only / unto the king shall enter in.”",
        "611",
        "Then led they Kriemhild thither / where the king was found,\nWith him were knights full noble / from many a land around.\nWithin that Hall so spacious / she waited the king’s behest,\nWhat time the Lady Brunhild / betook her likewise to the feast.",
        "612",
        "Then spake the royal Gunther: / “Sister mine full fair,\nRedeem the word I’ve given, / an hold’st thou virtue dear.\nThee to a knight I plighted: / An tak’st thou him to man,\nThereby my wish full truly / unto the warrior hast thou done.”",
        "613",
        "Then spake the noble maiden: / “Brother full dear to me,\nNot long shalt thou entreat me. / In truth I’ll ever be\nObedient to thy bidding; / that shall now be done,\nAnd him I’ll take full gladly, / my Lord, whom thou giv’st me for man.”",
        "614",
        "Before those fair eyes’ glances / grew Siegfried’s color red.\nThe knight to Lady Kriemhild / his service offered.\nWithin a ring together / then were led the twain,\nAnd they asked the maiden, / if she to take the knight were fain.",
        "615",
        "Upon her face not little / was the modest glow;\nNathless to joy of Siegfried / did fortune will it so,\nThat the maiden would not / refuse the knight her hand.\nEke swore his wife to make her / the noble king of Netherland.",
        "616",
        "When he to her had plighted, / and eke to him the maid,\nSiegfried to embrace her / nothing more delayed,\nBut clasped in arms full fondly / and oft the lady fair,\nAnd stately knights were witness / how that he kissed the princess there.",
        "617",
        "When that the maids attendant / from thence had ta’en their leave,\nIn place of honor seated / Siegfried might ye perceive\nAnd by him fairest Kriemhild; / and many a knight at hand\nWas seen of the Nibelungen / at Siegfried’s service ready stand.",
        "618",
        "There too was Gunther seated / and with him Queen Brunhild.\nAt sight of Kriemhild sitting / by Siegfried was she filled\nWith anger such as never / before her heart did swell:\nShe wept, and tears in plenty / adown her shining face there fell.",
        "619",
        "Then spake who ruled the country: / “What aileth, lady mine,\nThat so thou let’st be dimmed / thine eyes that brightly shine?\nBe straight of joyous spirit, / for now at thy command\nMy land and my good castles / and host of stately warriors stand.”",
        "620",
        "“Good cause to me for weeping,\" / spake the lady fair.\n“For sake of this thy sister / sorrow now I bear,\nWhom here behold I seated / by one that serveth thee.\nThat must forever grieve me, / shall she thus dishonored be.”",
        "621",
        "Then answered her King Gunther: / “But for the nonce be still.\nAt other time more fitting / the thing to thee I’ll tell,\nWherefore thus my sister / to Siegfried I did give.\nAnd truly with the hero / may she ever joyous live.”",
        "622",
        "She spake: “Her name and beauty / thus lost it grieveth me.\nAn knew I only whither, / from hence I’d surely flee,\nThis night nor e’er hereafter / to share thy royal bed,\nSay’st thou not truly wherefore / Kriemhild thus hath Siegfried wed.”",
        "623",
        "Then spake the noble monarch: / “Then unto thee be known\nThat he as stately castles, / lands wide as I, doth own.\nAnd know thou that full surely / a mighty monarch he;\nWherefore the fairest maiden / I grant him thus his wife to be.”",
        "624",
        "Whate’er the king did tell her, / sad was she yet of mood.\nThen hastened from the tables / full many a warrior good,\nAnd jousted that the castle / walls gave back the din.\nAmid his guests the monarch / waiting longingly was seen.",
        "625",
        "He deemed ’twere better lying / beside his fair lady.\nOf thinking on that plaisance / his mind he could not free,\nAnd what her love would bring him / before the night be past;\nHe many a glance full tender / upon the Lady Brunhild cast.",
        "626",
        "The guests they bade give over / in joust who combated,\nFor that with spouse new-wedded / the monarch would to bed.\nLeaving then the banquet, / there together met\nKriemhild and Brunhild: / their bitter hate was silent yet.",
        "627",
        "At hand were their attendants; / they longer tarried not,\nAnd chamberlains full lordly / lights for them had brought.\nThen parted eke the followers / of the monarchs twain,\nAnd bearing Siegfried company / went full many a worthy thane.",
        "628",
        "The lords were both come thither / where that they should lie.\nAs each one bethought him / of loving victory\nTo win o’er winsome lady, / merry he grew of mood.\nThe noble Siegfried’s pastime / it was beyond all measure good.",
        "629",
        "As there Sir Siegfried / by fair Kriemhild lay\nAnd to the maid devoted / himself in such fond way\nAs noble knight beseemeth, / they twain to him were one,\nAnd not a thousand others / had he then ta’en for her alone.",
        "630",
        "I’ll tell you now no further / how he the lady plied,\nBut list ye first the story / what Gunther did betide\nBy Lady Brunhild lying. / In sooth the noble thane\nBy side of other ladies / a deal more happily had lain.",
        "631",
        "Withdrawn were now attendants, / man and also maid;\nNot long to lock the chamber / within the king delayed.\nHe weened to have good pleasure / of that fair lady,\nYet was the time still distant / when that she his wife should be.",
        "632",
        "In gown of whitest linen / unto the bed she passed.\nThen thought the knight full noble: / “Now have I here at last\nAll that I e’er desired / as long as I can tell.\"\nPerforce her stately beauty / did please the monarch passing well.",
        "633",
        "That they should shine more dimly / he placed the lights aside,\nThen where did lie the lady / the thane full eager hied.\nHe placed himself a-nigh her, / his joy right great it was,\nAs in his arms the monarch / the winsome maid did there embrace.",
        "634",
        "A loving plaisance had he / with vigor there begun\nIf that the noble lady / had let the same be done.\nShe then did rage so sorely / that grieved was he thereat;\nHe weened to find who loved him, / –instead he found him naught but\n      hate.",
        "635",
        "Spake she: “Good knight and noble, / from this thing give o’er.\nThat which thou here hast hope of, / it may be nevermore.\nA maid I still will keep me / –well mayest thou know that–\nUntil I learn that story.\" / Gunther wrathy grew thereat.",
        "636",
        "Her gown he wrought to ruin / to win her maidenhead.\nWhereat did seize a girdle / the full stately maid,\nA strong and silken girdle / that round her sides she wore,\nAnd with the same the monarch / she soon had brought to pains full sore.",
        "637",
        "His feet and his hands also, / together bound she all,\nUnto a nail she bore him / and hung him on the wall.\nHim who disturbed her sleeping / in his love she sorely let,\nAnd from her mighty prowess, / he full nigh his death had met.",
        "638",
        "Then gan he to entreat her, / who master late had been.\n“From these my bonds now loose me, / my full noble queen.\nNor trow I e’er, fair lady, / victor o’er thee to be,\nAnd henceforth will I seldom / seek to lie thus nigh to thee.”",
        "639",
        "She recked not how ’twere with him, / as she full softly lay.\nThere hung he, will he nill he, / the night through unto day,\nUntil the light of morning / through the windows shone.\nCould he e’er boast of prowess, / small now the measure he did own.",
        "640",
        "“Now tell me, lordly Gunther, / wert thou thereat so sad,\nIf that in bonds should find thee\" / –spake the fairest maid–\n“Thy royal men-in-waiting, / bound by lady’s hand?\"\nThen spake the knight full noble: / “Thou should’st in case most evil\n      stand.",
        "641",
        "“Eke had I little honor / therefrom,” continued he.\n“For all thy royal honor / let me then go to thee.\nSince that my fond embracements / do anger thee so sore,\nWith these my hands I pledge thee / to touch thy garment nevermore.”",
        "642",
        "Then she loosed him straightway / and he once more stood free.\nTo the bed he went as erstwhile / where rested his lady.\nBut far from her he laid him / and well he now forebore\nTo stir the lady’s anger / by touching e’en the gown she wore.",
        "643",
        "At length came their attendants / who garments fresh did bring,\nWhereof was ready for them / good store on that morning.\nYet merry as his folk were, / a visage sad did own\nThe lord of that proud country, / for all he wore that day a crown.",
        "644",
        "As was the country’s custom, / a thing folk do of right,\nGunther and Brunhild / presently were dight\nTo go unto the minster / where the mass was sung.\nThither eke came Siegfried, / and in their trains a mighty throng.",
        "645",
        "As fitted royal honor / for them was thither brought\nThe crown that each should carry / and garments richly wrought.\nThere were they consecrated; / and when the same was done,\nSaw ye the four together / happy stand and wearing crown.",
        "646",
        "There was knighted many a squire, / –six hundred or beyond–\nIn honor of the crowning, / that shall ye understand.\nArose full great rejoicing / in the land of Burgundy\nAs hand of youthful warrior / did shatter shaft right valiantly.",
        "647",
        "Then sat in castle casement / maidens fair to see,\nAnd many a shield beneath them / gleamed full brilliantly.\nYet himself had sundered / from all his men the king;\nThough joyous every other, / sad-visaged stood he sorrowing.",
        "648",
        "He and the doughty Siegfried, / how all unlike their mood!\nWell wist the thing did grieve him / that noble knight and good.\nHe went unto the monarch / and straight addressed him so:\n“This night how hast thou fared? / In friendship give thou me to know.”",
        "649",
        "To his guest the king gave answer: / “Than shame and scathe I’ve naught.\nThe devil’s dam I surely / into my house have brought.\nWhen as I thought to have her / she bound me like a thrall;\nUnto a nail she bore me / and hung me high upon the wall.",
        "650",
        "“There hung I sore in anguish / the night through until day\nEre that she would unbind me, / the while she softly lay!\nAnd hast thou friendly pity / know then the grief I bear.\"\nThen spake the doughty Siegfried: / “Such grieves me verily to hear.",
        "651",
        "“The which I’ll show thee truly, / wilt thou me not deny.\nI’ll bring it that to-night she / so near to thee shall lie\nThat she to meet thy wishes / shall tarry nevermore.\"\nThereat rejoice did Gunther / to think perchance his trials o’er.",
        "652",
        "Then further spake Sir Siegfried: / “With thee ’twill yet be right.\nI ween that all unequal / we twain have fared this night.\nTo me thy sister Kriemhild / dearer is than life;\nEke shall the Lady Brunhild / be yet this coming night thy wife.”",
        "653",
        "“I’ll come unto thy chamber / this night all secretly,\"\nSpake he, “and wrapped in mantle / invisible I’ll be,\nThat of this my cunning / naught shall any know;\nAnd thy attendants shalt thou / bid to their apartments go.",
        "654",
        "“The lights I’ll all extinguish / held by each page in hand,\nBy the which same token / shalt thou understand\nI present am to serve thee. / I’ll tame thy shrewish wife\nThat thou this night enjoy her, / else forfeit be my caitiff life.”",
        "655",
        "“An thou wilt truly leave me\" / –answered him the king–\n’My lady yet a maiden, / I joy o’er this same thing.\nSo do thou as thou willest; / and takest thou her life,\nE’en that I’ll let pass o’er me, / –to lose so terrible a wife.”",
        "656",
        "“Thereto,” spake then Siegfried, / “plight I word of mine,\nTo leave her yet a maiden. / A sister fair of thine\nIs to me before all women / I ever yet have seen.\"\nGunther believed right gladly / what had by Siegfried plighted been.",
        "657",
        "Meanwhile the merry pastime / with joy and zest went on.\nBut all the din and bustle / bade they soon be done,\nWhen band of fairest ladies / would pass unto the hall\n’Fore whom did royal chamberlains / bid backward stand the people all.",
        "658",
        "The chargers soon and riders / from castle court were sped.\nEach of the noble ladies / by bishop high was led,\nWhen that before the monarchs / they passed to banquet board,\nAnd in their train did follow / to table many a stately lord.",
        "659",
        "There sat the king all hopeful / and full of merriment;\nWhat him did promise Siegfried, / thereon his mind was bent.\nTo him as long as thirty / did seem that single day;\nTo plaisance with his lady, / thither turned his thought alway.",
        "660",
        "And scarce the time he bided / while that the feast did last.\nNow unto her chamber / the stately Brunhild passed,\nAnd for her couch did Kriemhild / likewise the table leave.\nBefore those royal ladies / what host ye saw of warriors brave!",
        "661",
        "Full soon thereafter Siegfried / sat right lovingly\nWith his fair wife beside him, / and naught but joy had he.\nHis hand she clasped full fondly / within her hand so white,\nUntil–and how she knew not– / he did vanish from her sight.",
        "662",
        "When she the knight did fondle, / and straightway saw him not,\nUnto her maids attendant / spake the queen distraught:\n“Meseemeth a mickle wonder / where now the king hath gone.\nHis hands in such weird fashion / who now from out mine own hath drawn?”",
        "663",
        "Yet further not she questioned. / Soon had he hither gone\nWhere with lights were standing / attendants many a one.\nThe same he did extinguish / in every page’s hand;\nThat Siegfried then was present / Gunther thereby did understand.",
        "664",
        "Well wist he what he would there; / so bade he thence be gone\nLadies and maids-in-waiting. / And when that was done,\nHimself the mighty monarch / fast did lock the door:\nTwo bolts all wrought securely / he quickly shoved the same before.",
        "665",
        "The lights behind the curtains / hid he presently.\nSoon a play was started / (for thus it had to be),\nBetwixt the doughty Siegfried / and the stately maid:\nThereat was royal Gunther / joyous alike and sad.",
        "666",
        "Siegfried there laid him / by the maid full near.\nSpake she: “Let be, now, Gunther, / an hast thou cause to fear\nThose troubles now repeated / which befell thee yesternight.\"\nAnd soon the valiant Siegfried / through the lady fell in sorry plight.",
        "667",
        "His voice did he keep under / and ne’er a word spake he.\nIntently listened Gunther, / and though he naught could see,\nYet knew he that in secret / nothing ’twixt them passed.\nIn sooth nor knight nor lady / upon the bed had mickle rest.",
        "668",
        "He did there as if Gunther / the mighty king he were,\nAnd in his arms he pressed her, / the maiden debonair.\nForth from the bed she hurled him / where a bench there stood,\nAnd head of valiant warrior / against a stool went ringing loud.",
        "669",
        "Up sprang again undaunted / the full doughty man,\nTo try for fortune better. / When he anew began\nPerforce to curb her fury, / fell he in trouble sore.\nI ween that ne’er a lady / did so defend herself before.",
        "670",
        "When he would not give over, / up the maid arose:\n“My gown so white thou never / thus shalt discompose.\nAnd this thy villain’s manner / shall sore by thee be paid,\nThe same I’ll teach thee truly,\" / further spake the buxom maid.",
        "671",
        "Within her arms she clasped him, / the full stately thane,\nAnd thought likewise to bind him, / as the king yestreen,\nThat she the night in quiet / upon her couch might lie.\nThat her dress he thus did rumple, / avenged the lady grievously.",
        "672",
        "What booted now his prowess / and eke his mickle might?\nHer sovereignty of body / she proved upon the knight;\nBy force of arm she bore him, / –’twixt wall and mighty chest\n(For so it e’en must happen) / him she all ungently pressed.",
        "673",
        "“Ah me!\"–so thought the hero– / “shall I now my life\nLose at hand of woman, / then will every wife\nEvermore hereafter / a shrewish temper show\nAgainst her lord’s good wishes, / who now such thing ne’er thinks to do.”",
        "674",
        "All heard the monarch meanwhile / and trembled for the man.\nSore ashamed was Siegfried, / and a-raging he began.\nWith might and main he struggled / again to make him free,\nEre which to sorest trouble / ’neath Lady Brunhild’s hand fell he.",
        "675",
        "Long space to him it seemed / ere Siegfried tamed her mood.\nShe grasped his hand so tightly / that ’neath the nails the blood\nOozed from the pressure, / which made the hero wince.\nYet the stately maiden / subdued he to obedience since.",
        "676",
        "Her unrestrained temper / that she so late displayed,\nAll overheard the monarch, / though ne’er a word he said.\n’Gainst the bed did press her Siegfried / that aloud she cried,\nUngentle was the treatment / that he meted to the bride.",
        "677",
        "Then grasped she for a girdle / that round her sides she wore,\nAnd thought therewith to bind him; / but her limbs and body o’er\nStrained beneath the vigor / that his strong arm displayed.\nSo was the struggle ended / –Gunther’s wife was vanquished.",
        "678",
        "She spake: “O noble monarch, / take not my life away.\nThe harm that I have done thee / full well will I repay.\nNo more thy royal embraces / by me shall be withstood,\nFor now I well have seen it, / thou canst be lord o’er woman’s mood.”",
        "679",
        "From the couch rose Siegfried, / lying he left the maid,\nAs if that he would from him / lay his clothes aside.\nHe drew from off her finger / a ring of golden sheen\nWithout that e’er perceived / his practice the full noble queen.",
        "680",
        "Thereto he took her girdle / that was all richly wrought:\nIf from wanton spirit / he did it, know I not.\nThe same he gave to Kriemhild: / the which did sorrow bear.\nThen lay by one another / Gunther and the maiden fair.",
        "681",
        "Hearty were his embraces / as such king became:\nPerforce must she relinquish / her anger and her shame.\nIn sooth not little pallid / within his arms she grew,\nAnd in that love-surrender / how waned her mighty prowess too!",
        "682",
        "Then was e’en she not stronger / than e’er another bride;\nHe lay with fond embraces / the beauteous dame beside.\nAnd had she struggled further, / avail how could it aught?\nGunther, when thus he clasped her, / such change upon her strength had\n      wrought.",
        "683",
        "And with right inward pleasure / she too beside him lay\nIn warmest love embracings / until the dawn of day!\nMeantime now had Siegfried / departure ta’en from there,\nAnd was full well received / by a lady debonair.",
        "684",
        "Her questioning he avoided / and all whereon she thought,\nAnd long time kept he secret / what he for her had brought,\nUntil in his own country / she wore a royal crown;\nYet what for her he destined, / how sure at last it was her own.",
        "685",
        "Upon the morn was Gunther / by far of better mood\nThan he had been before it; / joy thus did spread abroad\n’Mid host of knights full noble / that from his lands around\nTo his court had been invited, / and there most willing service found.",
        "686",
        "The merry time there lasted / until two weeks were spent,\nNor all the while did flag there / the din of merriment\nAnd every kind of joyance / that knight could e’er devise;\nWith lavish hand expended / the king thereto in fitting wise.",
        "687",
        "The noble monarch’s kinsmen / upon his high command\nBy gifts of gold and raiment / told forth his generous hand,\nBy steed and thereto silver / on minstrel oft bestowed.\nWho there did gift desire / departed thence in merry mood.",
        "688",
        "All the store of raiment / afar from Netherland,\nThe which had Siegfried’s thousand / warriors brought to hand\nUnto the Rhine there with them, / complete ’twas dealt away,\nAnd eke the steeds well saddled: / in sooth a lordly life led they.",
        "689",
        "Ere all the gifts so bounteous / were dealt the guests among,\nThey who would straightway homeward / did deem the waiting long.\nNe’er had guests of monarch / such goodly gifts before;\nAnd so as Gunther willed it / the merry feast at last was o’er.",
