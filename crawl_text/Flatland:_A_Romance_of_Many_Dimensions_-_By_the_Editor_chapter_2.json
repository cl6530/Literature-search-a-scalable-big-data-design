        "\nIf my poor Flatland friend retained the vigour of mind which he\nenjoyed when he began to compose these Memoirs, I should not now need\nto represent him in this preface, in which he desires, firstly,\nto return his thanks to his readers and critics in Spaceland,\nwhose appreciation has, with unexpected celerity, required a second\nedition of his work; secondly, to apologize for certain errors\nand misprints (for which, however, he is not entirely responsible);\nand, thirdly, to explain one or two misconceptions.  But he is not\nthe Square he once was.  Years of imprisonment, and the still heavier\nburden of general incredulity and mockery, have combined with\nthe natural decay of old age to erase from his mind many of\nthe thoughts and notions, and much also of the terminology,\nwhich he acquired during his short stay in Spaceland.  He has,\ntherefore, requested me to reply in his behalf to two special\nobjections, one of an intellectual, the other of a moral nature.",
        "The first objection is, that a Flatlander, seeing a Line,\nsees something that must be THICK to the eye as well as LONG\nto the eye (otherwise it would not be visible, if it had not\nsome thickness); and consequently he ought (it is argued)\nto acknowledge that his countrymen are not only long and broad,\nbut also (though doubtless in a very slight degree) THICK or HIGH.\nThis objection is plausible, and, to Spacelanders,\nalmost irresistible, so that, I confess, when I first heard it,\nI knew not what to reply.  But my poor old friend’s answer\nappears to me completely to meet it.",
        "“I admit,” said he — when I mentioned to him this objection —\n“I admit the truth of your critic’s facts, but I deny his conclusions.\nIt is true that we have really in Flatland a Third\nunrecognized Dimension called ’height’, just as it is also true\nthat you have really in Spaceland a Fourth unrecognized Dimension,\ncalled by no name at present, but which I will call ’extra-height’.\nBut we can no more take cognizance of our ’height’ than you can\nof your ’extra-height’.  Even I — who have been in Spaceland,\nand have had the privilege of understanding for twenty-four hours\nthe meaning of ’height’ — even I cannot now comprehend it,\nnor realize it by the sense of sight or by any process of reason;\nI can but apprehend it by faith.",
        "“The reason is obvious.  Dimension implies direction,\nimplies measurement, implies the more and the less.  Now,\nall our lines are EQUALLY and INFINITESIMALLY thick (or high,\nwhichever you like); consequently, there is nothing in them\nto lead our minds to the conception of that Dimension.\nNo ’delicate micrometer’ — as has been suggested by one too hasty\nSpaceland critic — would in the least avail us; for we should not\nknow WHAT TO MEASURE, NOR IN WHAT DIRECTION.  When we see a Line,\nwe see something that is long and BRIGHT; BRIGHTNESS,\nas well as length, is necessary to the existence of a Line;\nif the brightness vanishes, the Line is extinguished.  Hence,\nall my Flatland friends — when I talk to them about the unrecognized\nDimension which is somehow visible in a Line — say, ’Ah,\nyou mean BRIGHTNESS’:  and when I reply, ’No, I mean\na real Dimension’, they at once retort, ’Then measure it,\nor tell us in what direction it extends’; and this silences me,\nfor I can do neither.  Only yesterday, when the Chief Circle\n(in other words our High Priest) came to inspect the State Prison\nand paid me his seventh annual visit, and when for the seventh time\nhe put me the question, ’Was I any better?’ I tried to prove to him\nthat he was ’high’, as well as long and broad, although he did not\nknow it.  But what was his reply?  ’You say I am “high\"; measure my\n“high-ness” and I will believe you.’  What could I do?  How could I\nmeet his challenge?  I was crushed; and he left the room triumphant.",
        "“Does this still seem strange to you?  Then put yourself in\na similar position.  Suppose a person of the Fourth Dimension,\ncondescending to visit you, were to say, ’Whenever you open your eyes,\nyou see a Plane (which is of Two Dimensions) and you INFER\na Solid (which is of Three); but in reality you also see\n(though you do not recognize) a Fourth Dimension, which is not colour\nnor brightness nor anything of the kind, but a true Dimension,\nalthough I cannot point out to you its direction, nor can you\npossibly measure it.’  What would you say to such a visitor?\nWould not you have him locked up?  Well, that is my fate:\nand it is as natural for us Flatlanders to lock up a Square\nfor preaching the Third Dimension, as it is for you Spacelanders\nto lock up a Cube for preaching the Fourth.  Alas, how strong\na family likeness runs through blind and persecuting humanity\nin all Dimensions!  Points, Lines, Squares, Cubes, Extra-Cubes —\nwe are all liable to the same errors, all alike the Slaves\nof our respective Dimensional prejudices, as one of your\nSpaceland poets has said --",
        "     ’One touch of Nature makes all worlds akin’.”",
        "[Note:  The Author desires me to add, that the misconception of some\nof his critics on this matter has induced him to insert in his\ndialogue with the Sphere, certain remarks which have a bearing\non the point in question, and which he had previously omitted\nas being tedious and unnecessary.]",
        "On this point the defence of the Square seems to me to be impregnable.\nI wish I could say that his answer to the second (or moral) objection\nwas equally clear and cogent.  It has been objected that he is\na woman-hater; and as this objection has been vehemently urged\nby those whom Nature’s decree has constituted the somewhat larger half\nof the Spaceland race, I should like to remove it, so far as I can\nhonestly do so.  But the Square is so unaccustomed to the use\nof the moral terminology of Spaceland that I should be doing him\nan injustice if I were literally to transcribe his defence against\nthis charge.  Acting, therefore, as his interpreter and summarizer,\nI gather that in the course of an imprisonment of seven years\nhe has himself modified his own personal views, both as regards Women\nand as regards the Isosceles or Lower Classes.  Personally,\nhe now inclines to the opinion of the Sphere that the Straight Lines\nare in many important respects superior to the Circles.\nBut, writing as a Historian, he has identified himself\n(perhaps too closely) with the views generally adopted by Flatland,\nand (as he has been informed) even by Spaceland, Historians;\nin whose pages (until very recent times) the destinies of Women\nand of the masses of mankind have seldom been deemed worthy of mention\nand never of careful consideration.",
        "In a still more obscure passage he now desires to disavow the Circular\nor aristocratic tendencies with which some critics have naturally\ncredited him.  While doing justice to the intellectual power\nwith which a few Circles have for many generations maintained\ntheir supremacy over immense multitudes of their countrymen,\nhe believes that the facts of Flatland, speaking for themselves\nwithout comment on his part, declare that Revolutions cannot always\nbe suppressed by slaughter, and that Nature, in sentencing the Circles\nto infecundity, has condemned them to ultimate failure —\n“and herein,” he says, “I see a fulfilment of the great Law\nof all worlds, that while the wisdom of Man thinks it is working\none thing, the wisdom of Nature constrains it to work another,\nand quite a different and far better thing.”  For the rest,\nhe begs his readers not to suppose that every minute detail\nin the daily life of Flatland must needs correspond to\nsome other detail in Spaceland; and yet he hopes that,\ntaken as a whole, his work may prove suggestive as well as amusing,\nto those Spacelanders of moderate and modest minds who —\nspeaking of that which is of the highest importance,\nbut lies beyond experience — decline to say on the one hand,\n“This can never be,” and on the other hand, “It must needs be\nprecisely thus, and we know all about it.”",
        "“Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.”",
