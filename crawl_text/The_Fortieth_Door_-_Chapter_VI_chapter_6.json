        "A SECRET OF THE SANDS",
        "The siesta was past. The sun was tilting towards the west and\nshadows were beginning to jut out across the blazing sands.",
        "Over the mounds of rubbish the bearers had resumed their slow\nprocession, a picturesque frieze of tattered, indigo-robed, ebony\nfigures, baskets on heads, against a cloudless cobalt sky, and again\nthe hot air was invaded with the monotonous rise and fall of their\nlabor chant.",
        "A man with a short, pointed red beard and an academic face beneath a\npith helmet was stooping over the siftings from those baskets,\nintent upon the stream of sand through the wire screens. Patiently\nhe discarded the unending pebbles, discovering at rare intervals\nsome lost bead, some splinter of old sycamore wood, some fragment of\npottery in which a Ptolemy had sipped his wine–or a kitchen wench\nhad soaked her lentils.",
        "Beyond the man were traces of the native camp, a burnt-out fire, a\nroll of rags, a tattered shelter cloth stuck on two tottering\nsticks, and distributed indiscriminatingly were a tethered goat, a\nwhite donkey with motionless, drooping ears, and a few supercilious\ncamels.",
        "The camp was in the center of a broken line of foothills on the\ndesert’s edge. North and south and west the wide sands swept out to\nmeet the sky, and to the east, shutting out the Nile valley, the\nhills reared their red rock from the yellow drift.",
        "Among the jutting rock in the foreground yawned dark mouths that\nwere the entrances of the discovered tombs, and within one of these\ntombs was another white man. He was conducting his own siftings in\nhigh solitude, a lean, bronzed young man, with dark hair and eyes\nand, at the present moment, an unexhilarated expression.",
        "It had been two weeks since Jack Ryder had returned to camp. Two\ninterminable weeks. They were the longest, the dullest, the\ndreariest, the most irritatingly undelighting weeks that he had ever\nlived through.",
        "But bitterly he resented any aspersion from the long-suffering\nThatcher upon his disposition. He wanted it distinctly understood\nthat he was not low-spirited. Not in the least. A man wasn’t in\nthe dumps just because he wasn’t–well, garrulous. Just because he\ndidn’t go about whistling like a steam siren or exult like a cheer\nleader when some one dug up the effigy of a Hathor-cow.... Just\nbecause he objected when the natives twanged their fool strings all\nnight and wailed at the moon.",
        "The moon was full now. Round and white it went sailing blandly over\nthe eternal monotony of desert.... Round and white, it lighted up\nthe eternal sameness of life.... He had never noticed it before, but\na moon was a poignantly depressing phenomenon.",
        "He couldn’t help it. A man couldn’t make himself be a comedian. It\nwasn’t as if he wanted to be a grump. He would have been glad to be\nglad. He wanted Thatcher to make him glad. He defied him to.",
        "He didn’t enjoy this flat, insipid taste of things, this dull grind,\nthis feeling of sameness and dullness that made nothing seem worth\nwhile.... A feeling that he had been marooned on a desert island,\nfar from all stir and throb of life.",
        "Suppose he did dig up a Hathor-cow? Suppose he dug up Hathor\nherself, or Cleopatra, or ten little Ptolemies? What was the good of\nit?",
        "Not Jinny Jeffries herself could have cast more aspersions upon the\npersonal value of excavations.",
        "When he was tired of denying to himself that there was anything\nunusual the matter with him, he shifted the inner argument and took\nup the denial that anything which had happened in Cairo those two\nweeks before had anything to do with it. As if that rash encounter\nmattered! As if he were the silly, senseless sentimental sort of\nidiot to go mooning about his work because of a girl–and a girl\nfrom a harem with a taste for secret masquerades and Turkish\nmarriages!",
        "As if he cared–!",
        "Of course–he admitted this logically and coldly now to himself, as\nhe sat there in the ray of his excavator’s lantern, on the sanded\nfloor at the end of the Hall of Offerings–of course, he was sorry\nfor the girl. It was no life for any young girl–especially a\nspirited one, with her veins bubbling with French blood.",
        "The system was wrong. If they were going to shut up those girls,\nthey had no business to bring them up on modern ideas. If they kept\nthe mashrubiyeh on the windows and the yashmak on their faces they\nought to keep the kohl on their eyes and the henna on their fingers\nand education out of their hidden heads.",
        "It was too bad.... But, of course, they were brought up to it. Look\nhow quickly that girl had given in. She was Turkish, through and\nthrough. Submissive. Docile.... And a darned good thing she was,\ntoo! Suppose she had taken him at his fool word. Suppose she had\nreally wanted to get away!",
        "Lucky, that’s what he’d been. And it would be a lesson to him. Never\nagain. No more masked young things with their stolen keys and their\nharem entrances. No more whispered tales of woe in a shady garden.\nNo more–",
        "Violently he wrenched himself from his No Mores. Recollection had a\nway of stirring an unpleasant tumult.",
        "But it was all over. He had forgotten it–he would forget it. He\nwould forget her. Work, that was the thing. Normal, sensible,\nevery day work.",
        "But there was no joy in this tonic work. Somewhere, between a night\nand a morning, he had lost that glow of accomplishment which had\nbuoyed him, which had made him fairly ecstatic over the discovery of\nthis very tomb.",
        "For this tomb was his own find. It had been found long before by the\nplundering Persians, and it had been found by Arabs who had\nplundered the Persian remains–but between and after those findings\nthe oblivious sands had swept over it, blotting it from the world,\nchoking the entrance hall and the shafts, seeping through\nhalf-sealed entrances and packing its dry drift over the rifled\nsarcophagus of the king and over the withered mummy of the young\ngirl in the ante-room. The tombs had been cleared now, down almost\nto the stone floors, and Ryder was busy with the drifts that had\nlodged in the crevices about the entrance to the shaft.",
        "It was really an important find. Although much plundered, the walls\nwere intact, and the delicate carvings in the white limestone walls\nwere exceptional examples. And there were some very interesting\nthings to decipher. A scholar and an explorer could well be\nenthusiastic.",
        "But Ryder continued to look far from enthusiastic. Even when his\ngroping fingers, searching a cranny, came in contact with a hard\nsubstance his face did not change to any lightning radiance.\nUnexpectantly he picked up the sand-encrusted lump and brushed it\noff. A gleam of gold shone in his hand. But it was no ancient amulet\nor necklace or breast guard–nor was it any bit of the harness of\nthe plundering Persians. It was a locket, very heavily and ornately\ncarved.",
        "He stood a moment staring down at the thing with a curious feeling\nof having stood staring down at exactly the same thing before–that\nsubconscious feeling of the repetition of events which supports the\ntheories of reincarnationists–and then, quite suddenly, memory came\nto his aid.",
        "In McLean’s office. That day of the masquerade. Those visiting\nFrenchmen and that locket they had shown him. Of course the thing\nreminded him–",
        "And it was remarkably alike. The same thick oval, the same ponderous\neffect of the coat of arms–if it should prove the same coat of arms\nthat would be a clue!",
        "With his mind still piecing the recollection and surmise together\nhis fingers pressed the spring. There was a miniature within, but it\nwas not the picture of Monsieur Delcassé. Ryder was looking down\nupon the face of a girl, a beautiful, spirited face, with merry eyes\nand wistful lips–dark eyes, with a lovely arch of brow, and\nrose-red lips with haunting curves.",
        "And eyes and brows and lips and curves, it was the face of the girl\nwho had gazed after him in the moonlight against the shadows of the\npasha’s garden.",
