        "The Peace of Minnie",
        "That night the two avoided each other. Yan ate but little, and to Mrs.\nRaften’s kindly solicitous questions he said he was not feeling well.",
        "After supper they were sitting around the table, the men sleepily\nsilent, Yan and Sam moodily so. Yan had it all laid out in his mind\nnow. Sam would make a one-sided report of the affair; Guy would\nsustain him. Raften himself was witness of Yan’s violence.",
        "The merry days at Sanger were over. He was doomed, and felt like a\ncondemned felon awaiting the carrying out of the sentence. There was\nonly one lively member of the group. That was little Minnie. She was\nbarely three, but a great chatterbox. Like all children, she dearly\nloved a “secret,” and one of her favourite tricks was to beckon to\nsome one, laying her pinky finger on her pinker lips, and then when\nthey stooped she would whisper in their ear, “Don’t tell.” That was\nall. It was her Idea of a “seek-it.”",
        "She was playing at her brother’s knee. He picked her up and they\nwhispered to each other, then she scrambled down and went to Yan. He\nlifted her with a tenderness that was born of the thought that she\nalone loved him now. She beckoned his head down, put her chubby arms\naround his neck and whispered, ’Don’t tell,” then slid down,\nholding her dear innocent little finger warningly before her mouth.",
        "What did it mean? Had Sam told her to do that, or was it a mere\nrepetition of her old trick? No matter, it brought a rush of warm\nfeeling into Yan’s heart. He coaxed the little cherub back and\nwhispered, “No, Minnie, I’ll never tell.” He began to see how crazy he\nhad been. Sam was such a good fellow, he was very fond of him, and he\nwanted to make up; but no–with Sam holding threats of banishment over\nhim, he could not ask for forgiveness. No, he would do nothing but\nwait and see.",
        "He met Mr. Raften again and again that evening and nothing was said.\nHe slept little that night and was up early. He met Mr. Raften\nalone–rather tried to meet him alone. He wanted to have it over with.\nHe was one of the kind not prayed for in the Litany that crave “sudden\ndeath.” But Raften was unchanged. At breakfast Sam was as usual,\nexcept to Yan, and not very different to him. He had a swelling on his\nlip that he said he got “tusslin’ with the boys somehow or nuther.”",
        "After breakfast Raften said:",
        "“Yahn, I want you to come with me to the schoolhouse.”",
        "“It’s come at last,” thought Yan, for the schoolhouse was on the road\nto the railroad station. But why did not Raften say “the station”?\nHe was not a man to mince words. Nothing was said about his handbag\neither, and there was no room for it in the buggy anyway.",
        "Raften drove in silence. There was nothing unusual in that. At length\nhe said:",
        "“Yahn, what’s yer father goin’ to make of ye?”",
        "“An artist,” said Yan, wondering what this had to do with his\ndismissal.",
        "“Does an artist hev to be bang-up eddicated?”",
        "“They’re all the better for it.”",
        "“Av coorse, av coorse, that’s what I tell Sam. It’s eddication that\ncounts. Does artists make much money?”",
        "“Yes, some of them. The successful ones sometimes make millions.”",
        "“Millions? I guess not. Ain’t you stretchin’ it just a leetle?”",
        "“No, sir. Turner made a million. Titian lived in a palace, and so did\nRaphael.”",
        "“Hm. Don’t know ’em, but maybe so–maybe so. It’s wonderful what\neddication does–that’s what I tell Sam.”",
        "They now drew near the schoolhouse. It was holiday time, but the door\nwas open and on the steps were two graybearded men. They nodded to\nRaften. These men were the school trustees. One of them was Char-less\nBoyle; the other was old Moore, poor as a church mouse, but a genial\nsoul, and really put on the Board as a lubricant between Boyle and\nRaften. Boyle was much the more popular. But Raften was always made\ntrustee, for the people knew that he would take extremely good care of\nfunds and school as well as of scholars.",
        "This was a special meeting called to arrange for a new schoolhouse.\nRaften got out a lot of papers, including letters from the Department\nof Education. The School District had to find half the money; the\nDepartment would supply the other half if all conditions were complied\nwith. Chief of these, the schoolhouse had to have a given number of\ncubic feet of air for each pupil. This was very important, but how\nwere they to know in advance if they had the minimum and were not\ngreatly over. It would not do to ask the Department that. They could\nnot consult the teacher, for he was away now and probably would cheat\nthem with more air than was needed. It was Raften who brilliantly\nsolved this frightful mathematical problem and discovered a doughty\nchampion in the thin, bright-eyed child.",
        "“Yahn,” he said, offering him a two-foot rule, “can ye tell me how\nmany foot of air is in this room for every scholar when the seats is\nfull?”",
        "“You mean cubic feet?”",
        "“Le’s see,” and Raften and Moore, after stabbing at the plans with\nhuge forefingers and fumbling cumberously at the much-pawed documents,\nsaid together: “Yes, it says cubic feet.” Yan quickly measured the\nlength of the room and took the height with the map-lifter. The three\ngraybeards gazed with awe and admiration as they saw how surehe seemed. He then counted the seats and said, “Do you count the\nteacher?” The men discussed this point, then decided, “Maybe ye\nbetter; he uses more wind than any of them. Ha, ha!”",
        "Yan made a few figures on paper, then said, “Twenty feet, rather\nbetter.”",
        "“Luk at thot,” said Raften in a voice of bullying and triumph; “jest\nagrees with the Gover’ment Inspector. I towld ye he could. Now\nlet’s put the new buildin’ to test.”",
        "More papers were pawed over.",
        "“Yahn, how’s this–double as many children, one teacher an’ the\nbuildin’ so an’ so.”",
        "Yan figured a minute and said, “Twenty-five feet each.”",
        "“Thar, didn’t I tell ye,” thundered Raften; “didn’t I say that that\ndhirty swindler of an architect was playing us into the conthractor’s\nhands–thought we wuz simple–a put-up job, the hull durn thing. Luk\nat it! They’re nothing but a gang of thieves.”",
        "Yan glanced at the plan that was being flourished in the air.",
        "“Hold on,” he said, with an air of authority that he certainly never\nbefore had used to Raften, “there’s the lobby and cloak-room to come\noff.” He subtracted their bulk and found the plan all right–the\nGovernment minimum of air.",
        "Boyle’s eye had now just a little gleam of triumphant malice. Raften\nseemed actually disappointed not to have found some roguery.",
        "“Well, they’re a shcaly lot, anyhow. They’ll bear watchin’,” he added,\nin tones of self-justification.",
        "“Now, Yahn, last year the township was assessed at $265,000 an’ we\nraised $265 with a school-tax of wan mill on the dollar. This year the\nnew assessment gives $291,400; how much will the same tax raise if\ncost of collecting is same?”",
        "“Two hundred and ninety-one dollars and forty cents,” said Yan,\nwithout hesitation–and the three men sat back in their chairs and\ngasped.",
        "It was the triumph of his life. Even old Boyle beamed in admiration,\nand Raften glowed, feeling that not a little of it belonged to him.",
        "There was something positively pathetic in the simplicity of the three\nshrewd men and their abject reverence for the wonderful scholarship of\nthis raw boy, and not less touching was their absolute faith in his\ninfallibility as a mathematician.",
        "Raften grinned at him in a peculiar, almost a weak way. Yan had never\nseen that expression on his face before, excepting once, and that\nwas as he shook hands with a noted pugilist just after he had won a\nmemorable fight. Yan did not know whether he liked it or not.",
        "On the road home Raften talked with unusual freeness about his plans\nfor his son. (Yan began to realize that the storm had blown over.) He\nharped on his favourite theme, “eddication.” If Yan had only known,\nthat was the one word of comfort that Raften found when he saw his big\nboy go down: “It’s eddication done it. Oh, but he’s fine eddicated.\"\nYan never knew until years afterward, when a grown man and he and\nRaften were talking of the old days, that he had been for some time\nwinning respect from the rough-and-ready farmer, but what finally\nraised him to glorious eminence was the hip-throw that he served that\nday on Sam.",
        "Raften was all right, Yan believed, but what of Sam? They had not\nspoken yet. Yan wished to make up, but it grew harder. Sam had got\nover his wrath and wanted a chance, but did not know how.",
        "He had just set down his two buckets after feeding the pigs when\nMinnie came toddling out.",
        "“Sam! Sam! Take Minnie to ’ide,” then seeing Yan she added, “Yan, you\nmate a tair, tate hold Sam’s hand.”",
        "The queen must be obeyed. Sam and Yan sheepishly grasped hands to make\na queen’s chair for the little lady. She clutched them both around\nthe neck and brought their heads close together. They both loved the\npink-and-white baby between them, and both could talk to her though\nnot to each other. But there is something in touch that begets\ncomprehension. The situation was becoming ludicrous when Sam suddenly\nburst out laughing, then:",
        "“Say, Yan, let’s be friends.”",
        "“I–I want–to–be,” stammered Yan, with tears standing in his eyes.\n“I’m awfully sorry. I’ll never do it again,”",
        "“Oh, shucks! I don’t care,” said Sam. “It was all that dirty little\nsneak that made the trouble; but never mind, it’s all right. The\nonly thing that worries me is how you sent me flying. I’m bigger an’\nstronger an’ older, I can heft more an’ work harder, but you throwed\nme like a bag o’ shavings, I only wish I knowed how you done it.”",
