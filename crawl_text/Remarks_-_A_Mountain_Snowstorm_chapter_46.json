        "September does not always indicate golden sunshine, and ripening corn, and\nold gold pumpkin pies on the half-shell. We look upon it as the month of\nglorious perfection in the handiwork of the seasons and the time when the\nripened fruits are falling; when the red sun hides behind the bronze and\nmisty evening, and says good night with reluctance to the beautiful\nharvests and the approaching twilight of the year.",
        "It was on a red letter day of this kind, years ago, that Wheeler and\nmyself started out under the charge of Judge Blair and Sheriff Baswell to\nvisit the mines at Last Chance, and more especially the Keystone, a gold\nmine that the Judge had recently become president of. The soft air of\nsecond summer in the Rocky Mountains blew gently past our ears as we rode\nup the valley of the Little Laramie, to camp the first night at the head\nof the valley behind Sheep Mountain. The whole party was full of joy. Even\nJudge Blair, with the frosts of over sixty winters in his hair, broke\nforth into song. That’s the only thing I ever had against Judge Blair. He\nwould forget himself sometimes and burst forth into song.",
        "The following day we crossed the divide and rode down the gulch into the\ncamp on Douglass Creek, where the musical thunder of the stamp mills\nseemed to jar the ground, and the rapid stream below bore away on its\nturbid bosom the yellowish tinge of the golden quartz. It was a perfect\nday, and Wheeler and I blessed our stars and, instead of breathing the air\nof sour paste and hot presses in the newspaper offices, away in the\nvalley, we were sprawling in the glorious sunshine of the hills, playing\ndraw poker with the miners in the evening, and forgetful of the daily\nnewspaper where one man does the work and the other draws the salary. It\nwas heaven. It was such luxury that we wanted to swing our hats and yell\nlike Arapahoes.",
        "The next morning we were surprised to find that it had snowed all night\nand was snowing still. I never saw such flakes of snow in my life. They\ncame sauntering through the air like pure, white Turkish towels falling\nfrom celestial clothes-lines. We did not return that day. We played a few\ngames of chance, but they were brief. We finally made it five cent ante,\nand, as I was working then for an alleged newspaper man who paid me $50\nper month to edit his paper nights and take care of his children daytimes,\nI couldn’t keep abreast of the Judge, the Sheriff and the Superintendent\nof the Keystone.",
        "The next day we had to go home. The snow lay ankle-deep everywhere and the\nair was chilly and raw. Wheeler and I tried to ride, but the mountain road\nwas so rough that the horses could barely move through the snow, dragging\nthe buggy after them. So we got out and walked on ahead to keep warm. We\ngained very fast on the team, for we were both long-legged and measured\noff the miles like a hired man going to dinner. I wore a pair of\nglove-fitting low shoes and lisle-thread socks. I can remember that yet. I\nwould advise anyone going into the mines not to wear lisle-thread socks\nand low shoes. You are liable to stick your foot into a snow-bank or a mud\nhole and dip up too much water. I remember that after we had walked\nthrough the pine woods down the mountain road a few miles, I noticed that\nthe bottoms of my pantaloons looked like those of a drowned tramp I saw\nmany years ago in the morgue. We gave out after a while, waited for the\nteam, but decided that it had gone the other road. All at once it flashed\nover us that we were alone in the woods and the storm, wet, nearly\nstarved, ignorant of the road and utterly worn out!",
        "It was tough!",
        "I never felt so blue, so wet, so hungry, or so hopeless in my life. We\nmoved on a little farther. All at once we came out of the timber. There\nwas no snow whatever! At that moment the sun burst forth, we struck a\ndeserted supply wagon, found a two-pound can of Boston baked beans, got an\naxe from the load, chopped open the can, and had just finished the\ntropical fruit of Massachusetts when our own team drove up, and joy and\nhope made their homes once more in our hearts.",
        "We may learn from this a valuable lesson, but at this moment I do not know\nexactly what it is.",
