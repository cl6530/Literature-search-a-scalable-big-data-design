        "To understand the literary leadership of New England during the\nthirty years immediately preceding the Civil War it is necessary\nto recall the characteristics of a somewhat isolated and peculiar\npeople. The mental and moral traits of the New England colonists,\nalready glanced at in an earlier chapter, had suffered little\nessential modification in two hundred years. The original racial\nstock was still dominant. As compared with the middle and\nsouthern colonies, there was relatively little immigration, and\nthis was easily assimilated. The physical remoteness of New\nEngland from other sections of the country, and the stubborn\nloyalty with which its inhabitants maintained their own standards\nof life, alike contributed to their sense of separateness. It is\ntrue, of course, that their mode of thinking and feeling had\nundergone certain changes. They were among the earliest theorists\nof political independence from Great Britain, and had done their\nshare, and more, in the Revolution. The rigors of their early\ncreed had somewhat relaxed, as we have seen, by the end of the\nseventeenth century, and throughout the eighteenth there was a\ngradual progress toward religious liberalism. The population\nsteadily increased, and New England’s unremitting struggle with a\nnot too friendly soil, her hardihood upon the seas, and her\nkeenness in trade, became proverbial throughout the country. Her\nseaport towns were wealthy. The general standards of living\nremained frugal, but extreme poverty was rare. Her people still\nmade, as in the earliest days of the colonies, silent and\nunquestioned sacrifices for education, and her chief seats of\nlearning, Harvard and Yale, remained the foremost educational\ncenters of America. But there was still scant leisure for the\nquest of beauty, and slender material reward for any practitioner\nof the fine arts. Oratory alone, among the arts of expression,\ncommanded popular interest and applause. Daniel Webster’s\naudiences at Plymouth in 1820 and at Bunker Hill in 1825 were not\ninferior to similar audiences of today in intelligence and in\nresponsiveness. Perhaps they were superior. Appreciation of the\nspoken word was natural to men trained by generations of\nthoughtful listening to “painful” preaching and by participation\nin the discussions of town-meeting. Yet appreciation of secular\nliterature was rare, and interest in the other arts was almost\nnon-existent.",
        "Then, beginning in the eighteen-twenties, and developing rapidly\nafter 1830, came a change, a change so startling as to warrant\nthe term of “the Renascence of New England.” No single cause is\nsufficient to account for this “new birth.” It is a good\nillustration of that law of “tension and release,” which the late\nProfessor Shaler liked to demonstrate in all organic life. A long\nperiod of strain was followed by an age of expansion, freedom,\nrelease of energy. As far as the mental life of New England was\nconcerned, something of the new stimulus was due directly to the\ninfluence of Europe. Just as the wandering scholars from Italy\nhad brought the New Learning, which was a revival of the old\nlearning, into England in the sixteenth century, so now young New\nEngland college men like Edward Everett and George Ticknor\nbrought home from the Continent the riches of German and French\nscholarship. Emerson’s description of the impression made by\nEverett’s lectures in 1820, after his return from Germany, gives\na vivid picture of the new thirst for foreign culture. “The North\nAmerican Review” and other periodicals, while persistently urging\nthe need of a distinctively national literature, insisted also\nupon the value of a deeper knowledge of the literature of the\nContinent. This was the burden of Channing’s once famous article\non “A National Literature” in 1823: it was a plea for an\nindependent American school of writers, but these writers should\nknow the best that Europe had to teach.",
        "The purely literary movement was connected, as the great name of\nChanning suggests, with a new sense of freedom in philosophy and\nreligion. Calvinism had mainly done its work in New England. It\nhad bred an extraordinary type of men and women, it had, helped\nto lay some of the permanent foundations of our democracy, and it\nwas still destined to have a long life in the new West and in the\nSouth. But in that stern section of the country where its\ninfluence had been most marked there was now an increasingly\nsharp reaction against its determinism and its pessimism. Early\nin the nineteenth century the most ancient and influential\nchurches in Boston and the leading professors at Harvard had\naccepted the new form of religious liberalism known as\nUnitarianism. The movement spread throughout Eastern\nMassachusetts and made its way to other States. Orthodox and\nliberal Congregational churches split apart, and when Channing\npreached the ordination sermon for Jared Sparks in Baltimore in\n1819, the word Unitarian, accepted by the liberals with some\nmisgiving, became the recognized motto of the new creed. It is\nonly with its literary influence that we are here concerned, yet\nthat literary influence became so potent that there is scarcely a\nNew England writer of the first rank, from Bryant onward, who\nremained untouched by it.",
        "The most interesting and peculiar phase of the new liberalism has\nlittle directly to do with the specific tenets of theological\nUnitarianism, and in fact marked a revolt against the more\nprosaic and conventional pattern of English and American\nUnitarian thought. But this movement, known as Transcendentalism,\nwould have been impossible without a preliminary and liberalizing\nstirring of the soil. It was a fascinating moment of release for\nsome of the most brilliant and radical minds of New England. Its\nforemost representative in our literature was Ralph Waldo\nEmerson, as its chief exponents in England were Coleridge and\nCarlyle. We must understand its meaning if we would perceive the\nquality of much of the most noble and beautiful writing produced\nin New England during the Golden Age.",
        "What then is the significance of the word Transcendental?\nDisregarding for the moment the technical development of this\nterm as used by German and English philosophers, it meant for\nEmerson and his friends simply this: whatever transcends or goes\nbeyond the experience of the senses. It stressed intuition rather\nthan sensation, direct perception of ultimate truth rather than\nthe processes of logic. It believed in man’s ability to apprehend\nthe absolute ideas of Truth, Rectitude, Goodness. It resembled\nthe Inner Light of the Quaker, though the Quaker traced this to a\nsupernatural illumination of the Holy Spirit, while the\nTranscendentalist believed that a vision of the eternal realities\nwas a natural endowment of the human mind. It had only to be\ntrusted. Stated in this form, it is evident that we have here a\nvery ancient doctrine, well known in the literature of India and\nof Greece. It has been held by countless persons who have never\nheard of the word Transcendentalism. We need go no further back\nthan Alexander Pope, a Roman Catholic, whom we find declaring: “I\nam so certain of the soul’s being immortal that I seem to feel it\nwithin me, as it were by intuition.” Pope’s friend Swift, a dean\nof the Church of England and assuredly no Transcendentalist,\ndefined vision as seeing the things that are invisible.",
        "Now turn to some of the New England men. Dr. C. A. Bartol, a\ndisciple of Emerson, maintained that “the mistake is to make the\neverlasting things subjects of argument instead of sight.\"\nTheodore Parker declared to his congregation:",
        "“From the primitive facts of consciousness given by the power of\ninstinctive intuition, I endeavored to deduce the true notion of\nGod, of justice and futurity . . . . I found most help in the\nworks of Immanuel Kant, one of the profoundest thinkers of the\nworld, though one of the worst writers, even in Germany; if he\ndid not always furnish conclusions I could rest in, he yet gave\nme the true method, and put me on the right road. I found certain\ngreat primal Intuitions of Human Nature, which depend on no\nlogical process of demonstration, but are rather facts of\nconsciousness given by the instinctive action of human nature\nitself. I will mention only the three most important which\npertain to Religion. 1. The Instinctive Intuition of the Divine,\nthe consciousness that there is a God. 2. The Instinctive\nIntuition of the Just and Right, a consciousness that there is a\nMoral Law, independent of our will, which we ought to keep. 3.\nThe Instinctive Intuition of the Immortal, a consciousness that\nthe Essential Element of man, the principle of Individuality,\nnever dies.”",
        "This passage dates from 1859, and readers of Bergson may like to\ncompare it with the contemporary Frenchman’s saying: “The\nanalytical faculties can give us no realities.”",
        "Let us next hear Emerson himself, first in an early letter to his\nbrother Edward: “Do you draw the distinction of Milton,\nColeridge, and the Germans between Reason and Understanding? I\nthink it a philosophy itself, and, like all truth, very\npractical. Reason is the highest faculty of the soul, what we\nmean often by the soul itself: it never reasons, never proves, it\nsimply perceives, it is vision. The understanding toils all the\ntime, compares, contrives, adds, argues; near-sighted, but\nstrong-sighted, dwelling in the present, the expedient, the\ncustomary.” And in 1833, after he had left the Unitarian pulpit,\nEmerson made in his diary this curious attempt to reconcile the\nscriptural language of his ancestral profession to the new\nvocabulary of Transcendentalism: “Jesus Christ was a minister of\nthe pure Reason. The beatitudes of the Sermon on the Mount are\nall utterances of the mind contemning the phenomenal world . . .\n. The understanding can make nothing of it. ’Tis all nonsense.\nThe Reason affirms its absolute verity . . . . St. Paul marks the\ndistinction by the terms natural man and spiritual man. When\nNovalis says, ’It is the instinct of the Understanding to\ncontradict the Reason,’ he only translates into a scientific\nformula the doctrine of St. Paul, ’The Carnal Mind is enmity\nagainst God.’”",
        "One more quotation must suffice. It is from a poem by a forgotten\nTranscendentalist, F. G. Tuckerman.",
        "“No more thy meaning seek, thine anguish plead;\nBut, leaving straining thought and stammering word,\nAcross the barren azure pass to God;\nShooting the void in silence, like a bird–\nA bird that shuts his wings for better speed!”",
        "It is obvious that this “contemning the phenomenal world,” this\n“revulsion against the intellect as the sole source of truth,” is\nhighly dangerous to second-class minds. If one habitually prints\nthe words Insight, Instinct, Intuition, Consciousness with\ncapitals, and relegates equally useful words like senses,\nexperience, fact, logic to lower-case type, one may do it because\nhe is a Carlyle or an Emerson, but the chances are that he is\nneither. Transcendentalism, like all idealistic movements, had\nits “lunatic fringe,” its camp-followers of excitable, unstable\nvisionaries. The very name, like the name Methodist, was probably\nbestowed upon it in mockery, and this whole perturbation of staid\nNew England had its humorous side. Witness the career of Bronson\nAlcott. It is also true that the glorious affirmations of these\nseers can be neither proved nor disproved. They made no\nexamination and they sought no validation of consciousness. An\nexplorer in search of the North Pole must bring back proofs of\nhis journey, but when a Transcendentalist affirms that he has\nreached the far heights of human experience and even caught sight\nof the gods sitting on their thrones, you and I are obliged to\ntake his word for it. Sometimes we hear such a man gladly, but it\ndepends upon the man, not upon the trustworthiness of the method.\nFinally it should be observed that the Transcendental movement\nwas an exceedingly complex one, being both literary, philosophic,\nand religious; related also to the subtle thought of the Orient,\nto mediaeval mysticism, and to the English Platonists; touched\nthroughout by the French Revolutionary theories, by the Romantic\nspirit, by the new zeal for science and pseudo-science, and by\nthe unrest of a fermenting age.",
        "Our present concern is with the impact of this cosmopolitan\ncurrent upon the mind and character of a few New England writers.\nChanning and Theodore Parker, Margaret Fuller and Alcott, Thoreau\nand Emerson, are all representative of the best thought and the\nnoblest ethical impulses of their generation. Let us choose first\nthe greatest name: a sunward-gazing spirit, and, it may be, one\nof the very Sun-Gods.",
        "The pilgrim to Concord who stops for a moment in the village\nlibrary to study French’s statue of Emerson will notice the\nasymmetrical face. On one side it is the face of a keen Yankee\nfarmer, but seen from the other side it is the countenance of a\nseer, a world’s man. This contrast between the parochial Emerson\nand the greater Emerson interprets many a puzzle in his career.\nHalf a mile beyond the village green to the north, close to the\n“rude bridge” of the famous Concord fight in 1775, is the Old\nManse, once tenanted and described by Hawthorne. It was built by\nEmerson’s grandfather, a patriot chaplain in the Revolution, who\ndied of camp-fever at Ticonderoga. His widow married Dr. Ezra\nRipley, and here Ralph Waldo Emerson and his brothers passed many\na summer in their childhood. Half a mile east of the village, on\nthe Cambridge turnpike, is Emerson’s own house, still sheltered\nby the pines which Thoreau helped him to plant in 1838. Within\nthe house everything is unchanged: here are the worn books, pen\nand inkstand, the favorite pictures upon the wall. Over the ridge\nto the north lies the Sleepy Hollow cemetery where the poet\nrests, with the gravestones of Hawthorne and the Alcotts, Thoreau\nand William James close by.",
        "But although Concord is the Emerson shrine, he was born in\nBoston, in 1803. His father, named William like the grandfather,\nwas also, like the Emerson ancestors for many generations, a\nclergyman–eloquent, liberal, fond of books and music, highly\nhonored by his alma mater Harvard and by the town of Boston,\nwhere he ministered to the First Church. His premature death in\n1811 left his widow with five sons–one of them feebleminded–and\na daughter to struggle hard with poverty. With her husband’s\nsister, the Calvinistic “Aunt Mary Moody” Emerson, she held,\nhowever, that these orphaned boys had been “born to be educated.\"\nArid educated the “eager blushing boys” were, at the Boston Latin\nSchool and at Harvard College, on a regimen of “toil and want and\ntruth and mutual faith.” There are many worse systems of pedagogy\nthan this. Ralph was thought less persistent than his steady\nolder brother William, and far less brilliant than his gifted,\nshort-lived younger brothers, Edward and Charles. He had an\nundistinguished career at Harvard, where he was graduated in\n1821, ranking thirtieth in a class of fifty-nine. Lovers of irony\nlike to remember that he was the seventh choice of his classmates\nfor the position of class poet. After some desultory teaching to\nhelp his brothers, he passed irregularly through the Divinity\nSchool, his studies often interrupted by serious ill-health. “If\nthey had examined me,” he said afterward of the kindly professors\nin the Divinity School, “they never would have passed me.” But\napprove him they did, in 1826, and he entered decorously upon the\nprofession of his ancestors, as associate minister of the Second\nChurch in Boston. His “Journals,” which are a priceless record of\nhis inner life, at this and later periods, reveal the rigid\nself-scrutiny, the tender idealism, with which he began his\nministerial career.",
        "But as a scheme of life for Ralph Waldo Emerson this vocation\nwould not satisfy. The sexton of the Second Church thought that\nthe young man was not at his best at funerals. Father Taylor, the\neccentric Methodist, whom Emerson assisted at a sailor’s Bethel\nnear Long Wharf, considered him “one of the sweetest souls God\never made,” but as ignorant of the principles of the New\nTestament as Balaam’s ass was of Hebrew grammar. By and by came\nan open difference with his congregation over the question of\nadministering the Communion. “I am not interested in it,” Emerson\nadmitted, and he wrote in his “Journal” the noble words: “It is\nmy desire, in the office of a Christian minister, to do nothing\nwhich I cannot do with my whole heart.” His resignation was\naccepted in 1832. His young wife had died of consumption in the\nsame year. He now sailed for Italy, France, and England, a\nmemorable journey which gave him an acquaintance with Landor,\nWordsworth, Coleridge, and Carlyle, but which was even more\nsignificant in sending him, as he says, back to himself, to the\nresources of his own nature. “When shows break up,” wrote Whitman\nafterward, “what but oneself is sure?” In 1834 and 1835 we find\nEmerson occupying a room in the Old Manse at Concord, strolling\nin the quiet fields, lecturing or preaching if he were invited to\ndo so, but chiefly absorbed in a little book which he was\nbeginning to write–a new utterance of a new man.",
        "This book, the now famous “Nature” of 1836, contains the essence\nof Emerson’s message to his generation. It is a prose essay, but\nwritten in the ecstatic mood of a poet. The theme of its\nmeditation is the soul as related to Nature and to God. The soul\nis primal; Nature, in all its bountiful and beautiful\ncommodities, exists for the training of the soul; it is the\nsoul’s shadow. And every soul has immediate access to Deity. Thus\nthe utility and beauty and discipline of Nature lift the soul\nGodward. The typical sentence of the book is this: “The sun\nshines today also\"; that is to say: the world is still alive and\nfair; let us lift up our hearts! Only a few Americans of 1836\nbought this singular volume, but Emerson went serenely forward.\nHe had found his path.",
        "In 1837 he delivered the well-known Phi Beta Kappa oration at\nHarvard on “The American Scholar.” Emerson was now thirty-four;\nhe had married a second time, had bought a house of his own in\nConcord, and purposed to make a living by lecturing and writing.\nHis address in Cambridge, though it contained no reference to\nhimself, was after all a justification of the way of life he had\nchosen: a declaration of intellectual independence for himself\nand his countrymen, an exhortation of self-trust to the\nindividual thinking man. “If the single man plant himself\nindomitably on his instincts and there abide, the huge world will\ncome round to him.” Such advice to cut loose from the moorings of\nthe past was not unknown in Phi Beta Kappa orations, though it\nhad never been so brilliantly phrased; but when Emerson applied\nprecisely the same doctrine, in 1838, to the graduating class at\nthe Harvard Divinity School, he roused a storm of disapproval. “A\ntempest in our washbowl,” he wrote coolly to Carlyle, but it was\nmore than that. The great sentence of the Divinity School\naddress, “God is, not was; he speaketh, not spake,” was the\nemphasis of a superb rhetorician upon the immediacy of the soul’s\naccess to God. It has been the burden of a thousand prophets in\nall religions. The young priests of the Divinity School, their\neyes wearied with Hebrew and Greek, seem to have enjoyed\nEmerson’s injunction to turn away from past records and\nhistorical authorities and to drink from the living fountain of\nthe divine within themselves; but to the professors, “the stern\nold war-gods,” this relative belittlement of historical\nChristianity seemed blasphemy. A generation passed before Emerson\nwas again welcomed by his alma mater.",
        "The reader who has mastered those three utterances by the Concord\nTranscendentalist in 1836, 1837, and 1838 has the key to Emerson.\nHe was a seer, not a system-maker. The constitution of his mind\nforbade formal, consecutive, logical thought. He was not a\nphilosopher in the accepted sense, though he was always\nphilosophizing, nor a metaphysician in spite of his curious\nsearchings in the realm of metaphysics. He sauntered in books as\nhe sauntered by Walden Pond, in quest of what interested him; he\n“fished in Montaigne,” he said, as he fished in Plato and Goethe.\nHe basketed the day’s luck, good or bad as it might be, into the\npages of his private “Journal,” which he called his savings-bank,\nbecause from this source he drew most of the material for his\nbooks. The “Journal” has recently been printed, in ten volumes.\nNo American writing rewards the reader more richly. It must be\nremembered that Emerson’s “Essays,” the first volume of which\nappeared in 1841, and the last volumes after his death in 1882,\nrepresent practically three stages of composition: first the\ndetached thoughts of the “Journal;” second, the rearrangement of\nthis material for use upon the lecture platform; and finally, the\nessays in their present form. The oral method thus predominates:\na series of oracular thoughts has been shaped for oratorical\nutterance, not oratorical in the bombastic, popular American\nsense, but cunningly designed, by a master of rhetoric, to\ncapture the ear and then the mind of the auditor.",
        "Emerson’s work as a lecturer coincided with the rise of that\nLyceum system which brought most of the American authors, for\nmore than a generation, into intimate contact with the public,\nand which proved an important factor in the aesthetic and moral\ncultivation of our people. No lecturer could have had a more\nauspicious influence than Emerson, with his quiet dignity, his\nserene spiritual presence, his tonic and often electrifying\nforce. But if he gave his audiences precious gifts, he also\nlearned much from them. For thirty years his lecturing trips to\nthe West brought him, more widely than any New England man of\nletters, into contact with the new, virile America of the great\nMississippi valley. Unlike many of his friends, he was not\nrepelled by the “Jacksonism of the West\"; he rated it a\nwholesome, vivifying force in our national thought and life. The\n“Journal” reveals the essential soundness of his Americanism.\nThough surrounded all his life by reformers, he was himself\nscarcely a reformer, save upon the single issue of anti-slavery.\nPerhaps he was at bottom too much of a radical to be swept off\nhis feet by any reform.",
        "To our generation, of course, Emerson presents himself as an\nauthor of books, and primarily as an essayist, rather than as a\nwinning, entrancing speaker. His essays have a greater variety of\ntone than is commonly recognized. Many of them, like “Manners,\"\n“Farming,” “Books,” “Eloquence,” “Old Age,” exhibit a shrewd\nprudential wisdom, a sort of Yankee instinct for “the milk in the\npan,” that reminds one of Ben Franklin. Like most of the greater\nNew England writers, he could be, on occasion, an admirable local\nhistorian. See his essays on “Life and Letters in New England,\"\n“New England Reformers,” “Politics,” and the successive entries\nin his “Journal\" relating to Daniel Webster. He had the happiest\ngift of portraiture, as is witnessed by his sketches of\nMontaigne, of Napoleon, of Socrates (in the essay on Plato), of\nhis aunt Mary Moody Emerson, of Thoreau, and of various types of\nEnglishmen in his “English Traits.” But the great essays, no\ndoubt, are those like “Self-Reliance,” “Compensation,” “The\nOver-Soul,” “Fate,” “Power,” “Culture,” “Worship,” and\n“Illusions.” These will puzzle no one who has read carefully that\nfirst book on “Nature.” They all preach the gospel of intuition,\ninstinctive trust in the Universe, faith in the ecstatic moment\nof vision into the things that are unseen by the physical eye.\nSelf-reliance, as Emerson’s son has pointed out, means really\nGod-reliance; the Over-Soul–always a stumbling-block to\nPhilistines–means that high spiritual life into which all men\nmay enter and in which they share the life of Deity. Emerson is\nstern enough in expounding the laws of compensation that run\nthrough the universe, but to him the chief law is the law of the\never-ascending, victorious soul.",
        "This radiant optimism permeates his poems. By temperament a\nsinger as well as a seer and sayer, Emerson was nevertheless\ndeficient in the singing voice. He composed no one great poem,\nhis verse presents no ideas that are not found in his prose. In\nmetre and rhyme he is harsh and willful. Yet he has marvelous\nsingle phrases and cadences. He ejaculates transports and\necstasies, and though he cannot organize and construct in verse,\nhe is capable here and there of the true miracle of transforming\nfact and thought into true beauty. Aldrich used to say that he\nwould rather have written Emerson’s “Bacchus” than any American\npoem.",
        "That the pure, high, and tonic mind of Emerson was universal in\nits survey of human forces, no one would claim. Certain\nlimitations in interest and sympathy are obvious. “That horrid\nburden and impediment of the soul which the churches call sin,\"\nto use John Morley’s words, occupied his attention but little.\nLike a mountain climber in a perilous pass, he preferred to look\nup rather than down. He does not stress particularly those old\nhuman words, service and sacrifice. “Anti-scientific, antisocial,\nanti-Christian” are the terms applied to him by one of his most\npenetrating critics. Yet I should prefer to say “un-scientific,\"\n“unsocial,” and “non-Christian,” in the sense in which Plato and\nIsaiah are non-Christian. Perhaps it would be still nearer the\ntruth to say, as Mrs. Lincoln said of her husband, “He was not a\ntechnical Christian.” He tends to underestimate institutions of\nevery kind; history, except as a storehouse of anecdote, and\nculture as a steady mental discipline. This is the price he pays\nfor his transcendental insistence upon the supreme value of the\nNow, the moment of insight. But after all these limitations are\nproperly set down, the personality of Ralph Waldo Emerson remains\na priceless possession to his countrymen. The austere serenity of\nhis life, and the perfection with which he represents the highest\ntype of his province and his era, will ultimately become blended\nwith the thought of his true Americanism. A democrat and\nliberator, like Lincoln, he seems also destined like Lincoln to\nbecome increasingly a world’s figure, a friend and guide to\naspiring spirits everywhere. Differences of race and creed are\nnegligible in the presence of such superb confidence in God and\nthe soul.",
        "Citizens of Concord in May, 1862, hearing that Henry Thoreau, the\neccentric bachelor, had just died of consumption in his mother’s\nhouse on Main Street, in his forty-fifth year, would have smiled\ncannily at the notion that after fifty years their townsman’s\nliterary works would be published in a sumptuous twenty-volume\nedition, and that critics in his own country and in Europe would\nrank him with Ralph Waldo Emerson. Yet that is precisely what has\nhappened. Our literature has no more curious story than the\nevolution of this local crank into his rightful place of\nmastership. In his lifetime he printed only two books, “A Week on\nthe Concord and Merrimac Rivers\"–which was even more completely\nneglected by the public than Emerson’s “Nature\"–and “Walden,\"\nnow one of the classics, but only beginning to be talked about\nwhen its shy, proud author penned his last line and died with the\nwords “moose” and “Indian” on his lips.",
        "Thoreau, like all thinkers who reach below the surface of human\nlife, means many different things to men of various temperaments.\nCollectors of human novelties, like Stevenson, rejoice in his\nuniqueness of flavor; critics, like Lowell, place him, not\nwithout impatient rigor. To some readers he is primarily a\nnaturalist, an observer, of the White of Selborne school; to\nothers an elemental man, a lover of the wild, a hermit of the\nwoods. He has been called the poet-naturalist, to indicate that\nhis powers of observation were accompanied, like Wordsworth’s, by\na gift of emotional interpretation of the meaning of phenomena.\nLovers of literature celebrate his sheer force and penetration of\nphrase. But to the student of American thought Thoreau’s prime\nvalue lies in the courage and consistency with which he\nendeavored to realize the gospel of Transcendentalism in his own\ninner life.",
        "Lovers of racial traits like to remember that Thoreau’s\ngrandfather was an immigrant Frenchman from the island of Jersey,\nand that his grandmother was Scotch and Quaker. His father made\nlead pencils and ground plumbago in his own house in Concord. The\nmother was from New Hampshire. It was a high-minded family. All\nthe four children taught school and were good talkers. Henry,\nborn in 1817, was duly baptized by good Dr. Ripley of the Old\nManse, studied Greek and Latin, and was graduated at Harvard in\n1837, the year of Emerson’s Phi Beta Kappa address. Even in\ncollege the young man was a trifle difficult. “Cold and\nunimpressible,” wrote a classmate. “The touch of his hand was\nmoist and indifferent. He did not care for people.” “An\nunfavorable opinion has been entertained of his disposition to\nexert himself,” wrote President Quincy confidentially to Emerson\nin 1837, although the kindly President, a year later, in\nrecommending Thoreau as a school-teacher, certified that “his\nrank was high as a scholar in all the branches and his morals and\ngeneral conduct unexceptionable and exemplary.”",
        "Ten years passed. The young man gave up school-keeping, thinking\nit a loss of time. He learned pencil-making, surveying, and farm\nwork, and found that by manual labor for six weeks in the year he\ncould meet all the expenses of living. He haunted the woods and\npastures, explored rivers and ponds, built the famous hut on\nEmerson’s wood-lot with the famous axe borrowed from Alcott, was\nput in jail for refusal to pay his polltax, and, to sum up much\nin little, “signed off” from social obligations. “I, Henry D.\nThoreau, have signed off, and do not hold myself responsible to\nyour multifarious uncivil chaos named Civil Government.” When his\ncollege class held its tenth reunion in 1847, and each man was\nasked to send to the secretary a record of achievement, Thoreau\nwrote: “My steadiest employment, if such it can be called, is to\nkeep myself at the top of my condition and ready for whatever may\nturn up in heaven or on earth.” There is the motto of\nTranscendentalism, stamped upon a single coin.",
        "For “to be ready for whatever may turn up” is Thoreau’s racier,\nhomelier version of Emerson’s “endless seeker\"; and Thoreau, more\neasily than Emerson, could venture to stake everything upon the\nquest. The elder man had announced the programme, but by 1847 he\nwas himself almost what Thoreau would call a “committed man,\"\nwith family and household responsibilities, with a living to\nearn, and bound, like every professional writer and speaker, to\nhave some measure of regard for his public. But Thoreau was ready\nto travel lightly and alone. If he should fail in the great\nadventure for spiritual perfection, it was his own affair. He had\nno intimates, no confidant save the multitudinous pages of his\n“Journal,” from which–and here again he followed Emerson’s\nexample–his future books were to be compiled. Many of his most\nloyal admirers will admit that such a quest is bound, by the very\nconditions of the problem, to be futile. Hawthorne allegorized it\nin “Ethan Brand,” and his quaint illustration of the folly of\nromantic expansion of the self apart from the common interests of\nhuman kind is the picture of a dog chasing its own tail. “It is\ntime now that I begin to live,” notes Thoreau in the “Journal,\"\nand he continued to say it in a hundred different ways until the\nend of all his journalizing, but he never quite captured the\nfugitive felicity. The haunting pathos of his own allegory has\nmoved every reader of “Walden:” “I long ago lost a hound, a bay\nhorse, and a turtle-dove, and am still on their trail.” Precisely\nwhat he meant it is now impossible to say, but surely he betrays\na doubt in the ultimate efficacy of his own system of life. He\nbends doggedly to the trail, for Henry Thoreau is no quitter, but\nthe trail leads nowhere, and in the latest volumes of the\n“Journals” he seems to realize that he has been pursuing a\nphantom. He dived fearlessly and deep into himself, but somehow\nhe failed to grasp that pearl of great price which all the\ntranscendental prophets assured him was to be had at the cost of\ndiving.",
        "This is not to say that this austere and strenuous athlete came\nup quite empty-handed. Far from it. The byproducts of his toil\nwere enough to have enriched many lesser men, and they have given\nThoreau a secure fame. From his boyhood he longed to make himself\na writer, and an admirable writer he became. “For along time,” he\nsays in “Walden,” “I was reporter to a journal, of no very wide\ncirculation, whose editor has never seen fit to print the bulk of\nmy contributions, and, as is too common with writers, I got only\nmy labor for my pains. However, in this case my pains were their\nreward.” Like so many solitaries, he experienced the joy of\nintense, long-continued effort in composition, and he was artist\nenough to know that his pages, carefully assembled from his note\nbooks, had pungency, form, atmosphere. No man of his day, not\neven Lowell the “last of the bookmen,” abandoned himself more\nunreservedly to the delight of reading. Thoreau was an\naccomplished scholar in the Greek and Roman classics, as his\ntranslations attest. He had some acquaintance with several modern\nlanguages, and at one time possessed the best collection of books\non Oriental literature to be found in America. He was drenched in\nthe English poetry of the seventeenth century. His critical\nessays in the “Dial,” his letters and the bookish allusions\nthroughout his writings, are evidence of rich harvesting in the\nrecords of the past. He left some three thousand manuscript pages\nof notes on the American Indians, whose history and character had\nfascinated him from boyhood. Even his antiquarian hobbies gave\nhim durable satisfaction. Then, too, he had deep delight in his\nlife-long studies in natural history, in his meticulous\nmeasurements of river currents, in his notes upon the annual\nflowering of plants and the migration of birds. The more\nthoroughly trained naturalists of our own day detect him now and\nagain in error as to his birds and plants, just as specialists in\nMaine woodcraft discover that he made amusing, and for him\nunaccountable, blunders when he climbed Katahdin. But if he was\nnot impeccable as a naturalist or woodsman, who has ever had more\nfun out of his enthusiasm than Thoreau, and who has ever\nstimulated as many men and women in the happy use of their eyes?\nHe would have had slight patience with much of the sentimental\nnature study of our generation, and certainly an intellectual\ncontempt for much that we read and write about the call of the\nwild; but no reader of his books can escape his infection for the\nfreedom of the woods, for the stark and elemental in nature.\nThoreau’s passion for this aspect of life may have been selfish,\nwolflike, but it is still communicative.",
        "Once, toward the close of his too brief life, Thoreau “signed on\"\nagain to an American ideal, and no man could have signed more\nnobly. It was the cause of Freedom, as represented by John Brown\nof Harper’s Ferry. The French and Scotch blood in the furtive\nhermit suddenly grew hot. Instead of renouncing in disgust the\n“uncivil chaos called Civil Government,” Thoreau challenged it to\na fight. Indeed he had already thrown down the gauntlet in\n“Slavery in Massachusetts,” which Garrison had published in the\n“Liberator” in 1854. And now the death upon the scaffold of the\nold fanatic of Ossawatomie changed Thoreau into a complete\ncitizen, arguing the case and glorifying to his neighbors the\ndead hero. “It seems as if no man had ever died in America\nbefore; for in order to die you must first have lived . . . . I\nhear a good many pretend that they are going to die . . . .\nNonsense! I’ll defy them to do it. They haven’t got life enough\nin them. They’ll deliquesce like fungi, and keep a hundred\neulogists mopping the spot where they left off. Only half a dozen\nor so have died since the world began.” Such passages as this\nreveal a very different Thoreau from the Thoreau who is supposed\nto have spent his days in the company of swamp-blackbirds and\nwoodchucks. He had, in fact, one of the highest qualifications\nfor human society, an absolute honesty of mind. “We select\ngranite,” he says, “for the underpinning of our houses and barns;\nwe build fences of stone; but we do not ourselves rest on an\nunderpinning of granite truth, the lowest primitive rock. Our\nsills are rotten . . . . In proportion as our inward life fails,\nwe go more constantly and desperately to the postoffice. You may\ndepend upon it, that the poor fellow who walks away with the\ngreatest number of letters, proud of his extensive\ncorrespondence, has not heard from himself this long time.”",
        "This hard, basic individualism was for Thoreau the foundation of\nall enduring social relations, and the dullest observer of\ntwentieth century America can see that Thoreau’s doctrine is\nneeded as much as ever. His sharp-edged personality provokes\ncuriosity and pricks the reader into dissent or emulation as the\ncase may be, but its chief ethical value to our generation lies\nin the fact that here was a Transcendentalist who stressed, not\nthe life of the senses, though he was well aware of their\nseductiveness, but the stubborn energy of the will.",
        "The scope of the present book prevents more than a glimpse at the\nother members of the New England Transcendental group. They are a\nvery mixed company, noble, whimsical, queer, impossible. “The\ngood Alcott,” wrote Carlyle, “with his long, lean face and\nfigure, with his gray worn temples and mild radiant eyes; all\nbent on saving the world by a return to acorns and the golden\nage; he comes before one like a venerable Don Quixote, whom\nnobody can laugh at without loving.” These words paint a whole\ncompany, as well as a single man. The good Alcott still awaits an\nadequate biographer. Connecticut Yankee, peddler in the South,\nschool-teacher in Boston and elsewhere, he descended upon\nConcord, flitted to the queer community of Fruitlands, was\nstarved back to Concord, inspired and bored the patient Emerson,\ntalked endlessly, wrote ineffective books, and had at last his\napotheosis in the Concord School of Philosophy, but was chiefly\nknown for the twenty years before his death in 1888 as the father\nof the Louisa Alcott who wrote “Little Women.” “A tedious\narchangel,” was Emerson’s verdict, and it is likely to stand.",
        "Margaret Fuller, though sketched by Hawthorne, analyzed by\nEmerson, and painted at full length by Thomas Wentworth\nHigginson, is now a fading figure–a remarkable woman, no doubt,\none of the first of American feminists, suggesting George Eliot\nin her physical unattractiveness, her clear brain, her touch of\nsensuousness. She was an early-ripe, over-crammed scholar in the\nclassics and in modern European languages. She did loyal, unpaid\nwork as the editor of the “Dial,” which from 1840 to 1844 was the\norgan of Transcendentalism. She joined the community at Brook\nFarm, whose story has been so well told by Lindsay Swift. For a\nwhile she served as literary editor of the “New York Tribune\"\nunder Horace Greeley. Then she went abroad, touched Rousseau’s\nmanuscripts at Paris with trembling, adoring fingers, made a\nsecret marriage in Italy with the young Marquis Ossoli, and\nperished by shipwreck, with her husband and child, off Fire\nIsland in 1850.",
        "Theodore Parker, like Alcott and “Margaret,” an admirable Greek\nscholar, an idealist and reformer, still lives in Chadwick’s\nbiography, in Colonel Higginson’s delightful essay, and in the\nmemories of a few liberal Bostonians who remember his tremendous\nsermons on the platform of the old Music Hall. He was a Lexington\nfarmer’s son, with the temperament of a blacksmith, with\nenormous, restless energy, a good hater, a passionate lover of\nall excellent things save meekness. He died at fifty, worn out,\nin Italy.",
        "But while these three figures were, after Emerson and Thoreau,\nthe most representative of the group, the student of the\nTranscendental period will be equally interested in watching its\ninfluence upon many other types of young men: upon future\njournalists and publicists like George William Curtis, Charles A.\nDana, and George Ripley; upon religionists like Orestes Brownson,\nFather Hecker, and James Freeman Clarke; and upon poets like\nJones Very, Christopher. P. Cranch, and Ellery Channing. There\nwas a sunny side of the whole movement, as T. W. Higginson and F.\nB. Sanborn, two of the latest survivors of the ferment, loved to\nemphasize in their talk and in their books; and it was shadowed\nalso by tragedy and the pathos of unfulfilled desires. But as one\nlooks back at it, in the perspective of three-quarters of a\ncentury, it seems chiefly something touchingly fine. For all\nthese men and women tried to hitch their wagon to a star.",
