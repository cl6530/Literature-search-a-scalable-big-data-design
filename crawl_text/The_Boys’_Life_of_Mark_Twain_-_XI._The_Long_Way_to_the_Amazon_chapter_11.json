        "Sam decided on Cincinnati as his base.  From there he could go either to\nNew York or New Orleans to catch the Amazon boat.  He paid a visit to St.\nLouis, where his mother made him renew his promise as to drink and cards.\nThen he was seized with a literary idea, and returned to Keokuk, where he\nproposed to a thriving weekly paper, the “Saturday Post,” to send letters\nof travel, which might even be made into a book later on.  George Reese,\nowner of the “Post,” agreed to pay five dollars each for the letters,\nwhich speaks well for his faith in Samuel Clemens’s talent, five dollars\nbeing good pay for that time and place–more than the letters were worth,\njudged by present standards.  The first was dated Cincinnati, November\n14, 1856, and was certainly not promising literature.  It was written in\nthe ridiculous dialect which was once thought to be the dress of humor;\nand while here and there is a comic flash, there is in it little promise\nof the future Mark Twain.  One extract is enough:",
        "“When we got to the depo’, I went around to git a look at the iron\n     hoss.  Thunderation!  It wasn’t no more like a hoss than a meetin’-\n     house.  If I was goin’ to describe the animule, I’d say it looked\n     like–well, it looked like–blamed if I know what it looked like,\n     snorting fire and brimstone out of his nostrils, and puffin’ out\n     black smoke all ’round, and pantin’, and heavin’, and swellin’, and\n     chawin’ up red-hot coals like they was good.  A feller stood in a\n     little house like, feedin’ him all the time; but the more he got,\n     the more he wanted and the more he blowed and snorted.  After a\n     spell the feller ketched him by the tail, and great Jericho! he set\n     up a yell that split the ground for more’n a mile and a half, and\n     the next minit I felt my legs a-waggin’, and found myself at t’other\n     end of the string o’ vehickles.  I wasn’t skeered, but I had three\n     chills and a stroke of palsy in less than five minits, and my face\n     had a cur’us brownish-yaller-greenbluish color in it, which was\n     perfectly unaccountable.  ’Well,’ say I, ’comment is super-flu-ous.’”",
        "How Samuel Clemens could have written that, and worse, at twenty-one, and\na little more than ten years later have written “The Innocents Abroad,\"\nis one of the mysteries of literature.  The letters were signed\n“Snodgrass,” and there are but two of them.  Snodgrass seems to have\nfound them hard work, for it is said he raised on the price, which,\nfortunately, brought the series to a close.  Their value to-day lies in\nthe fact that they are the earliest of Mark Twain’s newspaper\ncontributions that have been preserved–the first for which he received a\ncash return.",
        "Sam remained in Cincinnati until April of the following year, 1857,\nworking for Wrightson & Co., general printers, lodging in a cheap\nboarding-house, saving every possible penny for his great adventure.",
        "He had one associate at the boarding-house, a lank, unsmiling Scotchman\nnamed Macfarlane, twice young Clemens’s age, and a good deal of a\nmystery.  Sam never could find out what Macfarlane did.  His hands were\nhardened by some sort of heavy labor; he left at six in the morning and\nreturned in the evening at the same hour.  He never mentioned his work,\nand young Clemens had the delicacy not to inquire.",
        "For Macfarlane was no ordinary person.  He was a man of deep knowledge, a\nreader of many books, a thinker; he was versed in history and philosophy,\nhe knew the dictionary by heart.  He made but two statements concerning\nhimself: one, that he had acquired his knowledge from reading, and not at\nschool; the other, that he knew every word in the English dictionary.  He\nwas willing to give proof of the last, and Sam Clemens tested him more\nthan once, but found no word that Macfarlane could not define.",
        "Macfarlane was not silent–he would discuss readily enough the deeper\nproblems of life and had many startling theories of his own.  Darwin had\nnot yet published his “Descent of Man,” yet Macfarlane was already\nadvancing ideas similar to those in that book.  He went further than\nDarwin.  He had startling ideas of the moral evolution of man, and these\nhe would pour into the ears of his young listener until ten o’clock,\nafter which, like the English Sumner in Philadelphia, he would grill a\nherring, and the evening would end.  Those were fermenting discourses\nthat young Samuel Clemens listened to that winter in Macfarlane’s room,\nand they did not fail to influence his later thought.",
        "It was the high-tide of spring, late in April, when the prospective\ncocoa-hunter decided that it was time to set out for the upper Amazon.\nHe had saved money enough to carry him at least as far as New Orleans,\nwhere he would take ship, it being farther south and therefore nearer his\ndestination.  Furthermore, he could begin with a lazy trip down the\nMississippi, which, next to being a pilot, had been one of his most\ncherished dreams.  The Ohio River steamers were less grand than those of\nthe Mississippi, but they had a homelike atmosphere and did not hurry.\nSamuel Clemens had the spring fever and was willing to take his time.",
        "In “Life on the Mississippi” we read that the author ran away, vowing\nnever to return until he could come home a pilot, shedding glory.  But\nthis is the fiction touch.  He had always loved the river, and his\nboyhood dream of piloting had time and again returned, but it was not\nuppermost when he bade good-by to Macfarlane and stepped aboard the “Paul\nJones,” bound for New Orleans, and thus conferred immortality on that\nancient little craft.",
        "Now he had really started on his voyage.  But it was a voyage that would\ncontinue not for a week or a fortnight, but for four years–four\nmarvelous, sunlit years, the glory of which would color all that followed\nthem.",
