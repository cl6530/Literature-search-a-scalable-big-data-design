        "[1] The volume of Greek Studies, issued early in the present year,\ndealt with Mr. Pater’s contributions to the study of Greek art,\nmythology, and poetry.  The present volume has no such unifying\nprinciple.  Some of the papers would naturally find their place\nalongside of those collected in Imaginary Portraits, or in\nAppreciations, or in the Studies in the Renaissance.  And there is no\ndoubt, in the case of several of them, that Mr. Pater, if he had\nlived, would have subjected them to careful revision before allowing\nthem to reappear in a permanent form.  The task, which he left\nunexecuted, cannot now be taken up by any other hand.  But it is\nhoped that students of his writings will be glad to possess, in a\ncollected shape, what has hitherto only been accessible in the\nscattered volumes of magazines.  It is with some hesitation that the\npaper on Diaphaneite, the last in this volume, has been added, as the\nonly specimen known to [2] be preserved of those early essays of Mr.\nPater’s, by which his literary gifts were first made known to the\nsmall circle of his Oxford friends.",

        "FOR one born in eighteen hundred and three much was recently become\nincredible that had at least warmed the imagination even of the\nsceptical eighteenth century.  Napoleon, sealing the tomb of the\nRevolution, had foreclosed many a problem, extinguished many a hope,\nin the sphere of practice.  And the mental parallel was drawn by\nHeine.  In the mental world too a great outlook had lately been cut\noff.  After Kant’s criticism of the mind, its pretensions to pass\nbeyond the limits of individual experience seemed as dead as those of\nold French royalty.  And Kant did but furnish its innermost theoretic\nforce to a more general criticism, which had withdrawn from every\ndepartment of action, underlying principles once thought eternal.  A\ntime of disillusion followed.  The typical personality of the day was\nObermann, the very genius of ennui, a Frenchman disabused even of\npatriotism, who has hardly strength enough to die.",
        "[12] More energetic souls, however, would recover themselves, and\nfind some way of making the best of a changed world.  Art: the\npassions, above all, the ecstasy and sorrow of love: a purely\nempirical knowledge of nature and man: these still remained, at least\nfor pastime, in a world of which it was no longer proposed to\ncalculate the remoter issues:–art, passion, science, however, in a\nsomewhat novel attitude towards the practical interests of life.  The\ndesillusionne, who had found in Kant’s negations the last word\nconcerning an unseen world, and is living, on the morrow of the\nRevolution, under a monarchy made out of hand, might seem cut off\nfrom certain ancient natural hopes, and will demand, from what is to\ninterest him at all, something in the way of artificial stimulus.  He\nhas lost that sense of large proportion in things, that all-embracing\nprospect of life as a whole (from end to end of time and space, it\nhad seemed), the utmost expanse of which was afforded from a\ncathedral tower of the Middle Age: by the church of the thirteenth\ncentury, that is to say, with its consequent aptitude for the\nco-ordination of human effort.  Deprived of that exhilarating yet\npacific outlook, imprisoned now in the narrow cell of its own\nsubjective experience, the action of a powerful nature will be\nintense, but exclusive and peculiar.  It will come to art, or\nscience, to the experience of life itself, not as to portions of\nhuman nature’s daily food, but as to [13] something that must be, by\nthe circumstances of the case, exceptional; almost as men turn in\ndespair to gambling or narcotics, and in a little while the narcotic,\nthe game of chance or skill, is valued for its own sake.  The\nvocation of the artist, of the student of life or books, will be\nrealised with something–say! of fanaticism, as an end in itself,\nunrelated, unassociated.  The science he turns to will be a science\nof crudest fact; the passion extravagant, a passionate love of\npassion, varied through all the exotic phases of French fiction as\ninaugurated by Balzac; the art exaggerated, in matter or form, or\nboth, as in Hugo or Baudelaire.  The development of these conditions\nis the mental story of the nineteenth century, especially as\nexemplified in France.",
        "In no century would Prosper Merimee have been a theologian or\nmetaphysician.  But that sense of negation, of theoretic insecurity,\nwas in the air, and conspiring with what was of like tendency in\nhimself made of him a central type of disillusion.  In him the\npassive ennui of Obermann became a satiric, aggressive, almost angry\nconviction of the littleness of the world around; it was as if man’s\nfatal limitations constituted a kind of stupidity in him, what the\nFrench call betise.  Gossiping friends, indeed, linked what was\nconstitutional in him and in the age with an incident of his earliest\nyears.  Corrected for some childish fault, in passionate distress, he\noverhears a half-pitying laugh at his expense, and has determined,\n[14] in a moment, never again to give credit–to be for ever on his\nguard, especially against his own instinctive movements.  Quite\nunreserved, certainly, he never was again.  Almost everywhere he\ncould detect the hollow ring of fundamental nothingness under the\napparent surface of things.  Irony surely, habitual irony, would be\nthe proper complement thereto, on his part.  In his infallible self-\npossession, you might even fancy him a mere man of the world, with a\nspecial aptitude for matters of fact.  Though indifferent in\npolitics, he rises to social, to political eminence; but all the\nwhile he is feeding all his scholarly curiosity, his imagination, the\nvery eye, with the, to him ever delightful, relieving, reassuring\nspectacle, of those straightforward forces in human nature, which are\nalso matters of fact.  There is the formula of Merimee! the\nenthusiastic amateur of rude, crude, naked force in men and women\nwherever it could be found; himself carrying ever, as a mask, the\nconventional attire of the modern world–carrying it with an\ninfinite, contemptuous grace, as if that, too, were an all-sufficient\nend in itself.  With a natural gift for words, for expression, it\nwill be his literary function to draw back the veil of time from the\ntrue greatness of old Roman character; the veil of modern habit from\nthe primitive energy of the creatures of his fancy, as the Lettres a\nune Inconnue discovered to general gaze, after his death, a certain\ndepth of [15] passionate force which had surprised him in himself.\nAnd how forcible will be their outlines in an otherwise insignificant\nworld!  Fundamental belief gone, in almost all of us, at least some\nrelics of it remain–queries, echoes, reactions, after-thoughts; and\nthey help to make an atmosphere, a mental atmosphere, hazy perhaps,\nyet with many secrets of soothing light and shade, associating more\ndefinite objects to each other by a perspective pleasant to the\ninward eye against a hopefully receding background of remoter and\never remoter possibilities.  Not so with Merimee!  For him the\nfundamental criticism has nothing more than it can do; and there are\nno half-lights.  The last traces of hypothesis, of supposition, are\nevaporated.  Sylla, the false Demetrius, Carmen, Colomba, that\nimpassioned self within himself, have no atmosphere.  Painfully\ndistinct in outline, inevitable to sight, unrelieved, there they\nstand, like solitary mountain forms on some hard, perfectly\ntransparent day.  What Merimee gets around his singularly\nsculpturesque creations is neither more nor less than empty space.",
        "So disparate are his writings that at first sight you might fancy\nthem only the random efforts of a man of pleasure or affairs, who,\nturning to this or that for the relief of a vacant hour, discovers to\nhis surprise a workable literary gift, of whose scope, however, he is\nnot precisely aware.  His sixteen volumes nevertheless range\nthemselves in three compact groups.  There are his letters [16] –\nthose Lettres a une Inconnue, and his letters to the librarian\nPanizzi, revealing him in somewhat close contact with political\nintrigue.  But in this age of novelists, it is as a writer of novels,\nand of fiction in the form of highly descriptive drama, that he will\ncount for most:–Colomba, for instance, by its intellectual depth of\nmotive, its firmly conceived structure, by the faultlessness of its\nexecution, vindicating the function of the novel as no tawdry light\nliterature, but in very deed a fine art.  The Chronique du Regne de\nCharles IX., an unusually successful specimen of historical romance,\nlinks his imaginative work to the third group of Merimee’s writings,\nhis historical essays.  One resource of the disabused soul of our\ncentury, as we saw, would be the empirical study of facts, the\nempirical science of nature and man, surviving all dead metaphysical\nphilosophies.  Merimee, perhaps, may have had in him the making of a\nmaster of such science, disinterested, patient, exact: scalpel in\nhand, we may fancy, he would have penetrated far.  But quite\ncertainly he had something of genius for the exact study of history,\nfor the pursuit of exact truth, with a keenness of scent as if that\nalone existed, in some special area of historic fact, to be\ndetermined by his own peculiar mental preferences.  Power here too\nagain,–the crude power of men and women which mocks, while it makes\nits use of, average human nature: it was the magic function of\nhistory to put one in living [17] contact with that.  To weigh the\npurely physiognomic import of the memoir, of the pamphlet saved by\nchance, the letter, the anecdote, the very gossip by which one came\nface to face with energetic personalities: there lay the true\nbusiness of the historic student, not in that pretended theoretic\ninterpretation of events by their mechanic causes, with which he\ndupes others if not invariably himself.  In the great hero of the\nSocial War, in Sylla, studied, indeed, through his environment, but\nonly so far as that was in dynamic contact with himself, you saw,\nwithout any manner of doubt, on one side, the solitary height of\nhuman genius; on the other, though on the seemingly so heroic stage\nof antique Roman story, the wholly inexpressive level of the humanity\nof every day, the spectacle of man’s eternal betise.  Fascinated,\nlike a veritable son of the old pagan Renaissance, by the grandeur,\nthe concentration, the satiric hardness of ancient Roman character,\nit is to Russia nevertheless that he most readily turns–youthful\nRussia, whose native force, still unbelittled by our western\ncivilisation, seemed to have in it the promise of a more dignified\ncivilisation to come.  It was as if old Rome itself were here again;\nas, occasionally, a new quarry is laid open of what was thought long\nsince exhausted, ancient marble, cipollino or verde antique.\nMerimee, indeed, was not the first to discern the fitness for\nimaginative service of the career of “the false Demetrius,” pretended\n[18] son of Ivan the Terrible; but he alone seeks its utmost force in\na calm, matter-of-fact carefully ascertained presentment of the naked\nevents.  Yes!  In the last years of the Valois, when its fierce\npassions seemed to be bursting France to pieces, you might have seen,\nfar away beyond the rude Polish dominion of which one of those Valois\nprinces had become king, a display more effective still of\nexceptional courage and cunning, of horror in circumstance, of\nbetise, of course, of betise and a slavish capacity of being duped,\nin average mankind: all that under a mask of solemn Muscovite court-\nceremonial.  And Merimee’s style, simple and unconcerned, but with\nthe eye ever on its object, lends itself perfectly to such purpose–\nto an almost phlegmatic discovery of the facts, in all their crude\nnatural colouring, as if he but held up to view, as a piece of\nevidence, some harshly dyed oriental carpet from the sumptuous floor\nof the Kremlin, on which blood had fallen.",
        "A lover of ancient Rome, its great character and incident, Merimee\nvalued, as if it had been personal property of his, every extant\nrelic of it in the art that had been most expressive of its genius–\narchitecture.  In that grandiose art of building, the most national,\nthe most tenaciously rooted of all the arts in the stable conditions\nof life, there were historic documents hardly less clearly legible\nthan the manuscript chronicle.  By the mouth of those stately\nRomanesque [19] churches, scattered in so many strongly characterised\nvarieties over the soil of France, above all in the hot, half-pagan\nsouth, the people of empire still protested, as he understood,\nagainst what must seem a smaller race.  The Gothic enthusiasm indeed\nwas already born, and he shared it–felt intelligently the\nfascination of the Pointed Style, but only as a further\ntransformation of old Roman structure; the round arch is for him\nstill the great architectural form, la forme noble, because it was to\nbe seen in the monuments of antiquity.  Romanesque, Gothic, the\nmanner of the Renaissance, of Lewis the Fourteenth:–they were all,\nas in a written record, in the old abbey church of Saint-Savin, of\nwhich Merimee was instructed to draw up a report.  Again, it was as\nif to his concentrated attention through many months that deserted\nsanctuary of Benedict were the only thing on earth.  Its beauties,\nits peculiarities, its odd military features, its faded mural\npaintings, are no merely picturesque matter for the pencil he could\nuse so well, but the lively record of a human society.  With what\nappetite! with all the animation of George Sand’s Mauprat, he tells\nthe story of romantic violence having its way there, defiant of law,\nso late as the year 1611; of the family of robber nobles perched, as\nabbots in commendam, in those sacred places.  That grey, pensive old\nchurch in the little valley of Poitou, was for a time like Santa\nMaria del Fiore to [20] Michelangelo, the mistress of his affections-\n-of a practical affection; for the result of his elaborate report was\nthe Government grant which saved the place from ruin.  In\narchitecture, certainly, he had what for that day was nothing less\nthan intuition–an intuitive sense, above all, of its logic, of the\nnecessity which draws  into one all minor changes, as elements in a\nreasonable development.  And his care for it, his curiosity about it,\nwere symptomatic of his own genius.  Structure, proportion, design, a\nsort of architectural coherency: that was the aim of his method in\nthe art of literature, in that form of it, especially, which he will\nlive by, in fiction.",
        "As historian and archaeologist, as a man of erudition turned artist,\nhe is well seen in the Chronique du Regne de Charles IX., by which we\npass naturally from Merimee’s critical or scientific work to the\nproducts of his imagination.  What economy in the use of a large\nantiquarian knowledge! what an instinct amid a hundred details, for\nthe detail that carries physiognomy in it, that really tells!  And\nagain what outline, what absolute clarity of outline!  For the\nhistorian of that puzzling age which centres in the “Eve of Saint\nBartholomew,” outward events themselves seem obscured by the\nvagueness of motive of the actors in them.  But Merimee, disposing of\nthem as an artist, not in love with half-lights, compels events and\nactors alike to the clearness he [21] desired; takes his side without\nhesitation; and makes his hero a Huguenot of pure blood, allowing its\ncharm, in that charming youth, even to Huguenot piety.  And as for\nthe incidents–however freely it may be undermined by historic doubt,\nall reaches a perfectly firm surface, at least for the eye of the\nreader.  The Chronicle of Charles the Ninth is like a series of\nmasterly drawings in illustration of a period–the period in which\ntwo other masters of French fiction have found their opportunity,\nmainly by the development of its actual historic characters.  Those\ncharacters–Catherine de Medicis and the rest–Merimee, with\nsignificant irony and self-assertion, sets aside, preferring to think\nof them as essentially commonplace.  For him the interest lies in the\ncreatures of his own will, who carry in them, however, so lightly! a\nlearning equal to Balzac’s, greater than that of Dumas.  He knows\nwith like completeness the mere fashions of the time–how courtier\nand soldier dressed themselves, and the large movements of the\ndesperate game which fate or chance was playing with those pretty\npieces.  Comparing that favourite century of the French Renaissance\nwith our own, he notes a decadence of the more energetic passions in\nthe interest of general tranquillity, and perhaps (only perhaps!) of\ngeneral happiness.  “Assassination,” he observes, as if with regret,\n\"is no longer a part of our manners.”  In fact, the duel, and the\nwhole [22] morality of the duel, which does but enforce a certain\nregularity on assassination, what has been well called le sentiment\ndu fer, the sentiment of deadly steel, had then the disposition of\nrefined existence.  It was, indeed, very different, and is, in\nMerimee’s romance.  In his gallant hero, Bernard de Mergy, all the\npromptings of the lad’s virile goodness are in natural collusion with\nthat sentiment du fer.  Amid his ingenuous blushes, his prayers, and\nplentiful tears between-while, it is a part of his very sex.  With\nhis delightful, fresh-blown air, he is for ever tossing the sheath\nfrom the sword, but always as if into bright natural sunshine.  A\nwinsome, yet withal serious and even piteous figure, he conveys his\npleasantness, in spite of its gloomy theme, into Merimee’s one quite\ncheerful book.",
        "Cheerful, because, after all, the gloomy passions it presents are but\nthe accidents of a particular age, and not like the mental conditions\nin which Merimee was most apt to look for the spectacle of human\npower, allied to madness or disease in the individual.  For him, at\nleast, it was the office of fiction to carry one into a different if\nnot a better world than that actually around us; and if the Chronicle\nof Charles the Ninth provided an escape from the tame circumstances\nof contemporary life into an impassioned past, Colomba is a measure\nof the resources for mental alteration which may be found even in the\nmodern age.  There was a corner of [23] the French Empire, in the\nmanners of which assassination still had a large part.",
        "“The beauty of Corsica,” says Merimee, “is grave and sad.  The aspect\nof the capital does but augment the impression caused by the solitude\nthat surrounds it.  There is no movement in the streets.  You hear\nthere none of the laughter, the singing, the loud talking, common in\nthe towns of Italy.  Sometimes, under the shadow of a tree on the\npromenade, a dozen armed peasants will be playing cards, or looking\non at the game.  The Corsican is naturally silent.  Those who walk\nthe pavement are all strangers: the islanders stand at their doors:\nevery one seems to be on the watch, like a falcon on its nest.  All\naround the gulf there is but an expanse of tanglework; beyond it,\nbleached mountains.  Not a habitation!  Only, here and there, on the\nheights about the town, certain white constructions detach themselves\nfrom the background of green.  They are funeral chapels or family\ntombs.”",
        "Crude in colour, sombre, taciturn, Corsica, as Merimee here describes\nit, is like the national passion of the Corsican–that morbid\npersonal pride, usurping the place even of grief for the dead, which\ncenturies of traditional violence had concentrated into an all-\nabsorbing passion for bloodshed, for bloody revenges, in collusion\nwith the natural wildness, and the wild social condition of the\nisland still unaffected even by the finer [24] ethics of the duel.\nThe supremacy of that passion is well indicated by the cry, put into\nthe mouth of a young man in the presence of the corpse of his father\ndeceased in the course of nature–a young man meant to be\ncommonplace.  “Ah!  Would thou hadst died malamorte–by violence!  We\nmight have avenged thee!”",
        "In Colomba, Merimee’s best known creation, it is united to a\nsingularly wholesome type of personal beauty, a natural grace of\nmanner which is irresistible, a cunning intellect patiently diverting\nevery circumstance to its design; and presents itself as a kind of\ngenius, allied to fatal disease of mind.  The interest of Merimee’s\nbook is that it allows us to watch the action of this malignant power\non Colomba’s brother, Orso della Robbia, as it discovers, rouses,\nconcentrates to the leaping-point, in the somewhat weakly diffused\nnature of the youth, the dormant elements of a dark humour akin to\nher own.  Two years after his father’s murder, presumably at the\ninstigation of his ancestral enemies, the young lieutenant is\nreturning home in the company of two humorously conventional English\npeople, himself now half Parisianised, with an immense natural\ncheerfulness, and willing to believe an account of the crime which\nrelieves those hated Barricini of all complicity in its guilt.  But\nfrom the first, Colomba, with “voice soft and musical,” is at his\nside, gathering every accident and echo and circumstance, the very\nlightest circumstance, [25] into the chain of necessity which draws\nhim to the action every one at home expects of him as the head of his\nrace.  He is not unaware.  Her very silence on the matter speaks so\nplainly.  “You are forming me!” he admits.  “Well! ’Hot shot, or cold\nsteel!’–you see I have not forgotten my Corsican.”  More and more,\nas he goes on his way with her, he finds himself accessible to the\ndamning thoughts he has so long combated.  In horror, he tries to\ndisperse them by the memory of his comrades in the regiment, the\ndrawing-rooms of Paris, the English lady who has promised to be his\nbride, and will shortly visit him in the humble manoir of his\nancestors.  From his first step among them the villagers of\nPietranera, divided already into two rival camps, are watching him in\nsuspense–Pietranera, perched among those deep forests where the\nstifled sense of violent death is everywhere.  Colomba places in his\nhands the little chest which contains the father’s shirt covered with\ngreat spots of blood.  “Behold the lead that struck him!” and she\nlaid on the shirt two rusted bullets.  “Orso! you will avenge him!\"\nShe embraces him with a kind of madness, kisses wildly the bullets\nand the shirt, leaves him with the terrible relics already exerting\ntheir mystic power upon him.  It is as if in the nineteenth century a\ngirl, amid Christian habits, had gone back to that primitive old\npagan version of the story of the Grail, which [26] identifies it not\nwith the Most Precious Blood, but only with the blood of a murdered\nrelation crying for vengeance.  Awake at last in his old chamber at\nPietranera, the house of the Barricini at the other end of the\nsquare, with its rival tower and rudely carved escutcheons, stares\nhim in the face.  His ancestral enemy is there, an aged man now, but\nwith two well-grown sons, like two stupid dumb animals, whose\ninnocent blood will soon be on his so oddly lighted conscience.  At\ntimes, his better hope seemed to lie in picking a quarrel and killing\nat least in fair fight, one of these two stupid dumb animals; with\nrude ill-suppressed laughter one day, as they overhear Colomba’s\nviolent utterances at a funeral feast, for she is a renowned\nimprovisatrice.  “Your father is an old man,” he finds himself\nsaying, “I could crush with my hands.  ’Tis for you I am destined,\nfor you and your brother!”  And if it is by course of nature that the\nold man dies not long after the murder of these sons (self-provoked\nafter all), dies a fugitive at Pisa, as it happens, by an odd\naccident, in the presence of Colomba, no violent death by Orso’s own\nhand could have been more to her mind.  In that last hard page of\nMerimee’s story, mere dramatic propriety itself for a moment seems to\nplead for the forgiveness, which from Joseph and his brethren to the\npresent day, as we know, has been as winning in story as in actual\nlife.  Such dramatic propriety, however, was by no means [27] in\nMerimee’s way.  “What I must have is the hand that fired the shot,\"\nshe had sung, “the eye that guided it; aye! and the mind moreover–\nthe mind, which had conceived the deed!”  And now, it is in idiotic\nterror, a fugitive from Orso’s vengeance, that the last of the\nBarricini is dying.",
        "Exaggerated art! you think.  But it was precisely such exaggerated\nart, intense, unrelieved, an art of fierce colours, that is needed by\nthose who are seeking in art, as I said of Merimee, a kind of\nartificial stimulus.  And if his style is still impeccably correct,\ncold-blooded, impersonal, as impersonal as that of Scott himself, it\ndoes but conduce the better to his one exclusive aim.  It is like the\npolish of the stiletto Colomba carried always under her mantle, or\nthe beauty of the fire-arms, that beauty coming of nice adaptation to\npurpose, which she understood so well–a task characteristic also of\nMerimee himself, a sort of fanatic joy in the perfect pistol-shot, at\nits height in the singular story he has translated from the Russian\nof Pouchkine.  Those raw colours he preferred; Spanish, Oriental,\nAfrican, perhaps, irritant certainly to cisalpine eyes, he\nundoubtedly attained the colouring you associate with sun-stroke,\nonly possible under a sun in which dead things rot quickly.",
        "Pity and terror, we know, go to the making of the essential tragic\nsense.  In Merimee, certainly, we have all its terror, but without\nthe [28] pity.  Saint-Clair, the consent of his mistress barely\nattained at last, rushes madly on self-destruction, that he may die\nwith the taste of his great love fresh on his lips.  All the\ngrotesque accidents of violent death he records with visual\nexactness, and no pains to relieve them; the ironic indifference, for\ninstance, with which, on the scaffold or the battle-field, a man will\nseem to grin foolishly at the ugly rents through which his life has\npassed.  Seldom or never has the mere pen of a writer taken us so\nclose to the cannon’s mouth as in the Taking of the Redoubt, while\nMatteo Falcone–twenty-five short pages–is perhaps the cruellest\nstory in the world.",
        "Colomba, that strange, fanatic being, who has a code of action, of\nself-respect, a conscience, all to herself, who with all her virginal\ncharm only does not make you hate her, is, in truth, the type of a\nsort of humanity Merimee found it pleasant to dream of–a humanity as\nalien as the animals, with whose moral affinities to man his\nimaginative work is often directly concerned.  Were they so alien,\nafter all?  Were there not survivals of the old wild creatures in the\ngentlest, the politest of us?  Stories that told of sudden freaks of\ngentle, polite natures, straight back, not into Paradise, were always\nwelcome to men’s fancies; and that could only be because they found a\npsychologic truth in them.  With much success, with a credibility\ninsured by his literary tact, Merimee tried his own hand at such\nstories: unfrocked the [29] bear in the amorous young Lithuanian\nnoble, the wolf in the revolting peasant of the Middle Age.  There\nwere survivals surely in himself, in that stealthy presentment of his\nfavourite themes, in his own art.  You seem to find your hand on a\nserpent, in reading him.",
        "In such survivals, indeed, you see the operation of his favourite\nmotive, the sense of wild power, under a sort of mask, or assumed\nhabit, realised as the very genius of nature itself; and that\ninterest, with some superstitions closely allied to it, the belief in\nthe vampire, for instance, is evidenced especially in certain\npretended Illyrian compositions–prose translations, the reader was\nto understand, of more or less ancient popular ballads; La Guzla, he\ncalled the volume, The Lyre, as we might say; only that the\ninstrument of the Illyrian minstrel had but one string.  Artistic\ndeception, a trick of which there is something in the historic\nromance as such, in a book like his own Chronicle of Charles the\nNinth, was always welcome to Merimee; it was part of the machinery of\nhis rooted habit of intellectual reserve.  A master of irony also, in\nMadame Lucrezia he seems to wish to expose his own method cynically;\nto explain his art–how he takes you in–as a clever, confident\nconjuror might do.  So properly were the readers of La Guzla taken in\nthat he followed up his success in that line by the Theatre of Clara\nGazul, purporting to be from a rare Spanish original, the work [30]\nof a nun, who, under tame, conventual reading, had felt the touch of\nmundane, of physical passions; had become a dramatic poet, and\nherself a powerful actress.  It may dawn on you in reading her that\nMerimee was a kind of Webster, but with the superficial mildness of\nour nineteenth century.  At the bottom of the true drama there is\never, logically at least, the ballad: the ballad dealing in a kind of\nshort-hand (or, say! in grand, simple, universal outlines) with those\npassions, crimes, mistakes, which have a kind of fatality in them, a\nkind of necessity to come to the surface of the human mind, if not to\nthe surface of our experience, as in the case of some frankly\nsupernatural incidents which Merimee re-handled.  Whether human love\nor hatred has had most to do in shaping the universal fancy that the\ndead come back, I cannot say.  Certainly that old ballad literature\nhas instances in plenty, in which the voice, the hand, the brief\nvisit from the grave, is a natural response to the cry of the human\ncreature.  That ghosts should return, as they do so often in\nMerimee’s fiction, is but a sort of natural justice.  Only, in\nMerimee’s prose ballads, in those admirable, short, ballad-like\nstories, where every word tells, of which he was a master, almost the\ninventor, they are a kind of half-material ghosts–a vampire tribe–\nand never come to do people good; congruously with the mental\nconstitution of the writer, which, alike in fact and fiction, [31]\ncould hardly have horror enough–theme after theme.  Merimee himself\nemphasises this almost constant motive of his fiction when he adds to\none of his volumes of short stories some letters on a matter of fact-\n-a Spanish bull-fight, in which those old Romans, he regretted, might\nseem, decadently, to have survived.  It is as if you saw it.  In\ntruth, Merimee was the unconscious parent of much we may think of\ndubious significance in later French literature.  It is as if there\nwere nothing to tell of in this world but various forms of hatred,\nand a love that is like lunacy; and the only other world, a world of\nmaliciously active, hideous, dead bodies.",
        "Merimee, a literary artist, was not a man who used two words where\none would do better, and he shines especially in those brief\ncompositions which, like a minute intaglio, reveal at a glance his\nwonderful faculty of design and proportion in the treatment of his\nwork, in which there is not a touch but counts.  That is an art of\nwhich there are few examples in English; our somewhat diffuse, or\nslipshod, literary language hardly lending itself to the\nconcentration of thought and expression, which are of the essence of\nsuch writing.  It is otherwise in French, and if you wish to know\nwhat art of that kind can come to, read Merimee’s little romances;\nbest of all, perhaps, La Venus d’Ille and Arsene Guillot.  The former\nis a modern version of the beautiful old story of the Ring given to\nVenus, given to her, in [32] this case, by a somewhat sordid creature\nof the nineteenth century, whom she looks on with more than disdain.\nThe strange outline of the Canigou, one of the most imposing outlying\nheights of the Pyrenees, down the mysterious slopes of which the\ntraveller has made his way towards nightfall into the great plain of\nToulouse, forms an impressive background, congruous with the many\nrelics of irrepressible old paganism there, but in entire contrast to\nthe bourgeois comfort of the place where his journey is to end, the\nabode of an aged antiquary, loud and bright just now with the\ncelebration of a vulgar worldly marriage.  In the midst of this well-\nbeing, prosaic in spite of the neighbourhood, in spite of the pretty\nold wedding customs, morsels of that local colour in which Merimee\ndelights, the old pagan powers are supposed to reveal themselves once\nmore (malignantly, of course), in the person of a magnificent bronze\nstatue of Venus recently unearthed in the antiquary’s garden.  On her\nfinger, by ill-luck, the coarse young bridegroom on the morning of\nhis marriage places for a moment the bridal ring only too effectually\n(the bronze hand closes, like a wilful living one, upon it), and\ndies, you are to understand, in her angry metallic embraces on his\nmarriage night.  From the first, indeed, she had seemed bent on\ncrushing out men’s degenerate bodies and souls, though the\nsupernatural horror of the tale is adroitly made credible by a\ncertain vagueness in the [33] events, which covers a quite natural\naccount of the bridegroom’s mysterious death.",
        "The intellectual charm of literary work so thoroughly designed as\nMerimee’s depends in part on the sense as you read, hastily perhaps,\nperhaps in need of patience, that you are dealing with a composition,\nthe full secret of which is only to be attained in the last\nparagraph, that with the last word in mind you will retrace your\nsteps, more than once (it may be) noting then the minuter structure,\nalso the natural or wrought flowers by the way.  Nowhere is such\nmethod better illustrated than by another of Merimee’s quintessential\npieces, Arsene Guillotand here for once with a conclusion ethically\nacceptable also.  Merimee loved surprises in human nature, but it is\nnot often that he surprises us by tenderness or generosity of\ncharacter, as another master of French fiction, M. Octave Feuillet,\nis apt to do; and the simple pathos of Arsene Guillot gives it a\nunique place in Merimee’s writings.  It may be said, indeed, that\nonly an essentially pitiful nature could have told the exquisitely\ncruel story of Matteo Falcone precisely as Merimee has told it; and\nthose who knew him testify abundantly to his own capacity for\ngenerous friendship.  He was no more wanting than others in those\nnatural sympathies (sending tears to the eyes at the sight of\nsuffering age or childhood) which happily are no extraordinary\ncomponent in men’s natures.  It was, perhaps, no fitting return for a\n[34] friendship of over thirty years to publish posthumously those\nLettres a une Inconnue, which reveal that reserved, sensitive, self-\ncentred nature, a little pusillanimously in the power, at the\ndisposition of another.  For just there lies the interest, the\npsychological interest, of those letters.  An amateur of power, of\nthe spectacle of power and force, followed minutely but without\nsensibility on his part, with a kind of cynic pride rather for the\nmainspring of his method, both of thought and expression, you find\nhim here taken by surprise at last, and somewhat humbled, by an\nunsuspected force of affection in himself.  His correspondent,\nunknown but for these letters except just by name, figures in them\nas, in truth, a being only too much like himself, seen from one side;\nreflects his taciturnity, his touchiness, his incredulity except for\nself-torment.  Agitated, dissatisfied, he is wrestling in her with\nhimself, his own difficult qualities.  He demands from her a freedom,\na frankness, he would have been the last to grant.  It is by first\nthoughts, of course, that what is forcible and effective in human\nnature, the force, therefore, of carnal love, discovers itself; and\nfor her first thoughts Merimee is always pleading, but always\ncomplaining that he gets only her second thoughts; the thoughts, that\nis, of a reserved, self-limiting nature, well under the yoke of\nconvention, like his own.  Strange conjunction!  At the beginning of\nthe correspondence he seems to have been [35] seeking only a fine\nintellectual companionship; the lady, perhaps, looking for something\nwarmer.  Towards such companionship that likeness to himself in her\nmight have been helpful, but was not enough of a complement to his\nown nature to be anything but an obstruction in love; and it is to\nthat, little by little, that his humour turns.  He–the\nMegalopsychus, as Aristotle defines him–acquires all the lover’s\nhumble habits: himself displays all the tricks of love, its\ncasuistries, its exigency, its superstitions, aye! even its\nvulgarities; involves with the significance of his own genius the\nmere hazards and inconsequence of a perhaps average nature; but too\nlate in the day–the years.  After the attractions and repulsions of\nhalf a lifetime, they are but friends, and might forget to be that,\nbut for his death, clearly presaged in his last weak, touching\nletter, just two hours before.  There, too, had been the blind and\nnaked force of nature and circumstance, surprising him in the\nuncontrollable movements of his own so carefully guarded heart.",
        "The intimacy, the effusion, the so freely exposed personality of\nthose letters does but emphasise the fact that impersonality was, in\nliterary art, Merimee’s central aim.  Personality versus\nimpersonality in art:–how much or how little of one’s self one may\nput into one’s work: whether anything at all of it: whether one can\nput there anything else:–is clearly a far-reaching and complex\nquestion.  Serviceable as [36] the basis of a precautionary maxim\ntowards the conduct of our work, self-effacement, or impersonality,\nin literary or artistic creation, is, perhaps, after all, as little\npossible as a strict realism.  “It has always been my rule to put\nnothing of myself into my works,” says another great master of French\nprose, Gustave Flaubert; but, luckily as we may think, he often\nfailed in thus effacing himself, as he too was aware.  “It has always\nbeen my rule to put nothing of myself into my works” (to be\ndisinterested in his literary creations, so to speak), “yet I have\nput much of myself into them”: and where he failed Merimee succeeded.\nThere they stand–Carmen, Colomba, the “False” Demetrius–as detached\nfrom him as from each other, with no more filial likeness to their\nmaker than if they were the work of another person.  And to his\nmethod of conception, Merimee’s much-praised literary style, his\nmethod of expression, is strictly conformable–impersonal in its\nbeauty, the perfection of nobody’s style–thus vindicating anew by\nits very impersonality that much worn, but not untrue saying, that\nthe style is the man:–a man, impassible, unfamiliar, impeccable,\nveiling a deep sense of what is forcible, nay, terrible, in things,\nunder the sort of personal pride that makes a man a nice observer of\nall that is most conventional.  Essentially unlike other people, he\nis always fastidiously in the fashion–an expert in all the little,\nhalf- [37] contemptuous elegances of which it is capable.  Merimee’s\nsuperb self-effacement, his impersonality, is itself but an effective\npersonal trait, and, transferred to art, becomes a markedly peculiar\nquality of literary beauty.  For, in truth, this creature of\ndisillusion who had no care for half-lights, and, like his creations,\nhad no atmosphere about him, gifted as he was with pure mind, with\nthe quality which secures flawless literary structure, had, on the\nother hand, nothing of what we call soul in literature:–hence, also,\nthat singular harshness in his ideal, as if, in theological language,\nhe were incapable of grace.  He has none of those subjectivities,\ncolourings, peculiarities of mental refraction, which necessitate\nvarieties of style–could we spare such?–and render the perfections\nof it no merely negative qualities.  There are masters of French\nprose whose art has begun where the art of Merimee leaves off.",

        "[38] By his immense productiveness, by the even perfection of what he\nproduced, its fitness to its own day, its hold on posterity, in the\nsuavity of his life, some would add in the “opportunity” of his early\ndeath, Raphael may seem a signal instance of the luckiness, of the\ngood fortune, of genius.  Yet, if we follow the actual growth of his\npowers, within their proper framework, the age of the Renaissance–an\nage of which we may say, summarily, that it enjoyed itself, and found\nperhaps its chief enjoyment in the attitude of the scholar, in the\nenthusiastic acquisition of knowledge for its own sake:–if we thus\nview Raphael and his works in their environment we shall find even\nhis seemingly mechanical good fortune hardly distinguishable from his\nown patient disposal of the means at hand.  Facile master as he may\nseem, as indeed he is, he is also one of the world’s typical\nscholars, with [39] Plato, and Cicero, and Virgil, and Milton.  The\nformula of his genius, if we must have one, is this: genius by\naccumulation; the transformation of meek scholarship into genius–\ntriumphant power of genius.",
        "Urbino, where this prince of the Renaissance was born in 1483, year\nalso of the birth of Luther, leader of the other great movement of\nthat age, the Reformation–Urbino, under its dukes of the house of\nMontefeltro, had wherewithal just then to make a boy of native\nartistic faculty from the first a willing learner.  The gloomy old\nfortress of the feudal masters of the town had been replaced, in\nthose later years of the Quattro-cento, by a consummate monument of\nQuattro-cento taste, a museum of ancient and modern art, the owners\nof which lived there, gallantly at home, amid the choicer flowers of\nliving humanity.  The ducal palace was, in fact, become nothing less\nthan a school of ambitious youth in all the accomplishments alike of\nwar and peace.  Raphael’s connexion with it seems to have become\nintimate, and from the first its influence must have overflowed so\nsmall a place.  In the case of the lucky Raphael, for once, the\nactual conditions of early life had been suitable, propitious,\naccordant to what one’s imagination would have required for the\nchildhood of the man.  He was born amid the art he was, not to\ntransform, but to perfect, by a thousand reverential retouchings.  In\nno palace, however, but [40] in a modest abode, still shown,\ncontaining the workshop of his father, Giovanni Santi.  But here,\ntoo, though in frugal form, art, the arts, were present.  A store of\nartistic objects was, or had recently been, made there, and now\nespecially, for fitting patrons, religious pictures in the old\nUmbrian manner.  In quiet nooks of the Apennines Giovanni’s works\nremain; and there is one of them, worth study, in spite of what\ncritics say of its crudity, in the National Gallery.  Concede its\nimmaturity, at least, though an immaturity visibly susceptible of a\ndelicate grace, it wins you nevertheless to return again and again,\nand ponder, by a sincere expression of sorrow, profound, yet\nresigned, be the cause what it may, among all the many causes of\nsorrow inherent in the ideal of maternity, human or divine.  But if\nyou keep in mind when looking at it the facts of Raphael’s childhood,\nyou will recognise in his father’s picture, not the anticipated\nsorrow of the “Mater Dolorosa” over the dead son, but the grief of a\nsimple household over the mother herself taken early from it.  That\nmay have been the first picture the eyes of the world’s great painter\nof Madonnas rested on; and if he stood diligently before it to copy,\nand so copying, quite unconsciously, and with no disloyalty to his\noriginal, refined, improved, substituted,–substituted himself, in\nfact, his finer self–he had already struck the persistent note of\nhis career.  As with his age, it is [41] his vocation, ardent worker\nas he is, to enjoy himself–to enjoy himself amiably, and to find his\nchief enjoyment in the attitude of a scholar.  And one by one, one\nafter another, his masters, the very greatest of them, go to school\nto him.",
        "It was so especially with the artist of whom Raphael first became\ncertainly a learner–Perugino.  Giovanni Santi had died in Raphael’s\nchildhood, too early to have been in any direct sense his teacher.\nThe lad, however, from one and another, had learned much, when, with\nhis share of the patrimony in hand, enough to keep him, but not to\ntempt him from scholarly ways, he came to Perugia, hoping still\nfurther to improve himself.  He was in his eighteenth year, and how\nhe looked just then you may see in a drawing of his own in the\nUniversity Galleries, of somewhat stronger mould than less genuine\nlikenesses may lead you to expect.  There is something of a fighter\nin the way in which the nose springs from the brow between the wide-\nset, meditative eyes.  A strenuous lad! capable of plodding, if you\ndare apply that word to labour so impassioned as his–to any labour\nwhatever done at Perugia, centre of the dreamiest Apennine scenery.\nIts various elements (one hardly knows whether one is thinking of\nItalian nature or of Raphael’s art in recounting them), the richly-\nplanted lowlands, the sensitive mountain lines in flight one beyond\nthe other into clear distance, the cool yet glowing atmosphere, [42]\nthe romantic morsels of architecture, which lend to the entire scene\nI know not what expression of reposeful antiquity, arrange themselves\nhere as for set purpose of pictorial effect, and have gone with\nlittle change into his painted backgrounds.  In the midst of it, on\ntitanic old Roman and Etruscan foundations, the later Gothic town had\npiled itself along the lines of a gigantic land of rock, stretched\nout from the last slope of the Apennines into the plain.  Between its\nfingers steep dark lanes wind down into the olive gardens; on the\nfinger-tips military and monastic builders had perched their towns.\nA place as fantastic in its attractiveness as the human life which\nthen surged up and down in it in contrast to the peaceful scene\naround.  The Baglioni who ruled there had brought certain tendencies\nof that age to a typical completeness of expression, veiling crime–\ncrime, it might seem, for its own sake, a whole octave of fantastic\ncrime–not merely under brilliant fashions and comely persons, but\nunder fashions and persons, an outward presentment of life and of\nthemselves, which had a kind of immaculate grace and discretion about\nthem, as if Raphael himself had already brought his unerring gift of\nselection to bear upon it all for motives of art.  With life in those\nstreets of Perugia, as with nature, with the work of his masters,\nwith the mere exercises of his fellow-students, his hand rearranges,\nrefines, renews, as if by simple contact; [43] but it is met here\nhalf-way in its renewing office by some special aptitude for such\ngrace in the subject itself.  Seemingly innocent, full of natural\ngaiety, eternally youthful, those seven and more deadly sins,\nembodied and attired in just the jaunty dress then worn, enter now\nand afterwards as spectators, or assistants, into many a sacred\nforeground and background among the friends and kinsmen of the Holy\nFamily, among the very angels, gazing, conversing, standing firmly\nand unashamed.  During his apprenticeship at Perugia Raphael visited\nand left his work in more modest places round about, along those\nseductive mountain or lowland roads, and copied for one of them\nPerugino’s “Marriage of the Virgin” significantly, did it by many\ndegrees better, with a very novel effect of motion everywhere, and\nwith that grace which natural motion evokes, introducing for a temple\nin the background a lovely bit of his friend Bramante’s sort of\narchitecture, the true Renaissance or perfected Quattro-cento\narchitecture.  He goes on building a whole lordly new city of the\nlike as he paints to the end of his life.  The subject, we may note,\nas we leave Perugia in Raphael’s company, had been suggested by the\nfamous mystic treasure of its cathedral church, the marriage ring of\nthe Blessed Virgin herself.",
        "Raphael’s copy had been made for the little old Apennine town of\nCitta di Castello; and another place he visits at this time is still\nmore [44] effective in the development of his genius.  About his\ntwentieth year he comes to Siena–that other rocky Titan’s hand, just\nlifted out of the surface of the plain.  It is the most grandiose\nplace he has yet seen; it has not forgotten that it was once the\nrival of Florence; and here the patient scholar passes under an\ninfluence of somewhat larger scope than Perugino’s.  Perugino’s\npictures are for the most part religious contemplations, painted and\nmade visible, to accompany the action of divine service–a visible\npattern to priests, attendants, worshippers, of what the course of\ntheir invisible thoughts should be at those holy functions.  Learning\nin the workshop of Perugino to produce the like–such works as the\nAnsidei Madonna–to produce them very much better than his master,\nRaphael was already become a freeman of the most strictly religious\nschool of Italian art, the so devout Umbrian soul finding there its\npurest expression, still untroubled by the naturalism, the\nintellectualism, the antique paganism, then astir in the artistic\nsoul everywhere else in Italy.  The lovely work of Perugino, very\nlovely at its best, of the early Raphael also, is in fact\n\"conservative,” and at various points slightly behind its day, though\nnot unpleasantly.  In Perugino’s allegoric frescoes of the Cambio,\nthe Hall of the Money-changers, for instance, under the mystic rule\nof the Planets in person, pagan personages take their place indeed\nside by side with the figures of the New [45] Testament, but are no\nRomans or Greeks, neither are the Jews Jews, nor is any one of them,\nwarrior, sage, king, precisely of Perugino’s own time and place, but\nstill contemplations only, after the manner of the personages in his\nchurch-work; or, say, dreams–monastic dreams–thin, do-nothing\ncreatures, conjured from sky and cloud.  Perugino clearly never broke\nthrough the meditative circle of the Middle Age.",
        "Now Raphael, on the other hand, in his final period at Rome, exhibits\na wonderful narrative power in painting; and the secret of that\npower–the power of developing a story in a picture, or series of\npictures–may be traced back from him to Pinturicchio, as that\npainter worked on those vast, well-lighted walls of the cathedral\nlibrary at Siena, at the great series of frescoes illustrative of the\nlife of Pope Pius the Second.  It had been a brilliant personal\nhistory, in contact now and again with certain remarkable public\nevents–a career religious yet mundane, you scarcely know which, so\nnatural is the blending of lights, of interest in it.  How unlike the\nPeruginesque conception of life in its almost perverse other-\nworldliness, which Raphael now leaves behind him, but, like a true\nscholar, will not forget.  Pinturicchio then had invited his\nremarkable young friend hither, “to assist him by his counsels,” who,\nhowever, pupil-wise, after his habit also learns much as he thus\nassists.  He stands depicted there in person in the scene [46] of the\ncanonisation of Saint Catherine; and though his actual share in the\nwork is not to be defined, connoisseurs have felt his intellectual\npresence, not at one place only, in touches at once finer and more\nforcible than were usual in the steady-going, somewhat Teutonic,\nPinturicchio, Raphael’s elder by thirty years.  The meek scholar you\nsee again, with his tentative sketches and suggestions, had more than\nlearned his lesson; through all its changes that flexible\nintelligence loses nothing; does but add continually to its store.\nHenceforward Raphael will be able to tell a story in a picture,\nbetter, with a truer economy, with surer judgment, more naturally and\neasily than any one else.",
        "And here at Siena, of all Italian towns perhaps most deeply impressed\nwith medieval character–an impress it still retains–grotesque,\nparti-coloured–parti-coloured, so to speak, in its genius–Satanic,\nyet devout of humour, as depicted in its old chronicles, and\nbeautiful withal, dignified; it is here that Raphael becomes for the\nfirst time aware of that old pagan world, which had already come to\nbe so much for the art-schools of Italy.  There were points, as we\nsaw, at which the school of Perugia was behind its day.  Amid those\nintensely Gothic surroundings in the cathedral library where\nPinturicchio worked, stood, as it remained till recently, unashamed\nthere, a marble group of the three Graces–an average Roman work in\n[47] effect–the sort of thing we are used to.  That, perhaps, is the\nonly reason why for our part, except with an effort, we find it\nconventional or even tame.  For the youthful Raphael, on the other\nhand, at that moment, antiquity, as with “the dew of herbs,” seemed\ntherein “to awake and sing” out of the dust, in all its sincerity,\nits cheerfulness and natural charm.  He has turned it into a picture;\nhas helped to make his original only too familiar, perhaps, placing\nthe three sisters against his own favourite, so unclassic, Umbrian\nbackground indeed, but with no trace of the Peruginesque ascetic,\nGothic meagreness in themselves; emphasising rather, with a hearty\nacceptance, the nude, the flesh; making the limbs, in fact, a little\nheavy.  It was but one gleam he had caught just there in medieval\nSiena of that large pagan world he was, not so long afterwards, more\ncompletely than others to make his own.  And when somewhat later\nhe painted the exquisite, still Peruginesque, Apollo and Marsyas,\nsemi-medieval habits again asserted themselves with delightfully\nblent effects.  It might almost pass for a parable–that little\npicture in the Louvre–of the contention between classic art and the\nromantic, superseded in the person of Marsyas, a homely, quaintly\npoetical young monk, surely!  Only, Apollo himself also is clearly of\nthe same brotherhood; has a touch, in truth, of Heine’s fancied\nApollo “in exile,” who, Christianity now triumphing, has served as\n[48] a hired shepherd, or hidden himself under the cowl in a\ncloister; and Raphael, as if at work on choir-book or missal, still\napplies symbolical gilding for natural sunlight.  It is as if he\nwished to proclaim amid newer lights–this scholar who never forgot a\nlesson–his loyal pupilage to Perugino, and retained still something\nof medieval stiffness, of the monastic thoughts also, that were born\nand lingered in places like Borgo San Sepolcro or Citta di Castello.\nChef-d’oeuvre! you might exclaim, of the peculiar, tremulous, half-\nconvinced, monkish treatment of that after all damnable pagan world.\nAnd our own generation certainly, with kindred tastes, loving or\nwishing to love pagan art as sincerely as did the people of the\nRenaissance, and medieval art as well, would accept, of course, of\nwork conceived in that so seductively mixed manner, ten per cent of\neven Raphael’s later, purely classical presentments.",
        "That picture was suggested by a fine old intaglio in the Medicean\ncollection at Florence, was painted, therefore, after Raphael’s\ncoming thither, and therefore also a survival with him of a style\nlimited, immature, literally provincial; for in the phase on which he\nhad now entered he is under the influence of style in its most fully\ndetermined sense, of what might be called the thorough-bass of the\npictorial art, of a fully realised intellectual system in regard to\nits processes, well tested by experiment, upon a survey [49] of all\nthe conditions and various applications of it–of style as understood\nby Da Vinci, then at work in Florence.  Raphael’s sojourn there\nextends from his twenty-first to his twenty-fifth year.  He came with\nflattering recommendations from the Court of Urbino; was admitted as\nan equal by the masters of his craft, being already in demand for\nwork, then and ever since duly prized; was, in fact, already famous,\nthough he alone is unaware–is in his own opinion still but a\nlearner, and as a learner yields himself meekly, systematically to\ninfluence; would learn from Francia, whom he visits at Bologna; from\nthe earlier naturalistic works of Masolino and Masaccio; from the\nsolemn prophetic work of the venerable dominican, Bartolommeo,\ndisciple of Savonarola.  And he has already habitually this strange\neffect, not only on the whole body of his juniors, but on those whose\nmanner had been long since formed; they lose something of themselves\nby contact with him, as if they went to school again.",
        "Bartolommeo, Da Vinci, were masters certainly of what we call “the\nideal” in art.  Yet for Raphael, so loyal hitherto to the traditions\nof Umbrian art, to its heavy weight of hieratic tradition, dealing\nstill somewhat conventionally with a limited, non-natural matter–for\nRaphael to come from Siena, Perugia, Urbino, to sharp-witted,\npractical, masterful Florence was in immediate effect a transition\nfrom reverie to [50] realities–to a world of facts.  Those masters\nof the ideal were for him, in the first instance, masters also of\nrealism, as we say.  Henceforth, to the end, he will be the analyst,\nthe faithful reporter, in his work, of what he sees.  He will realise\nthe function of style as exemplified in the practice of Da Vinci,\nface to face with the world of nature and man as they are; selecting\nfrom, asserting one’s self in a transcript of its veritable data;\nlike drawing to like there, in obedience to the master’s preference\nfor the embodiment of the creative form within him.  Portrait-art had\nbeen nowhere in the school of Perugino, but it was the triumph of the\nschool of Florence.  And here a faithful analyst of what he sees, yet\nlifting it withal, unconsciously, inevitably, recomposing,\nglorifying, Raphael too becomes, of course, a painter of portraits.\nWe may foresee them already in masterly series, from Maddalena Doni,\na kind of younger, more virginal sister of La Gioconda, to cardinals\nand popes–to that most sensitive of all portraits, the “Violin-\nplayer,” if it be really his.  But then, on the other hand, the\ninfluence of such portraiture will be felt also in his inventive\nwork, in a certain reality there, a certain convincing loyalty to\nexperience and observation.  In his most elevated religious work he\nwill still keep, for security at least, close to nature, and the\ntruth of nature.  His modelling of the visible surface is lovely\nbecause he understands, can see the hidden causes [51] of momentary\naction in the face, the hands–how men and animals are really made\nand kept alive.  Set side by side, then, with that portrait of\nMaddalena Doni, as forming together a measure of what he has learned\nat Florence, the “Madonna del Gran Duca,” which still remains there.\nCall it on revision, and without hesitation, the loveliest of his\nMadonnas, perhaps of all Madonnas; and let it stand as representative\nof as many as fifty or sixty types of that subject, onwards to the\nSixtine Madonna, in all the triumphancy of his later days at Rome.\nObserve the veritable atmosphere about it, the grand composition of\nthe drapery, the magic relief, the sweetness and dignity of the human\nhands and faces, the noble tenderness of Mary’s gesture, the unity of\nthe thing with itself, the faultless exclusion of all that does not\nbelong to its main purpose; it is like a single, simple axiomatic\nthought.  Note withal the novelty of its effect on the mind, and you\nwill see that this master of style (that’s a consummate example of\nwhat is meant by style) has been still a willing scholar in the hands\nof Da Vinci.  But then, with what ease also, and simplicity, and a\nsort of natural success not his!",
        "It was in his twenty-fifth year that Raphael came to the city of the\npopes, Michelangelo being already in high favour there.  For the\nremaining years of his life he paces the same streets with that grim\nartist, who was so great a [52] contrast with himself, and for the\nfirst time his attitude towards a gift different from his own is not\nthat of a scholar, but that of a rival.  If he did not become the\nscholar of Michelangelo, it would be difficult, on the other hand, to\ntrace anywhere in Michelangelo’s work the counter influence usual\nwith those who had influenced him.  It was as if he desired to add to\nthe strength of Michelangelo that sweetness which at first sight\nseems to be wanting there.  Ex forti dulcedo: and in the study of\nMichelangelo certainly it is enjoyable to detect, if we may, sweet\nsavours amid the wonderful strength, the strangeness and potency of\nwhat he pours forth for us: with Raphael, conversely, something of a\nrelief to find in the suavity of that so softly moving, tuneful\nexistence, an assertion of strength.  There was the promise of it, as\nyou remember, in his very look as he saw himself at eighteen; and you\nknow that the lesson, the prophecy of those holy women and children\nhe has made his own, is that “the meek shall possess.”  So, when we\nsee him at Rome at last, in that atmosphere of greatness, of the\nstrong, he too is found putting forth strength, adding that element\nin due proportion to the mere sweetness and charm of his genius; yet\na sort of strength, after all, still congruous with the line of\ndevelopment that genius has hitherto taken, the special strength of\nthe scholar and his proper reward, a purely cerebral strength [53]\nthe strength, the power of an immense understanding.",
        "Now the life of Raphael at Rome seems as we read of it hasty and\nperplexed, full of undertakings, of vast works not always to be\ncompleted, of almost impossible demands on his industry, in a world\nof breathless competition, amid a great company of spectators, for\ngreat rewards.  You seem to lose him, feel he may have lost himself,\nin the multiplicity of his engagements; might fancy that, wealthy,\nvariously decorated, a courtier, cardinal in petto, he was “serving\ntables.”  But, you know, he was forcing into this brief space of\nyears (he died at thirty-seven) more than the natural business of the\nlarger part of a long life; and one way of getting some kind of\nclearness into it, is to distinguish the various divergent outlooks\nor applications, and group the results of that immense intelligence,\nthat still untroubled, flawlessly operating, completely informed\nunderstanding, that purely cerebral power, acting through his\nexecutive, inventive or creative gifts, through the eye and the hand\nwith its command of visible colour and form.  In that way you may\nfollow him along many various roads till brain and eye and hand\nsuddenly fail in the very midst of his work–along many various\nroads, but you can follow him along each of them distinctly.",
        "At the end of one of them is the Galatea, and in quite a different\nform of industry, the datum [54] for the beginnings of a great\nliterary work of pure erudition.  Coming to the capital of\nChristendom, he comes also for the first time under the full\ninfluence of the antique world, pagan art, pagan life, and is\nhenceforth an enthusiastic archaeologist.  On his first coming to\nRome a papal bull had authorised him to inspect all ancient marbles,\ninscriptions, and the like, with a view to their adaptation in new\nbuildings then proposed.  A consequent close acquaintance with\nantiquity, with the very touch of it, blossomed literally in his\nbrain, and, under his facile hand, in artistic creations, of which\nthe Galatea is indeed the consummation.  But the frescoes of the\nFarnese palace, with a hundred minor designs, find their place along\nthat line of his artistic activity; they do not exhaust his knowledge\nof antiquity, his interest in and control of it.  The mere fragments\nof it that still cling to his memory would have composed, had he\nlived longer, a monumental illustrated survey of the monuments of\nancient Rome.",
        "To revive something of the proportionable spirit at least of antique\nbuilding in the architecture of the present, came naturally to\nRaphael as the son of his age; and at the end of another of those\nroads of diverse activity stands Saint Peter’s, though unfinished.\nWhat a proof again of that immense intelligence, by which, as I said,\nthe element of strength supplemented the element of mere sweetness\nand charm in his [55] work, that at the age of thirty, known hitherto\nonly as a painter, at the dying request of the venerable Bramante\nhimself, he should have been chosen to succeed him as the director of\nthat vast enterprise!  And if little in the great church, as we see\nit, is directly due to him, yet we must not forget that his work in\nthe Vatican also was partly that of an architect.  In the Loggie, or\nopen galleries of the Vatican, the last and most delicate effects of\nQuattro-cento taste come from his hand, in that peculiar arabesque\ndecoration which goes by his name.",
        "Saint Peter’s, as you know, had an indirect connexion with the\nTeutonic reformation.  When Leo X. pushed so far the sale of\nindulgences to the overthrow of Luther’s Catholicism, it was done\nafter all for the not entirely selfish purpose of providing funds to\nbuild the metropolitan church of Christendom with the assistance of\nRaphael; and yet, upon another of those diverse outways of his so\nversatile intelligence, at the close of which we behold his\nunfinished picture of the Transfiguration, what has been called\nRaphael’s Bible finds its place–that series of biblical scenes in\nthe Loggie of the Vatican.  And here, while he has shown that he\ncould do something of Michelangelo’s work a little more soothingly\nthan he, this graceful Roman Catholic rivals also what is perhaps\nbest in the work of the rude German reformer–of Luther, who came to\nRome about this very [56] time, to find nothing admirable there.\nPlace along with them the Cartoons, and observe that in this phase of\nhis artistic labour, as Luther printed his vernacular German version\nof the Scriptures, so Raphael is popularising them for an even larger\nworld; he brings the simple, to their great delight, face to face\nwith the Bible as it is, in all its variety of incident, after they\nhad so long had to content themselves with but fragments of it, as\npresented in the symbolism and in the brief lections of the Liturgy:-\n-Biblia Pauperum, in a hundred forms of reproduction, though designed\nfor popes and princes.",
        "But then, for the wise, at the end of yet another of those divergent\nways, glows his painted philosophy in the Parnassus and the School of\nAthens, with their numerous accessories.  In the execution of those\nworks, of course, his antiquarian knowledge stood him in good stead;\nand here, above all, is the pledge of his immense understanding, at\nwork on its own natural ground on a purely intellectual deposit, the\napprehension, the transmission to others of complex and difficult\nideas.  We have here, in fact, the sort of intelligence to be found\nin Lessing, in Herder, in Hegel, in those who, by the instrumentality\nof an organised philosophic system, have comprehended in one view or\nvision what poetry has been, or what Greek philosophy, as great\ncomplex dynamic facts in the world.  But then, with the artist of the\nsixteenth century, [57] this synoptic intellectual power worked in\nperfect identity with the pictorial imagination and a magic hand.  By\nhim large theoretic conceptions are addressed, so to speak, to the\nintelligence of the eye.  There had been efforts at such abstract or\ntheoretic painting before, or say rather, leagues behind him.  Modern\nefforts, again, we know, and not in Germany alone, to do the like for\nthat larger survey of such matters which belongs to the philosophy of\nour own century; but for one or many reasons they have seemed only to\nprove the incapacity of philosophy to be expressed in terms of art.\nThey have seemed, in short, so far, not fit to be seen literally–\nthose ideas of culture, religion, and the like.  Yet Plato, as you\nknow, supposed a kind of visible loveliness about ideas.  Well! in\nRaphael, painted ideas, painted and visible philosophy, are for once\nas beautiful as Plato thought they must be, if one truly apprehended\nthem.  For note, above all, that with all his wealth of antiquarian\nknowledge in detail, and with a perfect technique, it is after all\nthe beauty, the grace of poetry, of pagan philosophy, of religious\nfaith that he thus records.",
        "Of religious faith also.  The Disputa, in which, under the form of a\ncouncil representative of all ages, he embodies the idea of theology,\ndivinarum rerum notitia, as constantly resident in the Catholic\nChurch, ranks with the “Parnassus” and the “School of Athens,” if it\ndoes not rather [58] close another of his long lines of intellectual\ntravail–a series of compositions, partly symbolic, partly\nhistorical, in which the “Deliverance of St. Peter from Prison,” the\n\"Expulsion of the Huns,” and the “Coronation of Charlemagne,” find\ntheir places; and by which, painting in the great official chambers\nof the Vatican, Raphael asserts, interprets the power and charm of\nthe Catholic ideal as realised in history.  A scholar, a student of\nthe visible world, of the natural man, yet even more ardently of the\nbooks, the art, the life of the old pagan world, the age of the\nRenaissance, through all its varied activity, had, in spite of the\nweakened hold of Catholicism on the critical intellect, been still\nunder its influence, the glow of it, as a religious ideal, and in the\npresence of Raphael you cannot think it a mere after-glow.\nIndependently, that is, of less or more evidence for it, the whole\ncreed of the Middle Age, as a scheme of the world as it should be, as\nwe should be glad to find it, was still welcome to the heart, the\nimagination.  Now, in Raphael, all the various conditions of that age\ndiscover themselves as characteristics of a vivid personal genius,\nwhich may be said therefore to be conterminous with the genius of the\nRenaissance itself.  For him, then, in the breadth of his immense\ncosmopolitan intelligence, for Raphael, who had done in part the work\nof Luther also, the Catholic Church–through all its phases, as\nreflected in its visible local centre, [59] the papacy–is alive\nstill as of old, one and continuous, and still true to itself.  Ah!\nwhat is local and visible, as you know, counts for so much with the\nartistic temper!",
        "Old friends, or old foes with but new faces, events repeating\nthemselves, as his large, clear, synoptic vision can detect, the\ninvading King of France, Louis XII., appears as Attila: Leo X. as Leo\nI.: and he thinks of, he sees, at one and the same moment, the\ncoronation of Charlemagne and the interview of Pope Leo with Francis\nI., as a dutiful son of the Church: of the deliverance of Leo X. from\nprison, and the deliverance of St. Peter.",
        "I have abstained from anything like description of Raphael’s pictures\nin speaking of him and his work, have aimed rather at preparing you\nto look at his work for yourselves, by a sketch of his life, and\ntherein especially, as most appropriate to this place, of Raphael as\na scholar.  And now if, in closing, I commend one of his pictures in\nparticular to your imagination or memory,, your purpose to see it, or\nsee it again, it will not be the Transfiguration nor the Sixtine\nMadonna, nor even the “Madonna del Gran Duca,” but the picture we\nhave in London–the Ansidei, or Blenheim, Madonna.  I find there, at\nfirst sight, with something of the pleasure one has in a proposition\nof Euclid, a sense of the power of the understanding, in the economy\nwith which he has reduced his material to the [60] simplest terms,\nhas disentangled and detached its various elements.  He is painting\nin Florence, but for Perugia, and sends it a specimen of its own old\nart–Mary and the babe enthroned, with St. Nicolas and the Baptist in\nattendance on either side.  The kind of thing people there had\nalready seen so many times, but done better, in a sense not to be\nmeasured by degrees, with a wholly original freedom and life and\ngrace, though he perhaps is unaware, done better as a whole, because\nbetter in every minute particular, than ever before.  The scrupulous\nscholar, aged twenty-three, is now indeed a master; but still goes\ncarefully.  Note, therefore, how much mere exclusion counts for in\nthe positive effect of his work.  There is a saying that the true\nartist is known best by what he omits.  Yes, because the whole\nquestion of good taste is involved precisely in such jealous\nomission.  Note this, for instance, in the familiar Apennine\nbackground, with its blue hills and brown towns, faultless, for once-\n-for once only–and observe, in the Umbrian pictures around, how\noften such background is marred by grotesque, natural, or\narchitectural detail, by incongruous or childish incident.  In this\ncool, pearl-grey, quiet place, where colour tells for double–the\njewelled cope, the painted book in the hand of Mary, the chaplet of\nred coral–one is reminded that among all classical writers Raphael’s\npreference was for the faultless Virgil.  How orderly, how divinely\n[61] clean and sweet the flesh, the vesture, the floor, the earth and\nsky!  Ah, say rather the hand, the method of the painter!  There is\nan unmistakeable pledge of strength, of movement and animation in the\ncast of the Baptist’s countenance, but reserved, repressed.  Strange,\nRaphael has given him a staff of transparent crystal.  Keep then to\nthat picture as the embodied formula of Raphael’s genius.  Amid all\nhe has here already achieved, full, we may think, of the quiet\nassurance of what is to come, his attitude is still that of the\nscholar; he seems still to be saying, before all things, from first\nto last, “I am utterly purposed that I will not offend.”",
        "38. *A lecture delivered to the University Extension Students,\nOxford, 2 August, 1892.  Published in the Fortnightly Review, Oct.\n1892, and now reprinted by the kind permission of the proprietors.",
        "[62] ABOUT the middle of the seventeenth century, two opposite views\nof a question, upon which neither Scripture, nor Council, nor Pope,\nhad spoken with authority–the question as to the amount of freedom\nleft to man by the overpowering work of divine grace upon him–had\nseemed likely for a moment to divide the Roman Church into two rival\nsects.  In the diocese of Paris, however, the controversy narrowed\nitself into a mere personal quarrel between the Jesuit Fathers and\nthe religious community of Port-Royal, and might have been forgotten\nbut for the intervention of a new writer in whom French literature\nmade more than a new step.  It became at once, as if by a new\ncreation, what it has remained–a pattern of absolutely unencumbered\nexpressiveness.",
        "In 1656 Pascal, then thirty-three years old, under the form of\n\"Letters to a Provincial by one of his Friends,” put forth a series\nof [63] pamphlets in which all that was vulnerable in the Jesuit\nFathers was laid bare to the profit of their opponents.  At the\nmoment the quarrel turned on the proposed censure of Antoine Arnauld\nby the Sorbonne, by the University of Paris as a religious body.\nPascal, intimate, like many another fine intellect of the day, with\nthe Port-Royalists, was Arnauld’s friend, and it belonged to the\nardour of his genius, at least as he was then, to be a very active\nfriend.  He took up the pen as other chivalrous gentlemen of the day\ntook up the sword, and showed himself a master of the art of fence\ntherewith.  His delicate exercise of himself with that weapon was\nnothing less than a revelation to all the world of the capabilities,\nthe true genius of the French language in prose.",
        "Those who think of Pascal in his final sanctity, his detachment of\nsoul from all but the greatest matters, may be surprised, when they\nturn to the “Letters,” to find him treating questions, as serious for\nthe friends he was defending as for their adversaries, ironically,\nwith a but half-veiled disdain for them, or an affected humility at\nbeing unskilled in them and no theologian.  He does not allow us to\nforget that he is, after all, a layman; while he introduces us,\nalmost avowedly, into a world of unmeaning terms, and unreal\ndistinctions and suppositions that can never be verified.  The world\nin general, indeed, se paye des paroles.  That saying belongs to\nPascal, and [64] he uses it with reference to the Jesuits and their\nfavourite expression of “sufficient grace.”  In the earliest\n\"Letters” he creates in us a feeling that, however orthodox one’s\nintention, it is scarcely possible to speak of the matters then so\nabundantly discussed by religious people without heresy at some\nunguarded point.  The suspected proposition of Arnauld, it is\nadmitted by one of his foes, “would be Catholic in the mouth of any\none but M. Arnauld.”  “The truth,” as it lay between Arnauld and his\nopponents, is a thing so delicate that “pour peu qu’on s’en retire,\non tombe dans l’erreur; mais cette erreur est si deliee, que, pour\npeu qu’on s’en eloigne, on se trouve dans la verite.”",
        "Some, indeed, may find in the very delicacy, the curiosity, with\nwhich such distinctions are drawn, by Pascal’s friends as well as by\ntheir foes, only the impertinence, the profanities, of the theologian\nby profession, all too intimate in laying down the law of the things\nhe deals with–the things “which eye hath not seen” pressing into the\nsecrets of God’s sublime commerce with men, in which, it may be, He\ndiffers with every single human soul, by forms of thought adapted\nfrom the poorest sort of men’s dealings with each other, from the\ntrader, or the attorney.  Pascal notes too the “impious buffooneries\"\nof his opponents.  The good Fathers, perhaps, only meant them to\npromote geniality of temper in the debate.  But of such failures–\nfailures of taste, of respect towards one’s [65] own point of view–\nthe world is ever unamiably aware; and in the “Letters” there is much\nto move the self-complacent smile of the worldling, as Pascal\ndescribes his experiences, while he went from one authority to\nanother to find out what was really meant by the distinction between\ngrace “sufficient,” grace “efficacious,” grace “active,” grace\n\"victorious.”  He heard, for instance, that all men have sufficient\ngrace to do God’s will; but it is not always prochain, not always at\nhand, at the moment of temptation to do otherwise.  So far, then,\nPascal’s charges are those which may seem to lie ready to hand\nagainst all who study theology, a looseness of thought and language,\nthat would pass nowhere else, in making what are professedly very\nfine distinctions; the insincerity with which terms are carefully\nchosen to cover opposite meanings; the fatuity with which opposite\nmeanings revolve into one another, in the strange vacuous atmosphere\ngenerated by professional divines.",
        "Up to this point, you see, Pascal is the countryman of Rabelais and\nMontaigne, smiling with the fine malice of the one, laughing outright\nwith the gaiety of the other, all the world joining in the laugh–\nwell, at the silliness of the clergy, who seem indeed not to know\ntheir own business.  It is we, the laity, he would urge, who are\nserious, and disinterested, because sincerely interested, in these\ngreat questionings.  Jalousie de metier, the reader may suspect, has\nsomething to do with [66] the Professional leaders on both sides of\nthe controversy; but at the actual turn controversy took just then,\nit was against the Jesuit Fathers that Pascal’s charges came home in\nfull force.  And their sin is above all that sin, unpardonable with\nmen of the world sans peur et sans reproche, of a lack of self-\nrespect, sins against pride, if the paradox may be allowed, all the\nundignified faults, in a word, of essentially little people when they\ninterfere in great matters–faults promoted in the direction of the\nconsciences of women and children, weak concessions to weak people\nwho want to be saved in some easy way quite other than Pascal’s high,\nfine, chivalrous way of gaining salvation, an incapacity to say what\none thinks with the glove thrown down.  He supposes a Jansenist to\nturn upon his opponent who uses the term “sufficient” grace, while\nreally meaning, as he alleges, insufficient, with the words:–\"Your\nexplanation would be odious to men of the world.  They speak more\nsincerely than you on matters of far less importance than this.\"\nWith the world, Pascal, in the “Provincial Letters,” had immediate\nsuccess.  “All the world,” we read in his friend’s supposed reply to\nthe second “Letter,” “sees them; all the world understands them.  Men\nof the world find them agreeable, and even women intelligible.”  A\ncentury later Voltaire found them very agreeable.  The spirit in\nwhich Pascal deals with his opponents, his irony, may remind us of\nthe “Apology” of [67] Socrates; the style which secured them\nimmediate access to people who, as a rule, find the subjects there\ntreated hopelessly dry, reminds us of the “Apologia” of Newman.",
        "The essence of all good style, whatever its accidents may be, is\nexpressiveness.  It is mastered in proportion to the justice, the\nnicety with which words balance or match their meaning, and their\nwriter succeeds in saying what he wills, grave or gay, severe or\nflorid, simple or complex.  Pascal was a master of style because, as\nhis sister tells us, recording his earliest years, he had a wonderful\nnatural facility a dire ce qu’il voulait en la maniere qu’il voulait.",
        "Facit indignatio versus.  The indignation which caused Pascal to\nwrite the “Letters” was of a supercilious kind, and what he willed to\nsay in them led to the development of all those qualities that are\nsummed up in the French term l’esprit.  Voltaire declared that the\nbest comedies of Moliere n’ont pas plus de sel que les premieres\nlettres.  “Vos maximes,” Pascal assures the Jesuit Fathers, “ont je\nne sais quoi de divertissant, qui rejouit toujours le monde,” and\nthey lose nothing of that character in his handling of them, so much\nso that it was clear from the first that the world in general would\nnever ask whether Pascal had been quite fair to his opponents:\n\"N’etes-vous donc pas ridicules, mes Peres?  Qu’on satisfait au\nprecepte d’ouir la messe en entendant quatre quarts de messe a la\nfois de differents pretres!”  When [68] you have the like of that it\nis impossible not to laugh, parce que rien n’y porte davantage qu’une\ndisproportion surprenante entre ce qu’on attend et ce qu’on voit.",
        "He has “salt” also, of another kind.  He drives straight at the\nJesuits, for instance, rather than at those who do but copy them,\nbecause, as he tells us: Les choses valent toujours mieux dans leur\nsource.  What equity of expression, how brief, how untranslateable!\nAnd the “Letters” abound in such things.",
        "But to his comparison of Pascal with Moliere, Voltaire added that\nBossuet n’a rien de plus sublime que les dernieres.  And in truth the\nmore serious note of the impassioned servant of religion whose lips\nhave been touched with altar-fire, whose seriousness came to be like\nsome incurable malady, a visitation of God, as people used to say, is\npresently struck when, in the natural course of his argument, his\nthoughts are carried, from a mere passage of arms between one man or\none class of men and another, deep down to those awful encounters of\nthe individual soul with itself which are formulated in the eternal\nproblem of predestination.",
        "In their doctrine of “sufficient grace” the Jesuits had presented a\nview of the conflict of good and evil in the soul, which is\nhonourable to God and encouraging to man, and which has catholicity\non its face.  All to whom entrance into the Church, through its\nformal ministries, [69] lies open are truly called of God, while\nbeyond it stretches the ocean of “His uncovenanted mercies.”  That is\na doctrine for the many, for those whose position in the religious\nlife is mediocrity, who so far as themselves or others can discern\nhave nothing about them of eternal or necessary or irresistible\nreprobation, or of the eternal condition opposite to that.",
        "The so-called Jansenist doctrine, on the other hand, of [   ]+ but\nirresistible grace was the appropriate view of the Port-Royalists,\nhigh-pitched, eager souls as they were, and of their friend Pascal\nhimself, however much in his turn he might refine upon it.  Whether\nor not, as a matter of fact, upon which, as distinct from matters of\nfaith, an infallible pope can be mistaken, the dreary old Dutch\nbishop Jansenius had really taught Jansenism, the Port-Royalists had\nfound in his “Augustinus” an incentive to devotion, and were avowedly\nhis adherents.  In that somewhat gloomy, that too deeply impressed,\nthat fanatical age, they were the Calvinists of the Roman Catholic\nChurch, maintaining, emphasising in it a view, a tradition, really\nconstant in it from St. Augustin, from St. Paul himself.  It is a\nmerit of Pascal, his literary merit, to have given a very fine-toned\nexpression to that doctrine, though mainly in the way of a criticism\nof its opponents, to one side or aspect of an eternal controversy,\neternally suspended, as representing two opposite aspects of\nexperience [70] itself.  Calvin and Arminius, Jansen and Molina sum\nup, in fact, respectively, like the respective adherents of the\nfreedom or of the necessity of the human will, in the more general\nquestion of moral philosophy, two opposed, two counter trains of\nphenomena actually observable by us in human action, too large and\ncomplex a matter, as it is, to be embodied or summed up in any one\nsingle proposition or idea.",
        "There are moments of one’s own life, aspects of the life of others,\nof which the conclusion that the will is free seems to be the only–\nis the natural or reasonable–account.  Yet those very moments on\nreflexion, on second thoughts, present themselves again, as but links\nin a chain, in an all-embracing network of chains.  In all education\nwe assume, in some inexplicable combination, at once the freedom and\nthe necessity of the subject of it.  And who on a survey of life from\noutside would willingly lose the dramatic contrasts, the alternating\ninterests, for which the opposed ideas of freedom and necessity are\nour respective points of view?  How significant become the details we\nmight otherwise pass by almost unobserved, but to which we are put on\nthe alert by the abstract query whether a man be indeed a freeman or\na slave, as we watch from aside his devious course, his struggles,\nhis final tragedy or triumph.  So much value at least there may be in\nproblems insoluble in themselves, such as that great controversy of\nPascal’s day [71] between Jesuit and Jansenist.  And here again who\nwould forego, in the spectacle of the religious history of the human\nsoul, the aspects, the details which the doctrines of universal and\nparticular grace respectively embody?  The Jesuit doctrine of\nsufficient grace is certainly, to use the familiar expression, a very\npleasant doctrine conducive to the due feeding of the whole flock of\nChrist, as being, as assuming them to be, what they really are, at\nthe worst, God’s silly sheep.  It has something in it congruous with\nthe rising of the physical sun on the evil and on the good, while the\nwheat and the tares grow naturally, peacefully together.  But how\npleasant also the opposite doctrine, how true, how truly descriptive\nof certain distinguished, magnifical, or elect souls, vessels of\nelection, epris des hauteurs, as we see them pass across the world’s\nstage, as if led on by a kind of thirst for God!  Its necessary\ncounterpart, of course, we may find, at least dramatically true of\nsome; we can name them in history, perhaps from our own experience;\nsouls of whom it seems but an obvious story to tell that they seemed\nto be in love with eternal death, to have borne on them from the\nfirst signs of reprobation.  Of certain quite visibly elect souls, at\nall events, the theory of irresistible grace might seem the almost\nnecessary explanation.  Most reasonable, most natural, most truly is\nit descriptive of Pascal himself.",
        "[72] So far, indeed, up to the year 1656, Pascal’s annus mirabilis,\nthe year of the “Letters,” the world had been allowed to see only one\nside of him.  Early in life he had achieved brilliant overtures in\nthe abstract sciences, and, inheriting much of the quality of a fine\ngentleman, he figures, with his trenchant manner, never at a loss, as\na quite secular person, stirred on occasion to take part in a\nreligious debate.  But it is after the grand fashion of the mundane\nquarrels of that day, the age of the sentiment of personal honour, in\nwhich it was so natural for the good-natured Jesuits, stirring all\nPascal’s satiric power, to excuse as well as they could the act de\ntuer pour un simple medisance.  The Church was still an estate of the\nrealm with all the obligations of the noblesse, and it was still\nsomething worse than bad taste, it was dangerous to express religious\ndoubts.  About the Catholic religion, as he conceived it, Pascal\ndisplays the assured attitude of an ancient Crusader.  He has the\nfull courage of his opinions, and by his elegant easy gallantry in\nspeaking for it he gives to religion then and now a kind of dignity\nit had lost with other controversialists in the eyes of the world.\nThere is abundant gaiety also in the “Letters.”  He quotes from\nTertullian to the effect that c’est proprement a la verite qu’il\nappartient de rire parce qu’elle est gaie, et de se jouer de ses\nennemis parce qu’elle est assuree de sa victoire.  For he could find\nquotations to his purpose from recondite writers, [73] though he was\nnot a man of erudition; like a man of the world again, he read\nlittle, but that absorbingly, was the master of two authors,\nEpictetus and Montaigne, and, as appeared afterwards, of the\nScriptures in the Vulgate.",
        "So far, his imposing carriage of himself intellectually might lead us\nto suspect that the forced humilities of his later years are\nindirectly a discovery of what seems one leading quality of the\nnatural man in him, a pride that could be quite fierce on occasion.\nAnd, like another rich young man whom Jesus loved, he lacked nothing\nto make the world also love and confide in, as it already flattered,\nhim.  He turned from it, decided to live a single life.  Was it the\nmere oddity of genius?  Or its last fine dainty touch of difference\nfrom ordinary people and their motives?  Or that sanctity of which,\nin some cases, the world itself instinctively feels the distinction,\nthough it shrinks from the true explanation of it?  Certainly, all\nthings considered, on the morrow of the “Letters,” Blaise Pascal, at\nthe age of thirty-three, had a brilliant worldly future before him,\nhad he cared duly to wait upon, to serve it.  To develop the already\nconsiderable position of his family among the gentry of Auvergne\nwould have been to follow the way of his time, in which so many noble\nnames had been founded on professional talents.  Increasingly,\nhowever, from early youth, he had been the subject of a malady so\nhopeless [74] and inexplicable that in that superstitious age some\nfancied it the result of a malign spell in infancy.  Gradually, the\nworld almost loses sight of him, hears at last, some time after it\nhad looked for that event, that he had died, of course very piously,\namong those sombre people, his friends and relations of Port-Royal,\nwith whom he had taken refuge, and seemed already to have been buried\nalive.  And in the year 1670, not till eight years after his death,\nthe “Pensees” appeared–\"Pensees de M. Pascal sur la Religion et sur\nquelques autres sujets\"–or rather a selection from those “Thoughts\"\nby the Port-Royalists, still in fear of consequences to the\nstruggling Jansenist party, anxious to present Pascal’s doctrine as\nfar as possible in conformity with the Jesuit sense, as also to\ndivert the vaguer parts of it more entirely into their own.  The\nincomparable words were altered, the order changed or lost, the\nthoughts themselves omitted or retrenched.  Written in short\nintervals of relief from suffering, they were contributions to a\nlarge and methodical work–\"Pensees de M. Pascal sur la Religion et\nsur quelques autres sujets\"–on a good many things besides, as the\nreader finds, on many of the great things of this world which seemed\nto him to come in contact or competition with religion.  In the true\nversion of the “Thoughts,” edited at last by Faugere, in 1844, from\nPascal’s own MSS., in the National Library, they group themselves\ninto certain definite trains [75] of speculation and study.  But it\nis still, nevertheless, as isolated thoughts, as inspirations, so to\ncall them, penetrating what seemed hopelessly dark, summarising what\nseemed hopelessly confused, sticking fast in men’s memories, floating\nlightly, or going far, that they have left so deep a mark in\nliterature.  For again the manner, also, their style precisely\nbecomes them.  The merits of Pascal’s style, indeed, as of the French\nlanguage itself, still is to say beaucoup de choses en peu de mots;\nand the brevity, the discerning edge, the impassioned concentration\nof the language are here one with the ardent immediate apprehensions\nof his spirit.",
        "One of the literary merits of the “Provincial Letters” is that they\nare really like letters; they are essentially a conversation by\nwriting with other persons.  What we have in the “Thoughts” is the\nconversation of the writer with himself, with himself and with God,\nor rather concerning Him, for He is, in Pascal’s favourite phrase\nfrom the Vulgate, Deus absconditus, He who never directly shows\nHimself.  Choses de coeur the “Thoughts” are, indeed those of an\nindividual, though they seem to have determined the very outlines of\na great subject for all other persons.  In Pascal, at the summit of\nthe Puy de Dome in his native Auvergne, experimenting on the weight\nof the invisible air, proving it to be ever all around by its\neffects, we are presented with one of the more pleasing [76] aspects\nof his earlier, more wholesome, open-air life.  In the great work of\nwhich the “Thoughts” are the first head, Pascal conceived himself to\nbe doing something of the same kind in the spiritual order by a\ndemonstration of this other invisible world all around us, with its\nreally ponderable forces, its movement, its attractions and\nrepulsions, the world of grace, unseen, but, as he thinks, the one\nonly hypothesis that can explain the experienced, admitted facts.\nWhether or not he was fixing permanently in the “Pensees” the\noutlines, the principles, of a great system of assent, of conviction,\nfor acceptance by the intellect, he was certainly fixing these with\nall the imaginative depth and sufficiency of Shakespeare himself, the\nfancied opposites, the attitudes, the necessary forms of pathos,+ of a\ngreat tragedy in the heart, the soul, the essential human tragedy, as\ntypical and central in its expression here, as Hamlet–what the  soul\npasses, and must pass, through, aux abois with nothingness, or with\nthose offended mysterious powers that may really occupy it–or when\nconfronted with the thought of what are called the “four last things\"\nit yields this way or that.  What might have passed with all its\nfiery ways for an esprit de secte et de cabale is now revealed amid\nthe disputes not of a single generation but of eternal ones, by the\nlight of a phenomenal storm of blinding and blasting inspirations.",
        "[77] Observe, he is not a sceptic converted, a returned infidel, but\nis seen there as if at the very centre of a perpetually maintained\ntragic crisis holding the faith steadfastly, but amid the well-poised\npoints of essential doubt all around him and it.  It is no mere calm\nsupersession of a state of doubt by a state of faith; the doubts\nnever die, they are only just kept down in a perpetual agonia.\nEverywhere in the “Letters” he had seemed so great a master–a master\nof himself–never at a loss, taking the conflict so lightly, with so\nlight a heart: in the great Atlantean travail of the “Thoughts” his\nfeet sometimes “are almost gone.”  In his soul’s agony, theological\nabstractions seem to become personal powers.  It was as if just below\nthe surface of the green undulations, the stately woods, of his own\nstrange country of Auvergne, the volcanic fires had suddenly\ndiscovered themselves anew.  In truth into his typical diagnosis, as\nit may seem, of the tragedy of the human soul, there have passed not\nmerely the personal feelings, the temperament of an individual, but\nhis malady also, a physical malady.  Great genius, we know, has the\npower of elevating, transmuting, serving itself by the accidental\nconditions about it, however unpromising–poverty, and the like.  It\nwas certainly so with Pascal’s long-continued physical sufferings.\nThat aigreur, which is part of the native colour of Pascal’s genius,\nis reinforced in the [78] “Pensees” by insupportable languor,\nalternating with supportable pain, as he died little by little\nthrough the eight years of their composition.  They are essentially\nthe utterance of a soul malade–a soul of great genius, whose malady\nbecame a new quality of that genius, perfecting it thus, by its very\ndefect, as a type on the intellectual stage, and thereby guiding,\nreassuring sympathetically, manning by a sense of good company that\nlarge class of persons who are malade in the same way.  “La maladie\nest l’etat naturel des Chretiens,” says Pascal himself.  And we\nconcede that every one of us more or less is ailing thus, as another\nhas told us that life itself is a disease of the spirit.",
        "From Port-Royal also came, about the year 1670, a painful book, the\n\"Life of Pascal,” a portrait painted slowly from the life or living\ndeath, but with an almost exclusive preference for traits expressive\nof disease.  The post-mortem examination of Pascal’s brain revealed,\nwe are now told, the secret, not merely of that long prostration,\nthose sudden passing torments, but of something analogous to them in\nPascal’s genius and work.  Well! the light cast indirectly on the\nliterary work of Pascal by Mme. Perier’s “Life” is of a similar kind.\nIt is a veritable chapter in morbid pathology, though it may have\ntruly a beauty for experts, the beauty which belongs to all refined\ncases even of cerebral disturbance.  That he should [79] have sought\nrelief from his singular wretchedness, in that sombre company, is\nlike the second stroke of tragedy upon him.  At moments Pascal\nbecomes almost a sectarian, and seems to pass out of the genial broad\nheaven of the Catholic Church.  He had lent himself in those last\nyears to a kind of pieties which do not make a winning picture, which\nalways have about them, even when they show themselves in men\nphysically strong, something of the small compass of the sick-\nchamber.  His medieval or oriental self-tortures, all the painful\nefforts at absolute detachment, a perverse asceticism taking all\nthere still was to spare from the denuded and suffering body, might\nwell, you may think, have died with him, but are here recorded,\nchiefly by way of showing the world, the Jesuits, that the\nJansenists, too, had a saint quite after their mind.",
        "But though, at first sight, you may find a pettiness in those minute\npieties, they have their signification as a testimony to the\nwholeness of Pascal’s assent, the entirety of his submission, his\nimmense sincerity, the heroic grandeur of his achieved faith.  The\nseventeenth century presents survivals of the gloomy mental habits of\nthe Middle Age, but for the most part of a somewhat theatrical kind,\nimitations of Francis and Dominic or of their earlier imitators.  In\nPascal they are original, and have all their seriousness.  Que je\nn’en sois [80] jamais separe–pas separe eternellement, he repeats,\nor makes that strange sort of MS. amulet, of which his sister tells\nus, repeat for him.  Cast me not away from Thy presence; and take not\nThy Holy Spirit from me.  It is table rase he is trying to make of\nhimself, that He might reign there absolutely alone, who, however, as\nhe was bound to think, had made and blest all those things he\ndeclined to accept.  Deeper and deeper, then, he retreated into the\nrenuncient life.  He could not, had he wished, deprive himself of\nthat his greatest gift–literally a gift he might have thought it not\nto be buried but accounted for–the gift of le beau dire, of writing\nbeautifully.  “Il avoit renonce depuis longtemps aux sciences\npurement humains.”  To him who had known them so well, and as if by\nintuition, those abstract and perdurable forms of service might well\nhave seemed a part of “the Lord’s doing, marvellous in our eyes,” as\nhis favourite Psalm cxix., the psalm des petites heures, the cxviii.\nof the Vulgate, says.*  These, too, he counts now as but a variety of\nle neant and vanity of things.  He no longer records, therefore, the\nmathematical apercus that may visit him; and in his scruples, his\nsuspicions of’ visible beauty, he interests us as precisely an\ninversion of what is called the aesthetic life.",
        "[81] Yet his faith, as in the days of the Middle Age, had been\nsupported, rewarded, by what he believed to be visible miracle among\nthe strange lights and shades of that retired place.  Pascal’s niece,\nthe daughter of Madame Perier, a girl ten years of age, suffered from\na disease of the eyes pronounced to be incurable.  The disease was a\npeculiarly distressing one, the sort of affliction which, falling on\na young child, may lead one to question the presence of divine\njustice in the world, makes one long that miracles were possible.\nWell!  Pascal, for one, believed that on occasion that profound\naspiration had been followed up by the power desired.  A thorn from\nthe crown of Jesus, as was believed, had been lately brought to the\nPort-Royal du Faubourg S. Jacques in Paris, and was one day applied\ndevoutly to the eye of the suffering child.  What followed was an\nimmediate and complete cure, fully attested by experts.  Ah!  Thou\nhast given him his heart’s desire: and hast not denied him the\nrequest of his lips.  Pascal, and the young girl herself, faithfully\nto the end of a long life, believed the circumstances to have been\nmiraculous.  Otherwise, we do not see that Pascal was ever permitted\nto enjoy (so to speak) the religion for which he had exchanged so\nmuch; that the sense of acceptance, of assurance, had come to him;\nthat for him the Spouse had ever penetrated the veil of the ordinary\nroutine of the means of grace; [82] nothing that corresponded as a\nmatter of clear personal intercourse of the very senses to the\ngreatness of his surrender–who had emptied himself of all other\nthings.  Besides, there was some not wholly-explained delay in his\nreception, in those his last days, of the Sacrament.  It was brought\nto him just in time–\"Voici celui que vous avez tant desire!\"–the\nministrant says to the dying man.  Pascal was then aged thirty-nine–\nan age you may remember fancifully noted as fatal to genius.",
        "Pascal’s “Thoughts,” then, we shall not rightly measure but as the\noutcome, the utterance, of a soul diseased, a soul permanently ill at\nease.  We find in their constant tension something of insomnia, of\nthat sleeplessness which can never be a quite healthful condition of\nmind in a human body.  Sometimes they are cries, cries of obscure\npain rather than thoughts–those great fine sayings which seem to\nbetray by their depth of sound the vast unseen hollow places of\nnature, of humanity, just beneath one’s feet or at one’s side.\nReading them, so modern still are those thoughts, so rich and various\nin suggestion, that one seems to witness the mental seed-sowing of\nthe next two centuries, and perhaps more, as to those matters with\nwhich he concerns himself.  Intuitions of a religious genius, they\nmay well be taken also as the final considerations of the natural\nman, as a religious inquirer on doubt and faith, and their place in\n[83] things.  Listen now to some of these “Thoughts” taken at random:\ntaken at first for their brevity.  Peu de chose nous console, parce\nque peu de chose nous afflige.  Par l’espace l’univers me comprend et\nm’engloutit comme un point: par la pensee je le comprends.  Things\nlike these put us en route with Pascal.  Toutes les bonnes maximes\nsont dans le monde: on ne manque que de les appliquer.  The great\nascetic was always hard on amusements, on mere pastimes: Le\ndivertissement nous amuse, one and all of us, et nous fait arriver\ninsensiblement a la mort.  Nous perdons encore la vie avec joie,\npourvu qu’on en parle.  On ne peut faire une bonne physionomie (in a\nportrait) qu’en accordant toutes nos contrarietes.  L’homme n’est\nqu’un roseau, le plus foible de la nature, mais c’est un roseau\npensant.  Il ne faut pas que l’univers entier s’arme pour l’ecraser.\nUne vapeur, une goutte d’eau, suffit pour le tuer.  Mais quand\nl’univers l’ecraseroit, l’homme seroit encore plus noble que se qui\nle tue, parce qu’il sait qu’il meurt, et l’avantage que l’univers a\nsur lui, l’univers n’en sait rien.  It is not thought by which that\nexcels, but the convincing force of imagination which sublimates its\nvery triteness.  Toute notre dignite consiste donc en la pensee.",
        "There, then, you have at random the sort of stuff of which the\n\"Pensees” are made.  Let me now briefly indicate, also by quotation\nagain, some of the main leading tendencies in them.  La chose la plus\nimportante a toute la vie c’est la [84] choix du metier: le hasard en\ndispose.  There we recognise the manner of thought of Montaigne.  Now\none of the leading interests in the study of Pascal is to trace the\ninfluence upon him of the typical sceptic of the preceding century.\nPascal’s “Thoughts” we shall never understand unless we realise the\nunder-texture in them of Montaigne’s very phrases, the fascination\nthe “Essays” had for Pascal in his capacity of one of the children of\nlight, as giving a veritable compte rendu of the Satanic course of\nthis world since the Fall, set forth with all the persuasiveness, the\npower and charm, all the gifts of Satan, the veritable light on\nthings he has at his disposal.",
        "Pascal re-echoes Montaigne then in asserting the paradoxical\ncharacter of man and his experience.  The old headings under which\nthe Port-Royalist editors grouped the “Thoughts” recall the titles of\nMontaigne’s “Essays\"–\"Of the Disproportion of Man,” and the like. As\nstrongly as Montaigne he delights in asserting the relative, local,\nephemeral and merely provisional character of our ideas of law, vice,\nvirtue, happiness, and so forth.  Comme la mode fait l’agrement aussi\nfait-elle la justice.  La justice et la verite sont deux pointes si\nsubtiles, que nos instruments sont trop mousses pour y toucher\nexactement.  Bien suivant la seule raison n’est juste de soi: tout\nbranle avec le temps.  Sometimes he strikes the express accent of\nMontaigne: Ceux qui sont dans un vaisseau croient que ceux qui sont\n[85] au bord fuient.  Le langage est pareil de tous cotes.  Il faut\navoir un point fixe pour en juger.  Le port juge ceux qui sont dans\nun vaisseau, mais ou prendrons-nous un port dans la morale?  At times\nhe seems to forget that he himself and Montaigne are after all not of\nthe same flock, as his mind grazes in those pleasant places.  Qu’il\n(man) se regarde comme egare dans ce canton detourne de la nature, et\nde ce petit cachot ou il se trouve loge, qu’il apprenne the earth, et\nsoi-meme a son juste prix.  Il ffre, mais elle est ployable a tous\nsens; et ainsi il n’y en a point.  Un meme sens change selon les\nparoles qui l’expriment.  He has touches even of what he calls the\nmalignity, the malign irony of Montaigne.  Rien que la mediocrite\nn’est bon, he says,–epris des hauteurs, as he so conspicuously was–\nC’est sortir de l’humanite que de sortir du milieu; la grandeur de\nl’ame humaine consiste a savoir s’y tenir.  Rien ne fortifie plus le\npyrrhonisme–that is ever his word for scepticism–que ce qu’il y en\na qui ne sont pas pyrrhoniens: si tous etaient ils auraient tort.\nYou may even credit him, like Montaigne, with a somewhat Satanic\nintimacy with the ways, the cruel ways, the weakness, lachete, of the\nhuman heart, so that, as he says of Montaigne, himself too might be a\npernicious study for those who have a native tendency to corruption.",
        "The paradoxical condition of the world, the natural inconsistency of\nman, his strange [86] blending of meanness with ancient greatness,\nthe caprices of his status here, of his power and attainments, in the\nissue of his existence–that is what the study of Montaigne had\nenforced on Pascal as the sincere compte rendu of experience.  But\nthen he passes at a tangent from the circle of the great sceptic’s\napprehension.  That prospect of man and the world, undulant,\ncapricious, inconsistent, contemptible, lache, full of contradiction,\nwith a soul of evil in things good, irreducible to law, upon which,\nafter all, Montaigne looks out with a complacency so entire, fills\nPascal with terror.  It is the world on the morrow of a great\ncatastrophe, the casual forces of which have by no means spent\nthemselves.  Yes! this world we see, of which we are a part, with its\nthousand dislocations, is precisely what we might expect as resultant\nfrom the Fall of Man, with consequences in full working still.  It\npresents the appropriate aspect of a lost world, though with beams of\nredeeming grace about it, those, too, distributed somewhat\ncapriciously to chosen people and elect souls, who, after all, can\nhave but an ill time of it here.  Under the tragic eclairs of divine\nwrath essentially implacable, the gentle, pleasantly undulating,\nsunny, earthly prospect of poor loveable humanity which opens out for\none in Montaigne’s “Essays,” becomes for Pascal a scene of harsh\nprecipices, of threatening heights and depths–the depths of his own\nnothingness.  Vanity: nothingness: these [87] are his catchwords:\nNous sommes incapables et du vrai et du bien; nous sommes tous\ncondamnes.  Ce qui y parait (i.e., what we see in the world) ne\nmarque ni une exclusion totale ni une presence manifeste de divinite,\nmais la presence d’un Dieu qui se cache: (Deus absconditus, that is a\nrecurrent favourite thought of his) tout porte ce caractere.  In this\nworld of abysmal dilemmas, he is ready to push all things to their\nextremes.  All or nothing; for him real morality will be nothing\nshort of sanctity.  En Jesus Christ toutes les contradictions sont\naccordees.  Yet what difficulties again in the religion of Christ!\nNulle autre religion n’a propose de se hair.  La seule religion\ncontraire a la nature, contraire au sens commun, est la seule qui ait\ntoujours ete.",
        "Multitudes in every generation have felt at least the aesthetic charm\nof the rites of the Catholic Church.  For Pascal, on the other hand,\na certain weariness, a certain puerility, a certain unprofitableness\nin them is but an extra trial of faith.  He seems to have little\nsense of the beauty of holiness.  And for his sombre, trenchant,\nprecipitous philosophy there could be no middle terms; irresistible\nelection, irresistible reprobation; only sometimes extremes meet, and\nagain it may be the trial of faith that the justified seem as\nloveless and unlovely as the reprobate.  Abetissez-vous!  A nature,\nyou may think, that would magnify things to the utmost, nurse, expand\nthem beyond their natural bounds by his [88] reflex action upon them.\nThus revelation is to be received on evidence, indeed, but an\nevidence conclusive only on a presupposition or series of\npresuppositions, evidence that is supplemented by an act of\nimagination, or by the grace of faith, shall we say?  At any rate,\nthe fact is, that the genius of the great reasoner, of this great\nmaster of the abstract and deductive sciences, turned theologian,\ncarrying the methods of thought there formed into the things of\nfaith, was after all of the imaginative order.  Now hear what he says\nof imagination: Cette faculte trompeuse, qui semble nous etre donnee\nexpres pour nous induire a une erreur necessaire.  That has a sort of\nnecessity in it.  What he says has again the air of Montaigne, and he\nsays much of the same kind: Cette superbe puissance ennemie de la\nraison, combien toutes les richesses de la terre sont insuffisantes\nsans son consentement.  The imagination has the disposition of all\nthings: Elle fait la beaute, la justice, et le bonheur, qui est le\ntout du monde.  L’imagination dispose de tout.  And what we have here\nto note is its extraordinary power in himself.  Strong in him as the\nreasoning faculty, so to speak, it administered the reasoning faculty\nin him a son grbut he was unaware of it, that power d’autant plus\nfourbe qu’elle ne l’est pas toujours.  Hidden under the apparent\nrigidity of his favourite studies, imagination, even in them, played\na large part.  Physics, mathematics were with him largely matters of\nintuition, anticipation, [89] precocious discovery, short cuts,\nsuperb guessing.  It was the inventive element in his work and his\nway of putting things that surprised those best able to judge.  He\nmight have discovered the mathematical sciences for himself, it is\nalleged, had his father, as he once had a mind to do, withheld him\nfrom instruction in them.",
        "About the time when he was bidding adieu to the world, Pascal had an\naccident.  As he drove round a corner on the Seine side to cross the\nbridge at Neuilly, the horses were precipitated down the bank into\nthe water.  Pascal escaped, but with a nervous shock, a certain\nhallucination, from which he never recovered.  As he walked or sat he\nwas apt to perceive a yawning depth beside him; would set stick or\nchair there to reassure himself.  We are now told, indeed, that that\ncircumstance has been greatly exaggerated.  But how true to Pascal’s\ntemper, as revealed in his work, that alarmed precipitous character\nin it!  Intellectually the abyss was evermore at his side.  Nous\navons, he observes, un autre principe d’erreur, les maladies.  Now in\nhim the imagination itself was like a physical malady, troubling,\ndisturbing, or in active collusion with it.  .  .  .",

        "[90] TITIAN, as we see him in what some have thought his noblest\nwork, the large altar-piece, dated 1522, his forty-fifth year, of SS.\nNazaro e Celso, at Brescia, is certainly a religious–a great,\nreligious painter.  The famous Gabriel of the Annunciation, aflight,\nin all the effortless energy of an angel indeed, and Sebastian,\nadapted, it was said, from an ancient statue, yet as novel in design\nas if Titian had been the first to handle that so familiar figure in\nold religious art–may represent for us a vast and varied amount of\nwork–in which he expands to their utmost artistic compass the\nearlier religious dreams of Mantegna and the Bellini, affording\nsufficient proof how sacred themes could rouse his imagination, and\nall his manual skill, to heroic efforts.  But he is also the painter\nof the Venus of the Tribune and the Triumph of Bacchus; and such\nfrank acceptance of the voluptuous paganism of the Renaissance, the\nmotive of a large proportion of his work, [91] might make us think\nthat religion, grandly dramatic as was his conception of it, can have\nbeen for him only one of many pictorial attitudes.  There are however\npainters of that date who, while their work is great enough to be\nconnected (perhaps groundlessly) with Titian’s personal influence, or\ndirectly attributed to his hand, possess at least this psychological\ninterest, that about their religiousness there can be no question.\nTheir work is to be looked for mainly in and about the two sub-alpine\ntowns of Brescia and Bergamo; in the former of which it becomes\ndefinable as a school–the school of Moretto, in whom the perfected\nart of the later Renaissance is to be seen in union with a\ncatholicism as convinced, towards the middle of the sixteenth\ncentury, as that of Giotto or Angelico.",
        "Moretto of Brescia, for instance, is one of the few painters who have\nfully understood the artistic opportunities of the subject of Saint\nPaul, for whom, for the most part, art has found only the\nconventional trappings of a Roman soldier (a soldier, as being in\ncharge of those prisoners to Damascus), or a somewhat commonplace old\nage.  Moretto also makes him a nobly accoutred soldier–the rim of\nthe helmet, thrown backward in his fall to the earth, rings the head\nalready with a faint circle of glory–but a soldier still in\npossession of all those resources of unspoiled youth which he is\nready to offer in a [92] moment to the truth that has just dawned\nvisibly upon him.  The terrified horse, very grandly designed, leaps\nhigh against the suddenly darkened sky above the distant horizon of\nDamascus, with all Moretto’s peculiar understanding of the power of\nblack and white.  But what signs the picture inalienably as Moretto’s\nown is the thought of the saint himself, at the moment of his\nrecovery from the stroke of Heaven.  The pure, pale, beardless face,\nin noble profile, might have had for its immediate model some\nmilitary monk of a later age, yet it breathes all the joy and\nconfidence of the Apostle who knows in a single flash of time that he\nhas found the veritable captain of his soul.  It is indeed the Paul\nwhose genius of conviction has so greatly moved the minds of men–the\nsoldier who, bringing his prisoners “bound to Damascus,” is become\nthe soldier of Jesus Christ.",
        "Moretto’s picture has found its place (in a dark recess, alas!) in\nthe Church of Santa Maria presso San Celso, in the suburbs of Milan,\nhard by the site of the old Roman cemetery, where Ambrose, at a\nmoment when in one of his many conflicts a “sign” was needed, found\nthe bodies of Nazarus and Celsus, youthful patrician martyrs in the\nreign of Nero, overflowing now with miraculous powers, their blood\nstill fresh upon them–conspersa recenti sanguine.  The body of Saint\nNazarus he removed into the city: that of Saint Celsus remained\nwithin the little sanctuary [93] which still bears his name, and\nbeside which, in the fifteenth century, arose the glorious Church of\nthe Madonna, with spacious atrium after the Ambrosian manner, a\nfacade richly sculptured in the style of the Renaissance, and\nsumptuously adorned within.  Behind the massive silver tabernacle of\nthe altar of the miraculous picture which gave its origin to this\nsplendid building, the rare visitor, peeping as into some sacred\nbird-nest, detects one of the loveliest works of Luini, a small, but\nexquisitely finished “Holy Family.”  Among the fine pictures around\nare works by two other very notable religious painters of the cinque-\ncento.  Both alike, Ferrari and Borgognone, may seem to have\nintroduced into fiery Italian latitudes a certain northern\ntemperature, and somewhat twilight, French, or Flemish, or German,\nthoughts.  Ferrari, coming from the neighbourhood of Varallo, after\nwork at Vercelli and Novara, returns thither to labour, as both\nsculptor and painter, in the “stations” of the Sacro Monte, at a form\nof religious art which would seem to have some natural kinship with\nthe temper of a mountain people.  It is as if the living actors in\nthe “Passion Play” of Oberammergau had been transformed into almost\nillusive groups in painted terra-cotta.  The scenes of the Last\nSupper, of the Martyrdom of the Innocents, of the Raising of Jairus’\ndaughter, for instance, are certainly touching in the naive piety of\ntheir life-sized realism.  But Gaudenzio Ferrari had many [94]\nhelpmates at the Sacro Monte; and his lovelier work is in the\nFranciscan Church at the foot of the hill, and in those two, truly\nItalian, far-off towns of the Lombard plain.  Even in his great,\nmany-storied fresco in the Franciscan Church at Varallo there are\ntraces of a somewhat barbaric hankering after solid form; the armour\nof the Roman soldiers, for example, is raised and gilt.  It is as if\nthis serious soul, going back to his mountain home, had lapsed again\ninto mountain “grotesque,” with touches also, in truth, of a\npeculiarly northern poetry–a mystic poetry, which now and again, in\nhis treatment, for instance, of angel forms and faces, reminds one of\nBlake.  There is something of it certainly in the little white\nspectral soul of the penitent thief making its escape from the\ndishonoured body along the beam of his cross.",
        "The contrast is a vigorous one when, in the space of a few hours, the\ntraveller finds himself at Vercelli, half-stifled in its thick\npressing crop of pumpkins and mulberry trees.  The expression of the\nprophet occurs to him: “A lodge in a garden of cucumbers.”  Garden of\ncucumbers and half-tropical flowers, it has invaded the quiet open\nspaces of the town.  Search through them, through the almost\ncloistral streets, for the Church of the Umiliati; and there, amid\nthe soft garden-shadows of the choir, you may find the sentiment of\nthe neighbourhood expressed with great refinement in what is perhaps\n[95] the masterpiece of Ferrari, “Our Lady of the Fruit-garden,” as\nwe might say–attended by twelve life-sized saints and the monkish\ndonors of the picture.  The remarkable proportions of the tall panel,\nup which the green-stuff is climbing thickly above the mitres and\nsacred garniture of those sacred personages, lend themselves\nharmoniously to the gigantic stature of Saint Christopher in the\nforeground as the patron saint of the church.  With the savour of\nthis picture in his memory, the visitor will look eagerly in some\nhalf-dozen neighbouring churches and deserted conventual places for\ncertain other works from Ferrari’s hand; and so, leaving the place\nunder the influence of his delicate religious ideal, may seem to have\nbeen listening to much exquisite church-music there, violins and the\nlike, on that perfectly silent afternoon–such music as he may still\nreally hear on Sundays at the neighbouring town of Novara, famed for\nit from of old.  Here, again, the art of Gaudenzio Ferrari reigns.\nGaudenzio!  It is the name of the saintly prelate on whom his pencil\nwas many times employed, First Bishop of Novara, and patron of the\nmagnificent basilica hard by which still covers his body, whose\nearthly presence in cope and mitre Ferrari has commemorated in the\naltar-piece of the “Marriage of St. Catherine,” with its refined\nrichness of colour, like a bank of real flowers blooming there, and\nlike nothing else around it in the [96] vast duomo of old Roman\narchitecture, now heavily masked in modern stucco.  The solemn\nmountains, under the closer shadow of which his genius put on a\nnorthern hue, are far away, telling at Novara only as the grandly\ntheatrical background to an entirely lowland life.  And here, as at\nVercelli so at Novara, Ferrari is not less graciously Italian than\nLuini himself.",
        "If the name of Luini’s master, Borgognone, is no proof of northern\nextraction, a northern temper is nevertheless a marked element of his\ngenius–something of the patience, especially, of the masters of\nDijon or Bruges, nowhere more clearly than in the two groups of male\nand female heads in the National Gallery, family groups, painted in\nthe attitude of worship, with a lowly religious sincerity which may\nremind us of the contemporary work of M. Legros.  Like those northern\nmasters, he accepts piously, but can refine, what “has no\ncomeliness.”  And yet perhaps no painter has so adequately presented\nthat purely personal beauty (for which, indeed, even profane painters\nfor the most part have seemed to care very little) as Borgognone in\nthe two deacons, Stephen and Laurence, who, in one of the altar-\npieces of the Certosa, assist at the throne of Syrus, ancient,\nsainted, First Bishop of Pavia–stately youths in quite imperial\ndalmatics of black and gold.  An indefatigable worker at many forms\nof religious art, here and elsewhere, assisting at last in the [97]\ncarving and inlaying of the rich marble facade of the Certosa, the\nrich carved and inlaid wood-work of Santa Maria at Bergamo, he is\nseen perhaps at his best, certainly in his most significantly\nreligious mood, in the Church of the Incoronata at Lodi, especially\nin one picture there, the “Presentation of Christ in the Temple.\"\nThe experienced visitor knows what to expect in the sacristies of the\ngreat Italian churches; the smaller, choicer works of Luini, say, of\nDella Robbia or Mino of Fiesole, the superb ambries and drawers and\npresses of old oak or cedar, the still untouched morsel of fresco–\nlike sacred priestly thoughts visibly lingering there in the half-\nlight.  Well! the little octagonal Church of the Incoronata is like\none of these sacristies.  The work of Bramante–you see it, as it is\nso rarely one’s luck to do, with its furniture and internal\ndecoration complete and unchanged, the coloured pavement, the\ncolouring which covers the walls, the elegant little organ of\nDomenico da Lucca (1507), the altar-screens with their dainty rows of\nbrass cherubs.  In Borgognone’s picture of the “Presentation,” there\nthe place is, essentially as we see it to-day.  The ceremony,\ninvested with all the sentiment of a Christian sacrament, takes place\nin this very church, this “Temple” of the Incoronata where you are\nstanding, reflected on the dimly glorious wall, as in a mirror.\nBorgognone in his picture has [98] but added in long legend, letter\nby letter, on the fascia below the cupola, the Song of Simeon.",
        "The Incoronata however is, after all, the monument less of Ambrogio\nBorgognone than of the gifted Piazza family:–Callisto, himself born\nat Lodi, his father, his uncle, his brothers, his son Fulvio, working\nthere in three generations, under marked religious influence, and\nwith so much power and grace that, quite gratuitously, portions of\ntheir work have been attributed to the master-hand of Titian, in some\nimaginary visit here to these painters, who were in truth the\ndisciples of another–Romanino of Brescia.  At Lodi, the lustre of\nScipione Piazza is lost in that of Callisto, his elder brother; but\nhe might worthily be included in a list of painters memorable for a\nsingle picture, such pictures as the solemn Madonna of Pierino del\nVaga, in the Duomo of Pisa, or the Holy Family of Pellegrino Piola,\nin the Goldsmiths’ Street at Genoa.  A single picture, a single\nfigure in a picture, signed and dated, over the altar of Saint\nClement, in the Church of San Spirito, at Bergamo, might preserve the\nfame of Scipione Piazza, who did not live to be old.  The figure is\nthat of the youthful Clement of Rome himself, “who had seen the\nblessed Apostles,” writing at the dictation of Saint Paul.  For a\nmoment he looks away from the letters of the book with all the\nwistful intelligence of a boy softly touched already by the radiancy\nof the [99] celestial Wisdom.  “Her ways are ways of pleasantness!\"\nThat is the lesson this winsome, docile, spotless creature–ingenui\nvultus puer ingenuique pudoris–younger brother or cousin of\nBorgognone’s noble deacons at the Certosa–seems put there to teach\nus.  And in this church, indeed, as it happens, Scipione’s work is\nside by side with work of his.",
        "It is here, in fact, at Bergamo and at Brescia, that the late\nsurvival of a really convinced religious spirit becomes a striking\nfact in the history of Italian art.  Vercelli and Novara, though\nfamous for their mountain neighbourhood, enjoy but a distant and\noccasional view of Monte Rosa and its companions; and even then those\nawful stairways to tracts of airy sunlight may seem hardly real.  But\nthe beauty of the twin sub-alpine towns further eastward is shaped by\nthe circumstance that mountain and plain meet almost in their\nstreets, very effectively for all purposes of the picturesque.\nBrescia, immediately below the “Falcon of Lombardy” (so they called\nits masterful fortress on the last ledge of the Pie di Monte), to\nwhich you may now ascend by gentle turfed paths, to watch the purple\nmystery of evening mount gradually from the great plain up the\nmountain-walls close at hand, is as level as a church pavement, home-\nlike, with a kind of easy walking from point to point about it, rare\nin Italian towns–a town full of walled gardens, giving even to [100]\nits smaller habitations the retirement of their more sumptuous\nneighbours, and a certain English air.  You may peep into them,\npacing its broad streets, from the blaze of which you are glad to\nescape into the dim and sometimes gloomy churches, the twilight\nsacristies, rich with carved and coloured woodwork.  The art of\nRomanino still lights up one of the darkest of those churches with\nthe altar-piece which is perhaps his most expressive and noblest\nwork.  The veritable blue sky itself seems to be breaking into the\ndark-cornered, low-vaulted, Gothic sanctuary of the Barefoot\nBrethren, around the Virgin and Child, the bowed, adoring figures of\nBonaventura, Saint Francis, Saint Antony, the youthful majesty of\nSaint Louis, to keep for ever in memory–not the King of France\nhowever, in spite of the fleurs-de-lys on his cope of azure, but\nLouis, Bishop of Toulouse.  A Rubens in Italy! you may think, if you\ncare to rove from the delightful fact before you after vague\nsupposititious alliances–something between Titian and Rubens!\nCertainly, Romanino’s bold, contrasted colouring anticipates\nsomething of the northern freshness of Rubens.  But while the\npeculiarity of the work of Rubens is a sense of momentary transition,\nas if the colours were even now melting in it, Romanino’s canvas\nbears rather the steady glory of broad Italian noonday; while he is\ndistinguished also for a remarkable clearness of [101] design, which\nhas perhaps something to do, is certainly congruous with, a markedly\nreligious sentiment, like that of Angelico or Perugino, lingering\nstill in the soul of this Brescian painter towards the middle of the\nsixteenth century.",
        "Romanino and Moretto, the two great masters of Brescia in successive\ngenerations, both alike inspired above all else by the majesty, the\nmajestic beauty, of religion–its persons, its events, every\ncircumstance that belongs to it–are to be seen in friendly rivalry,\nthough with ten years’ difference of age between them, in the Church\nof San Giovanni Evangelista; Romanino approaching there, as near as\nhe might, in a certain candle-lighted scene, to that harmony in\nblack, white, and grey preferred by the younger painter.  Before this\nor that example of Moretto’s work, in that admirably composed picture\nof Saint Paul’s Conversion, for instance, you might think of him as\nbut a very noble designer in grisaille.  A more detailed study would\nconvince you that, whatever its component elements, there is a very\ncomplex tone which almost exclusively belongs to him; the “Saint\nUrsula” finally, that he is a great, though very peculiar colourist–\na lord of colour who, while he knows the colour resources that may\nlie even in black and white, has really included every delicate hue\nwhatever in that faded “silver grey,” which yet lingers in one’s\nmemory as their final effect.  For some admirers indeed he is\ndefinable [102] as a kind of really sanctified Titian.  It must be\nadmitted, however, that whereas Titian sometimes lost a little of\nhimself in the greatness of his designs, or committed their\nexecution, in part, to others, Moretto, in his work, is always all\nthere–thorough, steady, even, in his workmanship.  That, again, was\na result of his late-surviving religious conscience.  And here, as in\nother instances, the supposed influence of the greater master is only\na supposition.  As a matter of fact, at least in his earlier life,\nMoretto made no visit to Venice; developed his genius at home, under\nsuch conditions for development as were afforded by the example of\nthe earlier masters of Brescia itself; left his work there\nabundantly, and almost there alone, as the thoroughly representative\nproduct of a charming place.  In the little Church of San Clemente he\nis still “at home” to his lovers; an intimately religious artist,\nfull of cheerfulness, of joy.  Upon the airy galleries of his great\naltar-piece, the angels dance against the sky above the Mother and\nthe Child; Saint Clement, patron of the church, being attendant in\npontifical white, with Dominic, Catherine, the Magdalen, and good,\nbig-faced Saint Florian in complete armour, benign and strong.  He\nknows many a saint not in the Roman breviary.  Was there a single\nsweet-sounding name without its martyr patron?  Lucia, Agnes, Agatha,\nBarbara, Cecilia–holy women, dignified, high-bred, intelligent–\n[103] have an altar of their own; and here, as in that festal high\naltar-piece, the spectator may note yet another artistic alliance,\nsomething of the pale effulgence of Correggio–an approach, at least,\nto that peculiar treatment of light and shade, and a pre-occupation\nwith certain tricks therein of nature itself, by which Correggio\ntouches Rembrandt on the one hand, Da Vinci on the other.  Here, in\nMoretto’s work, you may think that manner more delightful, perhaps\nbecause more refined, than in Correggio himself.  Those pensive,\ntarnished, silver side-lights, like mere reflexions of natural\nsunshine, may be noticed indeed in many another painter of that day,\nin Lanini, for instance, at the National Gallery.  In his “Nativity\"\nat the Brera, Procaccini of Verona almost anticipates Correggio’s\nHeilige Nacht.  It is, in truth, the first step in the decomposition\nof light, a touch of decadence, of sunset, along the whole horizon of\nNorth-Italian art.  It is, however, as the painter of the white-\nstoled Ursula and her companions that the great master of Brescia is\nmost likely to remain in the memory of the visitor; with this fact,\nabove all, clearly impressed on it, that Moretto had attained full\nintelligence of all the pictorial powers of white.  In the clearness,\nthe cleanliness, the hieratic distinction, of this earnest and\ndeeply-felt composition, there is something “pre-Raphaelite\"; as also\nin a certain liturgical formality in the grouping of the virgins–the\n[104] looks, “all one way,” of the closely-ranged faces; while in the\nlong folds of the drapery we may see something of the severe grace of\nearly Tuscan sculpture–something of severity in the long, thin,\nemphatic shadows.  For the light is high, as with the level lights of\nearly morning, the air of which ruffles the banners borne by Ursula\nin her two hands, her virgin companions laying their hands also upon\nthe tall staves, as if taking share, with a good will, in her self-\ndedication, with all the hazard of battle.  They bring us,\nappropriately, close to the grave of this manly yet so virginal\npainter, born in the year 1500, dead at forty-seven.",
        "Of Moretto and Romanino, whose works thus light up, or refine, the\ndark churches of Brescia and its neighbourhood, Romanino is scarcely\nto be seen beyond it.  The National Gallery, however, is rich in\nMoretto’s work, with two of his rare poetic portraits; and if the\nlarge altar-picture would hardly tell his secret to one who had not\nstudied him at Brescia, in those who already know him it will awake\nmany a reminiscence of his art at its best.  The three white mitres,\nfor instance, grandly painted towards the centre of the picture, at\nthe feet of Saint Bernardino of Siena–the three bishoprics refused\nby that lowly saint–may remind one of the great white mitre which,\nin the genial picture of Saint Nicholas, in the Miracoli at Brescia,\none of the children, who as delightfully+ [105] unconventional\nacolytes accompany their beloved patron into the presence of the\nMadonna, carries along so willingly, laughing almost, with pleasure\nand pride, at his part in so great a function.  In the altar-piece at\nthe National Gallery those white mitres form the key-note from which\nthe pale, cloistral splendours of the whole picture radiate.  You see\nwhat a wealth of enjoyable colour Moretto, for one, can bring out of\nmonkish habits in themselves sad enough, and receive a new lesson in\nthe artistic value of reserve.",
        "Rarer still (the single work of Romanino, it is said, to be seen out\nof Italy) is the elaborate composition in five parts on the opposite\nside of the doorway.  Painted for the high-altar of one of the many\nchurches of Brescia, it seems to have passed into secular hands about\na century ago.  Alessandro, patron of the church, one of the many\nyouthful patrician converts Italy reveres from the ranks of the Roman\narmy, stands there on one side, with ample crimson banner superbly\nfurled about his lustrous black armour, and on the other–Saint\nJerome, Romanino’s own namesake–neither more nor less than the\nfamiliar, self-tormenting anchorite; for few painters (Bellini, to\nsome degree, in his picture of the saint’s study) have perceived the\nrare pictorial opportunities of Jerome; Jerome with the true cradle\nof the Lord, first of Christian antiquaries, author of the fragrant\nVulgate version of the [106] Scriptures.  Alessandro and Jerome\nsupport the Mother and the Child in the central place.  But the\nloveliest subjects of this fine group of compositions are in the\ncorners above, half-length, life-sized figures–Gaudioso, Bishop of\nBrescia, above Saint Jerome; above Alessandro, Saint Filippo Benizzi,\nmeek founder of the Order of Servites to which that church at Brescia\nbelonged, with his lily, and in the right hand a book; and what a\nbook!  It was another very different painter, Giuseppe Caletti, of\nCremona, who, for the truth and beauty of his drawing of them, gained\nthe title of the “Painter of Books.”  But if you wish to see what can\nbe made of the leaves, the vellum cover, of a book, observe that in\nSaint Philip’s hand.–The writer? the contents? you ask: What may\nthey be? and whence did it come?–out of embalmed sacristy, or\nantique coffin of some early Brescian martyr, or, through that bright\nspace of blue Italian sky, from the hands of an angel, like his\nAnnunciation lily, or the book received in the Apocalypse by John the\nDivine?  It is one of those old saints, Gaudioso (at home in every\nchurch in Brescia), who looks out with full face from the opposite\ncorner of the altar-piece, from a background which, though it might\nbe the new heaven over a new earth, is in truth only the proper,\nbreathable air of Italy.  As we see him here, Saint Gaudioso is one\nof the more exquisite treasures of our National Gallery.  It was thus\nthat at the magic [107] touch of Romanino’s art the dim, early,\nhunted-down Brescian church of the primitive centuries, crushed into\nthe dust, it might seem, was “brought to her king,” out of those old\ndark crypts, “in raiment of needle-work\"–the delicate, richly\nfolded, pontifical white vestments, the mitre and staff and gloves,\nand rich jewelled cope, blue or green.  The face, of remarkable\nbeauty after a type which all feel though it is actually rare in art,\nis probably a portrait of some distinguished churchman of Romanino’s\nown day; a second Gaudioso, perhaps, setting that later Brescian\nchurch to rights after the terrible French occupation in the\npainter’s own time, as his saintly predecessor, the Gaudioso of the\nearlier century here commemorated, had done after the invasion of the\nGoths.  The eloquent eyes are open upon some glorious vision.  “He\nhath made us kings and priests!” they seem to say for him, as the\nclean, sensitive lips might do so eloquently.  Beauty and Holiness\nhad “kissed each other,” as in Borgognone’s imperial deacons at the\nCertosa.  At the Renaissance the world might seem to have parted them\nagain.  But here certainly, once more, Catholicism and the\nRenaissance, religion and culture, holiness and beauty, might seem\nreconciled, by one who had conceived neither after any feeble way, in\na gifted person.  Here at least, by the skill of Romanino’s hand, the\nobscure martyr of the crypts shines as a [108] saint of the later\nRenaissance, with a sanctity of which the elegant world itself would\nhardly escape the fascination, and which reminds one how the great\nApostle Saint Paul has made courtesy part of the content of the\nDivine charity itself.  A Rubens in Italy!–so Romanino has been\ncalled.  In this gracious presence we might think that, like Rubens\nalso, he had been a courtier.",

        "[109] THE greatest and purest of Gothic churches, Notre-Dame\nd’Amiens, illustrates, by its fine qualities, a characteristic\nsecular movement of the beginning of the thirteenth century.\nPhilosophic writers of French history have explained how, in that and\nin the two preceding centuries, a great number of the more important\ntowns in eastern and northern France rose against the feudal\nestablishment, and developed severally the local and municipal life\nof the commune.  To guarantee their independence therein they\nobtained charters from their formal superiors.  The Charter of Amiens\nserved as the model for many other communes.  Notre-Dame d’Amiens is\nthe church of a commune.  In that century of Saint Francis, of Saint\nLouis, they were still religious.  But over against monastic\ninterests, as identified with a central authority–king, emperor, or\npope–they pushed forward the local, and, so to call it, secular\nauthority of their [110] bishops, the flower of the “secular clergy\"\nin all its mundane astuteness, ready enough to make their way as the\nnatural Protectors of such townships.  The people of Amiens, for\ninstance, under a powerful episcopal patron, invested their civic\npride in a vast cathedral, outrivalling neighbours, as being in\neffect their parochial church, and promoted there the new,\nrevolutionary, Gothic manner, at the expense of the derivative and\ntraditional, Roman or Romanesque, style, the imperial style, of the\ngreat monastic churches.  Nay, those grand and beautiful people’s\nchurches of the thirteenth century, churches pre-eminently of “Our\nLady,” concurred also with certain novel humanistic movements of\nreligion itself at that period, above all with the expansion of what\nis reassuring and popular in the worship of Mary, as a tender and\naccessible, though almost irresistible, intercessor with her severe\nand awful Son.",
        "Hence the splendour, the space, the novelty, of the great French\ncathedrals in the first Pointed style, monuments for the most part of\nthe artistic genius of laymen, significant pre-eminently of that\nQueen of Gothic churches at Amiens.  In most cases those early\nPointed churches are entangled, here or there, by the constructions\nof the old round-arched style, the heavy, Norman or other, Romanesque\nchapel or aisle, side by side, though in strong contrast with, the\nsoaring new Gothic of nave or transept.  But of that older [111]\nmanner of the round arch, the plein-cintre, Amiens has nowhere, or\nalmost nowhere, a trace.  The Pointed style, fully pronounced, but in\nall the purity of its first period, found here its completest\nexpression.  And while those venerable, Romanesque, profoundly\ncharacteristic, monastic churches, the gregarious product of long\ncenturies, are for the most part anonymous, as if to illustrate from\nthe first a certain personal tendency which came in with the Gothic\nmanner, we know the name of the architect under whom, in the year\nA.D. 1220, the building of the church of Amiens began–a layman,\nRobert de Luzarches.",
        "Light and space–floods of light, space for a vast congregation, for\nall the people of Amiens, for their movements, with something like\nthe height and width of heaven itself enclosed above them to breathe\nin;–you see at a glance that this is what the ingenuity of the\nPointed method of building has here secured.  For breadth, for the\neasy flow of a processional torrent, there is nothing like the\n\"ambulatory,” the aisle of the choir and transepts.  And the entire\narea is on one level.  There are here no flights of steps upward, as\nat Canterbury, no descending to dark crypts, as in so many Italian\nchurches–a few low, broad steps to gain the choir, two or three to\nthe high altar.  To a large extent the old pavement remains, though\nalmost worn-out by the footsteps of centuries.  Priceless, though not\ncomposed of precious material, it gains its effect [112] by ingenuity\nand variety in the patterning, zig-zags, chequers, mazes, prevailing\nrespectively, in white and grey, in great square, alternate spaces–\nthe original floor of a medieval church for once untouched.  The\nmassive square bases of the pillars of a Romanesque church, harshly\nangular, obstruct, sometimes cruelly, the standing, the movements, of\na multitude of persons.  To carry such a multitude conveniently round\nthem is the matter-of-fact motive of the gradual chiselling away, the\nsoftening of the angles, the graceful compassing, of the Gothic base,\ntill in our own Perpendicular period it all but disappears.  You may\nstudy that tendency appropriately in the one church of Amiens; for\nsuch in effect Notre-Dame has always been.  That circumstance is\nillustrated by the great font, the oldest thing here, an oblong\ntrough, perhaps an ancient saintly coffin, with four quaint prophetic\nfigures at the angles, carved from a single block of stone.  To it,\nas to the baptistery of an Italian town, not so long since all the\nbabes of Amiens used to come for christening.",
        "Strange as it may seem, in this “queen” of Gothic churches, l’eglise\nogivale par excellence, there is nothing of mystery in the vision,\nwhich yet surprises, over and over again, the eye of the visitor who\nenters at the western doorway.  From the flagstone at one’s foot to\nthe distant keystone of the chevet, noblest of its species– [113]\nreminding you of how many largely graceful things, sails of a ship in\nthe wind, and the like!–at one view the whole is visible,\nintelligible;–the integrity of the first design; how later additions\naffixed themselves thereto; how the rich ornament gathered upon it;\nthe increasing richness of the choir; its glazed triforium; the\nrealms of light which expand in the chapels beyond; the astonishing\nboldness of the vault, the astonishing lightness of what keeps it\nabove one; the unity, yet the variety of perspective.  There is no\nmystery here, and indeed no repose.  Like the age which projected it,\nlike the impulsive communal movement which was here its motive, the\nPointed style at Amiens is full of excitement.  Go, for repose, to\nclassic work, with the simple vertical law of pressure downwards, or\nto its Lombard, Rhenish, or Norman derivatives.  Here, rather, you\nare conscious restlessly of that sustained equilibrium of oblique\npressure on all sides, which is the essence of the hazardous Gothic\nconstruction, a construction of which the “flying buttress” is the\nmost significant feature.  Across the clear glass of the great\nwindows of the triforium you see it, feel it, at its Atlas-work\naudaciously.  “A pleasant thing it is to behold the sun” those first\nGothic builders would seem to have said to themselves; and at Amiens,\nfor instance, the walls have disappeared; the entire building is\ncomposed of its windows.  Those who built it [114] might have had for\ntheir one and only purpose to enclose as large a space as possible\nwith the given material.",
        "No; the peculiar Gothic buttress, with its double, triple, fourfold\nflights, while it makes such marvels possible, securing light and\nspace and graceful effect, relieving the pillars within of their\nmassiveness, is not a restful architectural feature.  Consolidation\nof matter naturally on the move, security for settlement in a very\ncomplex system of construction–that is avowedly a part of the Gothic\nsituation, the Gothic problem.  With the genius which contended,\nthough not always quite successfully, with this difficult problem,\ncame also novel aesthetic effect, a whole volume of delightful\naesthetic effects.  For the mere melody of Greek architecture, for\nthe sense as it were of music in the opposition of successive sounds,\nyou got harmony, the richer music generated by opposition of sounds\nin one and the same moment; and were gainers.  And then, in contrast\nwith the classic manner, and the Romanesque survivals from it, the\nvast complexity of the Gothic style seemed, as if consciously, to\ncorrespond to the richness, the expressiveness, the thousandfold\ninfluence of the Catholic religion, in the thirteenth century still\nin natural movement in every direction.  The later Gothic of the\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries tended to conceal, as it now took\nfor granted, the structural use of the buttress, for [115] example;\nseemed to turn it into a mere occasion for ornament, not always\npleasantly:–while the ornament was out of place, the structure\nfailed.  Such falsity is far enough away from what at Amiens is\nreally of the thirteenth century.  In this pre-eminently “secular\"\nchurch, the execution, in all the defiance of its method, is direct,\nfrank, clearly apparent, with the result not only of reassuring the\nintelligence, but of keeping one’s curiosity also continually on the\nalert, as we linger in these restless aisles.",
        "The integrity of the edifice, together with its volume of light, has\nindeed been diminished by the addition of a range of chapels, beyond\nthe proper limits of the aisles, north and south.  Not a part of the\noriginal design, these chapels were formed for private uses in the\nfourteenth century, by the device of walling in and vaulting the open\nspaces between the great buttresses of the nave.  Under the broad but\nsubdued sunshine which falls through range upon range of windows,\nreflected from white wall and roof and gallery, soothing to the eye,\nwhile it allows you to see the delicate carved work in all its\nrefinement of touch, it is only as an after-thought, an artificial\nafter-thought, that you regret the lost stained glass, or the\nvanished mural colour, if such to any large extent there ever were.\nThe best stained glass is often that stained by weather, by centuries\nof weather, [116] and we may well be grateful for the amazing\ncheerfulness of the interior of Amiens, as we actually find it.\nWindows of the richest remain, indeed, in the apsidal chapels; and\nthe rose-windows of the transepts are known, from the prevailing\ntones of their stained glass, as Fire and Water, the western rose\nsymbolising in like manner Earth and Air, as respectively green and\nblue.  But there is no reason to suppose that the interior was ever\nso darkened as to prevent one’s seeing, really and clearly, the\ndainty ornament, which from the first abounded here; the floriated\narchitectural detail; the broad band of flowers and foliage, thick\nand deep and purely sculptured, above the arches of nave and choir\nand transepts, and wreathing itself continuously round the embedded\npiers which support the roof; with the woodwork, the illuminated\nmetal, the magnificent tombs, the jewellers’ work in the chapels.\nOne precious, early thirteenth-century window of grisaille remains,\nexquisite in itself, interesting as evidence of the sort of\ndecoration which originally filled the larger number of the windows.\nGrisaille, with its lace-work of transparent grey, set here and there\nwith a ruby, a sapphire, a gemmed medallion, interrupts the clear\nlight on things hardly more than the plain glass, of which indeed\nsuch windows are mainly composed.  The finely designed frames of iron\nfor the support of the glass, in the windows from which even [117]\nthis decoration is gone, still remain, to the delight of those who\nare knowing in the matter.",
        "Very ancient light, this seems, at any rate, as if it had been lying\nimprisoned thus for long centuries; were in fact the light over which\nthe great vault originally closed, now become almost substance of\nthought, one might fancy,–a mental object or medium.  We are\nreminded that after all we must of necessity look on the great\nchurches of the Middle Age with other eyes than those who built or\nfirst worshipped in them; that there is something verily worth\nhaving, and a just equivalent for something else lost, in the mere\neffect of time, and that the salt of all aesthetic study is in the\nquestion,–What, precisely what, is this to me?  You and I, perhaps,\nshould not care much for the mural colouring of a medieval church,\ncould we see it as it was; might think it crude, and in the way.\nWhat little remains of it at Amiens has parted, indeed, in the course\nof ages, with its shrillness and its coarse grain.  And in this\nmatter certainly, in view of Gothic polychrome, our difference from\nthe people of the thirteenth century is radical.  We have, as it was\nvery unlikely they should have, a curiosity, a very pleasurable\ncuriosity, in the mere working of the stone they built with, and in\nthe minute facts of their construction, which their colouring, and\nthe layer of plaster it involved, disguised or hid.  We may think\nthat in architecture stone is the most beautiful [118] of all things.\nModern hands have replaced the colour on some of the tombs here–the\neffigies, the tabernacles above–skilfully as may be, and have but\ndeprived them of their dignity.  Medieval colouring, in fact, must\nhave improved steadily, as it decayed, almost till there came to be\nno question of colour at all.  In architecture, close as it is to\nmen’s lives and their history, the visible result of time is a large\nfactor in the realised aesthetic value, and what a true architect\nwill in due measure always trust to.  A false restoration only\nfrustrates the proper ripening of his work.",
        "If we may credit our modern eyes, then, those old, very secular\nbuilders aimed at, they achieved, an immense cheerfulness in their\ngreat church, with a purpose which still pursued them into their\nminuter decoration.  The conventional vegetation of the Romanesque,\nits blendings of human or animal with vegetable form, in cornice or\ncapital, have given way here, in the first Pointed style, to a\npleasanter, because more natural, mode of fancy; to veritable forms\nof vegetable life, flower or leaf, from meadow and woodside, though\nstill indeed with a certain survival of the grotesque in a confusion\nof the leaf with the flower, which the subsequent Decorated period\nwill wholly purge away in its perfect garden-borders.  It was not\nwith monastic artists and artisans that the sheds and workshops\naround Amiens Cathedral were filled, [119] as it rose from its\nfoundations through fifty years; and those lay schools of art, with\ntheir communistic sentiment, to which in the thirteenth century the\ngreat episcopal builders must needs resort, would in the natural\ncourse of things tend towards naturalism.  The subordinate arts also\nwere no longer at the monastic stage, borrowing inspiration\nexclusively from the experiences of the cloister, but belonged to\nguilds of laymen–smiths, painters, sculptors.  The great\nconfederation of the “city,” the commune, subdivided itself into\nconfederations of citizens.  In the natural objects of the first\nPointed style there is the freshness as of nature itself, seen and\nfelt for the first time; as if, in contrast, those older cloistral\nworkmen had but fed their imagination in an embarrassed, imprisoned,\nand really decadent manner, or mere reminiscence of, or prescriptions\nabout, things visible.",
        "Congruous again with the popularity of the builders of Amiens, of\ntheir motives, is the wealth, the freedom and abundance, of popular,\nalmost secular, teaching, here afforded, in the carving especially,\nwithin and without; an open Bible, in place of later legend, as at\nmonastic Vezelay,–the Bible treated as a book about men and women,\nand other persons equally real, but blent with lessons, with the\nliveliest observations, on the lives of men as they were then and\nnow, what they do, and how they do it, or did it then, and on the\ndoings of nature [120] which so greatly influence what man does;\ntogether with certain impressive metaphysical and moral ideas, a sort\nof popular scholastic philosophy, or as if it were the virtues and\nvices Aristotle defines, or the characters of Theophrastus,\ntranslated into stone.  Above all, it is to be observed that as a\nresult of this spirit, this “free” spirit, in it, art has at last\nbecome personal.  The artist, as such, appears at Amiens, as\nelsewhere, in the thirteenth century; and, by making his personal way\nof conception and execution prevail there, renders his own work vivid\nand organic, and apt to catch the interest of other people.  He is no\nlonger a Byzantine, but a Greek–an unconscious Greek.  Proof of this\nis in the famous Beau-Dieu of Amiens, as they call that benign,\nalmost classically proportioned figure, on the central pillar of the\ngreat west doorway; though in fact neither that, nor anything else on\nthe west front of Amiens, is quite the best work here.  For that we\nmust look rather to the sculpture of the portal of the south\ntransept, called, from a certain image there, Portail de la Vierge\ndoree, gilded at the expense of some unknown devout person at the\nbeginning of the last century.  A presentation of the mystic, the\ndelicately miraculous, story of Saint Honore, eighth Bishop of\nAmiens, and his companions, with its voices, its intuitions, and\ncelestial intimations, it has evoked a correspondent method of work\nat once [121] naive and nicely expressive.  The rose, or roue, above\nit, carries on the outer rim seventeen personages, ascending and\ndescending–another piece of popular philosophy–the wheel of\nfortune, or of human life.",
        "And they were great brass-founders, surely, who at that early day\nmodelled and cast the tombs of the Bishops Evrard and Geoffrey, vast\nplates of massive black bronze in half-relief, like abstract thoughts\nof those grand old prelatic persons.  The tomb of Evrard, who laid\nthe foundations (qui fundamenta hujus basilicae locavit), is not\nquite as it was.  Formerly it was sunk in the pavement, while the\ntomb of Bishop Geoffrey opposite (it was he closed in the mighty\nvault of the nave: hanc basilicam culmen usque perduxit), itself\nvaulted-over the space of the grave beneath.  The supreme excellence\nof those original workmen, the journeymen of Robert de Luzarches and\nhis successor, would seem indeed to have inspired others, who have\nbeen at their best here, down to the days of Louis the Fourteenth.\nIt prompted, we may think, a high level of execution, through many\nrevolutions of taste in such matters; in the marvellous furniture of\nthe choir, for instance, like a whole wood, say a thicket of old\nhawthorn, with its curved topmost branches spared, slowly transformed\nby the labour of a whole family of artists, during fourteen years,\ninto the stalls, in number one hundred and ten, with nearly four\n[122] thousand figures.  Yet they are but on a level with the\nFlamboyant carved and coloured enclosures of the choir, with the\nhistories of John the Baptist, whose face-bones are here preserved,\nand of Saint Firmin–popular saint, who protects the houses of Amiens\nfrom fire.  Even the screens of forged iron around the sanctuary,\nwork of the seventeenth century, appear actually to soar, in their\nway, in concert with the airy Gothic structure; to let the daylight\npass as it will; to have come, they too, from smiths, odd as it may\nseem at just that time, with some touch of inspiration in them.  In\nthe beginning of the fifteenth century they had reared against a\ncertain bald space of wall, between the great portal and the western\n\"rose,” an organ, a lofty, many-chambered, veritable house of church-\nmusic, rich in azure and gold, finished above at a later day, not\nincongruously, in the quaint, pretty manner of Henri-Deux.  And those\nwho are interested in the curiosities of ritual, of the old\nprovincial Gallican “uses,” will be surprised to find one where they\nmight least have expected it.  The reserved Eucharist still hangs\nsuspended in a pyx, formed like a dove, in the midst of that\nlamentable “glory” of the eighteenth century in the central bay of\nthe sanctuary, all the poor, gaudy, gilt rays converging towards it.\nThere are days in the year in which the great church is still\nliterally filled with reverent worshippers, and if you come late to\nservice you push the [123] doors in vain against the closely serried\nshoulders of the good people of Amiens, one and all in black for\nchurch-holiday attire.  Then, one and all, they intone the Tantum\nergo (did it ever sound so in the Middle Ages?) as the Eucharist,\nafter a long procession, rises once more into its resting-place.",
        "If the Greeks, as at least one of them says, really believed there\ncould be no true beauty without bigness, that thought certainly is\nmost specious in regard to architecture; and the thirteenth-century\nchurch of Amiens is one of the three or four largest buildings in the\nworld, out of all proportion to any Greek building, both in that and\nin the multitude of its external sculpture.  The chapels of the nave\nare embellished without by a double range of single figures, or\ngroups, commemorative of the persons, the mysteries, to which they\nare respectively dedicated–the gigantic form of Christopher, the\nMystery of the Annunciation.",
        "The builders of the church seem to have projected no very noticeable\ntowers; though it is conventional to regret their absence, especially\nwith visitors from England, where indeed cathedral and other towers\nare apt to be good, and really make their mark.  Robert de Luzarches\nand his successors aimed rather at the domical outline, with its\ncentral point at the centre of the church, in the spire or fleche.\nThe existing spire is a wonderful mass of carpentry [124] of the\nbeginning of the sixteenth century, at which time the lead that\ncarefully wraps every part of it was heavily gilt.  The great western\ntowers are lost in the west front, the grandest, perhaps the\nearliest, example of its species–three profound, sculptured portals;\na double gallery above, the upper gallery carrying colossal images of\ntwenty-two kings of the House of Judah, ancestors of Our Lady; then\nthe great rose; above it the ringers’ gallery, half masking the gable\nof the nave, and uniting at their top-most storeys the twin, but not\nexactly equal or similar, towers, oddly oblong in plan, as if never\nintended to carry pyramids or spires.  They overlook an immense\ndistance in those flat, peat-digging, black and green regions, with\nrather cheerless rivers, and are the centre of an architectural\nregion wider still–of a group to which Soissons, far beyond the\nwoods of Compiegne, belongs, with St. Quentin, and, towards the west,\na too ambitious rival, Beauvais, which has stood however–what we now\nsee of it–for six centuries.",
        "It is a spare, rather sad world at most times that Notre-Dame\nd’Amiens thus broods over; a country with little else to be proud of;\nthe sort of world, in fact, which makes the range of conceptions\nembodied in these cliffs of quarried and carved stone all the more\nwelcome as a hopeful complement to the meagreness of most people’s\npresent existence, and its apparent ending in a [125] sparely built\ncoffin under the flinty soil, and grey, driving sea-winds.  In Notre-\nDame, therefore, and her sisters, there is not only a common method\nof construction, a single definable type, different from that of\nother French latitudes, but a correspondent common sentiment also;\nsomething which speaks, amid an immense achievement just here of what\nis beautiful and great, of the necessity of an immense effort in the\nnatural course of things, of what you may see quaintly designed in\none of those hieroglyphic carvings–radix de terra sitienti: “a root\nout of a dry ground.”",

        "[126] As you discern the long unbroken line of its roof, low-pitched\nfor France, above the cottages and willow-shaded streams of the\nplace, you might think the abbey church of Pontigny, the largest\nCistercian church now remaining, only a great farm-building.  On a\nnearer view there is something unpretending, something pleasantly\nEnglish, in the plain grey walls, pierced with long “lancet” windows,\nas if they overlooked the lowlands of Essex, or the meadows of Kent\nor Berkshire, the sort of country from which came those saintly\nexiles of our race who made the cloisters of Pontigny famous, and one\nof whom, Saint Edmund of Abingdon, Saint-Edme, still lies enshrined\nhere.  The country which the sons of Saint Bernard choose for their\nabode is in fact but a patch of scanty pasture-land in the midst of a\nheady wine-district.  Like its majestic Cluniac rivals, the church\nhas its western portico, elegant in structure but of comparatively\nhumble [127] proportions, under a plain roof of tiles, pent-wise.\nWithin, a heavy coat of white-wash seems befitting to the simple\nforms of the “Transition,” or quite earliest “Pointed,\" style, to its\nremarkable continence of spirit, its uniformity, and cleanness of\nbuild.  The long prospect of nave and choir ends, however, with a\nsort of graceful smallness, in a chevet of seven closely packed,\nnarrow bays.  It is like a nun’s church, or like a nun’s coif.",
        "The church of Pontigny, representative generally of the churches of\nthe Cistercian order, including some of the loveliest early English\nones, was in truth significant of a reaction, a reaction against\nmonasticism itself, as it had come to be in the order of Cluny, the\ngenius of which found its proper expression in the imperious, but\nhalf-barbaric, splendours of the richest form of the Romanesque, the\nmonastic style pre-eminently, as we may still see it at La Charite-\nsur-Loire, at Saint-Benoit, above all, on the hill of Vezelay.  Saint\nBernard, who had lent his immense influence to the order of Citeaux\nby way of a monastic reform, though he had a genius for hymns and was\nin other ways an eminent religious poet, and though he gave new life\nto the expiring romance of the crusades, was, as regards the visible\nworld, much of a Puritan.  Was it he who, wrapt in thought upon the\nworld unseen, walked along the shores of Lake Leman without observing\nit?–the eternal snows he might have taken for the walls of the New\nJerusalem; the blue waves he [128] might have fancied its pavement of\nsapphire.  In the churches, the worship, of his new order he required\nsimplicity, and even severity, being fortunate in finding so winsome\nan exponent of that principle as the early Gothic of Pontigny, or of\nthe first Cistercian church, now destroyed, at Citeaux itself.\nStrangely enough, while Bernard’s own temper of mind was a survival\nfrom the past (we see this in his contest with Abelard), hierarchic,\nreactionary, suspicious of novelty, the architectural style of his\npreference was largely of secular origin.  It had a large share in\nthat inventive and innovating genius, that expansion of the natural\nhuman soul, to which the art, the literature, the religious movements\nof the thirteenth century in France, as in Italy, where it ends with\nDante, bear witness.",
        "In particular, Bernard had protested against the sculpture, rich and\nfantastic, but gloomy, it might be indecent, developed more\nabundantly than anywhere else in the churches of Burgundy, and\nespecially in those of the Cluniac order.  “What is the use,” he\nasks, “of those grotesque monsters in painting and sculpture?” and\nalmost certainly he had in mind the marvellous carved work at\nVezelay, whither doubtless he came often–for example on Good Friday,\n1146, to preach, as we know, the second crusade in the presence of\nLouis the Seventh.  He too might have wept at the sight of the doomed\nmultitude (one in ten, it is said, returned from the Holy [129]\nLand), as its enthusiasm, under the charm of his fiery eloquence,\nrose to the height of his purpose.  Even the aisles of Vezelay were\nnot sufficient for the multitude of his hearers, and he preached to\nthem in the open air, from a rock still pointed out on the hillside.\nArmies indeed have been encamped many times on the slopes and meadows\nof the valley of the Cure, now to all seeming so impregnably\ntranquil.  The Cluniac order even then had already declined from its\nfirst intention; and that decline became especially visible in the\nAbbey of Vezelay itself not long after Bernard’s day.  Its majestic\nimmoveable church was complete by the middle of the twelfth century.\nAnd there it still stands in spite of many a threat, while the\nconventual buildings around it have disappeared; and the institution\nit represented–secularised at its own request at the Reformation–\nhad dwindled almost to nothing at all, till in the last century the\nlast Abbot built himself, in place of the old Gothic lodging below\nthose solemn walls, a sort of Chateau Gaillard, a dainty abode in the\nmanner of Louis Quinze–swept away that too at the Revolution–where\nthe great oaks now flourish, with the rooks and squirrels.",
        "Yet the order of Cluny, in its time, in that dark period of the\neleventh and twelfth centuries, had deserved well of those to whom\nreligion, and art, and social order are precious.  The Cluniacs had\nin fact represented monasticism in the most [130] legitimate form of\nits activity; and, if the church of Vezelay was not quite the\ngrandest of their churches, it is certainly the grandest of them\nwhich remains.  It is also typical in character.  As Notre-Dame\nd’Amiens is pre-eminently the church of the city, of a commune, so\nthe Madeleine of Vezelay is typically the church of a monastery.",
        "The monastic style proper, then, in its peculiar power and influence,\nwas Romanesque, and with the Cluniac order; and here perhaps better\nthan anywhere else we may understand what it really came to, what was\nits effect on the spirits, the imagination.",
        "As at Pontigny, the Cistercians, for the most part, built their\nchurches in lowly valleys, according to the intention of their\nfounder.  The representative church of the Cluniacs, on the other\nhand, lies amid the closely piled houses of the little town, which it\nprotected and could punish, on a steep hill-top, like a long massive\nchest there, heavy above you, as you climb slowly the winding road,\nthe old unchanged pathway of Saint Bernard.  In days gone by it\nthreatened the surrounding neighbourhood with four boldly built\ntowers; had then also a spire at the crossing; and must have been at\nthat time like a more magnificent version of the buildings which\nstill crown the hill of Laon.  Externally, the proportions, the\nsquareness, of the nave (west and east, the vast narthex or porch,\nand the [131] Gothic choir, rise above its roof-line), remind one of\nanother great Romanesque church at home–of the nave of Winchester,\nout of which Wykeham carved his richly panelled Perpendicular\ninterior.",
        "At Vezelay however, the Romanesque, the Romanesque of Burgundy, alike\nin the first conception of the whole structure, and in the actual\nlocking together of its big stones, its masses of almost unbroken\nmasonry, its inertia, figures as of more imperial character, and\nnearer to the Romans of old, than its feebler kindred in England or\nNormandy.  We seem to have before us here a Romanesque architecture,\nstudied, not from Roman basilicas or Roman temples, but from the\narenas, the colossal gateways, the triumphal arches, of the people of\nempire, such as remain even now, not in the South of France only.\nThe simple “flying,” or rather leaning and almost couchant,\nbuttresses, quadrants of a circle, might be parts of a Roman\naqueduct.  In contrast to the lightsome Gothic manner of the last\nquarter of the twelfth century (as we shall presently find it here\ntoo, like an escape for the eye, for the temper, out of some grim\nunderworld into genial daylight), the Cluniac church might seem a\nstill active instrument of the iron tyranny of Rome, of its tyranny\nover the animal spirits.  As the ghost of ancient Rome still lingers\n\"over the grave thereof,” in the papacy, the hierarchy, so is it with\nthe material structures [132] also, the Cluniac and other Romanesque\nchurches, which most emphatically express the hierarchical, the papal\nsystem.  There is something about this church of Vezelay, in the\nlong-sustained patience of which it tells, that brings to mind the\nlabour of slaves, whose occasional Fescennine licence and fresh\nmemories of a barbaric life also find expression, now and again, in\nthe strange sculpture of the place.  Yet here for once, around a\ngreat French church, there is the kindly repose of English\n\"precincts,” and the country which this monastic acropolis overlooks\nsouthwards is a very pleasant one, as we emerge from the shadows of–\nyes! of that peculiarly sad place–a country all the pleasanter by\nreason of the toil upon it, performed, or exacted from others, by the\nmonks, through long centuries; Le Morvan, with its distant blue hills\nand broken foreground, the vineyards, the patches of woodland, the\nroads winding into their cool shadows; though in truth the fortress-\nlike outline of the monastic church and the sombre hue of its\nmaterial lend themselves most readily to the effects of a stormy sky.",
        "By a door, which in the great days opened from a magnificent\ncloister, you enter what might seem itself but the ambulatory of a\ncloister, superbly vaulted and long and regular, and built of huge\nstones of a metallic colour.  It is the southern aisle of the nave, a\nnave of ten bays, the grandest Romanesque interior in France, [133]\nperhaps in the world.  In its mortified light the very soul of\nmonasticism, Roman and half-military, as the completest outcome of a\nreligion of threats, seems to descend upon one.  Monasticism is\nindeed the product of many various tendencies of the religious soul,\none or another of which may very properly connect itself with the\nPointed style, as we saw in those lightsome aisles of Pontigny, so\nexpressive of the purity, the lowly sweetness, of the soul of\nBernard.  But it is here at Vezelay, in this iron place, that\nmonasticism in its central, its historically most significant\npurpose, presents itself as most completely at home.  There is no\ntriforium.  The monotonous cloistral length of wall above the long-\ndrawn series of stately round arches, is unbroken save by a plain\nsmall window in each bay, placed as high as possible just below the\ncornice, as a mere after-thought, you might fancy.  Those windows\nwere probably unglazed, and closed only with wooden shutters as\noccasion required.  Furnished with the stained glass of the period,\nthey would have left the place almost in darkness, giving doubtless\nfull effect to the monkish candle-light in any case needful here.  An\nalmost perfect cradle-roof, tunnel-like from end to end of the long\ncentral aisle, adds by its simplicity of form to the magnificent\nunity of effect.  The bearing-arches, which span it from bay to bay,\nbeing parti-coloured, with voussures of alternate white and a kind of\ngrey or green, [134] being also somewhat flat at the keystone, and\nliterally eccentric, have, at least for English eyes, something of a\nSaracenic or other Oriental character.  Again, it is as if the\narchitects–the engineers–who worked here, had seen things undreamt\nof by other Romanesque builders, the builders in England and\nNormandy.",
        "Here then, scarcely relieving the almost savage character of the\nwork, abundant on tympanum and doorway without, above all on the\nimmense capitals of the nave within, is the sculpture which offended\nBernard.  A sumptuous band of it, a carved guipure of singular\nboldness, passes continuously round the arches, and along the\ncornices from bay to bay, and with the large bossy tendency of the\nornament throughout may be regarded as typical of Burgundian\nrichness.  Of sculptured capitals, to like, or to dislike with Saint\nBernard, there are nearly a hundred, unwearied in variety, unique in\nthe energy of their conception, full of wild promise in their coarse\nexecution, cruel, you might say, in the realisation of human form and\nfeatures.  Irresistibly they rivet attention.",
        "The subjects are for the most part Scriptural, chosen apparently as\nbeing apt for strongly satiric treatment, the suicide of Judas, the\nfall of Goliath.  The legend of Saint Benedict, naturally at home in\na Benedictine church, presented the sculptor with a series of\nforcible grotesques ready-made.  Some monkish story, [135] half\nmoral, half facetious, perhaps a little coarse, like that of Sainte\nEugenie, from time to time makes variety; or an example of the\npunishment of the wicked by men or by devils, who play a large, and\nto themselves thoroughly enjoyable and merry, part here.  The\nsculptor would seem to have witnessed the punishment of the\nblasphemer; how adroitly the executioner planted knee on the\nculprit’s bosom, as he lay on the ground, and out came the sinful\ntongue, to meet the iron pincers.  The minds of those who worked thus\nseem to have been almost insanely preoccupied just then with the\nhuman countenance, but by no means exclusively in its pleasantness or\ndignity.  Bold, crude, original, their work indicates delight in the\npower of reproducing fact, curiosity in it, but little or no sense of\nbeauty.  The humanity therefore here presented, as in the Cluniac\nsculpture generally, is wholly unconventional.  M. Viollet-le-Duc\nthinks he can trace in it individual types still actually existing in\nthe peasantry of Le Morvan.  Man and morality, however, disappearing\nat intervals, the acanthine capitals have a kind of later Venetian\nbeauty about them, as the Venetian birds also, the conventional\npeacocks, or birds wholly of fantasy, amid the long fantastic\nfoliage.  There are still however no true flowers of the field here.\nThere is pity, it must be confessed, on the other hand, and the\ndelicacy, the beauty, which that always brings [136] with it, where\nJephtha peeps at the dead daughter’s face, lifting timidly the great\nleaves that cover it; in the hanging body of Absalom; in the child\ncarried away by the eagle, his long frock twisted in the wind as he\ngoes.  The parents run out in dismay, and the devil grins, not\nbecause it is the punishment of the child or of them; but because he\nis the author of all mischief everywhere, as the monkish carver\nconceived–so far wholesomely.",
        "We must remember that any sculpture less emphatic would have been\nineffective, because practically invisible, in this sombre place.\nBut at the west end there is an escape for the eye, for the soul,\ntowards the unhindered, natural, afternoon sun; not however into the\nouter and open air, but through an arcade of three bold round arches,\nhigh above the great closed western doors, into a somewhat broader\nand loftier place than this, a reservoir of light, a veritable camera\nlucida.  The light is that which lies below the vault and within the\ntribunes of the famous narthex (as they say), the vast fore-church or\nvestibule, into which the nave is prolonged.  A remarkable feature of\nmany Cluniac churches, the great western porch, on a scale which is\napproached in England only at Peterborough, is found also in some of\nthe churches of the Cistercians.  It is characteristic, in fact,\nrather of Burgundy than of either of those religious orders\nespecially.",
        "[137] At Pontigny itself, for instance, there is a good one; and a\nvery early one at Paray-le-Monial.  Saint-Pere-sous-Vezelay, daughter\nof the great church, in the vale below, has a late Gothic example;\nSemur also, with fantastic lodges above it.  The cathedral of Autun,\na secular church in rivalry of the “religious,” presents, by way of\nsuch western porch or vestibule, two entire bays of the nave,\nunglazed, with the vast western arch open to the air; the west front,\nwith its rich portals, being thrown back into the depths of the great\nfore-church thus produced.",
        "The narthex of Vezelay, the largest of these singular structures, is\nglazed, and closed towards the west by what is now the facade.  It is\nitself in fact a great church, a nave of three magnificent bays, and\nof three aisles, with a spacious triforium.  With their fantastic\nsculpture, sheltered thus from accident and weather, in all its\noriginal freshness, the great portals of the primitive facade serve\nnow for doorways, as a second, solemn, door of entrance, to the\nchurch proper within.  The very structure of the place, and its\nrelation to the main edifice, indicate that it was for use on\noccasion, when, at certain great feasts, that of the Magdalen\nespecially, to whom the church of Vezelay is dedicated, the monastery\nwas swollen with pilgrims, too poor, too numerous, to be lodged in\nthe town, come hither to worship before the [138] relics of the\nfriend of Jesus, enshrined in a low-vaulted crypt, the floor of which\nis the natural rocky surface of the hill-top.  It may be that the\npilgrims were permitted to lie for the night, not only on the\npavement, but (if so favoured) in the high and dry chamber formed by\nthe spacious triforium over the north aisle, awaiting an early Mass.\nThe primitive west front, then, had become but a wall of partition;\nand above its central portal, where the round arched west windows had\nbeen, ran now a kind of broad, arcaded tribune, in full view of the\nentire length of the church.  In the midst of it stood an altar; and\nhere perhaps, the priest who officiated being visible to the whole\nassembled multitude east and west, the early Mass was said.",
        "The great vestibule was finished about forty years after the\ncompletion of the nave, towards the middle of the twelfth century.\nAnd here, in the great pier-arches, and in the eastern bay of the\nvault, still with the large masonry, the large, flat, unmoulded\nsurfaces, and amid the fantastic carvings of the Romanesque building\nabout it, the Pointed style, determined yet discreet, makes itself\nfelt–makes itself felt by appearing, if not for the first time, yet\nfor the first time in the organic or systematic development of French\narchitecture.  Not in the unambitious facade of Saint-Denis, nor in\nthe austere aisles of Sens, but at Vezelay, in this grandiose fabric,\nso worthy of the event, Viollet-le-Duc would [139] fain see the\nbirthplace of the Pointed style.  Here at last, with no sense of\ncontrast, but by way of veritable “transition,” and as if by its own\nmatured strength, the round arch breaks into the double curve, les\narcs brises, with a wonderful access of grace.  And the imaginative\neffect is forthwith enlarged.  Beyond, far beyond, what is actually\npresented to the eye in that peculiar curvature, its mysterious\ngrace, and by the stateliness, the elevation of the ogival method of\nvaulting, the imagination is stirred to present one with what belongs\nproperly to it alone.  The masonry, though large, is nicely fitted; a\nlarge light is admitted through the now fully pronounced Gothic\nwindows towards the west.  At Amiens we found the Gothic spirit,\nreigning there exclusively, to be a restless one.  At Vezelay, where\nit breathes for the first time amid the heavy masses of the old\nimperial style, it breathes the very genius of monastic repose.  And\nthen, whereas at Amiens, and still more at Beauvais, at Saint-\nQuentin, you wonder how these monuments of the past can have endured\nso long, in strictly monastic Vezelay you have a sense of freshness,\nsuch as, in spite of their ruin, we perceive in the buildings of\nGreece.  We enjoy here not so much, as at Amiens, the sentiment of\nantiquity, but that of eternal duration.",
        "But let me place you once more where we stood for a while, on\nentering by the doorway [140] in the midst of the long southern\naisle.  Cross the aisle, and gather now in one view the perspective\nof the whole.  Away on the left hand the eye is drawn upward to the\ntranquil light of the vaults of the fore-church, seeming doubtless\nthe more spacious because partly concealed from us by the wall of\npartition below.  But on the right hand, towards the east, as if with\nthe set purpose of a striking architectural contrast, an instruction\nas to the place of this or that manner in the architectural series,\nthe long, tunnel-like, military work of the Romanesque nave opens\nwide into the exhilarating daylight of choir and transepts, in the\nsort of Gothic Bernard would have welcomed, with a vault rising now\nhigh above the roof-line of the body of the church, sicut lilium\nexcelsum.  The simple flowers, the flora, of the early Pointed style,\nwhich could never have looked at home as an element in the half-\nsavage decoration of the nave, seem to be growing here upon the\nsheaves of slender, reedy pillars, as if naturally in the carved\nstone.  Even here indeed, Roman, or Romanesque, taste still lingers\nproudly in the monolith columns of the chevet.  Externally, we may\nnote with what dexterity the Gothic choir has been inserted into its\nplace, below and within the great buttresses of the earlier\nRomanesque one.",
        "Visitors to the great church of Assisi have sometimes found a kind of\nparable in the threefold [141] ascent from the dark crypt where the\nbody of Saint Francis lies, through the gloomy “lower” church, into\nthe height and breadth, the physical and symbolic “illumination,” of\nthe church above.  At Vezelay that kind of contrast suggests itself\nin one view; the hopeful, but transitory, glory upon which one\nenters; the long, darksome, central avenue; the “open vision” into\nwhich it conducts us.  As a symbol of resurrection, its choir is a\nfitting diadem to the church of the Magdalen, whose remains the monks\nmeant it to cover.",
        "And yet, after all, notwithstanding this assertion of the superiority\n(are we so to call it?) of the new Gothic way, perhaps by the very\nforce of contrast, the Madeleine of Vezelay is still pre-eminently a\nRomanesque, and thereby the typically monastic, church.  In spite of\nrestoration even, as we linger here, the impression of the monastic\nMiddle Age, of a very exclusive monasticism, that has verily turned\nits back upon common life, jealously closed inward upon itself, is a\nsingularly weighty one; the more so because, as the peasant said when\nasked the way to an old sanctuary that had fallen to the occupation\nof farm-labourers, and was now deserted even by them: Maintenant il\nn’y a personne la.",

        "[142] “CONSECUTIVE upon Apollo in all his solar fervour and\neffulgence,” says a writer of Teutonic proclivities, “we may discern\neven among the Greeks themselves, elusively, as would be natural with\nsuch a being, almost like a mock sun amid the mists, the northern or\nultra-northern sun-god.  In hints and fragments the lexicographers\nand others have told us something of this Hyperborean Apollo, fancies\nabout him which evidence some knowledge of the Land of the Midnight\nSun, of the sun’s ways among the Laplanders, of a hoary summer\nbreathing very softly on the violet beds, or say, the London-pride\nand crab-apples, provided for those meagre people, somewhere amid the\nremoteness of their icy seas.  In such wise Apollo had already\nanticipated his sad fortunes in the Middle Age as a god definitely in\nexile, driven north of the Alps, and even here ever in flight before\nthe summer.  Summer indeed he leaves now to the management of [143]\nothers, finding his way from France and Germany to still paler\ncountries, yet making or taking with him always a certain seductive\nsummer-in-winter, though also with a divine or titanic regret, a\ntitanic revolt in his heart, and consequent inversion at times of his\nold beneficent and properly solar doings.  For his favours, his\nfallacious good-humour, which has in truth a touch of malign magic\nabout it, he makes men pay sometimes a terrible price, and is in fact\na devil!”",
        "Devilry, devil’s work:–traces of such you might fancy were to be\nfound in a certain manuscript volume taken from an old monastic\nlibrary in France at the Revolution.  It presented a strange example\nof a cold and very reasonable spirit disturbed suddenly, thrown off\nits balance, as by a violent beam, a blaze of new light, revealing,\nas it glanced here and there, a hundred truths unguessed at before,\nyet a curse, as it turned out, to its receiver, in dividing\nhopelessly against itself the well-ordered kingdom of his thought.\nTwelfth volume of a dry enough treatise on mathematics, applied,\nstill with no relaxation of strict method, to astronomy and music, it\nshould have concluded that work, and therewith the second period of\nthe life of its author, by drawing tight together the threads of a\nlong and intricate argument.  In effect however, it began, or, in\nperturbed manner, and as [144] with throes of childbirth, seemed the\npreparation for, an argument of an entirely new and disparate\nspecies, such as would demand a new period of life also, if it might\nbe, for its due expansion.",
        "But with what confusion, what baffling inequalities!  How afflicting\nto the mind’s eye!  It was a veritable “solar storm\"–this\nillumination, which had burst at the last moment upon the strenuous,\nself-possessed, much-honoured monastic student, as he sat down\npeacefully to write the last formal chapters of his work ere he\nbetook himself to its well-earned practical reward as superior, with\nlordship and mitre and ring, of the abbey whose music and calendar\nhis mathematical knowledge had qualified him to reform.  The very\nshape of Volume Twelve, pieced together of quite irregularly formed\npages, was a solecism.  It could never be bound.  In truth, the man\nhimself, and what passed with him in one particular space of time,\nhad invaded a matter, which is nothing if not entirely abstract and\nimpersonal.  Indirectly the volume was the record of an episode, an\ninterlude, an interpolated page of life.  And whereas in the earlier\nvolumes you found by way of illustration no more than the simplest\nindispensable diagrams, the scribe’s hand had strayed here into mazy\nborders, long spaces of hieroglyph, and as it were veritable pictures\nof the theoretic elements of his subject.  Soft wintry auroras seemed\nto play behind whole pages of crabbed textual writing, line and\nfigure [145] bending, breathing, flaming, in, to lovely\n\"arrangements” that were like music made visible; till writing and\nwriter changed suddenly, “to one thing constant never,” after the\nknown manner of madmen in such work.  Finally, the whole matter broke\noff with an unfinished word, as a later hand testified, adding the\ndate of the author’s death, “deliquio animi.”",
        "He had been brought to the monastery as a little child; was bred\nthere; had never yet left it, busy and satisfied through youth and\nearly manhood; was grown almost as necessary a part of the community\nas the stones of its material abode, as a pillar of the great tower\nhe ascended to watch the movement of the stars.  The structure of a\nfortified medieval town barred in those who belonged to it very\neffectively.  High monastic walls intrenched the monk still further.\nFrom the summit of the tower you looked straight down into the deep\nnarrow streets, upon the houses (in one of which Prior Saint-Jean was\nborn) climbing as high as they dared for breathing space within that\nnarrow compass.  But you saw also the green breadth of Normandy and\nPicardy, this way and that; felt on your face the free air of a still\nwider realm beyond what was seen.  The reviving scent of it, the mere\nsight of the flowers brought thence, of the country produce at the\nconvent gate, stirred the ordinary monkish soul with desires,\nsometimes with efforts, to be sent on duty there.  Prior [146] Saint-\nJean, on the other hand, shuddered at the view, at the thoughts it\nsuggested to him; thoughts of unhallowed wild places, where the old\nheathen had worshipped “stocks and stones,” and where their\nwickedness might still survive them in something worse than\nmischievous tricks of nature, such as you might read of in Ovid,\nwhose verses, however, he for his part had never so much as touched\nwith a finger.  He gave thanks rather, that his vocation to the\nabstract sciences had kept him far apart from the whole crew of\nmiscreant poets–Abode of demons.",
        "Thither nevertheless he was now to depart, sent to the Grange or\nObedience of Notre-Dame De-Pratis by the aged Abbot (about to resign\nin his favour) for the benefit of his body’s health, a little\nimpaired at last by long intellectual effort, yet so invaluable to\nthe community.  But let him beware! whispered his dearest friend, who\nshared those strange misgivings, let him “take heed to his ways” when\nhe was come to that place.  “The mere contact of one’s feet with its\nsoil might change one.”  And that same night, disturbed perhaps by\nthoughts of the coming journey with which his brain was full, Prior\nSaint-Jean himself dreamed vividly, as he had been little used to do.\nHe saw the very place in which he lay (he knew it! his little inner\ncell, the brown doors, the white breadth of wall, the black crucifix\nupon it) alight, alight [147] softly; and looking, as he fancied,\nfrom the window, saw also a low circlet of soundless flame, waving,\nlicking daintily up the black sky, but harmless, beautiful, closing\nin upon that round dark space in the midst, which was the earth.  He\nseemed to feel upon his shoulder just then the touch of his friend\nbeside him.  “It is hell-fire!” he said.",
        "The Prior took with him a very youthful though devoted companion–\nHyacinthus, the pet of the community.  They laughed admiringly at the\nrebellious masses of his black hair, with blue in the depths of it,\nlike the wings of the swallow, which refused to conform to the\nmonkish pattern.  It only grew twofold, crown upon crown, after the\nhalf-yearly shaving.  And he was as neat and serviceable as he was\ndelightful to be with.  Prior Saint-Jean, then, and the boy started\nbefore daybreak for the long journey; onwards, till darkness, a soft\ntwilight rather, was around them again.  How unlike a winter night it\nseemed, the further they went through the endless, lonely, turf-grown\ntracts, and along the edge of a valley, at length–vallis monachorum,\nmonksvale–taken aback by its sudden steepness and depth, as of an\nimmense oval cup sunken in the grassy upland, over which a golden\nmoon now shone broadly.  Ah! there it was at last, the white Grange,\nthe white gable of the chapel apart amid a few scattered white\ngravestones, the white flocks crouched about on the hoar-frost, [148]\nlike the white clouds, packed somewhat heavily on the horizon, and\nnacres as the clouds of June, with their own light and heat in them,\nin their hollows, you might fancy.",
        "From the very first, the atmosphere, the light, the influence of\nthings, seemed different from what they knew; and how distant already\nthe dark buildings of their home!  Was there the breath of surviving\nsummer blossom on the air?  Now and then came a gentle, comfortable\nbleating from the folds, and themselves slept soundly at last in the\ngreat open upper chamber of the Grange; were awakened by the sound of\nthunder.  Strange, in the late November night!  It had parted,\nhowever, with its torrid fierceness; modulated by distance, seemed to\nbreak away into musical notes.  And the lightning lingered along with\nit, but glancing softly; was in truth an aurora, such as persisted\nmonth after month on the northern sky as they sojourned here.  Like\nProspero’s enchanted island, the whole place was “full of noises.\"\nThe wind it might have been, passing over metallic strings, but that\nthey were audible even when the night was breathless.",
        "So like veritable music, however, were they on that first night that,\nupon reflexion, the Prior climbed softly the winding stair down which\nthey appeared to flow, to the great solar among the beams of the\nroof, where the farm produce lay stored.  A flood of moonlight now\nfell through the unshuttered dormer-windows; and, [149] under the\nglow of a lamp hanging from the low rafters, Prior Saint-Jean seemed\nto be looking for the first time on the human form, on the old Adam\nfresh from his Maker’s hand.  A servant of the house, or farm-\nlabourer, perhaps!–fallen asleep there by chance on the fleeces\nheaped like golden stuff high in all the corners of the place.  A\nserf!  But what unserflike ease, how lordly, or godlike rather, in\nthe posture!  Could one fancy a single curve bettered in the rich,\nwarm, white limbs; in the haughty features of the face, with the\ngolden hair, tied in a mystic knot, fallen down across the inspired\nbrow?  And yet what gentle sweetness also in the natural movement of\nthe bosom, the throat, the lips, of the sleeper!  Could that be\ndiabolical, and really spotted with unseen evil, which was so\nspotless to the eye?  The rude sandals of the monastic serf lay\nbeside him apart, and all around was of the roughest, excepting only\ntwo strange objects lying within reach (even in their own renowned\ntreasury Prior Saint-Jean had not seen the like of them), a harp, or\nsome such instrument, of silver-gilt once, but the gold had mostly\npassed from it, and a bow, fashioned somehow of the same precious\nsubstance.  The very form of these things filled his mind with\ninexplicable misgivings.  He repeated a befitting collect, and trod\nsoftly away.",
        "It was in truth but a rude place to which they were come.  But, after\nlife in the [150] monastery, the severe discipline of which the Prior\nhimself had done much to restore, there was luxury in the free, self-\nchosen hours, the irregular fare, in doing pretty much as one\npleased, in the sweet novelties of the country; to the boy Hyacinth\nespecially, who forgot himself, or rather found his true self for the\nfirst time.  Girding up his heavy frock, which he laid aside erelong\naltogether to go in his coarse linen smock only, he seemed a monastic\nnovice no longer; yet, in his natural gladness, was found more\ncompanionable than ever by his senior, surprised, delighted, for his\npart, at the fresh springing of his brain, the spring of his\nfootsteps over the close greensward, as if smoothed by the art of\nman.  Cause of his renewed health, or concurrent with its effects,\nthe air here might have been that of a veritable paradise, still\nunspoiled.  “Could there be unnatural magic,” he asked himself again,\n\"any secret evil, lurking in these tranquil vale-sides, in their\nsweet low pastures, in the belt of scattered woodland above them, in\nthe rills of pure water which lisped from the open down beyond?\"\nMaking what was really a boy’s experience, he had a wholly boyish\ndelight in his holiday, and certainly did not reflect how much we\nbeget for ourselves in what we see and feel, nor how far a certain\ndiffused music in the very breath of the place was the creation of\nhis own ear or brain.",
        "[151] That strange enigmatic owner of the harp and the bow, whom he\nhad found sleeping so divinely, actually waited on them the next\nmorning with all obsequiousness, stirred the great fire of peat,\nadjusted duly their monkish attire, laid their meal.  It seemed an\nodd thing to be served thus, like St. Jerome by the lion, as if by\nsome imperiously beautiful wild animal tamed.  You hesitated to\npermit, were a little afraid of, his services.  Their silent tonsured\nporter himself, contrast grim enough to any creature of that kind,\nhad been so far seduced as to permit him to sleep there in the\nGrange, as he loved to do, instead of in ruder, rougher quarters;\nand, coaxed into odd garrulity on this one matter, told the new-\ncomers the little he knew, with much also that he only suspected,\nabout him; among other things, as to the origin of those precious\nobjects, which might have belonged to some sanctuary or noble house,\nfound thus in the possession of a mere labourer, who is no Frenchman,\nbut a pagan, or gipsy, white as he looks, from far south or east, and\nwho works or plays furtively, by night for the most part, returning\nto sleep awhile before daybreak.  The other herdsmen of the valley\nare bond-servants, but he a hireling at will, though coming regularly\nat a certain season.  He has come thus for any number of years past,\nthough seemingly never grown older (as the speaker reflects), singing\nhis way meagrely from farm to farm, to the sound of [152] his harp.\nHis name?–It was scarcely a name at all, in the diffident syllables\nhe uttered in answer to that question, on first coming there; but of\nnames known to them it came nearest to a malignant one in Scripture,\nApollyon.  Apollyon had a just discernible tonsure, but probably no\nright to it.",
        "Well skilled in architecture, Prior Saint-Jean was set, by way of a\nholiday task, to superintend the completion of the great monastic\nbarn then in building.  The visitor admires it still; perhaps\nsupposes it, with its noble aisle, though set north and south, to be\na desecrated church.  If he be an expert in such matters, he will\nremark a sort of classical harmony in its broad, very simple\nproportions, with a certain suppression of Gothic emphasis, more\nespecially in that peculiarly Gothic feature, the buttresses,\nscarcely marking the unbroken, windowless walls, which rise very\nstraight, taking the sun placidly.  The silver-grey stone, cut, if it\ncame from this neighbourhood at all, from some now forgotten quarry,\nhas the fine, close-grained texture of antique marble.  The great\nnorthern gable is almost a classic pediment.  The horizontal lines of\nplinth and ridge and cornice are kept unbroken, the roof of sea-grey\nslates being pitched less angularly than is usual in this rainy\nclime.  A welcome contrast, the Prior thought it, to the sort of\narchitectural nightmare he came from.  He found the structure already\nmore than half- [153] way up, the low squat pillars ready for their\ncapitals.",
        "Yes! it must have so happened often in the Middle Age, as you feel\nconvinced, in looking sometimes at medieval building.  Style must\nhave changed under the very hands of men who were no wilful\ninnovators.  Thus it was here, in the later work of Prior Saint-Jean,\nall unconsciously.  The mysterious harper sat there always, at the\ntopmost point achieved; played, idly enough it might seem, on his\nprecious instrument, but kept in fact the hard taxed workmen\nliterally in tune, working for once with a ready will, and, so to\nspeak, with really inventive hands–working expeditiously, in this\nfavourable weather, till far into the night, as they joined unbidden\nin a chorus, which hushed, or rather turned to music, the noise of\ntheir chipping.  It was hardly noise at all, even in the night-time.\nNow and again Brother Apollyon descended nimbly to surprise them, at\nan opportune moment, by the display of an immense strength.  A great\ncheer exploded suddenly, as single-handed he heaved a massive stone\ninto its place.  He seemed to have no sense of weight: “Put there by\nthe devil!” the modern villager assures you.",
        "With a change then, not so much of style as of temper, of management,\nin the application of acknowledged rules, Prior Saint-Jean shaping\nonly, adapting, simplifying, partly with a view [154] to economy, not\nthe heavy stones only, but the heavy manner of using them, turned\nlight.  With no pronounced ornamentation, it is as if in the upper\nstory ponderous root and stem blossomed gracefully, blossomed in\ncornice and capital and pliant arch-line, as vigorous as they were\ngraceful, and rose on high quickly.  Almost suddenly tie-beam and\nrafter knit themselves together into the stone, and the dark, dry,\nroomy place was closed in securely to this day.  Mere audible music,\ncertainly, had counted for something in the operations of an art,\nheld at its best (as we know) to be a sort of music made visible.\nThat idle singer, one might fancy, by an art beyond art, had\nattracted beams and stones into their fit places.  And there, sure\nenough, he still sits, as a final decorative touch, by way of apex on\nthe gable which looks northward, though much weather-worn, and with\nan ugly gap between the shoulder and the fingers on the harp,* as if,\nliterally, he had cut off his right hand and put it from him:–King\nDavid, or an angel? guesses the careless tourist.  The space below\nhas been lettered.  After a little puzzling you recognise there the\nrelics of a familiar verse from a Latin psalm Nisi Dominus\naedificaverit domum,+ and the rest: inscribed as well as may be in\nGreek characters.  Prior Saint-Jean caused it to be so inscribed,\nabsurdly, during his last days there.",
        "[155] And is not the human body, too, a building, with architectural\nlaws, a structure, tending by the very forces which primarily held it\ntogether to drop asunder in time?  Not in vain, it seemed, had Prior\nSaint-Jean come to this mystic place for the improvement of his\nbody’s health.  Thenceforth that fleshly tabernacle had housed him,\nhad housed his cunning, overwrought and excitable soul, ever the\nbetter day by day, and he began to feel his bodily health to be a\npositive quality or force, the presence near him of that singular\nbeing having surely something to do with this result.  He and his\nfascinations, his music, himself, might at least be taken for an\nembodiment of all those genial influences of earth and sky, and the\neasy ways of living here, which made him turn, with less of an effort\nthan he had known for many years past, to his daily tasks, and sink\nso regularly, so immediately, to wholesome rest on returning from\nthem.  It was as if Brother Apollyon himself abhorred the spectacle\nof distress, and mainly for his own satisfaction charmed away other\npeople’s maladies.  The mere touch of that ice-cold hand, laid on the\nfeverish brow, when the Prior lapsed from time to time into his\nformer troubles, certainly calmed the respiration of a troubled\nsleeper.  Was there magic in it, not wholly natural?  The hand might\nhave been a dead one.  But then, was it surprising, after all, that\nthe [156] methods of curing men’s maladies, as being in very deed the\nfruit of sin, should have something strange and unlooked-for about\nthem, like some of those Old Testament healings and purifications\nwhich the Prior’s biblical lore suggested to him?  Yet Brother\nApollyon, if their surly Janitor, in his less kindly moments, spoke\ntruly, himself greatly needed purification, being not only a thief,\nbut a homicide in hiding from the law.  Nay, once, on his annual\nreturn from southern or eastern lands, he had been observed on his\nway along the streets of the great town literally scattering the\nseeds of disease till his serpent-skin bag was empty.  And within\nseven days the “black death” was there, reaping its thousands.  As a\nwise man declared, he who can best cure disease can also most\ncunningly engender it.",
        "In short, these creatures of rule, these “regulars,” the Prior and\nhis companion, were come in contact for the first time in their lives\nwith the power of untutored natural impulse, of natural inspiration.\nThe boy experienced it immediately in the games which suited his\nyears, but which he had never so much as seen before; as his superior\nwas to undergo its influence by-and-by in serious study.  By night\nchiefly, in its long, continuous twilights, Hyacinth became really a\nboy at last, with immense gaiety; eyes, hands and feet awake,\nexpanding, as he raced his comrade over the [157] turf, with the\nconical Druidic stone for a goal, or wrestled lithely enough with\nhim, though as with a rock; or, taking the silver bow in hand for a\nmoment, transfixed a mark, next a bird, on the bough, on the wing,\nshedding blood for the first time, with a boy’s delight, a boy’s\nremorse.  Friend Apollyon seemed able to draw the wild animals too,\nto share their sport, yet not altogether kindly.  Tired, surfeited,\nhe destroys them when his game with them is at an end; breaks the\ntoy; deftly snaps asunder the fragile back.  Though all alike would\ncome at his call, or the sound of his harp, he had his preferences;\nand warred in the night-time, as if on principle, against the\ncreatures of the day.  The small furry thing he pierced with his\narrow fled to him nevertheless caressingly, with broken limb, to die\npalpitating in his hand.  In this wonderful season, the migratory\nbirds, from Norway, from Britain beyond the seas, came there as usual\non the north wind, with sudden tumult of wings; but went that year no\nfurther, and by Christmas-time had built their nests, filling that\nbelt of woodland around the vale with the chatter of their business\nand love quarrels.  In turn they drew after them strangers no one\nhere had ever known before; the like of which Hyacinth, who knew his\nbestiary, had never seen even in a picture.  The wild-cat, the wild-\nswan–the boy peeped on these wonders as they floated over the vale,\nor [158] glided with unwonted confidence over its turf, under the\nmoonlight, or that frequent continuous aurora which was not the dawn.\nEven the modest rivulets of the hill-side felt that influence, and\n\"lisped” no longer, but babbled as they leapt, like mountain streams,\nexposing their rocky bed.  Were they angry, as they ran red sometimes\nwith blood-drops from the stricken bird caught there by rock or\nbough, as it fell with rent breast among the waves?",
        "But say, think, what you might against him, the pagan outlaw was\nworth his hire as a herdsman; seemingly loved his sheep; was an\n\"affectionate shepherd\"; cured their diseases; brought them easily to\nthe birth, and if they strayed afar would bring them back tenderly\nupon his shoulders.  Monastic persons would have seen that image many\ntimes before.  Yet if Apollyon looked like the great carved figure\nover the low doorway of their place of penitence at home, that could\nbe but an accident, or perhaps a deceit; so closely akin to those\nsoulless creatures did he still seem to the wondering Prior,–\nimmersed in, or actually a part of, that irredeemable natural world\nhe had dreaded so greatly ere he came hither.  And was he after all\nmaking terms with it now, in the seductive person of this mysterious\nbeing–man or demon–suspected of murder; who has an air of\nunfathomable evil about him as from a distant but ineffaceable past,\nand a sort of heathen [159] understanding with the dark realm of\nmatter; who is bringing the simple people, the women and lovesick\nlads, back to those caves and cromlechs and blasted trees, resorts of\nold godless secret-telling?  And still he has all his own way with\nbeasts and man, with the Prior himself, much as all alike distrust\nhim.",
        "Most conspicuous in the little group of buildings, a feudal tower of\ngoodly white stone, cylindrical and smoothly polished without to\nhinder the ascent of creeping things, and snugly plastered within to\nresist the damp, was the pigeon-house–a veritable feudal tower, a\nveritable feudal plaisance of birds, which the common people dared\nnot so much as ruffle.  About a thousand of them were housed there,\neach in its little chamber, encouraged to grow plump, and to breed,\nin perfect self-content.  From perch to perch of the great axle-tree\nin the centre, monastic feet might climb, gentle monastic hands pass\nround to every tiny compartment in turn.  The arms of the monastery\nwere carved on the keystone of the doorway, and the tower finished in\na conical roof, with becoming aerial gaillardise, with pretty dormer-\nwindows for the inmates to pass in and out, little balconies for\nbrooding in the sun, little awnings to protect them from rough\nbreezes, and a great weather-vane, on which the birds crowded for the\nchance of a ride.  If the peasants of that day, whose small fields\nthey plundered, noting all this, perhaps [160] envied the birds\ndumbly, for the brethren, on the other hand, it was a constant\ndelight to watch the feathered brotherhood, which supplied likewise\ntheir daintiest fare.  Who then, what hawk, or wild-cat, or other\nsavage beast, had ravaged it so wantonly, so very cruelly destroyed\nthe bright creatures in a single night–broken backs, rent away\nlimbs, pierced the wings?  And what was that object there below?  The\nsilver harp surely, lying broken likewise on the sanded floor,\nsoaking in the pale milky blood and torn plumage.",
        "Apollyon sobbed and wept audibly as he went about his ordinary doings\nnext day, for once fully, though very sadly, awake in it; and towards\nevening, when the villagers came to the Prior to confess themselves,\nthe Feast of the Nativity being now at hand, he too came along with\nthem in his place meekly, like any other penitent, touched the\nlustral water devoutly, knew all the ways, seemed to desire\nabsolution from some guilt of blood heavier than the slaughter of\nbeast or bird.  The Prior and his attendant, on their side, are\nreminded that by this time they have wellnigh forgotten the monastic\nduties still incumbent upon them, especially in that matter of the\n\"Offices.”  On the vigil of the feast, however, Brother Apollyon\nhimself summoned the devout to Midnight Mass with the great bell,\nwhich had hung silent for a generation, wedged in immoveably by a\nbeam of [161] the cradle fallen out of its place.  With an immense\neffort of strength he relieved it, hitched the bell back upon its\nwheel; the thick rust cracked on the hinges, and the strokes tolled\nforth betimes, with a hundred querulous, quaint creatures, bats and\nowls, circling stupidly in the waves of sound, but allowed to settle\nback again undisturbedly into their beds.",
        "People and priest, the Prior, vested as well as might be, with\nHyacinth as “server,” come in due course, all alike amazed to find\nthat frozen neglected place, with its low-browed vault and narrow\nwindows, alight, and as if warmed with flowers from a summer more\nradiant far than that of France, with ilex and laurel–gilt laurel–\nby way of holly and box.  Prior Saint-Jean felt that he had never\nreally seen flowers before.  Somewhat later they and the like of them\nseemed to have grown into and over his brain; to have degraded the\nscientific and abstract outlines of things into a tangle of useless\nornament.  Whence were they procured?  From what height, or hellish\ndepth perhaps?  Apollyon, who entered the chapel just then, as if\nquite naturally, though with a bleating lamb in his bosom (\"dropped\"\nthus early in that wonderful season) by way of an offering, took his\nplace at the altar’s very foot, and drawing forth his harp, now\nrestrung, at the right moment, turned to real silvery music the\nhoarse Gloria in Excelsis of those rude worshippers, still [162]\nshrinking from him, while they listened in a little circle, as he\nstood there in his outlandish attire of skins strangely spotted and\nstriped.  With that however the Mass broke off unconsummated.  The\nPrior felt obliged to desist from the sacred office, and had left the\naltar hurriedly.",
        "But Brother Apollyon put his strange attire aside next day, and in a\nmuch-worn monk’s frock, drawn forth from a dark corner, came with\nthem, still like a Penitent, when they turned once more to their\nneglected studies somewhat sadly.  See them then, after a collect for\n\"Light” repeated by Hyacinth, skull-cap in hand, seated at their\ndesks in the little scriptorium, panelled off from their living-room\non the first floor, while the Prior makes an effort to recover the\nlast thought of his long-suspended work, in the execution of which\nthe boy is to assist with his skilful pen.  The great glazed windows\nremain open; admit, as if already on the soft air of spring, what\nseems like a stream of flowery odours, the entire moonlit scene, with\nthe thorn bushes on the vale-side prematurely bursting into blossom,\nand the sound of birds and flocks emphasising the deep silence of the\nnight.",
        "Apollyon then, as if by habit, as he had shared all their occupations\nof late, had taken his seat beside them, meekly enough, at first with\nthe manner of a mere suppliant for the [163] crumbs of their high\nstudies.  But, straightway again, he surprises by more than racing\nforward incredibly on the road to facts, and from facts to luminous\ndoctrine; Prior Saint-Jean himself, in comparison, seeming to lag\nincompetently behind.  He can but wonder at this strange scholar’s\nknowledge of a distant past, evidenced in his familiarity (it was as\nif he might once have spoken them) with the dead languages in which\ntheir text-books are written.  There was more surely than the utmost\nmerely natural acuteness in his guesses as to the words intended by\nthose crabbed contractions, of their meaning, in his sense of\nallusions and the like.  An ineffaceable memory it might rather seem\nof the entire world of which those languages had been the living\nspeech, once more vividly awake under the Prior’s cross- questioning,\nand now more than supplementing his own laborious search.",
        "And at last something of the same kind happens with himself.  Had he,\non his way hither from the convent, passed unwittingly through some\nriver or rivulet of Lethe, that had carried away from him all his so\ncarefully accumulated intellectual baggage of fact and theory?  The\nhard and abstract laws, or theory of the laws, of music, of the\nstars, of mechanical structure, in hard and abstract formulae, adding\nto the abstract austerity of the man, seemed to have deserted him; to\nbe revived in him again [164] however, at the contact of this\nextraordinary pupil or fellow-inquirer, though in a very different\nguise or attitude towards himself, as matters no longer to be\nreasoned upon and understood, but to be seen rather, to be looked at\nand heard.  Did not he see the angle of the earth’s axis with the\necliptic, the deflexions of the stars from their proper orbits with\nfatal results here below, and the earth–wicked, unscriptural truth!-\n-moving round the sun, and those flashes of the eternal and unorbed\nlight such as bring water, flowers, living things, out of the rocks,\nthe dust?  The singing of the planets: he could hear it, and might in\ntime effect its notation.  Having seen and heard, he might erelong\nspeak also, truly and with authority, on such matters.  Could one but\narrest it for one’s self, for final transference to others, on the\nwritten or printed page–this beam of insight, or of inspiration!",
        "Alas! one result of its coming was that it encouraged delay.  If he\nset hand to the page, the firm halo, here a moment since, was gone,\nhad flitted capriciously to the wall; passed next through the window,\nto the wall of the garden; was dancing back in another moment upon\nthe innermost walls of one’s own miserable brain, to swell there–\nthat astounding white light!–rising steadily in the cup, the mental\nreceptacle, till it overflowed, and he lay faint and drowning in it.\nOr he rose above it, as above a great liquid surface, and hung\ngiddily over it–light, [165] simple, and absolute–ere he fell.  Or\nthere was a battle between light and darkness around him, with no way\nof escape from the baffling strokes, the lightning flashes; flashes\nof blindness one might rather call them.  In truth, the intuitions of\nthe night (for they worked still, or tried to work, by night) became\nthe sickly nightmares of the day, in which Prior Saint-Jean slept, or\ntried to sleep, or lay sometimes in a trance without food for many\nhours, from which he would spring up suddenly to crowd, against time,\nas much as he could into his book with pen or brush; winged flowers,\nor stars with human limbs and faces, still intruding themselves, or\nmere notes of light and darkness from the actual horizon.  There it\nall is still in the faded gold and colours of the ancient volume–\n\"Prior Saint-Jean’s folly”:–till on a sudden the hand collapses, as\nhe becomes aware of that real, prosaic, broad daylight lying harsh\nupon the page, making his delicately toned auroras seem but a patch\nof grey, and himself for a moment, with a sigh of disgust, of self-\nreproach, to be his old unimpassioned monastic self once more.",
        "The boy, for his part, was grown at last full of misgiving.  He\nponders how he may get the Prior away, or escape by himself, find his\nway back to the convent and report his master’s condition, his\nstrange loss of memory for names and the like, his illusions about\nhimself and [166] others.  And he is more than ever distrustful now\nof his late beloved playmate, who quietly obstructs any movement of\nthe kind, and has undertaken, at the Prior’s entreaty, to draw down\nthe moon from the sky, for some shameful price, known to the\nmagicians of that day.",
        "Yet Apollyon, at all events, would still play as gaily as ever on\noccasion.  Hitherto they had played as young animals do; without\nplaythings namely, applying hand or foot only to their games.  But it\nhappened about this time that a grave was dug, a grave of unusual\ndepth, to be ready, in that fiery plaguesome weather, the first heat\nof veritable summer come suddenly, for the body of an ancient\nvillager then at the point of death.  In the drowsy afternoon\nHyacinth awakes Apollyon, to see the strange thing he has found at\nthe grave-side, among the gravel and yellow bones cast up there.  He\nhad wrested it with difficulty from the hands of the half-crippled\ngravedigger, at eighty still excitable by the mere touch of metal.",
        "The like of it had indeed been found before, within living memory, in\nthis place of immemorial use as a graveyard–\"Devil’s penny-pieces\"\npeople called them.  Five such lay hidden already in a dark corner of\nthe chapel, to keep them from superstitious employment.  To-day they\ncame out of hiding at last.  Apollyon knew the use of the thing at a\nglance; had put an expert hand to it forthwith; poises the [167]\ndiscus; sets it wheeling.  How easily it spins round under one’s arm,\nin the groove of the bent fingers, slips thence smoothly like a knife\nflung from its sheath, as if for a course of perpetual motion!\nSplendescit eundo: it seems to burn as it goes.  It is heavier many\ntimes than it looks, and sharp-edged.  By night they have scoured and\npolished the corroded surfaces.  Apollyon promises Hyacinth and\nhimself rare sport in the cool of the evening–an evening however, as\nit turned out, not less breathless than the day.",
        "In the great heat Apollyon had flung aside, as if for ever, the last\nsorry remnant of his workman’s attire, and challenged the boy to do\nthe same.  On the moonlit turf there, crouching, right foot foremost,\nand with face turned backwards to the disk in his right hand, his\nwhole body, in that moment of rest, full of the circular motion he is\nabout to commit to it, he seemed–beautiful pale spectre–to shine\nfrom within with a light of his own, like that of the glow-worm in\nthe thicket, or the dead and rotten roots of the old trees.  And as\nif they had a proper motion of their own in them, the disks, the\nquoits, ran, amid the delighted shouts and laughter of the boy, as he\nfollows, scarcely less swift, to score the points of their contact\nwith the grass.  Again and again they recommence, forgetful of the\nhours; while the death-bell cries out harshly for the grave’s\noccupant, and [168] the corpse itself is borne along stealthily not\nfar from them, and, unnoticed by either, the entire aspect of things\nhas changed.  Under the overcast sky it is in darkness they are\nplaying, by guess and touch chiefly; and suddenly an icy blast of\nwind has lifted the roof from the old chapel, the trees are moaning\nin wild circular motion, and their devil’s penny-piece, when Apollyon\nthrows it for the last time, is itself but a twirling leaf in the\nwind, till it sinks edgewise, sawing through the boy’s face, uplifted\nin the dark to trace it, crushing in the tender skull upon the brain.",
        "His shout of laughter is turned in an instant to a cry of pain, of\nreproach; and in that which echoed it–an immense cry, as from the\nvery heart of ancient tragedy, over the Picard wolds–it was as if\nthat half-extinguished deity, its proper immensity, its old greatness\nand power, were restored for a moment.  The villagers in their beds\nwondered.  It was like the sound of some natural catastrophe.",
        "The storm which followed was still in possession, still moving\ntearfully among the poplar groves, though it had spent its heat and\nthunder.  The last drops of the blood of Hyacinth still trickled\nthrough the thick masses of dark hair, where the tonsure had been.\nAn abundant rain, mingling with the copious purple stream, had\ncoloured the grass all around where the corpse lay, stealing afar in\ntiny channels.",
        "[169] So it was, when Apollyon, reduced in the morning light to his\nsmaller self, came with the other people of the Grange to gaze, to\nenquire, and found the Prior already there, speechless.  Clearly this\nwas no lightning stroke; and Apollyon straightway conceives certain\nvery human fears that, coming upon those antecedent suspicions of\nhimself, the boy’s death may be thought the result of intention on\nhis part.  He proposes to bury the body at once, with no delay for\nreligious rites, in that still uncovered grave, the bearers having\nfled from it in the tempest.",
        "And next day, fulfilling his annual custom, he went his way\nnorthward, without a word of farewell to Prior Saint-Jean, whom he\nleaves in fact under suspicion of murder.  From the profound slumber\nwhich had followed the excitements of yesterday, the Prior awoke amid\nthe sound of voices, the voices of the peasants singing no Christian\nsong, certainly, but a song which Apollyon himself had taught them,\nto dismiss him on his journey.  For, strange or not as it might be,\nthey loved him, perhaps in spite of themselves; would certainly\nprotect him at any risk.  Prior Saint-Jean arose, and looked forth–\nwith wonder.  A brief spell of sunshine amid the rain had clothed the\nvale with a marvel of blue flowers, if it were not rather with\nremnants of the blue sky itself, fallen among the woods there.  But\nthere too, in the little courtyard, [170] the officers of justice\nare already in waiting to take him, on the charge of having caused\nthe death of his young server by violence, in a fit of mania, induced\nby dissolute living in that solitary place.  One hitherto so\nprosperous in life would, of course, have his enemies.",
        "The monastic authorities, however, claim him from the secular power,\nto correct his offence in their own way, and with friendly\ninterpretation of the facts.  Madness, however wicked, being still\nmadness, Prior, now simple Brother, Saint-Jean, is detained in a\nsufficiently cheerful apartment, in a region of the atmosphere likely\nto restore lost wits, whence indeed he can still see the country–\nvallis monachorum.  The one desire which from time to time fitfully\nrouses him again to animation for a few moments is to return thither.\nHere then he remains in peace, ostensibly for the completion of his\ngreat work.  He never again set pen to it, consistent and clear now\non nothing save that longing to be once more at the Grange, that he\nmay get well, or die and be well so.  He is like the damned spirit,\nthink some of the brethren, saying “I will return to the house whence\nI came out.”  Gazing thither daily for many hours, he would mistake\nmere blue distance, when that was visible, for blue flowers, for\nhyacinths, and wept at the sight; though blue, as he observed, was\nthe colour of Holy Mary’s gown on the illuminated page, the colour of\nhope, of merciful [171] omnipresent deity.  The necessary permission\ncame with difficulty, just too late.  Brother Saint-Jean died,\nstanding upright with an effort to gaze forth once more, amid the\npreparations for his departure.",

        "[172] As Florian Deleal walked, one hot afternoon, he overtook by the\nwayside a poor aged man, and, as he seemed weary with the road,\nhelped him on with the burden which he carried, a certain distance.\nAnd as the man told his story, it chanced that he named the place, a\nlittle place in the neighbourhood of a great city, where Florian had\npassed his earliest years, but which he had never since seen, and,\nthe story told, went forward on his journey comforted.  And that\nnight, like a reward for his pity, a dream of that place came to\nFlorian, a dream which did for him the office of the finer sort of\nmemory, bringing its object to mind with a great clearness, yet, as\nsometimes happens in dreams, raised a little above itself, and above\nordinary retrospect.  The true aspect of the place, especially of the\nhouse there in which he had lived as a child, the fashion of its\ndoors, its hearths, its windows, the very scent upon the air of it,\nwas with him in sleep for a season; only, with tints more musically\nblent on wall [173] and floor, and some finer light and shadow\nrunning in and out along its curves and angles, and with all its\nlittle carvings daintier.  He awoke with a sigh at the thought of\nalmost thirty years which lay between him and that place, yet with a\nflutter of pleasure still within him at the fair light, as if it\nwere a smile, upon it.  And it happened that this accident of his\ndream was just the thing needed for the beginning of a certain design\nhe then had in view, the noting, namely, of some things in the story\nof his spirit–in that process of brain-building by which we are,\neach one of us, what we are.  With the image of the place so clear\nand favourable upon him, he fell to thinking of himself therein, and\nhow his thoughts had grown up to him.  In that half-spiritualised\nhouse he could watch the better, over again, the gradual expansion of\nthe soul which had come to be there–of which indeed, through the law\nwhich makes the material objects about them so large an element in\nchildren’s lives, it had actually become a part; inward and outward\nbeing woven through and through each other into one inextricable\ntexture–half, tint and trace and accident of homely colour and form,\nfrom the wood and the bricks; half, mere soul-stuff, floated thither\nfrom who knows how far.  In the house and garden of his dream he saw\na child moving, and could divide the main streams at least of\nthe winds that had played on [174] him, and study so the first stage\nin that mental journey.",
        "The old house, as when Florian talked of it afterwards he always\ncalled it, (as all children do, who can recollect a change of home,\nsoon enough but not too soon to mark a period in their lives) really\nwas an old house; and an element of French descent in its inmates–\ndescent from Watteau, the old court-painter, one of whose gallant\npieces still hung in one of the rooms–might explain, together with\nsome other things, a noticeable trimness and comely whiteness about\neverything there–the curtains, the couches, the paint on the walls\nwith which the light and shadow played so delicately; might explain\nalso the tolerance of the great poplar in the garden, a tree most\noften despised by English people, but which French people love,\nhaving observed a certain fresh way its leaves have of dealing with\nthe wind, making it sound, in never so slight a stirring of the air,\nlike running water.",
        "The old-fashioned, low wainscoting went round the rooms, and up the\nstaircase with carved balusters and shadowy angles, landing half-way\nup at a broad window, with a swallow’s nest below the sill, and the\nblossom of an old pear-tree showing across it in late April, against\nthe blue, below which the perfumed juice of the find of fallen fruit\nin autumn was so fresh.  At the next turning came the closet which\nheld on its deep shelves the best china.  Little angel [175] faces\nand reedy flutings stood out round the fireplace of the children’s\nroom.  And on the top of the house, above the large attic, where the\nwhite mice ran in the twilight–an infinite, unexplored wonderland of\nchildish treasures, glass beads, empty scent-bottles still sweet,\nthrum of coloured silks, among its lumber–a flat space of roof,\nrailed round, gave a view of the neighbouring steeples; for the\nhouse, as I said, stood near a great city, which sent up heavenwards,\nover the twisting weather-vanes, not seldom, its beds of rolling\ncloud and smoke, touched with storm or sunshine.  But the child of\nwhom I am writing did not hate the fog because of the crimson lights\nwhich fell from it sometimes upon the chimneys, and the whites which\ngleamed through its openings, on summer mornings, on turret or\npavement.  For it is false to suppose that a child’s sense of beauty\nis dependent on any choiceness or special fineness, in the objects\nwhich present themselves to it, though this indeed comes to be the\nrule with most of us in later life; earlier, in some degree, we see\ninwardly; and the child finds for itself, and with unstinted delight,\na difference for the sense, in those whites and reds through the\nsmoke on very homely buildings, and in the gold of the dandelions at\nthe road-side, just beyond the houses, where not a handful of earth\nis virgin and untouched, in the lack of better ministries to its\ndesire of beauty.",
        "[176] This house then stood not far beyond the gloom and rumours of\nthe town, among high garden-wall, bright all summer-time with Golden-\nrod, and brown-and-golden Wall-flower–Flos Parietis, as the\nchildren’s Latin-reading father taught them to call it, while he was\nwith them.  Tracing back the threads of his complex spiritual habit,\nas he was used in after years to do, Florian found that he owed to\nthe place many tones of sentiment afterwards customary with him,\ncertain inward lights under which things most naturally presented\nthemselves to him.  The coming and going of travellers to the town\nalong the way, the shadow of the streets, the sudden breath of the\nneighbouring gardens, the singular brightness of bright weather\nthere, its singular darknesses which linked themselves in his mind to\ncertain engraved illustrations in the old big Bible at home, the\ncoolness of the dark, cavernous shops round the great church, with\nits giddy winding stair up to the pigeons and the bells–a citadel of\npeace in the heart of the trouble–all this acted on his childish\nfancy, so that ever afterwards the like aspects and incidents never\nfailed to throw him into a well-recognised imaginative mood, seeming\nactually to have become a part of the texture of his mind.  Also,\nFlorian could trace home to this point a pervading preference in\nhimself for a kind of comeliness and dignity, an urbanity literally,\nin modes of life, which he connected with the pale [177] people of\ntowns, and which made him susceptible to a kind of exquisite\nsatisfaction in the trimness and well-considered grace of certain\nthings and persons he afterwards met with, here and there, in his way\nthrough the world.",
        "So the child of whom I am writing lived on there quietly; things\nwithout thus ministering to him, as he sat daily at the window with\nthe birdcage hanging below it, and his mother taught him to read,\nwondering at the ease with which he learned, and at the quickness of\nhis memory.  The perfume of the little flowers of the lime-tree fell\nthrough the air upon them like rain; while time seemed to move ever\nmore slowly to the murmur of the bees in it, till it almost stood\nstill on June afternoons.  How insignificant, at the moment, seem the\ninfluences of the sensible things which are tossed and fall and lie\nabout us, so, or so, in the environment of early childhood.  How\nindelibly, as we afterwards discover, they affect us; with what\ncapricious attractions and associations they figure themselves on the\nwhite paper, the smooth wax, of our ingenuous souls, as “with lead in\nthe rock for ever,” giving form and feature, and as it were assigned\nhouse-room in our memory, to early experiences of feeling and\nthought, which abide with us ever afterwards, thus, and not\notherwise.  The realities and passions, the rumours of the greater\nworld without, steal in upon us, each by its own special little\npassage-way, through the wall of custom [178] about us; and never\nafterwards quite detach themselves from this or that accident, or\ntrick, in the mode of their first entrance to us.  Our\nsusceptibilities, the discovery of our powers, manifold experiences–\nour various experiences of the coming and going of bodily pain, for\ninstance–belong to this or the other well-remembered place in the\nmaterial habitation–that little white room with the window across\nwhich the heavy blossoms could beat so peevishly in the wind, with\njust that particular catch or throb, such a sense of teasing in it,\non gusty mornings; and the early habitation thus gradually becomes a\nsort of material shrine or sanctuary of sentiment; a system of\nvisible symbolism interweaves itself through all our thoughts and\npassions; and irresistibly, little shapes, voices, accidents–the\nangle at which the sun in the morning fell on the pillow–become\nparts of the great chain wherewith we are bound.",
        "Thus far, for Florian, what all this had determined was a peculiarly\nstrong sense of home–so forcible a motive with all of us–prompting\nto us our customary love of the earth, and the larger part of our\nfear of death, that revulsion we have from it, as from something\nstrange, untried, unfriendly; though life-long imprisonment, they\ntell you, and final banishment from home is a thing bitterer still;\nthe looking forward to but a short space, a mere childish gouter and\ndessert of it, before the end, being so great a resource of [179]\neffort to pilgrims and wayfarers, and the soldier in distant\nquarters, and lending, in lack of that, some power of solace to the\nthought of sleep in the home churchyard, at least–dead cheek by dead\ncheek, and with the rain soaking in upon one from above.",
        "So powerful is this instinct, and yet accidents like those I have\nbeen speaking of so mechanically determine it; its essence being\nindeed the early familiar, as constituting our ideal, or typical\nconception, of rest and security.  Out of so many possible\nconditions, just this for you and that for me, brings ever the\nunmistakeable realisation of the delightful chez soi; this for the\nEnglishman, for me and you, with the closely-drawn white curtain and\nthe shaded lamp; that, quite other, for the wandering Arab, who folds\nhis tent every morning, and makes his sleeping-place among haunted\nruins, or in old tombs.",
        "With Florian then the sense of home became singularly intense, his\ngood fortune being that the special character of his home was in\nitself so essentially home-like.  As after many wanderings I have\ncome to fancy that some parts of Surrey and Kent are, for Englishmen,\nthe true landscape, true home-counties, by right, partly, of a\ncertain earthy warmth in the yellow of the sand below their gorse-\nbushes, and of a certain grey-blue mist after rain, in the hollows of\nthe hills there, welcome to fatigued eyes, and never seen farther\nsouth; so I think that the sort of [180] house I have described, with\nprecisely those proportions of red-brick and green, and with a just\nperceptible monotony in the subdued order of it, for its\ndistinguishing note, is for Englishmen at least typically home-life.\nAnd so for Florian that general human instinct was reinforced by this\nspecial home-likeness in the place his wandering soul had happened to\nlight on, as, in the second degree, its body and earthly tabernacle;\nthe sense of harmony between his soul and its physical environment\nbecame, for a time at least, like perfectly played music, and the\nlife led there singularly tranquil and filled with a curious sense of\nself-possession.  The love of security, of an habitually undisputed\nstanding-ground or sleeping-place, came to count for much in the\ngeneration and correcting of his thoughts, and afterwards as a\nsalutary principle of restraint in all his wanderings of spirit.  The\nwistful yearning towards home, in absence from it, as the shadows of\nevening deepened, and he followed in thought what was doing there\nfrom hour to hour, interpreted to him much of a yearning and regret\nhe experienced afterwards, towards he knew not what, out of strange\nways of feeling and thought in which, from time to time, his spirit\nfound itself alone; and in the tears shed in such absences there\nseemed always to be some soul-subduing foretaste of what his last\ntears might be.",
        "And the sense of security could hardly have [181] been deeper, the\nquiet of the child’s soul being one with the quiet of its home, a\nplace “inclosed” and “sealed.”  But upon this assured place, upon the\nchild’s assured soul which resembled it, there came floating in from\nthe larger world without, as at windows left ajar unknowingly, or\nover the high garden walls, two streams of impressions, the\nsentiments of beauty and pain–recognitions of the visible, tangible,\naudible loveliness of things, as a very real and somewhat tyrannous\nelement in them–and of the sorrow of the world, of grown people and\nchildren and animals, as a thing not to be put by in them.  From this\npoint he could trace two predominant processes of mental change in\nhim–the growth of an almost diseased sensibility to the spectacle of\nsuffering, and, parallel with this, the rapid growth of a certain\ncapacity of fascination by bright colour and choice form–the sweet\ncurvings, for instance, of the lips of those who seemed to him comely\npersons, modulated in such delicate unison to the things they said or\nsang,–marking early the activity in him of a more than customary\nsensuousness, “the lust of the eye,” as the Preacher says, which\nmight lead him, one day, how far!  Could he have foreseen the\nweariness of the way!  In music sometimes the two sorts of\nimpressions came together, and he would weep, to the surprise of\nolder people.  Tears of joy too the child knew, also to older\npeople’s surprise; real tears, once, of relief from long-strung,\n[182] childish expectation, when he found returned at evening, with\nnew roses in her cheeks, the little sister who had been to a place\nwhere there was a wood, and brought back for him a treasure of fallen\nacorns, and black crow’s feathers, and his peace at finding her again\nnear him mingled all night with some intimate sense of the distant\nforest, the rumour of its breezes, with the glossy blackbirds aslant\nand the branches lifted in them, and of the perfect nicety of the\nlittle cups that fell.  So those two elementary apprehensions of the\ntenderness and of the colour in things grew apace in him, and were\nseen by him afterwards to send their roots back into the beginnings\nof life.",
        "Let me note first some of the occasions of his recognition of the\nelement of pain in things–incidents, now and again, which seemed\nsuddenly to awake in him the whole force of that sentiment which\nGoethe has called the Weltschmerz, and in which the concentrated\nsorrow of the world seemed suddenly to lie heavy upon him.  A book\nlay in an old book-case, of which he cared to remember one picture–a\nwoman sitting, with hands bound behind her, the dress, the cap, the\nhair, folded with a simplicity which touched him strangely, as if not\nby her own hands, but with some ambiguous care at the hands of\nothers–Queen Marie Antoinette, on her way to execution–we all\nremember David’s drawing, meant merely to make her ridiculous.  The\nface [183] that had been so high had learned to be mute and\nresistless; but out of its very resistlessness, seemed now to call on\nmen to have pity, and forbear; and he took note of that, as he closed\nthe book, as a thing to look at again, if he should at any time\nfind himself tempted to be cruel.  Again, he would never quite forget\nthe appeal in the small sister’s face, in the garden under the\nlilacs, terrified at a spider lighted on her sleeve.  He could trace\nback to the look then noted a certain mercy he conceived always for\npeople in fear, even of little things, which seemed to make him,\nthough but for a moment, capable of almost any sacrifice of himself.\nImpressible, susceptible persons, indeed, who had had their sorrows,\nlived about him; and this sensibility was due in part to the tacit\ninfluence of their presence, enforcing upon him habitually the fact\nthat there are those who pass their days, as a matter of course, in a\nsort of “going quietly.”  Most poignantly of all he could recall, in\nunfading minutest circumstance, the cry on the stair, sounding\nbitterly through the house, and struck into his soul for ever, of an\naged woman, his father’s sister, come now to announce his death in\ndistant India; how it seemed to make the aged woman like a child\nagain; and, he knew not why, but this fancy was full of pity to him.\nThere were the little sorrows of the dumb animals too–of the white\nangora, with a dark tail like an ermine’s, and a face like a [184]\nflower, who fell into a lingering sickness, and became quite\ndelicately human in its valetudinarianism, and came to have a hundred\ndifferent expressions of voice–how it grew worse and worse, till it\nbegan to feel the light too much for it, and at last, after one wild\nmorning of pain, the little soul flickered away from the body, quite\nworn to death already, and now but feebly retaining it.",
        "So he wanted another pet; and as there were starlings about the\nplace, which could be taught to speak, one of them was caught, and he\nmeant to treat it kindly; but in the night its young ones could be\nheard crying after it, and the responsive cry of the mother-bird\ntowards them; and at last, with the first light, though not till\nafter some debate with himself, he went down and opened the cage, and\nsaw a sharp bound of the prisoner up to her nestlings; and therewith\ncame the sense of remorse,–that he too was become an accomplice in\nmoving, to the limit of his small power, the springs and handles of\nthat great machine in things, constructed so ingeniously to play\npain-fugues on the delicate nerve-work of living creatures.",
        "I have remarked how, in the process of our brain-building, as the\nhouse of thought in which we live gets itself together, like some\nairy bird’s-nest of floating thistle-down and chance straws, compact\nat last, little accidents have their consequence; and thus it\nhappened that, as he [185] walked one evening, a garden gate, usually\nclosed, stood open; and lo! within, a great red hawthorn in full\nflower, embossing heavily the bleached and twisted trunk and\nbranches, so aged that there were but few green leaves thereon–a\nplumage of tender, crimson fire out of the heart of the dry wood.\nThe perfume of the tree had now and again reached him, in the\ncurrents of the wind, over the wall, and he had wondered what might\nbe behind it, and was now allowed to fill his arms with the flowers–\nflowers enough for all the old blue-china pots along the chimney-\npiece, making fete in the children’s room.  Was it some periodic\nmoment in the expansion of soul within him, or mere trick of heat in\nthe heavily-laden summer air?",
        "But the beauty of the thing struck home to him feverishly; and in\ndreams all night he loitered along a magic roadway of crimson\nflowers, which seemed to open ruddily in thick, fresh masses about\nhis feet, and fill softly all the little hollows in the banks on\neither side.  Always afterwards, summer by summer, as the flowers\ncame on, the blossom of the red hawthorn still seemed to him\nabsolutely the reddest of all things; and the goodly crimson, still\nalive in the works of old Venetian masters or old Flemish tapestries,\ncalled out always from afar the recollection of the flame in those\nperishing little petals, as it pulsed gradually out of them, kept\nlong in the drawers of an old cabinet.",
        "[186] Also then, for the first time, he seemed to experience a\npassionateness in his relation to fair outward objects, an\ninexplicable excitement in their presence, which disturbed him, and\nfrom which he half longed to be free.  A touch of regret or desire\nmingled all night with the remembered presence of the red flowers,\nand their perfume in the darkness about him; and the longing for some\nundivined, entire possession of them was the beginning of a\nrevelation to him, growing ever clearer, with the coming of the\ngracious summer guise of fields and trees and persons in each\nsucceeding year, of a certain, at times seemingly exclusive,\npredominance in his interests, of beautiful physical things, a kind\nof tyranny of the senses over him.",
        "In later years he came upon philosophies which occupied him much in\nthe estimate of the proportion of the sensuous and the ideal elements\nin human knowledge, the relative parts they bear in it; and, in his\nintellectual scheme, was led to assign very little to the abstract\nthought, and much to its sensible vehicle or occasion.  Such\nmetaphysical speculation did but reinforce what was instinctive in\nhis way of receiving the world, and for him, everywhere, that\nsensible vehicle or occasion became, perhaps only too surely, the\nnecessary concomitant of any perception of things, real enough to be\nof any weight or reckoning, in his house of thought.  There were\ntimes when he could think of the [187] necessity he was under of\nassociating all thoughts to touch and sight, as a sympathetic link\nbetween himself and actual, feeling, living objects; a protest in\nfavour of real men and women against mere grey, unreal abstractions;\nand he remembered gratefully how the Christian religion, hardly less\nthan the religion of the ancient Greeks, translating so much of its\nspiritual verity into things that may be seen, condescends in part to\nsanction this infirmity, if so it be, of our human existence, wherein\nthe world of sense is so much with us, and welcomed this thought as a\nkind of keeper and sentinel over his soul therein.  But certainly, he\ncame more and more to be unable to care for, or think of soul but as\nin an actual body, or of any world but that wherein are water and\ntrees, and where men and women look, so or so, and press actual\nhands.  It was the trick even his pity learned, fastening those who\nsuffered in anywise to his affections by a kind of sensible\nattachments.  He would think of Julian, fallen into incurable\nsickness, as spoiled in the sweet blossom of his skin like pale\namber, and his honey-like hair; of Cecil, early dead, as cut off from\nthe lilies, from golden summer days, from women’s voices; and then\nwhat comforted him a little was the thought of the turning of the\nchild’s flesh to violets in the turf above him.  And thinking of the\nvery poor, it was not the things which most men care most for that he\nyearned to give them; [188] but fairer roses, perhaps, and power to\ntaste quite as they will, at their ease and not task-burdened, a\ncertain desirable, clear light in the new morning, through which\nsometimes he had noticed them, quite unconscious of it, on their way\nto their early toil.",
        "So he yielded himself to these things, to be played upon by them like\na musical instrument, and began to note with deepening watchfulness,\nbut always with some puzzled, unutterable longing in his enjoyment,\nthe phases of the seasons and of the growing or waning day, down even\nto the shadowy changes wrought on bare wall or ceiling–the light\ncast up from the snow, bringing out their darkest angles; the brown\nlight in the cloud, which meant rain; that almost too austere\nclearness, in the protracted light of the lengthening day, before\nwarm weather began, as if it lingered but to make a severer workday,\nwith the school-books opened earlier and later; that beam of June\nsunshine, at last, as he lay awake before the time, a way of gold-\ndust across the darkness; all the humming, the freshness, the perfume\nof the garden seemed to lie upon it–and coming in one afternoon in\nSeptember, along the red gravel walk, to look for a basket of yellow\ncrab-apples left in the cool, old parlour, he remembered it the more,\nand how the colours struck upon him, because a wasp on one bitten\napple stung him, and he felt the passion of [189] sudden, severe\npain.  For this too brought its curious reflexions; and, in relief\nfrom it, he would wonder over it–how it had then been with him–\npuzzled at the depth of the charm or spell over him, which lay, for a\nlittle while at least, in the mere absence of pain; once, especially,\nwhen an older boy taught him to make flowers of sealing-wax, and he\nhad burnt his hand badly at the lighted taper, and been unable to\nsleep.  He remembered that also afterwards, as a sort of typical\nthing–a white vision of heat about him, clinging closely, through\nthe languid scent of the ointments put upon the place to make it\nwell.",
        "Also, as he felt this pressure upon him of the sensible world, then,\nas often afterwards, there would come another sort of curious\nquestioning how the last impressions of eye and ear might happen to\nhim, how they would find him–the scent of the last flower, the soft\nyellowness of the last morning, the last recognition of some object\nof affection, hand or voice; it could not be but that the latest look\nof the eyes, before their final closing, would be strangely vivid;\none would go with the hot tears, the cry, the touch of the wistful\nbystander, impressed how deeply on one! or would it be, perhaps, a\nmere frail retiring of all things, great or little, away from one,\ninto a level distance?",
        "For with this desire of physical beauty mingled itself early the fear\nof death–the fear of death [190] intensified by the desire of\nbeauty.  Hitherto he had never gazed upon dead faces, as sometimes,\nafterwards, at the Morgue in Paris, or in that fair cemetery at\nMunich, where all the dead must go and lie in state before burial,\nbehind glass windows, among the flowers and incense and holy candles-\n-the aged clergy with their sacred ornaments, the young men in their\ndancing-shoes and spotless white linen–after which visits, those\nwaxen, resistless faces would always live with him for many days,\nmaking the broadest sunshine sickly.  The child had heard indeed of\nthe death of his father, and how, in the Indian station, a fever had\ntaken him, so that though not in action he had yet died as a soldier;\nand hearing of the “resurrection of the just,” he could think of him\nas still abroad in the world, somehow, for his protection–a grand,\nthough perhaps rather terrible figure, in beautiful soldier’s things,\nlike the figure in the picture of Joshua’s Vision in the Bible–and\nof that, round which the mourners moved so softly, and afterwards\nwith such solemn singing, as but a worn-out garment left at a\ndeserted lodging.  So it was, until on a summer day he walked with\nhis mother through a fair churchyard.  In a bright dress he rambled\namong the graves, in the gay weather, and so came, in one corner,\nupon an open grave for a child–a dark space on the brilliant grass–\nthe black mould lying heaped up round it, weighing down the little\njewelled [191] branches of the dwarf rose-bushes in flower.  And\ntherewith came, full-grown, never wholly to leave him, with the\ncertainty that even children do sometimes die, the physical horror of\ndeath, with its wholly selfish recoil from the association of lower\nforms of life, and the suffocating weight above.  No benign, grave\nfigure in beautiful soldier’s things any longer abroad in the world\nfor his protection! only a few poor, piteous bones; and above them,\npossibly, a certain sort of figure he hoped not to see.  For sitting\none day in the garden below an open window, he heard people talking,\nand could not but listen, how, in a sleepless hour, a sick woman had\nseen one of the dead sitting beside her, come to call her hence; and\nfrom the broken talk evolved with much clearness the notion that not\nall those dead people had really departed to the churchyard, nor were\nquite so motionless as they looked, but led a secret, half-fugitive\nlife in their old homes, quite free by night, though sometimes\nvisible in the day, dodging from room to room, with no great goodwill\ntowards those who shared the place with them.  All night the figure\nsat beside him in the reveries of his broken sleep, and was not quite\ngone in the morning–an odd, irreconcileable new member of the\nhousehold, making the sweet familiar chambers unfriendly and suspect\nby its uncertain presence.  He could have hated the dead he had\npitied so, for being [192] thus.  Afterwards he came to think of\nthose poor, home-returning ghosts, which all men have fancied to\nthemselves–the revenants–pathetically, as crying, or beating with\nvain hands at the doors, as the wind came, their cries\ndistinguishable in it as a wilder inner note.  But, always making\ndeath more unfamiliar still, that old experience would ever, from\ntime to time, return to him; even in the living he sometimes caught\nits likeness; at any time or place, in a moment, the faint atmosphere\nof the chamber of death would be breathed around him, and the image\nwith the bound chin, the quaint smile, the straight, stiff feet, shed\nitself across the air upon the bright carpet, amid the gayest\ncompany, or happiest communing with himself.",
        "To most children the sombre questionings to which impressions like\nthese attach themselves, if they come at all, are actually suggested\nby religious books, which therefore they often regard with much\nsecret distaste, and dismiss, as far as possible, from their habitual\nthoughts as a too depressing element in life.  To Florian such\nimpressions, these misgivings as to the ultimate tendency of the\nyears, of the relationship between life and death, had been suggested\nspontaneously in the natural course of his mental growth by a strong\ninnate sense for the soberer tones in things, further strengthened by\nactual circumstances; and religious sentiment, that [193] system of\nbiblical ideas in which he had been brought up, presented itself to\nhim as a thing that might soften and dignify, and light up as with a\n\"lively hope,” a melancholy already deeply settled in him.  So he\nyielded himself easily to religious impressions, and with a kind of\nmystical appetite for sacred things; the more as they came to him\nthrough a saintly person who loved him tenderly, and believed that\nthis early pre-occupation with them already marked the child out for\na saint.  He began to love, for their own sakes, church lights, holy\ndays, all that belonged to the comely order of the sanctuary, the\nsecrets of its white linen, and holy vessels, and fonts of pure\nwater; and its hieratic purity and simplicity became the type of\nsomething he desired always to have about him in actual life.  He\npored over the pictures in religious books, and knew by heart the\nexact mode in which the wrestling angel grasped Jacob, how Jacob\nlooked in his mysterious sleep, how the bells and pomegranates were\nattached to the hem of Aaron’s vestment, sounding sweetly as he\nglided over the turf of the holy place.  His way of conceiving\nreligion came then to be in effect what it ever afterwards remained–\na sacred history indeed, but still more a sacred ideal, a\ntranscendent version or representation, under intenser and more\nexpressive light and shade, of human life and its familiar or\nexceptional incidents, birth, death, marriage, [194] youth, age,\ntears, joy, rest, sleep, waking–a mirror, towards which men might\nturn away their eyes from vanity and dullness, and see themselves\ntherein as angels, with their daily meat and drink, even, become a\nkind of sacred transaction–a complementary strain or burden, applied\nto our every-day existence, whereby the stray snatches of music in it\nre-set themselves, and fall into the scheme of some higher and more\nconsistent harmony.  A place adumbrated itself in his thoughts,\nwherein those sacred personalities, which are at once the reflex and\nthe pattern of our nobler phases of life, housed themselves; and this\nregion in his intellectual scheme all subsequent experience did but\ntend still further to realise and define.  Some ideal, hieratic\npersons he would always need to occupy it and keep a warmth there.\nAnd he could hardly understand those who felt no such need at all,\nfinding themselves quite happy without such heavenly companionship,\nand sacred double of their life, beside them.",
        "Thus a constant substitution of the typical for the actual took place\nin his thoughts.  Angels might be met by the way, under English elm\nor beech-tree; mere messengers seemed like angels, bound on celestial\nerrands; a deep mysticity brooded over real meetings and partings;\nmarriages were made in heaven; and deaths also, with hands of angels\nthereupon, to bear soul and body quietly asunder, each to its [195]\nappointed rest.  All the acts and accidents of daily life borrowed a\nsacred colour and significance; the very colours of things became\nthemselves weighty with meanings like the sacred stuffs of Moses’\ntabernacle, full of penitence or peace.  Sentiment, congruous in the\nfirst instance only with those divine transactions, the deep,\neffusive unction of the House of Bethany, was assumed as the due\nattitude for the reception of our every-day existence; and for a time\nhe walked through the world in a sustained, not unpleasurable awe,\ngenerated by the habitual recognition, beside every circumstance and\nevent of life, of its celestial correspondent.",
        "Sensibility–the desire of physical beauty–a strange biblical awe,\nwhich made any reference to the unseen act on him like solemn music–\nthese qualities the child took away with him, when, at about the age\nof twelve years, he left the old house, and was taken to live in\nanother place.  He had never left home before, and, anticipating much\nfrom this change, had long dreamed over it, jealously counting the\ndays till the time fixed for departure should come; had been a little\ncareless about others even, in his strong desire for it–when Lewis\nfell sick, for instance, and they must wait still two days longer.\nAt last the morning came, very fine; and all things–the very\npavement with its dust, at the roadside–seemed to have a white,\npearl-like lustre in them.  They were to travel by a [196] favourite\nroad on which he had often walked a certain distance, and on one of\nthose two prisoner days, when Lewis was sick, had walked farther than\never before, in his great desire to reach the new place.  They had\nstarted and gone a little way when a pet bird was found to have been\nleft behind, and must even now–so it presented itself to him–have\nalready all the appealing fierceness and wild self-pity at heart of\none left by others to perish of hunger in a closed house; and he\nreturned to fetch it, himself in hardly less stormy distress.  But as\nhe passed in search of it from room to room, lying so pale, with a\nlook of meekness in their denudation, and at last through that\nlittle, stripped white room, the aspect of the place touched him like\nthe face of one dead; and a clinging back towards it came over him,\nso intense that he knew it would last long, and spoiling all his\npleasure in the realisation of a thing so eagerly anticipated.  And\nso, with the bird found, but himself in an agony of home-sickness,\nthus capriciously sprung up within him, he was driven quickly away,\nfar into the rural distance, so fondly speculated on, of that\nfavourite country-road.",
        "172. *Published in Macmillan’s Magazine, Aug. 1878.",
        "[197] WE smile at epitaphs–at those recent enough to be read easily;\nsmile, for the most part, at what for the most part is an unreal and\noften vulgar branch of literature; yet a wide one, with its flowers\nhere or there, such as make us regret now and again not to have\ngathered more carefully in our wanderings a fair average of the like.\nTheir very simplicity, of course, may set one’s thoughts in motion to\nfill up the scanty tale, and those of the young at least are almost\nalways worth while.  At Siena, for instance, in the great Dominican\nchurch, even with the impassioned work of Sodoma at hand, you may\nlinger in a certain dimly lit chapel to spell out the black-letter\nmemorials of the German students who died here–aetatis flore!–at\nthe University, famous early in the last century; young nobles\nchiefly, far from the Rhine, from Nuremberg, or Leipsic.  Note one in\nparticular!  Loving parents and elder brother meant to record [198]\ncarefully the very days of the lad’s poor life–annos, menses, dies;\nsent the order, doubtless, from the distant old castle in the\nFatherland, but not quite explicitly; the spaces for the numbers\nremain still unfilled; and they never came to see.  After two\ncenturies the omission is not to be rectified; and the young man’s\nmemorial has perhaps its propriety as it stands, with those\nunnumbered, or numberless, days.  “Full of affections,” observed,\nonce upon a time, a great lover of boys and young men, speaking to a\nlarge company of them:–\"full of affections, full of powers, full of\noccupation, how naturally might the younger part of us especially\n(more naturally than the older) receive the tidings that there are\nthings to be loved and things to be done which shall never pass away.\nWe feel strong, we feel active, we feel full of life; and these\nfeelings do not altogether deceive us, for we shall live for ever.\nWe see a long prospect before us, for which it is worth while to\nwork, even with much labour; for we are as yet young, and the past\nportion of our lives is but small in comparison of that which\nprobably remains to us.  It is most true!  The past years of our life\nare absolutely beyond proportion small in comparison with those which\ncertainly remain to us.”",
        "In a very different neighbourhood, here at home, in a remote Sussex\nchurchyard, you may read that Emerald Uthwart was born on such a\n[199] day, “at Chase Lodge, in this parish; and died there,” on a day\nin the year 18–, aged twenty-six.  Think, thereupon, of the years of\na very English existence passed without a lost week in that bloomy\nEnglish place, amid its English lawns and flower-beds, its oldish\nbrick and raftered plaster; you may see it still, not far off, on a\nclearing of the wooded hill-side sloping gradually to the sea.  But\nyou think wrong.  Emerald Uthwart, in almost unbroken absence from\nhis home, longed greatly for it, but left it early and came back\nthere only to die, in disgrace, as he conceived; of which it was he\ndied there, finding the sense of the place all around him at last,\nlike blessed oil in one’s wounds.",
        "How they shook their musk from them!–those gardens, among which the\nyoungest son, but not the youngest child, grew up, little considered\ntill he returned there in those last years.  The rippling note of the\nbirds he distinguished so acutely seemed a part of this tree-less\nplace, open freely to sun and air, such as rose and carnation loved,\nin the midst of the old disafforested chase.  Brothers and sisters,\nall alike were gardeners, methodically intimate with their flowers.\nYou need words compact rather of perfume than of colour to describe\nthem, in nice annual order; terms for perfume, as immediate and\ndefinite as red, purple, and yellow.  Flowers there were which seemed\nto yield their sweetest in the faint sea-salt, when the loosening\nwind [200] was strong from the south-west; some which found their way\nslowly towards the neighbourhood of the old oaks and beech-trees.\nOthers consorted most freely with the wall-fruit, or seemed made for\npot-pourri to sweeten the old black mahogany furniture.  The sweet-\npea stacks loved the broad path through the kitchen garden; the old-\nfashioned garden azalea was the making of a nosegay, with its honey\nwhich clung to one’s finger.  There were flowers all the sweeter for\na battle with the rain; a flower like aromatic medicine; another like\nsummer lingering into winter; it ripened as fruit does; and another\nwas like August, his own birthday time, dropped into March.",
        "The very mould here, rich old black gardener’s earth, was flower-\nseed; and beyond, the fields, one after another, through the white\ngates breaking the well-grown hedge-rows, were hardly less garden-\nlike; little velvety fields, little with the true sweet English\nlittleness of our little island, our land of vignettes.  Here all was\nlittle; the very church where they went to pray, to sit, the ancient\nUthwarts sleeping all around outside under the windows, deposited\nthere as quietly as fallen trees on their native soil, and almost\nunrecorded, as there had been almost nothing to record; where\nhowever, Sunday after Sunday, Emerald Uthwart reads, wondering, the\nsolitary memorial of one soldierly member of his race, who had,–\nwell! who had not died here [201] at home, in his bed.  How wretched!\nhow fine! how inconceivably great and difficult!–not for him!  And\nyet, amid all its littleness, how large his sense of liberty in the\nplace he, the cadet doomed to leave it–his birth-place, where he is\nalso so early to die–had loved better than any one of them!\nEnjoying hitherto all the freedom of the almost grown-up brothers,\nthe unrepressed noise, the unchecked hours, the old rooms, all their\nown way, he is literally without the consciousness of rule.  Only,\nwhen the long irresponsible day is over, amid the dew, the odours, of\nsummer twilight, they roll their cricket-field against to-morrow’s\ngame.  So it had always been with the Uthwarts; they never went to\nschool.  In the great attic he has chosen for himself Emerald\nawakes;–it was a rule, sanitary, almost medical, never to rouse the\nchildren–rises to play betimes; or, if he choose, with window flung\nopen to the roses, the sea, turns to sleep again, deliberately,\ndeliciously, under the fine old blankets.",
        "A rather sensuous boy! you may suppose, amid the wholesome, natural\nself-indulgence of a very English home.  His days began there: it\nclosed again, after an interval of the larger number of them,\nindulgently, mercifully, round his end.  For awhile he became its\ncentre, old habits changing, the old furniture rearranged about him,\nfor the first time in many generations, though he left it now with\nsomething like [202] resentment in his heart, as if thrust harshly\naway, sent ablactatus a matre; made an effort thereon to snap the\nlast thread which bound him to it.  Yet it would come back upon him\nsometimes, amid so different a scene, as through a suddenly opened\ndoor, or a rent in the wall, with softer thoughts of his people,–\nthere, or not there,–and a sudden, dutiful effort on his part to\nrekindle wasting affection.",
        "The youngest of four sons, but not the youngest of the family!–you\nconceive the sort of negligence that creeps over even the kindest\nmaternities, in such case; unless, perhaps, sickness, or the sort of\nmisfortune, making the last first for the affectionate, that brought\nEmerald back at length to die contentedly, interferes with the way of\nnature.  Little by little he comes to understand that, while the\nbrothers are indulged with lessons at home, are some of them free\neven of these and placed already in the world, where, however, there\nremains no place for him, he is to go to school, chiefly for the\nconvenience of others–they are going to be much away from home!–\nthat now for the first time, as he says to himself, an old-English\nUthwart is to pass under the yoke.  The tutor in the house, meantime,\naware of some fascination in the lad, teaches him, at his own\nirregularly chosen hours, more carefully than the others; exerts all\nhis gifts for the purpose, winning him on almost insensibly to\nyouthful proficiency in those difficult rudiments.",
        "[203] See him as he stands, seemingly rooted in the spot where he has\ncome to flower!  He departs, however, a few days before the departure\nof the rest–some to foreign parts, the brothers, who shut up the old\nplace, to town.  For a moment, he makes an effort to figure to\nhimself those coming absences as but exceptional intervals in his\nlife here; he will count the days, going more quickly so; find his\npleasure in watching the sands fall, as even the sands of time at\nschool must.  In fact, he was scarcely ever to lie at ease here\nagain, till he came to take his final leave of it, lying at his\nlength so.  In brief holidays he rejoins his people, anywhere,\nanyhow, in a sort of hurry and makeshift:–Flos Parietis! thus\ncarelessly plucked forth.  Emerald Uthwart was born on such a day “at\nChase Lodge, in this parish, and died there.”",
        "See him then as he stands! counting now the hours that remain, on the\neve of that first emigration, and look away next at the other place,\nwhich through centuries has been forming to receive him; from those\ngarden-beds, now at their richest, but where all is so winsomely\nlittle, to that place of “great matters,” great stones, great\nmemories out of reach.  Why! the Uthwarts had scarcely had more\nmemories than their woods, noiselessly deciduous; or their\nprehistoric, entirely unprogressive, unrecording forefathers, in or\nbefore the days of the Druids.  Centuries of almost “still” life–of\nbirth, death, [204] and the rest, as merely natural processes–had\nmade them and their home what we find them.  Centuries of conscious\nendeavour, on the other hand, had builded, shaped, and coloured the\nplace, a small cell, which Emerald Uthwart was now to occupy; a place\nsuch as our most characteristic English education has rightly tended\nto “find itself a house” in–a place full, for those who came within\nits influence, of a will of its own.  Here everything, one’s very\ngames, have gone by rule onwards from the dim old monastic days, and\nthe Benedictine school for novices with the wholesome severities\nwhich have descended to our own time.  Like its customs,–there’s a\nbook in the cathedral archives with the names, for centuries Past, of\nthe “scholars” who have missed church at the proper times for going\nthere–like its customs, well-worn yet well-preserved, time-stained,\ntime-engrained, time-mellowed, the venerable Norman or English stones\nof this austere, beautifully proportioned place look like marble, to\nwhich Emerald’s softly nurtured being, his careless wild-growth must\nnow adapt itself, though somewhat painfully recoiling from contact\nwith what seems so hard also, and bright, and cold.  From his native\nworld of soft garden touches, carnation and rose (they had been\neverywhere in those last weeks), where every one did just what he\nliked, he was passed now to this world of grey stone; and here it was\nalways the decisive word [205] of command.  That old warrior\nUthwart’s record in the church at home, so fine, yet so wretched, so\nunspeakably great and difficult! seemed written here everywhere\naround him, as he stood feeling himself fit only to be taught, to be\ndrilled into, his small compartment; in every movement of his\ncompanions, with their quaint confining little cloth gowns; in the\nkeen, clear, well-authorised dominancy of some, the instant\nsubmission of others.  In fact, by one of our wise English\ncompromises, we still teach our so modern boys the Classics; a lesson\nin attention and patience, at the least.  Nay! by a double\ncompromise, with delightful physiognomic results sometimes, we teach\nthem their pagan Latin and Greek under the shadow of medieval church-\ntowers, amid the haunts, the traditions, and with something of the\ndiscipline, of monasticism; for which, as is noticeable, the English\nhave never wholly lost an early inclination.  The French and others\nhave swept their scholastic houses empty of it, with pedantic\nfidelity to their theories.  English pedants may succeed in doing the\nlike.  But the result of our older method has had its value so far,\nat least, say! for the careful aesthetic observer.  It is of such\ndiagonal influences, through complication of influence, that\nexpression comes, in life, in our culture, in the very faces of men\nand boys–of these boys.  Nothing could better harmonise present with\npast than the sight of them just here, as they [206] shout at their\ngames, or recite their lessons, over-arched by the work of medieval\npriors, or pass to church meekly, into the seats occupied by the\nyoung monks before them.",
        "If summer comes reluctantly to our English shores, it is also apt to\nlinger with us;–its flora of red and gold leaves on the branches\nwellnigh to Christmas; the hot days that surprise you, and persist,\nthough heralded by white mornings, hinting that it is but the year’s\nindulgence so to deal with us.  To the fanciful, such days may seem\nmost at home in the places where England has thus preferred to locate\nthe somewhat pensive education of its more favoured youth.  As\nUthwart passes through the old ecclesiastical city, upon which any\nmore modern touch, modern door or window, seems a thing out of place\nthrough negligence, the diluted sunlight itself seems driven along\nwith a sparing trace of gilded vane or red tile in it, under the\nwholesome active wind from the East coast.  The long, finely\nweathered, leaden roof, and the great square tower, gravely\nmagnificent, emphatic from the first view of it over the grey down\nabove the hop-gardens, the gently-watered meadows, dwarf now\neverything beside; have the bigness of nature’s work, seated up there\nso steadily amid the winds, as rain and fog and heat pass by.  More\nand more persistently, as he proceeds, in the “Green Court” at last,\nthey occupy the outlook.  He is shown the narrow [207] cubicle in\nwhich he is to sleep; and there it still is, with nothing else, in\nthe window-pane, as he lies;–\"our tower,” the “Angel Steeple,\"\nnoblest of its kind.  Here, from morning to night, everything seems\nchallenged to follow the upward lead of its long, bold,\n\"perpendicular” lines.  The very place one is in, its stone-work, its\nempty spaces, invade you; invade all who belong to them, as Uthwart\nbelongs, yielding wholly from the first; seem to question you\nmasterfully as to your purpose in being here at all, amid the great\nmemories of the past, of this school;–challenge you, so to speak, to\nmake moral philosophy one of your acquirements, if you can, and to\nsystematise your vagrant self; which however will in any case be here\nsystematised for you.  In Uthwart, then, is the plain tablet, for the\ninfluences of place to inscribe.  Say if you will, that he is under\nthe power of an “embodied ideal,” somewhat repellent, but which he\ncannot despise.  He sits in the schoolroom–ancient, transformed\nchapel of the pilgrims; sits in the sober white and brown place, at\nthe heavy old desks, carved this way and that, crowded as an old\nchurchyard with forgotten names, side by side with sympathetic or\nantipathetic competitors, as it may chance.  In a delightful, exactly\nmeasured, quarter of an hour’s rest, they come about him, seem to\nwish to be friends at once, good and bad alike, dull and clever;\nwonder a little at the name, and [208] the owner.  A family name–he\nexplains, good-humouredly; tries to tell some story no one could ever\nremember precisely of the ancestor from whom it came, the one story\nof the Uthwarts; is spared; nay! petulantly forbidden to proceed.\nBut the name sticks the faster.  Nicknames mark, for the most part,\npopularity.  Emerald! so every one called Uthwart, but shortened to\nAldy.  They disperse; flock out into the court; acquaint him hastily\nwith the curiosities of the Precincts, the “dark entry,” the rich\nheraldries of the blackened and mouldering cloister, the ruined\novergrown spaces where the old monastery stood, the stones of which\nfurnished material for the rambling prebends houses, now\n\"antediluvian” in their turn; are ready also to climb the scaffold-\npoles always to be found somewhere about the great church, or dive\nalong the odd, secret passages of the old builders, with quite\nlearned explanations (being proud of, and therefore painstaking\nabout, the place) of architectural periods, of Gothic “late” and\n\"early,” layer upon layer, down to round-arched “Norman,” like the\nfamous staircase of their school.",
        "The reader comprehends that Uthwart was come where the genius loci\nwas a strong one, with a claim to mould all who enter it to a\nperfect, uninquiring, willing or unwilling, conformity to itself.  On\nSaturday half-holidays the scholars are taken to church in their\nsurplices, across the [209] court, under the lime-trees; emerge at\nlast up the dark winding passages into the melodious, mellow-lighted\nspace, always three days behind the temperature outside, so thick are\nthe walls;–how warm and nice! how cool and nice!  The choir, to\nwhich they glide in order to their places below the clergy, seems\nconspicuously cold and sad.  But the empty chapels lying beyond it\nall about into the distance are a trap on sunny mornings for the\nclouds of yellow effulgence.  The Angel Steeple is a lantern within,\nand sheds down a flood of the like just beyond the gates.  You can\npeep up into it where you sit, if you dare to gaze about you.  If at\nhome there had been nothing great, here, to boyish sense, one seems\ndiminished to nothing at all, amid the grand waves, wave upon wave,\nof patiently-wrought stone; the daring height, the daring severity,\nof the innumerable, long, upward, ruled lines, rigidly bent just at\nlast, in due place, into the reserved grace of the perfect Gothic\narch; the peculiar daylight which seemed to come from further than\nthe light outside.  Next morning they are here again.  In contrast to\nthose irregularly broken hours at home, the passive length of things\nimpresses Uthwart now.  It develops patience–that tale of hours, the\nlong chanted English service; our English manner of education is a\ndevelopment of patience, of decorous and mannerly patience.  “It is\ngood for a man that he bear the yoke in [210] his youth: he putteth\nhis mouth in the dust, he keepeth silence, because he hath borne it\nupon him.\"–They have this for an anthem; sung however to wonderfully\ncheerful and sprightly music, as if one liked the thought.",
        "The aim of a veritable community, says Plato, is not that this or\nthat member of it should be disproportionately at ease, but that the\nwhole should flourish; though indeed such general welfare might come\nround again to the loyal unit therein, and rest with him, as a\nprivilege of his individual being after all.  The social type he\npreferred, as we know, was conservative Sparta and its youth; whose\nunsparing discipline had doubtless something to do with the fact that\nit was the handsomest and best-formed in all Greece.  A school is not\nmade for one.  It would misrepresent Uthwart’s wholly unconscious\nhumility to say that he felt the beauty of the askesis+ (we need that\nGreek word) to which he not merely finds himself subject, but as\nunder a fascination submissively yields himself, although another\nmight have been aware of the charm of it, half ethic, half physical,\nas visibly effective in him.  Its peculiarity would have lain in the\nexpression of a stress upon him and his customary daily existence,\nbeyond what any definitely proposed issue of it, at least for the\nmoment, explained.  Something of that is involved in the very idea of\na classical education, at least for such as he; in its seeming\nindirectness [211] or lack of purpose, amid so much difficulty, as\ncontrasted with forms of education more obviously useful or\npractical.  He found himself in a system of fixed rules, amid which,\nit might be, some of his own tendencies and inclinations would die\nout of him through disuse.  The confident word of command, the\ninstantaneous obedience expected, the enforced silence, the very\ngames that go by rule, a sort of hardness natural to wholesome\nEnglish youths when they come together, but here de rigueur as a\npoint of good manners;–he accepts all these without hesitation; the\nearly hours also, naturally distasteful to him, which gave to actual\nmorning, to all that had passed in it, when in more self-conscious\nmood he looked back on the morning of life, a preponderance, a\ndisproportionate place there, adding greatly to the effect of its\ndreamy distance from him at this later time;–an ideal quality, he\nmight have said, had he ever used such words as that.",
        "Uthwart duly passes his examination; and, in their own chapel in the\ntransept of the choir, lighted up late for evening prayer after the\nlong day of trial, is received to the full privileges of a Scholar\nwith the accustomed Latin words:–Introitum tuum et exitum tuum\ncustodiat Dominus!  He takes them, not to heart, but rather to mind,\nas few, if they so much as heard them, were wont to do; ponders them\nfor a while.  They seem scarcely meant for him–words like those!\n[212] increase however his sense of responsibility to the place, of\nwhich he is now more exclusively than before a part–that he belongs\nto it, its great memories, great dim purposes; deepen the\nconsciousness he had on first coming hither of a demand in the world\nabout him, whereof the very stones are emphatic, to which no average\nhuman creature could be sufficient; of reproof, reproaches, of this\nor that in himself.",
        "It was reported, there was a funny belief, at school, that Aldy\nUthwart had no feeling and was incapable of tears.  They never came\nto him certainly, when, at nights for the most part, the very touch\nof home, so soft, yet so indifferent to him, reached him, with a\nsudden opulent rush of garden perfumes; came at the rattling of the\nwindow-pane in the wind, with anything that expressed distance from\nthe bare white walls around him here.  He thrust it from him\nbrusquely, being of a practical turn, and, though somewhat sensuous,\nwholly without sentimentality.  There is something however in the\nlad’s soldier-like, impassible self-command, in his sustained\nexpression of a certain indifference to things, which awakes suddenly\nall the sentiment, the poetry, latent hitherto in another–James\nStokes, the prefect, his immediate superior; awakes for the first\ntime into ample flower something of genius in a seemingly plodding\nscholar, and therewith also something of the waywardness popularly\nthought to belong to [213] genius.  Preceptores, condiscipuli, alike,\nmarvel at a sort of delicacy coming into the habits, the person, of\nthat tall, bashful, broad-shouldered, very Kentish, lad; so\nunaffectedly nevertheless, that it is understood after all to be but\nthe smartness properly significant of change to early manhood, like\nthe down on his lip.  Wistful anticipations of manhood are in fact\naroused in him, thoughts of the future; his ambition takes effective\noutline.  The well-worn, perhaps conventional, beauties of their\n\"dead” Greek and Latin books, associated directly now with the living\ncompanion beside him, really shine for him at last with their\npristine freshness; seem more than to fulfil their claim upon the\npatience, the attention, of modern youth.  He notices as never before\nminute points of meaning in Homer, in Virgil; points out thus, for\ninstance, to his junior, one day in the sunshine, how the Greeks had\na special word for the Fate which accompanied one who would come to a\nviolent end.  The common Destinies of men, Moirai,+ Moerae–they\naccompanied all men indifferently.  But Ker,+ the extraordinary\nDestiny, one’s Doom, had a scent for distant blood-shedding; and, to\nbe in at a sanguinary death, one of their number came forth to the\nvery cradle, followed persistently all the way, over the waves,\nthrough powder and shot, through the rose-gardens;–where not?\nLooking back, one might trace the red footsteps all along, side by\n[214] side.  (Emerald Uthwart, you remember, was to “die there,” of\nlingering sickness, in disgrace, as he fancied, while the word glory\ncame to be softly whispered of them and of their end.) Classic\nfelicities, the choice expressions, with which James Stokes has so\npatiently stored his memory, furnish now a dainty embroidery upon\nevery act, every change in time or place, of their daily life in\ncommon.  He finds the Greek or the Latin model of their antique\nfriendship or tries to find it, in the books they read together.\nNone fits exactly.  It is of military glory they are really thinking,\namid those ecclesiastical surroundings, where however surplices and\nuniforms are often mingled together; how they will lie, in costly\nglory, costly to them, side by side, (as they work and walk and play\nnow, side by side) in the cathedral aisle, with a tattered flag\nperhaps above them, and under a single epitaph, like that of those\ntwo older scholars, Ensigns, Signiferi, in their respective\nregiments, in hac ecclesia pueri instituti,+ with the sapphic stanza\nin imitation of the Horace they had learned here, written by their\nold master.",
        "Horace!–he was, had been always, the idol of their school; to know\nhim by heart, to translate him into effective English idiom, have an\napt phrase of his instinctively on one’s lips for every occasion.\nThat boys should be made to spout him under penalties, would have\nseemed doubtless to that sensitive, vain, winsome poet, [215] even\nmore than to grim Juvenal, quite the sorriest of fates; might have\nseemed not so bad however, could he, from the “ashes” so persistently\nin his thoughts, have peeped on these English boys, row upon row,\nwith black or golden heads, repeating him in the fresh morning, and\nobserved how well for once the thing was done; how well he was\nunderstood by English James Stokes, feeling the old “fire” really\n\"quick” still, under the influence which now in truth quickened,\nenlivened, everything around him.  The old heathen’s way of looking\nat things, his melodious expression of it, blends, or contrasts\nitself oddly with the everyday detail, with the very stones, the\nGothic stones, of a world he could hardly have conceived, its\nmedieval surroundings, their half-clerical life here.  Yet not so\ninconsistently after all!  The builders of these aisles and cloisters\nhad known and valued as much of him as they could come by in their\nown un-instructed time; had built up their intellectual edifice more\nthan they were aware of from fragments of pagan thought, as, quite\nconsciously, they constructed their churches of old Roman bricks and\npillars, or frank imitations of them.  One’s day, then, began with\nhim, for all alike, Sundays of course excepted,–with an Ode, learned\nover-night by the prudent, who, observing how readily the words which\nsend us to sleep cling to the brain and seem an inherent part of it\nnext morning, kept him under [216] their pillows.  Prefects, without\na book, heard the repetition of the Juniors, must be able to correct\ntheir blunders.  Odes and Epodes, thus acquired, were a score of days\nand weeks; alcaic and sapphic verses like a bead-roll for counting\noff the time that intervened before the holidays.  Time–that tardy\nservant of youthful appetite–brought them soon enough to the point\nwhere they desired in vain “to see one of” those days, erased now so\nwillingly; and sentimental James Stokes has already a sense that this\n\"pause ’twixt cup and lip” of life is really worth pausing over,\nworth deliberation:–all this poetry, yes! poetry, surely, of their\nalternate work and play; light and shade, call it!  Had it been,\nafter all, a life in itself less commonplace than theirs–that life,\nthe trivial details of which their Horace had touched so daintily,\ngilded with real gold words?",
        "Regular, submissive, dutiful to play also, Aldy meantime enjoys his\ntriumphs in the Green Court; loves best however to run a paper-chase\nafar over the marshes, till you come in sight, or within scent, of\nthe sea, in the autumn twilight; and his dutifulness to games at\nleast had its full reward.  A wonderful hit of his at cricket was\nlong remembered; right over the lime-trees on to the cathedral roof,\nwas it? or over the roof, and onward into space, circling there\nindependently, minutely, as Sidus Cantiorum?  A comic poem on it in\nLatin, and a pretty one in English, [217] were penned by James\nStokes, still not so serious but that he forgets time altogether one\nday, in a manner the converse of exemplary in a prefect, whereupon\nUthwart, his companion as usual, manages to take all the blame, and\nthe due penalty next morning.  Stokes accepted the sacrifice the more\nreadily, believing–he too–that Aldy was “incapable of pain.”  What\nsurprised those who were in the secret was that, when it was over, he\nrose, and facing the head-master–could it be insolence? or was it\nthe sense of untruthfulness in his friendly action, or sense of the\nuniversal peccancy of all boys and men?–said submissively: “And now,\nsir, that I have taken my punishment, I hope you will forgive my\nfault.”",
        "Submissiveness!–It had the force of genius with Emerald Uthwart.  In\nthat very matter he had but yielded to a senior against his own\ninclination.  What he felt in Horace was the sense, original, active,\npersonal, of “things too high for me!”, the sense, not really\nunpleasing to him, of an unattainable height here too, in this royal\nfelicity of utterance, this literary art, the minute cares of which\nhad been really designed for the minute carefulness of a disciple\nsuch as this–all attention.  Well! the sense of authority, of a\nlarge intellectual authority over us, impressed anew day after day,\nof some impenetrable glory round “the masters of those who know,” is,\nof course, one of the effects we [218] look for from a classical\neducation:–that, and a full estimate of the preponderating value of\nthe manner of the doing of it in the thing done; which again, for\ningenuous youth, is an encouragement of good manners on its part:–\"I\nbehave myself orderly.”  Just at those points, scholarship attains\nsomething of a religious colour.  And in that place, religion,\nreligious system, its claim to overpower one, presented itself in a\nway of which even the least serious by nature could not be unaware.\nTheir great church, its customs and traditions, formed an element in\nthat esprit de corps into which the boyish mind throws itself so\nreadily.  Afterwards, in very different scenes, the sentiment of that\nplace would come back upon him, as if resentfully, by contrast with\nthe conscious or unconscious profanities of others, crushed out about\nhim straightway, by the shadow of awe, the minatory flash, felt\naround his unopened lips, in the glance, the changed manner.  Not to\nbe “occupied with great matters” recommends in heavenly places, as we\nknow, the souls of some.  Yet there were a few to whom it seemed\nunfortunate that religion whose flag Uthwart would have borne in\nhands so pure, touched him from first to last, and till his eyes were\nfinally closed on this world, only, again, as a thing immeasurable,\nsurely not meant for the like of him; its high claims, to which no\none could be equal; its reproaches.  He would scarcely have proposed\nto “enter into” [219] such matters; was constitutionally shy of them.\nHis submissiveness, you see, was a kind of genius; made him\ntherefore, of course, unlike those around him; was a secret; a thing,\nyou might say, “which no one knoweth, saving he that receiveth it.”",
        "Thus repressible, self-restrained, always concurring with the\ninfluence, the claim upon him, the rebuke, of others, in the bustle\nof school life he did not count even with those who knew him best,\nwith those who taught him, for the intellectual capacity he really\nhad.  In every generation of schoolboys there are a few who find out,\nalmost for themselves, the beauty and power of good literature, even\nin the literature they must read perforce; and this, in turn, is but\nthe handsel of a beauty and power still active in the actual world,\nshould they have the good fortune, or rather, acquire the skill, to\ndeal with it properly.  It has something of the stir and unction–\nthis intellectual awaking with a leap–of the coming of love.  So it\nwas with Uthwart about his seventeenth year.  He felt it, felt the\nintellectual passion, like the pressure outward of wings within him–\nhe pterou dynamis,+ says Plato, in the Phaedrus; but again, as some do\nwith everyday love, withheld, restrained himself; the status of a\nfreeman in the world of intellect can hardly be for him.  The sense\nof intellectual ambition, ambitious thoughts such as sweeten the toil\nof some of those about him, [220] coming to him once in a way, he is\nfrankly recommended to put them aside, and acquiesces; puts them from\nhim once for all, as he could do with besetting thoughts and\nfeelings, his preferences, (as he had put aside soft thoughts of home\nas a disobedience to rule) and with a countenance more good-humoured\nthan ever, an absolute placidity.  It is fit he should be treated\nsparingly in this matter of intellectual enjoyment.  He is made to\nunderstand that there is at least a score of others as good scholars\nas he.  He will have of course all the pains, but must not expect the\nprizes, of his work; of his loyal, incessant, cheerful industry.",
        "But only see him as he goes.  It is as if he left music, delightfully\nthrobbing music, or flowers, behind him, as he passes, careless of\nthem, unconsciously, through the world, the school, the precincts,\nthe old city.  Strangers’ eyes, resting on him by chance, are\ndeterred for a while, even among the rich sights of the venerable\nplace, as he walks out and in, in his prim gown and purple-tasselled\ncap; goes in, with the stream of sunlight, through the black shadows\nof the mouldering Gothic gateway, like youth’s very self, eternal,\nimmemorial, eternally renewed, about those immemorially ancient\nstones.  “Young Apollo!” people say–people who have pigeon-holes for\ntheir impressions, watching the slim, trim figure with the exercise\nbooks.  His very dress seems touched [221] with Hellenic fitness to\nthe healthy youthful form.  “Golden-haired, scholar Apollo!” they\nrepeat, foolishly, ignorantly.  He was better; was more like a real\nportrait of a real young Greek, like Tryphon, Son of Eutychos, for\ninstance, (as friends remembered him with regret, as you may see him\nstill on his tombstone in the British Museum) alive among the paler\nphysical and intellectual lights of modern England, under the old\nmonastic stonework of the Middle Age.  That theatrical old Greek god\nnever took the expressiveness, the lines of delicate meaning, such as\nwere come into the face of the English lad, the physiognomy of his\nrace; ennobled now, as if by the writing, the signature, there, of a\ngrave intelligence, by grave information and a subdued will, though\nwithout a touch of melancholy in this “best of playfellows.”  A\nmusical composer’s notes, we know, are not themselves till the fit\nexecutant comes, who can put all they may be into them.  The somewhat\nunmeaningly handsome facial type of the Uthwarts, moulded to a mere\nanimal or physical perfection through wholesome centuries, is\nbreathed on now, informed, by the touches, traces, complex influences\nfrom past and present a thousandfold, crossing each other in this\nlate century, and yet at unity in the simple law of the system to\nwhich he is now subject.  Coming thus upon an otherwise vigorous and\nhealthy nature, an untainted [222] physique, and limited by it, those\ncombining mental influences leave the firm unconscious simplicity of\nthe boyish nature still unperplexed.  The sisters, their friends,\nwhen he comes rarely upon them in foreign places, are proud of the\nschoolboy’s company–to walk at his side; the brothers, when he sees\nthem for a day, more considerate than of old.  Everywhere he leaves\nbehind him an odd regret for his presence, as he in turn wonders\nsometimes at the deference paid to one so unimportant as himself by\nthose he meets by accident perhaps; at the ease, for example, with\nwhich he attains to the social privileges denied to others.",
        "They tell him, he knows it already, he would “do for the army.\"\n\"Yes! that would suit you,” people observe at once, when he tells\nthem what “he is to be\"–undoubtedly suit him, that dainty, military,\nvery English kind of pride, in seeming precisely what one is, neither\nmore nor less.  And the first mention of Uthwart’s purpose defines\nalso the vague outlooks of James Stokes, who will be a soldier too.\nUniforms, their scarlet and white and blue, spruce leather and steel,\nand gold lace, enlivening the old oak stalls at service time–\nuniforms and surplices were always close together here, where a\nmilitary garrison had been established in the suburbs for centuries\npast, and there were always sons of its officers in the school.  If\nyou stole out of an evening, it was like a stage scene– [223] nay!\nlike the Middle Age, itself, with this multitude of soldiers mingling\nin the crowd which filled the unchanged, gabled streets.  A military\ntradition had been continuous, from the days of crusading knights who\nlay humbly on their backs in the “Warriors’ Chapel” to the time of\nthe civil wars, when a certain heroic youth of eighteen was brought\nto rest there, onward to Dutch and American wars, and to Harry, and\nGeoffrey, and another James also, in hac ecclesia pueri instituti.\nIt was not so long since one of them sat on those very benches in the\nsixth form; had come back and entered the school, in full uniform, to\nsay good-bye!  Then the “colours” of his regiment had been brought,\nto be deposited by Dean and Canons in the cathedral; and a few weeks\nlater they had passed, scholars and the rest in long procession, to\ndeposit Ensign–himself there under his flag, or what remained of it,\na sorry, tattered fringe, along the staff he had borne out of the\nbattle at the cost of his life, as a little tablet explained.  There\nwere others in similar terms.  Alas! for that extraordinary,\npeculiarly-named, Destiny, or Doom, appointed to walk side by side\nwith one or another, aware from the first, but never warning him,\ntill the random or well-considered shot comes.",
        "Meantime however, the University, with work in preparation thereto,\nfills up the thoughts, the hours, of these would-be soldiers, of\nJames [224] Stokes, and therefore of Emerald Uthwart, through the\nlong summer-time, till the Green Court is fragrant with lime-blossom,\nand speech-day comes, on which, after their flower-service and sermon\nfrom an old comrade, Emerald surprises masters and companions by the\nfine quality of a recitation; still more when “Scholar Stokes” and he\nare found bracketed together as “Victors” of the school, who will\nproceed together to Oxford.  His speech in the Chapter-house was from\nthat place in Homer, where the soul of the lad Elpenor, killed by\naccident, entreats Ulysses for due burial rites.  “Fix my oar over my\ngrave,” he says, “the oar I rowed with when I lived, when I went with\nmy companions.”  And in effect what surprised, charmed the hearers\nwas the scruple with which those naturally graceful lips dealt with\nevery word, every syllable, put upon them.  He seemed to be thinking\nonly of his author, except for just so much of self-consciousness as\nwas involved in the fact that he seemed also to be speaking a little\nagainst his will; like a monk, it might be said, who sings in choir\nwith a really fine voice, but at the bidding of his superior, and\ncounting the notes all the while till his task be done, because his\nwhole nature revolts from so much as the bare opportunity for\npersonal display.  It was his duty to speak on the occasion.  They\nhad always been great in speech-making, in theatricals, from before\n[225] the days when the Puritans destroyed the Dean’s “Great Hall\"\nbecause “the King’s Scholars had profaned it by acting plays there\";\nand that peculiar note or accent, as being conspicuously free from\nthe egotism which vulgarises most of us, seemed to befit the person\nof Emerald, impressing weary listeners pleasantly as a novelty in\nthat kind.  Singular!–The words, because seemingly forced from him,\nhad been worth hearing.  The cheers, the “Kentish Fire,” of their\ncompanions might have broken down the crumbling black arches of the\nold cloister, or roused the dead under foot, as the “Victors” came\nout of the Chapter-house side by side; side by side also out of that\ndelightful period of their life at school, to proceed in due course\nto the University.",
        "They left it precipitately, after brief residence there, taking\nadvantage of a sudden outbreak of war to join the army at once,\nregretted–James Stokes for his high academic promise, Uthwart for a\nquality, or group of qualities, not strictly to be defined.  He\nseemed, in short, to harmonise by their combination in himself all\nthe various qualities proper to a large and varied community of\nyouths of nineteen or twenty, to which, when actually present there,\nhe was felt from hour to hour to be indispensable.  In fact school\nhabits and standards had survived in a world not so different from\nthat of school for those who are faithful to its type.  When he\nlooked back upon [226] it a little later, college seemed to him,\nseemed indeed at the time, had he ventured to admit it, a strange\nprolongation of boyhood, in its provisional character, the narrow\nlimitation of its duties and responsibility, the very divisions of\none’s day, the routine of play and work, its formal, perhaps pedantic\nrules.  The veritable plunge from youth into manhood came when one\npassed finally through those old Gothic gates, from a somewhat dreamy\nor problematic preparation for it, into the world of peremptory\nfacts.  A college, like a school, is not made for one; and as Uthwart\nsat there, still but a scholar, still reading with care the books\nprescribed for him by others–Greek and Latin books–the contrast\nbetween his own position and that of the majority of his coevals\nalready at the business of life impressed itself sometimes with an\nodd sense of unreality in the place around him.  Yet the schoolboy’s\nsensitive awe for the great things of the intellectual world had but\nmatured itself, and was at its height here amid this larger\ncompetition, which left him more than ever to find in doing his best\nsubmissively the sole reward of so doing.  He needs now in fact less\nrepression than encouragement not to be a “passman,” as he may if he\nlikes, acquiescing in a lowly measure of culture which certainly will\nnot manufacture Miltons, nor turn serge into silk, broom-blossom into\nverbenas, but only, perhaps not so faultily, leave Emerald Uthwart\nand the like of him [227] essentially what they are.  “He holds his\nbook in a peculiar way,” notes in manuscript one of his tutors;\n\"holds on to it with both hands; clings as if from below, just as his\ntough little mind clings to the sense of the Greek words he can\nEnglish so closely, precisely.”  Again, as at school, he had put his\nneck under the yoke; though he has now also much reading quite at his\nown choice; by preference, when he can come by such, about the place\nwhere he finds himself, about the earlier youthful occupants, if it\nmight be, of his own quaint rooms on the second floor just below the\nroof; of what he can see from his windows in the old black front\neastwards, with its inestimable patina of ancient smoke and weather\nand natural decay (when you look close the very stone is a composite\nof minute dead bodies) relieving heads like his so effectively on\nsummer mornings.  On summer nights the scent of the hay, the wild-\nflowers, comes across the narrow fringe of town to right and left;\nseems to come from beyond the Oxford meadows, with sensitive, half-\nrepellent thoughts from the gardens at home.  He looks down upon the\ngreen square with the slim, quaint, black, young figures that cross\nit on the way to chapel on yellow Sunday mornings, or upwards to the\ndome, the spire; can watch them closely in freakish moonlight, or\nflickering softly by an occasional bonfire in the quadrangle behind\nhim.  Yet how hard, how forbidding sometimes, under [228] a late\nstormy sky, the scheme of black, white, and grey, to which the group\nof ancient buildings could attune itself.  And what he reads most\nreadily is of the military life that intruded itself so oddly, during\nthe Civil War, into these half-monastic places, till the timid old\nacademic world scarcely knew itself.  He treasures then every\nincident which connects a soldier’s coat with any still recognisable\nobject, wall, or tree, or garden-walk; that walk, for instance, under\nMerton garden where young Colonel Windebank was shot for a traitor.\nHis body lies in Saint Mary Magdalen’s churchyard.  Unassociated to\nsuch incident, the mere beauties of the place counted at the moment\nfor less than in retrospect.  It was almost retrospect even now, with\nan anticipation of regret, in rare moments of solitude perhaps, when\nthe oars splashed far up the narrow streamlets through the fields on\nMay evenings among the fritillaries–does the reader know them? that\nstrange remnant just here of a richer extinct flora–dry flowers,\nthough with a drop of dubious honey in each.  Snakes’ heads, the rude\ncall them, for their shape, scale-marked too, and in colour like\nrusted blood, as if they grew from some forgotten battle-field, the\nbodies, the rotten armour–yet delicate, beautiful, waving proudly.\nIn truth the memory of Oxford made almost everything he saw after it\nseem vulgar.  But he feels also nevertheless, characteristically,\nthat such local pride (fastus he terms it) is proper [229] only for\nthose whose occupations are wholly congruous with it; for the gifted,\nthe freemen who can enter into the genius, who possess the liberty,\nof the place; that it has a reproach in it for the outsider, which\ncomes home to him.",
        "Here again then as he passes through the world, so delightfully to\nothers, they tell him, as if weighing him, his very self, against his\nmerely scholastic capacity and effects, that he would “do for the\narmy\"; which he is now wholly glad to hear, for from first to last,\nthrough all his successes there, the army had still been scholar\nStokes’ choice, and he had no difficulty, as the reader sees, in\nkeeping Uthwart also faithful to first intentions.  Their names were\nalready entered for commissions; but the war breaking out afresh,\ninformation reaches them suddenly one morning that they may join\ntheir regiment forthwith.  Bidding good-bye therefore, gladly,\nhastily, they set out with as little delay as possible for Flanders;\nand passing the old school by their nearest road thither, stay for an\nhour, find an excuse for coming into the hall in uniform, with which\nit must be confessed they seem thoroughly satisfied–Uthwart quite\nperversely at ease in the stiff make of his scarlet jacket with black\nfacings–and so pass onward on their way to Dover, Dunkirk, they\nscarcely know whither finally, among the featureless villages, the\nlong monotonous lines of the windmills, the poplars, blurred with\ncold fogs, but marking the [230] roads through the snow which covers\nthe endless plain, till they come in sight at last of the army in\nmotion, like machines moving–how little it looked on that endless\nplain!–pass on their rapid way to fame, to unpurchased promotion, as\na matter of course to responsibility also, till, their fortune\nturning upon them, they miscarry in the latter fatally.  They joined\nin fact a distinguished regiment in a gallant army, immediately after\na victory in those Flemish regions; shared its encouragement as fully\nas if they had had a share in its perils; the high character of the\nyoung officers consolidating itself easily, pleasantly for them, till\nthe hour of an act of thoughtless bravery, almost the sole irregular\nor undisciplined act of Uthwart’s life, he still following his\nsenior–criminal however to the military conscience, under the actual\ncircumstances, and in an enemy’s country.  The faulty thing was done,\ncertainly, with a scrupulous, a characteristic completeness on their\npart; and with their prize actually in hand, an old weather-beaten\nflag such as hung in the cathedral aisle at school, they bethought\nthem for the first time of its price, with misgivings now in rapid\ngrowth, as they return to their posts as nearly as may be, for the\ndivision has been ordered forward in their brief absence, to find\nthemselves under arrest, with that damning proof of heroism, of\nguilt, in their possession, relinquished however along with the\nswords they will never handle [231] again–toys, idolised toys of our\nlater youth, we weep at the thought of them as never to be handled\nagain!–as they enter the prison to await summary trial next day on\nthe charge of wantonly deserting their posts while in position of\nhigh trust in time of war.",
        "The full details of what had happened could have been told only by\none or other of themselves; by Uthwart best, in the somewhat matter-\nof-fact and prosaic journal he had managed to keep from the first,\nnoting there the incidents of each successive day, as if in\nanticipation of its possible service by way of piece justificative,\nshould such become necessary, attesting hour by hour their single-\nhearted devotion to soldierly duty.  Had a draughtsman equally\ntruthful or equally “realistic,” as we say, accompanied them and made\na like use of his pencil, he might have been mistaken at home for an\nartist aiming at “effect,” by skilful “arrangements” to tickle\npeople’s interest in the spectacle of war–the sudden ruin of a\nvillage street, the heap of bleeding horses in the half-ploughed\nfield, the gaping bridges, hand or face of the dead peeping from a\nhastily made grave at the roadside, smoke-stained rents in cottage-\nwalls, ignoble ruin everywhere–ignoble but for its frank expression.",
        "But you find in Uthwart’s journal, side by side with those ugly\npatches, very precise and unadorned records of their common\ngallantry, the more effective indeed for their simplicity; [232] and\nnot of gallantry only, but of the long-sustained patience also, the\nessential monotony of military life, even on a campaign.  Peril,\ngood-luck, promotion, the grotesque hardships which leave them smart\nas ever, (as if, so others observe, dust and mire wouldn’t hold on\nthem, so “spick and span” they were, more especially on days of any\nexceptional risk or effort) the great confidence reposed in them at\nlast; all is noted, till, with a little quiet pride, he records a\ngun-shot wound which keeps him a month alone in hospital wearily; and\nat last, its hasty but seemingly complete healing.",
        "Following, leading, resting sometimes perforce, amid gun-shots,\nputrefying wounds, green corpses, they never lacked good spirits, any\nmore than the birds warbling perennially afresh, as they will, over\nsuch gangrened places, or the grass which so soon covers them.  And\nat length fortune, their misfortune, perversely determined that\nheroism should take the form of patience under the walls of an\nunimportant frontier town, with old Vauban fortifications seemingly\nmade only for appearance’ sake, like the work in the trenches–\ngardener’s work! round about the walls they are called upon to\nsuperintend day after day.  It was like a calm at sea, delaying one’s\npassage, one’s purpose in being on board at all, a dead calm, yet\nwith an awful feeling of tension, intolerable at last for those who\nwere still all athirst for action.  How dumb and [233] stupid the\nplace seemed, in its useless defiance of conquerors, anxious, for\nreasons not indeed apparent, but which they were undoubtedly within\ntheir rights in holding to, not to blow it at once into the air–the\nsteeple, the perky weathercock–to James Stokes in particular, always\neloquent in action, longing for heroic effort, and ready to pay its\nprice, maddened now by the palpable imposture in front of him morning\nafter morning, as he demonstrates conclusively to Uthwart, seduced at\nlast from the clearer sense of duty and discipline, not by the\ndemonstrated ease, but rather by the apparent difficulty of what\nStokes proposes to do.  They might have been deterred by recent\nexample.  Colonel –, who, as every one knew, had actually gained a\nvictory by disobeying orders, had not been suffered to remain in the\narmy of which he was an ornament.  It was easy in fact for both,\nthough it seemed the heroic thing, to dash through the calm with\ndelightful sense of active powers renewed; to pass into the\nbeleaguered town with a handful of men, and no loss, after a manner\nthe feasibility of which Stokes had explained acutely but in vain at\nheadquarters.  He proved it to Uthwart at all events, and a few\nothers.  Delightful heroism! delightful self-indulgence!  It was\ndelayed for a moment by orders to move forward at last, with hopes\nchecked almost immediately after by a countermand, bringing them\nright round their [234] stupid dumb enemy to the same wearisome\nposition once again, to the trenches and the rest, but with their\nthirst for action only stimulated the more.  How great the\ndisappointment! encouraging a certain laxity of discipline that had\nprevailed about them of late.  They take advantage however of a vague\nphrase in their instructions; determine in haste to proceed on their\nplan as carefully, as sparingly of the lives of others as may be;\ndetach a small company, hazarding thereby an algebraically certain\nscheme at headquarters of victory or secure retreat, which embraced\nthe entire country in its calculations; detach themselves; finally\npass into the place, and out again with their prize, themselves\nsecure.  Themselves only could have told the details–the intensely\npleasant, the glorious sense of movement renewed once more; of\ndefiance, just for once, of a seemingly stupid control; their dismay\nat finding their company led forward by others, their own posts\ndeserted, their handful of men–nowhere!",
        "In an ordinary trial at law, the motives, every detail of so\nirregular an act might have been weighed, changing the colour of it.\nTheir general character would have told in their favour, but actually\ntold against them now; they had but won an exceptional trust to\nbetray it.  Martial courts exist not for consideration, but for vivid\nexemplary effect and prompt punishment.  “There is a kind of tribunal\nincidental [235] to service in the field,” writes another diarist,\nwho may tell in his own words what remains to be told.  “This court,\"\nhe says, “may consist of three staff-officers only, but has the power\nof sentencing to death.  On the –st two young officers of the –th\nregiment, in whom it appears unusual confidence had been placed, were\nbrought before this court, on the charge of desertion and wantonly\nexposing their company to danger.  They were found guilty, and the\nproper penalty death, to be inflicted next morning before the\nregiment marches.  The delinquents were understood to have appealed\nto a general court-martial; desperately at last, to ’the judgment of\ntheir country’; but were held to have no locus standi whatever for an\nappeal under the actual circumstances.  As a civilian I cannot but\ndoubt the justice, whatever may be thought of the expediency, of such\na summary process in regard to the capital penalty.  The regiment to\nwhich the culprits belonged, with some others, was quartered for the\nnight in the faubourg of Saint –, recently under blockade by a\nportion of our forces.  I was awoke at daybreak by the sound of\nmarching.  The morning was a particularly clear one, though, as the\nsun was not yet risen, it looked grey and sad along the empty street,\nup which a party of grey soldiers were passing with steady pace.  I\nknew for what purpose.",
        "“The whole of the force in garrison here [236] had already marched to\nthe place of execution, the immense courtyard of a monastery,\nsurrounded irregularly by ancient buildings like those of some\ncathedral precincts I have seen in England.  Here the soldiers then\nformed three sides of a great square, a grave having been dug on the\nfourth side.  Shortly afterwards the funeral procession came up.\nFirst came the band of the –th, playing the Dead March; next the\nfiring party, consisting of twelve non-commissioned officers; then\nthe coffins, followed immediately by the unfortunate prisoners,\naccompanied by a chaplain.  Slowly and sadly did the mournful\nprocession approach, when it passed through three sides of the\nsquare, the troops having been previously faced inwards, and then\nhalted opposite to the grave.  The proceedings of the court-martial\nwere then read; and the elder prisoner having been blindfolded was\nordered to kneel down on his coffin, which had been placed close to\nthe grave, the firing party taking up a position exactly opposite at\na few yards’ distance.  The poor fellow’s face was deadly pale, but\nhe had marched his last march as steadily as ever I saw a man step,\nand bore himself throughout most bravely, though an oddly mixed\nexpression passed over his countenance when he was directed to remove\nhimself from the side of his companion, shaking his hand first.  At\nthis moment there was hardly a dry eye, and several young soldiers\nfainted, numberless as must be [237] the scenes of horror which even\nthey have witnessed during these last months.  At length the\nchaplain, who had remained praying with the prisoner, quietly\nwithdrew, and at a given signal, but without word of command, the\nmuskets were levelled, a volley was fired, and the body of the\nunfortunate man sprang up, falling again on his back.  One shot had\npurposely been reserved; and as the presiding officer thought he was\nnot quite dead a musket was placed close to his head and fired.  All\nwas now over; but the troops having been formed into columns were\nmarched close by the body as it lay on the ground, after which it was\nplaced in one of the coffins and buried.",
        "“I had almost forgotten his companion, the younger and more fortunate\nprisoner, though I could scarcely tell, as I looked at him, whether\nhis fate was really preferable in leaving his own rough coffin\nunoccupied behind him there.  Lieutenant (I think Edward) Uthwart, as\nbeing the younger of the two offenders, ’by the mercy of the court’\nhad his sentence commuted to dismissal from the army with disgrace.\nA colour-sergeant then advanced with the former officer’s sword, a\nremarkably fine one, which he thereupon snapped in sunder over the\nprisoner’s head as he knelt.  After this the prisoner’s regimental\ncoat was handed forward and put upon him, the epaulettes and buttons\nbeing then torn off and flung to a distance.  This part of [238] such\nsentences is almost invariably spared; but, I suppose through\nunavoidable haste, was on the present occasion somewhat rudely\ncarried out.  I shall never forget the expression of this man’s\ncountenance, though I have seen many sad things in the course of my\nprofession.  He had the sort of good looks which always rivet\nattention, and in most minds friendly interest; and now, amid all his\npain and bewilderment, bore a look of humility and submission as he\nunderwent those extraordinary details of his punishment, which\ntouched me very oddly with a sort of desire (I cannot otherwise\nexpress it) to share his lot, to be actually in his place for a\nmoment.  Yet, alas! –no! say rather Thank Heaven! the nearest\napproach to that look I have seen has been on the face of those whom\nI have known from circumstances to be almost incapable at the time of\nany feeling whatever.  I would have offered him pecuniary aid,\nsupposing he needed it, but it was impossible.  I went on with the\nregiment, leaving the poor wretch to shift for himself, Heaven knows\nhow, the state of the country being what it is.  He might join the\nenemy!”",
        "What money Uthwart had about him had in fact passed that morning into\nthe hands of his guards.  To tell what followed would be to accompany\nhim on a roundabout and really aimless journey, the details of which\nhe could never afterwards recall.  See him lingering for morsels\n[239] of food at some shattered farmstead, or assisted by others\nalmost as wretched as himself, sometimes without his asking.  In his\nworn military dress he seems a part of the ruin under which he creeps\nfor a night’s rest as darkness comes on.  He actually came round\nagain to the scene of his disgrace, of the execution; looked in vain\nfor the precise spot where he had knelt; then, almost envying him who\nlay there, for the unmarked grave; passed over it perhaps\nunrecognised for some change in that terrible place, or rather in\nhimself; wept then as never before in his life; dragged himself on\nonce more, till suddenly the whole country seems to move under the\nrumour, the very thunder, of “the crowning victory,” as he is made to\nunderstand.  Falling in with the tide of its heroes returning to\nEnglish shores, his vagrant footsteps are at last directed homewards.\nHe finds himself one afternoon at the gate, turning out of the quiet\nSussex road, through the fields for whose safety he had fought with\nso much of undeniable gallantry and approval.",
        "On that July afternoon the gardens, the woods, mounted in flawless\nsweetness all round him as he stood, to meet the circle of a flawless\nsky.  Not a cloud; not a motion on the grass!  At the first he had\nintended to return home no more; and it had been a proof of his great\ndejection that he sent at last, as best he could, for money.  They\nknew his fate already [240] by report, and were touched naturally\nwhen that had followed on the record of his honours.  Had it been\npossible they would have set forth at any risk to meet, to seek him;\nwere waiting now for the weary one to come to the gate, ready with\ntheir oil and wine, to speak metaphorically, and from this time forth\nunderwent his charm to the utmost–the charm of an exquisite\ncharacter, felt in some way to be inseparable from his person, his\ncharacteristic movements, touched also now with seemingly irreparable\nsorrow.  For his part, drinking in here the last sweets of the\nsensible world, it was as if he, the lover of roses, had never before\nbeen aware of them at all.  The original softness of his temperament,\nagainst which the sense of greater things thrust upon him had\nsuccessfully reacted, asserted itself again now as he lay at ease,\nthe ease well merited by his deeds, his sorrows.  That he was going\nto die moved those about him to humour this mood, to soften all\nthings to his touch; and looking back he might have pronounced those\nfour last years of doom the happiest of his life.  The memory of the\ngrave into which he had gazed so steadily on the execution morning,\ninto which, as he feels, one half of himself had then descended, does\nnot lessen his shrinking from the fate before him, yet fortifies him\nto face it manfully, gives a sort of fraternal familiarity to death;\nin a few weeks’ time this battle too is fought out; it is as if the\nthing were ended. [241] The delightful summer heat, the freshness it\nenhances–he contrasts such things no longer with the sort of place\nto which he is hastening.  The possible duration of life for him was\nindeed uncertain, the future to some degree indefinite; but as\nregarded any fairly distant date, anything like a term of years, from\nthe first there had been no doubt at all; he would be no longer here.\nMeantime it was like a delightful few days’ additional holiday from\nschool, with which perforce one must be content at last; or as though\nhe had not been pardoned on that terrible morning, but only reprieved\nfor two or three years.  Yet how large a proportion they would have\nseemed in the whole sum of his years.  He would have liked to lie\nfinally in the garden among departed pets, dear dead dogs and horses;\nfaintly proposes it one day; but after a while comprehends the\nchurchyard, with its white spots in the distant flowery view, as\nfilling harmoniously its own proper place there.  The weary soul\nseemed to be settling deeper into the body and the earth it came of,\ninto the condition of the flowers, the grass, proper creatures of the\nearth to which he is returning.  The saintly vicar visits him\nconsiderately; is repelled with politeness; goes on his way pondering\ninwardly what kind of place there might be, in any possible scheme of\nanother world, for so absolutely unspiritual a subject.  In fact, as\nthe breath of the infinite world came about him, he clung all [242]\nthe faster to the beloved finite things still in contact with him; he\nhad successfully hidden from his eyes all beside.",
        "His reprieve however lasted long enough, after all, for a certain\nchange of opinion of immense weight to him–a revision or reversal of\njudgment.  It came about in this way.  When peace was arranged, with\nquestion of rewards, pensions, and the like, certain battles or\nincidents therein were fought over again, sometimes in the highest\nplaces of debate.  On such an occasion a certain speaker cites the\ncase of Lieutenant James Stokes and another, as being “pessimi\nexempli”: whereupon a second speaker gets up, prepared with full\ndetail, insists, brings that incidental matter to the front for an\nhour, tells his unfortunate friend’s story so effectively,\npathetically, that, as happens with our countrymen, they repent.  The\nmatter gets into the newspapers, and, coming thus into sympathetic\npublic view, something like glory wins from Emerald Uthwart his last\ntouch of animation.  Just not too late he received the offer of a\ncommission; kept the letter there open within sight.  Aldy, who\n\"never shed tears and was incapable of pain,” in his great physical\nweakness, wept–shall we say for the second time in his life?  A less\nexcitement would have been more favorable to any chance there might\nbe of the patient’s surviving.  In fact the old gun-shot wound,\nwrongly thought to be cured, which had caused [243] the one illness\nof his life, is now drawing out what remains of it, as he feels with\na kind of odd satisfaction and pride–his old glorious wound!  And\nthen, as of old, an absolute submissiveness comes over him, as he\ngazes round at the place, the relics of his uniform, the letter lying\nthere.  It was as if there was nothing more that could be said.\nAccounts thus settled, he stretched himself in the bed he had\noccupied as a boy, more completely at his ease than since the day\nwhen he had left home for the first time.  Respited from death once,\nhe was twice believed to be dead before the date actually registered\non his tomb.  “What will it matter a hundred years hence?” they used\nto ask by way of simple comfort in boyish troubles at school,\noverwhelming at the moment.  Was that in truth part of a certain\nrevelation of the inmost truth of things to “babes,” such as we have\nheard of?  What did it matter–the gifts, the good-fortune, its\nterrible withdrawal, the long agony?  Emerald Uthwart would have been\nall but a centenarian to-day.",
        "Postscript, from the Diary of a Surgeon,\nAugust –th, 18–.",
        "I was summoned by letter into the country to perform an operation on\nthe dead body of a young man, formerly an officer in the army.  The\ncause of death is held to have been some [244] kind of distress of\nmind, concurrent with the effects of an old gun-shot wound, the ball\nstill remaining somewhere in the body.  My instructions were to\nremove this, at the express desire, as I understood, of the deceased,\nrather than to ascertain the precise cause of death.  This however\nbecame apparent in the course of my search for the ball, which had\nenveloped itself in the muscular substance in the region of the\nheart, and was removed with difficulty.  I have known cases of this\nkind, where anxiety has caused incurable cardiac derangement (the\ndeceased seems to have been actually sentenced to death for some\nmilitary offence when on service in Flanders), and such mental strain\nwould of course have been aggravated by the presence of a foreign\nobject in that place.  On arriving at my destination, a small village\nin a remote part of Sussex, I proceeded through the little orderly\nchurchyard, where however the monthly roses were blooming all their\nown way among the formal white marble monuments of the wealthier\npeople of the neighbourhood.  At one of these the masons were at\nwork, picking and chipping in the otherwise absolute stillness of the\nsummer afternoon.  They were in fact opening the family burial-place\nof the people who summoned me hither; and the workmen pointed out\ntheir abode, conspicuous on the slope beyond, towards which I bent my\nsteps accordingly.  I was conducted to a large upper [245] room or\nattic, set freely open to sun and air, and found the body lying in a\ncoffin, almost hidden under very rich-scented cut flowers, after a\nmanner I have never seen in this country, except in the case of one\nor two Catholics laid out for burial.  The mother of the deceased was\npresent, and actually assisted my operations, amid such tokens of\ndistress, though perfectly self-controlled, as I fervently hope I may\nnever witness again.",
        "Deceased was in his twenty-seventh year, but looked many years\nyounger; had indeed scarcely yet reached the full condition of\nmanhood.  The extreme purity of the outlines, both of the face and\nlimbs, was such as is usually found only in quite early youth; the\nbrow especially, under an abundance of fair hair, finely formed, not\nhigh, but arched and full, as is said to be the way with those\nwho have the imaginative temper in excess.  Sad to think that had he\nlived reason must have deserted that so worthy abode of it!  I was\nstruck by the great beauty of the organic developments, in the\nstrictly anatomic sense; those of the throat and diaphragm in\nparticular might have been modelled for a teacher of normal\nphysiology, or a professor of design.  The flesh was still almost as\nfirm as that of a living person; as happens when, as in this case,\ndeath comes to all intents and purposes as gradually as in old age.",
        "This expression of health and life, under my seemingly merciless\ndoings, together with the mother’s distress, touched me to a degree\nvery [246] unusual, I conceive, in persons of my years and\nprofession.  Though I believed myself to be acting by his express\nwish, I felt like a criminal.  The ball, a small one, much corroded\nwith blood, was at length removed; and I was then directed to wrap it\nin a partly-printed letter, or other document, and place it in the\nbreast-pocket of a faded and much-worn scarlet soldier’s coat, put\nover the shirt which enveloped the body.  The flowers were then\nhastily replaced, the hands and the peak of the handsome nose\nremaining visible among them; the wind ruffled the fair hair a\nlittle; the lips were still red.  I shall not forget it.  The lid was\nthen placed on the coffin and screwed down in my presence.  There was\nno plate or other inscription upon it.",

        "[247] THERE are some unworldly types of character which the world is\nable to estimate.  It recognises certain moral types, or categories,\nand regards whatever falls within them as having a right to exist.\nThe saint, the artist, even the speculative thinker, out of the\nworld’s order as they are, yet work, so far as they work at all, in\nand by means of the main current of the world’s energy.  Often it\ngives them late, or scanty, or mistaken acknowledgment; still it has\nroom for them in its scheme of life, a place made ready for them in\nits affections.  It is also patient of doctrinaires of every degree\nof littleness.  As if dimly conscious of some great sickness and\nweariness of heart in itself, it turns readily to those who theorise\nabout its unsoundness.  To constitute one of these categories, or\ntypes, a breadth and generality of character is required.  There is\nanother type of character, which is not broad and general, rare,\nprecious above all to the artist, a character which seems to have\nbeen the supreme moral charm in the Beatrice of the [248] Commedia.\nIt does not take the eye by breadth of colour; rather it is that fine\nedge of light, where the elements of our moral nature refine\nthemselves to the burning point.  It crosses rather than follows the\nmain current of the world’s life.  The world has no sense fine enough\nfor those evanescent shades, which fill up the blanks between\ncontrasted types of character–delicate provision in the organisation\nof the moral world for the transmission to every part of it of the\nlife quickened at single points!  For this nature there is no place\nready in its affections.  This colourless, unclassified purity of\nlife it can neither use for its service, nor contemplate as an ideal.",
        "“Sibi unitus et simplificatus esse,” that is the long struggle of the\nImitatio Christi.  The spirit which it forms is the very opposite of\nthat which regards life as a game of skill, and values things and\npersons as marks or counters of something to be gained, or achieved,\nbeyond them.  It seeks to value everything at its eternal worth, not\nadding to it, or taking from it, the amount of influence it may have\nfor or against its own special scheme of life.  It is the spirit that\nsees external circumstances as they are, its own power and tendencies\nas they are, and realises the given conditions of its life, not\ndisquieted by the desire for change, or the preference of one part in\nlife rather than another, or passion, or opinion.  The character we\nmean to indicate achieves this [249] perfect life by a happy gift of\nnature, without any struggle at all.  Not the saint only, the artist\nalso, and the speculative thinker, confused, jarred, disintegrated in\nthe world, as sometimes they inevitably are, aspire for this\nsimplicity to the last.  The struggle of this aspiration with a lower\npractical aim in the mind of Savonarola has been subtly traced by the\nauthor of Romola.  As language, expression, is the function of\nintellect, as art, the supreme expression, is the highest product of\nintellect, so this desire for simplicity is a kind of indirect self-\nassertion of the intellectual part of such natures.  Simplicity in\npurpose and act is a kind of determinate expression in dexterous\noutline of one’s personality.  It is a kind of moral expressiveness;\nthere is an intellectual triumph implied in it.  Such a simplicity is\ncharacteristic of the repose of perfect intellectual culture.  The\nartist and he who has treated life in the spirit of art desires only\nto be shown to the world as he really is; as he comes nearer and\nnearer to perfection, the veil of an outer life not simply expressive\nof the inward becomes thinner and thinner.  This intellectual throne\nis rarely won.  Like the religious life, it is a paradox in the\nworld, denying the first conditions of man’s ordinary existence,\ncutting obliquely the spontaneous order of things.  But the character\nwe have before us is a kind of prophecy of this repose and\nsimplicity, coming as it were in the order of grace, not of nature,\nby [250] some happy gift, or accident of birth or constitution,\nshowing that it is indeed within the limits of man’s destiny.  Like\nall the higher forms of inward life this character is a subtle\nblending and interpenetration of intellectual, moral and spiritual\nelements.  But it is as a phase of intellect, of culture, that it is\nmost striking and forcible.  It is a mind of taste lighted up by some\nspiritual ray within.  What is meant by taste is an imperfect\nintellectual state; it is but a sterile kind of culture.  It is the\nmental attitude, the intellectual manner of perfect culture, assumed\nby a happy instinct.  Its beautiful way of handling everything that\nappeals to the senses and the intellect is really directed by the\nlaws of the higher intellectual life, but while culture is able to\ntrace those laws, mere taste is unaware of them.  In the character\nbefore us, taste, without ceasing to be instructive, is far more than\na mental attitude or manner.  A magnificent intellectual force is\nlatent within it.  It is like the reminiscence of a forgotten culture\nthat once adorned the mind; as if the mind of one philosophesas pote\nmet’ erotos,+ fallen into a new cycle, were beginning its spiritual\nprogress over again, but with a certain power of anticipating its\nstages.  It has the freshness without the shallowness of taste, the\nrange and seriousness of culture without its strain and over-\nconsciousness.  Such a habit may be described as wistfulness of mind,\nthe feeling that there is “so much to [251] know,” rather as a\nlonging after what is unattainable, than as a hope to apprehend.  Its\nethical result is an intellectual guilelessness, or integrity, that\ninstinctively prefers what is direct and clear, lest one’s own\nconfusion and intransparency should hinder the transmission from\nwithout of light that is not yet inward.  He who is ever looking for\nthe breaking of a light he knows not whence about him, notes with a\nstrange heedfulness the faintest paleness in the sky.  That\ntruthfulness of temper, that receptivity, which professors often\nstrive in vain to form, is engendered here less by wisdom than by\ninnocence.  Such a character is like a relic from the classical age,\nlaid open by accident to our alien modern atmosphere.  It has\nsomething of the clear ring, the eternal outline of the antique.\nPerhaps it is nearly always found with a corresponding outward\nsemblance.  The veil or mask of such a nature would be the very\nopposite of the “dim blackguardism” of Danton, the type Carlyle has\nmade too popular for the true interest of art.  It is just this sort\nof entire transparency of nature that lets through unconsciously all\nthat is really lifegiving in the established order of things; it\ndetects without difficulty all sorts of affinities between its own\nelements, and the nobler elements in that order.  But then its\nwistfulness and a confidence in perfection it has makes it love the\nlords of change.  What makes revolutionists is either self-pity, or\nindignation [252] for the sake of others, or a sympathetic perception\nof the dominant undercurrent of progress in things.  The nature\nbefore us is revolutionist from the direct sense of personal worth,\nthat chlide,+ that pride of life, which to the Greek was a heavenly\ngrace.  How can he value what comes of accident, or usage, or\nconvention, whose individual life nature itself has isolated and\nperfected?  Revolution is often impious.  They who prosecute\nrevolution have to violate again and again the instinct of reverence.\nThat is inevitable, since after all progress is a kind of violence.\nBut in this nature revolutionism is softened, harmonised, subdued as\nby distance.  It is the revolutionism of one who has slept a hundred\nyears.  Most of us are neutralised by the play of circumstances.  To\nmost of us only one chance is given in the life of the spirit and the\nintellect, and circumstances prevent our dexterously seizing that one\nchance.  The one happy spot in our nature has no room to burst into\nlife.  Our collective life, pressing equally on every part of every\none of us, reduces nearly all of us to the level of a colourless\nuninteresting existence.  Others are neutralised, not by suppression\nof gifts, but by just equipoise among them.  In these no single gift,\nor virtue, or idea, has an unmusical predominance.  The world easily\nconfounds these two conditions.  It sees in the character before us\nonly indifferentism.  Doubtless the chief vein of the life of\nhumanity [253] could hardly pass through it.  Not by it could the\nprogress of the world be achieved.  It is not the guise of Luther or\nSpinoza; rather it is that of Raphael, who in the midst of the\nReformation and the Renaissance, himself lighted up by them, yielded\nhimself to neither, but stood still to live upon himself, even in\noutward form a youth, almost an infant, yet surprising all the world.\nThe beauty of the Greek statues was a sexless beauty; the statues of\nthe gods had the least traces of sex.  Here there is a moral\nsexlessness, a kind of impotence, an ineffectual wholeness of nature,\nyet with a divine beauty and significance of its own.",
        "Over and over again the world has been surprised by the heroism, the\ninsight, the passion, of this clear crystal nature.  Poetry and\npoetical history have dreamed of a crisis, where it must needs be\nthat some human victim be sent down into the grave.  These are they\nwhom in its profound emotion humanity might choose to send.  “What,\"\nsays Carlyle, of Charlotte Corday, “What if she had emerged from her\nsecluded stillness, suddenly like a star; cruel-lovely, with half-\nangelic, half-daemonic splendour; to gleam for a moment, and in a\nmoment be extinguished; to be held in memory, so bright complete was\nshe, through long centuries!”",
        "Often the presence of this nature is felt like a sweet aroma in early\nmanhood.  Afterwards, as the adulterated atmosphere of the world\nassimilates [254] us to itself, the savour of it faints away.\nPerhaps there are flushes of it in all of us; recurring moments of it\nin every period of life.  Certainly this is so with every man of\ngenius.  It is a thread of pure white light that one might disentwine\nfrom the tumultuary richness of Goethe’s nature.  It is a natural\nprophecy of what the next generation will appear, renerved, modified\nby the ideas of this.  There is a violence, an impossibility about\nmen who have ideas, which makes one suspect that they could never be\nthe type of any widespread life.  Society could not be conformed to\ntheir image but by an unlovely straining from its true order.  Well,\nin this nature the idea appears softened, harmonised as by distance,\nwith an engaging naturalness, without the noise of axe or hammer.",
        "People have often tried to find a type of life that might serve as a\nbasement type.  The philosopher, the saint, the artist, neither of\nthem can be this type; the order of nature itself makes them\nexceptional.  It cannot be the pedant, or the conservative, or\nanything rash and irreverent.  Also the type must be one discontented\nwith society as it is.  The nature here indicated alone is worthy to\nbe this type.  A majority of such would be the regeneration of the\nworld.",
