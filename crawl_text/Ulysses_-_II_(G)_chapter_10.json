        "                7 HUNTER STREET, LIVERPOOL.\n        TO THE HIGH SHERIFF OF DUBLIN, DUBLIN.",
        "    HONOURED SIR I BEG TO OFFER MY SERVICES IN THE ABOVEMENTIONED PAINFUL\nCASE I HANGED JOE GANN IN BOOTLE JAIL ON THE 12 OF FEBUARY 1900 AND I\nHANGED ...",
        "–Show us, Joe, says I.",
        "– ... PRIVATE ARTHUR CHACE FOR FOWL MURDER OF JESSIE TILSIT IN\nPENTONVILLE PRISON AND I WAS ASSISTANT WHEN ...",
        "–Jesus, says I.",
        "– ... Billington Executed the Awful Murderer Toad Smith ...",
        "The citizen made a grab at the letter.",
        "–Hold hard, says Joe, I HAVE A SPECIAL NACK OF PUTTING THE NOOSE ONCE IN\nHE CAN’T GET OUT HOPING TO BE FAVOURED I REMAIN, HONOURED SIR, MY TERMS IS\nFIVE GINNEES.",
        "            H. RUMBOLD,\n                MASTER BARBER.",
        "–And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.",
        "–And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe. Here, says he, take them\nto hell out of my sight, Alf. Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?",
        "So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn’t\nand he couldn’t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said\nwell he’d just take a cigar. Gob, he’s a prudent member and no mistake.",
        "–Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.",
        "And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card\nwith a black border round it.",
        "–They’re all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang\ntheir own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.",
        "And he was telling us there’s two fellows waiting below to pull his\nheels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they\nchop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.",
        "In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor. Their\ndeadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever\nwight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so\nsaith the Lord.",
        "So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom\ncomes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the\nbusiness and the old dog smelling him all the time I’m told those jewies\ndoes have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don’t\nknow what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.",
        "–There’s one thing it hasn’t a deterrent effect on, says Alf.",
        "–What’s that? says Joe.",
        "–The poor bugger’s tool that’s being hanged, says Alf.",
        "–That so? says Joe.",
        "–God’s truth, says Alf. I heard that from the head warder that was in",
        "Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible. He told me when\nthey cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a\npoker.",
        "–Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.",
        "–That can be explained by science, says Bloom. It’s only a natural\nphenomenon, don’t you see, because on account of the ...",
        "And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and\nscience and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.",
        "The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft\ntendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of\nthe cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would,\naccording to the best approved tradition of medical science, be calculated\nto inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus\nof the nerve centres of the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic\npores of the CORPORA CAVERNOSA to rapidly dilate in such a way as to\ninstantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human\nanatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which\nhas been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards\nphiloprogenitive erection IN ARTICULO MORTIS PER DIMINUTIONEM CAPITIS.",
        "So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and\nhe starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and\nthe men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with\nhim about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the\ncause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that and\nthe other. Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so\nhe ought. Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place\nand scratching his scabs. And round he goes to Bob Doran that was\nstanding Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get. So of course Bob\nDoran starts doing the bloody fool with him:",
        "–Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw\nhere! Give us the paw!",
        "Arrah, bloody end to the paw he’d paw and Alf trying to keep him\nfrom tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he\ntalking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred\ndog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip. Then he starts scraping\na few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs’ tin he told Terry\nto bring. Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging\nout of him a yard long for more. Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody\nmongrel.",
        "And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the\nbrothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert\nEmmet and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara\nCurran and she’s far from the land. And Bloom, of course, with his\nknockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face. Phenomenon!\nThe fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a\nballalley. Time they were stopping up in the CITY ARMS pisser Burke told\nme there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and\nBloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing\nbezique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat\nof a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking\nthe lout out for a walk. And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and,\nby the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk\nas a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol\nand by herrings, if the three women didn’t near roast him, it’s a queer\nstory, the old one, Bloom’s wife and Mrs O’Dowd that kept the hotel.\nJesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat.\nAnd Bloom with his BUT DON’T YOU SEE? and BUT ON THE OTHER HAND. And sure,\nmore be token, the lout I’m told was in Power’s after, the blender’s,\nround in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week\nafter drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody\nestablishment. Phenomenon!",
        "–The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and\nglaring at Bloom.",
        "–Ay, ay, says Joe.",
        "–You don’t grasp my point, says Bloom. What I mean is ...",
        "–SINN FEIN! says the citizen. SINN FEIN AMHAIN! The friends we love are\nby our side and the foes we hate before us.",
        "The last farewell was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries far\nand near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the\ngloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums\npunctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. The deafening\nclaps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the\nghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its\nsupernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle. A torrential rain\npoured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads\nof the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five\nhundred thousand persons. A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police\nsuperintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in\nthe vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away\nthe intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped\ninstruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by\nSperanza’s plaintive muse. Special quick excursion trains and upholstered\ncharabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of\nwhom there were large contingents. Considerable amusement was caused\nby the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and M-ll-g-n who sang THE\nNIGHT BEFORE LARRY WAS STRETCHED in their usual mirth-provoking fashion.\nOur two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among\nlovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for\nreal Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned\npennies. The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who\nthronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this\nunexpected addition to the day’s entertainment and a word of praise is due\nto the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording\nthe poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat.\nThe viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was\nchaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the\ngrandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends\nof the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite.\nThe delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore\nBacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed DOYEN of the party who had\nto be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane),\nMonsieur Pierrepaul Petitepatant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire\nPokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von\nSchwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Viraga Kisaszony Putrapesthi,\nHiram Y. Bomboost, Count Athanatos Karamelopulos, Ali Baba Backsheesh\nRahat Lokum Effendi, Senor Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo y\nPalabras y Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria, Hokopoko Harakiri,\nHi Hung Chang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen, Mynheer Trik van Trumps,\nPan Poleaxe Paddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch,\nBorus Hupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans Chuechli-Steuerli,\nNationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocent-\ngeneralhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein.\nAll the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the\nstrongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless\nbarbarity which they had been called upon to witness. An animated\naltercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F. O. T. E. I.\nas to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct\ndate of the birth of Ireland’s patron saint. In the course of the\nargument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots,\nmeatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig\niron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged. The baby\npoliceman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from\nBooterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude\nproposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for\nboth contending parties. The readywitted ninefooter’s suggestion at once\nappealed to all and was unanimously accepted. Constable MacFadden was\nheartily congratulated by all the F.O.T.E.I., several of whom were\nbleeding profusely. Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated\nfrom underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal\nadviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his\nthirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the\npockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their\nsenses. The objects (which included several hundred ladies’ and\ngentlemen’s gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their\nrightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.",
        "Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless\nmorning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the GLADIOLUS CRUENTUS.\nHe announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so\nmany have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate–short, painstaking yet withal\nso characteristic of the man. The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman\nwas greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the\nviceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the\neven more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of\ncries, HOCH, BANZAI, ELJEN, ZIVIO, CHINCHIN, POLLA KRONIA, HIPHIP, VIVE,\nALLAH, amid which the ringing EVVIVA of the delegate of the land of song\n(a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the\neunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily\ndistinguishable. It was exactly seventeen o’clock. The signal for prayer\nwas then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were\nbared, the commendatore’s patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the\npossession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by\nhis medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi. The learned prelate who\nadministered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when\nabout to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool\nof rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the\nthrone of grace fervent prayers of supplication. Hand by the block stood\nthe grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a\ntengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which\nhis eyes glowered furiously. As he awaited the fatal signal he\ntested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his\nbrawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of\nsheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary\noffice. On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the\nquartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances\n(specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round\nand Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the\nduodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully\nextracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most\nprecious blood of the most precious victim. The housesteward of the\namalgamated cats’ and dogs’ home was in attendance to convey these\nvessels when replenished to that beneficent institution. Quite an\nexcellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions,\ndone to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had\nbeen considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption\nof the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits\nwhen prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the\nproceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare\nin these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the\ndying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be\ndivided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent\nroomkeepers’ association as a token of his regard and esteem. The NEC and\nNON PLUS ULTRA of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst\nher way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon\nthe muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for\nher sake. The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring\nfondly SHEILA, MY OWN. Encouraged by this use of her christian name she\nkissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the\ndecencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach. She swore to him\nas they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever\ncherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to\nhis death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling\nmatch in Clonturk park. She brought back to his recollection the happy\ndays of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they\nhad indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the\ndreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators,\nincluding the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment. That\nmonster audience simply rocked with delight. But anon they were overcome\nwith grief and clasped their hands for the last time. A fresh torrent of\ntears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people,\ntouched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least\naffected being the aged prebendary himself. Big strong men, officers of\nthe peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary,\nwere making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say\nthat there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage. A most\nromantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate,\nnoted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and,\npresenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree,\nsolicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to\nname the day, and was accepted on the spot. Every lady in the\naudience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion\nin the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous\nact which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant\nyoung Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured\nnames in Albion’s history) placed on the finger of his blushing FIANCEE\nan expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a\nfourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds. Nay, even the ster\n provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson,\nwho presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number\nof sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain\nhis natural emotion. With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive\ntear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be\nin his immediate ENTOURAGE, to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:",
        "–God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart. Blimey it\nmakes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause I\nthinks of my old mashtub what’s waiting for me down Limehouse way.",
        "So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the\ncorporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can’t speak\ntheir own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for\na quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that\nhe cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the\nantitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland. Antitreating\nis about the size of it. Gob, he’d let you pour all manner of drink\ndown his throat till the Lord would call him before you’d ever\nsee the froth of his pint. And one night I went in with a fellow\ninto one of their musical evenings, song and dance about she could\nget up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow\nwith a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot\nof colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals\nand oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh\nentertainment, don’t be talking. Ireland sober is Ireland free. And then\nan old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers\nshuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of. And one or two sky\npilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females,\nhitting below the belt.",
        "So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty\nstarts mousing around by Joe and me. I’d train him by kindness, so I\nwould, if he was my dog. Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where\nit wouldn’t blind him.",
        "–Afraid he’ll bite you? says the citizen, jeering.",
        "–No, says I. But he might take my leg for a lamppost.",
        "So he calls the old dog over.",
        "–What’s on you, Garry? says he.",
        "Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and\nthe old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera.\nSuch growling you never heard as they let off between them. Someone that\nhas nothing better to do ought to write a letter PRO BONO PUBLICO to the\npapers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that. Growling and\ngrousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the\nhydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.",
        "All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among\nthe lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not\nmissing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the\nfamous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the SOBRIQUET of\nGarryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and\nacquaintances Owen Garry. The exhibition, which is the result of years of\ntraining by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises,\namong other achievements, the recitation of verse. Our greatest living\nphonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stone\nunturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has\nfound it bears a STRIKING resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns\nof ancient Celtic bards. We are not speaking so much of those delightful\nlovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the\ngraceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the\nbookloving world but rather (as a contributor D. O. C. points out in an\ninteresting communication published by an evening contemporary) of the\nharsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions\nof the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more\nmodern lyrist at present very much in the public eye. We subjoin a\nspecimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar\nwhose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though\nwe believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather\nmore than an indication. The metrical system of the canine original,\nwhich recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of\nthe Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our\nreaders will agree that the spirit has been well caught. Perhaps\nit should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen’s\nverse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive\nof suppressed rancour.",
        "    THE CURSE OF MY CURSES\n    SEVEN DAYS EVERY DAY\n    AND SEVEN DRY THURSDAYS\n    ON YOU, BARNEY KIERNAN,\n    HAS NO SUP OF WATER\n    TO COOL MY COURAGE,\n    AND MY GUTS RED ROARING\n    AFTER LOWRY’S LIGHTS.",
        "So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could\nhear him lapping it up a mile off. And Joe asked him would he have\nanother.",
        "–I will, says he, A CHARA, to show there’s no ill feeling.",
        "Gob, he’s not as green as he’s cabbagelooking. Arsing around from\none pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap’s dog\nand getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators. Entertainment for\nman and beast. And says Joe:",
        "–Could you make a hole in another pint?",
        "–Could a swim duck? says I.",
        "–Same again, Terry, says Joe. Are you sure you won’t have anything in the\nway of liquid refreshment? says he.",
        "–Thank you, no, says Bloom. As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet\nMartin Cunningham, don’t you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam’s.\nMartin asked me to go to the house. You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn’t\nserve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and\nnominally under the act the mortgagee can’t recover on the policy.",
        "–Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that’s a good one if old Shylock is\nlanded. So the wife comes out top dog, what?",
        "–Well, that’s a point, says Bloom, for the wife’s admirers.",
        "–Whose admirers? says Joe.",
        "–The wife’s advisers, I mean, says Bloom.",
        "Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act\nlike the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of\nthe wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam\nowed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the\nmortgagee’s right till he near had the head of me addled with his\nmortgagor under the act. He was bloody safe he wasn’t run in himself under\nthe act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court.\nSelling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privileged\nlottery. True as you’re there. O, commend me to an israelite! Royal and\nprivileged Hungarian robbery.",
        "So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs\nDignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the\nfuneral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that\nthere was never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that’s dead to tell\nher. Choking with bloody foolery. And shaking Bloom’s hand doing the\ntragic to tell her that. Shake hands, brother. You’re a rogue and I’m\nanother.",
        "–Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however\nslight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded,\nas I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of\nyou this favour. But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve\nlet the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.",
        "–No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which\nactuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust\nto me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of\nsorrow, this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the\nbitterness of the cup.",
        "–Then suffer me to take your hand, said he. The goodness of your heart, I\nfeel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the\nexpressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose\npoignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of\nspeech.",
        "And off with him and out trying to walk straight. Boosed at five\no’clock. Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby,\n14A. Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing\ntime, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter\nout of teacups. And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph\nManuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving mass in\nAdam and Eve’s when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new\ntestament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging. And the two\nshawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody\nfool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls\nscreeching laughing at one another. HOW IS YOUR TESTAMENT? HAVE YOU\nGOT AN OLD TESTAMENT? Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what.\nThen see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and\nshe wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots\non her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady.\nJack Mooney’s sister. And the old prostitute of a mother\nprocuring rooms to street couples. Gob, Jack made him toe the line. Told\nhim if he didn’t patch up the pot, Jesus, he’d kick the shite out of him.",
        "So Terry brought the three pints.",
        "–Here, says Joe, doing the honours. Here, citizen.",
        "–SLAN LEAT, says he.",
        "–Fortune, Joe, says I. Good health, citizen.",
        "Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already. Want a\nsmall fortune to keep him in drinks.",
        "–Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf? says Joe.",
        "–Friend of yours, says Alf.",
        "–Nannan? says Joe. The mimber?",
        "–I won’t mention any names, says Alf.",
        "–I thought so, says Joe. I saw him up at that meeting now with William\nField, M. P., the cattle traders.",
        "–Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of all\ncountries and the idol of his own.",
        "So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and\nthe cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending\nthem all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the\nscab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy\nfor timber tongue. Because he was up one time in a knacker’s yard.\nWalking about with his book and pencil here’s my head and my heels are\ncoming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a\ngrazier. Mister Knowall. Teach your grandmother how to milk ducks.\nPisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of\ntears some times with Mrs O’Dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches\nof fat all over her. Couldn’t loosen her farting strings but old cod’s eye\nwas waltzing around her showing her how to do it. What’s your programme\ntoday? Ay. Humane methods. Because the poor animals suffer and experts\nsay and the best known remedy that doesn’t cause pain to the animal and\non the sore spot administer gently. Gob, he’d have a soft hand under a\nhen.",

        "A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of BRIAN\nO’CIARNAIN’S in SRAID NA BRETAINE BHEAG, under the auspices of SLUAGH NA\nH-EIREANN, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of\nphysical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and\nancient Ireland, for the development of the race. The venerable president\nof the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large\ndimensions. After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificent\noration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting and\ninstructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence\nensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient\ngames and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers. The\nwellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old\ntongue, Mr Joseph M’Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for\nthe resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes,\npractised morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the\nbest traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from\nancient ages. L. Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and\nhisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the\ndiscussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty\nplaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy\nrendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis’ evergreen verses (happily\ntoo familiar to need recalling here) A NATION ONCE AGAIN in the execution\nof which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of\ncontradiction to have fairly excelled himself. The Irish Caruso-Garibaldi\nwas in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the\ngreatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen\ncan sing it. His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality\ngreatly enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously\napplauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many\nprominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press\nand the bar and the other learned professions. The proceedings then\nterminated.",

        "It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were\nscheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns. Handicapped\nas he was by lack of poundage, Dublin’s pet lamb made up for it by\nsuperlative skill in ringcraft. The final bout of fireworks was a\ngruelling for both champions. The welterweight sergeantmajor had\ntapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh\nhad been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman\nputting in some neat work on the pet’s nose, and Myler came on\nlooking groggy. The soldier got to business, leading off with a\npowerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting\nout a stiff one flush to the point of Bennett’s jaw. The redcoat\nducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the body punch being\na fine one. The men came to handigrips. Myler quickly became busy and got\nhis man under, the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler\npunishing him. The Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took\nhis corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell\nwent came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the\nfistic Eblanite in jigtime. It was a fight to a finish and the best man\nfor it. The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high. The\nreferee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky\nand his footwork a treat to watch. After a brisk exchange of courtesies\nduring which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely\nfrom his opponent’s mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and\nlanded a terrific left to Battling Bennett’s stomach, flooring him flat.\nIt was a knockout clean and clever. Amid tense expectation the Portobello\nbruiser was being counted out when Bennett’s second Ole Pfotts Wettstein\nthrew in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied\ncheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him\nwith delight.",

        "–Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan.",
        "The fashionable international world attended EN MASSE this afternoon\nat the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief\nranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine\nValley. Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash,\nMrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs\nClyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss\nVirginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche\nMaple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla\nElderflower, Miss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa\nSan, Miss Rachel Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss\nTimidity Aspenall, Mrs Kitty Dewey-Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs\nGloriana Palme, Mrs Liana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs\nNorma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their\npresence. The bride who was given away by her father, the M’Conifer of\nthe Glands, looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green\nmercerised silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a\nyoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued\nfringe, the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn\nbronze. The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer,\nsisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same tone, a\ndainty MOTIF of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and\nrepeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron\nfeathers of paletinted coral. Senhor Enrique Flor presided at the\norgan with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed\nnumbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement\nof WOODMAN, SPARE THAT TREE at the conclusion of the service. On\nleaving the church of Saint Fiacre IN HORTO after the papal\nblessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire\nof hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod,\nhollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots. Mr and Mrs Wyse\nConifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.",
        "–And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen. We had our trade with\nSpain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were\npupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.",
        "–And will again, says Joe.",
        "–And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the\ncitizen, clapping his thigh. our harbours that are empty will be full\nagain, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom of\nKerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet\nof masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O’Reillys and the\nO’Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with\nthe emperor Charles the Fifth himself. And will again, says he, when the\nfirst Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to\nthe fore, none of your Henry Tudor’s harps, no, the oldest flag afloat,\nthe flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue\nfield, the three sons of Milesius.",
        "And he took the last swig out of the pint. Moya. All wind and piss like\na tanyard cat. Cows in Connacht have long horns. As much as his bloody\nlife is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled\nmultitude in Shanagolden where he daren’t show his nose with the Molly\nMaguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the\nholding of an evicted tenant.",
        "–Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse. What will you have?",
        "–An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.",
        "–Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up. Terry! Are you asleep?",
        "–Yes, sir, says Terry. Small whisky and bottle of Allsop. Right, sir.",
        " Hanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead\nof attending to the general public. Picture of a butting match, trying to\ncrack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his head down\nlike a bull at a gate. And another one: BLACK BEAST BURNED IN OMAHA, GA.\nA lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a Sambo strung\nup in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under him. Gob, they ought\nto drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure\nof their job.",
        "–But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay?",
        "–I’ll tell you what about it, says the citizen. Hell upon earth it is.\nRead the revelations that’s going on in the papers about flogging on the\ntraining ships at Portsmouth. A fellow writes that calls himself DISGUSTED\nONE.",
        "So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew\nof tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the\nparson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad\nbrought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a\ngun.",
        "–A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John\nBeresford called it but the modern God’s Englishman calls it caning on the\nbreech.",
        "And says John Wyse:",
        "–’Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.",
        "Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long\ncane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad\ntill he yells meila murder.",
        "–That’s your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the\nearth.",
        "The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber on\nthe face of God’s earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs\nand cottonball barons. That’s the great empire they boast about of drudges\nand whipped serfs.",
        "–On which the sun never rises, says Joe.",
        "–And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it. The\nunfortunate yahoos believe it.",
        "They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth,\nand in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast,\nborn of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified,\nflayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose again\nfrom the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till further\norders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.",
        "–But, says Bloom, isn’t discipline the same everywhere. I mean wouldn’t\nit be the same here if you put force against force?",
        "Didn’t I tell you? As true as I’m drinking this porter if he was at his\nlast gasp he’d try to downface you that dying was living.",
        "–We’ll put force against force, says the citizen. We have our greater\nIreland beyond the sea. They were driven out of house and home in the\nblack 47. Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid\nlow by the batteringram and the TIMES rubbed its hands and told the\nwhitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as\nredskins in America. Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres. But the\nSassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of\ncrops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro. Ay, they\ndrove out the peasants in hordes. Twenty thousand of them died in the\ncoffinships. But those that came to the land of the free remember the\nland of bondage. And they will come again and with a vengeance, no\ncravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.",
        "–Perfectly true, says Bloom. But my point was ...",
        "–We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned. Since the\npoor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at\nKillala.",
        "–Ay, says John Wyse. We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us\nagainst the Williamites and they betrayed us. Remember Limerick and the\nbroken treatystone. We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the wild\ngeese. Fontenoy, eh? And Sarsfield and O’Donnell, duke of Tetuan in\nSpain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa.\nBut what did we ever get for it?",
        "–The French! says the citizen. Set of dancing masters! Do you know what\nit is? They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland. Aren’t they\ntrying to make an ENTENTE CORDIALE now at Tay Pay’s dinnerparty with\nperfidious Albion? Firebrands of Europe and they always were.",
        "–CONSPUEZ LES FRANCAIS, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.",
        "–And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven’t we had\nenough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the\nelector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that’s dead?",
        "Jesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one\nwith the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of\nGod, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her\nup body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers\nand singing him old bits of songs about EHREN ON THE RHINE and come where\nthe boose is cheaper.",
        "–Well, says J. J. We have Edward the peacemaker now.",
        "–Tell that to a fool, says the citizen. There’s a bloody sight more pox\nthan pax about that boyo. Edward Guelph-Wettin!",
        "–And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and\nbishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic Majesty’s\nracing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys\nrode. The earl of Dublin, no less.",
        "–They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little\nAlf.",
        "And says J. J.:",
        "–Considerations of space influenced their lordships’ decision.",
        "–Will you try another, citizen? says Joe.",

        "–Repeat that dose, says Joe.",
        "Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with\nhis dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about.",
        "–Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it.\nPerpetuating national hatred among nations.",
        "–But do you know what a nation means? says John Wyse.",
        "–Yes, says Bloom.",
        "–What is it? says John Wyse.",
        "–A nation? says Bloom. A nation is the same people living in the same\nplace.",
        "–By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that’s so I’m a nation for I’m\nliving in the same place for the past five years.",
        "So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to\nmuck out of it:",
        "–Or also living in different places.",
        "–That covers my case, says Joe.",
        "–What is your nation if I may ask? says the citizen.",
        "–Ireland, says Bloom. I was born here. Ireland.",
        "The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and,\ngob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.",
        "–After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to\nswab himself dry.",
        "–Here you are, citizen, says Joe. Take that in your right hand and repeat\nafter me the following words.",
        "The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish\nfacecloth attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og\nMacDonogh, authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully\nproduced and called forth prolonged admiration. No need to dwell on the\nlegendary beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can\ndistinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each\nof the four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North\nAmerican puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it\nsaid in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill. The\nscenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths\nand cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones,\nare as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the\nSligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago\nin the time of the Barmecides.

        "–Show us over the drink, says I. Which is which?",
        "–That’s mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.",

        "–But it’s no use, says he. Force, hatred, history, all that. That’s not\nlife for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that it’s\nthe very opposite of that that is really life.",
        "–What? says Alf.",
        "–Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred. I must go now, says he\nto John Wyse. Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is there.\nIf he comes just say I’ll be back in a second. Just a moment.",
        "Who’s hindering you? And off he pops like greased lightning.",
        "–A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen. Universal love.",

The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion\nof which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech,\nfreely translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias\nPraisegod Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and\nemphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the\nBritish empire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearest\npossessions an illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God\nand the secret of England’s greatness, graciously presented to him by\nthe white chief woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal\ndedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor. The Alaki then drank a\nlovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast BLACK AND WHITE from the\nskull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak,\nsurnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of\nCottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors’ book, subsequently\nexecuting a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he\nswallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl\nhands.",
        "–Widow woman, says Ned. I wouldn’t doubt her. Wonder did he put that\nbible to the same use as I would.",
        "–Same only more so, says Lenehan. And thereafter in that fruitful land\nthe broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.",
        "–Is that by Griffith? says John Wyse.",

        "–Well, says J. J., if they’re any worse than those Belgians in the Congo\nFree State they must be bad. Did you read that report by a man what’s this\nhis name is?",
        "–Casement, says the citizen. He’s an Irishman.",
        "–Yes, that’s the man, says J. J. Raping the women and girls and flogging\nthe natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of\nthem.",
        "–I know where he’s gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.",
        "–Who? says I.",
        "–Bloom, says he. The courthouse is a blind. He had a few bob on\nTHROWAWAY and he’s gone to gather in the shekels.",
        "–Is it that whiteeyed kaffir? says the citizen, that never backed a horse\nin anger in his life?",
        "–That’s where he’s gone, says Lenehan. I met Bantam Lyons going to back\nthat horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip.\nBet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on. He’s the only\nman in Dublin has it. A dark horse.",
        "–He’s a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.",
        "–Mind, Joe, says I. Show us the entrance out.",
        "–There you are, says Terry.",
        "Goodbye Ireland I’m going to Gort.

Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Gob, that puts\nthe bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show. Give us\na bloody chance. God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody\nmouseabout. Mr Bloom with his argol bargol. And his old fellow before him\nperpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that\npoisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country with\nhis baubles and his penny diamonds.

        "–Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare\nlarder. I know not what to offer your lordships.",
        "–How now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant\ncountenance, So servest thou the king’s messengers, master Taptun?",
        "An instantaneous change overspread the landlord’s visage.",
        "–Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly. An you be the king’s\nmessengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught. The\nking’s friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my house\nI warrant me.",
        "–Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trencherman\nby his aspect. Hast aught to give us?",
        "Mine host bowed again as he made answer:",
        "–What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of\nvenison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog’s bacon, a boar’s head\nwith pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon of\nold Rhenish?",
        "–Gadzooks! cried the last speaker. That likes me well. Pistachios!",
        "–Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance. A poor house and a bare\nlarder, quotha! ’Tis a merry rogue.",
        "So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.",

        "–Isn’t he a cousin of Bloom the dentist? says Jack Power.",
        "–Not at all, says Martin. Only namesakes. His name was Virag, the\nfather’s name that poisoned himself. He changed it by deedpoll, the father\ndid.",
        "–That’s the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen. Island of saints\nand sages!",
        "–Well, they’re still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin. For that\nmatter so are we.",
        "–Yes, says J. J., and every male that’s born they think it may be their\nMessiah. And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, till\nhe knows if he’s a father or a mother.",
        "–Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.",
        "–O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his\nthat died was born. I met him one day in the south city markets buying a\ntin of Neave’s food six weeks before the wife was delivered.",
        "–EN VENTRE SA MERE, says J. J.",
        "–Do you call that a man? says the citizen.",

        "–And who does he suspect? says the citizen.",
        "Gob, there’s many a true word spoken in jest. One of those mixed\nmiddlings he is. Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a month\nwith headache like a totty with her courses. Do you know what I’m telling\nyou? It’d be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and\nthrow him in the bloody sea. Justifiable homicide, so it would.

The ceremony which went off with great ECLAT was\ncharacterised by the most affecting cordiality. An illuminated scroll of\nancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to the\ndistinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the\ncommunity and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully\nexecuted in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects\nevery credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob AGUS Jacob. The departing guest\nwas the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present\nbeing visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the\nwellknown strains of COME BACK TO ERIN, followed immediately by RAKOCZSY’S\nMARCH. Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the four\nseas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf,\nBray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and\nSperrin peaks, the Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks\nof M Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom.

The epicentre appears to have\nbeen that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn’s Quay\nward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres,\ntwo roods and one square pole or perch. All the lordly residences in\nthe vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble\nedifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important\nlegal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath\nwhich it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive.\nFrom the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves\nwere accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic\ncharacter.

        "The three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening\nscene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly.

Belleisle printed on both. For Tommy and\nJacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled\ntwins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry\nfaces and endearing ways about them. They were dabbling in the sand with\ntheir spades and buckets, building castles as children do, or playing with\ntheir big coloured ball, happy as the day was long. And Edy Boardman was\nrocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young\ngentleman fairly chuckled with delight. He was but eleven months and nine\ndays old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his\nfirst babyish words. Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat\nlittle plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin.",
        "–Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said. Say out big, big. I want a drink of\nwater.",
        "And baby prattled after her:",
        "–A jink a jink a jawbo.",
        "Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children,\nso patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to\ntake his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and\npromised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup\non. What a persuasive power that girl had! But to be sure baby Boardman\nwas as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib. None of\nyour spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort, was Cissy Caffrey.\nA truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always with a laugh in\nher gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips, a\ngirl lovable in the extreme. And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaint\nlanguage of little brother.",
        "But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy\nand Master Jacky. Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception\nto this golden rule. The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand\nwhich Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrong\nthat it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the\nMartello tower had. But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was\nselfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman’s house\nis his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the\nwouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castle\ntoo. Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the\nattention of the girl friends.",
        "–Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively. At once! And you,\nJacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand. Wait till I catch\nyou for that.",
        "His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for\ntheir big sister’s word was law with the twins. And in a sad plight he was\ntoo after his misadventure. His little man-o’-war top and unmentionables\nwere full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing\nover life’s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was\nto be seen on his smart little suit. Still the blue eyes were glistening\nwith hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and\nshook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was near\nhim she wouldn’t be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition.",
        "–Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.",
        "She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:",
        "–What’s your name? Butter and cream?",

        "–Nao, tearful Tommy said.",
        "–Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart? Cissy queried.",
        "–Nao, Tommy said.",
        "–I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from\nher shortsighted eyes. I know who is Tommy’s sweetheart. Gerty is\nTommy’s sweetheart.",
        "–Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.",
        "Cissy’s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered\nto Edy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the\ngentleman couldn’t see and to mind he didn’t wet his new tan shoes.",
        "But who was Gerty?",
        "Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in\nthought, gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a\nspecimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see. She was\npronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she\nwas more a Giltrap than a MacDowell. Her figure was slight and graceful,\ninclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of\nlate had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welch’s\nfemale pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get\nand that tired feeling. The waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual\nin its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine Cupid’s\nbow, Greekly perfect. Her hands were of finely veined alabaster\nwith tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments\ncould make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves\nin bed or take a milk footbath either. Bertha Supple told that once\nto Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers\ndrawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs\nfrom time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to\nlet on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she’d never\nspeak to her again. No. Honour where honour is due. There was an\ninnate refinement, a languid queenly HAUTEUR about Gerty which\nwas unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep.\nHad kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in\nher own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education\nGerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the\nland and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and\npatrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs\nto her. Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to\nher softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning,\nthat imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm\nfew could resist. Why have women such eyes of witchery? Gerty’s were of\nthe bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive\nbrows. Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive. It was\nMadame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the Princess\nNovelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that\nhaunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders of fashion, and\nshe had never regretted it. Then there was blushing scientifically cured\nand how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but\nyour nose? That would suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one. But\nGerty’s crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair. It was dark brown\nwith a natural wave in it. She had cut it that very morning on account\nof the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of\nluxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth. And just\nnow at Edy’s words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest\nrosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish\nshyness that of a surety God’s fair land of Ireland did not hold\nher equal.",
        "For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes. She was\nabout to retort but something checked the words on her tongue. Inclination\nprompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent. The pretty lips\npouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little\nlaugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning. She knew\nright well, no-one better, what made squinty Edy say that because of him\ncooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers’ quarrel. As per\nusual somebody’s nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle\noff the London bridge road always riding up and down in front of her\nwindow. Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying\nhard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was\ngoing to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he left\nthe high school like his brother W. E. Wylie who was racing in the\nbicycle races in Trinity college university. Little recked he perhaps\nfor what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes,\npiercing to the core. Yet he was young and perchance he might\nlearn to love her in time. They were protestants in his family\nand of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed\nVirgin and then Saint Joseph. But he was undeniably handsome with an\nexquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the\nshape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know\nanywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at\nthe lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those\ngood cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and\nthat was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because\nhe didn’t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden.",
        "Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of\nDame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be\nout. A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because it\nwas expected in the LADY’S PICTORIAL that electric blue would be worn)\nwith a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket\n(in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her\nfavourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a\nnavy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful\nfigure to perfection. She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of\nwideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue\nchenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone. All Tuesday\nweek afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last\nshe found what she wanted at Clery’s summer sales, the very it, slightly\nshopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny. She\ndid it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then,\nsmiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her!\nAnd when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that\nwould take the shine out of some people she knew. Her shoes were the\nnewest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very\nPETITE but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never\nwould ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over\nher higharched instep. Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect\nproportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of\nher shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide\ngarter tops. As for undies they were Gerty’s chief care and who that knows\nthe fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though Gerty would\nnever see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to blame her? She had\nfour dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery, three garments and\nnighties extra, and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons,\nrosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen, and she aired them herself\nand blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them\nand she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn’t trust\nthose washerwomen as far as she’d see them scorching the things.\nShe was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own\ncolour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere\non her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because\nhis father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition\nand because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was\ndressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out\nand that was for luck and lovers’ meeting if you put those things on\ninside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long\nas it wasn’t of a Friday.",
        "And yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is\nthere all the time. Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds\nto be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving way to\ntears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelingsthough not\ntoo much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror. You are\nlovely, Gerty, it said. The paly light of evening falls upon a face\ninfinitely sad and wistful. Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain. Yes, she had\nknown from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been\narranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T. C. D.\n(because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie) and in\nthe fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuous\nconfection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be. He was\ntoo young to understand. He would not believe in love, a woman’s\nbirthright. The night of the party long ago in Stoer’s (he was still in\nshort trousers) when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist\nshe went white to the very lips. He called her little one in a strangely\nhusky voice and snatched a half kiss (the first!) but it was only the end\nof her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about\nrefreshments. Impetuous fellow! Strength of character had never been Reggy\nWylie’s strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be\na man among men. But waiting, always waiting to be asked and it was leap\nyear too and would soon be over. No prince charming is her beau ideal to\nlay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a\nstrong quiet face who had not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly\nflecked with grey, and who would understand, take her in his sheltering\narms, strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature\nand comfort her with a long long kiss. It would be like heaven. For such\na one she yearns this balmy summer eve. With all the heart of her she\nlongs to be his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness\nin health, till death us two part, from this to this day forward.",
        "And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was\njust thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his\nlittle wife to be. Then they could talk about her till they went blue in\nthe face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she would\nbe twentytwo in November. She would care for him with creature comforts\ntoo for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that\nfeeling of hominess. Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and\nqueen Ann’s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from\nall because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge in the\nfine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction, then cream\nthe milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn’t like\nthe eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she\nwondered why you couldn’t eat something poetical like violets or roses and\nthey would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and\nengravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap’s lovely dog\nGarryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the\nchairs and that silver toastrack in Clery’s summer jumble sales like they\nhave in rich houses. He would be tall with broad shoulders (she had always\nadmired tall men for a husband) with glistening white teeth under his\ncarefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent\nfor their honeymoon (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled\ndown in a nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they\nwould both have brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two\nselves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little\nwifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes.",
        "Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so\nthen she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run\noff and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight. But Tommy\nsaid he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the\nball and if he took it there’d be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was\nhis ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if you\nplease. The temper of him! O, he was a man already was little Tommy\nCaffrey since he was out of pinnies. Edy told him no, no and to be off now\nwith him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.",
        "–You’re not my sister, naughty Tommy said. It’s my ball.",
        "But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her\nfinger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and\nTommy after it in full career, having won the day.",
        "–Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.",
        "And she tickled tiny tot’s two cheeks to make him forget and played here’s\nthe lord mayor, here’s his two horses, here’s his gingerbread carriage\nand here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper chin. But Edy\ngot as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from\neveryone always petting him.",
        "–I’d like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won’t say.",
        "–On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.",
        "Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy\nsaying an unladylike thing like that out loud she’d be ashamed of her\nlife to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was sure\nthe gentleman opposite heard what she said. But not a pin cared Ciss.",
        "–Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her\nnose. Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I’d look at him.",
        "Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls. You had to laugh at her\nsometimes. For instance when she asked you would you have some more\nChinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men’s\nfaces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she\nwanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to\nthe Miss White. That was just like Cissycums. O, and will you ever forget\nher the evening she dressed up in her father’s suit and hat and the burned\ncork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette.\nThere was none to come up to her for fun. But she was sincerity itself,\none of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made, not one of your\ntwofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome.",
        "And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the\npealing anthem of the organ. It was the men’s temperance retreat conducted\nby the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S. J., rosary, sermon and\nbenediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament. They were there gathered\ntogether without distinction of social class (and a most edifying\nspectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves,\nafter the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of\nthe immaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto,\nbeseeching her to intercede for them, the old familiar words,\nholy Mary, holy virgin of virgins. How sad to poor Gerty’s ears!\nHad her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink, by\ntaking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in Pearson’s\nWeekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage, second to none. Over and\nover had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown\nstudy without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing\nout of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty\nbucket, thinking. But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths\nand homes had cist its shadow over her childhood days. Nay, she had even\nwitnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and\nhad seen her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget\nhimself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty\nknew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of\nkindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.",
        "And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful,\nVirgin most merciful. And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard her\ncompanions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off\nSandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like\nhimself passing along the strand taking a short walk. You never saw him\nany way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a\nfather because he was too old or something or on account of his face (it\nwas a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the pimples\non it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose. Poor father!\nWith all his faults she loved him still when he sang TELL ME, MARY, HOW TO\nWOO THEE or MY LOVE AND COTTAGE NEAR ROCHELLE and they had stewed cockles\nand lettuce with Lazenby’s salad dressing for supper and when he sang THE\nMOON HATH RAISED with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried, God\nhave mercy on him, from a stroke. Her mother’s birthday that was and\nCharley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs and\nPatsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group taken.\nNo-one would have thought the end was so near. Now he was laid to rest.\nAnd her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of\nhis days and he couldn’t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and\nshe had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his\noffice about Catesby’s cork lino, artistic, standard designs, fit for a\npalace, gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home.",
        "A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the house,\na ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold.\nAnd when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it\nrubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn’t like\nher mother’s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing\nthey ever had words about, taking snuff. Everyone thought the world of her\nfor her gentle ways. It was Gerty who turned off the gas at the main every\nnight and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she\nnever forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocer’s\nchristmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in\nthe costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a\nbunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice\nwindow. You could see there was a story behind it. The colours were done\nsomething lovely. She was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude\nand the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat.\nShe often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain\npurpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with\nthe sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out\nin Walker’s pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap\nabout the halcyon days what they meant.",
        "The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at\nlast Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting\nbehind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down\ntowards the seaweedy rocks. Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow to\nvoice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there\nby himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball. Our two\nchampions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble\nCissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please. The\ngentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand\ntowards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under\nGerty’s skirt near the little pool by the rock. The twins clamoured again\nfor it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so\nGerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn’t come\nrolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy\nlaughed.",
        "–If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.",
        "Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip. A delicate pink crept into her\npretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her\nskirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly\ngood kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards\nthe shingle. Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention\non account of the gentleman opposite looking. She felt the warm flush, a\ndanger signal always with Gerty MacDowell, surging and flaming into her\ncheeks. Till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but\nnow under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face\nthat met her gaze there in the twilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed\nto her the saddest she had ever seen.",
        "Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and\nwith it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of\noriginal sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray for\nus, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose. And careworn\nhearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred\nand wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with\nhope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told them what the great\nsaint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary, the most pious Virgin’s\nintercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who\nimplored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her.",
        "The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of\nchildhood are but as fleeting summer showers. Cissy Caffrey played with\nbaby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air. Peep\nshe cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy\ngone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my word,\ndidn’t the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say papa.",
        "–Say papa, baby. Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.",
        "And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for\neleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health,\na perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out to be\nsomething great, they said.",
        "–Haja ja ja haja.",
        "Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit\nup properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out,\nholy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket\nthe other way under him. Of course his infant majesty was most\nobstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it:",
        "–Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.",
        "And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks. It was all no\nuse soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the\ngeegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave him\nin his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was\nquickly appeased.",
        "Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of\nthat and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little brats\nof twins. She gazed out towards the distant sea. It was like the paintings\nthat man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such\na pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the evening and the\nclouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music like\nthat and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a\nkind of waft. And while she gazed her heart went pitapat. Yes, it was her\nhe was looking at, and there was meaning in his look. His eyes burned into\nher as though they would search her through and through, read her very\nsoul. Wonderful eyes they were, superbly expressive, but could you trust\nthem? People were so queer. She could see at once by his dark eyes and his\npale intellectual face that he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she\nhad of Martin Harvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she\npreferred because she wasn’t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that\nwanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she\ncould not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly RETROUSSE from\nwhere he was sitting. He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the\nstory of a haunting sorrow was written on his face. She would have given\nworlds to know what it was. He was looking up so intently, so still, and\nhe saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles\nof her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down.\nShe was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings\nthinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away. Here was that of\nwhich she had so often dreamed. It was he who mattered and there was joy\non her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he\nwas like no-one else. The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him, her\ndreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him. If he had\nsuffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had been\nhimself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not. Even if he was a protestant\nor methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her. There\nwere wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm. She was a womanly woman\nnot like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known, those cyclists\nshowing off what they hadn’t got and she just yearned to know all, to\nforgive all if she could make him fall in love with her, make him forget\nthe memory of the past. Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a\nreal man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie,\nfor herself alone.",
        "Refuge of sinners. Comfortress of the afflicted. ORA PRO NOBIS. Well\nhas it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can\nnever be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the\nafflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart.\nGerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the stained glass\nwindows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue banners of the\nblessed Virgin’s sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon O’Hanlon at\nthe altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down. He looked\nalmost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and\nhis hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a Dominican nun\nin their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena\nof Saint Dominic. He told her that time when she told him about that in\nconfession, crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see,\nnot to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were\nall subject to nature’s laws, he said, in this life and that that was no\nsin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God, he said,\nand that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done\nunto me according to Thy Word. He was so kind and holy and often and often\nshe thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered\nfloral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she\nnoticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out\nof a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the\nflowers for the forty hours’ adoration because it was hard to know what\nsort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of\nDublin or some place.",
        "The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky\nthrew the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it. Little\nmonkeys common as ditchwater. Someone ought to take them and give them\na good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of\nthem. And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they\nwere afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.",
        "–Jacky! Tommy!",
        "Not they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very\nlast time she’d ever bring them out. She jumped up and called them and she\nran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had a good\nenough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry\nshe was always rubbing into it she couldn’t get it to grow long because it\nwasn’t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it. She ran\nwith long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn’t rip up her skirt at\nthe side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy\nabout Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought\nshe had a good opportunity to show and just because she was a good runner\nshe ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat\nrunning and her skinny shanks up as far as possible. It would have\nserved her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally\non purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to make her look\ntall and got a fine tumble. TABLEAU! That would have been a very charming\nexpose for a gentleman like that to witness.",
        "Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints,\nthey prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed\nthe thurible to Canon O’Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the\nBlessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was\nitching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn’t because\nshe thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in\nall her life because Gerty could see without looking that he never\ntook his eyes off of her and then Canon O’Hanlon handed the thurible\nback to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed Sacrament\nand the choir began to sing the TANTUM ERGO and she just swung her foot\nin and out in time as the music rose and fell to the TANTUMER GOSA\nCRAMEN TUM. Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in Sparrow’s\nof George’s street on the Tuesday, no the Monday before Easter and there\nwasn’t a brack on them and that was what he was looking at, transparent,\nand not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form\n(the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his head to see the difference\nfor himself.",
        "Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with\nher hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel\ntugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a\nfortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging\nlike a caricature. Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her\nhair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on\na girl’s shoulders–a radiant little vision, in sooth, almost maddening in\nits sweetness. You would have to travel many a long mile before you found\na head of hair the like of that. She could almost see the swift answering\nflash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve.\nShe put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and\nswung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the\nexpression in his eyes. He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey. Her\nwoman’s instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the\nthought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour\nof her face became a glorious rose.",
        "Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty,\nhalf smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the\nbaby. Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why\nno-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of\nhers. And she said to Gerty:",
        "–A penny for your thoughts.",
        "–What? replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth.\nI was only wondering was it late.",
        "Because she wished to goodness they’d take the snottynosed twins and their\nbabby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a\ngentle hint about its being late. And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the\ntime and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half past kissing\ntime, time to kiss again. But Edy wanted to know because they were told to\nbe in early.",
        "–Wait, said Cissy, I’ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what’s the time\nby his conundrum.",
        "So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his\nhand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his\nwatchchain, looking up at the church. Passionate nature though he was\nGerty could see that he had enormous control over himself. One moment he\nhad been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the\nnext moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed\nin every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.",
        "Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the\nright time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it\nand looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his\nwatch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun\nwas set. His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in\nmeasured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones.\nCissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said\nhis waterworks were out of order.",
        "Then they sang the second verse of the TANTUM ERGO and Canon\nO’Hanlon got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and\nhe told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire\nto the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she\ncould see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and\nshe swung her leg more in and out in time. It was getting darker but he\ncould see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or\nwhatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back\ninto his pockets. She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and\nshe knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays\nthat that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she\nclipped her hair on account of the moon. His dark eyes fixed themselves\non her again drinking in her every contour, literally worshipping at her\nshrine. If ever there was undisguised admiration in a man’s passionate\ngaze it was there plain to be seen on that man’s face. It is for you,\nGertrude MacDowell, and you know it.",
        "Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty\nnoticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because\nit was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up\nthe pushcar and Cissy took off the twins’ caps and tidied their hair to\nmake herself attractive of course and Canon O’Hanlon stood up with his\ncope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to read\noff and he read out PANEM DE COELO PRAESTITISTI EIS and Edy and Cissy were\ntalking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could pay\nthem back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness\nwhen Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her\nover. Gerty winced sharply. A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that\nspoke volumes of scorn immeasurable. It hurt–O yes, it cut deep because\nEdy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound\nlike the confounded little cat she was. Gerty’s lips parted swiftly to\nframe the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat,\nso slim, so flawless, so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist\nmight have dreamed of. She had loved him better than he knew.\nLighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never\nunderstand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was\nin the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears. Their eyes were\nprobing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in\nsympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see.",
        "–O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head\nflashed up. I can throw my cap at who I like because it’s leap year.",
        "Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the\nringdove, but they cut the silence icily. There was that in her young\nvoice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with.\nAs for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just\nchuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she\ncast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard\ninto a dozen pieces. And if ever after he dared to presume she\ncould give him one look of measured scorn that would make him\nshrivel up on the spot. Miss puny little Edy’s countenance fell to\nno slight extent and Gerty could see by her looking as black as\nthunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it, the\nlittle kinnatt, because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy\nand they both knew that she was something aloof, apart, in another sphere,\nthat she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else\ntoo that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe\nand smoke it.",
        "Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy\ntucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too\nbecause the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior. And\nCissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go\ndeedaw and baby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful\neyes, and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and\nbaby, without as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all\nand sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib.",
        "–O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss. He has his bib destroyed.",
        "The slight CONTRETEMPS claimed her attention but in two twos she set\nthat little matter to rights.",
        "Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and\nEdy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was\nflying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it\noff with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because\njust then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore\nbecause Canon O’Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that Father\nConroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the Blessed\nSacrament in his hands.",
        "How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse of\nErin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat\nflew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither, thither, with a\ntiny lost cry. And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so\npicturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was\neasier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his\nrounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady\nTritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her\nwindow where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that\nbook THE LAMPLIGHTER by Miss Cummins, author of MABEL VAUGHAN and\nother tales. For Gerty had her dreams that no-one knew of. She loved to\nread poetry and when she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely\nconfession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she\nlaid it in the drawer of her toilettable which, though it did not err\non the side of luxury, was scrupulously neat and clean. It was there\nshe kept her girlish treasure trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her\nchild of Mary badge, the whiterose scent, the eyebrowleine, her\nalabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came\nhome from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written\nin it in violet ink that she bought in Hely’s of Dame Street for\nshe felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express\nherself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had\ncopied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs. ART\nTHOU REAL, MY IDEAL? it was called by Louis J Walsh, Magherafelt, and\nafter there was something about TWILIGHT, WILT THOU EVER? and ofttimes\nthe beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient loveliness, had misted\nher eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping\nby for her, one by one, and but for that one shortcoming she knew she\nneed fear no competition and that was an accident coming down Dalkey\nhill and she always tried to conceal it. But it must end, she felt.\nIf she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding\nback for her. Love laughs at locksmiths. She would make the great\nsacrifice. Her every effort would be to share his thoughts. Dearer than\nthe whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness.\nThere was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a\nmarried man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the\nnobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put\ninto a madhouse, cruel only to be kind. But even if–what then? Would it\nmake a very great difference? From everything in the least indelicate her\nfinebred nature instinctively recoiled. She loathed that sort of person,\nthe fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went\nwith the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl’s honour,\ndegrading the sex and being taken up to the police station. No, no: not\nthat. They would be just good friends like a big brother and sister\nwithout all that other in spite of the conventions of Society with a big\ness. Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days\nbeyond recall. She thought she understood. She would try to understand\nhim because men were so different. The old love was waiting, waiting\nwith little white hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes. Heart\nof mine! She would follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart\nthat told her he was her all in all, the only man in all the world\nfor her for love was the master guide. Nothing else mattered. Come what\nmight she would be wild, untrammelled, free.",
        "Canon O’Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle\nand genuflected and the choir sang LAUDATE DOMINUM OMNES GENTES and\nthen he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and\nFather Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasn’t\nshe coming but Jacky Caffrey called out:",
        "–O, look, Cissy!",
        "And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over\nthe trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.",
        "–It’s fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.",
        "And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the\nchurch, helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and\nCissy holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn’t fall running.",
        "–Come on, Gerty, Cissy called. It’s the bazaar fireworks.",
        "But Gerty was adamant. She had no intention of being at their beck and\ncall. If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could\nsee from where she was. The eyes that were fastened upon her set\nher pulses tingling. She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance,\nand a light broke in upon her. Whitehot passion was in that face, passion\nsilent as the grave, and it had made her his. At last they were left\nalone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he\ncould be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of\ninflexible honour to his fingertips. His hands and face were working\nand a tremour went over her. She leaned back far to look up where\nthe fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not\nto fall back looking up and there was no-one to see only him and\nher when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that,\nsupply soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting\nof his heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passion\nof men like that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead\nsecret and made her swear she’d never about the gentleman lodger that was\nstaying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had pictures\ncut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he\nused to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in\nthe bed. But this was altogether different from a thing like that\nbecause there was all the difference because she could almost feel\nhim draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his\nhandsome lips. Besides there was absolution so long as you didn’t\ndo the other thing before being married and there ought to be\nwomen priests that would understand without your telling out and\nCissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look\nin her eyes so that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad\nabout actors’ photographs and besides it was on account of that other\nthing coming on the way it did.",
        "And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back\nand the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they\nall saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was and she leaned\nback ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying\nthrough the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark. And she saw a long Roman\ncandle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in the tense hush,\nthey were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher\nand she had to lean back more and more to look up after it, high,\nhigh, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with a divine,\nan entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other\nthings too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the skin,\nbetter than those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven,\non account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then\nit went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in\nevery limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view\nhigh up above her knee where no-one ever not even on the swing or wading\nand she wasn’t ashamed and he wasn’t either to look in that immodest way\nlike that because he couldn’t resist the sight of the wondrous revealment\nhalf offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen\nlooking and he kept on looking, looking. She would fain have cried to him\nchokingly, held out her snowy slender arms to him to come, to feel his\nlips laid on her white brow, the cry of a young girl’s love, a little\nstrangled cry, wrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages.\nAnd then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O! then the Roman\ncandle burst and it was like a sigh of O! and everyone cried O! O! in\nraptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and\nthey shed and ah! they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden,\nO so lovely, O, soft, sweet, soft!",
        "Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent. Ah! She\nglanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of\npiteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl\nHe was leaning back against the rock behind. Leopold Bloom (for it is he)\nstands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes. What a\nbrute he had been! At it again? A fair unsullied soul had called to him\nand, wretch that he was, how had he answered? An utter cad he had been!\nHe of all men! But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes,\nfor him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and\nwandered. Should a girl tell? No, a thousand times no. That was their\nsecret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to\nknow or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening\nto and fro and little bats don’t tell.",
        "Cissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to show\nwhat a great person she was: and then she cried:",
        "–Gerty! Gerty! We’re going. Come on. We can see from farther up.",
        "Gerty had an idea, one of love’s little ruses. She slipped a hand into\nher kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course\nwithout letting him and then slipped it back. Wonder if he’s too far to.\nShe rose. Was it goodbye? No. She had to go but they would meet again,\nthere, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her dream of\nyester eve. She drew herself up to her full height. Their souls met in a\nlast lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart, full of a\nstrange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face. She half\nsmiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smile that verged on\ntears, and then they parted.",
        "Slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to\nCissy, to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman. It was\ndarker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy\nseaweed. She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but\nwith care and very slowly because–because Gerty MacDowell was ...",
        "Tight boots? No. She’s lame! O!",
        "Mr Bloom watched her as she limped away. Poor girl! That’s why she’s left\non the shelf and the others did a sprint. Thought something was wrong by\nthe cut of her jib. Jilted beauty. A defect is ten times worse in a woman.\nBut makes them polite. Glad I didn’t know it when she was on show. Hot\nlittle devil all the same. I wouldn’t mind. Curiosity like a nun or a\nnegress or a girl with glasses. That squinty one is delicate. Near her\nmonthlies, I expect, makes them feel ticklish. I have such a bad headache\ntoday. Where did I put the letter? Yes, all right. All kinds of crazy\nlongings. Licking pennies. Girl in Tranquilla convent that nun told\nme liked to smell rock oil. Virgins go mad in the end I suppose.\nSister? How many women in Dublin have it today? Martha, she. Something\nin the air. That’s the moon. But then why don’t all women menstruate\nat the same time with the same moon, I mean? Depends on the time\nthey were born I suppose. Or all start scratch then get out of step.\nSometimes Molly and Milly together. Anyhow I got the best of that.\nDamned glad I didn’t do it in the bath this morning over her silly\nI will punish you letter. Made up for that tramdriver this morning.\nThat gouger M’Coy stopping me to say nothing. And his wife\nengagement in the country valise, voice like a pickaxe. Thankful for small\nmercies. Cheap too. Yours for the asking. Because they want it themselves.\nTheir natural craving. Shoals of them every evening poured out of offices.\nReserve better. Don’t want it they throw it at you. Catch em alive, O.\nPity they can’t see themselves. A dream of wellfilled hose. Where was\nthat? Ah, yes. Mutoscope pictures in Capel street: for men only. Peeping\nTom. Willy’s hat and what the girls did with it. Do they snapshot\nthose girls or is it all a fake? LINGERIE does it. Felt for the\ncurves inside her DESHABILLE. Excites them also when they’re. I’m all\nclean come and dirty me. And they like dressing one another for the\nsacrifice. Milly delighted with Molly’s new blouse. At first.\nPut them all on to take them all off. Molly. Why I bought her the violet\ngarters. Us too: the tie he wore, his lovely socks and turnedup trousers.\nHe wore a pair of gaiters the night that first we met. His lovely\nshirt was shining beneath his what? of jet. Say a woman loses a charm with\nevery pin she takes out. Pinned together. O, Mairy lost the pin of her.\nDressed up to the nines for somebody. Fashion part of their charm. Just\nchanges when you’re on the track of the secret. Except the east: Mary,\nMartha: now as then. No reasonable offer refused. She wasn’t in a hurry\neither. Always off to a fellow when they are. They never forget an\nappointment. Out on spec probably. They believe in chance because like\nthemselves. And the others inclined to give her an odd dig. Girl friends\nat school, arms round each other’s necks or with ten fingers locked,\nkissing and whispering secrets about nothing in the convent garden. Nuns\nwith whitewashed faces, cool coifs and their rosaries going up and down,\nvindictive too for what they can’t get. Barbed wire. Be sure now and write\nto me. And I’ll write to you. Now won’t you? Molly and Josie Powell. Till\nMr Right comes along, then meet once in a blue moon. TABLEAU! O, look\nwho it is for the love of God! How are you at all? What have you been\ndoing with yourself? Kiss and delighted to, kiss, to see you. Picking\nholes in each other’s appearance. You’re looking splendid. Sister souls.\nShowing their teeth at one another. How many have you left? Wouldn’t lend\neach other a pinch of salt.",
        "Ah!",
        "Devils they are when that’s coming on them. Dark devilish appearance.\nMolly often told me feel things a ton weight. Scratch the sole of\nmy foot. O that way! O, that’s exquisite! Feel it myself too. Good to rest\nonce in a way. Wonder if it’s bad to go with them then. Safe in one way.\nTurns milk, makes fiddlestrings snap. Something about withering plants I\nread in a garden. Besides they say if the flower withers she wears she’s a\nflirt. All are. Daresay she felt 1. When you feel like that you often meet\nwhat you feel. Liked me or what? Dress they look at. Always know a fellow\ncourting: collars and cuffs. Well cocks and lions do the same and stags.\nSame time might prefer a tie undone or something. Trousers? Suppose I\nwhen I was? No. Gently does it. Dislike rough and tumble. Kiss in the dark\nand never tell. Saw something in me. Wonder what. Sooner have me as I am\nthan some poet chap with bearsgrease plastery hair, lovelock over his\ndexter optic. To aid gentleman in literary. Ought to attend to my\nappearance my age. Didn’t let her see me in profile. Still, you\nnever know. Pretty girls and ugly men marrying. Beauty and the\nbeast. Besides I can’t be so if Molly. Took off her hat to show\nher hair. Wide brim. Bought to hide her face, meeting someone might\nknow her, bend down or carry a bunch of flowers to smell. Hair\nstrong in rut. Ten bob I got for Molly’s combings when we were on\nthe rocks in Holles street. Why not? Suppose he gave her money.\nWhy not? All a prejudice. She’s worth ten, fifteen, more, a pound. What? I\nthink so. All that for nothing. Bold hand: Mrs Marion. Did I forget to\nwrite address on that letter like the postcard I sent to Flynn? And the\nday I went to Drimmie’s without a necktie. Wrangle with Molly it was put\nme off. No, I remember. Richie Goulding: he’s another. Weighs on his mind.\nFunny my watch stopped at half past four. Dust. Shark liver oil they use\nto clean. Could do it myself. Save. Was that just when he, she?",
        "O, he did. Into her. She did. Done.",
        "Ah!",
        "Mr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt. O Lord, that little\nlimping devil. Begins to feel cold and clammy. Aftereffect not pleasant.\nStill you have to get rid of it someway. They don’t care. Complimented\nperhaps. Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night prayers with the\nkiddies. Well, aren’t they? See her as she is spoil all. Must have the\nstage setting, the rouge, costume, position, music. The name too. AMOURS\nof actresses. Nell Gwynn, Mrs Bracegirdle, Maud Branscombe. Curtain up.\nMoonlight silver effulgence. Maiden discovered with pensive bosom. Little\nsweetheart come and kiss me. Still, I feel. The strength it gives a man.\nThat’s the secret of it. Good job I let off there behind the wall coming\nout of Dignam’s. Cider that was. Otherwise I couldn’t have. Makes you want\nto sing after. LACAUS ESANT TARATARA. Suppose I spoke to her. What about?\nBad plan however if you don’t know how to end the conversation. Ask them a\nquestion they ask you another. Good idea if you’re stuck. Gain time. But\nthen you’re in a cart. Wonderful of course if you say: good evening, and\nyou see she’s on for it: good evening. O but the dark evening in the\nAppian way I nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was. Whew! Girl in\nMeath street that night. All the dirty things I made her say. All wrong of\ncourse. My arks she called it. It’s so hard to find one who. Aho! If you\ndon’t answer when they solicit must be horrible for them till they harden.\nAnd kissed my hand when I gave her the extra two shillings. Parrots. Press\nthe button and the bird will squeak. Wish she hadn’t called me sir. O, her\nmouth in the dark! And you a married man with a single girl! That’s what\nthey enjoy. Taking a man from another woman. Or even hear of it.\nDifferent with me. Glad to get away from other chap’s wife. Eating off his\ncold plate. Chap in the Burton today spitting back gumchewed gristle.\nFrench letter still in my pocketbook. Cause of half the trouble. But might\nhappen sometime, I don’t think. Come in, all is prepared. I dreamt. What?\nWorst is beginning. How they change the venue when it’s not what they\nlike. Ask you do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman\nwho. Or ask you what someone was going to say when he changed his\nmind and stopped. Yet if I went the whole hog, say: I want to, something\nlike that. Because I did. She too. Offend her. Then make it up. Pretend to\nwant something awfully, then cry off for her sake. Flatters them. She must\nhave been thinking of someone else all the time. What harm? Must since she\ncame to the use of reason, he, he and he. First kiss does the trick. The\npropitious moment. Something inside them goes pop. Mushy like, tell by\ntheir eye, on the sly. First thoughts are best. Remember that till their\ndying day. Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the Moorish wall\nbeside the gardens. Fifteen she told me. But her breasts were developed.\nFell asleep then. After Glencree dinner that was when we drove home.\nFeatherbed mountain. Gnashing her teeth in sleep. Lord mayor had his eye\non her too. Val Dillon. Apoplectic.",
        "There she is with them down there for the fireworks. My fireworks.\nUp like a rocket, down like a stick. And the children, twins they must be,\nwaiting for something to happen. Want to be grownups. Dressing in\nmother’s clothes. Time enough, understand all the ways of the world. And\nthe dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth. I knew she could\nwhistle. Mouth made for that. Like Molly. Why that highclass whore in\nJammet’s wore her veil only to her nose. Would you mind, please, telling\nme the right time? I’ll tell you the right time up a dark lane. Say prunes\nand prisms forty times every morning, cure for fat lips. Caressing the\nlittle boy too. Onlookers see most of the game. Of course they understand\nbirds, animals, babies. In their line.",

Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high school drawing a\npicture of Venus with all his belongings on show. Call that innocence?\nPoor idiot! His wife has her work cut out for her. Never see them sit\non a bench marked WET PAINT. Eyes all over them. Look under the bed\nfor what’s not there. Longing to get the fright of their lives.\nSharp as needles they are. When I said to Molly the man at the corner\nof Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like, twigged at\nonce he had a false arm. Had, too. Where do they get that? Typist\ngoing up Roger Greene’s stairs two at a time to show her understandings.\nHanded down from father to, mother to daughter, I mean. Bred in the\nbone.

        "And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there\nnighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat. And there\ncame against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept Dixon.\nAnd the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they\nhad had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this\nlearningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healed\nfor he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and\ndreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of\nvolatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice. And he said now that\nhe should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were\nthere. And the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither for\nhe was a man of cautels and a subtile. Also the lady was of his avis and\nrepreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had\nsaid thing that was false for his subtility. But the learningknight would\nnot hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to\nhis list and he said how it was a marvellous castle. And the traveller\nLeopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of\nlimb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery.",
        "And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of\nFinlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they\ndurst not move more for enchantment. And on this board were frightful\nswords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out\nof white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that\nthere abound marvellously. And there were vessels that are wrought by\nmagic of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath\nthat he blases in to them like to bubbles. And full fair cheer and rich\nwas on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer. And there\nwas a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay\nstrange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this\nbe possible thing without they see it natheless they are so. And these\nfishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because\nof the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress.\nAnd also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make\na compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of\ncertain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like\nto a vast mountain. And they teach the serpents there to entwine\nthemselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of\nthese serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead.",
        "And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp\nthereto the while all they that were there drank every each. And childe\nLeopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in\namity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and\nanon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his\nneighbour nist not of this wile. And he sat down in that castle with them\nfor to rest him there awhile. Thanked be Almighty God.",
        "This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at\nthe reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing for\nthere was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time hied fast.\nSir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that\nit was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he, that it be not\ncome or now. Meseems it dureth overlong. And he was ware and saw a\nfranklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than any\nof the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one\nemprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently.\nBut, said he, or it be long too she will bring forth by God His bounty and\nhave joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long. And the\nfranklin that had drunken said, Expecting each moment to be her next.\nAlso he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none\nasking nor desiring of him to drink and, Now drink, said he, fully\ndelectably, and he quaffed as far as he might to their both’s health\nfor he was a passing good man of his lustiness. And sir Leopold\nthat was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars’ hall and\nthat was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly\nhand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world\none that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in\nthe cup. Woman’s woe with wonder pondering.",
        "Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be\ndrunken an they might. There was a sort of scholars along either side the\nboard, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciable’s with\nother his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of medicine, and the franklin\nthat hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa, one Crotthers, and young\nStephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and\nCostello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of him\nerewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young Stephen, he was the most\ndrunken that demanded still of more mead) and beside the meek sir\nLeopold. But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised to\nhave come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke\nhis avow. And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship\nto sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that his languor\nbecalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted\nhim for that time in the honourablest manner. Ruth red him, love led\non with will to wander, loth to leave.",
        "For they were right witty scholars. And he heard their aresouns each gen\nother as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining that\nput such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a\nmatter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne’s house that\nnow was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her\ndeath all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case). And\nthey said farther she should live because in the beginning, they said,\nthe woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this\nimagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had\nconscience to let her die. And not few and of these was young Lynch were\nin doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other\nhowbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges\ndid provide no remedy. A redress God grant. This was scant said but all\ncried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother, the wife should live\nand the babe to die. In colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what\nwith argument and what for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was\nprompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might\nnot lack. Then young Madden showed all the whole affair and said how that\nshe was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and\nbedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint Ultan of Arbraccan her\ngoodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous\ngrieved. To whom young Stephen had these words following: Murmur, sirs,\nis eke oft among lay folk. Both babe and parent now glorify their Maker,\nthe one in limbo gloom, the other in purgefire. But, gramercy, what of\nthose Godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise, which is the sin\nagainst the Holy Ghost, Very God, Lord and Giver of Life? For, sirs, he\nsaid, our lust is brief. We are means to those small creatures within us\nand nature has other ends than we. Then said Dixon junior to Punch\nCostello wist he what ends. But he had overmuch drunken and the best word\nhe could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she\nwere or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of\nhis spleen of lustihead. Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young\nMalachi’s praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he\ncometh by his horn, the other all this while, pricked forward with their\njibes wherewith they did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint\nFoutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay\nin man to do. Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen\nand sir Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange\nhumour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that\nbare whoso she might be or wheresoever. Then spake young Stephen orgulous\nof mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons,\nof Lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of\nbrightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius\nsaith, by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or\nan she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with, EFFECTU SECUTO,\nor peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and\nMoses Maimonides. He said also how at the end of the second month a human\nsoul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for\nGod’s greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to\nbear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the\nfisherman’s seal, even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church\nfor all ages founded. All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would\nhe in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life. A\nwariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw,\nhe said dissembling, as his wont was, that as it was informed him, who\nhad ever loved the art of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also\nwith his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that\nmother Church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such\nsort deliverly he scaped their questions. That is truth, pardy, said\nDixon, and, or I err, a pregnant word. Which hearing young Stephen was a\nmarvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor\nlendeth to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and\nthat he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons.",
        "But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had\npity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and\nas he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only\nmanchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art\ncould save so dark is destiny. And she was wondrous stricken of heart for\nthat evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb’s\nwool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and lie\nakeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now Sir\nLeopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his\nfriend’s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and\nas sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for all\naccounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure for\nyoung Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and\nmurdered his goods with whores.",
        "About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty so\nas there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their\napproach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for the\nintentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the vicar\nof Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray. Now drink we, quod he,\nof this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my\nbody but my soul’s bodiment. Leave ye fraction of bread to them that live\nby bread alone.

And he showed them\nglistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two\npound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song which he writ.\nThey all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as\nwas herebefore. His words were then these as followeth: Know all men, he\nsaid, time’s ruins build eternity’s mansions. What means this? Desire’s\nwind blasts the thorntree but after it becomes from a bramblebush to be a\nrose upon the rood of time. Mark me now.

        "To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in\nEccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he\nhad not cided to take friar’s vows and he answered him obedience in the\nwomb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days. Master\nLenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds\nand how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue of\na confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all\nintershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership. But he\nsaid very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the\neternal son and ever virgin. Thereat mirth grew in them the more and they\nrehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and\ndeflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island, she to\nbe in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain, with\nburning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and\nthe anthem UT NOVETUR SEXUS OMNIS CORPORIS MYSTERIUM till she was there\nunmaided. He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those\ndelicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is\nin their MAID’S TRAGEDY that was writ for a like twining of lovers: TO\nBED, TO BED was the burden of it to be played with accompanable concent\nupon the virginals. An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most mollificative\nsuadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous flambeaus of the\nparanymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium of connubial\ncommunion. Well met they were, said Master Dixon, joyed, but, harkee,\nyoung sir, better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher for, by my troth,\nof such a mingling much might come. Young Stephen said indeed to his best\nremembrance they had but the one doxy between them and she of the stews\nto make shift with in delights amorous for life ran very high in those\ndays and the custom of the country approved with it. Greater love than\nthis, he said, no man hath that a man lay down his wife for his friend.\nGo thou and do likewise. Thus, or words to that effect, saith\nZarathustra, sometime regius professor of French letters to the\nuniversity of Oxtail nor breathed there ever that man to whom mankind was\nmore beholden. Bring a stranger within thy tower it will go hard but thou\nwilt have the secondbest bed. ORATE, FRATRES, PRO MEMETIPSO. And all the\npeople shall say, Amen. Remember, Erin, thy generations and thy days of\nold, how thou settedst little by me and by my word and broughtedst in a\nstranger to my gates to commit fornication in my sight and to wax fat and\nkick like Jeshurum. Therefore hast thou sinned against my light and hast\nmade me, thy lord, to be the slave of servants. Return, return, Clan\nMilly: forget me not, O Milesian. Why hast thou done this abomination\nbefore me that thou didst spurn me for a merchant of jalaps and didst\ndeny me to the Roman and to the Indian of dark speech with whom thy\ndaughters did lie luxuriously? Look forth now, my people, upon the land\nof behest, even from Horeb and from Nebo and from Pisgah and from the\nHorns of Hatten unto a land flowing with milk and money. But thou hast\nsuckled me with a bitter milk: my moon and my sun thou hast quenched for\never. And thou hast left me alone for ever in the dark ways of my\nbitterness: and with a kiss of ashes hast thou kissed my mouth.

        "A black crack of noise in the street here, alack, bawled back. Loud on\nleft Thor thundered: in anger awful the hammerhurler. Came now the storm\nthat hist his heart. And Master Lynch bade him have a care to flout and\nwitwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry. And\nhe that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all\nmark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift\nwas now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the\ncage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm. Then did some\nmock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard again to his yale which\nMaster Lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a\nblow on any the least colour.

        "But was young Boasthard’s fear vanquished by Calmer’s words? No, for he\nhad in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be\ndone away. And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the\nother? He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either. But\ncould he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the\nbottle Holiness that then he lived withal? Indeed no for Grace was not\nthere to find that bottle. Heard he then in that clap the voice of the\ngod Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon? Heard? Why,\nhe could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube Understanding\n(which he had not done). For through that tube he saw that he was in the\nland of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like\nthe rest too a passing show. And would he not accept to die like the rest\nand pass away? By no means would he though he must nor would he make more\nshows according as men do with wives which Phenomenon has commanded them\nto do by the book Law.

Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and\nafter hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a\nfifty mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won’t sprout, fields\nathirst, very sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too.\nHard to breathe and all the young quicks clean consumed without sprinkle\nthis long while back as no man remembered to be without. The rosy buds\nall gone brown and spread out blobs and on the hills nought but dry flag\nand faggots that would catch at first fire. All the world saying, for\naught they knew, the big wind of last February a year that did havoc the\nland so pitifully a small thing beside this barrenness. But by and by, as\nsaid, this evening after sundown, the wind sitting in the west, biggish\nswollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and the weatherwise\nporing up at them and some sheet lightnings at first and after, past ten\nof the clock, one great stroke with a long thunder and in a brace of\nshakes all scamper pellmell within door for the smoking shower, the men\nmaking shelter for their straws with a clout or kerchief, womenfolk\nskipping off with kirtles catched up soon as the pour came. In Ely place,\nBaggot street, Duke’s lawn, thence through Merrion green up to Holles\nstreet a swash of water flowing that was before bonedry and not one chair\nor coach or fiacre seen about but no more crack after that first.

The other, Costello that is, hearing this talk asked was it poetry\nor a tale. Faith, no, he says, Frank (that was his name), ’tis all about\nKerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague. But they can go\nhang, says he with a wink, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it.\nThere’s as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly\nhe offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed\nwishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief\ndesign of his embassy as he was sharpset. MORT AUX VACHES, says Frank\nthen in the French language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper\nthat has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman\ntoo. From a child this Frank had been a donought that his father, a\nheadborough, who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and\nthe use of the globes, matriculated at the university to study the\nmechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was\nmore familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his\nvolumes. One time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher,\nthen nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then he\nwas for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk,\nkidnapping a squire’s heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids’ linen\nor choking chicken behind a hedge. He had been off as many times as a cat\nhas lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father\nthe headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him. What,\nsays Mr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to know the drift\nof it, will they slaughter all? I protest I saw them but this day morning\ngoing to the Liverpool boats, says he. I can scarce believe ’tis so bad,\nsays he. And he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers,\ngreasy hoggets and wether wool, having been some years before actuary for\nMr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock\nand meadow auctions hard by Mr Gavin Low’s yard in Prussia street. I\nquestion with you there, says he. More like ’tis the hoose or the timber\ntongue. Mr Stephen, a little moved but very handsomely told him no such\nmatter and that he had dispatches from the emperor’s chief tailtickler\nthanking him for the hospitality, that was sending over Doctor\nRinderpest, the bestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two\nof physic to take the bull by the horns. Come, come, says Mr Vincent,\nplain dealing. He’ll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles\nwith a bull that’s Irish, says he. Irish by name and irish by nature,\nsays Mr Stephen, and he sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an\nEnglish chinashop. I conceive you, says Mr Dixon. It is that same bull\nthat was sent to our island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder\nof them all, with an emerald ring in his nose. True for you, says Mr\nVincent cross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a\nplumper and a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock. He had\nhorns galore, a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out\nof his nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and\nrollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains.\nWhat for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas\nthat was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who\nwere no better off than himself. So be off now, says he, and do all my\ncousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer’s blessing, and\nwith that he slapped his posteriors very soundly. But the slap and the\nblessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he taught him\na trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to\nthis day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in\nhis ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long\nholy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four\nfields of all Ireland. Another then put in his word: And they dressed\nhim, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and\nruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over\nwith spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road\nwith a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he\ncould doss and dung to his heart’s content. By this time the father of\nthe faithful (for so they called him) was grown so heavy that he could\nscarce walk to pasture. To remedy which our cozening dames and damsels\nbrought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was\nfull he would rear up on his hind uarters to show their ladyships a\nmystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls’ language and they all\nafter him. Ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he would suffer\nnought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself (for that was\nthe only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in\nthe middle of the island with a printed notice, saying: By the Lord\nHarry, Green is the grass that grows on the ground. And, says Mr Dixon,\nif ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of\nConnemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful\nof mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he’d run amok over half the\ncountryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by\nlord Harry’s orders. There was bad blood between them at first, says Mr\nVincent, and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in\nthe world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and\nI’ll meddle in his matters, says he. I’ll make that animal smell hell,\nsays he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me. But one\nevening, says Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt\nto go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself\nbut the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with\npitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and\non picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found\nsure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion\nbull of the Romans, BOS BOVUM, which is good bog Latin for boss of the\nshow. After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his head into a\ncow’s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it\nout again told them all his new name. Then, with the water running off\nhim, he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his\ngrandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls’ language to study but he\ncould never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he\ncopied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he\nfilled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy, the\nside of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat. In\nshort, he and the bull of Ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse\nand a shirt. They were, says Mr Stephen, and the end was that the men of\nthe island seeing no help was toward, as the ungrate women were all of\none mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and their bundles of\nchattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the yards, sprang\ntheir luff, heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind, put her head\nbetween wind and water, weighed anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly\nRoger, gave three times three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their\nbumboat and put to sea to recover the main of America. Which was the\noccasion, says Mr Vincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that\nrollicking chanty:",

        "Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway\nas the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend\nwhom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon,\nwho had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a\ncornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars. Mr Mulligan was civil\nenough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a\nproject of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched\non. Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards\nwhich he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell’s bearing a legend\nprinted in fair italics: MR MALACHI MULLIGAN. FERTILISER AND INCUBATOR.\nLAMBAY ISLAND. His project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw\nfrom the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir\nFopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself\nto the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed. Well,\nlet us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon. I make no doubt it\nsmacks of wenching. Come, be seated, both. ’Tis as cheap sitting as\nstanding. Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon\nhis design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a\nconsideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the\nprohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal\nvexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the\nprohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities\nacquired. It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch\ndefrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable\nfemales with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide their\nflambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly\nbloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might\nmultiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of\ntheir sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he\nassured them, made his heart weep. To curb this inconvenient (which he\nconcluded due to a suppression of latent heat), having advised with\ncertain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter, he had\nresolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island\nfrom its holder, lord Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much\nin favour with our ascendancy party. He proposed to set up there a\nnational fertilising farm to be named OMPHALOS with an obelisk hewn and\nerected after the fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman\nservices for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever\nwho should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the\nfunctions of her natural. Money was no object, he said, nor would he take\na penny for his pains. The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent\nlady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm\npersuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man. For his\nnutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of\nsavoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these latter\nprolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both broiled\nand stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies.\nAfter this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration Mr\nMulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had\nshielded it. They both, it seems, had been overtaken by the rain and for\nall their mending their pace had taken water, as might be observed by Mr\nMulligan’s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald.\nHis project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and\nwon hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of Mary’s excepted to it,\nasking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to\nNewcastle. Mr Mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt\nquotation from the classics which, as it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to\nhim a sound and tasteful support of his contention: TALIS AC TANTA\nDEPRAVATIO HUJUS SECULI, O QUIRITES, UT MATRESFAMILIARUM NOSTRAE LASCIVAS\nCUJUSLIBET SEMIVIRI LIBICI TITILLATIONES TESTIBUS PONDEROSIS ATQUE\nEXCELSIS ERECTIONIBUS CENTURIONUM ROMANORUM MAGNOPERE ANTEPONUNT, while\nfor those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal\nkingdom more suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest\nglade, the farmyard drake and duck.",
