        "The Quarrel",
        "“Say, Yan, I saw a Blood-Robin this morning.”",
        "“That’s a new one,” said Yan, in a tone of doubt.",
        "“Well, it’s the purtiest bird in the country.”",
        "“What? A Humming-bird?”",
        "“Na-aw-w-w. They ain’t purty, only small.”",
        "“Well, that shows what you know,” retorted Yan, “’for these exquisite\nwinged gems are at once the most diminutive and brilliantly coloured\nof the whole feathered race.’” This phrase Yan had read some where and\nhis overapt memory had seized on it.",
        "“Pshaw!” said Sam. “Sounds like a book, but I’ll bet I seen hundreds\nof Hummin’-birds round the Trumpet-vine and Bee-balm in the garden,\nan’ they weren’t a millionth part as purty as this. Why, it’s just as\nred as blood, shines like fire and has black wings. The old Witch says\nthe Indians call it a War-bird ’cause when it flew along the trail\nthere was sure going to be war, which is like enough, fur they wuz at\nit all the hull time.”",
        "“Oh, I know,” said Yan. “A Scarlet Tanager. Where did you see it?”",
        "“Why, it came from the trees, then alighted on the highest pole of the\nteepee.”",
        "“Hope there isn’t going to be any war there, Sam. I wish I had one to\nstuff.”",
        "“Tried to get him for you, sonny, spite of the Rules. Could ’a’ done\nit, too, with a gun. Had a shy at him with an arrow an’ I hain’t been\nbird or arrow since. ’Twas my best arrow, too–old Sure-Death.”",
        "“Will ye give me the arrow if I kin find it?” said Guy.",
        "“Now you bet I won’t. What good’d that be to me?”",
        "“Will you give me your chewin’ gum?”",
        "“No.”",
        "“Will you lend it to me?”",
        "“Yep.”",
        "“Well, there’s your old arrow,” said Guy, pulling it from between the\nlogs where it had fallen. “I seen it go there an’ reckoned I’d lay low\nan’ watch the progress of events, as Yan says,” and Guy whinnied.",
        "Early in the morning the Indians in war-paint went off on a prowl.\nThey carried their bows and arrows, of course, and were fully alert,\nstudying the trail at intervals and listening for “signs of the\nenemy.”",
        "Their moccasined feet gave forth no sound, and their keen eyes took in\nevery leaf that stirred as their sinewy forms glided among the huge\ntrunks of the primeval vegetation–at least, Yan’s note-book said they\ndid. They certainly went with very little noise, but they disturbed a\nsmall Hawk that flew from a Balsam-fir–a “Fire tree” they now called\nit, since they had discovered the wonderful properties of the wood.",
        "Three arrows were shot after it and no harm done. Yan then looked into\nthe tree and exclaimed:",
        "“A nest.”",
        "“Looks to me like a fuzz-ball,” said Guy.",
        "“Guess not,” replied Yan. “Didn’t we scare the Hawk off?”",
        "He was a good climber, quite the best of the three, and dropping his\nhead-dress, coat, leggings and weapon, she shinned up the Balsam\ntrunk, utterly regardless of the gum which hung in crystalline drops\nor easily burst bark-bladders on every part.",
        "He was no sooner out of sight in the lower branches than Satan entered\ninto Guy’s small heart and prompted him thus:",
        "“Le’s play a joke on him an’ clear out.”",
        "Sam’s sense of humour beguiled him. They stuffed Yan’s coat and\npants with leaves and rubbish, put them properly together with the\nhead-dress, then stuck one of his own arrows through the breast of the\ncoat into the ground and ran away.",
        "Meanwhile Yan reached the top of the tree and found that the nest was\nonly one of the fuzz-balls so common on Fir trees. He called out to\nhis comrades but got no reply, so came down. At first the ridiculous\ndummy seemed funny, then he found that his coat had been injured and\nthe arrow broken. He called for his companions, but got no answer;\nagain and again, without reply. He went to where they all had intended\ngoing, but if they were there they hid from him, and feeling himself\nscurvily deserted he went back to camp in no very pleasant humour.\nThey were not there. He sat by the fire awhile, then, yielding to his\nhabit of industry, he took off his coat and began to work at the dam.",
        "He became engrossed in his work and did not notice the return of the\nrunaways till he heard a voice saying “What’s this?”",
        "On turning he saw Sam poring over his private note-book and then\nbeginning to read aloud:",
        "  “Kingbird, fearless crested Kingbird\n  Thou art––”",
        "But Yan snatched it out of his hands.",
        "“I’ll bet the rest was something about ’Singbird,’” said Sam.",
        "Yan’s face was burning with shame and anger. He had a poetic streak,\nand was morbidly sensitive about any one seeing its product. The\nKingbird episode of their long evening walk was but one of many\nsimilar. He had learned to delight in these daring attacks of the\nintrepid little bird on the Hawks and Crows, and so magnified them\ninto high heroics until he must try to record them in rhyme. It was\nvery serious to him, and to have his sentiments afford sport to\nthe others was more than he could bear. Of course Guy came out and\ngrinned, taking his cue from Sam. Then he remarked in colourless\ntones, as though announcing an item of general news, “They say there\nwas a fearless-crested Injun shot in the woods to-day.”",
        "The morning’s desertion left Yan in no mood for chaffing. He rightly\nattributed the discourtesy to Guy. Turning savagely toward him he\nsaid, meaningly:",
        "“Now, no more of your sass, you dirty little sneak.”",
        "“I ain’t talkin’ to you,” Guy snickered, and followed Sam into the\nteepee. There were low voices within for a time. Yan went over toward\nthe dam and began to plug mud into some possible holes. Presently\nthere was more snickering in the teepee, then Guy came out alone,\nstruck a theatrical attitude and began to recite to a tree above Yan’s\nhead:",
        "    “Kingbird, fearless crested Kingbird,\n    Thou art but a blooming sing bird–”",
        "But the mud was very handy and Yan hurled a mass that spattered Guy\nthoroughly and sent him giggling into the teepee.",
        "“Them’s the bow-kays,” Sam was heard to say. “Go out an’ git some\nmore; dead sure you deserve ’em. Let me know when the calls for\n’author’ begin?” Then there was more giggling. Yan was fast losing all\ncontrol of himself. He seized a big stick and strode into the teepee,\nbut Sam lifted the cover of the far side and slipped out. Guy tried to\ndo the same, but Yan caught him.",
        "“Here, I ain’t doin’ nothin’.”",
        "The answer was a sounding whack which made him wriggle.",
        "“You let me alone, you big coward. I ain’t doin’ nothin’ to you. You\nbetter let me alone. Sam! S-A-M! S-A-A-A-M!!!” as the stick came down\nagain and again.",
        "“Don’t bother me,” shouted Sam outside. “I’m writin’ poethry–terrible\npartic’lar job, poethry. He only means it in kindness, anyhow.”",
        "Guy was screaming now and weeping copiously.",
        "“You’ll get some more if you give me any more of your lip,” said Yan,\nand stepped out to meet Sam with the note-book again, apparently\nscribbling away. As soon as he saw Yan he stood up, cleared his throat\nand began:",
        "    “Kingbird, fearless crested–”",
        "But he did not finish it. Yan struck him a savage blow on the mouth.\nSam sprang back a few steps. Yan seized a large stone.",
        "“Don’t you throw that at me,” said Sam seriously. Yan sent it with his\ndeadliest force and aim. Sam dodged it and then in self-defense ran at\nYan and they grappled and fought, while Guy, eager for revenge, rushed\nto help Sam, and got in a few trifling blows.",
        "Sam was heavier and stronger than Yan, but Yan had gained wonderfully\nsince coming to Sanger. He was thin, but wiry, and at school he had\nlearned the familiar hip-throw that is as old as Cain and Abel. It was\nall he did know of wrestling, but now it stood him in good stead. He\nwas strong with rage, too–and almost as soon as they grappled he\nfound his chance. Sam’s heels flew up and he went sprawling in the\ndust. One straight blow on the nose sent Guy off howling, and seeing\nSam once more on his feet, Yan rushed at him again like a wild beast.\nA moment later the big boy went tumbling over the bank into the pond.",
        "“_You see if I don’t get you sent about your business from\nhere,” spluttered Sam, now thoroughly angry. “I’ll tell Da you hender\nthe wurruk.” His eyes were full of water and Guy’s were full of stars\nand of tears. Neither saw the fourth party near; but Yan did. There,\nnot twenty yards away, stood William Raften, spectator of the whole\naffair–an expression not of anger but of infinite sorrow and\ndisappointment on his face–not because they had quarrelled–no–he\nknew boy nature well enough not to give that a thought–but that\nhis son, older and stronger than the other and backed by\nanother boy, should be licked in fair fight by a thin, half-invalid.",
        "It was as bitter a pill as he had ever had to swallow. He turned in\nsilence and disappeared, and never afterward alluded to the matter.",
        "[Illustration: “There stood Raften, spectator of the whole affair.\"]",
