        "The easiest thing in the world is to write a song; the most\ndifficult, to write a song that will be popular.  I do not mean a\n“popular” song, but a song everybody will whistle–for few songs\nwritten for the populace really become songs of the people.  The\ndifference between poverty and opulence in the business of\nsong-writing is–whistling.",
        "What is the difference, then, between the man who can “write songs\"\nand the one who can write songs everybody will whistle?  Wherein\nlies the magic?  Here is the difference, unexplained it is true,\nbut at least clearly stated:",
        "There are hundreds of men and women all over the land who can rhyme\nwith facility.  Anyone of them can take almost any idea you suggest\noff hand, and on the instant sing you a song that plays up that\nidea.  These persons are the modern incarnations of the old time\nminstrels who wandered over the land and sang extemporaneous ditties\nin praise of their host for their dinners.  But, remarkable as the\ngift is, many of these modern minstrels cannot for the life of\nthem put into their songs that something which makes their hearers\nwhistle it long after they leave.  The whistle maker is the one\nwho can rhyme with perhaps no more ease than these others, but\ninto his song he is able to instil the magic–sometimes.",
        "But what is this magic that makes of song-writing a mystery that\neven the genius cannot unerringly solve each time he tries?  Not\nfor one moment would I have you believe that I can solve the mystery\nfor you.  If I could, I should not be writing this chapter–I\nshould be writing a song that could not fail of the greatest sale\nin history.  Still, with the kind assistance of the gentlemen in\nthe profession–as the prestidigitator used to say in the old town\nhall when he began his entertainment–I may be able to lift the\nouter veils of the unknown, and you may be able I to face the\nproblem with clearer-seeing eyes.",
        "I called for help first from Irving Berlin, without doubt the most\nsuccessful popular song writer this country has ever known; then\nthe assistance of phenomenally successful writers of such diverse\ngenius as Charles K. Harris, L. Wolfe Gilbert, Ballard MacDonald,\nJoe McCarthy, Stanley Murphy, and Anatol Friedland, was asked and\nfreely given.  It is from their observations, as well as from my\nown, that the following elements of the art of whistle-making have\nbeen gathered.",
        "Although we are interested only in the lyrics of the popular song,\nwe must first consider the music, for the lyric writer is very\noften required to write words to music that has already been\nwritten.  Therefore he must know the musical elements of his\nproblem.",
        "Think of any popular song-hit, and while you are recollecting just\n“how it goes,” stand back from yourself  and watch your mental\nprocesses.  The words of the title first pop into your mind, do\nthey not?  Then do not you find yourself whistling that part of\nthe music fitted to those words?  Conversely, if the music comes\ninto your mind first, the words seem to sing themselves.  Now see\nif the bars of music you remember and whistle first are not the\nnotes fitted to the title.",
        "If these observations are correct, we have not only proof of the\ninseparable quality of the words and the music of a popular song,\nbut also evidence to which you can personally testify regarding\nthe foundations of lyric-writing.",
        "But first let us hear what Berlin has to say about the inseparable\nquality of words and music:  “The song writer who writes both words\nand music, has the advantage over the lyric writer who must fit\nhis words to somebody else’s music and the composer who must make\nhis music fit someone else’s words.  Latitude–the mother of\nnovelty–is denied them, and in consequence both lyrics and melody\nsuffer.  Since I write both words and music, I can compose them\ntogether and make them fit.  I sacrifice one for the other.  If I\nhave a melody I want to use, I plug away at the lyrics until I\nmake them fit the best parts of my music, and vice versa.  “For\ninstance:  ’In My Harem’ first came to me from the humorous possibility\nthat the Greeks, who at that time were fighting with the Turks,\nmight be the cause of a lot of harems running loose in Turkey.  I\ntried to fit that phrase to a melody, but I couldn’t.  At last I\ngot a melody; something that sounded catchy; a simple ’dum-te-de-dum.’\nI had it,",
        "                      In my harem,\n                      In my harem.",
        "“With ’Ragtime Violin’ I had the phrase and no music.  I got a few\nbars to fit, then the melody made a six-syllable and then a\nfive-syllable passage necessary.  I had it:",
        "                 Fiddle up!  Fiddle up!\n                     On your violin.",
        "“The lyric of a song must sing the music and the music sing the\nwords.”",
        "Charles K. Harris, who wrote the great popular success, “After the\nBall,” so far back in the early days of the popular song that some\nconsider this song the foundation of the present business, has\nfollowed it up with innumerable successes.  Mr. Harris has this\nto, say on the same point:",
        "“I believe it is impossible to collaborate with anyone in writing\na popular song.  I don’t believe one man can write the words and\nanother the music.  A man can’t put his heart in another’s lyrics\nor music.  To set a musical note for each word of a song is not\nall–the note must fit the word.”  But, while Mr. Harris’s words\nshould be considered as the expression of an authority, there is\nalso considerable evidence that points the other way.  Just to\nmention a few of the many partnerships which have resulted in\nnumerous successes, there are Williams and Van Alstyne, who followed\n“Under the Shade of the Old Apple Tree” with a series of hits;\nBallard MacDonald and Harry Carroll, who made “On the Trail of the\nLonesome Pine” merely the first of a remarkably successful\nbrotherhood; Harry Von Tilzer with his ever varying collaborators,\nand L. Wolfe Gilbert, who wrote “Robert E. Lee,” “Hitchy Koo,\"\nand other hits, with Louis Muir, and then collaborated with Anatol\nFriedland and others in producing still other successes.  These\nfew examples out of many which might be quoted, show that two\npersons can collaborate in writing song-hits, but, in the main,\nas Mr. Berlin and Mr. Harris say, there are decided advantages\nwhen words and music can be done together by one writer.",
        "What is absolutely essential to the writing of songs which will\nmake the nation whistle, may be stated in this principle:",
        "The words and music of a song must fit each other so perfectly\nthat the thought of one is inseparable from the other.",
        "And now before we turn to the essential elements of the words, to\nwhich I shall devote the next chapter, permit me to name a few of\nthe elements of popular music that may be helpful to many modern\nminstrels to know.  In fact, these are all the suggestions on the\nwriting of popular music that I have been able to glean from many\nyears of curious inquiry.  I believe they represent practically,\nif not quite, all the hints that can be given on this subject. [1]",
        "[1] Because of the obvious impossibility of adequately discussing\nsyncopation and kindred purely technical elements, ragtime has not\nbeen particularly pointed out.  The elements here given are those\nthat apply to ragtime as well as to nearly every other sort of\npopular song.",
        "The popular song is introduced to the public by vaudeville performers,\ncabaret singers, and demonstrators, whose voices have not a wide\nrange.  Even some of the most successful vaudeville stars have not\nextraordinary voices.  Usually the vaudeville performer cannot\ncompass a range of much more than an octave.  The cabaret singer\nwho has command of more than seven notes is rare, and the demonstrator\nin the department store and the five-and ten-cent store usually\nhas a voice little better than the person who purchases.  Therefore\nthe composer of a song is restricted to the range of one octave.\nSometimes, it is true, a song is written in “one-one,” or even\n“one-two” (one or two notes more than an octave), but even such\n“rangey” songs make use of these notes only in the verses and\nconfine the chorus to a single octave.  But in the end, the necessity\nfor the composer’s writing his song within one octave to make an\neffective offering for his introducing singers, works out to his\nadvantage.  The average voice of an octave range is that possessed\nby those who buy popular songs to sing at home.",
        "Now here is a helpful hint and another bit of evidence from the\nmusic angle, to emphasize the necessity for the perfect fitting\nof words and music.  Let me state it as Berlin did, in an article\nwritten for the Green Book Magazine:",
        "“Melodies should go up on open vowels in the lyrics–A, I or O. E\nis half open and U is closed.  Going up on a closed vowel makes\nenunciation difficult.”",
        "Experience is the only thing warranted to convince beyond doubt,\nso test this rule on your own piano.  Then take down the most\npopular songs you have in your collection and measure them by it.",
        "As we shall see later, another definition of the popular song-hit\nmight be, “A song with a punch in the lyrics and a punch in the\nmusic.”  Berlin expressed the application to the problem of melody\nby the following:",
        "“In the ’International Rag,’ for example, I got my punch by means\nof my melody.  I used the triplet, the freak, from out of my bag\nof tricks:",
        "                   Raggedy melody,\n                   Full of originality.",
        "Anatol Friedland, who composed the music of “My Persian Rose,” and\nL. Wolfe Gilbert’s “My Little Dream Girl,” in discussing this\nquestion, said:",
        "“Ten notes may be the secret of a popular song success.  If I can\nmake my listeners remember ten notes of a song that’s all I ask.\nWhenever they hear these ten notes played they’ll say, ’That’s. . .,’\nand straightway they’ll begin to whistle it.  This is the\nmusic punch, and it depends on merit alone.  Now here’s one angle\nof the musical punch trick:",
        "“To make a punch more punchy still, we repeat it at least once,\nand sometimes oftener, in a song.  You may start your chorus with\nit, repeat it in the middle, or repeat it at the end.  Rarely is\nit repeated in the verse.  High-brow composers call it the theme.\nFor the popular song composer, it’s the punch.  Clever repetition\nthat makes the strain return with delightful satisfaction, is one\nof the tricks of the trade–as well as of the art of popular music.”",
        "If what Friedland says is so, and you may turn to your well-thumbed\npile of music for confirmation, the theme or the punch of popular\nmusic may prove the entire song.  I mean, that in its final sales\nanalysis, the magic bars are what count.  To carry this logical\nexamination still further, it is possible for a popular song to\nbe little more than theme.  As a musical theme is the underlying\nmelody out of which the variations are formed, it is possible to\nrepeat the theme so often that the entire song is little more than\nclever repetitions.",
        "One of the most common methods is to underlay a melody with what\nE. M. Wickes, [1] one of the keenest popular song critics of today,\ncalls the “internal vamp.”  This is the keeping of a melody so\nclosely within its possible octave that the variations play around\na very few notes.  Try on your piano this combination–D, E flat,\nand E natural, or F natural, with varying tempos, and you will\nrecognize many beginnings of different famous songs they represent.\nEither the verse of these songs starts off with this combination,\nor the chorus takes these notes for its beginning.  “Sweet Adeline\"\nand “On the Banks of the Wabash” are but two of the many famous\nsongs built on this foundation.  Of course, there are other\ncombinations.  These few combinations taken together might be\nconsidered as the popular idea of “easy music.”",
        "[1] Mr. Wickes has been contributing to The Writer’s Monthly a\nseries of valuable papers under the general caption, “Helps for\nSong Writers.”",
        "And now it is through the consideration of the importance of the\nvariations of the theme that we may come to an understanding of\nwhat, for the want of a better phrase, I shall call unexpected\npunches.",
        "The impossibility of adequately pointing out by words the specific\nexamples of what I mean in certain songs makes it necessary for\nme to direct you back to your own piano.  Run over a group of your\nfavorites and see how many musical punches you can find that are\nnot due directly to the theme.  Pick out the catchy variations in\na dozen songs–you may chance on one or two where the biggest punch\nis not in the theme.  Of course you may trace it all back to the\ntheme, but nevertheless it still stands out a distinct punch in\nthe variation.  If you can add this punch to your theme-punch,\nyour song success is assured.",
        "When Sol P. Levy, the composer of “Memories,” the “Dolly Dip\nDances,” and a score of better-class melodies, shared my office,\none of our sources of amusement was seeking the original themes\nfrom which the popular songs were made.  As Mr. Levy was arranging\nsongs for nearly all the big publishers, we had plenty of material\nwith which to play our favorite indoor sport.  It was a rare song,\nindeed, whose musical parent we could not ferret out.  Nearly all\nthe successful popular songs frankly owned themes that were favorites\nof other days–some were favorites long “before the war.”",
        "Berlin’s use of “Way down upon the Swanee River\"–\"played in\nragtime\"–for a musical punch in “Alexander’s Ragtime Band,” was\nnot the first free use of a theme of an old favorite for a punch,\nbut it was one of the first honestly frank uses.  The way he took\nMendelssohn’s “Spring Song” and worked it into as daring a “rag\"\nas he could achieve, is perhaps the most delightfully impudent,\n“here-see-what-I-can-do,” spontaneously and honestly successful\n“lift” ever perpetrated.  Berlin has “ragged” some of the most\nperfect themes of grand opera with wonderful success, but not\nalways so openly.  And other composers have done the same thing.",
        "The usual method is to take some theme that is filled with memories\nand make it over into a theme that is just enough like the familiar\ntheme to be haunting.  This is the one secret or trick of the\npopular song trade that has been productive of more money than\nperhaps any other.",
        "This lifting of themes is not plagiarism in the strict sense in\nwhich a solemn court of art-independence would judge it.  Of course\nit is well within that federal law which makes the copyrightable\npart of any piece of music as wide open as a barn door, for you\nknow you can with “legal honesty” steal the heart of any song, if\nyou are “clever” enough, and want it.  The average popular song\nwriter who makes free use of another composer’s melody, doubtless\nwould defend his act with the argument that he is not writing\n“serious music,” only melodies for the passing hour and therefore\nthat he ought to be permitted the artistic license of weaving into\nhis songs themes that are a part of the melodic life of the day.\n[1] But, although some song writers contend for the right of free\nuse, they are usually the first to cry “stop thief” when another\ncomposer does the same thing to them.  However, dismissing the\nethics of this matter, right here there lies a warning, not of art\nor of law, but for your own success.",
        "[1] An interesting article discussing the harm such tactics have\ndone the popular song business is to be found over the signature\nof Will Rossiter in the New York Star for March 1, 1913.",
        "Never lift a theme of another popular song.  Never use a lifted\ntheme of any song–unless you can improve on it.  And even then\nnever try to hide a theme in your melody as your own–follow Mr.\nBerlin’s method, if you can, and weave it frankly into your music.",
        "Now, to sum up all that has been said on the music of the popular\nsong:  While it is an advantage for one man to write both the words\nand music of a song, it is not absolutely essential; what is\nessential is that the words and music fit each other so perfectly\nthat the thought of one is inseparable from the other.  One octave\nis the range in which popular music should be written.  Melodies\nshould go up on open vowels in the lyrics.  A “punch” should be\nput in the music wherever possible.  Punch is sometimes secured\nby the trick of repetition in the chorus, as well as at the beginning\nand end.  The theme may be and usually is the punch, but in the\nvariations there may be punches not suggested by the theme.  Themes,\nsemi-classical, or even operatic, or punches of old favorites may\nbe used–but not those of other popular songs–and then it is best\nto use them frankly.",
        "To state all this in one concise sentence permit me to hazard the\nfollowing:",
        "The music-magic of the popular song lies in a catchy theme stated\nat, or close to, the very beginning, led into clever variations\nthat round back at least once and maybe twice into the original\ntheme, and finishing with the theme–which was a punch of intrinsic\nmerit, made stronger by a repetition that makes it positively\nhaunting.",
