        "  Geographical sketch of California\n  Its political and social institutions\n  Colorado River\n  Valley and river of San Joaquin\n  Former government\n  Presidios\n  Missions\n  Ports and commerce.",
        "For the general information of the reader, it will be proper to give a\nbrief geographical sketch of California, and some account of its\npolitical and social institutions, as they have heretofore existed.",
        "The district of country known geographically as Upper California is\nbounded on the north by Oregon, the forty-second degree of north\nlatitude being the boundary line between the two territories; on the\neast by the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra de los Mimbres, a\ncontinuation of the same range; on the south by Sonora and Old or Lower\nCalifornia, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean. Its extent from north\nto south is about 700 miles, and from east to west from 600 to 800\nmiles, with an area of about 400,000 square miles. A small portion only\nof this extensive territory is fertile or inhabitable by civilized man,\nand this portion consists chiefly in the strip of country along the\nPacific Ocean, about 700 miles in length, and from 100 to 150 in\nbreadth, bounded on the east by the Sierra Nevada, and on the west by\nthe Pacific. In speaking of Upper California this strip of country is\nwhat is generally referred to.",
        "The largest river of Upper California is the Colorado or Red, which has\na course of about 1000 miles, and empties into the Gulf of California\nin latitude about 32 degrees north. But little is known of the region\nthrough which this stream flows. The report of trappers, however, is\nthat the river is canoned between high mountains and precipices a\nlarge portion of its course, and that its banks and the country\ngenerally through which it flows are arid, sandy, and barren. Green and\nGrand Rivers are its principal upper tributaries, both of which rise in\nthe Rocky Mountains, and within the territories of the United States.\nThe Gila is its lowest and largest branch, emptying into the Colorado,\njust above its mouth. Sevier and Virgin Rivers are also tributaries of\nthe Colorado. Mary’s River rises near latitude 42 degrees north, and\nhas a course of about 400 miles, when its waters sink in the sands of\nthe desert. This river is not laid down on any map which I have seen.\nThe Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers have each a course of from 300 to\n400 miles, the first flowing from the north and the last from the\nsouth, and both emptying into the Bay of St. Francisco at the same\npoint. They water the large and fertile valley lying between the Sierra\nNevada and the coast range of mountains. I subjoin a description of the\nvalley and river San Joaquin, from the pen of a gentleman (Dr. Marsh)\nwho has explored the river from its source to its mouth.",
        "“This noble valley is the first undoubtedly in California, and one of\nthe most magnificent in the world. It is about 500 miles long, with\nan-average width of about fifty miles. It is bounded on the east by the\ngreat Snowy Mountains, and on the west by the low range, which in many\nplaces dwindles into insignificant hills, and has its northern terminus\nat the Strait of Carquines, on the Bay of San Francisco, and its\nsouthern near the Colorado River.",
        "“The river of San Joaquin flows through the middle of the valley for\nabout half of its extent, and thence diverges towards the eastern\nmountain, in which it has its source. About sixty miles further south\nis the northern end of the Buena Vista Lake, which is about one hundred\nmiles long, and from ten to twenty wide. Still farther south, and near\nthe western side of the valley, is another and much smaller lake.",
        "“The great lake receives about a dozen tributaries on its eastern side,\nwhich all rise in the great range of the Snowy Mountains. Some of these\nstreams flow through broad and fertile valleys within the mountain’s\nrange, and, from thence emerging, irrigate the plains of the great\nvalley for the distance of twenty or thirty miles. The largest of these\nrivers is called by the Spanish inhabitants the river Reyes, and falls\ninto the lake near its northern end; it is a well-timbered stream, and\nflows through a country of great fertility and beauty. The tributaries\nof the San Joaquin are all on the east side.",
        "“On ascending the stream we first meet with the Stanislaus, a clear\nrapid mountain stream, some forty or fifty yards wide, with a\nconsiderable depth of water in its lower portion. The Mormons have\ncommenced a settlement, called New Hope, and built some two or three\nhouses near the mouth.",
        "“There are considerable bodies of fertile land along the river, and the\nhigher plains afford good pasturage.",
        "“Ten miles higher up is the river of the Tawalomes; it is about the\nsize of the Stanislaus, which it greatly resembles, except that the\nsoil is somewhat better, and that it particularly abounds with salmon.",
        "“Some thirty miles farther comes in the Merced, much the largest of the\ntributaries of the San Joaquin. The lands along and between the\ntributaries of the San Joaquin and the lake of Buena Vista form a fine\npastoral region, with a good proportion of arable land, and a very\ninviting field for emigration. The whole of this region has been but\nimperfectly explored; enough, however, is known to make it certain that\nit is one of the most desirable regions on the continent.",
        "“In the valleys of the rivers which come down from the great Snowy\nMountains are vast bodies of pine, and red-wood, or cedar timber, and\nthe streams afford water power to any desirable amount.",
        "“The whole country east of the San Joaquin, and the water communication\nwhich connects it with the lakes, is considered, by the best judges, to\nbe particularly adapted to the culture of the vine, which must\nnecessarily become one of the principal agricultural resources of\nCalifornia.”",
        "The Salinas River empties into the Pacific, about twelve miles above\nMonterey. Bear River empties into the Great Salt Lake. The other\nstreams of California are all small. In addition to the Great Salt Lake\nand the Utah Lake there are numerous small lakes in the Sierra Nevada.\nThe San Joaquin is connected with Tule Lake, or Lake Buena Vista, a\nsheet of water about eighty miles in length and fifteen in breadth. A\nlake, not laid down in any map, and known as the Laguna among the\nCalifornians, is situated about sixty miles north of the Bay of San\nFrancisco. It is between forty and sixty miles in length. The valleys\nin its vicinity are highly fertile, and romantically beautiful. In the\nvicinity of this lake there is a mountain of pure sulphur. There are\nalso soda springs, and a great variety of other mineral waters, and\nminerals.",
        "The principal mountains west of the eastern boundary of California (the\nRocky Mountains) are the Bear River, Wahsatch, Utah, the Sierra Nevada,\nand the Coast range. The Wahsatch Mountains form the eastern rim of the\n\"great interior basin.” There are numerous ranges in this desert basin,\nall of which run north and south, and are separated from each other by\nspacious and barren valleys and plains. The Sierra Nevada range is of\ngreater elevation than the Rocky Mountains. The summits of the most\nelevated peaks are covered with perpetual snow. This and the coast\nrange run nearly parallel with the shore of the Pacific. The first is\nfrom 100 to 200 miles from the Pacific, and the last from forty to\nsixty miles. The valley between them is the most fertile portion of\nCalifornia.",
        "Upper California was discovered in 1548, by Cabrillo, a Spanish\nnavigator. In 1578, the northern portion of it was visited by Sir\nFrancis Drake, who called it New Albion. It was first colonized by the\nSpaniards, in 1768, and formed a province of Mexico until after the\nrevolution in that country. There have been numerous revolutions and\ncivil wars in California within the last twenty years; but up to the\nconquest of the country by the United States in 1846, Mexican authority\nhas generally been exercised over it.",
        "The following description of the political and social condition of\nUpper California in 1822 is extracted and translated from a Spanish\nwriter of that date. I have thought that the extract would not be\nuninteresting:–",
        "“Government.–Upper California, on account of its small population,\nnot being able to become a state of the great Mexican republic, takes\nthe character of territory, the government of which is under the charge\nof a commandant-general, who exercises the charge of a superior\npolitical chief, whose attributes depend entirely upon the president of\nthe republic and the general congress. But, to amplify the legislation\nof its centre, it has a deputation made up of seven vocals, the half of\nthese individuals being removed every two years. The superior political\nchief presides at their sessions. The inhabitants of the territory are\ndivided amongst the presidios, missions, and towns.",
        "“Presidios.–The necessity of protecting the apostolic predication\nwas the obligatory reason for forming the presidios, which were\nestablished according to circumstances. That of San Diego was the\nfirst; Santa Barbara, Monterey, and San Francisco were built\nafterwards. The form of all of them is nearly the same, and this is a\nsquare, containing about two hundred yards in each front, formed of a\nweak wall made of mud-bricks. Its height may be four yards in the\ninterior of the square, and built on to the same wall. In its entire\ncircumference are a chapel, storehouses, and houses for the commandant,\nofficers, and troops, having at the entrance of the presidio quarters\nfor a corps-de-garde.",
        "“These buildings in the presidios, at the first idea, appear to have\nbeen sufficient, the only object having been for a defence against a\nsurprise from the gentiles, or wild Indians in the immediate vicinity.\nBut this cause having ceased, I believe they ought to be demolished, as\nthey are daily threatening a complete ruin, and, from the very limited\nspaces of habitation, must be very incommodious to those who inhabit\nthem. As to the exterior of the presidios, several private individuals\nhave built some very decent houses, and, having evinced great emulation\nin this branch of business, I have no doubt but in a short time we\nshall see very considerable towns in California.",
        "“At the distance of one, or at the most two miles from the presidio,\nand near to the anchoring-ground, is a fort, which has a few pieces of\nartillery of small calibre. The situation of most of them is very\nadvantageous for the defence of the port, though the form of the walls,\nesplanades, and other imperfections which may be seen, make them very\ninsignificant.",
        "“The battalion of each presidio is made up of eighty or more horse\nsoldiers, called cuera; besides these, it has a number of auxiliary\ntroops and a detachment of artillery. The commandant of each presidio\nis the captain of its respective company, and besides the intervention,\nmilitary and political, he has charge of all things relating to the\nmarine department.",
        "“Missions.–The missions contained in the territory are twenty-one.\nThey were built at different epochs: that of San Diego, being the\nfirst, was built in 1769; its distance from the presidio of the same\nname is two leagues. The rest were built successively, according to\ncircumstances and necessity. The last one was founded in the year 1822,\nunder the name of San Francisco Dolores, and is the most northern of\nall.",
        "“The edifices in some of those missions are more extensive than in\nothers, but in form they are all nearly equal. They are all fabricated\nof mud-bricks, and the divisions are according to necessity. In all of\nthem may be found commodious habitations for the ministers, storehouses\nto keep their goods in, proportional granaries, offices for\nsoap-makers, weavers, blacksmiths, and large parterres, and horse and\ncattle pens, independent apartments for Indian youths of each sex, and\nall such offices as were necessary at the time of its institution.\nContiguous to and communicating with the former is a church, forming a\npart of the edifices of each mission; they are all very proportionable,\nand are adorned with profusion.",
        "“The Indians reside about two hundred yards distant from the\nabove-mentioned edifice. This place is called the rancheria. Most of\nthe missions are made up of very reduced quarters, built with\nmud-bricks, forming streets, while in others the Indians have been\nallowed to follow their primitive customs; their dwellings being a sort\nof huts, in a conical shape, which at the most do not exceed four yards\nin diameter, and the top of the cone may be elevated three yards. They\nare built of rough sticks, covered with bulrushes or grass, in such a\nmanner as to completely protect the inhabitants from all the\ninclemencies of the weather. In my opinion, these rancherias are the\nmost adequate to the natural uncleanliness of the Indians, as the\nfamilies often renew them, burning the old ones, and immediately\nbuilding others with the greatest facility. Opposite the rancherias,\nand near to the mission, is to be found a small garrison, with\nproportionate rooms, for a corporal and five soldiers with their\nfamilies. This small garrison is quite sufficient to prevent any\nattempt of the Indians from taking effect, there having been some\nexamples made, which causes the Indians to respect this small force.\nOne of these pickets in a mission has a double object; besides keeping\nthe Indians in subjection, they run post with a monthly correspondence,\nor with any extraordinaries that may be necessary for government.",
        "“All the missions in this California are under the charge of religious\nmen of the order of San Francisco. At the present time their number is\ntwenty-seven, most of them of an advanced age. Each mission has one of\nthese fathers for its administrator, and he holds absolute authority.\nThe tilling of the ground, the gathering of the harvest, the\nslaughtering of cattle, the weaving, and everything that concerns the\nmission, is under the direction of the fathers, without any other\nperson interfering in any way whatever, so that, if any one mission has\nthe good fortune to be superintended by an industrious and discreet\npadre, the Indians disfrute in abundance all the real necessaries of\nlife; at the same time the nakedness and misery of any one mission are\na palpable proof of the inactivity of its director. The missions extend\ntheir possessions from one extremity of the territory to the other, and\nhave made the limits of one mission from those of another. Though they\ndo not require all this land for their agriculture and the maintenance\nof their stock, they have appropriated the whole; always strongly\nopposing any individual who may wish to settle himself or his family on\nany piece of land between them. But it is to be hoped that the new\nsystem of illustration, and the necessity of augmenting private\nproperly, and the people of reason, will cause the government to take\nsuch adequate measures as will conciliate the interests of all. Amongst\nall the missions there are from twenty-one to twenty-two thousand\nCatholic Indians; but each mission has not an equal or a proportionate\npart in its congregation. Some have three or four thousand, whilst\nothers have scarcely four hundred; and at this difference may be\ncomputed the riches of the missions in proportion. Besides the number\nof Indians already spoken of, each mission has a considerable number of\ngentiles, who live chiefly on farms annexed to the missions. The number\nof these is undetermined.",
        "“The Indians are naturally filthy and careless, and their understanding\nis very limited. In the small arts they are not deficient in ideas of\nimitation but they never will be inventors. Their true character is\nthat of being revengeful and timid, consequently they are very much\naddicted to treachery. They have no knowledge of benefits received, and\ningratitude is common amongst them. The education they receive in their\ninfancy is not the proper one to develope their reason, and, if it\nwere, I do not believe them capable of any good impression. All these\nIndians, whether from the continual use of the sweat-house, or from\ntheir filthiness, or the little ventilation in their habitations, are\nweak and unvigorous; spasms and rheumatics, to which they are so much\nsubject, are the consequences of their customs. But what most injures\nthem, and prevents propagation, is the venereal disease, which most of\nthem have very strongly, clearly proving that their humours are\nanalogous to receiving the impressions of this contagion. From this\nreason may be deduced the enormous differences between the births and\ndeaths, which, without doubt, is one-tenth per year in favour of the\nlatter; but the missionaries do all in their power to prevent this,\nwith respect to the catechumens situated near them.",
        "“The general productions of the missions are, the breed of the larger\nclass of cattle, and sheep, horses, wheat, maize or Indian corn, beans,\npeas, and other vegetables; though the productions of the missions\nsituated more to the southward are more extensive, these producing the\ngrape and olive in abundance. Of all these articles of production, the\nmost lucrative is the large cattle, their hides and tallow affording an\nactive commerce with foreign vessels on this coast. This being the only\nmeans the inhabitants, missionaries, or private individuals have of\nsupplying their actual necessities, for this reason they give this\nbranch all the impulse they possibly can, and on it generally place all\ntheir attention.",
        "“It is now six years since they began to gather in hides and tallow for\ncommerce. Formerly they merely took care of as many or as much as they\nrequired for their own private use, and the rest was thrown away as\nuseless; but at this time the actual number of hides sold annually on\nboard of foreign vessels amounts to thirty or forty thousand, and about\nthe same amount of arrobas (twenty-five pounds) of tallow; and, in\npursuing their present method, there is no doubt but in three or four\nyears the amount of the exportation of each of these articles will be\ndoubled. Flax, linen, wine, olive-oil, grain, and other agricultural\nproductions, would be very extensive if there were stimulants to excite\nindustry; but, this not being the case, there is just grain enough sown\nand reaped for the consumption of the inhabitants in the territory.",
        "“The towns contained in this district are three; the most populous\nbeing that of Angeles, which has about twelve hundred souls; that of\nSt. Joseph’s of Guadaloupe may contain six hundred, and the village of\nBranciforte two hundred; they are all formed imperfectly and without\norder, each person having built his own house on the spot he thought\nmost convenient for himself. The first of these pueblos is governed by\nits corresponding body of magistrates, composed of an alcalde or judge,\nfour regidores or municipal officers, a syndic, and secretary; the\nsecond, of an alcalde, two regidores, a syndic, and secretary; and the\nthird, on account of the smallness of its population, is subject to the\ncommandancia of Monterey.",
        "“The inhabitants of the towns are white, and, to distinguish them from\nthe Indians, are vulgarly called people of reason. The number of\nthese contained in the territory may be nearly five thousand. These\nfamilies are divided amongst the pueblos and presidios. They are nearly\nall the descendants of a small number of individuals who came from the\nMexican country, some as settlers, others in the service of the army,\nand accompanied by their wives. In the limited space of little more\nthan fifty years the present generation has been formed.",
        "“The whites are in general robust, healthy, and well made. Some of them\nare occupied in breeding and raising cattle, and cultivating small\nquantities of wheat and beans; but for want of sufficient land, for\nwhich they cannot obtain a rightful ownership, their labours are very\nlimited. Others dedicate themselves to the service of arms. All the\npresidial companies are composed of the natives of the country, but the\nmost of them are entirely indolent, it being very rare for any\nindividual to strive to augment his fortune. Dancing, horse-riding, and\ngambling occupy all their time. The arts are entirely unknown, and I am\ndoubtful if there is one individual who exercises any trade; very few\nwho understand the first rudiments of letters, and the other sciences\nare unknown amongst them.",
        "“The fecundity of the people of reason is extreme. It is very rare to\nfind a married couple with less than five or six children, while there\nare hundreds who have from twelve to fifteen. Very few of them die in\ntheir youth, and in reaching the age of puberty are sure to see their\ngrand-children. The age of eighty and one hundred has always been\ncommon in this climate; most infirmities are unknown here, and the\nfreshness and robustness of the people show the beneficial influence of\nthe climate; the women in particular have always the roses stamped on\ntheir cheeks. This beautiful species is without doubt the most active\nand laborious, all their vigilance in duties of the house, the\ncleanliness of their children, and attention to their husbands,\ndedicating all their leisure moments to some kind of occupation that\nmay be useful towards their maintenance. Their clothing is always clean\nand decent, nakedness being entirely unknown in either sex.",
        "“Ports and Commerce.–There are four ports, principal bays, in this\nterritory, which take the names of the corresponding presidios. The\nbest guarded is that of San Diego. That of San Francisco has many\nadvantages. Santa Barbara is but middling in the best part of the\nseason; at other times always bad. Besides the above-mentioned places,\nvessels sometimes anchor at Santa Cruz, San Luis Obispo, El Refugio,\nSan Pedro, and San Juan, that they may obtain the productions of the\nmissions nearest these last-mentioned places; but from an order sent by\nthe minister of war, and circulated by the commandante-general, we are\ngiven to understand that no foreign vessel is permitted to anchor at\nany of these places, Monterey only excepted, notwithstanding the\ncommandante-general has allowed the first three principal ports to\nremain open provisionally. Were it not so, there would undoubtedly be\nan end to all commerce with California, as I will quickly show.",
        "“The only motive that induces foreign vessels to visit this coast is\nfor the hides and tallow which they barter for in the territory. It is\nwell known, that at any of these parts there is no possibility of\nrealizing any money, for here it does not circulate. The goods imported\nby foreign vessels are intended to facilitate the purchase of the\naforesaid articles, well knowing that the missions have no interest in\nmoney, but rather such goods as are necessary for the Indians, so that\nseveral persons who have brought goods to sell for nothing but money\nhave not been able to sell them. It will appear very extraordinary that\nmoney should not be appreciated in a country where its value is so well\nknown; but the reason may be easily perceived by attending to the\ncircumstances of the territory.",
        "“The quantity of hides gathered yearly is about thirty or forty\nthousand; and the arrobas of tallow, with very little difference, will\nbe about the same. Averaging the price of each article at two dollars,\nwe shall see that the intrinsic value in annual circulation in\nCalifornia is 140,000 dollars. This sum, divided between twenty-one\nmissions, will give each one 6666 dollars. Supposing the only\nproduction of the country converted into money, with what would the\nIndians be clothed, and by what means would they be able to cover a\nthousand other necessaries? Money is useful in amplifying speculations;\nbut in California, as yet, there are no speculations, and it\nproductions are barely sufficient for the absolute necessary\nconsumption. The same comparison may be made with respect to private\nindividuals, who are able to gather a few hides and a few arrobas of\ntallow, these being in small quantities.”",

        "September 13th.–We commenced to-day our journey from New Helvetia to\nSan Francisco. Our party consisted, including myself, of Colonel\nRussell, Dr. McKee of Monterey, Mr. Pickett, a traveller in the\ncountry, recently from Oregon, and an Indian servant, who had been\nfurnished us by Captain Sutter. Starting about 3 o’clock P.M., we\ntravelled in a south course over a flat plain until sunset, and\nencamped near a small lake on the rancho of Mr. Murphy, near the\nCosçumne River, a tributary of the Sacramento, which heads near the\nfoot of the Sierra Nevada. The stream is small, but the bottom-lands\nare extensive and rich. Mr. Murphy has been settled in California about\ntwo years, and, with his wife and several children, has resided at this\nplace sixteen months, during which time he has erected a comfortable\ndwelling-house, and other necessary buildings and conveniences. His\nwheat crop was abundant this year; and he presented us with as much\nmilk and fresh butter as we desired. The grass on the upland plain over\nwhich we have travelled is brown and crisp from the annual drought. In\nthe low bottom it is still green. Distance 18 miles.",
        "September 14.–We crossed the Cosçumne River about a mile from our\ncamp, and travelled over a level plain covered with luxuriant grass,\nand timbered with the evergreen oak, until three o’clock, when we\ncrossed the Mickélemes River, another tributary of the Sacramento, and\nencamped on its southern bank in a beautiful grove of live oaks. The\nMickélemes, where we crossed it, is considerably larger than the\nCosçumnes. The soil of the bottom appears to be very rich, and produces\nthe finest qualities of grasses. The grass on the upland is also\nabundant, but at this time it is brown and dead. We passed through\nlarge tracts of wild oats during the day; the stalks are generally from\nthree to five feet in length.",
        "Our Indian servant, or vaquero, feigned sickness this morning, and we\ndischarged him. As soon as he obtained his discharge, he was entirely\nrelieved from the excruciating agonies under which he had affected to\nbe suffering for several hours. Eating his breakfast, and mounting his\nhorse, he galloped off in the direction of the fort. We overtook this\nafternoon an English sailor, named Jack, who was travelling towards\nMonterey; and we employed him as cook and hostler for the remainder of\nthe journey.",
        "A variety of autumnal flowers, generally of a brilliant yellow, are in\nbloom along the beautiful and romantic bunks of the rivulet. Distance\n25 miles.",
        "September 15.–Our horses were frightened last night by bears, and\nthis morning, with the exception of those which were picketed, had\nstrayed so far that we did not recover them until ten o’clock. Our\nroute has continued over a flat plain, generally covered with luxuriant\ngrass, wild oats, and a variety of sparkling flowers. The soil is\ncomposed of a rich argillaceous loam. Large tracts of the land are\nevidently subject to annual inundations. About noon we reached a small\nlake surrounded by tule. There being no trail for our guidance, we\nexperienced some difficulty in shaping our course so as to strike the\nSan Joaquin River at the usual fording place. Our man Jack, by some\nneglect or mistake of his own, lost sight of us, and we were compelled\nto proceed without him. This afternoon we saw several large droves of\nantelope and deer. Game of all kinds appears to be very abundant in\nthis rich valley. Passing through large tracts of tule, we reached\nthe San Joaquin River at dark, and encamped on the eastern bank. Here\nwe immediately made large fires, and discharged pistols as signals to\nour man Jack, but he did not come into camp. Distance 35 miles.",
        "September 16.–Jack came into camp while we were breakfasting,\nleading his tired horse. He had bivouacked on the plain, and, fearful\nthat his horse would break loose if he tied him, he held the animal by\nthe bridle all night.",
        "The ford of the San Joaquin is about forty or fifty miles from its\nmouth. At this season the water is at its lowest stage. The stream at\nthe ford is probably one hundred yards in breadth, and our animals\ncrossed it without much difficulty, the water reaching about midway of\ntheir bodies. Oak and small willows are the principal growth of wood\nskirting the river. Soon after we crossed the San Joaquin this morning\nwe met two men, couriers, bearing despatches from Commodore Stockton,\nthe governor and commander-in-chief in California, to Sutter’s Fort.\nEntering upon the broad plain, we passed, in about three miles, a small\nlake, the water of which was so much impregnated with alkali as to be\nundrinkable. The grass is brown and crisp, but the seed upon it is\nevidence that it had fully matured before the drought affected it. The\nplain is furrowed with numerous deep trails, made by the droves of wild\nhorses, elk, deer, and antelope, which roam over and graze upon it. The\nhunting sportsman can here enjoy his favourite pleasure to its fullest\nextent.",
        "Having determined to deviate from our direct course, in order to visit\nthe rancho of Dr. Marsh, we parted from Messrs. McKee and Pickett about\nnoon. We passed during the afternoon several tule marshes, with which\nthe plain of the San Joaquin is dotted. At a distance, the tule of\nthese marshes presents the appearance of immense fields of ripened\ncorn. The marshes are now nearly dry, and to shorten our journey we\ncrossed several of them without difficulty. A month earlier, this would\nnot have been practicable. I have but little doubt that these marshes\nwould make fine rice plantations, and perhaps, if properly drained,\nthey might produce the sugar-cane.",
        "While pursuing our journey we frequently saw large droves of wild\nhorses and elk grazing quietly upon the plain. No spectacle of moving\nlife can present a more animated and beautiful appearance than a herd\nof wild horses. They were divided into droves of some one or two\nhundred. When they noticed us, attracted by curiosity to discover what\nwe were, they would start and run almost with the fleetness of the wind\nin the direction towards us. But, arriving within a distance of two\nhundred yards, they would suddenly halt, and after bowing their necks\ninto graceful curves, and looking steadily at us a few moments, with\nloud snortings they would wheel about and bound away with the same\nlightning speed. These evolutions they would repeat several times,\nuntil, having satisfied their curiosity, they would bid us a final\nadieu, and disappear behind the undulations of the plain.",
        "The herds of elk were much more numerous. Some of them numbered at\nleast two thousand, and with their immense antlers presented, when\nrunning, a very singular and picturesque appearance. We approached some\nof these herds within fifty yards before they took the alarm. Beef in\nCalifornia is so abundant, and of so fine a quality, that game is but\nlittle hunted, and not much prized, hence the elk, deer, and even\nantelope are comparatively very tame, and rarely run from the\ntraveller, unless he rides very near them. Some of these elk are as\nlarge as a medium-sized Mexican mule.",
        "We arrived at the rancho of Dr. Marsh about 5 o’clock P.M., greatly\nfatigued with the day’s ride. The residence of Dr. M. is romantically\nsituated, near the foot of one of the most elevated mountains in the\nrange separating the valley of the San Joaquin from the plain\nsurrounding the Bay of San Francisco. It is called “Mount Diablo,” and\nmay be seen in clear weather a great distance. The dwelling of Dr. M.\nis a small one-story house, rudely constructed of adobes, and divided\ninto two or three apartments. The flooring is of earth, like the walls.\nA table or two, and some benches and a bed, are all the furniture it\ncontains. Such are the privations to which those who settle in new\ncountries must submit. Dr. M. is a native of New England, a graduate of\nHarvard University, and a gentleman of fine natural abilities and\nextensive scientific and literary acquirements. He emigrated to\nCalifornia some seven or eight years since, after having travelled\nthrough most of the Mexican States. He speaks the Spanish language\nfluently and correctly, and his accurate knowledge of Mexican\ninstitutions, laws, and customs was fully displayed in his conversation\nin regard to them. He obtained the grant of land upon which he now\nresides, some ten or twelve miles square, four or fire years ago; and\nalthough he has been constantly harassed by the wild Indians, who have\nseveral times stolen all his horses, and sometimes numbers of his\ncattle, he has succeeded in permanently establishing himself. The\npresent number of cattle on his rancho is about two thousand, and the\nincrease of the present year he estimates at five hundred.",
        "I noticed near the house a vegetable garden, with the usual variety of\nvegetables. In another inclosure was the commencement of an extensive\nvineyard, the fruit of which (now ripe) exceeds in delicacy of flavour\nany grapes which I have ever tasted. This grape is not indigenous, but\nwas introduced by the padres, when they first established themselves\nin the country. The soil and climate of California have probably\nimproved it. Many of the clusters are eight and ten inches in length,\nand weigh several pounds. The fruit is of medium size, and in colour a\ndark purple. The rind is very thin, and when broken the pulp dissolves\nin the mouth immediately. Although Dr. M. has just commenced his\nvineyard, he has made several casks of wine this year, which is now in\na stale of fermentation. I tasted here, for the first time,\naguardiénte, or brandy distilled from the Californian grape. Its\nflavour is not unpleasant, and age, I do not doubt, would render it\nequal to the brandies of France. Large quantities of wine and\naguardiénte are made from the extensive vineyards farther south. Dr.\nM. informed me that his lands had produced a hundredfold of wheat\nwithout irrigation. This yield seems almost incredible; but, if we can\nbelieve the statements of men of unimpeached veracity, there have been\nnumerous instances of reproduction of wheat in California equalling and\neven exceeding this.",
        "Some time in July, a vessel arrived at San Francisco from New York,\nwhich had been chartered and freighted principally by a party of Mormon\nemigrants, numbering between two and three hundred, women and children\nincluded. These Mormons are about making a settlement for agricultural\npurposes on the San Joaquin River, above the rancho of Dr. Marsh. Two\nof the women and one of the men are now here, waiting for the return of\nthe main party, which has gone up the river to explore and select a\nsuitable site for the settlement. The women are young, neatly dressed,\nand one of them may be called good-looking. Captain Gant, formerly of\nthe U.S. Army, in very bad health, is also residing here. He has\ncrossed the Rocky Mountains eight times, and, in various trapping\nexcursions, has explored nearly every river between the settlements of\nthe United States and the Pacific Ocean.",
        "The house of Dr. Marsh being fully occupied, we made our beds in a\nshed, a short distance from it. Suspended from one of the poles forming\nthe frame of this shed was a portion of the carcass of a recently\nslaughtered beef. The meat was very fat, the muscular portions of it\npresenting that marbled appearance, produced by a mixture of the fat\nand lean, so agreeable to the sight and palate of the epicure. The\nhorned cattle of California, which I have thus far seen, are the\nlargest and the handsomest in shape which I ever saw. There is\ncertainly no breed in the United States equalling them in size. They,\nas well as the horses, subsist entirely on the indigenous grasses, at\nall seasons of the year; and such are the nutritious qualities of the\nherbage, that the former are always in condition for slaughtering, and\nthe latter have as much flesh upon them as is desirable, unless (which\nis often the case) they are kept up at hard work and denied the\nprivilege of eating, or are broken down by hard riding. The varieties\nof grass are very numerous, and nearly all of them are heavily seeded\nwhen ripe, and are equal, if not superior, as food for animals, to corn\nand oats. The horses are not as large as the breeds of the United\nStates, but in point of symmetrical proportions and in capacity for\nendurance they are fully equal to our best breeds. The distance we have\ntravelled to-day I estimate at thirty-five miles.",
        "September 17.–The temperature of the mornings is most agreeable, and\nevery other phenomenon accompanying it is correspondingly delightful to\nthe senses. Our breakfast consisted of warm bread, made of unbolted\nflour, stewed beef, seasoned with chile colorado, a species of red\npepper, and frijoles, a dark-coloured bean, with coffee. After\nbreakfast I walked with Dr. Marsh to the summit of a conical hill,\nabout a mile distant from his house, from which the view of the plain\non the north, south, and east, and the more broken and mountainous\ncountry on the west, is very extensive and picturesque. The hills and\nthe plain are ornamented with the evergreen oak, sometimes in clumps or\ngroves, at others standing solitary. On the summits, and in the gorges\nof the mountains, the cedar, pine, and fir display their tall\nsymmetrical shapes; and the San Joaquin, at a distance of about ten\nmiles, is belted by a dense forest of oak, sycamore, and smaller timber\nand shrubbery. The herds of cattle are scattered over the plain,–some\nof them grazing upon the brown but nutritious grass; others sheltering\nthemselves from the sun under the wide-spreading branches of the oaks.\nThe tout ensemble of the landscape is charming.",
        "Leaving Dr. Marsh’s about three o’clock P.M., we travelled fifteen\nmiles, over a rolling and well-watered country, covered generally with\nwild oats, and arrived at the residence of Mr. Robert Livermore just\nbefore dark. We were most kindly and hospitably received, and\nentertained by Mr. L. and his interesting family. After our mules and\nbaggage had been cared for, we were introduced to the principal room in\nthe house, which consisted of a number of small adobe buildings,\nerected apparently at different times, and connected together. Here we\nfound chairs, and, for the first time in California, saw a side-board\nset out with glass tumblers and chinaware. A decanter of aguardiénte,\na bowl of loaf sugar, and a pitcher of cold water from the spring, were\nset before us, and, being duly honoured, had a most reviving influence\nupon our spirits as well as our corporeal energies. Suspended from the\nwalls of the room were numerous coarse engravings, highly coloured with\ngreen, blue, and crimson paints, representing the Virgin Mary, and many\nof the saints. These engravings are held in great veneration by the\ndevout Catholics of this country. In the corners of the room were two\ncomfortable-looking beds, with clean white sheets and pillow-cases, a\nsight with which my eyes have not been greeted for many months.",
        "The table was soon set out, and covered with a linen cloth of snowy\nwhiteness, upon which were placed dishes of stewed beef, seasoned with\nchile Colorado, frijoles, and a plentiful supply of tortillas, with\nan excellent cup of tea, to the merits of which we did ample justice.\nNever were men blessed with better appetites than we are at the present\ntime.",
        "Mr. Livermore has been a resident of California nearly thirty years,\nand, having married into one of the wealthy families of the country, is\nthe proprietor of some of the best lands for tillage and grazing. An\narroyo, or small rivulet fed by springs, runs through his rancho, in\nsuch a course that, if expedient, he could, without much expense,\nirrigate one or two thousand acres. Irrigation in this part of\nCalifornia, however, seems to be entirely unnecessary for the\nproduction of wheat or any of the small grains. To produce maize,\npotatoes, and garden vegetables, irrigation is indispensable. Mr.\nLivermore has on his rancho about 3500 head of cattle. His horses,\nduring the late disturbances, have nearly all been driven off or stolen\nby the Indians. I saw in his corral a flock of sheep numbering several\nhundred. They are of good size, and the mutton is said to be of an\nexcellent quality, but the wool is coarse. It is, however, well adapted\nto the only manufacture of wool that is carried on in the\ncountry,–coarse blankets and serápes. But little attention is paid\nto hogs here, although the breeds are as fine as I have ever seen\nelsewhere. Beef being so abundant, and of a quality so superior, pork\nis not prized by the native Californians.",
        "The Senora L. is the first Hispano-American lady I have seen since\narriving in the country. She was dressed in a white cambric robe,\nloosely banded round the waist, and without ornament of any kind,\nexcept several rings on her small delicate fingers. Her complexion is\nthat of a dark brunette, but lighter and more clear than the skin of\nmost Californian women. The dark lustrous eye, the long black and\nglossy hair, the natural ease, grace, and vivacity of manners and\nconversation, characteristic of Spanish ladies, were fully displayed by\nher from the moment of our introduction. The children, especially two\nor three little senoritas, were very beautiful, and manifested a\nremarkable degree of sprightliness and intelligence. One of them\npresented me with a small basket wrought from a species of tough grass,\nand ornamented with the plumage of birds of a variety of brilliant\ncolours. It was a beautiful specimen of Indian ingenuity.",
        "Retiring to bed about ten o’clock, I enjoyed, the first time for four\nmonths, the luxury of clean sheets, with a mattress and a soft pillow.\nMy enjoyment, however, was not unmixed with regret, for I noticed that\nseveral members of the family, to accommodate us with lodgings in the\nhouse, slept in the piazza outside. To have objected to sleeping in the\nhouse, however, would have been considered discourteous and offensive.",
        "September 18.–Early this morning a bullock was brought up and\nslaughtered in front of the house. The process of slaughtering a beef\nis as follows: a vaquero, mounted on a trained horse, and provided\nwith a lasso, proceeds to the place where the herd is grazing.\nSelecting an animal, he soon secures it by throwing the noose of the\nlasso over the horns, and fastening the other end around the pommel of\nthe saddle. During the first struggles of the animal for liberty, which\nusually are very violent, the vaquero sits firmly in his seat, and\nkeeps his horse in such a position that the fury and strength of the\nbeast are wasted without producing any other result than his own\nexhaustion. The animal, soon ascertaining that he cannot release\nhimself from the rope, submits to be pulled along to the place of\nexecution. Arriving here, the vaquero winds the lasso round the legs of\nthe doomed beast, and throws him to the ground, where he lies perfectly\nhelpless and motionless. Dismounting from his horse, he then takes from\nhis leggin the butcher-knife that he always carries with him, and\nsticks the animal in the throat. He soon bleeds to death, when, in an\nincredibly short space of time for such a performance, the carcass is\nflayed and quartered, and the meat is either roasting before the fire\nor simmering in the stew-pan. The lassoing and slaughter of a bullock\nis one of the most exciting sports of the Californians; and the daring\nhorsemanship and dexterous use of the lariat usually displayed on these\noccasions are worthy of admiration. I could not but notice the\nGolgotha-like aspect of the grounds surrounding the house. The bones of\ncattle were thickly strewn in all directions, showing a terrible\nslaughter of the four-footed tribe and a prodigious consumption of\nflesh.",
        "A carretada of fossil oyster–shells was shown to me by Mr.\nLivermore, which had been hauled for the purpose of being manufactured\ninto lime. Some of these shells were eight inches in length, and of\ncorresponding breadth and thickness. They were dug from a hill two or\nthree miles distant, which is composed almost entirely of this fossil.\nSeveral bones belonging to the skeleton of a whale, discovered by Mr.\nL. on the summit of one of the highest elevations in the vicinity of\nhis residence, were shown to me. The skeleton when discovered was\nnearly perfect and entirely exposed, and its elevation above the level\nof the sea between one and two thousand feet. How the huge aquatic\nmonster, of which this skeleton is the remains, managed to make his dry\nbed on the summit of an elevated mountain, more experienced geologists\nthan myself will hereafter determine. I have an opinion on the subject,\nhowever; but it is so contrary in some respects to the received\ngeological theories, that I will not now hazard it.",
        "Leaving Mr. Livermore’s about nine o’clock A.M., we travelled three or\nfour miles over a level plain, upon which immense herds of cattle were\ngrazing. When we approached, they fled from us with as much alarm as\nherds of deer and elk. From this plain we entered a hilly country,\ncovered to the summits of the elevations with wild oats and tufts or\nhunches of a species of grass, which remains green through the whole\nseason. Cattle were scattered through these hills, and more sumptuous\ngrazing they could not desire. Small streams of water, fed by springs,\nflow through the hollows and ravines, which, as well as the hill-sides,\nare timbered with the evergreen oak and a variety of smaller trees.\nAbout two o’clock, P.M., we crossed an arroyo which runs through a\nnarrow gorge of the hills, and struck an artificial wagon-road,\nexcavated and embanked so as to afford a passage for wheeled vehicles\nalong the steep hill-side. A little farther on we crossed a very rudely\nconstructed bridge. These are the first signs of road-making I have\nseen in the country. Emerging from the hills, the southern arm of the\nBay of San Francisco came in view, separated from us by a broad and\nfertile plain, some ten or twelve miles in width, sloping gradually\ndown to the shore of the bay, and watered by several small creeks and\nestuaries.",
        "We soon entered through a narrow street the mission of San José, or St.\nJoseph. Passing the squares of one-story adobe buildings once inhabited\nby thousands of busy Indians, but now deserted, roofless, and crumbling\ninto ruins, we reached the plaza in front of the church, and the\nmassive two-story edifices occupied by the padres during the\nflourishing epoch of the establishment. These were in good repair; but\nthe doors and windows, with the exception of one, were closed, and\nnothing of moving life was visible except a donkey or two, standing\nnear a fountain which gushed its waters into a capacious stone trough.\nDismounting from our mules, we entered the open door, and here we found\ntwo Frenchmen dressed in sailor costume, with a quantity of coarse\nshirts, pantaloons, stockings, and other small articles, together with\naguardiénte, which they designed retailing to such of the natives in\nthe vicinity as chose to become their customers. They were itinerant\nmerchants, or pedlars, and had opened their wares here for a day or two\nonly, or so long as they could find purchasers.",
        "Having determined to remain here the residue of the day and the night,\nwe inquired of the Frenchmen if there was any family in the place that\ncould furnish us with food. They directed us to a house on the opposite\nside of the plaza, to which we immediately repaired. The senora, a\ndark-skinned and rather shrivelled and filthy specimen of the fair sex,\nbut with a black, sparkling, and intelligent eye, met us at the door of\nthe miserable hovel, and invited us in. In one corner of this wretched\nand foul abode was a pile of raw hides, and in another a heap of wheat.\nThe only furniture it contained were two small benches, or stools, one\nof which, being higher than the other, appeared to have been\nconstructed for a table. We informed the senora that we were\ntravellers, and wished refreshment and lodgings for the night. ’Esta\nbueno, senores, esta bueno,” was her reply; and she immediately left\nus, and, opening the door of the kitchen, commenced the preparation of\nour dinner. The interior of the kitchen, of which I had a good view\nthrough the door, was more revolting in its filthiness than the room in\nwhich we were seated. In a short time, so industrious was our hostess,\nour dinner, consisting of two plates of jerked beef, stewed, and\nseasoned with chile colorado, a plate of tortillas, and a bowl of\ncoffee, was set out upon the most elevated stool. There were no knives,\nforks, or spoons, on the table. Our amiable landlady apologized for\nthis deficiency of table-furniture, saying that she was ’muy pobre“\n(very poor), and possessed none of these table implements. “Fingers\nwere made before forks,” and in our recent travels we had learned to\nuse them as substitutes, so that we found no difficulty in conveying\nthe meat from the plates to our mouths.",
        "Belonging to the mission are two gardens, inclosed by high adobe walls.\nAfter dinner we visited one of these. The area of the inclosure\ncontains fifteen or twenty acres of ground, the whole of which was\nplanted with fruit trees and grape-vines. There are about six hundred\npear trees, and a large number of apple and peach trees, all bearing\nfruit in great abundance and in full perfection. The quality of the\npears is excellent, but the apples and peaches are indifferent. The\ngrapes have been gathered, as I suppose, for I saw none upon the vines,\nwhich appeared healthy and vigorous. The gardens are irrigated with\nvery little trouble, from large springs which flow from the hills a\nshort distance above them. Numerous aqueducts, formerly conveying and\ndistributing water over an extensive tract of land surrounding the\nmission, are still visible, but as the land is not now cultivated, they\nat present contain no water.",
        "The mission buildings cover fifty acres of ground, perhaps more, and\nare all constructed of adobes with tile roofs. Those houses or barracks\nwhich were occupied by the Indian families are built in compact\nsquares, one story in height. They are generally partitioned into two\nrooms, one fronting on the street, the other upon a court or corral in\nthe rear. The main buildings of the mission are two stories in height,\nwith wide corridors in front and rear. The walls are massive, and, if\nprotected from the winter rains, will stand for ages. But if exposed to\nthe storms by the decay of the projecting roofs, or by leaks in the\nmain roof, they will soon crumble, or sink into shapeless heaps of mud.\nI passed through extensive warehouses and immense rooms, once occupied\nfor the manufacture of woollen blankets and other articles, with the\nrude machinery still standing in them, but unemployed. Filth and\ndesolation have taken the place of cleanliness and busy life. The\ngranary was very capacious, and its dimensions were an evidence of the\nexuberant fertility of the soil, when properly cultivated under the\nsuperintendence of the padres. The calaboose is a miserable dark room\nof two apartments, one with a small loop-hole in the wall, the other a\ndungeon without light or ventilation. The stocks, and several other\ninventions for the punishment of offenders, are still standing in this\nprison. I requested permission to examine the interior of the church,\nbut it was locked up, and no person in the mission was in possession of\nthe key. Its length I should suppose is from one hundred to one hundred\nand twenty feet, and its breadth between thirty and forty, with small\nexterior pretensions to architectural ornament or symmetry of\nproportions.",
        "Returning from our rambles about the mission, we found that our\nlandlady had been reinforced by an elderly woman, whom she introduced\nas ’mi madre,” and two or three Indian muchachas, or girls, clad in\na costume not differing much from that of our mother Eve. The latter\nwere obese in their figures, and the mingled perspiration and filth\nstanding upon their skins were any thing but agreeable to the eye. The\ntwo senoras, with these handmaids near them, were sitting in front of\nthe house, busily engaged in executing some needlework.",
        "Supper being prepared and discussed, our landlady informed us that she\nhad a husband, who was absent, but would return in the course of the\nnight, and, if he found strange men in the house, he would be much\noffended with her. She had therefore directed her muchachas to sweep\nout one of the deserted and half-ruined rooms on the opposite square,\nto which we could remove our baggage, and in which we could lodge\nduring the night; and as soon as the necessary preparations were made,\nwe retired to our dismal apartment. The “compound of villanous smells\"\nwhich saluted our nostrils when we entered our dormitory for the night\naugured unfavourably for repose. The place had evidently been the abode\nof horses, cattle, pigs, and foul vermin of every description. But with\nthe aid of a dark-coloured tallow-candle, which gave just light enough\nto display the murkiness and filth surrounding us, we spread our beds\nin the cleanest places, and laid down to rest. Distance travelled, 18\nmiles.",

        "September 19.–Several Californians came into the mission during the\nnight or early this morning; among them the husband of our hostess, who\nwas very kind and cordial in his greetings.",
        "While our man Jack was saddling and packing the mules, they gathered\naround us to the number of a dozen or more, and were desirous of\ntrading their horses for articles of clothing; articles which many of\nthem appeared to stand greatly in need of, but which we had not to part\nfrom. Their pertinacity exceeded the bounds of civility, as I thought;\nbut I was not in a good humour, for the fleas, bugs, and other vermin,\nwhich infested our miserable lodgings, had caused me a sleepless night,\nby goring my body until the blood oozed from the skin in countless\nplaces. These ruinous missions are prolific generators, and the\nnurseries of vermin of all kinds, as the hapless traveller who tarries\nin them a few hours will learn to his sorrow. When these bloodthirsty\nassailants once make a lodgment in the clothing or bedding of the\nunfortunate victim of their attacks, such are their courage and\nperseverance, that they never capitulate. “Blood or death” is their\nmotto;–the war against them, to be successful, must be a war of\nextermination.",
        "Poor as our hostess was, she nevertheless was reluctant to receive any\ncompensation for her hospitality. We, however, insisted upon her\nreceiving a dollar from each of us (dos pesos), which she finally\naccepted; and after shaking us cordially by the hand she bade us an\naffectionate adios, and we proceeded on our journey.",
        "From the Mission of San José to the Pueblo of San José, the distance is\nfifteen miles, for the most part over a level and highly fertile plain,\nproducing a variety of indigenous grasses, among which I noticed\nseveral species of clover and mustard, large tracts of which we rode\nthrough, the stalks varying from six to ten feet in height. The plain\nis watered by several arroyos, skirted with timber, generally the\nevergreen oak.",
        "We met this morning a Californian carreta, or travelling-cart,\nfreighted with women and children, bound on a pleasure excursion. The\ncarreta is the rudest specimen of the wheeled vehicle I have seen.\nThe wheels are transverse sections of a log, and are usually about\n2-1/2 feet in diameter, and varying in thickness from the centre to the\nrim. These wheels are coupled together by an axletree, into which a\ntongue is inserted. On the axletree and tongue rests a frame,\nconstructed of square pieces of timber, six or eight feet in length,\nand four or five in breadth, into which are inserted a number of stakes\nabout, four feet in length. This frame-work being covered and floored\nwith raw hides, the carriage is complete. The carreta which we met\nwas drawn by two yokes of oxen, driven by an Indian vaquero, mounted on\na horse. In the rear were two caballeros, riding fine spirited\nhorses, with gaudy trappings. They were dressed in steeple-crowned\nglazed sombreros, serapes of fiery colours, velvet (cotton)\ncalzoneros, white cambric calzoncillos, and leggins and shoes of\nundressed leather. Their spurs were of immense size.",
        "The party halted as soon as we met them, the men touching their heavy\nsombreros, and uttering the usual salutation of the morning, ’Buenos\ndios, senores,” and shaking hands with us very cordially. The same\nsalutation was repeated by all the senoras and senoritas in the\ncarreta. In dress and personal appearance the women of this party\nwere much inferior to the men. Their skins were dark, sallow, and\nshrivelled; and their costume, a loose gown and reboso, were made of\nvery common materials. The children, however, were all handsome, with\nsparkling eyes and ruddy complexions. Women and children were seated,\nà la Turque, on the bottom of the carreta, there being no raised\nseats in the vehicle.",
        "We arrived at the Pueblo do San José about twelve o’clock. There being\nno hotels in California, we were much at a loss where to apply for\nrefreshments and lodgings for the night. Soon, however, we were met by\nCaptain Fisher, a native of Massachusetts, but a resident of this\ncountry for twenty years or more, who invited us to his house. We were\nmost civilly received by Senora F., who, although she did not speak\nEnglish, seemed to understand it very well. She is a native of the\nsouthern Pacific coast of Mexico, and a lady of fine manners and\npersonal appearance. Her oldest daughter, about thirteen years of age,\nis very beautiful. An excellent dinner was soon set out, with a variety\nof the native wines of California and other liquors. We could not have\nfelt ourselves more happy and more at home, even at our own firesides\nand in the midst of our own families.",
        "The Pueblo de San José is a village containing some six or eight\nhundred inhabitants. It is situated in what is called the “Pueblo\nValley,” about fifteen miles south of the southern shore of the Bay of\nSan Francisco. Through a navigable creek, vessels of considerable\nburden can approach the town within a distance of five or six miles.\nThe embarcadero, or landing, I think, is six miles from the Pueblo.\nThe fertile plain between this and the town, at certain seasons of the\nyear, is sometimes inundated. The “Pueblo Valley,” which is eighty or\none hundred miles in length, varying from ten to twenty in breadth, is\nwell watered by the Rio Santa Clara and numerous arroyos, and is one\nof the most fertile and picturesque plains in California. For pastoral\ncharms, fertility of soil, variety of productions, and delicious\nvoluptuousness of climate and scenery, it cannot be surpassed. This\nvalley, if properly cultivated, would alone produce breadstuffs enough\nto supply millions of population. The buildings of the Pueblo, with few\nexceptions, are constructed of adobes, and none of them have even the\nsmallest pretensions to architectural taste or beauty. The church,\nwhich is situated near the centre of the town, exteriorly resembles a\nhuge Dutch barn. The streets are irregular, every man having erected\nhis house in a position most convenient to him. Aqueducts convey water\nfrom the Santa Clara River to all parts of the town. In the main plaza\nhundreds, perhaps thousands, of squirrels, whose abodes are under\nground, have their residences. They are of a brownish colour, and about\nthe size of our common gray squirrel. Emerging from their subterraneous\nabodes, they skip and leap about over the plaza without the least\nconcern, no one molesting them.",
        "The population of the place is composed chiefly of native Californian\nland-proprietors. Their ranchos are in the valley, but their residences\nand gardens are in the town. We visited this afternoon the garden of\nSenor Don Antonio Sugnol. He received us with much politeness, and\nconducted us through his garden. Apples, pears, peaches, figs, oranges,\nand grapes, with other fruits which I do not now recollect, were\ngrowing and ripening. The grape-vines were bowed to the ground with the\nluxuriance arid weight of the yield; and more delicious fruit I never\ntasted. From the garden we crossed over to a flouring-mill recently\nerected by a son-in-law of Don Antonio, a Frenchman by birth. The mill\nis a creditable enterprise to the proprietor, and he will coin money\nfrom its operations.",
        "The Pueblo de San José is one of the oldest settlements in Alta\nCalifornia. Captain Fisher pointed out to me a house built of adobes,\nwhich has been standing between 80 and 90 years, and no house in the\nplace appeared to be more substantial or in better repair. A garrison,\ncomposed of marines from the United States’ ships, and volunteers\nenlisted from the American settlers in the country, is now stationed\nhere. The post is under the command of Purser Watmough, of the United\nStates sloop-of-war Portsmouth, commanded by Captain Montgomery. During\nthe evening I visited several public places (bar-rooms), where I saw\nmen and women engaged promiscuously at the game of monte. Gambling is\na universal vice in California. All classes and both sexes participate\nin its excitements to some extent. The games, however, while I was\npresent, were conducted with great propriety and decorum so far as the\nnative Californians were concerned. The loud swearing and other\nturbulent demonstrations generally proceeded from the unsuccessful\nforeigners. I could not but observe the contrast between the two races\nin this respect. The one bore their losses with stoical composure and\nindifference; the other announced each unsuccessful bet with profane\nimprecations and maledictions. Excitement prompted the hazards of the\nformer, avarice the latter.",
        "September 20.–The morning was cloudy and cool; but the clouds broke\naway about nine o’clock, and the sun shone from a vapourless sky, as\nusual. We met, at the Pueblo, Mr. Grove Cook, a native of Gerrard\ncounty, Ky., but for many years a resident of California. He is the\nproprietor of a rancho in the vicinity. We determined to leave our\nmules in charge of Mr. Cook’s vaquero, and proceed to San Francisco on\nhired horses. The distance from the Pueblo de San José to San Francisco\nis called sixty miles. The time occupied in performing the journey, on\nCalifornian horses at Californian speed, is generally six or seven\nhours. Procuring horses for the journey, and leaving our baggage, with\nthe exception of a change of clothing, we left the Pueblo about eleven\no’clock A.M.",
        "The mission of Santa Clara is situated about two and a half miles from\nthe town. A broad alameda, shaded by stately trees (elms and\nwillows), planted by the padres, extends nearly the entire distance,\nforming a most beautiful drive or walk for equestrians or pedestrians.\nThe motive of the padres in planting this avenue was to afford the\ndevout senoras and senoritas a shade from the sun, when walking from\nthe Pueblo to the church at the mission to attend mass. A few minutes\nover the smooth level road, at the rapid speed of our fresh Californian\nhorses, brought us to the mission, where we halted to make our\nobservations. This mission is not so extensive in its buildings as that\nof San José, but the houses are generally in better repair. They are\nconstructed of adobes; the church was open, and, entering the interior,\nI found the walls hung with coarse paintings and engravings of the\nsaints, etc., etc. The chancel decorated with numerous images, and\nsymbolical ornaments used by the priests in their worship. Gold-paper,\nand tinsel, in barbaric taste, are plastered without stint upon nearly\nevery object that meets the eye, so that, when on festive occasions the\nchurch is lighted, it must present a very glittering appearance.",
        "The rich lands surrounding the mission are entirely neglected. I did\nnot notice a foot of ground under cultivation, except the garden\ninclosure, which contained a variety of fruits and plants of the\ntemperate and tropical climates. From want of care these are fast\ndecaying. Some excellent pears were furnished us by Mrs. Bennett, an\nAmerican lady, of Amazonian proportions, who, with her family of sons,\nhas taken up her residence in one of the buildings of the mission. The\npicture of decay and ruin presented by this once flourishing\nestablishment, surrounded by a country so fertile and scenery so\nenchanting, is a most melancholy spectacle to the passing traveller,\nand speaks a language of loud condemnation against the government.",
        "Proceeding on our journey, we travelled fifteen miles over a flat\nplain, timbered with groves and parks of evergreen oaks, and covered\nwith a great variety of grasses, wild oats, and mustard. So rank is the\ngrowth of mustard in many places, that it is with difficulty that a\nhorse can penetrate through it. Numerous birds flitted from tree to\ntree, making the groves musical with their harmonious notes. The\nblack-tailed deer bounded frequently across our path, and the lurking\nand stealthy coyotes were continually in view. We halted at a small\ncabin, with a corral near it, in order to breathe our horses, and\nrefresh ourselves. Captain Fisher had kindly filled a small sack with\nbread, cheese, roasted beef, and a small jug of excellent schiedam.\nEntering the cabin, the interior of which was cleanly, we found a\nsolitary woman, young, neatly dressed, and displaying many personal\ncharms. With the characteristic ease and grace of a Spanish woman, she\ngave the usual salutation for the hour of the day, ’Buenas tardes,\nsenores caballeros;” to which we responded by a suitable salutation.\nWe requested of our hostess some water, which she furnished us\nimmediately, in an earthen bowl. Opening our sack of provisions, we\nspread them upon the table, and invited the senora to partake of them\nwith us, which invitation she accepted without the slightest\nhesitation, and with much good-nature, vivacity, and even thankfulness\nfor our politeness. There are no women in the world for whose manners\nnature has done so much, and for whom art and education, in this\nrespect, have done so little, as these Hispano-American females on the\ncoast of the Pacific. In their deportment towards strangers they are\nqueens, when, in costume, they are peasants. None of them, according to\nour tastes, can be called beautiful; but what they want in complexion\nand regularity of feature is fully supplied by their kindliness, the\nsoul and sympathy which beam from their dark eyes, and their grace and\nwarmth of manners and expression.",
        "While enjoying the pic-nic with our agreeable hostess, a caballadawas driven into the corral by two vaqueros, and two gentlemen soon\nafter came into the house. They were Messrs. Lightson and Murphy, from\nthe Pueblo, bound for San Francisco, and had stopped to change their\nhorses. We immediately made ready to accompany them, and were soon on\nthe road again, travelling at racehorse speed; these gentlemen having\nfurnished us with a change of horses, in order that we might be able to\nkeep up with them.",
        "To account for the fast travelling in California on horseback, it is\nnecessary to explain the mode by which it is accomplished. A gentleman\nwho starts upon a journey of one hundred miles, and wishes to perform\nthe trip in a day, will take with him ten fresh horses and a vaquero.\nThe eight loose horses are placed under the charge of the vaquero,\nand are driven in front, at the rate of ten or twelve miles an hour,\naccording to the speed that is required for the journey. At the end of\ntwenty miles, the horses which have been rode are discharged and turned\ninto the caballada, and horses which have not been rode, but driven\nalong without weight, are saddled and mounted and rode at the same\nspeed, and so on to the end of the journey. If a horse gives out from\ninability to proceed at this gait, he is left on the road. The owner’s\nbrand is on him, and, if of any value, he can be recovered without\ndifficulty. But in California no one thinks of stopping on the road, on\naccount of the loss of a horse, or his inability to travel at the rate\nof ten or twelve miles an hour. Horseflesh is cheap, and the animal\nmust go as long as he can, and when he cannot travel longer he is left,\nand another horse is substituted.",
        "Twenty-five miles, at a rapid gait over a level and fertile plain,\nbrought us to the rancho of Don Francisco Sanchez, where we halted to\nchange horses. Breathing our animals a short time, we resumed our\njourney, and reached the mission of San Francisco Dolores, three miles\nfrom the town of San Francisco, just after sunset. Between the mission\nand the town the road is very sandy, and we determined to remain here\nfor the night, corraling the loose animals, and picketing those we\nrode. It was some time, however, before we could find a house to lodge\nin. The foreign occupants of the mission buildings, to whom we applied\nfor accommodations for the night, gave us no satisfaction. After\nseveral applications, we were at last accommodated by an old and very\npoor Californian Spaniard, who inhabited a small house in one of the\nruinous squares, formerly occupied by the operative Indians. All that he\nhad (and it was but little) was at our disposal. A more miserable\nsupper I never sat down to; but the spirit of genuine hospitality in\nwhich it was given imparted to the poor viands a flavour that rendered\nthe entertainment almost sumptuous–in my imagination. A cup of water\ncheerfully given to the weary and thirsty traveller, by him who has no\nmore to part with, is worth a cask of wine grudgingly bestowed by the\nstingy or the ostentatious churl. Notwithstanding we preferred sleeping\non our own blankets, these poor people would not suffer us to do it,\nbut spread their own pallets on the earth floor of their miserable hut,\nand insisted so strongly upon our occupying them, that we could not\nrefuse.",
        "September 21.–We rose at daylight. The morning was clear, and our\nhorses were shivering with the cold. The mission of San Francisco is\nsituated at the northern terminus of the fertile plain over which we\ntravelled yesterday, and at the foot, on the eastern side, of the coast\nrange of mountains. These mountains are of considerable elevation. The\nshore of the Bay of San Francisco is about two miles distant from the\nmission. An arroyo waters the mission lands, and empties into the\nbay. The church of the mission, and the main buildings contiguous, are\nin tolerable repair. In the latter, several Mormon families, which\narrived in the ship Brooklyn from New York, are quartered. As in the\nother missions I have passed through, the Indian quarters are crumbling\ninto shapeless heaps of mud.",
        "Our aged host, notwithstanding he is a pious Catholic, and considers us\nas heretics and heathens, gave us his benediction in a very impressive\nmanner when we were about to start. Mounting our horses at sunrise, we\ntravelled three miles over low ridges of sand-hills, with sufficient\nsoil, however, to produce a thick growth of scrubby evergreen oak, and\nbrambles of hawthorn, wild currant and gooseberry bushes, rose bushes,\nbriers, etc. We reached the residence of Wm. A. Leidesdorff, Esq., late\nAmerican vice-consul at San Francisco, when the sun was about an hour\nhigh. The morning was calm and beautiful. Not a ripple disturbed the\nplacid and glassy surface of the magnificent bay and harbour, upon\nwhich rested at anchor thirty large vessels, consisting of whalemen,\nmerchantmen, and the U.S. sloop-of-war Portsmouth, Captain Montgomery.\nBesides these, there were numerous small craft, giving to the harbour a\ncommercial air, of which some of the large cities on the Atlantic coast\nwould feel vain. The bay, from the town of San Francisco due east, is\nabout twelve miles in breadth. An elevated range of hills bounds the\nview on the opposite side. These slope gradually down, and between them\nand the shore there is a broad and fertile plain, which is called the\nContra Costa. There are several small islands in the bay, but they do\nnot present a fertile appearance to the eye.",
        "We were received with every mark of respectful attention and cordial\nhospitality by Mr. Leidesdorff. Mr. L. is a native of Denmark; was for\nsome years a resident of the United States; but subsequently the\ncaptain of a merchant vessel, and has been established at this place as\na merchant some five or six years. The house in which he resides, now\nunder the process of completion, is the largest private building in the\ntown. Being shown to a well-furnished room, we changed our\ntravel-soiled clothing for a more civilized costume, by which time\nbreakfast was announced, and we were ushered into a large dining-hall.\nIn the centre stood a table, upon which was spread a substantial\nbreakfast of stewed and fried beef, fried onions, and potatoes, bread,\nbutter, and coffee. Our appetites were very sharp, and we did full\njustice to the merits of the fare before us. The servants waiting upon\nthe table were an Indian muchachito and muchachita, about ten or\ntwelve years of age. They had not been long from their wild\nrancherias, and knew but little of civilized life. Our host, however,\nwho speaks, I believe, nearly every living language, whether of\nChristian, barbarian, or savage nations, seemed determined to impress\nupon their dull intellects the forms and customs of civilization. He\nscolded them with great vivacity, sometimes in their own tongue,\nsometimes in French, Spanish, Portuguese, Danish, German, and English,\nin accordance with the language in which he was thinking at the moment.\nIt seemed to me that the little fat Indians were more confused than\nenlightened by his emphatic instructions. At the table, besides\nourselves and host, was Lieutenant W.A. Bartlett, of the U.S.\nsloop-of-war Portsmouth, now acting as Alcalde of the town and district\nof San Francisco.",
        "The Portsmouth, Commander Montgomery, is the only United States vessel\nof war now lying in the harbour. She is regarded as the finest vessel\nof her class belonging to our navy. By invitation of Lieutenant\nBartlett, I went on board of her between ten and eleven o’clock. The\ncrew and officers were assembled on deck to attend Divine service. They\nwere all dressed with great neatness, and seemed to listen with deep\nattention to the Episcopal service and a sermon, which were read by\nCommander Montgomery, who is a member of the church.",
        "In the afternoon I walked to the summit of one of the elevated hills in\nthe vicinity of the town, from which I had a view of the entrance to\nthe bay of San Francisco and of the Pacific Ocean. A thick fog hung\nover the ocean outside of the bay. The deep roar of the eternally\nrestless waves, as they broke one after another upon the beach, or\ndashed against the rock-bound shore, could be heard with great\ndistinctness, although some five or six miles distant. The entrance\nfrom the ocean into the bay is about a mile and half in breadth. The\nwaters of the bay appear to have forced a passage through the elevated\nridge of hills next to the shore of the Pacific. These rise abruptly on\neither side of the entrance. The water at the entrance and inside is of\nsufficient depth to admit the largest ship that was ever constructed;\nand so completely land-locked and protected from the winds is the\nharbour, that vessels can ride at anchor in perfect safety in all kinds\nof weather. The capacity of the harbour is sufficient for the\naccommodation of all the navies of the world.",
        "The town of San Francisco is situated on the south side of the\nentrance, fronting on the bay, and about six miles from the ocean. The\nflow and ebb of the tide are sufficient to bring a vessel to the\nanchorage in front of the town and carry it outside, without the aid of\nwind, or even against an unfavourable wind. A more approachable\nharbour, or one of greater security, is unknown to navigators. The\npermanent population of the town is at this time between one and two\nhundred,[1] and is composed almost exclusively of foreigners. There are\nbut two or three native Californian families in the place. The\ntransient population, and at present it is quite numerous, consists of\nthe garrison of marines stationed here, and the officers and crews\nattached to the merchant and whale ships lying in the harbour. The\nhouses, with a few exceptions, are small adobes and frames, constructed\nwithout regard to architectural taste, convenience, or comfort. Very\nfew of them have either chimneys or fire-places. The inhabitants\ncontrive to live the year round without fires, except for cooking. The\nposition of San Francisco for commerce is, without doubt, superior to\nany other port on the Pacific coast of North America. The country\ncontiguous and contributory to it cannot be surpassed in fertility,\nhealthfulness of climate, and beauty of scenery. It is capable of\nproducing whatever is necessary to the sustenance of man, and many of\nthe luxuries of tropical climates, not taking into the account the\nmineral wealth of the surrounding hills and mountains, which there is\nreason to believe is very great. This place is, doubtless, destined to\nbecome one of the largest and most opulent commercial cities in the\nworld, and under American authority it will rise with astonishing\nrapidity. The principal merchants now established here are Messrs.\nLeidesdorff, Grimes and Davis, and Frank Ward, a young gentleman\nrecently from New York. These houses carry on an extensive and\nprofitable commerce with the interior, the Sandwich Islands, Oregon,\nand the southern coast of the Pacific. The produce of Oregon for\nexportation is flour, lumber, salmon, and cheese; of the Sandwich\nIslands, sugar, coffee, and preserved tropical fruits.",
        "California, until recently, has had no commerce, in the broad\nsignification of the term. A few commercial houses of Boston and New\nYork have monopolized all the trade on this coast for a number of\nyears. These houses have sent out ships freighted with cargoes of dry\ngoods and a variety of knick-knacks saleable in the country. The\nships are fitted up for the retail sale of these articles, and trade\nfrom port to port, vending their wares on board to the rancheros at\nprices that would be astonishing at home. For instance, the price of\ncommon brown cotton cloth is one dollar per yard, and other articles in\nthis and even greater proportion of advance upon home prices. They\nreceive in payment for their wares, hides and tallow. The price of a\ndry hide is ordinarily one dollar and fifty cents. The price of tallow\nI do not know. When the ship has disposed of her cargo, she is loaded\nwith hides, and returns to Boston, where the hides bring about four or\nfive dollars, according to the fluctuations of the market. Immense\nfortunes have been made by this trade; and between the government of\nMexico and the traders on the coast California has been literally\nskinned, annually, for the last thirty years. Of natural wealth the\npopulation of California possess a superabundance, and are immensely\nrich; still, such have been the extortionate prices that they have been\ncompelled to pay for their commonest artificial luxuries and\nwearing-apparel, that generally they are but indifferently provided\nwith the ordinary necessaries of civilized life. For a suit of clothes,\nwhich in New York or Boston would cost seventy-five dollars, the\nCalifornian has been compelled to pay five times that sum in hides at\none dollar and fifty cents; so that a caballero, to clothe himself\ngenteelly, has been obliged, as often as he renewed his dress, to\nsacrifice about two hundred of the cattle on his rancho. No people,\nwhether males or females, are more fond of display; no people have paid\nmore dearly to gratify this vanity; and yet no civilized people I have\nseen are so deficient in what they most covet.",
        "  [1] This was in September, 1846. In June, 1847, when I left San\n      Francisco, on my return to the United States, the population had\n      increased to about twelve hundred, and houses were rising in all\n      directions.",

        "From the 21st of September to the 13th of October I remained at San\nFrancisco. The weather during this period was uniformly clear. The\nclimate of San Francisco is peculiar and local, from its position.\nDuring the summer and autumnal months, the wind on this coast blows\nfrom the west and northwest, directly from the ocean. The mornings here\nare usually calm and pleasantly warm. About twelve o’clock M., the wind\nblows strong from the ocean, through the entrance of the bay, rendering\nthe temperature cool enough for woollen clothing in midsummer. About\nsunset the wind dies away, and the evenings and nights are comparatively\ncalm. In the winter months the wind blows in soft and gentle breezes\nfrom the south-east, and the temperature is agreeable, the thermometer\nrarely sinking below 50 deg. When the winds blow from the ocean, it\nnever rains; when they blow from the land, as they do during the winter\nand spring months, the weather is showery, and resembles that of the\nmonth of May in the same latitude on the Atlantic coast. The coolness\nof the climate and briskness of the air above described are confined to\nparticular positions on the coast, and the description in this respect\nis not applicable to the interior of the country, nor even to other\nlocalities immediately on the coast.",
        "On the 21st, by invitation of Captain Montgomery, I dined on board of\nthe sloop-of-war Portsmouth. The party, including myself, consisted of\nColonel Russell, Mr. Jacob, Lieutenant Bartlett, and a son of Captain\nM. There are few if any officers in our navy more highly and\nuniversally esteemed, for their moral qualities and professional\nmerits, than Captain M. He is a sincere Christian, a brave officer, and\nan accomplished gentleman. Under the orders of Commodore Sloat, he\nfirst raised the American flag in San Francisco. We spent the afternoon\nmost agreeably, and the refined hospitality, courteous manners, and\nintelligent and interesting conversation of our host made us regret the\nrapidly fleeting moments. The wines on the table were the produce of\nthe vine of California, and, having attained age, were of an excellent\nquality in substance and flavour.",
        "I attended a supper-party given this evening by Mr. Frank Ward. The\nparty was composed of citizens of the town, and officers of the navy\nand the merchant and whale ships in the harbour. In such a company as\nwas here assembled, it was very difficult for me to realize that I was\nmany thousand miles from, home, in a strange and foreign country. All\nthe faces about me were American, and there was nothing in scene or\nsentiment to remind the guests of their remoteness from their native\nshores. Indeed, it seems to be a settled opinion, that California is\nhenceforth to compose a part of the United States, and every American\nwho is now here considers himself as treading upon his own soil, as\nmuch as if he were in one of the old thirteen revolutionary states.\nSong, sentiment, story, and wit heightened the enjoyments of the\nexcellent entertainment of our host, and the jovial party did not\nseparate until a late hour of the night. The guests, as may be\nsupposed, were composed chiefly of gentlemen who had, from their\npursuits, travelled over most of the world–had seen developments of\nhuman character under every variety of circumstance, and observed\nsociety, civilized, barbarous, and savage, in all its phases. Their\nconversation, therefore, when around the convivial board, possessed an\nunhackneyed freshness and raciness highly entertaining and instructive.",
        "On the 27th of September, the U.S. frigate Congress, Captain\nLivingston, bearing the broad pennant of Commodore Stockton, and the\nU.S. frigate Savannah, Captain Mervine, anchored in the harbour, having\nsailed from Monterey a day or two previously. The arrival of these\nlarge men-of-war produced an increase of the bustle in the small town.\nBlue coats and bright buttons (the naval uniform) became the prevailing\ncostume at the billiard-rooms and other public places, and the plain\ndress of a private citizen might be regarded as a badge of distinction.",
        "On the 1st of October a courier arrived from the south with\nintelligence that the Californians at Los Angeles had organized a force\nand rebelled against the authority of the Americans–that they had also\ncaptured an American merchant-vessel lying at San Pedro, the port of\nthe city of Angels, about thirty miles distant, and robbed it of a\nquantity of merchandise and specie. Whether this latter report was or\nwas not true, I do not know–the former was correct. The frigate\nSavannah sailed for Los Angeles immediately.",
        "Among those American naval officers whose agreeable acquaintance I made\nat San Francisco, was Mr. James F. Schenck, first-lieutenant of the\nfrigate Congress, brother of the distinguished member of congress from\nOhio of that name,–a native of Dayton, Ohio,–a gentleman of\nintelligence, keen wit, and a most accomplished officer. The officers\nof our navy are our representatives in foreign countries, and they are\ngenerally such representatives as their constituents have reason to\nfeel proud of. Their chivalry, patriotism, gentlemanlike deportment,\nand professional skill cannot be too much admired and applauded by\ntheir countrymen. I shall ever feel grateful to the naval officers of\nthe Pacific squadron for their numerous civilities during my sojourn on\nthe Pacific coast.",
        "Among the novelties presented while at San Francisco was a trial by\njury–the second tribunal of this kind which had been organized in\nCalifornia. The trial look place before Judge Bartlett, and the\nlitigants were two Mormons. Counsel was employed on both sides. Some of\nthe forms of American judicial proceedings were observed, and many of\nthe legal technicalities and nice flaws, so often urged in common-law\ncourts, were here argued by the learned counsel of the parties, with a\nvehemence of language and gesticulation with which I thought the legal\nlearning and acumen displayed did not correspond. The proceedings were\na mixture, made up of common law, equity, and a sprinkling of military\ndespotism–which last ingredient the court was compelled to employ,\nwhen entangled in the intricate meshes woven by the counsel for the\nlitigants, in order to extricate itself. The jury, after the case was\nreferred to them, were what is called “hung;” they could not agree, and\nthe matters in issue, therefore, remained exactly where they were\nbefore the proceedings were commenced.",
        "I attended one evening a fandango given by Mr. Ridley, an English\ngentleman, whose wife is a Californian lady. Several of the senoras and\nsenoritas from the ranchos of the vicinity were present. The\nCalifornian ladies dance with much ease and grace. The waltz appears to\nbe a favourite with them. Smoking is not prohibited in these\nassemblies, nor is it confined to the gentlemen. The cigarita is\nfreely used by the senoras and senoritas, and they puff it with much\ngusto while threading the mazes of the cotillion or swinging in the\nwaltz.",
        "I had the pleasure of being introduced, at the residence of Mr.\nLeidesdorff, to two young ladies, sisters and belles in Alta\nCalifornia. They are members of an old and numerous family on the\nContra Costa. Their names are singular indeed, for, if I heard them\ncorrectly, one of them was called Donna Maria Jesus, and the other\nDonna Maria Conception. They were interesting and graceful young\nladies, with regular features, symmetrical figures, and their dark eyes\nflashed with all the intelligence and passion characteristic of Spanish\nwomen.",
        "Among the gentlemen with whom I met soon after my arrival at San\nFrancisco, and whoso acquaintance I afterwards cultivated, were Mr. E.\nGrimes and Mr. N. Spear, both natives of Massachusetts, but residents\nof this coast and of the Pacific Islands, for many years. They may be\ncalled the patriarchs of American pioneers on the Pacific. After\nforming an acquaintance with Mr. G., if any one were to say to me that",
        "    “Old Grimes is dead, that good old man,”",
        "I should not hesitate to contradict him with emphasis; for he is still\nliving, and possesses all the charities and virtues which can adorn\nhuman nature, with some of the eccentricities of his name-sake in the\nsong. By leading a life of peril and adventure on the Pacific Ocean for\nfifty years he has accumulated a large fortune, and is a man now\nproverbial for his integrity, candour, and charities. Both of these\ngentlemen have been largely engaged in the local commerce of the\nPacific. Mr. S., some twenty-five or thirty years ago, colonized one of\nthe Cannibal Islands, and remained upon it with the colony for nearly\ntwo years. The attempt to introduce agriculture into the island was a\nfailure, and the enterprise was afterwards abandoned.",
        "On the evening of the third of October, it having been announced that\nCommodore Stockton would land on the fifth, a public meeting of the\ncitizens was called by the alcalde, for the purpose of adopting\nsuitable arrangements for his reception, in his civic capacity as\ngovernor. The meeting was convened in the plaza (Portsmouth Square).\nColonel Russell was appointed chairman, and on motion of E. Bryant a\ncommittee was appointed to make all necessary and suitable arrangements\nfor the reception of his excellency, Governor Stockton. The following\naccount of this pageant I extract from the “California” newspaper of\nOctober 24th, 1846.",
        "“Agreeable to public notice, a large number of the citizens of San\nFrancisco and vicinity assembled in Portsmouth Square for the purpose\nof meeting his excellency Robert F. Stockton, to welcome his arrival,\nand offer him the hospitalities of the city. At ten o’clock, a\nprocession was formed, led by the Chief Marshal of the day, supported\non either hand by two aids, followed by an excellent band of music–a\nmilitary escort, under command of Captain J. Zeilen, U.S.M.C.–Captain\nJohn B. Montgomery and suite–Magistracy of the District, and the\nOrator of the day–Foreign Consuls–Captain John Paty, Senior Captain\nof the Hawanian Navy–Lieutenant-Commanding Ruducoff, Russian Navy, and\nLieutenant-Commanding Bonnett, French Navy. The procession was closed\nby the Committee of Arrangements, captains of ships in port, and a long\nline of citizens.",
        "“General Mariano Guadaloupe Valléjo, with several others who had held\noffice under the late government, took their appropriate place in the\nline.",
        "“The procession moved in fine style down Portsmouth Street to the\nlanding, and formed a line in Water Street. The Governor-General landed\nfrom his barge, and was met on the wharf by Captain John B. Montgomery,\nU.S.N., Judge W.A. Bartlett, and Marshal of the day (Frank Ward), who\nconducted him to the front of the line, and presented him to the\nprocession, through the orator of the day, Colonel Russell, who\naddressed the commodore.”",
        "When the governor and commander-in-chief had closed his reply, the\nprocession moved through the principal streets, and halted in front of\nCaptain Leidesdorff’s residence, where the governor and suite entered,\nand was presented to a number of ladies, who welcomed him to the shores\nof California. After which a large portion of the procession\naccompanied the governor, on horseback, to the mission of San Francisco\nDolores, several miles in the country, and returned to an excellent\ncollation prepared by the committee of arrangements, at the house of\nCaptain Leidesdorff. After the cloth was removed, the usual number of\nregular toasts, prepared by the committee of arrangements, and numerous\nvolunteer sentiments by the members of the company, were drunk with\nmany demonstrations of enthusiasm, and several speeches were made. In\nresponse to a complimentary toast, Commodore Stockton made an eloquent\naddress of an hour’s length. The toasts given in English were\ntranslated into Spanish, and those given in Spanish were translated\ninto English. A ball in honour of the occasion was given by the\ncommittee of arrangements in the evening, which was attended by all the\nladies, native and foreign, in the town and vicinity, the naval\nofficers attached to the three ships of war, and the captains of the\nmerchant vessels lying in the harbour. So seductive were the\nfestivities of the day and the pleasures of the dance, that they were\nnot closed until a late hour of the night, or rather until an early\nhour in the morning.",
        "Among the numerous vessels of many nations at anchor in the harbour is\na Russian brig from Sitca, the central port of the Russian-American Fur\nCompany, on the northwestern coast of this continent. She is commanded\nby Lieutenant Ruducoff of the Russian navy, and is here to be freighted\nwith wheat to supply that settlement with breadstuff. Sitca is situated\nin a high northern latitude, and has a population of some four or five\nthousand inhabitants. A large portion of these, I conjecture, are\nchristianized natives or Indians. Many of the crew of this vessel are\nthe aborigines of the country to which she belongs, and from which she\nlast sailed. I noticed, however, from an inscription, that the brig was\nbuilt at Newburyport, Massachusetts, showing that the autocrat of all\nthe Russias is tributary, to some extent, to the free Yankees of New\nEngland for his naval equipment. On the 11th of October, by invitation\nof Lieutenant Ruducoff, in company of Mr. Jacob and Captain\nLeidesdorff, I dined on board this vessel. The Russian customs are in\nsome respects peculiar. Soon after we reached the vessel and were shown\ninto the cabin, a lunch was served up. This consisted of a variety of\ndried and smoked fish, pickled fish-roe, and other hyperborean pickles,\nthe nature of which, whether animal or vegetable, I could not\ndetermine. Various wines and liquors accompanied this lunch, the\ndiscussion of which lasted until an Indian servant, a native of the\nnorth-pole, or thereabouts, announced dinner. We were then shown into a\nhandsomely furnished dining-cabin, where the table was spread. The\ndinner consisted of several courses, some of which were peculiarly\nRussian or Sitcan, and I regret that my culinary knowledge is not equal\nto the task of describing them, for the benefit of epicures of a more\nsouthern region than the place of their invention. They were certainly\nvery delightful to the palate. The afternoon glided away most\nagreeably.",
        "On the 12th of October, Captain Fremont, with a number of volunteers\ndestined for the south, to co-operate with Commodore Stockton in the\nsuppression of the reported rebellion at Los Angeles, arrived at San\nFrancisco from the Sacramento. I had previously offered my services,\nand Mr. Jacob had done the same, to Commodore Stockton, as volunteers\nin this expedition, if they were necessary or desirable. They were now\nrepeated. Although travellers in the country, we were American\ncitizens, and we felt under obligation to assist in defending the flag\nof our country wherever it had been planted by proper authority. At\nthis time we were given to understand that a larger force than was\nalready organised was not considered necessary for the expedition.",

        "October 13.–This morning the United States frigate Congress,\nCommodore Stockton, and the merchant-ship Sterling, employed to\ntransport the volunteers under the command of Captain Fremont (one\nhundred and eighty in number), sailed for the south. The destination of\nthese vessels was understood to be San Pedro or San Diego. While those\nvessels were leaving the harbour, accompanied by Mr. Jacob, I took\npassage for Sonoma in a cutter belonging to the sloop-of-war\nPortsmouth. Sonoma is situated on the northern side of the Bay of San\nFrancisco, about 15 miles from the shore, and about 45 miles from the\ntown of San Francisco. Sonoma creek is navigable for vessels of\nconsiderable burden to within four miles of the town.",
        "Among the passengers in the boat were Mr. Ide, who acted so conspicuous\na part in what is called the “Bear Revolution,” and Messrs. Nash and\nGrigsby, who were likewise prominent in this movement. The boat was\nmanned by six sailors and a cockswain. We passed Yerba Buena, Bird, and\nseveral other small islands in the bay. Some of these are white, as if\ncovered with snow, from the deposit upon them of bird-manure. Tens of\nthousands of wild geese, ducks, gulls, and other water-fowls, were\nperched upon them, or sporting in the waters of the bay, making a\nprodigious cackling and clatter with their voices and wings. By the aid\nof oars and sails we reached the mouth of Sonoma creek about 9 o’clock\nat night, where we landed and encamped on the low marsh which borders\nthe bay on this side. The marshes contiguous to the Bay of San\nFrancisco are extensive, and with little trouble I believe they could\nbe reclaimed and transformed into valuable and productive rice\nplantations. Having made our supper on raw salt pork and bread\ngenerously furnished by the sailors, as soon as we landed, we spread\nour blankets on the damp and rank vegetation and slept soundly until\nmorning.",
        "October 14.–Wind and tide being favourable, at daylight we proceeded\nup the serpentine creek, which winds through a flat and fertile plain,\nsometimes marshy, at others more elevated and dry, to the\nembarcadero, ten or twelve miles from the bay. We landed here between\nnine and ten o’clock, A.M. All the passengers, except ourselves,\nproceeded immediately to the town. By them we sent for a cart to\ntransport our saddles, bridles, blankets, and other baggage, which we\nhad brought with us. While some of the sailors were preparing\nbreakfast, others, with their muskets, shot wild geese, with which the\nplain was covered. An excellent breakfast was prepared in a short time\nby our sailor companions, of which we partook with them. No benevolent\nold gentleman provides more bountifully for his servants than “Uncle\nSam.” These sailors, from the regular rations served out to them from\ntheir ship, gave an excellent breakfast, of bread, butter, coffee, tea,\nfresh beefsteaks, fried salt pork, cheese, pickles, and a variety of\nother delicacies, to which we had been unaccustomed for several months,\nand which cannot be obtained at present in this country. They all said\nthat their rations were more than ample in quantity, and excellent in\nquality, and that no government was so generous in supplying its\nsailors as the government of the United States. They appeared to be\nhappy, and contented with their condition and service, and animated\nwith a patriotic pride for the honour of their country, and the flag\nunder which they sailed. The open frankness and honest patriotism of\nthese single-hearted and weather-beaten tars gave a spice and flavour\nto our entertainment which I shall not soon forget.",
        "From the embarcadero we walked, under the influence of the rays of an\nalmost broiling sun, four miles to the town of Sonoma. The plain, which\nlies between the landing and Sonoma, is timbered sparsely with\nevergreen oaks. The luxuriant grass is now brown and crisp. The hills\nsurrounding this beautiful valley or plain are gentle, sloping, highly\npicturesque, and covered to their tops with wild oats. Reaching Sonoma,\nwe procured lodgings in a large and half-finished adobe house, erected\nby Don Salvador Valléjo, but now occupied by Mr. Griffith, an American\nemigrant, originally from North Carolina. Sonoma is one of the old\nmission establishments of California; but there is now scarcely a\nmission building standing, most of them having fallen into shapeless\nmasses of mud; and a few years will prostrate the roofless walls which\nare now standing. The principal houses in the place are the residences\nof Gen. Don Mariano Guadaloupe Valléjo; his brother-in-law, Mr. J.P.\nLeese, an American; and his brother, Don Salvador Valléjo. The quartel,\na barn-like adobe house, faces the public square. The town presents a\nmost dull and ruinous appearance; but the country surrounding it is\nexuberantly fertile, and romantically picturesque, and Sonoma, under\nAmerican authority, and with an American population, will very soon\nbecome a secondary commercial point, and a delightful residence. Most\nof the buildings are erected around a plaza, about two hundred yards\nsquare. The only ornaments in this square are numerous skulls and\ndislocated skeletons of slaughtered beeves, with which hideous remains\nthe ground is strewn. Cold and warm springs gush from the hills near\nthe town, and supply, at all seasons, a sufficiency of water to\nirrigate any required extent of ground on the plain below. I noticed\noutside of the square several groves of peach and other fruit trees,\nand vineyards, which were planted here by the padres; but the walls\nand fences that once surrounded them are now fallen, or have been\nconsumed for fuel; and they are exposed to the mercies of the immense\nherds of cattle which roam over and graze upon the plain.",
        "October 15.–I do not like to trouble the reader with a frequent\nreference to the myriads of fleas and other vermin which infest the\nrancherias and old mission establishments in California; but, if any\nsinning soul ever suffered the punishments of purgatory before leaving\nits tenement of clay, those torments were endured by myself last night.\nWhen I rose from my blankets this morning, after a sleepless night, I\ndo not think there was an inch square of my body that did not exhibit\nthe inflammation consequent upon a puncture by a flea, or some other\nequally rabid and poisonous insect. Small-pox, erysipelas, measles, and\nscarlet-fever combined, could not have imparted to my skin a more\ninflamed and sanguineous appearance. The multitudes of these insects,\nhowever, have been generated by Indian filthiness. They do not disturb\nthe inmates of those casas where cleanliness prevails.",
        "Having letters of introduction to General Valléjo and Mr. Leese, I\ndelivered them this morning. General Valléjo is a native Californian,\nand a gentleman of intelligence and taste far superior to most of his\ncountrymen. The interior of his house presented a different appearance\nfrom any house occupied by native Californians which I have entered\nsince I have been in the country. Every apartment, even the main\nentrance-hall and corridors, were scrupulously clean, and presented an\nair of comfort which I have not elsewhere seen in California. The\nparlour was furnished with handsome chairs, sofas, mirrors, and tables,\nof mahogany framework, and a fine piano, the first I have seen in the\ncountry. Several paintings and some superior engravings ornamented the\nwalls. Senora Valléjo is a lady of charming personal appearance, and\npossesses in the highest degree that natural grace, ease, and warmth of\nmanner which render Spanish ladies so attractive and fascinating to the\nstranger. The children, some five or six in number, were all beautiful\nand interesting. General V. is, I believe, strongly desirous that the\nUnited States shall retain and annex California. He is thoroughly\ndisgusted with Mexican sway, which is fast sending his country\nbackwards, instead of forwards, in the scale of civilization, and for\nyears he has been desirous of the change which has now taken place.",
        "In the afternoon we visited the house of Mr. Leese, which is also\nfurnished in American style. Mr. L. is the proprietor of a vineyard in\nthe vicinity of the town, and we were regaled upon grapes as luscious,\nI dare say, as the forbidden fruit that provoked the first\ntransgression. Nothing of the fruit kind can exceed the delicious\nrichness and flavour, of the California grape.",
        "This evening Thomas O. Larkin, Esq., late United States Consul for\nCalifornia, arrived here, having left San Francisco on the same morning\nthat we did, travelling by land. Mr. L. resides in Monterey, but I had\nthe pleasure of an introduction to him at San Francisco several days\npreviously to my leaving that place. Mr. L. is a native of Boston, and\nhas been a resident in California for about fifteen years, during which\ntime he has amassed a large fortune, and from the changes now taking\nplace he is rapidly increasing it. He will probably be the first\nAmerican millionnaire of California.",
        "October 17.–The last two mornings have been cloudy and cool. The\nrainy season, it is thought by the weather-wise in this climate, will\nset in earlier this year than usual. The periodical rains ordinarily\ncommence about the middle of November. It is now a month earlier, and\nthe meteorological phenomena portend “falling weather.” The rains\nduring the winter, in California, are not continuous, as is generally\nsupposed. It sometimes rains during an entire day, without cessation,\nbut most generally the weather is showery, with intervals of bright\nsunshine and a delightful temperature. The first rains of the year fall\nusually in November, and the last about the middle of May. As soon as\nthe ground becomes moistened, the grass, and other hardy vegetation,\nsprings up, and by the middle of December the landscape is arrayed in a\nrobe of fresh verdure. The grasses grow through the entire winter, and\nmost of them mature by the first of May. The season for sowing wheat\ncommences as soon as the ground is sufficiently softened by moisture to\nadmit of ploughing, and continues until March or April.",
        "We had made preparations this morning to visit a rancho, belonging to\nGeneral Valléjo, in company with the general and Mr. Larkin. This\nrancho contains about eleven leagues of land, bordering upon a portion\nof the Bay of San Francisco, twenty-five or thirty miles distant from\nSonoma. Just as we were about mounting our horses, however, a courier\narrived from San Francisco with despatches from Captain Montgomery,\naddressed to Lieutenant Revere, the military commandant at this post,\ngiving such intelligence in regard to the insurrection at the south,\nthat we determined to return to San Francisco forthwith. Procuring\nhorses, and accompanied by Mr. Larkin, we left Sonoma about two o’clock\nin the afternoon, riding at the usual California speed. After leaving\nSonoma plain we crossed a ridge of hills, and entered the fertile and\npicturesque valley of Petaluma creek, which empties into the bay.\nGeneral Valléjo has an extensive rancho in this valley, upon which he\nhas recently erected, at great expense, a very large house.\nArchitecture, however, in this country is in its infancy. The money\nexpended in erecting this house, which presents to the eye no tasteful\narchitectural attractions, would, in the United States, have raised a\npalace of symmetrical proportions, and adorned it with every requisite\nornament. Large herds of cattle were grazing in this valley.",
        "From Petaluma valley we crossed a high rolling country, and reached the\nmission of San Rafael (forty-five miles) between seven and eight\no’clock in the evening. San Rafael is situated two or three miles from\nthe shore of the bay, and commands an extensive view of the bay and its\nislands. The mission buildings are generally in the same ruinous\ncondition I have before described. We put up at the house of a Mr.\nMurphy, a scholastic Irish bachelor, who has been a resident of\nCalifornia for a number of years. His casa, when we arrived, was\nclosed, and it was with some difficulty that we could gain admission.\nWhen, however, the occupant of the house had ascertained, from one of\nthe loopholes of the building, who we were, the doors were soon\nunbarred and we were admitted, but not without many sallies of Irish\nwit, sometimes good-natured, and sometimes keenly caustic and ironical.\nWe found a table spread with cold mutton and cold beef upon it. A cup\nof coffee was soon prepared by the Indian muchachos and muchachas, and\nour host brought out some scheidam and aguardiénte. A draught or two\nof these liquids seemed to correct the acidity of his humour, and he\nentertained us with his jokes and conversation several hours.",
        "October 18.–From San Rafael to Sausolito, opposite San Francisco on\nthe north side of the entrance to the bay, it is five leagues (fifteen\nmiles), generally over elevated hills and through deep hollows, the\nascents and descents being frequently steep and laborious to our\nanimals. Starting at half-past seven o’clock, we reached the residence\nof Captain Richardson, the proprietor of Sausolito, about nine o’clock\nin the morning. In travelling this distance we passed some temporary\nhouses, erected by American emigrants on the mission lands, and the\nrancho of Mrs. Reed, a widow. We immediately hired a whale-boat from\none of the ships, lying here, at two dollars for each passenger, and\nbetween ten and eleven o’clock we landed in San Francisco.",
        "I met, soon after my arrival, Mr. Lippincott, heretofore mentioned, who\naccompanied us a portion of the distance over the mountains; and Mr.\nHastings, who, with Mr. Hudspeth, conducted a party of the emigrants\nfrom fort Bridger by the new route, via the south end of the Salt\nLake, to Mary’s River. From Mr. Lippincott I learned the particulars of\nan engagement between a party of the emigrants (Captain West’s company)\nand the Indians on Mary’s River, which resulted, as has before been\nstated, in the death of Mr. Sallee and a dangerous arrow wound to Mr.\nL. He had now, however, recovered from the effects of the wound. The\nemigrants, who accompanied Messrs. Hastings and Hudspeth, or followed\ntheir trail, had all reached the valley of the Sacramento without any\nmaterial loss or disaster.",
        "I remained at San Francisco from the 18th to the 22d of October. The\nweather during this time was sufficiently cool to render fires\nnecessary to comfort in the houses; but fireplaces or stoves are\nluxuries which but few of the San Franciscans have any knowledge of,\nexcept in their kitchens. This deficiency, however, will soon be\nremedied. American settlers here will not build houses without\nchimneys. They would as soon plan a house without a door, or with the\nentrance upon its roof, in imitation of the architecture of the Pueblo\nIndians of New Mexico.",

        "October 22.–Having determined to make a trip to Nueva Helvetia by\nwater, for the purpose of examining more particularly the upper portion\nof the bay and the Sacramento river, in conjunction with Mr. Larkin, we\nchartered a small open sail-boat for the excursion. The charter, to\navoid disputes, was regularly drawn and signed, with all conditions\nspecified. The price to be paid for a certain number of passengers was\nthirty-two dollars, and demurrage at the rate of twenty-five cents per\nhour for all delays ordered by the charter-party, on the trip upwards\nto Nueva Helvetia. The boat was to be ready at the most convenient\nlanding at seven o’clock this morning, but when I called at the place\nappointed, with our baggage, the boat was not there. In an hour or two\nthe skipper was found, but refused to comply with his contract. We\nimmediately laid our grievance before the alcalde, who, after reading\nthe papers and hearing the statements on both sides, ordered the\nskipper to perform what he had agreed to perform, to which decision he\nreluctantly assented. In order to facilitate matters, I paid the costs\nof the action myself, although the successful litigant in the suit.",
        "We left San Francisco about two o’clock P.M., and, crossing the mouth\nof the bay, boarded a Mexican schooner, a prize captured by the U.S.\nsloop-of-war Cyane, Captain Dupont, which had entered the bay this\nmorning and anchored in front of Sausolito. The prize is commanded by\nLieutenant Renshaw, a gallant officer of our navy. Our object in\nboarding the schooner was to learn the latest news, but she did not\nbring much. We met on board the schooner Lieutenant Hunter of the\nPortsmouth, a chivalrous officer, and Lieutenant Ruducoff, commanding\nthe Russian brig previously mentioned, whose vessel, preparatory to\nsailing, was taking in water at Sausolito. Accepting of his pressing\ninvitation, we visited the brig, and took a parting glass of wine with\nher gallant and gentlemanly commander.",
        "About five o’clock P.M., we proceeded on our voyage. At eight o’clock a\ndense fog hung over the bay, and, the ebb-tide being adverse to our\nprogress, we were compelled to find a landing for our small and frail\ncraft. This was not an easy matter, in the almost impenetrable\ndarkness. As good-luck would have it, however, after we had groped\nabout for some time, a light was discovered by our skipper. He rowed\nthe boat towards it, but grounded. Hauling off, he made another attempt\nwith better success, reaching within hailing distance of the shore. The\nlight proceeded from a camp-fire of three Kanacka (Sandwich island)\nrunaway sailors. As soon as they ascertained who we were and what we\nwanted, they stripped themselves naked, and, wading through the mud and\nwater to the boat, took us on their shoulders, and carried us high and\ndry to the land. The boat, being thus lightened of her burden, was\nrowed farther up, and landed.",
        "The natives of the Sandwich islands (Kanackas, as they are called) are,\nwithout doubt, the most expert watermen in the world. Their\nperformances in swimming and diving are so extraordinary, that they may\nalmost be considered amphibious in their natures and instincts. Water\nappears to be as much their natural element as the land. They have\nstraight black hair, good features, and an amiable and intelligent\nexpression of countenance. Their complexion resembles that of a bright\nmulatto; and, in symmetrical proportions and muscular developments,\nthey will advantageously compare with any race of men I have seen. The\ncrews of many of the whale and merchant ships on this coast are partly\ncomposed of Kanackas, and they are justly esteemed as most valuable\nsailors.",
        "October 23.–The damp raw weather, auguring the near approach of the\nautumnal rains, continues. A drizzling mist fell on us during the\nnight, and the clouds were not dissipated when we resumed our voyage\nthis morning. Passing through the straits of San Pablo and San Pedro,\nwe entered a division of the bay called the bay of San Pablo. Wind and\ntide being in our favour, we crossed this sheet of water, and\nafterwards entered and passed through the Straits of Carquinez. At\nthese straits the waters of the bay are compressed within the breadth\nof a mile, for the distance of about two leagues. On the southern side\nthe shore is hilly, and canoned in some places. The northern shore is\ngentle, the hills and table-land sloping gradually down to the water.\nWe landed at the bend of the Straits of Carquinez, and spent several\nhours in examining the country and soundings on the northern side.\nThere is no timber here. The soil is covered with a growth of grass and\nwhite oats. The bend of the Straits of Carquinez, on the northern side,\nhas been thought to be a favourable position for a commercial town. It\nhas some advantages and some disadvantages, which it would be tedious\nfor me now to detail.",
        "[Subsequently to this my first visit here, a town of extensive\ndimensions has been laid off by Gen. Valléjo and Mr. Semple, the\nproprietors, under the name of “Francisca.” It fronts for two or three\nmiles on the ’Soeson,” the upper division of the Bay of San\nFrancisco, and the Straits of Carquinez. A ferry has also been\nestablished, which crosses regularly from shore to shore, conveying\ntravellers over the bay. I crossed, myself and horses, here in June,\n1847, when on my return to the United States. Lots had then been\noffered to settlers on favourable conditions, and preparations, I\nunderstand, were making for the erection of a number of houses.]",
        "About sunset we resumed our voyage. The Wind having lulled, we\nattempted to stem the adverse tide by the use of oars, but the ebb of\nthe tide was stronger than the propelling force of our oars. Soon, in\nspite of all our exertions, we found ourselves drifting rapidly\nbackwards, and, after two or three hours of hard labour in the dark, we\nwere at last so fortunate as to effect a landing in a cove on the\nsouthern side of the straits, having retrograded several miles. In the\ncove there is a small sandy beach, upon which the waves have drifted,\nand deposited a large quantity of oat-straw, and feathers shed by the\nmillions of water-fowls which sport upon the bay. On this downy deposit\nfurnished by nature we spread our blankets, and slept soundly.",
        "October 24.–We proceeded on our voyage at daylight, coasting along\nthe southern shore of the Soeson. About nine o’clock we landed on a\nmarshy plain, and cooked breakfast. A range of mountains bounds this\nplain, the base of which is several miles from the shore of the bay.\nThese mountains, although of considerable elevation, exhibit signs of\nfertility to their summits. On the plain, numerous herds of wild cattle\nwere grazing. About two o’clock, P.M., we entered the mouth of the\nSacramento. The Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers empty into the Bay of\nSan Francisco at the same point, about sixty miles from the Pacific,\nand by numerous mouths or sloughs as they are here called. These\nsloughs wind through an immense timbered swamp, and constitute a\nterraqueous labyrinth of such intricacy, that unskilful and\ninexperienced navigators have been lost for many days in it, and some,\nI have been told, have perished, never finding their way out. A range\nof low sloping hills approach the Sacramento a short distance above its\nmouth, on the left-hand side as you ascend, and run parallel with the\nstream several miles. The banks of the river, and several large islands\nwhich we passed during the day, are timbered with sycamore, oak, and a\nvariety of smaller trees and shrubbery. Numerous grape-vines, climbing\nover the trees, and loaded down with a small and very acid fruit, give\nto the forest a tangled appearance. The islands of the Sacramento are\nall low, and subject to overflow in the spring of the year. The soil of\nthe river bottom, including the islands, is covered with rank\nvegetation, a certain evidence of its fertility. The water, at this\nseason, is perfectly limpid, and, although the tide ebbs and flows more\nthan a hundred miles above the mouth of the river, it is fresh and\nsweet. The channel of the Sacramento is remarkably free from snags and\nother obstructions to navigation. A more beautiful and placid stream of\nwater I never saw.",
        "At twelve o’clock at night, the ebb-tide being so strong that we found\nourselves drifting backwards, with some difficulty we effected a\nlanding on one of the islands, clearing a way through the tangled brush\nand vines with our hatchets and knives. Lighting a fire, we bivouacked\nuntil daylight.",
        "October 25.–Continuing our voyage, we landed, about nine o’clock,\nA.M., at an Indian rancheria, situated on the bank of the river. An\nold Indian, his wife, and two or three children, were all the present\noccupants of this rancheria. The woman was the most miserable and\nemaciated object I ever beheld. She was probably a victim of the\n\"sweat-house.” Surrounding the rancheria were two or three acres of\nground, planted with maize, beans, and melons. Purchasing a quantity of\nwater and musk-melons, we re-embarked and pursued our voyage. As we\nascended the stream, the banks became more elevated, the country on\nboth sides opening into vast savannas, dotted occasionally with parks\nof evergreen oak.",
        "The tide turning against us again about eleven or twelve o’clock, we\nlanded at an encampment of Walla-Walla Indians, a portion of the party\npreviously referred to, and reported to have visited California for\nhostile purposes. Among them was a Delaware Indian, known as “Delaware\nTom,” who speaks English as fluently as any Anglo-Saxon, and is a most\ngallant and honourable Indian. Several of the party, a majority of whom\nwere women and children, were sick with chills and fever. The men were\nengaged in hunting and jerking deer and elk meat. Throwing our hooks,\nbaited with fresh meat, into the river, we soon drew out small fish\nenough for dinner.",
        "The specimens of Walla-Wallas at this encampment are far superior to\nthe Indians of California in features, figure, and intelligence. Their\ncomplexion is much lighter, and their features more regular,\nexpressive, and pleasing. Men and women were clothed in dressed skins.\nThe men were armed with rifles.",
        "At sunset we put our little craft in motion again, and at one o’clock\nat night landed near the cabin of a German emigrant named Schwartz, six\nmiles below the embarcadero of New Helvetia. The cabin is about\ntwenty feet in length by twelve in breadth, constructed of a light rude\nframe, shingled with tule. After gaining admission, we found a fire\nblazing in the centre of the dwelling on the earth-floor, and suspended\nover us were as many salmon, taken from the Sacramento, as could be\nplaced in position to imbibe the preservative qualities of the smoke.",
        "Our host, Mr. Schwartz, is one of those eccentric human phenomena\nrarely met with, who, wandering from their own nation into foreign\ncountries, forget their own language without acquiring any other. He\nspeaks a tongue (language it cannot be called) peculiar to himself, and\nscarcely intelligible. It is a mixture, in about equal parts, of\nGerman, English, French, Spanish, and rancheria Indian, a compounded\npolyglot or lingual pi–each syllable of a word sometimes being\nderived from a different language. Stretching ourselves on the benches\nsurrounding the fire, so as to avoid the drippings from the pendent\nsalmon, we slept until morning.",
        "October 26.–Mr. Schwartz provided us with a breakfast of fried\nsalmon and some fresh milk. Coffee, sugar, and bread we brought with\nus, so that we enjoyed a luxurious repast.",
        "Near the house was a shed containing some forty or fifty barrels of\npickled salmon, but the fish, from their having been badly put up, were\nspoiled. Mr. Schwartz attempted to explain the particular causes of\nthis, but I could not understand him. The salmon are taken with seines\ndragged across the channel of the river by Indians in canoes. On the\nbank of the river the Indians were eating their breakfast, which\nconsisted of a large fresh salmon, roasted in the ashes or embers, and\na kettle of atole, made of acorn-meal. The salmon was four or five\nfeet in length, and, when taken out of the fire and cut open, presented\na most tempting appearance. The Indians were all nearly naked, and most\nof them, having been wading in the water at daylight to set their\nseines, were shivering with the cold whilst greedily devouring their\nmorning meal.",
        "We reached the embarcadero of New Helvetia about eleven o’clock,\nA.M., and, finding there a wagon, we placed our baggage in it, and\nwalked to the fort, about two and a half miles.",

        "I remained at the fort from the 27th to the 30th of October. On the\n28th, Mr. Reed, whom I have before mentioned as belonging to the rear\nemigrating party, arrived here. He left his party on Mary’s River, and\nin company with one man crossed the desert and the mountains. He was\nseveral days without provisions, and, when he arrived at Johnson’s, was\nso much emaciated and exhausted by fatigue and famine, that he could\nscarcely walk. His object was to procure provisions immediately, and to\ntransport them with pack-mules over the mountains for the relief of the\nsuffering emigrants behind. He had lost all of his cattle, and had been\ncompelled to cache two of his wagons and most of his property.\nCaptain Sutter generously furnished the requisite quantity of mules and\nhorses, with Indian vaqueros, and jerked meat and flour. This is the\nsecond expedition for the relief of the emigrants he has fitted out\nsince our arrival in the country. Ex-governor Boggs and family reached\nSutter’s Fort to-day.",
        "On the evening of the 28th, a courier arrived with letters from Colonel\nFremont, now at Monterey. The substance of the intelligence received by\nthe courier was, that a large force of Californians (varying, according\nto different reports, from five to fifteen hundred strong) had met the\nmarines and sailors, four hundred strong, under the command of Captain\nMervine, of the U.S. frigate Savannah, who had landed at San Pedro for\nthe purpose of marching to Los Angeles, and had driven Captain Mervine\nand his force back to the ship, with the loss, in killed, of six men.\nThat the towns of Angeles and Santa Barbara had been taken by the\ninsurgents, and the American garrisons there had either been captured\nor had made their escape by retreating. What had become of them was\nunknown.[2] Colonel Fremont, who I before mentioned had sailed with a\nparty of one hundred and eighty volunteers from San Francisco to San\nPedro, or San Diego, for the purpose of co-operating with Commodore\nStockton, after having been some time at sea, had put into Monterey and\nlanded his men, and his purpose now was to increase his force and mount\nthem, and to proceed by land for Los Angeles.",
        "  [2] The garrison under Captain Gillespie, at Los Angeles, capitulated.\n      The garrison at Santa Barbara, under Lieutenant Talbot, marched\n      out in defiance of the enemy, and after suffering many hardships\n      arrived in safety at Monterey.",
        "On the receipt of this intelligence, I immediately drew up a paper,\nwhich was signed by myself, Messrs Reed, Jacob, Lippincott, and\nGrayson, offering our services as volunteers, and our exertions to\nraise a force of emigrants and Indians which would be a sufficient\nreinforcement to Colonel Fremont. This paper was addressed to Mr. Kern,\nthe commandant of Fort Sacramento, and required his sanction. The next\nmorning (29th) he accepted of our proposal, and the labour of raising\nthe volunteers and of procuring the necessary clothing and supplies for\nthem and the Indians was apportioned.",
        "It commenced raining on the night of the twenty-eighth, and the rain\nfell heavily and steadily until twelve o’clock, P.M., on the\ntwenty-ninth. This is the first fall of rain since March last. About\none o’clock, P.M., the clouds cleared away and the weather and\ntemperature were delightful.",
        "About twelve o’clock, on the 30th, accompanied by Mr. Grayson, I left\nNew Helvetia. We crossed the Sacramento at the embarcadero, swimming\nour horses, and passing ourselves over in a small canoe. The method of\nswimming horses over so broad a stream as the Sacramento is as follows.\nA light canoe or “dug-out” is manned by three persons, one at the bow\none at the stern and one in the centre; those at the bow and stern have\npaddles, and propel and steer the craft. The man in the centre holds\nthe horses one on each side, keeping their heads out of water. When the\nhorses are first forced into the deep water, they struggle\nprodigiously, and sometimes upset the canoe; but, when the canoe gets\nfairly under way, they cease their resistance, but snort loudly at\nevery breath to clear their mouths and nostrils of the water.",
        "Proceeding ten miles over a level plain, we overtook a company of\nemigrants bound for Nappa valley, and encamped with them for the night\non Puta creek, a tributary of the Sacramento. Five of the seven or\neight men belonging to the company enrolled their names as volunteers.\nThe grass on the western side of the Sacramento is very rank and of an\nexcellent quality.",
        "It commenced raining about two o’clock on the morning of the 31st, and\ncontinued to rain and mist all day. We crossed from Puta to Cache\ncreek, reaching the residence of Mr. Gordon (25 miles) about three\no’clock P.M. Here we enrolled several additional emigrants in our list\nof volunteers, and then travelled fifteen miles up the creek to a small\nlog-house, occupied temporarily by some of the younger members of the\nfamily of Mr. Gordon, who emigrated from Jackson county, Mo., this\nyear, and by Mrs. Grayson. Here we remained during the night, glad to\nfind a shelter and a fire, for we were drenched to our skins.",
        "On the morning of the 1st of November the sun shone out warm and\npleasant. The birds were singing, chattering, and flitting from tree to\ntree, through the romantic and picturesque valley where we had slept\nduring the night. The scenery and its adjuncts were so charming and\nenticing that I recommenced my travels with reluctance. No scenery can\nbe more beautiful than that of the small valleys of California.\nAscending the range of elevated mountains which border the Cache creek,\nwe had a most extensive view of the broad plain of the Sacramento,\nstretching with islands and bells of limber far away to the south as\nthe eye could penetrate. The gorges and summits of these mountains are\ntimbered with largo pines, firs, and cedars, with a smaller growth of\nmagnolias, manzanitas, hawthorns, etc., etc. Travelling several miles\nover a level plateau, we descended into a beautiful valley, richly\ncarpeted with grass and timbered with evergreen oak. Proceeding across\nthis three or four miles, we rose another range of mountains, and,\ntravelling a league along the summit ridge, we descended through a\ncrevice in a sleep rocky precipice, just sufficient in breadth to admit\nthe passage of our animals. Our horses were frequently compelled to\nslide or leap down nearly perpendicular rocks or stairs, until we\nfinally, just after sunset, reached the bottom of the mountain, and\nfound ourselves in another level and most fertile and picturesque\nvalley.",
        "We knew that in this valley, of considerable extent, there was a house\nknown as “Barnett’s,” where we expected to find quarters for the night.\nThere were numerous trails of cattle, horses, deer, and other wild\nanimals, crossing each other in every direction through the live\noak-timber. We followed on the largest of the cattle trails until it\nbecame so blind that we could not see it. Taking another, we did the\nsame, and the result was the same; another and another with no better\nsuccess. We then shouted so loud that our voices were echoed and\nre-echoed by the surrounding mountains, hoping, if there were any\ninhabitants in the valley, that they would respond to us. There was no\nresponse–all was silent when the sound of our voices died away in the\ngorges and ravines; and at ten o’clock at night we encamped under the\nwide-spreading branches of an oak, having travelled about 40 miles.\nStriking a fire and heaping upon it a large quantity of wood, which\nblazed brightly, displaying the Gothic shapes of the surrounding oaks,\nwe picketed our animals, spread our blankets, and slept soundly.",
        "It rained several hours during the night, and in the morning a dense\nfog filled the valley. Saddling our animals, we searched along the foot\nof the next range of mountains for a trail, but could find none.\nReturning to our camp, we proceeded up the valley, and struck a trail,\nby following which two miles, we came to the house (Barnett’s). The\ndoor was ajar, and entering the dwelling we found it tenantless. The\nhearth was cold, and the ashes in the jambs of the large fire-place\nwere baked. In the corners of the building there were some frames, upon\nwhich beds had been once spread. The house evidently had been abandoned\nby its former occupants for some time. The prolific mothers of several\nfamilies of the swinish species, with their squealing progenies,\ngathered around us, in full expectation, doubtless, of the dispensation\nof an extra ration, which we had not to give. Having eaten nothing but\na crust of bread for 24 hours, the inclination of our appetites was\nstrong to draw upon them for a ration; but for old acquaintance’ sake,\nand because they were the foreshadowing of the “manifest destiny,” they\nwere permitted to pass without molestation. There were two or three\nsmall inclosures near the house, where corn and wheat had been planted\nand harvested this year; but none of the product of the harvest could\nbe found in the empty house, or on the place. Dismounting from our\nhorses at a limpid spring-branch near the house, we slaked our thirst,\nand made our hydropathical breakfast from its cool and delicious water.",
        "Although the trail of the valley did not run in our course, still,\nunder the expectation that it would soon take another direction, we\nfollowed it, passing over a fertile soil, sufficiently timbered and\nwatered by several small streams. The quantity of arable land in\nCalifornia, I believe, is much greater than has generally been supposed\nfrom the accounts of the country given by travellers who have visited\nonly the parts on the Pacific, and some few of the missions. Most of\nthe mountain valleys between the Sierra Nevada and the coast are\nexuberantly fertile, and finely watered, and will produce crops of all\nkinds, while the hills are covered with oats and grass of the most\nnutritious qualities, for the sustenance of cattle, horses, and hogs.\nThe acorns which fall from the oaks are, of themselves, a rich annual\nproduct for the fattening of hogs; and during the period of transition\n(four or five weeks after the rains commence falling) from the dry\ngrass to the fresh growth, horses, mules, and even horned cattle mostly\nsubsist and fatten upon these large and oleaginous nuts.",
        "We left the valley in a warm and genial sunshine, about 11 o’clock, and\ncommenced ascending another high mountain, timbered as those I have\npreviously described. When we reached the summit, we were enveloped in\nclouds, and the rain was falling copiously, and a wintry blast drove\nthe cold element to our skins. Crossing this mountain three or four\nmiles, we descended its sleep sides, and entered another beautiful and\nromantic hollow, divided as it were into various apartments by short\nranges of low conical hills, covered to their summits with grass and\nwild oats. The grass and other vegetation on the level bottom are very\nrank, indicating a soil of the most prolific qualities. In winding\nthrough this valley, we met four Indians on foot, armed with long bows,\nand arrows of corresponding weight and length, weapons that I have not\npreviously seen among the Indians. Their complexions were lighter than\nthose of the rancheria Indians of California. They evidently belonged\nto some more northern tribe. We stopped them to make inquiries, but\nthey seemed to know nothing of the country, nor could we learn from\nthem from whence they came or where they were going. They were clothed\nin dressed skins, and two of them were highly rouged.",
        "Ascending and descending gradually over some low hills, we entered\nanother circular valley, through which flows a stream, the waters of\nwhich, judging from its channel, at certain seasons are broad and deep.\nThe ground, from the rains that have recently fallen and are now\nfalling, is very soft, and we had difficulty in urging our tired\nanimals across this valley. We soon discovered fresh cattle signs, and\nafterwards a large herd grazing near the stream. Farther on, we saw\nfive old and miserably emaciated Indian women, gathering grass-seed for\nbread. This process is performed with two baskets, one shaped like a\nround shield, and the other having a basin and handle. With the shield\nthe lop of the grass is brushed, and the seed by the motion is thrown\ninto the deep basket held in the other hand. The five women appeared at\na distance like so many mowers cutting down the grass of a meadow.\nThese women could give us no satisfaction in response to inquiries, but\npointed over the river indicating that we should there find the casaand rancheria. They then continued their work with as much zeal and\nindustry as if their lives were dependent upon the proceeds of their\nlabour, and I suppose they were.",
        "Crossing the river, we struck a trail which led us to the casa and\nrancheria, about two miles distant. The casa was a small adobe\nbuilding, about twelve feet square, and was locked up. Finding that\nadmission was not to be gained here, we hailed at the rancheria, and\npresently some dozen squalid and naked men, women, and children, made\ntheir appearance. We inquired for the mayor domo, or overseer. The\nchief speaker signified that he was absent, and that he did not expect\nhint to return until several suns rose and set. We then signified we\nwere hungry, and very soon a loaf made of pulverized acorns, mingled\nwith wild fruit of some kind, was brought to us with a basket of water.\nThese Indians manufacture small baskets which are impervious to water,\nand they are used as basins to drink from, and for other purposes.",
        "I knew that we had been travelling out of our course all day, and it\nwas now three o’clock, P.M. Rain and mist had succeeded each other, and\nthe sun was hidden from us by dark and threatening masses of clouds. We\nhad no compass with us, and could not determine the course to Nappa\nValley or Sonoma. Believing that the Indian would have some knowledge\nof the latter place, we made him comprehend that we wished to go there,\nand inquired the route. He pointed in a direction which he signified\nwould take us to Sonoma. We pointed in another course, which it seemed\nto us was the right one. But he persisted in asserting that he was\nright. After some further talk, for the shirt on my back he promised to\nguide us, and, placing a ragged skin on one of our horses, he mounted\nthe animal and led the way over the next range of hills. The rain soon\npoured down so hard upon the poor fellow’s bare skin, that he begged\npermission to return, to which we would not consent; but, out of\ncompassion to him, I took off my over-coat, with which he covered his\nswarthy hide, and seemed highly delighted with the shelter from the\npitiless storm it afforded him, or with the supposition that I intended\nto present it to him.",
        "Crossing several elevated and rocky hills, just before sunset, we had a\nview of a large timbered valley and a sheet of water, the extent of\nwhich we could not compass with the eye, on account of the thickness of\nthe atmosphere. When we came in sight of the water, the Indian uttered\nvarious exclamations of pleasure; and, although I had felt but little\nfaith in him as a pilot from the first, I began now to think that we\nwere approaching the Bay of San Francisco. Descending into the valley,\nwe travelled along a small stream two or three miles, and were\ncontinuing on in the twilight, when we heard the tinkling of a cow-bell\non the opposite side of the stream. Certain, from this sound, that\nthere must be an encampment near, I halted and hallooed at the top of\nmy voice. The halloo called forth a similar response, with an\ninterrogation in English, “Who the d––l are you–Spaniards or\nAmericans?” “Americans.” “Show yourselves, then, d––n you, and let us\nsee the colour of your hide,” was the answer.",
        "“Tell us where we can cross the stream, and you shall soon see us,” was\nour reply.",
        "“Ride back and follow the sound of my voice, and be d––d to you, and\nyou can cross the stream with a deer’s jump.”",
        "Accordingly, following the sound of the voice of this rough colloquist,\nwho shouted repeatedly, we rode back in the dark several hundred yards,\nand, plunging into the stream, the channel of which was deep, we gained\nthe other side, where we found three men standing ready to receive us.\nWe soon discovered them to be a party of professional hunters, or\ntrappers, at the head of which was Mr. Greenwood, a famed mountaineer,\ncommonly known as “Old Greenwood.” They invited us to their camp,\nsituated across a small opening in the timber about half a mile\ndistant. Having unsaddled our tired animals and turned them loose to\ngraze for the night, we placed our baggage under the cover of a small\ntent, and, taking our seats by the huge camp fire, made known as far as\nwas expedient our business. We soon ascertained that we had ridden the\nentire day (about 40 miles) directly out of our course to Nappa Valley\nand Sonoma, and that the Indian’s information was all wrong. We were\nnow near the shore of a large lake, called the Laguna by\nCalifornians, some fifty or sixty miles in length, which lake is\nsituated about sixty or seventy miles north of the Bay of San\nFrancisco; consequently, to-morrow we shall be compelled to retrace our\nsteps and find the trail that leads from Harriett’s house to Nappa,\nwhich escaped us this morning. We received such directions, however,\nfrom Mr. Greenwood, that we could not fail to find it.",
        "We found in the camp, much to our gratification after a long fast, an\nabundance of fat grisly bear-meat and the most delicious and tender\ndeer-meat. The camp looked like a butcher’s stall. The pot filled with\nbear-flesh was boiled again and again, and the choice pieces of the\ntender venison were roasting, and disappearing with singular rapidity\nfor a long time. Bread there was none of course. Such a delicacy is\nunknown to the mountain trappers, nor is it much desired by them.",
        "The hunting party consisted of Mr. Greenwood, Mr. Turner, Mr. Adams,\nand three sons of Mr. G., one grown, and the other two boys 10 or 12\nyears of age, half-bred Indians, the mother being a Crow. One of these\nboys is named “Governor Boggs,” after ex-governor Boggs of Missouri, an\nold friend of the father. Mr. Greenwood, or “Old Greenwood,” as he is\nfamiliarly called, according to his own statement, is 83 years of age,\nand has been a mountain trapper between 40 and 50 years. He lived among\nthe Crow Indians, where he married his wife, between thirty and forty\nyears. He is about six feet in height, raw-boned and spare in flesh,\nbut muscular, and, notwithstanding his old age, walks with all the\nerectness and elasticity of youth. His dress was of tanned buckskin,\nand from its appearance one would suppose its antiquity to be nearly\nequal to the age of its wearer. It had probably never been off his body\nsince he first put it on. “I am,” said he, “an old man–eighty-three\nyears–it is a long time to live;–eighty-three years last–. I have\nseen all the Injun varmints of the Rocky Mountains,–have fout\nthem–lived with them. I have many children–I don’t know how many,\nthey are scattered; but my wife was a Crow. The Crows are a brave\nnation,–the bravest of all the Injuns; they fight like the white man;\nthey don’t kill you in the dark like the Black-foot varmint, and then\ntake your scalp and run, the cowardly reptiles. Eighty-three years\nlast––; and yet old Greenwood could handle the rifle as well as the\nbest on ’em, but for this infernal humour in my eyes, caught three\nyears ago in bringing the emigrators over the de-sart.” (A circle of\nscarlet surrounded his weeping eyeballs.) “I can’t see jist now as well\nas I did fifty years ago, but I can always bring the game or the\nslinking and skulking Injun. I have jist come over the mountains from\nSweetwater with the emigrators as pilot, living upon bacon, bread,\nmilk, and sich like mushy stuff. It don’t agree with me; it never will\nagree with a man of my age, eighty-three last ––; that is a long time\nto live. I thought I would take a small hunt to get a little exercise\nfor my old bones, and some good fresh meat. The grisly bear, fat deer,\nand poultry and fish–them are such things as a man should eat. I came\nup here, where I knew there was plenty. I was here twenty years ago,\nbefore any white man see this lake and the rich land about it. It’s\nfilled with big fish. That’s beer-springs here, better than them in the\nRocky Mountains; thar’s a mountain of solid brimstone, and thar’s mines\nof gold and silver, all of which I know’d many years ago, and I can\nshow them to you if you will go with me in the morning. These\nblack-skinned Spaniards have rebelled again. Wall, they can make a\nfuss, d–m ’em, and have revolutions every year, but they can’t fight.\nIt’s no use to go after ’em, unless when you ketch ’em you kill ’em.\nThey won’t stand an’ fight like men, an’ when they can’t fight longer\ngive up; but the skared varmints run away and then make another fuss,\nd–m ’em.” Such was the discourse of our host.",
        "The camp consisted of two small tents, which had probably been obtained\nfrom the emigrants. They were pitched so as to face each other, and\nbetween them there was a large pile of blazing logs. On the trees\nsurrounding the camp were stretched the skins of various animals which\nhad been killed in the hunt; some preserved for their hides, others for\nthe fur. Bear-meat and venison enough for a winter’s supply were\nhanging from the limbs. The swearing of Turner, a man of immense frame\nand muscular power, during our evening’s conversation, was almost\nterrific. I had heard mountain swearing before, but his went far beyond\nall former examples. He could do all the swearing for our army in\nMexico, and then have a surplus.",
        "The next morning (Nov. 3rd), after partaking of a hearty breakfast, and\nsuspending from our saddles a sufficient supply of venison and\nbear-meat for two days’ journey, we started back on our own trail. We\nleft our miserable Indian pilot at his rancheria. I gave him the\nshirt from my back, out of compassion for his sufferings–he well\ndeserved a dressing of another kind. It rained all day, and, when we\nreached Barnett’s (the empty house) after four o’clock, P.M., the black\nmasses of clouds which hung over the valley portended a storm so\nfurious, that we thought it prudent to take shelter under a roof for\nthe night. Securing our animals in one of the inclosures, we encamped\nin the deserted dwelling. The storm soon commenced, and raged and\nroared with a fierceness and strength rarely witnessed. The hogs and\npigs came squealing about the door for admission; and the cattle and\nhorses in the valley, terrified by the violence of elemental battle,\nran backwards and forwards, bellowing and snorting. In comfortable\nquarters, we roasted and enjoyed our bear-meat and venison, and left\nthe wind, rain, lightning, and thunder to play their pranks as best\nsuited them, which they did all night.",
        "On the morning of the fourth, we found the trail described to us by Mr.\nGreenwood, and, crossing a ridge of mountains, descended into the\nvalley of Nappa creek, which empties into the Bay of San Francisco just\nbelow the Straits of Carquinez. This is a most beautiful and fertile\nvalley, and is already occupied by several American settlers. Among the\nfirst who established themselves here is Mr. Yount, who soon after\nerected a flouring-mill and saw-mill. These have been in operation\nseveral years. Before reaching Mr. Yount’s settlement we passed a\nsaw-mill more recently erected, by Dr. Bale. There seems to be an\nabundance of pine and red-wood (a species of fir), in the canadas. No\nlumber can be superior for building purposes than that sawed from the\nred-wood. The trees are of immense size, straight, free from knots and\ntwists, and the wood is soft, and easily cut with plane and saw.\nArriving at the residence of Dr. Bale, in Nappa Valley, we were\nhospitably entertained by him with a late breakfast of coffee, boiled\neggs, steaks, and tortillas, served up in American style. Leaving\nNappa, after travelling down it some ten or twelve miles, we crossed\nanother range of hills or mountains, and reached Sonoma after dark, our\nclothing thoroughly drenched with the rain, which, with intermissions,\nhad fallen the whole day. I put up at the same quarters as when here\nbefore. The house was covered with a dilapidated thatch, and the rain\ndripped through it, not leaving a dry spot on the floor of the room\nwhere we slept. But there was an advantage in this–the inundation of\nwater had completely discomfited the army of fleas that infested the\nbuilding when we were here before.",
        "It rained incessantly on the fifth. Col. Russell arrived at Sonoma\nearly in the morning, having arrived from San Francisco last night.\nProcuring a boat belonging to Messrs. Howard and Mellus, lying at the\nembarcadero, I left for San Francisco, but, owing to the storm and\ncontrary winds, did not arrive there until the morning of the seventh,\nbeing two nights and a day in the creek, and churning on the bay.\nPurchasing a quantity of clothing, and other supplies for volunteers, I\nsailed early on the morning of the eighth for New Helvetia, in a boat\nbelonging to the sloop-of-war Portsmouth, manned by U.S. sailors, under\nthe command of Midshipman Byres, a native of Maysville, Ky. We encamped\nthat night at the head of “Soeson,” having sailed about fifty miles in\na severe storm of wind and rain. The waves frequently dashed entirely\nover our little craft. The rain continued during the ninth, and we\nencamped at night about the mouth of the Sacramento. On the night of\nthe tenth we encamped at “Meritt’s camp,” the rain still falling, and\nthe river rising rapidly, rendering navigation up-stream impossible,\nexcept with the aid of the tide. On the night of the eleventh we\nencamped fifteen miles below New Helvetia, still raining. On the\nmorning of the twelfth the clouds cleared away, and the sun burst out\nwarm and spring-like. After having been exposed to the rain for ten or\ntwelve days, without having the clothing upon me once dry, the sight of\nthe sun, and the influence of his beams, were cheering and most\nagreeable. We arrived at New Helvetia about twelve o’clock.",
        "  Leave New Helvetia\n  Pleasant weather\n  Meet Indian volunteers\n  Tule boats\n  Engagement between a party of Americans and Californians\n  Death of Capt. Burroughs and Capt. Foster\n  Capture of Thomas O. Larkin\n  Reconnaissance\n  San Juan Bautista\n  Neglect of the dead\n  Large herds of Cattle\n  Join Col. Fremont.",
        "On my arrival at New Helvetia, I found there Mr. Jacob. Mr. Reed had\nnot yet returned from the mountains. Nothing had been heard from Mr.\nLippincott, or Mr. Grayson, since I left the latter at Sonoma. An\nauthorized agent of Col. Fremont had arrived at the fort the day that I\nleft it, with power to take the caballada of public horses, and to\nenroll volunteers for the expedition to the south. He had left two or\nthree days before my arrival, taking with him all the horses and\ntrappings suitable for service, and all the men who had previously\nrendezvoused at the fort, numbering about sixty, as I understood. At\nmy request messengers were sent by Mr. Kern, commandant of the fort,\nand by Captain Sutter, to the Indian chiefs on the San Joaquin River\nand its tributaries, to meet me at the most convenient points on the\ntrail, with such warriors of their tribes as chose to volunteer as\nsoldiers of the United States, and perform military service during the\ncampaign. I believed that they would be useful as scouts and spies. On\nthe 14th and 15th eight men (emigrants who had just arrived in the\ncountry, and had been enrolled at Johnson’s settlement by Messrs. Reed\nand Jacob) arrived at the fort; and on the morning of the 16th, with\nthese, we started to join Colonel Fremont, supposed to be at Monterey;\nand we encamped at night on the Cosçumne River.",
        "The weather is now pleasant. We are occasionally drenched with a shower\nof rain, after which the sun shines warm and bright; the fresh grass is\nspringing up, and the birds sing and chatter in the groves and thickets\nas we pass through them. I rode forward, on the morning of the 17th, to\nthe Mickelemes River (twenty-five miles from the Cosçumne), where I met\nAntonio, an Indian chief, with twelve warriors, who had assembled hero\nfor the purpose of joining us. The names of the warriors were as\nfollows;–Santiago, Masua, Kiubu, Tocoso, Nonelo, Michael, Weala,\nArkell, Nicolas, Heel, Kasheano, Estephen. Our party coming up in the\nafternoon, we encamped here for the day, in order to give the Indians\ntime to make further preparations for the march. On the 18th we met, at\nthe ford of the San Joaquin River, another party of eighteen Indians,\nincluding their chiefs. Their names were–José Jesus, Filipe,\nRay-mundo, and Carlos, chiefs; Huligario, Bonefasio, Francisco,\nNicolas, Pablo, Feliciano, San Antonio, Polinario, Manuel, Graviano,\nSalinordio, Romero, and Merikeeldo, warriors. The chiefs and some of\nthe warriors of these parties were partially clothed, but most of them\nwere naked, except a small garment around the loins. They were armed\nwith bows and arrows. We encamped with our sable companions on the east\nbank of the San Joaquin.",
        "The next morning (Nov. 19), the river being too high to ford, we\nconstructed, by the aid of the Indians, tule-boats, upon which our\nbaggage was ferried over the stream. The tule-boat consists of bundles\nof tule firmly hound together with willow withes. When completed, in\nshape it is not unlike a small keel-boat. The buoyancy of one of these\ncraft is surprising. Six men, as many as could sit upon the deck, were\npassed over, in the largest of our three boats, at a time. The boats\nwere towed backwards and forwards by Indian swimmers–one at the bow,\nand one at the stern as steersman, and two on each side as propellers.\nThe poor fellows, when they came out of the cold water, trembled as if\nattacked with an ague. We encamped near the house of Mr. Livermore\n(previously described), where, after considerable difficulty, I\nobtained sufficient beef for supper, Mr. L. being absent. Most of the\nIndians did not get into camp until a late hour of the night, and some\nof them not until morning. They complained very much of sore feet, and\nwanted horses to ride, which I promised them as soon as they reached\nthe Pueblo de San José.",
        "About ten o’clock on the morning of the 20th, we slaughtered a beef in\nthe hills between Mr. Livermore’s and the mission of San José; and,\nleaving the hungry party to regale themselves upon it and then follow\non, I proceeded immediately to the Pueblo de San José to make further\narrangements, reaching that place just after sunset. On the 21st I\nprocured clothing for the Indians, which, when they arrived with Mr.\nJacob in the afternoon, was distributed among them.",
        "On my arrival at the Pueblo, I found the American population there much\nexcited by intelligence just received of the capture on the 15th,\nbetween Monterey and the mission of San Juan, of Thos. O. Larkin, Esq.,\nlate U.S. Consul in California, by a party of Californians, and of an\nengagement between the same Californians and a party of Americans\nescorting a caballada of 400 horses to Colonel Fremont’s camp in\nMonterey. In this affair three Americans were killed, viz.: Capt.\nBurroughs, Capt. Foster, and Mr. Eames, late of St. Louis, Mo. The\nmission of San Juan lies on the road between the Pueblo de San José and\nMonterey, about fifty miles from the former place, and thirty from the\nlatter. The skirmish took place ten miles south of San Juan, near the\nMonterey road. I extract the following account of this affair from a\njournal of his captivity published by Mr. Larkin:–",
        "“On the 10th of November, from information received of the sickness of\nmy family in San Francisco, where they had gone to escape the expected\nrevolutionary troubles in Monterey, and from letters from Captain\nMontgomery requesting my presence respecting some stores for the\nPortsmouth, I, with one servant, left Monterey for San Francisco,\nknowing that for one month no Californian forces had been within 100\nmiles of us. That night I put up at the house of Don Joaquin Gomez,\nsending my servant to San Juan, six miles beyond, to request Mr. J.\nThompson to wait for me, as he was on the road for San Francisco. About\nmidnight I was aroused from my bed by the noise made by ten\nCalifornians (unshaved and unwashed for months, being in the mountains)\nrushing into my chamber with guns, swords, pistols, and torches in\ntheir hands. I needed but a moment to be fully awake and know my exact\nsituation; the first cry was, ’Como estamos, Senor Consul.’ ’Vamos,\nSenor Larkin.’ At my bedside were several letters that I had re-read\nbefore going to bed. On dressing myself, while my captors were saddling\nmy horse, I assorted these letters, and put them into different\npockets. After taking my own time to dress and arrange my valise, we\nstarted, and rode to a camp of seventy or eighty men on the banks of\nthe Monterey River; there each officer and principal person passed the\ntime of night with me, and a remark or two. The commandante took me on\none side, and informed me that his people demanded that I should write\nto San Juan, to the American captain of volunteers, saying that I had\nleft Monterey to visit the distressed families of the river, and\nrequest or demand that twenty men should meet me before daylight, that\nI could station them, before my return to town, in a manner to protect\nthese families. The natives, he said, were determined on the act being\naccomplished. I at first endeavoured to reason with him on the infamy\nand the impossibility of the deed, but to no avail; he said my life\ndepended on the letter; that he was willing, nay, anxious to preserve\nmy life as an old acquaintance, but could not control his people in\nthis affair. From argument I came to a refusal; he advised, urged, and\ndemanded. At this period an officer called out * * * * (Come here,\nthose who are named.) I then said, ’In this manner you may act and\nthreaten night by night; my life on such condition is of no value or\npleasure to me. I am by accident your prisoner–make the most of\nme–write, I will not; shoot as you see fit, and I am done talking on\nthe subject.’ I left him, and went to the camp fire. For a half-hour or\nmore there was some commotion around me, when all disturbance subsided.",
        "“At daylight we started, with a flag flying and a drum beating, and\ntravelled eight or ten miles, when we camped in a low valley or hollow.\nThere they caught with the lasso three or four head of cattle belonging\nto the nearest rancho, and breakfasted. The whole day their outriders\nrode in every direction, on the look-out, to see if the American\ncompany left the mission of San Juan, or Lieutenant-Colonel Fremont\nleft Monterey; they also rode to all the neighbouring ranches, and\nforced the rancheros to join them. At one o’clock, they began their\nmarch with one hundred and thirty men (and two or three hundred extra\nhorses); they marched in four single files, occupying four positions,\nmyself under charge of an officer and five or six men in the centre.\nTheir plan of operation for the night was, to rush into San Juan ten or\nfifteen men, who were to retreat, under the expectation that the\nAmericans would follow them, in which case the whole party outside was\nto cut them off. I was to be retained in the centre of the party. Ten\nmiles south of the mission, they encountered eight or ten Americans, a\npart of whom retreated into a low ground covered with oaks, the others\nreturned to the house of Senor Gomez, to alarm their companions. For\nover one hour the hundred and thirty Californians surrounded the six or\neight Americans, occasionally giving and receiving shots. During this\nperiod, I was several times requested, then commanded, to go among the\noaks and bring out my countrymen, and offer them their lives on giving\nup their rifles and persons. I at last offered to go and call them out,\non condition that they should return to San Juan or go to Monterey,\nwith their arms; this being refused, I told the commandante to go in\nand bring them out himself. While they were consulting how this could\nbe done, fifty Americans came down on them, which caused an action of\nabout twenty or thirty minutes. Thirty or forty of the natives leaving\nthe field at the first fire, they remained drawn off by fives and tens\nuntil the Americans had the field to themselves. Both parties remained\nwithin a mile of each other until dark. Our countrymen lost Captain\nBurroughs of St. Louis, Missouri, Captain Foster, and two others, with\ntwo or three wounded. The Californians lost two of their countrymen,\nand José Garcia, of Val., Chili, with seven wounded.”",
        "The following additional particulars I extract from the “Californian\"\nnewspaper of November 21, 1846, published at Monterey: “Burroughs and\nFoster were killed at the first onset. The Americans fired, and then\ncharged on the enemy with their empty rifles, and ran them off.\nHowever, they still kept rallying, and firing now and then a musket at\nthe Americans until about eleven o’clock at night, when one of the\nWalla-Walla Indians offered his services to come into Monterey and give\nColonel Fremont notice of what was passing. Soon after he started he\nwas pursued by a party of the enemy. The foremost in pursuit drove a\nlance at the Indian, who, trying to parry it, received the lance\nthrough his hand; he immediately, with his other hand, seized his\ntomahawk, and struck his opponent, splitting his head from the crown to\nthe mouth. By this time the others had come up, and, with the most\nextraordinary dexterity and bravery, the Indian vanquished two more,\nand the rest ran away. He rode on towards this town as far as his horse\nwas able to carry him, and then left his horse and saddle, and came in\non foot. He arrived here about eight o’clock on Tuesday morning,\nDecember 17th.”",
        "The Americans engaged in this affair were principally the volunteer\nemigrants just arrived in the country, and who had left New Helvetia a\nfew days in advance of me.",
        "Colonel Fremont marched from Monterey as soon as he heard of this\nskirmish, in pursuit of the Californians, but did not meet with them.\nHe then encamped at the mission of San Juan, waiting there the arrival\nof the remaining volunteers from above.",
        "Leaving the Pueblo on the afternoon of the 25th, in conjunction with a\nsmall force commanded by Captain Weber, we made an excursion into the\nhills, near a rancho owned by Captain W., where were herded some two or\nthree hundred public horses. It had been rumoured that a party of\nCalifornians were hovering about here, intending to capture and drive\noff these horses. The next day (November 26th), without having met any\nhostile force, driving these horses before us, we encamped at Mr.\nMurphy’s rancho. Mr. Murphy is the father of a large and respectable\nfamily, who emigrated to this country some three or four years since\nfrom, the United States, being originally from Canada. His daughter,\nMiss Helen, who did the honours of the rude cabin, in manners,\nconversation, and personal charms, would grace any drawing-room. On the\n28th, we proceeded down the Pueblo valley, passing Gilroy’s rancho, and\nreaching the mission of San Juan just before dark. The hills and\nvalleys are becoming verdant with fresh grass and wild oats, the latter\nbeing, in places, two or three inches high. So tender is it, however,\nthat it affords but little nourishment to our horses.",
        "The mission of San Juan Bautista has been one of the most extensive of\nthese establishments. The principal buildings are more durably\nconstructed than those of other missions I have visited, and they are\nin better condition. Square bricks are used in paving the corridors and\nthe ground floors. During the twilight, I strayed accidentally through\na half-opened gate into a cemetery, inclosed by a high wall in the rear\nof the church. The spectacle was ghastly enough. The exhumed skeletons\nof those who had been deposited here lay thickly strewn around, showing\nbut little respect for the sanctity of the grave, or the rights of the\ndead from the living. The cool damp night-breeze sighed and moaned\nthrough the shrubbery and ruinous arches and corridors, planted and\nreared by those whose neglected bones were now exposed to the rude\ninsults of man and beast. I could not but imagine that the voices of\ncomplaining spirits mingled with these dismal and mournful tones; and\nplucking a cluster of roses, the fragrance of which was delicious, I\nleft the spot, to drive away the sadness and melancholy produced by the\nscene.",
        "The valley contiguous to the mission is extensive, well watered by a\nlarge arroyo, and highly fertile. The gardens and other lands for\ntillage are inclosed by willow hedges. Elevated hills, or mountains,\nbound this valley on the east and west. Large herds of cattle were\nscattered over the valley, greedily cropping the fresh green herbage,\nwhich now carpets mountain and plain.",
        "Colonel Fremont marched from San Juan this morning, and encamped, as we\nlearned on our arrival, ten miles south. Proceeding up the arroyo on\nthe 29th, we reached the camp of Colonel F. about noon. I immediately\nreported, and delivered over to him the men and horses under my charge.\nThe men were afterwards organized into a separate corps, of which Mr.\nR.T. Jacob, my travelling companion, was appointed the captain by\nColonel Fremont.",

        "November 30.–The battalion of mounted riflemen, under the command of\nLieutenant-Colonel Fremont, numbers, rank and file, including Indians,\nand servants, 428. With the exception of the exploring party, which\nleft the United States with Colonel F., they are composed of volunteers\nfrom the American settlers, and the emigrants who have arrived in the\ncountry within a few weeks. The latter have generally furnished their\nown ammunition and other equipments for the expedition. Most of these\nare practised riflemen, men of undoubted courage, and capable of\nbearing any fatigue and privations endurable by veteran troops. The\nIndians are composed of a party of Walla-Wallas from Oregon, and a\nparty of native Californians. Attached to the battalion are two pieces\nof artillery, under the command of Lieutenant McLane, of the navy. In\nthe appearance of our small army there is presented but little of “the\npomp and circumstance of glorious war.” There are no plumes nodding\nover brazen helmets, nor coats of broadcloth spangled with lace and\nbuttons. A broad-brimmed low-crowned hat, a shirt of blue flannel, or\nbuckskin, with pantaloons and mocassins of the same, all generally much\nthe worse for wear, and smeared with mud and dust, make up the costume\nof the party, officers as well as men. A leathern girdle surrounds the\nwaist, from which are suspended a bowie and a hunter’s knife, and\nsometimes a brace of pistols. These, with the rifle and\nholster-pistols, are the arms carried by officers and privates. A\nsingle bugle (and a sorry one it is) composes the band. Many an embryo\nNapoleon, in his own conceit, whose martial spirit has been excited to\nflaming intensity of heat by the peacock-plumage and gaudy trappings of\nour militia companies, when marching through the streets to the sound\nof drum, fife, and brass band, if he could have looked upon us, and\nthen consulted the state of the military thermometer within him, would\nprobably have discovered that the mercury of his heroism had fallen\nseveral degrees below zero. He might even have desired that we should\nnot come",

        "After a march of six or eight hours, up the valley of the arroyo,\nthrough a heavy rain, and mud so deep that several of our horses gave\nout from exhaustion, we encamped in a circular bottom, near a deserted\nadobe house. A caballada, of some 500 or 600 loose horses and mules\nis driven along with us, but many of them are miserable sore-backed\nskeletons, having been exhausted with hard usage and bad fare during\nthe summer campaign. Besides these, we have a large number of\npack-mules, upon which all our baggage and provisions are transported.\nDistance 10 miles.",
        "We did not move on the 1st and 2d of December. There being no cattle in\nthe vicinity of our camp, a party was sent back to the mission, on the\nmorning of the 1st, who in the afternoon returned, driving before them\nabout 100 head, most of them in good condition. After a sufficient\nnumber were slaughtered to supply the camp with meat for the day, the\nremainder were confined in a corral prepared for the purpose, to be\ndriven along with us, and slaughtered from day to day. The rain has\ncontinued, with short intermissions, since we commenced our march on\nthe 30th of November. The ground has become saturated with water, and\nthe small branches are swollen into large streams. Notwithstanding\nthese discomforts, the men are in good spirits, and enjoy themselves in\nsinging, telling stories, and playing monte.",
        "December 3.–The rain ceased falling about 8 o’clock this morning;\nand, the clouds breaking away, the sun cheered us once more with his\npleasant beams. The battalion was formed into a hollow square, and, the\norder of the day being read, we resumed our march. Our progress,\nthrough the deep mud, was very slow. The horses were constantly giving\nout, and many were left behind. The young and tender grass upon which\nthey feed affords but little nourishment, and hard labour soon exhausts\nthem. We encamped on a low bluff, near the arroyo, timbered with\nevergreen oak. Distance 8 miles.",
        "December 4.–I was ordered with a small party in advance this\nmorning. Proceeding up the valley a few miles, we left it, crossing\nseveral steep hills sparsely timbered with oak, from which we descended\ninto another small valley, down which we continued to the point of its\ntermination, near some narrow and difficult mountain gorges. In\nexploring the gorges, we discovered the trail of a party of\nCalifornians, which had passed south several days before us, and found\na horse which they had left in their march. This, doubtless, was a\nportion of the party which captured Mr. Larkin, and had the engagement\nbetween Monterey and St. Juan, on the 17th ult. The main body coming\nup, we encamped at three o’clock. The old grass around our camp is\nabundant; but having been so much washed by the rains, and consequently\nexhausted of its nutritious qualities, the animals refused to eat it.\nThe country over which we have travelled to-day, and as far as I can\nsee, is mountainous and broken, little of it being adapted to other\nagricultural purposes than grazing.",
        "Thirteen beeves are slaughtered every afternoon for the consumption of\nthe battalion. These beeves are generally of good size, and in fair\ncondition. Other provisions being entirely exhausted, beef constitutes\nthe only subsistence for the men, and most of the officers. Under these\ncircumstances, the consumption of beef is astonishing. I do not know\nthat I shall be believed when I state a fact, derived from observation\nand calculation, that the average consumption per man of fresh beef is\nat least ten pounds per day. Many of them, I believe, consume much\nmore, and some of them less. Nor does this quantity appear to be\ninjurious to health, or fully to satisfy the appetite. I have seen some\nof the men roast their meat and devour it by the fire from the hour of\nencamping until late bed-time. They would then sleep until one or two\no’clock in the morning, when, the cravings of hunger being greater than\nthe desire for repose, the same occupation would be resumed, and\ncontinued until the order was given to march. The Californian beef is\ngenerally fat, juicy, and tender, and surpasses in flavour any which I\never tasted elsewhere. Distance 10 miles.",
        "December 5.–I rose before daylight. The moon shone brightly. The\ntemperature was cold. The vapour in the atmosphere had congealed and\nfallen upon the ground in feathery flakes, covering it with a white\nsemi-transparent veil, or crystal sheen, sparkling in the moonbeams.\nThe smoke from the numerous camp-fires soon began to curl languidly up\nin graceful wreaths, settling upon the mountain summits. The scene was\none for the pencil and brush of the artist; but, when the envious sun\nrose, he soon stripped Madam Earth of her gauzy holiday morning-gown,\nand exposed her every-day petticoat of mud.",
        "Our march to-day has been one of great difficulty, through a deep\nbrushy mountain gorge, through which it was almost impossible to force\nthe field-pieces. In one place they were lowered with ropes down a\nsteep and nearly perpendicular precipice of great height and depth. We\nencamped about three o’clock, P.M., in a small valley. Many of the\nhorses gave out on the march, and were left behind by the men, who came\nstraggling into camp until a late hour of the evening, bringing their\nsaddles and baggage upon their shoulders. I noticed, while crossing an\nelevated ridge of hills, flakes of snow flying in the air, but melting\nbefore they reached the ground. The small spring-branch on which we\nencamped empties into the Salinas River. The country surrounding us is\nelevated and broken, and the soil sandy, with but little timber or\ngrass upon it. Distance 12 miles.",
        "December 6.–Morning clear and cool. Crossed an undulating country,\ndestitute of timber and water, and encamped in a circular valley\nsurrounded by elevated hills, through which flows a small tributary of\nthe Salinas. The summits of the mountains in sight are covered with\nsnow, but the temperature in the valleys is pleasant. Distance 15\nmiles.",
        "December 7.–Ice, the first I have seen since entering California,\nformed in the branch, of the thickness of window-glass. We reached the\nvalley of the Salinas about eleven o’clock A.M., and encamped for the\nday. The river Salinas (laid down in some maps as Rio San Buenaventura)\nrises in the mountains to the south, and has a course of some sixty or\neighty miles, emptying into the Pacific about twelve miles north of\nMonterey. The valley, as it approaches the ocean, is broad and fertile,\nand there are many fine ranchos upon it. But, higher up, the stream\nbecomes dry in the summer, and the soil of the valley is arid and\nsandy. The width of the stream at this point is about thirty yards. Its\nbanks are skirted by narrow belts of small timber. A range of elevated\nmountains rises between this valley and the coast. A court-martial was\nheld to-day, for the trial of sundry offenders. Distance 8 miles.",
        "December 8.–Morning cool, clear, and pleasant. Two Californians were\narrested by the rear-guard near a deserted rancho, and brought into\ncamp. One of them turned out to be a person known to be friendly to the\nAmericans. There has been but little variation in the soil or scenery.\nBut few attempts appear to have been made to settle this portion of\nCalifornia. The thefts and hostilities of the Tular Indians are said to\nbe one of the causes preventing its settlement. Distance 15 miles.",
        "December 9.–The mornings are cool, but the middle of the day is too\nwarm to ride comfortably with our coats on. Our march has been\nfatiguing and difficult, through several brushy ravines and over steep\nand elevated hills. Many horses gave out as usual, and were left, from\ninability to travel. Our caballada is diminishing rapidly. Distance\n10 miles.",
        "December 10.–Our march has been on the main beaten trail, dry and\nhard, and over a comparatively level country. We passed the mission of\nSan Miguel about three o’clock, and encamped in a grove of large oak\ntimber, three or four miles south of it. This mission is situated on\nthe upper waters of the Salinas, in an extensive plain. Under the\nadministration of the padres it was a wealthy establishment, and\nmanufactures of various kinds were carried on. They raised immense\nnumbers of sheep, the fleeces of which were manufactured by the Indians\ninto blankets and coarse cloths. Their granaries were filled with an\nabundance of maize and frijoles, and their store-rooms with other\nnecessaries of life, from the ranchos belonging to the mission lands in\nthe vicinity. Now all the buildings, except the church and the\nprincipal range of houses contiguous, have fallen into ruins, and an\nEnglishman, his wife, and one small child, with two or three Indian\nservants, are the sole inhabitants. The church is the largest I have\nseen in the country, and its interior is in good repair, although it\nhas not probably been used for the purpose of public worship for many\nyears. The Englishman professes to have purchased the mission and all\nthe lands belonging to it for 300 dollars.",
        "Our stock of cattle being exhausted, we feasted on Californian mutton,\nsheep being more abundant than cattle at this mission. The wool, I\nnoticed, was coarse, but the mutton was of an excellent quality. The\ncountry over which we have travelled to-day shows the marks of long\ndrought previous to the recent rains. The soil is sandy and gravelly,\nand the dead vegetation upon it is thin and stunted. About eighty of\nour horses are reported to have given out and been left behind.\nDistance 20 miles.",
        "December 12.–To relieve our horses, which are constantly giving out\nfrom exhaustion, the grass being insufficient for their sustenance\nwhile performing labour, the entire battalion, officers and men, were\nordered to march on foot, turning their horses, with the saddles and\nbridles upon them, into the general caballada, to be driven along by\nthe horse-guard. The day has been drizzly, cold, and disagreeable. The\ncountry has a barren and naked appearance; but this, I believe, is\nattributable to the extreme drought that has prevailed in this region\nfor one or two years past. We encamped near the rancho of a friendly\nCalifornian–the man who was taken prisoner the other day and set at\nlarge. An Indian, said to be the servant of Tortoria Pico, was captured\nhere by the advance party. A letter was found upon him, but the\ncontents of which I never learned. This being the first foot-march,\nthere were, of course, many galled and blistered feet in the battalion.\nMy servant obtained, with some difficulty, from the Indians at the\nrancho, a pint-cup of pinole, or parched corn-meal, and a quart or\ntwo of wheat, which, being boiled, furnished some variety in our viands\nat supper, fresh beef having been our only subsistence since the\ncommencement of the march from San Juan. Distance 12 miles.",
        "December 13.–A rainy disagreeable morning. Mr. Stanley, one of the\nvolunteers, and one of the gentlemen who so kindly supplied us with\nprovisions on Mary’s River, died last night. He has been suffering from\nan attack of typhoid fever since the commencement of our march, and\nunable most of the time to sit upon his horse. He was buried this\nmorning in a small circular opening in the timber near our camp. The\nbattalion was formed in a hollow square surrounding the grave which had\nbeen excavated for the final resting-place of our deceased friend and\ncomrade. There was neither bier, nor coffin, nor pall–",
        "    “Not a drum was heard, nor a funeral note.”",
        "The cold earth was heaped upon his mortal remains in silent solemnity,\nand the ashes of a braver or a better man will never repose in the\nlonely hills of California.",
        "After the funeral the battalion was marched a short distance to witness\nanother scene, not more mournful, but more harrowing than the last. The\nIndian captured at the rancho yesterday was condemned to die. He was\nbrought from his place of confinement and tied to a tree. Here he stood\nsome fifteen or twenty minutes, until the Indians from a neighbouring\nrancheria could be brought to witness the execution. A file of\nsoldiers were then ordered to fire upon him. He fell upon his knees,\nand remained in that position several minutes without uttering a groan,\nand then sank upon the earth. No human being could have met his fate\nwith more composure, or with stronger manifestations of courage. It was\na scene such as I desire never to witness again.",
        "A cold rain fell upon us during the entire day’s march. We encamped at\nfour o’clock, P.M.; but the rain poured down in such torrents that it\nwas impossible to light our camp-fires and keep them burning. This\ncontinued nearly the whole night, and I have rarely passed a night more\nuncomfortably. A scouting party brought in two additional prisoners\nthis evening. Another returned, and reported the capture of a number of\nhorses, and the destruction of a rancho by fire. Distance 12 miles.",
        "December 14.–The battalion commenced its march on foot and in a\nheavy rain. The mud is very deep, and we have been compelled to wade\nseveral streams of considerable depth, being swollen by the recent\nrains. At one o’clock a halt was ordered, and beef slaughtered and\ncooked for dinner. The march was resumed late in the afternoon, and the\nplain surrounding the mission of San Luis Obispo was reached in the\npitch darkness of the night, a family in the canada having been taken\nprisoners by the advance party to prevent them from giving the alarm.\nThe battalion was so disposed as to surround the mission and take\nprisoners all contained within it. The place was entered in great\nconfusion, on account of the darkness, about nine o’clock. There was no\nmilitary force at the mission, and the few inhabitants were greatly\nalarmed, as may well be supposed, by this sudden invasion. They made no\nresistance, and were all taken prisoners except one or two, who managed\nto escape and fled in great terror, no one knew where or how. It being\nascertained that Tortoria Pico, a man who has figured conspicuously in\nmost of the Californian revolutions, was in the neighbourhood, a party\nwas despatched immediately to the place, and he was brought in a\nprisoner. The night was rainy and boisterous, and the soldiers were\nquartered to the best advantage in the miserable mud houses, and no\nacts of violence or outrage of any kind were committed.",
        "The men composing the Californian battalion, as I have before stated,\nhave been drawn from many sources, and are roughly clad, and\nweather-beaten in their exterior appearance; but I feel it but justice\nhere to state my belief, that no military party ever passed through an\nenemy’s country and observed the same strict regard for the rights of\nits population. I never heard of an outrage, or even a trespass being\ncommitted by one of the American volunteers during our entire march.\nEvery American appeared to understand perfectly the duty which he owed\nto himself and others in this respect, and the deportment of the\nbattalion might be cited as a model for imitation.

        "December 15.–The rain fell in cataracts the entire day. The small\nstreams which flow from the mountains through, and water the valley of,\nSan Luis Obispo, are swollen by the deluge of water from the clouds\ninto foaming unfordable torrents. In order not to trespass upon the\npopulation at the mission, in their miserable abodes of mud, the church\nwas opened, and a large number of the soldiers were quartered in it. A\nguard, however, was set day and night, over the chancel and all other\nproperty contained in the building, to prevent its being injured or\ndisturbed. The decorations of the church are much the same as I have\nbefore described. The edifice is large, and the interior in good\nrepair. The floor is paved with square bricks. I noticed a common\nhand-organ in the church, which played the airs we usually hear from\norgan-grinders in the street.",
        "Besides the main large buildings connected with the church, there are\nstanding, and partially occupied, several small squares of adobe\nhouses, belonging to this mission. The heaps of mud, and crumbling\nwalls outside of these, are evidence that the place was once of much\ngreater extent, and probably one of the most opulent and prosperous\nestablishments of the kind in the country. The lands surrounding the\nmission are finely situated for cultivation and irrigation if\nnecessary. There are several large gardens, inclosed by high and\nsubstantial walls, which now contain a great variety of fruit-trees and\nshrubbery. I noticed the orange, fig, palm, olive, and grape. There are\nalso large inclosures hedged in by the prickly-pear (cactus), which\ngrows to an enormous size, and makes an impervious barrier against man\nor beast. The stalks of some of these plants are of the thickness of a\nman’s body, and grow to the height of fifteen feet. A juicy fruit is\nproduced by the prickly-pear, named tuna, from which a beverage is\nsometimes made, called calinche. It has a pleasant flavour, as has\nalso the fruit, which, when ripe, is blood-red. A small quantity of\npounded wheat was found here, which, being purchased, was served out to\nthe troops, about a pound to the man. Frijoles and pumpkins were also\nobtained, delicacies of no common order.",
        "December 16.–A court-martial was convened this morning for the trial\nof Pico, the principal prisoner, on the charge, I understood, of the\nforfeiture of his parole which had been taken on a former occasion. The\nsentence of the court was, that he should be shot or hung, I do not\nknow which. A rumour is current among the population here, that there\nhas been an engagement between a party of Americans and Californians,\nnear Los Angeles, in which the former were defeated with the loss of\nthirty men killed.",
        "December 17.–Cool, with a hazy sky. While standing in one of the\ncorridors this morning, a procession of females passed by me, headed by\na lady of fine appearance and dressed with remarkable taste and\nneatness, compared with those who followed her. Their rebososconcealed the faces of most of them, except the leader, whose beautiful\nfeatures, dare say, she thought (and justly) required no concealment.\nThey proceeded to the quarters of Colonel Fremont, and their object, I\nunderstood, was to petition for the reprieve or pardon of Pico, who had\nbeen condemned to death by the court-martial yesterday, and whose\nexecution was expected to take place this morning. Their intercession\nwas successful, as no execution took place, and in a short time all the\nprisoners were discharged, and the order to saddle up and march given.\nWe resumed our march at ten o’clock, and encamped just before sunset in\na small but picturesque and fertile valley timbered with oak, so near\nthe coast that the roar of the surf breaking against the shore could be\nheard distinctly. Distance seven miles.",
        "December 18.–Clear, with a delightful temperature. Before the sun\nrose the grass was covered with a white frost. The day throughout has\nbeen calm and beautiful. A march of four miles brought us to the shore\nof a small indentation in the coast of the Pacific, where vessels can\nanchor, and boats can land when the wind is not too fresh. The surf is\nnow rolling and foaming with prodigious energy–breaking upon the beach\nin long lines one behind the other, and striking the shore like\ncataracts. The hills and plains are verdant with a carpet of fresh\ngrass, and the scattered live-oaks on all sides, appearing like\norchards of fruit-trees, give to the country an old and cultivated\naspect. The mountains bench away on our left, the low hills rising in\ngentle conical forms, beyond which are the more elevated and\nprecipitous peaks covered with snow. We encamped about three o’clock\nnear the rancho of Captain Dana, in a large and handsome valley well\nwatered by an arroyo.",
        "Captain Dana is a native of Massachusetts, and has resided in this\ncountry about thirty years. He is known and esteemed throughout\nCalifornia for his intelligence and private virtues, and his unbounded\ngenerosity and hospitality. I purchased here a few loaves of wheat\nbread, and distributed them among the men belonging to our company as\nfar as they would go, a luxury which they have not indulged in since\nthe commencement of the march. Distance 15 miles.",
        "December 19.–The night was cold and tempestuous, with a slight fall\nof rain. The clouds broke away after sunrise, and the day became warm\nand pleasant. We continued our march up the valley, and encamped near\nits head. The table-land and hills are generally gravelly, but appear\nto be productive of fine grass. The soil of the bottom is of the\nrichest and most productive composition. We crossed in the course of\nthe day a wide flat plain, upon which were grazing large herds of\nbrood-mares (manadas) and cattle. In the distance they resembled\nlarge armies approaching us. The peaks of the elevated mountains in\nsight are covered with snow. A large number of horses gave out,\nstrayed, and were left behind to-day, estimated at one hundred. The men\ncame into camp bringing their saddles on their backs, and some of them\narriving late in the evening. Distance 18 miles.",
        "December 20.–Parties were sent back this morning to gather up horses\nand baggage left on the march yesterday, and it was one o’clock before\nthe rear-guard, waiting for the return of those, left camp. The main\nbody made a short march and encamped early, in a small hollow near the\nrancho of Mr. Faxon, through which flows an arroyo, the surrounding\nhills being timbered with evergreen oaks. The men amused themselves\nduring the afternoon in target-shooting. Many of the battalion are fine\nmarksmen with the rifle, and the average of shots could not easily be\nsurpassed. The camp spread over an undulating surface of half a mile in\ndiameter, and at night, when the fires were lighted, illuminating the\ngrove, with its drapery of drooping Spanish moss, it presented a most\npicturesque appearance. Distance 3 miles.",
        "December 21.–Clear and pleasant. A foot march was ordered, with the\nexception of the horse and baggage guard. We marched several miles\nthrough a winding hollow, passing a deserted rancho, and ascending with\nmuch labour a steep ridge of hills, descending which we entered a\nhandsome valley, and encamped upon a small stream about four miles from\nthe mission of St. Ynes. The banks of the arroyo are strewn with dead\nand prostrate timber, the trees, large and small, having been\noverthrown by tornados. The plain has suffered, like much of the\ncountry we have passed through, by a long-continued drought, but the\ncomposition of the soil is such as indicates fertility, and from the\neffects of the late rains the grass is springing up with great\nluxuriance, from places which before were entirely denuded of\nvegetation. A party was sent from camp to inspect the mission, but\nreturned without making any important discoveries. Our horses are so\nweak that many of them are unable to carry their saddles, and were left\non the road as usual. A man had his leg broken on the march to-day, by\nthe kick of a mule. He was sent back to the rancho of Mr. Faxon.\nDistance 15 miles.",
        "December 22.–Clear and pleasant. Being of the party which performed\nrear-guard duty to-day, with orders to bring in all stragglers, we did\nnot leave camp until several hours after the main body had left. The\nhorses of the caballada and the pack-animals were continually giving\nout and refusing to proceed. Parties of men, exhausted, lay down upon\nthe ground, and it was with much urging, and sometimes with peremptory\ncommands only, that they could be prevailed upon to proceed. The\ncountry bears the same marks of drought heretofore described, but fresh\nvegetation is now springing up and appears vigorous. A large\nhorse-trail loading into one of the canadas of the mountains on our\nleft was discovered by the scouts, and a party was dispatched to trace\nit. We passed one deserted rancho, and reached camp between nine and\nten o’clock at night, having forced in all the men and most of the\nhorses and pack-mules. Distance 15 miles.",
        "December 23.–Rain fell steadily and heavily the entire day. A small\nparty of men was in advance. Discovering in a brushy valley two Indians\narmed with bows and arrows, they were taken prisoners. Learning from\nthem that there was a caballada of horses secreted in one of the\ncanadas, they continued on about ten miles, and found about\ntwenty-five fresh fat horses, belonging to a Californian now among the\ninsurgents below. They were taken and delivered at the camp near the\neastern base of the St. Ynes Mountain. Passed this morning a rancho\ninhabited by a foreigner, an Englishman.",
        "December 24.–Cloudy and cool, with an occasional sprinkling rain.\nOur route to-day lay directly over the St. Ynes Mountain, by an\nelevated and most difficult pass. The height of this mountain is\nseveral thousand feet. We reached the summit about twelve o’clock, and,\nour company composing the advance-guard, we encamped about a mile and a\nhalf in advance of the main body of the battalion, at a point which\noverlooks the beautiful plain of Santa Barbara, of which, and the ocean\nbeyond, we had a most extended and interesting view. With the\nspy-glass, we could see, in the plain far below us, herds of cattle\nquietly grazing upon the green herbage that carpets its gentle\nundulations. The plain is dotted with groves, surrounding the springs\nand belting the small water-courses, of which there are many flowing\nfrom this range of mountains. Ranchos are scattered far up and down the\nplain, but not one human being could be seen stirring. About ten or\ntwelve miles to the south, the white towers of the mission of Santa\nBarbara raise themselves. Beyond is the illimitable waste of waters. A\nmore lovely and picturesque landscape I never beheld. On the summit of\nthe mountain, and surrounding us, there is a growth of hawthorn,\nmanzinita (in bloom), and other small shrubbery. The rock is soft\nsandstone and conglomerate, immense masses of which, piled one upon\nanother, form a wall along the western brow of the mountain, through\nwhich there is a single pass or gateway about eight or ten feet in\nwidth. The descent on the western side is precipitous, and appears\nalmost impassable. Distance 4 miles.",
        "December 25.–Christmas-day, and a memorable one to me. Owing to the\ndifficulty in hauling the cannon up the steep acclivities of the\nmountain, the main body of the battalion did not come up with us until\ntwelve o’clock, and before we commenced the descent of the mountain a\nfurious storm commenced, raging with a violence rarely surpassed. The\nrain fell in torrents, and the wind blew almost with the force of a\ntornado. This fierce strife of the elements continued without abatement\nthe entire afternoon, and until two o’clock at night. Driving our\nhorses before us, we were compelled to slide down the steep and\nslippery rocks, or wade through deep gullies and ravines filled with\nmud and foaming torrents of water, that rushed downwards with such\nforce as to carry along the loose rocks and tear up the trees and\nshrubbery by the roots. Many of the horses falling into the ravines\nrefused to make an effort to extricate themselves, and were swept\ndownwards and drowned. Others, bewildered by the fierceness and terrors\nof the storm, rushed or fell headlong over the steep precipices and\nwere killed. Others obstinately refused to proceed, but stood quaking\nwith fear or shivering with cold, and many of these perished in the\nnight from the severity of the storm. The advance party did not reach\nthe foot of the mountain and find a place to encamp until night–and a\nnight of more impenetrable and terrific darkness I never witnessed. The\nground upon which our camp was made, although sloping from the hills to\na small stream, was so saturated with water that men as well as horses\nsunk deep at every step. The rain fell in such quantities, that fires\nwith great difficulty could be lighted, and most of them were\nimmediately extinguished.",
        "The officers and men belonging to the company having the cannon in\ncharge laboured until nine or ten o’clock to bring them down the\nmountain, but they were finally compelled to leave them. Much of the\nbaggage also remained on the side of the mountain, with the pack-mules\nand horses conveying them, all efforts to force the animals down being\nfruitless. The men continued to straggle into the camp until a late\nhour of the night;–some crept under the shelving rocks and did not\ncome in until the next morning. We were so fortunate as to find our\ntent, and after much difficulty pitched it under an oak-tree. All\nefforts to light a fire and keep it blazing proving abortive, we spread\nour blankets upon the ground and endeavoured to sleep, although we\ncould feel the cold streams of water running through the tent and\nbetween and around our bodies.",
        "In this condition we remained until about two o’clock in the morning,\nwhen the storm having abated I rose, and shaking from my garments the\ndripping water, after many unsuccessful efforts succeeded in kindling a\nfire. Near our tent I found three soldiers who had reached camp at a\nlate hour. They were fast asleep on the ground, the water around them\nbeing two or three inches deep; but they had taken care to keep their\nheads above water, by using a log of wood for a pillow. The fire\nbeginning to blaze freely, I dug a ditch with my hands and a sharp\nstick of wood, which drained off the pool surrounding the tent. One of\nthe men, when he felt the sensation consequent upon being “high and\ndry,” roused himself, and, sitting upright, looked around for some time\nwith an expression of bewildered amazement. At length he seemed to\nrealize the true state of the case, and exclaimed, in a tone of\nenergetic soliloquy,–",
        "“Well, who wouldn’t be a soldier and fight for California?”",
        "“You are mistaken,” I replied.",
        "Rubbing his eyes, he gazed at me with astonishment, as if having been\nentirely unconscious of my presence; but, reassuring himself, he said:",
        "“How mistaken?”",
        "“Why,” I answered, “you are not fighting for California.”",
        "“What the d––l, then, am I fighting for?” he inquired.",
        "“For TEXAS.”",
        "“Texas be d––d; but hurrah for General Jackson!” and with this\nexclamation he threw himself back again upon his wooden pillow, and was\nsoon snoring in a profound slumber.",
        "Making a platform composed of sticks of wood upon the soft mud, I\nstripped myself to the skin, wringing the water from each garment as I\nproceeded. I then commenced drying them by the fire in the order that\nthey were replaced upon my body, an employment that occupied me until\ndaylight, which sign, above the high mountain to the east, down which\nwe had rolled rather than marched yesterday, I was truly rejoiced to\nsee. Distance 3 miles.",
        "December 26.–Parties were detailed early this morning, and\ndespatched up the mountain to bring down the cannon, and collect the\nliving horses and baggage. The destruction of horse-flesh, by those who\nwitnessed the scene by daylight, is described as frightful. In some\nplaces large numbers of dead horses were piled together. In others,\nhorses half buried in the mud of the ravines, or among the rocks, were\ngasping in the agonies of death. The number of dead animals is\nvariously estimated at from seventy-five to one hundred and fifty, by\ndifferent persons. The cannon, most of the missing baggage, and the\nliving horses, were all brought in by noon. The day was busily employed\nin cleansing our rifles and pistols, and drying our drenched baggage.",
        "December 27.–Preparations were commenced early for the resumption of\nour march; but such was the condition of everything around us, that it\nwas two o’clock, P.M., before the battalion was in readiness; and then\nso great had been the loss of horses in various ways, that the number\nremaining was insufficient to mount the men. One or two companies, and\nportions of others, were compelled to march on foot. We were visited\nduring the forenoon by Mr. Sparks, an American, Dr. Den, an Irishman,\nand Mr. Burton, another American, residents of Santa Barbara. They had\nbeen suffered by the Californians to remain in the place. Their\ninformation communicated to us was, that the town was deserted of\nnearly all its population. A few houses only were occupied. Passing\ndown a beautiful and fertile undulating plain, we encamped just before\nsunset in a live-oak grove, about half a mile from the town of Santa\nBarbara. Strict orders were issued by Col. Fremont, that the property\nand the persons of Californians, not found in arms, should be sacredly\nrespected. To prevent all collisions, no soldier was allowed to pass\nthe lines of the camp without special permission, or orders from his\nofficers.",
        "I visited the town before dark, but found the houses, with few\nexceptions, closed, and the streets deserted. After hunting about some\ntime, we discovered a miserable dwelling, occupied by a shoemaker and\nhis family, open. Entering it, we were very kindly received by its\noccupants, who, with a princely supply of civility, possessed but a\nbeggarly array of comforts. At our request they provided for us a\nsupper of tortillas, frijoles, and stewed carne seasoned with\nchile colorado, for which, paying them dos pesos for four, we bade\nthem good evening, all parties being well satisfied. The family\nconsisted, exclusive of the shoemaker, of a dozen women and children,\nof all ages. The women, from the accounts they had received of the\nintentions of the Americans, were evidently unprepared for civil\ntreatment from them. They expected to be dealt with in a very barbarous\nmanner, in all respects; but they were disappointed, and invited us\nto visit them again. Distance 8 miles.",

        "The battalion remained encamped at Santa Barbara, from the 27th of\nDecember to the 3rd of January, 1847. The U.S. flag was raised in the\npublic square of the town the day after our arrival.",
        "The town of Santa Barbara is beautifully situated for the picturesque,\nabout one mile from the shore of a roadstead, which affords anchorage\nfor vessels of any size, and a landing for boats in calm weather.\nDuring stormy weather, or the prevalence of strong winds from the\nsouth-east, vessels, for safety, are compelled to stand out to sea. A\nfertile plain extends some twenty or thirty miles up and down the\ncoast, varying in breadth from two to ten miles, and bounded on the\neast by a range of high mountains. The population of the town I should\njudge, from the number of houses, to be about 1200 souls. Most of the\nhouses are constructed of adobes, in the usual architectural style of\nMexican buildings. Some of them, however, are more Americanized, and\nhave some pretensions to tasteful architecture, and comfortable and\nconvenient interior arrangement. Its commerce, I presume, is limited to\nthe export of hides and tallow produced upon the surrounding plain; and\nthe commodities received in exchange for these from the traders on the\ncoast. Doubtless, new and yet undeveloped sources of wealth will be\ndiscovered hereafter that will render this town of much greater\nimportance than it is at present.",
        "On the coast, a few miles above Santa Barbara, there are, I have been\ntold, immense quantities of pure bitumen or mineral tar, which, rising\nin the ocean, has been thrown upon the shore by the waves, where in a\nconcrete state, like resin, it has accumulated in inexhaustible masses.\nThere are, doubtless, many valuable minerals in the neighbouring\nmountains, which, when developed by enterprise, will add greatly to the\nwealth and importance of the town. For intelligence, refinement, and\ncivilization, the population, it is said, will compare advantageously\nwith any in California. Some old and influential Spanish families are\nresidents of this place; but their casas, with the exception of that\nof Senor Don José Noriega, the largest house in the place, are now\nclosed and deserted. Senor N. is one of the oldest and most respectable\ncitizens of California, having filled the highest offices in the\ngovernment of the country. One of his daughters is a resident of New\nYork, having married Alfred Robinson, Esq., of that city, author of\n\"Life in California.”",
        "The climate, judging from the indications while we remained here, must\nbe delightful, even in winter. With the exception of one day, which was\ntempestuous, the temperature at night did not fall below 50°, and\nduring the day the average was between 60° and 70°. The atmosphere was\nperfectly clear and serene, the weather resembling that of the pleasant\ndays of April in the same latitude on the Atlantic side of the\ncontinent. It is a peculiarity of the Mexicans that they allow no shade\nor ornamental trees to grow near their houses. In none of the streets\nof the towns or missions through which I have passed has there been a\nsolitary tree standing. I noticed very few horticultural attempts in\nSanta Barbara. At the mission, about two miles distant, which is an\nextensive establishment and in good preservation, I was told that there\nwere fine gardens, producing most of the varieties of fruits of the\ntropical and temperate climates.",
        "Several Californians came into camp and offered to deliver themselves\nup. They were permitted to go at large. They represented that the\nCalifornian force at the south was daily growing weaker from\ndissensions and desertions. The United States prize-schooner Julia\narrived on the 30th, from which was landed a cannon for the use of the\nbattalion. It has, however, to be mounted on wheels, and the gear\nnecessary for hauling it has to be made in the camp. Reports were\ncurrent in camp on the 31st, that the Californians intended to meet and\nfight us at San Buenaventura, about thirty miles distant. On the 1st of\nJanuary, the Indians of the mission and town celebrated new-year’s day,\nby a procession, music, etc., etc. They marched from the mission to the\ntown, and through most of the empty and otherwise silent streets. Among\nthe airs they played was “Yankee Doodle.”",
        "January 3.–A beautiful spring-like day. We resumed our march at 11\no’clock, and encamped in a live-oak grove about ten miles south of\nSanta-Barbara. Our route has been generally near the shore of the\nocean. Timber is abundant, and the grass and other vegetation\nluxuriant. Distance 10 miles.",
        "January 4.–At the “Rincon,” or passage between two points of land\njutting into the ocean, so narrow that at high tides the surf dashes\nagainst the neatly perpendicular bases of the mountains which bound the\nshore, it has been supposed the hostile Californians would make a\nstand, the position being so advantageous to them. The road, if road it\ncan be called, where all marks of hoofs or wheels are erased by each\nsucceeding tide, runs along a hard sand-beach, with occasional\nprojections of small points of level ground, ten or fifteen miles, and\nthe surf, even when the tide has fallen considerably, frequently\nreaches to the bellies of the horses. Some demonstration has been\nconfidently expected here, but we encamped in this pass the first day\nwithout meeting an enemy or seeing a sign of one. Our camp is close to\nthe ocean, and the roar of the surf, as it dashes against the shore, is\nlike that of an immense cataract. Hundreds of the grampus whale are\nsporting a mile or two distant from the land, spouting up water and\nspray to a great height, in columns resembling steam from the\nescape-pipes of steam-boats. Distance 6 miles.",
        "January 5.–The prize-schooner Julia was lying off in sight this\nmorning, for the purpose of co-operating with us, should there be any\nattempt on the part of the enemy to interrupt the march of the\nbattalion. We reached the mission of San Buenaventura, and encamped a\nshort distance from it at two o’clock. Soon after, a small party of\nCalifornians exhibited themselves on an elevation just beyond the\nmission. The battalion was immediately called to arms, and marched out\nto meet them. But, after the discharge of the two field-pieces, they\nscampered away like a flock of antelopes, and the battalion returned to\ncamp, with none killed or wounded on either side. Under the belief that\nthere was a larger force of Californians encamped at a distance of some\nfive or six miles, and that during the night they might attempt a\nsurprise, or plant cannon on the summit of a hill about a mile from\ncamp, so as to annoy us, a party, of which I was one, was detached,\nafter dark, to occupy the hill secretly. We marched around the mission\nas privately as possible, and took our position on the hill, where we\nremained all night without the least disturbance, except by the\ntempestuous wind, which blew a blast so cold and piercing as almost to\ncongeal the blood. When the sun rose in the morning, I could see, far\nout in the ocean, three vessels scudding before the gale like phantom\nships. One of these was the little schooner that had been waiting upon\nus while marching along the “Rincon.” Distance 14 miles.",
        "January 6.–The wind has blown a gale in our faces all day, and the\nclouds of dust have been almost blinding. The mission of San\nBuenaventura does not differ, in its general features, from those of\nother establishments of the same kind heretofore described. There is a\nlarge garden, inclosed by a high wall, attached to the mission, in\nwhich I noticed a great variety of fruit-trees and ornamental\nshrubbery. There are also numerous inclosures, for cultivation, by\nwillow hedges. The soil, when properly tilled, appears to be highly\nproductive. This mission is situated about two miles from the shore of\na small bay or indentation of the coast, on the edge of a plain or\nvalley watered by the Rio Santa Clara, which empties into the Pacific\nat this point. A chain of small islands, from ten to twenty miles from\nthe shore, commences at Santa Barbara, and extends south along the\ncoast, to the bay of San Pedro. These islands present to the eye a\nbarren appearance. At present the only inhabitants of the mission are a\nfew Indians, the white population having abandoned it on our approach,\nwith the exception of one man, who met us yesterday and surrendered\nhimself a prisoner.",
        "Proceeding up the valley about seven miles from the mission, we\ndiscovered at a distance a party of sixty or seventy mounted\nCalifornians, drawn up in order on the bank of the river. This, it was\nconjectured, might be only a portion of a much larger force stationed\nhere, and concealed in a deep ravine which runs across the valley, or\nin the canadas of the hills on our left. Scouting-parties mounted the\nhills, for the purpose of ascertaining if such was the case. In the\nmean time, the party of Californians on our right scattered themselves\nover the plain, prancing their horses, waving their swords, banners,\nand lances, and performing a great variety of equestrian feats. They\nwere mounted on fine horses, and there are no better horsemen, if as\ngood, in the world, than Californians. They took especial care,\nhowever, to keep beyond the reach of cannon-shot. The battalion wheeled\nto the left for the purpose of crossing a point of hills jutting into\nthe plain, and taking the supposed concealed party of the enemy on\ntheir flank. It was, however, found impracticable to cross the hills\nwith the cannon; and, returning to the plain, the march was continued,\nthe Californians still prancing and performing their antics in our\nfaces. Our horses were so poor and feeble that it was impossible to\nchase them with any hope of success. As we proceeded, they retreated.\nSome of the Indian scouts, among whom were a Delaware named Tom, who\ndistinguished himself in the engagement near San Juan, and a\nCalifornian Indian named Gregorio, rode towards them; and two or three\nguns were discharged on both sides, but without any damage, the parties\nnot being within dangerous gun-shot distance of each other. The\nCalifornians then formed themselves in a body, and soon disappeared\nbehind some hills on our right. We encamped about four o’clock in the\nvalley, the wind blowing almost a hurricane, and the dust flying so as\nnearly to blind us. Distance 9 miles.",
        "January 7.–Continuing our march up the valley, we encamped near the\nrancho of Carrillo, where we found an abundance of corn, wheat, and\nfrijoles. The house was shut up, having been deserted by its\nproprietor, who is said to be connected with the rebellion. Californian\nscouts were seen occasionally to-day on the summits of the hills south\nof us. Distance 7 miles.",
        "January 8.–Another tempestuous day. I do not remember ever to have\nexperienced such disagreeable effects from the wind and the clouds of\ndust in which we were constantly enveloped, driving into our faces\nwithout intermission. We encamped this afternoon in a grove of willows\nnear a rancho, where, as yesterday, we found corn and beans in\nabundance. Our horses, consequently, fare well, and we fare better than\nwe have done. One-fourth of the battalion, exclusive of the regular\nguard, is kept under arms during the night, to be prepared against\nsurprises and night-attacks. Distance 12 miles.",
        "January 9.–Early this morning Captain Hamley, accompanied by a\nCalifornian as a guide, came into camp, with despatches from Commodore\nStockton. The exact purport of these despatches I never learned, but it\nwas understood that the commodore, in conjunction with General Kearny,\nwas marching upon Los Angeles, and that, if they had not already\nreached and taken that town (the present capital of California), they\nwere by this time in its neighbourhood. Captain Hamley passed, last\nnight, the encampment of a party of Californians in our rear. He landed\nfrom a vessel at Santa Barbara, and from thence followed us to this\nplace by land. We encamped this afternoon at a rancho, situated on the\nedge of a fertile and finely watered plain of considerable extent,\nwhere we found corn, wheat, and frijoles in great abundance. The rancho\nwas owned and occupied by an aged Californian, of commanding and\nrespectable appearance; I could not but feel compassion for the\nvenerable old man, whose sons were now all absent and engaged in the\nwar, while he, at home and unsupported, was suffering the unavoidable\ninconveniences and calamities resulting from an army being quartered\nupon him.",
        "As we march south there appears to be a larger supply of wheat, maize,\nbeans, and barley in the granaries of the ranchos. More attention is\nevidently given to the cultivation of the soil here than farther north,\nalthough neither the soil nor climate is so well adapted to the raising\nof crops. The Californian spies have shown themselves at various times\nto-day, on the summits of the hills on our right. Distance 12 miles.",
        "January 10.–Crossing the plain, we encamped, about two o’clock P.M.,\nin the mouth of a canada, through which we ascend over a difficult\npass in a range of elevated hills between us and the plain of San\nFernando, or Couenga. Some forty or fifty mounted Californians\nexhibited themselves on the summit of the pass during the afternoon.\nThey were doubtless a portion of the same party that we met several\ndays ago, just below San Buenaventura. A large number of cattle were\ncollected in the plain and corralled, to be driven along to-morrow for\nsubsistence. Distance 10 miles.",
        "January 11.–The battalion this morning was divided into two parties;\nthe main body, on foot, marching over a ridge of hills to the right of\nthe road or trail; and the artillery, horses and baggage, with an\nadvance-guard and escort, marching by the direct route. We found the\npass narrow, and easily to be defended by brave and determined men\nagainst a greatly superior force; but when we had mounted the summit of\nthe ridge there was no enemy, nor the sign of one, in sight. Descending\ninto a canada on the other side, we halted until the main body came\nup to us, and then the whole force was again reunited, and the march\ncontinued.",
        "Emerging from the hills, the advance party to which I was attached met\ntwo Californians, bareheaded, riding in great haste. They stated that\nthey were from the mission of San Fernando; that the Californian forces\nhad met the American forces under the command of General Kearny and\nCommodore Stockton, and had been defeated after two days’ fighting; and\nthat the Americans had yesterday marched into Los Angeles. They\nrequested to be conducted immediately to Colonel Fremont, which request\nwas complied with. A little farther on we met a Frenchman, who stated\nthat he was the bearer of a letter from General Kearny, at Los Angeles,\nto Colonel Fremont. He confirmed the statement we had just heard, and\nwas permitted to pass. Continuing our march, we entered the mission of\nSan Fernando at one o’clock, and in about two hours the main body\narrived, and the whole battalion encamped in the mission buildings.",
        "The buildings and gardens belonging to this mission are in better\ncondition than those of any of these establishments I have seen. There\nare two extensive gardens, surrounded by high walls; and a stroll\nthrough them afforded a most delightful contrast from the usually\nuncultivated landscape we have been travelling through for so long a\ntime. Here were brought together most of the fruits and many of the\nplants of the temperate and tropical climates. Although not the season\nof flowers, still the roses were in bloom. Oranges, lemons, figs, and\nolives hung upon the trees, and the blood-red tuna, or prickly-pear,\nlooked very tempting. Among the plants I noticed the American aloe\n(argave Americana), which is otherwise called maguey. From this\nplant, when it attains maturity, a saccharine liquor is extracted,\nwhich is manufactured into a beverage called pulque, and is much\nprized by Mexicans. The season of grapes has passed, but there are\nextensive vineyards at this mission. I drank, soon after my arrival, a\nglass of red wine manufactured here, of a good quality.",
        "The mission of San Fernando is situated at the head of an extensive and\nvery fertile plain, judging from the luxuriance of the grass and other\nvegetation now springing up. I noticed in the granary from which our\nhorses were supplied with food many thousand bushels of corn. The ear\nis smaller than that of the corn of the Southern States. It resembles\nthe maize cultivated in the Northern States, the kernel being hard and\npolished. Large herds of cattle and sheep were grazing upon the plain\nin sight of the mission.",
        "January 12.–This morning two Californian officers, accompanied by\nTortaria Pico, who marched with us from San Luis Obispo, came to the\nmission to treat for peace. A consultation was held and terms were\nsuggested, and, as I understand, partly agreed upon, but not concluded.\nThe officers left in the afternoon.",
        "January 13.–We continued our march, and encamped near a deserted\nrancho at the foot of Couenga plain. Soon after we halted, the\nCalifornian peace-commissioners appeared, and the terms of peace and\ncapitulation were finally agreed upon and signed by the respective\nparties. They were as follows:–",
        "  Made and entered into at the Ranch of Couenga, this thirteenth day\n  of January, eighteen hundred and forty-seven, between P.B. Reading,\n  major; Louis McLane, junr., commanding 3rd Artillery; William H.\n  Russell, ordnance officer–commissioners appointed by J.C. Fremont,\n  Colonel United States Army, and Military Commandant of California;\n  and José Antonio Carillo, commandant esquadron; Augustin Olivera,\n  deputado–commissioners appointed by Don Andres Pico,\n  Commander-in-chief of the Californian forces under the Mexican flag.",
        "  Article 1st. The Commissioners on the part of the Californians agree\n  that their entire force shall, on presentation of themselves to\n  Lieutenant-Colonel Fremont, deliver up their artillery and public\n  arms, and that they shall return peaceably to their homes,\n  conforming to the laws and regulations of the United States, and not\n  again take up arms during the war between the United States and\n  Mexico, but will assist and aid in placing the country in a state of\n  peace and tranquillity.",
        "  Art. 2nd. The Commissioners on the part of Lieutenant-Colonel\n  Fremont agree and bind themselves, on the fulfilment of the 1st\n  Article by the Californians, that they shall be guaranteed\n  protection of life and property, whether on parole or otherwise.",
        "  Article 3rd. That until a Treaty of Peace be made and signed between\n  the United States of North America and the Republic of Mexico, no\n  Californian or other Mexican citizen shall be bound to take the oath\n  of allegiance.",
        "  Article 4th. That any Californian or citizen of Mexico, desiring, is\n  permitted by this capitulation to leave the country without let or\n  hinderance.",
        "  Article 5th. That, in virtue of the aforesaid articles, equal rights\n  and privileges are vouchsafed to every citizen of California, as are\n  enjoyed by the citizens of the United States of North America.",
        "  Article 6th. All officers, citizens, foreigners or others, shall\n  receive the protection guaranteed by the 2nd Article.",

Nor can I\nspeak as to the number of Californians who were in the field under the\ncommand of Andres Pico when the articles of capitulation were signed,\nfor they were never in sight of us after we reached San Fernando.\nDistance 12 miles.",
        "January 14.–It commenced raining heavily this morning. Crossing a\nridge of hills, we entered the magnificent undulating plain surrounding\nthe city of Angels, now verdant with a carpet of fresh vegetation.\nAmong other plants I noticed the mustard, and an immense quantity of\nthe common pepper-grass of our gardens. We passed several warm springs\nwhich throw up large quantities of bitumen or mineral tar. Urging our\njaded animals through the mud and water, which in places was very deep,\nwe reached the town about 3 o’clock.",
        "A more miserably clad, wretchedly provided, and unprepossessing\nmilitary host, probably never entered a civilized city. In all, except\nour order, deportment, and arms, we might have been mistaken for a\nprocession of tatterdemalions, or a tribe of Nomades from Tartary.\nThere were not many of us so fortunate as to have in our possession an\nentire outside garment; and several were without hats or shoes, or a\ncomplete covering to their bodies. But that we had at last reached the\nterminus of a long and laborious march, attended with hardships,\nexposure, and privation rarely suffered, was a matter of such heartfelt\ncongratulation, that these comparatively trifling inconveniences were\nnot thought of. Men never, probably, in the entire history of military\ntransactions, bore these privations with more fortitude or uttered\nfewer complaints.",
        "We had now arrived at the abode of the celestials, if the\ninterpretation of the name of the place could be considered as\nindicative of the character of its population, and drenched with rain\nand plastered with mud, we entered the “City of the Angels,” and\nmarched through its principal street to our temporary quarters. We\nfound the town, as we expected, in the possession of the United States\nnaval and military forces under the command of Commodore Stockton and\nGeneral Kearny, who, after two engagements with six hundred mounted\nCalifornians on the 8th and 9th, had marched into the city on the 10th.\nThe town was almost entirely deserted by its inhabitants, and most of\nthe houses, except those belonging to foreigners, or occupied as\nquarters for the troops, were closed. I met here many of the naval\nofficers whose agreeable acquaintance I had made at San Francisco.\nAmong others were Lieutenants Thompson, Hunter, Gray and Rhenshaw, and\nCaptain Zeilin of the marines, all of whom had marched from San Diego.\nDistance 12 miles.",

        "La Ciudad de los Angeles is the largest town in California, containing\nbetween fifteen hundred and two thousand inhabitants. Its streets are\nlaid out without any regard to regularity. The buildings are generally\nconstructed of adobes one and two stories high, with flat roofs. The\npublic buildings are a church, quartel, and government house. Some of\nthe dwelling-houses are frames, and large. Few of them, interiorly or\nexteriorly, have any pretensions to architectural taste, finish, or\nconvenience of plan and arrangement. The town is situated about 20 miles\nfrom the ocean, in a extensive undulating plain, bounded on the north\nby a ridge of elevated hills, on the east by high mountains whose\nsummits are now covered with snow, on the west by the ocean, and\nstretching to the south and the south-east as far as the eye can reach.\nThe Rio St. Gabriel flows near the town. This stream is skirted with\nnumerous vineyards and gardens, inclosed by willow-hedges. The gardens\nproduce a great variety of tropical fruits and plants. The yield of the\nvineyards is very abundant; and a large quantity of wines of a good\nquality and flavour, and aguardiénte, are manufactured here. Some of\nthe vineyards, I understand, contain as many as twenty thousand vines.\nThe produce of the vine in California will, undoubtedly, in a short\ntime form an important item, in its exports and commerce. The soil and\nclimate, especially of the southern portion of the country, appear to\nbe peculiarly adapted to the culture of the grape.",
        "We found in Los Angeles an abundance of maize, wheat, and frijoles,\nshowing that the surrounding country is highly productive of these\nimportant articles of subsistence. There are no mills, however, in this\nvicinity, the universal practice of Californian families being to grind\ntheir corn by hand; and consequently flour and bread are very scarce,\nand not to be obtained in any considerable quantities. The only garden\nvegetables which I saw while here were onions, potatoes, and chile\ncolorado, or red pepper, which enters very largely into the cuisineof the country. I do not doubt, however, that every description of\ngarden vegetables can be produced here, in perfection and abundance.",
        "While I remained at Los Angeles, I boarded with two or three other\nofficers at the house of a Mexican Californian, the late alcalde of the\ntown, whose political functions had ceased. He was a thin, delicate,\namiable, and very polite gentleman, treating us with much courtesy, for\nwhich we paid him, when his bill was presented, a very liberal\ncompensation. In the morning we were served, on a common deal table,\nwith a cup of coffee and a plate of tortillas. At eleven o’clock, a\nmore substantial meal was provided, consisting of stewed beef, seasoned\nwith chile colorado, a rib of roasted beef, and a plate of frijoleswith tortillas, and a bottle of native wine. Our supper was a second\nedition of the eleven o’clock entertainment.",
        "The town being abandoned by most of its population, and especially by\nthe better class of the female portion of it, those who remained, which\nI saw, could not, without injustice, be considered as fair specimens of\nthe angels, which are reputed here to inhabit. I did not happen to\nsee one beautiful or even comely-looking woman in the place; but, as\nthe fair descendants of Eve at Los Angeles have an exalted reputation\nfor personal charms, doubtless the reason of the invisibility of the\nexamples of feminine attractions, so far-famed and so much looked for\nby the sojourner, is to be ascribed to their “unavoidable absence,” on\naccount of the dangers and casualties of war. At this time, of course,\neverything in regard to society, as it usually exists here, is in a\nstate of confusion and disorganization, and no correct conclusions in\nreference to it can be drawn from observation under such circumstances.",
        "The bay of San Pedro, about twenty-five miles south of Los Angeles, is\nthe port of the town. The bay affords a good anchorage for vessels of\nany size; but it is not a safe harbour at all times, as I have been\ninformed by experienced nautical men on this coast. San Gabriel River\nempties into the bay. The mission of San Gabriel is about twelve miles\neast of Los Angeles. It is represented as an extensive establishment of\nthis kind, the lands surrounding and belonging to it being highly\nfertile. The mission of San Luis Rey is situated to the south, about\nmidway between Los Angeles and San Diego. This mission, according to\nthe descriptions which I have received of it, is more substantial and\ntasteful in its construction than any other in the country; and the\ngardens and grounds belonging to it are now in a high state of\ncultivation.",
        "San Diego is the most southern town in Upper California. It is situated\non the Bay of San Diego, in latitude 33° north. The country back of it\nis described by those who have travelled through it as sandy and arid,\nand incapable of supporting any considerable population. There are,\nhowever, it is reported on authority regarded as reliable, rich mines\nof quicksilver, copper, gold, and coal, in the neighbourhood, which, if\nsuch be the fact, will before long render the place one of considerable\nimportance. The harbour, next to that of San Francisco, is the best on\nthe Pacific coast of North America, between the Straits of Fuca and\nAcapulco.",
        "For the following interesting account of Lower California I am indebted\nto Rodman M. Price, Esq., purser of the U.S. sloop-of-war Cyane, who\nhas been connected with most of the important events which have\nrecently taken place in Upper and Lower California, and whose\nobservations and opinions are valuable and reliable. It will be seen\nthat the observations of Mr. Price differ materially from the generally\nreceived opinions in reference to Lower California.",
        "“Burlington, N.J., June 7, 1848.",
        "“Dear Sir,–It affords me pleasure to give you all the information I\nhave about Lower California, derived from personal observation at\nseveral of its ports that I have visited, in the U.S. ship Cyane, in\n1846-47.",
        "“Cape St. Lucas, the southern extremity of the peninsula of Lower\nCalifornia, is in lat. 22° 45’ N., has a bay that affords a good\nharbour and anchorage, perfectly safe nine months in the year; but it\nis open to the eastward, and the hurricanes which sometimes occur\nduring July, August, and September, blow the strongest from the\nsoutheast, so that vessels will not venture in the bay during the\nhurricane season. I have landed twice at the Cape in a small boat, and\nI think a breakwater can be built, at small cost, so as to make a safe\nharbour at all seasons. Stone can be obtained with great ease from\nthree cones of rocks rising from the sea, and forming the extreme\nsoutherly point of the Cape, called the Frayles. Looking to the future\ntrade and commerce of the Pacific Ocean, this great headland must\nbecome a most important point as a dépôt for coal and merchandise, and\na most convenient location for vessels trading on that coast to get\ntheir supplies. Mr. Ritchie, now residing there, supplies a large\nnumber of whale-ships that cruise off the Cape, annually, with fresh\nprovisions, fruits, and water. The supplies are drawn from the valley\nof San José twenty miles north of the Cape, as the land in its\nimmediate vicinity is mountainous and sterile; but the valley of San\nJosé is extensive and well cultivated, producing the greatest variety\nof vegetables and fruits. The sweet and Irish potato, tomato, cabbage,\nlettuce, beans, peas, beets, and carrots are the vegetables; oranges,\nlemons, bananas, plantains, figs, dates, grapes, pomegranates, and\nolives are its fruits. Good beef and mutton are cheap. A large amount\nof sugar-cane is grown, from which is made panoche, a favourite sugar\nwith the natives; it is the syrup from the cane boiled down, and run\ninto cakes of a pound weight, and in appearance is like our\nmaple-sugar.",
        "“Panoche, cheese, olives, raisins, dried figs, and dates, put up in\nceroons of hide, with the great staples of the Californians–hides\nand tallow–make the export of San José, which is carried to San Blas\nand Mazatlan, on the opposite coast. This commerce the presence of the\nCyane interrupted, finding and capturing in the Bay of La Paz, just\nafter the receipt of the news of war on that coast in September, 1846,\nsixteen small craft, laid up during the stormy season, engaged in this\ntrade.",
        "“I cannot dismiss the valley of San José, from which the crew of the\nCyane have drawn so many luxuries, without alluding to the\nnever-failing stream of excellent water that runs through it (to which\nit owes its productiveness) and empties into the Gulf here, and is\neasily obtained for shipping when the surf is low. It is now frequented\nby some of our whale ships, and European vessels bound to Mazatlan with\ncargoes usually stop here to get instructions from their consignees\nbefore appearing off the port; but vessels do not anchor during the\nthree hurricane months. The view from seaward, up this valley, is\nbeautiful indeed, being surrounded by high barren mountains, which is\nthe general appearance of the whole peninsula, and gives the impression\nthat the whole country is without soil, and unproductive. When your eye\ngets a view of this beautiful, fertile, cultivated, rich, green valley,\nproducing all the fruits and vegetables of the earth, Lower California\nstock rises. To one that has been at sea for months, on salt grub, the\nsight of this bright spot of cultivated acres, with the turkeys, ducks,\nchickens, eggs, vegetables, and fruit, makes him believe the country an\nEldorado. Following up the coast on the Gulf side, after passing Cape\nPolmo, good anchorage is found between the peninsula and the island of\nCerralbo. Immediately to the north of this island is the entrance to\nthe great and beautiful bay of La Paz. It has two entrances, one to the\nnorth and one to the south of the island of Espiritu Santo. The\nnorthern one is the boldest and safest for all craft drawing over\ntwelve feet. The town of La Paz is at the bottom or south side of the\nbay, about twenty miles from the mouth. The bay is a large and\nbeautiful sheet of water. The harbour of Pichelinque, of perfect\nmill-pond stillness, is formed inside of this bay. The Cyane lay at\nthis quiet anchorage several days.",
        "“Pearl-fishing is the chief employment of the inhabitants about the\nbay, and the pearls are said to be of superior quality. I was shown a\nnecklace, valued at two thousand dollars, taken in this water. They are\nall found by diving. The Yake Indians are the best divers, going down\nin eight-fathom water. The pearl shells are sent to China, and are\nworth, at La Paz, one dollar and a half the arroba, or twenty-five\npounds. Why it is a submarine diving apparatus has not been employed in\nthis fishery, with all its advantages over Indian diving, I cannot say.\nYankee enterprise has not yet reached this new world. I cannot say this\neither, as a countryman of ours, Mr. Davis, living at Loretta, has been\na most successful pearl-fisher, employing more Indians than any one\nelse engaged in the business. I am sorry to add that he has suffered\ngreatly by the war. The country about La Paz is a good grazing country,\nbut very dry. The mountains in the vicinity are said to be very rich in\nminerals. Some silver mines near San Antonio, about forty miles south,\nare worked, and produce well. La Paz may export one hundred thousand\ndollars a-year of platapina. Gold-dust and virgin gold are brought to\nLa Paz. The copper and lead mines are numerous and rich. To the north\nof La Paz are numerous safe and good harbours. Escondida, Loretta, and\nMuleje are all good harbours, formed by the islands in front of the\nmain land.",
        "“The island of Carmen, lying in front of Loretta, has a large salt\nlake, which has a solid salt surface of several feet thickness. The\nsalt is of good quality, is cut out like ice, and it could supply the\nworld. It has heretofore been a monopoly to the governor of Lower\nCalifornia, who employed convicts to get out the salt and put it on the\nbeach ready for shipping. It is carried about a quarter of a mile, and\nis sent to Mazatlan and San Blas. A large quantity of salt is used in\nproducing silver. To the north of Muleje, which is nearly opposite\nGuymas, the gulf is so much narrower that it is a harbour itself. No\naccurate survey has ever been made of it–indeed, all the peninsula, as\nwell as the coast of Upper California, is laid down wrong on the\ncharts, being about twelve miles too far easterly. The English\nGovernment now have two naval ships engaged in surveying the Gulf of\nCalifornia.",
        "“On the Pacific coast of the peninsula there is the great Bay of\nMagdalena, which has fine harbours, but no water, provisions, or\ninhabitants. Its shores are high barren mountains, said to possess\ngreat mineral wealth. A fleet of whale-ships have been there during the\nwinter months of the last two years, for a new species of whale that\nare found there, represented as rather a small whale, producing forty\nor fifty barrels of oil; and, what is most singular, I was assured, by\nmost respectable whaling captains, that the oil is a good paint-oil (an\nentire new quality for fish-oil). Geographically and commercially,\nLower California must become very valuable. It will be a constant\nsource of regret to this country, that it is not included in the treaty\nof peace just made with Mexico. We have held and governed it during the\nwar, and the boundary of Upper California cuts the head of the Gulf of\nCalifornia, so that Lower California is left entirely disconnected with\nthe Mexican territory.",
        "“Cape St. Lucas is the great headland of the Pacific Ocean, and is\ndestined to be the Gibraltar and entrepot of that coast, or perhaps La\nPaz may be preferred, on account of its superior harbour. As a\npossession to any foreign power, I think Lower California more valuable\nthan the group of the Sandwich Islands. It has as many arable acres as\nthat group of islands, with rich mines, pearl-fishing, fine bays and\nharbours, with equal health, and all their productions. As a country,\nit is dry, mountainous, and sterile, yet possessing many fine valleys\nlike San José, as the old mission establishments indicate. I have heard\nTodas Santos, Commondee, Santa Guadalupe, and others, spoken of as\nbeing more extensive, and as productive as San José.",

        "In the vicinity of Los Angeles there are a number of warm springs which\nthrow out and deposit large quantities of bitumen or mineral tar. This\nsubstance, when it cools, becomes hard and brittle like resin. Around\nsome of these springs many acres of ground are covered with this\ndeposit to the depth of several feet. It is a principal material in the\nroofing of houses. When thrown upon the fire, it ignites immediately,\nemitting a smoke like that from turpentine, and an odour like that from\nbituminous coal. This mineral, so abundant in California, may one day\nbecome a valuable article of commerce.",
        "There are no reliable statistics in California. The traveller is\nobliged to form his estimate of matters and things chiefly from his own\nobservation. You can place but little reliance upon information derived\nfrom the population, even when they choose to answer your questions;\nand most generally the response to your inquiries is–”Quien sabe?“\n(who knows?) No Californian troubles his brains about these matters.\nThe quantity of wines and aguardiénte produced by the vineyards and\ndistilleries, at and near Los Angeles, must be considerable–basing my\nestimate upon the statement of Mr. Wolfskill, an American gentleman\nresiding here, and whose house and vineyard I visited. Mr. W.’s\nvineyard is young, and covers about forty acres of ground, the number\nof vines being 4,000 or 5,000. From the produce of these, he told me,\nthat last year he made 180 casks of wine, and the same quantity of\naguardiénte. A cask here is sixteen gallons. When the vines mature,\ntheir produce will be greatly increased. Mr. W.’s vineyard is doubtless\na model of its kind. It was a delightful recreation to stroll through\nit, and among the tropical fruit-trees bordering its walks. His house,\ntoo, exhibited an air of cleanliness and comfort, and a convenience of\narrangement not often met with in this country. He set out for our\nrefreshment three or four specimens of his wines, some of which would\ncompare favourably with the best French and Madeira wines. The\naguardiénte and peach-brandy, which I tasted, of his manufacture,\nbeing mellowed by age, were of an excellent flavour. The quantity of\nwine and aguardiénte produced in California, I would suppose,\namounted to 100,000 casks of sixteen gallons, or 1,600,000 gallons.\nThis quantity by culture can be increased indefinitely.",
        "It was not possible to obtain at Los Angeles a piece of woollen cloth\nsufficiently large for a pair of pantaloons, or a pair of shoes, which\nwould last a week. I succeeded, after searching through all the shops\nof the town, in procuring some black cotton velvet, for four yards of\nwhich I paid the sum of 12 dollars. In the United States the same\narticle would probably have cost 1.50 dollar. For four dollars more I\nsucceeded in getting the pantaloons made up by an American tailor, who\ncame into the country with General Kearny’s forces. A Rocky Mountain\ntrapper and trader (Mr. Goodyear), who has established himself near the\nSalt Lake since I passed there last year, fortunately arrived at Los\nAngeles, bringing with him a quantity of dressed deer and elk skins,\nwhich were purchased for clothing for the nearly naked soldiers.",
        "Among the houses I visited while here, was that of Mr. Pryor, an\nAmerican, and a native of Louisville, Ky. He has been a resident of the\ncountry between twenty and thirty years, but his Kentucky manners,\nfrankness, and hospitality still adhere to him.",
        "I remained at Los Angeles from the 14th to the 29th of January. During\nthis time, with the exception of three days, the weather and\ntemperature were pleasant. It rained one day, and during two days the\nwinds blew strong and cold from the north-west. The nights are cool,\nbut fires are not requisite to comfort. The snow-clad mountains, about\ntwenty-five or thirty miles to the east of us, contrast singularly with\nthe brilliant fresh verdure of the plain.",
        "On the 18th of January General Kearny, with the dragoons, left for San\nDiego. There was understood to be a difference between General Kearny\nand Commodore Stockton, and General Kearny and Colonel Fremont, in\nregard to their respective powers and duties; which, as the whole\nsubject has subsequently undergone a thorough investigation, and the\nresult made public, it is unnecessary for me to allude to more\nparticularly. I did not converse with General Kearny while he was at\nLos Angeles, and consequently possessed no other knowledge of his views\nand intentions, or of the powers with which he had been invested by the\nPresident, than what I derived from report.",
        "On the 19th, Commodore Stockton and suite, with a small escort, left\nfor San Diego. Soon after his departure the battalion was paraded, and\nthe appointment of Colonel Fremont as governor of California, and\nColonel W.H. Russell, as secretary of state, by Commodore Stockton, was\nread to them by Colonel Russell. It was announced, also, that, although\nColonel Fremont had accepted the office of chief civil magistrate of\nCalifornia, he would still retain his military office, and command the\nbattalion as heretofore.",
        "Commodore Shubrick, however, arrived at Monterey on the 23rd of\nJanuary, in the U.S. ship Independence, and, ranking above Commodore\nStockton, assumed the chief command, as appears by the date of a\ngeneral order published at Monterey, and written on board the United\nStates ship Independence, on February 1st, thanking the volunteers for\ntheir services, and announcing the restoration of order. For I should\nstate that an insurrection, headed by Don Francisco Sanchez, had broken\nout in the upper portion of California some time towards the last of\nDecember, which had been put down by a detachment of marines and\nvolunteers. The insurgents had committed some outrages, and among other\nacts had taken prisoner Lieutenant W.A. Bartlett, acting Alcalde of San\nFrancisco, with some other Americans. An account of the suppression of\nthis affair I find in the “Californian” newspaper of February 6th, 1847,\nfrom which it appears, “that a party of one hundred and one men,\ncommanded by Captain Ward Marston, of the United States marines,\nmarched from San Francisco on the 29th December in search of the enemy,\nwhom they discovered on the 2nd of January, about one hundred in\nnumber, on the plains of Santa Clara, under the command of Francisco\nSanchez. An attack was immediately ordered. The enemy was forced to\nretire, which they were able to do in safety, after some resistance, in\nconsequence of their superior horses. The affair lasted about an hour,\nduring which time we had one marine slightly wounded in the head, one\nvolunteer of Captain Weber’s command in the leg; and the enemy had one\nhorse killed, and some of their forces supposed to be killed or\nwounded. In the evening the enemy sent in a flag of truce, with a\ncommunication, requesting an interview with the commanding officer of\nthe expedition the next day, which was granted, when an armistice was\nentered into, preparatory to a settlement of the difficulties. On the\n3rd, the expedition was reinforced by the mounted Monterey volunteers,\nfifty-five men, under the command of Captain W.A.T. Maddox, and on the\n7th, by the arrival of Lieutenant Grayson with fifteen men, attached to\nCaptain Maddox’s company. On the 8th a treaty was concluded, by which\nthe enemy surrendered Lieutenant Bartlett, and the other prisoners, as\nwell as all their arms, including one small field-piece, their\nammunition and accoutrements, and were permitted to return peaceably to\ntheir homes, and the expedition to their respective posts.”",
        "A list of the expedition which marched from San Francisco is given as\nfollows:–Captain Ward Marston, commandant; Assistant-surgeon J. Duval,\naide-de-camp. A detachment of United States marines, under command of\nLieutenant Tansil, thirty-four men; artillery, consisting of one\nfield-piece, under the charge of Master William F. De Iongh, assisted\nby Mid. John M. Kell, ten men; Interpreter John Pray; mounted company\nof San José volunteers, under command of Captain C.M. Weber, Lieutenant\nJohn Murphy, and acting Lieutenant John Reed, thirty-three men; mounted\ncompany of Yerba Buena volunteers, under command of Captain William M.\nSmith, Lieutenant John Rose, with a small detachment under Captain J.\nMartin, twelve men.",
        "Thus ended the insurrections, if resistance against invasion can\nproperly be so called, in Upper California.",
        "On the 20th January, the force of sailors and marines which had marched\nwith Commodore Stockton and General Kearny left Los Angeles, to embark\nat San Pedro for San Diego. On the 21st a national salute was fired by\nthe artillery company belonging to the battalion, in honour of Governor\nFremont. On the 22nd, letters were received from San Diego, stating\nthat Colonel Cooke, who followed General Kearny from Santa Fé with a\nforce of four hundred Mormon volunteers, had reached the neighbourhood\nof that place. Having applied for my discharge from the battalion as\nsoon as we reached Los Angeles, I received it on the 29th, on which\nday, in company with Captain Hastings, I set out on my return to San\nFrancisco, designing to leave that place on the first favourable\nopportunity for the United States.",

        "We left Los Angeles late in the afternoon of the 29th of January, with\ntwo Indian vaqueros, on miserable broken-down horses (the best we could\nobtain), and encamped at the deserted rancho at the foot of Couenga\nplain, where the treaty of peace had been concluded. After we had been\nhere some time, two Indians came to the house, who had been sent by the\nproprietor of the rancho to herd the cattle. Having nothing to eat with\nus, a tempting offer prevailed upon the Indians to milk one of the\ncows; and we made our supper and our breakfast next morning on milk.\nBoth of our Indian vaqueros deserted in the night, carrying with them\nsundry articles of clothing placed in their charge. A few days have\nmade a great change in the appearance of the country. The fresh grass\nis now several inches in height, and many flowers are in bloom. The sky\nis bright, and the temperature is delightful.",
        "On the 30th of January, leaving the mission of San Fernando on our\nright, at a distance of eight or ten miles, we followed the usually\ntravelled trail next to the hills, on the western side of the plain. As\nwe were passing near a rancho, a well-dressed Californian rode out to\nus, and, after examining the horses of our miserable caballada,\npolitely claimed one of them as his property. He was told that the\nhorse was drawn from the public caballada, at Los Angeles, and could\nnot be given up. This seemed to satisfy him. After some further\nconversation, he informed us, that he was Don Andres Pico, the late\nleader and general of the Californians. The expression of his\ncountenance is intelligent and prepossessing, and his address and\nmanners courteous and pleasing. Shaking hands, and bidding us a very\nearnest adios, he put spurs to his horse and galloped away.",
        "We were soon after overtaken by a young Californian, who appeared at\nfirst rather doubtful whether or not he should make our acquaintance.\nThe ice being broken, however, he became very loquacious and\ncommunicative. He stated that he was returning to his home near Santa\nBarbara, from the wars, in which he had been engaged against his will.\nThe language that he used was, that he, with many others of his\nacquaintances, were forced to take up arms by the leading men of the\ncountry. He was in the two battles of the 8th and 9th of January, below\nLos Angeles; and he desired never to be in any more battles. He was\nheartily rejoiced that there was peace, and hoped that there would\nnever be any more wars. He travelled along with us until afternoon,\nwhen he fell behind, and we did not see him again until the next day.",
        "After passing two or three deserted houses, we reached an inhabited\nrancho, situated at the extremity of a valley, and near a narrow gorge\nin the hills, about four o’clock, and, our jaded animals performing\nduty with reluctance, we determined to halt for the night, if the\nprospect of obtaining anything to eat (of which we stood in much need)\nwas flattering. Riding up to the house, a small adobe, with one room,\nand a shed for a kitchen, the ranchero and the ranchera came out\nand greeted us with a hearty ’Buenas tardes, Senores, paisanos\namigos,” shaking hands, and inviting us at the same time to alight and\nremain for the night, which invitation we accepted. The kind-hearted\nranchera immediately set about preparing supper for us. An Indian\nmuchacha was seated at the metate (hand-mill), which is one of the\nmost important articles of the Californian culinary apparatus. While\nthe muchacha ground, or rather crushed, the wheat between the stones,\nthe ranchera, with a platter-shaped basket, cleansed it of dust,\nchaff, and all impure particles, by tossing the grain in the basket.\nThe flour being manufactured and sifted through a cedazo, or coarse\nsieve, the labour of kneading the dough was performed by the\nmuchacha. An iron plate was then placed over a rudely-constructed\nfurnace, and the dough, being beaten by hand into tortillas (thin\ncakes), was baked upon this. What would American housewives say to such\na system as this? The viands being prepared, they were set out upon a\nsmall table, at which we were invited to seat ourselves. The meal\nconsisted of tortillas, stewed jerk beef, with chile seasoning,\nmilk, and quesadillas, or cheesecakes, green and tough as leather.\nHowever, our appetites were excellent, and we enjoyed the repast with a\nhigh relish.",
        "Our host and hostess were very inquisitive in regard to the news from\nbelow, and as to what would be the effects of the conquest of the\ncountry by the Americans. The man stated that he and all his family had\nrefused to join in the late insurrection. We told them that all was\npeaceable now; that there would be no more wars in California; that we\nwere all Americans, all Californians–hermanos, hermanas, amigos.\nThey expressed their delight at this information by numerous\nexclamations.",
        "We asked the woman how much the dress which she wore, a miserable\ncalico, cost her? She answered, “Seis pesos” (six dollars). When we\ntold her that in a short time, under the American government, she could\npurchase as good a one ’por un peso,” she threw up her hands in\nastonishment, expressing by her features at the same time the most\nunbounded delight. Her entire wardrobe was soon brought forth, and the\nprice paid for every article named. She then inquired what would be the\ncost of similar clothing under the American government, which we told\nher. As we replied, exclamation followed upon exclamation, expressive\nof her surprise and pleasure, and the whole was concluded with ’Viva\nlos Americanos–viva los Americanos!” I wore a large coarse woollen\npea-jacket, which the man was very desirous to obtain, offering for it\na fine horse. I declined the trade.",
        "In the evening several of the brothers, sisters, and brothers and\nsisters-in-law of the family collected, and the guitar and violin,\nwhich were suspended from a beam in the house, were taken down, and we\nwere entertained by a concert of instrumental and vocal music. Most of\nthe tunes were such as are performed at fandangos. Some plaintive airs\nwere played and sung with much pathos and expression, the whole party\njoining in the choruses. Although invited to occupy the only room in\nthe house, we declined it, and spread our blankets on the outside.",
        "The next morning (January 31st), when we woke, the sun was shining\nbright and warm, and the birds were singing gayly in the grove of\nevergreen oaks near the house. Having made ready to resume our journey,\nas delicately as possible we offered our kind hostess compensation for\nthe trouble we had given her, which she declined, saying, that although\nthey were not rich, they nevertheless had enough and to spare. We\nhowever insisted, and she finally accepted, with the condition that we\nwould also accept of some of her quesadillas and tortillas to carry\nalong with us. The ranchero mounted his horse and rode with us about\nthree or four miles, to place us on the right trail, when, after\ninviting us very earnestly to call and see him again, and bidding us an\naffectionate adios, he galloped away.",
        "Travelling over a hilly country, and passing the ruins of several\ndeserted ranchos, the grounds surrounding which were strewn with the\nbones of slaughtered cattle, we reached, about five o’clock P.M., a\ncluster of houses in the valley of Santa Clara River, ten miles east of\nthe mission of San Buenaventura. Here we stopped at the house of a man\nnamed Sanchez. Our arrival was thought to be worthy of notice, and it\nwas accordingly celebrated in the evening by a fandango given at one of\nthe houses, to which we were invited. The company, to the number of\nsome thirty or forty persons, young and old, were assembled in the\nlargest room of the house, the floor being hard clay. The only\nfurniture contained in the room was a bed and some benches, upon which\nthe company seated themselves when not engaged in dancing.",
        "Among the senoritas assembled were two daughters of an American named\nChapman, who has been a resident of the country for many years. They\nwere fair-skinned, and might be called handsome. An elder and married\nsister was also present. They called themselves Americans, although\nthey did not speak our language, and seemed to be more proud of their\nAmerican than their Spanish blood.",
        "A singular custom prevails at these fandangos. It is this: during the\nintervals between the waltzes, quadrilles, and other dances, when the\ncompany is seated, a young lady takes the floor solus, and, after\nshowing off her graces for general observation a few minutes, she\napproaches any gentleman she may select, and performs a variety of\npirouettes and other Terpsichorean movements before him for his\nespecial amusement and admiration, until he places on her head his hat\nor cap, as the case may be, when she dances away with it. The hat or\ncap has afterwards to be redeemed by some present, and this usually is\nin money. Not dancing ourselves, we were favoured with numerous special\nexhibitions of this kind, the cost of each of which was un peso. With\na long journey before us, and with purses in a nearly collapsed\ncondition, the drafts upon us became so frequent, that at an early\nhour, under a plea of fatigue and want of rest, we thought it prudent\nto beat a retreat, leaving our fair and partial fandangueras to\nbestow their favours upon others better able to bear them. The motions\nof the Californian females of all classes in the dance are highly\ngraceful. The waltz is their favourite measure, and in this they appear\nto excel as much as the men do in horsemanship. During the progress of\nthe dance, the males and females improvise doggerel rhymes\ncomplimentary of the personal beauties and graces of those whom they\nadmire, or expressive of their love and devotion, which are chanted\nwith the music of the instruments, and the whole company join in the\ngeneral chorus at the end of each verse. The din of voices is sometimes\nalmost deafening.",
        "Our host accompanied us to our lodgings on the opposite side of the\nway. Beds were spread down under the small porch outside, and we laid\nour bodies upon them, but not to sleep, for the noise of the fandango\ndancers kept us awake until broad daylight, at which time it broke up.",
        "Hiring fresh horses here, and a vaquero to drive our tired animals\nafter us, we started about 9 o’clock in the morning, and, passing\nthrough San Buenaventura, reached Santa Barbara, 45 miles, a little\nafter two in the afternoon. We stopped at the house of Mr. Sparks, who\nreceived us with genuine hospitality. Santa Barbara presented a more\nlively appearance than when we passed here on our way down, most of its\npopulation having returned to their homes. Procuring fresh but\nmiserably poor horses, we resumed our journey on the afternoon of the\n2nd of February, and encamped at the rancho of Dr. Deu, situated on the\nplain of Santa Barbara, near the sea shore. The soil of this plain is\nof the most fertile composition. The fresh grass is now six or eight\ninches high, and the varieties are numerous. Many of the early flowers\nare in bloom. I noticed a large wheat field near the house, and its\nappearance was such as to promise a rich harvest.",
        "The rain fell heavily on the morning of the 3rd, but continuing our\njourney we crossed the St. Ynes Mountain, and, passing the mission by\nthat name, reached the rancho of Mr. Faxon after dark, where we halted\nfor the night. Around the mission of St. Ynes I noticed, as we passed,\nimmense quantities of cattle bones thickly strewn in all directions.\nAcres of ground were white with these remains of the immense herds\nbelonging to this mission in the days of its prosperity, slaughtered\nfor their hides and tallow. We met two or three elegantly dressed\nCalifornians to-day, who accosted us with much civility and apparent\nfriendliness.",
        "Mr. Faxon is an Englishman by birth, and has resided in California\nabout thirty years. He is married to a Californian lady, and has a\nfamily of interesting and beautiful children. A large portion of the\nland belonging to his rancho is admirably adapted to agriculture, and\nhe raises crops of corn and vegetables as well as wheat without\nirrigation. He informed me that the yield of wheat on his rancho was\nfully seventy bushels to the acre. Mr. F. showed me specimens of lead\nore from which he moulds his bullets, taken from an inexhaustible mine\nin the Tular Valley, some fifty miles distant from this. It is\ncertainly the richest ore that I have ever seen, appearing almost like\nthe pure metal. He also showed me a caustic alkali, produced by burning\na plant or shrub which grows in great abundance in the Tular Valley.\nThis substance is used by him in the manufacture of soap.",
        "About noon on the 4th, we halted at the rancho of Captain Dana, where\nwe procured fresh horses, leaving our wretchedly lean and tired\nanimals, and, proceeding on, stopped for the night at the rancho of Mr.\nBranch, an intelligent American, originally from the state of New York,\nwho has been settled in the country a number of years. His rancho is\nsituated on what is called the arroyo grande, a small stream which\nempties into the Pacific some two or three miles from the house. The\nhouse is new, and constructed after American models of farm-houses,\nwith neat and comfortable apartments, chimneys and fireplaces. The\narable lands here are finely adapted to the culture of maize, wheat,\nand potatoes.",
        "Our horses straying, it was twelve o’clock on the 5th before we found\nthem. The rain had fallen steadily and heavily all night, and during\nthe forenoon, and was pouring down when we started. We passed through\nthe mission of San Luis Obispo just before sunset, intending to halt at\na rancho about three miles distant in a canada. But, the storm\nincreasing in strength, it became suddenly so dark in the\nmountain-gorge, that we could not distinguish the trail, and, after\nwandering about some time, vainly attempting to find the house, we were\ncompelled to bivouac, wet to our skins, without fire or shelter, and\nthe rain pouring down in torrents.",
        "The next morning (Feb. 6.), in hunting up our loose horses, we\ndiscovered the house about half a mile distant from our camp.\nContinuing our journey, we halted about nine o’clock at a rancho near\nthe ruins of Santa Margarita. A solitary Indian was the only occupant\nof the house, and only inhabitant of the place; and he could furnish us\nwith no food. Passing two or three other deserted ranches, we reached\nthe house of a Mexican about one o’clock, where we obtained a meal of\nfried eggs and tortillas, after having been without food thirty\nhours. Late in the afternoon we arrived at the mission of San Miguel,\nnow occupied by an Englishman named Reed, his mestiza wife, and one\nchild, with two or three Indian vaqueros. Crossing the Salinas in the\nmorning (Feb. 7), we continued down its eastern side, and encamped in a\nwide bottom under a large live oak. A quesadilla was all we had to\neat. This was divided, one-half being reserved for breakfast. The fresh\nvegetation has so much changed the face of the country on this river\nsince we passed along here in December, that I scarcely recognise it.\nThe grass is six or eight inches high in the bottom, the blades\nstanding so thick as to present a matted appearance, and the hills are\nbrilliant with flowers–pink, purple, blue, and yellow.",
        "On the 8th we continued down the eastern bank of the Salinas, passing\nthrough several large and fertile bottoms, and reaching the rancho of\nSan Lorenzo about twelve o’clock. This rancho, as we learned from the\nproprietors, is owned by two bachelor brothers, one of whom told me\nthat he had not been off his lands but once or twice for several years.\nLarge herds of fat cattle and horses were grazing upon the luxuriant\ngrasses of the plain, and there were several extensive inclosures sowed\nin wheat, which presented all the indications of an abundant harvest.\nBut, with all these natural resources surrounding him the elder brother\ntold us that he had nothing to eat in his house but fresh beef. A\nquantity of the choice pieces of a fat beef was roasted by an Indian\nboy, which we enjoyed with all the relish of hungry men. Our host, a\ngentleman of intelligence and politeness, made apology after apology\nfor his rude style of living, a principal excuse being that he had no\nwife. He inquired, with apparent earnestness, if we could not send him\ntwo pretty accomplished and capable American women, whom they could\nmarry; and then they would build a fine house, have bread, butter,\ncheese, and all the delicacies, luxuries, and elegancies of life in\nabundance. He appeared to be well pleased with the conquest of the\ncountry by the Americans, and desirous that they should not give it up.\nWhen we resumed our journey in the afternoon, he rode with us four or\nfive miles to show us the way, and, on taking his leave, invited us to\nreturn again, when he said he hoped his accommodations would be much\nimproved. Riding 15 miles, we halted at a tule-cabin, where we remained\nuntil two o’clock in the morning, when, the moon shining brightly, we\nmounted our horses, and continued our journey.",
        "We reached the Monterey road just at daylight. My intention had been to\nvisit Monterey; but the Salinas being unfordable, and there being no\nferry, it was not possible to do it without swimming the river, which I\ndid not feel inclined to do. Monterey is situated on the bay by that\nname, about 90 miles by water south of San Francisco. The bay affords a\ngood anchorage and landing in calm weather, being exposed only to the\nnorthers, which blow violently. The town contains about 1500\ninhabitants, and is rapidly increasing in wealth and population.\nArriving at the rancho of Don Joaquin Gomez, we found no one but a\nmestiza servant at home, and could obtain nothing to eat but a\nquesadilla. All the streams, large and small, are much swollen by\nlate heavy rains, and the travelling is consequently very laborious and\ndifficult. Resting our horses a short time, we crossed the mountains,\nand reached the mission of San Juan Bautista about noon.",
        "At San Juan we met with Messrs. Grayson, Boggs, and a party of\nvolunteers returning from Monterey to San Francisco, having been\ndischarged since the suppression of the rebellion in this part of\nCalifornia, headed by Francisco Sanchez. Here we learned, for the first\ntime, the arrival at Monterey of Commodore Shubrick in the ship\nIndependence, and of the Lexington with Captain Tomkins’s company of\nartillery, and freighted otherwise with munitions, stores, and tools\nnecessary to the erection and defence of durable fortifications at\nMonterey and San Francisco.",
        "Seven or eight miles beyond San Juan, we found that the waters of the\narroyo had risen so as to inundate a wide valley which we were\ncompelled to cross. After making several ineffectual attempts to reach\nthe opposite side, wading through the water, and sometimes falling into\ndeep holes from which it was difficult for either men or horses to\nextricate themselves, we encamped for the night on a small elevation in\nthe valley, entirely surrounded by water. Our condition was miserable\nenough. Tired, wet, and hungry, we laid down for the night on the damp\nground.",
        "The next day (Feb. 10), about eleven o’clock, we succeeded in finding a\nford across the valley and stream, and procured dinner at a\nsoap-factory on the opposite side, belonging to T.O. Larkin, Esq.\nContinuing on, we encamped at a rancho occupied by an Englishman as\nmayor domo. He was very glad to see us, and treated us with unbounded\nhospitality, furnishing a superabundance of beef and frijoles for our\nconsumption. On the 11th, about three P.M., we arrived at the Pueblo de\nSan José, and, finding there a launch employed by Messrs. Howard and\nMellus in collecting hides, bound for San Francisco, we embarked in\nher, and on the morning of the 13th arrived at that place. We found\nlying here the U.S. sloop Warren, and Lieutenant Radford politely\nfurnished us with a boat to land. In the afternoon the Cyane, Commander\nDupont, with Gen. Kearny on board, and the store-ship Erie, with Col.\nMason on board, arrived in the harbour. Col. Mason is from the United\nStates direct, via Panama, and brings late and interesting\nintelligence.",
        "The Cyane and Warren have just returned from a cruise on the southern\nPacific coast of Mexico. The town of Guymas had been taken by\nbombardment. The Cyane had captured, during her cruize, fourteen\nprizes, besides several guns at San Blas. The boats of the Warren,\nunder the command of Lieut. Radford, performed the gallant feat of\ncutting out of the harbour of Mazatlan the Mexican schooner Malek\nAbdel.",
        "Landing in San Francisco, I found my wardrobe, which I had deposited in\nthe care of Capt. Leidesdorff, and the first time for nearly five\nmonths dressed myself in a civilized costume. Having been during that\ntime almost constantly in motion, and exposed to many hardships and\nprivations, it was, as may be supposed, no small satisfaction to find\nonce more a place where I could repose for a short time at least.",

        "Wherever the Anglo-Saxon race plant themselves, progress is certain to\nbe displayed in some form or other. Such is their “go-ahead” energy,\nthat things cannot stand still where they are, whatever may be the\ncircumstances surrounding them. Notwithstanding the wars and\ninsurrections, I found the town of San Francisco, on my arrival here,\nvisibly improved. An American population had flowed into it; lots,\nwhich heretofore have been considered almost valueless, were selling at\nhigh prices; new houses had been built, and were in progress; new\ncommercial houses had been established; hotels had been opened for the\naccommodation of the travelling and business public; and the\npublication of a newspaper had been commenced. The little village of\ntwo hundred souls, when I arrived here in September last, is fast\nbecoming a town of importance. Ships freighted with full cargoes are\nentering the port, and landing their merchandise to be disposed of at\nwholesale and retail on shore, instead of the former mode of vending\nthem afloat in the harbour. There is a prevailing air of activity,\nenterprise, and energy; and men, in view of the advantageous position\nof the town for commerce, are making large calculations upon the\nfuture; calculations which I believe will be fully realized.",
        "On the 15th I dined on board the sloop-of-war Cyane, with Commander\nDupont, to whom I had the good fortune to be the bearer from home of a\nletter of introduction. I say “good fortune,” because I conceive it to\nbe one of the greatest of social blessings, as well as pleasures, to be\nmade acquainted with a truly upright and honourable man–one whose\nintegrity never bends to wrongful or pusillanimous expediency;–one\nwho, armed intellectually with the panoply of justice, has courage to\nsustain it under any and all circumstances;–one whose ambition is, in\na public capacity, to serve his country, and not to serve himself;–one\nwho waits for his country to judge of his acts, and, if worthy, to\nplace the laurel wreath upon his head, disdaining a self-wrought and\nself-assumed coronal. Capt. Dupont is a native of Delaware; and that\ngallant and patriotic state should feel proud of such a son. He is one\nof whom all men, on sea or on land, with whom his duties as an officer\nor citizen of our republic brings him in contact, speak well; and whose\nprivate virtues, as well as professional merits, are deserving of the\nwarmest admiration and the highest honours.",
        "Although I have long known Gen. S.W. Kearny from reputation, and saw\nhim at Los Angeles, I was here introduced to him for the first time.\nGen. K. is a man rising fifty years of age. His height is about five\nfeet ten or eleven inches. His figure is all that is required by\nsymmetry. His features are regular, almost Grecian; his eye is blue,\nand has an eagle-like expression, when excited by stern or angry\nemotion; but, in ordinary social intercourse, the whole expression of\nhis countenance is mild and pleasing, and his manners and conversation\nare unaffected, urbane, and conciliatory, without the slightest\nexhibition of vanity or egotism. He appears the cool, brave, and\nenergetic soldier; the strict disciplinarian, without tyranny; the man,\nin short, determined to perform his duty, in whatever situation he may\nbe placed, leaving consequences to follow in their natural course.\nThese, my first impressions, were fully confirmed by subsequent\nintercourse, in situations and under circumstances which, by\nexperience, I have found an unfailing alembic for the trial of\ncharacter–a crucible wherein, if the metal be impure, the drossy\nsubstances are sure to display themselves. It is not my province to\nextol or pronounce judgment upon his acts; they are a part of the\nmilitary and civil history of our country, and as such will be\napplauded or condemned, according to the estimate that may be placed\nupon them. But I may be allowed to express the opinion, that no man,\nplaced under the same circumstances, ever aimed to perform his duty\nwith more uprightness and more fidelity to the interests and honour of\nhis country, or who, to shed lustre upon his country, ever braved\ngreater dangers, or endured more hardships and privations, and all\nwithout vaunting his performances and sacrifices.",
        "On the 16th, in company of Gen. Kearny, Capt. Turner, and Lieuts.\nWarner and Hallock, of the U.S. Engineer Corps, I rode to the Presidio\nof San Francisco, and the old fortification at the mouth of the bay.\nThe presidio is about three miles from the town, and consists of\nseveral blocks of adobe buildings, covered with files. The walls of\nmost of the buildings are crumbling for the want of care in protecting\nthem from the annual rains; and without this care they will soon become\nheaps of mud. The fort is erected upon a commanding position, about a\nmile and a half from the entrance to the bay. Its walls are\nsubstantially constructed of burnt brick, and are of sufficient\nthickness and strength to resist heavy battering. There are nine or ten\nembrasures. Like everything else in the country belonging to the\npublic, the fort is fast falling into ruins. There has been no garrison\nhere for several years; the guns are dismounted, and half decomposed by\nlong exposure to the weather, and from want of care. Some of them have\nsunk into the ground.",
        "On the 20th I was waited upon by Gen. Kearny, and requested to accept\nthe office of alcalde, or chief magistrate, of the district of San\nFrancisco. There being no opportunity of returning to the United States\nimmediately, I accepted of the proposed appointment, and on the 22d was\nsworn into office, my predecessor, Lieut. W.A. Bartlett, of the navy,\nbeing ordered to his ship by the commanding officer of the squadron.",
        "The annual salute in celebration of the birthday of the immortal and\nillustrious founder of our republic, required by law from all the ships\nof the navy in commission, in whatever part of the world they may be at\nthe time, strikes us more forcibly when in a far-off country, as being\na beautiful and appropriate tribute to the unapproachable virtues and\nheroism of that great benefactor of the human race, than when we are\nnearer home, or upon our own soil. The U.S. ships in the harbour, at\ntwelve o’clock on the 22d, each fired a national salute; and the day\nbeing calm and beautiful, the reports bounded from hill to hill, and\nwere echoed and re-echoed until the sound died away, apparently in the\ndistant gorges of the Sierra Nevada. This was a voice from the soul of\nWASHINGTON, speaking in majestic and thunder-tones to the green and\nflowery valley, the gentle hills and lofty mountains of California, and\nconsecrating them as the future abode of millions upon millions of the\nsons of liberty. The merchant and whale ships lying at anchor, catching\nthe enthusiasm, joined in the salute; and for a time the harbour and\nbay in front of the town were enveloped in clouds of gunpowder smoke.",
        "General Kearny left San Francisco, in the frigate Savannah, Captain\nMervine, on the 23d, for Monterey, and soon after his arrival at that\nplace issued the following proclamation:–",
        "  The President of the United States having instructed the undersigned\n  to take charge of the civil government of California, he enters upon\n  his duties with an ardent desire to promote, as far as he is able,\n  the interests of the country and the welfare of its inhabitants.",
        "  The undersigned has instructions from the President to respect and\n  protect the religious institutions of California, and to see that\n  the religious rights of the people are in the amplest manner\n  preserved to them, the constitution of the United States allowing\n  every man to worship his Creator in such a manner as his own\n  conscience may dictate to him.",
        "  The undersigned is also instructed to protect the persons and\n  property of the quiet and peaceable inhabitants of the country\n  against all or any of their enemies, whether from abroad or at home;\n  and when he now assures the Californians that it will be his duty\n  and his pleasure to comply with those instructions, he calls upon\n  them all to exert themselves in preserving order and tranquillity,\n  in promoting harmony and concord, and in maintaining the authority\n  and efficiency of the laws.",
        "  It is the wish and design of the United States to provide for\n  California, with the least possible delay, a free government,\n  similar to those in her other territories; and the people will soon\n  be called upon to exercise their rights as freemen, in electing\n  their own representatives, to make such laws as may be deemed best\n  for their interest and welfare. But until this can be done, the laws\n  now in existence, and not in conflict with the constitution of the\n  United States, will be continued until changed by competent\n  authority; and those persons who hold office will continue in the\n  same for the present, provided they swear to support that\n  constitution, and to faithfully perform their duty.",
        "  The undersigned hereby absolves all the inhabitants of California\n  from any further allegiance to the republic of Mexico, and will\n  consider them as citizens of the United States; those who remain\n  quiet and peaceable will be respected in their rights and protected\n  in them. Should any take up arms against or oppose the government of\n  this territory, or instigate others to do so, they will be\n  considered as enemies, and treated accordingly.",
        "  When Mexico forced a war upon the United States, time did not permit\n  the latter to invite the Californians as friends to join her\n  standard, but compelled her to take possession of the country to\n  prevent any European power from seizing upon it, and, in doing so,\n  some excesses and unauthorized acts were no doubt committed by\n  persons employed in the service of the United States, by which a few\n  of the inhabitants have met with a loss of property; such losses\n  will be duly investigated, and those entitled to remuneration will\n  receive it.",
        "  California has for many years suffered greatly from domestic\n  troubles; civil wars have been the poisoned fountains which have\n  sent forth trouble and pestilence over her beautiful land. Now those\n  fountains are dried up; the star-spangled banner floats over\n  California, and as long as the sun continues to shine upon her, so\n  long will it float there, over the natives of the land, as well as\n  others who have found a home in her bosom; and under it agriculture\n  must improve, and the arts and sciences flourish, as seed in a rich\n  and fertile soil.",
        "  The Americans and Californians are now but one people; let us\n  cherish one wish, one hope, and let that be for the peace and quiet\n  of our country. Let us, as a band of brothers, unite and emulate\n  each other in our exertions to benefit and improve this our\n  beautiful, and which soon must be our happy and prosperous, home.",

        "  S.W. KEARNY\n  Brig.-Gen., U.S.A., and Governor of California.",
        "The proclamation of General Kearny gave great satisfaction to the\nnative as well as the emigrant population of the country. Several of\nthe alcaldes of the district of my jurisdiction, as well as private\nindividuals (natives of the country), expressed, by letter and orally,\ntheir approbation of the sentiments of the proclamation in the warmest\nterms. They said that they were heartily willing to become Americans\nupon these terms, and hoped that there would be the least possible\ndelay in admitting them to the rights of American citizenship. There\nwas a general expectation among natives as well as foreigners, that a\nrepresentative form of territorial government would be immediately\nestablished by General Kearny. Why this was not done, is explained by\nthe recent publication of General Scott’s letter to General Kearny,\ndated November 3rd, 1846, of which Colonel Mason was the bearer, he\nhaving left the United States on the 7th November. In this letter\nGeneral Scott says:–",
        "“As a guide to the civil governor of Upper California, in our hands,\nsee the letter of June 3rd (last), addressed to you by the Secretary of\nWar. You will not, however, formally declare the province to be\nannexed. Permanent incorporation of the territory must depend on the\ngovernment of the United States.",
        "“After occupying with our forces all necessary points in Upper\nCalifornia, and establishing a temporary civil government therein, as\nwell as assuring yourself of its internal tranquillity, and the absence\nof any danger of reconquest on the part of Mexico, you may charge\nColonel Mason, United States first dragoons, the bearer of this open\nletter, or land officer next in rank to your own, with your several\nduties, and return yourself, with a sufficient escort of troops, to St.\nLouis, Missouri; but the body of the United States dragoons that\naccompanied you to California will remain there until further orders.”",
        "The transport ships Thomas H. Perkins, Loo Choo, Susan Drew, and\nBrutus, with Colonel Stevenson’s regiment, arrived at San Francisco\nduring the months of March and April. These vessels were freighted with\na vast quantity of munitions, stores, tools, saw-mills, grist-mills,\netc., etc., to be employed in the fortification of the principal\nharbours on the coast–San Francisco, Monterey, and San Diego. The\nregiment of Col. Stevenson was separated into different commands,\nportions of it being stationed at San Francisco, Sonoma, Monterey,\nSanta Barbara, and Los Angeles; and some companies employed against the\nhorse-thief Indians of the Sierra Nevada and the Tulares.",
        "As good an account of these horse-thief Indians, and their\ndepredations, as I have seen, I find in the “California Star,” of March\n28th, 1847, written by a gentleman who has been a resident of\nCalifornia for a number of years, and who has been a sufferer. It is\nsubjoined:–",
        "“During the Spanish regime, such a thing as a horse-thief was unknown\nin the country; but as soon as the Mexicans took possession, their\ncharacteristic anarchy began to prevail, and the Indians to desert from\nthe missions. The first Indian horse-thief known in this part of the\ncountry was a neophyte of the mission of Santa Clara, George, who\nflourished about twenty years ago. He absconded from his mission to the\nriver of Stanislaus, of which he was a native. From thence he returned\nto the settlements, and began to steal horses, which at that time were\nvery numerous. After pursuing his depredations for some time, he was at\nlast pursued and killed on his return from one of his forages. The\nmission of Santa Clara has been, from that time to the present day, the\ngreatest nursery for horse thieves, as the Stanislaus river has been\nand is their principal rendezvous. I have taken some pains to inquire\namong some of the most intelligent and respectable of the native\ninhabitants, as to the probable number of horses that have been stolen\nbetween Monterey and San Francisco within the last twenty years, and\nthe result has been that more than one hundred thousand can be\ndistinctly enumerated, and that the total amount would probably be\ndouble that number. Nearly all these horses have been eaten! From the\nriver of Stanislaus, as a central point, the evil has spread to the\nnorth and south, and at present extends from the vicinity of the\nMickélemes River on the north, to the sources of the St. Joaquin on the\nsouth. These Indians inhabit all the western declivity of the great\nsnowy mountains, within these limits, and have become so habituated to\nliving on horseflesh, that it is now with them the principal means of\nsubsistence.",
        "“In past time they have been repeatedly pursued, and many of them\nkilled, and whole villages destroyed, but, so far from being deterred,\nthey are continually becoming more bold and daring in their robberies,\nas horses become scarcer and more carefully guarded. About twenty\npersons have been killed by them within the knowledge of the writer.\nAmong others, Mr. Lindsay and Mr. Wilson were killed by them not long\nago. Only about one month since, they shot and dangerously wounded four\npersons employed on the farm of Mr. Weber, near the Pueblo of St.\nJoseph, and at the same time stole the horses of the farm, and those\nalso from the farms of Captain Fisher and Mr. Burnal, in the same\nvicinity; in all, about two hundred head. Within the last ten days\nnumerous parties of them have been committing depredations on many of\nthe farms in the jurisdiction of the Contra Costa, and scarcely a night\npasses but we hear of their having stolen horses from some one. Three\ndays ago, a party of them were met by some young men who had been out\ncatching wild horses on the plains of the St. Joaquin, but as they were\nmounted on tired animals, they were only able to recapture the stolen\nhorses, but could not overtake the thieves.”",
        "It has not been within the scope of my design, in writing out those\nnotes, to enter into the minute details of the conquest and occupation\nof California by the forces of the United States. To do so would\nrequire more space than I have allowed myself, and the matter would be\nmore voluminous than interesting or important. My intention has been to\ngive such a sketch of the military operations in California, during my\nresidence and travels in the country, as to afford to the reader a\ngeneral and correct idea of the events transpiring at the time. No\nimportant circumstance, I think, has escaped my attention.",
        "Among the officers of the army stationed at San Francisco, with whom I\nbecame acquainted, were Major Hardie, in command of the troops, Captain\nFolsom, acting quartermaster-general in California, and Lieutenant\nWarner, of the engineer corps. Lieutenant Warner marched with General\nKearny from the United States, and was at the battle of San Pasqual. I\nhave seen the coat which he wore on that occasion, pierced in seven\ndifferent places by the lances of the enemy. He did not make this\nexhibition himself; and I never heard him refer to the subject but\nonce, and then it was with the modesty of a veteran campaigner.",
        "The corps of topographical engineers accompanying General Kearny, under\nthe command of Captain Emory, will, doubtless, furnish in their report\nmuch interesting and valuable information. Mr. Stanley, the artist Of\nthe expedition, completed his sketches in oil, at San Francisco; and a\nmore truthful, interesting, and valuable series of paintings,\ndelineating mountain scenery, the floral exhibitions on the route, the\nsavage tribes between Santa Fe and California–combined with camp-life\nand marches through the desert and wilderness–has never been, and\nprobably never will be, exhibited. Mr. Stanley informed me that he was\npreparing a work on the savage tribes of North America and of the\nislands of the Pacific, which, when completed on his plan, will be the\nmost comprehensive and descriptive of the subject of any that has been\npublished.",
        "Legal proceedings are much less complex in California than in the\nUnited States. There is no written statute law in the country. The only\nlaw books I could find were a digested code entitled, “Laws of Spain\nand the Indies,” published in Spain about a hundred years ago, and a\nsmall pamphlet defining the powers of various judicial officers,\nemanating from the Mexican government since the revolution. A late\nMexican governor of California, on being required by a magistrate to\ninstruct him as to the manner in which he should administer the law\nwithin his jurisdiction, replied, ’Administer it in accordance with\nthe principles of natural right and justice,” and this is the\nfoundation of Californian jurisprudence. The local bandos, or laws,\nare enacted, adjudicated, and executed by the local magistrates, or\nalcaldes. The alcalde has jurisdiction in all municipal matters, and in\ncases for minor offences, and for debt in sums not over one hundred\ndollars. In cases of heinous or capital offences, the alcalde has\nsimply an examining power, the testimony being taken down in writing,\nand transmit-to the juez de primera instancia, or first judge of the\ndistrict, before whom the case is tried. Civil actions, for sums over\none hundred dollars, must also be tried before the juez de primera\ninstancia, and from him there is an appeal to the prefect, or the\ngovernor of the province. The trial by hombres buenos, or good men,\nis one of the established legal tribunals when either of the parties\ndemand it, and is similar to our trial by jury; the difference being in\nthe number, the hombres buenos usually consisting of three or five,\nas they may be ordered by the magistrate, or requested by the\nlitigants, and our jury of twelve. With honest and intelligent\nmagistrates, the system operates advantageously, as justice is speedy\nand certain; but the reverse of this, with corrupt and ignorant\nmagistrates, too frequently in power, the consequences of the system\nare as bad as can well be imagined.",
        "The policy of the Mexican government has been to encourage in certain\nlocalities the erection of pueblos, or towns, and for this purpose they\nhave made grants of land to the local authorities, or municipalities,\nwithin certain defined limits, to be regranted upon application, in\nlots of fifty or one hundred varass, as the case may be, to persons\ndeclaring their intention to settle and to do business in the town. For\nthese grants to individuals a certain sum of money is paid, which goes\ninto the treasury of the municipality. The magistrates, however,\nwithout special permission, have no power to grant lots of land within\na certain number of feet of or below high-water mark. The power is\nreserved to be exercised by the governor of the province. It being\nnecessary for the convenient landing of ships, and for the discharging\nand receiving of their cargoes, that the beach in front of the town of\nSan Francisco should be improved with wharfs, etc., etc., and that\ntitles should be granted to individuals who otherwise would make no\ndurable improvements. As magistrate of the town, in compliance with the\nrequest of numerous citizens, I solicited from General Kearny, the\nacting governor, a relinquishment, on the part of the general\ngovernment, of the beach lands in front of the town in favour of the\nmunicipality, under certain conditions. This was granted by the\nGovernor, who issued a decree dated 10th March, permitting the sales by\nauction of all such grounds adjacent to the water-side as might be\nfound adapted to commercial purposes, with the exception of such lots\nas might be selected for the use of the United States government, by\nits proper officers. The sales accordingly took place, the lots were\neagerly purchased, and the port has already become a place of\nconsiderable commercial activity.",

        "It was during the month of November, 1602, the sun just retiring behind\nthe distant high land which forms the background of a spacious harbour\nat the southernmost point of Alta California, that a small fleet of\nvessels might have been seen directing their course as if in search of\na place of anchorage; their light sails drawn up, while the larger\nones, swelling now and then to the action of the breeze, bore them\nmajestically along, forcing their way through the immense and almost\nimpenetrable barrier of sea-weed, to a haven which, at the remote\nperiod stated, was considered the unexplored region of the North. The\nfleet referred to hauled their wind to the shore, and, passing a bluff\npoint of land on their left, soon came to anchor; but not until the\nshades of night had cast a gloom over the scene so recently lighted up\nwith the gorgeous rays of a setting sun.",
        "This was the commencement, or rather preliminary mark, of civilization\nin this country, by the Spaniards, (if so it can be called,) and on the\nfollowing morning a detachment was landed, accompanied by a friar, to\nmake careful investigation of the long ridge of high land which serves\nas a protection to the harbour from the heavy north-west gales. They\nfound, as reported, an abundance of small oak and other trees, together\nwith a great variety of useful and aromatic herbs; and from its summit\nthey beheld the extent and beauty of the port, reaching, as they said,\nfull three leagues from where the vessel lay at anchor. A large tent\nwas erected on the sandy beach, to answer the purposes of a church,\nwhere the friar might perform mass, and by directions of the commanding\nofficers, the boats were drawn up for repairing, wells were dug,\nparties were sent off to cut wood, while guards were placed at\nconvenient distances to give notice of the approach of any hostile\nforce. The latter precaution was hardly carried into effect, ere a\nlarge body of naked Indians were seen moving along the shore, armed\nwith bows and arrows. A friar, protected by six soldiers, was\ndispatched to meet them, who, making signs of peace by exhibiting a\nwhite flag and throwing handfuls of sand high into the air, influenced\nthem to lay aside their arms, when, affectionately embracing them, the\ngood old friar distributed presents of beads and necklaces, with which\nthey eagerly adorned their persons. This manifestation of good feeling\ninduced them to draw near to where the commander had landed with his\nmen, but perceiving so large a number, they retreated to a neighbouring\nknoll, and from thence sent forward to the Spaniards ten aged females,\nwho, possessing apparently so much affability, were presented\nimmediately with gifts, and instructed to go and inform their people of\nthe friendly disposition cherished for them by the white strangers.\nThis was sufficient to implant a free intercourse with the Indians, who\ndaily visited the Spaniards, and bartered off their skins and furs in\nexchange for bread and trinkets. But at length the time arrived for the\nfleet to depart, and they proceeded northward, visiting in their course\nMonterey and Mendocino, where the same favourable result attended the\nenterprise as at other places, and they returned in safety to New\nSpain.",
        "So successful had been the character of this expedition throughout the\nentire period of its execution, that an enthusiasm prevailed in the\nminds of the Spaniards, which could only be assuaged by an attempt to\nconquer and christianize the inhabitants of that distant portion of the\nAmerican continent. Many were the fruitless results of the Spanish\nadventurer–numerous were the statements of his toil and labour, till\nat length a formidable attempt, under the patronage and direction of\nDon Gaspar de Portala and Father Junipero Serra, successfully achieved\nthe desired object for which it was planned and executed.",
        "At San Diego, where, a century and a half before, the primitive\nnavigators under Cortez communed with the rude and unsophisticated\nnative–there, where the zealous devotee erected his altar on the\nburning sand, and with offerings of incense and prayer hallowed it to\nGod, as the birthplace of Christianity in that region–upon that\nsainted spot commenced the spiritual conquest, the cross was erected,\nand the holy missionaries who accompanied the expedition entered heart\nand soul upon their religious duties. Successful in all they undertook,\ntheir first establishment in a short time was completed, and drawing\naround it the converted Indians in large numbers, the rude and\nuncultivated fields gave place to agricultural improvement–the arts\nand sciences gradually obtained foundation where before all was\ndarkness, and day after day hundreds were added to the folds of the\nholy and apostolic church. Thus triumphantly proceeded the labours of\nthe Spanish conquerors! In course of time other institutions were\nfounded at Santa Barbara, Monterey, and San Francisco, where at each\nplace a military fortress was erected, which served for their\nprotection, and to keep in check such of the natives who were\ndisinclined to observe the regulations of the community.",
        "The natives formed an ardent and almost adorable attachment for their\nspiritual fathers, and were happy, quite happy, under their\njurisdiction. Ever ready to obey them, the labour in the field and\nworkshop met with ready compliance, and so prosperous were the\ninstitutions that many of them became wealthy, in the increase of their\ncattle and great abundance of their granaries. It was no unusual sight\nto behold the plains for leagues literally spotted with bullocks, and\nlarge fields of corn and wheat covering acres of ground. This state of\nthings continued until the period when Mexico underwent a change in its\npolitical form of government, which so disheartened the feelings of the\nloyal missionaries, that they became regardless of their\nestablishments, and suffered them to decline for want of attention to\ntheir interests. At length, civil discord and anarchy among the\nCalifornians prepared a more effective measure for their destruction,\nand they were left to the superintendence of individuals who plundered\nthem of all that was desirable or capable of removal. Thus, the\ngovernment commenced the robbery, and its hirelings carried it out to\nthe letter, destroying and laying waste wherever they were placed. In\norder to give the inhabitants a share of the spoils, some of them were\npermitted to slaughter the cattle by contract, which was an equal\ndivision of the proceeds, and the contractors were careful, when they\ndelivered one hide to a mission, to reserve two for themselves, in\nthis way following up the example of their superiors.",
        "This important revolution in the systematic order of the monastic\ninstitutions took place in 1836, at which period the most important of\nthem possessed property, exclusive of their lands and tenements, to the\nvalue of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. At the present day\nthey have but a little more than dilapidated walls and restricted\nboundaries of territory. Notwithstanding this wanton devastation of\nproperty, contrary to the opinion of many who were strongly in favour\nof supporting these religious institutions, the result proved\nbeneficial to the country at large. Individual enterprise succeeded as\nthe lands became distributed, so that the Californian beheld himself no\nlonger dependent on the bounty of his spiritual directors, but, on the\ncontrary, he was enabled to give support to them, from the increase and\nabundance of his own possessions.",
        "Subsequent to the expulsion of the Mexicans, numbers of new farms were\ncreated, and hundreds of Americans were scattered over the country.\nPrevious to 1830, the actual possessions of horned cattle by the\nrancheros did not exceed one hundred thousand; but in 1842, according\nto a fair estimate, made by one on the spot, the number had increased\nto four hundred thousand; so that the aggregate is equal to that held\nby the missions when in their most flourishing condition. The present\nnumber is not much, if any, short of one million.",
        "Presuming a statistical knowledge of this country, before and after the\nmissionary institutions were secularized, may be interesting, I will\ninsert the following returns of 1831 and 1842, to contrast the same\nwith its present condition:–",
        "1st. In 1832 the white population throughout Alta-California did not\nexceed 4,500, while the Indians of the twenty-one missions amounted to\n19,000; in 1842, the former had increased to 7,000, and the latter\ndecreased to about 5,000.",
        "2nd. In the former year, the number of horned cattle, including\nindividual possessions, amounted to 500,000; in the latter, to 40,000.",
        "3rd. At the same period, the number of sheep, goats, and pigs, was\n321,000; at the latter, 32,000.",
        "4th. In 1831 the number of horses, asses, mules, etc., was 64,000; in\n1842 it was 30,000.",
        "5th. The produce in corn, etc., had decreased in a much greater\nproportion–that of seventy to four.",
        "The amount of duties raised at the customhouse in Monterey, from 1839\nto 1842, was as follows, viz.:–",
        "  1839        85,613 dollars.\n  1840        72,308 dollars\n  1841       101,150 dollars\n  1842        73,729 dollars.",
        "The net amount of revenue seldom exceeding in any year eighty thousand\ndollars; so that, when a deficiency took place, to supply the\nexpenditures of government, it had been usual to call upon the missions\nfor aid.",
        "The value of the hides and tallow derived from the annual matanzasmay be estimated at 372,000 dollars. These two commodities, with the\nexception of some beaver, sea-otter, and other furs, comprise the most\nimportant part of the exportations, which in addition, would augment\nthe value of exports to 400,000 dollars.",
        "The permanent population of that portion of Upper California situated\nbetween the Sierra Nevada and the Pacific, I estimate at 25,000. Of\nthis number, 8,000 are Hispano-Americans, 5,000 foreigners, chiefly\nfrom the United States, and 12,000 christianized Indians. There are\nconsiderable numbers of wild or Gentile Indians, inhabiting the valley\nof the San Joaquin and the gorges of the Sierra, not included in this\nestimate. They are probably as numerous as the Christian Indians. The\nIndian population inhabiting the region of the Great Salt Lake, Mary’s\nRiver, the oases of the Great Desert Basin, and the country bordering\nthe Rio Colorado and its tributaries, being spread over a vast extent\nof territory, are scarcely seen, although the aggregate number is\nconsiderable.",
        "The Californians do not differ materially from the Mexicans, from whom\nthey are descended, in other provinces of that country. Physically and\nintellectually, the men, probably, are superior to the same race\nfarther south, and inhabiting the countries contiguous to the city of\nMexico. The intermixture of blood with the Indian and negro races has\nbeen less, although it is very perceptible.",
        "The men, as a general fact, are well made, with pleasing sprightly\ncountenances, and possessing much grace and ease of manners, and\nvivacity of conversation. But hitherto they have had little knowledge\nof the world and of events, beyond what they have heard through Mexico,\nand derived from the supercargoes of merchant-ships and whalemen\ntouching upon the coast. There are no public schools in the country–at\nleast I never heard of one. There are but few books. General Valléjo\nhas a library with many valuable books, and this is the only one I saw,\nalthough there are others; but they are rare, and confined to a few\nfamilies.",
        "The men are almost constantly on horseback, and as horsemen excel any I\nhave seen in other parts of the world. From the nature of their\npursuits and amusements, they have brought horsemanship to a perfection\nchallenging admiration and exciting astonishment. They are trained to\nthe horse and the use of the lasso (riata, as it is here called) from\ntheir infancy. The first act of a child, when he is able to stand\nalone, is to throw his toy lasso around the neck of a kitten; his next\nfeat is performed on the dog; his next upon a goat or calf; and so on,\nuntil he mounts the horse, and demonstrates his skill upon horses and\ncattle. The crowning feat of dexterity with the riata, and of\nhorsemanship, combined with daring courage, is the lassoing of the\ngrisly bear. This feat is performed frequently upon this large and\nferocious animal, but it is sometimes fatal to the performer and his\nhorse. Well drilled, with experienced military leaders, such as would\ninspire them with confidence in their skill and prowess, the\nCalifornians ought to be the finest cavalry in the world. The\nCalifornian saddle is, I venture to assert, the best that has been\ninvented, for the horse and the rider. Seated in one of these, it is\nscarcely possible to be unseated by any ordinary casualty. The\nbridle-bit is clumsily made, but so constructed that the horse is\ncompelled to obey the rider upon the slightest intimation. The spurs\nare of immense size, but they answer to an experienced horseman the\ndouble purpose of exciting the horse, and of maintaining the rider in\nhis seat under difficult circumstances.",
        "For the pleasures of the table they care but little. With his horse and\ntrappings, his sarape and blanket, a piece of beef and a tortilla,\nthe Californian is content, so far as his personal comforts are\nconcerned. But he is ardent in his pursuit of amusement and pleasure,\nand these consist chiefly in the fandango, the game of monte,\nhorse-racing, and bull and bear-baiting. They gamble freely and\ndesperately, but pay their losses with the most strict punctuality, at\nany and every sacrifice, and manifest but little concern about them.\nThey are obedient to their magistrates, and in all disputed cases\ndecided by them, acquiesce without uttering a word of complaint. They\nhave been accused of treachery and insincerity. Whatever may have been\nthe grounds for these accusations in particular instances, I know not;\nbut, judging from my own observation and experience, they are as free\nfrom these qualities as our own people.",
        "While the men are employed in attending to the herds of cattle and\nhorses, and engaged in their other amusements, the women (I speak of\nthe middle classes on the ranchos) superintend and perform most of the\ndrudgery appertaining to housekeeping, and the cultivation of the\ngardens, from whence are drawn such vegetables as are consumed at the\ntable. These are few, consisting of frijoles, potatoes, onions, and\nchiles. The assistants in these labours are the Indian men and women,\nlegally reduced to servitude.",
        "The soil of that portion of California between the Sierra Nevada and\nthe Pacific will compare, in point of fertility, with any that I have\nseen elsewhere. As I have already described such portions of it as have\ncome under my observation, it is unnecessary for me here to descend to\nparticulars. Wheat, barley, and other small grains, with hemp, flax,\nand tobacco, can be produced in all the valleys, without irrigation. To\nproduce maize, potatoes, and other garden vegetables, irrigation is\nnecessary. Oats and mustard grow spontaneously, with such rankness as\nto be considered nuisances upon the soil. I have forced my way through\nthousands of acres of these, higher than my head when mounted on a\nhorse. The oats grow to the summits of the hills, but they are not here\nso tall and rank as in the valleys.",
        "The varieties of grasses are greater than on the Atlantic side of the\ncontinent, and far more nutritious. I have seen seven different kinds\nof clover, several of them in a dry state, depositing a seed upon the\nground so abundant as to cover it, which is lapped up by the cattle and\nhorses and other animals, as corn or oats, when threshed, would be with\nus. All the grasses, and they cover the entire country, are heavily\nseeded, and, when ripe, are as fattening to stock as the grains which\nwe feed to our beef, horses, and hogs. Hence it is unnecessary to the\nsustenance or fattening of stock to raise corn for their consumption.",
        "Agriculture is in its rudest state. The farming implements which have\nbeen used by the Californians, with few exceptions, are the same as\nwere used three hundred years ago, when Mexico was conquered by Cortez.\nA description of them would be tedious. The plough, however, which\nmerely scratches the ground, is the fork of a small tree. It is the\nsame pattern as the Roman plough, two thousand years ago. Other\nagricultural implements are of the same description. The Americans, and\nother foreigners, are, however, introducing the American plough, and\nother American farming tools, the consequence of which has already\nbeen, to some extent, to produce a revolution in agriculture. The crops\nof wheat and barley, which I saw about the 1st of June, while passing\nthrough the country on my journey to the United States, exceeded in\npromise any which I have seen in the United States. It was reported to\nme that Captain Sutter’s crop of wheat, for 1847, would amount to\n75,000 bushels.",
        "The natural vegetable productions of California have been sufficiently\nnoticed in the course of this work, for the reader to form a correct\nestimate of the capabilities of the soil and climate. It is supposed by\nsome, that cotton, sugar, and rice, could be produced here. I do not\ndoubt but there are portions of the country where these crops would\nthrive; but I question whether, generally, they could be cultivated to\nadvantage. Nearly all the fruits of the temperate and tropical climates\nare produced in perfection in California, as has before been stated.",
        "The principal product of the country has been its cattle and horses.\nThe cattle are, I think, the largest and finest I ever saw, and the\nbeef is more delicious. There are immense herds of these, to which I\nhave previously referred; and their hides and tallow, when slaughtered,\nhave hitherto composed the principal exports from the country. If I\nwere to hazard an estimate of the number of hides annually exported, it\nwould be conjectural, and not worth much. I would suppose, however, at\nthis time (1847), that the number would not fall much short of 150,000,\nand a corresponding number of arrobas (25 pounds) of tallow. The\naverage value of cattle is about five dollars per head.",
        "The horses and mules are correspondingly numerous with the cattle; and\nalthough the most of them are used in the country, considerable numbers\nare driven to Sonora, New Mexico, and other southern provinces, and\nsome of them to the United States, for a market. They are smaller than\nAmerican horses, and I do not think them equal for continuous hard\nservice; but on short trips, for riding, their speed and endurance are\nnot often, if ever, equalled by our breed of horses. The value of good\nhorses is from ten to twenty-five dollars; of mares, five dollars. The\nprices have, however, since the Americans came into the country, become\nfluctuating, and the value of both horses and cattle is increasing\nrapidly.",
        "The wild animals of California are the wild-horse, the elk, the\nblack-tailed deer, antelope, grizly bear, all in large numbers. Added\nto these are the beaver, otter, coyote, hare, squirrel, and the usual\nvariety of other small animals. There is not so great a variety of\nsmall birds as I have seen elsewhere. I do not consider that the\ncountry presents strong attractions for the ornithologist. But what is\nwanting in variety is made up in numbers. The bays and indentations on\nthe coast, as well as the rivers and lakes interior, swarm with myriads\nof wild geese, ducks, swans, and other water birds. The geese and ducks\nare a mongrel race, their plumage being variegated, the same as our\nbarn-yard fowls. Some of the islands in the harbour, near San\nFrancisco, are white with the guano deposited by these birds; and\nboat-loads of eggs are taken from them. The pheasant and partridge are\nabundant in the mountains.",
        "In regard to the minerals of California, not much is yet known. It has\nbeen the policy of the owners of land upon which there existed minerals\nto conceal them as much as possible. A reason for this has been, that\nthe law of Mexico is such, that if one man discovers a mine of any kind\nupon another man’s land, and the proprietor does not work it, the\nformer may denounce the mine, and take possession of it, and hold it\nso long as he continues to work it. Hence the proprietors of land upon\nwhich there are valuable mineral ores conceal their existence as much\nas possible. While in California I saw quicksilver, silver, lead, and\niron ores, and the specimens were taken from mines said to be\ninexhaustible. From good authority I learned the existence of gold and\ncopper mines, the metals being combined; and I saw specimens of coal\ntaken from two or three different points, but I do not know what the\nindications were as to quality. Brimstone, saltpetre, muriate and\ncarbonate of soda, and bitumen, are abundant. There is little doubt\nthat California is as rich in minerals of all kinds as any portion of\nMexico.",
        "I have taken much pains to describe to the reader, from day to day, and\nat different points during my travels in California, the temperature\nand weather. It is rarely so cold in the settled portions of California\nas to congeal water. But twice only while here I saw ice, and then not\nthicker than window-glass. I saw no snow resting upon the ground. The\nannual rains commence in November, and continue, with intervals of\npleasant springlike weather, until May. From May to November, usually,\nno rain falls. There are, however, exceptions. Rain sometimes falls in\nAugust. The thermometer, at any season of the year, rarely sinks below\n50° or rises above 80°. In certain positions on the coast, and\nespecially at San Francisco, the winds rise diurnally, and blowing\nfresh upon the shore render the temperature cool in midsummer. In the\nwinter the wind blows from the land, and the temperature at these\npoints is warmer. These local peculiarities of climate are not\ndescriptive of the general climate of the interior.",
        "For salubrity I do not think there is any climate in the world superior\nto that of the coast of California. I was in the country nearly a year,\nexposed much of the time to great hardships and privations, sleeping,\nfor the most part, in the open air, and I never felt while there the\nfirst pang of disease, or the slightest indication of bad health. On\nsome portions of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, where\nvegetation is rank, and decays in the autumn, the malaria produces\nchills and fever, but generally the attacks are slight, and yield\neasily to medicine. The atmosphere is so pure and preservative along\nthe coast, that I never saw putrified flesh, although I have seen, in\nmidsummer, dead carcasses lying exposed to the sun and weather for\nmonths. They emitted no offensive smell. There is but little disease in\nthe country arising from the climate.",
        "The botany and flora of California are rich, and will hereafter form a\nfruitful field of discovery to the naturalist. There are numerous\nplants reported to possess extraordinary medical virtues. The\n\"soap-plant” (amole) is one which appears to be among the most\nserviceable. The root, which is the saponaceous portion of the plant,\nresembles the onion, but possesses the quality of cleansing linen equal\nto any “oleic soap” manufactured by my friends Cornwall and Brother, of\nLouisville, Ky.",
        "There is another plant in high estimation with the Californians, called\ncanchalagua, which is held by them as an antidote for all the\ndiseases to which they are subject, but in particular for cases of\nfever and ague. For purifying the blood, and regulating the system, I\nthink it surpasses all the medicinal herbs that have been brought into\nnotice, and it must become, in time, one of the most important articles\nin the practice of medicine. In the season for flowers, which is\ngenerally during the months of May and June, its pretty pink-coloured\nblossoms form a conspicuous display in the great variety which adorn\nthe fields of California.",
        "The water-power in California is ample for any required mill purposes.\nTimber for lumber is not so convenient as is desirable. There is,\nhowever, a sufficiency of it, which, when improvements are made, will\nbe more accessible. The timber on the Sierra Nevada, the most\nmagnificent in the world, cannot be, at present, available. The\nevergreen oak, that grows generally in the valleys, is not valuable,\nexcept for fuel. But in the canadas of the hills, and at several\nplaces on the coast, particularly at Santa Cruz and Bodega, there is an\namount of pine and fir, adapted for lumber, that will not be consumed\nfor a long time.",
        "The religion of the Californians is the Roman Catholic, and, like the\npeople of all Roman Catholic countries, they appear to be devotedly\nattached to the forms of their religion. That there are some, I will\nnot say how many, paganish grafts upon the laws, formalities, and\nceremonies, as prescribed by the “Holy Church Universal” for its\ngovernment and observance, is undeniable, but these probably do not\nmaterially affect the system. The females, I noticed, were nearly all\ndevoutly attached to their religious institutions. I have seen, on\nfestival or saint days, the entire floor of a church occupied by pious\nwomen, with their children, kneeling in devout worship, and chanting\nwith much fervency some dismal hymn appertaining to the service. There\nare but few of the Jesuit fathers who established the missions now\nremaining in the country. The services are performed at several of the\nchurches that I visited, by native Indians, educated by the padresprevious to their expulsion by the Mexican government.",
        "OFFICIAL REPORT ON THE GOLD MINES.",
        "The following is an official account of a visit paid to the gold region\nin July by Colonel Mason, who had been appointed to the military\ncommand in California, and made his report to the authorities at\nWashington. It is dated from head-quarters at Monterey, August 17,\n1848.",
        "“Sir,–I have the honour to inform you that, accompanied by Lieut. W.T.\nSherman, 3rd Artillery, A.A.A. General, I started on the 12th of June\nlast to make a tour through the northern part of California. We reached\nSan Francisco on the 20th, and found that all, or nearly all, its male\ninhabitants had gone to the mines. The town, which a few months before\nwas so busy and thriving, was then almost deserted. Along the whole\nroute mills were lying idle, fields of wheat were open to cattle and\nhorses, houses vacant, and farms going to waste.",
        "“On the 5th we arrived in the neighbourhood of the mines, and proceeded\ntwenty-five miles up the American Fork, to a point on it now known as\nthe Lower Mines, or Mormon Diggings. The hill sides were thickly strewn\nwith canvas tents and bush-harbours; a store was erected, and several\nboarding shanties in operation. The day was intensely hot, yet about\n200 men were at work in the full glare of the sun, washing for\ngold–some with tin pans, some with close woven Indian baskets, but the\ngreater part had a rude machine known as the cradle. This is on\nrockers, six or eight feet long, open at the foot, and its head had a\ncoarse grate, or sieve; the bottom is rounded, with small cleets nailed\nacross. Four men are required to work this machine; one digs the ground\nin the bank close by the stream; another carries it to the cradle, and\nempties it on the grate; a third gives a violent rocking motion to the\nmachine, whilst a fourth dashes on water from the stream itself. The\nsieve keeps the coarse stones from entering the cradle, the current of\nwater washes off the earthy matter, and the gravel is gradually carried\nout at the foot of the machine, leaving the gold mixed with a heavy\nfine black sand above the first cleets. The sand and gold mixed\ntogether are then drawn off through auger holes into a pan below, are\ndried in the sun, and afterwards separated by blowing off the sand. A\nparty of four men, thus employed at the Lower Mines, average 100\ndollars a-day. The Indians, and those who have nothing but pans or\nwillow baskets, gradually wash out the earth, and separate the gravel\nby hand, leaving nothing but the gold mixed with sand, which is\nseparated in the manner before described. The gold in the Lower Mines\nis in fine bright scales, of which I send several specimens.",
        "“As we ascended the south branch of the American fork, the country\nbecame more broken and mountainous, and twenty-five miles below the\nlower washings the hills rise to about 1000 feet above the level of the\nSacramento Plain. Here a species of pine occurs, which led to the\ndiscovery of the gold. Captain Sutter, feeling the great want of\nlumber, contracted in September last with a Mr. Marshall to build a\nsaw-mill at that place. It was erected in the course of the past winter\nand spring–a dam and race constructed; but when the water was let on\nthe wheel, the tail race was found to be too narrow to permit the water\nto escape with sufficient rapidity. Mr. Marshall, to save labour, let\nthe water directly into the race with a strong current, so as to wash\nit wider and deeper. He effected his purpose, and a large bed of mud\nand gravel was carried to the foot of the race. One day Mr. Marshall,\nas he was walking down the race to this deposit of mud, observed some\nglittering particles at its upper edge; he gathered a few, examined\nthem, and became satisfied of their value. He then went to the fort,\ntold Captain Sutter of his discovery, and they agreed to keep it secret\nuntil a certain grist-mill of Sutter’s was finished. It, however, got\nout and spread like magic. Remarkable success attended the labours of\nthe first explorers, and, in a few weeks, hundreds of men were drawn\nthither. At the time of my visit, but little more than three months\nafter its first discovery, it was estimated that upwards of four\nthousand people were employed. At the mill there is a fine deposit or\nbank of gravel, which the people respect as the property of Captain\nSutter, though he pretends to no right to it, and would be perfectly\nsatisfied with the simple promise of a pre-emption on account of the\nmill which he has built there at a considerable cost. Mr. Marshall was\nliving near the mill, and informed me that many persons were employed\nabove and below him; that they used the same machines as at the lower\nwashings, and that their success was about the same–ranging from one\nto three ounces of gold per man daily. This gold, too, is in scales a\nlittle coarser than those of the lower mines. From the mill Mr.\nMarshall guided me up the mountain on the opposite or north bank of the\nsouth fork, where in the bed of small streams or ravines, now dry, a\ngreat deal of coarse gold has been found. I there saw several parties\nat work, all of whom were doing very well; a great many specimens were\nshown me, some as heavy as four or five ounces in weight; and I send\nthree pieces, labelled No. 5, presented by a Mr. Spence. You will\nperceive that some of the specimens accompanying this hold mechanically\npieces of quartz–that the surface is rough, and evidently moulded in\nthe crevice of a rock. This gold cannot have been carried far by water,\nbut must have remained near where it was first deposited from the rock\nthat once bound it. I inquired of many if they had encountered the\nmetal in its matrix, but in every instance they said they had not; but\nthat the gold was invariably mixed with wash-gravel, or lodged in the\ncrevices of other rocks. All bore testimony that they had found gold in\ngreater or less quantities in the numerous small gullies or ravines\nthat occur in that mountainous region. On the 7th of July I left the\nmill, and crossed to a small stream emptying into the American fork,\nthree or four miles below the saw-mill. I struck the stream (now known\nas Weber’s Creek) at the washings of Sunol and Company. They had about\nthirty Indians employed, whom they pay in merchandise. They were\ngetting gold of a character similar to that found in the main fork, and\ndoubtless in sufficient quantities to satisfy them. I send you a small\nspecimen, presented by this Company, of their gold. From this point we\nproceeded up the stream about eight miles, where we found a great many\npeople and Indians, some engaged in the bed of the stream, and others\nin the small side valleys that put into it. These latter are\nexceedingly rich, two ounces being considered an ordinary yield for a\nday’s work. A small gutter, not more than 100 yards long by four feet\nwide, and two or three deep, was pointed out to me as the one where two\nmen (W. Daly and Percy McCoon) had a short time before obtained. 17,000\ndollars’ worth of gold. Captain Weber informed me, that he knew that\nthese two men had employed four white men and about 100 Indians, and\nthat, at the end of one week’s work, they paid off their party, and had\nleft 10,000 dollars’ worth of this gold. Another small ravine was shown\nme, from which had been taken upwards of 12,000 dollars’ worth of gold.\nHundreds of similar ravines, to all appearances, are as yet untouched.\nI could not have credited these reports had I not seen, in the\nabundance of the precious metal, evidence of their truth. Mr. Neligh,\nan agent of Commodore Stockton, had been at work about three weeks in\nthe neighbourhood, and showed me, in bags and bottles, 2000 dollars’\nworth of gold; and Mr. Lyman, a gentleman of education, and worthy of\nevery credit, said he had been engaged with four others, with a\nmachine, on the American fork, just below Sutter’s Mill, that they\nworked eight days, and that his share was at the rate of fifty dollars\na-day, but hearing that others were doing better at Weber’s Place, they\nhad removed there, and were then on the point of resuming operations.",
        "“The country on either side of Weber’s Creek is much broken up by\nhills, and is intersected in every direction by small streams or\nravines which contain more or less gold. Those that have been worked\nare barely scratched, and, although thousands of ounces have been\ncarried away, I do not consider that a serious impression has been made\nupon the whole. Every day was developing new and richer deposits; and\nthe only impression seemed to be, that the metal would be found in such\nabundance as seriously to depreciate in value.",
        "“On the 8th July I returned to the lower mines, and eventually to\nMonterey, where I arrived on the 17th of July. Before leaving Sutter’s,\nI satisfied myself that gold existed in the bed of the Feather River,\nin the Yubah and Bear, and in many of the small streams that lie\nbetween the latter and the American fork; also, that it had been found\nin the Consummes, to the south of the American fork. In each of these\nstreams the gold is found in small scales, whereas in the intervening\nmountains it occurs in coarser lumps.",
        "“Mr. Sinclair, whose rancho is three miles above Sutter’s on the north\nside of the American, employs about fifty Indians on the north fork,\nnot far from its junction with the main stream. He had been engaged\nabout five weeks when I saw him, and up to that time his Indians had\nused simply closely-woven willow baskets. His net proceeds (which I\nsaw) were about 16,000 dollars’ worth of gold. He showed me the\nproceeds of his last week’s work–14 lbs. avoirdupois of clean-washed\ngold.",
        "“The principal store at Sutter’s fort, that of Brannan and Co., had\nreceived in payment for goods 36,000 dollars’ worth of this gold from\nthe 1st of May to the 10th of July. Other merchants had also made\nextensive sales. Large quantities of goods were daily sent forward to\nthe mines, as the Indians, heretofore so poor and degraded, have\nsuddenly become consumers of the luxuries of life. I before mentioned\nthat the greater part of the farmers and rancheros had abandoned their\nfields to go to the mines. This is not the case with Captain Sutter,\nwho was carefully gathering his wheat, estimated at 40,000 bushels.\nFlour is already worth, at Sutter’s, 36 dollars a-barrel, and will soon\nbe 50. Unless large quantities of breadstuffs reach the country much\nsuffering will occur; but as each man is now able to pay a large price,\nit is believed the merchants will bring from Chili and the Oregon a\nplentiful supply for the coming winter.",
        "“The most moderate estimate I could obtain from men acquainted with the\nsubject was, that upwards of 4,000 men were working in the gold\ndistrict, of whom more than one-half were Indians, and that from 30,000\nto 50,000 dollars’ worth of gold, if not more, were daily obtained. The\nentire gold district, with very few exceptions of grants made some\nyears ago by the Mexican authorities, is on land belonging to the\nUnited States. It was a matter of serious reflection to me, how I could\nsecure to the Government certain rents or fees for the privilege of\nsecuring this gold; but upon considering the large extent of country,\nthe character of the people engaged, and the small scattered force at\nmy command, I resolved not to interfere, but permit all to work freely,\nunless broils and crimes should call for interference.",
        "“The discovery of these vast deposits of gold has entirely changed the\ncharacter of Upper California. Its people, before engaged in\ncultivating their small patches of ground, and guarding their herds of\ncattle and horses, have all gone to the mines, or are on their way\nthither. Labourers of every trade have left their work-benches, and\ntradesmen their shops; sailors desert their ships as fast as they\narrive on the coast; and several vessels have gone to sea with hardly\nenough hands to spread a sail. Two or three are now at anchor in San\nFrancisco, with no crew on board. Many desertions, too, have taken\nplace from the garrisons within the influence of these mines;\ntwenty-six soldiers have deserted from the post of Sonoma, twenty-four\nfrom that of San Francisco, and twenty-four from Monterey. I have no\nhesitation now in saying, that there is more gold in the country\ndrained by the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers than will pay the cost\nof the present war with Mexico a hundred times over. No capital is\nrequired to obtain this gold, as the labouring man wants nothing but\nhis pick and shovel and tin pan, with which to dig and wash the gravel,\nand many frequently pick gold out of the crevices of rocks with their\nknives, in pieces of from one to six ounces.",
        "“Gold is also believed to exist on the eastern slope of the Sierra\nNevada; and, when at the mines, I was informed by an intelligent Mormon\nthat it had been found near the Great Salt Lake by some of his\nfraternity. Nearly all the Mormons are leaving California to go to the\nSalt Lake; and this they surely would not do unless they were sure of\nfinding gold there, in the same abundance as they now do on the\nSacramento.",

        "“We can now call ourselves citizens of the United States. We have now\nonly to go by law, as we formerly went by custom; that is, when\nCongress gives us a government and code. The old foreign residents of\nCalifornia, having done very well ten or twenty years without law, care\nbut very little whether Congress pays early or late attention to the\nsubject. Those who have emigrated from the Atlantic States within the\nlast three or four years deem the subject an important one; I only call\nit difficult.

The general Government\nmay appoint governors, secretaries, and other public functionaries; and\njudges, marshals, collectors, etc., may accept offices with salaries of\n3000 or 4000 dollars per annum; but how they are to obtain their petty\nofficers, at half these sums, remains to be seen. The pay of a member\nof Congress will be accepted here by those alone who do not know enough\nto better themselves. Mechanics can now get 10 to 16 dollars per day;\nlabourers on the wharfs or elsewhere, 5 to 10 dollars; clerks and\nstorekeepers, 1000 to 3000 dollars per annum–some engage to keep store\nduring their pleasure at 8 dollars per day, or 1 lb. or 1-1/2 lb. of\ngold per month; cooks and stewards, 60 to 100 dollars per month. In\nfact, labour of every description commands exorbitant prices.",
        "“The Sandwich Islands, Oregon, and Lower California are fast parting\nwith their inhabitants, all bound for this coast, and thence to the\ngreat ’placer’ of the Sacramento Valley, where the digging and washing\nof one man that does not produce 100 troy ounces of gold, 23 carats,\nfrom the size of a half spangle to one pound in a month, sets the\ndigger to ’prospecting,’ that is, looking for better grounds. Your\n’Paisano’ can point out many a man who has, for fifteen to twenty days\nin succession, bagged up five to ten ounces of gold a-day. Our placer,\nor gold region, now extends over 300 or 400 miles of country, embracing\nall the creeks and branches on the east side of the river Sacramento\nand one side of the San Joaquin. In my travels I have, when resting\nunder a tree and grazing my horse, seen pieces of pure gold taken from\ncrevices of the rocks or slate where we were stopping. On one occasion,\nnooning or refreshing on the side of a stream entirely unknown to\ndiggers or ’prospectors,’ or rather, if known not attended to, one of\nmy companions, while rolling in the sand, said, ’Give me a tin pan; why\nshould we not be cooking in gold sand?’ He took a pan, filled it with\nsand, washed it out, and produced in five minutes two or three dollars’\nworth of gold, merely saying, as he threw both pan and gold on the\nsand, ’I thought so.’ Perhaps it is fair that your readers should\nlearn, that, however plenty the Sacramento Valley may afford gold, the\nobtaining of it has its disadvantages. From the 1st of July to the 1st\nof October, more or less, one half of the people will have fever and\nague, or intermittent fever. In the winter, it is too cold to work in\nthe water. Some work in the sand by washing from the surface in a\nwooden bowl, or tin pan; some gouge it out from the rocks or slate; the\nmore lazy ones roll about and pick up the large pieces, leaving the\nsmall gold for the next emigration. The extent of the gold region on\nthe San Joaquin and Sacramento rivers extends a distance of 800 miles\nin length by 100 in width. It embraces not only gold, but quantities of\nquicksilver in almost general abundance. It is estimated that a small\npopulation actively engaged in mining operations in that region could\nexport 100,000,000 dollars in gold in every year, and that an increased\npopulation might increase that amount to 300,000,000 dollars annually.\nYou may believe me when I say that for some time to come California\nwill export, yearly, nearly or quite 500,000 ounces of gold, 22 to 24\ncarats fine; some pieces of that will weigh 16 lbs., very many 1 lb.\nMany men who began last June to dig gold with a capital of 50 dollars\ncan now show 5000 to 15,000 dollars. I saw a man to-day making\npurchases of dry goods, etc., for his family, lay on the counter a bag\nof raw hide, well sewed up, containing 109 ounces. I observed, ’That is\na good way to pack gold dust.’ He very innocently replied, ’All the\nbags I brought down are that way; I like the size!’ Five such bags in\nNew York would bring nearly 10,000 dollars. This man left his family\nlast August. Three months’ digging and washing, producing four or five\nbags, of 100 ounces each, is better than being mate of a vessel at 40\ndollars per month, as the man formerly was. His companion, a Mexican,\nwho camped and worked with him, only had two or three cow-hide bags of\ngold. In this tough, but true, golden tale, you must not imagine that\nall men are equally successful. There are some who have done better,\neven to 4000 dollars in a month; many 1000 dollars during the summer;\nand others, who refused to join a company of gold-washers who had a\ncheap-made machine, and receive one ounce per day, that returned to the\nsettlement with not a vest pocket-full of gold. Some left with only\nsufficient to pay for a horse and saddle, and pay the physician six\nounces of gold for one ounce of quinine, calomel, and jalap in\nproportion. An ounce of gold for advice given, six ounces a visit,\nbrings the fever and ague to be rather an expensive companion. A ’well’\nman has his proportionate heavy expenses also, to reduce his piles or\nbags of gold. Dry beef in the settlements, at 4 cents per lb., at the\nPlacer, 1 to 2 dollars per lb.; salt beef and pork, 50 to 100 dollars\nper barrel; flour, 30 to 75 dollars per barrel; coffee, sugar, and\nrice, 50 cents to 1 dollar per lb. As washing is 50 cents to 1 dollar a\ngarment, many prefer throwing away their used-up clothes to paying the\nwasherwoman; that is, if they intend returning to the settlements soon,\nwhere they can purchase more. As to shaving, I have never seen a man at\nthe Placer who had time to perform that operation. They do not work on\nSundays, only brush up the tent, blow out the emery or fine black sand\nfrom the week’s work. Horses that can travel only one day, and from\nthat to a week, are from 100 to 300 dollars. Freight charge by launch\nowners for three days’ run, 5 dollars per barrel. Wagoners charge 50 to\n100 dollars per load, 20 to 50 miles, on good road. Corn, barley, peas,\nand beans, 10 dollars a-bushel. Common pistols, any price; powder and\nlead very dear. I know a physician who, in San Francisco, purchased a\ncommon made gold-washer at 20 or 30 dollars, made of 70 or 80 feet of\nboards. At a great expense he boated it up to the first landing on the\nSacramento, and there met a wagoner bound to one of the diggings with\nan empty wagon, distant about 50 miles. The wagoner would not take up\nthe machine under 100 dollars. The doctor had to consent, and bided his\ntime. June passed over, rich in gold; all on that creek did wonders,\nwhen the wagoner fell sick, called on his friend the doctor, whose tent\nwas in sight; the doctor came, but would not administer the first dose\nunder the old sum of 100 dollars, which was agreed to, under a proviso\nthat the following doses should be furnished more moderate. When a\nman’s time is worth 100 dollars a-day, to use a spade and tin pan,\nneither doctors nor wagoners can think much of a pound of gold, and you\nmay suppose merchants, traders, and pedlars are not slow to make their\nfortunes in these golden times. In San Francisco there is more\nmerchandize sold now, monthly, than before in a year. Vessels after\nvessels arrive, land their cargoes, dispose of them, and bag up the\ndust and lay up the vessel, as the crew are soon among the missing. The\ncleanest clear out is where the captain follows the crew. There are\nmany vessels in San Francisco that cannot weigh anchor, even with the\nassistance of three or four neighbouring vessels. Supercargoes must\nland cargo on arriving, or have no crew to do it for them. Some vessels\ncontinue to go to sea, with small crews, at 50 dollars per month for\ngreen hands. Old hands are too wise for them, and prefer digging an\nounce or two a-day, and drinking hock and champagne at half an ounce\na-bottle, and eating bad sea bread at 1 dollar per pound. I have seen a\ncaptain of a vessel, who, by his old contract in the port whence he\nsailed, was getting 60 dollars per month, paying his cook 75 dollars,\nand offering 100 dollars per month for a steward; his former crew, even\nto his mates, having gone a ’prospecting.’ Uncle Sam’s ships suffer a\nlittle the same way, although they offer from 200 to 500 dollars for\nthe apprehension of a deserter. The Ohio, however, laid in the port of\nMonterey about a month, and lost only 20 or 30 men. Colonel Stevenson’s\nregiment is disbanded, 99 out of 100 of whom have also gone ’prospecting,’\nincluding the colonel, who arrived in Monterey last month, from his\nlast post, and was met by his men at the edge of the town, to escort\nand cheer him into the town. The captains, etc., have bought up\ncountry carts and oxen, turned drivers, and gone to the Placer. Our\nworthy governor, Colonel of the 1st Dragoons, etc., having plenty of\ncarts, wagons, horses, and mules, with a few regulars left, has also\ngone, but under better advantages, for the second or third time, to see\nthe Placer and the country, and have justice done to his countrymen or\nhimself. Commodore Jones, lately arrived in Monterey, supposed it to be\nthe capital, head-quarters, etc., but found not even the Governor left.\nWhere head-quarters are may be uncertain, whether in Monterey, Sutter’s\nFort, or in a four-mule wagon travelling over the gold region. Now,\nwhether headquarters are freighted with munitions of war, etc., or\nwhether the cargo consists of blankets, shirts, etc., to clothe the\nsuffering Indians, for the paltry consideration of gold, no one cares\nor knows; but the principle should be, that, if privates can or will be\noff making their thousands, those who are better able should not go\ngoldless.”",
        "The Washington Union contains a letter from Lieutenant Larkin, dated\nMonterey, November 16, received at the State Department, containing\nfurther confirmation of the previous despatches, public and private,\nand far outstripping all other news in its exciting character. The gold\nwas increasing in size and quality daily. Lumps were found weighing\nfrom one to two pounds. Several had been heard of weighing as high as\n16 pounds, and one 25 pounds. Many men, who were poor in June, were\nworth 30,000 dollars, by digging and trading with the Indians. 100\ndollars a-day is the average amount realized daily, from July to\nOctober. Half the diggers were sick with fevers, though not many deaths\nhad occurred among them. The Indians would readily give an ounce of\ngold for a common calico shirt; others were selling for ten dollars\neach in specie. The gold region extends over a track of 300 miles, and\nit was not known that it did not extend 1000. A letter from Commodore\nJones states that many of the petty officers and men had deserted and\ngone in search of the gold. He adds, the Indians were selling gold at\n50 cents the ounce. Many vessels were deserted by captain, cook, and\nseamen. The ship Isaac Walton offered discharged soldiers 50 dollars\nper month to go to Callao, which was refused. She was supplied by\ngovernment sailors. All the naval vessels on the coast were short of\nhands. Nearly the whole of the 3rd Artillery had deserted. Provisions\nwere scarce and high; board, 4 dollars a-day; washing, 6 dollars\na-dozen. Merchants’ clerks get from 2000 to 3000 dollars a-year.",

This road is the best that has\nyet been discovered, and to the Bay of San Francisco and the Gold\nRegion it is much the shortest. The Indians, moreover, on this route,\nhave, up to the present time, been so friendly as to commit no acts of\nhostility on the emigrants. The trail is plain and good where there are\nno physical obstructions, and the emigrant, by taking this route, will\ncertainly reach his destination in good season and without disaster.\nFrom our information we would most earnestly advise all emigrants to\ntake this trail, without deviation, if they would avoid the fatal\ncalamities which almost invariably have attended those who have\nundertaken to explore new routes.",
        "The lightest wagon that can be constructed, of sufficient strength to\ncarry 2500 pounds’ weight, is the vehicle most desirable. No wagon\nshould be loaded over this weight, or if it is, it will be certain to\nstall in the muddy sloughs and crossings on the prairie in the first\npart of the journey. This wagon can be hauled by three or four yokes of\noxen or six mules. Oxen are usually employed by the emigrants for\nhauling their wagons. They travel about 15 miles per day, and, all\nthings considered, are perhaps equal to mules for this service,\nalthough they cannot travel so fast. They are, however, less expensive,\nand there is not so much danger of their straying and of being stolen\nby the Indians.",
        "Pack-mules can only be employed by parties of men. It would be very\ndifficult to transport a party of women and children on pack-mules,\nwith the provisions, clothing, and other baggage necessary to their\ncomfort. A party of men, however, with pack-mules, can make the journey\nin less time by one month than it can be done in wagons–carrying with\nthem, however, nothing more than their provisions, clothing, and\nammunition.",
        "For parties of men going out, it would be well to haul their wagons,\nprovisions, etc., as far as Fort Laramie, or Fort Hall, by mules,\ncarrying with them pack-saddles and alforjases, or large saddle-bags,\nadapted to the pack-saddle, with ropes for packing, etc., when, if they\nsaw proper, they could dispose of their wagons for Indian ponies, and\npack into California, gaining perhaps two or three weeks’ time.",

        "Added to these, the main items, there should be a small quantity of\nrice, 50 or 75 lbs. of crackers, dried peaches, etc., and a keg of\nlard, with salt, pepper, etc., and such other luxuries of light weight\nas the person outfitting chooses to purchase.

The influx of\npopulation will probably be so great that it will be difficult, if not\nimpossible, to obtain other shelter for some time after their arrival.\nThe climate of the country, however, even in winter, is so mild that,\nwith good tents, comfort is attainable. They should be careful, also,\nto carry as much subsistence into the country as they can; as what\nthey purchase there, after their arrival, they will be compelled to pay\na high price for.",
        "The shortest route to California is unquestionably by the West India\nMail Packets, which leave Southampton on the 17th of every month. The\npoint to which they take passengers is Chagres. This voyage is usually\naccomplished in about 22 to 26 days. From thence passengers proceed\nacross the Isthmus, a distance of about 52 miles (say three or four\ndays’ journey) to Panama, and thence 3500 miles by sea in the Pacific\nto St. Francisco. From the vast number of eager emigrants that it is\nexpected will assemble at Panama, it is very probable that great delay\nwill be occasioned from there not being sufficient number of vessels to\nconvey them to their destination. Unless such adventurers are\nabundantly supplied with money, they will not be able to live in the\nhot desolation of the tropics, where life is but little valued, and\nwhere death is even less regarded. The entire route by sea (round Cape\nHorn) cannot be less than 18,500 miles, and generally occupies from\nfive to six months, yet this route is much cheaper, safer, and in the\nend (from the delay that will occur at Panama) quite as short. This\nroute, particularly to parties from England, is universally allowed to\nbe the best many, dangers and difficulties that attend the route across\nthe Isthmus of Panama (not noticing the probable delay) will be\navoided, and many a one will bitterly regret that he was ever induced\nto attempt (as he perceives ship after ship sailing gallantly on to\nthese favoured regions) what he considered a shorter route, from the\nwant of the means of transit, while he is himself compelled idly to\nwaste his time, a prey to pestilence and to the “hope deferred that\nmaketh the heart sick.”",
        "The following are letters addressed to the Government at Washington,\nand other communications, all of which, it will be seen, are fully\nconfirmatory of the accounts given in the preceding pages; with other\ndetails of interest relative to the state of the gold districts:",
        "Extract from a Letter from Mr. Larkin, United States Consul at\nMonterey, to Mr. Buchanan, Secretary of State at Washington.\n\"San Francisco (Upper California), June 1, 1848.",
        "“Sir: * * * I have to report to the State Department one of the most\nastonishing excitements and state of affairs now existing in this\ncountry, that, perhaps, has ever been brought to the notice of the\nGovernment. On the American fork of the Sacramento and Feather River,\nanother branch of the same, and the adjoining lands, there has been\nwithin the present year discovered a placer, a vast tract of land\ncontaining gold, in small particles. This gold, thus far, has been\ntaken on the bank of the river, from the surface to eighteen inches in\ndepth, and is supposed deeper, and to extend over the country.",
        "“On account of the inconvenience of washing, the people have, up to\nthis time, only gathered the metal on the banks, which is done simply\nwith a shovel, filling a shallow dish, bowl, basket, or tin pan, with a\nquantity of black sand, similar to the class used on paper, and washing\nout the sand by movement of the vessel. It is now two or three weeks\nsince the men employed in those washings have appeared in this town\nwith gold, to exchange for merchandise and provisions. I presume nearly\n20,000 dollars of this gold has as yet been so exchanged. Some 200 or\n300 men have remained up the river, or are gone to their homes, for the\npurpose of returning to the Placer, and washing immediately with\nshovels, picks, and baskets; many of them, for the first few weeks,\ndepending on borrowing from others. I have seen the written statement\nof the work of one man for sixteen days, which averaged 25 dollars per\nday; others have, with a shovel and pan, or wooden bowl, washed out 10\ndollars to even 50 dollars in a day. There are now some men yet washing\nwho have 500 dollars to 1,000 dollars. As they have to stand two feet\ndeep in the river, they work but a few hours in the day, and not every\nday in the week.",
        "“A few men have been down in boats to this port, spending twenty to\nthirty ounces of gold each–about 300 dollars. I am confident that this\ntown (San Francisco) has one-half of its tenements empty, locked up\nwith the furniture. The owners–storekeepers, lawyers, mechanics, and\nlabourers–all gone to the Sacramento with their families. Small\nparties, of five to fifteen men, have sent to this town and offered\ncooks ten to fifteen dollars per day for a few weeks. Mechanics and\nteamsters, earning the year past five to eight dollars per day, have\nstruck and gone. Several U.S. volunteers have deserted. U.S. barque\nAnita, belonging to the Army, now at anchor here, has but six men. One\nSandwich Island vessel in port lost all her men; and was obliged to\nengaged another crew at 50 dollars for the run of fifteen days to the\nIslands.",

They have been gone a week. Common\nspades and shovels, one month ago worth 1 dollar, will now bring 10\ndollars, at the gold regions. I am informed 50 dollars has been offered\nfor one. Should this gold continue as represented, this town and others\nwould be depopulated. Clerks’ wages have risen from 600 dollars to 1000\nper annum, and board; cooks, 25 dollars to 30 dollars per month. This\nsum will not be any inducement a month longer, unless the fever and\nague appears among the washers. The Californian, printed here,\nstopped this week. The Star newspaper office, where the new laws of\nGovernor Mason, for this country, are printing, has but one man left. A\nmerchant, lately from China, has even lost his China servants. Should\nthe excitement continue through the year, and the whale-ships visit San\nFrancisco, I think they will lose most all their crews. How Col.

It may end\nthis year; but I am informed that it will continue many years.\nMechanics now in this town are only wailing to finish some rude\nmachinery, to enable them to obtain the gold more expeditiously, and\nfree from working in the river. Up to this time, but few Californians\nhave gone to the mines, being afraid the Americans will soon have\ntrouble among themselves, and cause disturbance to all around. I have\nseen some of the black sand, as taken from the bottom of the river (I\nshould think in the States it would bring 25 to 50 cents per pound),\ncontaining many pieces of gold; they are from the size of the head of a\npin to the weight of the eighth of an ounce. I have seen some weighing\none-quarter of an ounce (4 dollars). Although my statements are almost\nincredible, I believe I am within the statements believed by every one\nhere.

        "“SIR: My last dispatch to the State Department was written in San\nFrancisco, the 1st of this month. In that I had the honour to give some\ninformation respecting the new ’placer,’ or gold regions lately\ndiscovered on the branches of the Sacramento River. Since the writing\nof that dispatch I have visited a part of the gold region, and found it\nall I had heard, and much more than I anticipated. The part that I\nvisited was upon a fork of the American River, a branch of the\nSacramento, joining the main river at Sutter’s Fort. The place in which\nI found the people digging was about twenty-five miles from the fort by\nland.",
        "“I have reason to believe that gold will be found on many branches of\nthe Sacramento and the Joaquin rivers. People are already scattered\nover one hundred miles of land, and it is supposed that the ’placer’\nextends from river to river. At present the workmen are employed within\nten or twenty yards of the river, that they may be convenient to water.\nOn Feather river there are several branches upon which the people are\ndigging for gold. This is two or three days’ ride from the place I\nvisited.",
        "“At my camping place I found, on a surface of two or three miles on the\nbanks of the river, some fifty tents, mostly owned by Americans. These\nhad their families. There are no Californians who have taken their\nfamilies as yet to the gold regions; but few or none will ever do it;\nsome from New Mexico may do so next year, but no Californians.",
        "“I was two nights at a tent occupied by eight Americans, viz., two\nsailors, one clerk, two carpenters, and three daily workmen. These men\nwere in company; had two machines, each made from one hundred feet of\nboards (worth there 150 dollars, in Monterey 15 dollars–being one\nday’s work), made similar to a child’s cradle, ten feet long, without\nthe ends.",
        "“The two evenings I saw these eight men bring to their tents the labour\nof the day. I suppose they made each 50 dollars per day; their own\ncalculation was two pounds of gold a-day–four ounces to a man–64\ndollars. I saw two brothers that worked together, and only worked by\nwashing the dirt in a tin pan, weigh the gold they obtained in one day;\nthe result was 7 dollars to one, 82 dollars to the other. There were\ntwo reasons for this difference; one man worked less hours than the\nother, and by chance had ground less impregnated with gold. I give this\nstatement as an extreme case. During my visit I was an interpreter for\na native of Monterey, who was purchasing a machine or canoe. I first\ntried to purchase boards and hire a carpenter for him. There were but a\nfew hundred feet of boards to be had; for these the owner asked me 50\ndollars per hundred (500 dollars per thousand), and a carpenter washing\ngold dust demanded 50 dollars per day for working. I at last purchased\na log dug out, with a riddle and sieve made of willow boughs on it, for\n120 dollars, payable in gold dust at 14 dollars per ounce. The owner\nexcused himself for the price, by saying he was two days making it, and\neven then demanded the use of it until sunset. My Californian has told\nme since, that himself, partner, and two Indians, obtained with this\ncanoe eight ounces the first and five ounces the second day.",
        "“I am of the opinion that on the American fork, Feather River, and\nCopimes River, there are near two thousand people, nine-tenths of them\nforeigners. Perhaps there are one hundred families, who have their\nteams, wagons, and tents. Many persons are waiting to see whether the\nmonths of July and August will be sickly, before they leave their\npresent business to go to the ’Placer.’ The discovery of this gold was\nmade by some Mormons, in January or February, who for a time kept it a\nsecret; the majority of those who are working there began in May. In\nmost every instance the men, after digging a few days, have been\ncompelled to leave for the purpose of returning home to see their\nfamilies, arrange their business, and purchase provisions. I feel\nconfident in saying there are fifty men in this ’Placer’ who have on an\naverage 1,000 dollars each, obtained in May and June. I have not met\nwith any person who had been fully employed in washing gold one month;\nmost, however, appear to have averaged an ounce per day. I think there\nmust, by this time, be over 1,000 men at work upon the different\nbranches of the Sacramento; putting their gains at 10,000 dollars per\nday, for six days in the week, appears to me not overrated.",
        "“Should this news reach the emigration of California and Oregon, now on\nthe road, connected with the Indian wars, now impoverishing the latter\ncountry, we should have a large addition to our population; and should\nthe richness of the gold region continue, our emigration in 1849 will\nbe many thousands, and in 1850 still more. If our countrymen in\nCalifornia, as clerks, mechanics, and workmen, will forsake employment\nat from 2 dollars to 6 dollars per day, how many more of the same class\nin the Atlantic States, earning much less, will leave for this country\nunder such prospects? It is the opinion of many who have visited the\ngold regions the past and present months, that the ground will afford\ngold for many years, perhaps for a century. From my own examination of\nthe rivers and their banks, I am of opinion that, at least for a few\nyears, the golden products will equal the present year. However, as\nneither men of science, nor the labourers now at work, have made any\nexplorations of consequence, it is a matter of impossibility to give\nany opinion as to the extent and richness of this part of California.\nEvery Mexican who has seen the place says throughout their Republic\nthere has never been any ’placer like this one.’",
        "“Could Mr. Polk and yourself see California as we now see it, you would\nthink that a few thousand people, on 100 miles square of the Sacramento\nvalley, would yearly turn out of this river the whole price our country\npays for the acquired territory. When I finished my first letter I\ndoubted my own writing, and, to be better satisfied, showed it to one\nof the principal merchants of San Francisco, and to Captain Fulsom, of\nthe Quartermaster’s Department, who decided at once I was far below the\nreality. You certainly will suppose, from my two letters, that I am,\nlike others, led away by the excitement of the day. I think I am not.\nIn my last I inclosed a small sample of the gold dust, and I find my\nonly error was in putting a value to the sand. At that time I was not\naware how the gold was found; I now can describe the mode of collecting\nit.",
        "“A person without a machine, after digging off one or two feet of the\nupper ground, near the water (in some cases they take the top earth),\nthrows into a tin pan or wooden bowl a shovel full of loose dirt and\nstones; then placing the basin an inch or two under water, continues to\nstir up the dirt with his hand in such a manner that the running water\nwill carry off the light earths, occasionally, with his hand, throwing\nout the stones; after an operation of this kind for twenty or thirty\nminutes, a spoonful of small black sand remains; this is on a\nhandkerchief or cloth dried in the sun, the emerge is blown off,\nleaving the pure gold. I have the pleasure of inclosing a paper of this\nsand and gold, which I from a bucket of dirt and stones, in\nhalf-an-hour, standing at the edge of the water, washed out myself. The\nvalue of it may be 2 dollars or 3 dollars.",
        "“The size of the gold depends in some measure upon the river from which\nit is taken; the banks of one river having larger grains of gold than\nanother. I presume more than one half of the gold put into pans or\nmachines is washed out and goes down the stream; this is of no\nconsequence to the washers, who care only for the present time. Some\nhave formed companies of four or five men, and have a rough-made\nmachine put together in a day, which worked to much advantage, yet many\nprefer to work alone, with a wooden bowl or tin pan, worth fifteen or\ntwenty cents in the States, but eight to sixteen dollars at the gold\nregion. As the workmen continue, and materials can be obtained,\nimprovements will take place in the mode of obtaining gold; at present\nit is obtained by standing in the water, and with much severe labour,\nor such as is called here severe labour.",
        "“How long this gathering of gold by the handful will continue here, or\nthe future effect it will have on California, I cannot say.\nThree-fourths of the houses in the town on the bay of San Francisco are\ndeserted. Houses are sold at the price of the ground lots. The effects\nare this week showing themselves in Monterey. Almost every house I had\nhired out is given up. Every blacksmith, carpenter, and lawyer is\nleaving; brick-yards, saw-mills and ranches are left perfectly alone. A\nlarge number of the volunteers at San Francisco and Sonoma have\ndeserted; some have been retaken and brought back; public and private\nvessels are losing their crews; my clerks have had 100 per cent.\nadvance offered them on their wages to accept employment. A complete\nrevolution in the ordinary state of affairs is taking place; both of\nour newspapers are discontinued from want of workmen and the loss of\ntheir agencies; the Alcaldes have left San Francisco, and I believe\nSonoma likewise; the former place has not a Justice of the Peace left.",

Governor Mason and his\nstaff have left Monterey to visit the place in question, and will, I\nsuppose, soon forward to his department his views and opinions on this\nsubject. Most of the land, where gold has been discovered, is public\nland; there are on different rivers some private grants.

Some get eight or ten ounces a-day,\nand the least active one or two. They make the most who employ the wild\nIndians to hunt it for them. There is one man who has sixty Indians in\nhis employ; his profits are a dollar a-minute. The wild Indians know\nnothing of its value, and wonder what the pale-faces want to do with\nit; they will give an ounce of it for the same weight of coined silver,\nor a thimbleful of glass beads, or a glass of grog. And white men\nthemselves often give an ounce of it, which is worth at our mint 18\ndollars, or more, for a bottle of brandy, a bottle of soda-powders, or\na plug of tobacco.",
        "“As to the quantity which the diggers get, take a few facts as\nevidence. I know seven men who worked seven weeks and two days, Sundays\nexcepted, on Feather River; they employed on an average fifty Indians,\nand got out in these seven weeks and two days 275 pounds of pure gold.\nI know the men, and have seen the gold, and know what they state to be\na fact–so stick a pin there. I know ten other men who worked ten days\nin company, employed no Indians, and averaged in these ten days 1500\ndollars each; so stick another pin there.

        "ASSAY OF THE GOLD.–Lieutenant Loeser having arrived at Washington with\nspecimens of the gold from the diggings, the following account of its\nquality appeared in the “Washington Union,” the government organ:–",
        "“Understanding last evening that the lieutenant had arrived in this\ncity, and had deposited in the War Office the precious specimens he had\nbrought with him, we called to see them, and to free our mind from all\nhesitation as to the genuineness of the metal. We had seen doubts\nexpressed in some of our exchange papers; and we readily admit that the\naccounts so nearly approached the miraculous, that we were relieved by\nthe evidence of our own senses on the subject. The specimens have all\nthe appearance of the native gold we had seen from the mines of North\nCarolina and Virginia, and we are informed that the Secretary would\nsend the small chest, called a caddy, containing about 3,000 dollars’\nworth of gold, in lumps and scales, to the mint, to be melted into\ncoins and bars. The specimens have come to Washington as they were\nextracted from the materials of the placer. The heaviest piece brought\nby Lieutenant Loeser weighs a little more than two ounces; but the\nvaried contents of the casket (as described in Colonel Mason’s\nschedule) will be sent off to-day, by special messenger, to the mint at\nPhiladelphia for assay, and early next week we hope to have the\npleasure of laying the result before our readers.” The assay was\nsubsequently made, and the result officially announced. The gold is\ndeclared to be from 3 to 8 per cent. purer than American standard gold\ncoin.",

It is 21-1/2 carats fine–within half a carat of the quality of\nEnglish sovereigns or American eagles–and is almost ready to go to the\nmint. The finest gold metal we get is from Africa, which is 22-1/2 to\n23 carats fine. In Virginia we have mines where the quality of the gold\nis much inferior–some of it so low as 19 carats–and in Georgia the\nmines produce it nearly 22 carats fine. The gold of California, which I\nhave now assayed, is fully equal to that of any, and much superior to\nsome produced from the mines in our Southern States.",

I believe every\narmy officer in California, with one or two exceptions, would have\nresigned last summer could they have done it, and been free at once to\ncommence for themselves. But the war was not then terminated, and no\none could hope to communicate with Washington correspondents, to get an\nanswer in less than six, and perhaps ten, months.

        "EFFECTS OF THIS DISCOVERY ON THE UNITED STATES.–The following remarks\nupon the influence of this immense discovery, which appeared in a\npopular New York journal on the 23rd January, proves the extent of\nimpression produced upon society in the States by the intelligence of\nthis new source of natural wealth:–",
        "“The news (February 12) from California will attract the observation of\nthe whole community, A spirit is generated from those discoveries,\nwhich is more active, more intense, and more widely spread, than that\nwhich agitated Europe in the time of Columbus, Cortez, and Pizarro.\nThere seems to be no doubt that, in a short time–probably less than\ntwo years–those mines can be made to produce 100,000,000 dollars per\nyear. The region is the most extensive of the kind in the world, being\n800 miles in length, and 100 in width, with every indication that gold\nexists in large native masses, in the rocks and mountains of the Sierra\nNevada. But these vast gold mines are not the only mineral discoveries\nthat have been made. The quicksilver in the same region seems to be as\nabundant as the gold, so that there are approximated to each other two\nmetals, which will have a most important effect and utility in making\nthe gold mines more valuable. Heretofore the gold and silver mines of\nMexico and Peru have been valuable to Spain, because she possessed a\nmonopoly of the quicksilver mines at Almaden in the Peninsula. This is\nsurpassed by California. According to the last accounts now given to\nthe public, emigrants were crowding in from every port in the Pacific\nto California–from Mexico, Peru, the Sandwich Islands, Oregon; and we\nhave no doubt by this time the British possessions in the East, China,\nand everywhere else in that region, are furnishing emigrants to the\nwonderful regions of California. In less than a year there will\nprobably be a population of 100,000 to 200,000 souls, all digging for\ngold, and capable of producing from 100,000,000 dollars to 300,000,000\ndollars worth per annum of pure gold, to be thrown on the commerce of\nthe world at one fell swoop.",
        "“What is to be the effect of such vast discoveries on the commerce of\nthe world–on old communities, on New York, London, and other great\ncommercial cities? Such a vast addition to the gold currency of the\nworld will at once disturb the prices and value of all productions and\nmerchandise to a similar extent to that which we see in Monterey and\nSan Francisco. The prices of every commodity will therefore rise\nextravagantly during the next few years, according to the produce of\ngold from that region. Now, in a rising market everything prospers;\nevery one gets rich, civilisation expands, industry increases, and all\norders of society are benefited. As soon as the first crop of gold from\nCalifornia reaches New York, the impulse which it will give to\ncommercial enterprise, and the advance in the price of everything which\nit will cause, will be tremendous. The bank currency will be expanded,\nfor the basis will be abundant; real estate will increase in value,\nagricultural productions and agricultural labour will advance at once\n10, 15, 20, 30, or 40 per cent., even to as great an extent, perhaps,\nas was witnessed when the demand came from Ireland for the food of this\ncountry to feed the starving Irish. New York and her sister cities will\nbe the centre of all those revolutionary movements which are certain to\nspring from the gold productions of California, on the commerce of the\nwhole civilized world. Ship-building will increase in value,\nsteam-boats will be wanted, the railroads projected across the Isthmus\nin various places, in Mexico and Central America will be pushed to\ncompletion, and we should not be surprised to see an active attempt\nmade, under the auspices of the Federal Government, to construct a\nrailroad across the continent, through the South Pass, from St. Louis,\nor some other point on the Mississippi, to San Francisco. The discovery\nof these great gold mines will no doubt form the agent of the greatest\nrevolution in the commercial centres of the world and on the\ncivilisation of the human race that has ever taken place since the\nfirst dawn of history. New York will henceforth, from its position to\nthe Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, probably in less than a quarter of a\ncentury, present a population greater than that of Paris, and display\nevidences of wealth, grandeur, magnificence, and industry, in an equal\nif not greater degree than what we see in London at this day. We expect\nthat, in the next twenty-five years, we shall make as rapid a march in\nthis metropolis, and in the neighbouring cities, as any city has done\nduring the last twenty-five centuries. There is no necessity for all\ngoing to California. Those who remain, and will raise produce,\nmanufacture goods, build ships, construct steam-engines, and advance\nthe Fine Arts, will enjoy the benefits of those discoveries to as great\nan extent as those who go to the Sacramento to dig for gold. All the\nresults of the labours of those diggers must come to this metropolis,\nswell its magnificence, and increase the intensity of its action in\ncommercial affairs. Even in a political point of view the discovery of\nthese wonderful gold mines in California, under the Government of the\nUnited States, will have a wonderful and astounding effect. We should\nnot be surprised to see, in a short time, all the old provinces of\nMexico, as far as the Isthmus of Darien, knocking for admission into\nthis union; while, on the other side, the British provinces of Canada,\nand even the Spanish island of Cuba, may be begging and praying to be\nlet in at the same time, and be permitted to enjoy some of the vast\nadvantages, and participate a little in the energy, which this vast\nconfederacy will exhibit to the astonished world.”",
        "DISORDERS IN THE GOLD DISTRICT.–Up to the close of the year the\naccounts were with few exceptions favourable to the morals and habits\nof the masses of adventurers congregated on the banks of the San\nFrancisco and the vicinity; subsequently the statements on these points\nbegan to change, and every letter noticed some robbery or murder,\ngenerally both, as of frequent occurrence, and at length they became so\ncommon that there was neither protection for life nor property. The\nfollowing ominous intelligence, which appeared in the Washington\nUnion (the organ of government), created an immense sensation. It was\nthe substance of a letter from San Francisco, dated the end of\nDecember, addressed to Commodore Jones. “This letter (according to the\nUnion) presents a desperate state of affairs as existing in\nCalifornia. Everything is getting worse as regards order and\ngovernment. Murders and robberies were not only daily events, but\noccurring hourly. Within six days more than twenty murders had been\nperpetrated. The people were preparing to organise a provisional\ngovernment in order to put a stop to these outrages. Within five days\nthree men have been hung by Lynch Law. The United States revenue laws\nare now in force, and will yield 400,000 dollars the first year. The\ninhabitants are opposed to paying taxes.”",
        "LATEST ACCOUNTS (from the New York Press.)–The desperate state of\naffairs in California is fully confirmed. Murders and robberies were\noccurring daily. The following are particulars supplied by Lieutenant\nLanman, of the United States navy, who had returned to New York, after\nhaving acted for a year past as collector at Monterey:–",
        "“Only about an hour before he left, he saw a man on board the\nflag-ship, just arrived from the mines, who confirmed the previous\nreports in regard to the discoveries on the river Staneslow, where he\nhad seen a single lump of gold weighing nine pounds, and heard of one\nthat weighed twenty pounds. The gold excitement in Monterey had\nentirely abated, the immense mineral wealth of the country being looked\nupon as an established fact. There was no disposition (except among the\nlandholders) to exaggerate. For a year past Lieutenant Lanman has been\nperforming the duties of collector at the port of Monterey; and, having\nseen every man who had returned from a visit to the mines, his\nopportunities for obtaining authentic information were better than if\nhe had visited the mines in person. He informs us that no large\namounts of gold dust or ore were selling at a sacrifice; he does not\nbelieve that one hundred ounces of the gold dust could have been\npurchased at the reported rate of eight dollars, the ordinary prices\nranging from ten to twelve dollars per ounce. The weekly receipts of\ngold at San Francisco were estimated at from thirty to fifty thousand\ndollars, and Lieutenant Lanman knew of one individual who had in his\npossession thirty thousand dollars’ worth of pure ore and dust. The\ncurrent value of gold in trade was sixteen dollars per ounce. There was\na scarcity of coin throughout the country; but when Lieutenant Lanman\narrived at Panama, he was informed that 600,000 dollars had just been\nshipped for California by certain Mexican gentlemen, and that the\nAmerican consul at Paita (Mr. Ruden) had in charge coin of the value of\n118,000 dollars, which he intends to exchange for ore and dust. Peru\nand Chili are not behind the United States in regard to the gold\nexcitement, no less than twenty vessels having sailed from these two\ncountries within a short time bound to San Francisco. They were all\nwell laden with provisions and other necessaries of life, and their\narrival would probably reduce the prices, which have heretofore been so\nexorbitant. The whole amount of gold collected at the washings since\nthe excitement first broke out is variously estimated–some put it down\nas high as 4,000,000 of dollars, but this I think is a little too\nhigh.”",
        "A private letter says the produce of a vineyard of 1,000 vines brought\n1,200 dollars; the vegetables of a garden of one acre, near San\nFrancisco, 1,500 dollars. A snow-storm had covered the gold-diggings,\nand the people were leaving, on account of sickness, intending to\nreturn in the spring, which is said to be the best season for the gold\nharvest. Labourers, according to one letter-writer, demanded a dollar\nan hour! Adventurers continued to arrive at San Francisco from all\nparts of the world; and several persons, who were reported to be laden\ndown with gold, were anxious to return to the United States, but could\nnot very readily find a conveyance, as the sailors deserted the ships\nimmediately on their arrival in port.",
        "CALIFORNIAN GOLD 250 YEARS AGO.–Pinkerton, in an account of Drake’s\ndiscovery of a part of California, to which he gave the name of New\nAlbion, states:–\"The country, too, if we can depend upon what Sir\nFrancis Drake or his chaplain say, may appear worth the seeking and the\nkeeping, since they assert that the land is so rich in gold and\nsilver, that upon the slightest turning it up with a spade or pick-axe,\nthese rich metals plainly appear mixed with the mould. It may be\nobjected that this looks a little fabulous; but to this two\nsatisfactory answers may be given: the first is, that later discoveries\non the same coast confirm the truth of it, which for anything I can see\nought to put the fact out of question; but if any doubts should remain,\nmy second answer should overturn these. For I say next, that the\ncountry of New Mexico lies directly behind New Albion, on the other\nside of a narrow bay, and in that country are the mines of Santa Fé,\nwhich are allowed to be the richest in the world; here, then, is a\nvaluable country, to which we have a very fair title.”",
        "EFFECTS OF THE CALIFORNIAN NEWS IN ENGLAND.–A glance at the\nadvertisements in the daily papers (says the Examiner) will show that\nthe public appetite for California is likely to be promptly met. The\nburden of the various vessels already announced as ready for immediate\ndeparture amounts to about 5,000 tons, distributed in ships ranging\nfrom 190 to 700 tons, to say nothing of the West India mail-steamer,\nwhich leaves on the 17th, carrying goods and passengers to Chagres, or\nof a “short and pleasant passage” advertised to Galveston, in Texas, as\na cheap route to the Pacific. The rates range from £25 upwards to suit\nall classes. Thus far, however, we have only the arrangements for those\nwho are able to move. The opportunities provided for those who wish to\nshare the advantages of the new region without its dangers are still\nmore ample. Indeed, so imposing are the plans for an extensive\ninvestment of capital for carrying on the trade in shares of £5 each,\nthat it would seem as if the first effect of the affair would be to\ncause a scarcity of money rather than an abundance. About a million and\na quarter sterling is already wanted, and the promoters stipulate for\nthe power of doubling the proposed amounts as occasion may offer. There\nis a “California Gold-Coast Trading Association;” a “California Gold\nMining, Streaming, and Washing Company;” a “California Steam Trading\nCompany,” a “California Gold and Trading Company;” and a “California\nGold Mining, etc., Trading Company.” The last of these alone will\nrequire £600,000 for its objects, but as half the shares are “to be\nreserved for the United States of America,” the drain upon our\nresources will be lessened to that extent. Some of the concerns propose\nto limit their operations to trading on the coast, sending out at the\nsame time “collecting and exploring parties” whenever the prospect may\nbe tempting. Others intend at once to get a grant from the legislature\nat Washington of such lands “as they may deem necessary,” while others\nintend to trust to chance, simply sending out a “practical” manager,\naccompanied by an adequate number of men “accustomed to the extraction\nof gold in all its forms.” Along with these advertisements are some of\na modified nature, to suit parties who may neither wish to go out with\na batch of emigrants, nor to stay at home and wait the results of a\npublic company. One “well-educated gentleman” seeks two others “to\nshare expenses with him.” Another wishes for a companion who would\nadvance £200, “one half to leave his wife, and the other half for\noutfit;” a third tells where “any respectable individuals with small\ncapital” may find persons willing to join them; a fourth states that\nrespectable persons having not less than £100 are wanted to complete a\nparty; and a fifth, that a “seafaring man is ready to go equal shares\nin purchasing a schooner to sail on speculation.” What number may be\nfound to answer those appeals it is impossible to conjecture. Common\nsense would say not one, but experience of what has been practised over\nand over again reminds us that the active parties on the present\noccasion are not calculating too largely upon the credulity of their\ncountrymen. That the country will be a pandemonium long before any one\ncan reach it from this side is hardly to be doubted, unless, indeed,\nthe United States government shall have been able to establish a\nblockade and cordon, in which case the new arrivals will have to get\nback as well as they can.",
        "PROBABLE EFFECT ON THE CURRENCY IN EUROPE.–In the description of gold\nmines, and rivers flowing over golden sands, we must be prepared for a\nlittle over-colouring. Such discoveries have always excited sanguine\nhopes, and dreams of exhaustless wealth; but if the accounts–and they\nreally appear well authenticated–of the golden treasures of California\nbe true, quantities of the most precious of all metals are found–not\nburied in mines, but scattered on the surface of the earth, and the\nfortunate adventurer may enrich himself beyond the dreams of avarice,\nalmost without labour, without capital, and with no care but that which\ncupidity generates. The principle that the value of the precious\nmetals, like other products of industry, is determined primarily by the\ncost of production, and then by scarcity, ideas of utility, and\nconvenience, seems to be neutralized by this new discovery; and it\nbecomes a curious question, how far it may affect the value of gold and\nsilver in Europe. If the abundance of gold flowing from America be such\nas to exceed the demand, the value of gold will fall, and the price of\nall other commodities relatively rise, and the relative proportion\nbetween gold and silver be disturbed so as to affect the standards of\nvalue in each country and the par of exchange between one and another.\nThe productiveness of the silver mines, there is no doubt, is greater\nand more regular than those of gold; but the enormous increase of the\nsilver currency on the Continent, in the United States, and even in\nIndia, and our own colonies, has kept the price of silver a little\nbelow five shillings an ounce. On the other hand the English standard\nof value being gold only, the drain of gold is generally towards\nEngland, while that of silver is towards the Continent. We do not doubt\nthat the English Mint price of gold, £3 17s. 10-1/2d. an ounce, and the\nprice at which the Bank of England are compelled to purchase, £3 17s.\n9d. an ounce, are causes which not only regulate, but, within certain\nlimits, determine, the price of gold throughout the world. Suppose, for\na moment, the circulation of England, exceeding thirty millions and the\nBank store of fifteen millions, to be thrown on the markets of Europe,\nby an alteration of the standard of value–how material would be the\nfall in price! It is equally obvious that England would be first and\nmost materially affected by any large and sudden production of her\nstandard of value; for though America would be enriched by the\ndiscovery of the precious metals within her own territories, it is only\nbecause she would possess a larger fund to exchange for more useful and\nnecessary products of labour. The value of silver would not fall,\nassuming the supply and demand to be equalised, but gold would fall in\nrelation to silver, and the existing proportion (about 15 to 1) could\nno longer be maintained. Then prices would rise of all articles now\nestimated in our currency–i.e. an ounce of gold would exchange for\nless than at present. And, assuming the price of silver to keep up as\nheretofore, about 5s. an ounce, our sovereign would be valued less in\nother countries, and all exchange operations would be sensibly\naffected. The only countervailing influence in the reduction of gold\nto, say, only double the price of silver, would be an increased\nconsumption in articles of taste and manufacture, which, however, can\nonly be speculative and uncertain. It is said by accounts from\nCalifornia that five hundred miles lie open to the avarice of\ngold-hunters, and that some adventurers have collected from 1,200 to\n1,800 dollars a-day; the probable average of each man’s earnings being\nfrom 8 to 10 dollars a-day, or, let us say, £2. The same authority\navers there is room and verge enough for the profitable working, to\nthat extent, of a hundred thousand persons. And it is likely enough\nbefore long that such a number may be tempted to seek their easily\nacquired fortune in the golden sands of El Sacramento and elsewhere.\nNow two pounds a-day for each man would amount to £200,000, which,\nmultiplied by 300 working days, will give £60,000,000 a-year! That is,\n£600,000,000 in ten years! A fearful amount of gold dust, and far more\nthan enough to disturb the equanimity of ten thousand political\neconomists. The gold utensils found among the simple-minded and\nphilosophic Peruvians (who wondered at the eager desire of Christians\nfor what they scarcely valued), will be esteemed trifles with our\ngolden palaces, and halls paved with gold, when California shall have\npoured this vast treasure into Europe. Assuming in round numbers each\n2,000 lbs., or troy ton, to be equivalent to £100,000 sterling, the\nabove amount in one year would represent six hundred tons, and in ten\nyears six thousand tons of gold! The imagination of all-plodding\nindustrious England is incapable of grasping so great an idea! Can\nthere be any doubt, then, of a revolution in the value of the precious\nmetals?",
        "PROHIBITION FROM THE GOVERNMENT.–It would seem that the government\nhave at length taken measures to preserve the gold districts from the\nbands of foreign adventurers who are daily pouring in from every\nquarter. Towards the end of January we learn that General Smith had\nbeen sent out by the United States government, with orders to enforce\nthe laws against all persons, not citizens of the States, who should be\nfound trespassing on the public lands. Official notice to this effect\nwas issued to the American consul at Panama and other places, in order\nthat emigrants on their way to California might be made aware of the\ndetermination of the government previous to their arrival. The\npunishment for illegal trespassing is fine and imprisonment. It was not\nknown, at the date of the last intelligence from California how this\nnotification, which makes such an important change in the prospects of\nthe numerous bodies now on their way thither, has been received by the\npopulation assembled at the land of promise.",
        "The following general view of the nature of the country which divides\nthe United States from California is taken from a narrative, published\nby Lieutenant Emory, of a journey from the Arkansas to the newly\nannexed territory of the United States.",
        "“The country,” says the lieutenant, “from the Arkansas to the Colorado,\na distance of over 1200 miles, in its adaptation to agriculture, has\npeculiarities which must for ever stamp itself upon the population\nwhich inhabits it. All North Mexico, embracing New Mexico, Chihuahua,\nSonora, and the Californias, as far north as the Sacramento, is, as far\nas the best information goes, the same in the physical character of its\nsurface, and differs but little in climate and products. In no part of\nthis vast tract can the rains from heaven be relied upon, to any\nextent, for the cultivation of the soil. The earth is destitute of\ntrees, and in great part also of any vegetation whatever. A few feeble\nstreams flow in different directions from the great mountains, which in\nmany places traverse this region. These streams are separated,\nsometimes by plains, and sometimes by mountains, without water and\nwithout vegetation, and may be called deserts, so far as they perform\nany useful part in the sustenance of animal life.",
        "“The whole extent of country, except on the margin of streams, is\ndestitute of forest trees. The Apaches, a very numerous race, and the\nNavajoes, are the chief occupants, but there are many minor bands, who,\nunlike the Apaches and Navajoes, are not nomadic, but have fixed\nhabitations. Amongst the most remarkable of these are the Soones, most\nof whom are said to be Albinoes. The latter cultivate the soil, and\nlive in peace with their more numerous and savage neighbours. Departing\nfrom the ford of the Colorado in the direction of Sonora, there is a\nfearful desert to encounter. Alter, a small town, with a Mexican\ngarrison, is the nearest settlement. All accounts concur in\nrepresenting the journey as one of extreme hardship, and even peril.\nThe distance is not exactly known, but it is variously represented at\nfrom four to seven days’ journey. Persons bound for Sonora from\nCalifornia, who do not mind a circuitous route, should ascend the Gila\nas far as the Pimos village, and thence penetrate the province by way\nof Tucson. At the ford, the Colorado is 1,500 feet wide, and flows at\nthe rate of a mile and a half per hour. Its greatest depth in the\nchannel, at the ford where we crossed, is four feet. The banks are low,\nnot more than four feet high, and, judging from indications, sometimes,\nthough not frequently, overflowed. Its general appearance at this point\nis much like that of the Arkansas, with its turbid waters and shifting\nsand islands.”",
        "The narrative of Lieut. Emory, of his journey from this point across\nthe Desert of California, becomes highly interesting and\ncharacteristic.",
        "“November 26.–The dawn of day found every man on horseback, and a\nbunch of grass from the Colorado tied behind him on the cantle of his\nsaddle. After getting well under way, the keen air at 26° Fahrenheit\nmade it most comfortable to walk. We travelled four miles along the\nsand butte, in a southern direction; we mounted the buttes and found a\nfirmer footing covered with fragments of lava, rounded by water, and\nmany agates. We were now fairly on the desert.",
        "“Our course now inclined a few degrees more to the north, and at 10,\nA.M., we found a large patch of grama, where we halted for an hour, and\nthen pursued our way over the plains covered with fragments of lava,\ntraversed at intervals by sand buttes, until 4, P.M., when, after\ntravelling 24 miles, we reached the Alamo or cotton-wood. At this\npoint, the Spaniards informed us, that, failing to find water, they had\ngone a league to the west, in pursuit of their horses, where they found\na running stream. We accordingly sent parties to search, but neither\nthe water nor their trail could be found. Neither was there any\ncotton-wood at the Alamo, as its name would signify; but it was\nnevertheless the place, the tree having probably been covered by the\nencroachments of the sand, which here terminates in a bluff 40 feet\nhigh, making the arc of a great circle convexing to the north.\nDescending this bluff, we found in what had been the channel of a\nstream, now overgrown with a few ill-conditioned mesquite, a large hole\nwhere persons had evidently dug for water. It was necessary to halt to\nrest our animals, and the time was occupied in deepening this hole,\nwhich, after a strong struggle, showed signs of water. An old champagne\nbasket, used by one of the officers as a pannier, was lowered in the\nhole, to prevent the crumbling of the sand. After many efforts to keep\nout the caving sand, a basket-work of willow twigs effected the object,\nand, much to the joy of all, the basket, which was now 15 or 20 feet\nbelow the surface, filled with water. The order was given for each mess\nto draw a kettle of water, and Captain Turner was placed in charge of\nthe spring, to see fair distribution.",
        "“When the messes were supplied, the firmness of the banks gave hopes\nthat the animals might be watered, and each party was notified to have\ntheir animals in waiting; the important business of watering then\ncommenced, upon the success of which depended the possibility of their\nadvancing with us a foot further. Two buckets for each animal were\nallowed. At 10, A.M., when my turn came, Captain Moore had succeeded,\nby great exertions, in opening another well, and the one already opened\nbegan to flow more freely, in consequence of which, we could afford to\ngive each animal as much as it could drink. The poor brutes, none of\nwhich had tasted water in forty-eight hours, and some not for the last\nsixty, clustered round the well and scrambled for precedence. At 12\no’clock I had watered all my animals, thirty-seven in number, and\nturned over the well to Captain Moore. The animals still had an aching\nvoid to fill, and all night was heard the munching of sticks, and their\npiteous cries for more congenial food.",
        "“November 27 and 28.–To-day we started a few minutes after sunrise.\nOur course was a winding one, to avoid the sand-drifts. The Mexicans\nhad informed us that the waters of the salt lake, some thirty or forty\nmiles distant, were too salt to use, but other information led us to\nthink the intelligence was wrong. We accordingly tried to reach it;\nabout 3, P.M., we disengaged ourselves from the sand, and went due\n(magnetic) west, over an immense level of clay detritus, hard and\nsmooth as a bowling-green. The desert was almost destitute of\nvegetation; now and then an Ephedra, Oenothera, or bunches of Aristida\nwere seen, and occasionally the level was covered with a growth of\nObione canescens, and a low bush with small oval plaited leaves,\nunknown. The heavy sand had proved too much for many horses and some\nmules, and all the efforts of their drivers could bring them no further\nthan the middle of this desert. About 8 o’clock, as we approached the\nlake, the stench of dead animals confirmed the reports of the Mexicans,\nand put to flight all hopes of being able to use the water.",
        "“The basin of the lake, as well as I could judge at night, is about\nthree-quarters of a mile long and half a mile wide. The water had\nreceded to a pool, diminished to one half its size, and the approach to\nit, was through a thick soapy quagmire. It was wholly unfit for man or\nbrute, and we studiously kept the latter from it, thinking that the use\nof it would but aggravate their thirst. One or two of the men came in\nlate, and, rushing to the lake, threw themselves down and took many\nswallows before discovering their mistake; but the effect was not\ninjurious except that it increased their thirst. A few mezquite trees\nand a chenopodiaceous shrub bordered the lake, and on these our mules\nmunched till they had sufficiently refreshed themselves, when the call\nto saddle was sounded, and we groped silently our way in the dark. The\nstoutest animals now began to stagger, and when day dawned scarcely a\nman was seen mounted.",
        "“With the sun rose a heavy fog from the south-west, no doubt from the\ngulf, and, sweeping towards us, enveloped us for two or three hours,\nwetting our blankets and giving relief to the animals. Before it had\ndisappeared we came to a patch of sun-burned grass. When the fog had\nentirely dispersed we found ourselves entering a gap in the mountains,\nwhich had been before us for four days. The plain was crossed, but we\nhad not yet found water. The first valley we reached was dry, and it\nwas not till 12 o’clock, M., that we struck the Cariso (cane) creek,\nwithin half a mile of one of its sources, and although so close to the\nsource, the sands had already absorbed much of its water, and left but\nlittle running. A mile or two below, the creek entirely disappears. We\nhalted, having made fifty-four miles in the two days, at the source, a\nmagnificent spring, twenty or thirty feet in diameter, highly\nimpregnated with sulphur, and medicinal in its properties.",
        "“The desert over which we had passed, ninety miles from water to water,\nis an immense triangular plain, bounded on one side by the Colorado, on\nthe west by the Cordilleras of California, the coast chain of mountains\nwhich now encircles us, extending from the Sacramento river to the\nsouthern extremity of Lower California, and on the north-east by a\nchain of mountains, running southeast and northwest. It is chiefly\ncovered with floating sand, the surface of which in various places is\nwhite, with diminutive spinelas, and everywhere over the whole surface\nis found the large and soft muscle shell. I have noted the only two\npatches of grass found during the ’jornada.’ There were scattered, at\nwide intervals, the Palafoxia linearis, Atriplex, Encelia farinosa,\nDaleas, Euphorbias, and a Simsia, described by Dr. Torrey as a new\nspecies.",
        "“The southern termination of this desert is bounded by the Tecaté chain\nof mountains and the Colorado; but its northern and eastern boundaries\nare undefined, and I should suppose from the accounts of trappers, and\nothers, who have attempted the passage from California to the Gila by a\nmore northern route, that it extends many days’ travel beyond the chain\nof barren mountains which bound the horizon in that direction. The\nportal to the mountains through which we passed was formed by immense\nbuttes of yellow clay and sand, with large flakes of mica and seams of\ngypsum. Nothing could be more forlorn and desolate in appearance. The\ngypsum had given some consistency to the sand buttes, which were washed\ninto fantastic figures. One ridge formed apparently a complete circle,\ngiving it the appearance of a crater; and although some miles to the\nleft, I should have gone to visit it, supposing it to be a crater, but\nmy mule was sinking with thirst, and water was yet at some distance.\nMany animals were left on the road to die of thirst and hunger, in\nspite of the generous efforts of the men to bring them to the spring.\nMore than one was brought up, by one man tugging at the halter and\nanother pushing up the brute, by placing his shoulder against its\nbuttocks. Our most serious loss, perhaps, was that of one or two fat\nmares and colts brought with us for food; for, before leaving camp,\nMajor Swords found in a concealed place one of the best pack mules\nslaughtered, and the choice bits cut from his shoulders and flanks,\nstealthily done by some mess less provident than others.",
        "“Nov. 29.–The grass at the spring was anything but desirable for our\nhorses, and there was scarcely a ration left for the men. This last\nconsideration would not prevent our giving the horses a day’s rest\nwherever grass could be found. We followed the dry sandy bed of the\nCariso nearly all day, at a snail’s pace, and at length reached the\n’little pools’ where the grass was luxuriant but very salt. The water\nstrongly resembled that at the head of the Cariso creek, and the earth,\nwhich was very tremulous for many acres about the pools, was covered\nwith salt. This valley is not more than half a mile wide, and on each\nside are mountains of grey granite and pure quartz, rising from 1,000\nto 3,000 feet above it.",
        "“We rode for miles through thickets of the centennial plant, Agave\nAmericana, and found one in full bloom. The sharp thorns terminating\nevery leaf of this plant were a great annoyance to our dismounted and\nwearied men, whose legs were now almost bare. A number of these plants\nwere cut by the soldiers, and the body of them used as food. The day\nwas intensely hot, and the sand deep; the animals, inflated with water\nand rushes, gave way by scores; and although we advanced only sixteen\nmiles, many did not arrive at camp until 10 o’clock at night. It was a\nfeast day for the wolves, which followed in packs close on our track,\nseizing our deserted brutes, and making the air resound with their\nhowls as they battled for the carcases.",
        "“December 12.–We followed the Solidad through a deep fertile valley\nin the shape of a cross. Here we ascended to the left a steep hill to\nthe table lands, which, keeping for a few miles, we descended into a\nwaterless valley, leading into False Bay at a point distant two or\nthree miles from San Diego. At this place we were in view of the fort\noverlooking the town of San Diego and the barren waste which surrounds\nit.",
        "“The town consists of a few adobe houses, two or three of which only\nhave plank floors. It is situated at the foot of a high hill on a sand\nflat, two miles wide, reaching from the head of San Diego Bay to False\nBay. A high promontory, of nearly the same width, runs into the sea\nfour or five miles, and is connected by the flat with the main land.\nThe road to the hide-houses leads on the east side of this promontory,\nand abreast of them the frigate Congress and the sloop Portsmouth are\nat anchor. The hide-houses are a collection of store-houses where the\nhides of cattle are packed before being shipped, this article forming\nthe only trade of the little town.",
        "“The bay is a narrow arm of the sea indenting the land some four or\nfive miles, easily defended, and having twenty feet of water at the\nlowest tide. The rise is five feet, making the greatest water\ntwenty-five feet.",
        "“Standing on the hill which overlooks the town, and looking to the\nnorth-east, I saw the mission of San Diego, a fine large building now\ndeserted. The Rio San Diego runs under ground in a direct course from\nthe mission to the town, and, sweeping around the hill, discharges\nitself into the bay. Its original debouche was into False bay, where,\nmeeting the waters rolling in from the seaward, a bar was formed by the\ndeposit of sand, making the entrance of False Bay impracticable.",
        "“January 2.–Six and a half miles’ march brought us to the deserted\nmission of San Luis Rey. The keys of this mission were in charge of the\nalcalde of the Indian village, a mile distant. He was at the door to\nreceive us and deliver up possession. There we halted for the day, to\nlet the sailors, who suffered dreadfully from sore feet, recruit a\nlittle. This building is one which, for magnitude, convenience, and\ndurability of architecture, would do honour to any country.",
        "“The walls are adobe, and the roofs of well-made tile. It was built\nabout sixty years since by the Indians of the country, under the\nguidance of a zealous priest. At that time the Indians were very\nnumerous, and under the absolute sway of the missionaries. These\nmissionaries at one time bid fair to christianize the Indians of\nCalifornia. Under grants from the Mexican government, they collected\nthem into missions, built immense houses, and began successfully to\ntill the soil by the hands of the Indians for the benefit of the\nIndians.",
        "“The habits of the priests, and the avarice of the military rulers of\nthe territory, however, soon converted these missions into instruments\nof oppression and slavery of the Indian race.",
        "“The revolution of 1836 saw the downfall of the priests, and most of\nthese missions passed by fraud into the hands of private individuals,\nand with them the Indians were transferred as serfs of the land.",
        "“This race, which, in our country, has never been reduced to slavery,\nis in that degraded condition throughout California, and does the only\nlabour performed in the country. Nothing can exceed their present\ndegradation.”",
        "The general closing remarks of Lieutenant Emory are as follow:",
        "“The region extending from the head of the Gulf of California to the\nparallel of the Pueblo, or Ciudad de los Angeles, is the only portion\nnot heretofore covered by my own notes and journal, or by the notes and\njournals of other scientific expeditions fitted out by the United\nStates. The journals and published accounts of these several\nexpeditions combined will give definite ideas of all those portions of\nCalifornia susceptible of cultivation or settlement. From this remark\nis to be excepted the vast basin watered by the Colorado, and the\ncountry lying between that river and the range of Cordilleras,\nrepresented as running east of the Tulare lakes, and south of the\nparallel of 36°, and the country between the Colorado and Gila rivers.",
        "“Of these regions nothing is known except from the reports of trappers,\nand the speculations of geologists. As far as these accounts go, all\nconcur in representing it as a waste of sand and rock, unadorned with\nvegetation, poorly watered, and unfit, it is believed, for any of the\nuseful purposes of life. A glance at the map will show what an immense\narea is embraced in these boundaries; and, notwithstanding the oral\naccounts in regard to it, it is difficult to bring the mind to the\nbelief in the existence of such a sea of waste and desert; when every\nother grand division of the earth presents some prominent feature in\nthe economy of nature, administering to the wants of man. Possibly this\nunexplored region may be filled with valuable minerals.",
        "“Where irrigation can be had in this country, the produce of the soil\nis abundant beyond description. All the grains and fruits of the\ntemperate zones, and many of those of the tropical, flourish\nluxuriantly. Descending from the heights of San Barnardo to the Pacific\none meets every degree of temperature. Near the coast, the winds\nprevailing from the south-west in winter, and from the north-west in\nsummer, produce a great uniformity of temperature, and the climate is\nperhaps unsurpassed in salubrity. With the exception of a very few\ncases of ague and fever of a mild type, sickness is unknown.",
        "“The season of the year at which we visited the country was\nunfavourable to obtaining a knowledge of its botany. The vegetation,\nmostly deciduous, had gone to decay, and no flowers nor seeds were\ncollected. The country generally is entirely destitute of trees. Along\nthe principal range of the mountains are a few live oaks, sycamore and\npine; now and then, but very rarely, the sycamore and cotton-wood occur\nin the champaign country, immediately on the margins of the streams.\nWild oats everywhere cover the surface of the hills, and these, with\nthe wild mustard and carrots, furnish good pasturage to the immense\nherds of cattle which form the staple of California. Of the many fruits\ncapable of being produced with success, by culture and irrigation, the\ngrape is perhaps that which is brought nearest to perfection.\nExperienced wine-growers and Europeans, pronounce this portion of\nCalifornia unequalled for the quality of its wines.”",
