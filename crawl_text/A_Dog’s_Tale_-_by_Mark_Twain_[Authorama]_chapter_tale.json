        "My father was a St. Bernard, my mother was a collie, but I am a\nPresbyterian.  This is what my mother told me, I do not know these nice\ndistinctions myself.  To me they are only fine large words meaning\nnothing.  My mother had a fondness for such; she liked to say them, and\nsee other dogs look surprised and envious, as wondering how she got so\nmuch education.  But, indeed, it was not real education; it was only\nshow: she got the words by listening in the dining-room and drawing-room\nwhen there was company, and by going with the children to Sunday-school\nand listening there; and whenever she heard a large word she said it over\nto herself many times, and so was able to keep it until there was a\ndogmatic gathering in the neighborhood, then she would get it off, and\nsurprise and distress them all, from pocket-pup to mastiff, which\nrewarded her for all her trouble.  If there was a stranger he was nearly\nsure to be suspicious, and when he got his breath again he would ask her\nwhat it meant.  And she always told him.  He was never expecting this but\nthought he would catch her; so when she told him, he was the one that\nlooked ashamed, whereas he had thought it was going to be she.  The\nothers were always waiting for this, and glad of it and proud of her, for\nthey knew what was going to happen, because they had had experience.\nWhen she told the meaning of a big word they were all so taken up with\nadmiration that it never occurred to any dog to doubt if it was the right\none; and that was natural, because, for one thing, she answered up so\npromptly that it seemed like a dictionary speaking, and for another\nthing, where could they find out whether it was right or not? for she was\nthe only cultivated dog there was.  By and by, when I was older, she\nbrought home the word Unintellectual, one time, and worked it pretty hard\nall the week at different gatherings, making much unhappiness and\ndespondency; and it was at this time that I noticed that during that week\nshe was asked for the meaning at eight different assemblages, and flashed\nout a fresh definition every time, which showed me that she had more\npresence of mind than culture, though I said nothing, of course.  She had\none word which she always kept on hand, and ready, like a life-preserver,\na kind of emergency word to strap on when she was likely to get washed\noverboard in a sudden way—that was the word Synonymous.  When she\nhappened to fetch out a long word which had had its day weeks before and\nits prepared meanings gone to her dump-pile, if there was a stranger\nthere of course it knocked him groggy for a couple of minutes, then he\nwould come to, and by that time she would be away down wind on another\ntack, and not expecting anything; so when he’d hail and ask her to cash\nin, I (the only dog on the inside of her game) could see her canvas\nflicker a moment— but only just a moment—then it would belly out taut\nand full, and she would say, as calm as a summer’s day, “It’s synonymous\nwith supererogation,” or some godless long reptile of a word like that,\nand go placidly about and skim away on the next tack, perfectly\ncomfortable, you know, and leave that stranger looking profane and\nembarrassed, and the initiated slatting the floor with their tails in\nunison and their faces transfigured with a holy joy.",
        "And it was the same with phrases.  She would drag home a whole phrase, if\nit had a grand sound, and play it six nights and two matinees, and\nexplain it a new way every time—which she had to, for all she cared for\nwas the phrase; she wasn’t interested in what it meant, and knew those\ndogs hadn’t wit enough to catch her, anyway.  Yes, she was a daisy!  She\ngot so she wasn’t afraid of anything, she had such confidence in the\nignorance of those creatures.  She even brought anecdotes that she had\nheard the family and the dinner-guests laugh and shout over; and as a\nrule she got the nub of one chestnut hitched onto another chestnut,\nwhere, of course, it didn’t fit and hadn’t any point; and when she\ndelivered the nub she fell over and rolled on the floor and laughed and\nbarked in the most insane way, while I could see that she was wondering\nto herself why it didn’t seem as funny as it did when she first heard it.\nBut no harm was done; the others rolled and barked too, privately ashamed\nof themselves for not seeing the point, and never suspecting that the\nfault was not with them and there wasn’t any to see.",
        "You can see by these things that she was of a rather vain and frivolous\ncharacter; still, she had virtues, and enough to make up, I think.  She\nhad a kind heart and gentle ways, and never harbored resentments for\ninjuries done her, but put them easily out of her mind and forgot them;\nand she taught her children her kindly way, and from her we learned also\nto be brave and prompt in time of danger, and not to run away, but face\nthe peril that threatened friend or stranger, and help him the best we\ncould without stopping to think what the cost might be to us.  And she\ntaught us not by words only, but by example, and that is the best way and\nthe surest and the most lasting.  Why, the brave things she did, the\nsplendid things! she was just a soldier; and so modest about it—well,\nyou couldn’t help admiring her, and you couldn’t help imitating her; not\neven a King Charles spaniel could remain entirely despicable in her\nsociety.  So, as you see, there was more to her than her education.",
        "When I was well grown, at last, I was sold and taken away, and I never\nsaw her again.  She was broken-hearted, and so was I, and we cried; but\nshe comforted me as well as she could, and said we were sent into this\nworld for a wise and good purpose, and must do our duties without\nrepining, take our life as we might find it, live it for the best good of\nothers, and never mind about the results; they were not our affair.  She\nsaid men who did like this would have a noble and beautiful reward by and\nby in another world, and although we animals would not go there, to do\nwell and right without reward would give to our brief lives a worthiness\nand dignity which in itself would be a reward.  She had gathered these\nthings from time to time when she had gone to the Sunday-school with the\nchildren, and had laid them up in her memory more carefully than she had\ndone with those other words and phrases; and she had studied them deeply,\nfor her good and ours.  One may see by this that she had a wise and\nthoughtful head, for all there was so much lightness and vanity in it.",
        "So we said our farewells, and looked our last upon each other through our\ntears; and the last thing she said—keeping it for the last to make me\nremember it the better, I think—was, “In memory of me, when there is a\ntime of danger to another do not think of yourself, think of your mother,\nand do as she would do.”",
        "Do you think I could forget that?  No.",
        "It was such a charming home!—my new one; a fine great house, with\npictures, and delicate decorations, and rich furniture, and no gloom\nanywhere, but all the wilderness of dainty colors lit up with flooding\nsunshine; and the spacious grounds around it, and the great garden—oh,\ngreensward, and noble trees, and flowers, no end!  And I was the same as\na member of the family; and they loved me, and petted me, and did not\ngive me a new name, but called me by my old one that was dear to me\nbecause my mother had given it me— Aileen Mavourneen.  She got it out of\na song; and the Grays knew that song, and said it was a beautiful name.",
        "Mrs. Gray was thirty, and so sweet and so lovely, you cannot imagine it;\nand Sadie was ten, and just like her mother, just a darling slender\nlittle copy of her, with auburn tails down her back, and short frocks;\nand the baby was a year old, and plump and dimpled, and fond of me, and\nnever could get enough of hauling on my tail, and hugging me, and\nlaughing out its innocent happiness; and Mr. Gray was thirty-eight, and\ntall and slender and handsome, a little bald in front, alert, quick in\nhis movements, business-like, prompt, decided, unsentimental, and with\nthat kind of trim-chiseled face that just seems to glint and sparkle with\nfrosty intellectuality!  He was a renowned scientist.  I do not know what\nthe word means, but my mother would know how to use it and get effects.\nShe would know how to depress a rat-terrier with it and make a lap-dog\nlook sorry he came.  But that is not the best one; the best one was\nLaboratory.  My mother could organize a Trust on that one that would skin\nthe tax-collars off the whole herd.  The laboratory was not a book, or a\npicture, or a place to wash your hands in, as the college president’s dog\nsaid—no, that is the lavatory; the laboratory is quite different, and is\nfilled with jars, and bottles, and electrics, and wires, and strange\nmachines; and every week other scientists came there and sat in the\nplace, and used the machines, and discussed, and made what they called\nexperiments and discoveries; and often I came, too, and stood around and\nlistened, and tried to learn, for the sake of my mother, and in loving\nmemory of her, although it was a pain to me, as realizing what she was\nlosing out of her life and I gaining nothing at all; for try as I might,\nI was never able to make anything out of it at all.",
        "Other times I lay on the floor in the mistress’s work-room and slept, she\ngently using me for a foot-stool, knowing it pleased me, for it was a\ncaress; other times I spent an hour in the nursery, and got well tousled\nand made happy; other times I watched by the crib there, when the baby\nwas asleep and the nurse out for a few minutes on the baby’s affairs;\nother times I romped and raced through the grounds and the garden with\nSadie till we were tired out, then slumbered on the grass in the shade of\na tree while she read her book; other times I went visiting among the\nneighbor dogs— for there were some most pleasant ones not far away, and\none very handsome and courteous and graceful one, a curly-haired Irish\nsetter by the name of Robin Adair, who was a Presbyterian like me, and\nbelonged to the Scotch minister.",
        "The servants in our house were all kind to me and were fond of me, and\nso, as you see, mine was a pleasant life.  There could not be a happier\ndog that I was, nor a gratefuller one.  I will say this for myself, for\nit is only the truth:  I tried in all ways to do well and right, and\nhonor my mother’s memory and her teachings, and earn the happiness that\nhad come to me, as best I could.",
        "By and by came my little puppy, and then my cup was full, my happiness\nwas perfect.  It was the dearest little waddling thing, and so smooth and\nsoft and velvety, and had such cunning little awkward paws, and such\naffectionate eyes, and such a sweet and innocent face; and it made me so\nproud to see how the children and their mother adored it, and fondled it,\nand exclaimed over every little wonderful thing it did.  It did seem to\nme that life was just too lovely to—",
        "Then came the winter.  One day I was standing a watch in the nursery.\nThat is to say, I was asleep on the bed.  The baby was asleep in the\ncrib, which was alongside the bed, on the side next the fireplace.  It\nwas the kind of crib that has a lofty tent over it made of gauzy stuff\nthat you can see through.  The nurse was out, and we two sleepers were\nalone.  A spark from the wood-fire was shot out, and it lit on the slope\nof the tent.  I suppose a quiet interval followed, then a scream from the\nbaby awoke me, and there was that tent flaming up toward the ceiling!\nBefore I could think, I sprang to the floor in my fright, and in a second\nwas half-way to the door; but in the next half-second my mother’s\nfarewell was sounding in my ears, and I was back on the bed again.\nI reached my head through the flames and dragged the baby out by the\nwaist-band, and tugged it along, and we fell to the floor together in a\ncloud of smoke; I snatched a new hold, and dragged the screaming little\ncreature along and out at the door and around the bend of the hall, and\nwas still tugging away, all excited and happy and proud, when the\nmaster’s voice shouted:",
        "“Begone you cursed beast!” and I jumped to save myself; but he was\nfuriously quick, and chased me up, striking furiously at me with his\ncane, I dodging this way and that, in terror, and at last a strong blow\nfell upon my left foreleg, which made me shriek and fall, for the moment,\nhelpless; the came went up for another blow, but never descended, for the\nnurse’s voice rang wildly out, “The nursery’s on fire!” and the master\nrushed away in that direction, and my other bones were saved.",
        "The pain was cruel, but, no matter, I must not lose any time; he might\ncome back at any moment; so I limped on three legs to the other end of\nthe hall, where there was a dark little stairway leading up into a garret\nwhere old boxes and such things were kept, as I had heard say, and where\npeople seldom went.  I managed to climb up there, then I searched my way\nthrough the dark among the piles of things, and hid in the secretest\nplace I could find.  It was foolish to be afraid there, yet still I was;\nso afraid that I held in and hardly even whimpered, though it would have\nbeen such a comfort to whimper, because that eases the pain, you know.\nBut I could lick my leg, and that did some good.",
        "For half an hour there was a commotion downstairs, and shoutings, and\nrushing footsteps, and then there was quiet again.  Quiet for some\nminutes, and that was grateful to my spirit, for then my fears began to\ngo down; and fears are worse than pains—oh, much worse.  Then came a\nsound that froze me.  They were calling me—calling me by name—hunting\nfor me!",
        "It was muffled by distance, but that could not take the terror out of it,\nand it was the most dreadful sound to me that I had ever heard.  It went\nall about, everywhere, down there:  along the halls, through all the\nrooms, in both stories, and in the basement and the cellar; then outside,\nand farther and farther away—then back, and all about the house again,\nand I thought it would never, never stop.  But at last it did, hours and\nhours after the vague twilight of the garret had long ago been blotted\nout by black darkness.",
        "Then in that blessed stillness my terrors fell little by little away, and\nI was at peace and slept.  It was a good rest I had, but I woke before\nthe twilight had come again.  I was feeling fairly comfortable, and I\ncould think out a plan now.  I made a very good one; which was, to creep\ndown, all the way down the back stairs, and hide behind the cellar door,\nand slip out and escape when the iceman came at dawn, while he was inside\nfilling the refrigerator; then I would hide all day, and start on my\njourney when night came; my journey to—well, anywhere where they would\nnot know me and betray me to the master.  I was feeling almost cheerful\nnow; then suddenly I thought:  Why, what would life be without my puppy!",
        "That was despair.  There was no plan for me; I saw that; I must say where\nI was; stay, and wait, and take what might come—it was not my affair;\nthat was what life is—my mother had said it.  Then—well, then the\ncalling began again!  All my sorrows came back.  I said to myself, the\nmaster will never forgive.  I did not know what I had done to make him so\nbitter and so unforgiving, yet I judged it was something a dog could not\nunderstand, but which was clear to a man and dreadful.",
        "They called and called—days and nights, it seemed to me.  So long that\nthe hunger and thirst near drove me mad, and I recognized that I was\ngetting very weak.  When you are this way you sleep a great deal, and I\ndid.  Once I woke in an awful fright—it seemed to me that the calling\nwas right there in the garret!  And so it was:  it was Sadie’s voice, and\nshe was crying; my name was falling from her lips all broken, poor thing,\nand I could not believe my ears for the joy of it when I heard her say:",
        "“Come back to us—oh, come back to us, and forgive—it is all so sad\nwithout our—”",
        "I broke in with such a grateful little yelp, and the next moment Sadie\nwas plunging and stumbling through the darkness and the lumber and\nshouting for the family to hear, “She’s found, she’s found!”",
        " The days that followed—well, they were wonderful.  The mother and Sadie\nand the servants—why, they just seemed to worship me.  They couldn’t\nseem to make me a bed that was fine enough; and as for food, they\ncouldn’t be satisfied with anything but game and delicacies that were out\nof season; and every day the friends and neighbors flocked in to hear\nabout my heroism—that was the name they called it by, and it means\nagriculture.  I remember my mother pulling it on a kennel once, and\nexplaining it in that way, but didn’t say what agriculture was, except\nthat it was synonymous with intramural incandescence; and a dozen times a\nday Mrs. Gray and Sadie would tell the tale to new-comers, and say I\nrisked my life to say the baby’s, and both of us had burns to prove it,\nand then the company would pass me around and pet me and exclaim about\nme, and you could see the pride in the eyes of Sadie and her mother; and\nwhen the people wanted to know what made me limp, they looked ashamed and\nchanged the subject, and sometimes when people hunted them this way and\nthat way with questions about it, it looked to me as if they were going\nto cry.",
        "And this was not all the glory; no, the master’s friends came, a whole\ntwenty of the most distinguished people, and had me in the laboratory,\nand discussed me as if I was a kind of discovery; and some of them said\nit was wonderful in a dumb beast, the finest exhibition of instinct they\ncould call to mind; but the master said, with vehemence, “It’s far above\ninstinct; it’s reason, and many a man, privileged to be saved and go with\nyou and me to a better world by right of its possession, has less of it\nthat this poor silly quadruped that’s foreordained to perish\"; and then\nhe laughed, and said:  “Why, look at me—I’m a sarcasm! bless you, with\nall my grand intelligence, the only think I inferred was that the dog had\ngone mad and was destroying the child, whereas but for the beast’s\nintelligence—it’s reason, I tell you!—the child would have perished!”",
        "They disputed and disputed, and I was the very center of subject of it\nall, and I wished my mother could know that this grand honor had come to\nme; it would have made her proud.",
        "Then they discussed optics, as they called it, and whether a certain\ninjury to the brain would produce blindness or not, but they could not\nagree about it, and said they must test it by experiment by and by; and\nnext they discussed plants, and that interested me, because in the summer\nSadie and I had planted seeds—I helped her dig the holes, you know—and\nafter days and days a little shrub or a flower came up there, and it was\na wonder how that could happen; but it did, and I wished I could talk—I\nwould have told those people about it and shown then how much I knew, and\nbeen all alive with the subject; but I didn’t care for the optics; it was\ndull, and when the came back to it again it bored me, and I went to\nsleep.",
        "Pretty soon it was spring, and sunny and pleasant and lovely, and the\nsweet mother and the children patted me and the puppy good-by, and went\naway on a journey and a visit to their kin, and the master wasn’t any\ncompany for us, but we played together and had good times, and the\nservants were kind and friendly, so we got along quite happily and\ncounted the days and waited for the family.",
        "And one day those men came again, and said, now for the test, and they\ntook the puppy to the laboratory, and I limped three-leggedly along, too,\nfeeling proud, for any attention shown to the puppy was a pleasure to me,\nof course.  They discussed and experimented, and then suddenly the puppy\nshrieked, and they set him on the floor, and he went staggering around,\nwith his head all bloody, and the master clapped his hands and shouted:",
        "“There, I’ve won—confess it!  He’s a blind as a bat!”",
        "And they all said:",
        "“It’s so—you’ve proved your theory, and suffering humanity owes you a\ngreat debt from henceforth,” and they crowded around him, and wrung his\nhand cordially and thankfully, and praised him.",
        "But I hardly saw or heard these things, for I ran at once to my little\ndarling, and snuggled close to it where it lay, and licked the blood, and\nit put its head against mine, whimpering softly, and I knew in my heart\nit was a comfort to it in its pain and trouble to feel its mother’s\ntouch, though it could not see me.  Then it dropped down, presently, and\nits little velvet nose rested upon the floor, and it was still, and did\nnot move any more.",
        "Soon the master stopped discussing a moment, and rang in the footman, and\nsaid, “Bury it in the far corner of the garden,” and then went on with\nthe discussion, and I trotted after the footman, very happy and grateful,\nfor I knew the puppy was out of its pain now, because it was asleep.  We\nwent far down the garden to the farthest end, where the children and the\nnurse and the puppy and I used to play in the summer in the shade of a\ngreat elm, and there the footman dug a hole, and I saw he was going to\nplant the puppy, and I was glad, because it would grow and come up a fine\nhandsome dog, like Robin Adair, and be a beautiful surprise for the\nfamily when they came home; so I tried to help him dig, but my lame leg\nwas no good, being stiff, you know, and you have to have two, or it is no\nuse.  When the footman had finished and covered little Robin up, he\npatted my head, and there were tears in his eyes, and he said:  “Poor\nlittle doggie, you saved his child!”",
        "I have watched two whole weeks, and he doesn’t come up!  This last week a\nfright has been stealing upon me.  I think there is something terrible\nabout this.  I do not know what it is, but the fear makes me sick, and I\ncannot eat, though the servants bring me the best of food; and they pet\nme so, and even come in the night, and cry, and say, “Poor doggie—do\ngive it up and come home; don’t break our hearts!” and all this terrifies\nme the more, and makes me sure something has happened.  And I am so weak;\nsince yesterday I cannot stand on my feet anymore.  And within this hour\nthe servants, looking toward the sun where it was sinking out of sight\nand the night chill coming on, said things I could not understand, but\nthey carried something cold to my heart.",
        "“Those poor creatures!  They do not suspect.  They will come home in the\nmorning, and eagerly ask for the little doggie that did the brave deed,\nand who of us will be strong enough to say the truth to them:  ’The\nhumble little friend is gone where go the beasts that perish.’”",
