        "No one would have believed in the last years of the\nnineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly\nand closely by intelligences greater than man’s and yet as\nmortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their\nvarious concerns they were scrutinised and studied, perhaps\nalmost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scru-\ntinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a\ndrop of water.  With infinite complacency men went to and\nfro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their\nassurance of their empire over matter.  It is possible that the\ninfusoria under the microscope do the same.  No one gave\na thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human\ndanger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life\nupon them as impossible or improbable.  It is curious to recall\nsome of the mental habits of those departed days.  At most\nterrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon Mars,\nperhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a mis-\nsionary enterprise.  Yet across the gulf of space, minds that\nare to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish,\nintellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this\nearth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their\nplans against us.  And early in the twentieth century came\nthe great disillusionment.",
        "The planet Mars, I scarcely need remind the reader, re-\nvolves about the sun at a mean distance of 140,000,000 miles,\nand the light and heat it receives from the sun is barely half\nof that received by this world.  It must be, if the nebular\nhypothesis has any truth, older than our world; and long\nbefore this earth ceased to be molten, life upon its surface\nmust have begun its course.  The fact that it is scarcely\none seventh of the volume of the earth must have accelerated\nits cooling to the temperature at which life could begin.  It\nhas air and water and all that is necessary for the support of\nanimated existence.",
        "Yet so vain is man, and so blinded by his vanity, that no\nwriter, up to the very end of the nineteenth century, ex-\npressed any idea that intelligent life might have developed\nthere far, or indeed at all, beyond its earthly level.  Nor was\nit generally understood that since Mars is older than our earth,\nwith scarcely a quarter of the superficial area and remoter\nfrom the sun, it necessarily follows that it is not only more\ndistant from time’s beginning but nearer its end.",
        "The secular cooling that must someday overtake our planet\nhas already gone far indeed with our neighbour.  Its physical\ncondition is still largely a mystery, but we know now that\neven in its equatorial region the midday temperature barely\napproaches that of our coldest winter.  Its air is much more\nattenuated than ours, its oceans have shrunk until they cover\nbut a third of its surface, and as its slow seasons change huge\nsnowcaps gather and melt about either pole and periodically\ninundate its temperate zones.  That last stage of exhaustion,\nwhich to us is still incredibly remote, has become a present-\nday problem for the inhabitants of Mars.  The immediate\npressure of necessity has brightened their intellects, enlarged\ntheir powers, and hardened their hearts.  And looking across\nspace with instruments, and intelligences such as we have\nscarcely dreamed of, they see, at its nearest distance only\n35,000,000 of miles sunward of them, a morning star of hope,\nour own warmer planet, green with vegetation and grey with\nwater, with a cloudy atmosphere eloquent of fertility, with\nglimpses through its drifting cloud wisps of broad stretches\nof populous country and narrow, navy-crowded seas.",
        "And we men, the creatures who inhabit this earth, must\nbe to them at least as alien and lowly as are the monkeys\nand lemurs to us.  The intellectual side of man already admits\nthat life is an incessant struggle for existence, and it would\nseem that this too is the belief of the minds upon Mars.\nTheir world is far gone in its cooling and this world is still\ncrowded with life, but crowded only with what they regard\nas inferior animals.  To carry warfare sunward is, indeed, their\nonly escape from the destruction that, generation after gener-\nation, creeps upon them.",
        "And before we judge of them too harshly we must remem-\nber what ruthless and utter destruction our own species has\nwrought, not only upon animals, such as the vanished bison\nand the dodo, but upon its inferior races.  The Tasmanians,\nin spite of their human likeness, were entirely swept out of\nexistence in a war of extermination waged by European immi-\ngrants, in the space of fifty years.  Are we such apostles of\nmercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the same\nspirit?",
        "The Martians seem to have calculated their descent with\namazing subtlety--their mathematical learning is evidently\nfar in excess of ours--and to have carried out their prepara-\ntions with a well-nigh perfect unanimity.  Had our instru-\nments permitted it, we might have seen the gathering trouble\nfar back in the nineteenth century.  Men like Schiaparelli\nwatched the red planet--it is odd, by-the-bye, that for count-\nless centuries Mars has been the star of war--but failed to\ninterpret the fluctuating appearances of the markings they\nmapped so well.  All that time the Martians must have been\ngetting ready.",
        "During the opposition of 1894 a great light was seen on\nthe illuminated part of the disk, first at the Lick Observatory,\nthen by Perrotin of Nice, and then by other observers.  English\nreaders heard of it first in the issue of NATURE dated August 2.\nI am inclined to think that this blaze may have been the\ncasting of the huge gun, in the vast pit sunk into their planet,\nfrom which their shots were fired at us.  Peculiar markings, as\nyet unexplained, were seen near the site of that outbreak\nduring the next two oppositions.",
        "The storm burst upon us six years ago now.  As Mars\napproached opposition, Lavelle of Java set the wires of the\nastronomical exchange palpitating with the amazing intelli-\ngence of a huge outbreak of incandescent gas upon the planet.\nIt had occurred towards midnight of the twelfth; and the\nspectroscope, to which he had at once resorted, indicated a\nmass of flaming gas, chiefly hydrogen, moving with an\nenormous velocity towards this earth.  This jet of fire had\nbecome invisible about a quarter past twelve.  He compared\nit to a colossal puff of flame suddenly and violently squirted\nout of the planet, “as flaming gases rushed out of a gun.”",
        "A singularly appropriate phrase it proved.  Yet the next day\nthere was nothing of this in the papers except a little note in\nthe DAILY TELEGRAPH, and the world went in ignorance of one\nof the gravest dangers that ever threatened the human race.\nI might not have heard of the eruption at all had I not met\nOgilvy, the well-known astronomer, at Ottershaw.  He was\nimmensely excited at the news, and in the excess of his feel-\nings invited me up to take a turn with him that night in a\nscrutiny of the red planet.",
        "In spite of all that has happened since, I still remember\nthat vigil very distinctly: the black and silent observatory,\nthe shadowed lantern throwing a feeble glow upon the floor\nin the corner, the steady ticking of the clockwork of the tele-\nscope, the little slit in the roof--an oblong profundity with\nthe stardust streaked across it.  Ogilvy moved about, invisible\nbut audible.  Looking through the telescope, one saw a circle\nof deep blue and the little round planet swimming in the\nfield.  It seemed such a little thing, so bright and small and\nstill, faintly marked with transverse stripes, and slightly\nflattened from the perfect round.  But so little it was, so\nsilvery warm--a pin’s-head of light!  It was as if it quivered,\nbut really this was the telescope vibrating with the activity\nof the clockwork that kept the planet in view.",
        "As I watched, the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller\nand to advance and recede, but that was simply that my eye\nwas tired.  Forty millions of miles it was from us--more than\nforty millions of miles of void.  Few people realise the im-\nmensity of vacancy in which the dust of the material universe\nswims.",
        "Near it in the field, I remember, were three faint points of\nlight, three telescopic stars infinitely remote, and all around\nit was the unfathomable darkness of empty space.  You know\nhow that blackness looks on a frosty starlight night.  In a tele-\nscope it seems far profounder.  And invisible to me because\nit was so remote and small, flying swiftly and steadily towards\nme across that incredible distance, drawing nearer every min-\nute by so many thousands of miles, came the Thing they were\nsending us, the Thing that was to bring so much struggle and\ncalamity and death to the earth.  I never dreamed of it then\nas I watched; no one on earth dreamed of that unerring\nmissile.",
        "That night, too, there was another jetting out of gas from\nthe distant planet.  I saw it.  A reddish flash at the edge, the\nslightest projection of the outline just as the chronometer\nstruck midnight; and at that I told Ogilvy and he took my\nplace.  The night was warm and I was thirsty, and I went\nstretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark-\nness, to the little table where the siphon stood, while Ogilvy\nexclaimed at the streamer of gas that came out towards us.",
        "That night another invisible missile started on its way to\nthe earth from Mars, just a second or so under twenty-four\nhours after the first one.  I remember how I sat on the table\nthere in the blackness, with patches of green and crimson\nswimming before my eyes.  I wished I had a light to smoke\nby, little suspecting the meaning of the minute gleam I had\nseen and all that it would presently bring me.  Ogilvy watched\ntill one, and then gave it up; and we lit the lantern and\nwalked over to his house.  Down below in the darkness were\nOttershaw and Chertsey and all their hundreds of people,\nsleeping in peace.",
        "He was full of speculation that night about the condition\nof Mars, and scoffed at the vulgar idea of its having in-\nhabitants who were signalling us.  His idea was that meteorites\nmight be falling in a heavy shower upon the planet, or that\na huge volcanic explosion was in progress.  He pointed out\nto me how unlikely it was that organic evolution had taken\nthe same direction in the two adjacent planets.",
        "“The chances against anything manlike on Mars are a\nmillion to one,” he said.",
        "Hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the\nnight after about midnight, and again the night after; and\nso for ten nights, a flame each night.  Why the shots ceased\nafter the tenth no one on earth has attempted to explain.\nIt may be the gases of the firing caused the Martians in-\nconvenience.  Dense clouds of smoke or dust, visible through\na powerful telescope on earth as little grey, fluctuating\npatches, spread through the clearness of the planet’s atmos-\nphere and obscured its more familiar features.",
        "Even the daily papers woke up to the disturbances at\nlast, and popular notes appeared here, there, and everywhere\nconcerning the volcanoes upon Mars.  The seriocomic periodi-\ncal PUNCH, I remember, made a happy use of it in the\npolitical cartoon.  And, all unsuspected, those missiles the\nMartians had fired at us drew earthward, rushing now at a\npace of many miles a second through the empty gulf of\nspace, hour by hour and day by day, nearer and nearer.  It\nseems to me now almost incredibly wonderful that, with\nthat swift fate hanging over us, men could go about their\npetty concerns as they did.  I remember how jubilant Markham\nwas at securing a new photograph of the planet for the\nillustrated paper he edited in those days.  People in these\nlatter times scarcely realise the abundance and enterprise\nof our nineteenth-century papers.  For my own part, I was\nmuch occupied in learning to ride the bicycle, and busy\nupon a series of papers discussing the probable developments\nof moral ideas as civilisation progressed.",
        "One night (the first missile then could scarcely have been\n10,000,000 miles away) I went for a walk with my wife.  It\nwas starlight and I explained the Signs of the Zodiac to\nher, and pointed out Mars, a bright dot of light creeping\nzenithward, towards which so many telescopes were pointed.\nIt was a warm night.  Coming home, a party of excursionists\nfrom Chertsey or Isleworth passed us singing and playing\nmusic.  There were lights in the upper windows of the houses\nas the people went to bed.  From the railway station in the\ndistance came the sound of shunting trains, ringing and\nrumbling, softened almost into melody by the distance.  My\nwife pointed out to me the brightness of the red, green, and\nyellow signal lights hanging in a framework against the sky.\nIt seemed so safe and tranquil.",
        "Then came the night of the first falling star.  It was seen\nearly in the morning, rushing over Winchester eastward, a\nline of flame high in the atmosphere.  Hundreds must have\nseen it, and taken it for an ordinary falling star.  Albin de-\nscribed it as leaving a greenish streak behind it that glowed\nfor some seconds.  Denning, our greatest authority on meteor-\nites, stated that the height of its first appearance was about\nninety or one hundred miles.  It seemed to him that it fell\nto earth about one hundred miles east of him.",
        "I was at home at that hour and writing in my study; and\nalthough my French windows face towards Ottershaw and\nthe blind was up (for I loved in those days to look up at\nthe night sky), I saw nothing of it.  Yet this strangest of all\nthings that ever came to earth from outer space must have\nfallen while I was sitting there, visible to me had I only\nlooked up as it passed.  Some of those who saw its flight say\nit travelled with a hissing sound.  I myself heard nothing\nof that.  Many people in Berkshire, Surrey, and Middlesex\nmust have seen the fall of it, and, at most, have thought\nthat another meteorite had descended.  No one seems to have\ntroubled to look for the fallen mass that night.",
        "But very early in the morning poor Ogilvy, who had seen\nthe shooting star and who was persuaded that a meteorite lay\nsomewhere on the common between Horsell, Ottershaw, and\nWoking, rose early with the idea of finding it.  Find it he did,\nsoon after dawn, and not far from the sand pits.  An enormous\nhole had been made by the impact of the projectile, and the\nsand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction\nover the heath, forming heaps visible a mile and a half away.\nThe heather was on fire eastward, and a thin blue smoke\nrose against the dawn.",
        "The Thing itself lay almost entirely buried in sand, amidst\nthe scattered splinters of a fir tree it had shivered to frag-\nments in its descent.  The uncovered part had the appearance\nof a huge cylinder, caked over and its outline softened by a\nthick scaly dun-coloured incrustation.  It had a diameter of\nabout thirty yards.  He approached the mass, surprised at\nthe size and more so at the shape, since most meteorites\nare rounded more or less completely.  It was, however, still\nso hot from its flight through the air as to forbid his near\napproach.  A stirring noise within its cylinder he ascribed to\nthe unequal cooling of its surface; for at that time it had\nnot occurred to him that it might be hollow.",
        "He remained standing at the edge of the pit that the\nThing had made for itself, staring at its strange appearance,\nastonished chiefly at its unusual shape and colour, and\ndimly perceiving even then some evidence of design in its\narrival.  The early morning was wonderfully still, and the sun,\njust clearing the pine trees towards Weybridge, was already\nwarm.  He did not remember hearing any birds that morning,\nthere was certainly no breeze stirring, and the only sounds\nwere the faint movements from within the cindery cylinder.\nHe was all alone on the common.",
        "Then suddenly he noticed with a start that some of the\ngrey clinker, the ashy incrustation that covered the meteorite,\nwas falling off the circular edge of the end.  It was dropping\noff in flakes and raining down upon the sand.  A large piece\nsuddenly came off and fell with a sharp noise that brought\nhis heart into his mouth.",
        "For a minute he scarcely realised what this meant, and,\nalthough the heat was excessive, he clambered down into\nthe pit close to the bulk to see the Thing more clearly.  He\nfancied even then that the cooling of the body might account\nfor this, but what disturbed that idea was the fact that the\nash was falling only from the end of the cylinder.",
        "And then he perceived that, very slowly, the circular top\nof the cylinder was rotating on its body.  It was such a\ngradual movement that he discovered it only through noticing\nthat a black mark that had been near him five minutes ago\nwas now at the other side of the circumference.  Even then\nhe scarcely understood what this indicated, until he heard a\nmuffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward\nan inch or so.  Then the thing came upon him in a flash.  The\ncylinder was artificial--hollow--with an end that screwed\nout!  Something within the cylinder was unscrewing the top!",
        "“Good heavens!” said Ogilvy.  “There’s a man in it--men\nin it!  Half roasted to death!  Trying to escape!”",
        "At once, with a quick mental leap, he linked the Thing\nwith the flash upon Mars.",
        "The thought of the confined creature was so dreadful to\nhim that he forgot the heat and went forward to the cylinder\nto help turn.  But luckily the dull radiation arrested him before\nhe could burn his hands on the still-glowing metal.  At that\nhe stood irresolute for a moment, then turned, scrambled out\nof the pit, and set off running wildly into Woking.  The time\nthen must have been somewhere about six o’clock.  He met a\nwaggoner and tried to make him understand, but the tale\nhe told and his appearance were so wild--his hat had fallen\noff in the pit--that the man simply drove on.  He was equally\nunsuccessful with the potman who was just unlocking the\ndoors of the public-house by Horsell Bridge.  The fellow\nthought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful\nattempt to shut him into the taproom.  That sobered him a\nlittle; and when he saw Henderson, the London journalist,\nin his garden, he called over the palings and made himself\nunderstood.",
        "“Henderson,” he called, “you saw that shooting star last\nnight?”",
        "“Well?” said Henderson.",
        "“It’s out on Horsell Common now.”",
        "“Good Lord!” said Henderson.  “Fallen meteorite!  That’s\ngood.”",
        "“But it’s something more than a meteorite.  It’s a cylinder\n--an artificial cylinder, man!  And there’s something inside.”",
        "Henderson stood up with his spade in his hand.",
        "“What’s that?” he said.  He was deaf in one ear.",
        "Ogilvy told him all that he had seen.  Henderson was a\nminute or so taking it in.  Then he dropped his spade, snatched\nup his jacket, and came out into the road.  The two men\nhurried back at once to the common, and found the cylinder\nstill lying in the same position.  But now the sounds inside\nhad ceased, and a thin circle of bright metal showed between\nthe top and the body of the cylinder.  Air was either entering\nor escaping at the rim with a thin, sizzling sound.",
        "They listened, rapped on the scaly burnt metal with a\nstick, and, meeting with no response, they both concluded\nthe man or men inside must be insensible or dead.",
        "Of course the two were quite unable to do anything.  They\nshouted consolation and promises, and went off back to the\ntown again to get help.  One can imagine them, covered\nwith sand, excited and disordered, running up the little\nstreet in the bright sunlight just as the shop folks were\ntaking down their shutters and people were opening their\nbedroom windows.  Henderson went into the railway station\nat once, in order to telegraph the news to London.  The\nnewspaper articles had prepared men’s minds for the re-\nception of the idea.",
        "By eight o’clock a number of boys and unemployed men\nhad already started for the common to see the “dead men from\nMars.”  That was the form the story took.  I heard of it first\nfrom my newspaper boy about a quarter to nine when I went out\nto get my DAILY CHRONICLE.  I was naturally startled, and\nlost no time in going out and across the Ottershaw bridge\nto the sand pits.",
        "I found a little crowd of perhaps twenty people sur-\nrounding the huge hole in which the cylinder lay.  I have\nalready described the appearance of that colossal bulk, em-\nbedded in the ground.  The turf and gravel about it seemed\ncharred as if by a sudden explosion.  No doubt its impact\nhad caused a flash of fire.  Henderson and Ogilvy were not\nthere.  I think they perceived that nothing was to be done for\nthe present, and had gone away to breakfast at Henderson’s\nhouse.",
        "There were four or five boys sitting on the edge of the\nPit, with their feet dangling, and amusing themselves--until\nI stopped them--by throwing stones at the giant mass.\nAfter I had spoken to them about it, they began playing at\n\"touch” in and out of the group of bystanders.",
        "Among these were a couple of cyclists, a jobbing gardener\nI employed sometimes, a girl carrying a baby, Gregg the\nbutcher and his little boy, and two or three loafers and golf\ncaddies who were accustomed to hang about the railway\nstation.  There was very little talking.  Few of the common\npeople in England had anything but the vaguest astronomical\nideas in those days.  Most of them were staring quietly at\nthe big tablelike end of the cylinder, which was still as\nOgilvy and Henderson had left it.  I fancy the popular ex-\npectation of a heap of charred corpses was disappointed at\nthis inanimate bulk.  Some went away while I was there, and\nother people came.  I clambered into the pit and fancied I\nheard a faint movement under my feet.  The top had certainly\nceased to rotate.",
        "It was only when I got thus close to it that the strangeness\nof this object was at all evident to me.  At the first glance\nit was really no more exciting than an overturned carriage\nor a tree blown across the road.  Not so much so, indeed.  It\nlooked like a rusty gas float.  It required a certain amount of\nscientific education to perceive that the grey scale of the\nThing was no common oxide, that the yellowish-white metal\nthat gleamed in the crack between the lid and the cylinder\nhad an unfamiliar hue.  “Extra-terrestrial” had no meaning for\nmost of the onlookers.",
        "At that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the\nThing had come from the planet Mars, but I judged it\nimprobable that it contained any living creature.  I thought\nthe unscrewing might be automatic.  In spite of Ogilvy, I\nstill believed that there were men in Mars.  My mind ran\nfancifully on the possibilities of its containing manuscript,\non the difficulties in translation that might arise, whether\nwe should find coins and models in it, and so forth.  Yet it\nwas a little too large for assurance on this idea.  I felt an\nimpatience to see it opened.  About eleven, as nothing\nseemed happening, I walked back, full of such thought, to\nmy home in Maybury.  But I found it difficult to get to work\nupon my abstract investigations.",
        "In the afternoon the appearance of the common had altered\nvery much.  The early editions of the evening papers had\nstartled London with enormous headlines:",
        "\n             “A MESSAGE RECEIVED FROM MARS.”",
        "          “REMARKABLE STORY FROM WOKING,”",
        "and so forth.  In addition, Ogilvy’s wire to the Astronomical\nExchange had roused every observatory in the three kingdoms.",
        "There were half a dozen flies or more from the Woking\nstation standing in the road by the sand pits, a basket-\nchaise from Chobham, and a rather lordly carriage.  Besides\nthat, there was quite a heap of bicycles.  In addition, a\nlarge number of people must have walked, in spite of the\nheat of the day, from Woking and Chertsey, so that there was\naltogether quite a considerable crowd--one or two gaily\ndressed ladies among the others.\n  It was glaringly hot, not a cloud in the sky nor a breath\nof wind, and the only shadow was that of the few scattered\npine trees.  The burning heather had been extinguished, but\nthe level ground towards Ottershaw was blackened as far as\none could see, and still giving off vertical streamers of\nsmoke.  An enterprising sweet-stuff dealer in the Chobham\nRoad had sent up his son with a barrow-load of green\napples and ginger beer.",
        "Going to the edge of the pit, I found it occupied by a\ngroup of about half a dozen men--Henderson, Ogilvy, and\na tall, fair-haired man that I afterwards learned was Stent,\nthe Astronomer Royal, with several workmen wielding spades\nand pickaxes.  Stent was giving directions in a clear, high-\npitched voice.  He was standing on the cylinder, which was\nnow evidently much cooler; his face was crimson and stream-\ning with perspiration, and something seemed to have irritated\nhim.",
        "A large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered,\nthough its lower end was still embedded.  As soon as Ogilvy\nsaw me among the staring crowd on the edge of the pit\nhe called to me to come down, and asked me if I would\nmind going over to see Lord Hilton, the lord of the manor.",
        "The growing crowd, he said, was becoming a serious\nimpediment to their excavations, especially the boys.  They\nwanted a light railing put up, and help to keep the people\nback.  He told me that a faint stirring was occasionally still\naudible within the case, but that the workmen had failed\nto unscrew the top, as it afforded no grip to them.  The\ncase appeared to be enormously thick, and it was possible\nthat the faint sounds we heard represented a noisy tumult\nin the interior.",
        "I was very glad to do as he asked, and so become one of\nthe privileged spectators within the contemplated enclosure.\nI failed to find Lord Hilton at his house, but I was told\nhe was expected from London by the six o’clock train from\nWaterloo; and as it was then about a quarter past five, I\nwent home, had some tea, and walked up to the station\nto waylay him.",
        "When I returned to the common the sun was setting.\nScattered groups were hurrying from the direction of Woking,\nand one or two persons were returning.  The crowd about\nthe pit had increased, and stood out black against the lemon\nyellow of the sky--a couple of hundred people, perhaps.\nThere were raised voices, and some sort of struggle appeared\nto be going on about the pit.  Strange imaginings passed\nthrough my mind.  As I drew nearer I heard Stent’s voice:",
        "“Keep back!  Keep back!”",
        "A boy came running towards me.",
        "“It’s a-movin’,” he said to me as he passed; “a-screwin’ and\na-screwin’ out.  I don’t like it.  I’m a-goin’ ’ome, I am.”",
        "I went on to the crowd.  There were really, I should think,\ntwo or three hundred people elbowing and jostling one an-\nother, the one or two ladies there being by no means the\nleast active.",
        "“He’s fallen in the pit!” cried some one.",
        "“Keep back!” said several.",
        "The crowd swayed a little, and I elbowed my way through.\nEvery one seemed greatly excited.  I heard a peculiar hum-\nming sound from the pit.",
        "“I say!” said Ogilvy; “help keep these idiots back.  We\ndon’t know what’s in the confounded thing, you know!”",
        "I saw a young man, a shop assistant in Woking I believe\nhe was, standing on the cylinder and trying to scramble out\nof the hole again.  The crowd had pushed him in.",
        "The end of the cylinder was being screwed out from within.\nNearly two feet of shining screw projected.  Somebody blun-\ndered against me, and I narrowly missed being pitched onto\nthe top of the screw.  I turned, and as I did so the screw must\nhave come out, for the lid of the cylinder fell upon the gravel\nwith a ringing concussion.  I stuck my elbow into the person\nbehind me, and turned my head towards the Thing again.\nFor a moment that circular cavity seemed perfectly black.\nI had the sunset in my eyes.",
        "I think everyone expected to see a man emerge--possibly\nsomething a little unlike us terrestrial men, but in all essen-\ntials a man.  I know I did.  But, looking, I presently saw some-\nthing stirring within the shadow: greyish billowy movements,\none above another, and then two luminous disks--like eyes.\nThen something resembling a little grey snake, about the\nthickness of a walking stick, coiled up out of the writhing\nmiddle, and wriggled in the air towards me--and then\nanother.",
        "A sudden chill came over me.  There was a loud shriek\nfrom a woman behind.  I half turned, keeping my eyes fixed\nupon the cylinder still, from which other tentacles were now\nprojecting, and began pushing my way back from the edge\nof the pit.  I saw astonishment giving place to horror on the\nfaces of the people about me.  I heard inarticulate exclama-\ntions on all sides.  There was a general movement backwards.\nI saw the shopman struggling still on the edge of the pit.  I\nfound myself alone, and saw the people on the other side of\nthe pit running off, Stent among them.  I looked again at the\ncylinder, and ungovernable terror gripped me.  I stood petri-\nfied and staring.",
        "A big greyish rounded bulk, the size, perhaps, of a bear,\nwas rising slowly and painfully out of the cylinder.  As\nit bulged up and caught the light, it glistened like wet\nleather.",
        "Two large dark-coloured eyes were regarding me stead-\nfastly.  The mass that framed them, the head of the thing, was\nrounded, and had, one might say, a face.  There was a mouth\nunder the eyes, the lipless brim of which quivered and\npanted, and dropped saliva.  The whole creature heaved and\npulsated convulsively.  A lank tentacular appendage gripped\nthe edge of the cylinder, another swayed in the air.",
        "Those who have never seen a living Martian can scarcely\nimagine the strange horror of its appearance.  The peculiar\nV-shaped mouth with its pointed upper lip, the absence of\nbrow ridges, the absence of a chin beneath the wedgelike\nlower lip, the incessant quivering of this mouth, the Gorgon\ngroups of tentacles, the tumultuous breathing of the lungs in\na strange atmosphere, the evident heaviness and painfulness\nof movement due to the greater gravitational energy of the\nearth--above all, the extraordinary intensity of the immense\neyes--were at once vital, intense, inhuman, crippled and\nmonstrous.  There was something fungoid in the oily brown\nskin, something in the clumsy deliberation of the tedi-\nous movements unspeakably nasty.  Even at this first en-\ncounter, this first glimpse, I was overcome with disgust and\ndread.",
        "Suddenly the monster vanished.  It had toppled over the\nbrim of the cylinder and fallen into the pit, with a thud like\nthe fall of a great mass of leather.  I heard it give a peculiar\nthick cry, and forthwith another of these creatures appeared\ndarkly in the deep shadow of the aperture.",
        "I turned and, running madly, made for the first group of\ntrees, perhaps a hundred yards away; but I ran slantingly\nand stumbling, for I could not avert my face from these\nthings.",
        "There, among some young pine trees and furze bushes, I\nstopped, panting, and waited further developments.  The\ncommon round the sand pits was dotted with people, stand-\ning like myself in a half-fascinated terror, staring at these\ncreatures, or rather at the heaped gravel at the edge of the pit\nin which they lay.  And then, with a renewed horror, I saw a\nround, black object bobbing up and down on the edge of the\npit.  It was the head of the shopman who had fallen in, but\nshowing as a little black object against the hot western sun.\nNow he got his shoulder and knee up, and again he seemed\nto slip back until only his head was visible.  Suddenly he van-\nished, and I could have fancied a faint shriek had reached\nme.  I had a momentary impulse to go back and help him\nthat my fears overruled.",
        "Everything was then quite invisible, hidden by the deep\npit and the heap of sand that the fall of the cylinder had\nmade.  Anyone coming along the road from Chobham or Wo-\nking would have been amazed at the sight--a dwindling mul-\ntitude of perhaps a hundred people or more standing in a\ngreat irregular circle, in ditches, behind bushes, behind gates\nand hedges, saying little to one another and that in short,\nexcited shouts, and staring, staring hard at a few heaps of\nsand.  The barrow of ginger beer stood, a queer derelict, black\nagainst the burning sky, and in the sand pits was a row of\ndeserted vehicles with their horses feeding out of nosebags\nor pawing the ground.",
        "\n   After the glimpse I had had of the Martians emerging\nfrom the cylinder in which they had come to the earth from\ntheir planet, a kind of fascination paralysed my actions.  I\nremained standing knee-deep in the heather, staring at the\nmound that hid them.  I was a battleground of fear and\ncuriosity.",
        "I did not dare to go back towards the pit, but I felt a pas-\nsionate longing to peer into it.  I began walking, therefore, in\na big curve, seeking some point of vantage and continually\nlooking at the sand heaps that hid these new-comers to our\nearth.  Once a leash of thin black whips, like the arms of an\noctopus, flashed across the sunset and was immediately with-\ndrawn, and afterwards a thin rod rose up, joint by joint,\nbearing at its apex a circular disk that spun with a wobbling\nmotion.  What could be going on there?",
        "Most of the spectators had gathered in one or two groups\n--one a little crowd towards Woking, the other a knot of\npeople in the direction of Chobham.  Evidently they shared\nmy mental conflict.  There were few near me.  One man I\napproached--he was, I perceived, a neighbour of mine,\nthough I did not know his name--and accosted.  But it was\nscarcely a time for articulate conversation.",
        "“What ugly brutes!” he said.  “Good God!  What ugly\nbrutes!”  He repeated this over and over again.",
        "“Did you see a man in the pit?” I said; but he made no\nanswer to that.  We became silent, and stood watching for a\ntime side by side, deriving, I fancy, a certain comfort in one\nanother’s company.  Then I shifted my position to a little\nknoll that gave me the advantage of a yard or more of eleva-\ntion and when I looked for him presently he was walking\ntowards Woking.",
        "The sunset faded to twilight before anything further hap-\npened.  The crowd far away on the left, towards Woking,\nseemed to grow, and I heard now a faint murmur from it.\nThe little knot of people towards Chobham dispersed.  There\nwas scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit.",
        "It was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage,\nand I suppose the new arrivals from Woking also helped to\nrestore confidence.  At any rate, as the dusk came on a slow,\nintermittent movement upon the sand pits began, a move-\nment that seemed to gather force as the stillness of the eve-\nning about the cylinder remained unbroken.  Vertical black\nfigures in twos and threes would advance, stop, watch,\nand advance again, spreading out as they did so in a thin\nirregular crescent that promised to enclose the pit in its\nattenuated horns.  I, too, on my side began to move towards\nthe pit.",
        "Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly\ninto the sand pits, and heard the clatter of hoofs and the\ngride of wheels.  I saw a lad trundling off the barrow of\napples.  And then, within thirty yards of the pit, advancing\nfrom the direction of Horsell, I noted a little black knot of\nmen, the foremost of whom was waving a white flag.",
        "This was the Deputation.  There had been a hasty consulta-\ntion, and since the Martians were evidently, in spite of their\nrepulsive forms, intelligent creatures, it had been resolved to\nshow them, by approaching them with signals, that we too\nwere intelligent.",
        "Flutter, flutter, went the flag, first to the right, then to\nthe left.  It was too far for me to recognise anyone there, but\nafterwards I learned that Ogilvy, Stent, and Henderson were\nwith others in this attempt at communication.  This little\ngroup had in its advance dragged inward, so to speak, the\ncircumference of the now almost complete circle of people,\nand a number of dim black figures followed it at discreet\ndistances.",
        "Suddenly there was a flash of light, and a quantity of\nluminous greenish smoke came out of the pit in three distinct\npuffs, which drove up, one after the other, straight into the\nstill air.",
        "This smoke (or flame, perhaps, would be the better word\nfor it) was so bright that the deep blue sky overhead and the\nhazy stretches of brown common towards Chertsey, set with\nblack pine trees, seemed to darken abruptly as these puffs\narose, and to remain the darker after their dispersal.  At the\nsame time a faint hissing sound became audible.",
        "Beyond the pit stood the little wedge of people with the\nwhite flag at its apex, arrested by these phenomena, a little\nknot of small vertical black shapes upon the black ground.\nAs the green smoke arose, their faces flashed out pallid green,\nand faded again as it vanished.  Then slowly the hissing passed\ninto a humming, into a long, loud, droning noise.  Slowly a\nhumped shape rose out of the pit, and the ghost of a beam\nof light seemed to flicker out from it.",
        "Forthwith flashes of actual flame, a bright glare leaping\nfrom one to another, sprang from the scattered group of men.\nIt was as if some invisible jet impinged upon them and\nflashed into white flame.  It was as if each man were suddenly\nand momentarily turned to fire.",
        "Then, by the light of their own destruction, I saw them\nstaggering and falling, and their supporters turning to\nrun.",
        "I stood staring, not as yet realising that this was death\nleaping from man to man in that little distant crowd.  All I\nfelt was that it was something very strange.  An almost noise-\nless and blinding flash of light, and a man fell headlong and\nlay still; and as the unseen shaft of heat passed over them,\npine trees burst into fire, and every dry furze bush became\nwith one dull thud a mass of flames.  And far away towards\nKnaphill I saw the flashes of trees and hedges and wooden\nbuildings suddenly set alight.",
        "It was sweeping round swiftly and steadily, this flaming\ndeath, this invisible, inevitable sword of heat.  I perceived it\ncoming towards me by the flashing bushes it touched, and\nwas too astounded and stupefied to stir.  I heard the crackle\nof fire in the sand pits and the sudden squeal of a horse that\nwas as suddenly stilled.  Then it was as if an invisible yet\nintensely heated finger were drawn through the heather\nbetween me and the Martians, and all along a curving line\nbeyond the sand pits the dark ground smoked and crackled.\nSomething fell with a crash far away to the left where the\nroad from Woking station opens out on the common.  Forth-\nwith the hissing and humming ceased, and the black, dome-\nlike object sank slowly out of sight into the pit.",
        "All this had happened with such swiftness that I had stood\nmotionless, dumbfounded and dazzled by the flashes of light.\nHad that death swept through a full circle, it must inevitably\nhave slain me in my surprise.  But it passed and spared me,\nand left the night about me suddenly dark and un-\nfamiliar.",
        "The undulating common seemed now dark almost to\nblackness, except where its roadways lay grey and pale under\nthe deep blue sky of the early night.  It was dark, and sud-\ndenly void of men.  Overhead the stars were mustering, and\nin the west the sky was still a pale, bright, almost greenish\nblue.  The tops of the pine trees and the roofs of Horsell came\nout sharp and black against the western afterglow.  The Mar-\ntians and their appliances were altogether invisible, save for\nthat thin mast upon which their restless mirror wobbled.\nPatches of bush and isolated trees here and there smoked and\nglowed still, and the houses towards Woking station were\nsending up spires of flame into the stillness of the evening\nair.",
        "Nothing was changed save for that and a terrible astonish-\nment.  The little group of black specks with the flag of white\nhad been swept out of existence, and the stillness of the\nevening, so it seemed to me, had scarcely been broken.",
        "It came to me that I was upon this dark common, helpless,\nunprotected, and alone.  Suddenly, like a thing falling upon\nme from without, came--fear.",
        "With an effort I turned and began a stumbling run through\nthe heather.",
        "The fear I felt was no rational fear, but a panic terror not\nonly of the Martians, but of the dusk and stillness all about\nme.  Such an extraordinary effect in unmanning me it had\nthat I ran weeping silently as a child might do.  Once I had\nturned, I did not dare to look back.",
        "I remember I felt an extraordinary persuasion that I was\nbeing played with, that presently, when I was upon the very\nverge of safety, this mysterious death--as swift as the passage\nof light--would leap after me from the pit about the cylinder\nand strike me down.",
        "It is still a matter of wonder how the Martians are able\nto slay men so swiftly and so silently.  Many think that in\nsome way they are able to generate an intense heat in a\nchamber of practically absolute non-conductivity.  This intense\nheat they project in a parallel beam against any object they\nchoose, by means of a polished parabolic mirror of unknown\ncomposition, much as the parabolic mirror of a lighthouse\nprojects a beam of light.  But no one has absolutely proved\nthese details.  However it is done, it is certain that a beam of\nheat is the essence of the matter.  Heat, and invisible, instead\nof visible, light.  Whatever is combustible flashes into flame\nat its touch, lead runs like water, it softens iron, cracks and\nmelts glass, and when it falls upon water, incontinently that\nexplodes into steam.",
        "That night nearly forty people lay under the starlight about\nthe pit, charred and distorted beyond recognition, and all\nnight long the common from Horsell to Maybury was deserted\nand brightly ablaze.",
        "The news of the massacre probably reached Chobham,\nWoking, and Ottershaw about the same time.  In Woking the\nshops had closed when the tragedy happened, and a number\nof people, shop people and so forth, attracted by the stories\nthey had heard, were walking over the Horsell Bridge and\nalong the road between the hedges that runs out at last upon\nthe common.  You may imagine the young people brushed up\nafter the labours of the day, and making this novelty, as they\nwould make any novelty, the excuse for walking together and\nenjoying a trivial flirtation.  You may figure to yourself the\nhum of voices along the road in the gloaming. . . .",
        "As yet, of course, few people in Woking even knew that\nthe cylinder had opened, though poor Henderson had sent a\nmessenger on a bicycle to the post office with a special wire\nto an evening paper.",
        "As these folks came out by twos and threes upon the open,\nthey found little knots of people talking excitedly and peering\nat the spinning mirror over the sand pits, and the new-comers\nwere, no doubt, soon infected by the excitement of the oc-\ncasion.",
        "By half past eight, when the Deputation was destroyed,\nthere may have been a crowd of three hundred people or\nmore at this place, besides those who had left the road to\napproach the Martians nearer.  There were three policemen\ntoo, one of whom was mounted, doing their best, under\ninstructions from Stent, to keep the people back and deter\nthem from approaching the cylinder.  There was some booing\nfrom those more thoughtless and excitable souls to whom a\ncrowd is always an occasion for noise and horse-play.",
        "Stent and Ogilvy, anticipating some possibilities of a\ncollision, had telegraphed from Horsell to the barracks as\nsoon as the Martians emerged, for the help of a company of\nsoldiers to protect these strange creatures from violence.\nAfter that they returned to lead that ill-fated advance.  The\ndescription of their death, as it was seen by the crowd, tallies\nvery closely with my own impressions: the three puffs of\ngreen smoke, the deep humming note, and the flashes of\nflame.",
        "But that crowd of people had a far narrower escape than\nmine.  Only the fact that a hummock of heathery sand inter-\ncepted the lower part of the Heat-Ray saved them.  Had the\nelevation of the parabolic mirror been a few yards higher,\nnone could have lived to tell the tale.  They saw the flashes\nand the men falling and an invisible hand, as it were, lit the\nbushes as it hurried towards them through the twilight.  Then,\nwith a whistling note that rose above the droning of the pit,\nthe beam swung close over their heads, lighting the tops of\nthe beech trees that line the road, and splitting the bricks,\nsmashing the windows, firing the window frames, and bring-\ning down in crumbling ruin a portion of the gable of the\nhouse nearest the corner.",
        "In the sudden thud, hiss, and glare of the igniting trees,\nthe panic-stricken crowd seems to have swayed hesitatingly\nfor some moments.  Sparks and burning twigs began to fall\ninto the road, and single leaves like puffs of flame.  Hats and\ndresses caught fire.  Then came a crying from the common.\nThere were shrieks and shouts, and suddenly a mounted\npoliceman came galloping through the confusion with his\nhands clasped over his head, screaming.",
        "“They’re coming!” a woman shrieked, and incontinently\neveryone was turning and pushing at those behind, in order\nto clear their way to Woking again.  They must have bolted\nas blindly as a flock of sheep.  Where the road grows narrow\nand black between the high banks the crowd jammed, and a\ndesperate struggle occurred.  All that crowd did not escape;\nthree persons at least, two women and a little boy, were\ncrushed and trampled there, and left to die amid the terror\nand the darkness.",
        "\n   For my own part, I remember nothing of my flight\nexcept the stress of blundering against trees and stumbling\nthrough the heather.  All about me gathered the invisible\nterrors of the Martians; that pitiless sword of heat seemed\nwhirling to and fro, flourishing overhead before it descended\nand smote me out of life.  I came into the road between the\ncrossroads and Horsell, and ran along this to the crossroads.",
        "At last I could go no further; I was exhausted with the\nviolence of my emotion and of my flight, and I staggered and\nfell by the wayside.  That was near the bridge that crosses\nthe canal by the gasworks.  I fell and lay still.",
        "I must have remained there some time.",
        "I sat up, strangely perplexed.  For a moment, perhaps, I\ncould not clearly understand how I came there.  My terror\nhad fallen from me like a garment.  My hat had gone, and\nmy collar had burst away from its fastener.  A few minutes\nbefore, there had only been three real things before me--the\nimmensity of the night and space and nature, my own feeble-\nness and anguish, and the near approach of death.  Now it\nwas as if something turned over, and the point of view altered\nabruptly.  There was no sensible transition from one state of\nmind to the other.  I was immediately the self of every day\nagain--a decent, ordinary citizen.  The silent common, the\nimpulse of my flight, the starting flames, were as if they had\nbeen in a dream.  I asked myself had these latter things indeed\nhappened?  I could not credit it.",
        "I rose and walked unsteadily up the steep incline of the\nbridge.  My mind was blank wonder.  My muscles and nerves\nseemed drained of their strength.  I dare say I staggered\ndrunkenly.  A head rose over the arch, and the figure of a\nworkman carrying a basket appeared.  Beside him ran a little\nboy.  He passed me, wishing me good night.  I was minded to\nspeak to him, but did not.  I answered his greeting with a\nmeaningless mumble and went on over the bridge.",
        "Over the Maybury arch a train, a billowing tumult of\nwhite, firelit smoke, and a long caterpillar of lighted windows,\nwent flying south--clatter, clatter, clap, rap, and it had gone.\nA dim group of people talked in the gate of one of the houses\nin the pretty little row of gables that was called Oriental\nTerrace.  It was all so real and so familiar.  And that behind\nme!  It was frantic, fantastic!  Such things, I told myself,\ncould not be.",
        "Perhaps I am a man of exceptional moods.  I do not know\nhow far my experience is common.  At times I suffer from the\nstrangest sense of detachment from myself and the world\nabout me; I seem to watch it all from the outside, from some-\nwhere inconceivably remote, out of time, out of space, out\nof the stress and tragedy of it all.  This feeling was very\nstrong upon me that night.  Here was another side to my\ndream.",
        "But the trouble was the blank incongruity of this serenity\nand the swift death flying yonder, not two miles away.  There\nwas a noise of business from the gasworks, and the electric\nlamps were all alight.  I stopped at the group of people.",
        "“What news from the common?” said I.",
        "There were two men and a woman at the gate.",
        "“Eh?” said one of the men, turning.",
        "“What news from the common?” I said.",
        "“’Ain’t yer just BEEN there?” asked the men.",
        "“People seem fair silly about the common,” said the woman\nover the gate.  “What’s it all abart?”",
        "“Haven’t you heard of the men from Mars?” said I; “the\ncreatures from Mars?”",
        "“Quite enough,” said the woman over the gate.  “Thenks\";\nand all three of them laughed.",
        "I felt foolish and angry.  I tried and found I could not tell\nthem what I had seen.  They laughed again at my broken\nsentences.",
        "“You’ll hear more yet,” I said, and went on to my home.",
        "I startled my wife at the doorway, so haggard was I.  I went\ninto the dining room, sat down, drank some wine, and so\nsoon as I could collect myself sufficiently I told her the things\nI had seen.  The dinner, which was a cold one, had already\nbeen served, and remained neglected on the table while I\ntold my story.",
        "“There is one thing,” I said, to allay the fears I had\naroused; “they are the most sluggish things I ever saw crawl.\nThey may keep the pit and kill people who come near them,\nbut they cannot get out of it. . . .  But the horror of them!”",
        "“Don’t, dear!” said my wife, knitting her brows and putting\nher hand on mine.",
        "“Poor Ogilvy!” I said.  “To think he may be lying dead\nthere!”",
        "My wife at least did not find my experience incredible.\nWhen I saw how deadly white her face was, I ceased abruptly.",
        "“They may come here,” she said again and again.",
        "I pressed her to take wine, and tried to reassure her.",
        "“They can scarcely move,” I said.",
        "I began to comfort her and myself by repeating all that\nOgilvy had told me of the impossibility of the Martians estab-\nlishing themselves on the earth.  In particular I laid stress on\nthe gravitational difficulty.  On the surface of the earth the\nforce of gravity is three times what it is on the surface of\nMars.  A Martian, therefore, would weigh three times more\nthan on Mars, albeit his muscular strength would be the same.\nHis own body would be a cope of lead to him.  That, indeed,\nwas the general opinion.  Both THE TIMES and the DAILY\nTELEGRAPH, for instance, insisted on it the next morning, and\nboth overlooked, just as I did, two obvious modifying influ-\nences.",
        "The atmosphere of the earth, we now know, contains far\nmore oxygen or far less argon (whichever way one likes to\nput it) than does Mars.  The invigorating influences of this\nexcess of oxygen upon the Martians indisputably did much\nto counterbalance the increased weight of their bodies.  And,\nin the second place, we all overlooked the fact that such\nmechanical intelligence as the Martian possessed was quite\nable to dispense with muscular exertion at a pinch.",
        "But I did not consider these points at the time, and so my\nreasoning was dead against the chances of the invaders.\nWith wine and food, the confidence of my own table, and\nthe necessity of reassuring my wife, I grew by insensible\ndegrees courageous and secure.",
        "“They have done a foolish thing,” said I, fingering my\nwineglass.  “They are dangerous because, no doubt, they are\nmad with terror.  Perhaps they expected to find no living\nthings--certainly no intelligent living things.",
        "“A shell in the pit” said I, “if the worst comes to the worst\nwill kill them all.”",
        "The intense excitement of the events had no doubt left my\nperceptive powers in a state of erethism.  I remember that\ndinner table with extraordinary vividness even now.  My dear\nwife’s sweet anxious face peering at me from under the pink\nlamp shade, the white cloth with its silver and glass table\nfurniture--for in those days even philosophical writers had\nmany little luxuries--the crimson-purple wine in my glass,\nare photographically distinct.  At the end of it I sat, temper-\ning nuts with a cigarette, regretting Ogilvy’s rashness, and\ndenouncing the shortsighted timidity of the Martians.",
        "So some respectable dodo in the Mauritius might have\nlorded it in his nest, and discussed the arrival of that shipful\nof pitiless sailors in want of animal food.  “We will peck them\nto death tomorrow, my dear.”",
        "I did not know it, but that was the last civilised dinner\nI was to eat for very many strange and terrible days.",
        "\n   The most extraordinary thing to my mind, of all the\nstrange and wonderful things that happened upon that\nFriday, was the dovetailing of the commonplace habits of\nour social order with the first beginnings of the series of\nevents that was to topple that social order headlong.  If on\nFriday night you had taken a pair of compasses and drawn a\ncircle with a radius of five miles round the Woking sand pits,\nI doubt if you would have had one human being outside it,\nunless it were some relation of Stent or of the three or four\ncyclists or London people lying dead on the common, whose\nemotions or habits were at all affected by the new-comers.\nMany people had heard of the cylinder, of course, and talked\nabout it in their leisure, but it certainly did not make the\nsensation that an ultimatum to Germany would have done.",
        "In London that night poor Henderson’s telegram describing\nthe gradual unscrewing of the shot was judged to be a canard,\nand his evening paper, after wiring for authentication from\nhim and receiving no reply--the man was killed--decided\nnot to print a special edition.",
        "Even within the five-mile circle the great majority of people\nwere inert.  I have already described the behaviour of the men\nand women to whom I spoke.  All over the district people\nwere dining and supping; working men were gardening after\nthe labours of the day, children were being put to bed, young\npeople were wandering through the lanes love-making, stu-\ndents sat over their books.",
        "Maybe there was a murmur in the village streets, a novel\nand dominant topic in the public-houses, and here and there\na messenger, or even an eye-witness of the later occurrences,\ncaused a whirl of excitement, a shouting, and a running to\nand fro; but for the most part the daily routine of working,\neating, drinking, sleeping, went on as it had done for count-\nless years--as though no planet Mars existed in the sky.\nEven at Woking station and Horsell and Chobham that was\nthe case.",
        " In Woking junction, until a late hour, trains were stopping\nand going on, others were shunting on the sidings, passengers\nwere alighting and waiting, and everything was proceeding\nin the most ordinary way.  A boy from the town, trenching\non Smith’s monopoly, was selling papers with the afternoon’s\nnews.  The ringing impact of trucks, the sharp whistle of the\nengines from the junction, mingled with their shouts of\n\"Men from Mars!”  Excited men came into the station about\nnine o’clock with incredible tidings, and caused no more\ndisturbance than drunkards might have done.  People rattling\nLondonwards peered into the darkness outside the carriage\nwindows, and saw only a rare, flickering, vanishing spark\ndance up from the direction of Horsell, a red glow and a\nthin veil of smoke driving across the stars, and thought that\nnothing more serious than a heath fire was happening.  It was\nonly round the edge of the common that any disturbance\nwas perceptible.  There were half a dozen villas burning on\nthe Woking border.  There were lights in all the houses on the\ncommon side of the three villages, and the people there kept\nawake till dawn.",
        "A curious crowd lingered restlessly, people coming and\ngoing but the crowd remaining, both on the Chobham and\nHorsell bridges.  One or two adventurous souls, it was after-\nwards found, went into the darkness and crawled quite near\nthe Martians; but they never returned, for now and again a\nlight-ray, like the beam of a warship’s searchlight swept the\ncommon, and the Heat-Ray was ready to follow.  Save for\nsuch, that big area of common was silent and desolate, and\nthe charred bodies lay about on it all night under the stars,\nand all the next day.  A noise of hammering from the pit was\nheard by many people.",
        "So you have the state of things on Friday night.  In the\ncentre, sticking into the skin of our old planet Earth like a\npoisoned dart, was this cylinder.  But the poison was scarcely\nworking yet.  Around it was a patch of silent common,\nsmouldering in places, and with a few dark, dimly seen\nobjects lying in contorted attitudes here and there.  Here and\nthere was a burning bush or tree.  Beyond was a fringe of\nexcitement, and farther than that fringe the inflammation\nhad not crept as yet.  In the rest of the world the stream of\nlife still flowed as it had flowed for immemorial years.  The\nfever of war that would presently clog vein and artery, deaden\nnerve and destroy brain, had still to develop.",
        "All night long the Martians were hammering and stirring,\nsleepless, indefatigable, at work upon the machines they\nwere making ready, and ever and again a puff of greenish-\nwhite smoke whirled up to the starlit sky.",
        "About eleven a company of soldiers came through Horsell,\nand deployed along the edge of the common to form a\ncordon.  Later a second company marched through Chobham\nto deploy on the north side of the common.  Several officers\nfrom the Inkerman barracks had been on the common earlier\nin the day, and one, Major Eden, was reported to be missing.\nThe colonel of the regiment came to the Chobham bridge\nand was busy questioning the crowd at midnight.  The military\nauthorities were certainly alive to the seriousness of the busi-\nness.  About eleven, the next morning’s papers were able to\nsay, a squadron of hussars, two Maxims, and about four\nhundred men of the Cardigan regiment started from Aldershot.",
        "A few seconds after midnight the crowd in the Chertsey\nroad, Woking, saw a star fall from heaven into the pine\nwoods to the northwest.  It had a greenish colour, and caused\na silent brightness like summer lightning.  This was the second\ncylinder.",
        "\n   Saturday lives in my memory as a day of suspense.  It\nwas a day of lassitude too, hot and close, with, I am told, a\nrapidly fluctuating barometer.  I had slept but little, though\nmy wife had succeeded in sleeping, and I rose early.  I went\ninto my garden before breakfast and stood listening, but\ntowards the common there was nothing stirring but a lark.",
        "The milkman came as usual.  I heard the rattle of his\nchariot and I went round to the side gate to ask the latest\nnews.  He told me that during the night the Martians had\nbeen surrounded by troops, and that guns were expected.\nThen--a familiar, reassuring note--I heard a train running\ntowards Woking.",
        "“They aren’t to be killed,” said the milkman, “if that can\npossibly be avoided.”",
        "I saw my neighbour gardening, chatted with him for a\ntime, and then strolled in to breakfast.  It was a most un-\nexceptional morning.  My neighbour was of opinion that the\ntroops would be able to capture or to destroy the Martians\nduring the day.",
        "“It’s a pity they make themselves so unapproachable,” he\nsaid.  “It would be curious to know how they live on another\nplanet; we might learn a thing or two.”",
        "He came up to the fence and extended a handful of straw-\nberries, for his gardening was as generous as it was enthusi-\nastic.  At the same time he told me of the burning of the pine\nwoods about the Byfleet Golf Links.",
        "“They say,” said he, “that there’s another of those blessed\nthings fallen there--number two.  But one’s enough, surely.\nThis lot’ll cost the insurance people a pretty penny before\neverything’s settled.”  He laughed with an air of the greatest\ngood humour as he said this.  The woods, he said, were still\nburning, and pointed out a haze of smoke to me.  “They will\nbe hot under foot for days, on account of the thick soil of\npine needles and turf,” he said, and then grew serious over\n\"poor Ogilvy.”",
        "After breakfast, instead of working, I decided to walk\ndown towards the common.  Under the railway bridge I found\na group of soldiers--sappers, I think, men in small round\ncaps, dirty red jackets unbuttoned, and showing their blue\nshirts, dark trousers, and boots coming to the calf.  They told\nme no one was allowed over the canal, and, looking along the\nroad towards the bridge, I saw one of the Cardigan men\nstanding sentinel there.  I talked with these soldiers for a\ntime; I told them of my sight of the Martians on the previous\nevening.  None of them had seen the Martians, and they had\nbut the vaguest ideas of them, so that they plied me with\nquestions.  They said that they did not know who had\nauthorised the movements of the troops; their idea was that\na dispute had arisen at the Horse Guards.  The ordinary\nsapper is a great deal better educated than the common\nsoldier, and they discussed the peculiar conditions of the\npossible fight with some acuteness.  I described the Heat-Ray\nto them, and they began to argue among themselves.",
        "“Crawl up under cover and rush ’em, say I,” said one.",
        "“Get aht!,” said another.  “What’s cover against this ’ere\n’eat?  Sticks to cook yer!  What we got to do is to go as near\nas the ground’ll let us, and then drive a trench.”",
        "“Blow yer trenches!  You always want trenches; you ought\nto ha” been born a rabbit Snippy.”",
        "“’Ain’t they got any necks, then?” said a third, abruptly--\na little, contemplative, dark man, smoking a pipe.",
        "I repeated my description.",
        "“Octopuses,” said he, “that’s what I calls ’em.  Talk about\nfishers of men--fighters of fish it is this time!”",
        "“It ain’t no murder killing beasts like that,” said the first\nspeaker.",
        "“Why not shell the darned things strite off and finish ’em?\"\nsaid the little dark man.  “You carn tell what they might do.”",
        "“Where’s your shells?” said the first speaker.  “There ain’t\nno time.  Do it in a rush, that’s my tip, and do it at once.”",
        "So they discussed it.  After a while I left them, and went\non to the railway station to get as many morning papers as\nI could.",
        " But I will not weary the reader with a description of that\nlong morning and of the longer afternoon.  I did not succeed\nin getting a glimpse of the common, for even Horsell and\nChobham church towers were in the hands of the military\nauthorities.  The soldiers I addressed didn’t know anything;\nthe officers were mysterious as well as busy.  I found people\nin the town quite secure again in the presence of the military,\nand I heard for the first time from Marshall, the tobacconist,\nthat his son was among the dead on the common.  The soldiers\nhad made the people on the outskirts of Horsell lock up and\nleave their houses.",
        "I got back to lunch about two, very tired for, as I have\nsaid, the day was extremely hot and dull; and in order to\nrefresh myself I took a cold bath in the afternoon.  About half\npast four I went up to the railway station to get an evening\npaper, for the morning papers had contained only a very\ninaccurate description of the killing of Stent, Henderson,\nOgilvy, and the others.  But there was little I didn’t know.\nThe Martians did not show an inch of themselves.  They\nseemed busy in their pit, and there was a sound of hammering\nand an almost continuous streamer of smoke.  Apparently they\nwere busy getting ready for a struggle.  “Fresh attempts have\nbeen made to signal, but without success,” was the stereo-\ntyped formula of the papers.  A sapper told me it was done by\na man in a ditch with a flag on a long pole.  The Martians\ntook as much notice of such advances as we should of the\nlowing of a cow.",
        "I must confess the sight of all this armament, all this\npreparation, greatly excited me.  My imagination became bel-\nligerent, and defeated the invaders in a dozen striking ways;\nsomething of my schoolboy dreams of battle and heroism\ncame back.  It hardly seemed a fair fight to me at that time.\nThey seemed very helpless in that pit of theirs.",
        "About three o’clock there began the thud of a gun at\nmeasured intervals from Chertsey or Addlestone.  I learned\nthat the smouldering pine wood into which the second cylin-\nder had fallen was being shelled, in the hope of destroying\nthat object before it opened.  It was only about five, however,\nthat a field gun reached Chobham for use against the first\nbody of Martians.",
        "About six in the evening, as I sat at tea with my wife in\nthe summerhouse talking vigorously about the battle that was\nlowering upon us, I heard a muffled detonation from the\ncommon, and immediately after a gust of firing.  Close on\nthe heels of that came a violent rattling crash, quite close\nto us, that shook the ground; and, starting out upon the lawn,\nI saw the tops of the trees about the Oriental College burst\ninto smoky red flame, and the tower of the little church beside\nit slide down into ruin.  The pinnacle of the mosque had\nvanished, and the roof line of the college itself looked as if\na hundred-ton gun had been at work upon it.  One of our\nchimneys cracked as if a shot had hit it, flew, and a piece\nof it came clattering down the tiles and made a heap of\nbroken red fragments upon the flower bed by my study\nwindow.",
        "I and my wife stood amazed.  Then I realised that the crest\nof Maybury Hill must be within range of the Martians” Heat-\nRay now that the college was cleared out of the way.",
        "At that I gripped my wife’s arm, and without ceremony\nran her out into the road.  Then I fetched out the servant,\ntelling her I would go upstairs myself for the box she was\nclamouring for.",
        "“We can’t possibly stay here,” I said; and as I spoke the\nfiring reopened for a moment upon the common.",
        "“But where are we to go?” said my wife in terror.",
        "I thought perplexed.  Then I remembered her cousins at\nLeatherhead.",
        "“Leatherhead!” I shouted above the sudden noise.",
        "She looked away from me downhill.  The people were\ncoming out of their houses, astonished.",
        "“How are we to get to Leatherhead?” she said.",
        "Down the hill I saw a bevy of hussars ride under the\nrailway bridge; three galloped through the open gates of\nthe Oriental College; two others dismounted, and began\nrunning from house to house.  The sun, shining through the\nsmoke that drove up from the tops of the trees, seemed blood\nred, and threw an unfamiliar lurid light upon everything.",
        "“Stop here,” said I; “you are safe here\"; and I started off\nat once for the Spotted Dog, for I knew the landlord had a\nhorse and dog cart.  I ran, for I perceived that in a moment\neveryone upon this side of the hill would be moving.  I found\nhim in his bar, quite unaware of what was going on behind\nhis house.  A man stood with his back to me, talking to him.",
        "“I must have a pound,” said the landlord, “and I’ve no\none to drive it.”",
        "“I’ll give you two,” said I, over the stranger’s shoulder.",
        "“What for?”",
        "“And I’ll bring it back by midnight,” I said.",
        "“Lord!” said the landlord; “what’s the hurry?  I’m selling\nmy bit of a pig.  Two pounds, and you bring it back?  What’s\ngoing on now?”",
        "I explained hastily that I had to leave my home, and so\nsecured the dog cart.  At the time it did not seem to me nearly\nso urgent that the landlord should leave his.  I took care to\nhave the cart there and then, drove it off down the road, and,\nleaving it in charge of my wife and servant, rushed into my\nhouse and packed a few valuables, such plate as we had, and\nso forth.  The beech trees below the house were burning while\nI did this, and the palings up the road glowed red.  While I\nwas occupied in this way, one of the dismounted hussars came\nrunning up.  He was going from house to house, warning peo-\nple to leave.  He was going on as I came out of my front\ndoor, lugging my treasures, done up in a tablecloth.  I shouted\nafter him:",
        "“What news?”",
        "He turned, stared, bawled something about “crawling out\nin a thing like a dish cover,” and ran on to the gate of the\nhouse at the crest.  A sudden whirl of black smoke driving\nacross the road hid him for a moment.  I ran to my neighbour’s\ndoor and rapped to satisfy myself of what I already knew, that\nhis wife had gone to London with him and had locked up\ntheir house.  I went in again, according to my promise, to get\nmy servant’s box, lugged it out, clapped it beside her on the\ntail of the dog cart, and then caught the reins and jumped\nup into the driver’s seat beside my wife.  In another moment\nwe were clear of the smoke and noise, and spanking down the\nopposite slope of Maybury Hill towards Old Woking.",
        "In front was a quiet sunny landscape, a wheat field ahead\non either side of the road, and the Maybury Inn with its\nswinging sign.  I saw the doctor’s cart ahead of me.  At the\nbottom of the hill I turned my head to look at the hillside I\nwas leaving.  Thick streamers of black smoke shot with threads\nof red fire were driving up into the still air, and throwing\ndark shadows upon the green treetops eastward.  The smoke\nalready extended far away to the east and west--to the By-\nfleet pine woods eastward, and to Woking on the west.  The\nroad was dotted with people running towards us.  And very\nfaint now, but very distinct through the hot, quiet air, one\nheard the whirr of a machine-gun that was presently stilled,\nand an intermittent cracking of rifles.  Apparently the Mar-\ntians were setting fire to everything within range of their\nHeat-Ray.",
        "I am not an expert driver, and I had immediately to turn\nmy attention to the horse.  When I looked back again the\nsecond hill had hidden the black smoke.  I slashed the horse\nwith the whip, and gave him a loose rein until Woking and\nSend lay between us and that quivering tumult.  I overtook\nand passed the doctor between Woking and Send.",
        "Leatherhead is about twelve miles from Maybury Hill.\nThe scent of hay was in the air through the lush meadows\nbeyond Pyrford, and the hedges on either side were sweet\nand gay with multitudes of dog-roses.  The heavy firing that\nhad broken out while we were driving down Maybury Hill\nceased as abruptly as it began, leaving the evening very peace-\nful and still.  We got to Leatherhead without misadventure\nabout nine o’clock, and the horse had an hour’s rest while\nI took supper with my cousins and commended my wife to\ntheir care.",
        "My wife was curiously silent throughout the drive, and\nseemed oppressed with forebodings of evil.  I talked to her\nreassuringly, pointing out that the Martians were tied to the\nPit by sheer heaviness, and at the utmost could but crawl\na little out of it; but she answered only in monosyllables.  Had\nit not been for my promise to the innkeeper, she would, I\nthink, have urged me to stay in Leatherhead that night.  Would\nthat I had!  Her face, I remember, was very white as we\nparted.",
        "For my own part, I had been feverishly excited all day.\nSomething very like the war fever that occasionally runs\nthrough a civilised community had got into my blood, and\nin my heart I was not so very sorry that I had to return to\nMaybury that night.  I was even afraid that that last fusillade\nI had heard might mean the extermination of our invaders\nfrom Mars.  I can best express my state of mind by saying\nthat I wanted to be in at the death.",
        "It was nearly eleven when I started to return.  The night\nwas unexpectedly dark; to me, walking out of the lighted\npassage of my cousins’ house, it seemed indeed black, and\nit was as hot and close as the day.  Overhead the clouds were\ndriving fast, albeit not a breath stirred the shrubs about us.\nMy cousins’ man lit both lamps.  Happily, I knew the road\nintimately.  My wife stood in the light of the doorway, and\nwatched me until I jumped up into the dog cart.  Then\nabruptly she turned and went in, leaving my cousins side by\nside wishing me good hap.",
        "I was a little depressed at first with the contagion of my\nwife’s fears, but very soon my thoughts reverted to the\nMartians.  At that time I was absolutely in the dark as to\nthe course of the evening’s fighting.  I did not know even the\ncircumstances that had precipitated the conflict.  As I came\nthrough Ockham (for that was the way I returned, and not\nthrough Send and Old Woking) I saw along the western\nhorizon a blood-red glow, which as I drew nearer, crept\nslowly up the sky.  The driving clouds of the gathering thunder-\nstorm mingled there with masses of black and red smoke.",
        "Ripley Street was deserted, and except for a lighted window\nor so the village showed not a sign of life; but I narrowly\nescaped an accident at the corner of the road to Pyrford,\nwhere a knot of people stood with their backs to me.  They\nsaid nothing to me as I passed.  I do not know what they\nknew of the things happening beyond the hill, nor do I know\nif the silent houses I passed on my way were sleeping securely,\nor deserted and empty, or harassed and watching against the\nterror of the night.",
        "From Ripley until I came through Pyrford I was in the\nvalley of the Wey, and the red glare was hidden from me.\nAs I ascended the little hill beyond Pyrford Church the glare\ncame into view again, and the trees about me shivered with\nthe first intimation of the storm that was upon me.  Then I\nheard midnight pealing out from Pyrford Church behind me,\nand then came the silhouette of Maybury Hill, with its tree-\ntops and roofs black and sharp against the red.",
        "Even as I beheld this a lurid green glare lit the road about\nme and showed the distant woods towards Addlestone.  I felt\na tug at the reins.  I saw that the driving clouds had been\npierced as it were by a thread of green fire, suddenly lighting\ntheir confusion and falling into the field to my left.  It was\nthe third falling star!",
        "Close on its apparition, and blindingly violet by contrast,\ndanced out the first lightning of the gathering storm, and the\nthunder burst like a rocket overhead.  The horse took the bit\nbetween his teeth and bolted.",
        "A moderate incline runs towards the foot of Maybury Hill,\nand down this we clattered.  Once the lightning had begun,\nit went on in as rapid a succession of flashes as I have ever\nseen.  The thunderclaps, treading one on the heels of another\nand with a strange crackling accompaniment, sounded more\nlike the working of a gigantic electric machine than the usual\ndetonating reverberations.  The flickering light was blinding\nand confusing, and a thin hail smote gustily at my face as\nI drove down the slope.",
        "At first I regarded little but the road before me, and then\nabruptly my attention was arrested by something that was\nmoving rapidly down the opposite slope of Maybury Hill.  At\nfirst I took it for the wet roof of a house, but one flash\nfollowing another showed it to be in swift rolling movement.\nIt was an elusive vision--a moment of bewildering darkness, and\nthen, in a flash like daylight, the red masses of the Orphanage\nnear the crest of the hill, the green tops of the pine trees,\nand this problematical object came out clear and sharp and\nbright.",
        "And this Thing I saw!  How can I describe it?  A monstrous\ntripod, higher than many houses, striding over the young\npine trees, and smashing them aside in its career; a walking\nengine of glittering metal, striding now across the heather;\narticulate ropes of steel dangling from it, and the clattering\ntumult of its passage mingling with the riot of the thunder.\nA flash, and it came out vividly, heeling over one way with\ntwo feet in the air, to vanish and reappear almost instantly\nas it seemed, with the next flash, a hundred yards nearer.\nCan you imagine a milking stool tilted and bowled violently\nalong the ground?  That was the impression those instant\nflashes gave.  But instead of a milking stool imagine it a\ngreat body of machinery on a tripod stand.",
        "Then suddenly the trees in the pine wood ahead of me\nwere parted, as brittle reeds are parted by a man thrusting\nthrough them; they were snapped off and driven headlong,\nand a second huge tripod appeared, rushing, as it seemed,\nheadlong towards me.  And I was galloping hard to meet it!\nAt the sight of the second monster my nerve went altogether.\nNot stopping to look again, I wrenched the horse’s head hard\nround to the right and in another moment the dog cart had\nheeled over upon the horse; the shafts smashed noisily, and\nI was flung sideways and fell heavily into a shallow pool of\nwater.",
        "I crawled out almost immediately, and crouched, my feet\nstill in the water, under a clump of furze.  The horse lay\nmotionless (his neck was broken, poor brute!) and by the\nlightning flashes I saw the black bulk of the overturned dog\ncart and the silhouette of the wheel still spinning slowly.  In\nanother moment the colossal mechanism went striding by\nme, and passed uphill towards Pyrford.",
        "Seen nearer, the Thing was incredibly strange, for it was\nno mere insensate machine driving on its way.  Machine it was,\nwith a ringing metallic pace, and long, flexible, glittering\ntentacles (one of which gripped a young pine tree) swinging\nand rattling about its strange body.  It picked its road as it\nwent striding along, and the brazen hood that surmounted\nit moved to and fro with the inevitable suggestion of a head\nlooking about.  Behind the main body was a huge mass of\nwhite metal like a gigantic fisherman’s basket, and puffs of\ngreen smoke squirted out from the joints of the limbs as the\nmonster swept by me.  And in an instant it was gone.",
        "So much I saw then, all vaguely for the flickering of the\nlightning, in blinding highlights and dense black shadows.",
        "As it passed it set up an exultant deafening howl that\ndrowned the thunder--\"Aloo!  Aloo!\"--and in another minute\nit was with its companion, half a mile away, stooping over\nsomething in the field.  I have no doubt this Thing in the field\nwas the third of the ten cylinders they had fired at us from\nMars.",
        "For some minutes I lay there in the rain and darkness\nwatching, by the intermittent light, these monstrous beings\nof metal moving about in the distance over the hedge tops.\nA thin hail was now beginning, and as it came and went their\nfigures grew misty and then flashed into clearness again.  Now\nand then came a gap in the lightning, and the night swallowed\nthem up.",
        "I was soaked with hail above and puddle water below.\nIt was some time before my blank astonishment would let\nme struggle up the bank to a drier position, or think at all of\nmy imminent peril.",
        "Not far from me was a little one-roomed squatter’s hut of\nwood, surrounded by a patch of potato garden.  I struggled\nto my feet at last, and, crouching and making use of every\nchance of cover, I made a run for this.  I hammered at the\ndoor, but I could not make the people hear (if there were\nany people inside), and after a time I desisted, and, availing\nmyself of a ditch for the greater part of the way, succeeded\nin crawling, unobserved by these monstrous machines, into\nthe pine woods towards Maybury.",
        "Under cover of this I pushed on, wet and shivering now,\ntowards my own house.  I walked among the trees trying to\nfind the footpath.  It was very dark indeed in the wood, for\nthe lightning was now becoming infrequent, and the hail,\nwhich was pouring down in a torrent, fell in columns through\nthe gaps in the heavy foliage.",
        "If I had fully realised the meaning of all the things I had\nseen I should have immediately worked my way round through\nByfleet to Street Cobham, and so gone back to rejoin my wife\nat Leatherhead.  But that night the strangeness of things about\nme, and my physical wretchedness, prevented me, for I was\nbruised, weary, wet to the skin, deafened and blinded by\nthe storm.",
        "I had a vague idea of going on to my own house, and\nthat was as much motive as I had.  I staggered through the\ntrees, fell into a ditch and bruised my knees against a plank,\nand finally splashed out into the lane that ran down from\nthe College Arms.  I say splashed, for the storm water was\nsweeping the sand down the hill in a muddy torrent.  There\nin the darkness a man blundered into me and sent me reeling\nback.",
        "He gave a cry of terror, sprang sideways, and rushed on\nbefore I could gather my wits sufficiently to speak to him.\nSo heavy was the stress of the storm just at this place that\nI had the hardest task to win my way up the hill.  I went close\nup to the fence on the left and worked my way along its\npalings.",
        "Near the top I stumbled upon something soft, and, by a\nflash of lightning, saw between my feet a heap of black broad-\ncloth and a pair of boots.  Before I could distinguish clearly\nhow the man lay, the flicker of light had passed.  I stood over\nhim waiting for the next flash.  When it came, I saw that he\nwas a sturdy man, cheaply but not shabbily dressed; his head\nwas bent under his body, and he lay crumpled up close to\nthe fence, as though he had been flung violently against it.",
        "Overcoming the repugnance natural to one who had never\nbefore touched a dead body, I stooped and turned him over\nto feel for his heart.  He was quite dead.  Apparently his neck\nhad been broken.  The lightning flashed for a third time, and\nhis face leaped upon me.  I sprang to my feet.  It was the\nlandlord of the Spotted Dog, whose conveyance I had taken.",
        "I stepped over him gingerly and pushed on up the hill.  I\nmade my way by the police station and the College Arms\ntowards my own house.  Nothing was burning on the hillside,\nthough from the common there still came a red glare and a\nrolling tumult of ruddy smoke beating up against the drench-\ning hail.  So far as I could see by the flashes, the houses\nabout me were mostly uninjured.  By the College Arms a dark\nheap lay in the road.",
        "Down the road towards Maybury Bridge there were voices\nand the sound of feet, but I had not the courage to shout or\nto go to them.  I let myself in with my latchkey, closed, locked\nand bolted the door, staggered to the foot of the staircase, and\nsat down.  My imagination was full of those striding metallic\nmonsters, and of the dead body smashed against the fence.",
        "I crouched at the foot of the staircase with my back to the\nwall, shivering violently.",
        "I have already said that my storms of emotion have a\ntrick of exhausting themselves.  After a time I discovered that\nI was cold and wet, and with little pools of water about me\non the stair carpet.  I got up almost mechanically, went into\nthe dining room and drank some whiskey, and then I was\nmoved to change my clothes.",
        "After I had done that I went upstairs to my study, but why\nI did so I do not know.  The window of my study looks over\nthe trees and the railway towards Horsell Common.  In the\nhurry of our departure this window had been left open.\nThe passage was dark, and, by contrast with the picture the\nwindow frame enclosed, the side of the room seemed im-\npenetrably dark.  I stopped short in the doorway.",
        "The thunderstorm had passed.  The towers of the Oriental\nCollege and the pine trees about it had gone, and very far\naway, lit by a vivid red glare, the common about the sand\npits was visible.  Across the light huge black shapes, gro-\ntesque and strange, moved busily to and fro.",
        "It seemed indeed as if the whole country in that direction\nwas on fire--a broad hillside set with minute tongues of flame,\nswaying and writhing with the gusts of the dying storm, and\nthrowing a red reflection upon the cloud scud above.  Every\nnow and then a haze of smoke from some nearer conflagra-\ntion drove across the window and hid the Martian shapes.\nI could not see what they were doing, nor the clear form of\nthem, nor recognise the black objects they were busied upon.\nNeither could I see the nearer fire, though the reflections of\nit danced on the wall and ceiling of the study.  A sharp,\nresinous tang of burning was in the air.",
        "I closed the door noiselessly and crept towards the window.\nAs I did so, the view opened out until, on the one hand, it\nreached to the houses about Woking station, and on the other\nto the charred and blackened pine woods of Byfleet.  There\nwas a light down below the hill, on the railway, near the\narch, and several of the houses along the Maybury road\nand the streets near the station were glowing ruins.  The light\nupon the railway puzzled me at first; there were a black heap\nand a vivid glare, and to the right of that a row of yellow\noblongs.  Then I perceived this was a wrecked train, the fore\npart smashed and on fire, the hinder carriages still upon\nthe rails.",
        "Between these three main centres of light--the houses,\nthe train, and the burning county towards Chobham--\nstretched irregular patches of dark country, broken here and\nthere by intervals of dimly glowing and smoking ground.\nIt was the strangest spectacle, that black expanse set with\nfire.  It reminded me, more than anything else, of the Potteries\nat night.  At first I could distinguish no people at all, though\nI peered intently for them.  Later I saw against the light of\nWoking station a number of black figures hurrying one after\nthe other across the line.",
        "And this was the little world in which I had been living\nsecurely for years, this fiery chaos!  What had happened in\nthe last seven hours I still did not know; nor did I know,\nthough I was beginning to guess, the relation between these\nmechanical colossi and the sluggish lumps I had seen dis-\ngorged from the cylinder.  With a queer feeling of impersonal\ninterest I turned my desk chair to the window, sat down,\nand stared at the blackened country, and particularly at the\nthree gigantic black things that were going to and fro in\nthe glare about the sand pits.",
        "They seemed amazingly busy.  I began to ask myself what\nthey could be.  Were they intelligent mechanisms?  Such a\nthing I felt was impossible.  Or did a Martian sit within each,\nruling, directing, using, much as a man’s brain sits and rules\nin his body?  I began to compare the things to human ma-\nchines, to ask myself for the first time in my life how an\nironclad or a steam engine would seem to an intelligent\nlower animal.",
        "The storm had left the sky clear, and over the smoke of the\nburning land the little fading pinpoint of Mars was dropping\ninto the west, when a soldier came into my garden.  I heard\na slight scraping at the fence, and rousing myself from the\nlethargy that had fallen upon me, I looked down and saw\nhim dimly, clambering over the palings.  At the sight of\nanother human being my torpor passed, and I leaned out\nof the window eagerly.",
        "“Hist!” said I, in a whisper.",
        "He stopped astride of the fence in doubt.  Then he came\nover and across the lawn to the corner of the house.  He bent\ndown and stepped softly.",
        "“Who’s there?” he said, also whispering, standing under\nthe window and peering up.",
        "“Where are you going?” I asked.",
        "“God knows.”",
        "“Are you trying to hide?”",
        "“That’s it.”",
        "“Come into the house,” I said.",
        "I went down, unfastened the door, and let him in, and\nlocked the door again.  I could not see his face.  He was\nhatless, and his coat was unbuttoned.",
        "“My God!” he said, as I drew him in.",
        "“What has happened?” I asked.",
        "“What hasn’t?”  In the obscurity I could see he made a\ngesture of despair.  “They wiped us out--simply wiped us\nout,” he repeated again and again.",
        "He followed me, almost mechanically, into the dining\nroom.",
        "“Take some whiskey,” I said, pouring out a stiff dose.",
        "He drank it.  Then abruptly he sat down before the table,\nput his head on his arms, and began to sob and weep like a\nlittle boy, in a perfect passion of emotion, while I, with a\ncurious forgetfulness of my own recent despair, stood beside\nhim, wondering.",
        "It was a long time before he could steady his nerves to\nanswer my questions, and then he answered perplexingly and\nbrokenly.  He was a driver in the artillery, and had only come\ninto action about seven.  At that time firing was going on\nacross the common, and it was said the first party of Martians\nwere crawling slowly towards their second cylinder under\ncover of a metal shield.",
        "Later this shield staggered up on tripod legs and became\nthe first of the fighting-machines I had seen.  The gun he\ndrove had been unlimbered near Horsell, in order to com-\nmand the sand pits, and its arrival it was that had precipi-\ntated the action.  As the limber gunners went to the rear, his\nhorse trod in a rabbit hole and came down, throwing him\ninto a depression of the ground.  At the same moment the\ngun exploded behind him, the ammunition blew up, there\nwas fire all about him, and he found himself lying under a\nheap of charred dead men and dead horses.",
        "“I lay still,” he said, “scared out of my wits, with the fore\nquarter of a horse atop of me.  We’d been wiped out.  And\nthe smell--good God!  Like burnt meat!  I was hurt across the\nback by the fall of the horse, and there I had to lie until I\nfelt better.  Just like parade it had been a minute before--\nthen stumble, bang, swish!”",
        "“Wiped out!” he said.",
        "He had hid under the dead horse for a long time, peeping\nout furtively across the common.  The Cardigan men had\ntried a rush, in skirmishing order, at the pit, simply to be\nswept out of existence.  Then the monster had risen to its\nfeet and had begun to walk leisurely to and fro across the\ncommon among the few fugitives, with its headlike hood\nturning about exactly like the head of a cowled human being.\nA kind of arm carried a complicated metallic case, about\nwhich green flashes scintillated, and out of the funnel of\nthis there smoked the Heat-Ray.",
        "In a few minutes there was, so far as the soldier could see,\nnot a living thing left upon the common, and every bush and\ntree upon it that was not already a blackened skeleton was\nburning.  The hussars had been on the road beyond the\ncurvature of the ground, and he saw nothing of them.  He\nheard the Martians rattle for a time and then become still.\nThe giant saved Woking station and its cluster of houses until\nthe last; then in a moment the Heat-Ray was brought to bear,\nand the town became a heap of fiery ruins.  Then the Thing\nshut off the Heat-Ray, and turning its back upon the artillery-\nman, began to waddle away towards the smouldering pine\nwoods that sheltered the second cylinder.  As it did so a\nsecond glittering Titan built itself up out of the pit.",
        "The second monster followed the first, and at that the\nartilleryman began to crawl very cautiously across the hot\nheather ash towards Horsell.  He managed to get alive into\nthe ditch by the side of the road, and so escaped to Woking.\nThere his story became ejaculatory.  The place was impassable.\nIt seems there were a few people alive there, frantic for the\nmost part and many burned and scalded.  He was turned\naside by the fire, and hid among some almost scorching heaps\nof broken wall as one of the Martian giants returned.  He\nsaw this one pursue a man, catch him up in one of its steely\ntentacles, and knock his head against the trunk of a pine\ntree.  At last, after nightfall, the artilleryman made a rush\nfor it and got over the railway embankment.",
        "Since then he had been skulking along towards Maybury,\nin the hope of getting out of danger Londonward.  People\nwere hiding in trenches and cellars, and many of the survivors\nhad made off towards Woking village and Send.  He had been\nconsumed with thirst until he found one of the water mains\nnear the railway arch smashed, and the water bubbling out\nlike a spring upon the road.",
        "That was the story I got from him, bit by bit.  He grew\ncalmer telling me and trying to make me see the things he\nhad seen.  He had eaten no food since midday, he told me\nearly in his narrative, and I found some mutton and bread\nin the pantry and brought it into the room.  We lit no lamp\nfor fear of attracting the Martians, and ever and again our\nhands would touch upon bread or meat.  As he talked, things\nabout us came darkly out of the darkness, and the trampled\nbushes and broken rose trees outside the window grew dis-\ntinct.  It would seem that a number of men or animals had\nrushed across the lawn.  I began to see his face, blackened\nand haggard, as no doubt mine was also.",
        "When we had finished eating we went softly upstairs to\nmy study, and I looked again out of the open window.  In\none night the valley had become a valley of ashes.  The fires\nhad dwindled now.  Where flames had been there were now\nstreamers of smoke; but the countless ruins of shattered and\ngutted houses and blasted and blackened trees that the night\nhad hidden stood out now gaunt and terrible in the pitiless\nlight of dawn.  Yet here and there some object had had the\nluck to escape--a white railway signal here, the end of a\ngreenhouse there, white and fresh amid the wreckage.  Never\nbefore in the history of warfare had destruction been so\nindiscriminate and so universal.  And shining with the growing\nlight of the east, three of the metallic giants stood about\nthe pit, their cowls rotating as though they were surveying\nthe desolation they had made.",
        "It seemed to me that the pit had been enlarged, and ever\nand again puffs of vivid green vapour streamed up and out of\nit towards the brightening dawn--streamed up, whirled,\nbroke, and vanished.",
        "Beyond were the pillars of fire about Chobham.  They\nbecame pillars of bloodshot smoke at the first touch of day.",
        "\n   As the dawn grew brighter we withdrew from the win-\ndow from which we had watched the Martians, and went\nvery quietly downstairs.",
        "The artilleryman agreed with me that the house was no\nplace to stay in.  He proposed, he said, to make his way\nLondonward, and thence rejoin his battery--No. 12, of the\nHorse Artillery.  My plan was to return at once to Leather-\nhead; and so greatly had the strength of the Martians im-\npressed me that I had determined to take my wife to New-\nhaven, and go with her out of the country forthwith.  For I\nalready perceived clearly that the country about London\nmust inevitably be the scene of a disastrous struggle before\nsuch creatures as these could be destroyed.",
        "Between us and Leatherhead, however, lay the third cylin-\nder, with its guarding giants.  Had I been alone, I think I\nshould have taken my chance and struck across country.  But\nthe artilleryman dissuaded me: “It’s no kindness to the right\nsort of wife,” he said, “to make her a widow\"; and in the end\nI agreed to go with him, under cover of the woods, northward\nas far as Street Cobham before I parted with him.  Thence I\nwould make a big detour by Epsom to reach Leatherhead.",
        "I should have started at once, but my companion had been\nin active service and he knew better than that.  He made me\nransack the house for a flask, which he filled with whiskey;\nand we lined every available pocket with packets of biscuits\nand slices of meat.  Then we crept out of the house, and ran\nas quickly as we could down the ill-made road by which I\nhad come overnight.  The houses seemed deserted.  In the\nroad lay a group of three charred bodies close together,\nstruck dead by the Heat-Ray; and here and there were things\nthat people had dropped--a clock, a slipper, a silver spoon,\nand the like poor valuables.  At the corner turning up towards\nthe post office a little cart, filled with boxes and furniture,\nand horseless, heeled over on a broken wheel.  A cash box had\nbeen hastily smashed open and thrown under the debris.",
        "Except the lodge at the Orphanage, which was still on fire,\nnone of the houses had suffered very greatly here.  The Heat-\nRay had shaved the chimney tops and passed.  Yet, save our-\nselves, there did not seem to be a living soul on Maybury\nHill.  The majority of the inhabitants had escaped, I suppose,\nby way of the Old Woking road--the road I had taken when\nI drove to Leatherhead--or they had hidden.",
        "We went down the lane, by the body of the man in black,\nsodden now from the overnight hail, and broke into the\nwoods at the foot of the hill.  We pushed through these\ntowards the railway without meeting a soul.  The woods\nacross the line were but the scarred and blackened ruins of\nwoods; for the most part the trees had fallen, but a certain\nproportion still stood, dismal grey stems, with dark brown\nfoliage instead of green.",
        "On our side the fire had done no more than scorch the\nnearer trees; it had failed to secure its footing.  In one place\nthe woodmen had been at work on Saturday; trees, felled\nand freshly trimmed, lay in a clearing, with heaps of sawdust\nby the sawing-machine and its engine.  Hard by was a tem-\nporary hut, deserted.  There was not a breath of wind this\nmorning, and everything was strangely still.  Even the birds\nwere hushed, and as we hurried along I and the artilleryman\ntalked in whispers and looked now and again over our\nshoulders.  Once or twice we stopped to listen.",
        "After a time we drew near the road, and as we did so we\nheard the clatter of hoofs and saw through the tree stems\nthree cavalry soldiers riding slowly towards Woking.  We\nhailed them, and they halted while we hurried towards them.\nIt was a lieutenant and a couple of privates of the 8th Hus-\nsars, with a stand like a theodolite, which the artilleryman\ntold me was a heliograph.",
        "“You are the first men I’ve seen coming this way this morn-\ning,” said the lieutenant.  “What’s brewing?”",
        "His voice and face were eager.  The men behind him stared\ncuriously.  The artilleryman jumped down the bank into the\nroad and saluted.",
        "“Gun destroyed last night, sir.  Have been hiding.  Trying\nto rejoin battery, sir.  You’ll come in sight of the Martians, I\nexpect, about half a mile along this road.”",
        "“What the dickens are they like?” asked the lieutenant.",
        "“Giants in armour, sir.  Hundred feet high.  Three legs and\na body like ’luminium, with a mighty great head in a hood,\nsir.”",
        "“Get out!” said the lieutenant.  “What confounded non-\nsense!”",
        "“You’ll see, sir.  They carry a kind of box, sir, that shoots\nfire and strikes you dead.”",
        "“What d’ye mean--a gun?”",
        "“No, sir,” and the artilleryman began a vivid account of\nthe Heat-Ray.  Halfway through, the lieutenant interrupted\nhim and looked up at me.  I was still standing on the bank by\nthe side of the road.",
        "“It’s perfectly true,” I said.",
        "“Well,” said the lieutenant, “I suppose it’s my business to\nsee it too.  Look here\"--to the artilleryman--\"we’re detailed\nhere clearing people out of their houses.  You’d better go\nalong and report yourself to Brigadier-General Marvin, and\ntell him all you know.  He’s at Weybridge.  Know the way?”",
        "“I do,” I said; and he turned his horse southward again.",
        "“Half a mile, you say?” said he.",
        "“At most,” I answered, and pointed over the treetops south-\nward.  He thanked me and rode on, and we saw them no\nmore.",
        "Farther along we came upon a group of three women and\ntwo children in the road, busy clearing out a labourer’s cot-\ntage.  They had got hold of a little hand truck, and were piling\nit up with unclean-looking bundles and shabby furniture.\nThey were all too assiduously engaged to talk to us as we\npassed.",
        "By Byfleet station we emerged from the pine trees, and\nfound the country calm and peaceful under the morning sun-\nlight.  We were far beyond the range of the Heat-Ray there,\nand had it not been for the silent desertion of some of the\nhouses, the stirring movement of packing in others, and the\nknot of soldiers standing on the bridge over the railway and\nstaring down the line towards Woking, the day would have\nseemed very like any other Sunday.",
        "Several farm waggons and carts were moving creakily\nalong the road to Addlestone, and suddenly through the gate\nof a field we saw, across a stretch of flat meadow, six twelve-\npounders standing neatly at equal distances pointing towards\nWoking.  The gunners stood by the guns waiting, and the\nammunition waggons were at a business-like distance.  The\nmen stood almost as if under inspection.",
        "“That’s good!” said I.  “They will get one fair shot, at any\nrate.”",
        "The artilleryman hesitated at the gate.",
        "“I shall go on,” he said.",
        "Farther on towards Weybridge, just over the bridge, there\nwere a number of men in white fatigue jackets throwing up\na long rampart, and more guns behind.",
        "“It’s bows and arrows against the lightning, anyhow,” said\nthe artilleryman.  “They ’aven’t seen that fire-beam yet.”",
        "The officers who were not actively engaged stood and\nstared over the treetops southwestward, and the men digging\nwould stop every now and again to stare in the same direc-\ntion.",
        "Byfleet was in a tumult; people packing, and a score of\nhussars, some of them dismounted, some on horseback, were\nhunting them about.  Three or four black government wag-\ngons, with crosses in white circles, and an old omnibus, among\nother vehicles, were being loaded in the village street.  There\nwere scores of people, most of them sufficiently sabbatical to\nhave assumed their best clothes.  The soldiers were having\nthe greatest difficulty in making them realise the gravity of\ntheir position.  We saw one shrivelled old fellow with a huge\nbox and a score or more of flower pots containing orchids,\nangrily expostulating with the corporal who would leave them\nbehind.  I stopped and gripped his arm.",
        "“Do you know what’s over there?” I said, pointing at the\npine tops that hid the Martians.",
        "“Eh?” said he, turning.  “I was explainin” these is vallyble.”",
        "“Death!” I shouted.  “Death is coming!  Death!” and leaving\nhim to digest that if he could, I hurried on after the artillery-\nman.  At the corner I looked back.  The soldier had left him,\nand he was still standing by his box, with the pots of orchids\non the lid of it, and staring vaguely over the trees.",
        " No one in Weybridge could tell us where the headquarters\nwere established; the whole place was in such confusion as I\nhad never seen in any town before.  Carts, carriages every-\nwhere, the most astonishing miscellany of conveyances and\nhorseflesh.  The respectable inhabitants of the place, men in\ngolf and boating costumes, wives prettily dressed, were pack-\ning, river-side loafers energetically helping, children excited,\nand, for the most part, highly delighted at this astonishing\nvariation of their Sunday experiences.  In the midst of it all\nthe worthy vicar was very pluckily holding an early celebra-\ntion, and his bell was jangling out above the excitement.",
        "I and the artilleryman, seated on the step of the drinking\nfountain, made a very passable meal upon what we had\nbrought with us.  Patrols of soldiers--here no longer hussars,\nbut grenadiers in white--were warning people to move now\nor to take refuge in their cellars as soon as the firing began.\nWe saw as we crossed the railway bridge that a growing\ncrowd of people had assembled in and about the railway\nstation, and the swarming platform was piled with boxes and\npackages.  The ordinary traffic had been stopped, I believe, in\norder to allow of the passage of troops and guns to Chertsey,\nand I have heard since that a savage struggle occurred for\nplaces in the special trains that were put on at a later hour.",
        "We remained at Weybridge until midday, and at that hour\nwe found ourselves at the place near Shepperton Lock where\nthe Wey and Thames join.  Part of the time we spent helping\ntwo old women to pack a little cart.  The Wey has a treble\nmouth, and at this point boats are to be hired, and there was\na ferry across the river.  On the Shepperton side was an inn\nwith a lawn, and beyond that the tower of Shepperton Church\n--it has been replaced by a spire--rose above the trees.",
        "Here we found an excited and noisy crowd of fugitives.  As\nyet the flight had not grown to a panic, but there were already\nfar more people than all the boats going to and fro could\nenable to cross.  People came panting along under heavy bur-\ndens; one husband and wife were even carrying a small out-\nhouse door between them, with some of their household goods\npiled thereon.  One man told us he meant to try to get away\nfrom Shepperton station.",
        "There was a lot of shouting, and one man was even jesting.\nThe idea people seemed to have here was that the Martians\nwere simply formidable human beings, who might attack and\nsack the town, to be certainly destroyed in the end.  Every\nnow and then people would glance nervously across the Wey,\nat the meadows towards Chertsey, but everything over there\nwas still.",
        "Across the Thames, except just where the boats landed,\neverything was quiet, in vivid contrast with the Surrey side.\nThe people who landed there from the boats went tramping\noff down the lane.  The big ferryboat had just made a\njourney.  Three or four soldiers stood on the lawn of the inn,\nstaring and jesting at the fugitives, without offering to help.\nThe inn was closed, as it was now within prohibited hours.",
        "“What’s that?” cried a boatman, and “Shut up, you fool!\"\nsaid a man near me to a yelping dog.  Then the sound came\nagain, this time from the direction of Chertsey, a muffled\nthud--the sound of a gun.",
        "The fighting was beginning.  Almost immediately unseen\nbatteries across the river to our right, unseen because of the\ntrees, took up the chorus, firing heavily one after the other.\nA woman screamed.  Everyone stood arrested by the sudden\nstir of battle, near us and yet invisible to us.  Nothing was to\nbe seen save flat meadows, cows feeding unconcernedly for\nthe most part, and silvery pollard willows motionless in the\nwarm sunlight.",
        "“The sojers’ll stop ’em,” said a woman beside me, doubt-\nfully.  A haziness rose over the treetops.",
        "Then suddenly we saw a rush of smoke far away up the\nriver, a puff of smoke that jerked up into the air and hung;\nand forthwith the ground heaved under foot and a heavy\nexplosion shook the air, smashing two or three windows in\nthe houses near, and leaving us astonished.",
        "“Here they are!” shouted a man in a blue jersey.  “Yonder!\nD’yer see them?  Yonder!”",
        "Quickly, one after the other, one, two, three, four of the\narmoured Martians appeared, far away over the little trees,\nacross the flat meadows that stretched towards Chertsey, and\nstriding hurriedly towards the river.  Little cowled figures they\nseemed at first, going with a rolling motion and as fast as\nflying birds.",
        "Then, advancing obliquely towards us, came a fifth.  Their\narmoured bodies glittered in the sun as they swept swiftly\nforward upon the guns, growing rapidly larger as they drew\nnearer.  One on the extreme left, the remotest that is, flour-\nished a huge case high in the air, and the ghostly, terrible\nHeat-Ray I had already seen on Friday night smote towards\nChertsey, and struck the town.",
        "At sight of these strange, swift, and terrible creatures the\ncrowd near the water’s edge seemed to me to be for a moment\nhorror-struck.  There was no screaming or shouting, but a\nsilence.  Then a hoarse murmur and a movement of feet--a\nsplashing from the water.  A man, too frightened to drop the\nportmanteau he carried on his shoulder, swung round and\nsent me staggering with a blow from the corner of his burden.\nA woman thrust at me with her hand and rushed past me.  I\nturned with the rush of the people, but I was not too terrified\nfor thought.  The terrible Heat-Ray was in my mind.  To get\nunder water!  That was it!",
        "“Get under water!” I shouted, unheeded.",
        "I faced about again, and rushed towards the approaching\nMartian, rushed right down the gravelly beach and headlong\ninto the water.  Others did the same.  A boatload of people\nputting back came leaping out as I rushed past.  The stones\nunder my feet were muddy and slippery, and the river was\nso low that I ran perhaps twenty feet scarcely waist-deep.\nThen, as the Martian towered overhead scarcely a couple of\nhundred yards away, I flung myself forward under the sur-\nface.  The splashes of the people in the boats leaping into the\nriver sounded like thunderclaps in my ears.  People were\nlanding hastily on both sides of the river.\n  But the Martian machine took no more notice for the\nmoment of the people running this way and that than a man\nwould of the confusion of ants in a nest against which his\nfoot has kicked.  When, half suffocated, I raised my head\nabove water, the Martian’s hood pointed at the batteries that\nwere still firing across the river, and as it advanced it swung\nloose what must have been the generator of the Heat-Ray.",
        "In another moment it was on the bank, and in a stride wad-\ning halfway across.  The knees of its foremost legs bent at\nthe farther bank, and in another moment it had raised itself\nto its full height again, close to the village of Shepperton.\nForthwith the six guns which, unknown to anyone on the\nright bank, had been hidden behind the outskirts of that\nvillage, fired simultaneously.  The sudden near concussion,\nthe last close upon the first, made my heart jump.  The\nmonster was already raising the case generating the Heat-Ray\nas the first shell burst six yards above the hood.",
        "I gave a cry of astonishment.  I saw and thought nothing of\nthe other four Martian monsters; my attention was riveted\nupon the nearer incident.  Simultaneously two other shells\nburst in the air near the body as the hood twisted round in\ntime to receive, but not in time to dodge, the fourth shell.",
        "The shell burst clean in the face of the Thing.  The hood\nbulged, flashed, was whirled off in a dozen tattered frag-\nments of red flesh and glittering metal.",
        "“Hit!” shouted I, with something between a scream and a\ncheer.",
        "I heard answering shouts from the people in the water\nabout me.  I could have leaped out of the water with that\nmomentary exultation.",
        "The decapitated colossus reeled like a drunken giant; but\nit did not fall over.  It recovered its balance by a miracle,\nand, no longer heeding its steps and with the camera that fired\nthe Heat-Ray now rigidly upheld, it reeled swiftly upon Shep-\nperton.  The living intelligence, the Martian within the hood,\nwas slain and splashed to the four winds of heaven, and the\nThing was now but a mere intricate device of metal whirling\nto destruction.  It drove along in a straight line, incapable of\nguidance.  It struck the tower of Shepperton Church, smash-\ning it down as the impact of a battering ram might have\ndone, swerved aside, blundered on and collapsed with tre-\nmendous force into the river out of my sight.",
        "A violent explosion shook the air, and a spout of water,\nsteam, mud, and shattered metal shot far up into the sky.\nAs the camera of the Heat-Ray hit the water, the latter had\nimmediately flashed into steam.  In another moment a huge\nwave, like a muddy tidal bore but almost scaldingly hot, came\nsweeping round the bend upstream.  I saw people struggling\nshorewards, and heard their screaming and shouting faintly\nabove the seething and roar of the Martian’s collapse.",
        "For a moment I heeded nothing of the heat, forgot the\npatent need of self-preservation.  I splashed through the tu-\nmultuous water, pushing aside a man in black to do so, until\nI could see round the bend.  Half a dozen deserted boats\npitched aimlessly upon the confusion of the waves.  The fallen\nMartian came into sight downstream, lying across the river,\nand for the most part submerged.",
        "Thick clouds of steam were pouring off the wreckage, and\nthrough the tumultuously whirling wisps I could see, inter-\nmittently and vaguely, the gigantic limbs churning the water\nand flinging a splash and spray of mud and froth into the air.\nThe tentacles swayed and struck like living arms, and, save\nfor the helpless purposelessness of these movements, it was\nas if some wounded thing were struggling for its life amid\nthe waves.  Enormous quantities of a ruddy-brown fluid were\nspurting up in noisy jets out of the machine.",
        "My attention was diverted from this death flurry by a\nfurious yelling, like that of the thing called a siren in our\nmanufacturing towns.  A man, knee-deep near the towing\npath, shouted inaudibly to me and pointed.  Looking back,\nI saw the other Martians advancing with gigantic strides down\nthe riverbank from the direction of Chertsey.  The Shepperton\nguns spoke this time unavailingly.",
        "At that I ducked at once under water, and, holding my\nbreath until movement was an agony, blundered painfully\nahead under the surface as long as I could.  The water was in\na tumult about me, and rapidly growing hotter.",
        "When for a moment I raised my head to take breath and\nthrow the hair and water from my eyes, the steam was rising\nin a whirling white fog that at first hid the Martians alto-\ngether.  The noise was deafening.  Then I saw them dimly,\ncolossal figures of grey, magnified by the mist.  They had\npassed by me, and two were stooping over the frothing, tu-\nmultuous ruins of their comrade.",
        "The third and fourth stood beside him in the water, one\nperhaps two hundred yards from me, the other towards Lale-\nham.  The generators of the Heat-Rays waved high, and the\nhissing beams smote down this way and that.",
        "The air was full of sound, a deafening and confusing con-\nflict of noises--the clangorous din of the Martians, the crash\nof falling houses, the thud of trees, fences, sheds flashing into\nflame, and the crackling and roaring of fire.  Dense black\nsmoke was leaping up to mingle with the steam from the\nriver, and as the Heat-Ray went to and fro over Weybridge\nits impact was marked by flashes of incandescent white, that\ngave place at once to a smoky dance of lurid flames.  The\nnearer houses still stood intact, awaiting their fate, shadowy,\nfaint and pallid in the steam, with the fire behind them\ngoing to and fro.",
        "For a moment perhaps I stood there, breast-high in the\nalmost boiling water, dumbfounded at my position, hopeless\nof escape.  Through the reek I could see the people who had\nbeen with me in the river scrambling out of the water\nthrough the reeds, like little frogs hurrying through grass\nfrom the advance of a man, or running to and fro in utter\ndismay on the towing path.",
        "Then suddenly the white flashes of the Heat-Ray came\nleaping towards me.  The houses caved in as they dissolved at\nits touch, and darted out flames; the trees changed to fire with\na roar.  The Ray flickered up and down the towing path,\nlicking off the people who ran this way and that, and came\ndown to the water’s edge not fifty yards from where I stood.\nIt swept across the river to Shepperton, and the water in its\ntrack rose in a boiling weal crested with steam.  I turned\nshoreward.",
        "In another moment the huge wave, well-nigh at the boiling-\npoint had rushed upon me.  I screamed aloud, and scalded,\nhalf blinded, agonised, I staggered through the leaping, hiss-\ning water towards the shore.  Had my foot stumbled, it would\nhave been the end.  I fell helplessly, in full sight of the Mar-\ntians, upon the broad, bare gravelly spit that runs down to\nmark the angle of the Wey and Thames.  I expected nothing\nbut death.",
        "I have a dim memory of the foot of a Martian coming\ndown within a score of yards of my head, driving straight\ninto the loose gravel, whirling it this way and that and\nlifting again; of a long suspense, and then of the four carry-\ning the debris of their comrade between them, now clear\nand then presently faint through a veil of smoke, receding\ninterminably, as it seemed to me, across a vast space of river\nand meadow.  And then, very slowly, I realised that by a\nmiracle I had escaped.",
        "After getting this sudden lesson in the power of terres-\ntrial weapons, the Martians retreated to their original position\nupon Horsell Common; and in their haste, and encumbered\nwith the de’bris of their smashed companion, they no doubt\noverlooked many such a stray and negligible victim as myself.\nHad they left their comrade and pushed on forthwith, there\nwas nothing at that time between them and London but\nbatteries of twelve-pounder guns, and they would certainly\nhave reached the capital in advance of the tidings of their\napproach; as sudden, dreadful, and destructive their advent\nwould have been as the earthquake that destroyed Lisbon a\ncentury ago.",
        "But they were in no hurry.  Cylinder followed cylinder on\nits interplanetary flight; every twenty-four hours brought\nthem reinforcement.  And meanwhile the military and naval\nauthorities, now fully alive to the tremendous power of their\nantagonists, worked with furious energy.  Every minute a\nfresh gun came into position until, before twilight, every\ncopse, every row of suburban villas on the hilly slopes about\nKingston and Richmond, masked an expectant black muzzle.\nAnd through the charred and desolated area--perhaps twenty\nsquare miles altogether--that encircled the Martian encamp-\nment on Horsell Common, through charred and ruined villages\namong the green trees, through the blackened and smoking\narcades that had been but a day ago pine spinneys, crawled\nthe devoted scouts with the heliographs that were presently\nto warn the gunners of the Martian approach.  But the Mar-\ntians now understood our command of artillery and the\ndanger of human proximity, and not a man ventured within\na mile of either cylinder, save at the price of his life.",
        "It would seem that these giants spent the earlier part of\nthe afternoon in going to and fro, transferring everything\nfrom the second and third cylinders--the second in Addle-\nstone Golf Links and the third at Pyrford--to their original\npit on Horsell Common.  Over that, above the blackened\nheather and ruined buildings that stretched far and wide,\nstood one as sentinel, while the rest abandoned their vast\nfighting-machines and descended into the pit.  They were\nhard at work there far into the night, and the towering pillar\nof dense green smoke that rose therefrom could be seen from\nthe hills about Merrow, and even, it is said, from Banstead\nand Epsom Downs.",
        "And while the Martians behind me were thus preparing\nfor their next sally, and in front of me Humanity gathered\nfor the battle, I made my way with infinite pains and labour\nfrom the fire and smoke of burning Weybridge towards\nLondon.",
        "I saw an abandoned boat, very small and remote, drifting\ndown-stream; and throwing off the most of my sodden\nclothes, I went after it, gained it, and so escaped out of that\ndestruction.  There were no oars in the boat, but I contrived\nto paddle, as well as my parboiled hands would allow, down\nthe river towards Halliford and Walton, going very tediously\nand continually looking behind me, as you may well under-\nstand.  I followed the river, because I considered that the\nwater gave me my best chance of escape should these giants\nreturn.",
        "The hot water from the Martian’s overthrow drifted down-\nstream with me, so that for the best part of a mile I could see\nlittle of either bank.  Once, however, I made out a string of\nblack figures hurrying across the meadows from the direction\nof Weybridge.  Halliford, it seemed, was deserted, and sev-\neral of the houses facing the river were on fire.  It was strange\nto see the place quite tranquil, quite desolate under the hot\nblue sky, with the smoke and little threads of flame going\nstraight up into the heat of the afternoon.  Never before had\nI seen houses burning without the accompaniment of an\nobstructive crowd.  A little farther on the dry reeds up the\nbank were smoking and glowing, and a line of fire inland was\nmarching steadily across a late field of hay.",
        "For a long time I drifted, so painful and weary was I after\nthe violence I had been through, and so intense the heat upon\nthe water.  Then my fears got the better of me again, and I\nresumed my paddling.  The sun scorched my bare back.  At\nlast, as the bridge at Walton was coming into sight round the\nbend, my fever and faintness overcame my fears, and I landed\non the Middlesex bank and lay down, deadly sick, amid the\nlong grass.  I suppose the time was then about four or five\no’clock.  I got up presently, walked perhaps half a mile with-\nout meeting a soul, and then lay down again in the shadow of\na hedge.  I seem to remember talking, wanderingly, to myself\nduring that last spurt.  I was also very thirsty, and bitterly\nregretful I had drunk no more water.  It is a curious thing\nthat I felt angry with my wife; I cannot account for it,\nbut my impotent desire to reach Leatherhead worried me\nexcessively.",
        "I do not clearly remember the arrival of the curate, so that\nprobably I dozed.  I became aware of him as a seated figure\nin soot-smudged shirt sleeves, and with his upturned, clean-\nshaven face staring at a faint flickering that danced over the\nsky.  The sky was what is called a mackerel sky--rows and\nrows of faint down-plumes of cloud, just tinted with the\nmidsummer sunset.",
        "I sat up, and at the rustle of my motion he looked at me\nquickly.",
        "“Have you any water?” I asked abruptly.",
        "He shook his head.",
        "“You have been asking for water for the last hour,” he said.",
        "For a moment we were silent, taking stock of each other.  I\ndare say he found me a strange enough figure, naked, save\nfor my water-soaked trousers and socks, scalded, and my face\nand shoulders blackened by the smoke.  His face was a fair\nweakness, his chin retreated, and his hair lay in crisp, almost\nflaxen curls on his low forehead; his eyes were rather large,\npale blue, and blankly staring.  He spoke abruptly, looking\nvacantly away from me.",
        "“What does it mean?” he said.  “What do these things\nmean?”",
        "I stared at him and made no answer.",
        "He extended a thin white hand and spoke in almost a\ncomplaining tone.",
        "“Why are these things permitted?  What sins have we\ndone?  The morning service was over, I was walking through\nthe roads to clear my brain for the afternoon, and then--fire,\nearthquake, death!  As if it were Sodom and Gomorrah!  All\nour work undone, all the work---- What are these Mar-\ntians?”",
        "“What are we?” I answered, clearing my throat.",
        "He gripped his knees and turned to look at me again.  For\nhalf a minute, perhaps, he stared silently.",
        "“I was walking through the roads to clear my brain,” he\nsaid.  “And suddenly--fire, earthquake, death!”",
        "He relapsed into silence, with his chin now sunken almost\nto his knees.",
        "Presently he began waving his hand.",
        "“All the work--all the Sunday schools---- What have we\ndone--what has Weybridge done?  Everything gone--every-\nthing destroyed.  The church!  We rebuilt it only three years\nago.  Gone!  Swept out of existence!  Why?”",
        "Another pause, and he broke out again like one de-\nmented.",
        "“The smoke of her burning goeth up for ever and ever!\"\nhe shouted.",
        "His eyes flamed, and he pointed a lean finger in the direc-\ntion of Weybridge.",
        "By this time I was beginning to take his measure.  The\ntremendous tragedy in which he had been involved--it was\nevident he was a fugitive from Weybridge--had driven him\nto the very verge of his reason.",
        "“Are we far from Sunbury?” I said, in a matter-of-fact tone.",
        "“What are we to do?” he asked.  “Are these creatures every-\nwhere?  Has the earth been given over to them?”",
        "“Are we far from Sunbury?”",
        "“Only this morning I officiated at early celebration----”",
        "“Things have changed,” I said, quietly.  “You must keep\nyour head.  There is still hope.”",
        "“Hope!”",
        "“Yes.  Plentiful hope--for all this destruction!”",
        "I began to explain my view of our position.  He listened at\nfirst, but as I went on the interest dawning in his eyes gave\nplace to their former stare, and his regard wandered from\nme.",
        "“This must be the beginning of the end,” he said, inter-\nrupting me.  “The end!  The great and terrible day of the\nLord!  When men shall call upon the mountains and the rocks\nto fall upon them and hide them--hide them from the face\nof Him that sitteth upon the throne!”",
        "I began to understand the position.  I ceased my laboured\nreasoning, struggled to my feet, and, standing over him, laid\nmy hand on his shoulder.",
        "“Be a man!” said I.  “You are scared out of your wits!  What\ngood is religion if it collapses under calamity?  Think of what\nearthquakes and floods, wars and volcanoes, have done before\nto men!  Did you think God had exempted Weybridge?  He is\nnot an insurance agent.”",
        "For a time he sat in blank silence.",
        "“But how can we escape?” he asked, suddenly.  “They are\ninvulnerable, they are pitiless.”",
        "“Neither the one nor, perhaps, the other,” I answered.\n\"And the mightier they are the more sane and wary should\nwe be.  One of them was killed yonder not three hours ago.”",
        "“Killed!” he said, staring about him.  “How can God’s min-\nisters be killed?”",
        "“I saw it happen.” I proceeded to tell him.  “We have\nchanced to come in for the thick of it,” said I, “and that is\nall.”",
        "“What is that flicker in the sky?” he asked abruptly.",
        "I told him it was the heliograph signalling--that it was the\nsign of human help and effort in the sky.",
        "“We are in the midst of it,” I said, “quiet as it is.  That\nflicker in the sky tells of the gathering storm.  Yonder, I take\nit are the Martians, and Londonward, where those hills rise\nabout Richmond and Kingston and the trees give cover, earth-\nworks are being thrown up and guns are being placed.  Pres-\nently the Martians will be coming this way again.”",
        "And even as I spoke he sprang to his feet and stopped me\nby a gesture.",
        "“Listen!” he said.",
        "From beyond the low hills across the water came the dull\nresonance of distant guns and a remote weird crying.  Then\neverything was still.  A cockchafer came droning over the\nhedge and past us.  High in the west the crescent moon hung\nfaint and pale above the smoke of Weybridge and Shepper-\nton and the hot, still splendour of the sunset.",
        "“We had better follow this path,” I said, “northward.”",
        "My younger brother was in London when the Martians\nfell at Woking.  He was a medical student working for an\nimminent examination, and he heard nothing of the arrival\nuntil Saturday morning.  The morning papers on Saturday\ncontained, in addition to lengthy special articles on the planet\nMars, on life in the planets, and so forth, a brief and vaguely\nworded telegram, all the more striking for its brevity.",
        "The Martians, alarmed by the approach of a crowd, had\nkilled a number of people with a quick-firing gun, so the\nstory ran.  The telegram concluded with the words: “Formi-\ndable as they seem to be, the Martians have not moved from\nthe pit into which they have fallen, and, indeed, seem incapa-\nble of doing so.  Probably this is due to the relative strength\nof the earth’s gravitational energy.”  On that last text their\nleader-writer expanded very comfortingly.",
        "Of course all the students in the crammer’s biology class,\nto which my brother went that day, were intensely interested,\nbut there were no signs of any unusual excitement in the\nstreets.  The afternoon papers puffed scraps of news under big\nheadlines.  They had nothing to tell beyond the movements\nof troops about the common, and the burning of the pine\nwoods between Woking and Weybridge, until eight.  Then\nthe ST. JAMES’S GAZETTE, in an extra-special edition, announced\nthe bare fact of the interruption of telegraphic communica-\ntion.  This was thought to be due to the falling of burning pine\ntrees across the line.  Nothing more of the fighting was known\nthat night, the night of my drive to Leatherhead and\nback.",
        "My brother felt no anxiety about us, as he knew from the\ndescription in the papers that the cylinder was a good two\nmiles from my house.  He made up his mind to run down that\nnight to me, in order, as he says, to see the Things before\nthey were killed.  He despatched a telegram, which never\nreached me, about four o’clock, and spent the evening at a\nmusic hall.",
        "In London, also, on Saturday night there was a thunder-\nstorm, and my brother reached Waterloo in a cab.  On the\nplatform from which the midnight train usually starts he\nlearned, after some waiting, that an accident prevented trains\nfrom reaching Woking that night.  The nature of the accident\nhe could not ascertain; indeed, the railway authorities did not\nclearly know at that time.  There was very little excitement\nin the station, as the officials, failing to realise that\nanything further than a breakdown between Byfleet and Woking\njunction had occurred, were running the theatre trains which\nusually passed through Woking round by Virginia Water or\nGuildford.  They were busy making the necessary arrange-\nments to alter the route of the Southampton and Portsmouth\nSunday League excursions.  A nocturnal newspaper reporter,\nmistaking my brother for the traffic manager, to whom he\nbears a slight resemblance, waylaid and tried to interview\nhim.  Few people, excepting the railway officials, connected\nthe breakdown with the Martians.",
        "I have read, in another account of these events, that on\nSunday morning “all London was electrified by the news\nfrom Woking.”  As a matter of fact, there was nothing to\njustify that very extravagant phrase.  Plenty of Londoners\ndid not hear of the Martians until the panic of Monday morn-\ning.  Those who did took some time to realise all that the\nhastily worded telegrams in the Sunday papers conveyed.\nThe majority of people in London do not read Sunday\npapers.",
        "The habit of personal security, moreover, is so deeply fixed\nin the Londoner’s mind, and startling intelligence so much a\nmatter of course in the papers, that they could read without\nany personal tremors: “About seven o’clock last night the\nMartians came out of the cylinder, and, moving about under\nan armour of metallic shields, have completely wrecked\nWoking station with the adjacent houses, and massacred an\nentire battalion of the Cardigan Regiment.  No details are\nknown.  Maxims have been absolutely useless against their\narmour; the field guns have been disabled by them.  Flying\nhussars have been galloping into Chertsey.  The Martians\nappear to be moving slowly towards Chertsey or Windsor.\nGreat anxiety prevails in West Surrey, and earthworks are\nbeing thrown up to check the advance Londonward.”  That\nwas how the Sunday SUN put it, and a clever and remarkably\nprompt “handbook” article in the REFEREE compared the affair\nto a menagerie suddenly let loose in a village.",
        "No one in London knew positively of the nature of the\narmoured Martians, and there was still a fixed idea that these\nmonsters must be sluggish: “crawling,” “creeping painfully\"\n--such expressions occurred in almost all the earlier reports.\nNone of the telegrams could have been written by an eye-\nwitness of their advance.  The Sunday papers printed separate\neditions as further news came to hand, some even in default\nof it.  But there was practically nothing more to tell people\nuntil late in the afternoon, when the authorities gave the\npress agencies the news in their possession.  It was stated that\nthe people of Walton and Weybridge, and all the district\nwere pouring along the roads Londonward, and that was all.",
        "My brother went to church at the Foundling Hospital in\nthe morning, still in ignorance of what had happened on the\nprevious night.  There he heard allusions made to the invasion,\nand a special prayer for peace.  Coming out, he bought a\nREFEREE.  He became alarmed at the news in this, and went\nagain to Waterloo station to find out if communication were\nrestored.  The omnibuses, carriages, cyclists, and innumerable\npeople walking in their best clothes seemed scarcely affected\nby the strange intelligence that the news venders were dis-\nseminating.  People were interested, or, if alarmed, alarmed\nonly on account of the local residents.  At the station he heard\nfor the first time that the Windsor and Chertsey lines were\nnow interrupted.  The porters told him that several remark-\nable telegrams had been received in the morning from Byfleet\nand Chertsey stations, but that these had abruptly ceased.  My\nbrother could get very little precise detail out of them.",
        "“There’s fighting going on about Weybridge” was the\nextent of their information.",
        "The train service was now very much disorganised.  Quite\na number of people who had been expecting friends from\nplaces on the South-Western network were standing about\nthe station.  One grey-headed old gentleman came and abused\nthe South-Western Company bitterly to my brother.  “It wants\nshowing up,” he said.",
        "One or two trains came in from Richmond, Putney, and\nKingston, containing people who had gone out for a day’s\nboating and found the locks closed and a feeling of panic in\nthe air.  A man in a blue and white blazer addressed my\nbrother, full of strange tidings.",
        "“There’s hosts of people driving into Kingston in traps and\ncarts and things, with boxes of valuables and all that,” he\nsaid.  “They come from Molesey and Weybridge and Walton,\nand they say there’s been guns heard at Chertsey, heavy\nfiring, and that mounted soldiers have told them to get off at\nonce because the Martians are coming.  We heard guns firing\nat Hampton Court station, but we thought it was thunder.\nWhat the dickens does it all mean?  The Martians can’t get\nout of their pit, can they?”",
        "My brother could not tell him.",
        "Afterwards he found that the vague feeling of alarm had\nspread to the clients of the underground railway, and that\nthe Sunday excursionists began to return from all over the\nSouth-Western “lung\"--Barnes, Wimbledon, Richmond Park,\nKew, and so forth--at unnaturally early hours; but not a\nsoul had anything more than vague hearsay to tell of.  Every-\none connected with the terminus seemed ill-tempered.",
        "About five o’clock the gathering crowd in the station was\nimmensely excited by the opening of the line of communica-\ntion, which is almost invariably closed, between the South-\nEastern and the South-Western stations, and the passage of\ncarriage trucks bearing huge guns and carriages crammed\nwith soldiers.  These were the guns that were brought up\nfrom Woolwich and Chatham to cover Kingston.  There was\nan exchange of pleasantries: “You’ll get eaten!”  “We’re the\nbeast-tamers!” and so forth.  A little while after that a squad\nof police came into the station and began to clear the public off\nthe platforms, and my brother went out into the street again.",
        "The church bells were ringing for evensong, and a squad of\nSalvation Army lassies came singing down Waterloo Road.\nOn the bridge a number of loafers were watching a curious\nbrown scum that came drifting down the stream in patches.\nThe sun was just setting, and the Clock Tower and the Houses\nof Parliament rose against one of the most peaceful skies it\nis possible to imagine, a sky of gold, barred with long trans-\nverse stripes of reddish-purple cloud.  There was talk of a\nfloating body.  One of the men there, a reservist he said he\nwas, told my brother he had seen the heliograph flickering\nin the west.",
        "In Wellington Street my brother met a couple of sturdy\nroughs who had just been rushed out of Fleet Street with still-\nwet newspapers and staring placards.  “Dreadful catastrophe!\"\nthey bawled one to the other down Wellington Street.  “Fight\ning at Weybridge!  Full description!  Repulse of the Martians!\nLondon in Danger!”  He had to give threepence for a copy of\nthat paper.",
        "Then it was, and then only, that he realised something of\nthe full power and terror of these monsters.  He learned that\nthey were not merely a handful of small sluggish creatures,\nbut that they were minds swaying vast mechanical bodies;\nand that they could move swiftly and smite with such power\nthat even the mightiest guns could not stand against them.",
        "They were described as “vast spiderlike machines, nearly\na hundred feet high, capable of the speed of an express train,\nand able to shoot out a beam of intense heat.”  Masked batter-\nies, chiefly of field guns, had been planted in the country\nabout Horsell Common, and especially between the Woking\ndistrict and London.  Five of the machines had been seen\nmoving towards the Thames, and one, by a happy chance,\nhad been destroyed.  In the other cases the shells had missed,\nand the batteries had been at once annihilated by the Heat-\nRays.  Heavy losses of soldiers were mentioned, but the tone\nof the despatch was optimistic.",
        "The Martians had been repulsed; they were not invulnera-\nble.  They had retreated to their triangle of cylinders again, in\nthe circle about Woking.  Signallers with heliographs were\npushing forward upon them from all sides.  Guns were in rapid\ntransit from Windsor, Portsmouth, Aldershot, Woolwich--\neven from the north; among others, long wire-guns of ninety-\nfive tons from Woolwich.  Altogether one hundred and sixteen\nwere in position or being hastily placed, chiefly covering Lon-\ndon.  Never before in England had there been such a vast or\nrapid concentration of military material.",
        "Any further cylinders that fell, it was hoped, could be\ndestroyed at once by high explosives, which were being rap-\nidly manufactured and distributed.  No doubt, ran the report,\nthe situation was of the strangest and gravest description, but\nthe public was exhorted to avoid and discourage panic.  No\ndoubt the Martians were strange and terrible in the extreme,\nbut at the outside there could not be more than twenty of\nthem against our millions.",
        "The authorities had reason to suppose, from the size of the\ncylinders, that at the outside there could not be more than\nfive in each cylinder--fifteen altogether.  And one at least was\ndisposed of--perhaps more.  The public would be fairly\nwarned of the approach of danger, and elaborate measures\nwere being taken for the protection of the people in the\nthreatened southwestern suburbs.  And so, with reiterated\nassurances of the safety of London and the ability of the\nauthorities to cope with the difficulty, this quasi-proclamation\nclosed.",
        "This was printed in enormous type on paper so fresh that it\nwas still wet, and there had been no time to add a word of\ncomment.  It was curious, my brother said, to see how ruth-\nlessly the usual contents of the paper had been hacked and\ntaken out to give this place.",
        "All down Wellington Street people could be seen fluttering\nout the pink sheets and reading, and the Strand was suddenly\nnoisy with the voices of an army of hawkers following these\npioneers.  Men came scrambling off buses to secure copies.\nCertainly this news excited people intensely, whatever\ntheir previous apathy.  The shutters of a map shop in the\nStrand were being taken down, my brother said, and a man\nin his Sunday raiment, lemon-yellow gloves even, was visi-\nble inside the window hastily fastening maps of Surrey to\nthe glass.",
        "Going on along the Strand to Trafalgar Square, the paper\nin his hand, my brother saw some of the fugitives from West\nSurrey.  There was a man with his wife and two boys and\nsome articles of furniture in a cart such as greengrocers use.\nHe was driving from the direction of Westminster Bridge;\nand close behind him came a hay waggon with five or six\nrespectable-looking people in it, and some boxes and bundles.\nThe faces of these people were haggard, and their entire\nappearance contrasted conspicuously with the Sabbath-best\nappearance of the people on the omnibuses.  People in fash-\nionable clothing peeped at them out of cabs.  They stopped at\nthe Square as if undecided which way to take, and finally\nturned eastward along the Strand.  Some way behind these\ncame a man in workday clothes, riding one of those old-\nfashioned tricycles with a small front wheel.  He was dirty and\nwhite in the face.",
        "My brother turned down towards Victoria, and met a num-\nber of such people.  He had a vague idea that he might see\nsomething of me.  He noticed an unusual number of police\nregulating the traffic.  Some of the refugees were exchanging\nnews with the people on the omnibuses.  One was professing\nto have seen the Martians.  “Boilers on stilts, I tell you,\nstriding along like men.”  Most of them were excited and\nanimated by their strange experience.",
        "Beyond Victoria the public-houses were doing a lively trade\nwith these arrivals.  At all the street corners groups of people\nwere reading papers, talking excitedly, or staring at these\nunusual Sunday visitors.  They seemed to increase as night\ndrew on, until at last the roads, my brother said, were like\nEpsom High Street on a Derby Day.  My brother addressed\nseveral of these fugitives and got unsatisfactory answers from\nmost.",
        "None of them could tell him any news of Woking except\none man, who assured him that Woking had been entirely\ndestroyed on the previous night.",
        "“I come from Byfleet,” he said; “man on a bicycle came\nthrough the place in the early morning, and ran from door to\ndoor warning us to come away.  Then came soldiers.  We went\nout to look, and there were clouds of smoke to the south--\nnothing but smoke, and not a soul coming that way.  Then\nwe heard the guns at Chertsey, and folks coming from Wey-\nbridge.  So I’ve locked up my house and come on.”",
        "At the time there was a strong feeling in the streets that the\nauthorities were to blame for their incapacity to dispose of\nthe invaders without all this inconvenience.",
        "About eight o’clock a noise of heavy firing was distinctly\naudible all over the south of London.  My brother could not\nhear it for the traffic in the main thoroughfares, but by strik-\ning through the quiet back streets to the river he was able to\ndistinguish it quite plainly.",
        "He walked from Westminster to his apartments near Re-\ngent’s Park, about two.  He was now very anxious on my\naccount, and disturbed at the evident magnitude of the\ntrouble.  His mind was inclined to run, even as mine had run\non Saturday, on military details.  He thought of all those\nsilent, expectant guns, of the suddenly nomadic countryside;\nhe tried to imagine “boilers on stilts” a hundred feet high.",
        "There were one or two cartloads of refugees passing along\nOxford Street, and several in the Marylebone Road, but so\nslowly was the news spreading that Regent Street and Port-\nland Place were full of their usual Sunday-night promenaders,\nalbeit they talked in groups, and along the edge of Regent’s\nPark there were as many silent couples “walking out” together\nunder the scattered gas lamps as ever there had been.  The\nnight was warm and still, and a little oppressive; the sound\nof guns continued intermittently, and after midnight there\nseemed to be sheet lightning in the south.",
        "He read and re-read the paper, fearing the worst had hap-\npened to me.  He was restless, and after supper prowled out\nagain aimlessly.  He returned and tried in vain to divert his\nattention to his examination notes.  He went to bed a little\nafter midnight, and was awakened from lurid dreams in the\nsmall hours of Monday by the sound of door knockers, feet\nrunning in the street, distant drumming, and a clamour\nof bells.  Red reflections danced on the ceiling.  For a moment\nhe lay astonished, wondering whether day had come or the\nworld gone mad.  Then he jumped out of bed and ran to the\nwindow.",
        "His room was an attic and as he thrust his head out, up\nand down the street there were a dozen echoes to the noise\nof his window sash, and heads in every kind of night disarray\nappeared.  Enquiries were being shouted.  “They are coming!\"\nbawled a policeman, hammering at the door; “the Martians\nare coming!” and hurried to the next door.",
        "The sound of drumming and trumpeting came from the\nAlbany Street Barracks, and every church within earshot was\nhard at work killing sleep with a vehement disorderly tocsin.\nThere was a noise of doors opening, and window after win-\ndow in the houses opposite flashed from darkness into yellow\nillumination.",
        "Up the street came galloping a closed carriage, bursting\nabruptly into noise at the corner, rising to a clattering climax\nunder the window, and dying away slowly in the distance.\nClose on the rear of this came a couple of cabs, the forerun-\nners of a long procession of flying vehicles, going for the most\npart to Chalk Farm station, where the North-Western special\ntrains were loading up, instead of coming down the gradient\ninto Euston.",
        "For a long time my brother stared out of the window in\nblank astonishment, watching the policemen hammering at\ndoor after door, and delivering their incomprehensible mes-\nsage.  Then the door behind him opened, and the man who\nlodged across the landing came in, dressed only in shirt,\ntrousers, and slippers, his braces loose about his waist, his\nhair disordered from his pillow.",
        "“What the devil is it?” he asked.  “A fire?  What a devil of a\nrow!”",
        "They both craned their heads out of the window, straining\nto hear what the policemen were shouting.  People were com-\ning out of the side streets, and standing in groups at the\ncorners talking.",
        "“What the devil is it all about?” said my brother’s fellow\nlodger.",
        "My brother answered him vaguely and began to dress,\nrunning with each garment to the window in order to miss\nnothing of the growing excitement.  And presently men selling\nunnaturally early newspapers came bawling into the street:",
        "“London in danger of suffocation!  The Kingston and Rich-\nmond defences forced!  Fearful massacres in the Thames\nValley!”",
        "And all about him--in the rooms below, in the houses on\neach side and across the road, and behind in the Park Ter-\nraces and in the hundred other streets of that part of Maryle-\nbone, and the Westbourne Park district and St. Pancras, and\nwestward and northward in Kilburn and St. John’s Wood and\nHampstead, and eastward in Shoreditch and Highbury and\nHaggerston and Hoxton, and, indeed, through all the vastness\nof London from Ealing to East Ham--people were rubbing\ntheir eyes, and opening windows to stare out and ask aimless\nquestions, dressing hastily as the first breath of the coming\nstorm of Fear blew through the streets.  It was the dawn of\nthe great panic.  London, which had gone to bed on Sunday\nnight oblivious and inert, was awakened, in the small hours\nof Monday morning, to a vivid sense of danger.",
        "Unable from his window to learn what was happening, my\nbrother went down and out into the street, just as the sky\nbetween the parapets of the houses grew pink with the early\ndawn.  The flying people on foot and in vehicles grew more\nnumerous every moment.  “Black Smoke!” he heard people\ncrying, and again “Black Smoke!”  The contagion of such a\nunanimous fear was inevitable.  As my brother hesitated on\nthe door-step, he saw another news vender approaching, and\ngot a paper forthwith.  The man was running away with the\nrest, and selling his papers for a shilling each as he ran--a\ngrotesque mingling of profit and panic.",
        "And from this paper my brother read that catastrophic\ndespatch of the Commander-in-Chief:",
        "“The Martians are able to discharge enormous clouds of a\nblack and poisonous vapour by means of rockets.  They have\nsmothered our batteries, destroyed Richmond, Kingston, and\nWimbledon, and are advancing slowly towards London, de-\nstroying everything on the way.  It is impossible to stop them.\nThere is no safety from the Black Smoke but in instant flight.”",
        "That was all, but it was enough.  The whole population of\nthe great six-million city was stirring, slipping, running; pres-\nently it would be pouring EN MASSE northward.",
        "“Black Smoke!” the voices cried.  “Fire!”",
        "The bells of the neighbouring church made a jangling\ntumult, a cart carelessly driven smashed, amid shrieks and\ncurses, against the water trough up the street.  Sickly yellow\nlights went to and fro in the houses, and some of the passing\ncabs flaunted unextinguished lamps.  And overhead the dawn\nwas growing brighter, clear and steady and calm.",
        "He heard footsteps running to and fro in the rooms, and\nup and down stairs behind him.  His landlady came to the\ndoor, loosely wrapped in dressing gown and shawl; her hus-\nband followed ejaculating.",
        "As my brother began to realise the import of all these\nthings, he turned hastily to his own room, put all his available\nmoney--some ten pounds altogether--into his pockets, and\nwent out again into the streets.",
        "It was while the curate had sat and talked so wildly to\nme under the hedge in the flat meadows near Halliford, and\nwhile my brother was watching the fugitives stream over\nWestminster Bridge, that the Martians had resumed the of-\nfensive.  So far as one can ascertain from the conflicting\naccounts that have been put forth, the majority of them\nremained busied with preparations in the Horsell pit until\nnine that night, hurrying on some operation that disengaged\nhuge volumes of green smoke.",
        "But three certainly came out about eight o’clock and,\nadvancing slowly and cautiously, made their way through\nByfleet and Pyrford towards Ripley and Weybridge, and so\ncame in sight of the expectant batteries against the setting\nsun.  These Martians did not advance in a body, but in a line,\neach perhaps a mile and a half from his nearest fellow.  They\ncommunicated with one another by means of sirenlike howls,\nrunning up and down the scale from one note to another.",
        "It was this howling and firing of the guns at Ripley and\nSt. George’s Hill that we had heard at Upper Halliford.  The\nRipley gunners, unseasoned artillery volunteers who ought\nnever to have been placed in such a position, fired one wild,\npremature, ineffectual volley, and bolted on horse and foot\nthrough the deserted village, while the Martian, without using\nhis Heat-Ray, walked serenely over their guns, stepped gin-\ngerly among them, passed in front of them, and so came\nunexpectedly upon the guns in Painshill Park, which he\ndestroyed.",
        "The St. George’s Hill men, however, were better led or of\na better mettle.  Hidden by a pine wood as they were, they\nseem to have been quite unsuspected by the Martian nearest\nto them.  They laid their guns as deliberately as if they had\nbeen on parade, and fired at about a thousand yards’ range.",
        "The shells flashed all round him, and he was seen to\nadvance a few paces, stagger, and go down.  Everybody yelled\ntogether, and the guns were reloaded in frantic haste.  The\noverthrown Martian set up a prolonged ululation, and imme-\ndiately a second glittering giant, answering him, appeared\nover the trees to the south.  It would seem that a leg of the\ntripod had been smashed by one of the shells.  The whole of\nthe second volley flew wide of the Martian on the ground,\nand, simultaneously, both his companions brought their Heat-\nRays to bear on the battery.  The ammunition blew up, the\npine trees all about the guns flashed into fire, and only one or\ntwo of the men who were already running over the crest of\nthe hill escaped.",
        "After this it would seem that the three took counsel to-\ngether and halted, and the scouts who were watching them\nreport that they remained absolutely stationary for the next\nhalf hour.  The Martian who had been overthrown crawled\ntediously out of his hood, a small brown figure, oddly sugges-\ntive from that distance of a speck of blight, and apparently\nengaged in the repair of his support.  About nine he had\nfinished, for his cowl was then seen above the trees again.",
        "It was a few minutes past nine that night when these three\nsentinels were joined by four other Martians, each carrying\na thick black tube.  A similar tube was handed to each of the\nthree, and the seven proceeded to distribute themselves at\nequal distances along a curved line between St. George’s Hill,\nWeybridge, and the village of Send, southwest of Ripley.",
        "A dozen rockets sprang out of the hills before them so soon\nas they began to move, and warned the waiting batteries\nabout Ditton and Esher.  At the same time four of their\nfighting machines, similarly armed with tubes, crossed the\nriver, and two of them, black against the western sky, came\ninto sight of myself and the curate as we hurried wearily and\npainfully along the road that runs northward out of Halliford.\nThey moved, as it seemed to us, upon a cloud, for a milky\nmist covered the fields and rose to a third of their height.",
        "At this sight the curate cried faintly in his throat, and\nbegan running; but I knew it was no good running from a\nMartian, and I turned aside and crawled through dewy nettles\nand brambles into the broad ditch by the side of the road.\nHe looked back, saw what I was doing, and turned to join\nme.",
        "The two halted, the nearer to us standing and facing Sun-\nbury, the remoter being a grey indistinctness towards the\nevening star, away towards Staines.",
        "The occasional howling of the Martians had ceased; they\ntook up their positions in the huge crescent about their\ncylinders in absolute silence.  It was a crescent with twelve\nmiles between its horns.  Never since the devising of gun-\npowder was the beginning of a battle so still.  To us and to\nan observer about Ripley it would have had precisely the\nsame effect--the Martians seemed in solitary possession of\nthe darkling night, lit only as it was by the slender moon, the\nstars, the afterglow of the daylight, and the ruddy glare from\nSt. George’s Hill and the woods of Painshill.",
        "But facing that crescent everywhere--at Staines, Hounslow,\nDitton, Esher, Ockham, behind hills and woods south of the\nriver, and across the flat grass meadows to the north of it,\nwherever a cluster of trees or village houses gave sufficient\ncover--the guns were waiting.  The signal rockets burst and\nrained their sparks through the night and vanished, and the\nspirit of all those watching batteries rose to a tense expecta-\ntion.  The Martians had but to advance into the line of fire,\nand instantly those motionless black forms of men, those\nguns glittering so darkly in the early night, would explode\ninto a thunderous fury of battle.",
        "No doubt the thought that was uppermost in a thousand\nof those vigilant minds, even as it was uppermost in mine,\nwas the riddle--how much they understood of us.  Did they\ngrasp that we in our millions were organized, disciplined,\nworking together?  Or did they interpret our spurts of fire,\nthe sudden stinging of our shells, our steady investment of\ntheir encampment, as we should the furious unanimity of\nonslaught in a disturbed hive of bees?  Did they dream they\nmight exterminate us?  (At that time no one knew what food\nthey needed.)  A hundred such questions struggled together\nin my mind as I watched that vast sentinel shape.  And in\nthe back of my mind was the sense of all the huge unknown\nand hidden forces Londonward.  Had they prepared pitfalls?\nWere the powder mills at Hounslow ready as a snare?  Would\nthe Londoners have the heart and courage to make a greater\nMoscow of their mighty province of houses?",
        "Then, after an interminable time, as it seemed to us,\ncrouching and peering through the hedge, came a sound\nlike the distant concussion of a gun.  Another nearer, and\nthen another.  And then the Martian beside us raised his tube\non high and discharged it, gunwise, with a heavy report that\nmade the ground heave.  The one towards Staines answered\nhim.  There was no flash, no smoke, simply that loaded\ndetonation.",
        "I was so excited by these heavy minute-guns following one\nanother that I so far forgot my personal safety and my\nscalded hands as to clamber up into the hedge and stare\ntowards Sunbury.  As I did so a second report followed, and\na big projectile hurtled overhead towards Hounslow.  I ex-\npected at least to see smoke or fire, or some such evidence\nof its work.  But all I saw was the deep blue sky above, with\none solitary star, and the white mist spreading wide and low\nbeneath.  And there had been no crash, no answering ex-\nplosion.  The silence was restored; the minute lengthened to\nthree.",
        "“What has happened?” said the curate, standing up beside\nme.",
        "“Heaven knows!” said I.",
        "A bat flickered by and vanished.  A distant tumult of\nshouting began and ceased.  I looked again at the Martian,\nand saw he was now moving eastward along the riverbank,\nwith a swift, rolling motion,",
        "Every moment I expected the fire of some hidden battery\nto spring upon him; but the evening calm was unbroken.\nThe figure of the Martian grew smaller as he receded, and\npresently the mist and the gathering night had swallowed\nhim up.  By a common impulse we clambered higher.  Towards\nSunbury was a dark appearance, as though a conical hill\nhad suddenly come into being there, hiding our view of the\nfarther country; and then, remoter across the river, over\nWalton, we saw another such summit.  These hill-like forms\ngrew lower and broader even as we stared.",
        "Moved by a sudden thought, I looked northward, and\nthere I perceived a third of these cloudy black kopjes had\nrisen.",
        "Everything had suddenly become very still.  Far away to\nthe southeast, marking the quiet, we heard the Martians\nhooting to one another, and then the air quivered again with\nthe distant thud of their guns.  But the earthly artillery made\nno reply.",
        "Now at the time we could not understand these things, but\nlater I was to learn the meaning of these ominous kopjes that\ngathered in the twilight.  Each of the Martians, standing in\nthe great crescent I have described, had discharged, by\nmeans of the gunlike tube he carried, a huge canister over\nwhatever hill, copse, cluster of houses, or other possible cover\nfor guns, chanced to be in front of him.  Some fired only one\nof these, some two--as in the case of the one we had seen;\nthe one at Ripley is said to have discharged no fewer than\nfive at that time.  These canisters smashed on striking the\nground--they did not explode--and incontinently disengaged\nan enormous volume of heavy, inky vapour, coiling and pour-\ning upward in a huge and ebony cumulus cloud, a gaseous\nhill that sank and spread itself slowly over the surrounding\ncountry.  And the touch of that vapour, the inhaling of its\npungent wisps, was death to all that breathes.",
        "It was heavy, this vapour, heavier than the densest smoke,\nso that, after the first tumultuous uprush and outflow of its\nimpact, it sank down through the air and poured over the\nground in a manner rather liquid than gaseous, abandoning\nthe hills, and streaming into the valleys and ditches and\nwatercourses even as I have heard the carbonic-acid gas that\npours from volcanic clefts is wont to do.  And where it came\nupon water some chemical action occurred, and the surface\nwould be instantly covered with a powdery scum that sank\nslowly and made way for more.  The scum was absolutely\ninsoluble, and it is a strange thing, seeing the instant effect\nof the gas, that one could drink without hurt the water from\nwhich it had been strained.  The vapour did not diffuse as a\ntrue gas would do.  It hung together in banks, flowing slug-\ngishly down the slope of the land and driving reluctantly\nbefore the wind, and very slowly it combined with the mist\nand moisture of the air, and sank to the earth in the form\nof dust.  Save that an unknown element giving a group of\nfour lines in the blue of the spectrum is concerned, we are\nstill entirely ignorant of the nature of this substance.",
        "Once the tumultuous upheaval of its dispersion was over,\nthe black smoke clung so closely to the ground, even before\nits precipitation, that fifty feet up in the air, on the roofs\nand upper stories of high houses and on great trees, there was\na chance of escaping its poison altogether, as was proved even\nthat night at Street Cobham and Ditton.",
        "The man who escaped at the former place tells a wonderful\nstory of the strangeness of its coiling flow, and how he looked\ndown from the church spire and saw the houses of the village\nrising like ghosts out of its inky nothingness.  For a day and\na half he remained there, weary, starving and sun-scorched,\nthe earth under the blue sky and against the prospect of the\ndistant hills a velvet-black expanse, with red roofs, green\ntrees, and, later, black-veiled shrubs and gates, barns, out-\nhouses, and walls, rising here and there into the sunlight.",
        "But that was at Street Cobham, where the black vapour\nwas allowed to remain until it sank of its own accord into\nthe ground.  As a rule the Martians, when it had served its\npurpose, cleared the air of it again by wading into it and\ndirecting a jet of steam upon it.",
        "This they did with the vapour banks near us, as we saw\nin the starlight from the window of a deserted house at Upper\nHalliford, whither we had returned.  From there we could\nsee the searchlights on Richmond Hill and Kingston Hill\ngoing to and fro, and about eleven the windows rattled, and\nwe heard the sound of the huge siege guns that had been put\nin position there.  These continued intermittently for the space\nof a quarter of an hour, sending chance shots at the invisible\nMartians at Hampton and Ditton, and then the pale beams\nof the electric light vanished, and were replaced by a bright\nred glow.",
        "Then the fourth cylinder fell--a brilliant green meteor--as\nI learned afterwards, in Bushey Park.  Before the guns on the\nRichmond and Kingston line of hills began, there was a fitful\ncannonade far away in the southwest, due, I believe, to guns\nbeing fired haphazard before the black vapour could over-\nwhelm the gunners.",
        "So, setting about it as methodically as men might smoke\nout a wasps’ nest, the Martians spread this strange stifling\nvapour over the Londonward country.  The horns of the\ncrescent slowly moved apart, until at last they formed a line\nfrom Hanwell to Coombe and Malden.  All night through their\ndestructive tubes advanced.  Never once, after the Martian\nat St. George’s Hill was brought down, did they give the\nartillery the ghost of a chance against them.  Wherever there\nwas a possibility of guns being laid for them unseen, a fresh\ncanister of the black vapour was discharged, and where the\nguns were openly displayed the Heat-Ray was brought to\nbear.",
        "By midnight the blazing trees along the slopes of Rich-\nmond Park and the glare of Kingston Hill threw their light\nupon a network of black smoke, blotting out the whole valley\nof the Thames and extending as far as the eye could reach.\nAnd through this two Martians slowly waded, and turned\ntheir hissing steam jets this way and that.",
        "They were sparing of the Heat-Ray that night, either be-\ncause they had but a limited supply of material for its\nproduction or because they did not wish to destroy the\ncountry but only to crush and overawe the opposition they\nhad aroused.  In the latter aim they certainly succeeded.  Sun-\nday night was the end of the organised opposition to their\nmovements.  After that no body of men would stand against\nthem, so hopeless was the enterprise.  Even the crews of the\ntorpedo-boats and destroyers that had brought their quick-\nfirers up the Thames refused to stop, mutinied, and went\ndown again.  The only offensive operation men ventured upon\nafter that night was the preparation of mines and pitfalls,\nand even in that their energies were frantic and spasmodic.",
        "One has to imagine, as well as one may, the fate of those\nbatteries towards Esher, waiting so tensely in the twilight.\nSurvivors there were none.  One may picture the orderly\nexpectation, the officers alert and watchful, the gunners ready,\nthe ammunition piled to hand, the limber gunners with their\nhorses and waggons, the groups of civilian spectators standing\nas near as they were permitted, the evening stillness, the\nambulances and hospital tents with the burned and wounded\nfrom Weybridge; then the dull resonance of the shots the\nMartians fired, and the clumsy projectile whirling over the\ntrees and houses and smashing amid the neighbouring fields.",
        "One may picture, too, the sudden shifting of the attention,\nthe swiftly spreading coils and bellyings of that blackness\nadvancing headlong, towering heavenward, turning the twi-\nlight to a palpable darkness, a strange and horrible antagonist\nof vapour striding upon its victims, men and horses near it\nseen dimly, running, shrieking, falling headlong, shouts of\ndismay, the guns suddenly abandoned, men choking and\nwrithing on the ground, and the swift broadening-out of the\nopaque cone of smoke.  And then night and extinction--\nnothing but a silent mass of impenetrable vapour hiding its\ndead.",
        "Before dawn the black vapour was pouring through the\nstreets of Richmond, and the disintegrating organism of\ngovernment was, with a last expiring effort, rousing the\npopulation of London to the necessity of flight.",
        "\n   So you understand the roaring wave of fear that swept\nthrough the greatest city in the world just as Monday was\ndawning--the stream of flight rising swiftly to a torrent, lash-\ning in a foaming tumult round the railway stations, banked\nup into a horrible struggle about the shipping in the Thames,\nand hurrying by every available channel northward and east-\nward.  By ten o’clock the police organisation, and by midday\neven the railway organisations, were losing coherency, losing\nshape and efficiency, guttering, softening, running at last in\nthat swift liquefaction of the social body.",
        "All the railway lines north of the Thames and the South-\nEastern people at Cannon Street had been warned by mid-\nnight on Sunday, and trains were being filled.  People were\nfighting savagely for standing-room in the carriages even at\ntwo o’clock.  By three, people were being trampled and\ncrushed even in Bishopsgate Street, a couple of hundred\nyards or more from Liverpool Street station; revolvers were\nfired, people stabbed, and the policemen who had been sent\nto direct the traffic, exhausted and infuriated, were breaking\nthe heads of the people they were called out to protect.",
        "And as the day advanced and the engine drivers and\nstokers refused to return to London, the pressure of the flight\ndrove the people in an ever-thickening multitude away from\nthe stations and along the northward-running roads.  By mid-\nday a Martian had been seen at Barnes, and a cloud of slowly\nsinking black vapour drove along the Thames and across the\nflats of Lambeth, cutting off all escape over the bridges in its\nsluggish advance.  Another bank drove over Ealing, and sur-\nrounded a little island of survivors on Castle Hill, alive, but\nunable to escape.",
        "After a fruitless struggle to get aboard a North-Western\ntrain at Chalk Farm--the engines of the trains that had loaded\nin the goods yard there PLOUGHED through shrieking people,\nand a dozen stalwart men fought to keep the crowd from\ncrushing the driver against his furnace--my brother emerged\nupon the Chalk Farm road, dodged across through a hurrying\nswarm of vehicles, and had the luck to be foremost in the\nsack of a cycle shop.  The front tire of the machine he got\nwas punctured in dragging it through the window, but he got\nup and off, notwithstanding, with no further injury than a\ncut wrist.  The steep foot of Haverstock Hill was impassable\nowing to several overturned horses, and my brother struck\ninto Belsize Road.",
        "So he got out of the fury of the panic, and, skirting the\nEdgware Road, reached Edgware about seven, fasting and\nwearied, but well ahead of the crowd.  Along the road people\nwere standing in the roadway, curious, wondering.  He was\npassed by a number of cyclists, some horsemen, and two\nmotor cars.  A mile from Edgware the rim of the wheel broke,\nand the machine became unridable.  He left it by the roadside\nand trudged through the village.  There were shops half\nopened in the main street of the place, and people crowded\non the pavement and in the doorways and windows, staring\nastonished at this extraordinary procession of fugitives that\nwas beginning.  He succeeded in getting some food at an\ninn.",
        "For a time he remained in Edgware not knowing what next\nto do.  The flying people increased in number.  Many of them,\nlike my brother, seemed inclined to loiter in the place.  There\nwas no fresh news of the invaders from Mars.",
        "At that time the road was crowded, but as yet far from\ncongested.  Most of the fugitives at that hour were mounted\non cycles, but there were soon motor cars, hansom cabs, and\ncarriages hurrying along, and the dust hung in heavy clouds\nalong the road to St. Albans.",
        "It was perhaps a vague idea of making his way to Chelms-\nford, where some friends of his lived, that at last induced my\nbrother to strike into a quiet lane running eastward.  Presently\nhe came upon a stile, and, crossing it, followed a footpath\nnortheastward.  He passed near several farmhouses and some\nlittle places whose names he did not learn.  He saw few\nfugitives until, in a grass lane towards High Barnet, he hap-\npened upon two ladies who became his fellow travellers.  He\ncame upon them just in time to save them.",
        "He heard their screams, and, hurrying round the corner,\nsaw a couple of men struggling to drag them out of the little\npony-chaise in which they had been driving, while a third\nwith difficulty held the frightened pony’s head.  One of the\nladies, a short woman dressed in white, was simply screaming;\nthe other, a dark, slender figure, slashed at the man who\ngripped her arm with a whip she held in her disengaged\nhand.",
        "My brother immediately grasped the situation, shouted, and\nhurried towards the struggle.  One of the men desisted and\nturned towards him, and my brother, realising from his an-\ntagonist’s face that a fight was unavoidable, and being an\nexpert boxer, went into him forthwith and sent him down\nagainst the wheel of the chaise.",
        "It was no time for pugilistic chivalry and my brother laid\nhim quiet with a kick, and gripped the collar of the man\nwho pulled at the slender lady’s arm.  He heard the clatter\nof hoofs, the whip stung across his face, a third antagonist\nstruck him between the eyes, and the man he held wrenched\nhimself free and made off down the lane in the direction from\nwhich he had come.",
        "Partly stunned, he found himself facing the man who had\nheld the horse’s head, and became aware of the chaise\nreceding from him down the lane, swaying from side to side,\nand with the women in it looking back.  The man before him,\na burly rough, tried to close, and he stopped him with a\nblow in the face.  Then, realising that he was deserted, he\ndodged round and made off down the lane after the chaise,\nwith the sturdy man close behind him, and the fugitive, who\nhad turned now, following remotely.",
        "Suddenly he stumbled and fell; his immediate pursuer\nwent headlong, and he rose to his feet to find himself with\na couple of antagonists again.  He would have had little\nchance against them had not the slender lady very pluckily\npulled up and returned to his help.  It seems she had had a\nrevolver all this time, but it had been under the seat when\nshe and her companion were attacked.  She fired at six yards’\ndistance, narrowly missing my brother.  The less courageous\nof the robbers made off, and his companion followed him,\ncursing his cowardice.  They both stopped in sight down the\nlane, where the third man lay insensible.",
        "“Take this!” said the slender lady, and she gave my brother\nher revolver.",
        "“Go back to the chaise,” said my brother, wiping the blood\nfrom his split lip.",
        "She turned without a word--they were both panting--and\nthey went back to where the lady in white struggled to hold\nback the frightened pony.",
        "The robbers had evidently had enough of it.  When my\nbrother looked again they were retreating.",
        "“I’ll sit here,” said my brother, “if I may\"; and he got upon\nthe empty front seat.  The lady looked over her shoulder.",
        "“Give me the reins,” she said, and laid the whip along the\npony’s side.  In another moment a bend in the road hid\nthe three men from my brother’s eyes.",
        "So, quite unexpectedly, my brother found himself, panting,\nwith a cut mouth, a bruised jaw, and bloodstained knuckles,\ndriving along an unknown lane with these two women.",
        "He learned they were the wife and the younger sister of\na surgeon living at Stanmore, who had come in the small\nhours from a dangerous case at Pinner, and heard at some\nrailway station on his way of the Martian advance.  He had\nhurried home, roused the women--their servant had left them\ntwo days before--packed some provisions, put his revolver\nunder the seat--luckily for my brother--and told them to\ndrive on to Edgware, with the idea of getting a train there.\nHe stopped behind to tell the neighbours.  He would overtake\nthem, he said, at about half past four in the morning, and\nnow it was nearly nine and they had seen nothing of him.\nThey could not stop in Edgware because of the growing\ntraffic through the place, and so they had come into this\nside lane.",
        "That was the story they told my brother in fragments when\npresently they stopped again, nearer to New Barnet.  He\npromised to stay with them, at least until they could deter-\nmine what to do, or until the missing man arrived, and pro-\nfessed to be an expert shot with the revolver--a weapon\nstrange to him--in order to give them confidence.",
        "They made a sort of encampment by the wayside, and the\npony became happy in the hedge.  He told them of his own\nescape out of London, and all that he knew of these Martians\nand their ways.  The sun crept higher in the sky, and after a\ntime their talk died out and gave place to an uneasy state of\nanticipation.  Several wayfarers came along the lane, and of\nthese my brother gathered such news as he could.  Every\nbroken answer he had deepened his impression of the great\ndisaster that had come on humanity, deepened his persuasion\nof the immediate necessity for prosecuting this flight.  He\nurged the matter upon them.",
        "“We have money,” said the slender woman, and hesitated.",
        "Her eyes met my brother’s, and her hesitation ended.",
        "“So have I,” said my brother.",
        "She explained that they had as much as thirty pounds in\ngold, besides a five-pound note, and suggested that with that\nthey might get upon a train at St. Albans or New Barnet.  My\nbrother thought that was hopeless, seeing the fury of the\nLondoners to crowd upon the trains, and broached his own\nidea of striking across Essex towards Harwich and thence\nescaping from the country altogether.",
        "Mrs. Elphinstone--that was the name of the woman in\nwhite--would listen to no reasoning, and kept calling upon\n\"George\"; but her sister-in-law was astonishingly quiet and\ndeliberate, and at last agreed to my brother’s suggestion.  So,\ndesigning to cross the Great North Road, they went on\ntowards Barnet, my brother leading the pony to save it as\nmuch as possible.\n  As the sun crept up the sky the day became excessively\nhot, and under foot a thick, whitish sand grew burning and\nblinding, so that they travelled only very slowly.  The hedges\nwere grey with dust.  And as they advanced towards Barnet\na tumultuous murmuring grew stronger.",
        "They began to meet more people.  For the most part these\nwere staring before them, murmuring indistinct questions,\njaded, haggard, unclean.  One man in evening dress passed\nthem on foot, his eyes on the ground.  They heard his voice,\nand, looking back at him, saw one hand clutched in his hair\nand the other beating invisible things.  His paroxysm of rage\nover, he went on his way without once looking back.",
        "As my brother’s party went on towards the crossroads to\nthe south of Barnet they saw a woman approaching the road\nacross some fields on their left, carrying a child and with two\nother children; and then passed a man in dirty black, with a\nthick stick in one hand and a small portmanteau in the other.\nThen round the corner of the lane, from between the villas\nthat guarded it at its confluence with the high road, came a\nlittle cart drawn by a sweating black pony and driven by a\nsallow youth in a bowler hat, grey with dust.  There were\nthree girls, East End factory girls, and a couple of little chil-\ndren crowded in the cart.",
        "“This’ll tike us rahnd Edgware?” asked the driver, wild-\neyed, white-faced; and when my brother told him it would\nif he turned to the left, he whipped up at once without the\nformality of thanks.",
        "My brother noticed a pale grey smoke or haze rising among\nthe houses in front of them, and veiling the white\nfacade of a terrace beyond the road that appeared\nbetween the backs of the villas.  Mrs. Elphinstone suddenly cried\nout at a number of tongues of smoky red flame leaping up above\nthe houses in front of them against the hot, blue sky.  The\ntumultuous noise resolved itself now into the disorderly mingling\nof many voices, the gride of many wheels, the creaking of\nwaggons, and the staccato of hoofs.  The lane came round sharply\nnot fifty yards from the crossroads.",
        "“Good heavens!” cried Mrs. Elphinstone.  “What is this\nyou are driving us into?”",
        "My brother stopped.",
        "For the main road was a boiling stream of people, a tor-\nrent of human beings rushing northward, one pressing on\nanother.  A great bank of dust, white and luminous in the\nblaze of the sun, made everything within twenty feet of the\nground grey and indistinct and was perpetually renewed by\nthe hurrying feet of a dense crowd of horses and of men and\nwomen on foot, and by the wheels of vehicles of every de-\nscription.",
        "“Way!” my brother heard voices crying.  “Make way!”",
        "It was like riding into the smoke of a fire to approach the\nmeeting point of the lane and road; the crowd roared like\na fire, and the dust was hot and pungent.  And, indeed, a\nlittle way up the road a villa was burning and sending rolling\nmasses of black smoke across the road to add to the con-\nfusion.",
        "Two men came past them.  Then a dirty woman, carrying a\nheavy bundle and weeping.  A lost retriever dog, with hanging\ntongue, circled dubiously round them, scared and wretched,\nand fled at my brother’s threat.",
        "So much as they could see of the road Londonward\nbetween the houses to the right was a tumultuous stream of\ndirty, hurrying people, pent in between the villas on either\nside; the black heads, the crowded forms, grew into distinct-\nness as they rushed towards the corner, hurried past, and\nmerged their individuality again in a receding multitude that\nwas swallowed up at last in a cloud of dust.",
        "“Go on!  Go on!” cried the voices.  “Way!  Way!”",
        "One man’s hands pressed on the back of another.  My\nbrother stood at the pony’s head.  Irresistibly attracted, he\nadvanced slowly, pace by pace, down the lane.",
        "Edgware had been a scene of confusion, Chalk Farm a\nriotous tumult, but this was a whole population in movement.\nIt is hard to imagine that host.  It had no character of its own.\nThe figures poured out past the corner, and receded with their\nbacks to the group in the lane.  Along the margin came those\nwho were on foot threatened by the wheels, stumbling in the\nditches, blundering into one another.",
        "The carts and carriages crowded close upon one another,\nmaking little way for those swifter and more impatient vehi-\ncles that darted forward every now and then when an\nopportunity showed itself of doing so, sending the people\nscattering against the fences and gates of the villas.",
        "“Push on!” was the cry.  “Push on!  They are coming!”",
        "In one cart stood a blind man in the uniform of the Salva-\ntion Army, gesticulating with his crooked fingers and bawling,\n\"Eternity!  Eternity!”  His voice was hoarse and very loud so\nthat my brother could hear him long after he was lost to\nsight in the dust.  Some of the people who crowded in the\ncarts whipped stupidly at their horses and quarrelled with\nother drivers; some sat motionless, staring at nothing with\nmiserable eyes; some gnawed their hands with thirst, or lay\nprostrate in the bottoms of their conveyances.  The horses” bits\nwere covered with foam, their eyes bloodshot.",
        "There were cabs, carriages, shop cars, waggons, beyond\ncounting; a mail cart, a road-cleaner’s cart marked “Vestry of\nSt. Pancras,” a huge timber waggon crowded with roughs.\nA brewer’s dray rumbled by with its two near wheels splashed\nwith fresh blood.",
        "“Clear the way!” cried the voices.  “Clear the way!”",
        "“Eter-nity!  Eter-nity!” came echoing down the road.",
        "There were sad, haggard women tramping by, well dressed,\nwith children that cried and stumbled, their dainty clothes\nsmothered in dust, their weary faces smeared with tears.  With\nmany of these came men, sometimes helpful, sometimes low-\nering and savage.  Fighting side by side with them pushed\nsome weary street outcast in faded black rags, wide-eyed,\nloud-voiced, and foul-mouthed.  There were sturdy workmen\nthrusting their way along, wretched, unkempt men, clothed\nlike clerks or shopmen, struggling spasmodically; a wounded\nsoldier my brother noticed, men dressed in the clothes of\nrailway porters, one wretched creature in a nightshirt with\na coat thrown over it.",
        "But varied as its composition was, certain things all that\nhost had in common.  There were fear and pain on their faces,\nand fear behind them.  A tumult up the road, a quarrel for a\nplace in a waggon, sent the whole host of them quickening\ntheir pace; even a man so scared and broken that his knees\nbent under him was galvanised for a moment into renewed\nactivity.  The heat and dust had already been at work upon\nthis multitude.  Their skins were dry, their lips black and\ncracked.  They were all thirsty, weary, and footsore.  And amid\nthe various cries one heard disputes, reproaches, groans of\nweariness and fatigue; the voices of most of them were\nhoarse and weak.  Through it all ran a refrain:",
        "“Way!  Way!  The Martians are coming!”",
        "Few stopped and came aside from that flood.  The lane\nopened slantingly into the main road with a narrow opening,\nand had a delusive appearance of coming from the direction\nof London.  Yet a kind of eddy of people drove into its mouth;\nweaklings elbowed out of the stream, who for the most part\nrested but a moment before plunging into it again.  A little\nway down the lane, with two friends bending over him, lay\na man with a bare leg, wrapped about with bloody rags.  He\nwas a lucky man to have friends.",
        "A little old man, with a grey military moustache and a\nfilthy black frock coat, limped out and sat down beside the\ntrap, removed his boot--his sock was blood-stained--shook\nout a pebble, and hobbled on again; and then a little girl of\neight or nine, all alone, threw herself under the hedge close\nby my brother, weeping.",
        "“I can’t go on!  I can’t go on!”",
        "My brother woke from his torpor of astonishment and lifted\nher up, speaking gently to her, and carried her to Miss Elphin-\nstone.  So soon as my brother touched her she became quite\nstill, as if frightened.",
        "“Ellen!” shrieked a woman in the crowd, with tears in her\nvoice--\"Ellen!”  And the child suddenly darted away from\nmy brother, crying “Mother!”",
        "“They are coming,” said a man on horseback, riding past\nalong the lane.",
        "“Out of the way, there!” bawled a coachman, towering\nhigh; and my brother saw a closed carriage turning into the\nlane.",
        "The people crushed back on one another to avoid the\nhorse.  My brother pushed the pony and chaise back into\nthe hedge, and the man drove by and stopped at the turn\nof the way.  It was a carriage, with a pole for a pair of horses,\nbut only one was in the traces.  My brother saw dimly through\nthe dust that two men lifted out something on a white\nstretcher and put it gently on the grass beneath the privet\nhedge.",
        "One of the men came running to my brother.",
        "“Where is there any water?” he said.  “He is dying fast,\nand very thirsty.  It is Lord Garrick.”",
        "“Lord Garrick!” said my brother; “the Chief Justice?”",
        "“The water?” he said.",
        "“There may be a tap,” said my brother, “in some of the\nhouses.  We have no water.  I dare not leave my people.”",
        "The man pushed against the crowd towards the gate of the\ncorner house.",
        "“Go on!” said the people, thrusting at him.  “They are\ncoming!  Go on!”",
        "Then my brother’s attention was distracted by a bearded,\neagle-faced man lugging a small handbag, which split even\nas my brother’s eyes rested on it and disgorged a mass of\nsovereigns that seemed to break up into separate coins as it\nstruck the ground.  They rolled hither and thither among the\nstruggling feet of men and horses.  The man stopped and\nlooked stupidly at the heap, and the shaft of a cab struck\nhis shoulder and sent him reeling.  He gave a shriek and\ndodged back, and a cartwheel shaved him narrowly.",
        "“Way!” cried the men all about him.  “Make way!”",
        "So soon as the cab had passed, he flung himself, with both\nhands open, upon the heap of coins, and began thrusting\nhandfuls in his pocket.  A horse rose close upon him, and in\nanother moment, half rising, he had been borne down under\nthe horse’s hoofs.",
        "“Stop!” screamed my brother, and pushing a woman out\nof his way, tried to clutch the bit of the horse.",
        "Before he could get to it, he heard a scream under the\nwheels, and saw through the dust the rim passing over the\npoor wretch’s back.  The driver of the cart slashed his whip\nat my brother, who ran round behind the cart.  The multi-\ntudinous shouting confused his ears.  The man was writhing\nin the dust among his scattered money, unable to rise, for\nthe wheel had broken his back, and his lower limbs lay limp\nand dead.  My brother stood up and yelled at the next driver,\nand a man on a black horse came to his assistance.",
        "“Get him out of the road,” said he; and, clutching the\nman’s collar with his free hand, my brother lugged him\nsideways.  But he still clutched after his money, and regarded\nmy brother fiercely, hammering at his arm with a handful\nof gold.  “Go on!  Go on!” shouted angry voices behind.",
        "“Way!  Way!”",
        "There was a smash as the pole of a carriage crashed into\nthe cart that the man on horseback stopped.  My brother\nlooked up, and the man with the gold twisted his head round\nand bit the wrist that held his collar.  There was a concussion,\nand the black horse came staggering sideways, and the\ncarthorse pushed beside it.  A hoof missed my brother’s foot\nby a hair’s breadth.  He released his grip on the fallen man\nand jumped back.  He saw anger change to terror on the face\nof the poor wretch on the ground, and in a moment he was\nhidden and my brother was borne backward and carried past\nthe entrance of the lane, and had to fight hard in the torrent\nto recover it.",
        "He saw Miss Elphinstone covering her eyes, and a little\nchild, with all a child’s want of sympathetic imagination,\nstaring with dilated eyes at a dusty something that lay black\nand still, ground and crushed under the rolling wheels.  “Let\nus go back!” he shouted, and began turning the pony round.\n\"We cannot cross this--hell,” he said and they went back a\nhundred yards the way they had come, until the fighting\ncrowd was hidden.  As they passed the bend in the lane my\nbrother saw the face of the dying man in the ditch under\nthe privet, deadly white and drawn, and shining with perspi-\nration.  The two women sat silent, crouching in their seat\nand shivering.",
        "Then beyond the bend my brother stopped again.  Miss\nElphinstone was white and pale, and her sister-in-law sat\nweeping, too wretched even to call upon “George.”  My\nbrother was horrified and perplexed.  So soon as they had\nretreated he realised how urgent and unavoidable it was to\nattempt this crossing.  He turned to Miss Elphinstone, sud-\ndenly resolute.",
        "“We must go that way,” he said, and led the pony round\nagain.",
        "For the second time that day this girl proved her quality.\nTo force their way into the torrent of people, my brother\nplunged into the traffic and held back a cab horse, while\nshe drove the pony across its head.  A waggon locked wheels\nfor a moment and ripped a long splinter from the chaise.\nIn another moment they were caught and swept forward by\nthe stream.  My brother, with the cabman’s whip marks red\nacross his face and hands, scrambled into the chaise and\ntook the reins from her.",
        "“Point the revolver at the man behind,” he said, giving it\nto her, “if he presses us too hard.  No!--point it at his horse.”",
        "Then he began to look out for a chance of edging to the\nright across the road.  But once in the stream he seemed to\nlose volition, to become a part of that dusty rout.  They swept\nthrough Chipping Barnet with the torrent; they were nearly\na mile beyond the centre of the town before they had fought\nacross to the opposite side of the way.  It was din and con-\nfusion indescribable; but in and beyond the town the road\nforks repeatedly, and this to some extent relieved the stress.",
        "They struck eastward through Hadley, and there on either\nside of the road, and at another place farther on they came\nupon a great multitude of people drinking at the stream,\nsome fighting to come at the water.  And farther on, from a\nlull near East Barnet, they saw two trains running slowly\none after the other without signal or order--trains swarming\nwith people, with men even among the coals behind the\nengines--going northward along the Great Northern Railway.\nMy brother supposes they must have filled outside London,\nfor at that time the furious terror of the people had rendered\nthe central termini impossible.",
        "Near this place they halted for the rest of the afternoon,\nfor the violence of the day had already utterly exhausted all\nthree of them.  They began to suffer the beginnings of hunger;\nthe night was cold, and none of them dared to sleep.  And in\nthe evening many people came hurrying along the road near-\nby their stopping place, fleeing from unknown dangers before\nthem, and going in the direction from which my brother\nhad come.",
        "\n   Had the Martians aimed only at destruction, they might\non Monday have annihilated the entire population of London,\nas it spread itself slowly through the home counties.  Not\nonly along the road through Barnet, but also through Edgware\nand Waltham Abbey, and along the roads eastward to South-\nend and Shoeburyness, and south of the Thames to Deal and\nBroadstairs, poured the same frantic rout.  If one could have\nhung that June morning in a balloon in the blazing blue\nabove London every northward and eastward road running out\nof the tangled maze of streets would have seemed stippled\nblack with the streaming fugitives, each dot a human agony\nof terror and physical distress.  I have set forth at length in\nthe last chapter my brother’s account of the road through\nChipping Barnet, in order that my readers may realise how\nthat swarming of black dots appeared to one of those con-\ncerned.  Never before in the history of the world had such a\nmass of human beings moved and suffered together.  The\nlegendary hosts of Goths and Huns, the hugest armies Asia\nhas ever seen, would have been but a drop in that current.\nAnd this was no disciplined march; it was a stampede--a\nstampede gigantic and terrible--without order and without\na goal, six million people unarmed and unprovisioned, driving\nheadlong.  It was the beginning of the rout of civilisation, of\nthe massacre of mankind.",
        "Directly below him the balloonist would have seen the\nnetwork of streets far and wide, houses, churches, squares,\ncrescents, gardens--already derelict--spread out like a huge\nmap, and in the southward BLOTTED.  Over Ealing, Richmond,\nWimbledon, it would have seemed as if some monstrous pen\nhad flung ink upon the chart.  Steadily, incessantly, each black\nsplash grew and spread, shooting out ramifications this way\nand that, now banking itself against rising ground, now\npouring swiftly over a crest into a new-found valley, exactly\nas a gout of ink would spread itself upon blotting paper.",
        "And beyond, over the blue hills that rise southward of\nthe river, the glittering Martians went to and fro, calmly\nand methodically spreading their poison cloud over this\npatch of country and then over that, laying it again with\ntheir steam jets when it had served its purpose, and taking\npossession of the conquered country.  They do not seem to\nhave aimed at extermination so much as at complete demoral-\nisation and the destruction of any opposition.  They exploded\nany stores of powder they came upon, cut every telegraph,\nand wrecked the railways here and there.  They were ham-\nstringing mankind.  They seemed in no hurry to extend the\nfield of their operations, and did not come beyond the central\npart of London all that day.  It is possible that a very con-\nsiderable number of people in London stuck to their houses\nthrough Monday morning.  Certain it is that many died at\nhome suffocated by the Black Smoke.",
        "Until about midday the Pool of London was an astonishing\nscene.  Steamboats and shipping of all sorts lay there, tempted\nby the enormous sums of money offered by fugitives, and it\nis said that many who swam out to these vessels were thrust\noff with boathooks and drowned.  About one o’clock in the\nafternoon the thinning remnant of a cloud of the black vapour\nappeared between the arches of Blackfriars Bridge.  At that\nthe Pool became a scene of mad confusion, fighting, and\ncollision, and for some time a multitude of boats and barges\njammed in the northern arch of the Tower Bridge, and the\nsailors and lightermen had to fight savagely against the\npeople who swarmed upon them from the riverfront.  People\nwere actually clambering down the piers of the bridge from\nabove.",
        "When, an hour later, a Martian appeared beyond the\nClock Tower and waded down the river, nothing but wreck-\nage floated above Limehouse.",
        "Of the falling of the fifth cylinder I have presently to tell.\nThe sixth star fell at Wimbledon.  My brother, keeping watch\nbeside the women in the chaise in a meadow, saw the green\nflash of it far beyond the hills.  On Tuesday the little party,\nstill set upon getting across the sea, made its way through\nthe swarming country towards Colchester.  The news that the\nMartians were now in possession of the whole of London was\nconfirmed.  They had been seen at Highgate, and even, it\nwas said, at Neasden.  But they did not come into my brother’s\nview until the morrow.",
        "That day the scattered multitudes began to realise the\nurgent need of provisions.  As they grew hungry the rights\nof property ceased to be regarded.  Farmers were out to\ndefend their cattle-sheds, granaries, and ripening root crops\nwith arms in their hands.  A number of people now, like my\nbrother, had their faces eastward, and there were some des-\nperate souls even going back towards London to get food.\nThese were chiefly people from the northern suburbs, whose\nknowledge of the Black Smoke came by hearsay.  He heard\nthat about half the members of the government had gathered\nat Birmingham, and that enormous quantities of high explo-\nsives were being prepared to be used in automatic mines\nacross the Midland counties.",
        "He was also told that the Midland Railway Company had\nreplaced the desertions of the first day’s panic, had resumed\ntraffic, and was running northward trains from St. Albans\nto relieve the congestion of the home counties.  There was\nalso a placard in Chipping Ongar announcing that large\nstores of flour were available in the northern towns and that\nwithin twenty-four hours bread would be distributed among\nthe starving people in the neighbourhood.  But this intelli-\ngence did not deter him from the plan of escape he had\nformed, and the three pressed eastward all day, and heard\nno more of the bread distribution than this promise.  Nor, as\na matter of fact, did anyone else hear more of it.  That night\nfell the seventh star, falling upon Primrose Hill.  It fell while\nMiss Elphinstone was watching, for she took that duty alter-\nnately with my brother.  She saw it.",
        "On Wednesday the three fugitives--they had passed the\nnight in a field of unripe wheat--reached Chelmsford, and\nthere a body of the inhabitants, calling itself the Committee\nof Public Supply, seized the pony as provisions, and would\ngive nothing in exchange for it but the promise of a share\nin it the next day.  Here there were rumours of Martians at\nEpping, and news of the destruction of Waltham Abbey\nPowder Mills in a vain attempt to blow up one of the invaders.",
        "People were watching for Martians here from the church\ntowers.  My brother, very luckily for him as it chanced, pre-\nferred to push on at once to the coast rather than wait for\nfood, although all three of them were very hungry.  By mid-\nday they passed through Tillingham, which, strangely enough,\nseemed to be quite silent and deserted, save for a few furtive\nplunderers hunting for food.  Near Tillingham they suddenly\ncame in sight of the sea, and the most amazing crowd of\nshipping of all sorts that it is possible to imagine.",
        "For after the sailors could no longer come up the Thames,\nthey came on to the Essex coast, to Harwich and Walton\nand Clacton, and afterwards to Foulness and Shoebury, to\nbring off the people.  They lay in a huge sickle-shaped curve\nthat vanished into mist at last towards the Naze.  Close inshore\nwas a multitude of fishing smacks--English, Scotch, French,\nDutch, and Swedish; steam launches from the Thames, yachts,\nelectric boats; and beyond were ships of large burden, a\nmultitude of filthy colliers, trim merchantmen, cattle ships,\npassenger boats, petroleum tanks, ocean tramps, an old white\ntransport even, neat white and grey liners from Southampton\nand Hamburg; and along the blue coast across the Blackwater\nmy brother could make out dimly a dense swarm of boats\nchaffering with the people on the beach, a swarm which also\nextended up the Blackwater almost to Maldon.",
        "About a couple of miles out lay an ironclad, very low in\nthe water, almost, to my brother’s perception, like a water-\nlogged ship.  This was the ram THUNDER CHILD.  It was the\nonly warship in sight, but far away to the right over the\nsmooth surface of the sea--for that day there was a dead\ncalm--lay a serpent of black smoke to mark the next iron-\nclads of the Channel Fleet, which hovered in an extended\nline, steam up and ready for action, across the Thames estuary\nduring the course of the Martian conquest, vigilant and yet\npowerless to prevent it.",
        "At the sight of the sea, Mrs. Elphinstone, in spite of the\nassurances of her sister-in-law, gave way to panic.  She had\nnever been out of England before, she would rather die than\ntrust herself friendless in a foreign country, and so forth.\nShe seemed, poor woman, to imagine that the French and the\nMartians might prove very similar.  She had been growing\nincreasingly hysterical, fearful, and depressed during the two\ndays’ journeyings.  Her great idea was to return to Stanmore.\nThings had been always well and safe at Stanmore.  They\nwould find George at Stanmore.",
        "It was with the greatest difficulty they could get her down\nto the beach, where presently my brother succeeded in\nattracting the attention of some men on a paddle steamer\nfrom the Thames.  They sent a boat and drove a bargain for\nthirty-six pounds for the three.  The steamer was going, these\nmen said, to Ostend.",
        "It was about two o’clock when my brother, having paid\ntheir fares at the gangway, found himself safely aboard the\nsteamboat with his charges.  There was food aboard, albeit\nat exorbitant prices, and the three of them contrived to eat\na meal on one of the seats forward.",
        "There were already a couple of score of passengers aboard,\nsome of whom had expended their last money in securing\na passage, but the captain lay off the Blackwater until five\nin the afternoon, picking up passengers until the seated decks\nwere even dangerously crowded.  He would probably have\nremained longer had it not been for the sound of guns that\nbegan about that hour in the south.  As if in answer, the\nironclad seaward fired a small gun and hoisted a string of\nflags.  A jet of smoke sprang out of her funnels.",
        "Some of the passengers were of opinion that this firing\ncame from Shoeburyness, until it was noticed that it was\ngrowing louder.  At the same time, far away in the southeast\nthe masts and upperworks of three ironclads rose one after\nthe other out of the sea, beneath clouds of black smoke.  But\nmy brother’s attention speedily reverted to the distant firing\nin the south.  He fancied he saw a column of smoke rising\nout of the distant grey haze.",
        "The little steamer was already flapping her way eastward\nof the big crescent of shipping, and the low Essex coast was\ngrowing blue and hazy, when a Martian appeared, small and\nfaint in the remote distance, advancing along the muddy\ncoast from the direction of Foulness.  At that the captain on\nthe bridge swore at the top of his voice with fear and anger\nat his own delay, and the paddles seemed infected with his\nterror.  Every soul aboard stood at the bulwarks or on the seats\nof the steamer and stared at that distant shape, higher than\nthe trees or church towers inland, and advancing with a\nleisurely parody of a human stride.",
        "It was the first Martian my brother had seen, and he\nstood, more amazed than terrified, watching this Titan\nadvancing deliberately towards the shipping, wading farther\nand farther into the water as the coast fell away.  Then, far\naway beyond the Crouch, came another, striding over some\nstunted trees, and then yet another, still farther off, wading\ndeeply through a shiny mudflat that seemed to hang halfway\nup between sea and sky.  They were all stalking seaward, as\nif to intercept the escape of the multitudinous vessels that\nwere crowded between Foulness and the Naze.  In spite of\nthe throbbing exertions of the engines of the little paddle-\nboat, and the pouring foam that her wheels flung behind\nher, she receded with terrifying slowness from this ominous\nadvance.",
        "Glancing northwestward, my brother saw the large crescent\nof shipping already writhing with the approaching terror;\none ship passing behind another, another coming round from\nbroadside to end on, steamships whistling and giving off\nvolumes of steam, sails being let out, launches rushing hither\nand thither.  He was so fascinated by this and by the creeping\ndanger away to the left that he had no eyes for anything\nseaward.  And then a swift movement of the steamboat (she\nhad suddenly come round to avoid being run down) flung\nhim headlong from the seat upon which he was standing.\nThere was a shouting all about him, a trampling of feet, and\na cheer that seemed to be answered faintly.  The steamboat\nlurched and rolled him over upon his hands.",
        "He sprang to his feet and saw to starboard, and not a\nhundred yards from their heeling, pitching boat, a vast iron\nbulk like the blade of a plough tearing through the water,\ntossing it on either side in huge waves of foam that leaped\ntowards the steamer, flinging her paddles helplessly in the\nair, and then sucking her deck down almost to the waterline.",
        "A douche of spray blinded my brother for a moment.\nWhen his eyes were clear again he saw the monster had\npassed and was rushing landward.  Big iron upperworks rose\nout of this headlong structure, and from that twin funnels\nprojected and spat a smoking blast shot with fire.  It was the\ntorpedo ram, THUNDER CHILD, steaming headlong, coming to\nthe rescue of the threatened shipping.",
        "Keeping his footing on the heaving deck by clutching the\nbulwarks, my brother looked past this charging leviathan at\nthe Martians again, and he saw the three of them now close\ntogether, and standing so far out to sea that their tripod\nsupports were almost entirely submerged.  Thus sunken, and\nseen in remote perspective, they appeared far less formidable\nthan the huge iron bulk in whose wake the steamer was\npitching so helplessly.  It would seem they were regarding\nthis new antagonist with astonishment.  To their intelligence,\nit may be, the giant was even such another as themselves.\nThe THUNDER CHILD fired no gun, but simply drove full speed\ntowards them.  It was probably her not firing that enabled\nher to get so near the enemy as she did.  They did not know\nwhat to make of her.  One shell, and they would have sent\nher to the bottom forthwith with the Heat-Ray.",
        "She was steaming at such a pace that in a minute she\nseemed halfway between the steamboat and the Martians--\na diminishing black bulk against the receding horizontal\nexpanse of the Essex coast.",
        "Suddenly the foremost Martian lowered his tube and dis-\ncharged a canister of the black gas at the ironclad.  It hit her\nlarboard side and glanced off in an inky jet that rolled away\nto seaward, an unfolding torrent of Black Smoke, from which\nthe ironclad drove clear.  To the watchers from the steamer,\nlow in the water and with the sun in their eyes, it seemed\nas though she were already among the Martians.",
        "They saw the gaunt figures separating and rising out of\nthe water as they retreated shoreward, and one of them\nraised the camera-like generator of the Heat-Ray.  He held it\npointing obliquely downward, and a bank of steam sprang\nfrom the water at its touch.  It must have driven through the\niron of the ship’s side like a white-hot iron rod through paper.",
        "A flicker of flame went up through the rising steam, and\nthen the Martian reeled and staggered.  In another moment\nhe was cut down, and a great body of water and steam shot\nhigh in the air.  The guns of the THUNDER CHILD sounded\nthrough the reek, going off one after the other, and one shot\nsplashed the water high close by the steamer, ricocheted\ntowards the other flying ships to the north, and smashed a\nsmack to matchwood.",
        "But no one heeded that very much.  At the sight of the\nMartian’s collapse the captain on the bridge yelled inarticu-\nlately, and all the crowding passengers on the steamer’s stern\nshouted together.  And then they yelled again.  For, surging\nout beyond the white tumult, drove something long and\nblack, the flames streaming from its middle parts, its ventila-\ntors and funnels spouting fire.",
        " She was alive still; the steering gear, it seems, was intact\nand her engines working.  She headed straight for a second\nMartian, and was within a hundred yards of him when the\nHeat-Ray came to bear.  Then with a violent thud, a blinding\nflash, her decks, her funnels, leaped upward.  The Martian\nstaggered with the violence of her explosion, and in another\nmoment the flaming wreckage, still driving forward with the\nimpetus of its pace, had struck him and crumpled him up\nlike a thing of cardboard.  My brother shouted involuntarily.\nA boiling tumult of steam hid everything again.",
        "“Two!,” yelled the captain.",
        "Everyone was shouting.  The whole steamer from end to\nend rang with frantic cheering that was taken up first by one\nand then by all in the crowding multitude of ships and boats\nthat was driving out to sea.",
        "The steam hung upon the water for many minutes, hiding\nthe third Martian and the coast altogether.  And all this time\nthe boat was paddling steadily out to sea and away from the\nfight; and when at last the confusion cleared, the drifting\nbank of black vapour intervened, and nothing of the\nTHUNDER CHILD could be made out, nor could the third\nMartian be seen.  But the ironclads to seaward were now\nquite close and standing in towards shore past the steamboat.",
        "The little vessel continued to beat its way seaward, and\nthe ironclads receded slowly towards the coast, which was\nhidden still by a marbled bank of vapour, part steam, part\nblack gas, eddying and combining in the strangest way.  The\nfleet of refugees was scattering to the northeast; several\nsmacks were sailing between the ironclads and the steamboat.\nAfter a time, and before they reached the sinking cloud bank,\nthe warships turned northward, and then abruptly went\nabout and passed into the thickening haze of evening south-\nward.  The coast grew faint, and at last indistinguishable amid\nthe low banks of clouds that were gathering about the\nsinking sun.",
        "Then suddenly out of the golden haze of the sunset came\nthe vibration of guns, and a form of black shadows moving.\nEveryone struggled to the rail of the steamer and peered into\nthe blinding furnace of the west, but nothing was to be dis-\ntinguished clearly.  A mass of smoke rose slanting and barred\nthe face of the sun.  The steamboat throbbed on its way\nthrough an interminable suspense.",
        "The sun sank into grey clouds, the sky flushed and dark-\nened, the evening star trembled into sight.  It was deep\ntwilight when the captain cried out and pointed.  My brother\nstrained his eyes.  Something rushed up into the sky out of\nthe greyness--rushed slantingly upward and very swiftly\ninto the luminous clearness above the clouds in the western\nsky; something flat and broad, and very large, that swept\nround in a vast curve, grew smaller, sank slowly, and van-\nished again into the grey mystery of the night.  And as it\nflew it rained down darkness upon the land.",
        "\n   In the first book I have wandered so much from my own\nadventures to tell of the experiences of my brother that all\nthrough the last two chapters I and the curate have been\nlurking in the empty house at Halliford whither we fled to\nescape the Black Smoke.  There I will resume.  We stopped\nthere all Sunday night and all the next day--the day of the\npanic--in a little island of daylight, cut off by the Black\nSmoke from the rest of the world.  We could do nothing but\nwait in aching inactivity during those two weary days.",
        "My mind was occupied by anxiety for my wife.  I figured\nher at Leatherhead, terrified, in danger, mourning me already\nas a dead man.  I paced the rooms and cried aloud when I\nthought of how I was cut off from her, of all that might hap-\npen to her in my absence.  My cousin I knew was brave\nenough for any emergency, but he was not the sort of man to\nrealise danger quickly, to rise promptly.  What was needed\nnow was not bravery, but circumspection.  My only consola-\ntion was to believe that the Martians were moving London-\nward and away from her.  Such vague anxieties keep the mind\nsensitive and painful.  I grew very weary and irritable with\nthe curate’s perpetual ejaculations; I tired of the sight of his\nselfish despair.  After some ineffectual remonstrance I kept\naway from him, staying in a room--evidently a children’s\nschoolroom--containing globes, forms, and copybooks.  When\nhe followed me thither, I went to a box room at the top of the\nhouse and, in order to be alone with my aching miseries,\nlocked myself in.",
        "We were hopelessly hemmed in by the Black Smoke all\nthat day and the morning of the next.  There were signs of\npeople in the next house on Sunday evening--a face at a\nwindow and moving lights, and later the slamming of a door.\nBut I do not know who these people were, nor what became\nof them.  We saw nothing of them next day.  The Black Smoke\ndrifted slowly riverward all through Monday morning, creep-\ning nearer and nearer to us, driving at last along the roadway\noutside the house that hid us.",
        "A Martian came across the fields about midday, laying\nthe stuff with a jet of superheated steam that hissed against\nthe walls, smashed all the windows it touched, and scalded\nthe curate’s hand as he fled out of the front room.  When at\nlast we crept across the sodden rooms and looked out again,\nthe country northward was as though a black snowstorm had\npassed over it.  Looking towards the river, we were astonished\nto see an unaccountable redness mingling with the black of\nthe scorched meadows.",
        "For a time we did not see how this change affected our\nposition, save that we were relieved of our fear of the Black\nSmoke.  But later I perceived that we were no longer hemmed\nin, that now we might get away.  So soon as I realised that\nthe way of escape was open, my dream of action returned.  But\nthe curate was lethargic, unreasonable.",
        "“We are safe here,” he repeated; “safe here.”",
        "I resolved to leave him--would that I had!  Wiser now for\nthe artilleryman’s teaching, I sought out food and drink.  I\nhad found oil and rags for my burns, and I also took a hat\nand a flannel shirt that I found in one of the bedrooms.  When\nit was clear to him that I meant to go alone--had reconciled\nmyself to going alone--he suddenly roused himself to come.\nAnd all being quiet throughout the afternoon, we started\nabout five o’clock, as I should judge, along the blackened\nroad to Sunbury.",
        "In Sunbury, and at intervals along the road, were dead\nbodies lying in contorted attitudes, horses as well as men,\noverturned carts and luggage, all covered thickly with black\ndust.  That pall of cindery powder made me think of what I\nhad read of the destruction of Pompeii.  We got to Hampton\nCourt without misadventure, our minds full of strange and\nunfamiliar appearances, and at Hampton Court our eyes were\nrelieved to find a patch of green that had escaped the suf-\nfocating drift.  We went through Bushey Park, with its deer\ngoing to and fro under the chestnuts, and some men and\nwomen hurrying in the distance towards Hampton, and so we\ncame to Twickenham.  These were the first people we saw.",
        "Away across the road the woods beyond Ham and Peter-\nsham were still afire.  Twickenham was uninjured by either\nHeat-Ray or Black Smoke, and there were more people about\nhere, though none could give us news.  For the most part\nthey were like ourselves, taking advantage of a lull to shift\ntheir quarters.  I have an impression that many of the houses\nhere were still occupied by scared inhabitants, too frightened\neven for flight.  Here too the evidence of a hasty rout was\nabundant along the road.  I remember most vividly three\nsmashed bicycles in a heap, pounded into the road by the\nwheels of subsequent carts.  We crossed Richmond Bridge\nabout half past eight.  We hurried across the exposed bridge,\nof course, but I noticed floating down the stream a number of\nred masses, some many feet across.  I did not know what these\nwere--there was no time for scrutiny--and I put a more\nhorrible interpretation on them than they deserved.  Here again\non the Surrey side were black dust that had once been smoke,\nand dead bodies--a heap near the approach to the station;\nbut we had no glimpse of the Martians until we were some\nway towards Barnes.",
        "We saw in the blackened distance a group of three people\nrunning down a side street towards the river, but otherwise it\nseemed deserted.  Up the hill Richmond town was burning\nbriskly; outside the town of Richmond there was no trace of\nthe Black Smoke.",
        "Then suddenly, as we approached Kew, came a number\nof people running, and the upperworks of a Martian fighting-\nmachine loomed in sight over the housetops, not a hundred\nyards away from us.  We stood aghast at our danger, and had\nthe Martian looked down we must immediately have perished.\nWe were so terrified that we dared not go on, but turned\naside and hid in a shed in a garden.  There the curate\ncrouched, weeping silently, and refusing to stir again.",
        "But my fixed idea of reaching Leatherhead would not let\nme rest, and in the twilight I ventured out again.  I went\nthrough a shrubbery, and along a passage beside a big house\nstanding in its own grounds, and so emerged upon the road\ntowards Kew.  The curate I left in the shed, but he came\nhurrying after me.",
        "That second start was the most foolhardy thing I ever did.\nFor it was manifest the Martians were about us.  No sooner\nhad the curate overtaken me than we saw either the fighting-\nmachine we had seen before or another, far away across the\nmeadows in the direction of Kew Lodge.  Four or five little\nblack figures hurried before it across the green-grey of the\nfield, and in a moment it was evident this Martian pursued\nthem.  In three strides he was among them, and they ran\nradiating from his feet in all directions.  He used no Heat-Ray\nto destroy them, but picked them up one by one.  Apparently\nhe tossed them into the great metallic carrier which projected\nbehind him, much as a workman’s basket hangs over his\nshoulder.",
        "It was the first time I realised that the Martians might have\nany other purpose than destruction with defeated humanity.\nWe stood for a moment petrified, then turned and fled through\na gate behind us into a walled garden, fell into, rather than\nfound, a fortunate ditch, and lay there, scarce daring to\nwhisper to each other until the stars were out.",
        "I suppose it was nearly eleven o’clock before we gathered\ncourage to start again, no longer venturing into the road, but\nsneaking along hedgerows and through plantations, and\nwatching keenly through the darkness, he on the right and I\non the left, for the Martians, who seemed to be all about us.\nIn one place we blundered upon a scorched and blackened\narea, now cooling and ashen, and a number of scattered dead\nbodies of men, burned horribly about the heads and trunks\nbut with their legs and boots mostly intact; and of dead\nhorses, fifty feet, perhaps, behind a line of four ripped guns\nand smashed gun carriages.",
        "Sheen, it seemed, had escaped destruction, but the place\nwas silent and deserted.  Here we happened on no dead,\nthough the night was too dark for us to see into the side\nroads of the place.  In Sheen my companion suddenly com-\nplained of faintness and thirst, and we decided to try one of\nthe houses.",
        "The first house we entered, after a little difficulty with\nthe window, was a small semi-detached villa, and I found\nnothing eatable left in the place but some mouldy\ncheese.  There was, however, water to drink; and I took a\nhatchet, which promised to be useful in our next house-\nbreaking.",
        "We then crossed to a place where the road turns towards\nMortlake.  Here there stood a white house within a walled\ngarden, and in the pantry of this domicile we found a store\nof food--two loaves of bread in a pan, an uncooked steak, and\nthe half of a ham.  I give this catalogue so precisely because,\nas it happened, we were destined to subsist upon this store\nfor the next fortnight.  Bottled beer stood under a shelf, and\nthere were two bags of haricot beans and some limp lettuces.\nThis pantry opened into a kind of wash-up kitchen, and in\nthis was firewood; there was also a cupboard, in which we\nfound nearly a dozen of burgundy, tinned soups and salmon,\nand two tins of biscuits.",
        "We sat in the adjacent kitchen in the dark--for we dared\nnot strike a light--and ate bread and ham, and drank beer\nout of the same bottle.  The curate, who was still timorous\nand restless, was now, oddly enough, for pushing on, and I\nwas urging him to keep up his strength by eating when the\nthing happened that was to imprison us.",
        "“It can’t be midnight yet,” I said, and then came a blinding\nglare of vivid green light.  Everything in the kitchen leaped\nout, clearly visible in green and black, and vanished again.\nAnd then followed such a concussion as I have never heard\nbefore or since.  So close on the heels of this as to seem in-\nstantaneous came a thud behind me, a clash of glass, a crash\nand rattle of falling masonry all about us, and the plaster of\nthe ceiling came down upon us, smashing into a multitude\nof fragments upon our heads.  I was knocked headlong across\nthe floor against the oven handle and stunned.  I was insensible\nfor a long time, the curate told me, and when I came to we\nwere in darkness again, and he, with a face wet, as I found\nafterwards, with blood from a cut forehead, was dabbing\nwater over me.",
        "For some time I could not recollect what had happened.\nThen things came to me slowly.  A bruise on my temple as-\nserted itself.",
        "“Are you better?” asked the curate in a whisper.",
        "At last I answered him.  I sat up.",
        "“Don’t move,” he said.  “The floor is covered with smashed\ncrockery from the dresser.  You can’t possibly move without\nmaking a noise, and I fancy THEY are outside.”",
        "We both sat quite silent, so that we could scarcely hear\neach other breathing.  Everything seemed deadly still, but\nonce something near us, some plaster or broken brickwork,\nslid down with a rumbling sound.  Outside and very near was\nan intermittent, metallic rattle.",
        "“That!” said the curate, when presently it happened\nagain.",
        "“Yes,” I said.  “But what is it?”",
        "“A Martian!” said the curate.",
        "I listened again.",
        "“It was not like the Heat-Ray,” I said, and for a time I was\ninclined to think one of the great fighting-machines had\nstumbled against the house, as I had seen one stumble against\nthe tower of Shepperton Church.",
        "Our situation was so strange and incomprehensible that for\nthree or four hours, until the dawn came, we scarcely moved.\nAnd then the light filtered in, not through the window, which\nremained black, but through a triangular aperture between\na beam and a heap of broken bricks in the wall behind us.\nThe interior of the kitchen we now saw greyly for the first\ntime.",
        " The window had been burst in by a mass of garden mould,\nwhich flowed over the table upon which we had been sitting\nand lay about our feet.  Outside, the soil was banked high\nagainst the house.  At the top of the window frame we could\nsee an uprooted drainpipe.  The floor was littered with\nsmashed hardware; the end of the kitchen towards the house\nwas broken into, and since the daylight shone in there, it was\nevident the greater part of the house had collapsed.  Con-\ntrasting vividly with this ruin was the neat dresser, stained\nin the fashion, pale green, and with a number of copper and\ntin vessels below it, the wallpaper imitating blue and white\ntiles, and a couple of coloured supplements fluttering from the\nwalls above the kitchen range.",
        "As the dawn grew clearer, we saw through the gap in the\nwall the body of a Martian, standing sentinel, I suppose, over\nthe still glowing cylinder.  At the sight of that we crawled as\ncircumspectly as possible out of the twilight of the kitchen\ninto the darkness of the scullery.",
        "Abruptly the right interpretation dawned upon my mind.",
        "“The fifth cylinder,” I whispered, “the fifth shot from\nMars, has struck this house and buried us under the ruins!”",
        "For a time the curate was silent, and then he whispered:",
        "“God have mercy upon us!”",
        "I heard him presently whimpering to himself.",
        "Save for that sound we lay quite still in the scullery; I\nfor my part scarce dared breathe, and sat with my eyes\nfixed on the faint light of the kitchen door.  I could just see\nthe curate’s face, a dim, oval shape, and his collar and cuffs.\nOutside there began a metallic hammering, then a violent\nhooting, and then again, after a quiet interval, a hissing like\nthe hissing of an engine.  These noises, for the most part\nproblematical, continued intermittently, and seemed if any-\nthing to increase in number as time wore on.  Presently a\nmeasured thudding and a vibration that made everything\nabout us quiver and the vessels in the pantry ring and shift,\nbegan and continued.  Once the light was eclipsed, and the\nghostly kitchen doorway became absolutely dark.  For many\nhours we must have crouched there, silent and shivering,\nuntil our tired attention failed. . . .",
        "At last I found myself awake and very hungry.  I am in-\nclined to believe we must have spent the greater portion of\na day before that awakening.  My hunger was at a stride\nso insistent that it moved me to action.  I told the curate I\nwas going to seek food, and felt my way towards the pantry.\nHe made me no answer, but so soon as I began eating the\nfaint noise I made stirred him up and I heard him crawling\nafter me.",
        "\n   After eating we crept back to the scullery, and there I\nmust have dozed again, for when presently I looked round I\nwas alone.  The thudding vibration continued with wearisome\npersistence.  I whispered for the curate several times, and at\nlast felt my way to the door of the kitchen.  It was still day-\nlight, and I perceived him across the room, lying against\nthe triangular hole that looked out upon the Martians.  His\nshoulders were hunched, so that his head was hidden from me.",
        "I could hear a number of noises almost like those in an\nengine shed; and the place rocked with that beating thud.\nThrough the aperture in the wall I could see the top of a\ntree touched with gold and the warm blue of a tranquil\nevening sky.  For a minute or so I remained watching the\ncurate, and then I advanced, crouching and stepping with\nextreme care amid the broken crockery that littered the floor.",
        "I touched the curate’s leg, and he started so violently that\na mass of plaster went sliding down outside and fell with a\nloud impact.  I gripped his arm, fearing he might cry out,\nand for a long time we crouched motionless.  Then I turned\nto see how much of our rampart remained.  The detachment\nof the plaster had left a vertical slit open in the debris, and\nby raising myself cautiously across a beam I was able to see\nout of this gap into what had been overnight a quiet suburban\nroadway.  Vast, indeed, was the change that we beheld.",
        "The fifth cylinder must have fallen right into the midst\nof the house we had first visited.  The building had vanished,\ncompletely smashed, pulverised, and dispersed by the blow.\nThe cylinder lay now far beneath the original foundations--\ndeep in a hole, already vastly larger than the pit I had\nlooked into at Woking.  The earth all round it had splashed\nunder that tremendous impact--\"splashed” is the only word\n--and lay in heaped piles that hid the masses of the adjacent\nhouses.  It had behaved exactly like mud under the violent\nblow of a hammer.  Our house had collapsed backward; the\nfront portion, even on the ground floor, had been destroyed\ncompletely; by a chance the kitchen and scullery had escaped,\nand stood buried now under soil and ruins, closed in by\ntons of earth on every side save towards the cylinder.  Over\nthat aspect we hung now on the very edge of the great\ncircular pit the Martians were engaged in making.  The heavy\nbeating sound was evidently just behind us, and ever and\nagain a bright green vapour drove up like a veil across our\npeephole.",
        "The cylinder was already opened in the centre of the pit,\nand on the farther edge of the pit, amid the smashed and\ngravel-heaped shrubbery, one of the great fighting-machines,\ndeserted by its occupant, stood stiff and tall against the\nevening sky.  At first I scarcely noticed the pit and the\ncylinder, although it has been convenient to describe them\nfirst, on account of the extraordinary glittering mechanism I\nsaw busy in the excavation, and on account of the strange\ncreatures that were crawling slowly and painfully across the\nheaped mould near it.",
        "The mechanism it certainly was that held my attention first.\nIt was one of those complicated fabrics that have since been\ncalled handling-machines, and the study of which has already\ngiven such an enormous impetus to terrestrial invention.  As\nit dawned upon me first, it presented a sort of metallic spider\nwith five jointed, agile legs, and with an extraordinary number\nof jointed levers, bars, and reaching and clutching tentacles\nabout its body.  Most of its arms were retracted, but with\nthree long tentacles it was fishing out a number of rods,\nplates, and bars which lined the covering and apparently\nstrengthened the walls of the cylinder.  These, as it ex-\ntracted them, were lifted out and deposited upon a level\nsurface of earth behind it.",
        "Its motion was so swift, complex, and perfect that at first\nI did not see it as a machine, in spite of its metallic glitter.\nThe fighting-machines were co-ordinated and animated to\nan extraordinary pitch, but nothing to compare with this.\nPeople who have never seen these structures, and have only\nthe ill-imagined efforts of artists or the imperfect descriptions\nof such eye-witnesses as myself to go upon, scarcely realise\nthat living quality.",
        "I recall particularly the illustration of one of the first\npamphlets to give a consecutive account of the war.  The\nartist had evidently made a hasty study of one of the\nfighting-machines, and there his knowledge ended.  He pre-\nsented them as tilted, stiff tripods, without either flexibility\nor subtlety, and with an altogether misleading monotony of\neffect.  The pamphlet containing these renderings had a con-\nsiderable vogue, and I mention them here simply to warn\nthe reader against the impression they may have created.\nThey were no more like the Martians I saw in action than\na Dutch doll is like a human being.  To my mind, the pamphlet\nwould have been much better without them.",
        "At first, I say, the handling-machine did not impress me\nas a machine, but as a crablike creature with a glittering\nintegument, the controlling Martian whose delicate tentacles\nactuated its movements seeming to be simply the equivalent\nof the crab’s cerebral portion.  But then I perceived the re-\nsemblance of its grey-brown, shiny, leathery integument to\nthat of the other sprawling bodies beyond, and the true\nnature of this dexterous workman dawned upon me.  With\nthat realisation my interest shifted to those other creatures,\nthe real Martians.  Already I had had a transient impression of\nthese, and the first nausea no longer obscured my observa-\ntion.  Moreover, I was concealed and motionless, and under\nno urgency of action.",
        "They were, I now saw, the most unearthly creatures it\nis possible to conceive.  They were huge round bodies--or,\nrather, heads--about four feet in diameter, each body having\nin front of it a face.  This face had no nostrils--indeed, the\nMartians do not seem to have had any sense of smell, but\nit had a pair of very large dark-coloured eyes, and just\nbeneath this a kind of fleshy beak.  In the back of this head or\nbody--I scarcely know how to speak of it--was the single\ntight tympanic surface, since known to be anatomically an ear,\nthough it must have been almost useless in our dense air.\nIn a group round the mouth were sixteen slender, almost\nwhiplike tentacles, arranged in two bunches of eight each.\nThese bunches have since been named rather aptly, by that\ndistinguished anatomist, Professor Howes, the HANDS.  Even\nas I saw these Martians for the first time they seemed to\nbe endeavouring to raise themselves on these hands, but of\ncourse, with the increased weight of terrestrial conditions,\nthis was impossible.  There is reason to suppose that on Mars\nthey may have progressed upon them with some facility.",
        "The internal anatomy, I may remark here, as dissection\nhas since shown, was almost equally simple.  The greater\npart of the structure was the brain, sending enormous nerves\nto the eyes, ear, and tactile tentacles.  Besides this were the\nbulky lungs, into which the mouth opened, and the heart\nand its vessels.  The pulmonary distress caused by the denser\natmosphere and greater gravitational attraction was only too\nevident in the convulsive movements of the outer skin.",
        "And this was the sum of the Martian organs.  Strange as it\nmay seem to a human being, all the complex apparatus of\ndigestion, which makes up the bulk of our bodies, did not\nexist in the Martians.  They were heads--merely heads.\nEntrails they had none.  They did not eat, much less digest.\nInstead, they took the fresh, living blood of other creatures,\nand INJECTED it into their own veins.  I have myself seen this\nbeing done, as I shall mention in its place.  But, squeamish\nas I may seem, I cannot bring myself to describe what I\ncould not endure even to continue watching.  Let it suffice\nto say, blood obtained from a still living animal, in most\ncases from a human being, was run directly by means of a\nlittle pipette into the recipient canal. . . .",
        "The bare idea of this is no doubt horribly repulsive to us,\nbut at the same time I think that we should remember how\nrepulsive our carnivorous habits would seem to an intelligent\nrabbit.",
        "The physiological advantages of the practice of injection\nare undeniable, if one thinks of the tremendous waste of\nhuman time and energy occasioned by eating and the\ndigestive process.  Our bodies are half made up of glands\nand tubes and organs, occupied in turning heterogeneous\nfood into blood.  The digestive processes and their reaction\nupon the nervous system sap our strength and colour our\nminds.  Men go happy or miserable as they have healthy or\nunhealthy livers, or sound gastric glands.  But the Martians\nwere lifted above all these organic fluctuations of mood and\nemotion.",
        "Their undeniable preference for men as their source of\nnourishment is partly explained by the nature of the remains\nof the victims they had brought with them as provisions\nfrom Mars.  These creatures, to judge from the shrivelled\nremains that have fallen into human hands, were bipeds\nwith flimsy, silicious skeletons (almost like those of the\nsilicious sponges) and feeble musculature, standing about\nsix feet high and having round, erect heads, and large eyes\nin flinty sockets.  Two or three of these seem to have been\nbrought in each cylinder, and all were killed before earth\nwas reached.  It was just as well for them, for the mere\nattempt to stand upright upon our planet would have broken\nevery bone in their bodies.",
        "And while I am engaged in this description, I may add\nin this place certain further details which, although they\nwere not all evident to us at the time, will enable the\nreader who is unacquainted with them to form a clearer\npicture of these offensive creatures.",
        "In three other points their physiology differed strangely\nfrom ours.  Their organisms did not sleep, any more than the\nheart of man sleeps.  Since they had no extensive muscular\nmechanism to recuperate, that periodical extinction was\nunknown to them.  They had little or no sense of fatigue, it\nwould seem.  On earth they could never have moved without\neffort, yet even to the last they kept in action.  In twenty-four\nhours they did twenty-four hours of work, as even on earth\nis perhaps the case with the ants.",
        "In the next place, wonderful as it seems in a sexual world,\nthe Martians were absolutely without sex, and therefore\nwithout any of the tumultuous emotions that arise from that\ndifference among men.  A young Martian, there can now be\nno dispute, was really born upon earth during the war, and\nit was found attached to its parent, partially BUDDED off, just\nas young lilybulbs bud off, or like the young animals in the\nfresh-water polyp.",
        "In man, in all the higher terrestrial animals, such a method\nof increase has disappeared; but even on this earth it was\ncertainly the primitive method.  Among the lower animals,\nup even to those first cousins of the vertebrated animals, the\nTunicates, the two processes occur side by side, but finally\nthe sexual method superseded its competitor altogether.  On\nMars, however, just the reverse has apparently been the case.",
        "It is worthy of remark that a certain speculative writer of\nquasi-scientific repute, writing long before the Martian inva-\nsion, did forecast for man a final structure not unlike the\nactual Martian condition.  His prophecy, I remember, appeared\nin November or December, 1893, in a long-defunct publica-\ntion, the PALL MALL BUDGET, and I recall a caricature of it in\na pre-Martian periodical called PUNCH.  He pointed out--\nwriting in a foolish, facetious tone--that the perfection of\nmechanical appliances must ultimately supersede limbs; the\nperfection of chemical devices, digestion; that such organs\nas hair, external nose, teeth, ears, and chin were no longer\nessential parts of the human being, and that the tendency\nof natural selection would lie in the direction of their steady\ndiminution through the coming ages.  The brain alone re-\nmained a cardinal necessity.  Only one other part of the\nbody had a strong case for survival, and that was the hand,\n\"teacher and agent of the brain.”  While the rest of the body\ndwindled, the hands would grow larger.",
        "There is many a true word written in jest, and here in\nthe Martians we have beyond dispute the actual accomplish-\nment of such a suppression of the animal side of the organism\nby the intelligence.  To me it is quite credible that the\nMartians may be descended from beings not unlike ourselves,\nby a gradual development of brain and hands (the latter\ngiving rise to the two bunches of delicate tentacles at last)\nat the expense of the rest of the body.  Without the body the\nbrain would, of course, become a mere selfish intelligence,\nwithout any of the emotional substratum of the human being.",
        "The last salient point in which the systems of these\ncreatures differed from ours was in what one might have\nthought a very trivial particular.  Micro-organisms, which\ncause so much disease and pain on earth, have either never\nappeared upon Mars or Martian sanitary science eliminated\nthem ages ago.  A hundred diseases, all the fevers and con-\ntagions of human life, consumption, cancers, tumours and\nsuch morbidities, never enter the scheme of their life.  And\nspeaking of the differences between the life on Mars and\nterrestrial life, I may allude here to the curious suggestions\nof the red weed.",
        "Apparently the vegetable kingdom in Mars, instead of\nhaving green for a dominant colour, is of a vivid blood-red\ntint.  At any rate, the seeds which the Martians (intentionally\nor accidentally) brought with them gave rise in all cases to\nred-coloured growths.  Only that known popularly as the red\nweed, however, gained any footing in competition with\nterrestrial forms.  The red creeper was quite a transitory\ngrowth, and few people have seen it growing.  For a time,\nhowever, the red weed grew with astonishing vigour and\nluxuriance.  It spread up the sides of the pit by the third or\nfourth day of our imprisonment, and its cactus-like branches\nformed a carmine fringe to the edges of our triangular\nwindow.  And afterwards I found it broadcast throughout the\ncountry, and especially wherever there was a stream of water.",
        "The Martians had what appears to have been an auditory\norgan, a single round drum at the back of the head-body,\nand eyes with a visual range not very different from ours\nexcept that, according to Philips, blue and violet were as\nblack to them.  It is commonly supposed that they com-\nmunicated by sounds and tentacular gesticulations; this is\nasserted, for instance, in the able but hastily compiled\npamphlet (written evidently by someone not an eye-witness\nof Martian actions) to which I have already alluded, and\nwhich, so far, has been the chief source of information con-\ncerning them.  Now no surviving human being saw so much\nof the Martians in action as I did.  I take no credit to myself\nfor an accident, but the fact is so.  And I assert that I watched\nthem closely time after time, and that I have seen four, five,\nand (once) six of them sluggishly performing the most elabo-\nrately complicated operations together without either sound\nor gesture.  Their peculiar hooting invariably preceded feed-\ning; it had no modulation, and was, I believe, in no sense\na signal, but merely the expiration of air preparatory to the\nsuctional operation.  I have a certain claim to at least an\nelementary knowledge of psychology, and in this matter I\nam convinced--as firmly as I am convinced of anything--that\nthe Martians interchanged thoughts without any physical\nintermediation.  And I have been convinced of this in spite\nof strong preconceptions.  Before the Martian invasion, as an\noccasional reader here or there may remember, I had written\nwith some little vehemence against the telepathic theory.",
        "The Martians wore no clothing.  Their conceptions of orna-\nment and decorum were necessarily different from ours; and\nnot only were they evidently much less sensible of changes of\ntemperature than we are, but changes of pressure do not\nseem to have affected their health at all seriously.  Yet though\nthey wore no clothing, it was in the other artificial additions\nto their bodily resources that their great superiority over man\nlay.  We men, with our bicycles and road-skates, our Lilienthal\nsoaring-machines, our guns and sticks and so forth, are just\nin the beginning of the evolution that the Martians have\nworked out.  They have become practically mere brains,\nwearing different bodies according to their needs just as\nmen wear suits of clothes and take a bicycle in a hurry or an\numbrella in the wet.  And of their appliances, perhaps nothing\nis more wonderful to a man than the curious fact that what\nis the dominant feature of almost all human devices in\nmechanism is absent--the WHEEL is absent; among all the\nthings they brought to earth there is no trace or suggestion\nof their use of wheels.  One would have at least expected it\nin locomotion.  And in this connection it is curious to remark\nthat even on this earth Nature has never hit upon the wheel,\nor has preferred other expedients to its development.  And\nnot only did the Martians either not know of (which is\nincredible), or abstain from, the wheel, but in their apparatus\nsingularly little use is made of the fixed pivot or relatively\nfixed pivot, with circular motions thereabout confined to one\nplane.  Almost all the joints of the machinery present a com-\nplicated system of sliding parts moving over small but beauti-\nfully curved friction bearings.  And while upon this matter\nof detail, it is remarkable that the long leverages of their\nmachines are in most cases actuated by a sort of sham\nmusculature of the disks in an elastic sheath; these disks\nbecome polarised and drawn closely and powerfully together\nwhen traversed by a current of electricity.  In this way the\ncurious parallelism to animal motions, which was so striking\nand disturbing to the human beholder, was attained.  Such\nquasi-muscles abounded in the crablike handling-machine\nwhich, on my first peeping out of the slit, I watched un-\npacking the cylinder.  It seemed infinitely more alive than the\nactual Martians lying beyond it in the sunset light, panting,\nstirring ineffectual tentacles, and moving feebly after their\nvast journey across space.",
        "While I was still watching their sluggish motions in the\nsunlight, and noting each strange detail of their form, the\ncurate reminded me of his presence by pulling violently at\nmy arm.  I turned to a scowling face, and silent, eloquent\nlips.  He wanted the slit, which permitted only one of us\nto peep through; and so I had to forego watching them for a\ntime while he enjoyed that privilege.",
        "When I looked again, the busy handling-machine had\nalready put together several of the pieces of apparatus it\nhad taken out of the cylinder into a shape having an un-\nmistakable likeness to its own; and down on the left a busy\nlittle digging mechanism had come into view, emitting jets\nof green vapour and working its way round the pit, excavating\nand embanking in a methodical and discriminating manner.\nThis it was which had caused the regular beating noise, and\nthe rhythmic shocks that had kept our ruinous refuge quiver-\ning.  It piped and whistled as it worked.  So far as I could\nsee, the thing was without a directing Martian at all.",
        "The arrival of a second fighting-machine drove us from\nour peephole into the scullery, for we feared that from his\nelevation the Martian might see down upon us behind our\nbarrier.  At a later date we began to feel less in danger of\ntheir eyes, for to an eye in the dazzle of the sunlight outside\nour refuge must have been blank blackness, but at first the\nslightest suggestion of approach drove us into the scullery\nin heart-throbbing retreat.  Yet terrible as was the danger we\nincurred, the attraction of peeping was for both of us irresist-\nible.  And I recall now with a sort of wonder that, in spite\nof the infinite danger in which we were between starvation\nand a still more terrible death, we could yet struggle bitterly\nfor that horrible privilege of sight.  We would race across the\nkitchen in a grotesque way between eagerness and the dread\nof making a noise, and strike each other, and thrust add kick,\nwithin a few inches of exposure.",
        "The fact is that we had absolutely incompatible dispositions\nand habits of thought and action, and our danger and isolation\nonly accentuated the incompatibility.  At Halliford I had al-\nready come to hate the curate’s trick of helpless exclamation,\nhis stupid rigidity of mind.  His endless muttering monologue\nvitiated every effort I made to think out a line of action, and\ndrove me at times, thus pent up and intensified, almost to the\nverge of craziness.  He was as lacking in restraint as a silly\nwoman.  He would weep for hours together, and I verily\nbelieve that to the very end this spoiled child of life thought\nhis weak tears in some way efficacious.  And I would sit in\nthe darkness unable to keep my mind off him by reason of\nhis importunities.  He ate more than I did, and it was in vain\nI pointed out that our only chance of life was to stop in the\nhouse until the Martians had done with their pit, that in that\nlong patience a time might presently come when we should\nneed food.  He ate and drank impulsively in heavy meals at\nlong intervals.  He slept little.",
        "As the days wore on, his utter carelessness of any considera-\ntion so intensified our distress and danger that I had, much as\nI loathed doing it, to resort to threats, and at last to blows.\nThat brought him to reason for a time.  But he was one of\nthose weak creatures, void of pride, timorous, anaemic, hateful\nsouls, full of shifty cunning, who face neither God nor man,\nwho face not even themselves.",
        " It is disagreeable for me to recall and write these things,\nbut I set them down that my story may lack nothing.  Those\nwho have escaped the dark and terrible aspects of life will\nfind my brutality, my flash of rage in our final tragedy, easy\nenough to blame; for they know what is wrong as well as\nany, but not what is possible to tortured men.  But those who\nhave been under the shadow, who have gone down at last to\nelemental things, will have a wider charity.",
        "And while within we fought out our dark, dim contest of\nwhispers, snatched food and drink, and gripping hands and\nblows, without, in the pitiless sunlight of that terrible June,\nwas the strange wonder, the unfamiliar routine of the\nMartians in the pit.  Let me return to those first new experi-\nences of mine.  After a long time I ventured back to the\npeephole, to find that the new-comers had been reinforced\nby the occupants of no fewer than three of the fighting-\nmachines.  These last had brought with them certain fresh\nappliances that stood in an orderly manner about the cylinder.\nThe second handling-machine was now completed, and was\nbusied in serving one of the novel contrivances the big\nmachine had brought.  This was a body resembling a milk can\nin its general form, above which oscillated a pear-shaped\nreceptacle, and from which a stream of white powder flowed\ninto a circular basin below.",
        "The oscillatory motion was imparted to this by one tentacle\nof the handling-machine.  With two spatulate hands the\nhandling-machine was digging out and flinging masses of clay\ninto the pear-shaped receptacle above, while with another arm\nit periodically opened a door and removed rusty and black-\nened clinkers from the middle part of the machine.  Another\nsteely tentacle directed the powder from the basin along a\nribbed channel towards some receiver that was hidden from\nme by the mound of bluish dust.  From this unseen receiver a\nlittle thread of green smoke rose vertically into the quiet air.\nAs I looked, the handling-machine, with a faint and musical\nclinking, extended, telescopic fashion, a tentacle that had\nbeen a moment before a mere blunt projection, until its end\nwas hidden behind the mound of clay.  In another second it\nhad lifted a bar of white aluminium into sight, untarnished as\nyet, and shining dazzlingly, and deposited it in a growing stack\nof bars that stood at the side of the pit.  Between sunset and\nstarlight this dexterous machine must have made more than\na hundred such bars out of the crude clay, and the mound\nof bluish dust rose steadily until it topped the side of the\npit.",
        "The contrast between the swift and complex movements\nof these contrivances and the inert panting clumsiness of\ntheir masters was acute, and for days I had to tell myself\nrepeatedly that these latter were indeed the living of the two\nthings.",
        "The curate had possession of the slit when the first men\nwere brought to the pit.  I was sitting below, huddled up,\nlistening with all my ears.  He made a sudden movement\nbackward, and I, fearful that we were observed, crouched\nin a spasm of terror.  He came sliding down the rubbish and\ncrept beside me in the darkness, inarticulate, gesticulating,\nand for a moment I shared his panic.  His gesture suggested\na resignation of the slit, and after a little while my curiosity\ngave me courage, and I rose up, stepped across him, and\nclambered up to it.  At first I could see no reason for his\nfrantic behaviour.  The twilight had now come, the stars were\nlittle and faint, but the pit was illuminated by the flickering\ngreen fire that came from the aluminium-making.  The whole\npicture was a flickering scheme of green gleams and shifting\nrusty black shadows, strangely trying to the eyes.  Over and\nthrough it all went the bats, heeding it not at all.  The\nsprawling Martians were no longer to be seen, the mound\nof blue-green powder had risen to cover them from sight,\nand a fighting-machine, with its legs contracted, crumpled,\nand abbreviated, stood across the corner of the pit.  And\nthen, amid the clangour of the machinery, came a drifting\nsuspicion of human voices, that I entertained at first only\nto dismiss.",
        "I crouched, watching this fighting-machine closely, satisfy-\ning myself now for the first time that the hood did indeed\ncontain a Martian.  As the green flames lifted I could see the\noily gleam of his integument and the brightness of his eyes.\nAnd suddenly I heard a yell, and saw a long tentacle reach-\ning over the shoulder of the machine to the little cage that\nhunched upon its back.  Then something--something strug-\ngling violently--was lifted high against the sky, a black,\nvague enigma against the starlight; and as this black object\ncame down again, I saw by the green brightness that it was\na man.  For an instant he was clearly visible.  He was a stout,\nruddy, middle-aged man, well dressed; three days before,\nhe must have been walking the world, a man of considerable\nconsequence.  I could see his staring eyes and gleams of light\non his studs and watch chain.  He vanished behind the\nmound, and for a moment there was silence.  And then began\na shrieking and a sustained and cheerful hooting from the\nMartians.",
        "I slid down the rubbish, struggled to my feet, clapped\nmy hands over my ears, and bolted into the scullery.  The\ncurate, who had been crouching silently with his arms\nover his head, looked up as I passed, cried out quite loudly\nat my desertion of him, and came running after me.",
        "That night, as we lurked in the scullery, balanced between\nour horror and the terrible fascination this peeping had, al-\nthough I felt an urgent need of action I tried in vain to\nconceive some plan of escape; but afterwards, during the\nsecond day, I was able to consider our position with great\nclearness.  The curate, I found, was quite incapable of dis-\ncussion; this new and culminating atrocity had robbed him\nof all vestiges of reason or forethought.  Practically he had\nalready sunk to the level of an animal.  But as the saying\ngoes, I gripped myself with both hands.  It grew upon my\nmind, once I could face the facts, that terrible as our posi-\ntion was, there was as yet no justification for absolute despair.\nOur chief chance lay in the possibility of the Martians making\nthe pit nothing more than a temporary encampment.  Or\neven if they kept it permanently, they might not consider\nit necessary to guard it, and a chance of escape might be\nafforded us.  I also weighed very carefully the possibility of\nour digging a way out in a direction away from the pit,\nbut the chances of our emerging within sight of some\nsentinel fighting-machine seemed at first too great.  And I\nshould have had to do all the digging myself.  The curate\nwould certainly have failed me.",
        "It was on the third day, if my memory serves me right,\nthat I saw the lad killed.  It was the only occasion on which\nI actually saw the Martians feed.  After that experience I\navoided the hole in the wall for the better part of a day.\nI went into the scullery, removed the door, and spent some\nhours digging with my hatchet as silently as possible; but\nwhen I had made a hole about a couple of feet deep the\nloose earth collapsed noisily, and I did not dare continue.  I\nlost heart, and lay down on the scullery floor for a long time,\nhaving no spirit even to move.  And after that I abandoned\naltogether the idea of escaping by excavation.",
        "It says much for the impression the Martians had made\nupon me that at first I entertained little or no hope of our\nescape being brought about by their overthrow through any\nhuman effort.  But on the fourth or fifth night I heard a\nsound like heavy guns.",
        "It was very late in the night, and the moon was shining\nbrightly.  The Martians had taken away the excavating-\nmachine, and, save for a fighting-machine that stood in\nthe remoter bank of the pit and a handling-machine that\nwas buried out of my sight in a corner of the pit immedi-\nately beneath my peephole, the place was deserted by them.\nExcept for the pale glow from the handling-machine and the\nbars and patches of white moonlight the pit was in dark-\nness, and, except for the clinking of the handling-machine,\nquite still.  That night was a beautiful serenity; save for one\nplanet, the moon seemed to have the sky to herself.  I heard\na dog howling, and that familiar sound it was that made\nme listen.  Then I heard quite distinctly a booming ex-\nactly like the sound of great guns.  Six distinct reports I\ncounted, and after a long interval six again.  And that was\nall.",
        "\n   It was on the sixth day of our imprisonment that I\npeeped for the last time, and presently found myself alone.\nInstead of keeping close to me and trying to oust me from\nthe slit, the curate had gone back into the scullery.  I was\nstruck by a sudden thought.  I went back quickly and quietly\ninto the scullery.  In the darkness I heard the curate drink-\ning.  I snatched in the darkness, and my fingers caught a\nbottle of burgundy.",
        "For a few minutes there was a tussle.  The bottle struck\nthe floor and broke, and I desisted and rose.  We stood\npanting and threatening each other.  In the end I planted\nmyself between him and the food, and told him of my\ndetermination to begin a discipline.  I divided the food in\nthe pantry, into rations to last us ten days.  I would not\nlet him eat any more that day.  In the afternoon he made\na feeble effort to get at the food.  I had been dozing, but\nin an instant I was awake.  All day and all night we sat\nface to face, I weary but resolute, and he weeping and com-\nplaining of his immediate hunger.  It was, I know, a night\nand a day, but to me it seemed--it seems now--an inter-\nminable length of time.",
        "And so our widened incompatibility ended at last in open\nconflict.  For two vast days we struggled in undertones and\nwrestling contests.  There were times when I beat and kicked\nhim madly, times when I cajoled and persuaded him, and\nonce I tried to bribe him with the last bottle of burgundy,\nfor there was a rain-water pump from which I could get\nwater.  But neither force nor kindness availed; he was indeed\nbeyond reason.  He would neither desist from his attacks on\nthe food nor from his noisy babbling to himself.  The rudi-\nmentary precautions to keep our imprisonment endurable\nhe would not observe.  Slowly I began to realise the complete\noverthrow of his intelligence, to perceive that my sole com-\npanion in this close and sickly darkness was a man insane.",
        "From certain vague memories I am inclined to think my\nown mind wandered at times.  I had strange and hideous\ndreams whenever I slept.  It sounds paradoxical, but I am\ninclined to think that the weakness and insanity of the\ncurate warned me, braced me, and kept me a sane man.",
        "On the eighth day he began to talk aloud instead of whis-\npering, and nothing I could do would moderate his speech.",
        "“It is just, O God!” he would say, over and over again.\n\"It is just.  On me and mine be the punishment laid.  We\nhave sinned, we have fallen short.  There was poverty,\nsorrow; the poor were trodden in the dust, and I held my\npeace.  I preached acceptable folly--my God, what folly!\n--when I should have stood up, though I died for it, and\ncalled upon them to repent-repent! . . . Oppressors of the\npoor and needy . . . !  The wine press of God!”",
        "Then he would suddenly revert to the matter of the food\nI withheld from him, praying, begging, weeping, at last\nthreatening.  He began to raise his voice--I prayed him not\nto.  He perceived a hold on me--he threatened he would\nshout and bring the Martians upon us.  For a time that scared\nme; but any concession would have shortened our chance\nof escape beyond estimating.  I defied him, although I felt\nno assurance that he might not do this thing.  But that day,\nat any rate, he did not.  He talked with his voice rising slowly,\nthrough the greater part of the eighth and ninth days--\nthreats, entreaties, mingled with a torrent of half-sane and\nalways frothy repentance for his vacant sham of God’s\nservice, such as made me pity him.  Then he slept awhile, and\nbegan again with renewed strength, so loudly that I must\nneeds make him desist.",
        "“Be still!” I implored.",
        "He rose to his knees, for he had been sitting in the dark-\nness near the copper.",
        "“I have been still too long,” he said, in a tone that must\nhave reached the pit, “and now I must bear my witness.\nWoe unto this unfaithful city!  Woe!  Woe!  Woe!  Woe!  Woe!\nTo the inhabitants of the earth by reason of the other voices\nof the trumpet----”",
        "“Shut up!” I said, rising to my feet, and in a terror lest\nthe Martians should hear us.  “For God’s sake----”",
        "“Nay,” shouted the curate, at the top of his voice, stand-\ning likewise and extending his arms.  “Speak!  The word of the\nLord is upon me!”",
        "In three strides he was at the door leading into the kitchen.",
        "“I must bear my witness!  I go!  It has already been too long\ndelayed.”",
        "I put out my hand and felt the meat chopper hanging to\nthe wall.  In a flash I was after him.  I was fierce with fear.\nBefore he was halfway across the kitchen I had overtaken\nhim.  With one last touch of humanity I turned the blade\nback and struck him with the butt.  He went headlong for-\nward and lay stretched on the ground.  I stumbled over him\nand stood panting.  He lay still.",
        "Suddenly I heard a noise without, the run and smash of\nslipping plaster, and the triangular aperture in the wall was\ndarkened.  I looked up and saw the lower surface of a\nhandling-machine coming slowly across the hole.  One of its\ngripping limbs curled amid the debris; another limb ap-\npeared, feeling its way over the fallen beams.  I stood\npetrified, staring.  Then I saw through a sort of glass plate\nnear the edge of the body the face, as we may call it, and\nthe large dark eyes of a Martian, peering, and then a long\nmetallic snake of tentacle came feeling slowly through the\nhole.",
        "I turned by an effort, stumbled over the curate, and\nstopped at the scullery door.  The tentacle was now some\nway, two yards or more, in the room, and twisting and turn-\ning, with queer sudden movements, this way and that.  For\na while I stood fascinated by that slow, fitful advance.  Then,\nwith a faint, hoarse cry, I forced myself across the scullery.\nI trembled violently; I could scarcely stand upright.  I opened\nthe door of the coal cellar, and stood there in the darkness\nstaring at the faintly lit doorway into the kitchen, and listen-\ning.  Had the Martian seen me?  What was it doing now?",
        "Something was moving to and fro there, very quietly;\nevery now and then it tapped against the wall, or started\non its movements with a faint metallic ringing, like the\nmovements of keys on a split-ring.  Then a heavy body--I\nknew too well what--was dragged across the floor of the\nkitchen towards the opening.  Irresistibly attracted, I crept\nto the door and peeped into the kitchen.  In the triangle of\nbright outer sunlight I saw the Martian, in its Briareus of a\nhandling-machine, scrutinizing the curate’s head.  I thought\nat once that it would infer my presence from the mark of\nthe blow I had given him.",
        "I crept back to the coal cellar, shut the door, and began\nto cover myself up as much as I could, and as noiselessly as\npossible in the darkness, among the firewood and coal\ntherein.  Every now and then I paused, rigid, to hear if the\nMartian had thrust its tentacles through the opening again.",
        "Then the faint metallic jingle returned.  I traced it slowly\nfeeling over the kitchen.  Presently I heard it nearer--in the\nscullery, as I judged.  I thought that its length might be in-\nsufficient to reach me.  I prayed copiously.  It passed, scrap-\ning faintly across the cellar door.  An age of almost intolerable\nsuspense intervened; then I heard it fumbling at the latch!\nIt had found the door!  The Martians understood doors!",
        "It worried at the catch for a minute, perhaps, and then\nthe door opened.",
        "In the darkness I could just see the thing--like an ele-\nphant’s trunk more than anything else--waving towards me\nand touching and examining the wall, coals, wood and ceil-\ning.  It was like a black worm swaying its blind head to\nand fro.",
        "Once, even, it touched the heel of my boot.  I was on the\nverge of screaming; I bit my hand.  For a time the tentacle\nwas silent.  I could have fancied it had been withdrawn.\nPresently, with an abrupt click, it gripped something--I\nthought it had me!--and seemed to go out of the cellar again.\nFor a minute I was not sure.  Apparently it had taken a lump\nof coal to examine.",
        "I seized the opportunity of slightly shifting my position,\nwhich had become cramped, and then listened.  I whispered\npassionate prayers for safety.",
        "Then I heard the slow, deliberate sound creeping towards\nme again.  Slowly, slowly it drew near, scratching against the\nwalls and tapping the furniture.",
        "While I was still doubtful, it rapped smartly against the\ncellar door and closed it.  I heard it go into the pantry, and\nthe biscuit-tins rattled and a bottle smashed, and then came\na heavy bump against the cellar door.  Then silence that\npassed into an infinity of suspense.",
        "Had it gone?",
        "At last I decided that it had.",
        "It came into the scullery no more; but I lay all the tenth\nday in the close darkness, buried among coals and firewood,\nnot daring even to crawl out for the drink for which I craved.\nIt was the eleventh day before I ventured so far from my\nsecurity.",
        "\n   My first act before I went into the pantry was to fasten\nthe door between the kitchen and the scullery.  But the\npantry was empty; every scrap of food had gone.  Appar-\nently, the Martian had taken it all on the previous day.  At\nthat discovery I despaired for the first time.  I took no food,\nor no drink either, on the eleventh or the twelfth day.",
        "At first my mouth and throat were parched, and my\nstrength ebbed sensibly.  I sat about in the darkness of the\nscullery, in a state of despondent wretchedness.  My mind\nran on eating.  I thought I had become deaf, for the noises\nof movement I had been accustomed to hear from the pit\nhad ceased absolutely.  I did not feel strong enough to crawl\nnoiselessly to the peephole, or I would have gone there.",
        "On the twelfth day my throat was so painful that, taking\nthe chance of alarming the Martians, I attacked the creaking\nrain-water pump that stood by the sink, and got a couple\nof glassfuls of blackened and tainted rain water.  I was\ngreatly refreshed by this, and emboldened by the fact that\nno enquiring tentacle followed the noise of my pumping.",
        "During these days, in a rambling, inconclusive way, I\nthought much of the curate and of the manner of his death.",
        "On the thirteenth day I drank some more water, and\ndozed and thought disjointedly of eating and of vague im-\npossible plans of escape.  Whenever I dozed I dreamt of\nhorrible phantasms, of the death of the curate, or of sump-\ntuous dinners; but, asleep or awake, I felt a keen pain that\nurged me to drink again and again.  The light that came into\nthe scullery was no longer grey, but red.  To my disordered\nimagination it seemed the colour of blood.",
        "On the fourteenth day I went into the kitchen, and I was\nsurprised to find that the fronds of the red weed had grown\nright across the hole in the wall, turning the half-light of the\nplace into a crimson-coloured obscurity.",
        "It was early on the fifteenth day that I heard a curious,\nfamiliar sequence of sounds in the kitchen, and, listening,\nidentified it as the snuffing and scratching of a dog.  Going\ninto the kitchen, I saw a dog’s nose peering in through a\nbreak among the ruddy fronds.  This greatly surprised me.\nAt the scent of me he barked shortly.",
        "I thought if I could induce him to come into the place\nquietly I should be able, perhaps, to kill and eat him; and\nin any case, it would be advisable to kill him, lest his actions\nattracted the attention of the Martians.",
        "I crept forward, saying “Good dog!” very softly; but he\nsuddenly withdrew his head and disappeared.",
        "I listened--I was not deaf--but certainly the pit was still.\nI heard a sound like the flutter of a bird’s wings, and a hoarse\ncroaking, but that was all.",
        "For a long while I lay close to the peephole, but not daring\nto move aside the red plants that obscured it.  Once or twice\nI heard a faint pitter-patter like the feet of the dog going\nhither and thither on the sand far below me, and there were\nmore birdlike sounds, but that was all.  At length, encouraged\nby the silence, I looked out.",
        "Except in the corner, where a multitude of crows hopped\nand fought over the skeletons of the dead the Martians had\nconsumed, there was not a living thing in the pit.",
        "I stared about me, scarcely believing my eyes.  All the\nmachinery had gone.  Save for the big mound of greyish-blue\npowder in one corner, certain bars of aluminium in another,\nthe black birds, and the skeletons of the killed, the place\nwas merely an empty circular pit in the sand.",
        "Slowly I thrust myself out through the red weed, and\nstood upon the mound of rubble.  I could see in any direction\nsave behind me, to the north, and neither Martians nor sign\nof Martians were to be seen.  The pit dropped sheerly from\nmy feet, but a little way along the rubbish afforded a prac-\nticable slope to the summit of the ruins.  My chance of escape\nhad come.  I began to tremble.",
        "I hesitated for some time, and then, in a gust of desperate\nresolution, and with a heart that throbbed violently, I\nscrambled to the top of the mound in which I had been\nburied so long.",
        "I looked about again.  To the northward, too, no Martian\nwas visible.",
        "When I had last seen this part of Sheen in the daylight\nit had been a straggling street of comfortable white and\nred houses, interspersed with abundant shady trees.  Now\nI stood on a mound of smashed brickwork, clay, and gravel,\nover which spread a multitude of red cactus-shaped plants,\nknee-high, without a solitary terrestrial growth to dispute\ntheir footing.  The trees near me were dead and brown, but\nfurther a network of red thread scaled the still living stems.",
        "The neighbouring houses had all been wrecked, but none\nhad been burned; their walls stood, sometimes to the second\nstory, with smashed windows and shattered doors.  The red\nweed grew tumultuously in their roofless rooms.  Below me\nwas the great pit, with the crows struggling for its refuse.\nA number of other birds hopped about among the ruins.  Far\naway I saw a gaunt cat slink crouchingly along a wall, but\ntraces of men there were none.",
        "The day seemed, by contrast with my recent confinement,\ndazzlingly bright, the sky a glowing blue.  A gentle breeze\nkept the red weed that covered every scrap of unoccupied\nground gently swaying.  And oh! the sweetness of the air!",
        "\n   For some time I stood tottering on the mound regardless\nof my safety.  Within that noisome den from which I had\nemerged I had thought with a narrow intensity only of our\nimmediate security.  I had not realised what had been hap-\npening to the world, had not anticipated this startling vision\nof unfamiliar things.  I had expected to see Sheen in ruins--\nI found about me the landscape, weird and lurid, of another\nplanet.",
        "For that moment I touched an emotion beyond the common\nrange of men, yet one that the poor brutes we dominate\nknow only too well.  I felt as a rabbit might feel returning\nto his burrow and suddenly confronted by the work of a\ndozen busy navvies digging the foundations of a house.  I\nfelt the first inkling of a thing that presently grew quite\nclear in my mind, that oppressed me for many days, a sense\nof dethronement, a persuasion that I was no longer a master,\nbut an animal among the animals, under the Martian heel.\nWith us it would be as with them, to lurk and watch, to run\nand hide; the fear and empire of man had passed away.",
        "But so soon as this strangeness had been realised it passed,\nand my dominant motive became the hunger of my long\nand dismal fast.  In the direction away from the pit I saw,\nbeyond a red-covered wall, a patch of garden ground un-\nburied.  This gave me a hint, and I went knee-deep, and\nsometimes neck-deep, in the red weed.  The density of the\nweed gave me a reassuring sense of hiding.  The wall was\nsome six feet high, and when I attempted to clamber it I\nfound I could not lift my feet to the crest.  So I went along\nby the side of it, and came to a corner and a rockwork that\nenabled me to get to the top, and tumble into the garden\nI coveted.  Here I found some young onions, a couple of\ngladiolus bulbs, and a quantity of immature carrots, all of\nwhich I secured, and, scrambling over a ruined wall, went\non my way through scarlet and crimson trees towards Kew--\nit was like walking through an avenue of gigantic blood\ndrops--possessed with two ideas: to get more food, and to\nlimp, as soon and as far as my strength permitted, out of\nthis accursed unearthly region of the pit.",
        "Some way farther, in a grassy place, was a group of mush-\nrooms which also I devoured, and then I came upon a brown\nsheet of flowing shallow water, where meadows used to be.\nThese fragments of nourishment served only to whet my\nhunger.  At first I was surprised at this flood in a hot, dry\nsummer, but afterwards I discovered that it was caused by\nthe tropical exuberance of the red weed.  Directly this extraor-\ndinary growth encountered water it straightway became\ngigantic and of unparalleled fecundity.  Its seeds were simply\npoured down into the water of the Wey and Thames, and\nits swiftly growing and Titanic water fronds speedily choked\nboth those rivers.",
        "At Putney, as I afterwards saw, the bridge was almost\nlost in a tangle of this weed, and at Richmond, too, the\nThames water poured in a broad and shallow stream across\nthe meadows of Hampton and Twickenham.  As the water\nspread the weed followed them, until the ruined villas of\nthe Thames valley were for a time lost in this red swamp,\nwhose margin I explored, and much of the desolation the\nMartians had caused was concealed.",
        "In the end the red weed succumbed almost as quickly as\nit had spread.  A cankering disease, due, it is believed, to the\naction of certain bacteria, presently seized upon it.  Now by\nthe action of natural selection, all terrestrial plants have\nacquired a resisting power against bacterial diseases--they\nnever succumb without a severe struggle, but the red weed\nrotted like a thing already dead.  The fronds became bleached,\nand then shrivelled and brittle.  They broke off at the least\ntouch, and the waters that had stimulated their early growth\ncarried their last vestiges out to sea.",
        "My first act on coming to this water was, of course, to\nslake my thirst.  I drank a great deal of it and, moved by an\nimpulse, gnawed some fronds of red weed; but they were\nwatery, and had a sickly, metallic taste.  I found the water\nwas sufficiently shallow for me to wade securely, although\nthe red weed impeded my feet a little; but the flood evidently\ngot deeper towards the river, and I turned back to Mortlake.\nI managed to make out the road by means of occasional\nruins of its villas and fences and lamps, and so presently I\ngot out of this spate and made my way to the hill going up\ntowards Roehampton and came out on Putney Common.",
        "Here the scenery changed from the strange and unfamiliar\nto the wreckage of the familiar: patches of ground exhibited\nthe devastation of a cyclone, and in a few score yards I\nwould come upon perfectly undisturbed spaces, houses with\ntheir blinds trimly drawn and doors closed, as if they had\nbeen left for a day by the owners, or as if their inhabitants\nslept within.  The red weed was less abundant; the tall trees\nalong the lane were free from the red creeper.  I hunted for\nfood among the trees, finding nothing, and I also raided a\ncouple of silent houses, but they had already been broken\ninto and ransacked.  I rested for the remainder of the day-\nlight in a shrubbery, being, in my enfeebled condition, too\nfatigued to push on.",
        "All this time I saw no human beings, and no signs of the\nMartians.  I encountered a couple of hungry-looking dogs,\nbut both hurried circuitously away from the advances I made\nthem.  Near Roehampton I had seen two human skeletons--\nnot bodies, but skeletons, picked clean--and in the wood\nby me I found the crushed and scattered bones of several\ncats and rabbits and the skull of a sheep.  But though I\ngnawed parts of these in my mouth, there was nothing to\nbe got from them.",
        "After sunset I struggled on along the road towards Putney,\nwhere I think the Heat-Ray must have been used for some\nreason.  And in the garden beyond Roehampton I got a quan-\ntity of immature potatoes, sufficient to stay my hunger.  From\nthis garden one looked down upon Putney and the river.  The\naspect of the place in the dusk was singularly desolate:\nblackened trees, blackened, desolate ruins, and down the\nhill the sheets of the flooded river, red-tinged with the weed.\nAnd over all--silence.  It filled me with indescribable terror\nto think how swiftly that desolating change had come.",
        "For a time I believed that mankind had been swept out\nof existence, and that I stood there alone, the last man left\nalive.  Hard by the top of Putney Hill I came upon another\nskeleton, with the arms dislocated and removed several\nyards from the rest of the body.  As I proceeded I became\nmore and more convinced that the extermination of mankind\nwas, save for such stragglers as myself, already accomplished\nin this part of the world.  The Martians, I thought, had gone\non and left the country desolated, seeking food elsewhere.\nPerhaps even now they were destroying Berlin or Paris, or\nit might be they had gone northward.",
        "\n   I spent that night in the inn that stands at the top of\nPutney Hill, sleeping in a made bed for the first time since\nmy flight to Leatherhead.  I will not tell the needless trouble\nI had breaking into that house--afterwards I found the\nfront door was on the latch--nor how I ransacked every\nroom for food, until just on the verge of despair, in what\nseemed to me to be a servant’s bedroom, I found a rat-\ngnawed crust and two tins of pineapple.  The place had\nbeen already searched and emptied.  In the bar I afterwards\nfound some biscuits and sandwiches that had been over-\nlooked.  The latter I could not eat, they were too rotten, but\nthe former not only stayed my hunger, but filled my pockets.\nI lit no lamps, fearing some Martian might come beating\nthat part of London for food in the night.  Before I went to\nbed I had an interval of restlessness, and prowled from\nwindow to window, peering out for some sign of these\nmonsters.  I slept little.  As I lay in bed I found myself think-\ning consecutively--a thing I do not remember to have done\nsince my last argument with the curate.  During all the inter-\nvening time my mental condition had been a hurrying suc-\ncession of vague emotional states or a sort of stupid recep-\ntivity.  But in the night my brain, reinforced, I suppose, by\nthe food I had eaten, grew clear again, and I thought.",
        "Three things struggled for possession of my mind: the\nkilling of the curate, the whereabouts of the Martians, and\nthe possible fate of my wife.  The former gave me no sensa-\ntion of horror or remorse to recall; I saw it simply as a thing\ndone, a memory infinitely disagreeable but quite without the\nquality of remorse.  I saw myself then as I see myself now,\ndriven step by step towards that hasty blow, the creature of\na sequence of accidents leading inevitably to that.  I felt no\ncondemnation; yet the memory, static, unprogressive, haunted\nme.  In the silence of the night, with that sense of the near-\nness of God that sometimes comes into the stillness and the\ndarkness, I stood my trial, my only trial, for that moment of\nwrath and fear.  I retraced every step of our conversation from\nthe moment when I had found him crouching beside me,\nheedless of my thirst, and pointing to the fire and smoke\nthat streamed up from the ruins of Weybridge.  We had been\nincapable of co-operation--grim chance had taken no heed\nof that.  Had I foreseen, I should have left him at Halliford.\nBut I did not foresee; and crime is to foresee and do.  And\nI set this down as I have set all this story down, as it was.\nThere were no witnesses--all these things I might have con-\ncealed.  But I set it down, and the reader must form his\njudgment as he will.",
        "And when, by an effort, I had set aside that picture of a\nprostrate body, I faced the problem of the Martians and the\nfate of my wife.  For the former I had no data; I could\nimagine a hundred things, and so, unhappily, I could for the\nlatter.  And suddenly that night became terrible.  I found\nmyself sitting up in bed, staring at the dark.  I found my-\nself praying that the Heat-Ray might have suddenly and\npainlessly struck her out of being.  Since the night of my\nreturn from Leatherhead I had not prayed.  I had uttered\nprayers, fetish prayers, had prayed as heathens mutter charms\nwhen I was in extremity; but now I prayed indeed, plead-\ning steadfastly and sanely, face to face with the darkness\nof God.  Strange night!  Strangest in this, that so soon as dawn\nhad come, I, who had talked with God, crept out of the house\nlike a rat leaving its hiding place--a creature scarcely larger,\nan inferior animal, a thing that for any passing whim of our\nmasters might be hunted and killed.  Perhaps they also\nprayed confidently to God.  Surely, if we have learned noth-\ning else, this war has taught us pity--pity for those witless\nsouls that suffer our dominion.",
        "The morning was bright and fine, and the eastern sky\nglowed pink, and was fretted with little golden clouds.  In\nthe road that runs from the top of Putney Hill to Wimbledon\nwas a number of poor vestiges of the panic torrent that must\nhave poured Londonward on the Sunday night after the\nfighting began.  There was a little two-wheeled cart inscribed\nwith the name of Thomas Lobb, Greengrocer, New Malden,\nwith a smashed wheel and an abandoned tin trunk; there\nwas a straw hat trampled into the now hardened mud, and\nat the top of West Hill a lot of blood-stained glass about the\noverturned water trough.  My movements were languid, my\nplans of the vaguest.  I had an idea of going to Leatherhead,\nthough I knew that there I had the poorest chance of finding\nmy wife.  Certainly, unless death had overtaken them sud-\ndenly, my cousins and she would have fled thence; but it\nseemed to me I might find or learn there whither the Surrey\npeople had fled.  I knew I wanted to find my wife, that my\nheart ached for her and the world of men, but I had no\nclear idea how the finding might be done.  I was also sharply\naware now of my intense loneliness.  From the corner I went,\nunder cover of a thicket of trees and bushes, to the edge of\nWimbledon Common, stretching wide and far.",
        "That dark expanse was lit in patches by yellow gorse and\nbroom; there was no red weed to be seen, and as I prowled,\nhesitating, on the verge of the open, the sun rose, flooding\nit all with light and vitality.  I came upon a busy swarm of\nlittle frogs in a swampy place among the trees.  I stopped\nto look at them, drawing a lesson from their stout resolve\nto live.  And presently, turning suddenly, with an odd\nfeeling of being watched, I beheld something crouching\namid a clump of bushes.  I stood regarding this.  I made a\nstep towards it, and it rose up and became a man armed\nwith a cutlass.  I approached him slowly.  He stood silent and\nmotionless, regarding me.",
        "As I drew nearer I perceived he was dressed in clothes\nas dusty and filthy as my own; he looked, indeed, as though\nhe had been dragged through a culvert.  Nearer, I distin-\nguished the green slime of ditches mixing with the pale drab\nof dried clay and shiny, coaly patches.  His black hair fell over\nhis eyes, and his face was dark and dirty and sunken, so\nthat at first I did not recognise him.  There was a red cut\nacross the lower part of his face.",
        "“Stop!” he cried, when I was within ten yards of him, and\nI stopped.  His voice was hoarse.  “Where do you come from?\"\nhe said.",
        "I thought, surveying him.",
        "“I come from Mortlake,” I said.  “I was buried near the\npit the Martians made about their cylinder.  I have worked\nmy way out and escaped.”",
        "“There is no food about here,” he said.  “This is my coun-\ntry.  All this hill down to the river, and back to Clapham,\nand up to the edge of the common.  There is only food for one.\nWhich way are you going?”",
        "I answered slowly.",
        "“I don’t know,” I said.  “I have been buried in the ruins\nof a house thirteen or fourteen days.  I don’t know what has\nhappened.”",
        "He looked at me doubtfully, then started, and looked with\na changed expression.",
        "“I’ve no wish to stop about here,” said I.  “I think I shall\ngo to Leatherhead, for my wife was there.”",
        "He shot out a pointing finger.",
        "“It is you,” said he; “the man from Woking.  And you\nweren’t killed at Weybridge?”",
        "I recognised him at the same moment.",
        "“You are the artilleryman who came into my garden.”",
        "“Good luck!” he said.  “We are lucky ones!  Fancy YOU!”  He\nput out a hand, and I took it.  “I crawled up a drain,” he said.\n\"But they didn’t kill everyone.  And after they went away I\ngot off towards Walton across the fields.  But---- It’s not\nsixteen days altogether--and your hair is grey.”  He looked\nover his shoulder suddenly.  “Only a rook,” he said.  “One\ngets to know that birds have shadows these days.  This is a\nbit open.  Let us crawl under those bushes and talk.”",
        "“Have you seen any Martians?” I said.  “Since I crawled\nout----”",
        "“They’ve gone away across London,” he said.  “I guess\nthey’ve got a bigger camp there.  Of a night, all over there,\nHampstead way, the sky is alive with their lights.  It’s like\na great city, and in the glare you can just see them moving.\nBy daylight you can’t.  But nearer--I haven’t seen them--\"\n(he counted on his fingers) “five days.  Then I saw a couple\nacross Hammersmith way carrying something big.  And the\nnight before last\"--he stopped and spoke impressively--\"it\nwas just a matter of lights, but it was something up in the\nair.  I believe they’ve built a flying-machine, and are learn-\ning to fly.”",
        "I stopped, on hands and knees, for we had come to the\nbushes.",
        "“Fly!”",
        "“Yes,” he said, “fly.”",
        "I went on into a little bower, and sat down.",
        "“It is all over with humanity,” I said.  “If they can do that\nthey will simply go round the world.”",
        "He nodded.",
        "“They will.  But---- It will relieve things over here a bit.\nAnd besides----”  He looked at me.  “Aren’t you satisfied it IS\nup with humanity?  I am.  We’re down; we’re beat.”",
        "I stared.  Strange as it may seem, I had not arrived at this\nfact--a fact perfectly obvious so soon as he spoke.  I had\nstill held a vague hope; rather, I had kept a lifelong habit\nof mind.  He repeated his words, “We’re beat.”  They carried\nabsolute conviction.",
        "“It’s all over,” he said.  “They’ve lost ONE--just ONE.\nAnd they’ve made their footing good and crippled the greatest\npower in the world.  They’ve walked over us.  The death of\nthat one at Weybridge was an accident.  And these are only\npioneers.  They kept on coming.  These green stars--I’ve seen\nnone these five or six days, but I’ve no doubt they’re falling\nsomewhere every night.  Nothing’s to be done.  We’re under!\nWe’re beat!”",
        "I made him no answer.  I sat staring before me, trying in\nvain to devise some countervailing thought.",
        "“This isn’t a war,” said the artilleryman.  “It never was a\nwar, any more than there’s war between man and ants.”",
        "Suddenly I recalled the night in the observatory.",
        "“After the tenth shot they fired no more--at least, until\nthe first cylinder came.”",
        "“How do you know?” said the artilleryman.  I explained.\nHe thought.  “Something wrong with the gun,” he said.  “But\nwhat if there is?  They’ll get it right again.  And even if\nthere’s a delay, how can it alter the end?  It’s just men and\nants.  There’s the ants builds their cities, live their lives,\nhave wars, revolutions, until the men want them out of the way,\nand then they go out of the way.  That’s what we are now--just\nants.  Only----”",
        "“Yes,” I said.",
        "“We’re eatable ants.”",
        "We sat looking at each other.",
        "“And what will they do with us?” I said.",
        "“That’s what I’ve been thinking,” he said; “that’s what I’ve\nbeen thinking.  After Weybridge I went south--thinking.  I\nsaw what was up.  Most of the people were hard at it\nsquealing and exciting themselves.  But I’m not so fond of\nsquealing.  I’ve been in sight of death once or twice; I’m\nnot an ornamental soldier, and at the best and worst, death--\nit’s just death.  And it’s the man that keeps on thinking comes\nthrough.  I saw everyone tracking away south.  Says I, “Food\nwon’t last this way,” and I turned right back.  I went for\nthe Martians like a sparrow goes for man.  All round\"--he\nwaved a hand to the horizon--\"they’re starving in heaps,\nbolting, treading on each other. . . .”",
        "He saw my face, and halted awkwardly.",
        "“No doubt lots who had money have gone away to\nFrance,” he said.  He seemed to hesitate whether to apolo-\ngise, met my eyes, and went on: “There’s food all about here.\nCanned things in shops; wines, spirits, mineral waters; and\nthe water mains and drains are empty.  Well, I was telling\nyou what I was thinking.  “Here’s intelligent things,” I said,\n\"and it seems they want us for food.  First, they’ll smash us\nup--ships, machines, guns, cities, all the order and organisa-\ntion.  All that will go.  If we were the size of ants we might\npull through.  But we’re not.  It’s all too bulky to stop.\nThat’s the first certainty.”  Eh?”",
        "I assented.",
        "“It is; I’ve thought it out.  Very well, then--next; at\npresent we’re caught as we’re wanted.  A Martian has only to go\na few miles to get a crowd on the run.  And I saw one, one day,\nout by Wandsworth, picking houses to pieces and routing\namong the wreckage.  But they won’t keep on doing that.\nSo soon as they’ve settled all our guns and ships, and\nsmashed our railways, and done all the things they are\ndoing over there, they will begin catching us systematic, pick-\ning the best and storing us in cages and things.  That’s what\nthey will start doing in a bit.  Lord!  They haven’t begun on\nus yet.  Don’t you see that?”",
        "“Not begun!” I exclaimed.",
        "“Not begun.  All that’s happened so far is through our not\nhaving the sense to keep quiet--worrying them with guns\nand such foolery.  And losing our heads, and rushing off in\ncrowds to where there wasn’t any more safety than where\nwe were.  They don’t want to bother us yet.  They’re making\ntheir things--making all the things they couldn’t bring with\nthem, getting things ready for the rest of their people.  Very\nlikely that’s why the cylinders have stopped for a bit, for\nfear of hitting those who are here.  And instead of our rush-\ning about blind, on the howl, or getting dynamite on the\nchance of busting them up, we’ve got to fix ourselves up\naccording to the new state of affairs.  That’s how I figure it\nout.  It isn’t quite according to what a man wants for his\nspecies, but it’s about what the facts point to.  And that’s the\nprinciple I acted upon.  Cities, nations, civilisation,\nprogress--it’s all over.  That game’s up.  We’re beat.”",
        "“But if that is so, what is there to live for?”",
        "The artilleryman looked at me for a moment.",
        "“There won’t be any more blessed concerts for a million\nyears or so; there won’t be any Royal Academy of Arts, and\nno nice little feeds at restaurants.  If it’s amusement you’re\nafter, I reckon the game is up.  If you’ve got any drawing-\nroom manners or a dislike to eating peas with a knife or\ndropping aitches, you’d better chuck ’em away.  They ain’t\nno further use.”",
        "“You mean----”",
        "“I mean that men like me are going on living--for the\nsake of the breed.  I tell you, I’m grim set on living.  And if\nI’m not mistaken, you’ll show what insides YOU’VE got, too,\nbefore long.  We aren’t going to be exterminated.  And I don’t\nmean to be caught either, and tamed and fattened and bred\nlike a thundering ox.  Ugh! Fancy those brown creepers!”",
        "“You don’t mean to say----”",
        "“I do.  I’m going on, under their feet.  I’ve got it planned;\nI’ve thought it out.  We men are beat.  We don’t know\nenough.  We’ve got to learn before we’ve got a chance.  And\nwe’ve got to live and keep independent while we learn.  See!\nThat’s what has to be done.”",
        "I stared, astonished, and stirred profoundly by the man’s\nresolution.",
        "“Great God!,” cried I.  “But you are a man indeed!”  And\nsuddenly I gripped his hand.",
        "“Eh!” he said, with his eyes shining.  “I’ve thought it out,\neh?”",
        "“Go on,” I said.",
        "“Well, those who mean to escape their catching must get\nready.  I’m getting ready.  Mind you, it isn’t all of us that\nare made for wild beasts; and that’s what it’s got to be.\nThat’s why I watched you.  I had my doubts.  You’re slender.\nI didn’t know that it was you, you see, or just how you’d\nbeen buried.  All these--the sort of people that lived in\nthese houses, and all those damn little clerks that used to\nlive down that way--they’d be no good.  They haven’t any\nspirit in them--no proud dreams and no proud lusts; and a\nman who hasn’t one or the other--Lord!  What is he but\nfunk and precautions?  They just used to skedaddle off to\nwork--I’ve seen hundreds of ’em, bit of breakfast in hand,\nrunning wild and shining to catch their little season-ticket\ntrain, for fear they’d get dismissed if they didn’t; working\nat businesses they were afraid to take the trouble to under-\nstand; skedaddling back for fear they wouldn’t be in time\nfor dinner; keeping indoors after dinner for fear of the back\nstreets, and sleeping with the wives they married, not be-\ncause they wanted them, but because they had a bit of\nmoney that would make for safety in their one little mis-\nerable skedaddle through the world.  Lives insured and a\nbit invested for fear of accidents.  And on Sundays--fear of\nthe hereafter.  As if hell was built for rabbits!  Well, the Mar-\ntians will just be a godsend to these.  Nice roomy cages, fat-\ntening food, careful breeding, no worry.  After a week or so\nchasing about the fields and lands on empty stomachs, they’ll\ncome and be caught cheerful.  They’ll be quite glad after a\nbit.  They’ll wonder what people did before there were\nMartians to take care of them.  And the bar loafers, and\nmashers, and singers--I can imagine them.  I can imagine\nthem,” he said, with a sort of sombre gratification.  “There’ll\nbe any amount of sentiment and religion loose among them.\nThere’s hundreds of things I saw with my eyes that I’ve\nonly begun to see clearly these last few days.  There’s lots\nwill take things as they are--fat and stupid; and lots will\nbe worried by a sort of feeling that it’s all wrong, and that\nthey ought to be doing something.  Now whenever things are\nso that a lot of people feel they ought to be doing some-\nthing, the weak, and those who go weak with a lot of com-\nplicated thinking, always make for a sort of do-nothing\nreligion, very pious and superior, and submit to persecution\nand the will of the Lord.  Very likely you’ve seen the same\nthing.  It’s energy in a gale of funk, and turned clean inside\nout.  These cages will be full of psalms and hymns and piety.\nAnd those of a less simple sort will work in a bit of--what\nis it?--eroticism.”",
        "He paused.",
        "“Very likely these Martians will make pets of some of them;\ntrain them to do tricks--who knows?--get sentimental over\nthe pet boy who grew up and had to be killed.  And some,\nmaybe, they will train to hunt us.”",
        "“No,” I cried, “that’s impossible!  No human being----”",
        "“What’s the good of going on with such lies?” said the\nartilleryman.  “There’s men who’d do it cheerful.  What non-\nsense to pretend there isn’t!”",
        "And I succumbed to his conviction.",
        "“If they come after me,” he said; “Lord, if they come\nafter me!” and subsided into a grim meditation.",
        "I sat contemplating these things.  I could find nothing\nto bring against this man’s reasoning.  In the days before\nthe invasion no one would have questioned my intellectual\nsuperiority to his--I, a professed and recognised writer on\nphilosophical themes, and he, a common soldier; and yet\nhe had already formulated a situation that I had scarcely\nrealised.",
        "“What are you doing?” I said presently.  “What plans\nhave you made?”",
        "He hesitated.",
        "“Well, it’s like this,” he said.  “What have we to do?  We\nhave to invent a sort of life where men can live and breed,\nand be sufficiently secure to bring the children up.  Yes--wait\na bit, and I’ll make it clearer what I think ought to be done.\nThe tame ones will go like all tame beasts; in a few genera-\ntions they’ll be big, beautiful, rich-blooded, stupid--rubbish!\nThe risk is that we who keep wild will go savage--de-\ngenerate into a sort of big, savage rat. . . .  You see, how I\nmean to live is underground.  I’ve been thinking about the\ndrains.  Of course those who don’t know drains think horrible\nthings; but under this London are miles and miles--hundreds\nof miles--and a few days” rain and London empty will leave\nthem sweet and clean.  The main drains are big enough and\nairy enough for anyone.  Then there’s cellars, vaults, stores,\nfrom which bolting passages may be made to the drains.\nAnd the railway tunnels and subways.  Eh?  You begin to see?\nAnd we form a band--able-bodied, clean-minded men.  We’re\nnot going to pick up any rubbish that drifts in.  Weaklings\ngo out again.”",
        "“As you meant me to go?”",
        "“Well--l parleyed, didn’t I?”",
        "“We won’t quarrel about that.  Go on.”",
        "“Those who stop obey orders.  Able-bodied, clean-minded\nwomen we want also--mothers and teachers.  No lackadaisical\nladies--no blasted rolling eyes.  We can’t have any weak or\nsilly.  Life is real again, and the useless and cumbersome and\nmischievous have to die.  They ought to die.  They ought to\nbe willing to die.  It’s a sort of disloyalty, after all, to live\nand taint the race.  And they can’t be happy.  Moreover, dying’s\nnone so dreadful; it’s the funking makes it bad.  And in all\nthose places we shall gather.  Our district will be London.\nAnd we may even be able to keep a watch, and run about\nin the open when the Martians keep away.  Play cricket, per-\nhaps.  That’s how we shall save the race.  Eh?  It’s a possible\nthing?  But saving the race is nothing in itself.  As I say,\nthat’s only being rats.  It’s saving our knowledge and adding\nto it is the thing.  There men like you come in.  There’s books,\nthere’s models.  We must make great safe places down deep,\nand get all the books we can; not novels and poetry swipes,\nbut ideas, science books.  That’s where men like you come\nin.  We must go to the British Museum and pick all those\nbooks through.  Especially we must keep up our science--\nlearn more.  We must watch these Martians.  Some of us\nmust go as spies.  When it’s all working, perhaps I will.  Get\ncaught, I mean.  And the great thing is, we must leave the\nMartians alone.  We mustn’t even steal.  If we get in their\nway, we clear out.  We must show them we mean no harm.\nYes, I know.  But they’re intelligent things, and they won’t\nhunt us down if they have all they want, and think we’re\njust harmless vermin.”",
        "The artilleryman paused and laid a brown hand upon\nmy arm.",
        "“After all, it may not be so much we may have to learn\nbefore-- Just imagine this: four or five of their fighting\nmachines suddenly starting off--Heat-Rays right and left, and\nnot a Martian in ’em.  Not a Martian in ’em, but men--men\nwho have learned the way how.  It may be in my time, even--\nthose men.  Fancy having one of them lovely things, with its\nHeat-Ray wide and free!  Fancy having it in control!  What\nwould it matter if you smashed to smithereens at the end of\nthe run, after a bust like that?  I reckon the Martians’ll open\ntheir beautiful eyes!  Can’t you see them, man?  Can’t you see\nthem hurrying, hurrying--puffing and blowing and hooting to\ntheir other mechanical affairs?  Something out of gear in every\ncase.  And swish, bang, rattle, swish!  Just as they are fum-\nbling over it, SWISH comes the Heat-Ray, and, behold! man\nhas come back to his own.”",
        "For a while the imaginative daring of the artilleryman,\nand the tone of assurance and courage he assumed, com-\npletely dominated my mind.  I believed unhesitatingly both\nin his forecast of human destiny and in the practicability of\nhis astonishing scheme, and the reader who thinks me sus-\nceptible and foolish must contrast his position, reading\nsteadily with all his thoughts about his subject, and mine,\ncrouching fearfully in the bushes and listening, distracted\nby apprehension.  We talked in this manner through the early\nmorning time, and later crept out of the bushes, and, after\nscanning the sky for Martians, hurried precipitately to the\nhouse on Putney Hill where he had made his lair.  It was the\ncoal cellar of the place, and when I saw the work he had\nspent a week upon--it was a burrow scarcely ten yards\nlong, which he designed to reach to the main drain on\nPutney Hill--I had my first inkling of the gulf between his\ndreams and his powers.  Such a hole I could have dug in a\nday.  But I believed in him sufficiently to work with him all\nthat morning until past midday at his digging.  We had a\ngarden barrow and shot the earth we removed against the\nkitchen range.  We refreshed ourselves with a tin of mock-\nturtle soup and wine from the neighbouring pantry.  I\nfound a curious relief from the aching strangeness of the\nworld in this steady labour.  As we worked, I turned his\nproject over in my mind, and presently objections and\ndoubts began to arise; but I worked there all the morning,\nso glad was I to find myself with a purpose again.  After\nworking an hour I began to speculate on the distance one\nhad to go before the cloaca was reached, the chances we had\nof missing it altogether.  My immediate trouble was why\nwe should dig this long tunnel, when it was possible to get\ninto the drain at once down one of the manholes, and work\nback to the house.  It seemed to me, too, that the house was\ninconveniently chosen, and required a needless length of\ntunnel.  And just as I was beginning to face these things, the\nartilleryman stopped digging, and looked at me.",
        "“We’re working well,” he said.  He put down his spade.\n\"Let us knock off a bit” he said.  “I think it’s time we recon-\nnoitred from the roof of the house.”",
        "I was for going on, and after a little hesitation he resumed\nhis spade; and then suddenly I was struck by a thought.\nI stopped, and so did he at once.",
        "“Why were you walking about the common,” I said,\n\"instead of being here?”",
        "“Taking the air,” he said.  “I was coming back.  It’s safer\nby night.”",
        "“But the work?”",
        "“Oh, one can’t always work,” he said, and in a flash I saw\nthe man plain.  He hesitated, holding his spade.  “We ought\nto reconnoitre now,” he said, “because if any come near they\nmay hear the spades and drop upon us unawares.”",
        "I was no longer disposed to object.  We went together to\nthe roof and stood on a ladder peeping out of the roof door.\nNo Martians were to be seen, and we ventured out on the\ntiles, and slipped down under shelter of the parapet.",
        "From this position a shrubbery hid the greater portion of\nPutney, but we could see the river below, a bubbly mass\nof red weed, and the low parts of Lambeth flooded and red.\nThe red creeper swarmed up the trees about the old palace,\nand their branches stretched gaunt and dead, and set with\nshrivelled leaves, from amid its clusters.  It was strange how\nentirely dependent both these things were upon flowing\nwater for their propagation.  About us neither had gained a\nfooting; laburnums, pink mays, snowballs, and trees of arbor-\nvitae, rose out of laurels and hydrangeas, green and brilliant\ninto the sunlight.  Beyond Kensington dense smoke was rising,\nand that and a blue haze hid the northward hills.",
        "The artilleryman began to tell me of the sort of people\nwho still remained in London.",
        "“One night last week,” he said, “some fools got the electric\nlight in order, and there was all Regent Street and the Circus\nablaze, crowded with painted and ragged drunkards, men\nand women, dancing and shouting till dawn.  A man who was\nthere told me.  And as the day came they became aware of\na fighting-machine standing near by the Langham and look-\ning down at them.  Heaven knows how long he had been\nthere.  It must have given some of them a nasty turn.  He\ncame down the road towards them, and picked up nearly a\nhundred too drunk or frightened to run away.”",
        "Grotesque gleam of a time no history will ever fully\ndescribe!",
        "From that, in answer to my questions, he came round to\nhis grandiose plans again.  He grew enthusiastic.  He talked\nso eloquently of the possibility of capturing a fighting-\nmachine that I more than half believed in him again.  But\nnow that I was beginning to understand something of his\nquality, I could divine the stress he laid on doing nothing\nprecipitately.  And I noted that now there was no question\nthat he personally was to capture and fight the great machine.",
        "After a time we went down to the cellar.  Neither of us\nseemed disposed to resume digging, and when he suggested\na meal, I was nothing loath.  He became suddenly very\ngenerous, and when we had eaten he went away and returned\nwith some excellent cigars.  We lit these, and his optimism\nglowed.  He was inclined to regard my coming as a great\noccasion.",
        "“There’s some champagne in the cellar,” he said.",
        "“We can dig better on this Thames-side burgundy,” said I.",
        "“No,” said he; “I am host today.  Champagne!  Great God!\nWe’ve a heavy enough task before us!  Let us take a rest\nand gather strength while we may.  Look at these blistered\nhands!”",
        "And pursuant to this idea of a holiday, he insisted upon\nplaying cards after we had eaten.  He taught me euchre, and\nafter dividing London between us, I taking the northern side\nand he the southern, we played for parish points.  Grotesque\nand foolish as this will seem to the sober reader, it is abso-\nlutely true, and what is more remarkable, I found the card\ngame and several others we played extremely interesting.",
        "Strange mind of man! that, with our species upon the\nedge of extermination or appalling degradation, with no clear\nprospect before us but the chance of a horrible death, we\ncould sit following the chance of this painted pasteboard,\nand playing the “joker” with vivid delight.  Afterwards\nhe taught me poker, and I beat him at three tough chess\ngames.  When dark came we decided to take the risk, and lit\na lamp.",
        "After an interminable string of games, we supped, and the\nartilleryman finished the champagne.  We went on smoking\nthe cigars.  He was no longer the energetic regenerator of\nhis species I had encountered in the morning.  He was still\noptimistic, but it was a less kinetic, a more thoughtful\noptimism.  I remember he wound up with my health, proposed\nin a speech of small variety and considerable intermittence.\nI took a cigar, and went upstairs to look at the lights of\nwhich he had spoken that blazed so greenly along the\nHighgate hills.",
        "At first I stared unintelligently across the London valley.\nThe northern hills were shrouded in darkness; the fires near\nKensington glowed redly, and now and then an orange-red\ntongue of flame flashed up and vanished in the deep blue\nnight.  All the rest of London was black.  Then, nearer, I\nperceived a strange light, a pale, violet-purple fluorescent\nglow, quivering under the night breeze.  For a space I could\nnot understand it, and then I knew that it must be the red\nweed from which this faint irradiation proceeded.  With that\nrealisation my dormant sense of wonder, my sense of the\nproportion of things, awoke again.  I glanced from that to\nMars, red and clear, glowing high in the west, and then\ngazed long and earnestly at the darkness of Hampstead and\nHighgate.",
        "I remained a very long time upon the roof, wondering at\nthe grotesque changes of the day.  I recalled my mental states\nfrom the midnight prayer to the foolish card-playing.  I had a\nviolent revulsion of feeling.  I remember I flung away the\ncigar with a certain wasteful symbolism.  My folly came to\nme with glaring exaggeration.  I seemed a traitor to my wife\nand to my kind; I was filled with remorse.  I resolved to leave\nthis strange undisciplined dreamer of great things to his drink\nand gluttony, and to go on into London.  There, it seemed\nto me, I had the best chance of learning what the Martians\nand my fellowmen were doing.  I was still upon the roof when\nthe late moon rose.",
        "After I had parted from the artilleryman, I went down\nthe hill, and by the High Street across the bridge to Fulham.\nThe red weed was tumultuous at that time, and nearly\nchoked the bridge roadway; but its fronds were already\nwhitened in patches by the spreading disease that presently\nremoved it so swiftly.",
        "At the corner of the lane that runs to Putney Bridge\nstation I found a man lying.  He was as black as a sweep\nwith the black dust, alive, but helplessly and speechlessly\ndrunk.  I could get nothing from him but curses and furious\nlunges at my head.  I think I should have stayed by him but\nfor the brutal expression of his face.",
        "There was black dust along the roadway from the bridge\nonwards, and it grew thicker in Fulham.  The streets were\nhorribly quiet.  I got food--sour, hard, and mouldy, but quite\neatable--in a baker’s shop here.  Some way towards Walham\nGreen the streets became clear of powder, and I passed a\nwhite terrace of houses on fire; the noise of the burning was\nan absolute relief.  Going on towards Brompton, the streets\nwere quiet again.",
        "Here I came once more upon the black powder in the\nstreets and upon dead bodies.  I saw altogether about a dozen\nin the length of the Fulham Road.  They had been dead many\ndays, so that I hurried quickly past them.  The black powder\ncovered them over, and softened their outlines.  One or two\nhad been disturbed by dogs.",
        "Where there was no black powder, it was curiously like\na Sunday in the City, with the closed shops, the houses\nlocked up and the blinds drawn, the desertion, and the\nstillness.  In some places plunderers had been at work, but\nrarely at other than the provision and wine shops.  A jeweller’s\nwindow had been broken open in one place, but apparently\nthe thief had been disturbed, and a number of gold chains\nand a watch lay scattered on the pavement.  I did not trouble\nto touch them.  Farther on was a tattered woman in a heap\non a doorstep; the hand that hung over her knee was gashed\nand bled down her rusty brown dress, and a smashed magnum\nof champagne formed a pool across the pavement.  She seemed\nasleep, but she was dead.",
        "The farther I penetrated into London, the profounder grew\nthe stillness.  But it was not so much the stillness of death--\nit was the stillness of suspense, of expectation.  At any time\nthe destruction that had already singed the northwestern\nborders of the metropolis, and had annihilated Ealing and\nKilburn, might strike among these houses and leave them\nsmoking ruins.  It was a city condemned and derelict. . . .",
        "In South Kensington the streets were clear of dead and of\nblack powder.  It was near South Kensington that I first heard\nthe howling.  It crept almost imperceptibly upon my senses.\nIt was a sobbing alternation of two notes, “Ulla, ulla, ulla,\nulla,” keeping on perpetually.  When I passed streets that ran\nnorthward it grew in volume, and houses and buildings\nseemed to deaden and cut it off again.  It came in a full tide\ndown Exhibition Road.  I stopped, staring towards Kensington\nGardens, wondering at this strange, remote wailing.  It was as\nif that mighty desert of houses had found a voice for its fear\nand solitude.",
        "“Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” wailed that superhuman note--\ngreat waves of sound sweeping down the broad, sunlit road-\nway, between the tall buildings on each side.  I turned north-\nwards, marvelling, towards the iron gates of Hyde Park.  I had\nhalf a mind to break into the Natural History Museum and\nfind my way up to the summits of the towers, in order to see\nacross the park.  But I decided to keep to the ground, where\nquick hiding was possible, and so went on up the Exhibition\nRoad.  All the large mansions on each side of the road were\nempty and still, and my footsteps echoed against the sides\nof the houses.  At the top, near the park gate, I came upon\na strange sight--a bus overturned, and the skeleton of a\nhorse picked clean.  I puzzled over this for a time, and then\nwent on to the bridge over the Serpentine.  The voice grew\nstronger and stronger, though I could see nothing above the\nhousetops on the north side of the park, save a haze of smoke\nto the northwest.",
        "“Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” cried the voice, coming, as it\nseemed to me, from the district about Regent’s Park.  The\ndesolating cry worked upon my mind.  The mood that had\nsustained me passed.  The wailing took possession of me.  I\nfound I was intensely weary, footsore, and now again hungry\nand thirsty.",
        "It was already past noon.  Why was I wandering alone in\nthis city of the dead?  Why was I alone when all London was\nlying in state, and in its black shroud?  I felt intolerably\nlonely.  My mind ran on old friends that I had forgotten for\nyears.  I thought of the poisons in the chemists” shops, of the\nliquors the wine merchants stored; I recalled the two sodden\ncreatures of despair, who so far as I knew, shared the city\nwith myself. . . .",
        " I came into Oxford Street by the Marble Arch, and here\nagain were black powder and several bodies, and an evil,\nominous smell from the gratings of the cellars of some of the\nhouses.  I grew very thirsty after the heat of my long walk.\nWith infinite trouble I managed to break into a public-house\nand get food and drink.  I was weary after eating, and went\ninto the parlour behind the bar, and slept on a black horse-\nhair sofa I found there.",
        "I awoke to find that dismal howling still in my ears,\n\"Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla.”  It was now dusk, and after I had\nrouted out some biscuits and a cheese in the bar--there was\na meat safe, but it contained nothing but maggots--I wan-\ndered on through the silent residential squares to Baker Street\n--Portman Square is the only one I can name--and so came\nout at last upon Regent’s Park.  And as I emerged from the\ntop of Baker Street, I saw far away over the trees in the\nclearness of the sunset the hood of the Martian giant from\nwhich this howling proceeded.  I was not terrified.  I came\nupon him as if it were a matter of course.  I watched him for\nsome time, but he did not move.  He appeared to be standing\nand yelling, for no reason that I could discover.",
        "I tried to formulate a plan of action.  That perpetual sound\nof “Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” confused my mind.  Perhaps I was\ntoo tired to be very fearful.  Certainly I was more curious to\nknow the reason of this monotonous crying than afraid.  I\nturned back away from the park and struck into Park Road,\nintending to skirt the park, went along under the shelter of\nthe terraces, and got a view of this stationary, howling\nMartian from the direction of St. John’s Wood.  A couple of\nhundred yards out of Baker Street I heard a yelping chorus,\nand saw, first a dog with a piece of putrescent red meat in\nhis jaws coming headlong towards me, and then a pack of\nstarving mongrels in pursuit of him.  He made a wide curve\nto avoid me, as though he feared I might prove a fresh\ncompetitor.  As the yelping died away down the silent road,\nthe wailing sound of “Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” reasserted itself.",
        "I came upon the wrecked handling-machine halfway to\nSt. John’s Wood station.  At first I thought a house had fallen\nacross the road.  It was only as I clambered among the ruins\nthat I saw, with a start, this mechanical Samson lying, with\nits tentacles bent and smashed and twisted, among the ruins\nit had made.  The forepart was shattered.  It seemed as if it\nhad driven blindly straight at the house, and had been over-\nwhelmed in its overthrow.  It seemed to me then that this\nmight have happened by a handling-machine escaping from\nthe guidance of its Martian.  I could not clamber among the\nruins to see it, and the twilight was now so far advanced\nthat the blood with which its seat was smeared, and the\ngnawed gristle of the Martian that the dogs had left, were\ninvisible to me.",
        "Wondering still more at all that I had seen, I pushed on\ntowards Primrose Hill.  Far away, through a gap in the trees,\nI saw a second Martian, as motionless as the first, standing\nin the park towards the Zoological Gardens, and silent.  A\nlittle beyond the ruins about the smashed handling-machine\nI came upon the red weed again, and found the Regent’s\nCanal, a spongy mass of dark-red vegetation.",
        "As I crossed the bridge, the sound of “Ulla, ulla, ulla,\nulla,” ceased.  It was, as it were, cut off.  The silence came\nlike a thunderclap.",
        "The dusky houses about me stood faint and tall and dim;\nthe trees towards the park were growing black.  All about\nme the red weed clambered among the ruins, writhing to\nget above me in the dimness.  Night, the mother of fear and\nmystery, was coming upon me.  But while that voice sounded\nthe solitude, the desolation, had been endurable; by virtue\nof it London had still seemed alive, and the sense of life\nabout me had upheld me.  Then suddenly a change, the\npassing of something--I knew not what--and then a stillness\nthat could be felt.  Nothing but this gaunt quiet.",
        "London about me gazed at me spectrally.  The windows\nin the white houses were like the eye sockets of skulls.  About\nme my imagination found a thousand noiseless enemies\nmoving.  Terror seized me, a horror of my temerity.  In front\nof me the road became pitchy black as though it was tarred,\nand I saw a contorted shape lying across the pathway.  I\ncould not bring myself to go on.  I turned down St. John’s\nWood Road, and ran headlong from this unendurable stillness\ntowards Kilburn.  I hid from the night and the silence, until\nlong after midnight, in a cabmen’s shelter in Harrow Road.\nBut before the dawn my courage returned, and while the\nstars were still in the sky I turned once more towards\nRegent’s Park.  I missed my way among the streets, and\npresently saw down a long avenue, in the half-light of the\nearly dawn, the curve of Primrose Hill.  On the summit,\ntowering up to the fading stars, was a third Martian, erect\nand motionless like the others.",
        "An insane resolve possessed me.  I would die and end it.\nAnd I would save myself even the trouble of killing myself.\nI marched on recklessly towards this Titan, and then, as I\ndrew nearer and the light grew, I saw that a multitude of\nblack birds was circling and clustering about the hood.  At\nthat my heart gave a bound, and I began running along\nthe road.",
        "I hurried through the red weed that choked St. Edmund’s\nTerrace (I waded breast-high across a torrent of water that\nwas rushing down from the waterworks towards the Albert\nRoad), and emerged upon the grass before the rising of the\nsun.  Great mounds had been heaped about the crest of the\nhill, making a huge redoubt of it--it was the final and\nlargest place the Martians had made--and from behind\nthese heaps there rose a thin smoke against the sky.  Against\nthe sky line an eager dog ran and disappeared.  The thought\nthat had flashed into my mind grew real, grew credible.  I felt\nno fear, only a wild, trembling exultation, as I ran up the hill\ntowards the motionless monster.  Out of the hood hung\nlank shreds of brown, at which the hungry birds pecked and\ntore.",
        "In another moment I had scrambled up the earthen ram-\npart and stood upon its crest, and the interior of the redoubt\nwas below me.  A mighty space it was, with gigantic machines\nhere and there within it, huge mounds of material and strange\nshelter places.  And scattered about it, some in their over-\nturned war-machines, some in the now rigid handling-\nmachines, and a dozen of them stark and silent and laid in\na row, were the Martians--DEAD!--slain by the putrefactive\nand disease bacteria against which their systems were unpre-\npared; slain as the red weed was being slain; slain, after all\nman’s devices had failed, by the humblest things that God,\nin his wisdom, has put upon this earth.",
        "For so it had come about, as indeed I and many men\nmight have foreseen had not terror and disaster blinded our\nminds.  These germs of disease have taken toll of humanity\nsince the beginning of things--taken toll of our prehuman\nancestors since life began here.  But by virtue of this natural\nselection of our kind we have developed resisting power; to\nno germs do we succumb without a struggle, and to many--\nthose that cause putrefaction in dead matter, for instance\n--our living frames are altogether immune.  But there are no\nbacteria in Mars, and directly these invaders arrived, directly\nthey drank and fed, our microscopic allies began to work\ntheir overthrow.  Already when I watched them they were\nirrevocably doomed, dying and rotting even as they went to\nand fro.  It was inevitable.  By the toll of a billion deaths\nman has bought his birthright of the earth, and it is his against\nall comers; it would still be his were the Martians ten\ntimes as mighty as they are.  For neither do men live nor die in\nvain.",
        "Here and there they were scattered, nearly fifty altogether,\nin that great gulf they had made, overtaken by a death that\nmust have seemed to them as incomprehensible as any death\ncould be.  To me also at that time this death was incompre-\nhensible.  All I knew was that these things that had been alive\nand so terrible to men were dead.  For a moment I believed\nthat the destruction of Sennacherib had been repeated, that\nGod had repented, that the Angel of Death had slain them\nin the night.",
        "I stood staring into the pit, and my heart lightened glori-\nously, even as the rising sun struck the world to fire about\nme with his rays.  The pit was still in darkness; the mighty\nengines, so great and wonderful in their power and com-\nplexity, so unearthly in their tortuous forms, rose weird and\nvague and strange out of the shadows towards the light.  A\nmultitude of dogs, I could hear, fought over the bodies that\nlay darkly in the depth of the pit, far below me.  Across the\npit on its farther lip, flat and vast and strange, lay the great\nflying-machine with which they had been experimenting\nupon our denser atmosphere when decay and death arrested\nthem.  Death had come not a day too soon.  At the sound of\na cawing overhead I looked up at the huge fighting-machine\nthat would fight no more for ever, at the tattered red shreds\nof flesh that dripped down upon the overturned seats on the\nsummit of Primrose Hill.",
        "I turned and looked down the slope of the hill to where,\nenhaloed now in birds, stood those other two Martians that\nI had seen overnight, just as death had overtaken them.  The\none had died, even as it had been crying to its companions;\nperhaps it was the last to die, and its voice had gone on\nperpetually until the force of its machinery was exhausted.\nThey glittered now, harmless tripod towers of shining metal,\nin the brightness of the rising sun.",
        "All about the pit, and saved as by a miracle from ever-\nlasting destruction, stretched the great Mother of Cities.\nThose who have only seen London veiled in her sombre robes\nof smoke can scarcely imagine the naked clearness and beauty\nof the silent wilderness of houses.",
        "Eastward, over the blackened ruins of the Albert Terrace\nand the splintered spire of the church, the sun blazed daz-\nzling in a clear sky, and here and there some facet in the\ngreat wilderness of roofs caught the light and glared with\na white intensity.",
        "Northward were Kilburn and Hampsted, blue and crowded\nwith houses; westward the great city was dimmed; and\nsouthward, beyond the Martians, the green waves of Regent’s\nPark, the Langham Hotel, the dome of the Albert Hall, the\nImperial Institute, and the giant mansions of the Brompton\nRoad came out clear and little in the sunrise, the jagged\nruins of Westminster rising hazily beyond.  Far away\nand blue were the Surrey hills, and the towers of the\nCrystal Palace glittered like two silver rods.  The dome of\nSt. Paul’s was dark against the sunrise, and injured, I saw for\nthe first time, by a huge gaping cavity on its western\nside.",
        "And as I looked at this wide expanse of houses and fac-\ntories and churches, silent and abandoned; as I thought of\nthe multitudinous hopes and efforts, the innumerable hosts\nof lives that had gone to build this human reef, and of the\nswift and ruthless destruction that had hung over it all; when\nI realised that the shadow had been rolled back, and that\nmen might still live in the streets, and this dear vast dead\ncity of mine be once more alive and powerful, I felt a wave\nof emotion that was near akin to tears.",
        "The torment was over.  Even that day the healing would\nbegin.  The survivors of the people scattered over the coun-\ntry--leaderless, lawless, foodless, like sheep without a shep-\nherd--the thousands who had fled by sea, would begin to\nreturn; the pulse of life, growing stronger and stronger,\nwould beat again in the empty streets and pour across the\nvacant squares.  Whatever destruction was done, the hand\nof the destroyer was stayed.  All the gaunt wrecks, the black-\nened skeletons of houses that stared so dismally at the sunlit\ngrass of the hill, would presently be echoing with the ham-\nmers of the restorers and ringing with the tapping of their\ntrowels.  At the thought I extended my hands towards the\nsky and began thanking God.  In a year, thought I--in a\nyear. . .",
        "With overwhelming force came the thought of myself,\nof my wife, and the old life of hope and tender helpfulness\nthat had ceased for ever.",
        "And now comes the strangest thing in my story.  Yet,\nperhaps, it is not altogether strange.  I remember, clearly and\ncoldly and vividly, all that I did that day until the time that\nI stood weeping and praising God upon the summit of Prim-\nrose Hill.  And then I forget.",
        "Of the next three days I know nothing.  I have learned\nsince that, so far from my being the first discoverer of the\nMartian overthrow, several such wanderers as myself had\nalready discovered this on the previous night.  One man--\nthe first--had gone to St. Martin’s-le-Grand, and, while I\nsheltered in the cabmen’s hut, had contrived to telegraph to\nParis.  Thence the joyful news had flashed all over the world;\na thousand cities, chilled by ghastly apprehensions, sud-\ndenly flashed into frantic illuminations; they knew of it in\nDublin, Edinburgh, Manchester, Birmingham, at the time\nwhen I stood upon the verge of the pit.  Already men, weep-\ning with joy, as I have heard, shouting and staying their\nwork to shake hands and shout, were making up trains, even\nas near as Crewe, to descend upon London.  The church bells\nthat had ceased a fortnight since suddenly caught the news,\nuntil all England was bell-ringing.  Men on cycles, lean-faced,\nunkempt, scorched along every country lane shouting of\nunhoped deliverance, shouting to gaunt, staring figures of\ndespair.  And for the food!  Across the Channel, across the\nIrish Sea, across the Atlantic, corn, bread, and meat were\ntearing to our relief.  All the shipping in the world seemed\ngoing Londonward in those days.  But of all this I have no\nmemory.  I drifted--a demented man.  I found myself in a\nhouse of kindly people, who had found me on the third day\nwandering, weeping, and raving through the streets of St.\nJohn’s Wood.  They have told me since that I was singing\nsome insane doggerel about “The Last Man Left Alive!\nHurrah!  The Last Man Left Alive!”  Troubled as they were\nwith their own affairs, these people, whose name, much as\nI would like to express my gratitude to them, I may not\neven give here, nevertheless cumbered themselves with me,\nsheltered me, and protected me from myself.  Apparently they\nhad learned something of my story from me during the days\nof my lapse.",
        "Very gently, when my mind was assured again, did they\nbreak to me what they had learned of the fate of Leather-\nhead.  Two days after I was imprisoned it had been destroyed,\nwith every soul in it, by a Martian.  He had swept it out\nof existence, as it seemed, without any provocation, as a boy\nmight crush an ant hill, in the mere wantonness of power.",
        "I was a lonely man, and they were very kind to me.  I\nwas a lonely man and a sad one, and they bore with me.  I\nremained with them four days after my recovery.  All that\ntime I felt a vague, a growing craving to look once more\non whatever remained of the little life that seemed so happy\nand bright in my past.  It was a mere hopeless desire to feast\nupon my misery.  They dissuaded me.  They did all they\ncould to divert me from this morbidity.  But at last I could\nresist the impulse no longer, and, promising faithfully to\nreturn to them, and parting, as I will confess, from these\nfour-day friends with tears, I went out again into the streets\nthat had lately been so dark and strange and empty.",
        "Already they were busy with returning people; in places\neven there were shops open, and I saw a drinking fountain\nrunning water.",
        "I remember how mockingly bright the day seemed as I\nwent back on my melancholy pilgrimage to the little house\nat Woking, how busy the streets and vivid the moving life\nabout me.  So many people were abroad everywhere, busied\nin a thousand activities, that it seemed incredible that any\ngreat proportion of the population could have been slain.\nBut then I noticed how yellow were the skins of the people\nI met, how shaggy the hair of the men, how large and bright\ntheir eyes, and that every other man still wore his dirty\nrags.  Their faces seemed all with one of two expressions--a\nleaping exultation and energy or a grim resolution.  Save\nfor the expression of the faces, London seemed a city of\ntramps.  The vestries were indiscriminately distributing bread\nsent us by the French government.  The ribs of the few horses\nshowed dismally.  Haggard special constables with white\nbadges stood at the corners of every street.  I saw little of\nthe mischief wrought by the Martians until I reached Welling-\nton Street, and there I saw the red weed clambering over\nthe buttresses of Waterloo Bridge.",
        "At the corner of the bridge, too, I saw one of the common\ncontrasts of that grotesque time--a sheet of paper flaunting\nagainst a thicket of the red weed, transfixed by a stick that\nkept it in place.  It was the placard of the first newspaper\nto resume publication--the DAILY MAIL.  I bought a copy\nfor a blackened shilling I found in my pocket.  Most of it\nwas in blank, but the solitary compositor who did the thing\nhad amused himself by making a grotesque scheme of ad-\nvertisement stereo on the back page.  The matter he printed\nwas emotional; the news organisation had not as yet found\nits way back.  I learned nothing fresh except that already\nin one week the examination of the Martian mechanisms had\nyielded astonishing results.  Among other things, the article\nassured me what I did not believe at the time, that the\n\"Secret of Flying,” was discovered.  At Waterloo I found the\nfree trains that were taking people to their homes.  The first\nrush was already over.  There were few people in the train,\nand I was in no mood for casual conversation.  I got a com-\npartment to myself, and sat with folded arms, looking greyly\nat the sunlit devastation that flowed past the windows.  And\njust outside the terminus the train jolted over temporary\nrails, and on either side of the railway the houses were\nblackened ruins.  To Clapham Junction the face of London\nwas grimy with powder of the Black Smoke, in spite of\ntwo days of thunderstorms and rain, and at Clapham Junc-\ntion the line had been wrecked again; there were hundreds\nof out-of-work clerks and shopmen working side by side\nwith the customary navvies, and we were jolted over a hasty\nrelaying.",
        "All down the line from there the aspect of the country\nwas gaunt and unfamiliar; Wimbledon particularly had suf-\nfered.  Walton, by virtue of its unburned pine woods, seemed\nthe least hurt of any place along the line.  The Wandle, the\nMole, every little stream, was a heaped mass of red weed,\nin appearance between butcher’s meat and pickled cabbage.\nThe Surrey pine woods were too dry, however, for the festoons\nof the red climber.  Beyond Wimbledon, within sight of the\nline, in certain nursery grounds, were the heaped masses\nof earth about the sixth cylinder.  A number of people were\nstanding about it, and some sappers were busy in the midst\nof it.  Over it flaunted a Union Jack, flapping cheerfully in\nthe morning breeze.  The nursery grounds were everywhere\ncrimson with the weed, a wide expanse of livid colour cut\nwith purple shadows, and very painful to the eye.  One’s\ngaze went with infinite relief from the scorched greys and\nsullen reds of the foreground to the blue-green softness of\nthe eastward hills.",
        "The line on the London side of Woking station was still\nundergoing repair, so I descended at Byfleet station and\ntook the road to Maybury, past the place where I and the\nartilleryman had talked to the hussars, and on by the spot\nwhere the Martian had appeared to me in the thunderstorm.\nHere, moved by curiosity, I turned aside to find, among a\ntangle of red fronds, the warped and broken dog cart with\nthe whitened bones of the horse scattered and gnawed.  For\na time I stood regarding these vestiges. . . .",
        "Then I returned through the pine wood, neck-high with\nred weed here and there, to find the landlord of the Spotted\nDog had already found burial, and so came home past the\nCollege Arms.  A man standing at an open cottage door\ngreeted me by name as I passed.",
        "I looked at my house with a quick flash of hope that\nfaded immediately.  The door had been forced; it was unfast\nand was opening slowly as I approached.",
        "It slammed again.  The curtains of my study fluttered\nout of the open window from which I and the artilleryman\nhad watched the dawn.  No one had closed it since.  The\nsmashed bushes were just as I had left them nearly four\nweeks ago.  I stumbled into the hall, and the house felt\nempty.  The stair carpet was ruffled and discoloured where\nI had crouched, soaked to the skin from the thunderstorm\nthe night of the catastrophe.  Our muddy footsteps I saw still\nwent up the stairs.",
        "I followed them to my study, and found lying on my\nwriting-table still, with the selenite paper weight upon it,\nthe sheet of work I had left on the afternoon of the opening\nof the cylinder.  For a space I stood reading over my aban-\ndoned arguments.  It was a paper on the probable develop-\nment of Moral Ideas with the development of the civilising\nprocess; and the last sentence was the opening of a prophecy:\n\"In about two hundred years,” I had written, “we may\nexpect----”  The sentence ended abruptly.  I remembered\nmy inability to fix my mind that morning, scarcely a month\ngone by, and how I had broken off to get my DAILY CHRONICLE\nfrom the newsboy.  I remembered how I went down to the\ngarden gate as he came along, and how I had listened to his\nodd story of “Men from Mars.”",
        "I came down and went into the dining room.  There\nwere the mutton and the bread, both far gone now in decay,\nand a beer bottle overturned, just as I and the artilleryman\nhad left them.  My home was desolate.  I perceived the folly\nof the faint hope I had cherished so long.  And then a strange\nthing occurred.  “It is no use,” said a voice.  “The house is\ndeserted.  No one has been here these ten days.  Do not stay\nhere to torment yourself.  No one escaped but you.”",
        "I was startled.  Had I spoken my thought aloud?  I turned,\nand the French window was open behind me.  I made a\nstep to it, and stood looking out.",
        "And there, amazed and afraid, even as I stood amazed\nand afraid, were my cousin and my wife--my wife white\nand tearless.  She gave a faint cry.",
        "“I came,” she said.  “I knew--knew----”",
        "She put her hand to her throat--swayed.  I made a step\nforward, and caught her in my arms.",
        "I cannot but regret, now that I am concluding my story,\nhow little I am able to contribute to the discussion of the\nmany debatable questions which are still unsettled.  In one\nrespect I shall certainly provoke criticism.  My particular\nprovince is speculative philosophy.  My knowledge of com-\nparative physiology is confined to a book or two, but it\nseems to me that Carver’s suggestions as to the reason of\nthe rapid death of the Martians is so probable as to be\nregarded almost as a proven conclusion.  I have assumed\nthat in the body of my narrative.",
        "At any rate, in all the bodies of the Martians that were\nexamined after the war, no bacteria except those already\nknown as terrestrial species were found.  That they did not\nbury any of their dead, and the reckless slaughter they per-\npetrated, point also to an entire ignorance of the putrefactive\nprocess.  But probable as this seems, it is by no means a\nproven conclusion.",
        "Neither is the composition of the Black Smoke known,\nwhich the Martians used with such deadly effect, and the\ngenerator of the Heat-Rays remains a puzzle.  The terrible\ndisasters at the Ealing and South Kensington laboratories\nhave disinclined analysts for further investigations upon\nthe latter.  Spectrum analysis of the black powder points\nunmistakably to the presence of an unknown element with\na brilliant group of three lines in the green, and it is pos-\nsible that it combines with argon to form a compound\nwhich acts at once with deadly effect upon some constituent\nin the blood.  But such unproven speculations will scarcely\nbe of interest to the general reader, to whom this story is\naddressed.  None of the brown scum that drifted down the\nThames after the destruction of Shepperton was examined\nat the time, and now none is forthcoming.",
        " The results of an anatomical examination of the Martians,\nso far as the prowling dogs had left such an examination\npossible, I have already given.  But everyone is familiar with\nthe magnificent and almost complete specimen in spirits at\nthe Natural History Museum, and the countless drawings\nthat have been made from it; and beyond that the interest\nof their physiology and structure is purely scientific.",
        "A question of graver and universal interest is the possi-\nbility of another attack from the Martians.  I do not think\nthat nearly enough attention is being given to this aspect\nof the matter.  At present the planet Mars is in conjunction,\nbut with every return to opposition I, for one, anticipate\na renewal of their adventure.  In any case, we should be\nprepared.  It seems to me that it should be possible to define\nthe position of the gun from which the shots are discharged,\nto keep a sustained watch upon this part of the planet, and\nto anticipate the arrival of the next attack.",
        "In that case the cylinder might be destroyed with dyna-\nmite or artillery before it was sufficiently cool for the Mar-\ntians to emerge, or they might be butchered by means of\nguns so soon as the screw opened.  It seems to me that they\nhave lost a vast advantage in the failure of their first\nsurprise.  Possibly they see it in the same light.",
        "Lessing has advanced excellent reasons for supposing that\nthe Martians have actually succeeded in effecting a landing\non the planet Venus.  Seven months ago now, Venus and\nMars were in alignment with the sun; that is to say, Mars\nwas in opposition from the point of view of an observer on\nVenus.  Subsequently a peculiar luminous and sinuous mark-\ning appeared on the unillumined half of the inner planet,\nand almost simultaneously a faint dark mark of a similar\nsinuous character was detected upon a photograph of the\nMartian disk.  One needs to see the drawings of these ap-\npearances in order to appreciate fully their remarkable\nresemblance in character.",
        "At any rate, whether we expect another invasion or not,\nour views of the human future must be greatly modified\nby these events.  We have learned now that we cannot regard\nthis planet as being fenced in and a secure abiding place for\nMan; we can never anticipate the unseen good or evil that\nmay come upon us suddenly out of space.  It may be that in\nthe larger design of the universe this invasion from Mars\nis not without its ultimate benefit for men; it has robbed\nus of that serene confidence in the future which is the most\nfruitful source of decadence, the gifts to human science it\nhas brought are enormous, and it has done much to promote\nthe conception of the commonweal of mankind.  It may be\nthat across the immensity of space the Martians have watched\nthe fate of these pioneers of theirs and learned their lesson,\nand that on the planet Venus they have found a securer\nsettlement.  Be that as it may, for many years yet there will\ncertainly be no relaxation of the eager scrutiny of the Martian\ndisk, and those fiery darts of the sky, the shooting stars, will\nbring with them as they fall an unavoidable apprehension to\nall the sons of men.",
        "The broadening of men’s views that has resulted can\nscarcely be exaggerated.  Before the cylinder fell there was\na general persuasion that through all the deep of space no\nlife existed beyond the petty surface of our minute sphere.\nNow we see further.  If the Martians can reach Venus, there\nis no reason to suppose that the thing is impossible for men,\nand when the slow cooling of the sun makes this earth\nuninhabitable, as at last it must do, it may be that the thread\nof life that has begun here will have streamed out and caught\nour sister planet within its toils.",
        "Dim and wonderful is the vision I have conjured up in\nmy mind of life spreading slowly from this little seed bed\nof the solar system throughout the inanimate vastness of\nsidereal space.  But that is a remote dream.  It may be, on\nthe other hand, that the destruction of the Martians is only\na reprieve.  To them, and not to us, perhaps, is the future\nordained.",
        "I must confess the stress and danger of the time have left\nan abiding sense of doubt and insecurity in my mind.  I sit\nin my study writing by lamplight, and suddenly I see again\nthe healing valley below set with writhing flames, and feel\nthe house behind and about me empty and desolate.  I go\nout into the Byfleet Road, and vehicles pass me, a butcher\nboy in a cart, a cabful of visitors, a workman on a bicycle,\nchildren going to school, and suddenly they become vague\nand unreal, and I hurry again with the artilleryman through\nthe hot, brooding silence.  Of a night I see the black powder\ndarkening the silent streets, and the contorted bodies\nshrouded in that layer; they rise upon me tattered and\ndog-bitten.  They gibber and grow fiercer, paler, uglier, mad\ndistortions of humanity at last, and I wake, cold and wretched,\nin the darkness of the night.",
        "I go to London and see the busy multitudes in Fleet\nStreet and the Strand, and it comes across my mind that\nthey are but the ghosts of the past, haunting the streets that\nI have seen silent and wretched, going to and fro, phan-\ntasms in a dead city, the mockery of life in a galvanised\nbody.  And strange, too, it is to stand on Primrose Hill, as\nI did but a day before writing this last chapter, to see the\ngreat province of houses, dim and blue through the haze\nof the smoke and mist, vanishing at last into the vague\nlower sky, to see the people walking to and fro among the\nflower beds on the hill, to see the sight-seers about the Mar-\ntian machine that stands there still, to hear the tumult of\nplaying children, and to recall the time when I saw it all\nbright and clear-cut, hard and silent, under the dawn of\nthat last great day. . . .",
        "And strangest of all is it to hold my wife’s hand again,\nand to think that I have counted her, and that she has\ncounted me, among the dead.",
