        "Those who have the pleasure of attending the opening meetings of schools\nand colleges, and of giving away prizes and certificates, are generally\nexpected at the same time to offer such words of counsel and encouragement\nas the experience of the world might enable them to give to those who are\nentering life.",
        "Having been myself when young rather prone to suffer from low spirits, I\nhave at several of these gatherings taken the opportunity of dwelling on\nthe privileges and blessings we enjoy, and I reprint here the substance of\nsome of these addresses (omitting what was special to the circumstances of\neach case, and freely making any alterations and additions which have\nsince occurred to me), hoping that the thoughts and quotations in which I\nhave myself found most comfort may perhaps be of use to others also.",
        "It is hardly necessary to say that I have not by any means referred to all\nthe sources of happiness open to us, some indeed of the greatest pleasures\nand blessings being altogether omitted.",
        "In reading over the proofs I feel that some sentences may appear too\ndogmatic, but I hope that allowance will be made for the circumstances\nunder which they were delivered.",
        "HIGH ELMS,\nDOWN, KENT, January 1887.",
        "A lecture which I delivered three years ago at the Working Men’s College,\nand which forms the fourth chapter of this book, has given rise to a good\ndeal of discussion. The Pall Mall Gazette took up the subject and issued\na circular to many of those best qualified to express an opinion. This\nelicited many interesting replies, and some other lists of books were\ndrawn up. When my book was translated, a similar discussion took place in\nGermany. The result has been very gratifying, and after carefully\nconsidering the suggestions which have been made, I see no reason for any\nmaterial change in the first list. I had not presumed to form a list of my\nown, nor did I profess to give my own favorites. My attempt was to give\nthose most generally recommended by previous writers on the subject. In\nthe various criticisms on my list, while large additions, amounting to\nseveral hundred works in all, have been proposed, very few omissions have\nbeen suggested. As regards those works with reference to which some doubts\nhave been expressed–namely, the few Oriental books, Wake’s Apostolic\nFathers etc.–I may observe that I drew up the list, not as that of the\nhundred best books, but, which is very different, of those which have been\nmost frequently recommended as best worth reading.",
        "For instance as regards the Sheking and the Analects of Confucius, I\nmust humbly confess that I do not greatly admire either; but I recommended\nthem because they are held in the most profound veneration by the Chinese\nrace, containing 400,000,000 of our fellow-men. I may add that both works\nare quite short.",
        "The Ramayana and Maha Bharata (as epitomized by Wheeler) and St.\nHilaire’s Bouddha are not only very interesting in themselves, but very\nimportant in reference to our great oriental Empire.",
        "The authentic writings of the Apostolic Fathers are very short, being\nindeed comprised in one small volume, and as the only works (which have\ncome down to us) of those who lived with and knew the Apostles, they are\ncertainly well worth reading.",
        "I have been surprised at the great divergence of opinion which has been\nexpressed. Nine lists of some length have been published. These lists\ncontain some three hundred works not mentioned by me (without, however,\nany corresponding omissions), and yet there is not one single book which\noccurs in every list, or even in half of them, and only about half a dozen\nwhich appear in more than one of the nine.",
        "If these authorities, or even a majority of them, had concurred in their\nrecommendations, I would have availed myself of them; but as they differ\nso greatly I will allow my list to remain almost as I first proposed it. I\nhave, however, added Kalidasa’s Sakuntala or The Lost Ring, and\nSchiller’s William Tell, omitting, in consequence, Lucretius and Miss\nAusten: Lucretius because though his work is most remarkable, it is\nperhaps less generally suitable than most of the others in the list; and\nMiss Austen because English novelists were somewhat over-represented.",

        "    “All places that the eye of Heaven visits\n    Are to the wise man ports and happy havens.”",
        "    SHAKESPEARE.",
        "    “Some murmur, when their sky is clear\n      And wholly bright to view,\n    If one small speck of dark appear\n      In their great heaven of blue.\n    And some with thankful love are fill’d\n      If but one streak of light,\n    One ray of God’s good mercy gild\n      The darkness of their night.\n\n    “In palaces are hearts that ask,\n      In discontent and pride,\n    Why life is such a dreary task,\n      And all good things denied.\n    And hearts in poorest huts admire\n      How love has in their aid\n    (Love that not ever seems to tire)\n      Such rich provision made.”",
        "    TRENCH.",
        "    “If a man is unhappy, this must be his own fault; for\n    God made all men to be happy.\"–EPICTETUS.",
        "Life is a great gift, and as we reach years of discretion, we most of us\nnaturally ask ourselves what should be the main object of our existence.\nEven those who do not accept “the greatest good of the greatest number” as\nan absolute rule, will yet admit that we should all endeavor to contribute\nas far as we may to the happiness of our fellow-creatures. There are many,\nhowever, who seem to doubt whether it is right that we should try to be\nhappy ourselves. Our own happiness ought not, of course, to be our main\nobject, nor indeed will it ever be secured if selfishly sought. We may\nhave many pleasures in life, but must not let them have rule over us, or\nthey will soon hand us over to sorrow; and “into what dangerous and\nmiserable servitude doth he fall who suffereth pleasures and sorrows (two\nunfaithful and cruel commanders) to possess him successively?” [1]",
        "I cannot, however, but think that the world would be better and brighter\nif our teachers would dwell on the Duty of Happiness as well as on the\nHappiness of Duty, for we ought to be as cheerful as we can, if only\nbecause to be happy ourselves, is a most effectual contribution to the\nhappiness of others.",
        "Every one must have felt that a cheerful friend is like a sunny day, which\nsheds its brightness on all around; and most of us can, as we choose, make\nof this world either a palace or a prison.",
        "There is no doubt some selfish satisfaction in yielding to melancholy, and\nfancying that we are victims of fate; in brooding over grievances,\nespecially if more or less imaginary. To be bright and cheerful often\nrequires an effort; there is a certain art in keeping ourselves happy; and\nin this respect, as in others, we require to watch over and manage\nourselves, almost as if we were somebody else.",
        "Sorrow and joy, indeed, are strangely interwoven. Too often",
        "    “We look before and after,\n      And pine for what is not:\n    Our sincerest laughter\n      With some pain is fraught;\n  Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.” [2]",
        "As a nation we are prone to melancholy. It has been said of our countrymen\nthat they take even their pleasures sadly. But this, if it be true at all,\nwill, I hope, prove a transitory characteristic. “Merry England” was the\nold saying, let us hope it may become true again. We must look to the East\nfor real melancholy. What can be sadder than the lines with which Omar\nKhayyam opens his quatrains: [3]",
        "  “We sojourn here for one short day or two,\n  And all the gain we get is grief and woe;\n  And then, leaving life’s problems all unsolved\n  And harassed by regrets, we have to go;”",
        "or the Devas’ song to Prince Siddartha, in Edwin Arnold’s beautiful\nversion:",
        "  “We are the voices of the wandering wind,\n  Which moan for rest, and rest can never find.\n  Lo! as the wind is, so is mortal life–\n  A moan, a sigh, a sob, a storm, a strife.”",
        "If indeed this be true, if mortal life be so sad and full of suffering, no\nwonder that Nirvana–the cessation of sorrow–should be welcomed even at\nthe sacrifice of consciousness.",
        "But ought we not to place before ourselves a very different ideal–a\nhealthier, manlier, and nobler hope?",
        "Life is not to live merely, but to live well. There are some “who live\nwithout any design at all, and only pass in the world like straws on a\nriver: they do not go; they are carried,” [4]–but as Homer makes Ulysses\nsay, “How dull it is to pause, to make an end, to rest unburnished; not to\nshine in use–as though to breathe were life!”",
        "Goethe tells us that at thirty he resolved “to work out life no longer by\nhalves, but in all its beauty and totality.”",
        "Life indeed must be measured by thought and action, not by time. It\ncertainly may be, and ought to be, bright, interesting, and happy; and,\naccording to the Italian proverb, “if all cannot live on the Piazza, every\none may feel the sun.”",
        "If we do our best; if we do not magnify trifling troubles; if we look\nresolutely, I do not say at the bright side of things, but at things as\nthey really are; if we avail ourselves of the manifold blessings which\nsurround us; we cannot but feel that life is indeed a glorious\ninheritance.",
        "    “More servants wait on man\n  Than he’ll take notice of. In every path\n    He treads down that which doth befriend him\n    When sickness makes him pale and wan\n  Oh mighty Love! Man is one world, and hath\n    Another to attend him.” [5]",
        "Few of us, however, realize the wonderful privilege of living, or the\nblessings we inherit; the glories and beauties of the Universe, which is\nour own if we choose to have it so; the extent to which we can make\nourselves what we wish to be; or the power we possess of securing peace,\nof triumphing over pain and sorrow.",
        "Dante pointed to the neglect of opportunities as a serious fault:",
        "                       “Man can do violence\n  To himself and his own blessings, and for this\n  He, in the second round, must aye deplore,\n  With unavailing penitence, his crime.\n  Whoe’er deprives himself of life and light\n  In reckless lavishment his talent wastes,\n  And sorrows then when he should dwell in joy.”",
        "Ruskin has expressed this with special allusion to the marvellous beauty\nof this glorious world, too often taken as a matter of course, and\nremembered, if at all, almost without gratitude. “Holy men,” he complains,\n\"in the recommending of the love of God to us, refer but seldom to those\nthings in which it is most abundantly and immediately shown; though they\ninsist much on His giving of bread, and raiment, and health (which He\ngives to all inferior creatures): they require us not to thank Him for\nthat glory of His works which He has permitted us alone to perceive: they\ntell us often to meditate in the closet, but they send us not, like Isaac,\ninto the fields at even: they dwell on the duty of self denial, but they\nexhibit not the duty of delight:” and yet, as he justly says elsewhere,\n\"each of us, as we travel the way of life, has the choice, according to\nour working, of turning all the voices of Nature into one song of\nrejoicing; or of withering and quenching her sympathy into a fearful\nwithdrawn silence of condemnation,–into a crying out of her stones and a\nshaking of her dust against us.”",
        "Must we not all admit, with Sir Henry Taylor, that “the retrospect of life\nswarms with lost opportunities”? “Whoever enjoys not life,” says Sir T.\nBrowne, “I count him but an apparition, though he wears about him the\nvisible affections of flesh.”",
        "St. Bernard, indeed, goes so far as to maintain that “nothing can work me\ndamage except myself; the harm that I sustain I carry about with me, and\nnever am a real sufferer but by my own fault.”",
        "Some Heathen moralists also have taught very much the same lesson. “The\ngods,” says Marcus Aurelius, “have put all the means in man’s power to\nenable him not to fall into real evils. Now that which does not make a man\nworse, how can it make his life worse?”",
        "Epictetus takes the same line: “If a man is unhappy, remember that his\nunhappiness is his own fault; for God has made all men to be happy.” “I\nam,” he elsewhere says, “always content with that which happens; for I\nthink that what God chooses is better than what I choose.” And again:\n\"Seek not that things should happen as you wish; but wish the things which\nhappen to be as they are, and you will have a tranquil flow of life.... If\nyou wish for anything which belongs to another, you lose that which is\nyour own.”",
        "Few, however, if any, can I think go as far as St. Bernard. We cannot but\nsuffer from pain, sickness, and anxiety; from the loss, the unkindness,\nthe faults, even the coldness of those we love. How many a day has been\ndamped and darkened by an angry word!",
        "Hegel is said to have calmly finished his Phaenomenologie des Geistes at\nJena, on the 14th October 1806, not knowing anything whatever of the\nbattle that was raging round him.",
        "Matthew Arnold has suggested that we might take a lesson from the heavenly\nbodies.",
        " “Unaffrighted by the silence round them,\n    Undistracted by the sights they see,\n  These demand not the things without them\n    Yield them love, amusement, sympathy.\n\n “Bounded by themselves, and unobservant\n    In what state God’s other works may be,\n  In their own tasks all their powers pouring,\n    These attain the mighty life you see.”",
        "It is true that",
        "  “A man is his own star;\n  Our acts our angels are\n  For good or ill,”",
        "and that “rather than follow a multitude to do evil,” one should “stand\nlike Pompey’s pillar, conspicuous by oneself, and single in\nintegrity.” [6] But to many this isolation would be itself most painful,\nfor the heart is “no island cut off from other lands, but a continent that\njoins to them.” [7]",
        "If we separate ourselves so much from the interests of those around us\nthat we do not sympathize with them in their sufferings, we shut ourselves\nout from sharing their happiness, and lose far more than we gain. If we\navoid sympathy and wrap ourselves round in a cold chain armor of\nselfishness, we exclude ourselves from many of the greatest and purest\njoys of life. To render ourselves insensible to pain we must forfeit also\nthe possibility of happiness.",
        "Moreover, much of what we call evil is really good in disguise, and we\nshould not “quarrel rashly with adversities not yet understood, nor\noverlook the mercies often bound up in them.” [8] Pleasure and pain are,\nas Plutarch says, the nails which fasten body and soul together. Pain is a\nwarning of danger, a very necessity of existence. But for it, but for the\nwarnings which our feelings give us, the very blessings by which we are\nsurrounded would soon and inevitably prove fatal. Many of those who have\nnot studied the question are under the impression that the more\ndeeply-seated portions of the body must be most sensitive. The very\nreverse is the case. The skin is a continuous and ever-watchful sentinel,\nalways on guard to give us notice of any approaching danger; while the\nflesh and inner organs, where pain would be without purpose, are, so long\nas they are in health, comparatively without sensation.",
        "“We talk,” says Helps, “of the origin of evil;... but what is evil? We\nmostly speak of sufferings and trials as good, perhaps, in their result;\nbut we hardly admit that they may be good in themselves. Yet they are\nknowledge–how else to be acquired, unless by making men as gods, enabling\nthem to understand without experience. All that men go through may be\nabsolutely the best for them–no such thing as evil, at least in our\ncustomary meaning of the word.”",
        "Indeed, “the vale best discovereth the hill,” [9] and “pour sentir les\ngrands biens, il faut qu’il connoisse les petits maux.” [10]",
        "But even if we do not seem to get all that we should wish, many will feel,\nas in Leigh Hunt’s beautiful translation of Filicaja’s sonnet, that–",
        "  “So Providence for us, high, infinite,\n  Makes our necessities its watchful task.\n  Hearkens to all our prayers, helps all our wants,\n  And e’en if it denies what seems our right,\n  Either denies because ’twould have us ask,\n  Or seems but to deny, and in denying grants.”",
        "Those on the other hand who do not accept the idea of continual\ninterferences, will rejoice in the belief that on the whole the laws of\nthe Universe work out for the general happiness.",
        "And if it does come–",
        "                     “Grief should be\n  Like joy, majestic, equable, sedate,\n  Confirming, cleansing, raising, making free:\n  Strong to consume small troubles; to commend\n  Great thoughts, grave thoughts, thoughts lasting to the end.” [11]",
        "If, however, we cannot hope that life will be all happiness, we may at\nleast secure a heavy balance on the right side; and even events which look\nlike misfortune, if boldly faced, may often be turned to good. Oftentimes,\nsays Seneca, “calamity turns to our advantage; and great ruins make way\nfor greater glories.” Helmholtz dates his start in science to an attack of\nillness. This led to his acquisition of a microscope, which he was enabled\nto purchase, owing to his having spent his autumn vacation of 1841 in the\nhospital, prostrated by typhoid fever; being a pupil, he was nursed\nwithout expense, and on his recovery he found himself in possession of the\nsavings of his small resources.",
        "“Savonarola,” says Castelar, “would, under different circumstances,\nundoubtedly have been a good husband, a tender father; a man unknown to\nhistory, utterly powerless to print upon the sands of time and upon the\nhuman soul the deep trace which he has left; but misfortune came to visit\nhim, to crush his heart, and to impart that marked melancholy which\ncharacterizes a soul in grief; and the grief that circled his brows with a\ncrown of thorns was also that which wreathed them with the splendor of\nimmortality. His hopes were centered in the woman he loved, his life was\nset upon the possession of her, and when her family finally rejected him,\npartly on account of his profession, and partly on account of his person,\nbelieved that it was death that had come upon him, when in truth it was\nimmortality.”",
        "It is however, impossible to deny the existence of evil, and the reason\nfor it has long exercised the human intellect. The Savage solves it by the\nsupposition of evil Spirits. The Greeks attributed the misfortunes of men\nin great measure to the antipathies and jealousies of gods and goddesses.\nOthers have imagined two divine principles, opposite and antagonistic–the\none friendly, the other hostile, to men.",
        "Freedom of action, however, seems to involve the existence of evil. If any\npower of selection be left us, much must depend on the choice we make. In\nthe very nature of things, two and two cannot make five. Epictetus\nimagines Jupiter addressing man as follows: “If it had been possible to\nmake your body and your property free from liability to injury, I would\nhave done so. As this could not be, I have given you a small portion of\nmyself.”",
        "This divine gift it is for us to use wisely. It is, in fact, our most\nvaluable treasure. “The soul is a much better thing than all the others\nwhich you possess. Can you then show me in what way you have taken care of\nit? For it is not likely that you, who are so wise a man, inconsiderately\nand carelessly allow the most valuable thing that you possess to be\nneglected and to perish.” [12]",
        "Moreover, even if evil cannot be altogether avoided, it is no doubt true\nthat not only whether the life we lead be good and useful, or evil and\nuseless, but also whether it be happy or unhappy, is very much in our own\npower, and depends greatly on ourselves. “Time alone relieves the foolish\nfrom sorrow, but reason the wise.” [13] and no one was ever yet made\nutterly miserable excepting by himself. We are, if not the masters, at any\nrate almost the creators of ourselves.",
        "With most of us it is not so much great sorrows, disease, or death, but\nrather the little “daily dyings” which cloud over the sunshine of life.\nMany of our troubles are insignificant in themselves, and might easily be\navoided!",
        "How happy home might generally be made but for foolish quarrels, or\nmisunderstandings, as they are well named! It is our own fault if we are\nquerulous or ill-humored; nor need we, though this is less easy, allow\nourselves to be made unhappy by the querulousness or ill-humors of others.",
        "Much of what we suffer we have brought on ourselves, if not by actual\nfault, at least by ignorance or thoughtlessness. Too often we think only\nof the happiness of the moment, and sacrifice that of the life. Troubles\ncomparatively seldom come to us, it is we who go to them. Many of us\nfritter our life away. La Bruyere says that “most men spend much of their\nlives in making the rest miserable;” or, as Goethe puts it:",
        "  “Careworn man has, in all ages,\n  Sown vanity to reap despair.”",
        "Not only do we suffer much in the anticipation of evil, as “Noah lived\nmany years under the affliction of a flood, and Jerusalem was taken unto\nJeremy before it was besieged,” but we often distress ourselves greatly in\nthe apprehension of misfortunes which after all never happen at all. We\nshould do our best and wait calmly the result. We often hear of people\nbreaking down from overwork, but in nine cases out of ten they are really\nsuffering from worry or anxiety.",
        "“Nos maux moraux,” says Rousseau, “sont tous dans l’opinion, hors un seul,\nqui est le crime; et celui-la depend de nous: nos maux physiques nous\ndetruisent, ou se detruisent. Le temps, ou la mort, sont nos remedes.”",
        "  “Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,\n  Which we ascribe to heaven.” [14]",
        "This, however, applies to the grown up. With children of course it is\ndifferent. It is customary, but I think it is a mistake, to speak of happy\nchildhood. Children, however, are often over-anxious and acutely\nsensitive. Man ought to be man and master of his fate; but children are at\nthe mercy of those around them. Mr. Rarey, the great horse-tamer, has told\nus that he has known an angry word raise the pulse of a horse ten beats in\na minute. Think then how it must affect a child!",
        "It is small blame to the young if they are over-anxious; but it is a\ndanger to be striven against. “The terrors of the storm are chiefly felt\nin the parlor or the cabin.” [15]",
        "To save ourselves from imaginary, or at any rate problematical, evils, we\noften incur real suffering. “The man,” said Epicurus, “who is not content\nwith little is content with nothing.” How often do we “labor for that\nwhich satisfieth not.” More than we use is more than we need, and only a\nburden to the bearer. [16] We most of us give ourselves an immense amount\nof useless trouble; encumber ourselves, as it were, on the journey of life\nwith a dead weight of unnecessary baggage; and as “a man maketh his train\nlonger, he makes his wings shorter.” [17] In that delightful fairy tale,\nAlice through the Looking-Glass, the “White Knight” is described as\nhaving loaded himself on starting for a journey with a variety of odds and\nends, including a mousetrap, in case he was troubled by mice at night, and\na beehive in case he came across a swarm of bees.",
        "Hearne, in his Journey to the Mouth of the Coppermine River tells us\nthat a few days after starting on his expedition he met a party of\nIndians, who annexed a great deal of his property, and all Hearne says is,\n\"The weight of our baggage being so much lightened, our next day’s journey\nwas much pleasanter.” I ought, however, to add that the Indians broke up\nthe philosophical instruments, which, no doubt, were rather an\nencumbrance.",
        "When troubles do come, Marcus Aurelius wisely tells us to “remember on\nevery occasion which leads thee to vexation to apply this principle, that\nthis is not a misfortune, but that to bear it nobly is good fortune.” Our\nown anger indeed does us more harm than the thing which makes us angry;\nand we suffer much more from the anger and vexation which we allow acts to\nrouse in us, than we do from the acts themselves at which we are angry and\nvexed. How much most people, for instance, allow themselves to be\ndistracted and disturbed by quarrels and family disputes. Yet in nine\ncases out of ten one ought not to suffer from being found fault with. If\nthe condemnation is just, it should be welcome as a warning; if it is\nundeserved, why should we allow it to distress us?",
        "Moreover, if misfortunes happen we do but make them worse by grieving over\nthem.",
        "“I must die,” again says Epictetus. “But must I then die sorrowing? I must\nbe put in chains. Must I then also lament? I must go into exile. Can I be\nprevented from going with cheerfulness and contentment? But I will put you\nin prison. Man, what are you saying? You may put my body in prison, but my\nmind not even Zeus himself can overpower.”",
        "If, indeed, we cannot be happy, the fault is generally in ourselves.\nSocrates lived under the Thirty Tyrants. Epictetus was a poor slave, and\nyet how much we owe him!",
        "“How is it possible,” he says, “that a man who has nothing, who is naked,\nhouseless, without a hearth, squalid, without a slave, without a city, can\npass a life that flows easily? See, God has sent a man to show you that it\nis possible. Look at me, who am without a city, without a house, without\npossessions, without a slave; I sleep on the ground; I have no wife, no\nchildren, no praetorium, but only the earth and heavens, and one poor\nclock. And what do I want? Am I not without sorrow? Am I not without fear?\nAm I not free? When did any of you see me failing in the object of my\ndesire? or ever falling into that which I would avoid? Did I ever blame\nGod or man? Did I ever accuse any man? Did any of you ever see me with a\nsorrowful countenance? And how do I meet with those whom you are afraid of\nand admire? Do not I treat them like slaves? Who, when he sees me, does\nnot think that he sees his king and master?”",
        "Think how much we have to be thankful for. Few of us appreciate the number\nof our everyday blessings; we look on them as trifles, and yet “trifles\nmake perfection, and perfection is no trifle,” as Michael Angelo said. We\nforget them because they are always with us; and yet for each of us, as\nMr. Pater well observes, “these simple gifts, and others equally trivial,\nbread and wine, fruit and milk, might regain that poetic and, as it were,\nmoral significance which surely belongs to all the means of our daily\nlife, could we but break through the veil of our familiarity with things\nby no means vulgar in themselves.”",
        "“Let not,” says Isaak Walton, “the blessings we receive daily from God\nmake us not to value or not praise Him because they be common; let us not\nforget to praise Him for the innocent mirth and pleasure we have met with\nsince we met together. What would a blind man give to see the pleasant\nrivers and meadows and flowers and fountains; and this and many other like\nblessings we enjoy daily.”",
        "Contentment, we have been told by Epicurus, consists not in great wealth,\nbut in few wants. In this fortunate country, however, we may have many\nwants, and yet, if they are only reasonable, we may gratify them all.",
        "Nature indeed provides without stint the main requisites of human\nhappiness. “To watch the corn grow, or the blossoms set; to draw hard\nbreath over plough-share or spade; to read, to think, to love, to pray,\"\nthese, says Ruskin, “are the things that make men happy.”",
        "“I have fallen into the hands of thieves,” says Jeremy Taylor; “what then?\nThey have left me the sun and moon, fire and water, a loving wife and many\nfriends to pity me, and some to relieve me, and I can still discourse;\nand, unless I list, they have not taken away my merry countenance and my\ncheerful spirit and a good conscience....

        "“Paradise indeed might,” as Luther said, “apply to the whole world.” What\nmore is there we could ask for ourselves? “Every sort of beauty,” says Mr.\nGreg, [19] “has been lavished on our allotted home; beauties to enrapture\nevery sense, beauties to satisfy every taste; forms the noblest and the\nloveliest, colors the most gorgeous and the most delicate, odors the\nsweetest and subtlest, harmonies the most soothing and the most stirring:\nthe sunny glories of the day; the pale Elysian grace of moonlight; the\nlake, the mountain, the primeval forest, and the boundless ocean; ’silent\npinnacles of aged snow’ in one hemisphere, the marvels of tropical\nluxuriance in another; the serenity of sunsets; the sublimity of storms;\neverything is bestowed in boundless profusion on the scene of our\nexistence; we can conceive or desire nothing more exquisite or perfect\nthan what is round us every hour; and our perceptions are so framed as to\nbe consciously alive to all. The provision made for our sensuous enjoyment\nis in overflowing abundance; so is that for the other elements of our\ncomplex nature. Who that has revelled in the opening ecstasies of a young\nImagination, or the rich marvels of the world of Thought, does not confess\nthat the Intelligence has been dowered at least with as profuse a\nbeneficence as the Senses? Who that has truly tasted and fathomed human\nLove in its dawning and crowning joys has not thanked God for a felicity\nwhich indeed ’passeth understanding.’ If we had set our fancy to picture a\nCreator occupied solely in devising delight for children whom he loved, we\ncould not conceive one single element of bliss which is not here.”",

        "How then is this great object to be secured? What, says Marcus Aurelius,\n\"What is that which is able to conduct a man? One thing and only\none–philosophy. But this consists in keeping the daemon [2] within a man\nfree from violence and unharmed, superior to pains and pleasures, doing\nnothing without a purpose, yet not falsely and with hypocrisy, not feeling\nthe need of another man’s doing or not doing anything; and besides,\naccepting all that happens, and all that is allotted, as coming from\nthence, wherever it is, from whence he himself came; and, finally, waiting\nfor death with a cheerful mind, as being nothing else than a dissolution\nof the elements of which every living being is compounded.” I confess I do\nnot feel the force of these last few words, which indeed scarcely seem\nrequisite for his argument. The thought of death, however, certainly\ninfluences the conduct of life less than might have been expected.",
        "Bacon truly points out that “there is no passion in the mind of man so\nweak, but it mates and masters the fear of death.... Revenge triumphs over\ndeath, love slights it, honor aspireth to it, grief flieth to it.”",

But you\nmay clear away your own. From yourself, from your own thoughts, cast away,\ninstead of Procrustes and Sciron, [4] sadness, fear, desire, envy,\nmalevolence, avarice, effeminacy, intemperance.

        "People sometimes think how delightful it would be to be quite free. But a\nfish, as Ruskin says, is freer than a man, and as for a fly, it is “a\nblack incarnation of freedom.” A life of so-called pleasure and\nself-indulgence is not a life of real happiness or true freedom. Far from\nit, if we once begin to give way to ourselves, we fall under a most\nintolerable tyranny. Other temptations are in some respects like that of\ndrink. At first, perhaps, it seems delightful, but there is bitterness at\nthe bottom of the cup. Men drink to satisfy the desire created by previous\nindulgence. So it is in other things. Repetition soon becomes a craving,\nnot a pleasure. Resistance grows more and more painful; yielding, which at\nfirst, perhaps, afforded some slight and temporary gratification, soon\nceases to give pleasure, and even if for a time it procures relief, ere\nlong becomes odious itself.",
        "To resist is difficult, to give way is painful; until at length the\nwretched victim to himself, can only purchase, or thinks he can only\npurchase, temporary relief from intolerable craving and depression, at the\nexpense of far greater suffering in the future.",
        "On the other hand, self-control, however difficult at first, becomes step\nby step easier and more delightful. We possess mysteriously a sort of dual\nnature, and there are few truer triumphs, or more delightful sensations,\nthan to obtain thorough command of oneself.",
        "How much pleasanter it is to ride a spirited horse, even perhaps though\nrequiring some strength and skill, than to creep along upon a jaded hack.\nIn the one case you feel under you the free, responsive spring of a living\nand willing force; in the other you have to spur a dull and lifeless\nslave.",
        "To rule oneself is in reality the greatest triumph. “He who is his own\nmonarch,” says Sir T. Browne, “contentedly sways the sceptre of himself,\nnot envying the glory to crowned heads and Elohim of the earth;” for those\nare really highest who are nearest to heaven, and those are lowest who are\nfarthest from it.",
        "True greatness has little, if anything, to do with rank or power.\n\"Eurystheus being what he was,” says Epictetus, “was not really king of\nArgos nor of Mycenae, for he could not even rule himself; while Hercules\npurged lawlessness and introduced justice, though he was both naked and\nalone.”",
        "We are told that Cineas the philosopher once asked Pyrrhus what he would\ndo when he had conquered Italy. “I will conquer Sicily.” “And after\nSicily?” “Then Africa.” “And after you have conquered the world?” “I will\ntake my ease and be merry.” “Then,” asked Cineas, “why can you not take\nyour ease and be merry now?”",
        "Moreover, as Sir Arthur Helps has wisely pointed out, “the enlarged view\nwe have of the Universe must in some measure damp personal ambition. What\nis it to be king, sheikh, tetrarch, or emperor over a ’bit of a bit’ of\nthis little earth?” “All rising to great place,” says Bacon, “is by a\nwinding stair;” and “princes are like heavenly bodies, which have much\nveneration, but no rest.”",

        "I may, indeed, quote Aristotle against himself, for he has elsewhere told\nus that “business should be chosen for the sake of leisure; and things\nnecessary and useful for the sake of the beautiful in conduct.”",
        "It is not true that the ordinary duties of life in a country like\nours–commerce, manufactures, agriculture,–the pursuits to which the vast\nmajority are and must be devoted–are incompatible with the dignity or\nnobility of life. Whether a life is noble or ignoble depends, not on the\ncalling which is adopted, but on the spirit in which it is followed. The\nhumblest life may be noble, while that of the most powerful monarch or the\ngreatest genius may be contemptible. Commerce, indeed, is not only\ncompatible, but I would almost go further and say that it will be most\nsuccessful, if carried on in happy union with noble aims and generous\naspirations. What Ruskin says of art is, with due modification, true of\nlife generally. It does not matter whether a man “paint the petal of a\nrose or the chasms of a precipice, so that love and admiration attend on\nhim as he labors, and wait for ever on his work. It does not matter\nwhether he toil for months on a few inches of his canvas, or cover a\npalace front with color in a day; so only that it be with a solemn\npurpose, that he have filled his heart with patience, or urged his hand to\nhaste.”",

Cheerfulness is the daughter of employment,\nand on the whole I believe there never was a time when modest merit and\npatient industry were more sure of reward.",
        "We must not, indeed, be discouraged if success be slow in coming, nor\npuffed up if it comes quickly. We often complain of the nature of things\nwhen the fault is all in ourselves. Seneca, in one of his letters,\nmentions that his wife’s maid, Harpaste, had nearly lost her eyesight, but\n\"she knoweth not she is blind, she saith the house is dark. This that\nseemeth ridiculous unto us in her, happeneth unto us all. No man\nunderstandeth that he is covetous, or avaricious.

        "The importance of small things has been pointed out by philosophers over\nand over again from AEsop downward. “Great without small makes a bad\nwall,” says a quaint Greek proverb, which seems to go back to cyclopean\ntimes. In an old Hindoo story Ammi says to his son, “Bring me a fruit of\nthat tree and break it open. What is there?” The son said, “Some small\nseeds.” “Break one of them and what do you see?” “Nothing, my lord,” “My\nchild,” said Ammi, “where you see nothing there dwells a mighty tree.” It\nmay almost be questioned whether anything can be truly called small.",
        "  “There is no great and no small\n  To the soul that maketh all;\n  And where it cometh all things are,\n  And it cometh everywhere.” [6]",
        "We should therefore watch ourselves in small things. If “you wish not to\nbe of an angry temper, do not feed the habit: throw nothing on it which\nwill increase it: at first keep quiet, and count the days on which you\nhave not been angry. I used to be in passion every day; now every second\nday; then every third; then every fourth. But if you have intermitted\nthirty days, make a sacrifice to God. For the habit at first begins to be\nweakened, and then is completely destroyed. When you can say, ’I have not\nbeen vexed to-day, nor the day before, nor yet on any succeeding day\nduring two or three months; but I took care when some exciting things\nhappened,’ be assured that you are in a good way.” [7]",
        "Emerson closes his Conduct of Life with a striking allegory. The young\nMortal enters the Hall of the Firmament. The Gods are sitting there, and\nhe is alone with them. They pour on him gifts and blessings, and beckon\nhim to their thrones. But between him and them suddenly appear snow-storms\nof illusions. He imagines himself in a vast crowd, whose behests he\nfancies he must obey. The mad crowd drives hither and thither, and sways\nthis way and that. What is he that he should resist? He lets himself be\ncarried about. How can he think or act for himself? But the clouds lift,\nand there are the Gods still sitting on their thrones; they alone with him\nalone.",

        "“Men seek retreats,” says Marcus Aurelius, “houses in the country,\nseashores, and mountains; and thou too art wont to desire such things very\nmuch. But this is altogether a mark of the most common sort of men; for it\nis in thy power whenever thou shalt choose, to retire into thyself. For\nnowhere either with more quiet or more freedom from trouble does a man\nretire, than into his own soul, particularly when he has within him such\nthoughts that by looking into them he is immediately in perfect\ntranquillity.”",
        "Happy indeed is he who has such a sanctuary in his own soul. “He who is\nvirtuous is wise; and he who is wise is good; and he who is good is\nhappy.” [8]",
        "But we cannot expect to be happy if we do not lead pure and useful lives.\nTo be good company for ourselves we must store our minds well; fill them\nwith pure and peaceful thoughts; with pleasant memories of the past, and\nreasonable hopes for the future. We must, as far as may be, protect\nourselves from self-reproach, from care, and from anxiety. We shall make\nour lives pure and peaceful, by resisting evil, by placing restraint upon\nour appetites, and perhaps even more by strengthening and developing our\ntendencies to good. We must be careful, then, on what we allow our minds\nto dwell. The soul is dyed by its thoughts; we cannot keep our minds pure\nif we allow them to be sullied by detailed accounts of crime and sin.\nPeace of mind, as Ruskin beautifully observes, “must come in its own time,\nas the waters settle themselves into clearness as well as quietness; you\ncan no more filter your mind into purity than you can compress it into\ncalmness; you must keep it pure if you would have it pure, and throw no\nstones into it if you would have it quiet.”",
        "The penalty of injustice, said Socrates, is not death or stripes, but the\nfatal necessity of becoming more and more unjust. Few men have led a wiser\nor more virtuous life than Socrates himself, of whom Xenophon gives us the\nfollowing description:–\"To me, being such as I have described him, so\npious that he did nothing without the sanction of the gods; so just, that\nhe wronged no man even in the most trifling affair, but was of service in\nthe most important matters to those who enjoyed his society; so temperate\nthat he never preferred pleasure to virtue; so wise, that he never erred\nin distinguishing better from worse; needing no counsel from others, but\nbeing sufficient in himself to discriminate between them; so able to\nexplain and settle such questions by argument; and so capable of\ndiscerning the character of others, of confuting those who were in error,\nand of exhorting them to virtue and honor, he seemed to be such as the\nbest and happiest of men would be. But if any one disapproves of my\nopinion let him compare the conduct of others with that of Socrates, and\ndetermine accordingly.”",
        "Marcus Aurelius again has drawn for us a most instructive lesson in his\ncharacter of Antoninus:–\"Remember his constancy in every act which was\nconformable to reason, his evenness in all things, his piety, the serenity\nof his countenance, his sweetness, his disregard of empty fame, and his\nefforts to understand things; how he would never let anything pass without\nhaving first carefully examined it and clearly understood it; how he bore\nwith those who blamed him unjustly without blaming them in return; how he\ndid nothing in a hurry; how he listened not to calumnies, and how exact an\nexaminer of manners and actions he was; not given to reproach people, nor\ntimid, nor suspicious, nor a sophist; with how little he was satisfied,\nsuch as lodging, bed, dress, food, servants; how laborious and patient;\nhow sparing he was in his diet; his firmness and uniformity in his\nfriendships; how he tolerated freedom of speech in those who opposed his\nopinions; the pleasure that he had when any man showed him anything\nbetter, and how pious he was without superstition. Imitate all this that\nthou mayest have as good a conscience, when thy last hour comes, as he\nhad.”",
        "Such peace of mind is indeed an inestimable boon, a rich reward of duty\nfulfilled. Well then does Epictetus ask, “Is there no reward? Do you seek\na reward greater than that of doing what is good and just? At Olympia you\nwish for nothing more, but it seems to you enough to be crowned at the\ngames. Does it then seem to you so small and worthless a thing to be good\nand happy?”",

        "The debt we owe to books was well expressed by Richard de Bury, Bishop of\nDurham, author of Philobiblon, written as long ago as 1344, published in\n1473, and the earliest English treatise on the delights of\nliterature:–\"These,” he says, “are the masters who instruct us without\nrods and ferules, without hard words and anger, without clothes or money.\nIf you approach them, they are not asleep; if investigating you\ninterrogate them, they conceal nothing; if you mistake them, they never\ngrumble; if you are ignorant, they cannot laugh at you. The library,\ntherefore, of wisdom is more precious than all riches, and nothing that\ncan be wished for is worthy to be compared with it. Whosoever therefore\nacknowledges himself to be a zealous follower of truth, of happiness, of\nwisdom, of science, or even of the faith, must of necessity make himself a\nlover of books.” But if the debt were great then, how much more now.",
        "This feeling that books are real friends is constantly present to all who\nlove reading. “I have friends,” said Petrarch, “whose society is extremely\nagreeable to me; they are of all ages, and of every country. They have\ndistinguished themselves both in the cabinet and in the field, and\nobtained high honors for their knowledge of the sciences. It is easy to\ngain access to them, for they are always at my service, and I admit them\nto my company, and dismiss them from it, whenever I please. They are never\ntroublesome, but immediately answer every question I ask them. Some relate\nto me the events of past ages, while others reveal to me the secrets of\nNature. Some teach me how to live, and others how to die. Some, by their\nvivacity, drive away my cares and exhilarate my spirits; while others give\nfortitude to my mind, and teach me the important lesson how to restrain my\ndesires, and to depend wholly on myself. They open to me, in short, the\nvarious avenues of all the arts and sciences, and upon their information I\nmay safely rely in all emergencies. In return for all their services, they\nonly ask me to accommodate them with a convenient chamber in some corner\nof my humble habitation, where they may repose in peace; for these friends\nare more delighted by the tranquillity of retirement than with the tumults\nof society.”",
        "“He that loveth a book,” says Isaac Barrow, “will never want a faithful\nfriend, a wholesome counsellor, a cheerful companion, an effectual\ncomforter. By study, by reading, by thinking, one may innocently divert\nand pleasantly entertain himself, as in all weathers, so in all fortunes.”",

But in a well-furnished library we, in fact, possess this\npower. We can question Xenophon and Caesar on their campaigns, make\nDemosthenes and Cicero plead before us, join in the audiences of Socrates\nand Plato, and receive demonstrations from Euclid and Newton. In books we\nhave the choicest thoughts of the ablest men in their best dress.”",

        "“The lover of reading,” says Leigh Hunt, “will derive agreeable terror\nfrom Sir Bertram and the Haunted Chamber; will assent with, delighted\nreason to every sentence in Mrs. Barbauld’s Essay; will feel himself\nwandering into solitudes with Gray; shake honest hands with Sir Roger\nde Coverley; be ready to embrace Parson Adams, and to chuck Pounce\nout of the window instead of the hat; will travel with Marco Polo and\nMungo Park; stay at home with Thomson; retire with Cowley; be\nindustrious with Hutton; sympathizing with Gay and Mrs. Inchbald;\nlaughing with (and at) Buncle; melancholy, and forlorn, and\nself-restored with the shipwrecked mariner of De Foe.”",
        "Carlyle has wisely said that a collection of books is a real university.",
        "The importance of books has been appreciated in many quarters where we\nmight least expect it. Among the hardy Norsemen runes were supposed to be\nendowed with miraculous power. There is an Arabic proverb, that “a wise\nman’s day is worth a fool’s life,” and another–though it reflects perhaps\nrather the spirit of the Califs than of the Sultans,–that “the ink of\nscience is more precious than the blood of the martyrs.”",
        "Confucius is said to have described himself as a man who “in his eager\npursuit of knowledge forgot his food, who in the joy of its attainment\nforgot his sorrows, and did not even perceive that old age was coming on.”",
        "Yet, if this could be said by the Arabs and the Chinese, what language can\nbe strong enough to express the gratitude we ought to feel for the\nadvantages we enjoy! We do not appreciate, I think, our good fortune in\nbelonging to the nineteenth century. Sometimes, indeed, one may even be\ninclined to wish that one had not lived quite so soon, and to long for a\nglimpse of the books, even the school-books, of one hundred years hence. A\nhundred years ago not only were books extremely expensive and cumbrous,\nbut many of the most delightful were still uncreated–such as the works of\nScott, Thackeray, Dickens, Bulwer Lytton, and Trollope, not to mention\nliving authors. How much more interesting science has become especially,\nif I were to mention only one name, through the genius of Darwin! Renan\nhas characterized this as a most amusing century; I should rather have\ndescribed it as most interesting: presenting us as it does with an endless\nvista of absorbing problems; with infinite opportunities; with more\ninterest and less danger than surrounded our less fortunate ancestors.",

        "Macaulay, who had all that wealth and fame, rank and talents could give,\nyet, we are told, derived his greatest happiness from books. Sir G.\nTrevelyan, in his charming biography, says that–\"of the feelings which\nMacaulay entertained toward the great minds of bygone ages it is not for\nany one except himself to speak. He has told us how his debt to them was\nincalculable; how they guided him to truth; how they filled his mind with\nnoble and graceful images; how they stood by him in all vicissitudes–\ncomforters in sorrow, nurses in sickness, companions in solitude, the old\nfriends who are never seen with new faces; who are the same in wealth and\nin poverty, in glory and in obscurity. Great as were the honors and\npossessions which Macaulay acquired by his pen, all who knew him were well\naware that the titles and rewards which he gained by his own works were as\nnothing in the balance compared with the pleasure he derived from the\nworks of others.”",
        "There was no society in London so agreeable that Macaulay would have\npreferred it at breakfast or at dinner “to the company of Sterne or\nFielding, Horace Walpole or Boswell.” The love of reading which Gibbon\ndeclared he would not exchange for all the treasures of India was, in\nfact, with Macaulay “a main element of happiness in one of the happiest\nlives that it has ever fallen to the lot of the biographer to record.”",
        "“History,” says Fuller, “maketh a young man to be old without either\nwrinkles or gray hair, privileging him with the experience of age without\neither the infirmities or the inconveniences thereof.”",

        "To the lover of literature or science, exercise often presents itself as\nan irksome duty, and many a one has felt like “the fair pupil of Ascham\n(Lady Jane Gray), who, while the horns were sounding and dogs in full cry,\nsat in the lonely oriel, with eyes riveted to that immortal page which\ntells how meekly and bravely (Socrates) the first martyr of intellectual\nliberty took the cup from his weeping jailer.” [1]",

        "Books, again, are now so cheap as to be within the reach of almost every\none. This was not always so. It is quite a recent blessing. Mr. Ireland,\nto whose charming little Book Lover’s Enchiridion, in common with every\nlover of reading. I am greatly indebted, tells us that when a boy he was\nso delighted with White’s Natural History of Selborne, that in order to\npossess a copy of his own he actually copied out the whole work.",
        "Mary Lamb gives a pathetic description of a studious boy lingering at a\nbookstall:",
        "  “I saw a boy with eager eye\n  Open a book upon a stall,\n  And read, as he’d devour it all;\n  Which, when the stall man did espy,\n  Soon to the boy I heard him call,\n  ’You, sir, you never buy a book,\n  Therefore in one you shall not look.’\n  The boy passed slowly on, and with a sigh\n  He wished he never had been taught to read,\n  Then of the old churl’s books he should have had no need.”",
        "Such snatches of literature have indeed, special and peculiar charm. This\nis, I believe, partly due to the very fact of their being brief. Many\nreaders miss much of the pleasure of reading by forcing themselves to\ndwell too long continuously on one subject. In a long railway journey, for\ninstance, many persons take only a single book. The consequence is that,\nunless it is a story, after half an hour or an hour they are quite tired\nof it. Whereas, if they had two, or still better three books, on different\nsubjects, and one of them of an amusing character, they would probably\nfind that, by changing as soon as they felt at all weary, they would come\nback again and again to each with renewed zest, and hour after hour would\npass pleasantly away. Every one, of course, must judge for himself, but\nsuch at least is my experience.",
        "I quite agree, therefore, with Lord Iddesleigh as to the charm of\ndesultory reading, but the wider the field the more important that we\nshould benefit by the very best books in each class. Not that we need\nconfine ourselves to them, but that we should commence with them, and they\nwill certainly lead us on to others. There are of course some books which\nwe must read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest. But these are exceptions.\nAs regards by far the larger number, it is probably better to read them\nquickly, dwelling only on the best and most important passages. In this\nway, no doubt, we shall lose much, but we gain more by ranging over a\nwider field. We may, in fact, I think, apply to reading Lord Brougham’s\nwise dictum as regards education, and say that it is well to read\neverything of something, and something of everything. In this way only we\ncan ascertain the bent of our own tastes, for it is a general, though not\nof course an invariable, rule, that we profit little by books which we do\nnot enjoy.",

        "Not only does a library contain “infinite riches in a little room,” [3]\nbut we may sit at home and yet be in all quarters of the earth. We may\ntravel round the world with Captain Cook or Darwin, with Kingsley or\nRuskin, who will show us much more perhaps than ever we should see for\nourselves. The world itself has no limits for us; Humboldt and Herschel\nwill carry us far away to the mysterious nebulae, beyond the sun and even\nthe stars: time has no more bounds than space; history stretches out\nbehind us, and geology will carry us back for millions of years before the\ncreation of man, even to the origin of the material Universe itself. Nor\nare we limited to one plane of thought. Aristotle and Plato will transport\nus into a sphere none the less delightful because we cannot appreciate it\nwithout some training.",
        "Comfort and consolation, refreshment and happiness, may indeed be found in\nhis library by any one “who shall bring the golden key that unlocks its\nsilent door.” [4] A library is true fairyland, a very palace of delight, a\nhaven of repose from the storms and troubles of the world. Rich and poor\ncan enjoy it equally, for here, at least, wealth gives no advantage. We\nmay make a library, if we do but rightly use it, a true paradise on earth,\na garden of Eden without its one drawback; for all is open to us,\nincluding, and especially, the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, for which\nwe are told that our first mother sacrificed all the Pleasures of\nParadise. Here we may read the most important histories, the most exciting\nvolumes of travels and adventures, the most interesting stories, the most\nbeautiful poems; we may meet the most eminent statesmen, poets, and\nphilosophers, benefit by the ideas of the greatest thinkers, and enjoy the\ngrandest creations of human genius.",

The laborer and mechanic, on the contrary, besides working often\nfor much shorter hours, have in their work-time taken sufficient bodily\nexercise, and could therefore give any leisure they might have to reading\nand study. They have not done so as yet, it is true; but this has been for\nobvious reasons. Now, however, in the first place, they receive an\nexcellent education in elementary schools, and in the second have more\neasy access to the best books.",

I speak of it of course only as a worldly\nadvantage, and not in the slightest degree as superseding or derogating\nfrom the higher office and surer and stronger panoply of religious\nprinciples–but as a taste, and instrument, and a mode of pleasurable\ngratification. Give a man this taste, and the means of gratifying it, and\nyou can hardly fail of making a happy man, unless, indeed, you put into\nhis hands a most perverse selection of books.”",
        "It is one thing to own a library; it is quite another to use it wisely. I\nhave often been astonished how little care people devote to the selection\nof what they read. Books, we know, are almost innumerable; our hours for\nreading are, alas! very few. And yet many people read almost by hazard.\nThey will take any book they chance to find in a room at a friend’s house;\nthey will buy a novel at a railway-stall if it has an attractive title;\nindeed, I believe in some cases even the binding affects their choice. The\nselection is, no doubt, far from easy. I have often wished some one would\nrecommend a list of a hundred good books. If we had such lists drawn up by\na few good guides they would be most useful. I have indeed sometimes heard\nit said that in reading every one must choose for himself, but this\nreminds me of the recommendation not to go into the water till you can\nswim.",
        "In the absence of such lists I have picked out the books most frequently\nmentioned with approval by those who have referred directly or indirectly\nto the pleasure of reading, and have ventured to include some which,\nthough less frequently mentioned, are especial favorites of my own. Every\none who looks at the list will wish to suggest other books, as indeed I\nshould myself, but in that case the number would soon run up. [1]",
        "I have abstained, for obvious reasons, from mentioning works by living\nauthors, though from many of them–Tennyson, Ruskin, and others–I have\nmyself derived the keenest enjoyment; and I have omitted works on science,\nwith one or two exceptions, because the subject is so progressive.",
        "I feel that the attempt is over bold, and I must beg for indulgence, while\nhoping for criticism; indeed one object which I have had in view is to\nstimulate others more competent far than I am to give us the advantage of\ntheir opinions.",
        "Moreover, I must repeat that I suggest these works rather as those which,\nas far as I have seen, have been most frequently recommended, than as\nsuggestions of my own, though I have slipped in a few of my own special\nfavorites.",
        "In any such selection much weight should, I think, be attached to the\ngeneral verdict of mankind. There is a “struggle for existence” and a\n\"survival of the fittest” among books, as well as among animals and\nplants. As Alonzo of Aragon said, “Age is a recommendation in four\nthings–old wood to burn, old wine to drink, old friends to trust,\nand old books to read.” Still, this can not be accepted without important\nqualifications. The most recent books of history and science contain or\nought to contain, the most accurate information and the most trustworthy\nconclusions. Moreover, while the books of other races and times have an\ninterest from their very distance, it must be admitted that many will\nstill more enjoy, and feel more at home with, those of our own century and\npeople.",
        "Yet the oldest books of the world are remarkable and interesting on\naccount of their very age; and the works which have influenced the\nopinions, or charmed the leisure hours, of millions of men in distant\ntimes and far-away regions are well worth reading on that very account,\neven if to us they seem scarcely to deserve their reputation. It is true\nthat to many, such works are accessible only in translations; but\ntranslations, though they can never perhaps do justice to the original,\nmay yet be admirable in themselves. The Bible itself, which must stand\nfirst in the list, is a conclusive case.",
        "At the head of all non-Christian moralists, I must place the\nEnchiridion of Epictetus, certainly one of the noblest books in the\nwhole of literature; it has, moreover, been admirably translated. With\nEpictetus, [2] I think must come Marcus Aurelius. The Analects of\nConfucius will, I believe, prove disappointing to most English readers,\nbut the effect it has produced on the most numerous race of men\nconstitutes in itself a peculiar interest. The Ethics of Aristotle,\nperhaps, appear to some disadvantage from the very fact that they have so\nprofoundly influenced our views of morality. The Koran, like the\nAnalects of Confucius, will to most of us derive its principal interest\nfrom the effect it has exercised, and still exercises, on so many millions\nof our fellow-men. I doubt whether in any other respect it will seem to\nrepay perusal, and to most persons probably certain extracts, not too\nnumerous, would appear sufficient.",
        "The writings of the Apostolic Fathers have been collected in one volume by\nWake. It is but a small one, and though I must humbly confess that I was\ndisappointed, they are perhaps all the more curious from the contrast they\nafford to those of the Apostles themselves. Of the later Fathers I have\nincluded only the Confessions of St. Augustine, which Dr. Pusey selected\nfor the commencement of the Library of the Fathers, and which, as he\nobserves, has “been translated again and again into almost every European\nlanguage, and in all loved;” though Luther was of opinion that St.\nAugustine “wrote nothing to the purpose concerning faith.” But then Luther\nwas no great admirer of the Father. St. Jerome, he says, “writes, alas!\nvery coldly;” Chrysostom “digresses from the chief points;” St. Jerome is\n\"very poor;” and in fact, he says, “the more I read the books of the\nFathers the more I find myself offended;” while Renan, in his interesting\nautobiography, compared theology to a Gothic Cathedral, “elle a la\ngrandeur, les vides immenses, et le peu de solidite.”",
        "Among other devotional works most frequently recommended are Thomas a\nKempis’ Imitation of Christ, Pascal’s Pensees, Spinoza’s Tractatus\nTheologico-Politicus, Butler’s Analogy of Religion, Jeremy Taylor’s\nHoly Living and Dying, Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress, and last, not\nleast, Keble’s beautiful Christian Year.",
        "Aristotle and Plato again stand at the head of another class. The\nPolitics of Aristotle, and Plato’s Dialogues, if not the whole, at any\nrate the Phaedo, the Apology, and the Republic, will be of course\nread by all who wish to know anything of the history of human thought,\nthough I am heretical enough to doubt whether the latter repays the minute\nand laborious study often devoted to it.",
        "Aristotle being the father, if not the creator, of the modern scientific\nmethod, it has followed naturally–indeed, almost inevitably–that his\nprinciples have become part of our very intellectual being, so that they\nseem now almost self-evident, while his actual observations, though very\nremarkable–as, for instance, when he observes that bees on one journey\nconfine themselves to one kind of flower–still have been in many cases\nsuperseded by others, carried on under more favorable conditions. We must\nnot be ungrateful to the great master, because his lessons have taught us\nhow to advance.",
        "Plato, on the other hand, I say so with all respect, seems to me in some\ncases to play on words: his arguments are very able, very philosophical,\noften very noble; but not always conclusive; in a language differently\nconstructed they might sometimes tell in exactly the opposite sense. If\nthis method has proved less fruitful, if in metaphysics we have made but\nlittle advance, that very fact in one point of view leaves the\nDialogues of Socrates as instructive now as ever they were; while the\nproblems with which they deal will always rouse our interest, as the calm\nand lofty spirit which inspires them must command our admiration. Of the\nApology and the Phaedo especially it would be impossible to speak too\ngratefully.",
        "I would also mention Demosthenes’ De Corona, which Lord Brougham\npronounced the greatest oration of the greatest of orators; Lucretius,\nPlutarch’s Lives, Horace, and at least the De Officiis, De Amicitia,\nand De Senectute of Cicero.",
        "The great epics of the world have always constituted one of the most\npopular branches of literature. Yet how few, comparatively, ever read\nHomer or Virgil after leaving school.",
        "The Nibelungenlied, our great Anglo-Saxon epic, is perhaps too much\nneglected, no doubt on account of its painful character. Brunhild and\nKriemhild, indeed, are far from perfect, but we meet with few such “live\"\nwomen in Greek or Roman literature. Nor must I omit to mention Sir T.\nMalory’s Morte d’Arthur, though I confess I do so mainly in deference to\nthe judgment of others.",
        "Among the Greek tragedians I include Aeschylus, if not all his works, at\nany rate Prometheus, perhaps the sublimest poem in Greek literature, and\nthe Trilogy (Mr. Symonds in his Greek Poets speaks of the “unrivalled\nmajesty” of the Agamemnon, and Mark Pattison considered it “the grandest\nwork of creative genius in the whole range of literature”); or, as Sir M.\nE. Grant Duff recommends, the Persae; Sophocles (Oedipus Tyrannus),\nEuripides (Medea), and Aristophanes (The Knights and Clouds);\nunfortunately, as Schlegel says, probably even the greatest scholar does\nnot understand half his jokes; and I think most modern readers will prefer\nour modern poets.",
        "I should like, moreover, to say a word for Eastern poetry, such as\nportions of the Maha Bharata and Ramayana (too long probably to be\nread through, but of which Talboys Wheeler has given a most interesting\nepitome in the first two volumes of his History of India); the\nShah-nameh, the work of the great Persian poet Firdusi; Kalidasa’s\nSakuntala, and the Sheking, the classical collection of ancient Chinese\nodes. Many I know, will think I ought to have included Omar Khayyam.",
        "In history we are beginning to feel that the vices and vicissitudes of\nkings and queens, the dates of battles and wars, are far less important\nthan the development of human thought, the progress of art, of science,\nand of law, and the subject is on that very account even more interesting\nthan ever. I will, however, only mention, and that rather from a literary\nthan a historical point of view, Herodotus, Xenophon (the Anabasis),\nThucydides, and Tacitus (Germania); and of modern historians, Gibbon’s\nDecline and Fall (\"the splendid bridge from the old world to the new”),\nHume’s History of England, Carlyle’s French Revolution, Grote’s\nHistory of Greece, and Green’s Short History of the English People.",
        "Science is so rapidly progressive that, though to many minds it is the\nmost fruitful and interesting subject of all, I cannot here rest on that\nagreement which, rather than my own opinion, I take as the basis of my\nlist. I will therefore only mention Bacon’s Novum Organum, Mill’s\nLogic, and Darwin’s Origin of Species; in Political Economy, which\nsome of our rulers do not now sufficiently value, Mill, and parts of\nSmith’s Wealth of Nations, for probably those who do not intend to make\na special study of political economy would scarcely read the whole.",
        "Among voyages and travels, perhaps those most frequently suggested are\nCook’s Voyages, Humboldt’s Travels, and Darwin’s Naturalist’s\nJournal; though I confess I should like to have added many more.",
        "Mr. Bright not long ago specially recommended the less known American\npoets, but he probably assumed that every one would have read Shakespeare,\nMilton (Paradise Lost, Lycidas, Comus and minor poems), Chaucer,\nDante, Spencer, Dryden, Scott, Wordsworth, Pope, Byron, and others, before\nembarking on more doubtful adventures.",
        "Among other books most frequently recommended are Goldsmith’s Vicar of\nWakefield, Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels, Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe, The\nArabian Nights, Don Quixote, Boswell’s Life of Johnson, White’s\nNatural History of Selborne, Burke’s Select Works (Payne), the Essays of\nBacon, Addison, Hume, Montaigne, Macaulay, and Emerson, Carlyle’s Past\nand Present, Smiles’ Self-Help, and Goethe’s Faust and\nAutobiography.",
        "Nor can one go wrong in recommending Berkeley’s Human Knowledge,\nDescartes’ Discours sur la Methode, Locke’s Conduct of the\nUnderstanding, Lewes’ History of Philosophy; while, in order to keep\nwithin the number one hundred, I can only mention Moliere and Sheridan\namong dramatists. Macaulay considered Marivaux’s La Vie de Marianne the\nbest novel in any language, but my number is so nearly complete that I\nmust content myself with English: and will suggest Thackeray (Vanity\nFair and Pendennis), Dickens (Pickwick and David Copperfield), G.\nEliot (Adam Bede or The Mill on the Floss), Kingsley (Westward Ho!),\nLytton (Last Days of Pompeii), and last, not least, those of Scott,\nwhich indeed constitute a library in themselves, but which I must ask, in\nreturn for my trouble, to be allowed, as a special favor, to count as one.",
        "To any lover of books the very mention of these names brings back a crowd\nof delicious memories, grateful recollections of peaceful home hours,\nafter the labors and anxieties of the day.

        "“All men,” said Socrates, “have their different objects of\nambition–horses, dogs, money, honor, as the case may be; but for his own\npart he would rather have a good friend than all these put together.” And\nagain, men know “the number of their other possessions, although they\nmight be very numerous, but of their friends, though but few, they were\nnot only ignorant of the number, but even when they attempted to reckon it\nto such as asked them, they set aside again some that they had previously\ncounted among their friends; so little did they allow their friends to\noccupy their thoughts. Yet in comparison with what possession, of all\nothers, would not a good friend appear far more valuable?”",
        "“As to the value of other things,” says Cicero, “most men differ;\nconcerning friendship all have the same opinion. What can be more foolish\nthan, when men are possessed of great influence by their wealth, power,\nand resources, to procure other things which are bought by money–horses,\nslaves, rich apparel, costly vases–and not to procure friends, the most\nvaluable and fairest furniture of life?” And yet, he continues, “every man\ncan tell how many goats or sheep he possesses, but not how many friends.\"\nIn the choice, moreover, of a dog or of a horse, we exercise the greatest\ncare: we inquire into its pedigree, its training and character, and yet we\ntoo often leave the selection of our friends, which is of infinitely\ngreater importance–by whom our whole life will be more or less influenced\neither for good or evil–almost to chance.",

And Sir Thomas Browne quaintly\nobserves that “unthinking heads who have not learnt to be alone, are a\nprison to themselves if they be not with others; whereas, on the contrary,\nthose whose thoughts are in a fair and hurry within, are sometimes fain to\nretire into company to be out of the crowd of themselves.” Still I do not\nquite understand Emerson’s idea that “men descend to meet.” In another\nplace, indeed, he qualifies the statement, and says, “Almost all people\ndescend to meet.” Even so I should venture to question it, especially\nconsidering the context. “All association,” he adds, “must be a\ncompromise, and, what is worse, the very flower and aroma of the flower of\neach of the beautiful natures disappears as they approach each other.\"\nWhat a sad thought! Is it really so; need it be so? And if it were, would\nfriends be any real advantage? I should have thought that the influence of\nfriends was exactly the reverse: that the flower of a beautiful nature\nwould expand, and the colors grow brighter, when stimulated by the warmth\nand sunshine of friendship.",
        "It has been said that it is wise always to treat a friend, remembering\nthat he may become an enemy, and an enemy, remembering that he may become\na friend; and whatever may be thought of the first part of the adage,\nthere is certainly much wisdom in the latter. Many people seem to take\nmore pains and more pleasure in making enemies, than in making friends.\nPlutarch, indeed, quotes with approbation the advice of Pythagoras “not to\nshake hands with too many,” but as long as friends are well chosen, it is\ntrue rather that",
        "  “He who has a thousand friends,\n    Has never a one to spare,\n   And he who has one enemy,\n    Will meet him everywhere,”",
        "and unfortunately, while there are few great friends there is no little\nenemy.",
        "I guard myself, however, by saying again–As long as they are well chosen.\nOne is thrown in life with a great many people who, though not actively\nbad, though they may not wilfully lead us astray, yet take no pains with\nthemselves, neglect their own minds, and direct the conversation to petty\npuerilities or mere gossip; who do not seem to realize that conversation\nmay by a little effort be made most instructive and delightful, without\nbeing in any way pedantic; or, on the other hand, may be allowed to drift\ninto a mere morass of muddy thought and weedy words. There is hardly\nanyone from whom we may not learn much, if only they will trouble\nthemselves to tell us. Nay, even if they teach us nothing, they may help\nus by the stimulus of intelligent questions, or the warmth of sympathy.\nBut if they do neither, then indeed their companionship, if companionship\nit can be called, is mere waste of time, and of such we may well say, “I\ndo desire that we be better strangers.”",
        "Much certainly of the happiness and purity of our lives depends on our\nmaking a wise choice of our companions and friends. If our friends are\nbadly chosen they will inevitably drag us down; if well they will raise us\nup. Yet many people seem to trust in this matter to the chapter of\naccident. It is well and right, indeed, to be courteous and considerate to\nevery one with whom we are brought into contact, but to choose them as\nreal friends is another matter. Some seem to make a man a friend, or try\nto do so, because he lives near, because he is in the same business,\ntravels on the same line of railway, or for some other trivial reason.\nThere cannot be a greater mistake. These are only, in the words of\nPlutarch, “the idols and images of friendship.”",
        "To be friendly with every one is another matter; we must remember that\nthere is no little enemy, and those who have ever really loved any one\nwill have some tenderness for all. There is indeed some good in most men.\n\"I have heard much,” says Mr. Nasmyth in his charming autobiography,\n\"about the ingratitude and selfishness of the world. It may have been my\ngood fortune, but I have never experienced either of these unfeeling\nconditions.” Such also has been my own experience.",
        "  “Men talk of unkind hearts, kind deeds\n    With coldness still returning.\n  Alas! the gratitude of men\n    Has oftener left me mourning.”",
        "I cannot, then, agree with Emerson that “we walk alone in the world.\nFriends such as we desire are dreams and fables. But a sublime hope cheers\never the faithful heart, that elsewhere in other regions of the universal\npower souls are now acting, enduring, and daring, which can love us, and\nwhich we can love.”",
        "No doubt, much as worthy friends add to the happiness and value of life,\nwe must in the main depend on ourselves, and every one is his own best\nfriend or worst enemy.",
        "Sad, indeed, is Bacon’s assertion that “there is little friendship in the\nworld, and least of all between equals, which was wont to be magnified.\nThat  that is, is between superior and inferior, whose fortunes may\ncomprehend the one to the other.” But this can hardly be taken as his\ndeliberate opinion, for he elsewhere says, “but we may go farther, and\naffirm most truly, that it is a mere and miserable solitude to want true\nfriends, without which the world is but a wilderness.” Not only, he adds,\ndoes friendship introduce “daylight in the understanding out of darkness\nand confusion of thoughts;” it “maketh a fair day in the affections from\nstorm and tempests:” in consultation with a friend a man “tosseth his\nthoughts more easily; he marshalleth them more orderly; he seeth how they\nlook when they are turned into words; finally, he waxeth wiser than\nhimself, and that more by an hour’s discourse than by a day’s\nmeditation.”... “But little do men perceive what solitude is, and how far\nit extendeth, for a crowd is not company, and faces are but a gallery of\npictures, and talk but a tinkling cymbal where there is no love.”",
        "With this last assertion I cannot altogether concur. Surely even strangers\nmay be most interesting! and many will agree with Dr. Johnson when,\ndescribing a pleasant evening, he summed it up–\"Sir, we had a good talk.”",
        "Epictetus gives excellent advice when he dissuades from conversation on\nthe very subjects most commonly chosen, and advises that it should be on\n\"none of the common subjects–not about gladiators, nor horse-races, nor\nabout athletes, nor about eating or drinking, which are the usual\nsubjects; and especially not about men, as blaming them;” but when he\nadds, “or praising them,” the injunction seems to me of doubtful value.\nSurely Marcus Aurelius more wisely advises that “when thou wishest to\ndelight thyself, think of the virtues of those who live with thee; for\ninstance, the activity of one, and the modesty of another, and the\nliberality of a third, and some other good quality of a fourth. For\nnothing delights so much as the examples of the virtues, when they are\nexhibited in the morals of those who live with us and present themselves\nin abundance, as far as is possible. Wherefore we must keep them before\nus.” Yet how often we know merely the sight of those we call our friends,\nor the sound of their voices, but nothing whatever of their mind or soul.",
        "We must, moreover, be as careful to keep friends as to make them. If every\none knew what one said of the other, Pascal assures us that “there would\nnot be four friends in the world.” This I hope and think is too strong,\nbut at any rate try to be one of the four. And when you have made a\nfriend, keep him. Hast thou a friend, says an Eastern proverb, “visit him\noften, for thorns and brushwood obstruct the road which no one treads.\"\nThe affections should not be mere “tents of a night.”",
        "Still less does Friendship confer any privilege to make ourselves\ndisagreeable. Some people never seem to appreciate their friends till they\nhave lost them. Anaxagoras described the Mausoleum as the ghost of wealth\nturned into stone.",
        "“But he who has once stood beside the grave to look back on the\ncompanionship which has been for ever closed, feeling how impotent then\nare the wild love and the keen sorrow, to give one instant’s pleasure to\nthe pulseless heart, or atone in the lowest measure to the departed spirit\nfor the hour of unkindness, will scarcely for the future incur that debt\nto the heart which can only be discharged to the dust.” [1]",
        "Death, indeed, cannot sever friendship. “Friends,” says Cicero, “though\nabsent, are still present; though in poverty they are rich; though weak,\nyet in the enjoyment of health; and, what is still more difficult to\nassert, though dead they are alive.” This seems a paradox, yet it there\nnot much truth in his explanation? “To me, indeed, Scipio still lives, and\nwill always live; for I love the virtue of that man, and that worth is not\nyet extinguished.... Assuredly of all things that either fortune or time\nhas bestowed on me, I have none which I can compare with the friendship of\nScipio.”",
        "If, then, we choose our friends for what they are, not for what they have,\nand if we deserve so great a blessing, then they will be always with us,\npreserved in absence, and even after death, in the “amber of memory.”",

How can we pass most swiftly\nfrom point to point, and be present always at the focus where the greatest\nnumber of vital forces unite in their purest energy? To burn always with\nthis hard gem-like flame, to maintain this ecstasy, is success in life.\nFailure is to form habits, for habit is relation to a stereotyped\nworld:... while all melts under our feet, we may well catch at any\nexquisite passion, or any contribution to knowledge, that seems, by a\nlifted horizon, to set the spirit free for a moment.”",

And the answer was at hand. Ever young, ever mighty-with the vigor\nof a thousand worlds still within him-the real sculptor was even then\nclimbing up the eastern sky. It was he who raised aloft the waters which\ncut out these ravines; it was he who planted the glaciers on the mountain\nslopes, thus giving gravity a plough to open out the valleys; and it is\nhe who, acting through the ages, will finally lay low these mighty\nmonuments, rolling them gradually seaward, sowing the seeds of continents\nto be; so that the people of an older earth may see mould spread, and corn\nwave over the hidden rocks which at this moment bear the weight of the\nJungfrau.” And the Alps lie within twenty-four hours of London!",

        "“The upper Swiss valleys,” as the same great Seer says, “are sweet with\nperpetual streamlets, that seem always to have chosen the steepest places\nto come down, for the sake of the leaps, scattering their handfuls of\ncrystal this way and that, as the winds take them, with all the grace, but\nwith none of the formalism, of fountains ... until at last ... they find\ntheir way down to the turf, and lose themselves in that, silently; with\nquiet depth of clear water furrowing among the grass blades, and looking\nonly like their shadow, but presently emerging again in little startled\ngushes and laughing hurries, as if they had remembered suddenly that the\nday was too short for them to get down the hill.”",
        "How vividly does Symonds bring before us the sunny shores of the\nMediterranean, which he loves so well, and the contrast between the\nscenery of the North and the South.",
        "“In northern landscapes the eye travels through vistas of leafy boughs to\nstill, secluded crofts and pastures, where slow-moving oxen graze. The\nmystery of dreams and the repose of meditation haunt our massive bowers.\nBut in the South, the lattice-work of olive boughs and foliage scarcely\nveils the laughing sea and bright blue sky, while the hues of the\nlandscape find their climax in the dazzling radiance of the sun upon the\nwaves, and the pure light of the horizon. There is no concealment and no\nmelancholy here. Nature seems to hold a never-ending festival and dance,\nin which the waves and sunbeams and shadows join. Again, in northern\nscenery, the rounded forms of full-foliaged trees suit the undulating\ncountry, with its gentle hills and brooding clouds; but in the South the\nspiky leaves and sharp branches of the olive carry out the defined\noutlines which are everywhere observable through the broader beauties of\nmountain and valley and sea-shore. Serenity and intelligence characterize\nthis southern landscape, in which a race of splendid men and women lived\nbeneath the pure light of Phoebus, their ancestral god. Pallas protected\nthem, and golden Aphrodite favored them with beauty. Olives are not,\nhowever, by any means the only trees which play a part in idyllic scenery.\nThe tall stone pine is even more important.... Near Massa, by Sorrento,\nthere are two gigantic pines so placed that, lying on the grass beneath\nthem, one looks on Capri rising from the sea, Baiae, and all the bay of\nNaples sweeping round to the base of Vesuvius. Tangled growths of olives,\nand rose-trees fill the garden-ground along the shore, while far away in\nthe distance pale Inarime sleeps, with her exquisite Greek name, a virgin\nisland on the deep.",
        "“On the wilder hills you find patches of ilex and arbutus glowing with\ncrimson berries and white waxen bells, sweet myrtle rods and shafts of\nbay, frail tamarisk and tall tree-heaths that wave their frosted boughs\nabove your head. Nearer the shore the lentisk grows, a savory shrub, with\ncytisus and aromatic rosemary. Clematis and polished garlands of tough\nsarsaparilla wed the shrubs with clinging, climbing arms; and here and\nthere in sheltered nooks the vine shoots forth luxuriant tendrils bowed\nwith grapes, stretching from branch to branch of mulberry or elm, flinging\nfestoons on which young loves might sit and swing, or weaving a\nlattice-work of leaves across the open shed. Nor must the sounds of this\nlandscape be forgotten,–sounds of bleating flocks, and murmuring bees,\nand nightingales, and doves that moan, and running streams, and shrill\ncicadas, and hoarse frogs, and whispering pines. There is not a single\ndetail which a patient student may not verify from Theocritus.",
        "“Then too it is a landscape in which sea and country are never sundered.\nThe higher we climb upon the mountain-side the more marvellous is the\nbeauty of the sea, which seems to rise as we ascend, and stretch into the\nsky. Sometimes a little flake of blue is framed by olive boughs, sometimes\na turning in the road reveals the whole broad azure calm below. Or, after\ntoiling up a steep ascent we fall upon the undergrowth of juniper, and lo!\na double sea, this way and that, divided by the sharp spine of the jutting\nhill, jewelled with villages along its shore, and smiling with fair\nislands and silver sails.”",
        "To many of us the mere warmth of the South is a blessing and a delight.\nThe very thought of it is delicious. I have read over again and again\nWallace’s graphic description of a tropical sunrise–of the “sun of the\nearly morning that turneth all into gold.” [3]",
        "“Up to about a quarter past five o’clock,” he says, “the darkness is\ncomplete; but about that time a few cries of birds begin to break the\nsilence of night, perhaps indicating that signs of dawn are perceptible in\nthe eastern horizon. A little later the melancholy voices of the\ngoatsuckers are heard, varied croakings of frogs, the plaintive whistle of\nmountain thrushes, and strange cries of birds or mammals peculiar to each\nlocality. About half-past five the first glimmer of light becomes\nperceptible; it slowly becomes lighter, and then increases so rapidly that\nat about a quarter to six it seems full daylight. For the next quarter of\nan hour this changes very little in character; when, suddenly, the sun’s\nrim appears above the horizon, decking the dew-laden foliage with\nglittering gems sending gleams of golden light far into the woods, and\nwaking up all nature to life and activity. Birds chirp and flutter about,\nparrots scream, monkeys chatter, bees hum among the flowers, and gorgeous\nbutterflies flutter lazily along or sit with full expanded wings exposed\nto the warm and invigorating rays. The first hour of morning in the\nequatorial regions possesses a charm and a beauty that can never be\nforgotten. All nature seems refreshed and strengthened by the coolness and\nmoisture of the past night, new leaves and buds unfold almost before the\neye, and fresh shoots may often be observed to have grown many inches\nsince the preceding day. The temperature is the most delicious\nconceivable. The slight chill of early dawn, which was itself agreeable,\nis succeeded by an invigorating warmth; and the intense sunshine lights up\nthe glorious vegetation of the tropics, and realizes all that the magic\nart of the painter or the glowing words of the poet have pictured as their\nideals of terrestrial beauty.”",
        "Or take Dean Stanley’s description of the colossal statues of Amenophis\nIII., the Memnon of the Greeks, at Thebes–\"The sun was setting, the\nAfrican range glowed red behind them; the green plain was dyed with a\ndeeper green beneath them, and the shades of evening veiled the vast rents\nand fissures in their aged frames. As I looked back at them in the sunset,\nand they rose up in front of the background of the mountain, they seemed,\nindeed, as if they were part of it,–as if they belonged to some natural\ncreation.”",
        "But I must not indulge myself in more quotations, though it is difficult\nto stop. Such extracts recall the memory of many glorious days: for the\nadvantages of travel last through life; and often, as we sit at home,\n\"some bright and perfect view of Venice, of Genoa, or of Monte Rosa comes\nback on you, as full of repose as a day wisely spent in travel.” [4]",
        "So far is a thorough love and enjoyment of travel from interfering with\nthe love of home, that perhaps no one can thoroughly enjoy his home who\ndoes not sometimes wander away. They are like exertion and rest, each the\ncomplement of the other; so that, though it may seem paradoxical, one of\nthe greatest pleasures of travel is the return; and no one who has not\nroamed abroad, can realize the devotion which the wanderer feels for\nDomiduca–the sweet and gentle goddess who watches over our coming home.",

        "It may well be doubted which is more delightful,–to start for a holiday\nwhich has been fully earned, or to return home from one which has been\nthoroughly enjoyed; to find oneself, with renewed vigor, with a fresh\nstore of memories and ideas, back once more by one’s own fireside, with\none’s family, friends, and books.",
        "“To sit at home,” says Leigh Hunt, “with an old folio (?) book of romantic\nyet credible voyages and travels to read, an old bearded traveller for its\nhero, a fireside in an old country house to read it by, curtains drawn,\nand just wind enough stirring out of doors to make an accompaniment to the\nbillows or forests we are reading of–this surely is one of the perfect\nmoments of existence.”",
        "It is no doubt a great privilege to visit foreign countries; to travel say\nin Mexico or Peru, or to cruise among the Pacific Islands; but in some\nrespects the narratives of early travellers, the histories of Prescott or\nthe voyages of Captain Cook, are even more interesting; describing to us,\nas they do, a state of society which was then so unlike ours, but which\nhas now been much changed and Europeanized.",
        "Thus we may make our daily travels interesting, even though, like those of\nthe Vicar of Wakefield, all our adventures are by our own fireside, and\nall our migrations from one room to another.",

        "It is, then, wise to “cultivate a talent very fortunate for a man of my\ndisposition, that of travelling in my easy chair; of transporting myself,\nwithout stirring from my parlor, to distant places and to absent friends;\nof drawing scenes in my mind’s eye; and of peopling them with the groups\nof fancy, or the society of remembrance.” [2]",

        "In the first place, the succession of seasons multiplies every home. How\ndifferent is the view from our windows as we look on the tender green of\nspring, the rich foliage of summer, the glorious tints of autumn, or the\ndelicate tracery of winter.",
        "Our climate is so happy, that even in the worst months of the year, “calm\nmornings of sunshine visit us at times, appearing like glimpses of\ndeparted spring amid the wilderness of wet and windy days that lead to\nwinter. It is pleasant, when these interludes of silver light occur, to\nride into the woods and see how wonderful are all the colors of decay.\nOverhead, the elms and chestnuts hang their wealth of golden leaves, while\nthe beeches darken into russet tones, and the wild cherry glows like\nblood-red wine. In the hedges crimson haws and scarlet hips are wreathed\nwith hoary clematis or necklaces of coral briony-berries; the brambles\nburn with many-colored flames; the dog-wood is bronzed to purple; and here\nand there the spindle-wood puts forth its fruit, like knots of rosy buds,\non delicate frail twigs. Underneath lie fallen leaves, and the brown brake\nrises to our knees as we thread the forest paths.” [3]",
        "Nay, every day gives us a succession of glorious pictures in never-ending\nvariety. It is remarkable how few people seem to derive any pleasure from\nthe beauty of the sky. Gray, after describing a sunrise–how it began with\na slight whitening, just tinged with gold and blue, lit up all at once by\na little line of insufferable brightness which rapidly grew to half an\norb, and so to a whole one too glorious to be distinctly seen–adds, “I\nwonder whether any one ever saw it before. I hardly believe it.” [4]",
        "No doubt from the dawn of poetry, the splendors of the morning and evening\nskies have delighted all those who have eyes to see. But we are especially\nindebted to Ruskin for enabling us more vividly to realize these glorious\nsky pictures. As he says, in language almost as brilliant as the sky\nitself, the whole heaven, “from the zenith to the horizon, becomes one\nmolten, mantling sea of color and fire; every block bar turns into massy\ngold, every ripple and wave into unsullied, shadowless crimson, and\npurple, and scarlet, and colors for which there are no words in language,\nand no ideas in the mind–things which can only be conceived while they\nare visible; the intense hollow blue of the upper sky melting through it\nall, showing here deep and pure, and lightness; there, modulated by the\nfilmy, formless body of the transparent vapor, till it is lost\nimperceptibly in its crimson and gold.”",
        "It is in some cases indeed “not color but conflagration,” and though the\ntints are richer and more varied toward morning and at sunset, the\nglorious kaleidoscope goes on all day long. Yet “it is a strange thing how\nlittle in general people know about the sky. It is the part of creation in\nwhich Nature has done more for the sake of pleasing man, more for the sole\nand evident purpose of talking to him, and teaching him, than in any other\nof her works, and it is just the part in which we least attend to her.\nThere are not many of her other works in which some more material or\nessential purpose than the mere pleasing of man is not answered by every\npart of their organization; but every essential purpose of the sky might,\nso far as we know, be answer, if once in three days, or thereabouts, a\ngreat, ugly, black rain-cloud were brought up over the blue, and\neverything well watered, and so all left blue again till next time, with\nperhaps a film of morning and evening mist for dew. And instead of this,\nthere is not a moment of any day of our lives when Nature is not producing\nscene after scene, picture after picture, glory after glory, and working\nstill upon such exquisite and constant principles of the most perfect\nbeauty, that it is quite certain it is all done for us, and intended for\nour perpetual pleasure.” [5]",
        "Nor does the beauty end with the day. “It is nothing to sleep under the\ncanopy of heaven, where we have the globe of the earth for our place of\nrepose, and the glories of the heavens for our spectacle?” [6] For my part\nI always regret the custom of shutting up our rooms in the evening, as\nthough there was nothing worth seeing outside. What, however, can be more\nbeautiful than to “look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with\npatines of bright gold,” or to watch the moon journeying in calm and\nsilver glory through the night. And even if we do not feel that “the man\nwho has seen the rising moon break out of the clouds at midnight, has been\npresent like an Archangel at the creation of light and of the world,” [7]\nstill “the stars say something significant to all of us: and each man has\na whole hemisphere of them, if he will but look up, to counsel and\nbefriend him\"; [8] for it is not so much, as Helps elsewhere observes, “in\nguiding us over the seas of our little planet, but out of the dark waters\nof our own perturbed minds, that we may make to ourselves the most of\ntheir significance.” Indeed,",
        "     “How beautiful is night!\n    A dewy freshness fills the silent air;\n  No mist obscures, nor cloud, nor speck, nor stain,\n      Breaks the serene of heaven:\n    In full-orbed glory yonder moon divine\n    Rolls through the dark blue depths;\n     Beneath her steady ray\n     The desert circle spreads,\n  Like the round ocean, girdled with the sky;\n      How beautiful is night!” [9]",

        "In few respects has mankind made a greater advance than in the relations\nof men and women. It is terrible to think how women suffer in savage life;\nand even among the intellectual Greeks, with rare exceptions, they seem to\nhave been treated rather as housekeepers or playthings than as the Angels\nwho make a Heaven of home.",

        "In The Origin of Civilization I have given many cases showing how small\na part family affection plays in savage life. Here I will only mention one\ncase in illustration. The Algonquin (North America) language contained no\nword for “to love,” so that when the missionaries translated the Bible\ninto it they were obliged to invent one. What a life, and what a language,\nwithout love.",
        "Yet in marriage even the rough passion of a savage may contrast favorably\nwith any cold calculation, which, like the enchanted hoard of the\nNibelungs, is almost sure to bring misfortune. In the Kalevala, the\nFinnish epic, the divine smith, Ilmarinnen, forges a bride of gold and\nsilver for Wainamoinen, who was pleased at first to have so rich a wife,\nbut soon found her intolerably cold, for, in spite of fires and furs,\nwhenever he touched her she froze him.",
        "Moreover, apart from mere coldness, how much we suffer from foolish\nquarrels about trifles; from mere misunderstandings; from hasty words\nthoughtlessly repeated, sometimes without the context or tone which would\nhave deprived them of any sting. How much would that charity which\n\"beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all\nthings,” effect to smooth away the sorrows of life and add to the\nhappiness of home. Home indeed may be a sure haven of repose from the\nstorms and perils of the world. But to secure this we must not be content\nto pave it with good intentions, but must make it bright and cheerful.",

Game is gradually becoming “small by degrees and\nbeautifully less.” Our prehistoric ancestors hunted the mammoth, the\nwoolly-haired rhinoceros, and Irish elk; the ancient Britons had the wild\nox, the deer, and the wolf. We have still the pheasant, the partridge, the\nfox, and the hare; but even these are becoming scarcer, and must be\npreserved first, in order that they may be killed afterwards.

Its slopes are\ncovered with plantations of beech and fir, so as to shelter the pond on\nthree sides, and yet leave it open to the soft south-western breezes, and\nto the afternoon sun. At the head of the combe wells up a clear spring,\nwhich sends a thread of water, trickling through a bed of osiers, into the\nupper end of the pond. A stout stone wall has been drawn across the combe\nfrom side to side, so as to dam up the stream; and there is a gap in one\ncorner through which the overflow finds its way in a miniature cascade,\ndown into the lower plantation.",
        "“If we approach the pond by the gamekeeper’s path from the cottage above,\nwe shall pass through the plantation, and come unseen right on the corner\nof the wall; so that one quiet step will enable us to see at a glance its\nwhole surface, without disturbing any living thing that may be there.",
        "“Far off at the upper end a water-hen is leading her little brood among\nthe willows; on the fallen trunk of an old beech, lying half way across\nthe pond, a vole is sitting erect, rubbing his right ear, and the splash\nof a beech husk just at our feet tells of a squirrel who is dining\nsomewhere in the leafy crown above us.",

The water-hen has long ago got under cover, and the\nsquirrel drops no more husks. It is a true Silent Pond, and without a sign\nof life.",
        "“But if, retaining sense and sight, we could shrink into living atoms and\nplunge under the water, of what a world of wonders should we then form\npart! We should find this fairy kingdom peopled with the strangest\ncreatures–creatures that swim with their hair, that have ruby eyes\nblazing deep in their necks, with telescopic limbs that now are withdrawn\nwholly within their bodies and now stretched out to many times their own\nlength. Here are some riding at anchor, moored by delicate threads spun\nout from their toes; and there are others flashing by in glass armor,\nbristling with sharp spikes or ornamented with bosses and flowing curves;\nwhile fastened to a great stem is an animal convolvulus that, by some\ninvisible power, draws a never-ceasing stream of victims into its gaping\ncup, and tears them to death with hooked jaws deep down within its body.",
        "“Close by it, on the same stem, is something that looks like a filmy\nheart’s-ease. A curious wheelwork runs round its four outspread petals;\nand a chain of minute things, living and dead, is winding in and out of\ntheir curves into a gulf at the back of the flower. What happens to them\nthere we cannot see; for round the stem is raised a tube of golden-brown\nballs, all regularly piled on each other. Some creature dashes by, and\nlike a flash the flower vanishes within its tube.",
        "“We sink still lower, and now see on the bottom slow gliding lumps of\njelly that thrust a shapeless arm out where they will, and grasping their\nprey with these chance limbs, wrap themselves round their food to get a\nmeal; for they creep without feet, seize without hands, eat without\nmouths, and digest without stomachs.”",
        "Too many, however, still feel only in Nature that which we share “with the\nweed and the worm;” they love birds as boys do–that is, they love\nthrowing stones at them; or wonder if they are good to eat, as the\nEsquimaux asked about the watch; or treat them as certain devout Afreedee\nvillagers are said to have treated a descendant of the Prophet–killed him\nin order to worship at his tomb: but gradually we may hope that the love\nof Science–the notes “we sound upon the strings of nature” [2]–will\nbecome to more and more, as already it is to many, a “faithful and sacred\nelement of human feeling.”",

        "  “To that cathedral, boundless as our wonder,\n     Whose quenchless lamps the sun and moon supply;\n  Its choir the winds and waves, its organ thunder,\n                       Its dome the sky.” [3]",
        "Where the untrained eye will see nothing but mire and dirt, Science will\noften reveal exquisite possibilities. The mud we tread under our feet in\nthe street is a grimy mixture of clay and sand, soot and water. Separate\nthe sand, however, as Ruskin observes–let the atoms arrange themselves in\npeace according to their nature–and you have the opal. Separate the clay,\nand it becomes a white earth, fit for the finest porcelain; or if it still\nfurther purifies itself, you have a sapphire. Take the soot, and if\nproperly treated it will give you a diamond. While, lastly, the water,\npurified and distilled, will become a dew-drop, or crystallize into a\nlovely star. Or, again, you may see as you will in any shallow pool either\nthe mud lying at the bottom, or the image of the heavens above.",
        "Nay, even if we imagine beauties and charms which do not really exist;\nstill if we err at all it is better to do so on the side of charity; like\nNasmyth, who tells us in his delightful autobiography, that he used to\nthink one of his friends had a charming and kindly twinkle, and was one\nday surprised to discover that he had a glass eye.",
        "But I should err indeed were I to dwell exclusively on science as lending\ninterest and charm to our leisure hours. Far from this, it would be\nimpossible to overrate the importance of scientific training on the wise\nconduct of life.",
        "“Science,” said the Royal Commission of 1861, “quickens and cultivates\ndirectly the faculty of observation, which in very many persons lies\nalmost dormant through life, the power of accurate and rapid\ngeneralization, and the mental habit of method and arrangement; it\naccustoms young persons to trace the sequence of cause and effect; it\nfamiliarizes them with a kind of reasoning which interests them, and which\nthey can promptly comprehend; and it is perhaps the best corrective for\nthat indolence which is the vice of half-awakened minds, and which shrinks\nfrom any exertion that is not, like an effort of memory, merely\nmechanical.”",
        "Again, when we contemplate the grandeur of science, if we transport\nourselves in imagination back into primeval times, or away into the\nimmensity of space, our little troubles and sorrows seem to shrink into\ninsignificance. “Ah, beautiful creations!” says Helps, speaking of the\nstars, “it is not in guiding us over the seas of our little planet, but\nout of the dark waters of our own perturbed minds, that we may make to\nourselves the most of your significance.” They teach, he tells us\nelsewhere, “something significant to all of us; and each man has a whole\nhemisphere of them, if he will but look up, to counsel and befriend him.”",

        "“Suppose,” he said, “it were perfectly certain that the life and fortune\nof every one of us would, one day or other, depend upon his winning or\nlosing a game of chess. Don’t you think that we should all consider it to\nbe a primary duty to learn at least the names and the moves of the pieces?\nDo you not think that we should look with a disapprobation amounting to\nscorn upon the father who allowed his son, or the State which allowed its\nmembers, to grow up without knowing a pawn from a knight? Yet it is a very\nplain and elementary truth that the life, the fortune, and the happiness\nof every one of us, and more or less of those who are connected with us,\ndo depend upon our knowing something of the rules of a game infinitely\nmore difficult and complicated than chess. It is a game which has been\nplayed for untold ages, every man and woman of us being one of the two\nplayers in a game of his or her own. The chessboard is the world, the\npieces are the phenomena of the Universe, the rules of the game are what\nwe call the laws of Nature. The player on the other side is hidden from\nus. We know that his play is always fair, just, and patient. But also we\nknow to our cost that he never overlooks a mistake or makes the smallest\nallowance for ignorance. To the man who plays well the highest stakes are\npaid, with that sort of overflowing generosity which with the strong shows\ndelight in strength. And one who plays ill is checkmated–without haste,\nbut without remorse.”",
        "I have elsewhere endeavored to show the purifying and ennobling influence\nof science upon religion; how it has assisted, if indeed it may not claim\nthe main share, in sweeping away the dark superstitions, the degrading\nbelief in sorcery and witchcraft, and the cruel, however well-intentioned,\nintolerance which embittered the Christian world almost from the very days\nof the Apostles themselves. In this she has surely performed no mean\nservice to religion itself. As Canon Fremantle has well and justly said,\nmen of science, and not the clergy only, are ministers of religion.",
        "Again, the national necessity for scientific education is imperative. We\nare apt to forget how much we owe to science, because so many of its\nwonderful gifts have become familiar parts of our everyday life, that\ntheir very value makes us forget their origin. At the recent celebration\nof the sexcentenary of Peterhouse College, near the close of a long\ndinner, Sir Frederick Bramwell was called on, some time after midnight, to\nreturn thanks for Applied Science. He excused himself from making a long\nspeech on the ground that, though the subject was almost inexhaustible,\nthe only illustration which struck him as appropriate under the\ncircumstances was “the application of the domestic lucifer to the bedroom\ncandle.” One cannot but feel how unfortunate was the saying of the poet\nthat",
        "  “The light-outspeeding telegraph\n  Bears nothing on its beam.”",
        "The report of the Royal Commission on Technical Instruction, which has\nrecently been issued, teems with illustrations of the advantages afforded\nby technical instruction. At the same time, technical training ought not\nto begin too soon, for, as Bain truly observes, “in a right view of\nscientific education the first principles and leading examples, with\nselect details, of all the great sciences, are the proper basis of the\ncomplete and exhaustive study of any single science.” Indeed, in the words\nof Sir John Herschel, “it can hardly be pressed forcibly enough on the\nattention of the student of Nature, that there is scarcely any natural\nphenomenon which can be fully and completely explained in all its\ncircumstances, without a union of several, perhaps of all, the sciences.\"\nThe most important secrets of Nature are often hidden away in unexpected\nplaces. Many valuable substances have been discovered in the refuse of\nmanufactories; and it was a happy thought of Glauber to examine what\neverybody else threw away. There is perhaps no nation the future happiness\nand prosperity of which depend more on science than our own. Our\npopulation is over 35,000,000, and is rapidly increasing. Even at present\nit is far larger than our acreage can support. Few people whose business\ndoes not lie in the study of statistics realize that we have to pay\nforeign countries no less than L140,000,000 a year for food. This, of\ncourse, we purchase mainly by manufactured articles. We hear now a great\ndeal about depression of trade, and foreign, especially American,\ncompetition, which, let me observe, will be much keener a few years hence,\nwhen the United States have paid off their debt, and consequently reduced\ntaxation.",
        "But let us look forward a hundred years–no long time in the history of a\nnation. Our coal supplies will then be greatly diminished. The population\nof Great Britain doubles at the present rate of increase in about fifty\nyears, so that we should, if the present rate continues, require to import\nover L400,000,000 a year in food. How, then, is this to be paid for? We\nhave before us, as usual, three courses. The natural rate of increase may\nbe stopped, which means suffering and outrage; or the population may\nincrease, only to vegetate in misery and destitution; or, lastly, by the\ndevelopment of scientific training and appliances, they may probably be\nmaintained in happiness and comfort. We have, in fact, to make our choice\nbetween science and suffering. It is only by wisely utilizing the gifts of\nscience that we have any hope of maintaining our population in plenty and\ncomfort. Science, however, will do this for us if we will only let her.\nShe may be no Fairy Godmother indeed, but she will richly endow those who\nlove her.",
        "That discoveries, innumerable, marvellous, and fruitful, await the\nsuccessful explorers of Nature no one can doubt. What would one not give\nfor a Science primer of the next century? for, to paraphrase a well-known\nsaying, even the boy at the plough will then know more of science than the\nwisest of our philosophers do now. Boyle entitled one of his essays “Of\nMan’s great Ignorance of the Uses of Natural Things; or that there is no\none thing in Nature whereof the uses to human life are yet thoroughly\nunderstood\"–a saying which is still as true now as when it was written.\nAnd, lest I should be supposed to be taking too sanguine a view, let me\ngive the authority of Sir John Herschel, who says: “Since it cannot but be\nthat innumerable and most important uses remain to be discovered among the\nmaterials and objects already known to us, as well as among those which\nthe progress of science must hereafter disclose, we may hence conceive a\nwell-grounded expectation, not only of constant increase in the physical\nresources of mankind, and the consequent improvement of their condition,\nbut of continual accession to our power of penetrating into the arcana of\nNature and becoming acquainted with her highest laws.”",
        "Nor is it merely in a material point of view that science would thus\nbenefit the nation. She will raise and strengthen the national, as surely\nas the individual, character. The great gift which Minerva offered to\nParis is now freely tendered to all, for we may apply to the nation, as\nwell as to the individual, Tennyson’s noble lines:–",
        "  “Self-reverence, self-knowledge, self-control:\n  These three alone lead life to sovereign power,\n  Yet not for power (power of herself\n  Would come uncalled for), but to live by law;\n  Acting the law we live by without fear.”",
        "“In the vain and foolish exultation of the heart,” said John Quincy Adams,\nat the close of his final lecture on resigning his chair at Boston, “which\nthe brighter prospects of life will sometimes excite, the pensive portress\nof Science shall call you to the sober pleasures of her holy cell. In the\nmortification of disappointment, her soothing voice shall whisper serenity\nand peace. In social converse with the mighty dead of ancient days, you\nwill never smart under the galling sense of dependence upon the mighty\nliving of the present age. And in your struggles with the world, should a\ncrisis ever occur, when even friendship may deem it prudent to desert you,\nwhen priest and Levite shall come and look on you and pass by on the other\nside, seek refuge, my unfailing friends, and be assured you shall find it,\nin the friendship of Laelius and Scipio, in the patriotism of Cicero,\nDemosthenes, and Burke, as well as in the precepts and example of Him\nwhose law is love, and who taught us to remember injuries only to forgive\nthem.”",
        "Let me in conclusion quote the glowing description of our debt to science\ngiven by Archdeacon Farrar in his address at Liverpool College–testimony,\nmoreover, all the more valuable, considering the source from which it\ncomes.",
        "“In this great commercial city,” he said, “where you are surrounded by the\ntriumphs of science and of mechanism–you, whose river is ploughed by the\ngreat steamships whose white wake has been called the fittest avenue to\nthe palace front of a mercantile people–you know well that in the\nachievements of science there is not only beauty and wonder, but also\nbeneficence and power. It is not only that she has revealed to us infinite\nspace crowded with unnumbered worlds; infinite time peopled by unnumbered\nexistences; infinite organisms hitherto invisible but full of delicate and\niridescent loveliness; but also that she has been, as a great Archangel of\nMercy, devoting herself to the service of man. She has labored, her\nvotaries have labored, not to increase the power of despots or to add to\nthe magnificence of courts, but to extend human happiness, to economize\nhuman effort, to extinguish human pain. Where of old, men toiled, half\nblinded and half naked, in the mouth of the glowing furnace to mix the\nwhite-hot iron, she now substitutes the mechanical action of the viewless\nair. She has enlisted the sunbeam in her service to limn for us, with\nabsolute fidelity, the faces of the friends we love. She has shown the\npoor miner how he may work in safety, even amid the explosive fire-damp of\nthe mine. She hits, by her anaesthetics, enabled the sufferer to be hushed\nand unconscious while the delicate hand of some skilled operator cuts a\nfragment from the nervous circle of the unquivering eye. She points not to\npyramids built during weary centuries by the sweat of miserable nations,\nbut to the lighthouse and the steamship, to the railroad and the\ntelegraph. She has restored eyes to the blind and hearing to the deaf. She\nhas lengthened life, she has minimized danger, she has controlled madness,\nshe has trampled on disease. And on all these grounds, I think that none\nof our sons should grow up wholly ignorant of studies which at once train\nthe reason and fire the imagination, which fashion as well as forge, which\ncan feed as well as fill the mind.”",

        "It may seem rather surprising to include education among the pleasures of\nlife; for in too many cases it is made odious to the young, and is\nsupposed to cease with school; while, on the contrary, if it is to be\nreally successful it must be suitable, and therefore interesting, to\nchildren, and must last through life. The very process of acquiring\nknowledge is a privilege and a blessing. It used to be said that there was\nno royal road to learning; it would be more true to say that the avenues\nleading to it are all royal.",
        "“It is not,” says Jeremy Taylor, “the eye that sees the beauties of\nheaven, nor the ear that hears the sweetness of music, or the glad tidings\nof a prosperous accident; but the soul that perceives all the relishes of\nsensual and intellectual perceptions: and the more noble and excellent the\nsoul is, the greater and more savory are its perceptions. And if a child\nbehold the rich ermine, or the diamonds of a starry night, or the order of\nthe world, or hears the discourses of an apostle; because he makes no\nreflex act on himself and sees not what he sees, he can have but the\npleasure of a fool or the deliciousness of a mule.”",
        "Herein lies the importance of education. I say education rather than\ninstruction, because it is far more important to cultivate the mind than\nto store the memory. Studies are a means and not an end. “To spend too\nmuch time in studies is sloth; to use them too much for ornament is\naffectation; to make judgment wholly by their rules is the humor of a\nscholar: they perfect nature, and are perfected by experience.... Crafty\nmen contemn studies, simple men admire them, and wise men use them.” [1]",
        "Moreover, though, as Mill says, “in the comparatively early state of human\ndevelopment in which we now live, a person cannot indeed feel that\nentireness of sympathy with all others which would make any real\ndiscordance in the general direction of their conduct in life impossible,\"\nyet education might surely do more to root in us the feeling of unity with\nour fellow-creatures. At any rate, if we do not study in this spirit, all\nour learning will but leave us as weak and sad as Faust.",

        "Our studies should be neither “a couch on which to rest; nor a cloister in\nwhich to promenade alone; nor a tower from which to look down on others;\nnor a fortress whence we may resist them; nor a workshop for gain and\nmerchandise; but a rich armory and treasury for the glory of the creator\nand the ennoblement of life.” [3]",

        "It is then of great importance to consider whether our present system of\neducation is the one best calculated to fulfil these great objects.

In\ncheerfulness, says Pliny, is the success of our studies–\"studia\nhilaritate proveniunt\"–and we may with advantage take a lesson from\nTheognis, who, in his Ode on the Marriage of Cadmus and Harmonia, makes\nthe Muses sing:",

        "This is no new complaint. Ascham, in The Schoolmaster, long ago lamented\nit; Milton, in his letter to Mr. Samuel Hartlib, complained “that our\nchildren are forced to stick unreasonably in these grammatick flats and\nshallows;” and observes that, “though a linguist should pride himself to\nhave all the tongues Babel cleft the world into, yet, if he have not\nstudied the solid things in them as well as the words and lexicons, he\nwere nothing so much to be esteemed a learned man as any yeoman or\ntradesman competently wise in his mother dialect only;” and Locke said\nthat “schools fit us for the university rather than for the world.\"\nCommission after commission, committee after committee, have reiterated\nthe same complaint. How then do we stand now?",
        "I see it indeed constantly stated that, even if the improvement is not so\nrapid as could be desired, still we are making considerable progress. But\nis this so? I fear not. I fear that our present system does not really\ntrain the mind, or cultivate the power of observation, or even give the\namount of information which we may reasonably expect from the time devoted\nto it.",
        "Sir M. E. Grant-Duff has expressed the opinion that a boy or girl of\nfourteen might reasonably be expected to “read aloud clearly and\nagreeably, to write a large distinct round hand, and to know the ordinary\nrules of arithmetic, especially compound addition–a by no means universal\naccomplishment; to speak and write French with ease and correctness, and\nhave some slight acquaintance with French literature; to translate ad\naperturam libri from an ordinary French or German book; to have a\nthoroughly good elementary knowledge of geography, under which are\ncomprehended some notions of astronomy–enough to excite his curiosity; a\nknowledge of the very broadest facts of geology and history–enough to\nmake him understand, in a clear but perfectly general way, how the larger\nfeatures of the world he lives in, physical and political, came to be like\nwhat they are; to have been trained from earliest infancy to use his\npowers of observation on plants, or animals, or rocks, or other natural\nobjects; and to have gathered a general acquaintance with what is most\nsupremely good in that portion of the more important English classics\nwhich is suitable to his time of life; to have some rudimentary\nacquaintance with drawing and music.”",
        "To effect this, no doubt, “industry must be our oracle, and reason our\nApollo,” as Sir T. Browne says; but surely it is no unreasonable estimate;\nyet how far do we fall short of it? General culture is often deprecated\nbecause it is said that smatterings are useless. But there is all the\ndifference in the world between having a smattering of, or being well\ngrounded in, a subject. It is the latter which we advocate–to try to\nknow, as Lord Brougham well said, “everything of something, and something\nof everything.”",
        "“It can hardly,” says Sir John Herschel, “be pressed forcibly enough on\nthe attention of the student of nature, that there is scarcely any natural\nphenomenon which can be fully and completely explained, in all its\ncircumstances, without a union of several, perhaps of all, the sciences.”",
        "The present system in most of our public schools and colleges sacrifices\neverything else to classics and arithmetic. They are most important\nsubjects, but ought not to exclude science and modern languages. Moreover,\nafter all, our sons leave college unable to speak either Latin or Greek,\nand too often absolutely without any interest in classical history or\nliterature. But the boy who has been educated without any training in\nscience has grave reason to complain of “knowledge to one entrance quite\nshut out.”",
        "By concentrating the attention, indeed, so much on one or two subjects, we\ndefeat our own object, and produce a feeling of distaste where we wish to\ncreate an interest.",
        "Our great mistake in education is, as it seems to me, the worship of\nbook-learning–the confusion of instruction and education. We strain the\nmemory instead of cultivating the mind. The children in our elementary\nschools are wearied by the mechanical act of writing, and the interminable\nintricacies of spelling; they are oppressed by columns of dates, by lists\nof kings and places, which convey no definite idea to their minds, and\nhave no near relation to their daily wants and occupations; while in our\npublic schools the same unfortunate results are produced by the weary\nmonotony of Latin and Greek grammar. We ought to follow exactly the\nopposite course with children–to give them a wholesome variety of mental\nfood, and endeavor to cultivate their tastes, rather than to fill their\nminds with dry facts. The important thing is not so much that every child\nshould be taught, as that every child should be given the wish to learn.\nWhat does it matter if the pupil know a little more or a little less? A\nboy who leaves school knowing much, but hating his lessons, will soon have\nforgotten almost all he ever learned; while another who had acquired a\nthirst for knowledge, even if he had learned little, would soon teach\nhimself more than the first ever knew. Children are by nature eager for\ninformation. They are always putting questions. This ought to be\nencouraged. In fact, we may to a great extent trust to their instincts,\nand in that case they will do much to educate themselves. Too often,\nhowever, the acquirement of knowledge is placed before them in a form so\nirksome and fatiguing that all desire for information is choked, or even\ncrushed out; so that our schools, in fact, become places for the\ndiscouragement of learning, and thus produce the very opposite effect from\nthat at which we aim. In short, children should be trained to observe and\nto think, for in that way there would be opened out to them a source of\nthe purest enjoyment for leisure hours, and the wisest judgment in the\nwork of life.",
        "Another point in which I venture to think that our system of education\nmight be amended, is that it tends at present to give the impression that\neverything is known.",
        "Dr. Busby is said to have kept his hat on in the presence of King Charles,\nthat the boys might see what a great man he was. I doubt, however, whether\nthe boys were deceived by the hat; and am very skeptical about Dr. Busby’s\ntheory of education.",
        "Master John of Basingstoke, who was Archdeacon of Leicester in 1252,\nlearned Greek during a visit to Athens, from Constantina, daughter of the\nArchbishop of Athens, and used to say afterwards that though he had\nstudied well and diligently at the University of Paris, yet he learned\nmore from an Athenian maiden of twenty. We cannot all study so pleasantly\nas this, but the main fault I find with Dr. Busby’s system is that it\nkeeps out of sight the great fact of human ignorance.",
        "Boys are given the impression that the masters know everything. If, on the\ncontrary, the great lesson impressed on them was that what we know is as\nnothing to what we do not know, that the “great ocean of truth lies all\nundiscovered before us,” surely this would prove a great stimulus, and\nmany would be nobly anxious to enlarge the boundaries of human knowledge,\nand extend the intellectual kingdom of man. Philosophy, says Aristotle,\nbegins in wonder, for Iris is the child of Thaumas.",
        "Education ought not to cease when we leave school; but if well begun\nthere, will continue through life.",
        "Moreover, whatever our occupation or profession in life may be, it is most\ndesirable to create for ourselves some other special interest. In the\nchoice of a subject every one should consult his own instincts and\ninterests, I will not attempt to suggest whether it is better to pursue\nart or science; whether we should study the motes in the sunbeam, or the\nheavenly bodies themselves. Whatever may be the subject of our choice, we\nshall find enough, and more than enough, to repay the devotion of a\nlifetime. Life no doubt is paved with enjoyments, but we must all expect\ntimes of anxiety, of suffering, and of sorrow; and when these come it is\nan inestimable comfort to have some deep interest which will, at any rate\nto some extent, enable us to escape from ourselves.",
        "“A cultivated mind,” says Mill–\"I do not mean that of a philosopher, but\nany mind to which the fountains of knowledge have been opened, and which\nhas been taught in any tolerable degree to exercise its faculties–will\nfind sources of inexhaustible interest in all that surrounds it; in the\nobjects of nature, the achievements of art, the imaginations of poetry,\nthe incidents of history, the ways of mankind, past and present, and their\nprospects in the future.

        "Ambition often takes the form of a love of money. There are many who have\nnever attempted Art or Music, Poetry or Science; but most people do\nsomething for a livelihood, and consequently an increase of income is not\nonly acceptable in itself, but gives a pleasant feeling of success.",
        "Doubt is often expressed whether wealth is any advantage. I do not myself\nbelieve that those who are born, as the saying is, with a silver spoon in\ntheir mouth, are necessarily any the happier for it. No doubt wealth\nentails almost more labor than poverty, and certainly more anxiety. Still\nit must, I think, be confessed that the possession of an income, whatever\nit may be, which increases somewhat as the years roll on, does add to the\ncomfort of life.",
        "Unquestionably the possession of wealth is by no means unattended by\ndrawbacks. Money and the love of money often go together. The poor man, as\nEmerson says, is the man who wishes to be rich; and the more a man has,\nthe more he often longs to be richer. Just as drinking often does but\nincrease thirst; so in many cases the craving for riches does grow with\nwealth.",
        "This is, of course, especially the case when money is sought for its own\nsake. Moreover, it is often easier to make money than to keep or to enjoy\nit. Keeping it is dull and anxious drudgery. The dread of loss may hang\nlike a dark cloud over life. Apicius, when he squandered most of his\npatrimony, but had still 250,000 crowns left, committed suicide, as Seneca\ntells us, for fear he should die of hunger.",

The\nsame, however, might be said of most other opportunities and privileges;\nKnowledge and Strength, Beauty and Skill, may all be abused; if we neglect\nor misuse them we are worse off than if we had never had them. Wealth is\nonly a disadvantage in the hands of those who do not know how to use it.\nIt gives the command of so many other things–leisure, the power of\nhelping friends, books, works of art, opportunities and means of travel.",
        "It would, however, be easy to exaggerate the advantages of money. It is\nwell worth having, and worth working for, but it does not requite too\ngreat a sacrifice; not indeed so great as is often offered up to it. A\nwise proverb tells us that gold may be bought too dear. If wealth is to be\nvalued because it gives leisure, clearly it would be a mistake to\nsacrifice leisure in the struggle for wealth. Money has no doubt also a\ntendency to make men poor in spirit. But, on the other hand, what gift is\nthere which is without danger?",

The commons, and roads, and footpaths, and the seashore,\nour grand and varied coast–these are all ours. The sea-coast has,\nmoreover, two great advantages. In the first place, it is for the most\npart but little interfered with by man, and in the second it exhibits most\ninstructively the forces of Nature. We are all great landed proprietors,\nif we only knew it. What we lack is not land, but the power to enjoy it.\nMoreover, this great inheritance has the additional advantage that it\nentails no labor, requires no management.

        "We scarcely realize, I think, how much we owe to Doctors. Our system of\nMedicine seems so natural and obvious that it hardly occurs to us as\nsomewhat new and exceptional. When we are ill we send for a Physician; he\nprescribes some medicine; we take it, and pay his fee. But among the lower\nraces of men pain and illness are often attributed to the presence of evil\nspirits. The Medicine Man is a Priest, or rather a Sorcerer, more than a\ntrue Doctor, and his effort is to exorcise the evil spirit.",
        "In other countries where some advance has been made, a charm is written on\na board, washed off, and drunk. In some cases the medicine is taken, not\nby the patient, but by the Doctor. Such a system, however, is generally\ntransient; it is naturally discouraged by the Profession, and is indeed\nincompatible with a large practice. Even as regards the payment we find\nvery different systems. The Chinese pay their medical man as long as they\nare well, and stop his salary as soon as they are ill. In ancient Egypt we\nare told that the patient feed the Doctor for the first few days, after\nwhich the Doctor paid the patient until he made him well. This is a\nfascinating system, but might afford too much temptation to heroic\nremedies.",

Many, indeed, deliberately ruin their own\nhealth, and incur the certainty of an early grave, or an old age of\nsuffering.",
        "No doubt some inherit a constitution which renders health almost\nunattainable. Pope spoke of that long disease, his life. Many indeed may\nsay, “I suffer, therefore I am.” But happily these cases are exceptional.\nMost of us might be well, if we would. It is very much our own fault that\nwe are ill. We do those things which we ought not to do, and we leave\nundone those things which we ought to have done, and then we wonder there\nis no health in us.",
        "We all know that we can make ourselves ill, but few perhaps realize how\nmuch we can do to keep ourselves well. Much of our suffering is\nself-inflicted. It has been observed that among the ancient Egyptians the\nchief aim of life seemed to be to be well buried. Many, however, live even\nnow as if this were the principal object of their existence.",

        "I am inclined to doubt whether the study of health is sufficiently\nimpressed on the minds of those entering life. Not that it is desirable to\npotter over minor ailments, to con over books on illnesses, or experiment\non ourselves with medicine. Far from it. The less we fancy ourselves ill,\nor bother about little bodily discomforts, the more likely perhaps we are\nto preserve our health.",
        "It is, however, a different matter to study the general conditions of\nhealth. A well-known proverb tells us that every one is a fool or a\nphysician at forty. Unfortunately, however, many persons are invalids at\nforty as well as physicians.",
        "Ill-health, however, is no excuse for moroseness. If we have one disease\nwe may at least congratulate ourselves that we are escaping all the rest.\nSydney Smith, ever ready to look on the bright side of things, once, when\nborne down by suffering, wrote to a friend that he had gout, asthma, and\nseven other maladies, but was “otherwise very well;” and many of the\ngreatest invalids have borne their sufferings with cheerfulness and good\nspirits.",

Of this, Alcestis, the\ndaughter of Pelias, is a monument to all Hellas; for she was willing to\nlay down her life on behalf of her husband, when no one else would,\nalthough he had a father and mother; but the tenderness of her love so far\nexceeded theirs, that she made them seem to be strangers in blood to their\nown son, and in name only related to him; and so noble did this action of\nhers appear to the gods, as well as to men, that among the many who have\ndone virtuously she is one of the very few to whom they have granted the\nprivilege of returning to earth, in admiration of her virtue; such\nexceeding honor is paid by them to the devotion and virtue of love.”",

        "The original human nature, he says, was not like the present. The Primeval\nMan was round, [7] his back and sides forming a circle; and he had four\nhands and four feet, one head with two faces, looking opposite ways, set\non a round neck and precisely alike. He could walk upright as men now do,\nbackward or forward as he pleased, and he could also roll over and over at\na great rate, whirling round on his four hands and four feet, eight in\nall, like tumblers going over and over with their legs in the air; this\nwas when he wanted to run fast. Terrible was their might and strength, and\nthe thoughts of their hearts great, and they made an attack upon the gods;\nof them is told the tale of Otys and Ephialtes, who, as Homer says, dared\nto scale heaven, and would have laid hands upon the gods. Doubt reigned in\nthe celestial councils. Should they kill them and annihilate the race with\nthunderbolts, as they had done the giants, then there would be an end of\nthe sacrifices and worship which men offered to them; but, on the other\nhand, the gods could not suffer their insolence to be unrestrained. At\nlast, after a good deal of reflection, Zeus discovered a way. He said;\n\"Methinks I have a plan which will humble their pride and mend their\nmanners; they shall continue to exist, but I will cut them in two, which\nwill have a double advantage, for it will halve their strength and we\nshall have twice as many sacrifices. They shall walk upright on two legs,\nand if they continue insolent and will not be quiet, I will split them\nagain and they shall hop on a single leg.” He spoke and cut men in two,\n\"as you might split an egg with a hair.”... After the division the two\nparts of man, each desiring his other half, came together.... So ancient\nis the desire of one another which is implanted in us, reuniting our\noriginal nature, making one of two, and healing the state of man.

Art (caeteris paribus) is great in exact proportion to the\n    love of beauty shown by the painter, provided that love of beauty\n    forfeit no atom of truth.\"–RUSKIN.",
        "The most ancient works of Art which we possess are representations of\nanimals, rude indeed, but often strikingly characteristic, engraved on, or\ncarved in, stag’s-horn or bone; and found in English, French, and German\ncaves, with stone and other rude implements, and the remains of mammalia,\nbelonging apparently to the close of the glacial epoch: not only of the\ndeer, bear, and other animals now inhabiting temperate Europe, but of\nsome, such as the reindeer, the musk sheep, and the mammoth, which have\neither retreated north or become altogether extinct. We may, I think,\nventure to hope that other designs may hereafter be found, which will give\nus additional information as to the manners and customs of our ancestors\nin those remote ages.",
        "Next to these in point of antiquity come the sculptures and paintings on\nAssyrian and Egyptian tombs, temples, and palaces.",
        "These ancient scenes, considered as works of art, have no doubt many\nfaults, and yet how graphically they tell their story! As a matter of fact\na king is not, as a rule, bigger than his soldiers, but in these\nbattle-scenes he is always so represented. We must, however, remember that\nin ancient warfare the greater part of the fighting was, as a matter of\nfact, done by the chiefs. In this respect the Homeric poems resemble the\nAssyrian and Egyptian representations. At any rate, we see at a glance\nwhich is the king, which are officers, which side is victorious, the\nstruggles and sufferings of the wounded, the flight of the enemy, the city\nof refuge–so that he who runs may read; while in modern battle-pictures\nthe story is much less clear, and, indeed, the untrained eye sees for some\ntime little but scarlet and smoke.",
        "These works assuredly possess a grandeur and dignity of their own, even\nthough they have not the beauty of later art.",
        "In Greece Art reached a perfection which has never been excelled, and it\nwas more appreciated than perhaps it has ever been since.",
        "At the time when Demetrius attacked the city of Rhodes, Protogenes was\npainting a picture of Ialysus. “This,” says Pliny, “hindered King\nDemetrius from taking Rhodes, out of fear lest he should burn the picture;\nand not being able to fire the town on any other side, he was pleased\nrather to spare the painting than to take the victory, which was already\nin his hands. Protogenes, at that time, had his painting-room in a garden\nout of the town, and very near the camp of the enemies, where he was daily\nfinishing those pieces which he had already begun, the noise of soldiers\nnot being capable of interrupting his studies. But Demetrius causing him\nto be brought into his presence, and asking him what made him so bold as\nto work in the midst of enemies, he answered the king, ’That he understood\nthe war which he made was against the Rhodians, and not against the\nArts.’”",
        "With the decay of Greece, Art sank too, until it was revived in the\nthirteenth century by Cimabue, since whose time its progress has been\ntriumphal.",
        "Art is unquestionably one of the purest and highest elements in human\nhappiness. It trains the mind through the eye, and the eye through the\nmind. As the sun colors flowers, so does art color life.",
        "“In true Art,” says Ruskin, “the hand, the head, and the heart of man go\ntogether. But Art is no recreation: it cannot be learned at spare moments,\nnor pursued when we have nothing better to do.”",
        "It is not only in the East that great works, really due to study and\nlabor, have been attributed to magic.",
        "Study and labor cannot make every man an artist, but no one can succeed in\nart without them. In Art two and two do not make four, and no number of\nlittle things will make a great one.",
        "It has been said, and on high authority, that the end of art is to please.\nBut this is a very imperfect definition. It might as well be said that a\nlibrary is only intended for pleasure and ornament.",
        "Art has the advantage of nature, in so far as it introduces a human\nelement, which is in some respects superior even to nature. “If,” says\nPlato, “you take a man as he is made by nature and compare him with\nanother who is the effect of art, the work of nature will always appear\nthe less beautitiful, because art is more accurate than nature.”",
        "Bacon also, in The Advancement of Learning, speaks of “the world being\ninferior to the soul, by reason whereof there is agreeable to the spirit\nof man a more ample greatness, a more exact goodness, and a more absolute\nvariety than can be found in the nature of things.”",
        "The poets tell us that Prometheus, having made a beautiful statue of\nMinerva, the goddess was so delighted that she offered to bring down\nanything from Heaven which could add to its perfection. Prometheus on this\nprudently asked her to take him there, so that he might choose for\nhimself. This Minerva did, and Prometheus, finding that in heaven all\nthings were animated by fire, brought back a spark, with which he gave\nlife to his work.",
        "In fact, Imitation is the means and not the end of Art. The story of\nZeuxis and Parrhasius is a pretty tale; but to deceive birds, or even man\nhimself, is but a trifling matter compared with the higher functions of\nArt. To imitate the Iliad, says Dr. Young, is not imitating Homer, but\nas Sir J. Reynolds adds, the more the artist studies nature “the nearer he\napproaches to the true and perfect idea of art.”",
        "“Following these rules and using these precautions, when you have clearly\nand distinctly learned in what good coloring consists, you cannot do\nbetter than have recourse to Nature herself, who is always at hand, and in\ncomparison of whose true splendor the best colored pictures are but faint\nand feeble.” [1]",
        "Art, indeed, must create as well as copy. As Victor Cousin well says, “The\nideal without the real lacks life; but the real without the ideal lacks\npure beauty. Both need to unite; to join hands and enter into alliance. In\nthis way the best work may be achieved. Thus beauty is an absolute idea,\nand not a mere copy of imperfect Nature.”",
        "The grouping of the picture is of course of the utmost importance. Sir\nJoshua Reynolds gives two remarkable cases to show how much any given\nfigure in a picture is affected by its surroundings. Tintoret in one of\nhis pictures has taken the Samson of Michael Angelo, put an eagle under\nhim, placed thunder and lightning in his right hand instead of the jawbone\nof an ass, and thus turned him into a Jupiter. The second instance is even\nmore striking. Titian has copied the figure in the vault of the Sistine\nChapel which represents the Deity dividing light from darkness, and has\nintroduced it into his picture of the battle of Cadore, to represent a\ngeneral falling from his horse.",
        "We must remember that so far as the eye is concerned, the object of the\nartist is to train, not to deceive, and that his higher function has\nreference rather to the mind than to the eye.",
        "No doubt",
        "  “To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,\n  To throw a perfume on the violet,\n  To smooth the ice, or add another hue\n  Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light\n  To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,\n  Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.” [2]",
        "But all is not gold that glitters, flowers are not all arrayed like the\nlily, and there is room for selection as well as representation.",
        "“The true, the good, and the beautiful,” says Cousin, “are but forms of\nthe infinite: what then do we really love in truth, beauty, and virtue? We\nlove the infinite himself. The love of the infinite substance is hidden\nunder the love of its forms. It is so truly the infinite which charms in\nthe true, the good, and the beautiful, that its manifestations alone do\nnot suffice. The artist is dissatisfied at the sight even of his greatest\nworks; he aspires still higher.”",
        "It is indeed sometimes objected that Landscape painting is not true to\nnature; but we must ask, What is truth? Is the object to produce the same\nimpression on the mind as that created by the scene itself? If so, let any\none try to draw from memory a group of mountains, and he will probably\nfind that in the impression produced on his mind the mountains are loftier\nand steeper, the valleys deeper and narrower, than in the actual reality.\nA drawing, then, which was literally exact would not be true, in the sense\nof conveying the same impression as Nature herself.",
        "In fact, Art, says Goethe, is called Art simply because it is not Nature.",
        "It is not sufficient for the artist to choose beautiful scenery, and\ndelineate it with accuracy. He must not be a mere copyist. Something\nhigher and more subtle is required. He must create, or at any rate\ninterpret, as well as copy.",
        "Turner was never satisfied merely to reach to even the most glorious\nscenery. He moved, and even suppressed, mountains.",
        "A certain nobleman, we are told, was very anxious to see the model from\nwhom Guido painted his lovely female faces. Guido placed his\ncolor-grinder, a big coarse man, in an attitude, and then drew a beautiful\nMagdalen. “My dear Count,” he said, “the beautiful and pure idea must be\nin the mind, and then it is no matter what the model is.”",
        "Guido Reni, who painted St. Michael for the Church of the Capuchins at\nRome, wished that he “had the wings of an angel, to have ascended unto\nParadise, and there to have beheld the forms of those beautiful spirits,\nfrom which I might have copied my Archangel. But not being able to mount\nso high, it was in vain for me to seek for his resemblance here below; so\nthat I was forced to look into mine own mind, and into that idea of beauty\nwhich I have formed in my own imagination.” [3]",
        "Science attempts, as far as the limited powers of Man permit, to reproduce\nthe actual facts in a manner which, however bald, is true in itself,\nirrespective of time and scene. To do this she must submit to many\nlimitations; not altogether unvexatious, and not without serious\ndrawbacks. Art, on the contrary, endeavors to convey the impression of the\noriginal under some especial aspect.",
        "In some respects, Art gives a clearer and more vivid idea of an unknown\ncountry than any description can convey. In literature rock may be rock,\nbut in painting it must be granite or slate, and not merely rock in\ngeneral.",
        "It is remarkable that while artists have long recognized the necessity of\nstudying anatomy, and there has been from the commencement a professor of\nanatomy in the Royal Academy, it is only of late years that any knowledge\nof botany or geology has been considered desirable, and even now their\nimportance is by no means generally recognized.",
        "Much has been written as to the relative merits of painting, sculpture,\nand architecture. This, if it be not a somewhat unprofitable inquiry,\nwould at any rate be out of place here.",
        "Architecture not only gives intense pleasure, but even the impression of\nsomething ethereal and superhuman.",
        "Madame de Stael described it as “frozen music;” and a cathedral is a\nglorious specimen of “thought in stone,” whose very windows are\ntransparent walls of gorgeous hues.",
        "Caracci said that poets paint in their words and artists speak in their\nworks. The latter have indeed one great advantage, for a glance at a\nstatue or a painting will convey a more vivid idea than a long and minute\ndescription.",
        "Another advantage possessed by Art is that it is understood by all\ncivilized nations, whilst each has a separate language.",
        "Even from a material point of view Art is most important. In a recent\naddress Sir F. Leighton has observed that the study of Art “is every day\nbecoming more important in relation to certain sides of the waning\nmaterial prosperity of the country. For the industrial competition between\nthis and other countries–a competition, keen and eager, which means to\ncertain industries almost a race for life–runs, in many cases, no longer\nexclusively or mainly on the lines of excellence of material and solidity\nof workmanship, but greatly nowadays on the lines of artistic charm and\nbeauty of design.”",
        "The highest service, however, that Art can accomplish for man is to become\n\"at once the voice of his nobler aspirations, and the steady\ndisciplinarian of his emotions; and it is with this mission, rather than\nwith any aesthetic perfection, that we are at present concerned.” [4]",
        "Science and Art are sisters, or rather perhaps they are like brother and\nsister. The mission of Art is in some respects like that of woman. It is\nnot Hers so much to do the hard toil and moil of the world, as to surround\nit with a halo of beauty, to convert work into pleasure.",
        "In science we naturally expect progress, but in Art the case is not so\nclear; and yet Sir Joshua Reynolds did not hesitate to express his\nconviction that in the future “so much will painting improve, that the\nbest we can now achieve will appear like the work of children,” and we may\nhope that our power of enjoying it may increase in an equal ratio.\nWordsworth says that poets have to create the taste for their own works,\nand the same is, in some degree at any rate, true of artists.",
        "In one respect especially modern painters appear to have made a marked\nadvance, and one great blessing which in fact we owe to them is a more\nvivid enjoyment of scenery.",
        "I have of course no pretensions to speak with authority, but even in the\ncase of the greatest masters before Turner, the landscapes seem to me\nsingularly inferior to the figures. Sir Joshua Reynolds tells us that\nGainsborough framed a kind of model of a landscape on his table, composed\nof broken stones, dried herbs, and pieces of looking-glass, which he\nmagnified and improved into rocks, trees, and water; and Sir Joshua\nsolemnly discusses the wisdom of such a proceeding. “How far it may be\nuseful in giving hints,” he says, “the professors of landscape can best\ndetermine,” but he does not recommend it, and is disposed to think, on the\nwhole, the practice may be more likely to do harm than good!",
        "In the picture of Ceyx and Alcyone, by Wilson, of whom Cunningham said\nthat, with Gainsborough, he laid the foundation of our School of\nLandscape, the castle is said to have been painted from a pot of porter,\nand the rock from a Stilton cheese. There is indeed another version of the\nstory, that the picture was sold for a pot of porter and a cheese, which,\nhowever, does not give a higher idea of the appreciation of the art of\nlandscape at that date.",
        "Until very recently the general feeling with reference to mountain scenery\nhas been that expressed by Tacitus. “Who would leave Asia or Africa or\nItaly to go to Germany, a shapeless and unformed country, a harsh sky, and\nmelancholy aspect, unless indeed it was his native land?”",
        "It is amusing to read the opinion of Dr. Beattie, in a special treatise on\nTruth, Poetry and Music, written at the close of the last century, that\n\"The Highlands of Scotland are in general a melancholy country. Long\ntracts of mountainous country, covered with dark heath, and often obscured\nby misty weather; narrow valleys thinly inhabited, and bounded by\nprecipices resounding with the fall of torrents; a soil so rugged, and a\nclimate so dreary, as in many parts to admit neither the amenities of\npasturage, nor the labors of agriculture; the mournful dashing of waves\nalong the firths and lakes: the portentous noises which every change of\nthe wind is apt to raise in a lonely region, full of echoes, and rocks,\nand caverns; the grotesque and ghastly appearance of such a landscape by\nthe light of the moon: objects like these diffuse a gloom over the fancy,\"\netc. [5]",
        "Even Goldsmith regarded the scenery of the Highlands as dismal and\nhideous. Johnson, we know, laid it down as an axiom that “the noblest\nprospect which a Scotchman ever sees is the high road that leads him to\nEngland\"–a saying which throws much doubt on his distinction that the\nGiant’s Causeway was “worth seeing but not worth going to see.” [6]",
        "Madame de Stael declared, that though she would go 500 leagues to meet a\nclever man, she would not care to open her window to see the Bay of\nNaples.",
        "Nor was the ancient absence of appreciation confined to scenery. Even\nBurke, speaking of Stonehenge, says, “Stonehenge, neither for disposition\nnor ornament, has anything admirable.”",
        "Ugly scenery, however, may in some cases have an injurious effect on the\nhuman system. It has been ingeniously suggested that what really drove Don\nQuixote out of his mind was not the study of his books of chivalry, so\nmuch as the monotonous scenery of La Mancha.",
        "The love of landscape is not indeed due to Art alone. It has been the\nhappy combination of art and science which has trained us to perceive the\nbeauty which surrounds us.",
        "Art helps us to see, and “hundreds of people can talk for one who can\nthink; but thousands can think for one who can see. To see clearly is\npoetry, prophecy, and religion all in one.... Remembering always that\nthere are two characters in which all greatness of Art consists–first,\nthe earnest and intense seizing of natural facts; then the ordering those\nfacts by strength of human intellect, so as to make them, for all who look\nupon them, to the utmost serviceable, memorable, and beautiful. And thus\ngreat Art is nothing else than the type of strong and noble life; for as\nthe ignoble person, in his dealings with all that occurs in the world\nabout him, first sees nothing clearly, looks nothing fairly in the face,\nand then allows himself to be swept away by the trampling torrent and\nunescapable force of the things that he would not foresee and could not\nunderstand: so the noble person, looking the facts of the world full in\nthe face, and fathoming them with deep faculty, then deals with them in\nunalarmed intelligence and unhurried strength, and becomes, with his human\nintellect and will, no unconscious nor insignificant agent in consummating\ntheir good and restraining their evil.” [7]",
        "May we not also hope that in this respect also still further progress may\nbe made, that beauties may be revealed, and pleasures may be in store for\nthose who come after us, which we cannot appreciate, or at least can but\nfaintly feel.",
        "Even now there is scarcely a cottage without something more or less\nsuccessfully claiming to rank as Art,–a picture, a photograph, or a\nstatuette; and we may fairly hope that much as Art even now contributes to\nthe happiness of life, it will do so even more effectively in the future.",

        "“Some there were,” he says, “who owed their preservation to Euripides. Of\nall the Grecians, his was the muse with whom the Sicilians were most in\nlove. From the strangers who landed in their island they gleaned every\nsmall specimen or portion of his works, and communicated it with pleasure\nto each other. It is said that upon this occasion a number of Athenians on\ntheir return home went to Euripides, and thanked him in the most grateful\nmanner for their obligations to his pen; some having been enfranchised for\nteaching their masters what they remembered of his poems, and others\nhaving procured refreshments, when they were wandering about after the\nbattle, by singing a few of his verses.”",
        "Nowadays we are none of us likely to owe our lives to Poetry in this\nsense, yet in another we many of us owe to it a similar debt. How often,\nwhen worn with overwork, sorrow, or anxiety, have we taken down Homer or\nHorace, Shakespeare or Milton, and felt the clouds gradually roll away,\nthe jar of nerves subside, the consciousness of power replace physical\nexhaustion, and the darkness of despondency brighten once more into the\nlight of life.",
        "“And yet Plato,” says Jowett, “expels the poets from his Republic because\nthey are allied to sense; because they stimulate the emotions; because\nthey are thrice removed from the ideal truth.”",
        "In that respect, as in some others, few would accept Plato’s Republic as\nbeing an ideal Commonwealth, and most would agree with Sir Philip Sidney\nthat “if you cannot bear the planet-like music of poetry ... I must send\nyou in the behalf of all poets, that while you live, you live in love, and\nnever get favor for lacking skill of a sonnet; and when you die, your\nmemory die from the earth, for want of an epitaph.”",
        "Poetry has often been compared with painting and sculpture. Simonides long\nago said that Poetry is a speaking picture, and painting is mute Poetry.",
        "“Poetry,” says Cousin, “is the first of the Arts because it best\nrepresents the infinite.”",
        "And again, “Though the arts are in some respects isolated, yet there is\none which seems to profit by the resources of all, and that is Poetry.\nWith words, Poetry can paint and sculpture; she can build edifices like an\narchitect; she unites, to some extent, melody and music. She is, so to\nsay, the center in which all arts unite.”",
        "A true poem is a gallery of pictures.",
        "It must, I think, be admitted that painting and sculpture can give us a\nclearer and more vivid idea of an object we have never seen than any\ndescription can convey. But when we have once seen it, then on the\ncontrary there are many points which the poet brings before us, and which\nperhaps neither in the representation, nor even in nature, should we\nperceive for ourselves. Objects can be most vividly brought before us by\nthe artist, actions by the poet; space is the domain of Art, time of\nPoetry. [1]",
        "Take, for instance, as a typical instance, female beauty. How labored and\nhow cold any description appears.

        "A great poet indeed must be inspired; he must possess an exquisite sense\nof beauty, and feelings deeper than those of most men, and yet well under\nhis control. “The Milton of poetry is the man, in his own magnificent\nphrase, of devout prayer to that eternal spirit that can enrich with all\nutterance and knowledge, and sends out his seraphim with the hallowed fire\nof his altar, to touch and purify the lips of whom he pleases.” [2] And if\nfrom one point of view Poetry brings home to us the immeasurable\ninequalities of different minds, on the other hand it teaches us that\ngenius is no affair of rank or wealth.",
        "  “I think of Chatterton, the marvellous boy,\n     The sleepless soul, that perish’d in his pride;\n   Of Burns, that walk’d in glory and in joy\n     Behind his plough upon the mountain-side.” [3]",

But the images of men’s wits and knowledge remain in books,\nexempted from the wrong of time and capable of perpetual renovation.\nNeither are they fitly to be called images, because they generate still\nand cast their seeds in the minds of others, provoking and causing\ninfinite actions and opinions in succeeding ages: so that if the invention\nof the ship was thought so noble, which carrieth riches and commodities\nfrom place to place, and consociateth the most remote regions in\nparticipation of their fruits, how much more are letters to be magnified,\nwhich, as ships, pass through the vast seas of time and make ages so\ndistant to participate of the wisdom, illuminations, and inventions, the\none of the other?” [7]",
        "The poet requires many qualifications. “Who has traced,” says Cousin, “the\nplan of this poem? Reason. Who has given it life and charm? Love. And who\nhas guided reason and love? The Will.”",
        " “All men have some imagination, but\n  The Lover and the Poet\n  Are of imagination all compact.",
        " “The Poet’s eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,\n  Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven,\n  And as imagination bodies forth\n  The forms of things unknown, the poet’s pen\n  Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing\n  A local habitation and a name.” [8]",

        "The works of our greatest Poets are all episodes in that one great poem\nwhich the genius of man has created since the commencement of human\nhistory.",
        "A distinguished mathematician is said once to have inquired what was\nproved by Milton in his Paradise Lost; and there are no doubt still some\nwho ask themselves, even if they shrink from putting the question to\nothers, whether Poetry is of any use, just as if to give pleasure were not\nuseful in itself. No true Utilitarian, however, would feel this doubt,\nsince the greatest happiness of the greatest number is the rule of his\nphilosophy.",
        "“We must not estimate the works of genius merely with reference to the\npleasure they afford, even when pleasure was their principal object. We\nmust also regard the intelligence which they presuppose and exercise.” [9]",
        "Thoroughly to enjoy Poetry we must not so limit ourselves, but must rise\nto a higher ideal.",
        "“Yes; constantly in reading poetry, a sense for the best, the really\nexcellent, and of the strength and joy to be drawn from it, should be\npresent in our minds, and should govern our estimate of what we\nread.” [10]",
        "Cicero, in his oration for Archias, well asked, “Has not this man then a\nright to my love, to my admiration, to all the means which I can employ in\nhis defence? For we are instructed by all the greatest and most learned of\nmankind, that education, precepts, and practice, can in every other branch\nof learning produce excellence. But a poet is formed by the hand of\nnature; he is aroused by mental vigor, and inspired by what we may call\nthe spirit of divinity itself. Therefore our Ennius has a right to give to\npoets the epithet of Holy, [11] because they are, as it were, lent to\nmankind by the indulgent bounty of the gods.”",
        "“Poetry,” says Shelley, “awakens and enlarges the mind itself by rendering\nit the receptacle of a thousand unapprehended combinations of thought.\nPoetry lifts the veil from the hidden beauty of the world, and makes\nfamiliar objects be as if they were not familiar; it reproduces all that\nit represents, and the impersonations clothed in its Elysian light stand\nthenceforward in the minds of those who have once contemplated them, as\nmemorials of that gentle and exalted content which extends itself over all\nthoughts and actions with which it co-exists.”",
        "And again, “All high Poetry is infinite; it is as the first acorn, which\ncontained all oaks potentially. Veil after veil may be undrawn, and the\ninmost naked beauty of the meaning never exposed. A great poem is a\nfountain forever overflowing with the waters of wisdom and delight.”",

        "Poetry lifts the veil from the beauty of the world which would otherwise\nbe hidden, and throws over the most familiar objects the glow and halo of\nimagination. The man who has a love for Poetry can scarcely fail to derive\nintense pleasure from Nature, which to those who love it is all “beauty to\nthe eye and music to the ear.”",
        "“Yet Nature never set forth the earth in so rich tapestry as divers poets\nhave done; neither with so pleasant rivers, fruitful trees, sweet-smelling\nflowers, nor whatsoever else may make the too-much-loved earth more\nlovely.” [12]",
        "In the smokiest city the poet will transport us, as if by enchantment, to\nthe fresh air and bright sun, to the murmur of woods and leaves and water,\nto the ripple of waves upon sand, and enable us, as in some delightful\ndream, to cast off the cares and troubles of life.",

        "Swinburne says of Blake, and I feel entirely with him, though in my case\nthe application would have been different, that “The sweetness of sky and\nleaf, of grass and water–the bright light life of bird, child, and\nbeast–is, so to speak, kept fresh by some graver sense of faithful and\nmysterious love, explained and vivified by a conscience and purpose in the\nartist’s hand and mind. Such a fiery outbreak of spring, such an\ninsurrection of fierce floral life and radiant riot of childish power and\npleasure, no poet or painter ever gave before; such lustre of green leaves\nand flushed limbs, kindled cloud and fervent fleece, was never wrought\ninto speech or shape.”",
        "To appreciate Poetry we must not merely glance at it, or rush through it,\nor read it in order to talk or write about it. One must compose oneself\ninto the right frame of mind. Of course for one’s own sake one will read\nPoetry in times of agitation, sorrow, or anxiety, but that is another\nmatter.",
        "The inestimable treasures of Poetry again are open to all of us. The best\nbooks are indeed the cheapest. For the price of a little beer, a little\ntobacco, we can buy Shakespeare or Milton–or indeed almost as many books\nas a man can read with profit in a year.",
        "Nor, in considering the advantage of Poetry to man, must we limit\nourselves to its past or present influence. The future of Poetry, says Mr.\nMatthew Arnold, and no one was more qualified to speak, “The future of\nPoetry is immense, because in Poetry, where it is worthy of its high\ndestinies, our race, as time goes on, will find an ever surer and surer\nstay. But for Poetry the idea is everything; the rest is a world of\nillusion, of divine illusion. Poetry attaches its emotion to the idea; the\nidea is the fact. The strongest part of our religion to-day is its\nunconscious Poetry. We should conceive of Poetry worthily, and more highly\nthan it has been the custom to conceive of it. We should conceive of it as\ncapable of higher uses, and called to higher destinies than those which in\ngeneral men have assigned to it hitherto.”",
        "Poetry has been well called the record “of the best and happiest moments\nof the happiest and best minds;” it is the light of life, the very “image\nof life expressed in its eternal truth;” it immortalizes all that is best\nand most beautiful in the world; “it purges from our inward sight the film\nof familiarity which obscures from us the wonder of our being;” “it is the\ncenter and circumference of knowledge;” and poets are “mirrors of the\ngigantic shadows which futurity caste upon the present.”",
        "Poetry, in effect, lengthens life; it creates for us time, if time be\nrealized as the succession of ideas and not of minutes; it is the “breath\nand finer spirit of all knowledge;” it is bound neither by time nor space,\nbut lives in the spirit of man. What greater praise can be given than the\nsaying that life should be Poetry put into action.",

The early history of Music\nis, however, unfortunately wrapped in much obscurity. The use of letters\nlong preceded the invention of notes, and tradition in such a matter can\ntell us but little.",
        "The contest between Marsyas and Apollo is supposed by some to typify the\nstruggle between the Flute and the Lyre; Marsyas representing the archaic\nFlute, Apollo the champion of the Lyre. The latter of course was\nvictorious: it sets the voice free, and the sound",

        "Various myths have grown up to explain the origin of Music. One Greek\ntradition was to the effect Grasshoppers were human beings themselves in a\nworld before the Muses; that when the Muses came, being ravished with\ndelight, they sang and sang and forgot to eat, until “they died of hunger\nfor the love of song. And they carry to heaven the report of those who\nhonor them on earth.” [2]",
        "The old writers and commentators tell us that Pythagoras, “as he was one\nday meditating on the want of some rule to guide the ear, analogous to\nwhat had been used to help the other senses, chanced to pass by a\nblacksmith’s shop, and observing that the hammers, which were four in\nnumber, sounded very harmoniously, he had them weighed, and found them to\nbe in the proportion of six, eight, nine, and twelve. Upon this he\nsuspended four strings of equal length and thickness, etc., fastened\nweights in the above-mentioned proportions to each of them respectively,\nand found that they gave the same sounds that the hammers had done; viz.\nthe fourth, fifth, and octave to the gravest tone.” [3] However this may\nbe, it would appear that the lyre had at first four strings only:\nTerpander is said to have given it three more, and an eighth was\nsubsequently added.",
        "We have unfortunately no specimens of Greek or Roman, or even of Early\nChristian music. The Chinese indicated the notes by words or their\ninitials. The lowest was termed “Koung,” or the Emperor, as being the\nFoundation on which all were supported; the second was Tschang, the Prime\nMinister; the third, the Subject; the fourth, Public Business; the fifth,\nthe Mirror of Heaven.

The Monastery of St. Gall possesses a copy of Gregory’s\nAntiphonary, made about the year 780 by a chorister who was sent from Rome\nto Charlemagne to reform the Northern music, and in this the notes are\nindicated by “pneumss,” from which our notes were gradually developed, and\nfirst arranged along one line, to which others were gradually added. But I\nmust not enlarge on this interesting subject.",

Even as long ago as 1185 Giraldus Cambrensis, Bishop of St.\nDavid’s, says, “The Britons do not sing their tunes in unison like the\ninhabitants of other countries, but in different parts. So that when a\ncompany of singers meet to sing, as is usual in this country, as many\ndifferent parts are heard as there are singers.” [5]",

        "Speaking of Purcell’s anthem, “Be merciful to me, O God,” Burney says it\nis “throughout admirable. Indeed, to my conception there is no better\nmusic existing of the kind than the opening of this anthem, in which the\nverse ’I will praise God’ and the last movement in C natural are, in\nmelody, harmony, and modulation, truly divine music.”",
        "Dr. Burney says that Purcell was “as much the pride of an Englishman in\nmusic as Shakespeare in productions of the stage, Milton in epic poetry,\nLocke in metaphysics, or Sir Isaac Newton in philosophy and mathematics;\"\nand yet Purcell’s music is unfortunately but little known to us now, as\nMacfarren says, “to our great loss.”",

To Arne we are also indebted for the\nmusic of “Where the Bee sucks there lurk I.” “The Vicar of Bray” is set to\na tune originally known as “A Country Garden.” “Come unto these yellow\nsands” we owe to Purcell; “Sigh no more, Ladies” to Stevens; “Home, Sweet\nHome” to Bishop.",

        "Still more so that on Purcell, whose premature death was so irreparable a\nloss to English music–",
        "    “Here lies Henry Purcell, who left this life, and is gone to that\n    blessed place, where only his harmony can be exceeded.”",
        "The histories of Music contain many curious anecdotes as to the\ncircumstances under which different works have been composed.",
        "Rossini tells us that he wrote the overture to the “Gazza Ladra” on the\nvery day of the first performance, in the upper loft of the La Scala,\nwhere he had been confined by the manager under the guard of four\nscene-shifters, who threw the text out of the window to copyists bit by\nbit as it was composed. Tartini is said to have composed “Il trillo del\nDiavolo,” considered to be his best work, in a dream. Rossini, speaking of\nthe chorus in G minor in his “Dal tuo stellato soglio,” tells us: “While I\nwas writing the chorus in G minor I suddenly dipped my pen into a medicine\nbottle instead of the ink. I made a blot, and when I dried this with the\nsand it took the form of a natural, which instantly gave me the idea of\nthe effect the change from G minor to G major would make, and to this blot\nis all the effect, if any, due.” But these of course are exceptional\ncases.",
        "There are other forms of Music, which though not strictly entitled to the\nname, are yet capable of giving intense pleasure. To the sportsman what\nMusic can excel that of the hounds themselves. The cawing of rooks has\nbeen often quoted as a sound which has no actual beauty of its own, and\nyet which is delightful from its associations.",
        "There is, however, a true Music of Nature,–the song of birds, the whisper\nof leaves, the ripple of waters upon a sandy shore, the wail of wind or\nsea.",

        "As touching the human heart–",

        "  “Hark how it falls! and now It steals along,\n    Like distant bells upon the lake at eve.\n  When all is still; and now it grows more strong\n    As when the choral train their dirges weave\n  Mellow and many voiced; where every close\n    O’er the old minster roof, in echoing waves reflows.\n  Oh! I am rapt aloft. My spirit soars\n    Beyond the skies, and leaves the stars behind;\n  Lo! angels lead me to the happy shores,\n    And floating paeans fill the buoyant wind.\n  Farewell! base earth, farewell! my soul is freed.”",

        "  “The rude sea grew civil at her song,\n  And certain stars shot madly from their spheres\n  To hear the Sea-maid’s music.”",
        "Prose writers have also been inspired by Music to their highest eloquence.\n\"Music,” says Plato, “is a moral law. It gives a soul to the universe,\nwings to the mind, flight to the imagination, a charm to sadness, gaiety\nand life to everything. It is the essence of order, and leads to all that\nis good, just, and beautiful, of which it is the invisible, but\nnevertheless dazzling, passionate, and eternal form.” “Music,” said\nLuther, “is a fair and glorious gift from God. I would not for the world\nrenounce my humble share in music.” “Music,” said Halevy, “is an art that\nGod has given us, in which the voices of all nations may unite their\nprayers in one harmonious rhythm.” Or Carlyle, “Music is a kind of\ninarticulate, unfathomable speech, which leads us to the edge of the\ninfinite, and lets us for moments gaze into it.”",
        "Let me also quote Helmholtz, one of the profoundest exponents of modern\nscience. “Just as in the rolling ocean, this movement, rhythmically\nrepeated, and yet ever-varying, rivets our attention and hurries us along.\nBut whereas in the sea blind physical forces alone are at work, and hence\nthe final impression on the spectator’s mind is nothing but solitude–in a\nmusical work of art the movement follows the outflow of the artist’s own\nemotions. Now gently gliding, now gracefully leaping, now violently\nstirred, penetrated, or laboriously contending with the natural expression\nof passion, the stream of sound, in primitive vivacity, bears over into\nthe hearer’s soul unimagined moods which the artist has overheard from his\nown, and finally raises him up to that repose of everlasting beauty of\nwhich God has allowed but few of his elect favorites to be the heralds.”",
        "“There are but seven notes in the scale; make them fourteen,” says Newman,\n\"yet what a slender outfit for so vast an enterprise! What science brings\nso much out of so little? Out of what poor elements does some great master\nin it create his new world! Shall we say that all this exuberant\ninventiveness is a mere ingenuity or trick of art, like some game of\nfashion of the day, without reality, without meaning?... Is it possible\nthat that inexhaustible evolution and disposition of notes, so rich yet so\nsimple, so intricate yet so regulated, so various yet so majestic, should\nbe a mere sound, which is gone and perishes? Can it be that those\nmysterious stirrings of the heart, and keen emotions, and strange\nyearnings after we know not what, and awful impressions from we know not\nwhence, should be wrought in us by what is unsubstantial, and comes and\ngoes, and begins and ends in itself? it is not so; it cannot be. No; they\nhave escaped from some higher sphere; they are the outpourings of eternal\nharmony in the medium of created sound; they are echoes from our Home;\nthey are the voices of Angels, or the Magnificat of Saints, or the living\nlaws of Divine Governance, or the Divine Attributes; something are they\nbesides themselves, which we cannot compass, which we cannot utter, though\nmortal man, and he perhaps not otherwise distinguished above his fellows,\nhas the gift of eliciting them.”",
        "Poetry and Music unite in song. From the earliest ages song has been the\nsweet companion of labor. The rude chant of the boatman floats upon the\nwater, the shepherd sings upon the hill, the milkmaid in the dairy, the\nploughman at the plough. Every trade, every occupation, every act and\nscene of life, has long had its own especial music. The bride went to her\nmarriage, the laborer to his work, the old man to his last long rest, each\nwith appropriate and immemorial music.",
        "Music has been truly described as the mother of sympathy, the handmaid of\nReligion, and will never exercise its full effect, as the Emperor Charles\nVI. said to Farinelli, unless it aims not merely to charm the ear, but to\ntouch the heart.",
        "There are many who consider that our life at present is peculiarly prosaic\nand mercenary. I greatly doubt whether that be the case, but if so our\nneed for Music is all the more imperative.",
        "Much as Music has already done for man, we may hope even more from it in\nthe future.",
        "It is, moreover, a joy for all. To appreciate Science or Art requires some\ntraining, and no doubt the cultivated ear will more and more appreciate\nthe beauties of Music; but though there are exceptional individuals, and\neven races, almost devoid of any love of Music, still they are happily but\nrare.",
        "Good Music, moreover, does not necessarily involve any considerable\noutlay; it is even now no mere luxury of the rich, and we may hope that as\ntime goes on, it will become more and more the comfort and solace of the\npoor.",

        "We are told in the first chapter of Genesis that at the close of the sixth\nday “God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good.\"\nNot merely good, but very good. Yet how few of us appreciate the beautiful\nworld in which we live!",
        "In preceding chapters I have incidentally, though only incidentally,\nreferred to the Beauties of Nature; but any attempt, however imperfect, to\nsketch the blessings of life must contain some special reference to this\nlovely world itself, which the Greeks happily called [Greek: chosmos]\n–beauty.",
        "Hamerton, in his charming work on Landscape, says, “There are, I\nbelieve, four new experiences for which no description ever adequately\nprepares us, the first sight of the sea, the first journey in the desert,\nthe sight of flowing molten lava, and a walk on a great glacier. We feel\nin each case that the strange thing is pure nature, as much nature as a\nfamiliar English moor, yet so extraordinary that we might be in another\nplanet.” But it would, I think, be easier to enumerate the Wonders of\nNature for which description can prepare us, than those which are\naltogether beyond the power of language.",
        "Many of us, however, walk through the world like ghosts, as if we were in\nit, but not of it. We have “eyes and see not, ears and hear not.” To look\nis much less easy than to overlook, and to be able to see what we do see,\nis a great gift. Ruskin maintains that “The greatest thing a human soul\never does in this world is to see something, and tell what it saw in a\nplain way.” I do not suppose that his eyes are better than ours, but how\nmuch more he sees with them!",
        "We must look before we can expect to see. “To the attentive eye,” says\nEmerson, “each moment of the year has its own beauty; and in the same\nfield it beholds every hour a picture that was never seen before, and\nshall never be seen again. The heavens change every moment and reflect\ntheir glory or gloom on the plains beneath.”",
        "The love of Nature is a great gift, and if it is frozen or crushed out,\nthe character can hardly fail to suffer from the loss. I will not, indeed,\nsay that a person who does not love Nature is necessarily bad; or that one\nwho does, is necessarily good; but it is to most minds a great help. Many,\nas Miss Cobbe says, enter the Temple through the gate called Beautiful.",
        "There are doubtless some to whom none of the beautiful wonders of Nature;\nneither the glories of the rising or setting sun; the magnificent\nspectacle of the boundless ocean, sometimes so grand in its peaceful\ntranquillity, at others so majestic in its mighty power; the forests\nagitated by the storm, or alive with the song of birds; nor the glaciers\nand mountains–there are doubtless some whom none of these magnificent\nspectacles can move, whom “all the glories of heaven and earth may pass in\ndaily succession without touching their hearts or elevating their\nminds.” [1]",

        "For most of us the early summer has a special charm. The very life is\nluxury. The air is full of scent, and sound, and sunshine, of the song of\nbirds and the murmur of insects; the meadows gleam with golden buttercups,\nit almost seems as if one could see the grass grow and the buds open; the\nbees hum for very joy, and the air is full of a thousand scents, above all\nperhaps that of new-mown hay.",
        "The exquisite beauty and delight of a fine summer day in the country has\nnever perhaps been more truly, and therefore more beautifully, described\nthan by Jefferies in his “Pageant of Summer.” “I linger,’” he says, “in\nthe midst of the long grass, the luxury of the leaves, and the song in the\nvery air. I seem as if I could feel all the glowing life the sunshine\ngives and the south wind calls to being. The endless grass, the endless\nleaves, the immense strength of the oak expanding, the unalloyed joy of\nfinch and blackbird; from all of them I receive a little.... In the\nblackbird’s melody one note is mine; in the dance of the leaf shadows the\nformed maze is for me, though the motion is theirs; the flowers with a\nthousand faces have collected the kisses of the morning. Feeling with\nthem, I receive some, at least, of their fulness of life. Never could I\nhave enough; never stay long enough.... The hours when the mind is\nabsorbed by beauty are the only hours when we really live, so that the\nlonger we can stay among these things so much the more is snatched from\ninevitable Time.... These are the only hours that are not wasted-these\nhours that absorb the soul and fill it with beauty. This is real life, and\nall else is illusion, or mere endurance. To be beautiful and to be calm,\nwithout mental fear, is the ideal of Nature. If I cannot achieve it, at\nleast I can think it.”",

        "Our countrymen derive great pleasure from the animal kingdom, in hunting,\nshooting, and fishing, thus obtaining fresh air and exercise, and being\nled into much varied and beautiful scenery. Still it will probably ere\nlong be recognized that even from a purely selfish point of view, killing\nanimals is not the way to get the greatest enjoyment from them. How much\nmore interesting would every walk in the country be, if Man would but\ntreat other animals with kindness, so that they might approach us without\nfear, and we might have the constant pleasure of watching their winning\nways. Their origin and history, structure and habits, senses and\nintelligence, offer an endless field of interest and wonder.",
        "The richness of life is wonderful. Any one who will sit down quietly on\nthe grass and watch a little will be indeed surprised at the number and\nvariety of living beings, every one with a special history of its own,\nevery one offering endless problems of great interest.",

        "  “Earth has not anything to show more fair;\n  Dull would he be of soul who could pass by\n  A sight so touching in its majesty:\n  This City now doth, like a garment, wear\n  The beauty of the morning; silent, bare,\n  Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie\n  Open unto the fields, and to the sky;\n  All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.\n  Never did sun more beautifully steep\n  In his first splendor, valley, rock, or hill;\n  Ne’er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!\n  The river glideth at its own sweet will:\n  Dear God! the very houses seem asleep;\n  And all that mighty heart is lying still!”",

        "“Flowers,” says Ruskin, “seem intended for the solace of ordinary\nhumanity. Children love them; quiet, tender, contented, ordinary people\nlove them as they grow; luxurious and disorderly people rejoice in them\ngathered. They are the cottager’s treasure; and in the crowded town mark,\nas with a little broken fragment of rainbow the windows of the workers in\nwhose heart rest the covenant of peace.” But in the crowded street, or\neven in the formal garden, flowers always seem, to me at least, as if they\nwere pining for the freedom of the woods and fields, where they can live\nand grow as they please.",
        "There are flowers for almost all seasons and all places. Flowers for\nspring, summer, and autumn, while even in the very depth of winter here\nand there one makes its appearance. There are flowers of the fields and\nwoods and hedgerows, of the seashore and the lake’s margin, of the\nmountain-side up to the very edge of the eternal snow.",
        "And what an infinite variety they present.",
        "  “Daffodils,\n  That come before the swallow dares, and take\n  The winds of March with beauty; violets, dim,\n  But sweeter than the lids of Juno’s eyes,\n  Or Cytherea’s breath; pale primroses,\n  That die unmarried, ere they can behold\n  Bright Phoebus in his strength, a malady\n  Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and\n  The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,\n  The flower-de-luce being one.” [5]",
        "Nor are they mere delights to the eye; they are full of mystery and\nsuggestions. They almost seem like enchanted princesses waiting for some\nprincely deliverer. Wordsworth tells us that",

Trees in our northern latitudes seldom own large flowers; and\nthough of course there are notable exceptions, such as the Horse-chestnut,\nstill even in these cases the flowers live only a few days, while the\nleaves last for months. Every tree indeed is a picture in itself: The\ngnarled and rugged Oak, the symbol and source of our navy, sacred to the\nmemory of the Druids, the type of strength, the sovereign of British\ntrees; the Chestnut, with its beautiful, tapering, and rich green, glossy\nleaves, its delicious fruit, and to the durability of which we owe the\ngrand and historic roof of Westminster Abbey.",
        "The Birch is the queen of trees, with her feathery foliage, scarcely\nvisible in spring but turning to leaves of gold in autumn; the pendulous\ntwigs tinged with purple, and silver stems so brilliantly marked with\nblack and white.",
        "The Elm forms grand masses of foliage which turn a beautiful golden yellow\nin autumn; and the Black Poplar with its perpendicular leaves, rustling\nand trembling with every breath of wind, towers over most other forest\ntrees.",
        "The Beech enlivens the country by its tender green in spring, rich green\nin summer, and glorious gold and orange in autumn, set off by the graceful\ngray stems; and has moreover, such a wealth of leaves that in autumn there\nare enough not only to clothe the tree itself but to cover the grass\nunderneath.",
        "If the Beech owes much to its delicate gray stem, even more beautiful is\nthe reddish crimson of the Scotch Pines, in such charming contrast with\nthe rich green of the foliage, by which it is shown off rather than\nhidden; and, with the green spires of the Firs, they keep the woods warm\nin winter.",
        "Nor must I overlook the smaller trees: the Yew with its thick green\nfoliage; the wild Guelder rose, which lights up the woods in autumn with\ntranslucent glossy berries and many-tinted leaves; or the Bryonies, the\nBriar, the Traveler’s Joy, and many another plant, even humbler perhaps,\nand yet each with some exquisite beauty and grace of its own, so that we\nmust all have sometimes felt our hearts overflowing with gladness and\ngratitude, as if the woods were full of music–as if",
        "  “The woods were filled so full with song\n  There seemed no room for sense of wrong.” [6]",
        "On the whole no doubt, woodlands are less beautiful in the winter: yet\neven then the delicate tracery of the branches, which cannot be so well\nseen when they are clothed with leaves, has a special beauty of its own;\nwhile every now and then hoar frost or snow settles like silver on every\nbranch and twig, lighting up the forest as if by enchantment in\npreparation for some fairy festival.",
        "I feel with Jefferies that “by day or by night, summer or winter, beneath\ntrees the heart feels nearer to that depth of life which the far sky\nmeans. The rest of spirit found only in beauty, ideal and pure, comes\nthere because the distance seems within touch of thought.”",
        "The general effect of forests in tropical regions must be very different\nfrom that of those in our latitudes. Kingsley describes it as one of\nhelplessness, confusion, awe, all but terror. The trunks are very lofty\nand straight, and rising to a great height without a branch, so that the\nwood seems at first comparatively open. In Brazilian forests, for\ninstance, the trees struggle upward, and the foliage forms an unbroken\ncanopy, perhaps a hundred feet overhead. Here, indeed, high up in the air\nis the real life of the forest. Everything seems to climb, to the light.\nThe quadrupeds climb, birds climb, reptiles climb, and the variety of\nclimbing plants is far greater than anything to which we are accustomed.",
        "Many savage nations worship trees, and I really think my first feeling\nwould be one of delight and interest rather than of surprise, if some day\nwhen I am alone in a wood one of the trees were to speak to me. Even by\nday there is something mysterious in a forest, and this is much more the\ncase at night.",
        "With wood, water seems to be naturally associated. Without water no\nlandscape is complete, while overhead the clouds add beauty to the heavens\nthemselves. The spring and the rivulet, the brook, the river, and the\nlake, seem to give life to Nature, and were indeed regarded by our\nancestors as living entities themselves. Water is beautiful in the morning\nmist, in the broad lake, in the glancing stream or the river pool, in the\nwide ocean, beautiful in all its varied moods. Water nourishes vegetation;\nit clothes the lowlands with green and the mountains with snow. It\nsculptures the rocks and excavates the valleys, in most cases acting\nmainly through the soft rain, though our harder rocks are still grooved by\nthe ice-chisel of bygone ages.",
        "The refreshing pour of water upon the earth is scarcely greater than that\nwhich it exercises on the mind of man. After a long spell of work how\ndelightful it is to sit by a lake or river, or on the seashore, and enjoy",

        "Every Englishman loves the sight of the Sea We feel that it is to us a\nsecond home. It seems to vivify the very atmosphere, so that Sea air is\nproverbial as a tonic, and makes the blood dance in our veins. The Ocean\ngives an impression of freedom and grandeur more intense perhaps than the\naspect of the heavens themselves. A poor woman from Manchester, on being\ntaken to the seaside, is said to have expressed her delight on seeing for\nthe first time something of which there was enough for everybody. The sea\ncoast is always interesting. When we think of the cliff sections with\ntheir histories of bygone ages; the shore itself teeming with seaweeds and\nanimals, waiting for the return of the tide, or thrown up from deeper\nwater by the waves; the weird cries of seabirds; the delightful feeling\nthat with every breath we are laying in a store of fresh life, and health,\nand energy, it is impossible to over-estimate all we owe to the sea.",
        "It is, moreover, always changing. We went for our holiday this year to\nLyme Regis. Let me attempt to describe the changes in the view from our\nwindows during a single day. Our sitting-room opened on to a little lawn,\nbeyond which the ground drops suddenly to the sea, while over about two\nmiles of water were the hills of the Dorsetshire coast–Golden Cap, with\nits bright crest of yellow sand, and the dark blue Lias Cliff of Black\nVen. When I came early down in the morning the sun was rising opposite,\nshining into the room over a calm sea, along an avenue of light; by\ndegrees, as it rose, the whole sea was gilt with light, and the hills\nbathed in a violet mist. By breakfast-time all color had faded from the\nsea–it was like silver passing on each side into gray; the sky was blue,\nflecked with fleecy clouds; while, on the gentler slopes of the coast\nopposite, fields and woods, and quarries and lines of stratification begin\nto show themselves, though the cliffs are still in shadow, and the more\ndistant headlands still a mere succession of ghosts, each one fainter than\nthe one before it. As the morning advances the sea becomes blue, the dark\nwoods, green meadows, and golden cornfields of the opposite coast more\ndistinct, and the details of the cliffs come gradually into view, and\nfishing-boats with dark sails begin to appear.",
        "Gradually the sun rises higher, a yellow line of shore appears under the\nopposite cliffs, and the sea changes its color, mapping itself out as it\nwere, the shallower parts turquoise blue, almost green; the deeper ones\ndeep violet.",
        "This does not last long–a thunderstorm comes up. The wind mutters\noverhead, the rain patters on the leaves, the coast opposite seems to\nshrink into itself, as if it would fly from the storm. The sea grows dark\nand rough, and white horses appear here and there.",
        "But the storm is soon over. The clouds break, the rain stops, the sun\nshines once more, the hills opposite come out again. They are divided now\nnot only into fields and woods, but into sunshine and shadow. The sky\nclears, and as the sun begins to descend westwards the sea becomes one\nbeautiful clear uniform azure, changing again soon to pale blue in front\nand dark violet beyond: and once more as clouds begin to gather again,\ninto an archipelago of bright blue sea and deep islands of ultramarine. As\nthe sun travels westward, the opposite hills change again. They scarcely\nseem like the same country. What was in sun is now in shade, and what was\nin shade now lies bright in the sunshine. The sea once more becomes a\nuniform solid blue, only flecked in places by scuds of wind, and becoming\npaler towards evening as the sun sinks, the cliffs which catch his setting\nrays losing their deep color and in some places looking almost as white as\nchalk, while at sunset they light up again for a moment with a golden\nglow, the sea at the same time sinking to a cold gray. But soon the hills\ngrow cold too, Golden Cap holding out bravely to the last, and the shades\nof evening settle over cliff and wood, cornfield and meadow.",
        "These are but a part, and a very small part, of the changes of a single\nday. And scarce any two days are alike. At times a sea-fog covers\neverything. Again the sea which sleeps to-day so peacefully sometimes\nrages, and the very existence of the bay itself bears witness to its\nforce.",
        "The night, again, varies like the day. Sometimes shrouded by a canopy of\ndarkness, sometimes lit up by millions of brilliant worlds, sometimes\nbathed in the light of a moon, which never retains the same form for two\nnights together.",
        "If Lakes are less grand than the sea, they are in some respects even more\nlovely. The seashore is comparatively bare. The banks of Lakes are often\nrichly clothed with vegetation which comes close down to the water’s edge,\nsometimes hanging even into the water itself. They are often studded with\nwell-wooded islands. They are sometimes fringed with green meadows,\nsometimes bounded by rocky promontories rising directly from comparatively\ndeep water, while the calm bright surface is often fretted by a delicate\npattern of interlacing ripples, or reflects a second, softened, and\ninverted landscape.",
        "To water again we owe the marvellous spectacle of the rainbow–\"God’s bow\nin the clouds.” It is indeed truly a heavenly messenger, and so unlike\nanything else that it scarcely seems to belong to this world.",
        "Many things are colored, but the rainbow seems to be color itself.",
        "    “First the flaming red\n  Sprang vivid forth; the tawny orange next,\n  And next delicious yellow; by whose side\n  Fell the kind beams of all-refreshing green.\n  Then the pure blue that swells autumnal skies,\n  Ethereal play’d; and then, of sadder hue\n  Emerged the deeper indigo (as when\n  The heavy-skirted evening droops with frost),\n  While the last gleamings of refracted light\n  Died in the fainting violet away.” [8]",
        "We do not, I think, sufficiently realize how wonderful is the blessing of\ncolor. It would have been possible, it would even seem more probable, that\nthough light might have enabled us to perceive objects, this could only\nhave been by shade and form. How we perceive color it is very difficult to\ncomprehend, and yet when we speak of beauty, among the ideas which come to\nus most naturally are those of birds and butterflies, flowers and shells,\nprecious stones, skies, and rainbows.",
        "Our minds might have been constituted exactly as they are, we might have\nbeen capable of comprehending the highest and sublimest truths, and yet,\nbut for a small organ in the head, the world of sound would have been shut\nout from us; we should have lost the sounds of nature, the charms of\nmusic, the conversation of friends, and have been condemned to perpetual\nsilence: and yet a slight alteration in the retina, which is not thicker\nthan a sheet of paper, not larger than a finger nail,–and the glorious\nspectacle of this beautiful world, the exquisite variety of form, the\nglory and play of color, the variety of scenery, of woods and fields, and\nlakes and hills, seas and mountains, the glory of the sky alike by day and\nnight, would all have been lost to us.",
        "Mountains, again, “seem to have been built for the human race, as at once\ntheir schools and cathedrals; full of treasures of illuminated manuscript\nfor the scholar, kindly in simple lessons for the worker, quiet in pale\ncloisters for the thinker, glorious in holiness for the worshipper. And of\nthese great cathedrals of the earth, with their gates of rock, pavements\nof cloud, choirs of stream and stone, altars of snow, and vaults of purple\ntraversed by the continual stars.” [9]",
        "All these beauties are comprised in Tennyson’s exquisite description of\nOenone’s vale–the city, flowers, trees, river, and mountains.",
        "  “There is a vale in Ida, lovelier\n  Than all the valleys of Ionian hills.\n  The swimming vapor slopes athwart the glen,\n  Puts forth an arm, and creeps from pine to pine,\n  And loiters, slowly drawn. On either hand\n  The lawns and meadow-ledges midway down\n  Hang rich in flowers, and far below them roars\n  The long brook falling thro’ the clov’n ravine\n  In cataract after cataract to the sea.\n  Behind the valley topmost Gargarus\n  Stands up and takes the morning; but in front\n  The gorges, opening wide apart, reveal\n  Troas and Ilion’s column’d citadel,\n  The crown of Troas.”",
        "And when we raise our eyes from earth, who has not sometimes felt “the\nwitchery of the soft blue sky;” who has not watched a cloud floating\nupward as if on its way to heaven, or when",
        "  “Sunbeam proof, I hang like a roof\n  The mountain its columns be.” [10]",
        "And yet “if, in our moments of utter idleness and insipidity, we turn to\nthe sky as a last resource, which of its phenomena do we speak of? One\nsays, it has been wet; and another, it has been windy; and another, it has\nbeen warm. Who, among the whole chattering crowd, can tell me of the forms\nand the precipices of the chain of tall white mountains that girded the\nhorizon at noon yesterday? Who saw the narrow sunbeam that came out of the\nsouth, and smote upon their summits until they melted and mouldered away\nin a dust of blue rain? Who saw the dance of the dead clouds when the\nsunlight left them last night, and the west wind blew them before it like\nwithered leaves? All has passed, unregretted as unseen; or if the apathy\nbe ever shaken off, even for an instant, it is only by what is gross, or\nwhat is extraordinary; and yet it is not in the broad and fierce\nmanifestations of the elemental energies, not in the clash of the hail,\nnor the drift of the whirlwind, that the highest characters of the sublime\nare developed.” [11]",
        "But exquisitely lovely as is the blue arch of the midday sky, with its\ninexhaustible variety of clouds, “there is yet a light which the eye\ninvariably seeks with a deeper feeling of the beautiful, the light of the\ndeclining or breaking day, and the flakes of scarlet cloud burning like\nwatch-fires in the green sky of the horizon.” [12] The evening colors\nindeed soon fade away, but as night comes on,",
        "    “How glorious the firmament\n  With living sapphires! Hesperus that led\n  The starry host, rode brightest; till the moon\n  Rising in clouded majesty, at length,\n  Apparent queen, unveiled her peerless light,\n  And o’er the dark her silver mantle threw.” [13]",
        "We generally speak of a beautiful night when it is calm and clear, and the\nstars shine brightly overhead; but how grand also are the wild ways of\nNature, how magnificent when the lightning flashes, “between gloom and\nglory;” when",

        "  “On our view the beautiful lights of heaven\n  Dawned through a circular opening in the cave,\n  Thence issuing, we again beheld the stars.”",
        "As we watch the stars at night they seem so still and motionless that we\ncan hardly realize that all the time they are rushing on with a velocity\nfar far exceeding any that man has ever accomplished.",
        "Like the sands of the sea, the stars of heaven have ever been used as an\nappropriate symbol of number, and we know that there are some 75,000,000,\nmany, no doubt, with planets of their own. But this is by no means all.\nThe floor of heaven is not only “thick inlaid with patines of bright\ngold,” but is studded also with extinct stars, once probably as brilliant\nas our own sun, but now dead and cold, as Helmholtz tells us our sun\nitself will be some seventeen millions of years hence. Then, again, there\nare the comets, which, though but few are visible to us at once, are even\nmore numerous than the stars; there are the nebulae, and the countless\nminor bodies circulating in space, and occasionally visible as meteors.",
        "Nor is it only the number of the heavenly bodies which is so overwhelming;\ntheir magnitude and distances are almost more impressive. The ocean is so\ndeep and broad as to be almost infinite, and indeed in so far as our\nimagination is the limit, so it may be. Yet what is the ocean compared to\nthe sky? Our globe is little compared to the giant orbs of Jupiter and\nSaturn, which again sink into insignificance by the side of the sun. The\nsun itself is almost as nothing compared with the dimensions of the solar\nsystem. Sirius is calculated to be a thousand times as great as the Sun,\nand a million times as far away. The solar system itself travels in one\nregion of space, sailing between worlds and worlds, and is surrounded by\nmany other systems as great and complex as itself; and we know that even\nthen we have not reached the limits of the Universe itself.",
        "There are stars so distant that their light, though traveling 180,000\nmiles in a second, yet takes years to reach us; and beyond all these are\nother systems of stars which are so far away that they cannot be perceived\nsingly, but even in our most powerful telescopes appear only as minute\nclouds or nebulae. It is, indeed, but a feeble expression of the truth to\nsay that the infinities revealed to us by Science,–the infinitely great\nin the one direction, and the infinitely small in the other,–go far\nbeyond anything which had occurred to the unaided imagination of Man, and\nare not only a never-failing source of pleasure and interest, but seem to\nlift us out of the petty troubles and sorrows of life.",

And yet it\nmakes much for contentedness of mind to look for the most part at home and\nto our own condition; or if not, to look at the case of people worse off\nthan ourselves, and not, as people do, to compare ourselves with those who\nare better off.... But you will find others, Chians, or Galatians, or\nBithynians, not content with the share of glory or power they have among\ntheir fellow-citizens, but weeping because they do not wear senators’\nshoes; or, if they have them, that they cannot be praetors of Rome; or if\nthey get that office, that they are not consuls; or if they are consuls,\nthat they are only proclaimed second and not first.... Whenever, then, you\nadmire any one carried by in his litter as a greater man than yourself,\nlower your eyes and look at those that bear the litter.” And again, “I am\nvery taken with Diogenes’ remark to a stranger at Lacedaemon, who was\ndressing with much display for a feast, ’Does not a good man consider\nevery day a feast?’ ... Seeing then that life is the most complete\ninitiation into all these things, it ought to be full of ease of mind and\njoy; and if properly understood, would enable us to acquiesce in the\npresent without repining, to remember the past with thankfulness, and to\nmeet the future hopefully and cheerfully without fear of suspicion.”",

        "Take even the most extreme type of difference. Is the man, says Plutarch,\n\"a criminal who holds there are no gods; and is not he that holds them to\nbe such as the superstitious believe them, is he not possessed with\nnotions infinitely more atrocious? I for my part would much rather have\nmen say of me that there never was a Plutarch at all, nor is now, than to\nsay that Plutarch is a man inconstant, fickle, easily moved to anger,\nrevengeful for trifling provocations, vexed at small things.”",

Herein lies the importance of common sense, the\ninstincts of a General, the sagacity of a Statesman.

We see him for a few moments, but we know not\nwhence he came nor whither he goes in the blackness of the storm outside.\nSo is the life of man. It appears for a short space in the warmth and\nbrightness of this life, but what came before this life, or what is to\nfollow this life, we know not. If, therefore, these new teachers can\nenlighten us as to the darkness that went before, and the darkness that is\nto come after, let us hear what they have to teach us.”",

It is\nextraordinary how slight a margin may stand for years between Man and some\nimportant improvement. Take the case of the electric light, for instance.\nIt had been known for years that if a carbon rod be placed in an exhausted\nglass receiver, and a current of electricity be passed through it the\ncarbon glowed with an intense light, but on the other hand it became so\nhot that the glass burst. The light, therefore, was useless, because the\nlamp burst as soon as it was lighted. Edison hit on the idea that if you\nmade the carbon filament fine enough, you would get rid of the heat and\nyet have abundance of light. Edison’s right to his patent has been\ncontested on this very ground. It has been said that the mere introduction\nof so small a difference as the replacement of a thin rod by a fine\nfilament was so slight an item that it could not be patented. The\nimprovements by Swan, Lane Fox, and others, though so important as a\nwhole, have been made step by step.",

We may, no doubt, expect much from the\nimprovement in our microscopes, the use of new re-agents, and of\nmechanical appliances; but the ultimate atoms of which matter is composed\nare so infinitesimally minute, that it is difficult to foresee any manner\nin which we may hope for a final solution of these problems.",
        "Loschmidt, who has since been confirmed by Stoney and Sir W. Thomson,\ncalculates that each of the ultimate atoms of matter is at most 1/50000000\nof an inch in diameter. Under these circumstances we cannot, it would\nseem, hope at present for any great increase of our knowledge of atoms by\nimprovements in the microscope. With our present instruments we can\nperceive lines ruled on glass which are 1/90000 of an inch apart; but\nowing to the properties of light itself, it would appear that we cannot\nhope to be able to perceive objects which are much less than 1/100000 of\nan inch in diameter. Our microscopes may, no doubt, be improved, but the\nlimitation lies not in the imperfection of our optical appliances, but in\nthe nature of light itself.",
        "It has been calculated that a particle of albumen 1/80000 of an inch in\ndiameter contains no less than 125,000,000 of molecules. In a simpler\ncompound the number would be much greater; in water, for instance, no less\nthan 8,000,000,000. Even then, if we could construct microscopes far more\npowerful than any which we now possess, they could not enable us to obtain\nby direct vision any idea of the ultimate organization of matter. The\nsmallest sphere of organic matter which could be clearly defined with our\nmost powerful microscopes may be, in reality, very complex; may be built\nup of many millions of molecules, and it follows that there may be an\nalmost infinite number of structural characters in organic tissues which\nwe can at present foresee no mode of examining.

        "Again, it has been shown that animals hear sounds which are beyond the\nrange of our hearing, and I have proved they can perceive the ultra-violet\nrays, which are invisible to our eyes. [4]",
        "Now, as every ray of homogeneous light which we can perceive at all,\nappears to us as a distinct color, it becomes probable that these\nultra-violet rays must make themselves apparent to animals as a distinct\nand separate color (of which we can form no idea), but as different from\nthe rest as red is from yellow, or green from violet. The question also\narises whether white light to these creatures would differ from our white\nlight in containing this additional color.",
        "These considerations cannot but raise the reflection how different the\nworld may–I was going to say must–appear to other animals from what it\ndoes to us. Sound is the sensation produced on us when the vibrations of\nthe air strike on the drum of our ear. When they are few, the sound is\ndeep; as they increase in number, it becomes shriller and shriller; but\nwhen they reach 40,000 in a second, they cease to be audible. Light is the\neffect produced on us when waves of light strike on the eye. When 400\nmillions of millions of vibrations of ether strike the retina in a second,\nthey produce red, and as the number increases the color passes into\norange, then yellow, green, blue, and violet. But between 40,000\nvibrations in a second and 400 millions of millions we have no organ of\nsense capable of receiving the impression. Yet between these limits any\nnumber of sensations may exist. We have five senses, and sometimes fancy\nthat no others are possible. But it is obvious that we cannot measure the\ninfinite by our own narrow limitations.",
        "Moreover, looking at the question from the other side, we find in animals\ncomplex organs of sense, richly supplied with nerves, but the function of\nwhich we are as yet powerless to explain. There may be fifty other senses\nas different from ours as sound is from sight; and even within the\nboundaries of our own senses there may be endless sounds which we cannot\nhear, and colors, as different as red from green, of which we have no\nconception. These and a thousand other questions remain for solution. The\nfamiliar world which surrounds us may be a totally different place to\nother animals. To them it may be full of music which we cannot hear, of\ncolor which we cannot see, of sensations which we cannot conceive. To\nplace stuffed birds and beasts in glass cases, to arrange insects in\ncabinets, and dried plants in drawers, is merely the drudgery and\npreliminary of study; to watch their habits, to understand their relations\nto one another, to study their instincts and intelligence, to ascertain\ntheir adaptations and their relations to the forces of Nature, to realize\nwhat the world appears to them; these constitute, as it seems to me at\nleast, the true interest of natural history, and may even give us the clue\nto senses and perceptions of which at present we have no conception.

        "But though we have thus a sure and certain hope of progress for the race,\nstill, as far as man is individually concerned, with advancing years we\ngradually care less and less, for many things which gave us the greatest\npleasure in youth. On the other hand, if our time has been well used, if\nwe have warmed both hands wisely “before the fire of life,” we may gain\neven more than we lose. If our strength becomes less, we feel also the\nless necessity for exertion. Hope is gradually replaced by memory: and\nwhether this adds to our happiness or not depends on what our life has\nbeen.",
        "There are of course some lives which diminish in value as old age\nadvances, in which one pleasure fades after another, and even those which\nremain gradually lose their zest; but there are others which gain in\nrichness and peace all, and more, than that of which time robs them.",
        "The pleasures of youth may excel in keenness and in zest, but they have at\nthe best a tinge of anxiety and unrest; they cannot have the fulness and\ndepth which may accompany the consolations of age, and are amongst the\nrichest rewards of an unselfish life.",
        "For as with the close of the day, so with that of life; there may be\nclouds, and yet if the horizon is clear, the evening may be beautiful.",
        "Old age has a rich store of memories. Life is full of",
        "  “Joys too exquisite to last,\n  And yet more exquisite when past.” [1]",
        "Swedenborg imagines that in heaven the angels are advancing continually to\nthe spring-time of their youth, so that those who have lived longest are\nreally the youngest; and have we not all had friends who seem to fulfil\nthis idea? who are in reality–that is in mind–as fresh as a child: of\nwhom it may be said with more truth than of Cleopatra that",
        "  “Age cannot wither nor custom stale\n  Their infinite variety.”",
        "“When I consider old age,” says Cicero, “I find four causes why it is\nthought miserable: one, that it calls us away from the transaction of\naffairs; the second, that it renders the body more feeble; the third, that\nit deprives us of almost all pleasures; the fourth, that it is not very\nfar from death. Of these causes let us see, if you please, how great and\nhow reasonable each of them is.”",
        "To be released from the absorbing affairs of life, to feel that one has\nearned a claim to leisure and repose, is surely in itself no evil.",
        "To the second complaint against old age, I have already referred in\nspeaking of Health.",
        "The third is that it has no passions. “O noble privilege of age! if indeed\nit takes from us that which is in youth our greatest defect.” But the\nhigher feelings of our nature are not necessarily weakened; or rather,\nthey may become all the brighter, being purified from the grosser elements\nof our lower nature.",
        "Then, indeed, it might be said that “Man is the sun of the world; more\nthan the real sun. The fire of his wonderful heart is the only light and\nheat worth gauge or measure.” [2]",
        "“Single,” says Manu, “is each man born into the world; single he dies;\nsingle he receives the rewards of his good deeds; and single the\npunishment of his sins. When he dies his body lies like a fallen tree upon\nthe earth, but his virtue accompanies his soul. Wherefore let Man harvest\nand garner virtue, that so he may have an inseparable companion in that\ngloom which all must pass through, and which it is so hard to traverse.”",
        "Is it not extraordinary that many men will deliberately take a road which\nthey know is, to say the least, not that of happiness? That they prefer to\nmake others miserable, rather than themselves happy?",
        "Plato, in the Phaedrus, explains this by describing Man as a Composite\nBeing, having three natures, and compares him to a pair of winged horses\nand a charioteer. “Of the two horses one is noble and of noble origin, the\nother ignoble and of ignoble origin; and the driving, as might be\nexpected, is no easy matter.” The noble steed endeavors to raise the\nchariot, but the ignoble one struggles to drag it down.",
        "“Man,” says Shelly, “is an instrument over which a series of external and\ninternal impressions are driven, like the alternations of an ever-changing\nwind over an Aeolian lyre, which move it by their motion to ever-changing\nmelody.”",
        "Cicero mentions the approach of death as the fourth drawback of old age.\nTo many minds the shadow of the end is ever present, like the coffin in\nthe Egyptian feast, and overclouds all the sunshine of life. But ought we\nso to regard death?",
        "Shelly’s beautiful lines,",
        "  “Life, like a Dome of many-colored glass,\n  Stains the white radiance of Eternity,\n  Until death tramples it to fragments,”",
        "contain, as it seems to me at least, a double error. Life need not stain\nthe white radiance of eternity; nor does death necessarily trample it to\nfragments.",
        "Man has, says Coleridge,",
        "              “Three treasures,–love and light\n  And calm thoughts, regular as infants’ breath;\n  And three firm friends, more sure than day and night,\n  Himself, his Maker, and the Angel Death.”",
        "Death is “the end of all, the remedy of many, the wish of divers men,\ndeserving better of no men than of those to whom she came before she was\ncalled.” [3]",
        "It is often assumed that the journey to",
        "  “The undiscovered country from whose bourne\n  No traveler returns”",
        "must be one of pain and suffering. But this is not so. Death is often\npeaceful and almost painless.",
        "Bede during his late illness was translating St. John’s Gospel into\nAnglo-Saxon, and the morning of his death his secretary, observing his\nweakness, said, “There remains now only one chapter, and it seems\ndifficult to you to speak.” “It is easy,” said Bede; “take your pen and\nwrite as fast as you can,” At the close of the chapter the scribe said,\n\"It is finished,” to which he replied, “Thou hast said the truth,\nconsummatum est.” He then divided his little property among the\nbrethren, having done which he asked to be placed opposite to the place\nwhere he usually prayed, said “Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and\nto the Holy Ghost,” and as he pronounced the last words he expired.",
        "Goethe died without any apparent suffering, having just prepared himself\nto write, and expressed his delight at the return of spring.",
        "We are told of Mozart’s death that “the unfinished requiem lay upon the\nbed, and his last efforts were to imitate some peculiar instrumental\neffects, as he breathed out his life in the arms of his wife and their\nfriend Suessmaier.”",
        "Plato died in the act of writing; Lucan while reciting part of his book on\nthe war of Pharsalus; Blake died singing; Wagner in sleep with his head on\nhis wife’s shoulder. Many have passed away in their sleep. Various high\nmedical authorities have expressed their surprise that the dying seldom\nfeel either dismay or regret. And even those who perish by violence, as\nfor instance in battle, feel, it is probable, but little suffering.",
        "But what of the future? There may be said to be now two principal views.\nThere are some who believe indeed in the immortality of the soul, but not\nof the individual soul: that our life is continued in that of our children\nwould seem indeed to be the natural deduction from the simile of St. Paul,\nas that of the grain of wheat is carried on in the plant of the following\nyear.",
        "So long indeed as happiness exists it is selfish to dwell too much on our\nown share in it. Admit that the soul is immortal, but that in the future\nstate of existence there is a break in the continuity of memory, that one\ndoes not remember the present life, and from this point of view is not the\nimportance of identity involved in that of continuous memory? But however\nthis may be according to the general view, the soul, though detached from\nthe body, will retain its conscious identity, and will awake from death,\nas it does from sleep; so that if we cannot affirm that",
        "  “Millions of spiritual creatures walk the Earth,\n  Unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep,” [4]",
        "at any rate they exist somewhere else in space, and we are indeed looking\nat them when we gaze at the stars, though to our eyes they are as yet\ninvisible.",
        "In neither case, however, can death be regarded as an evil. To wish that\nyouth and strength were unaffected by time might be a different matter.",
        "“But if we are not destined to be immortal, yet it is a desirable thing\nfor a man to expire at his fit time. For, as nature prescribes a boundary\nto all other things, so does she also to life. Now old age is the\nconsummation of life, just as of a play: from the fatigue of which we\nought to escape, especially when satiety is super-added.” [5]",
        "From this point of view, then, we need",
        "  “Weep not for death,\n    ’Tis but a fever stilled,\n  A pain suppressed,–a fear at rest,\n    A solemn hope fulfilled.\n  The moonshine on the slumbering deep\n  Is scarcely calmer. Wherefore weep?\"\n\n  “Weep not for death!\n    The fount of tears is sealed,\n  Who knows how bright the inward light\n    To those closed eyes revealed?\n  Who knows what holy love may fill\n  The heart that seems so cold and still.”",
        "Many a weary soul will have recurred with comfort to the thought that",
        "  “A few more years shall roll,\n    A few more seasons come,\n  And we shall be with those that rest\n    Asleep within the tomb.\n\n  “A few more struggles here,\n    A few more partings o’er,\n  A few more toils, a few more tears,\n    And we shall weep no more.”",
        "By no one has this, however, been more grandly expressed than by Shelley.",
        "  “Peace, peace! he is not dead, he doth not sleep!\n    He hath awakened from the dream of life.\n  ’Tis we who, lost in stormy visions, keep\n    With phantoms an unprofitable strife,\n  He has outsoared the shadows of our night.\n    Envy and calumny, and hate and pain,\n  And that unrest which men miscall delight,\n    Can touch him not and torture not again.\n    From the contagion of the world’s slow stain\n  He is secure, and now can never mourn\n    A heart grown cold, a head grown gray, in vain–”",
        "Most men, however, decline to believe that",
        "  “We are such stuff\n  As dreams are made of, and our little life\n  Is rounded with a sleep.” [6]",
        "According to the more general view death frees the soul from the\nencumbrance of the spirit, and summons us to the seat of judgment. In\nfact,",
        "  “There is no Death! What seems so is transition;\n    This life of mortal breath\n  Is but a suburb of the life elysian,\n    Whose portal we call Death.” [7]",
        "We have bodies, “we are spirits.” “I am a soul,” said Epictetus, “dragging\nabout a corpse.” The body is the mere perishable form of the immortal\nessence. Plato concluded that if the ways of God are to be justified,\nthere must be a future life.",
        "To the aged in either case death is a release. The Bible dwells most\nforcibly on the blessing of peace. “My peace I give unto you: not as the\nworld giveth, give I unto you.” Heaven is described as a place where the\nwicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest.",
        "But I suppose every one must have asked himself in what can the pleasures\nof heaven consist.",
        "                    “For all we know\n  Of what the blessed do above\n  Is that they sing, and that they love.” [8]",
        "It would indeed accord with few men’s ideal that there should be any\n\"struggle for existence” in heaven. We should then be little better off\nthan we are now. This world is very beautiful, if we could only enjoy it\nin peace. And yet mere passive existence–mere vegetation–would in itself\noffer few attractions. It would indeed be almost intolerable.",
        "Again, the anxiety of change seems inconsistent with perfect happiness;\nand yet a wearisome, interminable monotony, the same thing over and over\nagain forever and ever without relief or variety, suggests dulness rather\nthan bliss.",
        "I feel that to me, said Greg, “God has promised not the heaven of the\nascetic temper, or the dogmatic theologian, or of the subtle mystic, or of\nthe stern martyr ready alike to inflict and bear; but a heaven of purified\nand permanent affections–of a book of knowledge with eternal leaves, and\nunbounded capacities to read it–of those we love ever round us, never\nmisconceiving us, or being harassed by us–of glorious work to do, and\nadequate faculties to do it–a world of solved problems, as well as of\nrealized ideals.”",
        "  “For still the doubt came back,–Can God provide\n    For the large heart of man what shall not pall,\n  Nor through eternal ages’ endless tide\n    On tired spirits fall?\n\n  “These make him say,–If God has so arrayed\n    A fading world that quickly passes by,\n  Such rich provision of delight has made\n    For every human eye,\n\n  “What shall the eyes that wait for him survey\n    When his own presence gloriously appears\n  In worlds that were not founded for a day,\n    But for eternal years?” [9]",
        "Here science seems to suggest a possible answer: the solution of problems\nwhich have puzzled us here; the acquisition of new ideas; the unrolling\nthe history of the past; the world of animals and plants; the secrets of\nspace; the wonders of the stars and of the regions beyond the stars. To\nbecome acquainted with all the beautiful and interesting spots of our own\nworld would indeed be something to look forward to, and our world is but\none of many millions. I sometimes wonder as I look away to the stars at\nnight whether it will ever be my privilege as a disembodied spirit to\nvisit and explore them. When we had made the great tour fresh interests\nwould have arisen, and we might well begin again.",
        "Here there is an infinity of interest without anxiety. So that at last the\nonly doubt may be",
        "  “Lest an eternity should not suffice\n    To take the measure and the breadth and height\n  Of what there is reserved in Paradise\n    Its ever-new delight.” [10]",
        "Cicero surely did not exaggerate when he said, “O glorious day! when I\nshall depart to that divine company and assemblage of spirits, and quit\nthis troubled and polluted scene. For I shall go not only to those great\nmen of whom I have spoken before, but also to my son Cato, than whom never\nwas better man born, nor more distinguished for pious affection; whose\nbody was burned by me, whereas, on the contrary, it was fitting that mine\nshould be burned by him. But his soul not deserting me, but oft looking\nback, no doubt departed to these regions whither it saw that I myself was\ndestined to come. Which, though a distress to me, I seemed patiently to\nendure: not that I bore it with indifference, but I comforted myself with\nthe recollection that the separation and distance between us would not\ncontinue long. For these reasons, O Scipio (since you said that you with\nLaelius were accustomed to wonder at this), old age is tolerable to me,\nand not only not irksome, but even delightful. And if I am wrong in this,\nthat I believe the souls of men to be immortal, I willingly delude myself:\nnor do I desire that this mistake, in which I take pleasure, should be\nwrested from me as long as I live; but if I, when dead, shall have no\nconsciousness, as some narrow-minded philosophers imagine, I do not fear\nlest dead philosophers should ridicule this my delusion.”",
        "Nor can I omit the striking passage in the Apology, when pleading before\nthe people of Athens, Socrates says, “Let us reflect in another way, and\nwe shall see that there is great reason to hope that death is a good; for\none of two things–either death is a state of nothingness and utter\nunconsciousness, or, as men say, there is a change and migration of the\nsoul from this world to another. Now if you suppose that there is no\nconsciousness, but a sleep like the sleep of him who is undisturbed even\nby the sight of dreams, death will be an unspeakable gain. For if a person\nwere to select the night in which his sleep was undisturbed even by\ndreams, and were to compare with this the other days and nights of his\nlife, and then were to tell us how many days and nights he had passed in\nthe course of his life better and more pleasantly than this one, I think\nthat any man, I will not say a private man, but even the great king will\nnot find many such days or nights, when compared with the others. Now, if\ndeath is like this, I say that to die is gain; for eternity is then only a\nsingle night. But if death is the journey to another place, and there, as\nmen say, all the dead are, what good, O my friends and judges, can be\ngreater than this?",
        "“If, indeed, when the pilgrim arrives in the world below, he is delivered\nfrom the professors of justice in this world, and finds the true judges,\nwho are said to give judgment there,–Minos, and Rhadamanthus, and Aeacus,\nand Triptolemus, and other sons of God who were righteous in their own\nlife,–that pilgrimage will be worth making. What would not a man give if\nhe might converse with Orpheus, and Musaeus, and Hesiod, and Homer? Nay,\nif this be true, let me die again and again. I myself, too, shall have a\nwonderful interest in there meeting and conversing with Palamedes, and\nAjax the son of Telamon, and other heroes of old, who have suffered death\nthrough an unjust judgment; and there will be no small pleasure, as I\nthink, in comparing my own sufferings with theirs. Above all, I shall then\nbe able to continue my search into true and false knowledge; as in this\nworld, so also in that; and I shall find out who is wise, and who pretends\nto be wise, and is not. What would not a man give, O judges, to be able to\nexamine the leader of the great Trojan expedition; or Odysseus or\nSisyphus, or numberless others, men and women too! What infinite delight\nwould there be in conversing with them and asking them questions. In\nanother world they do not put a man to death for asking questions;\nassuredly not. For besides being happier in that world than in this, they\nwill be immortal, if what is said be true.",
        "“Wherefore, O judges, be of good cheer about death, and know of a\ncertainty that no evil can happen to a good man, either in life or after\ndeath. He and his are not neglected by the gods; nor has my own\napproaching end happened by mere chance. But I see clearly that to die and\nbe released was better for me; and therefore the oracle gave no sign. For\nwhich reason, also, I am not angry with my condemners, or with my\naccusers; they have done me no harm, although they did not mean to do me\nany good; and for this I may gently blame them. The hour of departure has\narrived, and we go our ways–I to die and you to live. Which is better God\nonly knows.”",
        "In the Wisdom of Solomon we are promised that–",
        "“The souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and there shall no\ntorment touch them.",
        "“In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die; and their departure is\ntaken for misery.",
        "“And their going from us to be utter destruction; but they are in peace.",
        "“For though they be punished in the sight of men, yet is their hope full\nof immortality.",
        "“And having been a little chastised, they shall be greatly rewarded: for\nGod proved them, and found them worthy for himself.”",
        "And assuredly, if in the hour of death the conscience is at peace, the\nmind need not be troubled. The future is full of doubt, indeed, but fuller\nstill of hope.",
        "If we are entering upon a rest after the struggles of life,",
        "  “Where the wicked cease from troubling,\n  And the weary are at rest,”",
        "that to many a weary soul will be a welcome bourne, and even then we may\nsay,",
        "  “O Death! where is thy sting?\n  O Grave! where is thy victory?”",
        "On the other hand, if we are entering on a new sphere of existence, where\nwe may look forward to meet not only those of whom we have heard so often,\nthose whose works we have read and admired, and to whom we owe so much,\nbut those also whom we have loved and lost; when we shall leave behind us\nthe bonds of the flesh and the limitations of our earthly existence; when\nwe shall join the Angels, and Archangels, and all the company of\nHeaven,–then, indeed, we may cherish a sure and certain hope that the\ninterests and pleasures of this world are as nothing compared to those of\nthe life that awaits us in our Eternal Home.",
