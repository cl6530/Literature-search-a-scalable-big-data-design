        "1. Six hundred years ago the duty of defending freedom fell to King\nRobert Bruce and the Scotch. And this is how it happened. The time was\nduring the crusades, when all Europe was marching to the East, and\nengaging in battle with the Moslems. Scotland had been an independent\ncountry for many years, but some of her princes were too weak for\nthose troublous times. The witches that deceived Macbeth seem to have\ncast a spell upon the prosperity of the country. Clan was at enmity\nwith clan, and one great chieftain waged relentless war with another.\nThe fierce nobles paid little heed to the king, and showed no regard\nfor the rights of the people. It seemed that peace and liberty had\ndeparted forever.",
        "2. Alexander III died, leaving no direct heir. The Scottish nobles\nassembled to elect who should be their king. The choice lay between\nRobert Bruce and John Balliol. As the nobles could not agree, the\nmatter was referred to King Edward I, of England, who decided in favor\nof Balliol. The new prince was weak, and, when he resented the\ninterference of King Edward in some of his affairs, he was easily\ndefeated and driven from the kingdom. Scotland was now regarded as a\nconquered country, and the people were terribly oppressed. The nobles\nwere deprived of their estates, and the poor people were taxed to the\nverge of starvation. For fifteen years King Edward held on to his\nusurped power, while the weak king Balliol was wandering in foreign\nlands, paying no attention to the distracted state of his country.",
        "3. At last the oppression became so great that conflicts took place\nalmost daily between the Scotch peasants and the English soldiery. On\none occasion, a young man named William Wallace was out a-fishing with\na boy to carry the fish. Two or three English soldiers came along and\ninsisted on taking the fish. Wallace offered to divide with them, but\nthey insisted on taking the whole, when he flew in a rage, killed one\nwith his fishing-pole, and, seizing a sword, put the others to flight.\nHe then fled, and concealed himself in the mountains until the matter\nblew over. On another occasion he killed an Englishman who insulted\nhim at a fair, and fled to his home, where he was pursued by the\nsoldiers. He escaped by the back door, but the cruel English leader,\nHazelrigg, put his wife and servants to death. From that time Wallace\ndevoted himself to fighting the English. He soon collected a band of\noutlaws and attacked the English whereever he found a favorable\nopportunity. He soon had the satisfaction of killing Hazelrigg, and of\ncapturing many important places.",
        "4. The Scotch rose everywhere and joined Wallace, who soon found\nhimself at the head of a formidable army. With this lie captured the\nEnglish fortresses, and finally defeated the chief English army under\nEarl Warren. Scotland was now free, but the English king hastened back\nfrom Flanders to punish the Scotch. The battle of Falkirk was fought\nJuly 22, 1298, and the Scotch were entirely defeated. Wallace again\nbecame a fugitive, but was betrayed into the hands of Edward, and was\nbeheaded and quartered, according to the barbarous custom of the\ntimes.",
        "5. The eyes of all Scotland were now turned to Robert Bruce as the\nonly remaining champion who would be likely to make head against the\nEnglish, and he accepted the proffered leadership. His principal rival\nwas a powerful noble called the Red Comyn, and with this rival Bruce\nsought to make friends. The two met in a church, and Comyn flatly\nrefused to join the Scottish cause, but openly proclaimed his\nadherence to the English. A quarrel arose, and, in the excitement,\nBruce stabbed Comyn. Almost paralyzed at his act, he rushed out of the\nhouse and called for his horse. His friends eagerly inquired what was\nthe matter. “I doubt,” said Bruce, “that I have slain the Red Comyn.\"\n“Do not leave the matter in doubt,” said Kirkpatrick; “I will make it\ncertain.” He and his companions then rushed into the church and soon\ndispatched Comyn with their daggers.",
        "6. This deed is the one great blot upon the name of Bruce, and\nbitterly did he repent of his rashness. It called down upon his\ndevoted head the anathema of the church for sacrilege in committing\nviolence before the holy altar. It arrayed against him the kinsmen and\nfriends of the Red Comyn, and it produced distrust in the minds of\nmany true friends of Scotland, who could never have confidence in such\nan impetuous leader. Bruce made a vow that, if he succeeded in\nsecuring the freedom of Scotland, he would do penance for his crime by\nentering upon a crusade and fighting for the holy sepulchre.",
        "7. On the 29th of March, 1306, Bruce was crowned king. His enemies\nimmediately attacked and defeated him, and he was obliged to take\nrefuge in the mountains of the Highlands. Here he was hunted like a\nwild animal, and was obliged to flee from one fastness to another. One\nof the most malignant of his enemies was Lord Lorn, a kinsman of the\nRed Comyn. At one time Bruce and his few followers were retreating\nthrough a narrow pass, when he was set upon by Lorn and a much\nsuperior force. Sending his followers ahead, he stopped his horse in\nthe narrow way, and covered their retreat. Upon seeing the king thus\nalone, three powerful highlandmen–a father and two sons–set upon\nhim, determined to kill him or take him prisoner for their master,\nLord Lorn. Bruce struck the first man who came up and seized his\nbridle such a blow with his sword as to cut off his hand and free the\nbridle. The man bled to death. The other brother seized him by the leg\nand attempted to throw him from his horse. The king, setting spurs to\nthe horse, made the animal spring forward so that the Highlander fell\nunder the horse’s feet, and, as he endeavored to rise, the king cleft\nhis head in two with his sword. The father, seeing his two sons thus\nslain, flew at Bruce and grasped him in his mantle so close to his\nbody that he could not have room to wield his long sword. But with an\niron hammer which hung at his saddle-bow, Bruce dashed out the brains\nof this new assailant. The dying man still clung to the king’s mantle,\nso that, to get free, Bruce was obliged to undo the brooch by which it\nwas fastened, and leave it with the mantle behind. This brooch fell\ninto the hands of Lorn, and was kept in the family for many\ngenerations as a memorial of Bruce.",
        "8. But Bruce was soon reduced to greater straits, and, without\nfollowers, was obliged to conceal himself in stables and caves. In all\nhis misfortunes he never gave up the cause of his country, and he\nsacredly devoted his life to the freedom of Scotland. After one of his\ndefeats he was lying one night on a wretched bed in a rude hut, while\ndebating in his own mind whether it were not best to enlist in a\ncrusade, when his attention was directed to a spider on the rafters\noverhead. He saw that the little spinner was trying to swing from one\nrafter to another, so as to fix his thread across the space. Time and\nagain it tried and failed. Admiring the perseverance of the creature,\nBruce began to count the number of times he tried. One, two, three,\nfour, five, six. It suddenly occurred to Bruce that this was just the\nnumber of times he had failed in his attempts against the enemy. He\nthen made up his mind that if the spider succeeded in the next trial\nhe would make one more endeavor to recover his kingdom, but if it\nfailed he would start at once for Palestine. The spider sprang into\nthe air, and this time succeeded, so the king resolved upon another\ntrial, and never after met with a defeat.",
        "9. Many a wild story is told of his feats of arms and hairbreadth\nescapes while he wandered about without a country. Sir Walter Scott,\nin his poem, “The Lord of the Isles,” records one of these legends. It\nis reported that, on one occasion, with his brother Edward and sister\nIsabel in a boat, he was driven by stress of weather to take refuge in\none of the Hebrides upon the western coast, the home of Roland, the\nLord of the Isles. It happened to be a festive occasion, a large\nassembly having met to celebrate the marriage of the Lord of the Isles\nwith the sister of the Lord of Lorn. As Bruce entered the\nbanquet-hall, Lorn recognized him:",
        "  10. “Now, by Columba’s shrine I swear,\n  And every saint that’s buried there,\n  ’Tis he himself!” Lorn sternly cries;\n  “And for my kinsman’s death he dies!\"\n  As loudly Roland calls, “Forbear!\n  Not in my sight while brand I wear,\n  O’ermatched by odds shall warrior fall,\n  Or blood of stranger stain my hall!\n  This ancient fortress of my race\n  Shall be misfortune’s resting-place,\n  Shelter or shield of the distressed,\n  No slaughter-house of shipwrecked guest!\"\n\n  11. “Talk not to me,” fierce Lorn replied,\n  “Of odds or match! When Comyn died,\n  Three daggers clashed within his side!\n  Talk not to me of sheltering hall,\n  The church of God saw Comyn fall!\n  On God’s own altar streamed his blood,\n  While o’er my prostrate kinsman stood\n  The ruthless murderer–e’en as now–\n  With armèd hand and scornful brow!\n  Up, all who love me! blow on blow,\n  And lay the outlawed felons low!”",
        "  12. Then waked the wild debate again,\n  With brawling threat and clamor vain,\n  Vassals and menials thronging in,\n  Lent their brute rage to swell the din;\n  When far and wide a bugle clang\n  From the dark, ocean upward rang.\n  “The abbot comes!” they cried at once,\n  “The holy man whose favored glance\n    Hath sainted visions known;\n  Angels have met him on the way,\n  Beside the blessed martyr’s bay,\n    And by Columba’s stone.\n  He comes our feuds to reconcile,\n  A sainted man from sainted isle;\n  We will his holy will abide,\n  The abbot shall our strife decide!\"\n\n  13. The abbot on the threshold stood,\n  And in his hands the holy rood;\n  Back on his shoulders flowed his hood,\n    The torch’s glaring ray\n  Showed, in its red and flashing light,\n  His withered cheek and amice white,\n  His blue eye glistening cold and bright,\n    His tresses scant and gray.\n  “Fair lords,” he said, “our lady’s love,\n  And peace be with you from above,\n    And benedicite!\n  But what means this? no peace is here!\n  Do dirks unsheathed suit bridal cheer?\n    Or are these naked brands\n  A seemly show for churchman’s sight,\n  When he comes summoned to unite\n    Betrothed hearts and hands?\"\n  Then, cloaking hate with fiery zeal,\n  Proud Lorn answered the appeal:\n    “Thou comest, O holy man,\n  True sons of blessed church to greet,\n  But little deeming here to meet\n    A wretch, beneath the ban\n  Of pope and church, for murder done\n  Even on the sacred altar-stone!\n  Well may’st thou wonder we should know\n  Such miscreant here, nor lay him low,\n  Or dream of greeting, peace, or truce,\n  With excommunicated Bruce!\n  Yet will I grant, to end debate,\n  Thy sainted voice decide his fate.\"\n\n  14. Then Roland pled the stranger’s cause\n  And knighthood’s oath and honor’s laws;\n  And Isabel on bended knee\n  Brought prayers and tears to back her plea;\n  And Edith lent her generous aid,\n  And wept, and Lorn for mercy prayed.\n\n  15. Then Argentine, in England’s name,\n  So highly urged his sovereign’s claim,\n  He waked a spark, that, long suppressed,\n  Had smoldered in Lord Roland’s breast;\n  And now, as from the flint the fire,\n  Flashed forth at once his generous ire.\n  “Enough of noble blood,” he said,\n  “By English Edward had been shed,\n  Since matchless Wallace first had been\n  In mockery crowned with wreaths of green,\n  And done to death by felon hand,\n  For guarding well his native land.\n  Where’s Nigel Bruce? and De la Haye,\n  And valiant Seaton–where are they?\n  Where Somerville, the kind and free?\n  And Fraser, flower of chivalry?\n  Have they not been on gibbet bound,\n  Their quarters flung to hawk and hound,\n  And hold we here a cold debate\n  To yield more victims to their fate?\n  What! can the English leopard’s mood\n  Never be gorged with Northern blood?\n  Was not the life of Athole shed\n  To soothe the tyrant’s sickened bed?\n  Nor must his word, till dying day,\n  Be  nought but quarter, hang, and slay?\"\n\n  16. “Nor deem,” said Dunnegan’s knight,\n  “That thou shalt brave alone the fight!\n  By saints of isle and mainland both,\n  By woden wild–my grandsire’s oath–\n  Let Rome and England do their worst;\n  Rowe’er attainted and accursed,\n  If Bruce shall e’er find friends again,\n  Once more to brave a battle-plain,\n  If Douglas couch again his lance,\n  Or Randolph dare another chance,\n  Old Torquil will not be to lack\n  With twice a thousand at his back;\n  Nay, chafe not at my bearing bold,\n  Good abbot! for thou knowest of old,\n  Torquil’s rude thought and stubborn will\n  Smack of the wild Norwegian still\n  Nor will I barter freedom’s cause\n  For England’s wealth or Rome’s applause!\"\n\n  17. The abbot seemed with eye severe,\n  The hardy chieftain’s speech to hear;\n  Then on King Robert turned the monk,\n  But twice his courage came and sunk,\n  Confronted with the hero’s look;\n  Twice fell his eye, his accents shook;\n  At length resolved in tone and brow,\n  Sternly he questioned him, “And thou\n  Unhappy, what hast thou to plead,\n  Why I denounce not on thy deed\n  That awful doom which canons tell\n  Shuts paradise and opens hell?\n  Anathema of power so dread,\n  It blends the living with the dead,\n  Bids each good angel soar away,\n  And every ill one claim his prey;\n  Expels thee from the church’s care,\n  And deafens Heaven against thy prayer;\n  Arms every hand against thy life,\n  Bans all who aid thee in the strife;\n  Nay, each whose succor, cold and scant,\n  With meanest alms relieves thy want;\n  Haunts thee when living; and, when dead,\n  Dwells on thy yet devoted head,\n  Rends honor’s ’scutcheon from thy hearse,\n  Stills o’er thy bier the holy verse,\n  And spurns thy corpse from hallowed ground\n  Flung like vile carrion to the hound;\n  Such is the dire and desperate doom\n  For sacrilege, decreed by Rome;\n  And such the well-deserved meed\n  Of thine unhallowed, ruthless deed.\"\n\n  18. “Abbot!” the Bruce replied, “thy charge\n  It boots me not to dispute at large;\n  This much, howe’er, I bid thee know,\n  No selfish vengeance dealt the blow,\n  For Comyn died his country’s foe.\n  Nor blame I friends whose ill-timed speed\n  Fulfilled my soon-repented deed,\n  Nor censure those from whose stern tongue\n  The dire anathema has rung.\n  I only blame my own wild ire,\n  By Scotland’s wrongs incensed to fire.\n  Heaven knows my purpose to atone,\n  Far as I may, the evil done,\n  And bears a penitent’s appeal,\n  From papal curse and prelate zeal.\n  My first and dearest task achieved,\n  Fair Scotland from her thrall relieved,\n  Shall many a priest in cope and stole\n  Say requiem for Red Comyn’s soul,\n  While I the blessèd cross advance,\n  And expiate this unhappy chance\n  In Palestine, with sword and lance.\n  But, while content the church should know\n  My conscience owns the debt I owe,\n  Unto de Argentine and Lorn\n  The name of traitor I return,\n  Bid them defiance, stern and high,\n  And give them in their throats the lie!\n  These brief words spoke, I speak no more,\n  Do as thou wilt; my shrift is o’er.\"\n\n  19. Like man by prodigy amazed,\n  Upon the king the abbot gazed;\n  Then o’er his pallid features glance\n  Convulsions of ecstatic trance.\n  His breathing came more thick and fast,\n  And from his pale-blue eyes were cast\n  Strange rays of wild and wandering light;\n  Uprise his locks of silver white,\n  Flushed is his brow, through every vein\n  In azure tides the currents strain,\n  And undistinguished accents broke\n  The awful silence e’er he spoke.\n\n  20. “De Bruce, I rose with purpose dread\n  To speak my curse upon thy head,\n  And give thee as an outcast o’er\n  To him who burns to shed thy gore;\n  But like the Midianite of old\n  Who stood on Zophin, heaven-controlled,\n  I feel within my aged breast\n  A power that can not be repressed.\n  It prompts my voice, it swells my veins,\n  It burns, it maddens, it constrains!\n  De Bruce, thy sacrilegious blow\n  Hath at God’s altar slain thy foe;\n  O’ermastered, yet by high behest,\n  I bless thee, and thou shalt be blest!\"\n  He spoke, and o’er the astonished throng\n  Was silence, awful, deep and long.\n  Again that light has fired his eye,\n  Again his form swells bold and high,\n  The broken voice of age is gone,\n  ’Tis vigorous manhood’s lofty tone\n  “Thrice vanquished on the battle-plain,\n  Thy followers slaughtered, fled, or ta’en,\n  A hunted wanderer on the wild,\n  On foreign shores a man exiled,\n  Disowned, deserted, and distressed,\n  I bless thee, and thou shalt be blessed\n  Blessed in the hall and in the field,\n  Under the mantle as the shield.\n  Avenger of thy country’s shame,\n  Restorer of her injured name,\n  Blessed in thy scepter and thy sword,\n  De Bruce, fair Scotland’s rightful lord,\n  Blessed in thy deeds and in thy fame,\n  What lengthened honors wait thy name!\n  In distant ages, sire to son\n  Shall tell the tale of freedom won,\n  And teach his infants, in the use\n  Of earliest speech, to falter Bruce.\n  Go then, triumphant! sweep along\n  Thy course, the theme of many a song!\n  The power, whose dictates swell my breast,\n  Hath blessed thee, and thou shalt be blessed!”",
        "21. With the faithful islanders Bruce remained for some months, while\nhis friends were making preparations for a rising upon the mainland.\nAt last the time came, and Bruce, at the head of a little force,\nlanded in the night and surprised and captured a castle held by the\nLord of Lorn. Holding this as a basis of operations, the king and his\nprincipal followers, Douglas and Randolph, went out in different\ndirections to arouse the people against their English oppressors, and\nto raise forces of sufficient strength to risk their cause in battle.\nThis was a matter of great hazard, as every movement of the Scotch was\nclosely watched by the enemy, and, when any one was suspected of\nopposing the English rule, he was at once imprisoned and probably\nexecuted. The patriots were obliged to move with great caution, and\noften to secrete themselves in the fastnesses of the mountains or in\nthe lonely huts of the peasants. Blood-hounds were employed to track\nthe fugitives, and it is related that Lorn at one time followed Bruce\nwith a blood-hound that had once been his own. The king, seeing that\nhe was followed by a large body of soldiers, divided his men into\nthree separate parties, hoping to throw the hound off the track. The\nblood-hound, when he came to the point of separation, would not even\nnotice the two other divisions, but followed that of the king. Finding\nhis last expedient had failed, Bruce ordered his whole party to\ndisperse, keeping with him only his foster-brother as an attendant.\nWhen Lorn discovered the party had broken up, he sent five of his men\nwho were speedy on foot to follow the king and put him to death. They\nran so fast that they soon gained sight of Bruce and his companion.\nThe two turned upon the five men of Lorn, who came up one by one,\nexhausted with running, and put them all to death.",
        "22. By this time Bruce was much fatigued, but he dared not stop to\nrest, for he could hear every moment the deep bay of the hound. At\nlength they came to a wood through which ran a small stream of water.\nInto the stream they waded and followed it for a long distance; the\nblood-hound followed the track to the water, but he could trace the\nscent no farther, and Lorn gave up the chase. But Bruce’s adventures\nwere not at an end. After resting themselves in the woods, the two set\nout to find some human habitation, or to fall in with some party of\ntheir friends. In the midst of the forest they met three men who\nlooked like ruffians. “They were well armed, and one of them bore a\nsheep on his back, which it seemed he had just stolen. They saluted\nthe king civilly, and he, replying to their salutation, asked them\nwhere they were going. The men answered that they were seeking for\nRobert Bruce, for they intended to join him. The king answered that,\nif they would go with him, he would conduct them where they could find\nthe Scottish king. Then the man who had spoken changed color, and\nBruce, who looked sharply at him, began to suspect that the ruffian\nguessed who he was, and that he and his companions had some design\nagainst his person, in order to gain the reward which had been offered\nfor his life.",
        "23. “So he said to them, ’My good friends, as we are not well\nacquainted with each other, you must go before us, and we will follow\nnear to you.’ ’You have no occasion to suspect any harm from us,’\nsaid the man. ’Neither do I suspect any,’ said Bruce, I but this is\nthe way it, which I choose to travel.’",
        "24. “The men did as he commanded, and thus they traveled till they\ncame to a waste and ruinous cottage, where the men proposed to dress\ndown part of the sheep which they were carrying. The king was glad to\nhear of food, but he insisted that two fires should be kindled, one\nfor himself and foster-brother at one end of the cottage, the other at\nthe other end for the three companions. The men did as he desired.\nThey broiled a quarter of the mutton for themselves, and gave another\nto the king and his attendant. They were obliged to eat it without\nbread or salt; but, as they were very hungry, they were glad to get\nfood in any shape, and partook of it heartily.",
        "25. “Then so heavy a drowsiness fell on King Robert that he greatly\ndesired to sleep. But, first, he desired his foster-brother to watch\nas he slept, for he had great suspicion of his new acquaintances. His\nfoster-brother promised to keep awake, and did his best to so keep his\nword. But the king had not been long asleep ere his foster-brother\nfell into a deep slumber also, for he had under-gone as much fatigue\nas the king.",
        "26. “When the three villains saw the king and his attendant were\nasleep, they made signs to each other, and, rising up, at once drew\ntheir swords with the purpose to kill them both. But the king slept\nbut lightly, and, as little noise as the traitors made in rising, he\nwas awakened by it, and, starting up, drew his sword and went to meet\nthem. At the same moment he pushed his foster-brother with his foot to\nawaken him, and he started up; but, ere he got his eyes cleared to see\nwhat was about him, one of the ruffians that were advancing to slay\nthe king killed him with the stroke of a sword. The king was now\nalone–one man against three, and in the greatest danger of his life;\nbut his amazing strength, and the good armor which he wore, freed him\nfrom this great danger, and he killed the men one by one.",
        "21. “King Robert was now alone, and he left the cottage very sorrowful\nfor the death of his foster-brother, and took himself in the direction\ntoward where he had directed his men to ensemble after their\ndispersion. It was now near night, and, the place of meeting being a\nfarm-house, he went boldly into it, where he found the mistress, an\nold true-hearted Scotchwoman, sitting alone. Upon seeing a stranger\nenter, she asked him who and what he was. The king answered that he\nwas a traveler, who was journeying through the country. ’All\ntravelers,’ answered the good woman, ’are welcome here for the sake of\none.’ ’and who is that one,’ said the king, ’for whose sake you make\nall travelers welcome?’ ’It is our lawful King Robert the Bruce,’\nanswered the mistress, ’who is the rightful lord of this country; and,\nalthough he is now pursued and hunted after with hounds and horns, I\nhope to live to see him king over all Scotland.’",
        "28. “’Since you love him so well, dame,’ said the king, ’know that you\nsee him before you. I am Robert the Bruce.’ ’You!’ said the good\nwoman in great surprise; ’and wherefore are you thus alone? Where are\nall your men?’ ’I have none with me at this moment,’ answered the\nBruce, ’and therefore I must travel alone.’ ’But that shall not be,’\nsaid the brave old dame, ’for I have two stout sons, gallant and\ntrusty men, who shall be your servants for life and death!’ So she\nbrought her sons, and, though she well knew the danger to which she\nexposed them, she made them swear fealty to the king; and they\nafterward became high officers in his service.” Now the loyal old\nwoman was getting everything ready for the king’s supper, when\nsuddenly there was a trampling of horse heard around the house. They\nthought it must be some of the English or John of Lorn’s men, and the\ngood wife called upon her sons to fight to the last for King Robert.\nBut, shortly after, the voices of James of Douglas and of Edward\nBrute, the king’s brother, were heard, who had come with a hundred and\nfifty horsemen to this farm-house, according to the instructions of\nthe king when they parted.",
        "“Robert the Bruce was right joyful to meet his brother and faithful\nfriend Lord James, and had no sooner found himself at the head of such\na considerable body of followers, than, forgetting hunger and\nweariness he began to inquire where the enemy who had pursued him so\nlong had taken up their quarters; ’for,’ said he, ’as they must\nsuppose we are totally scattered and fled, it is likely they will\nthink themselves quite secure, and disperse themselves into distant\nquarters, and keep careless watch.’",
        "“’That is very true,’ answered James of Douglas; ’for I passed a\nvillage where there are two hundred of them quartered who had placed\nno sentinels; and, if you have a mind to make haste, we may surprise\nthem this very night.’ Then there was nothing but mount and ride;\nand, as the Scots came by surprise on the body of the English whom\nDouglas had mentioned, and rushed suddenly into the village where they\nwere quartered, they easily dispersed and cut them to pieces; thus\ndoing their pursuers more injury than they themselves had received\nduring the long and severe pursuit of the preceding day.”",
        "On another occasion Bruce, with sixty men, was wandering in the county\nof Galloway, awaiting the gathering of forces. Now the people of\nGalloway are mostly friendly to the Lord of Lorn, and a large number\nof them collected, determined to capture him. They felt sure of the\nsuccess of their enterprise, as they had a blood-hound to track the\nking, and had such superior numbers.",
        "33. “Now Bruce, who was always watchful and vigilant, had received\nsome information of this party to come upon him suddenly in the night.\nAccordingly, he quartered his party of sixty men on the farther side\nof a deep and swift-running river, that had very steep and rocky\nbanks. There was but one ford by which this river could be crossed in\nthe neighborhood, and that ford was deep and narrow, so that two men\ncould scarcely get through abreast; the bank on which they were to\nland on the other side was steep, and the path that led upward from\nthe water’s edge extremely narrow and difficult.",
        "34. “Bruce caused his men to lie down and sleep, at a place about half\na mile distant from the river, while he, with two attendants, went\ndown to watch the ford, and thinking how easy the enemy might be kept\nfrom passing there, providing it was bravely defended–when he heard\nthe distant baying of a hound, which was always coming nearer and\nnearer. This was the blood-hound which was tracing the king’s steps to\nthe ford where he had crossed, and the two hundred Galloway men were\nalong with the animal and guided by it. Bruce thought of going back to\nawaken his men; but then he thought it might be some shepherd’s dog.\n’My men,’ said he, ’are sorely tired; I will not disturb them by the\nbarking of a cur till I know something more of the matter.’",
        "35. “So he stood and listened; and, by and by, as the cry of the hound\ncame nearer, he began to hear the trampling of horses, and the voices\nof men, and the ringing and clattering of armor; and then he was sure\nthe enemy were coming to the river-side. Then the king thought, ’If I\ngo back to give my men the alarm, these Galloway men will get through\nthe ford without opposition, and that would be a pity, since it is a\nplace so advantageous to make a defense against them.’ So he looked\nagain at the steep path and the deep river, and he thought it gave him\nso much advantage that he could defend the passage with his own hand\nuntil his men came to assist him. His armor was so good and strong\nthat he had no fears of their arrows, and therefore the combat was not\nso very unequal as it must have otherwise seemed. He therefore sent\nhis followers to waken his men, and remained alone on the bank of the\nriver.",
        "36. “In the meanwhile the noise and the trampling of the horses\nincreased, and, the moon being bright, Bruce saw the glancing arms of\nabout two hundred men, who came down to the opposite bank of the\nriver. The men of Galloway, on their part, saw but one solitary figure\nguarding the ford, and the foremost of them plunged into the river\nwithout minding him. Bruce, who stood high above them on the bank\nwhere they were to land, killed the foremost man with a thrust of his\nlong spear, and with a second thrust stabbed the horse, which fell\ndown, kicking and plunging in his agonies, on the narrow path, and so\npreventing the others from getting out of the river. In the confusion\nfive or six of the enemy were slain, or, having been borne down the\ncurrent, were drowned in the river. The rest were terrified, and drew\nback.",
        "37. “But, when they looked again and saw only one man, they themselves\nbeing so many, they cried out that their honor would be lost forever\nif they did not force their way; and encouraged each other with loud\ncries to plunge in and assault him. But by this time the king’s\nsoldiers came up to his assistance, and the Galloway men retreated and\ngave up their enterprise.”",
        "38. These successes of Bruce inspired great confidence, and he soon\nfound himself at the head of a formidable force. With this he marched\nup and down the country, and compelled the English to keep strictly\nwithin their castles and fortified places; and even several of these\nwere captured. King Edward I, of England, heard of these successes of\nBruce with astonishment and rage. Though old and sorely diseased, he\nraised a large army and marched for the north; but he had scarcely\ncrossed the Scottish border when his physician informed him that he\nhad but a few hours to live. He immediately called his son to his\nbed-side, and made him swear that he would push forward this\nexpedition against the Bruce; and he died cursing the whole Scotch\npeople. He even gave direction that his body should be boiled, and\nthat his bones, wrapped in a bull’s hide, should be carried at the\nhead of the army as often as the Scots attempted to recover their\nfreedom.",
        "39. Edward II was a weak prince, neither so wise nor so brave as his\nfather. He marched a little way on to Scotland, but, having no great\nliking for war, he turned and marched back into England. He\ndisregarded his father’s injunction about the disposition of his\nbones, but took them back to London, and deposited them in Westminster\nAbbey.",
        "40. From this time the cause of Bruce was a succession of victories.\nDuring the winter and spring one English fortress after another\nsurrendered, until there only remained the strong castle of Stirling\nheld by the English power. This castle was besieged, and Sir Philip\nMowbray, the commander, agreed to surrender it if it was not\nreinforced by the English before midsummer. Then came a cessation of\nhostilities, and a period of rest for the Scots. King Edward had made\nno arrangement to again interfere in Scottish affairs. But now, when\nSir Philip Mowbray, the governor of Stirling, came to London to tell\nthe king that Stirling, the last Scottish town of importance which\nremained in possession of the English, was to be surrendered if it\nwere not relieved by force of arms before midsummer, then all the\nEnglish nobles called out, it would be a sin and shame to permit the\nfair conquest which Edward I had made to be forfeited to the Scots for\nwant of fighting. It was, therefore, resolved that the king should go\nhimself to Scotland with as great forces as he could possibly muster.",
        "41. King Edward II, therefore, assembled one of the greatest armies\nwhich a king of England ever commanded. There were troops brought from\nall his dominions. Many brave soldiers from the French provinces which\nthe king of England enjoyed in France; many Irish, many Welsh, and all\nthe great English nobles and barons, with their followers, were\nassembled in one great army. The number was not less than one hundred\nthousand men.",
        "42. King Robert the Bruce summoned all his nobles and barons to join\nhim, when he heard of the great preparation which the king of England\nwas making. They were not so numerous as the English by many thousand\nmen. In fact, his whole army did not very much exceed thirty thousand\nmen, and they were much worse armed than the wealthy Englishmen; but\nthen Robert, who was at their head, was one of the most expert\ngenerals of the time, and the officers he had under him were his\nbrother Edward, his nephew Randolph, his faithful follower the\nDouglas, and other brave and experienced leaders, who commanded the\nsame men that had been accustomed to fight and gain victories under\nevery disadvantage of situation and numbers.",
        "43. The king, on his part, studied how he might supply, by address and\nstratagem, what he wanted in numbers and strength. He knew the\nsuperiority of the English both in their heavy-armed cavalry, which\nwere much better mounted and armed than those of the Scots, and in the\narchery, in which art the English were better than any people in the\nworld. Both these advantages he resolved to provide against. With this\npurpose, Bruce led his army down into a plain, near Stirling, called\nthe Park, near which, and beneath it, the English army must needs pass\nthrough a boggy country, broken with water-courses, while the Scots\noccupied hard, dry ground. He then caused all the hard ground upon the\nfront of his line of battle, where cavalry were likely to act, to be\ndug full of holes, about as deep as a man’s knee. They were filled\nwith light brushwood, and the turf was laid on the top, so that it\nappeared a plain field, while in reality it was all as full of these\npits as a honeycomb is of holes. He also, it is said, caused steel\nspikes, called calthrops, to be scattered up and down in the plain,\nwhere the English cavalry were most likely to advance, trusting to\nlame and destroy their horses.",
        "44. When his army was drawn, the line stretched north and south. On\nthe south it was terminated by the banks of the brook called\nBannockburn, which are so rocky that no troops could come on them\nthere. On the left the Scottish line extended near to the town of\nStirling. Bruce reviewed his troops very carefully; all the useless\nservants and drivers of carts, and such like, of whom there were very\nmany, he ordered to go behind a height called the Gillies’ Hill–that\nis, the Servants’ Hill. He then spoke to the soldiers, and expressed\nhis determination to gain the victory or to lose his life on the field\nof battle. He desired that all those who did not propose to fight to\nthe last would leave the field before the battle began, and that none\nwould remain except those who were determined to take the issue of\nvictory or death, as God should send it.",
        "45. Burns has expressed Bruce’s sentiments in his fiery poem.",
        "  46. Scots who have with Wallace bled,\n  Scots whom Bruce has often led,\n  Welcome to your gory bed\n    Or to victory!\n  Now’s the day, and now’s the hour;\n  See the front of battle lower;\n  See approach proud Edward’s power,\n    Chains, and slavery!\n\n  47. Who would be a traitor knave,\n  Who would fill a coward’s grave,\n  Who so base as be a slave,\n    Let him turn and flee!\n  Who for Scotland’s king and law,\n  Freedom’s sword will strongly draw,\n  Freeman stand, or freeman fa’,\n    Let him follow me!\n\n  48. By oppressions, woes, and pains,\n  By our sons in servile chains,\n  We will drain our dearest veins,\n    But they shall be free!\n  Lay the proud usurper low\n  Tyrants fall in every foe–\n  Liberty at every blow;\n    Let us do or die!",
        "49. When the main body of his army was thus placed in order, the king\nposted Randolph, with a body of horse, near to the church of St.\nMirau’s, commanding him to use the utmost diligence to prevent any\nsuccorers from being thrown into Stirling Castle. He then dismissed\nJames of Douglas and Sir Robert Keith, the marshal of the Scottish\narmy, in order that they might survey, as nearly as they could, the\nEnglish force, which was now approaching from Falkirk. They returned\nwith information that the approach of that vast host was one of the\nmost beautiful and terrible sights which could be seen; that the whole\ncountry seemed covered with men-at-arms on horse and foot; that the\nnumber of standard banners and pennants made so gallant a show, that\nthe bravest and most numerous host in Christendom might be alarmed to\nsee King Edward moving against them.",
        "50. It was upon the 23d of June, 1314, that the King of Scotland heard\nthe news that the English army were approaching Stirling. He drew out\nhis army, therefore, in the order which he had before resolved upon.\nAfter a short time, Bruce, who was looking out anxiously for the\nenemy, saw a body of English cavalry trying to get into Stirling from\nthe eastward. This was the Lord Clifford, who, with a chosen body of\neight hundred horse, had been detached to relieve the castle.",
        "51. “See, Randolph,” said the king to his nephew, “there is a rose\nfallen from your chaplet.” By this be meant that Randolph has lost\nsome honor by suffering the enemy to pass where he had been commanded\nto follow them. Randolph made no reply, but rushed against Clifford\nwith little more than half his number. The Scots were on foot. The\nEnglish turned to charge them with their lances, and Randolph drew up\nhis men in close order to receive them. He seemed to be in so much\ndanger that Douglas asked leave of the king to go and assist him. The\nking refused permission.",
        "52. “Let Randolph,” he said, “redeem his own fault. I can not break\nthe order of battle for his sake.” Still the danger appeared greater,\nand the English horse seemed entirely to encompass the small handful\nof Scottish infantry. “To please you,” said Douglas to the king, “my\nheart will not suffer me to stand idle and see Randolph perish. I must\ngo to his assistance.” He rode off accordingly, but long before they\nhad reached the place of combat they saw the English horses galloping\noff, many with their empty saddles.",
        "53. “Halt!” said Douglas to his men. “Randolph has gained the day.\nSince we were not soon enough to help him in the battle, do not let us\nlessen his glory by approaching the field.” Now, that was nobly done,\nespecially as Douglas and Randolph were always contending which should\nrise highest in the good opinion of the king and the nation.",
        "54. The van of the English army now came in sight, and a number of\ntheir bravest knights drew near to see what the Scottish were doing.\nThey saw King Robert dressed in his armor, and distinguished by a gold\ncrown which he wore over his helmet. He was not mounted on his great\nwar horse, because he did not expect to fight that evening. But he\nrode on a little pony up and down the ranks of his army, putting his\nmen in order, and carried in his hand a short battle-axe made of\nsteel. When the king saw the English horsemen draw near, he advanced a\nlittle before his own men, that he might look at them more nearly.",
        "55. There was a knight among the English called Sir Henry de Bohun,\nwho thought this would be a good opportunity to gain great fame to\nhimself and put an end to the war by killing King Robert. The king\nbeing poorly mounted, and having no lance, Bohun galloped on him\nsuddenly and furiously, thinking, with his long spear and his big\nstrong horse, easily to bear him down to the ground. King Robert saw\nhim and permitted him to come very near, then suddenly turned his pony\na little to one side, so that Sir Henry missed him with the lance\npoint, and was in the act of being carried past him by the career of\nhis horse. But as he passed, King Robert rose up in his stirrups and\nstruck Sir Henry on the head with his battle-axe so terrible a blow\nthat it broke to pieces his iron helmet, as if it had been a\nnut-shell, and hurled him from his saddle. He was dead before he\nreached the ground. This gallant action was blamed by the Scottish\nleaders, who thought Bruce ought not to have exposed himself to so\nmuch danger when the safety of the whole army depended on him. The\nking only kept looking at his weapon, which was injured by the force\nof the blow, and said, “I have broken my good battle-axe.” This is\nthe way Scott describes this incident in the “Lord of the Isles”:",
        "  56. O gay yet fearful to behold,\n  Flashing with steel and rough with gold,\n    And bristled o’er with balls and spears,\n  With plumes and pennons waving fair,\n  Was that bright battle front! for there\n    Rode England’s king and peers.\n\n  57. And who that saw that monarch ride,\n  His kingdom battling by his side,\n  Could then his direful doom foretell;\n  Fair was his seat in knightly selle,\n  And in his sprightly eye was set\n  Some sparks of the Plantagenet.\n  Though bright and wandering was his glance,\n  It flashed at sight of shield and lance.\n  “Knowest thou,” he said, “De Argentine,\n  Yon knight who marshals thus their line?\"\n\n  58. “The tokens on his helmet tell\n  The Bruce, my liege; I know him well.\"\n  “And shall the audacious traitor brave\n  The presence where our banners wave?\"\n  “So please my liege,” said Argentine,\n  “Were he but horsed on steed like mine,\n  To give him fair and knightly chance,\n  I would adventure forth my lance.\"\n\n  59. “In battle-day,” the king replied,\n  “Nice tourne rules are set aside;\n  Still must the rebel dare our wrath!\n  Set on him–sweep him from our path!\"\n  And, at King Edward’s signal, soon\n  Dashed from the ranks Sir Edward Bohun!\n\n  60. Of Hereford’s high blood he came,\n  A race renowned for knightly fame;\n  He burned before his monarch’s eye\n  To do some deed of chivalry.\n  He spurred his steed, he couched his lance,\n  And darted on the Bruce at once.\n  As motionless as rocks, that bide\n  The wrath of the advancing tide,\n  The Bruce stood fast; each breast beat high,\n  And dazzled was each gazing eye;\n  The heart had hardly time to think,\n  The eyelid scarce had time to wink,\n  While on the king, like flash of flame,\n  Spurred to full speed, the war-horse came!\n  The partridge may the falcon mock,\n  If that slight palfrey stand the shock;\n  But, swerving from the knight’s career,\n  Just as they met, Bruce shunned the spear;\n  Onward the baffled warrior bore\n  His course–but soon his course was o’er!\n  High in his stirrups stood the king,\n  And gave his battle-axe the swing.\n  Right on De Bohun, the whiles he passed,\n  Fell that stern dint–the first–the last!\n  Such strength upon the blow was put,\n  The helmet crushed like hazel-nut,\n  The axe-shaft, with its brazen clasp,\n  Was shivered to the gauntlet grasp.\n  Springs from the blow the startled horse,\n  Drops on the plain the lifeless corse;\n  First of that fatal field, how soon,\n  How sudden fell the fierce De Bohun!\n\n  61. One pitying glance the monarch shed\n  Where on the field his foe lay dead;\n  Then gently turned his palfrey’s head,\n  And, pacing back his sober way,\n  Slowly he gained his own array.\n  There round their king the leaders crowd\n  And blame his recklessness aloud,\n  That risked ’gainst each adventurous spear\n  A life so valued and so dear.\n  His broken weapon’s shaft surveyed\n  The king, and careless answer made\n  “My loss must pay my folly’s tax–\n  I’ve broke my trusty battle-axe”",
        "62. The next morning, being the 24th of June, at break of day the\nbattle began in terrible earnest. The English as they advanced saw the\nScots getting into lines. The Abbot of Inchaffray walked through their\nranks barefooted, and exhorted them to fight for their freedom. They\nkneeled down as he passed, and prayed to heaven for victory. King\nEdward, who saw this, called out: “They kneel down; they are asking\nforgiveness.” “Yes,” said a celebrated English baron, called Ingelram\nde Umphraville, “but they ask it from God, not from us; these men will\nconquer, or die upon the field.” The English king ordered his men to\nbegin the battle. The archers then bent their bows, and began to shoot\nso closely together that the arrows fell like flakes of snow on a\nChristmas-day.",
        "    63. Upon the right, behind the wood,\n    Each by his steed, dismounted, stood\n      The Scottish chivalry;\n    With foot in stirrup, hand on mane,\n    Fierce Edward Bruce can scarce restrain\n    His own keen heart, his eager train,\n    Until the archers gain the plain;\n    Then “Mount ye gallants free!\"\n    He cried; and, vaulting from the ground,\n    His saddle every horseman found.\n    On high their glittering crests they toss,\n    As springs the wild-fire from the moss;\n    The shield hangs down on every breast,\n    Each ready lance is in the rest,\n      And loud shouts Edward Bruce:\n    “Forth, marshal! on the peasant foe\n    We’ll tame the terrors of their bow,\n      And cut the bow-string loose!\"\n\n  64. Then spurs were dashed in chargers’ flanks,\n  They rushed among the archer ranks.\n  No spears were there the shock to let,\n  No stakes to turn the charge were set,\n  And bow shall yeoman’s armor slight,\n  Stand the long lance and mace of might?\n  Or what may their short swords avail,\n  ’Gainst barbed horse and shirt of mail?\n  Amid their ranks the chargers spring,\n  High o’er their heads the weapons swing,\n  And shriek and groan and vengeful shout\n  Give note of triumph and of rout!\n  Awhile, with stubborn hardihood,\n  Their English hearts the strife made good;\n  Borne down at length on every side,\n  Compelled to flight, they scatter wide.\n  Let stags of Sherwood leap for glee,\n  And bound the deer of Dallorn-Lee!\n  The broken bows of Bannock’s shore\n  Shall in the greenwood ring no more!\n  Round Wakefield’s merry May-pole now,\n  The maids may twine the summer bough,\n  May northward look with longing glance\n  For those that went to lead the dance,\n  For the blithe archers look in vain!\n  Broken, dispersed, in flight o’erta’en,\n  Pierced through, trod down, by thousands slain,\n  They cumber Bannock’s bloody plain!",
        "65. The fine English cavalry then advanced to support their archers,\nand to attack the Scottish line. But coming over the ground which was\ndug full of pits the horses fell into these holes, and the riders lay\ntumbling about, without any means of defense, and unable to rise, from\nthe weight of their armor. The Englishmen began to fall into general\ndisorder; and the Scottish king, bringing up more of his forces,\nattacked and pressed them still more closely.",
        "66. On a sudden an event happened which decided the victory. The\nservants and attendants on the Scottish camp bad been sent behind the\narmy to a place called Gillies’ Hill; but now, when they saw that\ntheir masters were like to gain the day, they rushed from their place\nof concealment with such weapons as they could get, that they might\nhave their share in the victory and in the spoil. The English, seeing\nthem come suddenly over the hill, mistook the disorderly rabble for a\nnew army coming up to sustain the Scots; and, losing all heart, began\nto shift every man for himself. Edward himself left the field as fast\nas he could ride, and was closely pursued by Douglas, with a party of\nhorse, who followed him as far as Dunbar, where the English had still\na friend in the governor, Patrick, Earl of Mans. The earl received\nEdward in his forlorn condition, and furnished him with a fishing\nskiff, or small ship, in which he escaped to England, having entirely\nlost his fine army, and a great number of his bravest nobles.",
        "67. The English never before or afterward lost so dreadful a battle as\nthat of Bannockburn, nor did the Scots ever gain one of the same\nimportance. Many of the best and bravest of the English nobility and\ngentry lay dead on the field; a great many more were made prisoners,\nand the whole of King Edward’s immense army was dispersed or\ndestroyed.",
        "68. Thus did Robert Bruce arise from the condition of an exile, hunted\nwith blood-bounds like a stag or beast of prey, to the rank of an\nindependent sovereign, universally acknowledged to be one of the\nwisest and bravest kings who then lived. The nation of Scotland was\nalso raised once more from the state of a distressed and conquered\nprovince to that of a free and independent state, governed by its own\nlaws, and subject to its own princes; and although the country was,\nafter the Bruce’s death, often subjected to great loss and distress,\nboth by the hostility of the English and by the unhappy civil wars\namong the Scots themselves, yet they never afterward lost the freedom\nfor which Wallace had laid down his life, and which King Robert had\nrecovered no less by his wisdom than by his weapons. And therefore\nmost just it is that, while the country of Scotland retains any\nrecollection of its history, the memory of these brave warriors and\nfaithful patriots ought to be remembered with honor and gratitude.",
        "69. In 1328, fourteen years after the battle of Bannockburn, peace was\nconcluded between England and Scotland, in which the English\nsurrendered all pretension to the Scottish crown. King Robert was now\nfifty-four years old, and he prepared to enter upon a crusade in\naccordance with his vow, and in expiation of his offense of slaying\nthe Red Comyn. But, being smitten with a fatal disease, he directed\nLord James, of Douglas, upon his death, to take his heart and carry it\nto Palestine, in fulfillment of his vow. Douglas accepted the sacred\ntrust, and encased the heart in silver, and hung it about his neck. On\nhis way to the Holy Land he turned aside to help the Spaniard in a\ncampaign against the Moors. In one battle, being sorely beset, he\nflung the heart of Bruce into the midst of the enemy, and followed it\nup with the war-cry of the Douglas, which had so often cheered to\nvictory among his native hills. At every step a Moslem bit the dust\nuntil he reached the spot where his master’s heart had fallen. Here he\nwas slain by the numbers which pressed in on every side, and he was\nfound with his body still in the attitude of guarding the heart. The\nbody of Lord James, together with the heart, were returned to Scotland\nThe precious relic–the last that remained of the Bruce, the greatest\nof Scottish kings–was deposited in Melrose Abbey, where it remains\nto-day a sacred shrine for every Scotchman, and for every lover of\nliberty. Rarely in the history of man has the prediction of the old\nabbot been so literally fulfilled:",
