        "A question is current in our looser English journalism touching what\nshould be done with the German Emperor after a victory of the Allies.\nOur more feminine advisers incline to the view that he should be shot.\nThis is to make a mistake about the very nature of hereditary monarchy.\nAssuredly the Emperor William at his worst would be entitled to say to\nhis amiable Crown Prince what Charles II. said when his brother warned\nhim of the plots of assassins: “They will never kill me to make you\nking.” Others, of greater monstrosity of mind, have suggested that he\nshould be sent to St. Helena. So far as an estimate of his\nhistorical importance goes, he might as well be sent to Mount Calvary.\nWhat we have to deal with is an elderly, nervous, not unintelligent\nperson who happens to be a Hohenzollern; and who, to do him justice,\ndoes think more of the Hohenzollerns as a sacred caste than of his own\nparticular place in it. In such families the old boast and motto of\nhereditary kingship has a horrible and degenerate truth. The king never\ndies; he only decays for ever.",
        "If it were a matter of the smallest importance what happened to the\nEmperor William when once his house had been disarmed, I should satisfy\nmy fancy with another picture of his declining years; a conclusion that\nwould be peaceful, humane, harmonious, and forgiving.",
        "In various parts of the lanes and villages of South England the\npedestrian will come upon an old and quiet public-house, decorated with\na dark and faded portrait in a cocked hat and the singular inscription,\n“The King of Prussia.” These inn signs probably commemorate the visit of\nthe Allies after 1815, though a great part of the English middle classes\nmay well have connected them with the time when Frederick II. was\nearning his title of the Great, along with a number of other territorial\ntitles to which he had considerably less claim. Sincere and\nsimple-hearted Dissenting ministers would dismount before that sign (for\nin those days Dissenters drank beer like Christians, and indeed\nmanufactured most of it) and would pledge the old valour and the old\nvictory of him whom they called the Protestant Hero. We should be using\nevery word with literal exactitude if we said that he was really\nsomething devilish like a hero. Whether he was a Protestant hero or not\ncan be decided best by those who have read the correspondence of a\nwriter calling himself Voltaire, who was quite shocked at Frederick’s\nutter lack of religion of any kind. But the little Dissenter drank his\nbeer in all innocence and rode on. And the great blasphemer of Potsdam\nwould have laughed had he known; it was a jest after his own heart. Such\nwas the jest he made when he called upon the emperors to come to\ncommunion, and partake of the eucharistic body of Poland. Had he been\nsuch a Bible reader as the Dissenter doubtless thought him, he might\nhaply have foreseen the vengeance of humanity upon his house. He might\nhave known what Poland was and was yet to be; he might have known that\nhe ate and drank to his damnation, discerning not the body of God.",
        "Whether the placing of the present German Emperor in charge of one of\nthese wayside public-houses would be a jest after his own heart\npossibly remains to be seen. But it would be much more melodious and\nfitting an end than any of the sublime euthanasias which his enemies\nprovide for him. That old sign creaking above him as he sat on the bench\noutside his home of exile would be a much more genuine memory of the\nreal greatness of his race than the modern and almost gimcrack stars and\ngarters that were pulled in Windsor Chapel. From modern knighthood has\ndeparted all shadow of chivalry; how far we have travelled from it can\neasily be tested by the mere suggestion that Sir Thomas Lipton, let us\nsay, should wear his lady’s sleeve round his hat or should watch his\narmour in the Chapel of St. Thomas of Canterbury. The giving and\nreceiving of the Garter among despots and diplomatists is now only part\nof that sort of pottering mutual politeness which keeps the peace in an\ninsecure and insincere state of society. But that old blackened wooden\nsign is at least and after all the sign of something; the sign of the\ntime when one solitary Hohenzollern did not only set fire to fields and\ncities, but did truly set on fire the minds of men, even though it were\nfire from hell.",
        "Everything was young once, even Frederick the Great. It was an\nappropriate preface to the terrible epic of Prussia that it began with\nan unnatural tragedy of the loss of youth. That blind and narrow savage\nwho was the boy’s father had just sufficient difficulty in stamping out\nevery trace of decency in him, to show that some such traces must have\nbeen there. If the younger and greater Frederick ever had a heart, it\nwas a broken heart; broken by the same blow that broke his flute. When\nhis only friend was executed before his eyes, there were two corpses to\nbe borne away; and one to be borne on a high war-horse through victory\nafter victory: but with a small bottle of poison in the pocket. It is\nnot irrelevant thus to pause upon the high and dark house of his\nchildhood. For the peculiar quality which marks out Prussian arms and\nambitions from all others of the kind consists in this wrinkled and\npremature antiquity. There is something comparatively boyish about the\ntriumphs of all the other tyrants. There was something better than\nambition in the beauty and ardour of the young Napoleon. He was at\nleast a lover; and his first campaign was like a love-story. All that\nwas pagan in him worshipped the Republic as men worship a woman, and all\nthat was Catholic in him understood the paradox of Our Lady of\nVictories. Henry VIII., a far less reputable person, was in his early\ndays a good knight of the later and more florid school of chivalry; we\nmight almost say that he was a fine old English gentleman so long as he\nwas young. Even Nero was loved in his first days: and there must have\nbeen some cause to make that Christian maiden cast flowers on his\ndishonourable grave. But the spirit of the great Hohenzollern smelt from\nthe first of the charnel. He came out to his first victory like one\nbroken by defeats; his strength was stripped to the bone and fearful as\na fleshless resurrection; for the worst of what could come had already\nbefallen him. The very construction of his kingship was built upon the\ndestruction of his manhood. He had known the final shame; his soul had\nsurrendered to force. He could not redress that wrong; he could only\nrepeat it and repay it. He could make the souls of his soldiers\nsurrender to his gibbet and his whipping-post; he could ’make the souls\nof the nations surrender to his soldiers. He could only break men in as\nhe had been broken; while he could break in, he could never break out.\nHe could not slay in anger, nor even sin with simplicity. Thus he stands\nalone among the conquerors of their kind; his madness was not due to a\nmere misdirection of courage. Before the whisper of war had come to him\nthe foundations of his audacity had been laid in fear.",
        "Of the work he did in this world there need be no considerable debate.\nIt was romantic, if it be romantic that the dragon should swallow St.\nGeorge. He turned a small country into a great one: he made a new\ndiplomacy by the fulness and far-flung daring of his lies: he took away\nfrom criminality all reproach of carelessness and incompleteness. He\nachieved an amiable combination of thrift and theft. He undoubtedly gave\nto stark plunder something of the solidity of property. He protected\nwhatever he stole as simpler men protect whatever they have earned or\ninherited. He turned his hollow eyes with a sort of loathsome affection\nupon the territories which had most reluctantly become his: at the end\nof the Seven Years’ War men knew as little how he was to be turned out\nof Silesia as they knew why he had ever been allowed in it. In Poland,\nlike a devil in possession, he tore asunder the body he inhabited; but\nit was long before any man dreamed that such disjected limbs could live\nagain. Nor were the effects of his break from Christian tradition\nconfined to Christendom; Macaulay’s world-wide generalisation is very\ntrue though very Macaulayese. But though, in a long view, he scattered\nthe seeds of war all over the world, his own last days were passed in a\nlong and comparatively prosperous peace; a peace which received and\nperhaps deserved a certain praise: a peace with which many European\npeoples were content. For though he did not understand justice, he could\nunderstand moderation. He was the most genuine and the most wicked of\npacifists. He did not want any more wars. He had tortured and beggared\nall his neighbours; but he bore them no malice for it.",
        "The immediate cause of that spirited disaster, the intervention of\nEngland on behalf of the new Hohenzollern throne, was due, of course,\nto the national policy of the first William Pitt. He was the kind of man\nwhose vanity and simplicity are too easily overwhelmed by the obvious.\nHe saw nothing in a European crisis except a war with France; and\nnothing in a war with France except a repetition of the rather fruitless\nglories of Agincourt and Malplaquet. He was of the Erastian Whigs,\nsceptical but still healthy-minded, and neither good enough nor bad\nenough to understand that even the war of that irreligious age was\nultimately a religious war. He had not a shade of irony in his whole\nbeing; and beside Frederick, already as old as sin, he was like a rather\nbrilliant schoolboy.",
        "But the direct causes were not the only causes, nor the true ones. The\ntrue causes were connected with the triumph of one of the two traditions\nwhich had long been struggling in England. And it is pathetic to record\nthat the foreign tradition was then represented by two of the ablest men\nof that age, Frederick of Prussia and Pitt; while what was really the\nold English tradition was represented by two of the stupidest men that\nmankind ever tolerated in any age, George III. and Lord Bute. Bute was\nthe figurehead of a group of Tories who set about fulfilling the fine if\nfanciful scheme for a democratic monarchy sketched by Bolingbroke in\n“The Patriot King.” It was bent in all sincerity on bringing men’s minds\nback to what are called domestic affairs, affairs as domestic as George\nIII. It might have arrested the advancing corruption of Parliaments and\nenclosure of country-sides, by turning men’s minds from the foreign\nglories of the great Whigs like Churchill and Chatham; and one of its\nfirst acts was to terminate the alliance with Prussia. Unfortunately,\nwhatever was picturesque in the piracy of Potsdam was beyond the\nimagination of Windsor. But whatever was prosaic in Potsdam was already\nestablished at Windsor; the economy of cold mutton, the heavy-handed\ntaste in the arts, and the strange northern blend of boorishness with\netiquette. If Bolingbroke’s ideas had been applied by a spirited person,\nby a Stuart, for example, or even by Queen Elizabeth (who had real\nspirit along with her extraordinary vulgarity), the national soul might\nhave broken free from its new northern chains. But it was the irony of\nthe situation that the King to whom Tories appealed as a refuge from\nGermanism was himself a German.",
        "We have thus to refer the origins of the German influence in England\nback to the beginning of the Hanoverian Succession; and thence back to\nthe quarrel between the King and the lawyers which had issue at Naseby;\nand thence again to the angry exit of Henry VIII. from the mediaeval\ncouncil of Europe. It is easy to exaggerate the part played in the\nmatter by that great and human, though very pagan person, Martin Luther.\nHenry VIII. was sincere in his hatred for the heresies of the German\nmonk, for in speculative opinions Henry was wholly Catholic; and the two\nwrote against each other innumerable pages, largely consisting of terms\nof abuse, which were pretty well deserved on both sides. But Luther was\nnot a Lutheran. He was a sign of the break-up of Catholicism; but he was\nnot a builder of Protestantism. The countries which became corporately\nand democratically Protestant, Scotland, for instance, and Holland,\nfollowed Calvin and not Luther. And Calvin was a Frenchman; an\nunpleasant Frenchman, it is true, but one full of that French capacity\nfor creating official entities which can really act, and have a kind of\nimpersonal personality, such as the French Monarchy or the Terror.\nLuther was an anarchist, and therefore a dreamer. He made that which is,\nperhaps, in the long run, the fullest and most shining manifestation of\nfailure; he made a name. Calvin made an active, governing, persecuting\nthing, called the Kirk. There is something expressive of him in the fact\nthat he called even his work of abstract theology “The Institutes.”",
        "In England, however, there were elements of chaos more akin to Luther\nthan to Calvin. And we may thus explain many things which appear rather\npuzzling in our history, notably the victory of Cromwell not only over\nthe English Royalists but over the Scotch Covenanters. It was the\nvictory of that more happy-go-lucky sort of Protestantism, which had in\nit much of aristocracy but much also of liberty, over that logical\nambition of the Kirk which would have made Protestantism, if possible,\nas constructive as Catholicism had been. It might be called the victory\nof Individualist Puritanism over Socialist Puritanism. It was what\nMilton meant when he said that the new presbyter was an exaggeration of\nthe old priest; it was his office that acted, and acted very harshly.\nThe enemies of the Presbyterians were not without a meaning when they\ncalled themselves Independents. To this day no one can understand\nScotland who does not realise that it retains much of its mediaeval\nsympathy with France, the French equality, the French pronunciation of\nLatin, and, strange as it may sound, is in nothing so French as in its\nPresbyterianism.",
        "In this loose and negative sense only it may be said that the great\nmodern mistakes of England can be traced to Luther. It is true only in\nthis, that both in Germany and England a Protestantism softer and less\nabstract than Calvinism was found useful to the compromises of courtiers\nand aristocrats; for every abstract creed does something for human\nequality. Lutheranism in Germany rapidly became what it is to-day–a\nreligion of court chaplains. The reformed church in England became\nsomething better; it became a profession for the younger sons of\nsquires. But these parallel tendencies, in all their strength and\nweakness, reached, as it were, symbolic culmination when the mediaeval\nmonarchy was extinguished, and the English squires gave to what was\nlittle more than a German squire the damaged and diminished crown.",
        "It must be remembered that the Germanics were at that time used as a\nsort of breeding-ground for princes. There is a strange process in\nhistory by which things that decay turn into the very opposite of\nthemselves. Thus in England Puritanism began as the hardest of creeds,\nbut has ended as the softest; soft-hearted and not unfrequently\nsoft-headed. Of old the Puritan in war was certainly the Puritan at his\nbest; it was the Puritan in peace whom no Christian could be expected to\nstand. Yet those Englishmen to-day who claim descent from the great\nmilitarists of 1649 express the utmost horror of militarism. An\ninversion of an opposite kind has taken place in Germany. Out of the\ncountry that was once valued as providing a perpetual supply of kings\nsmall enough to be stop-gaps, has come the modern menace of the one\ngreat king who would swallow the kingdoms of the earth. But the old\nGerman kingdoms preserved, and were encouraged to preserve, the good\nthings that go with small interests and strict boundaries, music,\netiquette, a dreamy philosophy, and so on. They were small enough to be\nuniversal. Their outlook could afford to be in some degree broad and\nmany-sided. They had the impartiality of impotence. All this has been\nutterly reversed, and we find ourselves at war with a Germany whose\npowers are the widest and whose outlook is the narrowest in the world.",
        "It is true, of course, that the English squires put themselves over the\nnew German prince rather than under him. They put the crown on him as an\nextinguisher. It was part of the plan that the new-comer, though royal,\nshould be almost rustic. Hanover must be one of England’s possessions\nand not England one of Hanover’s. But the fact that the court became a\nGerman court prepared the soil, so to speak; English politics were\nalready subconsciously committed to two centuries of the belittlement of\nFrance and the gross exaggeration of Germany. The period can be\nsymbolically marked out by Carteret, proud of talking German at the\nbeginning of the period, and Lord Haldane, proud of talking German at\nthe end of it. Culture is already almost beginning to be spelt with a k.\nBut all such pacific and only slowly growing Teutonism was brought to a\ncrisis and a decision when the voice of Pitt called us, like a trumpet,\nto the rescue of the Protestant Hero.",
        "Among all the monarchs of that faithless age, the nearest to a man was a\nwoman. Maria Theresa of Austria was a German of the more generous sort,\nlimited in a domestic rather than a national sense, firm in the ancient\nfaith at which all her own courtiers were sneering, and as brave as a\nyoung lioness. Frederick hated her as he hated everything German and\neverything good. He sets forth in his own memoirs, with that clearness\nwhich adds something almost superhuman to the mysterious vileness of his\ncharacter, how he calculated on her youth, her inexperience and her lack\nof friends as proof that she could be despoiled with safety. He invaded\nSilesia in advance of his own declaration of war (as if he had run on\nahead to say it was coming) and this new anarchic trick, combined with\nthe corruptibility of nearly all the other courts, left him after the\ntwo Silesian wars in possession of the stolen goods. But Maria Theresa\nhad refused to submit to the immorality of nine points of the law. By\nappeals and concessions to France, Russia, and other powers, she\ncontrived to create something which, against the atheist innovator even\nin that atheist age, stood up for an instant like a spectre of the\nCrusades. Had that Crusade been universal and whole-hearted, the great\nnew precedent of mere force and fraud would have been broken; and the\nwhole appalling judgment which is fallen upon Christendom would have\npassed us by. But the other Crusaders were only half in earnest for\nEurope; Frederick was quite in earnest for Prussia; and he sought for\nallies, by whose aid this weak revival of good might be stamped out, and\nhis adamantine impudence endure for ever. The allies he found were the\nEnglish. It is not pleasant for an Englishman to have to write the\nwords.",
        "This was the first act of the tragedy, and with it we may leave\nFrederick, for we are done with the fellow though not with his work. It\nis enough to add that if we call all his after actions satanic, it is\nnot a term of abuse, but of theology. He was a Tempter. He dragged the\nother kings to “partake of the body of Poland,” and learn the meaning of\nthe Black Mass. Poland lay prostrate before three giants in armour, and\nher name passed into a synonym for failure. The Prussians, with their\nfine magnanimity, gave lectures on the hereditary maladies of the man\nthey had murdered. They could not conceive of life in those limbs; and\nthe time was far off when they should be undeceived. In that day five\nnations were to partake not of the body, but of the spirit of Poland;\nand the trumpet of the resurrection of the peoples should be blown from\nWarsaw to the western isles.",
