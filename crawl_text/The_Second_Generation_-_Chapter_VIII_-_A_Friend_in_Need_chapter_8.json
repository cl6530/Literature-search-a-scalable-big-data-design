        "In the turmoil of his own affairs Arthur forgot his promise almost while\nhe was making it. Fortunately, as he was driving home, the sight of Dr.\nHargrave, marching absent-mindedly along near the post office, brought it\nto his mind again. With an impatient exclamation–for he prided himself\nupon fidelity to his given word, in small matters as well as in\nlarger–he turned the horse about. He liked Dory Hargrave, and in a way\nadmired him; Dory was easily expert at many of the sports at which Arthur\nhad had to toil before he was able to make even a passable showing. But\nDory, somehow, made him uncomfortable. They had no point of view in\ncommon; Dory regarded as incidental and trivial the things which seemed\nof the highest importance to Arthur. Dory had his way to make in the\nworld; Arthur had been spared that discomfort and disadvantage. Yet Dory\npersisted in pretending to regard Arthur as in precisely the same\nposition as himself; once he had even carried the pretense to the\nimpertinence of affecting to sympathize with Arthur for being so sorely\nhandicapped. On that occasion Arthur had great difficulty in restraining\nplain speech. He would not have been thus tactful and gentlemanly had he\nnot realized that Dory meant the best in the world, and was wholly\nunconscious that envy was his real reason for taking on such a\npreposterous pose. “Poor chap!” Arthur had reflected. “One shouldn’t\nblame him for snatching at any consolation, however flimsy.” In those\ndays Arthur often, in generous mood, admitted–to himself–that fortune\nhad been shamefully partial in elevating him, without any effort on his\npart, but merely by the accident of birth, far above the overwhelming\nmajority of young men. He felt doubly generous–in having such broad\nviews and in not aggravating the misfortunes of the less lucky by\nexpressing them.",
        "Dr. Hargrave and his son–his only child–and his dead wife’s sister,\nMartha Skeffington, lived in a quaint old brick house in University\nAvenue. A double row of ancient elms shaded the long walk straight up\nfrom the gate. On the front door was a huge bronze knocker which Arthur\nlifted and dropped several times without getting response. “Probably the\ngirl’s in the kitchen; and old Miss Skeffington is so deaf she couldn’t\nhear,” he thought. He had known the persons and the habits of that\nhousehold from earliest boyhood. He followed the path round the house\nand thus came in sight of a small outbuilding at the far corner of the\nyard, on the edge of the bank overlooking and almost overhanging the\nriver–Dory’s “workshop.” Its door was open and Arthur could see the\nwhole of the interior. Dory and a young woman were standing by a bench at\nthe window, were bending over something in which they seemed to be\nabsorbed. Not until Arthur stepped upon the doorsill did they lift their\nheads.",
        "“Hello, Artie!” cried Dory, coming forward with extended hand.",
        "Arthur was taking off his hat and bowing to the young woman. “Hello,\nTheo,” said he. “How d’ye do, Estelle?”",
        "Miss Wilmot shook hands with him, a shade constrainedly. “How are you,\nArthur?” she said.",
        "It was in his mouth to ask why she hadn’t been to see Adelaide. He\nchecked himself just in time. She and Adelaide were great friends as\nyoungsters at the public school, but the friendship cooled into\nacquaintance as Adelaide developed fashionable ideas and tastes. Also,\nEstelle had been almost a recluse since she was seventeen. The rest of\nthe Wilmots went into Saint X’s newly developed but flourishing\nfashionable society. They had no money to give return entertainments or\neven to pay their share of the joint, dances and card parties Arthur\ndecided to sheer off. “I came to ask you to the house for sup–dinner\nto-night,” said he. “It’s lonely–just mother and Del and me. Come and\ncheer us up. Come along with me now.”",
        "Dory looked confused. “I’m afraid I can’t,” he all but stammered.",
        "“Of course, I can’t blame you for not caring about coming.” This a\npoliteness, for Arthur regarded his invitation as an honor.",
        "“Oh, you didn’t understand me,” protested Dory. “I was thinking of\nsomething entirely different.” A pause during which he seemed to be\nreflecting. “I’ll be glad to come,” he finally said.",
        "“You needn’t bother to dress,” continued Arthur.",
        "Dory laughed–a frank, hearty laugh that showed the perfect white teeth\nin his wide, humorous-looking mouth. “Dress!” said he. “My other suit is,\nif anything, less presentable than this; and they’re all I’ve got, except\nthe frock–and I’m miserable in that.”",
        "Arthur felt like apologizing for having thus unwittingly brought out\nyoung Hargrave’s poverty. “You look all right,” said he.",
        "“Thanks,” said Dory dryly, his eyes laughing at Arthur.",
        "And, as a matter of fact, though Arthur had not been sincere, Dory did\nlook “all right.” It would have been hard for any drapery not to have set\nwell on that strong, lithe figure. And his face–especially the eyes–was\nso compelling that he would have had to be most elaborately overdressed\nto distract attention from what he was to what he wore.",
        "On the way to the Rangers, he let Arthur do the talking; and if Arthur\nhad been noticing he would have realized that Dory was not listening, but\nwas busy with his own thoughts. Also Arthur would have noticed that, as\nthey came round from the stables to the steps at the end of the front\nveranda, and as Dory caught sight of Adelaide, half-reclining in the\nhammock and playing with Simeon, his eyes looked as if he had been\nsuddenly brought from the darkness into the light.",
        "“Here’s Dory Hargrave, Del,” cried Arthur, and went on into the house,\nleaving them facing each other.",
        "“So glad you’ve come,” said Adelaide, her tone and manner at their\nfriendliest.",
        "But as she faced his penetrating eyes, her composure became less assured.\nHe looked straight at her until her eyes dropped–this while they were\nshaking hands. He continued to look, she feeling it and growing more and\nmore uncomfortable.",
        "“Why did you send for me?” he asked.",
        "She would have liked to deny or to evade; but neither was possible. Now\nthat he was before her she recalled his habit of compelling her always to\nbe truthful not only with him but–what was far worse–also with herself.\n“Did Arthur tell you I asked him to bring you?” she said, to gain time.",
        "“No,” was his reply. “But, as soon as he asked me, I knew.”",
        "It irritated her that this young man who was not at all a “man of the\nworld” should be able so easily to fathom her. She had yet to learn that\n“man of the world” means man of a very small and insignificant world,\nwhile Dory Hargrave had been born a citizen of the big world, the real\nworld–one who understands human beings, because his sympathies are broad\nas human nature itself, and his eyes clear of the scales of pretense. He\nwas an illustration of the shallowness of the talk about the loneliness\nof great souls. It is the great souls that alone are not alone. They\nunderstand better than the self-conscious, posing mass of mankind the\nweakness and the pettiness of human nature; but they also appreciate its\nother side. And in the pettiest creature, they still see the greatness\nthat is in every human being, in every living thing for that matter, its\nmajesty of mystery and of potentiality–mystery of its living mechanism,\npotentiality of its position as a source of ever-ascending forms of life.\nFrom the protoplasmal cell descends the genius; from the loins of the\nsodden toiler chained to the soil springs the mother of genius or genius\nitself. And where little people were bored and isolated, Dory Hargrave\ncould without effort pass the barriers to any human heart, could enter in\nand sit at its inmost hearth, a welcome guest. He never intruded; he\nnever misunderstood; he never caused the slightest uneasiness lest he\nshould go away to sneer or to despise. Even old John Skeffington was\nconfidential with him, and would have been friendly had not Dory avoided\nhim.",
        "Adelaide soon fell under the spell of this genius of his for inspiring\nconfidence. She had not fully disclosed her plans to herself; she\nhesitated at letting herself see what her fury against Theresa and Ross\nhad goaded her on to resolve. So she had no difficulty in persuading\nherself that she had probably sent for Dory chiefly to consult with him.\n“There’s something I want to talk over with you,” said she; “but wait\ntill after din–supper. Have you and Artie been playing tennis?”",
        "“No, he found me at home. Estelle Wilmot and I were playing with a\nmicroscope.”",
        "“Estelle–she has treated me shamefully,” said Adelaide. “I haven’t seen\nher for more than a year–except just a glimpse as I was driving down\nMonroe Street one day. How beautiful she has become! But, then, she\nalways was pretty. And neither her father nor her mother, nor any of the\nrest of the family is especially good-looking. She doesn’t in the least\nresemble them.”",
        "“There probably was a time when her father and mother really loved,” said\nDory. “I’ve often thought that when one sees a beautiful man or woman,\none is seeing the monument to some moment of supreme, perfect happiness.\nThere are hours when even the meanest creatures see the islands of\nenchantment floating in the opal sea.”",
        "Adelaide was gazing dreamily into the sunset. It was some time before she\ncame back, dropped from the impersonal to the personal, which is the\nnormal attitude of most young people and of all the self-absorbed.\nSimeon, who had been inspecting Dory from the far upper end of the\nhammock, now descended to the floor of the veranda, and slowly advanced\ntoward him. Dory put out his hand. “How are you, cousin?” he said,\ngravely shaking Simeon’s extended paw. Simeon chattered delightedly and\nsprang into Dory’s lap to nestle comfortably there.",
        "“I always thought you would fall in love with Estelle, some day,\"\nAdelaide was saying.",
        "Dory looked at Simeon with an ironical smile. “Why does she say those\nthings to me?” he asked. Simeon looked at Adelaide with a puzzled frown\nthat said, “Why, indeed?”",
        "“You and Estelle are exactly suited to each other,” explained she.",
        "“Exactly unsuited,” replied he. “I have nothing that she needs; she has\nnothing that I need. And love is an exchange of needs. Now, I have hurt\nyour vanity.”",
        "“Why do you say that?” demanded Adelaide.",
        "“You’d like to feel that your lover came to you empty-handed, asking\neverything, humbly protesting that he had nothing to give. And you know\nthat I–” He smiled soberly. “Sometimes I think you have really nothing I\nneed or want, that I care for you because you so much need what I can\ngive. You poor pauper, with the delusion that you are rich!”",
        "“You are frank,” said she, smiling, but not liking it.",
        "“And why shouldn’t I be? I’ve given up hope of your ever seeing the\nsituation as it is. I’ve nothing to lose with you. Besides, I shouldn’t\nwant you on any false terms. One has only to glance about him to shrink\nfrom the horrors of marriage based on delusions and lies. So, I can\nafford to be frank.”",
        "She gave him a puzzled look. She had known him all her life; they had\nplayed together almost every day until she was seventeen and went East,\nto school, with Janet Whitney. It was while she was at home on her first\nlong vacation that she had flirted with him, had trapped him into an\navowal of love; and then, having made sure of the truth which her vanity\nof conquest and the fascination of his free and frank manliness for her,\nthough she denied it to herself, had led her on to discover beyond doubt,\nshe became conscience-stricken. And she confessed to him that she loved\nRoss Whitney and was engaged to him; and he had taken the disclosure so\ncalmly that she almost thought he, like herself, had been simply\nflirting. And yet–She dimly understood his creed of making the best of\nthe inevitable, and of the ridiculousness of taking oneself too\nseriously. “He probably has his own peculiar way of caring for a woman,\"\nshe was now reflecting, “just as he has his own peculiar way in every\nother respect.”",
        "Arthur came, and their mother; and not until long after supper, when her\nfather had been got to bed, did she have the chance to continue the\nconversation. As soon as she appeared on the veranda, where Dory and\nArthur were smoking, Arthur sauntered away. She was alone with Dory; but\nshe felt that she had nothing to say to him. The surge of fury against\nRoss and Theresa had subsided; also, now that she had seen Theodore\nHargrave again, she realized that he was not the sort of man one tries to\nuse for the purpose she had on impulse formed, nor she the sort of woman\nwho, in the deliberateness of the second thought, carries into effect an\nimpulse to such a purpose.",
        "When they had sat there in the moonlight several minutes in silence, she\nsaid: “I find I haven’t anything especial to say to you, after all.”",
        "A wait, then from him: “I’m sorry. I had hoped–” He halted.",
        "“Hoped–what?”",
        "“Hoped it was off with you and Whitney.”",
        "“Has some one been saying it was?” she asked sharply.",
        "“No. I thought I felt it when I first saw you.”",
        "“Oh!” she said, enormously relieved. A pause, then constrainedly, “Your\nguess was right.”",
        "“And was that why you sent for me?”",
        "The assent of silence.",
        "“You thought perhaps you might–care for–me?”",
        "It seemed almost true, with him looking so earnestly and hopefully at\nher, and in the moonlight–moonlight that can soften even falsehood until\ntrue and false seem gently to merge. She hesitated to say No. “I don’t\nknow just what I thought,” she replied.",
        "But her tone jarred on the young man whose nerves were as sensitive as a\nthermostat. “You mean, when you saw me again, you felt you really didn’t\ncare,” he said, drawing back so that she could not see his face.",
        "“No,” she replied, earnestly and honestly. “Not that.” And then she flung\nout the truth. “Ross has engaged himself to Theresa Howland, a girl with\na huge big fortune. And I–I–”",
        "“You needn’t say it,” he interrupted, feeling how it was distressing her\nto confess. “I understand.”",
        "“I wasn’t altogether–wicked,” she pleaded. “I didn’t think of you wholly\nbecause I thought you cared for me. I thought of you chiefly because I\nfeel more at home with you than with anyone else. It has always seemed to\nme that you see me exactly as I am, with all the pretenses and\nmeannesses–yet not unkindly, either. And, while you’ve made me angry\nsometimes, when you have refused to be taken in by my best tricks, still\nit was as one gets angry with–with oneself. It simply wouldn’t last.\nAnd, as you see, I tell you anything and everything.”",
        "“You thought you’d engage yourself to me–and see how it worked out?”",
        "“I’m afraid I did.”",
        "A pause. She knew what he was going to say next, and waited for him to\nsay it. At last it came. “Well, now that there’s no deception, why\nshouldn’t you?”",
        "“Somehow, I don’t seem to mind–about Ross, so much. It–it was while I\nwas in with father this evening. You haven’t seen him since he became so\nill, but you will understand why he is a rebuke to all mean thoughts. I\nsuppose I’ll be squirming again to-morrow, but to-night I feel–”",
        "“That Ross has done you a great service. That you’ve lost nothing but a\ndangerous illusion; that you have been honorable with him, and all the\nwrong and the shame are upon him. You must feel it, for it is true.”",
        "Adelaide sighed. “I wish I were strong enough to feel it with my friends\njeering at me, as I can feel it now, Dory.”",
        "He moved nearer the hammock in which she was sitting. “Del,” he said,\n“shall we become engaged, with the condition that we’ll not marry unless\nwe both wish to, when the time comes?”",
        "“But you’re doing this only to help me–to help me in a weakness I ought\nto be ashamed of.”",
        "“Not altogether,” he replied. “You on your part give me a chance to win\nyou. You will look at me differently–and there’s a great deal in that, a\nvery great deal, Del.”",
        "She smiled–laughed. “I see what you mean.”",
        "But he looked gravely at her. “You promise to do your best to care? An\nengagement is a very solemn thing, Del. You promise?”",
        "She put out her hand. “Yes,” she answered. And, after a moment, in tones\nhe would have known meant opportunity had he been less in love with her,\nless modest about his own powers where she was concerned, she went on:\n“The night you told me you loved me I did not sleep. What you said–what\nI saw when you opened your heart to me–oh, Dory, I believed then, and I\nbelieve now, that the reason I have not loved you is because I am not\nworthy of you. And I’m afraid I never can–for just that reason.”",
        "He laughed and kissed her hand. “If that’s all that stands in the way,\"\nsaid he, “you’ll love me to distraction.”",
        "Her spirits went soaring as she realized that she had gained honorably\nall she had been tempted to gain by artifice. “But you said a while ago,\"\nshe reminded him mischievously, “that you didn’t need me.”",
        "“So I did,” said he, “but the fox shouldn’t be taken too literally as he\ntalks about the grapes that are out of reach.”",
        "Suddenly she was longing for him to take her in his arms and compel her\nto feel, and to yield to, his strength and his love. But he, realizing\nthat he was in danger of losing his self-control, released her hand and\ndrew away–to burn aloof, when he might have set her on fire.",
        "Ross Whitney found his cousin, Ernest Belden, in the Chicago express\nnext morning. When they were well on their way, Belden said: “I’m really\nsorry it’s all off between you and Adelaide, Ross.”",
        "Ross was silent, struggling against curiosity. Finally curiosity won.\n“How did you know, Ernest?” he asked.",
        "“On the way to the station I met Dory Hargrave looking like a sunrise. I\nasked him what was up–you know, he and I are like brothers. And he said:\n’I’ve induced Adelaide Ranger to promise to marry me.’ ’Why, I never knew\nyou cared about her in that way,’ said I. And he said: ’There’s lots of\nthings in this world you don’t know, Ernest, a lot of important things,\nand this is one of ’em. I’ve never cared about anybody else.’”",
        "Belden had been thinking that the engagement between Ross and Adelaide\nwas dissolved by mutual consent. A glance at Ross and he changed his\nmind; for, Ross was so amazed at Adelaide’s thus challenging him–it\ncould be nothing more than an audacious challenge–that he showed it. “I\nbeg your pardon, old man,” Belden said impulsively. “I didn’t appreciate\nthat I was making a prying brute of myself.”",
        "Ross decided that a “gentleman” would be silent under the suspicion of\nhaving been jilted, and that therefore he must be silent–on that\nsubject. “Not at all,” said he. “I suppose you haven’t heard yet that I’m\nengaged to Miss Howland, of Chicago.”",
        "“Ah–Really–I congratulate you,” said Belden.",
        "And Ross, seeing that his cousin understood precisely what he had\nintended he should, felt meaner than ever.",
