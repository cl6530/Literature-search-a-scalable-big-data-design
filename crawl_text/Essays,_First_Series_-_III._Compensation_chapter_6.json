        "Ever since I was a boy I have wished to write a discourse\non Compensation; for it seemed to me when very young that\non this subject life was ahead of theology and the people\nknew more than the preachers taught. The documents too\nfrom which the doctrine is to be drawn, charmed my fancy\nby their endless variety, and lay always before me, even\nin sleep; for they are the tools in our hands, the bread\nin our basket, the transactions of the street, the farm\nand the dwelling-house; greetings, relations, debts and\ncredits, the influence of character, the nature and\nendowment of all men. It seemed to me also that in it\nmight be shown men a ray of divinity, the present action of\nthe soul of this world, clean from all vestige of tradition;\nand so the heart of man might be bathed by an inundation of\neternal love, conversing with that which he knows was always\nand always must be, because it really is now. It appeared\nmoreover that if this doctrine could be stated in terms with\nany resemblance to those bright intuitions in which this\ntruth is sometimes revealed to us, it would be a star in many\ndark hours and crooked passages in our journey, that would\nnot suffer us to lose our way.",
        "I was lately confirmed in these desires by hearing a sermon\nat church. The preacher, a man esteemed for his orthodoxy,\nunfolded in the ordinary manner the doctrine of the Last\nJudgment. He assumed that judgment is not executed in this\nworld; that the wicked are successful; that the good are\nmiserable; and then urged from reason and from Scripture a\ncompensation to be made to both parties in the next life.\nNo offence appeared to be taken by the congregation at this\ndoctrine. As far as I could observe when the meeting broke\nup they separated without remark on the sermon.",
        "Yet what was the import of this teaching? What did the\npreacher mean by saying that the good are miserable in\nthe present life? Was it that houses and lands, offices,\nwine, horses, dress, luxury, are had by unprincipled men,\nwhilst the saints are poor and despised; and that a\ncompensation is to be made to these last hereafter, by\ngiving them the like gratifications another day,—bank-\nstock and doubloons, venison and champagne? This must be\nthe compensation intended; for what else? Is it that they\nare to have leave to pray and praise? to love and serve\nmen? Why, that they can do now. The legitimate inference\nthe disciple would draw was,—’We are to have such a good\ntime as the sinners have now’;—or, to push it to its\nextreme import,—’You sin now; we shall sin by and by; we\nwould sin now, if we could; not being successful, we\nexpect our revenge to-morrow.’",
        "The fallacy lay in the immense concession that the bad are\nsuccessful; that justice is not done now. The blindness of\nthe preacher consisted in deferring to the base estimate\nof the market of what constitutes a manly success, instead\nof confronting and convicting the world from the truth;\nannouncing the presence of the soul; the omnipotence of\nthe will; and so establishing the standard of good and\nill, of success and falsehood.",
        "I find a similar base tone in the popular religious works\nof the day and the same doctrines assumed by the literary\nmen when occasionally they treat the related topics. I\nthink that our popular theology has gained in decorum, and\nnot in principle, over the superstitions it has displaced.\nBut men are better than their theology. Their daily life\ngives it the lie. Every ingenuous and aspiring soul leaves\nthe doctrine behind him in his own experience, and all men\nfeel sometimes the falsehood which they cannot demonstrate.\nFor men are wiser than they know. That which they hear in\nschools and pulpits without afterthought, if said in\nconversation would probably be questioned in silence. If a\nman dogmatize in a mixed company on Providence and the\ndivine laws, he is answered by a silence which conveys well\nenough to an observer the dissatisfaction of the hearer, but\nhis incapacity to make his own statement.",
        "I shall attempt in this and the following chapter to record\nsome facts that indicate the path of the law of Compensation;\nhappy beyond my expectation if I shall truly draw the\nsmallest arc of this circle.",
        "POLARITY, or action and reaction, we meet in every part\nof nature; in darkness and light; in heat and cold; in\nthe ebb and flow of waters; in male and female; in the\ninspiration and expiration of plants and animals; in the\nequation of quantity and quality in the fluids of the\nanimal body; in the systole and diastole of the heart;\nin the undulations of fluids, and of sound; in the\ncentrifugal and centripetal gravity; in electricity,\ngalvanism, and chemical affinity. Superinduce magnetism\nat one end of a needle, the opposite magnetism takes\nplace at the other end. If the south attracts, the north\nrepels. To empty here, you must condense there. An\ninevitable dualism bisects nature, so that each thing\nis a half, and suggests another thing to make it whole;\nas, spirit, matter; man, woman; odd, even; subjective,\nobjective; in, out; upper, under; motion, rest; yea, nay.",
        "Whilst the world is thus dual, so is every one of its parts.\nThe entire system of things gets represented in every particle.\nThere is somewhat that resembles the ebb and flow of the sea,\nday and night, man and woman, in a single needle of the pine,\nin a kernel of corn, in each individual of every animal tribe.\nThe reaction, so grand in the elements, is repeated within\nthese small boundaries. For example, in the animal kingdom\nthe physiologist has observed that no creatures are favorites,\nbut a certain compensation balances every gift and every defect.\nA surplusage given to one part is paid out of a reduction from\nanother part of the same creature. If the head and neck are\nenlarged, the trunk and extremities are cut short.",
        "The theory of the mechanic forces is another example. What\nwe gain in power is lost in time, and the converse. The\nperiodic or compensating errors of the planets is another\ninstance. The influences of climate and soil in political\nhistory are another. The cold climate invigorates. The\nbarren soil does not breed fevers, crocodiles, tigers or\nscorpions.",
        "The same dualism underlies the nature and condition of man.\nEvery excess causes a defect; every defect an excess. Every\nsweet hath its sour; every evil its good. Every faculty\nwhich is a receiver of pleasure has an equal penalty put on\nits abuse. It is to answer for its moderation with its life.\nFor every grain of wit there is a grain of folly. For every\nthing you have missed, you have gained something else; and\nfor every thing you gain, you lose something. If riches\nincrease, they are increased that use them. If the gatherer\ngathers too much, Nature takes out of the man what she puts\ninto his chest; swells the estate, but kills the owner.\nNature hates monopolies and exceptions. The waves of the sea\ndo not more speedily seek a level from their loftiest tossing\nthan the varieties of condition tend to equalize themselves.\nThere is always some levelling circumstance that puts down\nthe overbearing, the strong, the rich, the fortunate,\nsubstantially on the same ground with all others. Is a man\ntoo strong and fierce for society and by temper and position\na bad citizen,—a morose ruffian, with a dash of the pirate\nin him?—Nature sends him a troop of pretty sons and daughters\nwho are getting along in the dame’s classes at the village\nschool, and love and fear for them smooths his grim scowl to\ncourtesy. Thus she contrives to intenerate the granite and\nfelspar, takes the boar out and puts the lamb in and keeps\nher balance true.",
        "The farmer imagines power and place are fine things. But\nthe President has paid dear for his White House. It has\ncommonly cost him all his peace, and the best of his manly\nattributes. To preserve for a short time so conspicuous an\nappearance before the world, he is content to eat dust\nbefore the real masters who stand erect behind the throne.\nOr, do men desire the more substantial and permanent\ngrandeur of genius? Neither has this an immunity. He who\nby force of will or of thought is great and overlooks\nthousands, has the charges of that eminence. With every\ninflux of light comes new danger. Has he light? he must\nbear witness to the light, and always outrun that sympathy\nwhich gives him such keen satisfaction, by his fidelity to\nnew revelations of the incessant soul. He must hate father\nand mother, wife and child. Has he all that the world loves\nand admires and covets?—he must cast behind him their\nadmiration, and afflict them by faithfulness to his truth,\nand become a byword and a hissing.",
        "This law writes the laws of cities and nations. It is in\nvain to build or plot or combine against it. Things refuse\nto be mismanaged long. Res nolunt diu male administrari.\nThough no checks to a new evil appear, the checks exist,\nand will appear. If the government is cruel, the governor’s\nlife is not safe. If you tax too high, the revenue will\nyield nothing. If you make the criminal code sanguinary,\njuries will not convict. If the law is too mild, private\nvengeance comes in. If the government is a terrific democracy,\nthe pressure is resisted by an over-charge of energy in the\ncitizen, and life glows with a fiercer flame. The true life\nand satisfactions of man seem to elude the utmost rigors or\nfelicities of condition and to establish themselves with\ngreat indifferency under all varieties of circumstances.\nUnder all governments the influence of character remains\nthe same,—in Turkey and in New England about alike. Under\nthe primeval despots of Egypt, history honestly confesses\nthat man must have been as free as culture could make him.",
        "These appearances indicate the fact that the universe is\nrepresented in every one of its particles. Every thing in\nnature contains all the powers of nature. Every thing is\nmade of one hidden stuff; as the naturalist sees one type\nunder every metamorphosis, and regards a horse as a running\nman, a fish as a swimming man, a bird as a flying man, a\ntree as a rooted man. Each new form repeats not only the\nmain character of the type, but part for part all the\ndetails, all the aims, furtherances, hindrances, energies\nand whole system of every other. Every occupation, trade,\nart, transaction, is a compend of the world and a\ncorrelative of every other. Each one is an entire emblem of\nhuman life; of its good and ill, its trials, its enemies,\nits course and its end. And each one must somehow accommodate\nthe whole man and recite all his destiny.",
        "The world globes itself in a drop of dew. The microscope\ncannot find the animalcule which is less perfect for being\nlittle. Eyes, ears, taste, smell, motion, resistance,\nappetite, and organs of reproduction that take hold on\neternity,—all find room to consist in the small creature.\nSo do we put our life into every act. The true doctrine of\nomnipresence is that God reappears with all his parts in\nevery moss and cobweb. The value of the universe contrives\nto throw itself into every point. If the good is there, so\nis the evil; if the affinity, so the repulsion; if the\nforce, so the limitation.",
        "Thus is the universe alive. All things are moral. That soul\nwhich within us is a sentiment, outside of us is a law. We\nfeel its inspiration; out there in history we can see its\nfatal strength. “It is in the world, and the world was made\nby it.” Justice is not postponed. A perfect equity adjusts\nits balance in all parts of life.  Hoi kuboi Dios aei\neupiptousi,—The dice of God are always loaded. The world\nlooks like a multiplication-table, or a mathematical equation,\nwhich, turn it how you will, balances itself. Take what\nfigure you will, its exact value, nor more nor less, still\nreturns to you. Every secret is told, every crime is punished,\nevery virtue rewarded, every wrong redressed, in silence and\ncertainty. What we call retribution is the universal necessity\nby which the whole appears wherever a part appears. If you see\nsmoke, there must be fire. If you see a hand or a limb, you\nknow that the trunk to which it belongs is there behind.",
        "Every act rewards itself, or, in other words integrates\nitself, in a twofold manner; first in the thing, or in\nreal nature; and secondly in the circumstance, or in\napparent nature. Men call the circumstance the retribution.\nThe causal retribution is in the thing and is seen by the\nsoul. The retribution in the circumstance is seen by the\nunderstanding; it is inseparable from the thing, but is\noften spread over a long time and so does not become\ndistinct until after many years. The specific stripes may\nfollow late after the offence, but they follow because\nthey accompany it. Crime and punishment grow out of one\nstem.  Punishment is a fruit that unsuspected ripens within\nthe flower of the pleasure which concealed it. Cause and\neffect, means and ends, seed and fruit, cannot be severed;\nfor the effect already blooms in the cause, the end\npreexists in the means, the fruit in the seed.",
        "Whilst thus the world will be whole and refuses to be\ndisparted, we seek to act partially, to sunder, to\nappropriate; for example,—to gratify the senses we sever\nthe pleasure of the senses from the needs of the character.\nThe ingenuity of man has always been dedicated to the\nsolution of one problem,—how to detach the sensual sweet,\nthe sensual strong, the sensual bright, etc., from the\nmoral sweet, the moral deep, the moral fair; that is, again,\nto contrive to cut clean off this upper surface so thin as\nto leave it bottomless; to get a one end, without an other\nend. The soul says, ’Eat;’ the body would feast. The soul\nsays, ’The man and woman shall be one flesh and one soul;’\nthe body would join the flesh only. The soul says, ’Have\ndominion over all things to the ends of virtue;’ the body\nwould have the power over things to its own ends.",
        "The soul strives amain to live and work through all things.\nIt would be the only fact. All things shall be added unto\nit,—power, pleasure, knowledge, beauty. The particular\nman aims to be somebody; to set up for himself; to truck\nand higgle for a private good; and, in particulars, to ride\nthat he may ride; to dress that he may be dressed; to eat\nthat he may eat; and to govern, that he may be seen. Men\nseek to be great; they would have offices, wealth, power,\nand fame. They think that to be great is to possess one side\nof nature,—the sweet, without the other side, the bitter.",
        "This dividing and detaching is steadily counteracted. Up\nto this day it must be owned no projector has had the\nsmallest success. The parted water reunites behind our\nhand. Pleasure is taken out of pleasant things, profit\nout of profitable things, power out of strong things, as\nsoon as we seek to separate them from the whole. We can\nno more halve things and get the sensual good, by itself,\nthan we can get an inside that shall have no outside, or\na light without a shadow. “Drive out Nature with a fork,\nshe comes running back.”",
        "Life invests itself with inevitable conditions, which\nthe unwise seek to dodge, which one and another brags\nthat he does not know, that they do not touch him;—but\nthe brag is on his lips, the conditions are in his soul.\nIf he escapes them in one part they attack him in another\nmore vital part. If he has escaped them in form and in\nthe appearance, it is because he has resisted his life\nand fled from himself, and the retribution is so much\ndeath. So signal is the failure of all attempts to make\nthis separation of the good from the tax, that the\nexperiment would not be tried,—since to try it is to be\nmad,—but for the circumstance, that when the disease\nbegan in the will, of rebellion and separation, the\nintellect is at once infected, so that the man ceases to\nsee God whole in each object, but is able to see the\nsensual allurement of an object and not see the sensual\nhurt; he sees the mermaid’s head but not the dragon’s\ntail, and thinks he can cut off that which he would have\nfrom that which he would not have. “How secret art thou\nwho dwellest in the highest heavens in silence, O thou\nonly great God, sprinkling with an unwearied providence\ncertain penal blindnesses upon such as have unbridled\ndesires!\"1",
        "1 St. Augustine, Confessions, B. I",
        "The human soul is true to these facts in the painting of\nfable, of history, of law, of proverbs, of conversation.\nIt finds a tongue in literature unawares. Thus the Greeks\ncalled Jupiter, Supreme Mind; but having traditionally\nascribed to him many base actions, they involuntarily made\namends to reason by tying up the hands of so bad a god. He\nis made as helpless as a king of England. Prometheus knows\none secret which Jove must bargain for; Minerva, another.\nHe cannot get his own thunders; Minerva keeps the key of\nthem:—",
        "A plain confession of the in-working of the All and of\nits moral aim. The Indian mythology ends in the same\nethics; and it would seem impossible for any fable to be\ninvented and get any currency which was not moral. Aurora\nforgot to ask youth for her lover, and though Tithonus is\nimmortal, he is old. Achilles is not quite invulnerable;\nthe sacred waters did not wash the heel by which Thetis\nheld him. Siegfried, in the Nibelungen, is not quite\nimmortal, for a leaf fell on his back whilst he was\nbathing in the dragon’s blood, and that spot which it\ncovered is mortal. And so it must be. There is a crack\nin every thing God has made. It would seem there is always\nthis vindictive circumstance stealing in at unawares even\ninto the wild poesy in which the human fancy attempted to\nmake bold holiday and to shake itself free of the old laws,\n—this back-stroke, this kick of the gun, certifying that\nthe law is fatal; that in nature nothing can be given, all\nthings are sold.",
        "This is that ancient doctrine of Nemesis, who keeps watch\nin the universe and lets no offence go unchastised. The\nFuries they said are attendants on justice, and if the sun\nin heaven should transgress his path they would punish him.\nThe poets related that stone walls and iron swords and\nleathern thongs had an occult sympathy with the wrongs of\ntheir owners; that the belt which Ajax gave Hector dragged\nthe Trojan hero over the field at the wheels of the car of\nAchilles, and the sword which Hector gave Ajax was that on\nwhose point Ajax fell. They recorded that when the Thasians\nerected a statue to Theagenes, a victor in the games, one\nof his rivals went to it by night and endeavored to throw\nit down by repeated blows, until at last he moved it from\nits pedestal and was crushed to death beneath its fall.",
        "This voice of fable has in it somewhat divine. It came\nfrom thought above the will of the writer. That is the\nbest part of each writer which has nothing private in\nit; that which he does not know; that which flowed out\nof his constitution and not from his too active invention;\nthat which in the study of a single artist you might not\neasily find, but in the study of many you would abstract\nas the spirit of them all.  Phidias it is not, but the\nwork of man in that early Hellenic world that I would know.\nThe name and circumstance of Phidias, however convenient\nfor history, embarrass when we come to the highest\ncriticism. We are to see that which man was tending to do\nin a given period, and was hindered, or, if you will,\nmodified in doing, by the interfering volitions of Phidias,\nof Dante, of Shakspeare, the organ whereby man at the moment\nwrought.",
        "Still more striking is the expression of this fact in the\nproverbs of all nations, which are always the literature\nof reason, or the statements of an absolute truth without\nqualification. Proverbs, like the sacred books of each\nnation, are the sanctuary of the intuitions. That which\nthe droning world, chained to appearances, will not allow\nthe realist to say in his own words, it will suffer him to\nsay in proverbs without contradiction. And this law of laws,\nwhich the pulpit, the senate and the college deny, is hourly\npreached in all markets and workshops by flights of proverbs,\nwhose teaching is as true and as omnipresent as that of birds\nand flies.",
        "All things are double, one against another.—Tit for tat;\nan eye for an eye; a tooth for a tooth; blood for blood;\nmeasure for measure; love for love.—Give and it shall be\ngiven you.—He that watereth shall be watered himself.—\nWhat will you have? quoth God; pay for it and take it.—\nNothing venture, nothing have.—Thou shalt be paid exactly\nfor what thou hast done, no more, no less.—Who doth not\nwork shall not eat.—Harm watch, harm catch. —Curses always\nrecoil on the head of him who imprecates them.—If you put\na chain around the neck of a slave, the other end fastens\nitself around your own.—Bad counsel confounds the adviser.\n—The Devil is an ass.",
        "It is thus written, because it is thus in life. Our action\nis overmastered and characterized above our will by the law\nof nature. We aim at a petty end quite aside from the public\ngood, but our act arranges itself by irresistible magnetism\nin a line with the poles of the world.",
        "A man cannot speak but he judges himself. With his will\nor against his will he draws his portrait to the eye of\nhis companions by every word. Every opinion reacts on him\nwho utters it. It is a thread-ball thrown at a mark, but\nthe other end remains in the thrower’s bag. Or rather it\nis a harpoon hurled at the whale, unwinding, as it flies,\na coil of cord in the boat, and, if the harpoon is not\ngood, or not well thrown, it will go nigh to cut the\nsteersman in twain or to sink the boat.",
        "You cannot do wrong without suffering wrong. “No man had\never a point of pride that was not injurious to him,” said\nBurke. The exclusive in fashionable life does not see that\nhe excludes himself from enjoyment, in the attempt to\nappropriate it. The exclusionist in religion does not see\nthat he shuts the door of heaven on himself, in striving\nto shut out others. Treat men as pawns and ninepins and you\nshall suffer as well as they. If you leave out their heart,\nyou shall lose your own. The senses would make things of all\npersons; of women, of children, of the poor. The vulgar\nproverb, “I will get it from his purse or get it from his\nskin,” is sound philosophy.",
        "All infractions of love and equity in our social relations\nare speedily punished. They are punished by fear.  Whilst\nI stand in simple relations to my fellow-man, I have no\ndispleasure in meeting him. We meet as water meets water,\nor as two currents of air mix, with perfect diffusion and\ninterpenetration of nature.  But as soon as there is any\ndeparture from simplicity, and attempt at halfness, or good\nfor me that is not good for him, my neighbor feels the wrong;\nhe shrinks from me as far as I have shrunk from him; his\neyes no longer seek mine; there is war between us; there is\nhate in him and fear in me.",
        "All the old abuses in society, universal and particular,\nall unjust accumulations of property and power, are avenged\nin the same manner. Fear is an instructor of great sagacity\nand the herald of all revolutions. One thing he teaches,\nthat there is rottenness where he appears. He is a carrion\ncrow, and though you see not well what he hovers for, there\nis death somewhere. Our property is timid, our laws are\ntimid, our cultivated classes are timid. Fear for ages has\nboded and mowed and gibbered over government and property.\nThat obscene bird is not there for nothing. He indicates\ngreat wrongs which must be revised.",
        "Of the like nature is that expectation of change which\ninstantly follows the suspension of our voluntary activity.\nThe terror of cloudless noon, the emerald of Polycrates,\nthe awe of prosperity, the instinct which leads every\ngenerous soul to impose on itself tasks of a noble\nasceticism and vicarious virtue, are the tremblings of\nthe balance of justice through the heart and mind of man.",
        "Experienced men of the world know very well that it is\nbest to pay scot and lot as they go along, and that a\nman often pays dear for a small frugality. The borrower\nruns in his own debt. Has a man gained any thing who has\nreceived a hundred favors and rendered none? Has he gained\nby borrowing, through indolence or cunning, his neighbor’s\nwares, or horses, or money? There arises on the deed the\ninstant acknowledgment of benefit on the one part and of\ndebt on the other; that is, of superiority and inferiority.\nThe transaction remains in the memory of himself and his\nneighbor; and every new transaction alters according to\nits nature their relation to each other. He may soon come\nto see that he had better have broken his own bones than\nto have ridden in his neighbor’s coach, and that “the\nhighest price he can pay for a thing is to ask for it.”",
        "A wise man will extend this lesson to all parts of life,\nand know that it is the part of prudence to face every\nclaimant and pay every just demand on your time, your\ntalents, or your heart. Always pay; for first or last\nyou must pay your entire debt. Persons and events may\nstand for a time between you and justice, but it is only\na postponement. You must pay at last your own debt. If\nyou are wise you will dread a prosperity which only loads\nyou with more. Benefit is the end of nature. But for every\nbenefit which you receive, a tax is levied. He is great\nwho confers the most benefits. He is base,—and that is\nthe one base thing in the universe,—to receive favors\nand render none. In the order of nature we cannot render\nbenefits to those from whom we receive them, or only seldom.\nBut the benefit we receive must be rendered again, line for\nline, deed for deed, cent for cent, to somebody. Beware of\ntoo much good staying in your hand. It will fast corrupt and\nworm worms. Pay it away quickly in some sort.",
        "Labor is watched over by the same pitiless laws. Cheapest,\nsay the prudent, is the dearest labor. What we buy in a\nbroom, a mat, a wagon, a knife, is some application of\ngood sense to a common want. It is best to pay in your\nland a skilful gardener, or to buy good sense applied to\ngardening; in your sailor, good sense applied to navigation;\nin the house, good sense applied to cooking, sewing, serving;\nin your agent, good sense applied to accounts and affairs.\nSo do you multiply your presence, or spread yourself throughout\nyour estate. But because of the dual constitution of things,\nin labor as in life there can be no cheating. The thief steals\nfrom himself. The swindler swindles himself. For the real price\nof labor is knowledge and virtue, whereof wealth and credit are\nsigns. These signs, like paper money, may be counterfeited or\nstolen, but that which they represent, namely, knowledge and\nvirtue, cannot be counterfeited or stolen. These ends of labor\ncannot be answered but by real exertions of the mind, and in\nobedience to pure motives. The cheat, the defaulter, the\ngambler, cannot extort the knowledge of material and moral\nnature which his honest care and pains yield to the operative.\nThe law of nature is, Do the thing, and you shall have the\nPower; but they who do not the thing have not the power.",
        "Human labor, through all its forms, from the sharpening\nof a stake to the construction of a city or an epic, is\none immense illustration of the perfect compensation of\nthe universe. The absolute balance of Give and Take, the\ndoctrine that every thing has its price,—and if that\nprice is not paid, not that thing but something else is\nobtained, and that it is impossible to get any thing\nwithout its price,—is not less sublime in the columns\nof a leger than in the budgets of states, in the laws of\nlight and darkness, in all the action and reaction of\nnature. I cannot doubt that the high laws which each man\nsees implicated in those processes with which he is\nconversant, the stern ethics which sparkle on his chisel-\nedge, which are measured out by his plumb and foot-rule,\nwhich stand as manifest in the footing of the shop-bill\nas in the history of a state,—do recommend to him his\ntrade, and though seldom named, exalt his business to his\nimagination.",
        "The league between virtue and nature engages all things\nto assume a hostile front to vice. The beautiful laws and\nsubstances of the world persecute and whip the traitor.\nHe finds that things are arranged for truth and benefit,\nbut there is no den in the wide world to hide a rogue.\nCommit a crime, and the earth is made of glass. Commit a\ncrime, and it seems as if a coat of snow fell on the ground,\nsuch as reveals in the woods the track of every partridge\nand fox and squirrel and mole. You cannot recall the spoken\nword, you cannot wipe out the foot-track, you cannot draw\nup the ladder, so as to leave no inlet or clew.  Some\ndamning circumstance always transpires. The laws and\nsubstances of nature,—water, snow, wind, gravitation,—\nbecome penalties to the thief.",
        "On the other hand the law holds with equal sureness for\nall right action. Love, and you shall be loved. All love\nis mathematically just, as much as the two sides of an\nalgebraic equation. The good man has absolute good, which\nlike fire turns every thing to its own nature, so that you\ncannot do him any harm; but as the royal armies sent against\nNapoleon, when he approached cast down their colors and from\nenemies became friends, so disasters of all kinds, as\nsickness, offence, poverty, prove benefactors:—",
        "The good are befriended even by weakness and defect. As no\nman had ever a point of pride that was not injurious to him,\nso no man had ever a defect that was not somewhere made\nuseful to him. The stag in the fable admired his horns and\nblamed his feet, but when the hunter came, his feet saved\nhim, and afterwards, caught in the thicket, his horns\ndestroyed him. Every man in his lifetime needs to thank his\nfaults. As no man thoroughly understands a truth until he\nhas contended against it, so no man has a thorough acquaintance\nwith the hindrances or talents of men until he has suffered\nfrom the one and seen the triumph of the other over his own\nwant of the same. Has he a defect of temper that unfits him\nto live in society? Thereby he is driven to entertain himself\nalone and acquire habits of self-help; and thus, like the\nwounded oyster, he mends his shell with pearl.",
        "Our strength grows out of our weakness. The indignation\nwhich arms itself with secret forces does not awaken\nuntil we are pricked and stung and sorely assailed. A\ngreat man is always willing to be little.  Whilst he sits\non the cushion of advantages, he goes to sleep. When he\nis pushed, tormented, defeated, he has a chance to learn\nsomething; he has been put on his wits, on his manhood;\nhe has gained facts; learns his ignorance; is cured of\nthe insanity of conceit; has got moderation and real\nskill. The wise man throws himself on the side of his\nassailants. It is more his interest than it is theirs\nto find his weak point. The wound cicatrizes and falls\noff from him like a dead skin and when they would triumph,\nlo! he has passed on invulnerable. Blame is safer than\npraise. I hate to be defended in a newspaper. As long as\nall that is said is said against me, I feel a certain\nassurance of success. But as soon as honeyed words of\npraise are spoken for me I feel as one that lies\nunprotected before his enemies. In general, every evil\nto which we do not succumb is a benefactor. As the Sandwich\nIslander believes that the strength and valor of the enemy\nhe kills passes into himself, so we gain the strength of the\ntemptation we resist.",
        "The same guards which protect us from disaster, defect,\nand enmity, defend us, if we will, from selfishness and\nfraud. Bolts and bars are not the best of our institutions,\nnor is shrewdness in trade a mark of wisdom. Men suffer\nall their life long under the foolish superstition that\nthey can be cheated. But it is as impossible for a man\nto be cheated by any one but himself, as for a thing to\nbe and not to be at the same time. There is a third silent\nparty to all our bargains. The nature and soul of things\ntakes on itself the guaranty of the fulfilment of every\ncontract, so that honest service cannot come to loss. If\nyou serve an ungrateful master, serve him the more. Put\nGod in your debt. Every stroke shall be repaid. The longer\nThe payment is withholden, the better for you; for compound\ninterest on compound interest is the rate and usage of this\nexchequer.",
        "The history of persecution is a history of endeavors to\ncheat nature, to make water run up hill, to twist a rope\nof sand. It makes no difference whether the actors be many\nor one, a tyrant or a mob. A mob is a society of bodies\nvoluntarily bereaving themselves of reason and traversing\nits work. The mob is man voluntarily descending to the\nnature of the beast. Its fit hour of activity is night.\nIts actions are insane like its whole constitution. It\npersecutes a principle; it would whip a right; it would\ntar and feather justice, by inflicting fire and outrage\nupon the houses and persons of those who have these. It\nresembles the prank of boys, who run with fire-engines to\nput out the ruddy aurora streaming to the stars. The\ninviolate spirit turns their spite against the wrongdoers.\nThe martyr cannot be dishonored. Every lash inflicted is a\ntongue of fame; every prison, a more illustrious abode;\nevery burned book or house enlightens the world; every\nsuppressed or expunged word reverberates through the earth\nfrom side to side. Hours of sanity and consideration are\nalways arriving to communities, as to individuals, when the\ntruth is seen and the martyrs are justified.",
        "Thus do all things preach the indifferency of circumstances.\nThe man is all. Every thing has two sides, a good and an\nevil. Every advantage has its tax. I learn to be content.\nBut the doctrine of compensation is not the doctrine of\nindifferency. The thoughtless say, on hearing these\nrepresentations,—What boots it to do well? there is one\nevent to good and evil; if I gain any good I must pay for\nit; if I lose any good I gain some other; all actions are\nindifferent.",
        "There is a deeper fact in the soul than compensation, to\nwit, its own nature. The soul is not a compensation, but\na life. The soul is. Under all this running sea of\ncircumstance, whose waters ebb and flow with perfect\nbalance, lies the aboriginal abyss of real Being. Essence,\nor God, is not a relation or a part, but the whole. Being\nis the vast affirmative, excluding negation, self-balanced,\nand swallowing up all relations, parts and times within\nitself. Nature, truth, virtue, are the influx from thence.\nVice is the absence or departure of the same. Nothing,\nFalsehood, may indeed stand as the great Night or shade on\nwhich as a background the living universe paints itself\nforth, but no fact is begotten by it; it cannot work, for\nit is not. It cannot work any good; it cannot work any harm.\nIt is harm inasmuch as it is worse not to be than to be.",
        "We feel defrauded of the retribution due to evil acts,\nbecause the criminal adheres to his vice and contumacy\nand does not come to a crisis or judgment anywhere in\nvisible nature. There is no stunning confutation of his\nnonsense before men and angels. Has he therefore outwitted\nthe law? Inasmuch as he carries the malignity and the lie\nwith him he so far deceases from nature. In some manner\nthere will be a demonstration of the wrong to the\nunderstanding also; but, should we not see it, this deadly\ndeduction makes square the eternal account.",
        "Neither can it be said, on the other hand, that the gain\nof rectitude must be bought by any loss. There is no\npenalty to virtue; no penalty to wisdom; they are proper\nadditions of being. In a virtuous action I properly am;\nin a virtuous act I add to the world; I plant into deserts\nconquered from Chaos and Nothing and see the darkness\nreceding on the limits of the horizon. There can be no\nexcess to love, none to knowledge, none to beauty, when\nthese attributes are considered in the purest sense. The\nsoul refuses limits, and always affirms an Optimism, never\na Pessimism.",
        "His life is a progress, and not a station. His instinct is\ntrust. Our instinct uses “more” and “less” in application\nto man, of the presence of the soul, and not of its absence,\nthe brave man is greater than the coward; the true, the\nbenevolent, the wise, is more a man and not less, than the\nfool and knave.  There is no tax on the good of virtue, for\nthat is the incoming of God himself, or absolute existence,\nwithout any comparative. Material good has its tax, and if\nit came without desert or sweat, has no root in me, and the\nnext wind will blow it away. But all the good of nature is\nthe soul’s, and may be had if paid for in nature’s lawful\ncoin, that is, by labor which the heart and the head allow.\nI no longer wish to meet a good I do not earn, for example\nto find a pot of buried gold, knowing that it brings with it\nnew burdens. I do not wish more external goods,—neither\npossessions, nor honors, nor powers, nor persons. The gain\nis apparent; the tax is certain. But there is no tax on the\nknowledge that the compensation exists and that it is not\ndesirable to dig up treasure. Herein I rejoice with a serene\neternal peace. I contract the boundaries of possible mischief.\nI learn the wisdom of St. Bernard,—\"Nothing can work me\ndamage except myself; the harm that I sustain I carry about\nwith me, and never am a real sufferer but by my own fault.”",
        "In the nature of the soul is the compensation for the\ninequalities of condition. The radical tragedy of nature\nseems to be the distinction of More and Less. How can\nLess not feel the pain; how not feel indignation or\nmalevolence towards More? Look at those who have less\nfaculty, and one feels sad and knows not well what to\nmake of it. He almost shuns their eye; he fears they will\nupbraid God. What should they do? It seems a great injustice.\nBut see the facts nearly and these mountainous inequalities\nvanish. Love reduces them as the sun melts the iceberg in\nthe sea. The heart and soul of all men being one, this\nbitterness of His and Mine ceases. His is mine. I am my\nbrother and my brother is me. If I feel overshadowed and\noutdone by great neighbors, I can yet love; I can still\nreceive; and he that loveth maketh his own the grandeur\nhe loves. Thereby I make the discovery that my brother is\nmy guardian, acting for me with the friendliest designs,\nand the estate I so admired and envied is my own. It is\nthe nature of the soul to appropriate all things. Jesus\nand Shakspeare are fragments of the soul, and by love I\nconquer and incorporate them in my own conscious domain.\nHis virtue,—is not that mine? His wit,—if it cannot be\nmade mine, it is not wit.",
        "Such also is the natural history of calamity. The changes\nwhich break up at short intervals the prosperity of men\nare advertisements of a nature whose law is growth. Every\nsoul is by this intrinsic necessity quitting its whole\nsystem of things, its friends and home and laws and faith,\nas the shell-fish crawls out of its beautiful but stony\ncase, because it no longer admits of its growth, and slowly\nforms a new house. In proportion to the vigor of the\nindividual these revolutions are frequent, until in some\nhappier mind they are incessant and all worldly relations\nhang very loosely about him, becoming as it were a\ntransparent fluid membrane through which the living form\nis seen, and not, as in most men, an indurated heterogeneous\nfabric of many dates and of no settled character, in which\nthe man is imprisoned. Then there can be enlargement, and\nthe man of to-day scarcely recognizes the man of yesterday.\nAnd such should be the outward biography of man in time, a\nputting off of dead circumstances day by day, as he renews\nhis raiment day by day. But to us, in our lapsed estate,\nresting, not advancing, resisting, not cooperating with the\ndivine expansion, this growth comes by shocks.",
        "We cannot part with our friends. We cannot let our angels\ngo. We do not see that they only go out that archangels\nmay come in. We are idolaters of the old. We do not believe\nin the riches of the soul, in its proper eternity and\nomnipresence. We do not believe there is any force in\nto-day to rival or recreate that beautiful yesterday. We\nlinger in the ruins of the old tent where once we had bread\nand shelter and organs, nor believe that the spirit can\nfeed, cover, and nerve us again. We cannot again find aught\nso dear, so sweet, so graceful. But we sit and weep in vain.\nThe voice of the Almighty saith, ’Up and onward for evermore!’\nWe cannot stay amid the ruins. Neither will we rely on the\nnew; and so we walk ever with reverted eyes, like those\nmonsters who look backwards.",
        "And yet the compensations of calamity are made apparent\nto the understanding also, after long intervals of time.\nA fever, a mutilation, a cruel disappointment, a loss of\nwealth, a loss of friends, seems at the moment unpaid\nloss, and unpayable. But the sure years reveal the deep\nremedial force that underlies all facts. The death of a\ndear friend, wife, brother, lover, which seemed nothing\nbut privation, somewhat later assumes the aspect of a\nguide or genius; for it commonly operates revolutions in\nour way of life, terminates an epoch of infancy or of\nyouth which was waiting to be closed, breaks up a wonted\noccupation, or a household, or style of living, and allows\nthe formation of new ones more friendly to the growth of\ncharacter. It permits or constrains the formation of new\nacquaintances and the reception of new influences that\nprove of the first importance to the next years; and the\nman or woman who would have remained a sunny garden-flower,\nwith no room for its roots and too much sunshine for its\nhead, by the falling of the walls and the neglect of the\ngardener is made the banian of the forest, yielding shade\nand fruit to wide neighborhoods of men.",
