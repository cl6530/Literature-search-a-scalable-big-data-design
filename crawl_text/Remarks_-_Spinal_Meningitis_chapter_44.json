        "So many people have shown a pardonable curiosity about the above named\ndisease, and so few have a very clear idea of the thrill of pleasure it\naffords the patient, unless they have enjoyed it themselves, that I have\ndecided to briefly say something in answer to the innumerable inquiries I\nhave received.",
        "Up to the moment I had a notion of getting some meningitis, I had never\nemployed a physician. Since then I have been thrown in their society a\ngreat deal. Most of them were very pleasant and scholarly gentlemen, who\nwill not soon be forgotten; but one of them doctored me first for\npneumonia, then for inflammatory rheumatism, and finally, when death was\ncontiguous, advised me that I must have change of scene and rest.",
        "I told him that if he kept on prescribing for me, I thought I might depend\non both. Change of physicians, however, saved my life. This horse doctor,\na few weeks afterward, administered a subcutaneous morphine squirt in the\narm of a healthy servant girl because she had the headache, and she is now\nwith the rest of this veterinarian’s patients in a land that is fairer\nthan this.",
        "She lived six hours after she was prescribed for. He gave her change of\nscene and rest. He has quite a thriving little cemetery filled with people\nwho have succeeded in cording up enough of his change of scene and rest to\nlast them through all eternity. He was called once to prescribe for a man\nwhose head had been caved in by a stone match-box, and, after treating the\nman for asthma and blind staggers, he prescribed rest and change of scene\nfor him, too. The poor asthmatic is now breathing the extremely rarified\nair of the New Jerusalem.",
        "Meningitis is derived from the Latin Meninges, membrane, and–itis, an\naffix denoting inflammation, so that, strictly speaking, meningitis is the\ninflammation of a membrane, and when applied to the spine, or cerebrum, is\ncalled spinal meningitis, or cerebro-spinal meningitis, etc., according to\nthe part of the spine or brain involved in the inflammation. Meningitis is\na characteristic and result of so-called spotted fever, and by many it is\ndeemed identical with it.",
        "When we come to consider that the spinal cord, or marrow, runs down\nthrough the long, bony shaft made by the vertebrae, and that the brain and\nspine, though connected, are bound up in one continuous bony wall and\ncovered with this inflamed membrane, it is not difficult to understand\nthat the thing is very hard to get at. If your throat gets inflamed, a\ndoctor asks you to run your tongue out into society about a yard and a\nhalf, and he pries your mouth open with one of Rogers Brothers’ spoon\nhandles. Then he is able to examine your throat as he would a page of the\nCongressional Record, and to treat it with some local application. When\nyou have spinal meningitis, however, the doctor tackles you with bromides,\nergots, ammonia, iodine, chloral hydrate, codi, bromide of ammonia,\nhasheesh, bismuth, valerianate of ammonia, morphine sulph., nux vomica,\nturpentine emulsion, vox humana, rex magnus, opium, cantharides, Dover’s\npowders, and other bric-a-brac. These remedies are masticated and acted\nupon by the salivary glands, passed down the esophagus, thrown into the\nsociety of old gastric, submitted to the peculiar motion of the stomach\nand thoroughly chymified, then forwarded through the pyloric orifice into\nthe smaller intestines, where they are touched up with bile, and later on\nhanded over through the lacteals, thoracic duct, etc., to the vast\ncirculatory system. Here it is yanked back and forth through the heart,\nlungs and capillaries, and if anything is left to fork over to the\ndisease, it has to squeeze into the long, bony, air-tight socket that\nholds the spinal cord. All this is done without seeing the patient’s\nspinal cord before or after taking. If it could be taken out, and hung\nover a clothes line and cleansed with benzine, and then treated with\ninsect powder, or rolled in corn meal, or preserved in alcohol, and then\nput back, it would be all right; but you can’t. You pull a man’s spine out\nof his system and he is bound to miss it, no matter how careful you have\nbeen about it. It is difficult to keep house without the spine. You need\nit every time you cook a meal. If the spinal cord could be pulled by a\ndentist and put away in pounded ice every time it gets a hot-box, spinal\nmeningitis would lose its stinger.",
        "I was treated by thirteen physicians, whose names I may give in a future\narticle. They were, as I said, men I shall long remember. One of them said\nvery sensibly that meningitis was generally over-doctored. I told him that\nI agreed with him. I said that if I should have another year of meningitis\nand thirteen more doctors, I would have to postpone my trip to Europe,\nwhere I had hoped to go and cultivate my voice. I’ve got a perfectly\nlovely voice, if I would take it to Europe and have it sand-papered and\nvarnished, and mellowed down with beer and bologna.",
        "But I was speaking of my physicians. Some time I’m going to give their\nbiographies and portraits, as they did those of Dr. Bliss, Dr. Barnes and\nothers. Next year, if I can get railroad rates, I am going to hold a\nreunion of my physicians in Chicago. It will be a pleasant relaxation for\nthem, and will save the lives of a large percentage of their patients.",
