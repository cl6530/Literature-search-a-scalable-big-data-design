        "It was hinted at the close of the last chapter that Dick was\ndestined to be disagreeably surprised on reaching home.",
        "Having agreed to give further assistance to Tom Wilkins, he was\nnaturally led to go to the drawer where he and Fosdick kept their\nbank-books. To his surprise and uneasiness the drawer proved to be\nempty!\n“Come here a minute, Fosdick,” he said.",
        "“What’s the matter, Dick?”",
        "“I can’t find my bank-book, nor yours either. What’s ’come of them?”",
        "“I took mine with me this morning, thinking I might want to put in a\nlittle more money. I’ve got it in my pocket, now.”",
        "“But where’s mine?” asked Dick, perplexed.",
        "“I don’t know. I saw it in the drawer when I took mine this morning.”",
        "“Are you sure?”",
        "“Yes, positive, for I looked into it to see how much you had got.”",
        "“Did you lock it again?” asked Dick.",
        "“Yes; didn’t you have to unlock it just now?”",
        "“So I did,” said Dick. “But it’s gone now. Somebody opened it with a\nkey that fitted the lock, and then locked it ag’in.”",
        "“That must have been the way.”",
        "“It’s rather hard on a feller,” said Dick, who, for the first time\nsince we became acquainted with him, began to feel down-hearted.",
        "“Don’t give it up, Dick. You haven’t lost the money, only the\nbank-book.”",
        "“Aint that the same thing?”",
        "“No. You can go to the bank to-morrow morning, as soon as it opens,\nand tell them you have lost the book, and ask them not to pay the\nmoney to any one except yourself.”",
        "“So I can,” said Dick, brightening up. “That is, if the thief hasn’t\nbeen to the bank to-day.”",
        "“If he has, they might detect him by his handwriting.”",
        "“I’d like to get hold of the one that stole it,” said Dick,\nindignantly. “I’d give him a good lickin’.”",
        "“It must have been somebody in the house. Suppose we go and see Mrs.\nMooney. She may know whether anybody came into our room to-day.”",
        "The two boys went downstairs, and knocked at the door of a little\nback sitting-room where Mrs. Mooney generally spent her evenings. It\nwas a shabby little room, with a threadbare carpet on the floor, the\nwalls covered with a certain large-figured paper, patches of which\nhad been stripped off here and there, exposing the plaster, the\nremainder being defaced by dirt and grease. But Mrs. Mooney had one\nof those comfortable temperaments which are tolerant of dirt, and\ndidn’t mind it in the least. She was seated beside a small pine\nwork-table, industriously engaged in mending stockings.",
        "“Good-evening, Mrs. Mooney,” said Fosdick, politely.",
        "“Good-evening,” said the landlady. “Sit down, if you can find\nchairs. I’m hard at work as you see, but a poor lone widder can’t\nafford to be idle.”",
        "“We can’t stop long, Mrs. Mooney, but my friend here has had\nsomething taken from his room to-day, and we thought we’d come and\nsee you about it.”",
        "“What is it?” asked the landlady. “You don’t think I’d take\nanything? If I am poor, it’s an honest name I’ve always had, as all\nmy lodgers can testify.”",
        "“Certainly not, Mrs. Mooney; but there are others in the house that\nmay not be honest. My friend has lost his bank-book. It was safe in\nthe drawer this morning, but to-night it is not to be found.”",
        "“How much money was there in it?” asked Mrs. Mooney.",
        "“Over a hundred dollars,” said Fosdick.",
        "“It was my whole fortun’,” said Dick. “I was goin’ to buy a house\nnext year.”",
        "Mrs. Mooney was evidently surprised to learn the extent of Dick’s\nwealth, and was disposed to regard him with increased respect.",
        "“Was the drawer locked?” she asked.",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“Then it couldn’t have been Bridget. I don’t think she has any\nkeys.”",
        "“She wouldn’t know what a bank-book was,” said Fosdick. “You didn’t\nsee any of the lodgers go into our room to-day, did you?”",
        "“I shouldn’t wonder if it was Jim Travis,” said Mrs. Mooney, suddenly.",
        "This James Travis was a bar-tender in a low groggery in Mulberry\nStreet, and had been for a few weeks an inmate of Mrs. Mooney’s\nlodging-house. He was a coarse-looking fellow who, from his\nappearance, evidently patronized liberally the liquor he dealt out\nto others. He occupied a room opposite Dick’s, and was often heard\nby the two boys reeling upstairs in a state of intoxication,\nuttering shocking oaths.",
        "This Travis had made several friendly overtures to Dick and his\nroom-mate, and had invited them to call round at the bar-room where\nhe tended, and take something. But this invitation had never been\naccepted, partly because the boys were better engaged in the\nevening, and partly because neither of them had taken a fancy to Mr.\nTravis; which certainly was not strange, for nature had not gifted\nhim with many charms, either of personal appearance or manners. The\nrejection of his friendly proffers had caused him to take a dislike\nto Dick and Henry, whom he considered stiff and unsocial.",
        "“What makes you think it was Travis?” asked Fosdick. “He isn’t at\nhome in the daytime.”",
        "“But he was to-day. He said he had got a bad cold, and had to come\nhome for a clean handkerchief.”",
        "“Did you see him?” asked Dick.",
        "“Yes,” said Mrs. Mooney. “Bridget was hanging out clothes, and I\nwent to the door to let him in.”",
        "“I wonder if he had a key that would fit our drawer,” said Fosdick.",
        "“Yes,” said Mrs. Mooney. “The bureaus in the two rooms are just\nalike. I got ’em at auction, and most likely the locks is the same.”",
        "“It must have been he,” said Dick, looking towards Fosdick.",
        "“Yes,” said Fosdick, “it looks like it.”",
        "“What’s to be done? That’s what I’d like to know,” said Dick. “Of\ncourse he’ll say he hasn’t got it; and he won’t be such a fool as to\nleave it in his room.”",
        "“If he hasn’t been to the bank, it’s all right,” said Fosdick. “You\ncan go there the first thing to-morrow morning, and stop their\npaying any money on it.”",
        "“But I can’t get any money on it myself,” said Dick. “I told Tom\nWilkins I’d let him have some more money to-morrow, or his sick\nmother’ll have to turn out of their lodgin’s.”",
        "“How much money were you going to give him?”",
        "“I gave him three dollars to-day, and was goin’ to give him two\ndollars to-morrow.”",
        "“I’ve got the money, Dick. I didn’t go to the bank this morning.”",
        "“All right. I’ll take it, and pay you back next week.”",
        "“No, Dick; if you’ve given three dollars, you must let me give two.”",
        "“No, Fosdick, I’d rather give the whole. You know I’ve got more\nmoney than you. No, I haven’t, either,” said Dick, the memory of his\nloss flashing upon him. “I thought I was rich this morning, but now\nI’m in destitoot circumstances.”",
        "“Cheer up, Dick; you’ll get your money back.”",
        "“I hope so,” said our hero, rather ruefully.",
        "The fact was, that our friend Dick was beginning to feel what is\nso often experienced by men who do business of a more important\ncharacter and on a larger scale than he, the bitterness of a reverse\nof circumstances. With one hundred dollars and over carefully laid\naway in the savings bank, he had felt quite independent. Wealth is\ncomparative, and Dick probably felt as rich as many men who are\nworth a hundred thousand dollars. He was beginning to feel the\nadvantages of his steady self-denial, and to experience the\npleasures of property. Not that Dick was likely to be unduly\nattached to money. Let it be said to his credit that it had never\ngiven him so much satisfaction as when it enabled him to help Tom\nWilkins in his trouble.",
        "Besides this, there was another thought that troubled him. When he\nobtained a place he could not expect to receive as much as he was\nnow making from blacking boots,–probably not more than three\ndollars a week,–while his expenses without clothing would amount to\nfour dollars. To make up the deficiency he had confidently relied\nupon his savings, which would be sufficient to carry him along for a\nyear, if necessary. If he should not recover his money, he would be\ncompelled to continue a boot-black for at least six months longer;\nand this was rather a discouraging reflection. On the whole it is\nnot to be wondered at that Dick felt unusually sober this evening,\nand that neither of the boys felt much like studying.",
        "The two boys consulted as to whether it would be best to speak to\nTravis about it. It was not altogether easy to decide. Fosdick was\nopposed to it.",
        "“It will only put him on his guard,” said he, “and I don’t see as it\nwill do any good. Of course he will deny it. We’d better keep quiet,\nand watch him, and, by giving notice at the bank, we can make sure\nthat he doesn’t get any money on it. If he does present himself at\nthe bank, they will know at once that he is a thief, and he can be\narrested.”",
        "This view seemed reasonable, and Dick resolved to adopt it. On the\nwhole, he began to think prospects were brighter than he had at\nfirst supposed, and his spirits rose a little.",
        "“How’d he know I had any bank-book? That’s what I can’t make out,\"\nhe said.",
        "“Don’t you remember?” said Fosdick, after a moment’s thought, “we\nwere speaking of our savings, two or three evenings since?”",
        "“Yes,” said Dick.",
        "“Our door was a little open at the time, and I heard somebody come\nupstairs, and stop a minute in front of it. It must have been Jim\nTravis. In that way he probably found out about your money, and took\nthe opportunity to-day to get hold of it.”",
        "This might or might not be the correct explanation. At all events it\nseemed probable.",
        "The boys were just on the point of going to bed, later in the\nevening, when a knock was heard at the door, and, to their no little\nsurprise, their neighbor, Jim Travis, proved to be the caller. He\nwas a sallow-complexioned young man, with dark hair and bloodshot\neyes.",
        "He darted a quick glance from one to the other as he entered, which\ndid not escape the boys’ notice.",
        "“How are ye, to-night?” he said, sinking into one of the two chairs\nwith which the room was scantily furnished.",
        "“Jolly,” said Dick. “How are you?”",
        "“Tired as a dog,” was the reply. “Hard work and poor pay; that’s the\nway with me. I wanted to go to the theater, to-night, but I was hard\nup, and couldn’t raise the cash.”",
        "Here he darted another quick glance at the boys; but neither\nbetrayed anything.",
        "“You don’t go out much, do you?” he said",
        "“Not much,” said Fosdick. “We spend our evenings in study.”",
        "“That’s precious slow,” said Travis, rather contemptuously. “What’s\nthe use of studying so much? You don’t expect to be a lawyer, do\nyou, or anything of that sort?”",
        "“Maybe,” said Dick. “I haven’t made up my mind yet. If my\nfeller-citizens should want me to go to Congress some time, I\nshouldn’t want to disapp’int ’em; and then readin’ and writin’\nmight come handy.”",
        "“Well,” said Travis, rather abruptly, “I’m tired and I guess\nI’ll turn in.”",
        "“Good-night,” said Fosdick.",
        "The boys looked at each other as their visitor left the room.",
        "“He came in to see if we’d missed the bank-book,” said Dick.",
        "“And to turn off suspicion from himself, by letting us know he had\nno money,” added Fosdick.",
        "“That’s so,” said Dick. “I’d like to have searched them pockets\nof his.”",
