        "It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place\nany one could imagine.  The high walls which shut it\nin were covered with the leafless stems of climbing roses\nwhich were so thick that they were matted together.\nMary Lennox knew they were roses because she had seen\na great many roses in India.  All the ground was covered\nwith grass of a wintry brown and out of it grew clumps\nof bushes which were surely rosebushes if they were alive.\nThere were numbers of standard roses which had so spread\ntheir branches that they were like little trees.\nThere were other trees in the garden, and one of the\nthings which made the place look strangest and loveliest\nwas that climbing roses had run all over them and swung\ndown long tendrils which made light swaying curtains,\nand here and there they had caught at each other or\nat a far-reaching branch and had crept from one tree\nto another and made lovely bridges of themselves.\nThere were neither leaves nor roses on them now and Mary\ndid not know whether they were dead or alive, but their\nthin gray or brown branches and sprays looked like a sort\nof hazy mantle spreading over everything, walls, and trees,\nand even brown grass, where they had fallen from their\nfastenings and run along the ground.  It was this hazy tangle\nfrom tree to tree which made it all look so mysterious.\nMary had thought it must be different from other gardens\nwhich had not been left all by themselves so long;\nand indeed it was different from any other place she had\never seen in her life.",
        "“How still it is!” she whispered.  “How still!”",
        "Then she waited a moment and listened at the stillness.\nThe robin, who had flown to his treetop, was still\nas all the rest.  He did not even flutter his wings;\nhe sat without stirring, and looked at Mary.",
        "“No wonder it is still,” she whispered again.  “I am\nthe first person who has spoken in here for ten years.”",
        "She moved away from the door, stepping as softly as if she\nwere afraid of awakening some one.  She was glad that there\nwas grass under her feet and that her steps made no sounds.\nShe walked under one of the fairy-like gray arches\nbetween the trees and looked up at the sprays and tendrils\nwhich formed them.  “I wonder if they are all quite dead,\"\nshe said.  “Is it all a quite dead garden? I wish it wasn’t.”",
        "If she had been Ben Weatherstaff she could have told\nwhether the wood was alive by looking at it, but she\ncould only see that there were only gray or brown sprays\nand branches and none showed any signs of even a tiny\nleaf-bud anywhere.",
        "But she was inside the wonderful garden and she could\ncome through the door under the ivy any time and she\nfelt as if she had found a world all her own.",
        "The sun was shining inside the four walls and the high arch\nof blue sky over this particular piece of Misselthwaite\nseemed even more brilliant and soft than it was over\nthe moor.  The robin flew down from his tree-top and\nhopped about or flew after her from one bush to another.\nHe chirped a good deal and had a very busy air, as if he\nwere showing her things.  Everything was strange and\nsilent and she seemed to be hundreds of miles away from\nany one, but somehow she did not feel lonely at all.\nAll that troubled her was her wish that she knew whether\nall the roses were dead, or if perhaps some of them had\nlived and might put out leaves and buds as the weather\ngot warmer.  She did not want it to be a quite dead garden.\nIf it were a quite alive garden, how wonderful it would be,\nand what thousands of roses would grow on every side!",
        "Her skipping-rope had hung over her arm when she came\nin and after she had walked about for a while she thought\nshe would skip round the whole garden, stopping when she\nwanted to look at things.  There seemed to have been\ngrass paths here and there, and in one or two corners\nthere were alcoves of evergreen with stone seats or tall\nmoss-covered flower urns in them.",
        "As she came near the second of these alcoves she\nstopped skipping.  There had once been a flowerbed in it,\nand she thought she saw something sticking out of the\nblack earth–some sharp little pale green points.\nShe remembered what Ben Weatherstaff had said and she\nknelt down to look at them.",
        "“Yes, they are tiny growing things and they might be\ncrocuses or snowdrops or daffodils,” she whispered.",
        "She bent very close to them and sniffed the fresh scent\nof the damp earth.  She liked it very much.",
        "“Perhaps there are some other ones coming up in other places,\"\nshe said.  “I will go all over the garden and look.”",
        "She did not skip, but walked.  She went slowly and kept\nher eyes on the ground.  She looked in the old border\nbeds and among the grass, and after she had gone round,\ntrying to miss nothing, she had found ever so many more sharp,\npale green points, and she had become quite excited again.",
        "“It isn’t a quite dead garden,” she cried out softly to herself.\n“Even if the roses are dead, there are other things alive.”",
        "She did not know anything about gardening, but the grass\nseemed so thick in some of the places where the green\npoints were pushing their way through that she thought\nthey did not seem to have room enough to grow.\nShe searched about until she found a rather sharp piece\nof wood and knelt down and dug and weeded out the weeds\nand grass until she made nice little clear places around them.",
        "“Now they look as if they could breathe,” she said,\nafter she had finished with the first ones.  “I am\ngoing to do ever so many more.  I’ll do all I can see.\nIf I haven’t time today I can come tomorrow.”",
        "She went from place to place, and dug and weeded,\nand enjoyed herself so immensely that she was led on\nfrom bed to bed and into the grass under the trees.\nThe exercise made her so warm that she first threw her\ncoat off, and then her hat, and without knowing it she\nwas smiling down on to the grass and the pale green points\nall the time.",
        "The robin was tremendously busy.  He was very much\npleased to see gardening begun on his own estate.\nHe had often wondered at Ben Weatherstaff.  Where gardening\nis done all sorts of delightful things to eat are turned\nup with the soil.  Now here was this new kind of creature\nwho was not half Ben’s size and yet had had the sense\nto come into his garden and begin at once.",
        "Mistress Mary worked in her garden until it was time\nto go to her midday dinner.  In fact, she was rather\nlate in remembering, and when she put on her coat\nand hat, and picked up her skipping-rope, she could not\nbelieve that she had been working two or three hours.\nShe had been actually happy all the time; and dozens\nand dozens of the tiny, pale green points were to be seen\nin cleared places, looking twice as cheerful as they had\nlooked before when the grass and weeds had been smothering them.",
        "“I shall come back this afternoon,” she said, looking all\nround at her new kingdom, and speaking to the trees\nand the rose-bushes as if they heard her.",
        "Then she ran lightly across the grass, pushed open\nthe slow old door and slipped through it under the ivy.\nShe had such red cheeks and such bright eyes and ate such\na dinner that Martha was delighted.",
        "“Two pieces o’ meat an’ two helps o’ rice puddin’!” she said.\n“Eh! mother will be pleased when I tell her what th’\nskippin’-rope’s done for thee.”",
        "In the course of her digging with her pointed stick\nMistress Mary had found herself digging up a sort of white\nroot rather like an onion.  She had put it back in its\nplace and patted the earth carefully down on it and just\nnow she wondered if Martha could tell her what it was.",
        "“Martha,” she said, “what are those white roots that look\nlike onions?”",
        "“They’re bulbs,” answered Martha.  “Lots o’ spring flowers\ngrow from ’em. Th’ very little ones are snowdrops an’\ncrocuses an’ th’ big ones are narcissuses an’ jonquils\nand daffydowndillys.  Th’ biggest of all is lilies an’\npurple flags.  Eh! they are nice.  Dickon’s got a whole\nlot of ’em planted in our bit o’ garden.”",
        "“Does Dickon know all about them?” asked Mary, a new idea\ntaking possession of her.",
        "“Our Dickon can make a flower grow out of a brick walk.\nMother says he just whispers things out o’ th’ ground.”",
        "“Do bulbs live a long time? Would they live years and\nyears if no one helped them?” inquired Mary anxiously.",
        "“They’re things as helps themselves,” said Martha.  “That’s why\npoor folk can afford to have ’em. If you don’t trouble ’em,\nmost of ’em’ll work away underground for a lifetime an’\nspread out an’ have little ’uns. There’s a place in th’\npark woods here where there’s snowdrops by thousands.\nThey’re the prettiest sight in Yorkshire when th’\nspring comes.  No one knows when they was first planted.”",
        "“I wish the spring was here now,” said Mary.  “I want\nto see all the things that grow in England.”",
        "She had finished her dinner and gone to her favorite seat\non the hearth-rug.",
        "“I wish–I wish I had a little spade,” she said.\n“Whatever does tha’ want a spade for?” asked Martha, laughing.\n“Art tha’ goin’ to take to diggin’? I must tell mother that,\ntoo.”",
        "Mary looked at the fire and pondered a little.  She must\nbe careful if she meant to keep her secret kingdom.\nShe wasn’t doing any harm, but if Mr. Craven found out\nabout the open door he would be fearfully angry and get\na new key and lock it up forevermore.  She really could\nnot bear that.",
        "“This is such a big lonely place,” she said slowly, as if she\nwere turning matters over in her mind.  “The house is lonely,\nand the park is lonely, and the gardens are lonely.\nSo many places seem shut up.  I never did many things\nin India, but there were more people to look at–natives\nand soldiers marching by–and sometimes bands playing,\nand my Ayah told me stories.  There is no one to talk to\nhere except you and Ben Weatherstaff.  And you have to do\nyour work and Ben Weatherstaff won’t speak to me often.\nI thought if I had a little spade I could dig somewhere\nas he does, and I might make a little garden if he would\ngive me some seeds.”",
        "Martha’s face quite lighted up.",
        "“There now!” she exclaimed, “if that wasn’t one of th’\nthings mother said.  She says, `There’s such a lot o’\nroom in that big place, why don’t they give her a\nbit for herself, even if she doesn’t plant nothin’\nbut parsley an’ radishes? She’d dig an’ rake away an’\nbe right down happy over it.’ Them was the very words\nshe said.”",
        "“Were they?” said Mary.  “How many things she knows,\ndoesn’t she?”",
        "“Eh!” said Martha.  “It’s like she says: `A woman as\nbrings up twelve children learns something besides her A\nB C. Children’s as good as ’rithmetic to set you findin’\nout things.’”",
        "“How much would a spade cost–a little one?” Mary asked.",
        "“Well,” was Martha’s reflective answer, “at Thwaite\nvillage there’s a shop or so an’ I saw little garden sets\nwith a spade an’ a rake an’ a fork all tied together for\ntwo shillings.  An’ they was stout enough to work with, too.”",
        "“I’ve got more than that in my purse,” said Mary.\n“Mrs. Morrison gave me five shillings and Mrs. Medlock\ngave me some money from Mr. Craven.”",
        "“Did he remember thee that much?” exclaimed Martha.",
        "“Mrs. Medlock said I was to have a shilling a week to spend.\nShe gives me one every Saturday.  I didn’t know what to\nspend it on.”",
        "“My word! that’s riches,” said Martha.  “Tha’ can buy\nanything in th’ world tha’ wants.  Th’ rent of our\ncottage is only one an’ threepence an’ it’s like pullin’\neye-teeth to get it.  Now I’ve just thought of somethin’,\"\nputting her hands on her hips.",
        "“What?” said Mary eagerly.",
        "“In the shop at Thwaite they sell packages o’\nflower-seeds for a penny each, and our Dickon he knows\nwhich is th’ prettiest ones an, how to make ’em grow.\nHe walks over to Thwaite many a day just for th’ fun of it.\nDoes tha’ know how to print letters?” suddenly.",
        "“I know how to write,” Mary answered.",
        "Martha shook her head.",
        "“Our Dickon can only read printin’. If tha’ could print we\ncould write a letter to him an’ ask him to go an’ buy th’\ngarden tools an’ th’ seeds at th’ same time.”",
        "“Oh! you’re a good girl!” Mary cried.  “You are, really! I\ndidn’t know you were so nice.  I know I can print letters\nif I try.  Let’s ask Mrs. Medlock for a pen and ink and some\npaper.”",
        "“I’ve got some of my own,” said Martha.  “I bought ’em\nso I could print a bit of a letter to mother of a Sunday.\nI’ll go and get it.” She ran out of the room, and Mary stood\nby the fire and twisted her thin little hands together\nwith sheer pleasure.",
        "“If I have a spade,” she whispered, “I can make the earth\nnice and soft and dig up weeds.  If I have seeds and can\nmake flowers grow the garden won’t be dead at all–it\nwill come alive.”",
        "She did not go out again that afternoon because when Martha\nreturned with her pen and ink and paper she was obliged\nto clear the table and carry the plates and dishes\ndownstairs and when she got into the kitchen Mrs. Medlock\nwas there and told her to do something, so Mary waited\nfor what seemed to her a long time before she came back.\nThen it was a serious piece of work to write to Dickon.\nMary had been taught very little because her governesses\nhad disliked her too much to stay with her.  She could\nnot spell particularly well but she found that she could\nprint letters when she tried.  This was the letter Martha\ndictated to her: “My Dear Dickon:",
        "This comes hoping to find you well as it leaves me at present.\nMiss Mary has plenty of money and will you go to Thwaite\nand buy her some flower seeds and a set of garden tools\nto make a flower-bed. Pick the prettiest ones and easy\nto grow because she has never done it before and lived\nin India which is different.  Give my love to mother\nand every one of you.  Miss Mary is going to tell me a lot\nmore so that on my next day out you can hear about elephants\nand camels and gentlemen going hunting lions and tigers.",
        "                     “Your loving sister,\n                     Martha Phoebe Sowerby.”",
        "“We’ll put the money in th’ envelope an’ I’ll get th’\nbutcher boy to take it in his cart.  He’s a great\nfriend o’ Dickon’s,” said Martha.",
        "“How shall I get the things when Dickon buys them?”",
        "“He’ll bring ’em to you himself.  He’ll like to walk\nover this way.”",
        "“Oh!” exclaimed Mary, “then I shall see him! I never\nthought I should see Dickon.”",
        "“Does tha’ want to see him?” asked Martha suddenly,\nfor Mary had looked so pleased.",
        "“Yes, I do.  I never saw a boy foxes and crows loved.\nI want to see him very much.”",
        "Martha gave a little start, as if she remembered something.\n“Now to think,” she broke out, “to think o’ me forgettin’\nthat there; an’ I thought I was goin’ to tell you first\nthing this mornin’. I asked mother–and she said she’d ask\nMrs. Medlock her own self.”",
        "“Do you mean–” Mary began.",
        "“What I said Tuesday.  Ask her if you might be driven over\nto our cottage some day and have a bit o’ mother’s hot\noat cake, an’ butter, an’ a glass o’ milk.”",
        "It seemed as if all the interesting things were happening\nin one day.  To think of going over the moor in the\ndaylight and when the sky was blue! To think of going\ninto the cottage which held twelve children!",
        "“Does she think Mrs. Medlock would let me go?” she asked,\nquite anxiously.",
        "“Aye, she thinks she would.  She knows what a tidy woman\nmother is and how clean she keeps the cottage.”",
        "“If I went I should see your mother as well as Dickon,\"\nsaid Mary, thinking it over and liking the idea very much.\n“She doesn’t seem to be like the mothers in India.”",
        "Her work in the garden and the excitement of the afternoon\nended by making her feel quiet and thoughtful.  Martha stayed\nwith her until tea-time, but they sat in comfortable\nquiet and talked very little.  But just before Martha\nwent downstairs for the tea-tray, Mary asked a question.",
        "“Martha,” she said, “has the scullery-maid had the\ntoothache again today?”",
        "Martha certainly started slightly.",
        "“What makes thee ask that?” she said.",
        "“Because when I waited so long for you to come back I\nopened the door and walked down the corridor to see if you\nwere coming.  And I heard that far-off crying again,\njust as we heard it the other night.  There isn’t\na wind today, so you see it couldn’t have been the wind.”",
        "“Eh!” said Martha restlessly.  “Tha’ mustn’t go walkin’\nabout in corridors an’ listenin’. Mr. Craven would be\nthat there angry there’s no knowin’ what he’d do.”",
        "“I wasn’t listening,” said Mary.  “I was just waiting\nfor you–and I heard it.  That’s three times.”",
        "“My word! There’s Mrs. Medlock’s bell,” said Martha,\nand she almost ran out of the room.",
        "“It’s the strangest house any one ever lived in,\"\nsaid Mary drowsily, as she dropped her head on the cushioned\nseat of the armchair near her.  Fresh air, and digging,\nand skipping-rope had made her feel so comfortably tired\nthat she fell asleep.",
