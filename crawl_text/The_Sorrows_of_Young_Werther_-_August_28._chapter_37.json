        "If my ills would admit of any cure, they would certainly be cured\nhere. This is my birthday, and early in the morning I received a\npacket from Albert. Upon opening it, I found one of the pink\nribbons which Charlotte wore in her dress the first time I saw her,\nand which I had several times asked her to give me. With it were\ntwo volumes in duodecimo of Wetstein’s “Homer,” a book I had often\nwished for, to save me the inconvenience of carrying the large\nErnestine edition with me upon my walks. You see how they anticipate\nmy wishes, how well they understand all those little attentions\nof friendship, so superior to the costly presents of the great,\nwhich are humiliating. I kissed the ribbon a thousand times, and\nin every breath inhaled the remembrance of those happy and irrevocable\ndays which filled me with the keenest joy. Such, Wilhelm, is our\nfate. I do not murmur at it: the flowers of life are but visionary. \nHow many pass away, and leave no trace behind — how few yield any\nfruit — and the fruit itself, how rarely does it ripen! And yet\nthere are flowers enough! and is it not strange, my friend, that\nwe should suffer the little that does really ripen, to rot, decay,\nand perish unenjoyed?",
