        "“Jim, you long-haired, backslidden Caucasian nomad, why don’t you say\nsomething? Brace up and tell us your experience. Were you kidnapped when\nyou were a kid and run off into the wild wickyup of the forest, or how was\nit that you came to leave the Yankee reservation and eat the raw dog of\nthe Sioux?”",
        "We were all sitting around the roaring fat-pine fire at the foot of the\ncanon, and above us the full moon was filling the bottom of the black\nnotch in the mountains, where God began to engrave the gulch that grew\nwider and deeper till it reached the valley where we were.",
        "Squaw Jim was tall, silent and grave. He was as dignified as the king of\nclubs, and as reticent as the private cemetery of a deaf and dumb asylum.\nHe didn’t move when Dutch Joe spoke to him, but he noticed the remark, and\nafter awhile got up in the firelight, and later on the silent savage made\nthe longest speech of his life.",
        "“Boys, you call me Squaw Jim, and you call my girl a half breed. I have no\nother name than Squaw Jim with the pale faced dude and the dyspeptic sky\npilot who tells me of his God. You call me Squaw Jim because I’ve married\na squaw and insist on living with her. If I had married\nMist-of-the-Waterfall, and had lived in my tepee with her summers, and\nwintered at St. Louis with a wife who belonged to a tall peaked church,\nand who wore her war paint, and her false scalp-lock, and her false heart\ninto God’s wigwam, I’d be all right, probably. They would have laughed\nabout it a little among the boys, but it would have been “wayno” in the\nbig stone lodges at the white man’s city.",
        "“I loved a pale faced girl in Connecticut forty years ago. She said she\ndid me, but she met with a change of heart and married a bare-back rider\nin a circus. Then she ran away with the sword swallower of the side show,\nand finally broke her neck trying to walk the tight rope. The jury said if\nthe rope had been as tight as she was it might have saved her life.",
        "“Since then I’ve been where the sun and the air and the soil were free. It\nkind of soothed me to wear moccasins and throw my biled shirt into the\nMissouri. It took the fever of jealousy and disappointment out of my soul\nto sleep in the great bosom of the unhoused night. Soon I learned how to\nparley-vous in the Indian language, and to wear the clothes of the red\nman. I married the squaw girl who saved me from the mountain fever and my\nfoes. She did not yearn for the equestrian of the white man’s circus. She\ndidn’t know how to raise XxYxZ to the nth power, but she was a wife worthy\nof the President of the United States. She was way off the trail in\nmatters of etiquette, but she didn’t know what it was to envy and hate the\npale faced squaw with the sealskin sacque and the torpid liver, and the\nhigh-priced throne of grace. She never sighed to go where they are filling\nup Connecticut’s celestial exhibit with girls who get mysteriously\nmurdered and the young men who did it go out lecturing. You see I keep\nposted.",
        "“Boys, you kind of pity me, I reckon, and say Squaw Jim might have been in\nCongress if he’d stayed with his people and wore night shirts and pared\nhis claws, but you needn’t.",
        "“My wife can’t knock the tar out of a symphony on the piano, but she can\nmop the dew off the grass with a burglar, and knock out a dude’s eyes at\nsixty yards rise.",
        "“My wife is a little foggy on the winter style of salvation, and probably\nyou’d stall her on how to drape a silk velvet overskirt so it wouldn’t\nhang one-sided, but she has a crude idea of an every day, all wool General\nSuperintendent of the Universe and Father of all-Humanity, whether they\nlive under a horse blanket tepee or a Gothic mortgage. She might look out\nof place before the cross, with her chilblains and her childlike\nconfidence, among the Tom cat sealskin sacques of your camel’s hair\nChristianity, but if the world was supplied with Christians like my wife,\npurgatory would make an assignment, and the Salvation Army would go home\nand hoe corn. Sabe?”",
