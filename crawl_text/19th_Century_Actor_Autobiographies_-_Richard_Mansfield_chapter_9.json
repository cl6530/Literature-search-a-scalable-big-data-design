        "[Richard Mansfield, one of the great actors of his time, was born in\nHeligoland, then a British Possession, in 1857.  He prepared himself\nfor the East Indian civil service, then studied art, and opened a\nstudio in Boston.  He was soon attracted to the stage, and began\nplaying minor parts in comic opera, displaying marked ability from the\nfirst.  His versatility took him all the way from the role of Koko in\nthe “Mikado,” to Beau Brummel and Richard III.  His success soon\nenabled him to assemble a company of his own; as its manager he\nproduced with memorable effect “Cyrano de Bergerac,” “Henry V.,” and\n“Julius Caesar.”  He died in 1907, a few weeks after a striking\ncreation of “Peer Gynt.”  A biography of Mr. Mansfield by Mr. Paul\nWilstach is published by C. Scribner’s Sons, New York.",
        "Mr. Mansfield’s article on “Man and the Actor,” which appeared in the\nAtlantic Monthly, May, 1906, copyright by Houghton, Mifflin & Co.,\nBoston, is here given almost in full by the kind permission of the\npublishers and of Mrs. Richard Mansfield.  It is in effect an\nautobiographical revelation of the artist and the man.–ED.]",
        "Shakespeare does not say “may” play a part, or “can” play a part, but\nhe says must play a part; and he has expressed the conviction of\nevery intelligent student of humanity then and thereafter, now and\nhereafter.  The stage cannot be held in contempt by mankind; because\nall mankind is acting, and every human being is playing a part.  The\nbetter a man plays his part, the better he succeeds.  The more a man\nknows of the art of acting, the greater the man; for, from the king on\nhis throne to the beggar in the street, every man is acting.  There is\nno greater comedian or tragedian in the world than a great king.  The\nknowledge of the art of acting is indispensable to a knowledge of\nmankind, and when you are able to pierce the disguise in which every\nman arrays himself, or to read the character which every man assumes,\nyou achieve an intimate knowledge of your fellow men, and you are able\nto cope with the man, either as he is, or as he pretends to be.  It\nwas necessary for Shakespeare to be an actor in order to know men.\nWithout his knowledge of the stage, Shakespeare could never have been\nthe reader of men that he was.  And yet we are asked, “Is the stage\nworth while?”",
        "Napoleon and Alexander were both great actors–Napoleon perhaps the\ngreatest actor the world has ever seen.  Whether on the bridge of\nLodi, or in his camp at Tilsit; whether addressing his soldiers in the\nplains of Egypt; whether throwing open his old gray coat and saying,\n“Children, will you fire on your general?” whether bidding farewell to\nthem at Fontainebleau; whether standing on the deck of the\nBellerophon, or on the rocks of St. Helena–he was always an actor.\nNapoleon had studied the art of acting, and he knew its value.  If the\npower of the eye, the power of the voice, the power of that\nall-commanding gesture of the hand, failed him when he faced the\nregiment of veterans on his return from Elba, he was lost.  But he had\nproved and compelled his audience too often for his art to fail him\nthen.  The leveled guns fell.  The audience was his.  Another crown\nhad fallen!  By what?  A trick of the stage!  Was he willing to die\nthen? to be shot by his old guard?  Not he!  Did he doubt for one\nmoment his ability as an actor.  Not he!  If he had, he would have\nbeen lost.  And that power to control, that power to command, once it\nis possessed by a man, means that that man can play his part anywhere,\nand under all circumstances and conditions.  Unconsciously or\nconsciously, every great man, every man who has played a great part,\nhas been an actor.  Each man, every man, who has made his mark has\nchosen his character, the character best adapted to himself, and has\nplayed it, and clung to it, and made his impress with it.  I have but\nto conjure up the figure of Daniel Webster, who never lost an\nopportunity to act; or General Grant, who chose for his model William\nof Orange, surnamed the Silent.  You will find every one of your most\nadmired heroes choosing early in life some admired hero of his own to\ncopy.  Who can doubt that Napoleon had selected Julius Caesar?  For,\nonce he had founded an empire, everything about him was modelled after\nthe Caesarean regime.  Look at his coronation robes, the women’s\ngowns–the very furniture!  Actors, painters, musicians, politicians,\nsociety men and women, and kings and queens, all play their parts, and\nall build themselves after some favourite model.  In this woman of\nsociety you trace the influence of the Princess Metternich.  In\nanother we see her admiration (and a very proper one) for Her\nBritannic Majesty.  In another we behold George Eliot, or Queen Louise\nof Prussia, or the influence of some modern society leader.  But no\nmatter who it is, from the lowest to the highest, the actor is\ndominant in the human being, and this trait exhibits itself early in\nthe youngest child.  Everywhere you see stage-craft in one form or\nanother.  If men loved not costumes and scenery, would the king be\nescorted by the lifeguards, arrayed in shining helmets and\nbreastplates, which we know are perfectly useless in these days when a\nbullet will go through fifty of them with ease?  The first thing a man\nthinks of when he has to face any ordeal, be it a coronation or an\nexecution, is, how am I going to look? how am I to behave? what manner\nshall I assume? shall I appear calm and dignified, or happy and\npleased? shall I wear a portentous frown or a beaming smile? how shall\nI walk? shall I take short steps or long ones? shall I stoop as if\nbowed with care, or walk erect with courage and pride? shall I gaze\nfearlessly on all about me, or shall I drop my eyes modestly to the\nground?  If man were not always acting, he would not think of these\nthings at all, he would not bother his head about them, but would walk\nto his coronation or his execution according to his nature.  In the\nlast event this would have to be, in some cases, on all fours.",
        "I stretch my eyes over the wide world, and the people in it, and I can\nsee no one who is not playing a part; therefore respect the art of\nwhich you are all devotees, and, if you must act, learn to play your\nparts well.  Study the acting of others, so that you may discover what\npart is being played by others.",
        "It is, therefore, not amazing that everybody is interested in the art\nof acting, and it is not amazing that every one thinks he can act.\nYou have only to suggest private theatricals, when a house party is\nassembled at some country house, to verify the truth of the statement.\nImmediately commences a lively rivalry as to who shall play this part\nor that.  Each one considers herself or himself best suited, and I\nhave known private theatricals to lead to lifelong enmities.",
        "It is surprising to discover how very differently people who have\nplayed parts all their lives deport themselves before the footlights.\nI was acquainted with a lady in London who had been the wife of a peer\nof the realm, who had been ambassadress at foreign courts, who at one\ntime had been a reigning beauty, and who came to me, longing for a new\nexperience, and implored me to give her an opportunity to appear upon\nthe stage.  In a weak moment I consented, and as I was producing a\nplay, I cast her for a part which I thought she would admirably\nsuit-that of a society woman.  What that woman did and did not do on\nthe stage passes all belief.  She became entangled in her train, she\ncould neither sit down nor stand up, she shouted, she could not be\npersuaded to remain at a respectful distance, but insisted upon\nshrieking into the actor’s ears, and she committed all the gaucheries\nyou would expect from an untrained country wench.  But because\neverybody is acting in private life, every one thinks he can act upon\nthe stage, and there is no profession that has so many critics.  Every\nindividual in the audience is a critic, and knows all about the art of\nacting.  But acting is a gift.  It cannot be taught.  You can teach\npeople how to act acting–but you can’t teach them to act.  Acting is\nas much an inspiration as the making of great poetry and great\npictures.  What is commonly called acting is acting acting.  This is\nwhat is generally accepted as acting.  A man speaks lines, moves his\narms, wags his head, and does various other things; he may even shout\nand rant; some pull down their cuffs and inspect their finger nails;\nthey work hard and perspire, and their skin acts.  This is all easily\ncomprehended by the masses, and passes for acting, and is applauded,\nbut the man who is actually the embodiment of the character he is\ncreating will often be misunderstood, be disliked, and fail to\nattract.  Mediocrity rouses no opposition, but strong individualities\nand forcible opinions make enemies.  It is here that danger lies.\nMany an actor has set out with an ideal, but, failing to gain general\nfavour, has abandoned it for the easier method of winning popular\nacclaim.  Inspiration only comes to those who permit themselves to be\ninspired.  It is a form of hypnotism.  Allow yourself to be convinced\nby the character you are portraying that you are the character.  If\nyou are to play Napoleon, and you are sincere and determined to be\nNapoleon, Napoleon will not permit you to be any one but Napoleon, or\nRichard III. Richard III., or Nero Nero, and so on.  He would be a\npoor, miserable pretence of an actor who in the representation of any\nhistorical personage were otherwise than firmly convinced, after\ngetting into the man’s skin (which means the exhaustive study of all\nthat was ever known about him), that he is living that very man for a\nfew brief hours.  And so it is, in another form, with the creation or\nrealisation of the author’s, the poet’s, fancy.  In this latter case\nthe actor, the poet actor, sees and creates in the air before him the\nbeing he delineates; he makes him, he builds him during the day, in\nthe long hours of the night; the character gradually takes being; he\nis the actor’s genius; the slave of the ring, who comes when he calls\nhim, stands beside him, and envelops him in his ghostly arms; the\nactor’s personality disappears; he is the character.  You, you, and\nyou, and all of you, have the right to object to the actor’s creation;\nyou may say this is not your conception of Hamlet or Macbeth or Iago\nor Richard or Nero or Shylock–but respect his.  And who can tell\nwhether he is right or you are right?  He has created them with much\nloving care; therefore don’t sneer at them–don’t jeer at them–it\nhurts!  If you have reared a rosebush in your garden, and seen it bud\nand bloom, are you pleased to have some ruthless vandal tear the\nflowers from their stem and trample them in the mud?  And it is not\nalways our most beautiful children we love the best.  The parent’s\nheart will surely warm toward its feeblest child.",
        "It is very evident that any man, be he an actor or no actor, can, with\nmoney and with good taste, make what is technically termed a\nproduction.  There is, as an absolute matter of fact, no particular\ncredit to be attached to the making of a production.  The real work of\nthe stage, of the actor, does not lie there.  It is easy for us to\nbusy ourselves, to pass pleasantly our time, designing lovely scenes,\ncharming costumes, and all the paraphernalia and pomp of mimic\ngrandeur, whether of landscape or of architecture, the panoply of war,\nor the luxury of royal courts.  That is fun–pleasure and amusement.\nNo; the real work of the stage lies in the creation of a character.  A\ngreat character will live forever, when paint and canvas and silks and\nsatins and gold foil and tinsel shall have gone the way of all rags.",
        "But the long, lone hours with our heads in our hands, the toil, the\npatient study, the rough carving of the outlines, the dainty, delicate\nfinishing touches, the growing into the soul of the being we\ndelineate, the picture of his outward semblance, his voice, his gait,\nhis speech, all amount to a labour of such stress and strain, of such\nloving anxiety and care, that they can be compared in my mind only to\na mother’s pains.  And when the child is born it must grow in a few\nhours to completion, and be exhibited and coldly criticised.  How\noften, how often, have those long months of infinite toil been in\nvain!  How often has the actor led the child of his imagination to the\nfootlights, only to realise that he has brought into the world a\nweakling or a deformity which may not live!  And how often he has sat\nthrough the long night brooding over the corpse of this dear figment\nof his fancy!  It has lately become customary with many actor-managers\nto avoid these pangs of childbirth.  They have determinedly declined\nthe responsibility they owe to the poet and the public, and have\ninstead dazzled the eye with a succession of such splendid pictures\nthat the beholder forgets in a surfeit of the sight the feast that\nshould feed the soul.  This is what I am pleased to term talk versus\nacting.  The representative actors in London are much inclined in this\ndirection.",
        "The student may well ask, “What are we to copy, and whom are we to\ncopy?”  Don’t copy any one; don’t copy any individual actor, or his\nmethods.  The methods of one actor–the means by which he\narrives–cannot always be successfully employed by another.  The\nmethods and personality of one actor are no more becoming or suitable\nor adapted to another than certain gowns worn by women of fashion\nsimply because these gowns are the fashion.  In the art of acting,\nlike the art of painting, we must study life–copy life!  You will\nhave before you the work of great masters, and you will learn very\nmuch from them–quite as much what to avoid as what to follow.  No\npainting is perfect, and no acting is perfect.  No actor ever played a\npart to absolute perfection.  It is just as impossible for an actor to\nsimulate nature completely upon the stage as it is impossible for the\npainter to portray on canvas the waves of the ocean, the raging storm\nclouds, or the horrors of conflagration.",
        "The nearer the artist gets to nature, the greater he is.  We may\nadmire Rubens and Rembrandt and Vandyke and Gainsborough and Turner,\nbut who will dare to say that any one of their pictures is faultless?\nWe shall learn much from them all, but quite as much what to avoid as\nwhat to emulate.  But when you discover their faults, do not forget\ntheir virtues.  Look, and realise what it means to be able to do so\nmuch, And the actor’s art is even more difficult!  For its execution\nmust be immediate and spontaneous.  The word is delivered, the action\nis done, and the picture is painted!  Can I pause and say, “Ladies and\ngentlemen, that is not the way I wanted to do this, or to say that; if\nyou will allow me to try again, I think I can improve upon it?”",
        "The most severe critic can never tell me more, or scold me more than I\nscold myself.  I have never left the stage satisfied with myself.  And\nI am convinced that every artist feels as I do about his work.  It is\nthe undoubted duty of the critic to criticise, and that means to blame\nas well as to praise; and it must be confessed that, taking all things\ninto consideration, the critics of this country are actuated by\nhonesty of purpose and kindliness of spirit, and very often their work\nis, in addition, of marked literary value.  Occasionally we will still\nmeet the man who is anxious to impress his fellow citizens with the\nfact that he has been abroad, and tinctures all his views of plays and\nactors with references to Herr Dinkelspiegel or Frau Mitterwoorzer; or\nwho, having spent a few hours in Paris, is forced to drag in by the\nhair Monsieur Popin or Mademoiselle Fifine.  But as a matter of fact,\nis not the interpretation of tragedy and comedy by the American stage\nsuperior to the German and French?–for the whole endeavour in this\ncountry has been toward a closer adherence to nature.  In France and\nin Germany the ancient method of declamation still prevails, and the\ngreat speeches of Goethe and Schiller and Racine and Corneille are to\nall intents and purposes intoned.  No doubt this sounds very fine in\nGerman and French, but how would you like it now in English?",
        "The old-time actor had peculiar and primitive views as to elocution\nand its uses.  I remember a certain old friend of mine, who, when he\nrecited the opening speech in “Richard III.,” and arrived at the line\n“In the deep bosom of the ocean buried,” suggested the deep bosom of\nthe ocean by sending his voice down into his boots.  Yet these were\nfine actors, to whom certain young gentlemen, who never saw them,\nconstantly refer.  The methods of the stage have completely changed,\nand with them the tastes of the people.  The probability is that some\nof the old actors of only a few years ago would excite much merriment\nin their delineation of tragedy.  A very great tragedian of a past\ngeneration was wont, in the tent scene in “Richard III.,” to hold a\npiece of soap in his mouth, so that, after the appearance of the\nghosts, the lather and froth might dribble down his chin! and he\nemployed, moreover, a trick sword, which rattled hideously; and, what\nwith his foam-flecked face, his rolling eyes, his inarticulate groans,\nand his rattling blade, the small boy in the gallery was scared into a\nfrenzy of vociferous delight!",
        "Yet, whilst we have discarded these somewhat crude methods, we have\nperhaps allowed ourselves to wander too far in the other direction,\nand the critics are quite justified in demanding in many cases greater\nvirility and force.  The simulation of suppressed power is very useful\nand very advisable, but when the fire-bell rings the horses have got\nto come out, and rattle and race down the street, and rouse the town!",
        "Whilst we are on the subject of these creations of the poets and the\nactors, do you understand how important is discipline on the stage?\nHow can an actor be away from this earth, moving before you in the\nspirit he has conjured up, only to be dragged back to himself and his\nactual surroundings of canvas and paint and tinsel and limelights by\nsome disturbing influence in the audience or on the stage?  If you\nwant the best, if you love the art, foster it.  It is worthy of your\ngentlest care and your kindest, tenderest thought.  Your silence is\noften more indicative of appreciation than your applause.  The actor\ndoes not need your applause in order to know when you are in sympathy\nwith him.",
        "He feels very quickly whether you are antagonistic or friendly.  He\ncares very little for the money, but a great deal for your affection\nand esteem.  Discipline on the stage has almost entirely disappeared,\nand year after year the exercise of our art becomes more difficult.  I\nam sorry to say some newspapers are, unwittingly perhaps, largely\nresponsible for this.  When an editor discharges a member of his force\nfor any good and sufficient reason–and surely a man must be permitted\nto manage and control his own business–no paper will publish a\ntwo-column article, with appropriate cuts, detailing the wrongs of the\ndischarged journalist, and the hideous crime of the editor!  Even an\neditor–and an editor is supposed to be able to stand almost\nanything–would become weary after a while; discipline would cease,\nand your newspapers would be ill-served.  Booth, Jefferson, and other\nactors soon made up their minds that the easiest road was the best for\nthem.  Mr. Booth left the stage management entirely to Mr. Lawrence\nBarrett and others, and Mr. Jefferson praised everybody and every\nthing.  But this is not good for the stage.  My career on the stage is\nnearly over, and until, shortly, I bid it farewell, I shall continue\nto do my best; but we are all doing it under ever-growing\ndifficulties.  Actors on the stage are scarce, actors off the stage,\nas I have demonstrated, I hope, are plentiful.  Life insurance\npresidents–worthy presidents, directors, and trustees–have been so\nbusy acting their several parts in the past, and are in the present so\nbusy trying to unact them, men are so occupied from their childhood\nwith the mighty dollar, the race for wealth is so strenuous and\nall-entrancing, that imagination is dying out; and imagination is\nnecessary to make a poet or an actor; the art of acting is the\ncrystallisation of all arts.  It is a diamond in the facets of which\nis mirrored every art.  It is, therefore, the most difficult of all\narts.  The education of a king is barely sufficient for the education\nof the comprehending and comprehensive actor.  If he is to satisfy\nevery one, he should possess the commanding power of a Caesar, the\nwisdom of Solomon, the eloquence of Demosthenes, the patience of Job,\nthe face and form of Antinous, and the strength and endurance of\nHercules.",
        "The stage is not likely to die of neglect anywhere.  But at this\nmoment it cannot be denied that the ship of the stage is drifting\nsomewhat hither and thither, Every breath of air and every current of\npublic opinion impels it first in one direction and then in another,\nAt one moment we may be said to be in the doldrums of the English\nsociety drama, or we are sluggishly rolling along in a heavy ground\nswell, propelled by a passing cat’s paw of revivals of old melodramas.\nAgain we catch a very faint northerly breeze from Ibsen, or a\nsoutheaster from Maeterlinck and Hauptmann.  Sometimes we set our\nsails to woo that ever-clearing breeze of Shakespeare, only to be\nforced out of our course by a sputter of rain, an Irish mist, and half\na squall from George Bernard Shaw; but the greater part of the time\nthe ship of the stage is careering wildly under bare poles, with a man\nlashed to the helm (and let us hope that, like Ulysses, he has cotton\nwool in his ears), before a hurricane of comic opera.  We need a\nrecognised stage and a recognised school.  America has become too\ngreat, and its influence abroad too large, for us to afford to have\nrecourse to that ancient and easy method of criticism which decries\nthe American and extols the foreign.  That is one of those last\nremnants of colonialism and provincialism which must depart forever.",
        "What could not be done for the people of this land, were we to have a\ngreat and recognised theatre!  Consider our speech, and our manner of\nspeech!  Consider our voices, and the production of our voices!\nConsider the pronunciation of words, and the curious use of vowels!\nLet us say we have an established theatre, to which you come not only\nfor your pleasure, but for your education.  Of what immense advantage\nthis would be if behind its presiding officer there stood a board of\nliterary directors, composed of such men as William Winter, Howells,\nEdward Everett Hale, and Aldrich, and others equally fine, and the\npresidents of the great universities.  These men might well decide how\nthe American language should be spoken in the great American theatre,\nand we should then have an authority in this country at last for the\npronunciation of certain words.  It would finally be decided whether\nto say fancy or fahncy–dance or dahnce–advertisement or\nadvertysement, and so with many other words; whether to call the\nobject of our admiration “real elegant\"–whether we should say “I\nadmire” to do this or that, and whether we should say “I guess\"\ninstead of “I think.”  And the voice!  The education of the American\nspeaking voice is, I am sure all will agree, of immense importance.\nIt is difficult to love, or to continue to endure, a woman who shrieks\nat you; a high-pitched, nasal, stringy voice is not calculated to\ncharm.  This established theatre of which we dream should teach men\nand women how to talk; and how splendid it would be for future\ngenerations if it should become characteristic of American men and\nwomen to speak in soft and beautifully modulated tones!",
        "These men of whom I have spoken could meet once a year in the great\ngreen-room of this theatre of my imagination, and decide upon the\nworks to be produced–the great classics, the tragedies and comedies;\nand living authors should be invited and encouraged.  Here, again, we\nshould have at last what we so badly need, an encouragement for men\nand women to write poetry for the stage.  Nothing by way of the\nbeautiful seems to be written for us to-day, but perhaps the\nacknowledgment and the hall-mark of a great theatre might prove an\nincentive.",
        "The training of the actor!  To-day there is practically none.  Actors\nand actresses are not to be taught by patting them on the shoulders\nand saying, “Fine!  Splendid!”  It is a hard, hard school, on the\ncontrary, of unmerciful criticism.  And he is a poor master who seeks\ncheap popularity amongst his associates by glossing over and praising\nwhat he knows to be condemnable.  No good result is to be obtained by\nthis method, but it is this method which has caused a great many\nactors to be beloved, and the public to be very much distressed.",
        "As for the practical side of an established theatre, I am absolutely\nconvinced that the national theatre could be established in this\ncountry on a practical and paying basis; and not only on a paying\nbasis, but upon a profitable basis.  It would, however, necessitate\nthe investment of a large amount of capital.  In short, the prime cost\nwould be large, but if the public generally is interested, there is no\nreason why an able financier could not float a company for this\npurpose.  But under no circumstances must or can a national theatre,\nin the proper use of the term, be made an object of personal or\ncommercial profit.  Nor can it be a scheme devised by a few\nindividuals for the exploitation of a social or literary fad.  The\nnational theatre must be given by the people to the people, and be\ngoverned by the people.  The members of the national theatre should be\nelected by the board of directors, and should be chosen from the\nAmerican and British stage alike, or from any country where English is\nthe language of the people.  Every inducement should be offered to\nsecure the services of the best actors; by actors, I mean actors of\nboth sexes; and those who have served for a certain number of years\nshould be entitled to a pension upon retirement.",
        "It is not necessary to bother with further details; I only mention\nthis to impress the reader with the fact that the national theatre is\na practical possibility.  From my personal experience I am convinced\nthat serious effort upon the American stage meets with a hearty\nendorsement.",
