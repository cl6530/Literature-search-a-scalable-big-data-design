        "In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish\nof beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth,\nand that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of\nstraw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped\nwithout her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and\nsoon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two.\nThen the straw began and said: ’Dear friends, from whence do you come\nhere?’ The coal replied: ’I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if\nI had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain,–I\nshould have been burnt to ashes.’ The bean said: ’I too have escaped\nwith a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I\nshould have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.’\n’And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?’ said the straw. ’The\nold woman has destroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke; she seized\nsixty of them at once, and took their lives. I luckily slipped through\nher fingers.’",
        "’But what are we to do now?’ said the coal.",
        "’I think,’ answered the bean, ’that as we have so fortunately escaped\ndeath, we should keep together like good companions, and lest a new\nmischance should overtake us here, we should go away together, and\nrepair to a foreign country.’",
        "The proposition pleased the two others, and they set out on their way\ntogether. Soon, however, they came to a little brook, and as there was\nno bridge or foot-plank, they did not know how they were to get over\nit. The straw hit on a good idea, and said: ’I will lay myself\nstraight across, and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge.’ The\nstraw therefore stretched itself from one bank to the other, and the\ncoal, who was of an impetuous disposition, tripped quite boldly on to\nthe newly-built bridge. But when she had reached the middle, and heard\nthe water rushing beneath her, she was after all, afraid, and stood\nstill, and ventured no farther. The straw, however, began to burn,\nbroke in two pieces, and fell into the stream. The coal slipped after\nher, hissed when she got into the water, and breathed her last. The\nbean, who had prudently stayed behind on the shore, could not but\nlaugh at the event, was unable to stop, and laughed so heartily that\nshe burst. It would have been all over with her, likewise, if, by good\nfortune, a tailor who was travelling in search of work, had not sat\ndown to rest by the brook. As he had a compassionate heart he pulled\nout his needle and thread, and sewed her together. The bean thanked\nhim most prettily, but as the tailor used black thread, all beans\nsince then have a black seam.",
