        "Arthur, about to issue forth at a quarter to seven on Monday morning to\nbegin work as a cooper’s apprentice, felt as if he would find all Saint X\nlined up to watch him make the journey in working clothes. He had a bold\nfront as he descended the lawn toward the gates; but at the risk of\nopening him to those with no sympathy for weaknesses other than their\nown, and for their own only in themselves, it must be set down that he\nseemed to himself to be shaking and skulking. He set his teeth together,\ngave himself a final savage cut with the lash of “What a damned coward I\nam!” and closed the gate behind him and was in the street–a workingman.\nHe did not realize it, but he had shown his mettle; for, no man with any\nreal cowardice anywhere in him would have passed through that gate and\nfaced a world that loves to sneer.",
        "From the other big houses of that prosperous neighborhood were coming,\nalso in working clothes, the fathers, and occasionally the sons, of\nfamilies he was accustomed to regard as “all right–for Saint X.” At the\ncorner of Cherry Lane, old Bolingbroke, many times a millionaire thanks\nto a thriving woolen factory, came up behind him and cried out, ’Well,\nyoung man! This is something like.” In his enthusiasm he put his arm\nthrough Arthur’s. “As soon as I read your father’s will, I made one\nmyself,” he continued as they hurried along at Bolingbroke’s always\nfurious speed. “I always did have my boys at work; I send ’em down half\nan hour before me every morning. But it occurred to me they might bury\ntheir enthusiasm in the cemetery along with me.” He gave his crackling,\nsnapping laugh that was strange and even startling in itself, but seemed\nthe natural expression of his snapping eyes and tight-curling, wiry\nwhiskers and hair. “So I fixed up my will. No pack of worthless heirs to\nmake a mockery of my life and teachings after I’m gone. No, sir-ee!”",
        "Arthur was more at ease. “Appearances” were no longer against\nhim–distinctly the reverse. He wondered that his vanity could have made\nhim overlook the fact that what he was about to do was as much the\nregular order in prosperous Saint X, throughout the West for that matter,\nas posing as a European gentleman was the regular order of the “upper\nclasses” of New York and Boston–and that even there the European\ngentleman was a recent and rather rare importation. And Bolingbroke’s\nhearty admiration, undeserved though Arthur felt it to be, put what he\nthought was nerve into him and stimulated what he then regarded as pride.\n“After all, I’m not really a common workman,” reflected he. “It’s like\nmother helping Mary.” And he felt still better when, passing the little\nmillinery shop of “Wilmot & Company” arm in arm with the great woolen\nmanufacturer, he saw Estelle Wilmot–sweeping out. Estelle would have\nlooked like a storybook princess about royal business, had she been down\non her knees scrubbing a sidewalk. He was glad she didn’t happen to see\nhim, but he was gladder that he had seen her. Clearly, toil was beginning\nto take on the appearance of “good form.”",
        "He thought pretty well of himself all that day. Howells treated him like\nthe proprietor’s son; Pat Waugh, foreman of the cooperage, put “Mr.\nArthur” or “Mr. Ranger” into every sentence; the workingmen addressed him\nas “sir,” and seemed to appreciate his talking as affably with them as if\nhe were unaware of the precipice of caste which stretched from him down\nto them. He was in a pleasant frame of mind as he went home and bathed\nand dressed for dinner. And, while he knew he had really been in the way\nat the cooperage and had earned nothing, yet–his ease about his social\nstatus permitting–he felt a sense of self-respect which was of an\nentirely new kind, and had the taste of the fresh air of a keen, clear\nwinter day.",
        "This, however, could not last. The estate was settled up; the fiction\nthat he was of the proprietorship slowly yielded to the reality; the\nmen, not only those over him but also those on whose level he was\nsupposed to be, began to judge him as a man. “The boys say,” growled\nWaugh to Howells, “that he acts like one of them damn spying dude sons\nproprietors sometimes puts in among the men to learn how to work ’em\nharder for less. He don’t seem to catch on that he’s got to get his\nmoney out of his own hands.”",
        "“Touch him up a bit,” said Howells, who had worshiped Hiram Ranger and in\na measure understood what had been in his mind when he dedicated his son\nto a life of labor. “If it becomes absolutely necessary I’ll talk to him.\nBut maybe you can do the trick.”",
        "Waugh, who had the useful man’s disdain of deliberately useless men and\nthe rough man’s way of feeling it and showing it, was not slow to act on\nHowells’s license. That very day he found Arthur unconsciously and even\npatronizingly shirking the tending of a planer so that his teacher, Bud\nRollins, had to do double work. Waugh watched this until it had “riled\"\nhim sufficiently to loosen his temper and his language. “Hi, there,\nRanger!” he shouted. “What the hell! You’ve been here goin’ on six months\nnow, and you’re more in the way than you was the first day.”",
        "Arthur flushed, flashed, clenched his fists; but the planer was between\nhim and Waugh, and that gave Waugh’s tremendous shoulders and fists a\nchance to produce a subduing visual impression. A man, even a young man,\nwho is nervous on the subject of his dignity, will, no matter how brave\nand physically competent, shrink from avoidable encounter that means\ndoubtful battle. And dignity was a grave matter with young Ranger in\nthose days.",
        "“Don’t hoist your dander up at me,” said Waugh. “Get it up agin’\nyourself. Bud, next time he soldiers on you, send him to me.”",
        "“All right, sir,” replied Bud, with a soothing grin. And when Waugh was\ngone, he said to Arthur, “Don’t mind him. Just keep pegging along, and\nyou’ll learn all right.”",
        "Bud’s was the tone a teacher uses to encourage a defective child. It\nstung Arthur more fiercely than had Waugh’s. It flashed on him that the\nmen–well, they certainly hadn’t been looking up to him as he had been\nfondly imagining. He went at his work resolutely, but blunderingly; he\nspoiled a plank and all but clogged the machine. His temper got clean\naway from him, and he shook with a rage hard to restrain from venting\nitself against the inanimate objects whose possessing devils he could\nhear jeering at him through the roar of the machinery.",
        "“Steady! Steady!” warned good-natured Rollins. “You’ll drop a hand under\nthat knife.”",
        "The words had just reached Arthur when he gave a sharp cry. With a cut\nas clean as the edge that made it, off came the little finger of his\nleft hand, and he was staring at it as it lay upon the bed of the\nplaner, twitching, seeming to breathe as its blood pulsed out, while the\nblood spurted from his maimed hand. In an instant Lorry Tague had the\nmachine still.",
        "“A bucket of clean water,” he yelled to the man at the next planer.",
        "He grabbed dazed Arthur’s hand, and pressed hard with his powerful thumb\nand forefinger upon the edges of the wound.",
        "“A doctor!” he shouted at the men crowding round.",
        "Arthur did not realize what had happened until he found himself forced to\nhis knees, his hand submerged in the ice-cold water, Lorry still holding\nshut the severed veins and arteries.",
        "“Another bucket of water, you, Bill,” cried Lorry.",
        "When it came he had Bill Johnstone throw the severed finger into it. Bud\nRollins, who had jumped through the window into the street in a dash for\na physician, saw Doctor Schulze’s buggy just turning out of High Street.\nHe gave chase, had Schulze beside Arthur within two minutes. More water,\nboth hot and cold, was brought, and a cleared work bench; with swift,\nsure fingers the doctor cleaned the stump, cleaned the severed finger,\njoined and sewed them, bandaged the hand.",
        "“Now, I’ll take you home,” he said. “I guess you’ve distinguished\nyourself enough for the day.”",
        "Arthur followed him, silent and meek as a humbled dog. As they were\ndriving along Schulze misread a mournful look which Arthur cast at his\nbandaged hand. “It’s nothing–nothing at all,” he said gruffly. “In a\nweek or less you could be back at work.” The accompanying sardonic grin\nsaid plain as print, “But this dainty dandy is done with work.”",
        "Weak and done though Arthur was, some blood came into his pale face and\nhe bit his lip with anger.",
        "Schulze saw these signs.",
        "“Several men are killed every year in those works–and not through\ntheir carelessness, either,” he went on in a milder, friendlier tone.\n“And forty or fifty are maimed–not like that little pin scratch of\nyours, my dear Mr. Ranger, but hands lost, legs lost–accidents that make\ncripples for life. That means tragedy–not the wolf at the door, but with\nhis snout right in the platter.”",
        "“I’ve seen that,” said Arthur. “But I never thought much about\nit–until now.”",
        "“Naturally,” commented Schulze, with sarcasm. Then he added\nphilosophically, “And it’s just as well not to bother about it. Mankind\nfound this world a hell, and is trying to make it over into a heaven. And\na hell it still is, even more of a hell than at first, and it’ll be still\nmore of a hell–for these machines and these slave-driving capitalists\nwith their luxury-crazy families are worse than wars and aristocrats.\nThey make the men work, and the women and the children–make ’em all work\nas the Pharaohs never sweated the wretches they set at building the\npyramids. The nearer the structure gets toward completion, the worse the\ndriving and the madder the haste. Some day the world’ll be worth living\nin–probably just about the time it’s going to drop into the sun.\nMeanwhile, it’s a hell of a place. We’re a race of slaves, toiling for\nthe benefit of the race of gods that’ll some day be born into a habitable\nworld and live happily ever afterwards. Science will give them\nhappiness–and immortality, if they lose the taste for the adventure into\nthe Beyond.”",
        "Arthur’s brain heard clearly enough to remember afterwards; but Schulze’s\nvoice seemed to be coming through a thick wall. When they reached the\nRanger house, Schulze had to lift him from the buggy and support his\nweight and guide his staggering steps. Out ran Mrs. Ranger, with theterror in her eyes.",
        "“Don’t lose your head, ma’am,” said Schulze. “It’s only a cut finger. The\nyoung fool forgot he was steering a machine, and had a sharp but slight\nreminder.”",
        "Schulze was heavily down on the “interesting-invalid” habit. He held that\nthe world’s supply of sympathy was so small that there wasn’t enough to\nprovide encouragement for those working hard and well; that those who\nfell into the traps of illness set in folly by themselves should get, at\nmost, toleration in the misfortunes in which others were compelled to\nshare. “The world discourages strength and encourages weakness,” he used\nto declaim. “That injustice and cruelty must be reversed!”",
        "“Doctor Schulze is right,” Arthur was saying to his mother, with an\nattempt at a smile. But he was glad of the softness and ease of the big\ndivan in the back parlor, of the sense of hovering and protecting love he\ngot from his mother’s and Adelaide’s anxious faces. Sorer than the really\ntrifling wound was the deep cut into his vanity. How his fellow-workmen\nwere pitying him!–a poor blockhead of a bungler who had thus brought to\na pitiful climax his failure to learn a simple trade. And how the whole\ntown would talk and laugh! “Hiram Ranger, he begat a fool!”",
        "Schulze, with proper equipment, redressed and rebandaged the wound, and\nleft, after cautioning the young man not to move the sick arm. “You’ll\nbe all right to strum the guitar and sport a diamond ring in a fortnight\nat the outside,” said he. At the door he lectured Adelaide: “For God’s\nsake, Miss Ranger, don’t let his mother coddle him. He’s got the makings\nof a man like his father–not as big, perhaps, but still a lot of a man.\nGive him a chance! Give him a chance! If this had happened in a football\ngame or a fox-hunt, nobody would have thought anything of it. But just\nbecause it was done at useful work, you’ve got yourself all fixed to make\na fearful to-do.”",
        "How absurdly does practice limp along, far behind firm-striding theory!\nSchulze came twice that day, looked in twice the next day, and fussed\nlike a disturbed setting-hen when his patient forestalled the next day’s\nvisit by appearing at his office for treatment. “I want to see if I\ncan’t heal that cut without a scar,” was his explanation–but it was a\nmere excuse.",
        "When Arthur called on the fifth day, Schulze’s elder daughter, Madelene,\nopened the door. “Will you please tell the doctor,” said he, “that the\nworkman who cut his finger at the cooperage wishes to see him?”",
        "Madelene’s dark gray eyes twinkled. She was a tall and, so he thought,\nrather severe-looking young woman; her jet black hair was simply, yet not\nwithout a suspicion of coquetry, drawn back over her ears from a central\npart–or what would have been a part had her hair been less thick. She\nwas studying medicine under her father. It was the first time he had seen\nher, it so happened, since she was in knee dresses at public school. As\nhe looked he thought: “A splendid advertisement for the old man’s\nbusiness.” Just why she seemed so much healthier than even the\nhealthiest, he found it hard to understand. She was neither robust nor\nradiant. Perhaps it was the singular clearness of her dead-white skin and\nof the whites of her eyes; again it might have been the deep crimson of\nher lips and of the inside of her mouth–a wide mouth with two perfect\nrows of small, strong teeth of the kind that go with intense vitality.",
        "“Just wait here,” said she, in a businesslike tone, as she indicated the\nreception room.",
        "“You don’t remember me?” said Arthur, to detain her.",
        "“No, I don’t remember you,” replied Madelene. “But I know who you are.”",
        "“Who I was,” thought Arthur, his fall never far from the foreground of\nhis mind. “You used to be very serious, and always perfect in your\nlessons,” he continued aloud, “and–most superior.”",
        "Madelene laughed. “I was a silly little prig,” said she. Then, not\nwithout a subtle hint of sarcasm, “But I suppose we all go through that\nperiod–some of us in childhood, others further along.”",
        "Arthur smiled, with embarrassment. So he had the reputation of\nbeing a prig.",
        "Madelene was in the doorway. “Father will be free–presently,” said she.\n“He has another patient with him. If you don’t care to wait, perhaps I\ncan look after the cut. Father said it was a trifle.”",
        "Arthur slipped his arm out of the sling.",
        "“In here,” said Madelene, opening the door of a small room to the left of\nher father’s consultation room.",
        "Arthur entered. “This is your office?” he asked, looking round curiously,\nadmiringly. It certainly was an interesting room, as the habitat of an\ninteresting personality is bound to be.",
        "“Yes,” she replied. “Sit here, please.”",
        "Arthur seated himself in the chair by the window and rested his arm on\nthe table. He thought he had never seen fingers so long as hers, or so\ngraceful. Evidently she had inherited from her father that sure, firm\ntouch which is perhaps the highest talent of the surgeon. “It seems such\nan–an–such a hard profession for a woman,” said he, to induce those\nfascinating lips of hers to move.",
        "“It isn’t soft,” she replied. “But then father hasn’t brought us up\nsoft.”",
        "This was discouraging, but Arthur tried again. “You like it?”",
        "“I love it,” said she, and now her eyes were a delight. “It makes me\nhate to go to bed at night, and eager to get up in the morning. And that\nmeans really living, doesn’t it?”",
        "“A man like me must seem to you a petty sort of creature.”",
        "“Oh, I haven’t any professional haughtiness,” was her laughing reply.\n“One kind of work seems to me just as good as another. It’s the spirit of\nthe workman that makes the only differences.”",
        "“That’s it,” said Arthur, with a humility which he thought genuine and\nwhich was perhaps not wholly false. “I don’t seem to be able to give my\nheart to my work.”",
        "“I fancy you’ll give it attention hereafter,” suggested Madelene. She\nhad dressed the almost healed finger and was dexterously rebandaging it.\nShe was necessarily very near to him, and from her skin there seemed to\nissue a perfumed energy that stimulated his nerves. Their eyes met. Both\nsmiled and flushed.",
        "“That wasn’t very kind–that remark,” said he.",
        "“What’s all this?” broke in the sharp voice of the doctor.",
        "Arthur started guiltily, but Madelene, without lifting her eyes from her\ntask, answered: “Mr. Ranger didn’t want to be kept waiting.”",
        "“She’s trying to steal my practice away from me!” cried Schulze. He\nlooked utterly unlike his daughter at first glance, but on closer\ninspection there was an intimate resemblance, like that between the nut\nand its rough, needle-armored shell. “Well, I guess she hasn’t botched\nit.” This in a pleased voice, after an admiring inspection of the\nworkmanlike bandage. “Come again to-morrow, young man.”",
        "Arthur bowed to Madelene and somehow got out into the street. He was\nastonished at himself and at the world. He had gone drearily into that\noffice out of a dreary world; he had issued forth light of heart and\ndelighted with the fresh, smiling, interesting look of the shaded streets\nand the green hedges and lawns and flower beds. “A fine old town,” he\nsaid to himself. “Nice, friendly people–and the really right sort. As\nsoon as I’m done with the rough stretch I’ve got just ahead of me, I’m\ngoing to like it. Let me see–one of those girls was named Walpurga and\none was named–Madelene–this one, I’m sure–Yes!” And he could hear the\nteacher calling the roll, could hear the alto voice from the serious face\nanswer to “Madelene Schulze,” could hear the light voice from the face\nthat was always ready to burst into smiles answer to “Walpurga Schulze.”",
        "But though it was quite unnecessary he, with a quite unnecessary show of\ncarelessness, asked Del which was which. “The black one is Madelene,\"\nreplied she, and her ability to speak in such an indifferent tone of such\nan important person surprised him. “The blonde is Walpurga. I used to\ndetest Madelene. She always treated me as if I hadn’t any sense.”",
        "“Well, you can’t blame her for that, Del,” said Arthur. “You’ve been a\ngreat deal of a fool in your day–before you blossomed out. Do you\nremember the time Dory called you down for learning things to show off,\nand how furious you got?”",
        "Adelaide looked suddenly warm, though she laughed too. “Why did you ask\nabout Dr. Schulze’s daughters?” she asked.",
        "“I saw one of them this morning–a beauty, a tip-topper. And no nonsense\nabout her. As she’s ’black,’ I suppose her name is Madelene.”",
        "“Oh, I remember now!” exclaimed Adelaide. “Madelene is going to be a\ndoctor. They say she’s got nerves of iron–can cut and slash like\nher father.”",
        "Arthur was furious, just why he didn’t know. No doubt what Del said was\ntrue, but there were ways and ways of saying things. “I suppose there is\nsome sneering at her,” said he, “among the girls who couldn’t do\nanything if they tried. It seems to me, if there is any profession a\nwoman could follow without losing her womanliness, it is that of doctor.\nEvery woman ought to be a doctor, whether she ever tries to make a\nliving out of it or not.”",
        "Adelaide was not a little astonished by this outburst.",
        "“You’ll be coming round to Dory’s views of women, if you aren’t\ncareful,” said she.",
        "“There’s a lot of sense in what Dory says about a lot of things,\"\nreplied Arthur.",
        "Del sheered off. “How did the doctor say your hand is?”",
        "“Oh–all right,” said Arthur. “I’m going to work on Monday.”",
        "“Did he say you could?”",
        "“No, but I’m tired of doing nothing. I’ve got to ’get busy’ if I’m to\npull out of this mess.”",
        "His look, his tone made his words sound revolutionary. And, in fact, his\nmood was revolutionary. He was puzzled at his own change of attitude. His\nsky had cleared of black clouds; the air was no longer heavy and\noppressive. He wanted to work; he felt that by working he could\naccomplish something, could deserve and win the approval of people who\nwere worthwhile–people like Madelene Schulze, for instance.",
        "Next day he lurked round the corner below the doctor’s house until he saw\nhim drive away; then he went up and rang the bell. This time it was the\n“blonde” that answered–small and sweet, pink and white, with tawny hair.\nThis was disconcerting. “I couldn’t get here earlier,” he explained. “I\nsaw the doctor just driving away. But, as these bandages feel\nuncomfortable, I thought perhaps his daughter–your sister, is she\nnot?–might–might fix them.”",
        "Walpurga looked doubtful. “I think she’s busy,” she said. “I don’t like\nto disturb her.”",
        "Just then Madelene crossed the hall. Her masses of black hair were rolled\ninto a huge knot on top of her head; she was wearing a white work slip\nand her arms were bare to the elbows–the finest arms he had ever seen,\nArthur thought. She seemed in a hurry and her face was flushed–she would\nhave looked no differently if she had heard his voice and had come forth\nto prevent his getting away without having seen him. “Meg!” called her\nsister. “Can you–”",
        "Madelene apparently saw her sister and Arthur for the first time. “Good\nmorning, Mr. Ranger. You’ve come too late. Father’s out.”",
        "Arthur repeated his doleful tale, convincingly now, for his hand did feel\nqueer–as what hand would not, remembering such a touch as Madelene’s,\nand longing to experience it again?",
        "“Certainly,” said Madelene. “I’ll do the best I can. Come in.”",
        "And once more he was in her office, with her bending over him. And\npresently her hair came unrolled, came showering down on his arm, on his\nface; and he shook like a leaf and felt as if he were going to faint,\ninto such an ecstasy did the soft rain of these tresses throw him. As\nfor Madelene, she was almost hysterical in her confusion. She darted\nfrom the room.",
        "When she returned she seemed calm, but that was because she did not lift\nthose tell-tale gray eyes. Neither spoke as she finished her work. If\nArthur had opened his lips it would have been to say words which he\nthought she would resent, and he repent. Not until his last chance had\nalmost ebbed did he get himself sufficiently in hand to speak. “It wasn’t\ntrue–what I said,” he began. “I waited until your father was gone. Then\nI came–to see you. As you probably know, I’m only a workman, hardly even\nthat, at the cooperage, but–I want to come to see you. May I?”",
        "She hesitated.",
        "“I know the people in this town have a very poor opinion of me,” he went\non, “and I deserve it, no doubt. You see, the bottom dropped out of my\nlife not long ago, and I haven’t found myself yet. But you did more for\nme in ten minutes the other day than everything and everybody, including\nmyself, have been able to do since my father died.”",
        "“I don’t remember that I said anything,” she murmured.",
        "“I didn’t say that what you said helped me. I said what you did–and\nlooked. And–I’d like to come.”",
        "“We never have any callers,” she explained. “You see,\nfather’s–our–views–People don’t understand us. And, too, we’ve found\nourselves very congenial and sufficient unto one another. So–I–I–don’t\nknow what to say.”",
        "He looked so cast down that she hastened on: “Yes–come whenever you\nlike. We’re always at home. But we work all day.”",
        "“So do I,” said Arthur. “Thank you. I’ll come–some evening next week.”",
        "Suddenly he felt peculiarly at ease with her, as if he had always known\nher, as if she and he understood each other perfectly. “I’m afraid you’ll\nfind me stupid,” he went on. “I don’t know much about any of the things\nyou’re interested in.”",
        "“Perhaps I’m interested in more things than you imagine,” said she. “My\nsister says I’m a fraud–that I really have a frivolous mind and that my\nserious look is a hollow pretense.”",
        "And so they talked on, not getting better acquainted but enjoying the\nrealization of how extremely well acquainted they were. When he was gone,\nMadelene found that her father had been in for some time. “Didn’t he ask\nfor me?” she said to Walpurga.",
        "“Yes,” answered Walpurga. “And I told him you were flirting with\nArthur Ranger.”",
        "Madelene colored violently. “I never heard that word in this house\nbefore,” she said stiffly.",
        "“Nor I,” replied Walpurga, the pink and white. “And I think it’s high\ntime–with you nearly twenty-two and me nearly twenty.”",
        "At dinner her father said: “Well, Lena, so you’ve got a beau at last. I’d\ngiven up hope.”",
        "“For Heaven’s sake don’t scare him away, father!” cried Walpurga.",
        "“A pretty poor excuse,” pursued the doctor. “I doubt if Arthur Ranger can\nmake enough to pay his own board in a River Street lodging house.”",
        "“It took courage–real courage–to go to work as he did,” replied\nMadelene, her color high.",
        "“Yes,” admitted her father, ’if he sticks to it.”",
        "“He will stick to it,” affirmed Madelene.",
        "“I think so,” assented her father, dropping his teasing pretense and\ncoming out frankly for Arthur. “When a man shows that he has the courage\nto cross the Rubicon, there’s no need to worry about whether he’ll go on\nor turn back.”",
        "“You mustn’t let him know he’s the only beau you’ve ever had, Meg,\"\ncautioned her sister.",
        "“And why not?” demanded Madelene. “If I ever did care especially for a\nman, I’d not care for him because other women had. And I shouldn’t want a\nman to be so weak and vain as to feel that way about me.”",
        "It was a temptation to that aloof and isolated, yet anything but lonely\nor lonesome, household to discuss this new and strange phenomenon–the\nintrusion of an outsider, and he a young man. But the earnestness in\nMadelene’s voice made her father and her sister feel that to tease her\nfurther would be impertinent.",
        "Arthur had said he would not call until the next week because then he\nwould be at work again. He went once more to Dr. Schulze’s, but was\ncareful to go in office hours. He did not see Madelene–though she,\nbehind the white sash curtains of her own office, saw him come, watched\nhim go until he was out of sight far down the street. On Monday he went\nto work, really to work. No more shame; no more shirking or shrinking; no\nmore lingering on the irrevocable. He squarely faced the future, and,\nwith his will like his father’s, set dogged and unconquerable energy to\nbattering at the obstacles before him. “All a man needs,” said he to\nhimself, at the end of the first day of real work, “is a purpose. He\nnever knows where he’s at until he gets one. And once he gets it, he\ncan’t rest till he has accomplished it.”",
