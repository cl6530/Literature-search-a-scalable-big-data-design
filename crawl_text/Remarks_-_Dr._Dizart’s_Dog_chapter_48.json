        "A man whose mother-in-law had been successfully treated by the doctor, one\nday presented him with a beautiful Italian hound named Nemesis.",
        "When I say that the able physician had treated the mother-in-law\nsuccessfully, I mean successfully from her son-in-law’s standpoint, and\nnot from her own, for the doctor insisted on treating her for small-pox\nwhen she had nothing but an attack of agnostics. She is now sitting on the\nfront stoop of the golden whence.",
        "So, after the last sad rites, the broken-hearted son-in-law presented the\nphysician with a handsome hound with long, slender legs and a wire tail,\nas a token of esteem and regard.",
        "The dog was young and playful, as all young dogs are, so he did many\nlittle tricks which amused almost everyone.",
        "One day, while the doctor was away administering a subcutaneous injection\nof morphine to a hay-fever patient, he left Nemesis in the office alone\nwith a piece of rag-carpet and his surging thoughts.",
        "At first Nemesis closed his eyes and breathed hard, then he arose and ate\npart of an ottoman, then he got up and scratched the paper off the office\nwall and whined in a sad tone of voice.",
        "A young Italian hound has a peculiarly sad and depressing song.",
        "Then Nemesis got up on the desk and poured the ink and mucilage into one\nof the drawers on some bandages and condition-powders that the doctor used\nin his horse-practice.",
        "Nemesis then looked out of the window and wailed. He filled the room with\nrobust wail and unavailing regret.",
        "After that he tried to dispel his ennui with one of the doctor’s old\nfelt hats that hung on a chair; but the hair oil with which it was\nsaturated changed his mind.",
        "The doctor had magenta hair, and to tone it down so that it would not\nraise the rate of fire insurance on his office, he used to execute some\nstudies on it in oil–bear’s oil.",
        "This gave his hair a rich mahogany shade, and his hat smelled and looked\nlike an oil refinery.",
        "That is the reason Nemesis spared the hat, and ate a couple of\nporousplasters that his master was going to use on a case of croup.",
        "At that time the doctor came in, and the dog ran to him with a glad cry of\npleasure, rubbing his cold nose against his master’s hand. The able\nveterinarian spoke roughly to Nemesis, and throwing a cigar-stub at him,\nbroke two of the animal’s delicate legs.",
        "After that there was a low discordant murmur and the angry hum of medical\nworks, lung-testers, glass jars containing tumors and other bric-a-brac,\npaper-weights and Italian grayhound bisecting the orbit of a redheaded\nhorse-physician with dude shoes.",
        "When the police came in, it was found that Nemesis had jumped through a\nglass door and escaped on two legs and his ear.",
        "Out through the autumnal haze, across the intervening plateau, over the\nlow foot-hills, and up the Medicine Bow Range, on and ever onward sped the\ntimid, grieved and broken-hearted pup, accumulating with wonderful\neagerness the intervening distance between himself and the cruel promoter\nof the fly-blister and lingering death.",
        "How often do we thoughtlessly grieve the hearts of those who love us, and\ndrive forth into the pitiless world those who would gladly lick our hands\nwith their warm loving tongues, or warm their cold noses in the meshes of\nour necks.",
        "How prone we are to forget the devotion of a dumb brute that thoughtlessly\neats our lace lambrequins, and ere we have stopped to consider our mad\ncourse, we have driven the loving heart and the warm wet tongue and the\ncold little black nose out of our home-life, perhaps into the cold, cold\ngrave or the bleak and relentless pound.",
