        "\nI want now to tell you, gentlemen, whether you care to hear it or not, why\nI could not even become an insect.  I tell you solemnly, that I have many\ntimes tried to become an insect.  But I was not equal even to that.  I swear,\ngentlemen, that to be too conscious is an illness—a real thorough-going\nillness.  For man’s everyday needs, it would have been quite enough to\nhave the ordinary human consciousness, that is, half or a quarter of the\namount which falls to the lot of a cultivated man of our unhappy\nnineteenth century, especially one who has the fatal ill-luck to inhabit\nPetersburg, the most theoretical and intentional town on the whole\nterrestrial globe.  (There are intentional and unintentional towns.)  It\nwould have been quite enough, for instance, to have the consciousness\nby which all so-called direct persons and men of action live.  I bet you\nthink I am writing all this from affectation, to be witty at the expense of\nmen of action; and what is more, that from ill-bred affectation, I am\nclanking a sword like my officer.  But, gentlemen, whoever can pride\nhimself on his diseases and even swagger over them?",
        "Though, after all, everyone does do that; people do pride themselves\non their diseases, and I do, may be, more than anyone.  We will not\ndispute it; my contention was absurd.  But yet I am firmly persuaded that\na great deal of consciousness, every sort of consciousness, in fact, is a\ndisease.  I stick to that.  Let us leave that, too, for a minute.  Tell me this:\nwhy does it happen that at the very, yes, at the very moments when I am\nmost capable of feeling every refinement of all that is “sublime and\nbeautiful,” as they used to say at one time, it would, as though of design,\nhappen to me not only to feel but to do such ugly things, such that ...\nWell, in short, actions that all, perhaps, commit; but which, as though\npurposely, occurred to me at the very time when I was most conscious\nthat they ought not to be committed.  The more conscious I was of goodness\nand of all that was “sublime and beautiful,” the more deeply I sank\ninto my mire and the more ready I was to sink in it altogether.  But the\nchief point was that all this was, as it were, not accidental in me, but as\nthough it were bound to be so.  It was as though it were my most normal\ncondition, and not in the least disease or depravity, so that at last all desire\nin me to struggle against this depravity passed.  It ended by my almost\nbelieving (perhaps actually believing) that this was perhaps my normal\ncondition.  But at first, in the beginning, what agonies I endured in that\nstruggle!  I did not believe it was the same with other people, and all my\nlife I hid this fact about myself as a secret.  I was ashamed (even now,\nperhaps, I am ashamed): I got to the point of feeling a sort of secret\nabnormal, despicable enjoyment in returning home to my corner on\nsome disgusting Petersburg night, acutely conscious that that day I had\ncommitted a loathsome action again, that what was done could never be\nundone, and secretly, inwardly gnawing, gnawing at myself for it, tearing\nand consuming myself till at last the bitterness turned into a sort of\nshameful accursed sweetness, and at last—into positive real enjoyment!\nYes, into enjoyment, into enjoyment!  I insist upon that.  I have spoken of\nthis because I keep wanting to know for a fact whether other people feel\nsuch enjoyment?  I will explain; the enjoyment was just from the too\nintense consciousness of one’s own degradation; it was from feeling\noneself that one had reached the last barrier, that it was horrible, but that\nit could not be otherwise; that there was no escape for you; that you never\ncould become a different man; that even if time and faith were still left\nyou to change into something different you would most likely not wish to\nchange; or if you did wish to, even then you would do nothing; because\nperhaps in reality there was nothing for you to change into.",
        "And the worst of it was, and the root of it all, that it was all in accord\nwith the normal fundamental laws of over-acute consciousness, and\nwith the inertia that was the direct result of those laws, and that\nconsequently one was not only unable to change but could do absolutely\nnothing.  Thus it would follow, as the result of acute consciousness,\nthat one is not to blame in being a scoundrel; as though that were\nany consolation to the scoundrel once he has come to realise that he\nactually is a scoundrel.  But enough. ...  Ech, I have talked a lot of\nnonsense, but what have I explained?  How is enjoyment in this to be\nexplained?  But I will explain it.  I will get to the bottom of it!  That is why\nI have taken up my pen. ...",
        "I, for instance, have a great deal of AMOUR PROPRE.  I am as suspicious\nand prone to take offence as a humpback or a dwarf.  But upon my word I\nsometimes have had moments when if I had happened to be slapped in\nthe face I should, perhaps, have been positively glad of it.  I say, in\nearnest, that I should probably have been able to discover even in that a\npeculiar sort of enjoyment—the enjoyment, of course, of despair; but in\ndespair there are the most intense enjoyments, especially when one is\nvery acutely conscious of the hopelessness of one’s position.  And when\none is slapped in the face—why then the consciousness of being rubbed\ninto a pulp would positively overwhelm one.  The worst of it is, look at it\nwhich way one will, it still turns out that I was always the most to blame\nin everything.  And what is most humiliating of all, to blame for no fault\nof my own but, so to say, through the laws of nature.  In the first place, to\nblame because I am cleverer than any of the people surrounding me.  (I\nhave always considered myself cleverer than any of the people surrounding\nme, and sometimes, would you believe it, have been positively\nashamed of it.  At any rate, I have all my life, as it were, turned my eyes\naway and never could look people straight in the face.)  To blame, finally,\nbecause even if I had had magnanimity, I should only have had more\nsuffering from the sense of its uselessness.  I should certainly have never\nbeen able to do anything from being magnanimous—neither to forgive,\nfor my assailant would perhaps have slapped me from the laws of nature,\nand one cannot forgive the laws of nature; nor to forget, for even if it were\nowing to the laws of nature, it is insulting all the same.  Finally, even if I\nhad wanted to be anything but magnanimous, had desired on the\ncontrary to revenge myself on my assailant, I could not have revenged\nmyself on any one for anything because I should certainly never have\nmade up my mind to do anything, even if I had been able to.  Why\nshould I not have made up my mind?  About that in particular I want to\nsay a few words.",
