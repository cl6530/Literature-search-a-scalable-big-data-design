        "“The curfew tolls the knell of parting day” has immortalised the\notherwise unimportant district of Stoke Poges–a parish embracing\nnumerous small hamlets.",
        "Leaving Slough by the north end of the railway bridge, one turns first\nto the right and then to the left, and soon after leaving the\nuninteresting bricks and mortar of the town, one enters some of the most\nbeautiful lanes in the home counties. At the first cross road one turns\nto the right, and again through an open gate to the left, and thence a\nfield path leads to the churchyard.",
        "The little church, which is always open, has walls of old red brick and\nflint, with patches of rough plaster. It is wonderfully picturesque,\nwith its partial covering of ivy and beautiful background of fine old\ntrees, and no one can view the scene at sunset without recalling Gray’s\nimmortal Elegy written in a Country Churchyard–those exquisite verses\nwhich breathe in every line the peace of an ideal country scene. To a\nlover of Nature there can be nothing more beautiful than the lines–",
        "  Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,\n  And all the air a solemn stillness holds;\n  Save where the beetle wheels his drony flight,\n  And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds.",
        "Near the east wall of the church is the red brick tomb where Gray sleeps\nhis last sleep, and in the meadow by the chancel window stands the huge\ncenotaph raised to his memory by John Penn. Of the little cottage where\nhe spent his summer vacations and wrote the Elegy nothing now remains.\nGray was born in London in 1716, and died at Cambridge in 1771.",
        "The interior of the church has lost its high old pews and galleries, so\nthat it lacks the interest it might have had, for until these were\nremoved the building was almost exactly what Gray knew so well.",
