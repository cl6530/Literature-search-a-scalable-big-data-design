        "[27] History of the Conflict between Religion and Science. by\nJohn William Draper, M. D., LL. D. Fourth edition. New York: D.\nAppleton & Co. 1875. 12mo, pp. xxii., 373. (International\nScientific Series, XII.)",
        "Some twelve years ago, Dr. Draper published a bulky volume\nentitled “A History of the Intellectual Development of Europe,\"\nin which his professed purpose was to show that nations or races\npass through certain definable epochs of development, analogous\nto the periods of infancy, childhood, youth, manhood, and old age\nin individuals. But while announced with due formality, the\ncarrying out of the argument was left for the most part to the\nheadings and running-titles of the several chapters, while in the\ntext the author peacefully meandered along down the stream of\ntime, giving us a succession of pleasant though somewhat\nthreadbare anecdotes, as well as a superabundance of detached and\nfragmentary opinions on divers historical events, having\napparently quite forgotten that he had started with a thesis to\nprove. In the arrangement of his “running heads,” some points\nwere sufficiently curious to require a word of explanation, as,\nfor example, when the early ages of Christianity were at one time\nlabelled as an epoch of progress and at another time as an epoch\nof decrepitude. But the argument and the contents never got so\nfar en rapport with each other as to clear up such points as\nthis. On the contrary, each kept on the even tenour of its way\nwithout much regard to the other. From the titles of the chapters\none was led to expect some comprehensive theory of European\ncivilization continuously expounded. But the text merely showed a\ngreat quantity of superficial and second-hand information,\nserving to illustrate the mental idiosyncrasies of the author.\nAmong these idiosyncrasies might be noted a very inadequate\nunderstanding of the part played by Rome in the work of\ncivilization, a singular lack of appreciation of the political\nand philosophical achievements of Greece under Athenian\nleadership, a strong hostility to the Catholic Church, a curious\ndisposition to overrate semi-barbarous. or abortive\ncivilizations, such as those of the old Asiatic and native\nAmerican communities, at the expense of Europe, and, above all,\nan undiscriminating admiration for everything, great or small,\nthat has ever worn the garb of Islam or been associated with the\ncareer of the Saracens. The discovery that in some respects the\nMussulmans of the Middle Ages were more highly cultivated than\ntheir Christian contemporaries, has made such an impression on\nDr. Draper’s mind that it seems to be as hard for him to get rid\nof it as it was for Mr. Dick to keep the execution of Charles I.\nout of his “Memorial.” Even in an essay on the “Civil Policy of\nAmerica,” the turbaned sage figures quite prominently; and it is\nneedless to add that he reappears, as large as life, when the\nsubject of discussion is the attitude of science toward religion.",
        "Speaking briefly with regard to this matter, we may freely admit\nthat the work done by the Arabs, in scientific inquiry as well as\nin the making of events, was very considerable. It was a work,\ntoo, the value of which is not commonly appreciated in the\naccounts of European history written for the general reader, and\nwe have no disposition to find fault with Dr. Draper for\ndescribing it with enthusiasm. The philosophers of Bagdad and\nCordova did excellent service in keeping alive the traditions of\nGreek physical inquiry at a time when Christian thinkers were too\nexclusively occupied with transcendental speculations in theology\nand logic. In some departments, as in chemistry and astronomy,\nthey made original discoveries of considerable value; and if we\nturn from abstract knowledge to the arts of life, it cannot be\ndenied that the mediaeval Mussulmans had reached a higher plane\nof material comfort than their Christian contemporaries. In\nshort, the work of all kinds done by these people would furnish\nthe judicious advocate of the claims of the Semitic race with\nmaterials for a pleasing and instructive picture. Dr. Draper,\nhowever, errs, though no doubt unintentionally, by so presenting\nthe case as to leave upon the reader’s mind the impression that\nall this scientific and practical achievement was the work of\nIslamism, and that the Mohammedan civilization was of a higher\ntype than the Christian. It is with an apparent feeling of regret\nthat he looks upon the ousting of the Moors from dominion in\nSpain; but this is a mistaken view. As regards the first point,\nit is a patent fact that scientific inquiry was conducted at the\ncost of as much theological obloquy in the Mohammedan as in the\nChristian world. It is true there was more actual tolerance of\nheresy on the part of Moslem governments than was customary in\nEurope in those days; but this is a superficial fact, which does\nnot indicate any superiority in Moslem popular sentiment. The\ncaliphate or emirate was a truly absolute despotism, such as the\nPapacy has never been, and the conduct of a sceptical emir in\nencouraging scientific inquiry goes but little way toward proving\nanything like a general prevalence of tolerance or of\nfree-thinking. And this brings us to the second point,—that\nMohammedan civilization was, on the whole, rather a skin-deep\naffair. It was superficial because of that extreme severance\nbetween government and people which has never existed in European\nnations within historic times, but which has always existed among\nthe principal races that have professed Moslemism. Nowhere in the\nMohammedan world has there ever been what we call a national\nlife, and nowhere do we find in its records any trace of such an\nintellectual impulse, thrilling through every fibre of the people\nand begetting prodigious achievements in art, poetry, and\nphilosophy, as was awakened in Europe in the thirteenth century\nand again in the fifteenth. Under the peculiar form of unlimited\nmaterial and spiritual despotism exemplified in the caliphate, a\nfew men may discover gases or comment on Aristotle, but no\ngeneral movement toward political progress or philosophical\ninquiry is possible. Such a society is rigid and inorganic at\nbottom, whatever scanty signs of flexibility and life it may show\nat the surface. There is no better illustration of this, when\nwell considered, than the fact that Moorish civilization\nremained, politically and intellectually, a mere excrescence in\nSpain, after having been fastened down over half the country for\nnearly eight centuries.",
        "But we are in danger of forgetting our main theme, as Dr. Draper\nseems to do, while we linger with him over these interesting\nwayside topics. We may perhaps be excused, however, if we have\nnot yet made any very explicit allusion to the “Conflict between\nReligion and Science,” because this work seems to be in the main\na repetition en petit of the “Intellectual Development of\nEurope,” and what we have said will apply as well to one as to\nthe other. In the little book, as in the big one, we hear a great\ndeal about the Arabs, and something about Columbus and Galileo,\nwho made men accept sundry truths in the teeth of clerical\nopposition; and, as before, we float gently down the current of\nhistory without being over well-informed as to the precise\ndidactic purpose of our voyage. Here, indeed, even our headings\nand running-titles do not materially help us, for though we are\nsupposed to be witnessing, or mayhap assisting in, a perennial\nconflict between “science” and “religion,” we are nowhere\nenlightened as to what the cause or character of this conflict\nis, nor are we enabled to get a good look at either of the\nparties to the strife. With regard to it “religion” especially\nare we left in the dark. What this dreadful thing is towards\nwhich “science” is always playing the part of Herakles towards\nthe Lernaean Hydra, we are left to gather from the course of the\nnarrative. Yet, in a book with any valid claim to\nclearsightedness, one would think such a point as this ought to\nreceive very explicit preliminary treatment.",
        "The course of the narrative, however, leaves us in little doubt\nas to what Dr. Draper means by a conflict between science and\nreligion. When he enlarges on the trite story of Galileo, and\nalludes to the more modern quarrel between the Church and the\ngeologists, and does this in the belief that he is thereby\nillustrating an antagonism between religion and science, it is\nobvious that he identifies the cause of the anti-geologists and\nthe persecutors of Galileo with the cause of religion. The word\n“religion” is to him a symbol which stands for unenlightened\nbigotry or narrow-minded unwillingness to look facts in the face.\nSuch a conception of religion is common enough, and unhappily a\ngreat deal has been done to strengthen it by the very persons to\nwhom the interests of religion are presumed to be a professional\ncare. It is nevertheless a very superficial conception, and no\nbook which is vitiated by it can have much philosophic value. It\nis simply the crude impression which, in minds unaccustomed to\nanalysis, is left by the fact that theologians and other persons\ninterested in religion are usually alarmed at new scientific\ntruths, and resist them with emotions so highly wrought that they\nare not only incapable of estimating evidence, but often also\nhave their moral sense impaired, and fight with foul means when\nfair ones fail. If we reflect carefully on this class of\nphenomena, we shall see that something besides mere pride of\nopinion is involved in the struggle. At the bottom of changing\ntheological beliefs there lies something which men perennially\nvalue, and for the sake of which they cling to the beliefs as\nlong as possible. That which they value is not itself a matter of\nbelief, but it is a matter of conduct; it is the searching after\ngoodness,—after a higher life than the mere satisfaction of\nindividual desires. All animals seek for fulness of life; but in\ncivilized man this craving has acquired a moral significance, and\nhas become a spiritual aspiration; and this emotional tendency,\nmore or less strong in the human race, we call religious feeling\nor religion. Viewed in this light, religion is not only something\nthat mankind is never likely to get rid of, but it is\nincomparably the most noble as well as the most useful attribute\nof humanity.",
        "Now, this emotional prompting toward completeness of life\nrequires, of course, that conduct should be guided, as far as\npossible, in accordance with a true theory of the relations of\nman to the world in which he lives. Hence, at any given era the\nreligious feeling will always be found enlisted in behalf of some\ntheory of the universe. At any time, whatever may be their\nshortcomings in practice, religious men will aim at doing right\naccording to their conceptions of the order of the world. If\nmen’s conceptions of the order of nature remained constant, no\napparent conflict between their religious feelings and their\nknowledge need ever arise. But with the first advance in our\nknowledge of nature the case is altered. New and strange theories\nare naturally regarded with fear and dislike by persons who have\nalways been accustomed to find the sanction and justification of\ntheir emotional prompting toward righteousness in old familiar\ntheories which the new ones are seeking to supplant. Such persons\noppose the new doctrine because their engrained mental habits\ncompel them to believe that its establishment will in some way\nlower men’s standard of life, and make them less careful of their\nspiritual welfare. This is the case, at all events, when\ntheologians oppose scientific conclusions on religious grounds,\nand not simply from mental dulness or rigidity. And, in so far as\nit is religious feeling which thus prompts resistance to\nscientific innovation, it may be said, with some appearance of\ntruth, that there is a conflict between religion and science.",
        "But there must always be two parties to a quarrel, and our\nstatement has to be modified as soon as we consider what the\nscientific innovator impugns. It is not the emotional prompting\ntoward righteousness, it is not the yearning to live im Guten,\nGanzen, Wahren, that he seeks to weaken; quite likely he has all\nthis as much at heart as the theologian who vituperates him. Nor\nis it true that his discoveries, in spite of him, tend to destroy\nthis all-important mental attitude. It would be ridiculous to say\nthat the fate of religious feeling is really involved in the fate\nof grotesque cosmogonies and theosophies framed in the infancy of\nmen’s knowledge of nature; for history shows us quite the\ncontrary. Religious feeling has survived the heliocentric theory\nand the discoveries of geologists; and it will be none the worse\nfor the establishment of Darwinism. It is the merest truism to\nsay that religion strikes its roots deeper down into human nature\nthan speculative opinion, and is accordingly independent of any\nparticular set of beliefs. Since, then, the scientific innovator\ndoes not, either voluntarily or involuntarily, attack religion,\nit follows that there can be no such “conflict” as that of which\nDr. Draper has undertaken to write the history. The real contest\nis between one phase of science and another; between the\nmore-crude knowledge of yesterday and the less-crude knowledge of\nto-day. The contest, indeed, as presented in history, is simply\nthe measure of the difficulty which men find in exchanging old\nviews for new ones. All along, the practical question has been,\nwhether we should passively acquiesce in the crude\ngeneralizations of our ancestors or venture actively to revise\nthem. But as for the religious sentiment, the perennial struggle\nin which it has been engaged has not been with scientific\ninquiry, but with the selfish propensities whose tendency is to\nmake men lead the lives of brutes.",
        "The time is at hand when the interests of religion can no longer\nbe supposed to be subserved by obstinate adherence to crude\nspeculations bequeathed to us from pre-scientific antiquity. One\ngood result of the doctrine of evolution, which is now gaining\nsway in all departments of thought, is the lesson that all our\nopinions must be held subject to continual revision, and that\nwith none of them can our religious interests be regarded as\nirretrievably implicated. To any one who has once learned this\nlesson, a book like Dr. Draper’s can be neither interesting nor\nuseful. He who has not learned it can derive little benefit from\na work which in its very title keeps open an old and baneful\nsource of error and confusion.",
