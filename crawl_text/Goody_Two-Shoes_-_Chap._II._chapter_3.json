        " How and about Mr. Smith.",
        "Mr. Smith was a very worthy Clergyman, who lived in the Parish\nwhere Little Margery and Tommy were born; and having a\nRelation come to see him, who was a charitable good Man, he sent for\nthese Children to him. The Gentleman ordered Little Margery a\nnew Pair of Shoes, gave Mr. Smith some Money to buy her\nCloathes; and said, he would take Tommy and make him a little\nSailor; and accordingly had a Jacket and Trowsers made for him, in\nwhich he now appears. Pray look at him.",
        "After some Days the Gentleman intended to go to London, and\ntake little Tommy with him, of whom you will know more by and\nby, for we shall at a proper Time present you with some Part of his\nHistory, his Travels and Adventures.",
        "The Parting between these two little Children was very affecting,\nTommy cried, and Margery cried, and they kissed each\nother an hundred Times. At last Tommy thus wiped off her Tears\nwith the End of his Jacket, and bid her cry no more, for that he would\ncome to her again, when he returned from Sea. However, as they were so\nvery fond, the Gentleman would not suffer them to take Leave of each\nother; but told Tommy he should ride out with him, and come\nback at Night. When night came, Little Margery grew very uneasy\nabout her Brother, and after sitting up as late as Mr. Smithwould let her, she went crying to Bed.",
