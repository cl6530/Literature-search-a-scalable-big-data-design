        "    Kalirian and Spanish Piyutim (Poems).–Jannai.–Kalir.",
        "Arabic to a large extent replaced Hebrew as the literary language of the\nJews, but Hebrew continued the language of prayer. As a mere literary\nform, Rabbinic Hebrew retained a strong hold on the Jews; as a vehicle\nof devotional feeling, Hebrew reigned supreme. The earliest additions to\nthe fixed liturgy of the Synagogue were prose-poems. They were\n“Occasional Prayers” composed by the precentor for a special occasion.\nAn appropriate melody or chant accompanied the new hymn, and if the poem\nand melody met the popular taste, both won a permanent place in the\nlocal liturgy. The hymns were unrhymed and unmetrical, but they may have\nbeen written in the form of alphabetical acrostics, such as appear in\nthe 119th and a few other Psalms.",
        "It is not impossible that metre and rhyme grew naturally from the\nBiblical Hebrew. Rhyme is unknown in the Bible, but the assonances which\noccur may easily run into rhymes. Musical form is certainly present in\nHebrew poetry, though strict metres are foreign to it. As an historical\nfact, however, Hebrew rhymed verse can be traced on the one side to\nSyriac, on the other to Arabic influences. In the latter case the\ninfluence was external only. Early Arabic poetry treats of war and love,\nbut the first Jewish rhymsters sang of peace and duty. The Arab wrote\nfor the camp, the Jew for the synagogue.",
        "Two distinct types of verse, or Piyut (i.e. Poetry), arose within the\nJewish circle: the ingenious and the natural. In the former, the style\nis rugged and involved; a profusion of rare words and obscure allusions\nmeets and troubles the reader; the verse lacks all beauty of form, yet\nis alive with intense spiritual force. This style is often termed\nKalirian, from the name of its best representative. The Kalirian Piyut\nin the end spread chiefly to France, England, Burgundy, Lorraine,\nGermany, Bohemia, Poland, Italy, Greece, and Palestine. The other type\nof new-Hebrew Piyut, the Spanish, rises to higher beauties of form. It\nis not free from the Kalirian faults, but it has them in a less\npronounced degree. The Spanish Piyut, in the hands of one or two\nmasters, becomes true poetry, poetry in form as well as in idea. The\nSpanish style prevailed in Castile, Andalusia, Catalonia, Aragon,\nMajorca, Provence, and in countries where Arabic influence was\nstrongest.",
        "Kalir was the most popular writer of the earlier type of new-Hebrew\npoetry, but he was not its creator. An older contemporary of his, from\nwhom he derived both his diction and his method of treating poetic\nsubjects, was Jannai. Though we know that Jannai was a prolific writer,\nonly seven short examples of his verse remain. One of these is the\npopular hymn, “It was at Midnight,” which is still recited by “German\"\nJews at the home-service on the first eve of Passover. It recounts in\norder the deliverances which, according to the Midrash, were wrought for\nIsrael at midnight, from Abraham’s victory over the four kings to the\nwakefulness of Ahasuerus, the crisis of the Book of Esther. In the last\nstanza is a prayer for future redemption:",
        "    Bring nigh the hour which is nor day nor night!\n    Most High! make known that thine is day, and\n         thine the night!\n    Make clear as day the darkness of our night!\n        As of old at midnight.",
        "This form of versification, with a running refrain, afterwards became\nvery popular with Jewish poets. Jannai also displays the harsh\nalliterations, the learned allusions to Midrash and Talmud, which were\ncarried to extremes by Kalir.",
        "It is strange that it is impossible to fix with any certainty the date\nat which Jannai and Kalir lived. Kalir may belong to the eighth or to\nthe ninth century. It is equally hard to decide as to his birth-place.\nRival theories hold that he was born in Palestine and in Sardinia. His\nname has been derived from Cagliari in Sardinia and from the Latin\ncalyrum, a cake. Honey-cakes were given to Jewish children on their\nfirst introduction to school, and the nickname “Kaliri,” or “Boy of the\nCake,” may have arisen from his youthful precocity. But all this is mere\nguess-work.",
        "It is more certain that the poet was also the singer of his own verses.\nHis earliest audiences were probably scholars, and this may have tempted\nKalir to indulge in the recondite learning which vitiates his hymns. At\nhis worst, Kalir is very bad indeed; his style is then a jumble of\nwords, his meaning obscure and even unintelligible. He uses a maze of\nalphabetical acrostics, line by line he wreathes into his compositions\nthe words of successive Bible texts. Yet even at his worst he is\ningenious and vigorous. Such phrases as “to hawk it as a hawk upon a\nsparrow” are at least bold and effective. Ibn Ezra later on lamented\nthat Kalir had treated the Hebrew language like an unfenced city. But if\nthe poet too freely admitted strange and ugly words, he added many of\nconsiderable force and beauty. Kalir rightly felt that if Hebrew was to\nremain a living tongue, it was absurd to restrict the language to the\nvocabulary of the Bible. Hence he invented many new verbs from nouns.",
        "But his inventiveness was less marked than his learning. “With the\npermission of God, I will speak in riddles,” says Kalir in opening the\nprayer for dew. The riddles are mainly clever allusions to the Midrash.\nIt has been pointed out that these allusions are often tasteless and\nobscure. But they are more often beautiful and inspiring. No Hebrew\npoet in the Middle Ages was illiterate, for the poetic instinct was fed\non the fancies of the Midrash. This accounts for their lack of freshness\nand originality. The poet was a scholar, and he was also a teacher. Much\nof Kalir’s work is didactic; it teaches the traditional explanations of\nthe Bible and the ritual laws for Sabbath and festivals; it provides a\nconvenient summary of the six hundred and thirteen precepts into which\nthe duties of the Law were arranged. But over and above all this the\ngenius of Kalir soars to poetic heights. So much has been said of\nKalir’s obscurity that one quotation must, in fairness be given of Kalir\nat his simplest and best. The passage is taken from a hymn sung on the\nseventh day of Tabernacles, the day of the great Hosannas:",
        "    O give ear to the prayer of those who long for thy\n         salvation,\n    Rejoicing before thee with the willows of the brook,\n              And save us now!",
        "    O redeem the vineyard which thou hast planted,\n    And sweep thence the strangers, and save us now!\n    O regard the covenant which thou hast sealed in us!\n    O remember for us the father who knew thee,\n    To whom thou, too, didst make known thy love,\n              And save us now!",
        "    O deal wondrously with the pure in heart\n    That thy providence may be seen of men, and save us now!\n    O lift up Zion’s sunken gates from the earth,\n    Exalt the spot to which our eyes all turn,\n              And save us now!",
        "Such hymns won for Kalir popularity, which, however, is now much on the\nwane.",

        "     Translation of the Bible into Arabic.–Foundation of a Jewish\n     Philosophy of Religion.",
        "Saadiah was born in Fayum (Egypt) in 892, and died in Sura in 942. He\nwas the founder of a new literature. In width of culture he excelled all\nhis Jewish contemporaries. To him Judaism was synonymous with culture,\nand therefore he endeavored to absorb for Judaism all the literary and\nscientific tendencies of his day. He created, in the first place, a\nJewish philosophy, that is to say, he applied to Jewish theology the\nphilosophical methods of the Arabs. Again, though he vigorously opposed\nKaraism, he adopted its love of philology, and by his translation of the\nBible into Arabic helped forward a sounder understanding of the\nScriptures.",
        "At the age of thirty-six Saadiah received a remarkable honor; he was\nsummoned to Sura to fill the post of Gaon. This election of a foreigner\nas head of the Babylonian school proves, first, that Babylonia had lost\nits old supremacy, and, secondly, that Saadiah had already won\nworld-wide fame. Yet the great work on which his reputation now rests\nwas not then written. Saadiah’s notoriety was due to his successful\nchampionship of Rabbinism against the Karaites. His determination, his\nlearning, his originality, were all discernible in his early treatises\nagainst Anan and his followers. The Rabbinites had previously opposed\nKaraism in a guerilla warfare. Saadiah came into the open, and met and\nvanquished the foe in pitched battles. But he did more than defeat the\ninvader, he strengthened the home defences. Saadiah’s polemical works\nhave always a positive as well as a negative value. He wished to prove\nKaraism wrong, but he also tried to show that Rabbinism was right.",
        "As a champion of Rabbinism, then, Saadiah was called to Sura. But he had\nanother claim to distinction. The Karaites founded their position on the\nBible. Saadiah resolved that the appeal to the Bible should not be\nrestricted to scholars. He translated the Scriptures into Arabic, and\nadded notes. Saadiah’s qualifications for the task were his knowledge of\nHebrew, his fine critical sense, and his enlightened attitude towards\nthe Midrash. As to the first qualification, it is said that at the age\nof eleven he had begun a Hebrew rhyming dictionary for the use of poets.\nHe himself added several hymns to the liturgy. In these Saadiah’s\npoetical range is very varied. Sometimes his style is as pure and simple\nas the most classical poems of the Spanish school. At other times, his\nverses have all the intricacy, harshness, and artificiality of Kalir’s.\nPerhaps his mastery of Hebrew is best seen in his “Book of the Exiled\"\n(Sefer ha-Galui), compiled in Biblical Hebrew, divided into verses,\nand provided with accents. As the title indicates, this book was written\nduring Saadiah’s exile from Sura.",
        "Saadiah’s Arabic version of the Scriptures won such favor that it was\nread publicly in the synagogues. Of old the Targum, or Aramaic version,\nhad been read in public worship together with the original Hebrew. Now,\nhowever, the Arabic began to replace the Targum. Saadiah’s version well\ndeserved its honor.",
        "Saadiah brought a hornet’s nest about his head by his renewed attacks on\nKaraism, contained in his commentary to Genesis. But the call to Sura\nturned Saadiah’s thoughts in another direction. He found the famous\ncollege in decay. The Exilarchs, the nominal heads of the whole of the\nBabylonian Jews, were often unworthy of their position, and it was not\nlong before Saadiah came into conflict with the Exilarch. The struggle\nended in the Gaon’s exile from Sura. During his years of banishment, he\nproduced his greatest works. He arranged a prayer-book, wrote Talmudical\nessays, compiled rules for the calendar, examined the Massoretic works\nof various authors, and, indeed, produced a vast array of books, all of\nthem influential and meritorious. But his most memorable writings were\nhis “Commentary on the Book of Creation” (Sefer Yetsirah) and his\nmasterpiece, “Faith and Philosophy” (Emunoth ve-Deoth).",
        "This treatise, finished in the year 934, was the first systematic\nattempt to bring revealed religion into harmony with Greek philosophy.\nSaadiah was thus the forerunner, not only of Maimonides, but also of the\nChristian school-men. No Jew, said Saadiah, should discard the Bible,\nand form his opinions solely by his own reasoning. But he might safely\nendeavor to prove, independently of revelation, the truths which\nrevelation had given. Faith, said Saadiah again, is the sours absorption\nof the essence of a truth, which thus becomes part of itself, and will\nbe the motive of conduct whenever the occasion arises. Thus Saadiah\nidentified reason with faith. He ridiculed the fear that philosophy\nleads to scepticism. You might as well, he argued, identify astronomy\nwith superstition, because some deluded people believe that an eclipse\nof the moon is caused by a dragon’s making a meal of it.",
        "For the last few years of his life Saadiah was reinstated in the Gaonate\nat Sura. The school enjoyed a new lease of fame under the brilliant\ndirection of the author of the great work just described. After his\ndeath the inevitable decay made itself felt. Under the Moorish caliphs,\nSpain had become a centre of Arabic science, art, and poetry. In the\ntenth century, Cordova attained fame similar to that which Athens and\nAlexandria had once reached. In Moorish Spain, there was room both for\nearnest piety and the sensuous delights of music and art; and the keen\nexercise of the intellect in science or philosophy did not debar the\npossession of practical statesmanship and skill in affairs. In the\nservice of the caliphs were politicians who were also doctors, poets,\nphilosophers, men of science. Possession of culture was, indeed, a sure\ncredential for employment by the state. It was to Moorish Spain that the\ncentre of Judaism shifted after the death of Saadiah. It was in Spain\nthat the finest fruit of Jewish literature in the post-Biblical period\ngrew. Here the Jewish genius expanded beneath the sunshine of Moorish\nculture. To Moses, the son of Chanoch, an envoy from Babylonia, belongs\nthe honor of founding a new school in Cordova. In this he had the\nsupport of the scholar-statesman Chasdai, the first of a long line of\nmedieval Jews who earned double fame, as servants of their country and\nas servants of their own religion. To Chasdai we must now turn.",
