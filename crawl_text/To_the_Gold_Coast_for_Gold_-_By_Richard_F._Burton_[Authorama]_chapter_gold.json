        "Shakespeare",
        "The following extract from ’Wanderings in West Africa,’ a book which I\nwrote in 1862 and published (anonymously) in 1863, will best explain the\nreasons which lately sent me to Western Africa:–",
        "In several countries, for instance, Dinkira, Tueful, Wásá (Wassaw), and\nespecially Akim, the hill-region lying north of Accra, the people are\nstill active in digging gold. The pits, varying from two to three feet\nin diameter, and from twelve to fifty deep (eighty feet is the extreme),\nare often so near the roads that loss of life has been the\nresult. ’Shoring up’ being little known, the miners are not unfrequently\nburied alive. The stuff is drawn up by ropes in clay pots, or\ncalabashes, and thus a workman at the bottom widens the pit to a\npyriform shape; tunnelling, however, is unknown. The excavated earth is\ncarried down to be washed. Besides sinking these holes, they pan in the\nbeds of rivers, and in places collect quartz, which is roughly pounded.",
        "They (the natives) often refuse to dig deeper than the chin, for fear of\nthe earth ’caving in;’ and, quartz-crushing and the use of quicksilver\nbeing unknown, they will not wash unless the gold ’show colour’ to the\nnaked eye.",
        "As we advance northwards from the Gold Coast the yield becomes\nricher....",
        "It is becoming evident that Africa will one day equal half-a-dozen\nCalifornias....",
        "Will our grandsons believe in these times ... that this Ophir–that\nthis California, where every river is a Tmolus and a Pactolus, every\nhillock is a gold-field–does not contain a cradle, a puddling-machine,\na quartz-crusher, a pound of mercury? That half the washings are wasted\nbecause quicksilver is unknown? That whilst convict labour is\nattainable, not a company has been formed, not a surveyor has been sent\nout? I exclaim with Dominie Sampson–’Pro-di-gious!’",
        "Western Africa was the first field that supplied the precious metal to\nmediaeval Europe. The French claim to have imported it from Elmina as\nearly as A.D. 1382. In 1442 Gonçales Baldeza returned from his second\nvoyage to the regions about Bojador, bringing with him the first gold.\nPresently a company was formed for the purpose of carrying on the\ngold-trade between Portugal and Africa. Its leading men were the\nnavigators Lanzarote and Gilianez, and Prince Henry ’the Navigator’ did\nnot disdain to become a member. In 1471 João de Santarem and Pedro\nEscobar reached a place on the Gold Coast to which, from the abundance\nof gold found there, they gave the name of ’São Jorje da Mina,’ the\npresent Elmina. After this a flood of gold poured into the lap of\nEurope; and at last, cupidity having mastered terror of the Papal Bull,\nwhich assigned to Portugal an exclusive right to the Eastern Hemisphere,\nEnglish, French, and Dutch adventurers hastened to share the spoils.",
        "For long years my words fell upon flat ears. Presently the Ashanti war\nof 1873-74 brought the subject before the public. The Protectorate was\noverrun by British officers, and their reports and itineraries never\nfailed to contain, with a marvellous unanimity of iteration, the magic\nword–Gold.",
        "The fraction of country, twenty-six miles of seaboard out of two\nhundred, by a depth of sixty–in fact, the valley of the Ancobra\nRiver–now (early 1882) contains five working companies. Upwards of\nseventy concessions, to my knowledge, have been obtained from native\nowners, and many more are spoken of. In fact, development has at length\nbegun, and the line of progress is clearly traced.",
        "At Madeira I was joined (January 8, 1882) by Captain Cameron, R.N.,\nC.B., &c. Our object was to explore the so-called Kong Mountains, which\nof late years have become quasi-mythical. He came out admirably\nequipped; nor was I less prepared. But inevitable business had delayed\nus both, and we landed on the Gold Coast at the end of January instead\nof early October. The hot-dry season had set in with a heat and a\ndrought unknown for years; the climate was exceptionally trying, and all\nexperts predicted early and violent rains. Finally, we found so much to\ndo upon the Ancobra River that we had no time for exploration. Geography\nis good, but Gold is better.",
        "In this joint book my energetic and hard-working friend and\nfellow-traveller has described the five working mines which I was unable\nto visit. He has also made an excellent route-survey of the country,\ncorrected by many and careful astronomical observations. It is curious\nto compare his work with the sketches of previous observers, Jeekel,\nWyatt, Bonnat, and Dahse. To my companion’s industry also are mainly due\nour collections of natural history.",
        "We are answerable only for our own, not for each other’s statements. As\nregards my part, I have described the Gold-land as minutely as possible,\ndespite the many and obvious disadvantages of the ’photographic style.’\nIndeed, we travellers often find ourselves in a serious dilemma. If we\ndo not draw our landscapes somewhat in pre-Raphaelite fashion, they do\nnot impress the reader; if we do, critics tell us that they are\nwearisome longueurs, and that the half would be better than the\nwhole. The latter alternative must often be risked, especially in\nwriting about a country where many at home have friends and\nrelatives. Of course they desire to have as much detail about it as\npossible; hence the reader will probably pardon my ’curiosity.’",
        "The Appendix discusses at some length the various objections made to the\nGold Coast mines by the public, which suffers equally from the ’bull’\nand the ’bear’ and from the wild rumours set afloat by those not\ninterested in the speculation. I first dispose of the dangers menaced by\nAshanti invasions. The second number notices the threatened\nlabour-famine, and shows how immigration of Chinese, of coolies, and of\nZanzibar-men will, when wanted, supply not only the Gold Coast, but also\nthe whole of our unhappy West African stations, miscalled colonies,\nwhich are now starving for lack of hands. The third briefly sketches the\nhistory of the Gold-trade in the north-western section of the Dark\nContinent, discusses the position and the connections of the auriferous\nKong Mountains, and suggests the easiest system of ’getting’ the\nprecious metal. This is by shallow working, by washing, and by the\n’hydraulicking’ which I had studied in California. The earlier miners\nhave, it is believed, begun at the wrong end with deep workings, shafts,\nand tunnels; with quartz-crushers, stamps, and heavy and expensive\nmachinery, when flumes and force-pumps would have cost less and brought\nmore. Our observations and deductions, drawn from a section of coast,\nwill apply if true, as I believe they are, to the whole region between\nthe Assini and the Volta Rivers.",
        "I went to the Gold Coast with small expectations. I found the Wásá\n(Wassaw) country, Ancobra section, far richer than the most glowing\ndescriptions had represented it. Gold and other metals are there in\nabundance, and there are good signs of diamond, ruby, and sapphire.",
        "Remains to be seen if England has still honesty and public spirit enough\nto work this old-new California as it should be worked. I will answer\nfor its success if the workers will avoid over-exclusiveness, undue\njealousy and rivalry, stockjobbing, and the rings of ’guinea-pigs’ and\n’guinea-worms.’",
        "Richard F. Burton",
        "PRELIMINARY: TRIESTE TO LISBON.",
        "The glory of an explorer, I need hardly say, results not so much from\nthe extent, or the marvels of his explorations, as from the consequences\nto which they lead.  Judged by this test, my little list of discoveries\nhas not been unfavoured of fortune. Where two purblind fever-stricken\nmen plodded painfully through fetid swamp and fiery thorn-bush over the\nZanzibar-Tanganyika track, mission-houses and schools may now be\nnumbered by the dozen. Missionaries bring consuls, and consuls bring\ncommerce and colonisation. On the Gold Coast of Western Africa, whence\ncame the good old ’guinea,’ not a washing-cradle, not a pound of\nquicksilver was to be found in 1862; in 1882 five mining companies are\nat work; and in 1892 there will be as many score.",
        "I had long and curiously watched from afar the movement of the Golden\nLand, our long-neglected El Dorado, before the opportunity of a revisit\npresented itself. At last, in the autumn of 1881, Mr. James Irvine, of\nLiverpool, formerly of the West African ’Oil-rivers,’ and now a large\nmine-owner in the Gulf of Guinea, proposed to me a tour with the object\nof inspecting his concessions, and I proposed to myself a journey of\nexploration inland. The Foreign Office liberally gave me leave to escape\nthe winter of Trieste, where the ferocious Bora (nor’-nor’-easter) wages\neternal war with the depressing and distressing Scirocco, or\nsouth-easter. Some One marvelled aloud and said, ’You are certainly the\nfirst that ever applied to seek health in the “genial and congenial\nclimate” of the West African Coast.’ But then Some One had not realised\nthe horrors of January and February at the storm-beaten head of the ever\nunquiet Adriatic.",
        "Thus it happened that on November 18,1881, after many adieux and au\nrevoirs, I found myself on board the Cunard s.s. Demerara\n(Captain C. Jones), bound for ’Gib.’ My wife was to accompany me as far\nas Hungarian Fiume.",
        "The Cunard route to ’Gib’ is decidedly roundabout. We began with a run\nto Venice, usually six hours from the Vice-Queen of the Adriatic: it was\nprolonged to double by the thick and clinging mist-fog. The sea-city was\nenjoying her usual lethargy of repose after the excitement of the\n’geographical Carnival,’ as we called the farcical Congress of last\nSeptember. She is essentially a summering place. Her winter is\nmiserable, neither city nor houses being built for any but the finest of\nfine weather; her ’society’-season lasts only four months from\nSt. Stephen’s Day; her traveller-seasons are spring and autumn. We found\nall our friends either in bed with bad colds, or on the wing for England\nand elsewhere; we inhaled a quant. suff. of choking vapour, even\nin the comfortable Britannia Hotel; and, on the morning of the 23rd, we\nawoke to find ourselves moored alongside of the new warehouses on the\nnew port of Hungarian, or rather Croatian, Fiume.",
        "Fiume had made prodigious strides since I last saw her in 1878; and she\nis gradually taking the wind out of the sails of her sister-rival. While\nold Tergeste wastes time and trouble upon futile questions of policy,\nand angry contrasts between Germans and Slavs, and Italians and\nTriestines, Fiume looks to the main chance. The neat, clean, and\nwell-watered little harbour-city may be called a two-dinner-a-day place,\nso profuse is her hospitality to strangers. Here, too, we once more\nenjoyed her glorious outlook, the warm winter sun gilding the\nsnowy-silvery head of Monte Maggiore and raining light and life upon the\nindigo-tinted waters of Fiume Bay. Next to Naples, I know nothing in\nEurope more beautiful than this ill-named Quarnero. We saw a shot or so\nof the far-famed Whitehead torpedo, which now makes twenty-one miles an\nhour; and on Nov. 25 we began to run down the Gulf en route for\nPatras.",
        "It was a pleasure to emerge from the stern and gloomy Adriatic; and\nnothing could be more lovely than the first evening amongst the Ionian\nIslands. To port, backed by the bold heights of the Grecian sea-range,\nlay the hoary mount, and the red cliffs, 780 feet high, of Sappho’s\nLeap, a never-forgotten memory. Starboard rose bleak Ithaca, fronting\nthe black mountain of Cephalonia, now bald and bare, but clothed with\ndark forests till these were burnt down by some mischievous\nmalignant. Whatever of sterility deformed the scene lay robed under a\nglory of colour painted with perfect beauty by the last smile of the\nsun. Earth and air and sea showed every variety of the chromatic scale,\nespecially of rose-tints, from the tenderest morning blush of virgin\nsnow to the vinous evening flush upon the lowlands washed by the purple\nwave. The pure translucent vault never ceased to shift its\nchameleon-like hues, that ranged between the diaphanous azure of the\nzenith and the faintest rainbow green, a border-land where blue and\nyellow met and parted. The air felt soft and balmy; a holy calm was on\nthe face of creation; all looked delicious after the rude north, and we\nacknowledged once more that life was worth living.",
        "Patras also has greatly improved since I last saw her in 1872. The\nmalaria-swamps to the north and south of the town have been drained and\nare being warped up: the ’never-failing succession of aguish fevers’\nwill presently fade out of the guide-books. A macadamised boulevard has\nbeen built, and a breakwater is building. The once desert square,\n’Georgios A’,’ has been planted with trees, which should be Eucalyptus;\nand adorned with two French statues of bronze which harmonise admirably\nwith the surroundings. The thoroughfares are still Sloughs of Despond\nafter rain, and gridirons of St. Laurence in dusty summer; but there are\nincipient symptoms of trottoirs. And throughout there is a disappearance\nof the hovels which resembled Port Sa’id in her younger day, and a\nnotable substitution of tall solid houses.",
        "All this has been brought about by ’fruit,’ which in Patras means\ncurrants; that is, ’Corinthian grapes.’ The export this year is unusual,\n110,000 tons, including the Morea and the Islands; and of this total\nonly 20,000 go to France for wine-making. It gives a surprising idea of\nthe Christmas plum-pudding manufacture. Patras also imports for all the\nsmall adjacent places, inhabited by ’shaggy capotes.’ And she will have\na fine time when that talented and energetic soldier, General Türr, whom\nwe last met at Venice, begins the ’piercing of the Isthmus.’ À\npropos of which, one might suggest to Patras, with due respect, that\n(politically speaking) ’honesty is the best policy.’",
        "Being at Patras on St. Andrew’s Day, with a Scotch demoiselle on board,\nwe could hardly but pilgrimage to the place of the Apostle’s\nmartyrdom. Mrs. Wood kindly sent her daughters to do the honours.\nAghyos Andreas lies at the extreme south of the town on the system of\nruts, called a road, which conducts down-coast. The church is a long\nyellow barn, fronting a cypress-grown cemetery, whose contents are being\ntransferred to the new extramural. A little finger of the holy man\nreposes under a dwarf canopy in the south-eastern angle: his left arm is\npreserved at Mount Athos in a silver reliquary, set with gems. Outside,\nnear the south-western corner, is the old well of Demeter (Ceres), which\nhas not lost its curative virtues by being baptised. You descend a dwarf\nflight of brick steps to a mean shrine and portrait of the saint, and\nremark the solid bases and the rude rubble arch of the pagan temple. A\nfig-tree, under which the martyrdom took place, grew in the adjacent\ncourt; it has long been cut down, probably for fuel.",
        "The population of Patras still affords a fine study of the ’dirty\npicturesque,’ with clothes mostly home-made; sheepskin cloaks;\nfustanellas or kilts, which contain a whole piece of calico; red\nleggings, and the rudest of sandals; Turkish caps, and an occasional\npistol-belt. The Palikar still struts about in all his old bravery; and\nthe bourgeois humbly imitates the dingy garb of Southern\nItaly. The people have no taste for music, no regard for art, no respect\nfor antiquities, except for just as much as these will bring. They own\ntwo, and only two, objects in life: firstly, to make money, and\nsecondly, to keep and not to spend it. But this dark picture has a\nbright side. No race that I know is so greedy of education; the small\nboys, instead of wending unwillingly to school, crowd the doors before\nthey are opened. Where this exceptional feeling is universal we may hope\nfor much.",
        "The last evening at Patras showed us a beautiful view of what is here\ncalled Parnassus (Parnassó), the tall bluff mountain up the Gulf, whose\nsnows at sunset glowed like a balass ruby. We left the Morea at 2\nA.M. (December 2), and covered the fifty-two miles to Zante before\nbreakfast. There is, and ever has been, something peculiarly sympathetic\nto me in the ’flower of the Levant.’ ’Eh! ’tis a bonny, bonny place,’\nrepeatedly ejaculated our demoiselle. The city lies at the foot of the\ngrey cliffs, whose northern prolongation extends to the Akroteri, or\nLighthouse Point. A fine quay, the Strada Marina, has been opened during\nthe last six years along the northern sea-front, where the arcades\nsuggest those of Chester. It is being prolonged southwards to the old\nquarantine-ground and the modern prison, which rests upon the skirts of\nthe remarkable Skopo, the Prospect Mountain, 1,489 feet high. This\nfeature, which first shows itself to mariners approaching Zakynthos from\nnorth or from south, has a saddle-back sky-line, with a knob of\nlimestone shaped like a Turkish pommel and sheltering its monastery,\nPanaghia of Skopo, alias Our Lady of the Look-out. Below it appears\nanother and a similar outcrop near a white patch which has suggested\nmarble-quarrying; and the northern flank is dotted with farmhouses and\nvillas. The dwarf breakwater, so easily prolonged over the shallows, has\nnot been improved; but at its base rises a brand-new opera-house, big\nenough for a first-rate city. Similarly at Barletta they raised a loan\nto build a mole and they built a theatre. Unlike Patras, Zante long had\nthe advantage of Italian and then of English rule; and the citizens care\nfor music more than for transformation-scenes. The Palikar element also\nis notably absent; and the soldiers are in uniform, not in half-uniform\nand half-brigand attire. I missed the British flag once so conspicuous\nupon the southern round tower of the castle, where in days, or rather\nnights, of old I had spent not a few jolly hours; but I heard with\npleasure that it is proposed to make a haute-ville of the now\ndeserted and crumbling triangle, a Sommerfrisch where the\nparboiled citizens of Athens will find a splendid prospect and a cooling\nsea-breeze.",
        "Mr. E. Barff kindly accompanied us in the usual drive ’round the\nWrekin,’ for which we may here read the ’wreck.’ We set out along the\nsea-flank of the Castle hill. This formation, once a regular hog’s-back,\nhas been split by weather about the middle; and its southern end has\nbeen shaken down by earthquakes, and carved by wind and rain into\nprecipices and pinnacles of crumbling sandstone, which form the ’Grey\nCliffs.’ Having heard at Patras the worst accounts of Zante since it\npassed under Greek rule, I was not a little surprised by the excellent\ncondition of the roads and the general look of prosperity.",
        "Turning to the right we entered Mr. Barff’s garden-house, where the\ngrounds were bright and beautiful with balsam and mignonette, dahlias\nand cyclamens, chrysanthemums and oleanders, jasmine and double-violets,\norange-blossoms, and a perfect Gulistan of roses, roses of York and\nLancaster, white, pink, and purple, yellow and green–a perfumed spring\nin dreary December. Laden with bouquets we again threaded the\nolive-grounds, whose huge trunks are truly patriarchal, and saw basking\nin the sun old Eumæus, the Swine-King, waiting upon his black and\nbristly herd. The glimpse led to a characteristic tale. A wealthy Greek\nmerchant in London had made the most liberal offers to his brother, a\nshepherd in the hills of Cephalonia; the latter returned his very best\nthanks, but declared himself perfectly happy and unwilling to tempt\nfortune by change of condition to England. Greece, it is evident, has\nnot ceased to breed ’wise men.’",
        "We returned, viâ the landward flank of the hog’s-back, along the\nfine plain (’O Kampos’) bounded west by the range called after Mount\nMeriy, the apex, rising 3,274 feet. Anglo-Zantiots fondly compare its\noutline with the Jura’s. The look of the rich lowlands, ’the vale,’ as\nour charts call it, suggested a river-valley, but river there is\nnone. Every nook and corner was under cultivation, and each\ncountry-house had its chapel and its drying-ground for ’fruit,’ level\nyards now hidden under large-leaved daisies and wild flowers. We passed\nthrough the Graetani village, whose tenants bear a bad name, and saw\nnone of the pretty faces for which Zante is famed. The sex was dressed\nin dark jackets and petticoats à l’italienne; and the elders were\napparently employed in gathering ’bitter herbs,’ dandelion and the wild\nendive. Verily this is a frugal race.",
        "The drive ended with passing up the Strada Larga, the inner High Street,\nrunning parallel with the Marina. After Turkish fashion, trades flock\ntogether, shoemakers to the south and vegetable-vendors to the\nnorth. There are two good specimens of Venetian palazzetti, one\nfantastic, the other classical; and there is a rough pavement, which is\nstill wanting in Patras. A visit to the silk-shop of Garafuglia\nPapaiouanou was obligatory: here the golden-hued threads reminded me of\nthe Indian Tussur-moth. Also de rigueur was the purchase of nougat\nand raki, the local mandorlato and mastaché, almond-cake and\ngrape-spirit.",
        "Zante appears to me an excellent home for a large family with a small\nincome. A single man lives at the best hotel (Nazionale) for forty-five\nfrancs per week. A country-house with nine bedrooms, cellarage,\nstabling, dog-house, orangery, and large garden, is to be had for\n25l. a year. Fowls cost less than a franc; turkeys, if you do not\nbuy them from a shipchandler, two francs and a half. The strong and\nsherry-flavoured white wine of Zante rarely exceeds three shillings the\ngallon, sixpence a bottle. And other necessaries in the same proportion.",
        "But, oh that St. Dionysius, patron saint of Zante, would teach his\nprotégés a little of that old Persian wisdom which abhorred a lie\nand its concomitants, cheating and mean trickery! The Esmeralda,\nafter two days and one night at Zante, was charged 15l., for\npilotage, when the captain piloted himself; for church, where there is\nno parson; and for harbour dues where there is no harbour. It is almost\nincredible that so sharp-witted a race can also be so short-sighted; so\nwise about pennies, so foolish about pounds.",
        "On Saturday we left Zante in the teeth of a fresh but purely local\nnorth-easter, which whistled through the gear and hurled the spray high\nup Cape Skinari. The result was, as the poet sings–",
        "  That peculiar up-and-down motion\n  Which belongs to the treacherous ocean.",
        "Not without regret I saw the last of the memorious old castle and of\nSkopo the picturesque. We ran along the western shore of Cephalonia, the\nisle of three hundred villages: anyone passing this coast at once\nunderstands how Greece produced so many and such excellent seamen. The\nisland was a charming spectacle, with its two culminations, Maraviglia\n(3,311 ft.) and Elato (5,246 ft.), both capped by purple cloud; its\nfertile slopes and its fissured bight, Argostoli Bay, running deep into\nthe land.",
        "We fondly expected to pass the Messina Straits by daylight, and to cast\nanother glance upon old Etna, Scylla and Charybdis, the Liparis and\nStromboli. And all looked well, as about noon we were abreast of Cape\nSpartivento, the ’Split-wind’ which divides the mild northers and\nsouthers of the Straits from the raw Boras and rotting Sciroccos of the\nAdriatic. But presently a signal for succour was hoisted by a marvellous\nold tub, a sailer-made-steamer, sans boats, sans gunwales; a something\nwhose dirt and general dilapidation suggested the Flying Dutchman. I\nalmost expected to see her drop out of form and crumble into dust as our\nboys boarded her. The America, of Barletta, bound from Brindisi\nto Genoa, had hurt her boilers. We hauled in her cable–these gentry\nmust never be trusted with a chance of slipping loose–and tugged her\ninto Messina, thereby losing a valuable day.",
        "The famous Straits were almost a replica of Ionian Island scenery: the\nshores of the Mediterranean, limestone and sandstone, with here and\nthere a volcanic patch, continually repeat themselves. After passing the\nbarren heel of the Boot and its stony big toe, the wady-streaked shores\nbecome populous and well cultivated, while railway trains on either\nside, island and continent, toss their snowy plumes in the pride of\ncivilisation. The ruined castles on the crags and the new villages on\nthe lowlands told their own story of Turkish and Algerine piracy, now\ndoomed to the limbo of things that were. In the evening we were safely\nanchored within the zancle (sickle) of Messina-port, whose depth of\nwater and circular shape have suggested an old crater flooded. It was\nSunday, and we were greeted with the familiar sounds, the ringing of\ncracked bells, the screaming of harsh, hoarse voices, a military band\nand detached musical performances. The classical facade of the Marina,\nthrough whose nineteen archways and upper parallelograms you catch a\nvista of dark narrow wynd, contrasts curiously with Catania: the former\nis a ’dicky,’ a front hiding something unclean; while the latter is laid\nout in Eastern style, where, for the best of reasons, the marble palace\nhides behind a wall of mud. The only new features I noted were a metal\nfish-market, engineer art which contrasts marvellously with the Ionic\npilasters and the solid ashlar of the ’dicky;’ and, at the root of the\nsickle, a new custom-house of six detached boxes, reddest-roofed and\nwhitest-walled, built to copy children’s toy cottages. Croatian Fiume\nwould blush to own them. Of the general impurity of the town and of the\nbouquet de Messine the less said the better.",
        "As we made fast to the Marina our tobacco was temporarily sealed after\nthe usual mean Italian fashion. Next morning an absurd old person, in a\nbroad red baldrick, came on board and counted noses, to ascertain that\nwe had not brought the dreaded small-pox from the Ionian Islands. After\nbeing graciously and liberally allowed to land, we were visited by the\nlocal chapmen, whose goods appeared rather mixed–polished cowhorns and\nmildewed figs, dolls in costume and corrosive oranges; by the normal\nmusical barber, who imitates at a humble distance bird and beast; and by\nthe vendor of binoculars, who asks forty francs and who takes ten. The\ncaptain noted his protest at the Consulate, and claimed by way of\nsauvetage 200l. The owners offered 200 lire–punds Scots. Briefly,\nnoon had struck before we passed out of the noise and the smells of\nMessina.",
        "Our good deed had cost us dear. A wet scirocco had replaced the bright\nnorther and saddened all the view. Passing the tide-rip Charybdis, a\nmeeting of currents, which called only for another hand at the wheel;\nand the castled crag of naughty Scylla, whose town has grown\nprodigiously, we bade adieu to the ’tower of Pelorus.’ Then we shaped\nour course for the Islands of Æolus, or the Winds, and the Lipari\narchipelago, all volcanic cones whose outlines were misty as Ossian’s\nspectres. And we plodded through the dreary dull-grey scene of drizzling\nscirocco–",
        "  Till, when all veilèd sank in darkling air,\n  Naught but the welkin and the wave was there.",
        "Next morning showed us to port the Cone of Maritimo: it outlies Marsala,\nwhose wine caused the blinding of Polyphemus, and since that time has\nbrought on many an attack of liver. The world then became to us\npontus et aer. Days and nights were equally uneventful; the diary\ntells only of quiet seas under the lee of Sardinia and of the Balearics,\nghostly glimpses of the North African coast and the steady setting in of\nthe normal wester, the indraught of ’the Straits.’",
        "On Friday (November 9) the weather broke and deluged us with rain. At\nGibraltar the downpour lasted twenty-four hours. We found ourselves at\nanchor before midnight with a very low barometer, which suggested\nunpleasantries. Next morning we sighted the deep blue waters of the Bay,\nand the shallow brown waters of the Bayside crested with foam by a\nfurious norther, that had powdered the far Ronda highlands with\nsnow. Before noon, however, the gale had abated and allowed me to\ntransfer myself and African outfit on board the Fez (Capt. Hay),\nMoroccan Steamship Company, trading to North Africa. This was a\ngodsend: there is no regular line between Gibraltar and Lisbon, and one\nmight easily be delayed for a week.",
        "The few hours’ halt allowed me time to call upon my old friend,\nM. Dautez, a Belgian artist. Apparently he is the only person in the\nplace who cares for science. He has made extensive collections. He owns\ntwenty-four coins from Carteia, whereas Florez (Medallas, Madrid, 1773)\nshows a total of only thirty-three. Amongst his antiquities there is a\ncharming statuette of Minerva, a bronze miniature admirably finished. He\nhas collected the rock fauna, especially the molluscs, fossil and\nmodern. He is preparing an album of the Flora Calpensis. His birds’\nnests were lately sold to an Englishman. All these objects, of immense\nlocal interest, were offered by him at the lowest possible rate to the\nMilitary Library, but who is there to understand their value? I wonder\nhow many Englishmen on the Rock know that they are within easy ride of\nthe harbour which named the ’Ships of Tarshish’? Tartessus, which was\nCarteia, although certain German geographers would, against the general\nvoice of antiquity, make the former the country and the latter the city,\nlay on both sides of the little Guadarranque stream, generally called\nFirst River; and the row of tumuli on the left bank probably denotes the\nsite of the famous docks. I was anxious to open diggings in 1872, but\npermission was not forthcoming: now, however, they say that the Duke of\nMedina Sidonia would offer no objections.",
        "Gib, though barbarous in matters of science, is civilised as regards\n’business.’ It was a treat to see steamer after steamer puff in, load up\nwith blue peter at the fore, and start off after a few hours which would\nhave been days at Patras, Zante, and Messina. Here men work with a will,\nas a walk from the Convent to the Old Mole, the Mersa or water-port of a\nMoroccan town, amply proves. The uniforms are neat and natty–they were\nthe reverse five years ago–and it is a pleasure to look upon the fresh\nfaces of English girls still unstained by unconsumed carbon. And the\nauthorities have had the good sense to preserve the old Moorish town of\nTárik and his successors, the triangle of walls with the tall tower-like\nmosque for apex, and the base facing the bay.",
        "We left Gibraltar at 5 P.M. on Saturday (December 10), giving a wide\nberth to the hated Pearl Rock, which skippers would remove by force of\narms. Seen from east or west Gib has an outline of its own. The\nBritisher, whose pride it is, sees the ’lion of England who has laid his\npaw upon the key of the Mediterranean,’ and compares it with the king of\nbeasts, sejant, the tail being Europa Point. The Spaniards, to whom it\nis an eyesore, liken it to a shrouded corpse, the outlined head lying to\nthe north, and declare, truly enough, that to them it is a dead body.",
        "The norther presently changed to the rainy south-wester, the builder of\nthe Moroccan ’bars’ and the scourge of the coast fringing North-west\nAfrica, Rolling set in with the usual liveliness. Events were not\neventful. The first midnight found us off Cape Trafalgar, and the second\noff St. Vincent. At 4 P.M. (December 12), we saw the light of Espíchel\n(Promóntorium Barbaricum), the last that shines upon the voyager\nbound Brazilwards. Before nightfall we had left Buzio lighthouse to\nstarboard. We then ran up the northern passage in charge of a lagging\npilot; and, as the lamps were lighting, we found ourselves comfortably\nberthed off that pretty toy, Belem Tower.",
        "Next morning broke upon a lovely view: no wonder that the Tagus is the\npride of Portuguese bards. The Rosicler, or rosy dawn-light, was\nthat of a May morning–the May of poetry, not of meteorology–and the\nupper windows of distant Lisbon were all ablaze with the unrisen sun. It\nwas a picture for the loveliest colours, not for ’word-painting;’ and\nthe whole scene was classical as picturesque. We may justly say of it,\n’Nullum sine nomine saxum.’ Far over the rising hills of the north bank\nrose shaggy Cintra, ’the most blessed spot in the habitable globe,’ with\nits memorious convent and its Moorish castle. The nearer heights were\nstudded with the oldest-fashioned windmills, when the newest are found\neven in the Canaries; a single crest bore its baker’s dozen, mostly\ndecapitated by steam. Advancing we remarked the glorious Belem\nmonastery, defiled by its ignoble modern ruin to the west; the new\nhippodrome crowning the grassy slope; the Bed House of Belem, now being\nbrightened up for Royal residence during the Exhibition of 1882; the\nMemoria and the Ajuda Palace, more unfinished, if possible, than\never. As we approached the bulk of the city the marking objects were the\ncypressed Prazeres Cemetery; the red Necessidades Palace, and the\nEstrella, whose dome and domelets, built to mimic St. Peter’s, look only\nlike hen and chickens. Then in due time came the Carmo Church, still\nunrepaired since 1755; Blackhorse Square, still bare of trees; the\nGovernment offices, still propped to prevent a tumble-down, and the old\nCustom House, still a bilious yellow; the vast barrack-like pile of\nS. Vicente, the historic Sé or cathedral with dumpy towers; the\nblack Castle of São Jorge, so hardly wrung from the gallant Moors, and\nthe huge Santa Engracia, apparently ever to be a ruin.",
        "I spent a pleasant week at Lisbon, and had a fair opportunity of\nmeasuring what progress she has made during the last sixteen years. We\nhave no longer to wander up and down disconsolate",
        "  Mid many things unsightly to strange ee.",
        "If the beggars remain, the excessive dirt and the vagrant dogs have\ndisappeared. The Tagus has a fine embankment; but the land side is\noccupied by mean warehouses. The sewers, like those of Trieste, still\nwant a cloaca maxama, a general conduit of masonry running along\nthe quay down-stream. The Rocio has been planted with mean trees,\ngreatly to the disgust of the average Lusitanian, who hates such\nsun-excluding vegetation like a backwoodsman; yet the Quintella\nsquarelet shows what fine use may be made of cactus and pandanus, aloes\nand palms, not to mention the ugly and useful eucalyptus. The\nthoroughfares are far cleaner than they were; and Lisbon is now\nsurrounded by good roads. The new houses are built with some respect for\narchitectonic effect of light and shade: such fine old streets as the\nRua Augusta offend the eye by façades flat as cards with rows of pips\nfor windows. Finally, a new park is being laid out to the north of the\nPasseio Publico.",
        "Having always found ’Olisipo’ exceptionally hospitable and pleasant, I\nlook forward to the days when she will be connected with Paris by direct\nrailway. Her hotels are first-rate; her prices are not excessive; her\nwinter climate is delightful, and she is the centre of most charming\nexcursions. The capital has thrown off much of her old lethargy. Her\nGeographical Society is doing hard and honest work; she has nobly\nexpiated the national crime by becoming a ’Camonian’ city; and she\nindulges freely in exhibitions. One, of Ornamental Art, was about to be\nopened when I last saw her, and it extended deep into the next spring.",
        "FROM LISBON TO MADEIRA.",
        "My allotted week in Lisbon came to an end only too soon: in the society\nof friends, and in the Camonian room (Bibliotheca Nacional), which\ncontains nearly 300 volumes, I should greatly have enjoyed a month. The\ns.s. Luso (Captain Silva), of the ’Empresa Insulana,’ one of the\nvery few Portuguese steamers, announced her departure for December 20;\nand I found myself on board early in the morning, with a small but\nhighly select escort to give me God-speed.",
        "Unfortunately the ’May weather’ had made way for the cacimbas\n(mists) of a rainy sou’-wester. The bar broke and roared at us; Cintra,\nthe apex of Lisbon’s extinct volcano and the Mountain of the (Sun and)\nMoon, hid her beautiful head, and even the Rock of Lisbon disdained the\nnormal display of sturdy flank. Then set in a brise carabinée,\nwhich lasted during our voyage of 525 miles, and the Luso,\nrolling like a moribund whale, proved so lively that most of the\nfourteen passengers took refuge in their berths. A few who resisted the\nsea-fiend’s assaults found no cause of complaint: the captain and\nofficers were exceedingly civil and obliging, and food and wines were\ngood and not costly.",
        "From Madeira the Luso makes, once a month, the tour of the\nAzores, touching at each island–a great convenience–and returning in\nten days.",
        "Early on Thursday, the 22nd, the lumpy, churning sea began to subside,\nand the invisible balm seduced all the sufferers to the\nquarter-deck. They were wild to sight Madeira as children to see the\nrising of the pantomime-curtain. There was not much to gaze at; but what\nwill not attract man’s stare at sea?–a gull, a turtle, a flying fish!\nBy the by, Captain Tuckey, of the Congo Expedition, remarked the\n’extraordinary absence of sea-birds in the vicinity of Madeira and the\nCanaries:’ they have since learned the way thither. Porto Santo appeared\nas a purple lump of three knobs, a manner of ’gizzard island,’ backed by\na deeper gloom of clouds–Madeira. Then it lit up with a pale glimmer as\nof snow, the effect of the sun glancing upon the thin greens of the\nnorthern flank; and, lastly, it broke into two masses–northern and\nsouthern–of peaks and precipices connected by a strip of lowland.",
        "It is generally held that the discovery of the Madeiran group (1418-19)\nwas the first marking feature of the century which circumnavigated\nAfrica, and that Porto Santo was ’invented ’by the Portuguese before\nMadeira. The popular account, however, goes lame. For instance, the\nstory that tried and sturdy soldiers and seamen were deterred from\nadvancing a few miles, and were driven back to Portugal by the ’thick\nimpenetrable darkness which was guarded by a strange noise,’ and by\nanile fancies about the ’Mouth of Hell’ and ’Cipango,’ reads like mere\nstuff and nonsense. Again, great are the difficulties in determining the\nnationality of the explorers, and settling the conflicting claims of the\nFrench, Genoese, Portuguese, Spanish, English, and Arabs. History, and\nperhaps an aptitude for claiming, have assigned the honour exclusively\nto Lusitania: and every guide-book tells the same old tale. But I have\nlived long enough to have seen how history is written; and the discovery\nwas, at best, a mere re-discovery, as we learn from Pliny (vi. 36),\nwhose ’insulae purpurariae’ cannot be confounded [Footnote: Mr. Major,\nhowever, would identify the Purple Islands with Oanarian Fuerteventura\nand Lanzarote, both possibly Continental.] with the Fortunate Islands,\nor Canaries. The ’Gaetulian dye’ of King Juba in the Augustan age is\nnot known. Its origin has been found in the orchilla still growing upon\nthe Desertas; but this again appears unlikely enough. Ptolemy (iv. 1,16)\nalso mentions ’Erythía,’ the Red Isle–’red,’ possibly, for the same\nreason; and Plutarch (in Suet.) may allude to the Madeiran group when he\nrelates of the Fortunate Islands: ’They are two, separated only by a\nnarrow channel, and at a distance of 400 leagues (read 320 miles) from\nthe African coast.’",
        "The Jesuit, Antonio Cordeyro, [Footnote: Historia insulana das Ilhas\na Portugal sugoytas, pp. 61-96. Lisbon, 1717.] who borrows from the\nlearned and trustworthy Dr. Gaspar Fructuoso, [Footnote: As Saudades\nda Terra, lib. i. ch. iii, Historia das Ilhas, &c. This\nlettered and conscientious chronicler, the first who wrote upon the\nPortuguese islands, was born (A.D. 1522) at Ponta Delgada (Thin Point)\nof St. Michael, Azores. He led a life of holiness and good works,\ncomposed his history in 1590, left many ’sons of his soul,’ as he called\nhis books, and died in his natal place, A.D. 1591. The Madeiran portion\nof the two huge folios (some 4,000 pages of MS.) has been printed at\nFunchal, with copious notes by Dr. A. Rodrigues de Azevedo, Professor of\nLiterature, &c., at the National Lyceum; and a copy was kindly lent to\nme, during the author’s absence in Lisbon, by Governor Viscount de Villa\nMendo.] declares in 1590: ’The first discoverers of the Porto Santo\nIsland, many say, were those Frenchmen and Castilians (Spaniards) who\nwent forth from Castile to conquer the Canaries; these, when either\noutward or homeward bound, came upon the said island, and, for that they\nfound it uninhabited and small, they abandoned it; but as they had\nweathered a storm and saved themselves there, they named it Port Holy.’\nFructuoso (i. 5) expressly asserts that the Portuguese sailed from\nLisbon in June 1419 for ’the Isle of Porto Sancto’(in 32° N. lat.),\nwhich two years before had been discovered by some Castilian ships\nmaking the Canaries, the latter having been occupied a short time\npreviously by the French; wherefore the pilot took that route.’ The\nJesuit chronicler continues to relate that after the formally proclaimed\nannexation of the Canaries by the Normans and Castilians (A.D. 1402-18),\nPrince Henry, the Navigator, despatched from Lagos, in 1417, an\nexpedition to explore Cape Bojador, the ’gorbellied.’ The three ships\nwere worked by the Italian master-seaman Bertholomeu Palestrello or\nPalestro, commonly called Perestrello. The soldiers, corresponding to\nour marines, were commanded by the ’sweet warman,’ João Gonçales da\nCamara, nicknamed ’O Zargo,’ the Cyclops, not the squint-eyed;\n[Footnote: Curious to say, Messieurs White and Johnson, the writers of\nthe excellent guide-book, will translate the word ’squint-eyed:’ they\nmight have seen the portrait in Government House.] his companion was\nTristão Vaz Teyxeyra, called in honour ’the Tristam.’ Azurara,\n[Footnote: Chronica do Descobrimento de Guiné. By Gomes Eannes de\nAzurara, written between A.D. 1452-53, and quoted by Prof. Azevedo,\nNotes, p. 830.] a contemporary, sends the ’two noble squires,’ Zarco and\nTristam, ’who in bad weather were guided by God to the isle now called\nPorto Sancto’ (June 1419). They returned home (marvellous to relate)\nwithout touching at Madeira, only twenty-three miles distant; and next\nyear (1420) Prince Henry commissioned Palestrello also.",
        "The Spaniards prefer to believe that after Jehan de Béthencourt’s attack\nupon the Canaries (A.D. 1403), his soldier Lancelot, who named Lanzarote\nIsland, touched at Porto Santo in 1417; and presently, sailing to the\nsouth-west, discovered Madeira. This appears reasonable enough.",
        "Patriotic Barbot (1700), in company with the mariner Villault de\nBelfons, Père Labat, and Ernest de Fréville, [Footnote: Mémoire sur\nle Commerce Maritime de Rouen.] claims the honour for France.\nAccording to that ’chief factor for the African Company,’ the\nmerchants of Dieppe first traded to West Africa for cardamoms and\nivory. This was during the reign of Charles V., and between 1364 and\n1430, or half a century before the Portuguese. Their chief stations were\nGoree of Cape Verde, Sierra Leone, Cape Mount, the Kru or Liberian\ncoast, then called ’of Grain,’ from the ’Guinea grains’ or Malaguetta\npepper (Amomum granum Paradisi), and, lastly, the Gold\nCoast. Here they founded ’Petit Paris’ upon the Baie de France, at\n’Serrelionne;’ ’Petit Dieppe,’ at the mouth of the St. John’s River,\nnear Grand Bassá, south of Monrovia; and ’Cestro’ [Footnote: Now\ngenerally called Grand Sestros, and popularly derived from the\nPortuguese cestos–pepper.] or ’Sestro Paris,’ where, three\ncenturies afterwards, the natives retained a few words of French. Hence\nAdmiral Bouet-Willaumez explains the Great and Little ’Boutoo’ of our\ncharts by butteau, from butte, the old Norman word still\npreserved in the great western prairies.",
        "Barbot resumes that in 1383 the Rouen traders, combining with the Dieppe\nmen, sent upon an exploring voyage three ships, one of which, La\nVierge, ran down coast as far as where Commenda (Komenda or Komání)\nand Elmina now stand. At the latter place they built a fort and factory\njust one century before it was occupied by the Portuguese. The Frenchman\ndeclares that one of the Elmina castles was called Bastion de France,\nand ’on it are still to be seen some old arithmetical numbers, which are\nanno 13’ (i.e. 1383); ’the rest being defaced by weather.’ This\nfirst factory was afterwards incorporated with the modern building; and\nin 1387 it was enlarged with the addition of a chapel to lodge more than\nten or twelve men, the original garrison.",
        "In 1670 Ogilvy [Footnote: London: Printed by Tho. Johnson for the\nauthor, and to be had at his house in White Fryers, MDCLXX.] notes: ’The\ncastle (Elmina) was judged to be an Antient Building from several marks\nof Antiquity about it; as first by a decay’d Battery, which the\nDutch repaired some years ago, retaining the name of the\nFrench Battery, because it seems to have been built by the\nFrench; who, as the Inhabitants say, before the coming of the\nPortugals harbour’d there. The Dutch when they won it,\nfound the numerical Figures of the year thirteen hundred; but were not\nable to make anything of the two following Characters. In a small place\nwithin also, may be seen a Writing carved in Stone between two old\nPillars, but so impair’d and worn out by the weather that it is not\nlegible.’ At Groree, too, similar remains were reported.",
        "The adventurers, it is said, carried on a good trade till 1430-90, when\nthe civil wars distracting France left her without stomach for distant\nadventure; and in 1452 Portugal walked over the course. M. d’Avezac, who\nfound Porto Santo in a French map of the fourteenth century, [Footnote:\nBulletin de la Société de Géographie, cinquième série, tome\nv. p. 260. Also ’Iles de l’Afrique,’ in the Univers. Paris,\n1868.] seems inclined to take the part of ’quelques précurseurs\nméconnus contre les prétentions trop exclusives des découvreurs\nofficiels.’",
        "Barbot’s details are circumstantial, but they have not been confirmed by\ncontemporary evidence or by local tradition. The Portuguese indignantly\ndeny the whole, and M. Valdez in his ’Complete Maritime Handbook’\n[Footnote: Six Years of a Traveller’s Life in Western Africa.\nLondon, Hurst & Blackett, 1861.] alludes contemptuously to ’Norman\npirates.’ They point out that Diego d’Azembuja, the chief captain, sent\nin 1481 to found São Jorje da Mina, our ’Elmina Castle,’ saw no traces\nof previous occupation. But had he done so, would he have dared to\npublish the fact? Professor Azevedo relies upon the silence of Azurara,\nBarros, and Camoens concerning the French, the Spaniards, and the\nEnglish in the person of Robert à Machim. But this is also at best a\nnegative argument: the ’Livy of Portugal’ never mentions the great\nmathematician, Martin Behaim, who accompanied Diego Cam to his discovery\nof the Congo. In those days fair play was not a jewel.",
        "The truth is that it would be as easy to name the discoverer of\ngunpowder or steam-power as to find the first circumnavigator of the\nAfrican continent. I have no difficulty in believing that the\nPhoenicians and Carthaginians were capable of making the voyage. They\nwere followed to West Africa in early days, according to El-Idrisi and\nIbn. el-Wardi, by the Arabs. The former (late eleventh century) relates\nthat an Arab expedition sailed from Lisbon, shortly after the eighth\ncentury, and named Madeira and Porto Santo the ’Islands El-Ghanam and\nRákah.’ However that may be, the first Portuguese occupants found\nneither men nor ruins nor large quadrupeds upon any of the group.",
        "The English accident of hitting upon Madeira, and the romantic tale of\nMaster Robert à Machim, or Machin, or Macham, and Mistress Anne d’Arfet,\nor Darby, or Dorset, which would have suited Camoens, and which I have\ntold elsewhere, [Footnote: Wanderings in West Africa, vol. i,\np. 17. Chapter II., ’A Day at Madeira,’ was written after my second and\nbefore my third visit.] and need not repeat, was probably an ’ingenious\naccount’ invented for politico-international ends or to flatter Dom\nEnrique, a Britisher by the distaff-side. It is told with a thousand\nvariants, and ignored by the learned Fructuoso. According to the\napocryphal manuscript of Francisco Alcoforado, the squire who\naccompanied the Zargo, this elopement took place in the earlier days of\nEdward III. (A.D. 1327-77). The historian Antonio Galvão fixes upon\nSeptember 1344, the date generally accepted. Thus the interval between\nMachim’s death and the Zargo’s discovery would be seventy-four years;\nand–pace Mr. Major–the Castilian pilot, Juan Damores (de\nAmores), popularly called Morales, could not have met the remnant\nof the Bristol crew in their Moroccan prison, and could not have\ntold the tale to the Portuguese explorers.",
        "M. d’Avezac (loc. cit. p. 116) supports the claims of the\nGenoese, quoting the charts and portulans of the fourteenth century in\nwhich appear Italian names, as Insule dello Legname (of wood,\nmateria, Madeira), Porto Sancto, Insule Deserte, and Insule\nSelvaggie. Mr. R. H. Major replies that these Italian navigators\nwere commandants of expeditions fitted out by the Portuguese; and that\nthis practice dated from 1341, when two ships officered by Genoese, with\ncrews of [footnote: Amongst the ’ridiculous little blots, which are\n\"nuts” to the old resident,’ I must confess to killing Robert Machim in\n1334 instead of 1344; ’Collegio’ was also translated ’College’ instead\nof ’Jesuit Church.’] Italians, Castilians, and Hispani (Spanish\nand Portuguese), were seat to explore the Canaries.",
        "’Holy Port’ began badly. The first governor, Perestrello, fled from the\nprogeny of his own she-rabbit. This imprudence was also committed at\nDeserta Grande; and, presently, the cats introduced by way of cure ran\nwild. A grass-clad rock in the Fiume Gulf can tell the same tale: sheep\nand lambs were effectually eaten out by rabbits and cats. It will be\nremembered that Columbus married Philippa, third daughter of the\nnavigator Perestrello, lived as a mapper with his father-in-law, and\nthence travelled, between 1470 and 1484, to Guinea, where he found that\nthe equatorial regions are not uninhabitable by reason of the heat. He\ninherited the old seaman’s papers, and thus arose the legend of his\nlearning from a castaway pilot the way to the New World. [Footnote:\nFructuoso writes that in 1486 Columbus gave food and shelter to the crew\nof a shattered Biscayan ship; the pilot dying bequeathed to him papers,\ncharts and valuable observations made on the Western Ocean.]",
        "Long years rolled by before Porto Santo learnt to bear the vine, to\nbreed large herds of small cattle, and to produce cereals whose yield is\nsaid to have been 60 to 1. Meanwhile it cut down for bowls, mortars, and\ncanoes, as the Guanches did for shields, its thin forest of ’Dragons.’\nThe Dragoeiro (Dracaena Draco Linn., Palma canariensis\nTourn.), which an Irish traveller called a ’dragon-palm,’ owed its\nvulgar name to the fancy that the fruit contained the perfect figure of\na standing dragon with gaping mouth and long neck, spiny back and\ncrocodile’s tail. It is a quaint tree of which any ingenious carpenter\ncould make a model. The young trunk is somewhat like that of the\nOreodoxa regia, or an asparagus immensely magnified; but it\nfrequently grows larger above than below. At first it bears only\nbristly, ensiform leaves, four feet long by one to three inches broad,\nand sharp-pointed, crowning the head like a giant broom. Then it puts\nforth gouty fingers, generally five, standing stiffly up and still\ncapped by the thick yucca-like tufts. Lastly the digitations grow to\nenormous arms, sometimes eighteen feet in girth, of light and porous,\nsoft and spongy wood. The tree then resembles the baobab or calabash,\nthe elephant or hippopotamus of the vegetable kingdom.",
        "Amongst the minor uses of this ’Dragon,’ the sweet yellowish berries\ncalled masainhas were famous for fattening pigs. The splinters\nmade tooth-picks which, dipped in the juice, secured health for human\ngums. But the great virtue resided in the Sanguis Draconis, the\n’Indian Cinnabaris’ of Pliny, [Footnote: N.H. xxxiii. 38.] who\nholds it to be the sanies of the dragon mixed with the blood of the\ndying elephant. The same semi-mystical name is given to the sap by the\nArab pharmists: in the Middle Ages this strong astringent resin was a\nsovereign cure for all complaints; now it is used chiefly for\nvarnishes. The gum forms great gouts like blood where the bark is\nwounded or fissured: at first it is soft as that of the cherry, but it\nhardens by exposure to a dry red lump somewhat like ’mummy.’ It has no\nspecial taste: when burnt the smell is faintly balsamic. The produce was\ncollected in canes, and hence the commercial name ’Dragon’s blood in\nreeds.’",
        "Mr. P. Barker Webb believed the Dragoeiro to be a species peculiar to\nthe Madeiras and Canaries. But its chief point of interest is its\nextending through Morocco as far as Arabo-African Socotra, and through\nthe Khamiesberg Range of Southern Africa, where it is called the\nKokerboom. As it is utterly African, like the hippopotamus, the zebra,\nand the giraffe, we must account, by transplantation from Socotra, for\nthe D. Draco seen by Cruttenden in the mountains behind Dhofar and on\nthe hills of El-Yemen. [Footnote: Journ. R. Geogr. Soc. p. 279,\nvol. viii. of 1838.] The line of growth, like the coffee-shrub and the\ncopal-tree, suggests a connection across the Dark Continent: thus the\nsimilar flora of Fernando Po Peak, of Camarones volcano, and of the\nhighlands of Abyssinia seems to prove a latitudinal range traversing the\nequatorial regions, where the glacial epoch banished for ever the\nhardier plants from the lower levels. When Humboldt determined it to be\na purely Indian growth, he seems to have confounded the true ’dragon’\nwith a palm or some other tree supplying the blood. It was a ’dazzling\ntheory,’ but unsound: the few specimens in Indus-land, ’its real\ncountry,’ are comparatively young, and are known to have been imported.",
        "The endogenous monster, indigenous to the Elysian Fields, is to the\nsurrounding vegetation what the cockatrice is to the cock, the wyvern to\nthe python. I should say ’was,’ for all the replants at Madeira and the\nCanaries are modern, and resemble only big toothsticks. But ’dragons’\nproper have existed, and perhaps memories of these portents long\nlingered in the brain of protohistoric man. Even if they had been\naltogether fabulous, the fanciful Hellenic mind would easily have\ncreated them. The Dragoeiro with its boa-like bole, its silvery,\nlight-glancing skin, and its scars stained with red blood, growing in a\nwild garden of glowing red-yellow oranges, would easily become the fiery\nsaurian guarding the golden apples of the Hesperides.",
        "Porto Santo and Madeira, though near neighbours, are contrasts in most\nrespects. The former has yellow sands and brackish water, full of\nmagnesia and lime, which blacken the front teeth; the latter sweet water\nand black shingles. The islet is exceedingly dry, the island damp as\nDevonshire. Holy Port prefers wheeled conveyances: Wood-and-Fennel-land\ncorsas or sledges, everywhere save on the New Road. Finally, the\nwines of the northern mite are comparatively light and acidulous; of the\nsouthern, luscious and heady.",
        "Both scraps of ground are of kindred although disputed\norigin. Classicists [Footnote: Plato, Timaeus, ii. 517. His\n’fruit with a hard rind, affording meat, drink, and ointment,’ is\nevidently the cocoanut. The cause of the lost empire and the identity of\nits site with the Dolphin’s Ridge and the shallows noted by\nH.M.S. Challenger, have been ably pleaded in Atlantis, &c.,\nby Ignatius Donnelly (London, Sampson Low, 1882).] find in these sons of\nVulcan, the débris of Platonic Atlantis, a drowned continent, a\n’Kingdom of Nowhere,’ which some cataclysm whelmed beneath the waters,\nleaving, for all evidence, three shattered groups of outcrops, like the\nChannel Islands, fragments of a lost empire, the ’bones of a wasted\nbody.’ Geologists, noting that volcanoes almost always fringe mainlands,\nbelieve them destined, together with the Cape Verdes, to rampart in\nfuture ages the Dark Continent with a Ghaut-chain higher than the\nAndes. Other theorists hold to a recent connection of the Madeiras with\nMount Atlas, although the former rise from a narrow oceanic trough some\n13,000 to 15,000 feet deep. Others again join them to Southern Europe\nand to Northern America. The old Portuguese and certain modern realists\nmake them a continuation of the Serra de Monchique in the Algarves, even\nas the Azores prolong Cintra; and this opinion is somewhat justified by\nthe flora, which resembles in many points the tertiary and extinct\ngrowths of Europe. [Footnote: Such is the opinion of M. Pégot-Ogier in\nThe Fortunate Islands, translated by Frances Locock (London,\nBentleys, 1871). Moquet set the example in 1601 by including Madeira\nalso in the ’Elysian Fields and Earthly Paradise’ of the ancients.]",
        "Porto Santo was till lately distinguished only for pride, poverty, and\npurity of blood. Her soil, according to the old chroniclers, has never\nbeen polluted, like São Thomé and other colonies, by convicts, Jews, or\nother ’infected peoples.’ She was populated by Portuguese ’noble and\ntaintless’–Palestrellos, Calaças, Pinas, Vieyras, Rabaçaes, Crastos,\nNunes, Pestanas, and Concellos. And yet not a little scandal was caused\nby Holiport when the ’Prophet Fernando’ and the ’Prophetess Philippa’\n(Nunes), ’instigated by the demon and the deceitfulness of mankind,’\ninduced the ecclesiastics to introduce into the introit, with the names\nof St. Peter and St. Paul, the ’Blessed Prophet Fernando.’ The tale of\nmurder is told with holy horror by Dr. Gaspar Fructuoso, and the\nislanders are still nicknamed ’prophetas.’  Foreigners, however, who\nhave lately visited them, speak highly of their simple primitive ways.",
        "I boated to the Holy Port in 1862, when Messieurs Blandy’s steamship\nFalcon was not in existence. And now as the Luso steamed\nalong shore, no external change appeared. A bird’s-eye view of the islet\nsuggests a podão or Madeiran billhook, about six miles by\nthree. The tool’s broken point is the Ilha da Cima, facing to\nnorth-east, a contorted pile which resembles a magnified cinder. The\nhandle is the Ilheu Baixo, to the south; and the blade is the tract of\nyellow sandy lowlands–the sole specimen of its sort in the\nMadeiras–connecting the extremities. Three tall cones at once disclose\nvulcanism; the Pico de Facho, or Beacon Peak (1,660 feet), the Pico de\nAnna Ferreira (910 feet), and the sugarloaf Pico de Castello (1,447\nfeet). The latter rises immediately north of the single town, and its\nhead still shows in white points the ruins of the fort which more than\nonce saved the population from the ’Moors.’ The lower levels are\nterraced, as usual in this archipelago, and the valleys are green with\nvines and cereals. The little white Villa Baleira is grouped\naround its whiter church, and dotted with dark vegetation, trees, and\nhouses, straggling off into open country. Here lodge the greater part of\nthe islanders, now nearly 1,750 souls. The population is far too\nthick. But the law of Portugal has, till lately, forbidden emigration to\nthe islanders unless a substitute for military service be provided; the\nforce consists of only 250 men, and the term of service is three years;\nyet a remplaçant costs upwards of 50l. Every emigrant was,\ntherefore, an energetic stowaway, who landed at Honolulu or Demerara\nwithout shoes and stockings, and returned in a few years with pounds\nsterling enough to purchase an estate and a pardon. Half-a-dozen boats,\nsome of them neat little feluccas with three masts, are drawn up on the\nbeach: there is not much fishing; the vine-disease has raged, and the\nstaple export consists of maize in some quantities; of cantaria,\na grey trachyte which works more freely than the brown or black basalt,\nand of an impure limestone from Ilheu Baixo, the only calcaire\nused in Funchal. This rock is apparently an elevated coral-reef: it also\nproduces moulds of sea-shells, delicately traced and embedded in blocks\nof apparently unbroken limestone. Of late a fine vein of manganese has\nbeen found in the northern or mountainous part of the island: specimens\nshown to me by Mr. J. Blandy appeared remarkably rich.",
        "Under the lee of Porto Santo we enjoyed a dry deck and a foretaste of\nthe soft and sensuous Madeiran ’Embate,’ the wester opposed to the\nLeste, Harmattan, Khammasin, or Scirocco, the dry wind which brings\nwet. [Footnote: The popular proverb is, ’A Leste never dies thirsty.’]\nThen we rolled over the twenty-five geographical miles separating us\nfrom our destination. Familiar sites greeted my eyes: here the ’Isle of\nWood’ projects a dwarf tail composed of stony vertebræ: seen upon the\nmap it looks like the thin handle of a broad chopper. The outermost or\nextreme east is the Ilha de Fora, where the A.S.S. Forerunner and\nthe L. and H. Newton came to grief: a small light, one of the\nmany on this shore, now warns the careless skipper; but apparently\nnothing is easier than to lose ships upon the safest coasts. Inside it\nis the Ponta de São Lourenço, where the Zargo, when startled, called\nupon his patron Saint of the Gridiron; others say it was named after his\ngood ship. It has now a lighthouse and a telegraph-station. [Footnote:\nThe line runs all along the southern shore as far as the Ponta do Pargo\n(of the ’braise-fish,’ Pargus vulgaris), the extreme west. At\nFunchal the cable lands north of Fort São Thiago Minor, where ships are\nrequested not to anchor. It is used chiefly for signalling arrivals from\nnorth and south; and there is talk of extending it to the Porto da Cruz,\na bay on the north-eastern side. It would be of great advantage to\nMadeira if steamers could here land their mails when prevented from\ntouching at Funchal by the south winds, which often last a\nweek. Accordingly a breakwater has been proposed, and Messieurs Blandy\nare taking interest in the improvement.] The innermost of this sharp\nline of serrated basaltic outliers is the Pedra do Furado, which\nEnglishmen call the Arch-Rock.",
        "The substantial works of the Gonçalo-Machico highway, the\ntelegraph-posts, and the yellow-green lines of sugar-cane, were the only\nchanges I could detect in Eastern Madeira. Nothing more charming than\nthe variety and contrast of colours after the rusty-brown raiment which\nSouthern Europe dons in mid-December. Even the barren, arid, and\nwindswept eastern slopes glowed bright with the volcanic muds locally\ncalled laterites, and the foliated beds of saibros and maçapés,\ndecomposed tufas oxidised red and yellow. As we drew nearer to Funchal,\nwhich looks like a giant plate-bande, tilted up at an angle of\n40°, we were startled by the verdure of every shade and tint; the\nyellow-green of the sugar and common cane (Arundo sagittata), of\nthe light-leaved aloe, banana, and hibiscus; the dark orange, myrtle,\nand holm-oak; the gloomy cypress, and the dull laurels and bay-trees,\nwhile waving palms, growing close to stiff pines and junipers (Oedro\nda Serra), showed the contrast and communion of north and south.",
        "Lines of plane-trees, with foliage now blighted yellow and bright green\nin February, define the embouchures of the three grim black ravines\nradiating from the upper heights, and broadening out as they approach\nthe bay. The rounded grassy hill-heads setting off the horizontal\ncurtains of dry stone, ’horticultural fortifications’ which guard the\nslopes, and which rise to a height of 3,000 feet; the lower monticules\nand parasitic craters, Signal Hill, Race-course Hill, São Martinho and\nSanto Antonio, telling the tale of throes perhaps to be renewed; the\nstern basaltic cliff-walls supporting the island and prolonged in black\njags through the glassy azure of the transparent sea; the gigantic\nheadlands forming abutments for the upper arch; the chequered lights and\nshades and the wavy play of sunshine and cloudlet flitting over the face\nof earth; the gay tenements habited in white and yellow, red, green,\nand, not unfrequently, blue; the houses built after the model of\ncigar-boxes set on edge, with towers, belvederes, and gazebos so tall\nthat no one ascends them, and with flat roofs bearing rooms of glass,\nsparkling like mirrors where they catch the eye of day; the toy-forts,\nsuch as the Fortaleza do Pico de São João, built by the Spaniards, an\nupper work which a single ironclad would blow to powder with a\nbroadside; the mariner’s landmark, 2,000 feet high, Nossa Senhora do\nMonte, white-framed in brown-black and backed by its feathery pines,\ndistance-dwarfed to mere shrubs, where the snow-winds sport; the\ncloud-cap, a wool-pack, iris-tinted by the many-hued western sky, and\nthe soft sweet breath of the serre-chaude below, profusely\nscented with flower and fruit, all combined to form an ensemble\nwhose first sight Northern travellers long remember.

Nor have the upper heights been wholly bared. The\nmountain-flanks are still bushy and tufty with broom, gorse, and furze;\nwith myrtle, bilberry and whortleberry; with laurels; with heaths 20\nfeet high, and with the imported pine.",

        "And there, straight before us, lies the city, softly couched against the\nhill-side that faces the southern sea, and enjoying her ’kayf’ in the\nsinking sun. Her lower zone, though in the Temperates, is sub-tropical:\nTuscany is found in the mid-heights, while it is Scotland in the bleak\nwolds about Pico Ruivo (6,100 feet) and the Paül (Moorland) da Serra. I\nnow see some change since 1865. East of the yellow-washed, brown-bound\nfort of São Thiago Minor, the island patron, rises a huge white pile, or\nrather piles, the Lazaretto, with its three-arched bridge spanning the\nWady Gonçalo Ayres. The fears of the people forbid its being used,\nalthough separated from them by a mile of open space. This over-caution\nat Madeira, as at Tenerife, often causes great inconvenience to foreign\nresidents; moreover, it is directly opposed to treaty. There is a neat\ngroup, meat-market, abattoir, and fish-market–where there is ne’er a\nflat fish save those who buy–near those dreariest of academic groves,\nthe Praça Academica, at the east end proper, or what an Anglo-Indian\nwould term the ’native town.’ Here we see the joint mouth of the\ntorrent-beds Santa Luzia and João Gomes which has more than once deluged\nFunchal. Timid Funchalites are expecting another flood: the first was in\n1803, the second in 1842, and thus they suspect a cycle of forty\nyears. [Footnote: The guide-books make every twenty-fifth year a season\nof unusual rain, the last being 1879-80.] The lately repaired Sé\n(cathedral) in the heart of the mass is conspicuous for its steeple of\nazulejos, or varnished tiles, and for the ruddy painting of the\nblack basaltic façade, contrasting less violently with the huge\nsplotches of whitewash, the magpie-suit in which the church-architecture\nof the Madeiras and the Canaries delights. The São Francisco convent,\nwith its skull-lined walls, and the foundations of its proposed\nsuccessor, the law courts, have disappeared from the space adjoining the\nmain square; this chief promenade, the Praça da Constituição, is grown\nwith large magnolias, vinhaticos, or native mahogany (Persea\nIndica), and til-trees (Oreodaphne foetens), and has been\nsupplemented by the dwarf flower-garden (Jardim Novo) lately opened to\nthe west. The latter, I regret to say, caused the death of many noble\nold trees, including a fine palm; but Portuguese, let me repeat, have\nscant sympathy with such growth. The waste ground now belonging to the\ncity will be laid out as a large public garden with fountains and\nband-stands. Finally, that soundly abused ’Tower of Babel,’ alias\n’Benger’s Folly,’ built in 1796, has in the evening of its days been\nutilised by conversion into a signal-tower. So far so good.",
        "But the stump of caes, or jetty, which was dashed to pieces more\nthan a score of years ago, remains as it was; The landing-place calls\nloudly for a T-headed pier of concrete blocks, or a gangway supported\nupon wooden piles and metal pilasters: one does not remark the want in\nfine weather; one does bitterly on bad days. There has been no attempt\nto make a port or even a débarcadère by connecting the basaltic\nlump Loo (Ilheu) Fort with the Pontinha, the curved scorpion’s tail of\nrock and masonry, Messieurs Blandy’s coal stores, to the west. Big ships\nmust still roll at anchor in a dangerous open roadstead far off shore;\nand, during wet weather, ladies, well drenched by the surf, must be\nlanded with the aid of a crane in what should be the inner harbour. The\nbroken-down circus near Reid’s is to become a theatre, but whence the\nmoney is to come no one knows. The leper hospital cannot afford to make\nup more than nine or ten beds. The jail is in its old disgraceful state,\nand sadly wants reform: here the minimum of punishment would suffice; I\nnever saw the true criminal face, and many of the knick-knacks bought in\nMadeira are the work of these starving wretches. The Funchal Club gives\nperiodically a subscription ball, ’to ameliorate, if possible, the\ncondition of the prisoners at the Funchal jail’–asking strangers, in\nfact, to do the work of Government. The Praça da Rainha, a dwarf walk\nfacing the huge yellow Government House, alias Palacio de São Lourenço,\nhas been grown with mulberries intended for sericulture. Unfortunately,\nwhatever may here be done by one party (the ’ins’) is sure to be undone\nwhen the ’outs’ become ’ins.’ There has been no change in the ’Palace,’\nexcept that the quaint portraits of one-eyed Zargo, who has left many\ndescendants in the island, and of the earlier Captains-General,\ndignitaries who were at once civil and military, have been sent to the\nLisbon Exhibition. The queer old views of Machim’s landing and of\nFunchal Bay still amuse visitors. Daily observations for meteorology are\nhere taken at 9 A.M. and 3 and 9 P.M.; the observatory standing eighty\nfeet above sea-level.",
        "As our anchor rattles downwards, two excise boats with the national flag\ntake up their stations to starboard and port; and the boatmen are\ncarefully watched with telescopes from the shore. The wiser Spaniards\nhave made Santa Cruz, Tenerife, a free port. The health-officer\npresently gives us pratique, and we welcome the good ’monopolist,’\nMr. William Reid, and his son. The former, an Ayrshire\nman, has made himself proprietor of the four chief hostelries. Yates’s\nor Hollway’s in the Entrada da Cidade, or short avenue running\nnorth from the landing-place, has become a quasi-ruinous\ntelegraph-station. Reid’s has blossomed into the ’Royal Edinburgh;’ it\nis rather a tavern than an hotel, admitting the ’casuals’ from passing\nsteamers and men who are not welcome elsewhere. One of these, who called\nhimself a writer for the press, and who waxed insultingly drunk, made\nour hours bitter; but the owner has a satisfactory and sovereign way of\ndealing with such brutes. Miles’s has become the Carmo, and Schlaff’s\nthe ’German.’ The fourth, Santa Clara, retains her maiden name; the\nestablishment is somewhat collet monté, but I know none in Europe\nmore comfortable. There are many others of the second rank; and the\nHôtel Central, with its café-billiard and estaminet at the\ncity-entrance, is a good institution which might be made better.",

They are preferred to the slabs of Trieste and Northern\nItaly, which here, with the sole exception of the short Rua de\nBettencourt, are confined to flights of steps. The surfaces are greased\nby rags and are polished by the passage of ’cars’ or coach-sleighs,\nwhich irreverents call ’cow-carts;’ these vehicles, evidently suggested\nby the corsa, or common sleigh, consist of a black-curtained\ncarriage-body mounted on runners. The queer cobble-pavement, that\nresembles the mosaics of clams and palm-nuts further south, has sundry\nadvantages. It is said to relieve the horses’ back sinews; it is never\ndusty; the heaviest rain flows off it at once; nor is it bad walking\nwhen the kidney-stones are small.

He confesses to having kept a meagre diary, not\n intending to publish a mere book of travels, and drew his picture\n probably from recollection and diminutive note-books.",
        "I found Funchal open-hearted and open-handed as ever; and the pleasure\nof my stay was marred only by two considerations, both purely\npersonal.

        "They are perfectly happy in the Arabian desert, and even in Tenerife,\nwhere others feel as if living perpetually on the verge of high fever.",
        "To this ’little misery’ were added the displeasures of memory. Our last\nlong visit was in 1863, when the Conde de Farrobo ruled the land, and\nwhen the late Lord Brownlow kept open house at the beautiful Vigia. I\nneed hardly say that we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves: the impressions of\nthat good old time were deep and durable.",
        "Amongst other things, Governor Farrobo indulged his fair friends with a\ndisplay of the old jogo de canas, or running at the ring. The\nPraça Academica had been rigged out to serve as a tilting-yard, with a\ncentral alley of palisading and two ’stands,’ grand and little. The\npurpose was charitable, and the performers were circus-horses, mounted\nby professionals and amateurs, who thus ’renowned it’ before the public\nand their damas. The circlet, hanging to a line, equalled the\ndiameter of a small boy’s hat; and when the ’knight’ succeeded in\nbearing it off upon his pole, he rode up to be decorated by the hands of\na very charming person with a ribbon-baudrière of Bath dimensions\nand rainbow colours. Prizes were banal as medals after a modern war, and\nperhaps for the same purpose–to prevent unchristian envy, hatred, and\nmalice. Almost any trooper in an Anglo-Indian cavalry regiment would\nhave done better; but then he would have couched his bamboo spear\nproperly and would have put out his horse to speed–an idea which seemed\nto elude the Madeiran mind. The fête ended with a surprise less\nexpensive than that with which the Parisian restaurant astonishes the\ntravelling Britisher. A paper chandelier was suspended between two\nposts, of course to be knocked down, when out sprang an angry\nhunch-backed dwarf, who abused and fiercely struck at all straight backs\nwithin reach.",
        "Madeira is celebrated for excursions, which, however, are enjoyable only\nin finest weather. Their grand drawback is inordinate expense; you may\nvisit the whole seaboard of Morocco, and run to Tenerife and return for\nthe sum spent in a week of Madeiran travel. The following tour to the\nnorth of the island was marked out for us by the late Mr. Bewick; his\nreadiness to oblige, his extensive local knowledge, and his high\nscientific attainments caused his loss to be long felt in the Isle of\nWood. ’You make on the first day Santa Anna, on the opposite coast, a\nsix to eight hours’ stage by horse or hammock, passing through the grand\nscenery of the valleys Metade, Meiometade, and Ribeiro Frio.",

        " The next day takes you to Pico Ruivo, Rothhorn, Puy Rouge, or Red Peak,\n the loftiest in the island, whose summit commands a view of a hundred\n hills, and you again night at Santa Anna. The third stage is to the\n rocky gorge of São Vicente, which abounds in opportunities for\n neck-breaking. The next is a long day with a necessary guide to the\n Paül da Serra, the “Marsh of the Wold,” and the night is passed at\n Seixal, on the north-west coast, famous for its corniche-road. The\n fifth day conducts you along-shore to Ponta Delgada, and the last leads\n from this “Thin Point” through the Grand Curral back to Funchal.’",
        "I mention this excursion that the traveller may carefully avoid it in\nwinter, especially when we attempted the first part, February being the\nvery worst month. After many days of glorious weather the temper of the\natmosphere gave way; the mercury fell to 28.5, and we were indulged with\na succession of squalls and storms, mists and rain. The elemental rage,\nit is true, was that of your southern coquette, sharp, but short, and\nbroken by intervals of a loving relapse into caress. In the uplands and\non the northern coast, however, it shows the concentrated spleen and\ngloom of a climate in high European latitudes.",
        "We contented ourselves with the Caminho do Meio, the highway supposed to\nbisect the island, and gradually rising to the Rocket Road (Caminho\ndo Foguete) with a pleasant slope of 23°, or 1 in 2 1/3.

The name of these ’Lords of the Oak-ground’ is locally\nfamous. Chronicles mention a certain Count Antonio who flourished, or\nrather ’larked,’ circa A.D. 1500. In those days the land bore giants and\nheroes, and Madeiran blood had not been polluted by extensive\nmiscegenation with the negro. Anthony, who was feller than More of More\nHall, rode with ungirthed saddle over the most dangerous achadas\n(ledges); a single buffet of this furious knight smashed a wild boar,\nand he could lift his horse one palm off the ground by holding to a tree\nbranch. The estate has been wilfully wasted by certain of his\ndescendants. Comacha, famous for picnics, is a hamlet rich in seclusion\nand fine air; it might be utilised by those who, like the novel-heroes\nof Thackeray and Bulwer, deliberately sit down to vent themselves in a\nbook.",
        "Pico Ruivo was a distressing failure. We saw nothing save a Scotch mist,\nwhich wetted us to the bones; and we shivered standing in a slush of\nsnow which would have been quite at home in Upper Norwood. On this\ntopmost peak were found roots of the Madeiran cedar (Juniperus\nOxycedrus), showing that at one time the whole island was well\nwooded.",
        "We need not believe in the seven years’ fire; but the contrast of the\nsouthern coast with the northern, where the forests primaeval of\nLauraceae and Myrtaceae still linger, shows the same destructive process\nwhich injured Ireland and ruined Iceland. The peculiarity of these\nuplands, within certain limits, is that the young spring-verdure clothes\nthem before it appears in the lower and warmer levels. Here they catch a\nsunshine untarnished by watery vapour.",
        "During our short trip and others subsequent many a little village showed\nus the Madeiran peasant pure and simple. Both sexes are distressingly\nplain; I saw only one pretty girl amongst them. Froggy faces, dark\nskins, and wiry hair are the rule; the reason being that in the good old\ndays a gentleman would own some eighty slaves. [Footnote: As early as\n1552 the total of African imports amounted to 2,700.] But they are an\nindustrious and reproductive race.",
        "[Footnote: The following note of the census of 1878 was given to me by\nmy kind colleague, Mr. Consul Hayward:–",
        "Miss Taylor (Madeira, p. 58) reduces to 33,000–evidently a\nmisprint–this population about four times as dense as that of\nPortugal.]",
        "Many Madeirans highly distinguished themselves in the Dutch-Brazilian\nwars, especially the ’Castriota Lusitano.’ His name is unknown; he\nchanged it when he left his islet home, the townlet Santa Cruz. These\nislanders were the model ’navvies’ of the age before steam: Albuquerque\napplied for Madeirans when he formed the barbarous project of diverting\nthe Nile to the Red Sea. Their descendants are beggars from the cradle;\nbut they beg with a good grace, and not with a curse or an insult like\nthe European ’asker’ when refused: moreover, the mendicant pest is not\nnow over-prevalent. In the towns they cheat and pilfer; they gamble in\nthe streets; they drink hard on Saturdays and Sundays, and at times they\nmurder one another. Liquor is cheap; a bottle of aguardente or\ncaxaça (new raw rum) costs only fivepence, and the second\ndistillation ninepence. I heard of one assault upon an English girl, but\nstrangers are mostly safe amongst them. Their extreme civility,\ndocility, and good temper, except when spoilt by foreigners, makes it a\npleasure to deal with them. They touch their hats with a frank smile,\nnot the Spanish scowl near Gibraltar, or of Santa Cruz, Tenerife. The\nmen are comparatively noiseless; a bawling voice startles you like a\npistol-shot. I rarely heard a crying child or a scolding woman offering\n’eau bénite à la Xantippe;’ even the cocks and hens tied to old shoes\ncackle with reserve. The climate tames everything from Dom to\ndonkey. Except in January and February it is still, intensely still–the\nvery leaves seem to hang motionless. This softness shows itself\nespecially in the language, which has none of the abruptness of European\nPortuguese. The sound is a drawling singsong; the articulation is\npeculiar, and the vocabulary is in some points confined to the Island.",
        "The country people, an active, agile, unmuscular race, mostly preserve\nthe old national dress. Some men still wear, and both sexes once wore,\nthe ridiculous carapuça, or funnel-cap with a rat-tail for a\ntassel. The rest of the toilet consists of homespun cottons, shirts and\nknickerbockers, with buff shoes or boots broad-soled and heelless. The\ntraveller who prefers walking should always use this chaussure,\nand the ’little girl in topboots’ is still a standing joke. The women\naffect parti-coloured petticoats of home-made baize or woollen stuff,\ndyed blue, scarlet, brown, or orange; a scalloped cape of the same\nmaterial bound with some contrasting hue; and a white or coloured\nhead-kerchief, sometimes topped by the carapuça, but rarely by\nthe vulgar ’billycock’ of the Canaries. In the villages crimson shawls\nand capes are general, and they cover the head like mantillas.",
        "The peasant’s cot is of the simplest, and those in the plantations\nsuggest African huts. Even the best houses, except when copied from the\nEnglish, are scantily furnished; and little beyond a roof is absolutely\nwanted. The home of the cazeiro, or peasant tenant practically\nirremovable, is whitewashed and thatched, the straw forming a crest\nalong the ridge. It covers only one room, converted by a curtain into\n’but’ and ’ben.’ A parental bed, a rickety table, and two or three\nstools or settles compose the necessaries; the ornaments are the saints\nhanging to the walls, and for windows there are shutters with a sliding\npanel. The feeding apparatus consists of a kind of quern for grinding\ncorn, especially maize,",
        "[Foonote: The word is of doubtful origin, generally derived from the\nHaytian mahiz. But in northern Europe mayse (Irish maise)\nbread, and the Old High German maz (Hind. mans) means meat]",
        "which, however, is now too dear for general use; sundry vegetable\nbaskets, and an iron pot for boiling fish and porridge, arums\n(Inhame), and koko (Colocasia esculenta). They have some\npeculiar dishes, such as the bolo de mel, a ginger cake eaten at\nChristmas, and the famous carne de vinho e alhos (meat of wine\nand garlic). The latter is made by marinating pork in vinegar with\ngarlic and the herb called oragão (origanum, or wild marjoram);\nit is eaten broiled, and even Englishmen learn to appreciate a dish\nwhich is said to conversar. The stewed fowl with rice is also\nnational. As everywhere in Portugal, bacalháo,",
        "[Footnote: Brevoort derives the word from baculus, the stick\nwhich keeps the fish open; others from the German boloh, fish. In\n1498 Seb. Cabot speaks of ’great fishes which the natives call\nBaccalaos.’ He thus makes the word ’Indian;’ whereas Dr. Kohl, when\nnoticing the cod-fisheries of Europe, declares that in Germany it is\nBackljau. Mr. O. Crawford (Portugal, Old and New. London:\nC. Kegan Paul, 1880) rightly notes that ’bacalháo’ applies equally to\nthe fresh fish and the dried fish.]",
        "or dried cod-fish, cooked with garlic or onions, is deservedly a\nfavourite: it contains more nourishment than beef. There is superior\noriginality amongst the doces (sweetmeats) for which Madeira was\nonce world-famous; and in the queques (cakes), such as\nlagrimas-cakes, cocoanut-cakes, and rabanadas, the Moorish\n’rabanat,’ slabs of wheat bread soaked in milk, fried in olive oil, and\nspread with honey. The drink is water, or, at best, agua-pé, the\nlast straining of the grape. Many peasants, who use no stimulant during\nthe day, will drink on first rising a dram para espantar o Diabo\n(to frighten the Devil), as do the Congoese paramatar o bicho (to\nkill the worm).",
        "Here cleanliness is not next to godliness. People bathe only in\nhot weather–the rule of man and the lower mammalia. A quick and\nintelligent race they are, like the Spaniards and Bedawi Arabs, a\ncontradiction in religious matters: the Madeiran believes in little or\nnothing, yet he hates a Calvinista like the very fiend. They have\nlost, as the census shows, something of their extreme ignorance, and\nhave abated their worst superstitions since the expulsion of the Jesuits\nby Pombal (1759), and the reforms of 1820, 1828, and 1835. In the latter\nyear Dom Pedro suppressed monkeries and nunneries by disallowing masses,\nand by pensioning the holy tenantry with 9 dols. per mensem, afterwards,\nreduced to 5 dols. In 1863 the bishop, Dom Patricio Xavier de Moura, did\nhis best to abolish the pretty refocaria (the hearth-lighter),\nwho, as Griraldus hath it, extinguished more virtue than she lit fires;\nand now the rectory is seldom gladdened by the presence of noisy little\nnephews and nieces. The popular morals, using the word in its limited\nsense, were peculiar. The number of espostos que não se sabe quem,\nsão seus pais (fatherless foundlings) outnumbered those born de\nlegitimo matrimonio; and few of the gudewives prided themselves upon\nabsolute fidelity. This flaw, which in England would poison all domestic\naffection, was not looked upon in a serious light by the islandry. The\npriesthood used to lament the degeneracy of the age and sigh for the\nfine times of foros e fogos, the rights and fires of an\nauto-da-fé. The shepherds have now learned to move with the times\nand to secure the respect of their sheep. Imagine being directed to\nParadise by a reverend man who gravely asks you where and what Hanover\nis.",
        "Another important change is being brought about by the emigrant. During\nthe last few years the old rule has been relaxed, and whole families\nhave wandered abroad in search of fortune. Few Madeirans in these days\nship for the Brazil, once the land of their predilection. They prefer\nCape Town, Honolulu, the Antilles, and especially Demerara; and now the\n’Demerarista’ holds the position of the ’Brasileiro’ in Portugal and the\n’Indio’ or ’Indiano’ of the Canaries: in time he will buy up half the\nisland.",
        "In 1862 we hired rowing and sailing boats to visit the southern coast\neast and west of Funchal. For the last twelvemonth Mr. Blandy’s\nsteam-tug Falcão has carried travellers to and fro: it is a great\nconvenience to the lazy sightseer, who cares only to view the outside of\nthings, and here the outsides are the only things worth viewing.",
        "We will begin with the western trip to Paül do Mar, affording a grand\nprospect of basaltic pillars and geological dykes, and of the three\nfeatures–rocky, sylvan, and floral. Steaming by the mouth of the wady\nor ravine Sao João, whose decayed toy forts, S. Lazaro and the\npalace-battery, are still cumbered with rusty cannon, we pass under the\ncliff upon whose brow stand some of the best buildings. These are the\nPrincess Dona Maria Amelia’s Hospicio, or Consumptive Hospital,\nbuilt on Mr. Lamb’s plans and now under management of the French\nsoeurs, whose gull wings are conspicuous at Funchal; the Asylo,\nor Poor-house, opened in 1847 for the tempering of mendicancy; and\nfacing it, in unpleasant proximity, the Portuguese cemetery, decorated\nas to its entrance with sundry skulls and cross-bones, and showing its\ntall cypresses to the bay. Here comes the Quinta (Comtesse) Lambert,\nonce occupied by Queen Adelaide. The owner doubled the rent;\nconsequently Las Angustías (the Agonies), as it was called from\nan old chapel, has been unrented for the last two years. A small\npleasaunce overhanging a perpendicular cliff, and commanding a glorious\nview, shows the Quinta da Vigia, lately bought by Mr. Hollway for\n8,000l., and let at 500l. to 1,000l, a year. Nothing more\ncharming than its grounds, which attracted H.I.M. of Austria, and\nnow the charming Countess Tyszkiewicz. Landward it faces the Rua\nda Imperatriz, which leads to the ’Loo Fields.’",
        "The study of basaltic pillars at once begins: Loo Fort is partly built\nupon them. Beyond Vigia cliff we pass in succession three jagged\nisland-rocks, called ’gurgulhos,’ or black-beetles (curculio),\nwhich, like the opposite foreshore, admirably show the formation. As a\nrule the columns are quadrangular; I saw but few pentagons and\nhexagons. We cast a look at a spouter of circular shape, the Forja, and\nthe Forno, a funnel-formed blowing-rock. The cliff is pierced with a\nmultitude of caves, large and small, and their regular arches look as if\nthe ejected matter, as happens with lava, had cooled and solidified\nabove, while still flowing out in a fiery torrent below. Mostly,\nhowever, they are the work of wind and water.",
        "Then comes the old Gurgulho Fort–a dwarf square, partly thatched and\nconverted into a private dwelling. It lies below Signal Hill, with its\ndwarf ruined tower, a lumpy parasitic crater whose western slopes have\nbeen ruined by disforesting. Between the two runs the New Road, which\nowes its being to the grape-famine of 1852. It is the ’Rotten Row’ of\nFunchal, where horses tread the earth instead of skating and sliding\nover the greased pebbles; and where fair amazons charge upon you like\nIndian irregular cavalry. Five miles long, it is the only level line of\nany extent in Madeira, and it wants but one thing–prolongation. The\nlion in the path, however, is Cape Girâo, which would cost a treasure to\n’tunnel’ or to cut into a corniche.",
        "The next feature is the Ponta da Cruz, a fantastic slice of detached\nbasalt. Here, at the southernmost point of the island, the Descobridores\nplanted a cross, and every boatman doffs his cap to its little iron\ndescendant. Beyond it comes the Praia Formosa, a long line of shingle\nwashed down by a deep ravine. All these brooks have the same origin, and\ntheir extent increases the importance of the wady. In 1566 the French\npirates under De Montluc, miscalled heretics (hereges Ugnotas)\nlanded here, as, indeed, every enemy should. The colour of ’Fair Reach’\nis ashen grey, scolloped with cinder-black where the creamy foam breaks:\nfor beauty it wants only golden sands, and for use a few bathing\nmachines.",
        "The next notable feature is the Ribeira dos Soccorridos (’River of the\nRescued’), where two of the Zargo’s lads were with difficulty saved from\nthe violent stream then flowing. It is now provided with a long\nbridge-causeway of three arches, approached by a chapel, Nossa Senhora\ndas Victorias, whose tiled and pillared porch reminds one of\nIstria. This bed is the drain of the Grand Curral, called by the people\n’Das Freiras,’ because the holy women here took refuge from the\nplundering French ’Lutherans.’ The favourite picnic-ground is reached in\nthree hours from Funchal by two roads, both winding amongst the\npap-shaped hillocks which denote parasitic cones, and both abutting upon\nthe ravine-side, east and west. The latter, skirting the Pico dos Bodes\n(of he-goats), a tall cone seen from near Funchal, and sentinelling the\ngreat gap, is the joy-for-ever of midshipmites. To the horror of the\nburriqueiro, or syce, they gallop hired screws, high-heeled as their\ngrandams, over paths at which an English stag would look twice; and for\na dollar they secure as much chance of a broken limb, if not of ’going\nto pot with a young lady’ (Captain Basil Hall’s phrase), as reasonable\nbeings can expect.",
        "The Grand Curral is the central vent of a volcano originally submarine,\nand, like the Peak of Tenerife, of the age miocene. Fossils of that\nepoch have been found upon the crater-walls of both. Subsequent\nmovements capped it with subaerial lavas and conglomerates; and wind and\nweather, causing constant degradation, deepened the bowl and almost\nobliterated signs of igneous action. This is general throughout Madeira;\nthe only craters still noticed by guide-books are the Lagos (Lake) de\nSanto Antonio da Serra, east of Funchal and west of Machico, 500 feet\nacross by 150 deep; and, secondly, the Fanal to the north-west, about\n5,000 feet above sea-level. The Curral floor, smooth and bald, is cut by\na silvery line of unsunned rivulet which at times must swell to a\ntorrent; and little white cots like egg-shells are scattered around the\nnormal parish-church, Nossa Senhora do Livramento. The basin-walls, some\n2,000 feet high and pinnacled by the loftiest peaks in the island, are\nprofusely dyked and thickly and darkly forested; and in the bright blue\nair, flecked with woolpack, Manta, the buzzard, and frequent kestrels\npass to and fro like flies.",
        "Beyond the Soccorridos lies the charming valley of Camara dos Lobos,\npopularly Cama di Lobos,",
        "[Footnote: It is placed west instead of east of Cape Girao in the\nConoise Handbook of Madeira, by the Rev. J. M. Rendell. London:\nKegan Paul and Co., 1881.]",
        "the lair of the sea-wolves, or seals. With its vivid lines of\nsugar-cane, its terraces, its fine remains of forest vegetation, and its\ndistances of golden lights, of glazed blue half-lights, and of purple\nshades, it looks like a stage-rake, a décor de théatre.\nTunny-fishing, wine-making, and sugar-boiling have made it,\nfrom a ’miserable place,’ a wealthy townlet whose tall white houses\nwould not disgrace a city; two manufactories show their craft by heaps\nof bagasse, or trash; and the deep shingly bay, defended by a\ngurgulho of basaltic pillars, is covered with piscator’s gear and\nwith gaily painted green boats. ’Seal’s Lair’ was the model district of\nwine-production, like its neighbour on the north-western upland,\nCampanario, famous for its huge Spanish chestnut: both were, however,\nwasted by the oidium of 1852. In 1863 it partially recovered, under the\nfree use of sulphur; but now it has been ravaged by the more dangerous\nphylloxera, which is spreading far faster than Mr. Henry Vizetelly\nsupposes.",
        "[Footnote: Facts about Port and Madeira, by Henry Vizetelly, who\nvisited the island in 1877. The papers first appeared in the (old\noriginal) Pall Mall Gazette (August 26-September 4,1877), and then were\npublished in a volume by Ward and Lock, 1880]",
        "The only cure of this pest known to Madeira is the troublesome and\nexpensive process practised by a veteran oenologist, Mr. Leacock.",
        "He bares every vine-root, paints it with turpentine and resin, and\ncarefully manures the plant to restore its stamina. Mr. Taylor, of\nFunchal, has successfully defended the vines about his town-house by the\nsimple tonic of compost. But the Lobos people have, methinks, done\nwisely to uproot the infected plant wholesale: indeed, from this point\nto the furthest west we hardly saw a vine-stock. They have supplied its\nplace with garden-stuff, an article which always finds a ready sale. The\nisland is annually visited by at least 500 English ships, and there is a\nsteady demand for ’green meat.’ I am not aware that beet-root, one of\nthe best antiscorbutics, has been extensively tried.",
        "Off Cama di Lobos is the best tunny-fishing. It is practised quite\ndifferently from the Mediterranean style; here the labyrinth of nets is\nsupplanted by the line of 300 fathoms. At night the bright fires on\nboard the fishing-canoes make travellers suspect that spears, grains, or\nharpoons are used. This, however, is not the case; line-fishing is\nuniversal, and the lights serve mostly for signals.",
        "From Cama di Lobos the huge hill-shoulder to the west, whose face, Cabo\nGirão, must be ascended by a rough, steep incline. Far easier to view\nthe scene from a boat. Cape ’Turn Again’ is the furthest occidental\npoint reached by the far-famed exploration of O Zargo. The profile\nsuggests it to be the northern half of a dome once regular and complete,\nbut cut in two, as a cake might be, by time and the elements. It has the\nname of being the ’highest sea-wall in the world’ (1,934 feet); if so,\nlittle Madeira can boast her ’unicum.’  Beaching the summit, you either\nstand up regardant or you peer couchant, as your nerves incline, down a\nheight whose merit is to be peculiarly high. Facetious picnickers roll\nover the edge-rocks which may kill the unfortunates gathering\ngrass–dreadful trade!–upon the dizzy ledges. There are also quarrymen\nwho extract cantaria-slabs for sills and copings from the four\nsquare apertures which look afar like mortice-holes; and a fine marbled\nstone, white, blue, and ruddy, has been taken from this part of the\ncliff-face. Finally, there is a little knot of tiny huts which sticks\nlike a wasp-nest to the very foot of the huge wall.",
        "Seen from the deep indigo-blue water, that turns leek-green in the\nshallows, Cape Girão (’they turn’) is a grand study of volcanic\ndykes. They are of all sizes, from a rope to a cable multiplied a\nthousandfold; and they stand out in boldest dado-relief where the soft\nbackground of tufa, or laterite, has been crumbled away by rain and\nstorm-blast. Some writers have described them as ramifying like a tree\nand its branches, and crossing and interlacing like the ties of a\nbuilding; as if sundry volcanic vents had a common centre below. I saw\nnothing of this kind. The dykes of light grey material, sometimes\nhollowed out and converted into gutters by falling water, appeared to\nhave been shot up in distinct lines, and the only crossing was where a\nslip or a fault occurred.",
        "A front view of Cape Girão shows that it is supported on either side,\neast and west, by buttresses of a darker rock: the eastern dip at an\nangle of 45°, the western range between 20° above and 40° below. The\ngreat central upheaval seems to have pushed its way through these older\nstrata, once straight, now inclined. The layers of the more modern\nformation–lavas and scoriae–are horizontal; sheets of sub-columnar,\ncompact basalt have been spread upon and have crushed down to\npaper-thickness their beds of bright red tufa, here and there white with\na saline effervescence. Of such distinct superimpositions we counted in\none place five; there may have been many more. All are altered soils, as\nis shown by remains of trees and decayed vegetation.",
        "Beyond Cabo Girão the scenery is grand enough, but monotonous in the\nextreme. The island is girt by a sea-wall, more or less perpendicular;\nfrom this coping there is a gentle upslope, the marvellous terracing for\ncultivation being carried up to the mountain-tops. The lower levels are\neverywhere dotted with white farmhouses and brown villages. The colours\nof the wall are the grey of basalt, the purple of volcanic\nconglomerates, and the bright reds and yellows of tufas. Here and there,\nhowever, a thread of water pouring from the summit, or bursting from the\nflank, fills a cavity which it has worn and turned for itself; and from\nthis reservoir the industrious peasant has diverted sufficient to\nirrigate his dwarf terraced plots of cane, bananas, yams, or other\nvegetables; not a drop of the precious fluid is wasted, and beds are\nlaid out wherever the vivifying influence can extend. The water-race\ndown the wall is shown by mosses and lichens, pellitories, and\nrock-plants; curtains and hangers; slides, shrubs, and weepers of the\nmost vivid green, which give life and beauty to the sternest stone.",
        "The only breaks in this regular coast-wall are the spines and spurs\nprotruding seawards; the caverns in which the surges break and roar, and\nthe ribeiras or ravines whose heads are far inland, and whose\nlines show grey second distances and blue third distances. At their\nmouths lie the sea-beaches and the settlements: the latter, with their\ntowered churches and their large whitewashed houses, look more like\ndetached bits of city than our notion of villages. Other places are\nbuilt upon heaps of débris washed down from the heights, which\nhold out no promise of not falling again. The huts scattered amidst the\ncultivation remind one of nothing but Africa. In some places, too, a\nsoft layer of tufa has been hollowed for man’s abode, suggesting, like\nthe caves, a fine old smuggling-trade. As many as eight doors may be\ncounted side by side. In other places a rock-ledge, or even a detached\nboulder, has been converted into a house by masonry-walls. We shall\nseldom see these savageries on the eastern coast of the island.",
        "The seafaring settlements are connected with the interior by breakneck\npaths and by rude steps, slippery with green moss. The people seem to\ndelight in standing, like wild goats, upon the dizziest of ’jumpy’\npeaks; we see boys perched like birds upon impossible places, and men\nwalking along precipice-faces apparently pathless. The villages are\njoined to one another by roads which attempt to follow the sea-line; the\nchasms are spanned by the flimsiest wooden bridges, and the cliff is\ntunnelled or cut into a corniche.",
        "After disembarking passengers at Ponta d’Agua and Ribeira Nova we passed\nthe great landslip of 1805, Lugar do Baixo. The heap of ruins has long\nbeen greened over. The cause was evidently a waterfall which now\ndescends freely; it must have undermined the cliff, which in time would\ngive way. So in the Brazil they use water instead of blasting powder: a\ntrench is dug behind the slice of highland to be removed; this is filled\nby the rains and the pressure of the column throws the rock bodily\ndown. We shall find this cheap contrivance useful when ’hydraulicking’\nthe auriferous clays of the Gold Coast.",
        "Then we came to Ponta do Sol, the only remarkable site on the trip,\nfamous for bodice-making and infamous for elephantiasis. Here a huge\ncolumn of curiously contorted basalt has been connected by a solid\nhigh-arched causeway with the cliff, which is equally remarkable,\nshowing a central boss of stone with lines radiating quaquaversally.\nThere are outer steps and an inner flight leading under\na blind archway, the latter supplied with a crane. The landing in the\nlevadia, or surf, is abominable and a life-boat waits accidents\noutside. It works with the heavy Madeiran oars, square near the grip and\nprovided with a board into whose hole the pin fits. The townlet, capital\nof the ’comarca,’ fronted by its little Alameda and a strip of beach\nupon which I should prefer to debark, shows a tall factory-chimney,\nnoting the sugar-works of Wilhabram Bros. There is a still larger\nestablishment at the Serra d’Agoa in the Arco [Footnote: Arco\n(bow, arch) is locally applied to a ridge or to the district bounded by\nit.] da Calheta (Arch of the Creeklet), a property of the Visconde de\nCalçada. The guide-books mention iron pyrites and specular iron in small\nquantities behind Ponta do Sol.",
        "Passing the deep ravine, Ribeiro Fundo, and the Ponta da Galéra, with\nits rooky spur, we sighted Jardim do Mar, a village on a mound of\ndébris with black walls of dry stone defending the terraces from\nsurf and spray. The furthest point, where we halted half an hour, is\n’Paül do Mar’ (Swamp of the Sea), apparently a misnomer. It is the port\nof the Fajãa da Ovelha (Ewe’s landslip), whose white tenements we see\nperched on the estreito, or tall horizon-slope. The large\nharbour-town is backed by a waterfall which may prove disastrous to it;\nits lands were formerly famous for the high-priced malvasia\nCandida–Candia malmsey.",
        "The day had been delightful, ’June weather’ in fickle April. The sea was\nsmooth as glass, and the skies, sunny in the morning and starry at\nnight, were canopied during the day by clouds banking up from the\nsouth-east. The western wind blew crisp and cold. This phase of climate\noften lasts till the end of June, and renders early summer endurable at\nMadeira. The steam-tug was more punctual going than coming. She left\nFunchal at 9 A.M., reached Paül do Mar at half-past twelve, covering\nsome twenty-one direct knots; and returned to her moorings, crowded with\npassengers, at half-past five, instead of half-past four. My companion,\nM. Dahse, and I agreed that the coast was well worth seeing.",
        "It would hardly be fair to leave Madeira without a visit to Machico, the\nscene of Machim’s apocryphal death. The realists derive the name from\nAlgarvan Monchique. I have made it on foot, on horseback, and by boat,\nbut never so comfortably as when on board the steam-tug\nFalcão. Garajáo, whose ruddy rocks of volcanic tufa, embedding\nbits of lava, probably entitled it ’Brazenhead,’ is worth inspecting\nfrom the sea. Possibly the classic term ’Purple Islands’ may have arisen\nfrom the fiery red hue of the volcanic cliffs seen at the sunset\nhour. Like Girão, the middle block of Tern Point is horizontally\nstratified, while the western abutment slopes to the water. Eastward,\nhowever, there has been immense degradation; half the dome has been\nshaken down and washed away; while a succession of upheavals and\nearthquakes has contorted the strata in the strangest manner. Seen from\nFunchal, the profile of Garajáo is that of an elephant’s head, the\nmahaut sitting behind it in the shape of a red-brown boss, the expanded\nhead of a double dyke seaming the tufas of the eastern face. We\ndistinguish on the brow two ’dragons,’ puny descendants of the\naboriginal monsters. Beyond Garajáo the shore falls flat, and the upland\nsoil is red as that of Devonshire. It is broken by the Ponta da\nOliveira, where there is ne’er an olive-tree, and by the grim ravine of\nPorto de Caniço o Bispo, the ’bishop’ being a basaltic pillar with mitre\nand pontifical robes sitting in a cave of the same material. I find a\nbetter episkopos at Ponta da Atalaia, ’Sentinel Point.’ Head,\nprofile, and shoulders are well defined; the hands rest upon the knees,\nand the plaited folds of the dress are well expressed by the basaltic\ncolumns of the central upheaval. Beyond Porto Novo do Cal, with its old\nfort and its limekiln, is the chapel of São Pedro, famous for its\nromeiro, ’pattern’ or pilgrimage for St. Peter’s Day. June 29 is\nkept even at Funchal by water-excursions; it is homage enough to pay a\npenny and to go round the ships.",
        "We anchored and screamed abominably off Santa Cruz, the capital of its\n’comarca.’ The townlet lies on the left of a large ravine, whose upper\nbed contains the Madre d’Agoa, or water-reservoir. The settlement,\nfronted by its line of trees, the Alameda, and by its broad beach\nstrewed with boats, consists of white, red, and yellow houses, one-,\ntwo-, and three-storied; of a white-steepled church and of a new\nmarket-place. East of it, and facing south, lies the large house of ’the\nSquire’ (Mr. H. B. Blandy), a villa whose feet are washed by the waves;\nthe garden shows the lovely union, here common, of pine and palm. The\nlatter, however, promises much and performs little, refusing, like the\nolive, to bear ripe fruit. Beyond the Squire’s is the hotel, approached\nby a shady avenue: it is the most comfortable in the island after the\nfour of Funchal.",
        "[Footnote: There are only two other country inns, both on the northern\ncoast. The first is at Santa Anna, some 20 miles north-north-east of the\ncapital; the second at São Vicente, to the north-west. All three are\nkept by natives of Madeira. Unless you write to warn the owners that you\nare coming, the first will be a ’banyan-day,’ the second comfortable\nenough. This must be expected; it is the Istrian ’Città Nuova, chi porta\ntrova.’]",
        "Santa Cruz has a regular spring-season; and the few residents of the\ncapital frequent it to enjoy the sea-breeze, which to-day (April 23)\nblows a trifle too fresh.",
        "We then pass the Ponta da Queimada, whose layers of basalt are deeply\ncaverned, and we open the Bay of Machico. The site, a broad, green and\nriant valley, with a high background, is softer and gayer than that of\nFunchal. It has been well sketched in ’Views in the Madeiras,’ and by\nthe Norwegian artist Johan F. Eckersberg in folio, with letterpress by\nMr. Johnson of the guide-book. The ’Falcon’ anchors close to the\nlanding-stairs, under a grim, grey old fort, O Desembarcadouro,\noriginally a tower, and now apparently a dwelling-place. The\ndébarcadère has the usual lamp and the three iron chains intended\nto prevent accidents.",
        "The prosperous little fishing-village, formerly the capital of\nthe Tristam, lies as usual upon a wady, the S. Gonsales, and\nconsists of a beach, an Alameda, a church with a square tower, and some\ngood houses. Twenty years ago the people had almost forgotten a story\nwhich named the settlement; and the impromptu cicerone carried strangers\nwho sought the scene of Machim’s death to the Quinta de Santa Anna,",
        "[Footnote: Here Mr. White made some of his meteorological\nobservations. VOL. I.]",
        "well situated upon a land-tongue up the valley; to the parish church,\nwhich was in a state of chronic repair, and in fact to every place but\nthe right. The latter is now supposed to be the little Ermida\n(chapel) de N. S. da Visitação. with its long steps and\nwall-belfry on the beach and the left jaw of the wady: it is a mere\nhumbug, for the original building was washed away by the flood of\n1803. In those days, too, visitors vainly asked for the ’remains of\nMachim’s cross, collected and deposited here by Robert Page, 1825.’  Now\na piece of it is shown in frame. About 1863 I was told that a member of\nthe family, whose name, it is said, still survives about Bristol, wished\nto mark the site by a monument–decidedly encouraging to\nGretna-Greenism.",
        "From Machico Bay we see the Fora and other eastern outliers which form\nthe Madeiran hatchet-handle. Some enthusiasts prolong the trip to what\nis called the ’Fossil-bed,’ whose mere agglomerations of calcareous\nmatter are not fossils at all. The sail, however, gives fine views of\nthe ’Deserters’ (Desertas), beginning with the ’Ship Rock,’ a\nstack or needle mistaken in fogs for a craft under sail. Next to it lies\nthe Ilheu Chão, the Northern or Table Deserta, not unlike Alderney or a\nPérigord pie. Deserta Grande has midway precipices 2,000 feet high,\nbisected by a lateral valley, where the chief landing is. Finally, Cu de\nBugio (as Cordeyro terms it) is in plan a long thin strip, and in\nelevation a miniature of its big brother, with the additions of sundry\njags and peaks.",
        "The group is too windy for cereals, but it grows spontaneously orchil\nand barilla (Mesembryanthemum nodiflorum), burnt for soda. Few\nstrangers visit it, and many old residents have never attempted the\nexcursion. It is not, however, unknown to sportsmen, who land–with\nleave–upon the main island and shoot the handsome ’Deserta petrels,’\nthe cagarras (Puffinus major, or sheerwater), the rabbits,\nthe goats that have now run wild, and possibly a seal. A poisonous\nspider is here noticed by the guide-books, and the sea supplies the\nedible pulvo (octopus) and the dreaded urgamanta. This\nhuge ray (?) enwraps the swimmer in its mighty double flaps and drags\nhim to the bottom, paralysing him by the wet shroud and the dreadful\nstare of its hideous eyes.",
        "MADEIRA (continued)–CHRISTMAS–SMALL INDUSTRIES–\nWINE–DEPARTURE FOR TENERIFE.",
        "The Christmas of 1881 at Madeira could by no means be called gay. The\nforeign colony was hospitable, as usual, with dinners, dances, and\nChristmas trees. But amongst the people festivities seemed to consist\nchiefly of promenading one’s best clothes about the military band and\nfiring royal salutes, not to speak of pistols and squibs. The noise\nreminded me of Natal amongst the Cairene Greeks; here, as in the Brazil,\nif you give a boy a copper he expends it not on lollipops, but on\nfireworks. We wished one another boas entradas, the ’buon’\nprincipio’ of Italy, and remembered the procession of seventeen years\nago. The life-sized figures, coarsely carved in wood and dressed in real\nclothes, were St. Francis, St. Antonio de Noto, a negro (Madeiran\nCatholics recognise no ’aristocracy of the skin’); a couple of married\nsaints (for even matrimony may be sanctified), SS. Bono and Luzia, with\nhalf a dozen others. The several platforms, carried by the brotherhoods\nin purple copes, were preceded by the clergy with banners and crosses\nand were followed by soldiers. The latter then consisted of a battalion\nof caçadores, 480 to 500 men, raised in the island and commanded\nby a colonel entitled ’Military Governor.’ They are small, dark figures\ncompared with the burly Portuguese artillerymen stationed at the Loo\nFort and São Thiago Battery, and they are armed with old English\nsniders.",
        "Behind the Tree of Penitence and the crosses of the orders came an Ecce\nHomo and a bit of the ’true Cross’ shaded by a canopy. The peasantry,\nwho crowded into town–they do so no longer–knelt to kiss whatever was\nkissable, and dodged up and down the back streets to gain\nopportunities. Even the higher ranks were afoot; they used to acquire in\ninfancy a relish for these mild amusements. And one thing is to be noted\nin favour of the processions; the taste of town-decoration was\nexcellent, and the combinations of floral colours were admirable.\nPerhaps there is too much of nosegay in Madeira, making us\nremember the line–",
        "  Posthume, non bene olet qui bane semper olet.",
        "I went to the Jesuit church to hear the predica, or sermon. The\npreacher does not part his hair ’amidships,’ or display cambric and\ndiamond-rings, yet his manner is none the less maniérée. For him\nand his order, in Portugal as in Spain, the strictest minutiae of\ndemeanour and deportment are laid down. The body should be borne\nupright, but not stuck up, and when the congregation is addressed the\nchest is slightly advanced. The dorsal region must never face the\nSacrament; this would be turning one’s back, as it were, upon the\nDeity. The elbow may not rest upon the cushion. The head, held erect,\nbut not haughtily, should move upon the atlas gently and suavely,\navoiding ’lightness’ and undue vivacity. The lips must not smile; but,\nwhen occasion calls for it, they may display a saintly joy. The eyebrows\nmust not be raised too high towards the hair-roots; nor should one be\nelevated while the other is depressed. The voice should be at times\ntremolando, and the tone periodically ’sing-song.’  Finally, the\neyes are ordered to wander indiscriminately, and with all pudicity, over\nthe whole flock, and never to be fixed upon a pretty lamb.",
        "Our countrymen are not over-popular in Portugal or in Madeira; such\nmortal insults as those offered by Byron, to name only the corypheus,\nwill rankle and can never be forgotten. In this island strangers,\nespecially Englishmen, have a bad practice of not calling upon the two\ngovernors, civil and military. The former, Visconde de Villa Mendo, is\nexceptional; he likes England and the English. As a rule the highest\nclasses mix well with strangers; not so the medio ceto who, under\na constitutional régime, rule the roast. Men with small fixed\nincomes have little to thank us for; we make things dear, and we benefit\nonly the working men. Bourgeois exactions have driven both French ships\nand American whalers to Tenerife; and many of them would do the same\nwith the English and German residents and visitors of Funchal. Not a few\nhave noble and historic names, whose owners are fallen into extreme\npoverty. Professor Azevedo’s book is also a nobiliaire de\nMadère. The last generation used to be remarkably prim and precise,\nin dress as in language and manner. They never spoke of ’hogs’ or\n’horns,’ and they wore the skimpy waistcoats and the regulation whiskers\nof Wellington’s day. The fair sex appeared only at ’functions,’ at\nchurch, and at the Sunday promenade in the Place. The moderns dress\nbetter than their parents, who affected the most violent colours, an\nexceedingly pink pink upon a remarkably green green; and the shape of\nthe garment was an obsolete caricature of London and Paris. They no\nlonger assume the peculiar waddle, looking as if the lower limbs were\nunequal to the weight of the upper story; but the walk never equals that\nof the Spanish woman. This applies to Portugal as well. The strong\npoints, here as in the Peninsula, are velvety black eyes and blue-black\nhair dressed à la Diane. It is still the fashion, as at Lisbon,\nto look somewhat boudeuse when abroad, by way of hint that man\nmust not expect too much; yet these cross faces at home or with\nintimates are those of bonnes enfants. Lastly, the dark\ncomplexions and the irregular features do not contrast well with the\ncharming faces and figures of Tenerife, who mingle the beauty of\nGuanchedom with that of Spain and Ireland.",
        "The list of public amusements at Funchal is not extensive. Years ago the\ntheatre was converted into a grain-store, and now it is a\nwine-store. The circus of lumber has been transferred from under the\nPeak Fort to near the sea; it mostly lacks men and horses. The Germans\nhave a tolerable lending library; and the public bibliotheca in\nthe Town House, near the Jesuit church, is rich in old volumes, mostly\ncollected from religious houses. In 1851 the books numbered 1,800; now\nthey may be 2,000; kept neat and clean in two rooms of the fine solid\nold building. Of course the collection is somewhat mixed, Fox’s\n’Martyrs’ and the ’Lives of the Saints’ standing peacefully near the\n’Encyclopédie’ and Voltaire. A catalogue can hardly be expected.",
        "There are three Masonic lodges and two Portuguese clubs, one good, the\nother not; and the former (Club Funchalense), well lodged in a house\nbelonging to Viscountess Torre Bella, gives some twice or three times a\nyear very enjoyable balls. The Café Central, with estaminet and\nFrench billiard-table, is much frequented by the youth of the town, but\nnot by residents. The great institution is the club called the ’English\nRooms,’ which has been removed from over a shop in the Aljube to\nViscondessa de Torre Bella’s house in the Rua da Alfandega. The British\nConsulate is under the same roof, and next door is Messieurs Blandy’s\nubiquitous ’Steamer Agency.’ The roomy and comfortable quarters, with a\nfine covered balcony looking out upon the sea, are open to both\nsexes. The collection of books is old; but the sum of 100l. laid\nout on works of reference would bring it fairly up to the level of the\naverage English country-club. Strangers’ names were hospitably put down\nby any proprietary member as guests and visitors if they did not outstay\nthe fortnight; otherwise they became subscribers. But crowding was the\nresult, and the term has been reduced to three days: a month’s\nsubscription, however, costs only 10s. 6d. The doors close\nat 7.30 P.M.: I used to think this an old-world custom kept up by the\nveteran hands; but in an invalid place perhaps it is wisely done.",
        "The principal passetemps at Madeira consists of eating, drinking,\nand smoking; it is the life of a horse in a loose box, where the animal\neats pour passer le temps. After early tea and toast there is\nbreakfast à la fourchette at nine; an equally heavy lunch, or rather\nan early dinner (No. 1), appears at 1 to 2 P.M.; afternoon tea follows,\nand a second dinner at 6 to 7. Residents and invalids suppress tiffin\nand dine at 2 to 3 P.M. In fact, as on board ship, people eat because\nthey have nothing else to do; and English life does not admit of the\nsensible French hours–déjeuner à la fourchette at 11 A.M. and\ndinner after sunset.",
        "The first walk through Funchal shows that it has not improved during the\nlast score of years, and to be stationary in these days is equivalent to\nbeing retrograde. It received two heavy blows–in 1852 the vine-disease;\nand, since that time, a gradual decline of reputation as a\nsanatorium. Yet it may, I think, look for a better future when the Land\nBill Law system, extending to England and Scotland, will cover the\ncontinent with colonies of British rentiers who rejoice in large\nfamilies and small incomes. Moreover, Anglo-African officials are\ngradually learning that it is best to leave their ’wives and wees’ at\nMadeira; and the coming mines of the Gold Coast will greatly add to the\nnumbers. For the economist Funchal and its environs present peculiar\nadvantages. The dearness of coin appears in the cheapness of houses and\npremises. Estates which cost 5,000l. to 15,000l. a generation\nago have been sold to ’Demerarists’ for one-tenth that\nsum. ’Palmeira,’ for instance, was built for 42,000l., and was\nbought for 4,000l. A family can live quietly, even keeping\nponies, for 500l. per annum; and it is something to find a place\nfour to seven days’ sail from England inhabitable, to a certain extent\nall the year round. The mean annual temperature is 67.3 degrees; that of\nsummer varies from 70 degrees to 85 degrees, and in winter it rarely\nfalls below 50 degrees to 60 degrees. The range, which is the most\nimportant consideration, averages 9 degrees, with extremes of 5 degrees\nto 35 degrees. The moist heat is admirably adapted for old age, and I\ndoubt not that it greatly prolongs life. Youth, English youth, cannot\nthrive in this subtropical air; there are certain advantages for\neducation at Funchal; but children are sent north, as from Anglo-India,\nto be reared. Otherwise they will grow up yellow and languid, without\nenergy or industry, and with no object in life but to live.",
        "Madeira has at once gained credit for comfort and has lost reputation as\na sanatorium, a subject upon which fashion is peculiarly fickle. During\nthe last century the Faculty sent its incurables to Lisbon and\nMontpellier despite the mistral and the fatal vent de\nbise. The latter town then lodged some 300 English families of\ninvalids, presently reduced to a few economists and wine-merchants.\nSucceeded Nice and Pisa, one of the most wearying and relaxing\nof ’sick bays;’ and Pau in the Pyrenees, of which the native\nBéarnais said that the year has eight months of winter and four of\ninferno. Madeira then rose in the world, and a host of medical residents\nsounded her praises, till Mentone was written up and proved a powerful\nrival. And the climate of the hot-damp category was found to suit,\nmainly if not only, that tubercular cachexy and those, bronchial\naffections and lung-lesions in which the viscus would suffer from the\nover-excitement of an exceedingly dry air like the light invigorating\nmedium of Tenerife or Thebes. Lastly, when phthisis was determined to be\na disease of debility, of anæmia, of organic exhaustion, and of\ndefective nutrition, cases fitted for Madeira were greatly limited. Here\ninstruments deceive us as to humidity. The exceeding dampness is shown\nby the rusting of iron and the tarnishing of steel almost as effectually\nas upon the West African coast. Yet Mr. Vivian’s observations, assuming\n100 to be saturation, made Torquay 76 and Funchal 73. [Footnote: Others\nmake the mean humidity of Funchal 76, and remark that in the healthiest\nand most pleasant climates the figures range between 70 and\n80]. Moreover it was found out that consumption, as well as intermittent\nfevers, are common on the island, so common, indeed, as to require an\nespecial hospital for the poorer classes, although the people declare\nthem to have been imported by the stranger. I may here observe that\nwhile amongst all the nations of Southern Europe great precautions are\ntaken against the contagion of true phthisis, English medicos seem to\nignore it. A Pisan housekeeper will even repaper the rooms after the\ndeath of a consumptive patient. At Funchal sufferers in every stage of\nthe disease live in the same house and even in the same rooms.",
        "Then came the discovery that for consumptives dry cold is a medium\nsuperior to damp heat. Invalids were sent to the Tyrol, to the Engadine,\nto Canada, and even to Iceland, where phthisis is absolutely unknown,\nand where a diet of oleaginous fish is like feeding upon cod-liver or\nshark-liver oil. The air as well as the diet proved a tonic, and\npatients escaped the frequent cough, catarrh, influenza, and neuralgia\nwhich are so troublesome at Funchal. Here, too, the invalid must be\naccompanied by a ’prudent and watchful friend,’ or friends, and the\ncompanions will surely suffer. I know few climates so bad and none worse\nfor those fecund causes of suffering in Europe, liver-affections\n(’mucous fevers’), diarrhoeas, and dysenteries; for nervous complaints,\ntic douloureux, and neuralgia, or for rheumatism and lumbago. Asthma is\none of the disorders which shows the most peculiar forms, and must be\ntreated in the most various ways: here some sufferers are benefitted,\nothers are not. Madeira is reputedly dangerous also for typhoid\naffections, for paralysis, and for apoplexy. There is still another\nchange to come. The valley north of the beautiful and ever maligned\n’Dead Sea’ of Palestine, where the old Knights Templar had their\nsugar-mills and indigo-manufactories, has peculiar merits. Lying some\n1,350 feet below the Mediterranean, it enables a man to live with a\nquarter of a lung: you may run till your legs fail with fatigue, but you\ncan no more get out of breath than you can sink in the saline waters of\nLake Asphaltites. When a railway from Jafa to Jerusalem shall civilise\nthe ’Holy Land,’ I expect great things from the sites about the Jordan\nembouchure.",
        "After the ’gadding vine’ had disappeared the people returned to their\nold amours, the sugar-cane, whose five loaves, disposed crosswise, gave\nthe island her heraldic cognisance. Madeira first cultivated sugar in\nthe western hemisphere and passed it on to the New World. Yet the cane\nwas always worked under difficulties. Space is limited: the upper\nextreme of cultivation on the southern side may be estimated at 1,000\nfeet. The crop exhausts the soil; the plant requires water, and it\ndemands what it can rarely obtain in quantity–manure. Again, machinery\nis expensive and adventure is small. Jamaica and her slave-labour soon\nreduced the mills from one hundred and fifty to three, and now five. My\nhospitable friend, Mr. William Hinton, is the only islander who works\nsugar successfully at the Torreão. The large rival mill with the\ntall regulation smoke-stack near the left mouth of the Ribeira de São’\nJoão, though inscribed ’Omnia vincit improbus labor,’ and though\nprovided with the most expensive modern appliances, is understood not to\nbe a success for the Companhia Fabril d’Assucar.",
        "Here sugar-working in the present day requires for bare existence high\nprotective duties. The Government, however, has had the common sense,\nand the Madeirans patriotic feeling enough, to defend their industry\nfrom certain ruinous vagaries, by taxing imported growths 80 reis\n(4d.) per kilo. A hard-grit free-trader would abolish this\nabomination and ruin half the island. And here I would remark that in\nEngland the world has seen for the first time a wealthy and commercial,\na great and generous nation proclaim, and take pride in proclaiming, the\nmost immoral doctrine. ’Free Trade,’ so called, I presume, because it is\npractically the reverse of free or fair trade, openly abjures public\nspirit and the chief obligation of the citizen–to think of his\nneighbour as well as himself, and not to let charity end, as it often\nbegins, at home. ’Buy cheap and sell dear’ is the law delivered by its\nprophets, the whole duty of ’the merchant and the man.’ When its\ntheorists ask me the favourite question, ’Would you not buy in the\ncheapest market?’ I reply, ’Yes, but my idea of cheapness is not yours:\nI want the best, no matter what its price, because it will prove\ncheapest in the end.’ How long these Free-trade fads and fooleries will\nlast no one can say; but they can hardly endure till that millennium\nwhen the world accepts the doctrine, and when Free Trade becomes free\ntrade and fair trade.",
        "As regards petite industrie in Madeira, there is a considerable\ntraffic in ’products of native industry,’ sold to steamer-passengers.\nThe list gives jewellery and marquetry or inlaid woodwork;\nfeather-flowers, straw hats, lace and embroidery, the latter an\nimportant item; boots and shoes of unblackened leather; sweetmeats,\nespecially guava-cheese; wax-fruits, soap-berry bracelets, and ’Job’s\ntears;’ costumes in wood and clay; basketry, and the well-known wicker\nchairs, tables, and sofas. The cooperage is admirable; I have nowhere\nseen better-made casks. The handsomest shops, as we might expect, are\nthe apothecaries’; and, here, as elsewhere, they thrive by charging a\nsixpence for what cost them a halfpenny.",
        "An enterprising Englishman lately imported sheep from home. The native\nmutton was described in 1842 as ’strong in flavour and lean in\ncondition;’ in fact, very little superior to that of Trieste. Now it is\nremarkably good, and will be better. Silk, I have said, has not been\nfairly tried, and the same is the case with ginger. Cotton suffered\nterribly from the worm. Chinchona propagated from cuttings, not from the\nseed, did well. Dr. Grabham [Footnote: The Climate and Resources of\nMadeira. By Michael C. Grabham, M.D., F.R.G.S., F.R.C.P. London;\nChurchill, 1870.] tells us that the coffee-berry ripens and yields a\nbeverage locally thought superior to that of the imported kinds. It has\nbecome almost extinct in consequence of protracted blights: the island\nair is far too damp. Tea did not succeed. [Footnote: Page 189, Du\nClimat de Madère, etc., par C. A. Mourão Pitta, Montpellier, 1859.]\nCochineal also proved a failure. The true Mexican cactus (Opuntia\nTuna) was brought to supplant the tree-like and lean-leafed native\ngrowth; but there is too much wind and rain for the insects, and the\npeople prefer to eat the figs or ’prickly pears.’ Bananas grow well, and\na large quantity is now exported for the English market. But the climate\ndoes not agree with European fruits and vegetables; strawberries and\nFrench beans are equally flavourless. I remarked the same in the\nglorious valley of the Lower Congo: it must result from some telluric or\natmospheric condition which we cannot yet appreciate.",
        "Tobacco has been tried with some success, though the results do not\nequal those of the Canaries; there, however, the atmosphere is too dry,\nhere it is not. The estanco (monopoly) and the chronic debt to\nthose who farm the import-tax long compelled the public to pay dear for\na poor article. Home-growth was forbidden till late years; now it is\nencouraged, and rate-payers contribute a small additional sum. Hitherto,\nhowever, results have not been over-favourable, because, I believe, the\ntobacco-beds have been unhappily placed. Rich valley-soils and\nsea-slopes, as at Cuban Vuelta de Abajo and Syrian Latakia, are the\nproper habitats of the ’holy herb.’ Here it is planted in the high dry\ngrounds about the ’Peak Fort’ and the uplands east of the city. Manure\nalso is rare and dear, and so is water, which, by the by, is sadly\nwasted in Madeira for want of reservoirs. Consequently the peasants\nsmoke tobacco from the Azores.",
        "The Casa Funchalense, north of the Cathedral, is the chief depôt for\nisland-growths. It sells ’Escuros’ (dark brands) of 20 reis, or\n1d., and 50 reis, according to size. The ’Claros,’ which seem to\nbe the same leaf steamed, fetch from 40 to 100 reis. A small half-ounce\nof very weak and poor-flavoured pipe-tobacco also is worth 1d.",
        "An influential planter, Senhor João de Salles Caldeira, kindly sent to\nMr. John Blandy some specimens of his nicotiana for me to test in\nAfrica. The leaf-tobaccos, all grown between 1879 and 1881, at Magdalena\nin the parish of St. Antonio, were of three kinds. The Havano was far\ntoo short for the trade; the Bahiano, also dark, was longer; and the\nso-called ’North-American’ was still longer, light-coloured and well\ntied in prick-shape. The negro verdict was, ’Left, a lilly he be foine,’\nmeaning they want but little to be excellent. The Gold Coast prefers\nyellow Virginia, whose invoice price is 7d. per lb. The traders\nare now introducing Kentucky, which, landed from Yankee ships, costs\n6d. But, here as elsewhere, it is difficult to bring about any\nsuch change.",
        "There were two qualities of Madeiran charutos (cigars): one long\nClaro which smoked very mild, and a short Escuro, which tasted a trifle\nbitter. The blacks complained that they were too new; and I should rank\nthem with the average produce of Brazilian Bahia. A papered\ncigarilha, clad in an outer leaf of tobacco, was exceptionally\ngood. The cígarros (cigarettes), neatly bound in bundles of\ntwenty-five, were of three kinds, fortes (strong),\nentre-fortes, and fracos (mild). All were excellent and\nfull of flavour; they did not sicken during the voyage, and I should\nrank them with the far-famed Bragança of the Brazil.",
        "The most successful of these small speculations is that of\nMr. E. Hollway. Assisted by an able gardener from Saint Michael, Azores,\nwhere the pineapple made a little fortune for Ponta Delgada, he has\nconverted Mount Pleasant, his father’s house and grounds on the Caminho\ndo Meio, into one huge pinery. The Madeiran sun does all the work of\nEnglish fires and flues; but the glass must be whitewashed; otherwise,\nbeing badly made, with bubbles and flaws, it would burn holes in the\nplants. The best temperature for the hot-houses is about 90° F.: it will\nrise after midday to 140°, and fall at night to 65°. The species\npreferred are, in order of merit, the Cayena, the black Jamaica, and the\nBrazilian Abacaxi. The largest of Mr. Hollway’s produce weighed 20\nlbs.–pumpkin size. Those of 12 lbs. and 15 lbs. are common, but the\nmarket prefers 8 lbs. His highest price was 2l., and he easily\nobtains from 10s. to 15s. In one greenhouse we saw 2,500\nplants potted and bedded; the total numbers more than double that\nfigure. The proprietor has a steam-saw, makes his own boxes, and packs\nhis pines with dry leaves of maize and plantain. He is also cultivating\na dwarf banana, too short to be wind-wrung. His ground will grow\nanything: the wild asparagus, which in Istria rises knee-high, here\nbecomes a tall woody shrub.",
        "And now of the wine which once delighted the world, and which has not\nyet become ’food for the antiquary.’ To begin with, a few dates and\nfigures are necessary. In 1852, that terrible year for France, the\nOïdium fungus attacked the vine, and soon reduced to 2,000 the normal\nyearly production of 20,000 and even 22,000 pipes.",
        "[Footnote: Between 1792 and 1827 the yearly average was 20,000.\nIn 1813 it was 22,000.\n “ 1814   “    14,000.\n “ 1816   “    15,000.",
        "In 1816 it was 12,000.\n “ 1818   “    18,000.\n “ 1825   “    14,000.",
        "It then decreased to an average of 7,000 till the oïdium-year\n(Miss E. M, Taylor, p. 74).]",
        "The finest growths suffered first, as animals of the highest blood\nsuccumb the soonest to epidemics. When I wrote in 1863 the grape was\nbeing replanted, chiefly the white verdelho, the Tuscan\nverdea. In 1873 the devastating Phylloxera appeared, and before\n1881 it had ruined two of the finest southern districts. The following\nnumerals show the rapid decline of yield:–6,000 pipes in 1878, 5,000 in\n1879, 3,000 in 1880, and 2,000 in 1881. There are still in store some\n30,000 pipes, each=92 gallons (forty-five dozen); and a single firm,\nMessrs. Blandy Brothers, own 3,000. Mr. Charles R. Blandy, the late head\nof the house, bought up all the must grown since 1863; but he did\nnot care to sell. This did much harm to the trade, by baulking the\ndemand and by teaching the public to do without it. His two surviving\nsons have worked hard and advertised on a large scale; they issue a\nyearly circular, and the result is improved enquiry. Till late years the\nworld was not aware that the Madeiran vine has again produced Madeira\nwine; and a Dutch admiral, amongst others, was surprised to hear that\nall was not made at Cettes. I give below Messrs. Blandy’s trade-prices,\nto which some 20 per cent, must be added for retail.",
        "[Footnote: Sound light medium Madeiras from 26s. to 32s. per dozen,\npacked and delivered in London; light, golden, delicate, 36s.;\ntawny Tinta, also called ’Madeira Burgundy,’ a red wine mixing well with\nwater, 40s.; fine old dry Verdelho, 48s.; rich soft old\nBual, not unlike Amontillado, 54s.; very fine dry old Sercial\n(the Riesling grape), 56s.; and the same for highly-flavoured\nsoft old Malmsey, ’Malvasia Candida,’ corrupted from ’Candia’ because\nsupposed to have been imported from that island in 1445. ’Grand Old Oama\nde Lobos’ is worth 70s., and the best Old Preserve wine\n86s. For wines very old in bottle there are special quotations.]",
        "The lowest price free on board is 23l, and the values rise from\n40l. at four years old to 1OOl. at ten years old.",
        "’Madeira’ was most popular in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries,\nespecially at the Court of Francois I. Shakespeare in ’Henry IV.’  makes\ndrouthy Jack sell his soul on Good Friday for a cup of Madeira and a\ncold capon’s leg. Mr. H. Vizetelly, whose professional work should be\nread by all who would master the subject, marvels why and how this\n’magnificent wine’ went out of fashion. The causes are many, all easy to\ntrace. Men not yet very old remember the day when England had no vino\nde pasto fit to be drunk at meals; when they found only ports,\nsherries, and loaded clarets; and when they sighed in vain for light\nRhine or Bordeaux growths, good ordinaire being to drink what\nbread is to food.",
        "[Footnote: This, however, is a mere individual opinion. I have lately\nread a book recommending strong and well-brandied wines as preventing\nthe crave for pure alcohol.]",
        "Now, however, the national taste has changed; the supply of Madeira not\nsufficing for the demand, the class called boticarios\n(apothecaries) brought rivals into the market; and extensive imitation’s\nwith apples, loquats (Japanese medlars), and other frauds, brandied to\nmake the stuff keep, plastered or doctored with Paris-plaster to correct\nover-acidity, and coloured and sweetened with burnt sugar and with\nboiled ’must’ (mosto) to mock the Madeira flavour, gave the\nisland-produce a bad name. Again, the revolution in the wine-trade of\n1860-61 brought with it certain Continental ideas. In France a glass of\nMadeira follows soup, and in Austria it is drunk in liqueur-glasses like\nTokay.",
        "[Footnote: ’Madeira’ is the island modification of the Cyprus and the\nCandia (?) grape. ’Tokay’ comes from the Languedoc muscatel, and\n’Constantia’ from Burgundy, like most of the Rhine-wines.]",
        "The island wine must change once more to suit public taste. At present\nit ships at the average strength of 18°-25° per cent, of ’proof spirit,’\nwhich consists of alcohol and water in equal proportions. For that\npurpose each pipe is dosed with a gallon or two of Porto Santo or São\nVicente brandy. This can do no harm; the addition is homogeneous and\nchemically combines with the grape-juice; but when potato-spirit and\ncane-rum are substituted for alcohol distilled from wine, the result is\nbad. The vintage is rarely ripened by time, whose unrivalled work is\nimperfectly done in the estufa or flue-stove, the old fumarium,\nor in the sertio (apotheca), an attic whose glass roofing admits\nthe sun. The voyage to the East Indies was a clumsy contrivance for the\nsame purpose; and now the merchants are beginning to destroy the germs\nof fermentation not by mere heat, but by the strainer extensively used\nin Jerez. The press shown to me was one of Messrs. Johnson and Co.,\nwhich passes the liquor through eighteen thick cottons supported by iron\nplates. It might be worth while to apply electricity in the form used to\ndestroy fusel-oil. Lastly, the wine made for the market is a brand or a\nblend, not a ’vintage-wine.’  At any of the armazems, or stores,\nyou can taste the wines of ’70, ’75, ’76, and so forth, of A 1 quality;\nand you can learn their place as well as their date of birth. But these\nare mixed when wine of a particular kind is required and the produce\nbecomes artificial. What is now wanted is a thin light wine, red or\nwhite, with the Madeira flavour, and this will be the drink of the\nfuture. The now-forgotten tisane de Madère and the ’rain-water\nMadeira,’ made for the American markets, a soft, delicate, and\nstraw-coloured beverage, must be the models.",
        "I sampled the new wines carefully; and, with due remembrance of the\npeaches in ’Gil Blas,’ I came to the conclusion that they are no longer\nwhat they were. The wine is tainted with sulphur in its odorous union\nwith hydrogen. It is unduly saccharine, fermenting irregularly and\ninsufficiently. For years the plant has constantly been treated against\noidium with antiseptics, which destroy the spores and germ-growths; and\nwe can hardly expect a first-rate yield from a chronically-diseased\nstock. Still the drink is rich and highly flavoured; and, under many\ncircumstances, it answers better than any kind of sherry. No more\nsatisfactory refreshment on a small scale than a biscuit and a glass of\nBual. Moreover, the palate requires variety, and here finds it in a\nharmless form. But as a daily drink Madeira should be avoided: even in\nthe island I should prefer French Bordeaux, not English claret, with an\noccasional change to Burgundy. Meanwhile, ’London particular’ is a fact,\nand the supply will probably exceed the demand of the present\ngeneration.",
        "I also carefully sampled the wines of the north coast, which had not, as\nin Funchal, been subjected to doctoring by stove, by spirits, and by\nblend. They are lighter than the southern; but, if unbrandied, some soon\nturn sour, and others by keeping get strong and heady. The proportion of\nalcoholism is peremptorily determined by climate–that is, the\ncomparative ratio of sun and rain. In Europe, for instance, light wines\ncannot be produced without ’liquor,’ as the trade calls aqua\npura, by latitudes lower than Germany and Southern France. When heat\ngreatly exceeds moisture, the wines may be mild to mouth and nose, yet\nthey are exceedingly potent; witness the vino d’oro of the\nLibanus.",
        "At Funchal I also tasted a very neat wine, a vin de pays with the\nisland flavour and not old enough to become spirituous. If the vine be\nagain grown in these parts, its produce will be drunk in England under\nsome such form. But Madeira has at last found her ’manifest destiny:’\nshe will be an orchard to Northern Europe and (like the England of the\nfuture) a kitchen-garden to the West African Coast, especially the Gold\nMines.",
        "My sojourn at the Isle of Wood and its ’lotus-eating’ (which means\ndouble dinners) came to an end on Sunday, January 8, the\ns.s. Senegal Captain W. L. Keene, bringing my long-expected\nfriend Cameron, of African fame. The last day passed pleasantly enough\nin introducing him to various admirers; and we ate at Santa Clara a\nfinal dinner, perfectly conscious that we were not likely to see its\nlike for many a month. We were followed to the beach by a choice band of\nwell-wishers–Baron Adelin de Vercour, Colonel H. W. Keays Young, and\nDr. Struthers–who determined upon accompanying us to Tenerife. The\nnight was black as it well could be, and the white surf rattled the\nclicking pebbles, as we climbed into the shore-boat with broad\ncheek-pieces, and were pulled off shipwards. On board we found\nMr. William Reid, junior, who had carefully lodged our numerous\nimpediments; and, at 10 P.M., we weighed for Tenerife.",
        "I must not leave the Isle of Wood, which has so often given me\nhospitality, without expressing a hearty wish that the Portuguese\n’Government,’ now rhyming with ’impediment,’ will do its duty by\nher. The Canaries and their free ports, which are different from ’free\ntrade,’ have set the best example; and they have made great progress\nwhile the Madeiras have stood still, or rather have retrograded. The\nFunchal custom-house is a pest; the import charges are so excessive that\nvisitors never import, and for landing a single parcel the ship must pay\nhigh port-charges where no port exists. The population is heavily taxed,\nand would willingly ’pronounce’ if it could only find a head. The\nproduce, instead of being spent upon the island, is transmitted to\nLisbon: surely a portion of it might be diverted from bureaucratic\npockets and converted into an emigration fund. It is sad to think that a\nsingle stroke of the Ministerial pen would set all right and give new\nlife to the lovely island, and yet that the pen remains idle.",
        "And a parting word of praise for Madeira. Whatever the traveller from\nEurope may think of this quasi-tropical Tyrol, those homeward-bound from\nAsia and Africa will pronounce her a Paradise. They will enjoy good\nhotels, comfortable tables d’hôte, and beef that does not\nresemble horseflesh or unsalted junk. Nor is there any better place\nwherein to rest and recruit after hard service in the tropics. Moreover,\nat the end of a month spent in perfect repose the visitor will look\nforward with a manner of dismay to the plunge into excited civilised\nlife.",
        "But Madeira is not ’played out;’ au contraire, she is one of\nthose ’obligatory points’ for commerce which cannot but prosper as the\nworld progresses. The increasing traffic of the West African coast will\nmake men resort to her for comforts and luxuries, for climate and\nrepose. And when the Gold Mines shall be worked as they should be this\nisland may fairly look forward to catch many a drop of the golden\nshower.",
        "The following interesting table, given to me by M. d’Oliveira, clerk of\nthe English Rooms, shows what movement is already the rule of Funchal.",
        "TO TENERIFE, LA LAGUNA, AND OROTAVA.",
        "When I left, in 1865, the western coast of the Dark Continent, its\ntransit and traffic were monopolised by the A(frican) S(team) S(hip)\nCompany, a monthly line established in 1852, mainly by the late\nMacgregor Laird. In 1869 Messieurs Elder, Dempster, and Co., of Glasgow,\nstarted the B(ritish) and A(frican) to divide the spoils. The junior\nnumbers nineteen keel, including two being built. It could easily ’eat\nup’ the decrepit senior, which is now known as the A(frican)\nS(tarvation) S(teamers); but this process would produce serious\ncompetition. Both lines sail from Liverpool on alternate Saturdays, and\nmake Funchal, with their normal unpunctuality, between Fridays and\nSundays. This is dreary slow compared with the four days’ fast running\nof the ’Union S. S. C.’ and the comfortable ’Castle Line,’ alias the\nCape steamers.",
        "The B. and A. s.s. Senegal is a fair specimen of the modern West\nAfrican trader ’improved:’ unfortunately the improvements affect the\nshareholders’ pockets rather than the passengers’ persons. The\nsleeping-berths are better, but the roomy, well-lighted, comfortable old\nsaloon, sadly shorn of its fair proportions, has become the upper story\nof a store-room. The unfortunate stewards must catch fever by frequent\ndiving into the close and sultry mine of solids and fluids under\nfloor. There being no baggage-compartment, boxes and bags are stowed\naway in the after part, unduly curtailing light and air; the stern\nlockers, once such pleasant sleeping-sofas, and their fixed tables are\nof no use to anything besides baskets and barrels. Here the surgeon,\nwho, if anyone, should have a cabin by way of dispensary, must lodge his\nmedicine-chest. Amongst minor grievances the main cabin is washed every\nnight, breeding a manner of malaria. The ice intended for passengers is\neither sold or preserved for those who ship most cargo. Per contra, the\ncook is good, the table is plentiful, the wines not over bad, the\nstewards civil, and the officers companionable.",
        "Both lines, however, are distinctly traders. They bind themselves to no\ntime; they are often a week late, and they touch wherever demand calls\nthem. The freight-charges are exorbitant, three pounds for fine goods\nand a minimum of thirty-six shillings, when fifteen per ton would\npay. The White Star Line, therefore, threatens concurrence. Let\nus also hope that when the Gold Mines prosper we shall have our special\nsteamers, where the passenger will be more prized than the puncheon of\npalm-oil. But future rivals must have a care; they will encounter a\nsomewhat unscrupulous opposition; and they had better ship American\ncrews, at any rate not Liverpudlians.",
        "The night and the next day were spent at sea in a truly delicious\nclimate, which seemed to wax softer and serener as we advanced. Here the\nmoon, whose hue is golden, not silvern, has a regular dawn before\nrising, and an afterglow to her setting; and Venus casts a broad cestus\nof glimmering light upon the purple sea. Mount Atlas, alias the Pike of\nTeyde, gradually upreared his giant statue, two and a half miles high:\ntravellers speak of seeing him from Madeira, a distance of some 260\n(dir. geog.) miles; but this would be possible only were both termini\n15,000 feet in altitude. The limit of sight for terrestrial objects\nunder the most favourable conditions does not exceed 210 miles. Yet here\nit is not difficult to explain the impossible distances, 200 miles\ninstead of 120, at which, they say, the cone has been sighted: mirage or\nrefraction accounts for what the earth’s convexity disallows.",
        "We first see a low and regular wall of cloud-bank whose coping bears\nhere and there bulges of white, cottony cloud. Then a regular pyramid,\nat this season white as snow, shows its gnomon-like point, impaling the\ncumuli. Hour by hour the outlines grow clearer, till at last the\nterminal cone looks somewhat like a thimble upon a pillow–the\ncumbre, or lofty foundation of pumice-plains. But the aspect\neverywhere varies according as you approach the island from north,\nsouth, east, or west.",
        "The evening of January 9 showed us right abeam a splendid display of the\nZodiacal Light, whose pyramid suggested the glow of a hemisphere on\nfire. The triangle, slightly spherical, measured at its base 22 degrees\nto 24 degrees and rose to within 6” of Jupiter. The reflection in the\nwater was perfect and lit up with startling distinctness the whole\neastern horizon.",
        "At 7 A.M. next morning, after running past the Anaga knuckle-bone–and\nvery bony it is–of the Tenerife gigot, we cast anchor in the Bay\nof Santa Cruz, took boat, and hurried ashore. In the early times of the\nA.S.S. halts at the several stations often lasted three days. Business\nis now done in the same number of hours; and the captain informs you\nthat ’up goes the anchor’ the moment his last bale or bag comes on\nboard. This trading economy of time, again, is an improvement more\nsatisfactory to the passenger than to the traveller and sightseer who\nmay wish to see the world.",
        "Brusque was the contrast between the vivid verdure of Sylvania, the Isle\nof Wood, and the grim nudity of north-eastern Tenerife; brusquer still\nthe stationary condition of the former compared with the signs, of\nprogress everywhere evident in the latter. Spain, under the influence of\nanticlerical laws and a spell of republicanism, has awoke from her sleep\nof ages, and we note the effects of her revival even in these\ncolonies. A brand-new red fort has been added to La Ciudadela at the\nnorthern suburb, whence a mole is proposed to meet the southern branch\nand form a basin. Then comes the triangular city whose hypothenuse,\nfronting east, is on the sea; its chief fault is having been laid out on\ntoo small a scale. At the still-building pier, which projects some 500\nyards from the central mass of fort and cuadras (insulae or\nhouse-blocks), I noticed a considerable growth of buildings, especially\nthe Marineria and other offices connected with the free port. The old\npink ’castle’ San Cristobal (Christopher), still cumbers the jetty-root;\nbut the least sentimental can hardly expect the lieges to level so\nhistoric a building: it is the site of Alonso Fernandez de Lugo’s first\ntower, and where his disembarkation on May 3, 1493, gave its Christian\nname ’Holy Cross’ to the Guanche ’Añasa.’ Meanwhile the Rambleta de\nRavenal, dated 1861, a garden, formerly dusty, glary, and dreary as the\nold Florian of Malta, now bears lovers’ seats, a goodly growth of planes\nand tamarinds, a statue, a fountain, and generally a gypsy-like\nfamily. By its side runs a tramway for transporting the huge blocks of\nconcrete intended to prolong the pier. The inner town also shows a new\npalace, a new hospital, and a host of improvements.",
        "Landing at Santa Cruz, a long dull line of glaring masonry, smokeless\nand shadeless, was to me intensely saddening. A score of years had\ncarried off all my friends. Kindly Mrs. Nugent, called ’the Admiral,’\nand her amiable daughter are in the English burial-ground; the\nhospitable Mr. Consul Grattan had also faded from the land of the\nliving. The French Consul, M. Berthelot, who published [Footnote:\nHistoire naturelle des Iles Canaries, par MM. P. Barker Webb et\nSabin Berthelot, ouvrage publié sous les auspices de M. Guizot, Ministre\nde l’Instruction Publique, Paris, 1839. Seven folio vols., with maps,\nplans, and sketches, all regardless of expense.] by favour of the late\nMr. Webb, went to the many in 1880. One of the brothers Richardson had\ndied; the other had subsided into a clerk, and the Fonda Ingleza had\nbecome the British Consulate. The new hotel kept by Señor Camacho and\nhis English wife appeared comfortable enough, but it had none of those\nassociations which make the old familiar inn a kind of home. En\nrevanche, however, I met Mr. Consul Dundas, my successor at the port\nof Santos, whence so few have escaped with life; and his wife, the\ndaughter of an Anglo-Brazilian friend.",
        "Between 1860 and 1865 I spent many a week in Tenerife, and here I am\ntempted to transcribe a few extracts from my voluminous notes upon\nvarious subjects, especially the Guanche population and the ascent of\nthe Pike. A brief history of the unhappy Berber-speaking goatherds who,\nafter being butchered to make sport for certain unoccupied gentlemen,\nhave been raised by their assailants to kings and heroes rivalling the\ndemi-gods of Greece and Rome, and the melancholy destruction of the\nrace, have been noticed in a previous volume. [Footnote: Yol. i. chap,\nii., Wanderings in West Africa. The modorra, lethargy or\nmelancholia, which killed so many of those Numidian islanders suggests\nthe pining of a wild bird prisoned in a cage.] I here confine myself to\nthe contents of my note-book upon the Guanche collections in the island.",
        "One fine morning my wife and I set out in a venerable carriage for San\nCristobal de la Laguna. The Camiño de los Coches, a fine modern highway\nin corkscrew fashion from Santa Cruz to Orotava, was begun, by the grace\nof General Ortega, who died smoking in the face of the firing party, and\nended between 1862 and 1868. This section, eight kilomètres long,\noccupies at least one hour and a half, zigzagging some 2,000 feet up a\nsteep slope which its predecessor uncompromisingly breasted. Here stood\nthe villa of Peter Pindar (Dr. Walcott), who hymned the fleas of\nTenerife: I would back those of Tiberias. The land is arid, being\nexposed to the full force of the torrid northeast trade. Its principal\nproduce is the cactus (coccinellifera), a fantastic monster with\nfat oval leaves and apparently destitute of aught beyond thorns and\nprickles. Here and there a string of small and rather mangy camels, each\ncarrying some 500 lbs., paced par monts et par vaux, and gave a\nBedawi touch to the scene: they were introduced from Africa by De\nBéthencourt, surnamed the Great. We remarked the barrenness of the\nbronze-coloured Banda del Sur, whose wealth is in cochineal and\n’dripstones,’ or filters of porous lava. Here few save the hardiest\nplants can live, the spiny, gummy, and succulent cactus and thistles,\naloes and figs. The arborescent tabayba (Euphorbia canariensis),\nlocally called ’cardon,’ is compared by some with the ’chandelier’ of\nthe Cape, bristling with wax tapers: the Guanches used it extensively\nfor narcotising fish. This ’milk plant,’ with its acrid, viscid, and\nvirulent juice, and a small remedial shrub growing by its side, probably\ngave rise to the island fable of the twin fountains; one killed the\ntraveller by a kind of risus Sardonicus, unless he used the other\nby way of cure. A scatter of crosses, which are impaled against every\nwall and which rise from every eminence; a ruined fort here and there; a\nlong zigzag for wheels, not over-macadamised, with an older short cut\nfor hoofs, and the Puente de Zurita over the Barranco Santo, an old\nbridge made new, led to the cuesta, or crest, which looks down\nupon the Vega de la Laguna, the native Aguere.",
        "The ’noble and ancient city’ San Cristobal de la Laguna was founded on\nJune 26, 1495, St. Christopher’s Day, by De Lugo, who lies buried in the\nSan Miguel side-chapel of La Concepcion de la Victorias. The site is an\nancient lava-current, the successor of a far older crater, originally\nsubmarine. The latest sub-aerial fire-stream, a broad band flowing from\nnorth to south–we have ascended it by the coach-road–and garnished\nwith small parasitic craters, affords a bed and basis to the\ncapital-port, Santa Cruz. After rains the lake reappears in mud and\nmire; and upon the lip where the town is built the north-east and the\nsouth-west winds contend for mastery, shedding abundant tears. Yet the\nold French chronicler says of the site, ’Je ne croy pas qu’il y eu ait\nen tout le monde aucune autre de plus plaisante.’ The mean annual\ntemperature is 62° 51’ (F.), and the sensation is of cold: the altitude\nbeing 1,740 feet. Hence, like Orotava, it escaped the yellow fever which\nin October 1862 had slain its 616 victims.",
        "[Footnote: The list of epidemics at Santa Cruz is rather formidable,\ne.g. 1621 and 1628, peste (plague); 1810 and 1862, yellow\nJack; 1814, whooping cough, scarlatina, and measles; 1816-16, small-pox\n(2,000 victims); 1826, cough and scarlet ferer; 1847, fatal dysentery;\nand 1861-62, cholera (7,000 to 12,000 deaths).]",
        "La Laguna offers an extensive study of medieval baronial houses, of\ncolonial churches, of ermitas, or chapels, of altars, and of\nconvents now deserted, but once swarming with Franciscans and Augustines\nand Dominicans and Jesuits. These establishments must have been very\nrich, for, here as elsewhere,",

The Concepcion boasts a\npicture of St. John which in 1648 sweated for forty days. [Footnote:\nEvidently a survival of the classic aera sudantia. Mrs. Murray\nnotices the ’miracle’ at full length (ii. 76).] The black and white\ncathedral, bristling with cannon-like gargoyles, a common architectural\nfeature in these regions, still owns the fine pulpit of Carrara marble\nsent from Genoa in 1767. The chef d’oeuvre then cost 200l.;\nnow it would be cheap at five times that price. In the sacristy\nare the usual rich vestments and other clerical curios. The\nErmita de San Cristobal, built upon an historic site, is denoted as\nusual by a giant Charon bearing a small infant. There is a Carriera or\nCorso (High Street) mostly empty, also the great deserted Plaza del\nAdelantado, of the conqueror Lugo. The arms of the latter, with his\nlance and banner, are shown at the Ayuntamiento, or town-house; I do not\nadmire his commercial motto–",
        "Conquering must not be named in the same breath as ’bread-winning.’\nThere, too, is the scutheon of Tenerife, given to it in 1510; Michael\nthe Archangel, a favourite with the invader, stands unroasted upon the\nfire-vomiting Nivarian peak, and this grand vision of the guarded mount\ngave rise to satiric lines by Vieira:–",
        "The deserted streets were long lines with an unclean central\ngutter. Some of the stone houses were tall, grand, solid, and stately;\nsuch are the pavilion of the Counts of Salazar, the huge, heavy abode of\nthe Marquesses de Nava, and the mansions of the Villanuevas del\nPardo. But yellow fever had driven away half of the population–10,000\nsouls, who could easily be 20,000–and had barricaded the houses to the\ncurious stranger. Most of them, faced and porticoed with florid pillars,\nwere mere dickies opening upon nothing, and only the huge armorial\nbearings showed that they had ever been owned. Mixed with these\n’palaces.’ were ’cat-faced cottages’ and pauper, mildewed tenements,\nwhose rusty iron-work, tattered planks, and broken windows gave them a\ntruly dreary and dismal appearance. The sole noticeable movement was a\ntendency to gravitate in the roofs. The principal growth, favoured by\nthe vapour-laden air, was of grass in the thoroughfares, of moss on the\nwalls, and of the ’fat weed’ upon the tiles. The horse-leek\n(sempervivum urbium), brought from Madeira, was first described\nby the ’gifted Swede’ Professor Smith, who died on the Congo\nRiver. Finally, though the streets are wide and regular, and the large\ntown is well aired by four squares, the whole aspect was strongly\nsuggestive of the cocineros (cooks), as the citizens of the\ncapital are called by the sons of the capital-port. They retort by\nterming their rival brethren chicharreros, or fishers of the\nchicharro (horse-mackerel, Caranx Cuvieri.)",
        "From La Laguna we passed forward to Tacoronte, the ’Garden of the\nGuanches,’ and inspected the little museum of the late D. Sebastian\nCasilda, collected by his father, a merchant-captain de long\ncours. It was a chaos of curiosities ranging from China to\nPeru. Amongst them, however, were four entire mummies, including one\nfrom Grand Canary. Thus we can correct M. Berthelot, who follows others\nin asserting that only the Guanches of Tenerife mummified their\ndead. The oldest description of this embalming is by a ’judicious and\ningenious man who had lived twenty years in the island as a physitian\nand merchant.’ It was inserted by Dr. Thomas Sprat in the ’Transactions\nof the Royal Society,’ London, and was republished in John Ogilby’s\nenormous folio [Footnote: The ’physitian’ was Dr. Eden, an Englishman\nwho visited Tenerife in 1662.–Bohn’s Humboldtr, i. 66] yclept\n’Africa.’ The merchant ’set out from Guimar, a Town for the most part\ninhabited by such as derive themselves from the Antient\nGuanchios, in the company of some of them, to view their Caves\nand the corps buried in them (a favour they seldom or never permit to\nany, having the Corps of their Ancestors in great veneration, and\nlikewise being extremely against any molestation of the Dead); but he\nhad done many Eleemosynary Cures amongst them, for they are very poor\n(yet the poorest think themselves too good to Marry with the best\nSpaniard), which endeared him to them exceedingly. Otherwise it\nis death for any Stranger to visit these Caves and Bodies. The Corps are\nsew’d up in Goatskins with Thongs of the same, with very great\ncuriosity, particularly in the incomparable exactness and evenness of\nthe Seams; and the skins are made close and fit to the Corps, which for\nthe most part are entire, the Eyes clos’d, Hair on their heads, Ears,\nNose, Teeth, Lips, and Beards, all perfect, onely discolour’d and a\nlittle shrivell’d. He saw about three or four hundred in several Caves,\nsome of them standing, others lying upon Beds of Wood, so hardened by an\nart they had (which the Spaniards call curay, to cure a piece of\nWood) that no iron can pierce or hurt it.[Footnote: The same writer\ntells that they had earthen pots so hard that they could not be\nbroken. I have heard of similar articles amongst the barbarous races\neast of Dalmatia.] These Bodies are very light, as if made of straw; and\nin some broken Bodies he observ’d the Nerves and Tendons, and also the\nString of the Veins and Arteries very distinctly. By the relation of one\nof the most antient of this island, they had a particular Tribe that had\nthis art onely among themselves, and kept it as a thing sacred and not\nto be communicated to the Vulgar. These mixt not themselves with the\nrest of the Inhabitants, nor marry’d out of their own Tribe, and were\nalso their Priests and Ministers of Religion. But when the\nSpaniards conquer’d the place, most of them were destroy’d and\nthe art perisht with them, onely they held some Traditions yet of a few\nIngredients that were us’d in this business; they took Butter (some say\nthey mixed Bear’s-grease with it) which they kept for that purpose in\nthe Skins; wherein they boyl’d certain Herbs, first a kind of wild\nLavender, which grows there in great quantities upon the Rocks;\nsecondly, an Herb call’d Lara, of a very gummy and glutinous\nconsistence, which now grows there under the tops of the Mountains;\nthirdly, a kind of cyclamen, or sow-bread; fourthly, wild Sage,\nwhich grows plentifully upon this island. These with others, bruised and\nboyl’d up into Butter, rendered it a perfect Balsom. This prepar’d, they\nfirst unbowel the Corps (and in the poorer sort, to save Charges, took\nout the Brain behind): after the Body was thus order’d, they had in\nreadiness a lixivium made of the Bark of Pine-Trees, wherewith\nthey washt the Body, drying it in the Sun in Summer and in the Winter in\na Stove, repeating this very often: Afterward they began their unction\nboth without and within, drying it as before; this they continu’d till\nthe Balsom had penetrated into the whole Habit, and the Muscle in all\nparts appear’d through the contracted Skin, and the Body became\nexceeding light: then they sew’d them up in Goat-skins. The Antients\nsay, that they have above twenty Caves of their Kings and great\nPersonages with their whole Families, yet unknown to any but themselves,\nand which they will never discover.’ Lastly, the ’physitian’ declares\nthat ’bodies are found in the caves of the Grand Canaries, in\nSacks, quite consumed, and not as these in Teneriff.’",
        "This assertion is somewhat doubtful; apparently the practice was common\nto the archipelago. It at once suggests Egypt; and, possibly, at one\ntime, extended clean across the Dark Continent. So Dr. Barth [Footnote:\nTravels, &c., vol. iv. pp. 426-7.] tells us that when the chief\nSonni Ali died in Grurma, ’his sons, who accompanied him on the\nexpedition, took out his entrails and filled his inside with honey, in\norder that it might be preserved from putrefaction.’  Many tribes in\nSouth America and New Zealand, as well as in Africa, preserved the\ncorpse or portions of it by baking, and similar rude devices. According\nto some authorities, the Gruanche menceys (kinglets or chiefs)\nwere boxed, Egyptian fashion, in coffins; but few are found, because the\nsuperstitious Christian islanders destroy the contents of every\ncatacomb.",
        "In the Casilda collection I observed the hard features, broad brows,\nsquare faces, and flavos crines described by old writers. Two\nshowed traces of tongue and eyes (which often were blue), proving that\nthe softer and more perishable parts were not removed. There were\nspecimens of the dry and liquid balsam. Of the twenty-six skulls six\nwere from Grand Canary. All were markedly of the type called Caucasian,\nand some belonged to exceptionally tall men. The shape was\ndolichocephalic, with sides rather flat than rounded; the perceptive\nregion was well developed, and the reflective, as usual amongst savages\nand barbarians, was comparatively poor. The facial region appeared\nunusually large.",
        "The industrial implements were coarse needles and fish-hooks of\nsheep-bone. The domestic supellex consisted of wooden ladles\ncoarsely cut, and of rude pottery, red and yellow, generally without\nhandles, round-shaped and adorned with scratches. None of these\nganigos, or crocks, were painted like those of Grand Canary. They\nused also small basaltic querns of two pieces to grind the gofio,\n[Footnote: The gofio was composed of ripe barley, toasted,\npounded, and kneaded to a kind of porridge in leathern bags like Turkish\ntobacco-pouches. The object was to save the teeth, of which the Guanches\nwere particularly careful.] or parched grain. The articles of dress were\ngrass-cloth, thick as matting, and tamarcos, or smock-frocks, of\npoorly tanned goatskins. They had also rough cords of palm-fibre, and\nthey seem to have preferred plaiting to weaving; yet New Zealand flax\nand aloes grow abundantly. Their mahones correspond with Indian\nmoccasins, and they made sugar-loaf caps of skins. The bases of shells,\nground down to the thickness of a crown-piece, and showing spiral\ndepressions, were probably the viongwa, necklaces still worn in\nthe Lake Regions of Central Africa. The beads were of many kinds; some\nhorn cylinders bulging in the centre, and measuring 1.25 inch long;\nothers of flattened clay like the American wampum or the ornaments of\nthe Fernando Po tribes; and others flattened discs, also baked, almost\nidentical with those found upon African mummies–in Peru they were used\nto record dates and events. A few were of reddish agate, a material not\nfound in the island; these resembled bits of thick pipe-stem, varying\nfrom half an inch to an inch in length. Perhaps they were copies of the\nmysterious Popo-bead found upon the Slave Coast and in inner Africa.",
        "The Gruanches were doomed never to reach the age of metal. Their\ncivilisation corresponded with that of the Chinese in the days of\nFo-hi. [Footnote: Abel Rémusat tells us that of the two hundred\nprimitive Chinese ’hieroglyphs’ none showed a knowledge of metal.] The\nchief weapons were small triangles of close-grained basalt and\niztli (obsidian flakes) for tabonas, or knives, both being\nwithout handles. They carried rude clubs and banot, or barbed\nspears of pine-wood with fire-charred points. The garrotes\n(pikes) had heads like two flattened semicircles, a shape preserved\namongst negroes to the present day. Our old author tells us that the\npeople would ’leap from rock to rock, sometimes making ten Fathoms deep\nat one Leap, in this manner: First they tertiate their Lances,\nwhich are about the bigness of a Half-Pike, and aim with the Point at\nany piece of a Rock upon which they intend to light, sometimes not half\na Foot broad; in leaping off they clap their Feet close to the Lance,\nand so carry their bodies in the Air: the Point of the Lance comes first\nto the place, which breaks the force of their fall; then they slide\ngently down by the Staff and pitch with their Feet on the very place\nthey first design’d; and so from Rock to Rock till they come to the\nbottom: but their Novices sometimes break their necks in the learning.’",
        "I observed more civilisation in articles from the other islands,\nespecially from the eastern, nearer the African continent. In 1834\nFuerteventura yielded, from a depth of six feet, a dwarfish image of a\nwoman with prominent bosom and dressed in the native way: it appeared\nalmost Chinese. A pot of black clay from Palmas showed superior\nconstruction. Here, too, in 1762 a cavern produced a basalt plate, upon\nwhich are circular scrawls, which support the assertions of old writers\nas regards the islanders not being wholly ignorant of letters. I could\ntrace no similarity to the peculiar Berber characters, and held them to\nbe mere ornamentation. The so-called ’Seals of the Kings’ were dark\nstones, probably used for painting the skin; they bore parallelograms\nenclosed within one another, diaper-work and gridirons of raised\nlines. In fact, the Guanches of Tenerife were unalphabetic.",
        "Hierro (Ferro), the Barranco de los Balos (Grand Canary), Fuerteventura,\nand other items of the Fortunates have produced some undoubted\ninscriptions. They are compared by M. Berthelot with the signs engraved\nupon the cave-entrance of La Piedra Escrita in the Sierra Morena of\nAndalusia; with those printed by General Faidherbe in his work on the\nNumidic or Lybian epigraphs; with the ’Thugga inscription,’ Tunis; and\nwith the rock-gravings of the Sahará, attributed to the ancient Tawárik\nor Tifinegs. Dr. Gran-Bassas (El Museo Canario), who finds a notable\nlikeness between them and the ’Egyptian characters (cursive or demotic),\nPhenician and Hebrew,’ notes that they are engraved in vertical series.\nDr. Verneau, of the Academy, Paris, suggests that some of these epigraphs\nare alphabetic, while others are hieroglyphic. [Footnote: El Museo\nCanario, No. 40, Oct. 22, 1881.] Colonel H. W. Keays-Young kindly copied\nfor me, with great care, a painting in the Tacoronte museum. It\nrepresents a couple of Guanche inscriptions, apparently hieroglyphic,\nfound (1762) in the cave of Belmaco, Isle of Palma, by the ancients called\nBenahoave. They are inscribed upon two basaltic stones.",
        "[Illustration: THE NOMIDIO INSCRIPTIONS OF HIEBRO.]",
        "[Illustration]",
        "I also inspected the collection of a well-known lawyer, Dr. Francisco\nMaria de Leon. Of the three Guanche skulls one was of African solidity,\nwith the sutures almost obliterated: it was the model of a soldier’s\nhead, thick and heavy. The mass of mummy-balsam had been tested, without\nother result than finding a large proportion of dragon’s blood. In the\nfourteenth century Grand Canary sent to Europe at one venture two\nhundred doubloons’ worth of this drug.",
        "By the kindness of the Governor I was permitted to inspect four Guanche\nmummies, discovered (June 1862) in the jurisdiction of Candelaria.\nAwaiting exportation to Spain, they had been temporarily\ncoffined upon a damp ground-floor, where the cockroaches respected\nnothing, not even a Guanehe. I was accompanied by Dr. Angel\nM. Yzquierdo, of Cadiz, physician to the hospital, and we jotted down as\nfollows:–",
        "No. 1, a male of moderate size, wanted the head and upper limbs, while\nthe trunk was reduced to a skeleton. The characteristic signs were\nCaucasian and not negro; nor was there any appearance of the Jewish\nrite. The lower right leg, foot, and toe-nails were well preserved; the\nleft was a mere bone, wanting tarsus and metatarsus. The stomach was\nfull of dried fragments of herbs (Ohenopodium, &c.), and the\nepidermis was easily reduced to powder. In this case, as in the other\nthree, the mortuary skins were coarsely sewn with the hair inside: it is\na mistake to say that the work was ’like that of a glove.’",
        "No. 2 was large-statured and complete; the framework and the form of the\npelvis were masculine. The skin adhered to the cranium except behind,\nwhere the bone protruded, probably the effect of long resting upon the\nground. Near the right temporal was another break in the skin, which\nhere appeared much decayed. All the teeth were present, but they were\nnot particularly white nor good. The left forearm and hand were wanting,\nand the right was imperfect; the lower limbs were well preserved even to\nthe toe-nails.",
        "No. 3, also of large size, resembled No. 2; the upper limbs were\ncomplete, and the lower wanted only the toes of the left foot. The lower\njaw was absent, and the upper had no teeth. An oval depression, about an\ninch in its greater diameter, lay above the right orbit. If this be a\nbullet-mark, the mummy may date from before the final conquest and\nsubmission in A.D. 1496. But it may also have resulted from some\naccident, like a fall, or from the blow of a stone, a weapon which the\nGuanches used most skilfully. Mr. Sprat, confirmed by Glas, affirms that\nthey ’throw Stones with a force almost as great as that of a Bullet, and\nnow use Stones in all their fights as they did antiently.’",
        "No. 4, much smaller than the two former, was the best preserved. The\nshape of the skull and pelvis suggested a female; the arms also were\ncrossed in front over the body, whereas in the male mummy they were laid\nstraight. The legs were covered with skin; the hands were remarkably\nwell preserved, and the nails were darker than other parts. The tongue,\nin all four, was absent, having probably decayed.",
        "These crania were distinctly oval. The facial angle, well opened, and\nranging from 80° to 85°, counterbalanced the great development of the\nface, which showed an animal type. A little hair remained, coloured\nruddy-chestnut and straight, not woolly. The entrails had disappeared,\nand the abdominal walls not existing, it was impossible to detect the\nincisions by which the tanno-balsamic substances, noted by Bory de\nSaint-Vincent and many others, were introduced. The method appears\nuncertain. It is generally believed that after removing the entrails\nthrough an irregular cut made with the tabona, or obsidian\n(knife), the operators, who, as in Egypt, were of the lowest caste,\ninjected a corrosive fluid. They then filled the cavities with the\nbalsam described above; dried the corpse; and, after, fifteen to twenty\ndays, sewed it up in tanned goatskins. Such appears to have been the\ncase with the mummies under consideration.",
        "The catacombs, inviolable except to the sacrilegious, were numerous in\nthe rockiest and least accessible parts of the island. Mr. Addison found\nthem in the Cañádas del Pico, 7,700 feet above sea-level. [Footnote:\nTenerife: ’An Ascent of the Peak and Sketch of the Island,’ by Robert\nEdward Alison. Quarterly Journal of Science, Jan. 1806.] Hence it\nhas been remarked of the Guanches that, after a century of fighting,\nnothing remained of them but their mummies. The sharp saying is rather\nterse than true.",
        "The Guanches were barbarians, not savages. De Béthencourt’s two\nchaplains, speaking in their chronicle of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura,\ntell us ’there are many villages and houses, with numerous inhabitants.’\nThe ruins still found in the Isles are called ’casas hondas’ (\"deep\nhouses”); because a central excavation was surrounded by a low wall. The\ncastle of Zonzamas was built of large stones without lime. In Port\nArguineguin (Grand Canary) the explorers sent by Alfonso IV. (1341) came\nupon 300 to 400 tenements roofed with valuable wood, and so clean inside\nthat they seemed stuccoed. They encircled a larger building, probably\nthe residence of the chief. But the Tenerifans used only caves.",
        "The want of canoes and other navigating appliances in Guanche-land by no\nmeans proves that the emigration took place when the Canaries formed\npart of the Continent. The same was the case with the Australians, the\nTasmanians, and the New Zealanders. The Guanches, at the same time, were\nadmirable swimmers, easily able to cross the strait, nine miles wide,\nseparating Lanzarote from La Graciosa. They could even kill fish with\nsticks when in the water. The fattening of girls before marriage was,\nand is still, a Moroccan, not an Arab custom. The rude feudalism much\nresembled that of the Bedawi chiefs. George Glas, [Footnote: The\nHistory of the Discovery and Conquest of the Canary Islands,\n&c. 4to. London, 1764. I have given some notices of the unfortunate\n’master mariner’ in Wanderings in West Africa, vol. i. p. 79] or\nrather Abreu Galindo, his author, says of their marriages, ’None of the\nCanarians had more than one wife, and the wife one husband, contrary to\nwhat misinformed authors affirm.’ The general belief is that at the time\nof the conquest polyandry prevailed amongst the tribes. It may have\noriginated from their rude community of goods, and probably it became a\nlocal practice in order to limit population. Possibly, too, it was\nconfined to the noble and the priestly orders.",
        "Humboldt remarks, [Footnote: Personal Narrative, chap, i. p. 32,\nBohn’s ed. London, 1852.] ’We find no example of this polyandry except\namongst the people of Thibet.’ Yet he must have heard of the Nayr of\nMalabar, if not of the Todas on the Nilagiri Hills. D. Agustin Millares\n[Footnote: Historia de la Gran Canaria. Published at Las Palmas.]\nexplains the custom by ’men and women being born in almost equal\nproportions,’ the reverse being the fact. Equal proportions induce the\nmonogamic relation.",
        "Learned M. d’Avezac derives ’Guanche’ from Guansheri or Guanseri, a\nBerber tribe described by El-Idrisi and Leo Africanus. This is better\nthan finding it in the Keltic gwuwrn, gwen, white. Older\nauthorities hold it a corruption of ’Vinchune,’ the indigenous name of\nthe Nivarian race. Again, ’the inhabitants of Tenerife called themselves\nGuan (the Berber Wan), one person, Chinet or Chinerf, Tenerife; so that\nGuanchinet meant a man of Tenerife, and was easily corrupted to\nGuanche. Thus, too, Glas’s ’Captain Artemis’ was Guan-arteme, the one or\nchief ruler. Vieira derives ’Tenerf’ or’Chenerf’ from the last king; and\nold MSS. have ’Chenerife.’ The popular voice says it is composed of\n’Tener,’ mountain or snow, and of ’ryfe,’ snow or mountain. Pritchard\n[Footnote: Researches into the Physical History of Mankind, book\niii. chap. ii.] applied the term Guanche to all the Canarian races, and\nhe is reproached for error by M. de Macedo, [Footnote: ’Ethnological\nRemarks,’ &c., by J. J. de Costa de Macedo, of Lisbon, Royal\nGeographical Society’s Journal, vol. ii. p. 172. Wanderings in\nWest Africa, i. 116, contains my objections to his theory.] who\nwould limit it to the Tenerifans. The same occurs in the Eev. Mr. Delany\n[Footnote: Notes of a Residence in the Canary Islands,\n&c. London, 1861.]  and in Professor Piazzi Smyth, [Footnote: An\nAstronomer’s Experiment, p. 190. L. Reeve, London, 1868.] who speaks\nof the ’Guanches of Grand Canary and Teneriffe.’ According to popular\nusage all were right, ’Guanche’ being the local and general term for the\naborigines of the whole archipelago. But the scientific object that it\nincludes under the same name several different races.",
        "The language is also a point of dispute: some opine that all the\nislanders had one tongue, others that they were mutually unintelligible;\nmany that it was Berber (Numidian, Getulian, and Garamantan), a few that\nit was less distinctly Semitic. The two chaplains of De Béthencourt\n[Footnote: Bontier and Le Verrier, Histoire de la première Découverte\ne Conquête des Canaries. Bergeron, Paris, 1630.] noted its\nresemblance with that of the ’Moors’ of Barbary. Glas, who knew\nsomething of Shilha, or Western Berber, made the same observation. But\nthe Genoese pilot Niccoloso di Recco during the expedition of A.D. 1344\ncollected the numerals, and two of these, satti (7) and\ntamatti (8), are less near the original than the Berberan\nset and tem.",
        "The catalogue of Abreu Galindo, who lived here in 1591 and printed his\nhistory in 1632, preserves 122 words; Vieira only 107, and Bory de\nSaint-Vincent [Footnote: Essai sur les Iles fortunées. Humboldt\nhas only five.] 148. Webb and Berthelot give 909. Of these 200 are\nnouns, including 22 names of plants; 467 are placenames, and 242 are\nproper names. Many are questionable. For instance, sabor\n(council-place) is derived from cabocer, ’expression par laquelle\nles nègres de la Sénégambie dénotent la réunion de leurs chefs.’\n[Footnote: Vol. i. part i. p. 223.] As all know, it is the corrupted\nPortuguese caboceiro, a headman.",
        "Continuing our way from Tacoronte we reached Sauzal, beyond which the\ncoach did not then run; the old road was out of condition, and the new\nnot in working order. We offered a dollar each for carrying our light\ngear to sturdy men who were loitering and lying about the premises. They\nshook their heads, wrapped their old blanket-cloaks around them, and\nstretched themselves in the sun like dogs after a cold walk. I could\nhardly wonder. What wants have they? A covering for warmth, porridge for\nfood, and, above all, the bright sun and pure air, higher luxuries and\nbetter eudaemonics than purple and fine linen. At last some passing\nmuleteers relieved us of the difficulty.",
        "The way was crowded with Laguneros, conspicuous in straw-hats; cloth\njackets, red waistcoats embroidered at the back; bright crimson sashes;\nwhite knickerbockers, with black velveteen overalls, looking as if\n’pointed’ before and behind; brown hose or long leather gaiters\nornamented with colours, and untanned shoes. Despite the heat many wore\nthe Guanche cloak, a blanket (English) with a running string round the\nneck. The women covered their graceful heads with a half-square of white\nstuff, and deformed the coiffure by a hideous black billycock, an\nunpleasant memory of Wales. Some hundreds of men, women, and children\nwere working on the road, and we were surprised by the beauty of the\nrace, its classical outlines, oval contours, straight profiles,\nmagnificent hair, and blue-grey eyes with black lashes. This is not the\nresult of Guanche blood, as a town on the south-western part of the\nisland presently showed me. Also an orderly of Guanche breed from the\nparts about Arico, who had served for years at the palace, was pointed\nout as a type. He stood six feet four, with proportional breadth; his\nface was somewhat lozenge-shaped, his hair straight, black like a\nHindu’s, and his tawny skin looked only a little darker than that of\nPortuguese Algarves. The beauty of the islanders results from a mixture\nof Irish blood. During the Catholic persecution before 1823 many fled\nthe Emerald Isle to Tenerife, and especially to Orotava. The women’s\nfigures in youth are charming, tall, straight, and pliant as their own\npine-trees. All remark their graceful gait.",
        "We passed through places famed in the days of the conquest–La Matanza,\nthe native Orantapata, where De Lugo’s force was nearly annihilated. Now\nit is the half-way station to Orotava; and here the coche stops\nfor dinner, prices being regulated by Government. The single inn shows\nthe Pike, but not the subjacent valley. Then to Acentejo, the local\nRoncesvalles, where the invaders were saved only by St. Michael; and\nnext to La Vitoria, where they avenged themselves. At Santa Ursula we\nfirst saw the slopes of Orotava, the Guanche Tavro or Atanpalata; and on\nthe Cuesta de la Villa we were shown near its mark, a date-palm, the\ncave that sheltered the patriot chief, unfortunate Bencomo. As the\nfashionables came forth to walk and drive we passed the calvario\nand the place leading to the Villa Orotava, and found quarters in\nthe fonda of D. José Gobea. The sala, or chief room, some\n30 feet long, wanted only an Eastern divan round the walls; it was\neasily converted into a tolerable place of bivouac, and here we resolved\nto try country life for a while.",
        "The first aspect of the Orotava Tempe was disappointing after Humboldt’s\ndictum, ’Voici ce qu’il y a de plus délicieux au monde.’  But our\ndisappointment was the natural reaction of judgment from fancy to\nreality, which often leads to a higher appreciation. At last we learned\nwhy the Elysian [Footnote: In Arabic El-Lizzat, the Delight, or from the\nold Egyptian Aahlu,] Fields, the Fortunate Islands, the Garden of\nthe Hesperides–where the sea is no longer navigable, and where Atlas\nsupports the firmament on a mountain conical as a cylinder; the land of\nevening, of sunset, where Helios sinks into the sea, and where Night\nbore the guardians of the golden apples–were such favourites with the\npoets. And we came to love every feature of the place, from the snowy\nPike of Teyde flushing pink in the morning sun behind his lofty rampart,\nto the Puerto, or lower town, whose three several reef-gates are outlaid\nby creamy surf, and whose every shift of form and hue stands distinct in\nthe transparent and perfumed air. The intermediate slopes are clothed\nwith a vegetation partly African, partly European; and here Humboldt, at\nthe end of the last century, proposed to naturalise the chinchona.",
        "La Villa lies some two miles and a half from and about 1,140 feet above\nthe Puerto; and the streets are paved and precipitous as any part of\nFunchal. The population varied from 7,000 to 8,000 souls, whereas the\nlower town had only 3,500. It contains a few fine houses with huge\nhanging balconies and interior patios (courts) which would\naccommodate a regiment. They date from the ’gente muy caballerosa’\n(knightly folk) of three centuries ago. The feminine population appeared\nexcessive, the reason being that some five per cent. of the youths go to\nHavannah and after a few years return ’Indianos,’ or ’Indios,’ our old\n’nabobs.’",
        "At the Puerto we were most kindly received by the late British\nVice-Consul, Mr. Goodall, who died about the normal age, seventy-seven:\nif this be safely passed man in Tenerife becomes a macrobian. All was\ndone for our comfort by the late Mr. Carpenter, who figures in the\n’Astronomer’s Experiment’ as ’the interpreter.’  Amongst the scanty\npublic diversions was the Opera. The Villa theatre occupied an ancient\nchurch: the length of the building formed pit, boxes, and gallery; and\n’La Sonnambula’ descended exactly where the high altar had been. At the\nPuerto an old monastery was chosen for ’La Traviata:’ the latter was\nrealistic as Crabbe’s poetry; even in bed the unfortunate ’Misled’ one\ncould not do without a certain truncated cylinder of acajou. I sighed\nfor the Iberian ’Zarzuela,’ that most charming opera buffa which\ntakes its name from a ’pleasaunce’ in the Pardo Palace near Madrid.",
        "The hotel diet was peculiarly Spanish; already the stews and ’pilaffs’\n(puláos) of the East begin in embryo. The staple dish was the\npuchero, or cocido, which antiquated travellers still call\n’olla podrida’ (pot-pourri). This lesso or bouilli consists\nof soup, beef, bacon, and garbanzos (chick-peas, or Cicer\narietinium) in one plate, and boiled potatoes and small gourds\n(bubangos) in another. The condiments are mostly garlic\nand saffron, preferred to mustard and chillies. The pastry, they tell\nme, is excellent.",
        "In those days the Great Dragon Tree had not yet lost its upper cone by\nthe dreadful storm of January 3, 1868; thus it had survived by two\ncenturies and a half the Garoe Laurel, or Arbol Santo, the miraculous\ntree of Hierro (Ferro). It stood in the garden of the Marquez de Sauzal,\nwho would willingly have preserved it. But every traveller had his own\ninfallible recipe, and the proprietor contented himself with propping up\nthe lower limbs by poles. It stood upon a raised bank of masonry-work,\nand the north-east side showed a huge cavity which had been stopped with\nstone and lime. About half a century ago one-third came down, and in\n1819 an arm was torn off and sent, I believe, to Kew. When we saw the\nfragment it looked mostly like tinder, or touchwood, ’eld-gamall,’\nstone-old, as the Icelanders say. Near it stood a pair of tall\ncypresses, and at some distance a venerable palm-tree, which ’relates to\nit,’ according to Count Gabriel de Belcastel,",
        "[Footnote: I quote from the Spanish translation, Las Islas Canarias y\nel Valle Orotava, a highly popular work contrasting wonderfully with\nsome of ours. The courteous Frenchman even promised that Morocco would\nbe the Algeria of the Canaries. His observations for temperature,\npressure, variation, hygrometry, and psychrometry of the Orotavan\nclimate, which he chose for health, are valuable. He starts with a\ntheory of the three conditions of salubrity–heat-and-cold, humidity,\nand atmospheric change.

        "Naturalists modestly assigned to the old Dragon 5,000 to 10,000 years,\nthus giving birth to fine reflections about its witnessing revolutions\nwhich our planet underwent prior to the advent of man. So Adamson made\nhis calabash a contemporary of the Noachian Deluge, if that partial\ncataclysm [Footnote: The ancient Egyptians, who ignored the Babylonian\nDeluge, well knew that all cataclysms are local, not general,\ncatastrophes.] ever reached Africa. The Orotava relic certainly was an\nold tree, prophetic withal, [Footnote: It was supposed infallibly to\npredict weather and to regulate sowing-time. Thus if the southern side\nflowered first drought was to be expected, and vice versa. Now the\npeasant refers to San Isidro, patron of Orotava: he has only changed the\nform of his superstition.] when De Lugo and the conquistadores\nentered the valley in 1493 and said mass in its hollow. But that event\nwas only four centuries ago, and dates are ticklish things when derived\nfrom the rings and wrinkles of little-studied vegetation. Already\nMr. Diston, in a letter to Professor Piazzi Smyth, [Footnote:\n’Astronomical Experiment on the Peak of Tenerife,’ Philosoph.\nTrans., part ii. for 1858.]  declared that a young ’dragon,’\nwhich he had planted in 1818, became in 38 years so tall that\na ladder was required to reach the head. And let us observe that Nature,\nthough forbidden such style of progression by her savans,\nsometimes does make a local saltus, especially in the change of\nclimates. Centuries ago, when the fires about Teyde were still alight,\nand the lava-fields about Orotava were still burning, the rate of\ndraconian increase, under the influence of heat and moisture, might have\nbeen treble or quadruple what it would now be.",
        "[Footnote: The patriarch was no ’giant of the forest.’ Its stature did\nnot exceed 60 feet. Humboldt made it only 45 French feet(= 47 ft. ll\nins. English) round the base. Dr. Wilde (Narrative, p. 40) blames\nthe measurer and gives about the same measurement, Professor Piazzi\nSmyth, who in 1856 reproduced it in an abominable photo-stenograph,\nreckons 48.5 feet at the level of the southern foot, 35.6 feet at 6 feet\nabove the ground, and 28.8 feet at 14.5 feet, where branches spring from\nthe rapidly narrowing conical trunk. The same are said to have been its\nproportions in the days of the conquest. In 1866 Mr. Addison made it 60\nfeet tall, 35.5 feet at 6 feet from the ground, and 49.5 in\ncircumference at the base which he cleared. Mr. Barker Webb’s sketch in\n1830 was the best; but the tree afterwards greatly changed.\nMr. J. J. Williams made a neat drawing in boarding-school\nstyle, with a background apparently borrowed from Richmond Hill.]",

        "as far back as 1799, still flourishes. It was founded in 1788-95 by an\nable savan, the Marquis de Villanueva del Pardo (D. Alonso de\nNava y Grimon), who to a Government grant of 1,000l. added\n4,000l. of his own, besides 400l. a year for an average\ngeneration. The place is well chosen, for the Happy Valley combines the\nflora of the north and the south, with a Nivaria of snow-land above it\nand a semi-tropical temperature on the shores of the ’Chronian Sea.’",
        "THE ROUTINE ASCENT OF MOUNT ATLAS, THE ’PIKE’ OF TENERIFE.",
        "The trip was so far routine that we followed in the steps of all\nprevious travellers, and so far not routine that we made it in March,\nwhen, according to all, the Mal Pais is impassable, and when furious\nwinds threaten to sweep away intruders like dry leaves.",
        "[Footnote: The usual months are July and August. Captain Baudin, not\nfavourably mentioned by Humboldt, ascended in December 1797 with M. Le\nGros and the naturalists Advenier, Mauger, and Riedlé. He rolled down\nfrom half-way on the cone to the bottom of La Rambleta, and was stopped\nonly by a snow-covered lava-heap. Mr. Addison chose February, when he\n’suffered more from enormous radiation than from cold.’ He justifies his\nchoice (p. 22) by observing that ’the seasons above are much earlier\nthan they are below, consequently the latter part of the spring is the\nbest season to visit the Peak.’ In October, at an elevation of 10,700\nfeet, he found the cold greater than it was in February. In July 1863 I\nrode round the island, to the Cumbre pumice-plains, and by no means\nenjoyed the southern ride. A place near Guimar showed me thirty-six\nbarrancos (deep ravines) to be crossed within three leagues.]",
        "The good folk of the Villa, indeed, declared that the Ingleza could\nnever reach even the Estancia de los Inglezes.",
        "Our train was modest–a pair of nags with their attendants, and two\nexcellent sumpter-mules carrying provisions and blankets. The guide was\nManoel Reyes, who has already appeared in the ’Specialities of a\nResidence Above the Clouds.’ He is a small, wizen-faced man, quiet,\nself-contained, and fond–exceedingly fond–of having his own way. By\ndint of hard work we left the Fonda Gobea at 9 A.M. on March 23, with\nloud cries of ’Mulo!’ and ’Anda, caballo!’ and ’So-o-o!’ when the\nbât-beasts indulged in a free fight.",
        "Morning smiled upon our incept. Nothing could be lovelier than the\nweather as we crossed the deluging Martinianez Fiumara; struck the\ncoast-road westward, and then, bending to the south-west, made for the\n’Gate of Taoro,’ a gap in the Cañáda-wall. From the higher level truly\ncharming was the aspect of Orotava: it was Funchal many times\nimproved. Beyond the terraced foreground of rich deep yellow clay,\ngrowing potatoes, wheat, and the favourite chochos (lupines),\nwith apple and chestnut trees, the latter of two kinds, and the lower\nfields marked out by huge agaves, lay the Happy Valley. Its contrast of\nvivid greens, of white quintas, of the two extinct volcanos\noverlooking Orotava, and of the picturesque townlets facing the misty\nblue sea, fringed with a ceaseless silvery surf by the brisa, or\nnorth-east trade, the lord of these latitudes, had not a symptom of the\nMadeiran monotony of verdure. Behind us towered high the snowy Pilon\n(Sugar-loaf), whose every wave and fold were picked out by golden\nsunlight, azure half-light, and purple shade.",
        "As we advanced up the Camiño de Chasna, a road only by name, the\nquintas were succeeded by brown-thatched huts, single or in\nclumps. On the left, 3,400 feet above sea-level, stood the Pino del\nDornajito (’of the Little Trough’), one of the few survivors in this\nonce wealthy pine-ground. The magnificent old tree, which was full grown\nin the days of the conquest, and which in the seventeenth century was a\nfavourite halting-point, suffered severely from the waterspout of\nNovember 7, 1826; but still measured 130 feet long by 29 in girth. The\nvegetation now changed. We began brushing through the arbutus\n(callicarpa), the wild olive (Olea excelsa), the Canarian\noak, the daphne, the myrtle entwined with indigenous ivy (Hedera\ncanariensis); the cytisus, the bright green hypericum of three\nspecies, thyme, gallworts, and arborescent and other ferns in numbers,\nespecially the hare’s-foot and the peculiar Asplenium canariense,\nthe Trichomanes canariensis, and the Davallia canariensis;\nthe brezo (Erica aborea and E. scoparia), a heath\nwhose small white bells scented the air; and the luxuriant blackberry,\nused to fortify the drystone walls. The dew-cloud now began to float\nupwards from the sea in scarf-shape, only a few hundred feet thick; it\nhad hangings and fringes where it was caught by the rugged hill-flanks;\nand above us globular masses, white as cotton bales, rolled over one\nanother. As in the drier regions of Africa the hardly risen sun made\nitself felt.",
        "At 10.20 A.M. we had passed out of the cultivated region to the Montijo,\nor Monte Verde, the laurel-region. The ’wood’ is the remains of a fine\nforest accidentally fired by charcoal-burners; it is now a copse of\narborescent heath-worts, ilex (I. Perado), and Faya\n(Myrica Faya), called the ’Portugal laurel,’ some growing ten\nfeet high. We then entered upon rough ground, El Juradillo (’the\nHollow’); this small edition of the Mal Pais, leading to the Canadas, is\na mass of lava-beds and dry barrancos (ravines) grooved and\nsheeted by rushing torrents. The latter show the anatomy of the\nland–tufas, lavas, conglomerates, trachytes, trachydolerites, and\nbasalts of various kinds. Most of the rocks are highly magnetic, and are\nseparated by thin layers of humus with carbonised plant-roots. Around\nEl Juradillo rises a scatter of montanetas, shaped like\nhalf-buried eggs: originally parasitic cones, they evidently connect\nwith the main vent. About 1 P.M., after four hours’ ride, we dismounted\nat the Estancia de la Sierra (6,500 feet); it is a pumice-floor a few\nfeet broad, dotted with bush and almost surrounded by rocks that keep\noff a wind now blowing cold and keen. Consequently, as broken pots and\nbottles show, it is a favourite resting-place.",
        "After halting an hour we rode up a slope whose obtuser talus showed that\nwe were reaching the far-famed platform, called Las Cañádas del\nPico. The word, here meaning level ground, not, as usual, a canefield,\napplies especially to the narrow outer rim of the hollow plain; a\nbristling fortification of bluffs, pointing inwards, and often tilted to\nquoins 300 feet high, with an extreme of 1,000. Trachyte and basalt,\nwith dykes like Cyclopean walls, are cut to jagged needles by the\nfurious north-easter. Around the foot, where it is not encumbered with\ndébris like the base of an iceberg, a broad line of comminuted\npumice produces vegetation like a wady-growth in Somali Land. The\ncentral bed allows no short cut across: it is a series of rubbish-heaps,\nparasitic cones, walls, and lumps of red-black lavas, trachytes, and\nphonolites reposing upon a deluge of frozen volcanic froth ejected by\nearly eruptions. The aspect was rejoicing as the Arabian desert: I would\nwillingly have spent six months in the purest of pure air.",
        "These flats of pumice, ’stones of emptiness,’ loose incoherent matter,\nare the site of the first great crater. Tenerife is the type of a\nthree-storied volcano, as Stromboli is of one and Vesuvius of two\nstages. The enormous diameter of this ancient feature is eight by seven\nmiles, with a circumference of twenty-three–greater even than\nHawaii–and here one feels that our earth was once a far sublimer\nscene. Such forms belong to the earlier volcanic world, and astronomers\nstill suspect them in the moon. [Footnote: Las Cañádas was shown to be a\nvolcanic crater in 1803 by Professor Cordier, the first scientific\nvisitor in modern days (Lettre à Devilliers fils), and in 1810 by\nD. Francisco Escobar (Estadistica). They make the old vent ten\nleagues round.] The altitude is 6,900 feet, nearly double the height of\nVesuvius (3,890 feet); and the lines sweep upwards towards the Pilon,\nwhere they reach 8,950 feet.",
        "The tints of Las Cañádas, seen from above, are the tenderest yellow and\na brownish red, like the lightest coat of vegetation turning ruddy in\nthe sun. Where level, Las Cañádas is a floor of rapilli and\npumice-fragments, none larger than a walnut, but growing bigger as they\napproach the Pike. The colours are dun (barriga de monja),\ngolden-yellow, and brown burnt red like autumnal leaves. There is\nmarvellous colouring upon the bluffs and ridges of the rim–lamp-black\nand brown-black, purple (light and dark), vermilion-red, and sombre hues\nsuperficially stained ruddy by air-oxygen. The picture is made brighter\nby the leek-green vegetation and by the overarching vault of glaring\nblue. Nor are the forms less note-worthy. Long centuries of weathering\nhave worked the material into strange shapes–here a ruined wall, there\nan old man with a Jesuit’s cap; now a bear, then a giant python. It is\nthe oldest lava we have yet seen, except the bed of the Orotava\nvalley. The submarine origin is denoted by fossils found in the flank;\nthey are of Miocene age, like those common in Madeira, and they were\nknown as early as the days of Clavijo (1772).",
        "Las Canadas is not wholly a ’dead creation;’ the birds were more\nnumerous than on the plains. A powerful raptor, apparently an eagle with\nblack-barred wings, hung high in air amongst the swallows winging their\nway northwards, and the Madeiran sparrow-hawk was never out of sight;\nravens, unscared by stone-throwing boys, flew over us unconcernedly,\nwhile the bushes sheltered many blackbirds, the Canary-bird\n(Fringilla canaria) showed its green belly and grey back and\nwings, singing a note unknown to us; and an indigenous linnet\n(F. teydensis), small and green-robed, hopped over the ground\ntame as a wren. We saw nothing of the red-legged partridge or the\nTetraonidae, reported to be common.",
        "The scattered growths were composed of the broomy Codeso and\nRetama. The former (Adenocarpus frankenoides), a leguminous\nplant, showed only dense light-green leaves without flower,\nand consequently without their heavy, cloying perfume. The woody stem\nacts in these regions as the doornboom of South Africa, the wild\nsage of the western prairies, and the shih (absinthium) of\nthe Arabian desert. The Arabic Retama, or Alpine broom\n(Cytisus fragrans, Lam.; Cyt. nubigenus, Decan.; Spartium\nnubigenum, Alton and Von Buch), is said to be peculiar\nto Tenerife, where it is not found under one vertical mile of\nheight. Some travellers divide it into two species, Spartium\nmonospermum and S. nubigenum. The bush, 9 to 10 feet tall by 7 to\n15 inches diameter, is easily distinguished from the Codeso by\nits denser and deeper green. This pretty rounded growth, with its short\nbrown stem throwing out lateral branches which trail on the ground,\nflavours meat, and might be naturalised in Europe. From June till August\nit is covered with a profusion of white blossoms, making Las Canadas a\nHymettus, an apiarian heaven. It extends as far as the second cone, but\nthere it shrinks to a foot in height. We did not see the tree growing,\nbut we met a party of Chasna men, [Footnote: A romantic tale is told of\nthe origin of Chasna. In 1496, before the wars ended, one Pedro de\nBracamonte, a captain under De Lugo, captured a ’belle sauvage,’ who\nmade her escape after a few days. He went about continually repeating,\n’Vi la flor del valle’ (I saw the valley flower), and died after three\nmonths. His soldiers buried him and priests said masses for the soul of\nthis ’hot amorist.’] driving asses like onagers, laden with the gummy\nwood of the Tea or Tiya pine (P. canariensis). The\nvaluable material, which resists damp and decay for centuries, and which\nDecandolle declares would grow in Scotland, is rapidly disappearing from\nthe Pinals. The travellers carried cochineal-seed, for which their\nvillage is famous, and a hive which might have been Abyssinian. It was a\nhollow cylinder of palm-bole, closed with board at either end; in July\nand August it is carried up the mountain, where the bees cannot destroy\nthe grapes. We searched in vain for M. Broussonet’s white violet\n(V. teydensis), [Footnote: Humboldt’s five zones of vegetation on\nthe Pike are vines, laurels, pines, broom, and grasses (p. 116).\nMr. Addison modifies this scale to vines, laurels, pines and\njunipers, mountain-brooms and pumice-plains, I should distribute the\nheights as growing cochineal, potatoes, and cereals, chestnuts, pines,\nheaths, grasses, and bare rock.] and for the lilac-coloured Viola\ncheiranthifolia, akin to V. decumbens.",
        "The average annual temperature of Las Canadas is that of N. latitude 53\ndegrees, Holland and Hanover; in fact, here it is the Pyrenees, and\nbelow it Africa. The sun blazed from a desert of blue, and the waving\nheat-reek rose trembling and quivering from the tawny sides of the\nforegrounds. The clouds, whose volumes were disposed like the leaves of\na camellia, lay far down to the north-east, as if unable to face the\nfires of day. And now the great trachytic dome, towering in the\ntranslucent air, was the marking feature. Its angle, 35 to 42 degrees,\nor double that of the lower levels, suggests distant doubts as to its\npracticability, nor could we believe that it rises 3,243 feet above its\nwestern base, Las Cañádas. The summit, not including the terminal\nPilon–a comparatively dwarf cone [Footnote: There is a very bad sketch\nof the Pike in Mr. Scrope’s popular work on Volcanoes (p. 5); the\neruptive chimney is far too regularly conical.]–is ribboned with\nclinker, and streaked at this season with snow-lines radiating, like\nwheel-spokes from a common centre. Here and there hang, at an impossible\nangle, black lava-streams which were powerless to reach the plain: they\nresembled nothing so much as the gutterings of a candle hardening on the\noutside of its upright shaft. Evidently they had flowed down the slope\nin a half fluid state, and had been broken by contraction when\ncooling. In places, too, the surface was streaked with light yellow\npatches, probably of sun-gilt tosa or pumice.",
        "On our right, or to the north-north-east of the Pike, rose La Fortaleza,\nalias the Golliada del Cedro. The abrupt wall had salient and\nre-entering angles, not unlike the Palisades of the Hudson River, with\nintercalated strata and a smooth glacis at the base, except between the\neast and north-west, where the periphery has been destroyed. It is\napparently basalt, as we may expect in the lower levels before reaching\nthe trachytic region. The other notable features were Monte Tigayga,\nwith its vertical cliff, trending northwards to the sea; the gap through\nwhich the Orotava lava-bed burst the crater-margin; the Llano de Maja\n(’Manja’ in Berthelot), a strip of Las Canadas, and the horizontally\nstriated Peak of Guajara (8,903 feet).",
        "Riding over the ’pumice-beach of a once fiery sea,’ whose glare and\nother accidents suggested the desert between Cairo and Suez, we made our\nway towards the Rastrojito. This ’Little Stubble’ is a rounded heap of\npumice, a southern offset of the main mountain. On the left rose the\nMontana Negra (Black Mountain) and the Lomo de la Nieve (’Snow Ridge),’\na dark mass of ribbed and broken lavas (8,970 feet), in which\nsummer-snow is stored. A little black kid, half wild, was skipping over\nthe rocks. Our men pursued it with the garrotes (alpenstocks),\nloudly shouting,’ Tio Jose!’: ’Uncle Joseph,’ however, escaped, running\nlike a Guanche. Here it is allowed to shoot the animals on condition of\nleaving a shilling with the skin. The latter is used in preparing the\nnational gofio, the Guanche ahoren, the kuskusu of\nnorth-western Africa, the polenta, or daily bread, of the\nNeo-Latins.",
        "Climbing the Rastrojito slopes, we sighted the Pedras Negras: these are\nhuge travelled rocks of basalt, jet-black, breaking with a conchoidal\nfracture, and showing debris like onion-coats about their base. The\naspect was fantastic, resembling nothing so much as skulls 10 to 15 feet\nhigh. They are doubtless the produce of the upper slopes, which by slow\ndegrees gravitated to the present pumice-beds.",
        "The first step of the Pike is Las Canadas, whose glacis forms the\nCumbre, or pumice-plains (6,500 feet), the long dorsum, which\nshows far out at sea. Bending abruptly to the east, we began to breast\nthe red pumice-bed leading to the Estancia de Abajo or de los\nInglezes. ’El es Inglez porque subio al Pico’ (’he is English, because\nhe climbed the Pike’), say the people. This ramp, whose extreme angle is\n26 degrees, bordered by thick bands of detached lava-rocks, is doubtless\nthe foundation-matter of the Pike. Hence the latter is picturesquely\ntermed ’Hijo de las Canadas.’ [Footnote: Especially by D. Benigno\nCarballo Wanguement in his work, Las Afortunadas (Madrid, 1862),\na happy title borrowed from D. Francisco Escobar. Heyley\n(Cosmography), quoted by Glas and Mrs. Murray, tells us of an\nEnglish ambassador who, deeming his own land the ’Fortunate Islands,’\nprotested against Pope Clement VI. so entitling the Canaries in a deed\nof gift to D. Luis de la Cerda, the ’Disinherited’ Conde de\nClaramonte. The latter was deprived of the Crown of Castile by his\nuncle, Sancho IV., and became the founder of the Medina Celi house.]",
        "After a total climb and ride of six hours, we reached the ’English\nstation.’ M. Eden (Aug. 13, 1715) [Footnote: Trans. Royal Soc. of\nLondon, 1714-16.] calls it simply Stancha, and M. Borda ’Station des\nRochers.’ Pere Feutree, a Frenchman who ascended in 1524, and wrote the\nearliest scientific account, had baptised it Station de St. Francois de\nPaul, and set up a cross. It is a shelf in the pumice-slope, 9,930 feet\nhigh, and protected against the cold night-winds of the\nnorth-north-east, the lower or polar current, by huge boulders of\nobsidian, like gigantic sodawater-bottles. The routine traveller sleeps\nupon this level a few hundred yards square, because the guides store\ntheir fuel in an adjacent bed of black rocks. Humboldt miscalls the\nstation ’a kind of cavern;’ and a little above it he nearly fell on the\nslippery surface of the ’compact short-swarded turf’ which he had left\n4,000 feet below him.",
        "The bât-mules were unpacked and fed; and a rough bed was made up under\nthe lea of the tallest rock, where a small curral of dry stone\nkept off the snow. This, as we noticed in Madeira, is not in flakes, nor\nin hail-like globes: it consists of angular frozen lumps, and the\nselvage becomes the hardest ice. Some have compared it with the Swiss\n’firn,’ snow stripped of fine crystals and granulated by time and\nexposure. In March the greatest depth we saw in the gullies radiating\nfrom the mountain-top was about three feet. But in the cold season all\nmust be white as a bride-cake; and fatal accidents occur in the Canada\ndrifts. Professor Piazzi Smyth characterises the elevated region as cold\nenough at night, and stormy beyond measure in winter, when the\nsouth-wester, or equatorial upper current, produces a fearful\nclimate. Yet the Pike summit lies some 300 feet below the snow-line\n(12,500 feet).",
        "The view was remarkable: we were in sight of eighty craters. At sunset\nthe haze cleared away from the horizon, which showed a straight\ngrey-blue line against a blushing sky of orange, carmine, pale pink, and\ntender lilac, passing through faint green into the deep dark blue of the\nzenith. In this cumbre, or upper region, the stars did not\nsurprise us by their brightness. At 6 P.M. the thermometer showed 32\ndegrees F.; the air was delightfully still and pure, [Footnote: We had\nno opportunity of noticing what Mr. Addison remarks, the air becoming\nsonorous and the sound of the sea changing from grave to acute after\nsunset and during the night. He attributes this increased intensity to\nadditional moisture and an equability of temperature in the atmospheric\nstrata. Perhaps the silence of night may tend to exaggerate the\nimpression.] and Death mummifies, but does not decay.",
        "A bright fire secured us against the piercing dry night-cold; and the\narrieros began to sing like capirotes [Footnote: The\nCapirote or Tinto Negro, a grey bird with black head\n(Sylvia atricapilla), is also found in Madeira, and much\nresembles the Eastern bulbul or Persian nightingale. It must be caged\nwhen young, otherwise it refuses to sing, and fed upon potatos and bread\nwith milk, not grain. An enthusiast, following Humboldt (p. 87),\ndescribes the ’joyous and melodious notes’ of the bird as ’the purest\nincense that can ascend to heaven.’] (bulbuls), sundry seguidillas,\nand El Tajaraste. The music may be heard everywhere between Morocco\nand Sind. It starts with the highest possible falsetto and gradually\nfalls like a wail, all in the minor clef.",
        "We rose next morning with nipped feet and hands, which a cup of hot\ncoffee, ’with,’ speedily corrected, and were en route at 4.30\nA.M. Formerly animals were left at the lower estancia; now they\nare readily taken on to Alta Vista. My wife rode a sure-footed black\nnag, I a mule which was perfect whilst the foot-long lever acting curb\nlay loose on its neck. Returning, we were amazed at the places they had\npassed during the moonless night.",
        "Our path skirted the Estancia de los Alemanos, about 300 yards higher\nthan the English, and zig-zagged sharply up the pumice-slope. The talus\nnow narrowed; the side-walls of dark trachytic blocks pinching it in. At\nthis grisly hour they showed the quaintest figures–towers and\npinnacles, needles and tree-trunks, veiled nuns and monstrous\nbeasts. Amongst them were huge bombs of obsidian, and masses with\ntranslucent, vitreous edges that cut like glass. Most of them contained\ncrystals of felspar and pyroxene.",
        "After half an hour we reached the dwarf platform of Alta Vista, 700 feet\nabove the Estancia and 10,730, in round numbers, above sea-level. The\nlittle shelf, measuring about 100 to 300 yards, at the head of the fork\nwhere the north-eastern and the south-western lava-streams part, is\ndivided by a medial ledge. Here we saw the parent rock of the pumice\nfragments, an outcrop of yellowish brown stone, like fractured and\nhardened clay. The four-footed animals were sent back: one rides up but\nnot down such places.",
        "Passing in the lower section the shell of a house where the Astronomer’s",
        "[Footnote: The author came out in 1856 to make experiments in\nastronomical observations. Scientific men have usually a contempt for\nlanguage: we find the same in Our Inheritanse, &c. (Dalby & Co.,\nLondon, 1877), where the poor modern hierogrammats are not highly\nappreciated. But it is a serious blemish to find ’Montana Blanco,’\n’Malpays,’ ’Chahzorra’ (for Chajorra), and ’Tiro del Guanches.’ The\nauthor also is wholly in error about Guanche mummification. He derides\n(p. 329) the shivering and shaking of his Canarian guide under a cloudy\nsky of 40°F., when the sailor enjoyed it in their ’glorious strength of\nSaxon (?) constitution.’ But when the latter were oppressed and\ndiscouraged by dry heat and vivid radiation, Manoel was active as a\nchamois. Why should enduring cold and not heat be held as a test of\nmanliness?]",
        "experiment had been tried, Guide Manoel pointed out the place where\nstood the tormentos, as he called the instruments. Thence we\ntoiled afoot up the Mal Pais. This ’bad country’ is contradictorily\ndescribed by travellers. Glas (A.D. 1761) makes it a sheet of rock\ncracked cross-wise into cubes. Humboldt (1799) says, ’The lava, broken\ninto sharp pieces, leaves hollows in which we risked falling up to our\nwaists.’ Von Buch (1815) mentions ’the sharp edges of glassy obsidian,\nas dangerous as the blades of knives.’ Wilde (1857) tamely paints the\nscene as a ’magnified rough-cast.’ Prof. Piazzi Smyth is, as usual,\nexact, but he suggests more difficulty than the traveller finds. I saw\nnothing beyond a succession of ridge-backs and shrinkage-crevasses,\ndisposed upon an acute angle. These ragged, angular, and mostly cuboidal\nblocks, resembling the ice-pack of St. Lawrence River, have apparently\nbeen borne down by subsequent lava-currents, which, however, lacked\nimpetus to reach the lower levels of Las Cañádas.",
        "Springing from boulder to boulder, an exhilarating exercise for a time,\nover a ’surface of horrible roughness,’ as Prof. Dana says of Hawaii, we\nhalted to examine the Cueva de Hielo, whose cross has long succumbed to\nthe wintry winds. The ’ice-house’ in a region of fire occupies a little\nplatform like the ruined base of a Pompey’s Pillar. This is the table\nupon which the neveros pack their stores of snow. The cave, a\nmere hole in the trachytic lava, opens to the east with an entrance some\nfour feet wide. The general appearance was that of a large bubble in a\nbaked loaf. Inside we saw a low ceiling spiky with stalactites, possibly\nicicles, and a coating of greenish ice upon the floor. A gutter leads\nfrom the mouth, showing signs of water-wear, and the blocks of trachyte\nare so loaded with glossy white felspar that I attempted to dust them\nbefore sitting down.",
        "Local tradition connects this ice-cave with the famous burial-cavern\nnear Ycod, on the northern coast; this would give a tunnel 8 miles long\nand 11,040 feet high. Many declare that the meltings ebb and flow with\nthe sea-tide, and others recount that lead and lines of many fathoms\nfailed to touch bottom. We are told about the normal dog which fell in\nand found its way to the shore through the cave of Ycod de los Vinos. In\nthe latter a M. Auber spent four hours without making much way; in parts\nhe came upon scatters of Guanche bones. Mr. Robert Edwards, of Santa\nCruz, recounted another native tradition–that before the eruption of\nA.D. 1705 there was a run of water but no cave. Mr. Addison was let down\ninto it, and found three branches or lanes, the longest measuring 60-70\nfeet. What the neveros call el hombre de nieve (the\nsnow-man) proved to be a honeycombed mass of lava revetted with\nice-drippings. He judged the cave to be a crater of emission; and did\nnot see the smoke or steam issuing from it as reported by the\nice-collectors.",
        "Professor P. Smyth goes, I think, a little too far in making this\ncontemptible feature compose such a quarrel as that between the English\neruptionist and the Continental upheavalist. Deciding a disputed point,\nthat elevation is a force and a method in nature, he explains the cave\nby the explosion of gases, which blew off the surface of the dome, ’when\nthe heavy sections of the lava-roof, unsupported from below, fell\ndownward again, wedging into and against each other, so as nearly to\nreform their previous figure.’ But the unshattered state of the stones\nand the rounded surfaces of the sides show no sign of explosion. The\nupper Piton is unfitted for retaining water, which must percolate\nthrough its cinders, pumices, and loose matter into many a reservoir\nformed by blowing-holes. Snow must also be drifted in and retain, the\ncold. Moisture would be kept in the cavern by the low conducting power\nof its walls; so Lyell found, on Etna, a bed of solid ice under a\nlava-current. Possibly also this cave has a frozen substratum, like many\nof the ice-pools in North America.",
        "We then toiled up to another little estancia, a sheltered,\nrock-girt hollow. The floor of snow, or rather frozen rain, was\nsprinkled with red dust, and fronts the wind, with sharp icy points\nrising at an angle of 45°. Here, despite the penetrating cold, we\ngravely seated ourselves to enjoy at ease the hardly won pleasures of\nthe sunrise. The pallid white gleam of dawn had grown redder, brighter\nand richer. An orange flush, the first breaking of the beams faintly\nreflected from above, made the sky, before a deep and velvety\nblack-blue, look like a gilt canopy based upon a rim of azure mist. The\nbrilliancy waxed golden and more golden still; the blending of the\ncolours became indescribably beautiful; and, lastly, the sun’s upper\nlimb rose in brightest saffron above the dimmed and spurious horizon of\nnorth-east cloud. The panorama below us emerged dimly and darkly from a\ntorrent of haze, whose waving convex lines, moving with a majestic calm,\nwore the aspect of a deluge whelming the visible world. Martin the Great\nmight have borrowed an idea from this waste of waters, as it seemed to\nbe, heaving and breaking, surging and sweeping over the highest\nmountain-tops. We saw nothing of the immense triangular gnomon projected\nby the Pilon as far as Gomera Island, [Footnote: At sunset of July 10,\n1863, I could trace it extending to Grand Canary, darkening the southern\nhalf and leaving the northern in bright sunshine: the right limb was\nbetter defined than the left.]  and gradually contracting as the lamp of\nday rises. Item, we saw nothing of the archipelago like a map in relief;\nthe latter, however, is rarely visible in its entirety. Disappointment!",
        "During the descent we had a fair prospect of the Canarian\nTriquetra. Somewhat like Madeira, it has a longitudinal spine of\nmountains, generically called Las Cañádas; but, whilst the volcanic\nridge of the Isle of Wood runs in a latitudinal line, the Junonian\nCordillera has a whorl, the ancient as well as the modern seat of\neruption. Around the island appeared to be a rim, as if the sea-horizon\nformed a raised saucer–a common optical delusion at these altitudes.",
        "As we advanced the Mal Pais became more broken: the ’bad step’ was ugly\nclimbing, and we often envied our men, who wore heelless shoes of soft\nuntanned leather with soles almost as broad as they were long. The\nroughness of the trachytic blocks, however, rendered a slip\nimpossible. At 6.45 we reached the second floor of this three-storied\nvolcano, here 11,721 feet high. The guides call it the Pico del\nPilon, because it is the ancient Peak-Crater, and strangers the\nRambleta (not Rembleta) Volcano, which strewed Las Cañádas with fiery\npumice, and which shot up the terminal head ’conical as a cylinder.’  It\nhas now become an irregular and slightly convex plain a mile in\ndiameter, whose centre is the terminal chimney. Its main peculiarity is\nin the fumaroles, or escapes of steam, and mofetti, mephitic\nemanations of limpid water and sulphur-vapour. Of these we counted five\nnarices within as many hundred yards. Their temperature greatly varies,\n109° and 158° Fahr. being, perhaps, the extremes; my thermometer showed\n130°. These soupiraux or respiradouros are easily explained.\nThe percolations from above are heated to steam by stones\nrich in ’grough brimstone.’ Here it was that Humboldt saw apparent\nlateral shiftings and perpendicular oscillations of fixed stars; and our\nAdmiralty, not wishing to be behind him, directed Professor P. Smyth’s\nattention to ’scintillations in general.’ Only the youngest of\ntravellers would use such a place as an observatory; and only the\nyoungest of observers would have considered this libration of the\nstars an extraordinary phenomenon.",
        "Directed by a regular line of steam-puffs, we attacked El Pilon,\nthe third story, the most modern cone of eruption, the dwarf chimney\nwhich looks like a thimble from the sea. The lower third was of loose\ncrumbling pumice, more finely comminuted than we had yet seen; this is\nwhat Humboldt calls ’ash-cones.’ There was also a strew of porphyritic\nlava-chips covered with a red (ochreous?)  crust. Presently we reached a\nradiating rib of lately ejected lava, possibly the ridge of a dyke,\nbrown below and gradually whitening with sulphuric acid as it rose\ntowards the crater-walls. The resting took longer than the walking up\nthe steep talus; and at 7.45: after a total of nine hours and a\nmorning’s work of two hours and a half, which occupied two in\ndescending, we stood upon the corona or lip of ’Teyde.’",
        "The height of the Tenerife Pike, once held the loftiest in the world, is\n12,198 feet, in round numbers 12,200. Thus it stands nearly at the\naltitude of Mont Blanc (15,784 feet) above the Chamounix valley, a\nfigure of 12,284 feet. The slope from the base is 1 in 4.6. The direct\ndistance from Orotava on the map measures 10.5 miles; along the road 18,\naccording to the guides. The terminal chimney and outlet for vapours\nwhich would erupt elsewhere, rises 520 feet from its pedestal, the\ncentral Rambleta, and its ascent generally occupies an hour. One visitor\nhas reduced this montagne pelée to 60-70 feet, and compares it\nwith the dome of a glass-house. From below it resembles nothing so much\nas a cone of dirty brown cassonade, and travellers are justified\nin calling it a sugarloaf. I can hardly rest satisfied with Von Buch’s\ndescription. ’Teyde is a pointed tower surrounded by a ditch and a\ncircular chain of bastions.’",
        "The word Teyde is supposed to be a corruption of Echeyde, meaning Hades:\nhence the title Isla Infierno, found in a map of A.D. 1367. The Guanches\nalso called it Ayadyrma, and here placed their pandemonium, under\nGuayota, the head-fiend. The country-folk still term the crater-ring ’la\ncaldera de los diablos en que se cuecen todas las provisiones del\nInfierno’ (the Devil’s caldron, wherein are cooked all the rations of\nthe infernals). Seen by moonlight, or on a star-lit night, the scenery\nwould be weird and ghostly enough to suggest such fancies, which remind\nus of Etna and Lipari.",
        "I had been prepared by descriptions for a huge chasm-like crater or\ncraters like those on Theon Ochéma, Camerones Peak. I found a\nspoon-shaped hollow, with a gradual slope to the centre, 100 × 150 feet\ndeep, the greater length of the oval running north-east, where the side\nis higher, to south-west, where there is also a tilt of the cup. The\nfloor was a surface of burning marl and whitish earthy dough-like paste,\nthe effect of sulphurous acid vapours upon the argile of the lava. This\nstratum was in places more than 80 feet thick; and fumes rose fetid with\nsulphuric acid, and sulphates of soda, alumina, and ammonia from the\ndead white, purple red, vivid green, and brilliant yellow surface of the\nsolfatara. Hence the puffs of vapour seen from below against the\nsparkling blue sky, and disappearing like huge birds upon the wings of\nthe wind: hence, too, the tradition of the mast and the lateen sail. A\ndig with the Guanche magada or lanza, the island alpen-stock,\neither outside or inside the crater, will turn up, under the\nmoist white clay, lovely trimetric crystals of sulphur, with the\npalest straw tint, deepening to orange, and beautifully disposed in\nacicular shapes. The acid eats paper, and the colours fade before they\nleave the cone.",
        "[Footnote: Dr. Wilde (1837) analysed the sulphur as follows: Silica,\n81·13; water, 8·87; and a trace of lime. Others have obtained from the\nmineral, when condensed upon a cold surface, minute crystals of\nalum. Mr. Addison found in the ’splendid crystals of octahedral sulphur’\na glistening white substance of crystalline structure, yet somewhat like\nopal. When analysed it proved to contain 91 per cent. silex and the rest\nwater.]",
        "When sitting down it is advisable to choose a block upon which dew-drops\npearl. A few minutes of rest upon a certain block of marl, whose genial\nwarmth is most grateful, squatting in the sharp cold air, neatly removes\nall cloth in contact with the surface. More than one excursionist has\nshown himself in that Humphrey Clinker condition which excited the wrath\nof Count Tabitha. It is evident that Teyde is by no means exhausted, and\npossibly it may return to the state of persistent eruption described by\nthe eye-witness Ca da Mosto, who landed on the Canaries in A.D. 1505.",
        "Not at all impressed with the grandeur of the Inferno, we walked round\nthe narrow rim of the crater-cirque, and were shown a small breach in\nthe wall of porphyritic lava facing west. Mrs. Murray’s authorities\ndescribe the Caldera as being ’without any opening:’ if this be\nthe case the gap has lately formed. The cold had driven away the lively\nlittle colony of bees, birds, and butterflies which have been seen\ndisporting themselves about the bright white cauldron. There was not a\nbreath of the threatened wind. Manoel pointed out Mount Bermeja as the\nsource of the lateral lava-stream whose ’infernal avalanche,’ on May 5,\n1706, [Footnote: Preceding Ca da Mosto’s day another eruption (1492) was\nnoted by Columbus, shortly before his discovery of the Antilles.\nGarachico was the only port in Tenerife, with a breakwater of\nrocky isle and water so deep that the yardarms of men-of-war could\nalmost touch the vineyards. Its quays were bordered by large\nprovision-stores, it had five convents, and its slopes were dotted with\nvillas. After an earthquake during the night a lava-stream from several\ncones destroyed the village Del Tanque at 3:30 A.M., and at 9\nP.M. another flood entered Garachico at seven points, drove off the sea,\nruined the mole, and filled the port. It was followed by a cascade of\nfire at 8 A.M. on the 13th of the same month, and the lava remained\nincandescent for forty days.] overwhelmed ’Grarachico, pueblo rico,’",

Despite\nthe white and woolly mists, the panorama of elevations, craters and\ncastellated eminences, separated by deep gashes and by currals\nlike those of Madeira, but verdure-bare, was stupendous. I have\npreserved, however, little beyond names and heights. We did not suffer\nfrom puna, or mountain sickness, which Bishop Sprat, of\nRochester, mentions in 1650, and which Mr. Darwin–alas that we must\nwrite the late!–cured by botanising. I believe that it mostly results\nfrom disordered liver, and, not unfrequently, in young Alpinists, from\nindigestion.",
        "The descent of the Teyde Piton, in Vesuvian fashion, occupied ten\nminutes. Our guides now whistled to their comrades below, who had\nremained in charge of the animals. Old authors tell us that the Guanche\nwhistle could be heard for two leagues, and an English traveller\ndeclares that after an experiment close to his ear he did not quite\nrecover its use for a fortnight. The return home was wholly without\ninterest, except the prospects of cloud-land, grander than those of\nFolkestone, which seemed to open another world beneath our feet. Near\nthe Santa Clara village all turned out to prospect two faces which must\nhave suggested only raw beef-steaks. It was Sunday, and",

But even this unpicturesque coiffure, almost worthy of Sierra\nLeone, failed to conceal the nobility of face and figure, the\nwell-turned limbs, the fine hands and feet, and the meneo, or\nswimming walk, of this Guanchinesque race, which everywhere forced\nitself upon the sight.

        "It is curious to compare the realistic accounts of the nineteenth\ncentury with those of the vulcanio two centuries ago. Ogilby\n(1670) tells us that the Moors called it El-Bard (Cold), and we the\n’Pike of Teneriff, thought not to have its equal in the world for\nheight, because it spires with its top so high into the clouds that in\nclear weather it may be seen sixty Dutch miles off at sea.’ His\nillustration of the ’Piek-Bergh op het Eilant Teneriffe’ shows an almost\nperpendicular tower of natural masonry rising from a low sow-back whose\nend is the ’Punt Tenago’ (Anaga Point). The ’considerable merchants and\npersons of credit,’ whose ascent furnished material for the Royal\nSociety, set out from Orotava. ’In the ascent of one mile some of our\nCompany grew very faint and sick, disorder’d by Fluxes, Vomitings, and\nAguish Distempers; our Horses’ Hair standing upright like Bristles.’\nHigher up ’their Strong waters had lost their Virtue, and were almost\ninsipid, while their Wine was more spirituous and brisk than before.’ In\nthose days also iron and copper, silver and gold, were found in the\ncalcined rocks of the Katakaumenon. It is strange to note how much more\nwas seen by ancient travellers than by us moderns.",
        "THE SPANISH ACCOUNT OF THE REPULSE OF NELSON FROM SANTA CRUZ DE TENERIFE.",
        "[Footnote: From the Relacion circumstanciada de la Defensa que hizo\nla Plaza de Santa Cruz, by M. Monteverde. Published in Madrid, 1798.]",
        "The following pages afford a circumstantial and, I believe, a fairly\ntrue account of an incident much glossed over by our naval\nhistorians. The subject is peculiarly interesting. At Santa Cruz, as at\nFontenoy, the Irish, whom harsh measures at home drove for protection to\nmore friendly lands, took ample share in the fighting which defeated\nEngland’s greatest sailor. Again, the short-sighted policy which sent to\nthe Crimea 20,000 British soldiers to play second instrument in concert\nwith 40,000 Frenchmen, thus lowering us in the eyes of Europe, made\nNelson oppose his 960 hands to more than eight times their number. The\nday may come when the attack shall be repeated. Now that steam has\nrendered fleets independent of south-west winds, it is to be hoped the\nassailant will prefer day to night, so that his divisions can\ncommunicate; that he will not land in the ’raging surf’ of the ebb-tide,\nand that he will attack the almost defenceless south instead of the\nwell-fortified north of the city.",
        "Already the heroic Island had inflicted partial or total defeat upon\nthree English admirals. [Footnote: Grand Canary also did her duty by\nbeating off, in October 1795, Drake’s strong squadron.] In April 1657\nthe Roundhead ’general at sea,’ Admiral Sir Robert Blake, of\nBridgewater, attempted to cut out the Spanish galleons freighted with\nMexican gold and with the silver of Peru. Of these the principal were\nthe Santo-Cristo, the Jesus-Maria, the Santo Sacramento,\nLa Concepcion, the San Juan, the Virgen de la Solitud,\nand the Nuestra Señora del Buen Socorro. This ’silver fleet’\nwas moored under the guns of the ’chief castle,’ San Cristobal,\nthe mean work at the root of the mole. The English were\npreparing to board, when the Captain-General, D. Diego de Egues, whom\nour histories call ’Diagues,’ ordered the fleet to be fired, after all\nthe treasure had been housed in the fort. A steady fight lasted three\nhours, during which the wife of the brave Governor, D. Estevan de la\nGuerra, distinguished herself. ’I shall not be useless here,’ she\nexclaimed when invited to leave the batteries; and this ’maid of\nTenerife’ continued to animate the garrison till the end. As was the\ncase with his great successor, Roundhead Blake’s failure proved to him\nfar better than a success. For his francesada, or coup de\ntête, Nelson expected to lose his commission, instead of which some\npopular freak flung to him honour and honours. So Protector Cromwell\nsent a valuable diamond ring to his ’general at sea,’ in token of esteem\non his part and that of his Parliament. Our histories, relying on the\nfact that a few weak batteries were silenced, claim for the Admiral a\npositive victory, despite his losses–fifty killed and 500 wounded.",
        "[Footnote: The late Mr. Hepworth Dixon (Life of Blake, p. 346)\ndescribes the open roadstead of Santa Cruz as a ’harbour shaped like a\nhorse-shoe, and defended at the north side of the entrance by a regular\ncastle.’ In p. 350 we also read of the bay and its entrance.

The envoy\ninformed the Governor, who is described by Dampier as sitting in a low,\ndark, uncarpeted room, adorned only with muskets and pikes, that Philip\nV. had lost Gibraltar, that Cadiz and Minorca had nearly fallen, and\nthat the American galleons in the port of Vigo had been burnt or\ncaptured by the English, whose army, entering Castile, had overrun\nAragon, Catalonia, and Valencia.

This\nparty occupied the nearest hill before it could be attacked; its\nmovements showed an intention to seize the steep rocky scarp commanding\nthe Paso Alto–the furthest to the north of the town.

The Marquess, who unfortunately received a fall\nwhich kept him hors de combat for many days, [Footnote: I find\npencilled in the original volume, ’Que caida tam oportuna!’ (What a\nlucky fall!)] obeyed with his command at 5 P.M., leaving behind him\nthirty men under Don Felix Uriundo, second lieutenant of the Battalion\nof Canaries. Don Juan Creagh did the same with his men. But as the\nFrench commandant reported that some of the enemy were still lurking\nabout the place, our General-in-Chief directed Captain Don Santiago\nMadan, second adjutant of the same corps, to reconnoitre once more the\nValle Seco with 120 Rozadores. This duty was well performed, despite the\nroughness of the paths and the excessive heat of the sun.",
        "’The enemy’s squadron now seemed inclined to desist from its attempt. At\n6 A.M. of July 23 Rear-Admiral Nelson’s flagship, which, with the other\nships of the line, had kept in the offing, drew near, and signalled the\nfrigates to sheer off from the point and to rejoin the rest of the\nsquadron. These, however, at 3 P.M., allowed themselves to drop down the\ncoast towards the dangerous southern reaches between Barranco Hondo,\nbeyond the Quarantine-house and the village of Candelaria, distant a\nday’s march from Santa Cruz. To prevent their landing men, Captain Don\nAntonio Eduardo, and the special engineer, Don Manuel Madera,\nreconnoitred the shore about Puerto Caballas, to see if artillery could\nbe brought there. Meanwhile Sub-Lieutenant Don Cristobal Trinidad, of\nthe Guimar Regiment, watched, with fifty of his men, the coast near San\nIsidro, [Footnote: Here the landing is easiest.] which is not far from\nBarranco Hondo. The squadron, however, retired to such a distance that\nit could hardly be discerned from the town, as it bore S.E. 1/4 E.:\nnotwithstanding which, all preparations were made to give the enemy a\nwarm reception.",
        "’At daylight on July 24 the squadron again appeared, crowding on all\nsail to gain the weather-side. The look-out at Anaga Point, north of the\nisland, signalled three ships from that direction, and two to the south,\nwhere we could distinguish only one of fifteen guns, which was presently\njoined by the rest. At 6 P.M. the enemy anchored with his whole force on\nthe same ground which the frigates chose on the 22nd, and feinted to\nattack Paso Alto Fort. Our General and chiefs were not deceived.\nForeseeing that we should be assaulted in front, and to the\nright or south, [Footnote: The town of Santa Cruz runs due north and\nsouth in a right line; the bay affords no shelter to shipping, and the\nbeach is rocky.] they made their dispositions accordingly, without,\nhowever, neglecting to protect the left.",
        "’At 6 P.M. a frigate and the bomb-ketch approached Paso Alto, and the\nlatter opened fire upon the fort and the heights behind it. These\npositions were occupied by 56 men of the Battalion of the Canaries, 40\nRozadores, under Second Lieutenant Don Felix Uriundo, and 16\nartillerymen, commanded by Sub-Lieutenant of Militia Artillery Don Josef\nCambreleng. [Footnote: A Flemish name, I believe: the family is still in\nthe island.] Of 43 shells, however, only one fell in the fort, bursting\nin a place where straw for soldiers’ beds had been stored, and this,\nlike the others, did no damage. [Footnote: A fragment of this shell is\npreserved in the Fort Chapel for the edification of strangers.] Paso\nAlto, commanded by the Captain of the Royal Corps of Artillery, Don\nVicente Rosique, replied firmly. At the same time Don Juan del Castillo,\nsub-lieutenant of militia, with 16 men, reconnoitred, by H. E. the\nGovernor’s orders, the Valle Seco. The operation was boldly performed,\ndespite the darkness of night and other dangers; and our soldiers\nreturned with a prisoner, an Irish sailor of the Fox cutter, who\nhad swum off from his ship.",
        "’The enemy now prepared his force for the attack. One thousand five\nhundred men, [Footnote: James numbers 200 seamen and marines from each\nof the three line-of-battle ships, and 100 from each of the three\nfrigates, besides officers, servants, and a small detachment of Royal\nArtillery. This made a total of 1,000 to 1,060 men, commanded by\nCaptain, afterwards Admiral, Sir Thomas Troubridge, Bart. Nelson\n(Despatches, vol. ii. p. 43) says 600 to 700 men in the squadron\nboats, 180 on board the Fox, and about 70 or 80 in a captured\nboat; total, at most, 960.] as we were afterwards informed, well armed\nwith guns, pistols, pikes, swords, saws, and hatchets, and led by their\nbest officers, among whom was the Rear-Admiral, embarked in their\nboats. At 2.15 A.M. (July 25) they put off in the deepest silence. The\nfrigate of the Philippine Islands Company, anchored outside the shipping\nin the bay, discovered them when close alongside. Almost at the same\nmoment the Paso Alto Fort, under Lieutenant-Colonel Don Pedro de\nHigueras, and the Captain of Artillery Don Vicente Rosique, gave the\nsignal to the (saluting) battery of San Antonio [Footnote: This old\nwork, à fleur d’eau, still remains; and near it are the ruins of\nthe Bateria de los Melones, on land bought by the Davidson family.] in\nthe town, held by the Captain of Militia Artillery Don Patricio\nMadan. They alarmed the citizens by their fire, and the enemy attacked\nwith rare intrepidity.",
        "’The defence was gallantly kept up by the battery of San Miguel, under\nSub-Lieutenant of Artillery Don Josef Marrero; by the Castle of San\nPedro, [Footnote: The San Pedro battery dated from 1797. It defended the\nsouthern town with six embrasures and three guns en barbette. For\nmany years huge mortars and old guns lay outside this work.] under the\nCaptain of Artillery Don Francisco Tolosa; by the Provisional Battery de\nlos Melones, [Footnote: Now destroyed. It was, I have said, near the new\ncasemates north of the town.] under the Sergeant of Militia Juan\nEvangelista; by the Mole-battery, under Lieutenant of the Royal Corps of\nArtillery Don Joaquim Ruiz and Sub-Lieutenant of Militia Don Francisco\nDugi; by the Castle of San Cristobal, under the Captain of the Royal\nRegiment of Artillery and Brigade-Major Don Antonio Eduardo, who\ncommanded the central and right batteries, and Lieutenant of Militia\nArtillery Don Francisco Grandi, to whom were entrusted the defences on\nour left; by the battery of La Concepcion, [Footnote: Where the Custom\nHouse now is, in the middle of the town.] under Captain of the Royal\nRegiment of Artillery Don Clemente Falcon; and by that of San Telmo,\n[Footnote: Near the dirty little square south of the Custom House.

        "’The rest of our line did not fire, because the enemy’s boats had not\npassed the Barranco, or stony watercourse, which divides the southern\nfrom the northern town. In the Castle of San Juan,",

        "however, Captain Don Diego Fernandez Calderia trained four guns to bear\nupon the beach, which was protected by the Laguna militia regiment,\nunder Lieutenant-Colonel Juan de Castro.",
        "’So hot and well-directed was our fire, that almost all the boats were\ndriven back, and the Fox cutter, with her commander and 382 of\nthe landing party–others said 450–also carrying a reserve store of\narms and ammunition, was sunk. [Footnote: Nelson, loc. cit., says\n180 men were in the Fox, and of these 97 were lost. So Captain\nBrenton, Naval History, says 97. In vol. ii. p. 84, speaking of\nTrafalgar, he informs us that the French ship Indomptable (84),\nM. Hubart, was wrecked off Rota, where her crew, said to be 1,500 men,\nall perished. Add, ’except M. Maffiote, of Tenerife, and about\n143 others.’] Rear-Admiral Nelson lost his right arm before he could\ntouch ground, and was compelled to return to his flag-ship, with the\nother officers of his boat all badly wounded. [Footnote: The grape-shot\nwas fired from the Castle of San Pedro; others opine from San Cristobal;\nand the Canarese say that a splinter of stone did the work. According to\nmost authorities, Nelson was half-way up the mole. James declares that\nNelson’s elbow was struck by a shot as he was drawing his sword and\nstepping out of his boat. In Nelson’s Despatches, loc. cit., we\nread that the ’mole was instantly stormed and carried, although defended\nby 400 or 500 men, and the guns–six 24-pounders–were spiked; but such\na heavy fire of musketry and grape-shot was kept up from the citadel and\nhouses at the head of the mole that we could not advance, and nearly all\nwere killed.’] The brave Captain Bowen was killed on the first step of\nthe Mole, a volley of grape tearing away his stomach. [Footnote: This\nofficer is said to have caused the expedition, by describing it to\nAdmiral Jervis and the British Government as an easy exploit. He had\npreviously cut out of this bay a Philippine Island frigate, El\nPrincipe Fernando; and he had with him, as guide, a Chinese\nprisoner, taken in that vessel. The guide was also killed. Captain\nBowen’s family made some exertions to recover certain small articles\nwhich he carried about him–watch, pistols, &c.–and failed. One pistol\nwas lost, and for the other its possessor modestly demanded 14l.]\nNineteen other Englishmen were struck down by a discharge of grape. The\ngun which fired it had, on that same night, been placed by the governor\nof the Castle of San Cristobal, Don Josef Monteverde, [Footnote: There\nis a note in my volume, ’Father of the adopted son, Miguelito Morales.’]\nat a new embrasure which he caused to be opened in the flank of the\nbastion. [Footnote: This part of the castle has now been altered, and\nmounted with brass 80-pounders.]  Thus it commanded the landing-place,\nwhere before there was dead ground. The enemy afterwards confessed that\nthe injury thus done was the first cause of his misfortunes.",
        "’Notwithstanding the Rear-Admiral’s wound and the enemy’s loss in men\nand chief officers, a single boat, carrying Captain and Commodore\nTroubridge, covered by the smoke and the darkness, landed at the Caleta\n[Footnote: ’Caleta’ means literally a cul de sac. At Santa Cruz\nit is applied to a rocky tract near the Custom-house Battery: in those\ndays it was the place where goods were disembarked.]  beach. At the same\ntime the main body of the English, who had escaped the grape of the\nCastle of San Cristobal and the batteries La Concepcion and San Telmo,\ndisembarked a little further south, at the Barranquillo del Aceyte,\n[Footnote: This ditch is now built over and converted into a drain. It\nruns a little above the present omnibus stables.] at the Butcheries, and\nat the Barranco Santo. [Footnote: Also called de la Cassona–’of the\nDog-fish’–that animal being often caught in a charco, or pool,\nin the broad watercourse. So those baptised in the parish church are\npopularly said to have been ’dipped in the waters of the Dog-fish\nPool.’] The levies of Havana and Cuba, posted in the Butcheries under\nSecond Lieutenant Don Pedro de Castilla, being unable to repulse the\nenemy’s superior force, retreated upon the Battalion of Infantry of the\nCanaries, consisting of 260 men and officers, including the\nmilitia. This corps, supported by two field-guns, [Footnote: In the\noriginal ’canones violentos,’ i.e. 4-pounders, 6-pounders, or\n8-pounders.] ably and energetically worked by the pilots, Nicolas Franco\nand Josef Garcia, did such damage that the English were in turn\ncompelled to fall back upon the beaches of the Barranco and the\nButcheries.",
        "’These were the only places where the enemy was able to gain a footing\nin the town. He marched in two columns, one, with drums beating, by the\nlittle square of the parish church (La Concepcion) to the convent of\nSanto Domingo, [Footnote: Afterwards pulled down to make room for a\ntheatre and a market-place.] and the other to the Plaza [Footnote: Plaza\nhere means the square behind the castle. In other places it applies to\nthe fortified part of the town.] of the San Cristobal castle. His plan\nof attack was to occupy the latter post, but he was driven back from the\nportcullis after losing one officer by the hot fire of the\nmilitia-Captain Don Esteban Benitez de Lugo. Thus driven back to the\nCaleta, the invaders marched along the street called “de las Tiendas.\"\n[Footnote: It is now the ’Cruz Verde.’ In those days it was the\nprincipal street; the Galle del Castello (holding at present that rank)\nthen showed only scattered houses.] They then drew up at the head of the\nsquare, maintaining a silence which was not broken by nine guns\ndischarged at them by the Captain of Laguna Chasseurs Don Fernando del\nHoyo, nor by the aspect of the two field-pieces ranged in front of them\nby the Mayor, who was present at all the most important points in the\ncentre of the line. The cause was discovered in an order afterwards\nfound in the pocket of Lieut. Robinson, R.M. It ran to this\neffect:–[Footnote: This and other official documents are translated\ninto English from the Spanish. According to our naval despatches and\nhistories the senior marine officer who commanded the whole detachment\nwas Captain Thomas Oldfleld, R.M.

        "’Standing at the head of the square, the enemy could observe that not\nfar from them was a provision-store, guarded by Don Juan Casalon and Don\nAntonio Power, [Footnote: The original has it ’Pouver,’ a misprint. The\nIrish-Spanish family of Power is well known in the Canaries.] the two\n\"deputies of Abastos.” [Footnote: Now called regidores–officers\nwho are charged with distributing rations.]  The English seized it,\nwounding Dons Patricio Power and Casalon, who, after receiving two blows\nwith an axe, escaped. They then obliged, under parole, the deputy Power\nand Don Luis Fonspertius to conduct into the Castle a sergeant sent to\nparly. Our Commandant-General, when summoned to surrender the town\nwithin two minutes, under pain of its being burned, returned an answer\nworthy of his honour and gallantry. “Such a proposal,” he remarked,\n\"requires no reply,” and in proof thereof he ordered the party to be\ndetained. [Footnote: According to James, who follows Troubridge’s\nreport, the sergeant was shot in the streets and no answer was\nreceived.]",
        "’Meanwhile our militiamen harassed the first column of the enemy,\ncompelling it, by street-fighting, to form up in the little squares of\nSanto Domingo and of the parish church. Our Commandant-General was\nstartled when he found that this position cut off direct communication\nbetween San Cristobal and the Battalion of the Canaries, whose fire,\nlike that of the militiamen on the right, suddenly ceased. But he was\nassured that the battalion was unbroken, and all the central posts\nexcept the Mole were supported, by the report of Lieutenant Don Vicente\nSiera: this officer had just attacked with 30 men of that battalion the\nenemy’s boats as they lay grounded at the mouth of the Barranco Santo,\ndislodging the defenders, who had taken shelter behind them, and making\nfive prisoners. The English were stopped at the narrow way near the base\nof the pier by the hot fire of the troops under Captain and Adjutant of\nChasseurs Don Luis Roman, the nine militiamen under Don Francisco Jorva,\nthe sergeant of the guard Domingo Mendez, and a recruit of the Havana\nlevy; these made forty-four prisoners, including six officers, whilst\ntwelve were wounded. Our Commandant-General was presently put out of all\ndoubt by Don Josef Monteverde. This governor of San Cristobal, when\ninformed that 2,000 Englishmen had entered the town, intending probably\nto attack the Castle with the scaling-ladders brought from their boats,\nresolved himself to inspect the whole esplanade, and accordingly\nreconnoitred the front and flank of the Citadel.",
        "’All our advantages were well-nigh lost by a report which spread through\nthe garrison when our firing ceased. A cry arose that our chief was\nkilled, and that as the English who had taken the town were marching\nupon La Laguna, they must be intercepted at the cuesta, or hill,\nbehind Santa Cruz. It is easy to conceive what a panic such rumours\nwould cause among badly armed and half-drilled militia. The report arose\nthus:–Our Commandant-General seeing the defenders of the battery at the\nfoot of the Mole retreating, and hearing them cry, “Que nos cortan!” (We\nare cut off!), sallied out with Don Juan Creagh and other officers, the\nPort Captain, the Town Adjutant, and the chief collector of the\ntobacco-tax. After ordering the corps of Chasseurs, 89 men and 9\nofficers, to fire, our chief returned, leaning upon the arm of Don Juan\nCreagh, and some inconsiderate person thought that he was\nwounded. Fortunately this indiscretion went no further than the Chasseur\nBattalion of the Canaries and the militiamen on our right.",
        "’When this battalion was not wanted in its former position it was\nordered to the square behind the Citadel. The movement was effected\nabout daybreak by Don Manuel Salcedo, Lieutenant of the King.\n[Footnote: An old title (now changed) given to the military governor of\nSanta Cruz and the second highest authority in the archipelago. Marshal\nO’Donnell was Teniente del Rey at Tenerife, and he was born in a house\nfacing the cross in the main square of Santa Cruz.] That officer had\nnever left his corps, patrolling with it along the beaches where the\nenemy disembarked, and he had sent to the barracks twenty-six prisoners,\nbesides three whom he captured at San Cristobal. When the battalion was\nformed up and no enemy appeared, the Adjutant-Major enquired about them\nin a loud voice. Meanwhile the Laguna militia, who in two divisions,\neach of 120 men, under Lieut.-Col. Don Juan Baptista de Castro, had been\nposted from San Telmo to the Grariton, [Footnote: Meaning a large\ngarita, or sentry-box. It is a place near the windmills to the\nsouth of the town.] were also ordered to the main square. In two\nseparate parties they marched, one in direct line, the other by upper\nstreets, to cut off the enemy’s retreat and place him between two\nfires. As the latter, however, entered the little square of Santo\nDomingo, their commander, Lieut.-Col. de Castro, hearing a confusion of\ntongues, mistook for Spaniards and Frenchmen the English who were\nholding it. Thereupon the enemy fired a volley, which killed him and a\nmilitiaman and wounded many, whilst several were taken prisoners.",
        "’The attackers presently manned the windows of Santo Domingo, and kept\nup a hot fire against our militiamen. They then determined to send an\nofficer of marines to our Commandant-General, once more demanding the\nsurrender of the town under the threat of burning it. At the order of\nLieut.-Col. Don Juan Guinther the parliamentary was conducted to the\nCitadel by Captain Don Santiago Madan. Our chief replied only that the\ncity had still powder, ball, and fighting men.",
        "’Thereupon the affair recommenced. One battalion came up with two\nfield-guns to support its friends, and several militiamen died\nhonourably, exposing themselves to the fire of an entrenched enemy. Our\nposition was further reinforced by the militia-pickets that had been\nskirmishing in the streets, and by the greater part of those who,\ndeceived by a false report, had retired to the slopes of La Laguna.",
        "’Already it was morning, when a squadron of five armed boats was seen\nmaking for our right. Our brave artillerymen had not the patience to let\nthem approach, but at once directed at them a hot fire, especially from\nthe Mole battery, under Don Francisco Grandi. That officer, accompanied\nby the second constable, Manuel Troncos, had just passed from the\nCitadel [Footnote: La Ciudadela, to the north of the mole, is not built,\nas we read in Colburn (U. S.

[Footnote: The English\ndiary shows that the Spaniards had spiked the guns.] The principal\nCastle and the Mole batteries, supported by that of La Concepcion,\nrained a shower of grape at a long range with such precision that three\nboats were sunk and the two others fell back upon the squadron. At the\nsame time the Port Captain and Flag Officer of the frigate ordered his\nmen to knock out the bottoms of eighteen boats which the enemy after his\nattack had left on the beach.",
        "’The English posted in the convent, seeing the destruction of their\nreinforcements, lost heart and persuaded the prior, Fray Carlos de Lugo,\nand the master, Fray Juan de Iriarte, to bear another message to our\nchief.

        "’This deputation received the same laconic reply as those preceding\nit. Seeing the firmness of our Commandant-General and the crowds of\npeasantry gathering from all parts, the enemy’s courage was damped, and\nhis second in command, Captain Samuel Hood, came out to parley. This\nofficer, perceiving that the Militiamen who had joined the Chasseurs\nwere preparing to attack, signalled with a white flag a cessation of\nhostilities, and our men were restrained by the orders of Don Fernando\ndel Hoyo. Both parties advanced to the middle of the bridge, where they\nwere met by Lieutenant-Colonel Don Juan Guinther, commanding the\nBattalion of the Canaries, who could speak many languages, and by the\nAdjutant-Major, Don Juan Battaler. These officers also withheld their\nmen, who were opening fire as they turned the corner of the street in\nwhich, a little before, Don Rafael Fernandez, a sub-lieutenant of the\nsame corps, had fallen, shot through the body, whilst heading an attack\nupon the enemy.",

When we know that on our side hardly 500 men\narmed with firelocks entered into action, and that the 97 cannon used on\nthis occasion, and requiring 532 artillery-men, were served by only 320\ngunners, of whom but 43 were veterans and the rest militia; [Footnote:\nAccording to James, who follows the report of Captain Troubridge\n(vol. ii. p. 427), there were 8,000 Spaniards and 100 Frenchmen under\narms. Unfortunate Clio!] when we remember that we took from the enemy a\nfield-gun, a flag, [Footnote: This was the ensign of the Fox\ncutter, sunk at the place where the African steamships now anchor.] two\ndrums, a number of guns, pikes, swords, pistols, hand-ladders,\nammunition, &c. &c., with a loss on our part of only 23 killed\n[Footnote: Two officers–viz. Don Juan Bautista de Castro, before\nalluded to; Don Rafael Fernandez, also mentioned–and 21 noncommissioned\nofficers, 5 soldiers of the Canarian battalion, 2 chasseurs, 4\nmilitiamen, 1 militia artilleryman, 4 French auxiliaries, and 5\ncivilians.] and 28 wounded, [Footnote: Namely, 3 officers–Don Simon de\nLara, severely wounded at the narrow part of the Mole, Don Dionisio\nNavarro, sub-lieutenant of the Provincial Regiment of La Laguna, and Don\nJosef Dugi, cadet of the Canarian battalion–25 noncommissioned\nofficers, 5 men of the same battalion, 1 chasseur, 1 sergeant, 11\nmilitiamen, 1 soldier of the Havana depôt, 1 ditto of Cuban ditto, 1\nmilitia artilleryman, and 5 French auxiliaries. This, however, does not\ninclude those suffering from contusions, amongst whom was Don Juan\nRosel, sub-lieutenant of the Provincial Regiment of Orotava.] whereas\nthe enemy lost 22 officers and 576 men [Footnote: Nelson\n(Despatches, vol. ii. p. 424) says 28 seamen, 16 marines killed\n(total 44); 90 seamen, 15 marines wounded; 97 seamen and marines\ndrowned; 5 seamen and marines missing. Total killed, 141; wounded, 105;\nand grand total, 246 hors de combat. The total of 251 casualties\nnearly equals that of the great victory at Cape St. Vincent.]–when, I\nsay, we take into consideration all these circumstances, we cannot but\nconsider our defence wonderful and our triumph most glorious.",
        "’We must not forget the gallant part taken in this affair by the two\ndivisions of the Rozadores irregulars, who were provided with sickles,\nknives, and other weapons by the armoury of La Laguna. One division of\nforty peasants was placed under the Marquess del Prado and the Viscount\nde Buenpaso, who both, though not military men, hastened to the town\nwhen the attack was no longer doubtful. The other body of thirty-five\nmen was committed to Don Simon de Lara, already mentioned amongst the\nwounded. In the heat of the affair and the darkness of night the first\ndivision was somewhat scattered as it entered the streets leading to the\nBarranco Santo (watercourse), where the Canarian battalion was attacking\nthe English as they landed. The Marquess, after escaping the enemy, who\nfor half an hour surrounded without recognising him, and expecting\ninstant death, attempted to cross the small square of Santo Domingo to\nthe Plaza of the Citadel. He was prevented from so doing by the voices\nof the attacking party posted in the little place. He therefore retired\nto the upper part of the town, and took post on the Convent-flank. The\nViscount marched his men to the square of the Citadel, where they were\ndetained by Lieutenant Jorva to reinforce the post and to withdraw a\nfield-gun that had been dangerously placed in the street of San Josef.",
        "’Equally well deserving of their country’s gratitude were sundry others,\nespecially Diego Correa, first chief of the Provincial Regiment of\nGuimar, who, forgetting his illness, sprang from his bed at the\ntrumpet’s sound, boldly met the foe with sword and pistol, and took\neleven prisoners to the Citadel. Don Josef de Guesala, not satisfied\nwith doing the mounted duties required of him, followed the enemy with\nnot less courage than Diego Correa, at the head of certain militiamen\nwho had lost their way in the streets.",
        "’Good service was also done by the Alcalde and the deputies [Footnote:\nThe local aldermen.] of the district. In charge of the four parties,\ncomposed of tradesmen and burghers, they patrolled the streets and\nguarded against danger from fire. They also issued to all those on duty\nrations of bread and wine punctually and abundantly from the night of\nthe 22nd till that of the 25th of July.",
        "’No circumstantial account of our remarkable success would be complete\nwithout recording, in the highest and the most grateful terms, the zeal\nwith which the very noble the Municipality (ayuntamiento) of\nTenerife took part in winning our laurels. Since July 22, when the first\nalarm-signal was made at Santa Cruz, Don Josef de Castilla, the Chief\nMagistrate (Corregidor), with the nobility and men at arms\n(armas-tomar) assembled in force on the main square of La Laguna\n(Plaza del Adelantado). The Mayor (Alcalde Mayor), Don\nVicente Ortiz de Rivera, presided over the court (cabildo), at\nwhich were present all those members (regidores) who were not\npersonally serving against the enemy. These were the town deputies, Don\nLopo de la Guerra, Don Josef Saviñon, Don Antonio Riquel, Don Cayetano\nPereza, Don Francisco Fernandez Bello, Don Miguel de Laisequilla, and\nDon Juan Fernandez Calderin, with the Deputy Syndic-General, Don Filipe\nCarillo. Their meetings were also attended by other gentlemen and\nunder-officers (curiales), who were told off to their\nrespective duties according to the order laid down for defending the\nIsland. After making a careful survey of the bread and provisions in the\nmarket, also of the wheat and flour in the bakeries and of the reserve\nstores, they promptly supplied the country-people who crowded into the\ncity. Wind being at this season wanting for the mills, we were greatly\nassisted by a cargo of 3,000 barrels of flour taken before Madeira from\nan Anglo-American prize by the Buonaparte, a French privateer, who\nbrought her to our port. This supply sufficed for the militia stationed\non the heights of Taganana, in the Valle Seco, near the streams of the\nPunta del Hidalgo, Texina, Baxamar, the Valley of San Andrés, and lastly\nthe line of Santa Cruz, Guadamogete, and Candelaria, whose posts cover\nmore than twenty-four miles of coast between the north-west and the\nsouth of the island.",
        "’Equally well rationed were the peasants who passed by La Laguna en\nroute to Santa Cruz and other parts; they consumed about 16,000\nlbs. of bread, 300 lbs. of biscuit, seven and a half pipes of wine;\nrice, meat, cheese, and other comestibles. Meanwhile, at the application\nof the Municipality to the venerable Vicar Ecclesiastic, and to the\nparish priests and superiors of the community (prelados), prayers\nwere offered up in the churches, and certain of the clergy collected\nfrom the neighbouring houses lint and bandages for the wounded. The\nsoldiers in the Paso Alto and Valle Seco received 100 pairs of slippers,\nfor which our Commandant-General had indented. Many peasants who had\napplied for and obtained guns, knives, and other weapons from the Laguna\narmoury were sent off to defend the northern part of the island. On the\nmain road descending to Santa Cruz the Chief Magistrate planted a\nprovisional battery with two field-pieces belonging to the Court of\nAldermen. When thus engaged an unfortunate fall from his horse compelled\nhim to retire.",
        "’That patriotic body the Municipality of Santa Cruz sat permanently in\nthe Mansion House, engaged in the most important matters from the dawn\nof July 22 to noon on the 25th; nor was its firmness shaken even by the\nsinister reports to which others lent ear. When on the morning of the\nlatter day our chief communicated to them the glowing success of our\narms and the disastrous repulse of the enemy, they hastened to appoint\nJuly 27 for a solemn Te Deum. It is the day on which the island of\nTenerife was conquered exactly three centuries before, and thus it\nbecame the annual festival of San Cristobal, its patron.",
        "’The secular religious and the regular monastic communities performed\nthis function with pomp and singular apparatus in the parish church of\nOur Lady of the Conception. The Town-court carried the banner which had\nwaved in the days of the Conquest, escorted by a company of the Canarian\nbattalion and its band. These stood during the office at the church\ndoor, and saluted with three volleys the elevation of the host. Master\nFray Antonio Raymond, of the Order of St. Augustine, preached upon the\ngrateful theme to a sympathising congregation. The court, retiring with\nequal ceremony, gave a brilliant banquet to the officers of the\nbattalion, to the chiefs of the provincial regiments of La Laguna and\nGuimar, and to all their illustrious compatriots who had taken part in\nthe contest. Volleys and band performances saluted the three loyal and\npatriotic toasts–\"the King,” “the Commandant-General,” and “the\nDefenders of the Country.” The town, in sign of jubilee, was illuminated\nfor several successive nights.",
        "’A Te Deum was also sung in the parish church of Los Remedios at La\nLaguna, with sermon and high mass performed at the expense of Don Josef\nBartolomé de Mesa, Treasurer-General of the Royal Exchequer. Our\nharbour settlement obtained from the King the title of “very noble,\nloyal, and invict town, [Footnote: Villa, town, not city.] port\nand fort of Santa Cruz de Santiago.” [Footnote: Holy Cross of\nSt. James.] Recognising the evident protection of St. James, patron\nsaint of Spain, on whose festival the enemy had been defeated, a\nmagnificent procession was consecrated to him on July 30. His image was\nborne through the streets by the four captains of the several corps,\nwhilst six other officers, followed by a picket of garrison troops and a\ncrowd of townspeople, carried the colours taken from the English.",
        "’On the next day were celebrated the obsequies of those who had fallen\nhonourably in defence of their beloved country. The ceremony took place\nin the parish church of Santa Cruz, and was repeated in the cathedral of\nGrand Canary and in the churches and convents of the other islands. The\nEcclesiastical Court of Tenerife ordered the Chapter of Music to sing a\nsolemn Te Deum, at which the municipal body attended. On the next day a\nmass of thanksgiving was said, with exposition of the Holy Sacrament\nthroughout the day, and a sermon was preached by the canon superior, Don\nJosef Icaza Cabrexas. Lastly, a very solemn funeral function, with\nmagnificent display, did due honour to their memory who for their\ncountry’s good had laid down their lives.’ Mrs. Elizabeth Murray, wife\nof H.B.M.’s Consul for Tenerife and author of an amusing book,\n[Footnote: Sixteen Years of an Artist’s Life in Morocco,\n&c. Hurst and Blackett, 1859. I quote from vol. i. chap. iv.] adds\ncertain local details concerning Nelson’s ill-fated attack. It is boldly\nstated that during the rash affair the Commandant-General and his staff\nremained safely inside the Castle of San Cristobal, and that when the\nEnglish forces captured the monastery the Spanish authorities resolved\nto surrender. This step was opposed by a sergeant, Manoel Cuera, who,\n’with more familiarity than is usual when soldiers are separated so far\nby their respective ranks, placed his hand upon the shoulder of his\ncommanding officer and said, “No, your Excellency, you shall not give up\nthe Plaza; we are not yet reduced to such a strait as that.\"’  Whereupon\nthe General, ’assuming his usual courage, followed his sergeant’s\nadvice, and continued the engagement till it was brought to a\ntermination equally honourable to Englishmen and Spaniards.’",
        "Mrs. Murray also declares that Captain Troubridge, when invested in the\nmonastery by superior numbers, placed before his men a line of\nprisoners, and that these being persons of influence, the assailants\nfired high; moreover that Colonel M(onteverde?), the commander of the\nisland troops, was an Italian who spoke bad Spanish, and kept shouting\nto his men, ’Condanate vois a matar a la Santisima Trinitate!’ The\nofficer sent to parley (Captain Hood) was, we are told, accompanied to\nthe citadel by a gentleman named Murphy, whom the English had taken\nprisoner. A panic (before mentioned) came from three militia officers,\nwho, mounting a single animal, rode off to La Laguna, assuring the\ncabildo and the townspeople that Santa Cruz had fallen. One of\nthis ’valiant triumvirate’ had succeeded to a large property on\ncondition of never disgracing his name, and after the flight he had the\ngrace to offer it to a younger brother who had distinguished himself in\nSouth America. The junior told him not to be a fool, and the property\nwas left to the proprietor’s children, ’his grandson being in possession\nof it at the present day.’",
        "The chapter ends with the fate of one O’Rooney, a merchant’s clerk who\ncast his lot with the Spaniards, and whom General Gutierrez sent with an\norder to the commandant of Paso Alto Fort. Being in liquor, he took the\nMarina, or shortest road; and, when questioned by the enemy, at once\ntold his errand. ’In those days and in such circumstances,’ writes the\nlively lady, ’soldiers were very speedy in their decisions, and the\nmarine who had challenged O’Rooney at once bayonetted him, while his\ncomrade rifled his pockets and appropriated his clothes.’",
        "Remains only to state that the colours of the unfortunate cutter\nFox and her boats are still in the chapel of Sant’ Iago, on the\nleft side of the Santa Cruz parish church, La Concepcion. Planted\nagainst the wall flanking the cross, in long coffin-like cases with\nglass fronts, they have been the object of marked attention on the part\nof sundry British middies. And the baser sort of town-folk never fail to\nshow by their freedom, or rather impudence of face and deportment, that\nthey have not forgotten the old story, and that they still glory in\nhaving repulsed the best sailor in Europe.",
        "TO GRAND CANARY–LAS PALMAS, THE CAPITAL.",
        "At noon (January 10) the British and African s.s. Senegal weighed\nfor Grand Canary, which stood in unusually distinct relief to the east,\nand which, this time, was not moated by a tumbling sea. Usually it is;\nmoreover, it lies hidden by a bank of French-grey clouds, here and there\nsun-gilt and wind-bleached. We saw the ’Pike’ bury itself under the blue\nhorizon, at first cloaked in its wintry ermines and then capped with\nfleecy white nimbus, which confused itself with the snows.",
        "I had now a good opportunity of observing my fellow-passengers bound\ndown south. They consisted of the usual four classes–naval, military,\ncolonial officials, and commercials. The latter I noted narrowly as the\nquondam good Shepherd of the so-called ’Palm-oil Lambs.’ All were young\nfellows without a sign of the old trader, and well-mannered enough. When\nreturning homewards, however, their society was by no means so pleasant;\nit was noisy, and ’larky,’ besides being addicted to the dullest\npractical jokes, such as peppering beds. On board Senegal each\nsat at meat with his glass of Adam’s ale by his plate-side, looking\nprim, and grave, and precise as persons at a christening who are not in\nthe habit of frequenting christenings. Captain Keene took the earliest\nopportunity of assuring me that since my time–indeed, since the last\nten years–the Bights and the Bightsmen had greatly changed; that\nspirit-drinking was utterly unknown, and that ten-o’clock-go-to-bed life\nwas the general rule. But this unnatural state of things did not last\nlong. Wine, beer, and even Martell (three stars) presently reappeared;\nand I noted that the evening-chorus had preserved all its peculiar\nverve. The fact is that West Africa has been subjected to the\nhateful espionage, that prying into private affairs, which dates in\nWestern India from the days of a certain nameless governor. Every\nattempt at jollification was reported to the houses at home, and often\nan evil rumour against a man went to Liverpool and returned to ’the\nCoast’ before it was known to himself and his friends in the same\nriver. May all such dismal attempts to make Jack and Jill dull boys and\ngirls fail as utterly!",
        "Early in the afternoon we steamed past Galdar and La Guia, rival\nvillages famed for cheeses on the north-western coast of lumpy Grand\nCanary, sheets of habitation gleaming white at the feet of their\nrespective brown montañetas. The former was celebrated in local\nstory; its Guanche guanarteme, or great chief, as opposed to the\nsubordinate mencey, being one of the two potentates in ’Tameran,’\nthe self-styled ’Island of Braves.’ This, too, was the site of the\nTahoro, or Tagoror, temple and senate-house of the ancients. The\nprincipal interest of these wild people is the mysterious foreknowledge\nof their fate that seems to have come to them by a manner of intuition,\nof uninspired prophecy. [Footnote: So in Candelaria of Tenerife the\nVirgin appeared in effigy to the shepherds of Chimisay in 1392, a\ncentury before the Norman Conquest, and dwelt fifty-four years amongst\nthe Gentiles of Chinguaro. At least so say DD. Juan Nuñez de la Peña\n(Conquista i Antiguidades de la Gran Canaria, &c., Madrid, 1676);\nAntonio Viana (Antiguidades de las Islas Afortunadas, &c.,\nSeville, 1604) in his heroic poem, and Fray Alonzo de Espinosa\n(Historia de la Aparicion y Milagres de la Imagem de N.S. de\nCandelaria). The learned and unprejudiced Canon Viera y Clavijo\n(Noticias de la Historia geral de las Islas de Canaria, 3 vols.)\nbravely doubts whether reason and sane criticism had flourished together\nin those times.]",
        "In the clear winter-air we could distinctly trace the bold contour of\nthe upper heights tipped by the central haystack, El Nublo, a giant\ntrachytic monolith. We passed Confital Bay, whose ’comfits’ are galettes\nof stone, and gave a wide berth to the Isleta and its Sphinx’s\nhead. This rocky peninsula, projecting sharply from the north-eastern\nchord of the circle, is outlined by a dangerous reef, and drops suddenly\ninto 130 fathoms. Supported on the north by great columns of basalt, it\nis the terminus of a secondary chain, trending north-east–south-west,\nand meeting the Cumbre, or highest ground, whose strike is\nnorth-west–south-east. Like the knuckle-bone of the Tenerife ham it is\na contorted mass of red and black lavas and scoriae, with sharp slides\nand stone-floods still distinctly traceable. Of its five eruptive cones\nthe highest, which supports the Atalaya Vieja, or old look-out, now the\nsignal-station, rises to 1,200 feet. A fine lighthouse, with detached\nquarters for the men, crowns another crater-top to the north. The grim\nblock wants water at this season, when the thinnest coat of green\nclothes its black-red forms. La Isleta appears to have been a\nburial-ground of the indigenes, who, instead of stowing away their\nmummies in caves, built detached sepulchres and raised tumuli of scoriae\nover their embalmed dead. As at Peruvian Arica, many remains have been\nexposed by modern earthquakes and landslips.",
        "Rounding the Islet, and accompanied by curious canoes like paper-boats,\nand by fishing-craft which bounded over the waves like dolphins, we spun\nby the Puerto de la Luz, a line of flat-topped whitewashed houses, the\nonly remarkable feature being the large and unused Lazaretto. A few\nbarques still lie off the landing-place, where I have been compelled\nmore than once to take refuge. In my day it was proposed to cut a\nship-canal through the low neck of barren sand, which bears nothing but\na ’chapparal’ of tamarisk. During the last twenty years, however, the\nisthmus has been connected with the mainland by a fine causeway, paved\nwith concrete, and by an excellent highroad. The sand of the neck,\nthrown by the winds high up the cliffs which back the city, evidently\ndates from the days when La Isleta was an island. It contrasts sharply\nwith the grey basaltic shingle that faces the capital and forms the\nship-building yard.",
        "We coasted along the yellow lowland, with its tormented background of\ntall cones, bluffs, and falaises; and we anchored, at 4 P.M., in\nthe roadstead of Las Palmas, north of the spot where our\ns.s. Senegal whilom broke her back. The capital, fronting east,\nlike Santa Cruz, lies at the foot of a high sea-wall, whose straight and\nsloping lines betray their submarine origin: in places it is caverned\nfor quarries and for the homes of the troglodyte artisans; and up its\nflanks straggle whitewashed boxes towards the local necropolis. The\ndryness of the atmosphere destroys aerial perspective; and the view\nlooks flat as a scene-painting. The terraced roofs suggest to Britishers\nthat the top-floor has been blown off. Las Palmas is divided into two\nhalves, northern and southern, by a grim black wady, like the Madeiran\nribeiras, [Footnote: According to the usual law of the neo-Latin\nlanguages, ’ribeiro’ (masc.) is a small cleft, ’ribeira’ (fem.) is a\nlarge ravine.] the ’Giniguada,’ or Barranco de la Ciudad, the normal\ngrisly gashes in the background curtain. The eye-striking buildings are\nthe whitewashed Castillo del Rey, a flat fort of antique structure\ncrowning the western heights and connected by a broken wall with the\nCasa Mata, or platform half-way down: it is backed by a larger and\nstronger work, the Castillo de Sant’ Ana. The next notability is the new\ntheatre, large enough for any European capital. Lastly, an immense and\ngloomy pile, the Cathedral rises conspicuously from the white sheet of\ncity, all cubes and windows. Clad in a suit of sombrest brown patched\nwith plaster, with its domelet and its two towers of basalt very far\napart. This fane is unhappily fronted westward, the high altar facing\nJerusalem. And thus it turns its back upon the world of voyagers.",
        "In former days, when winds and waves were high, we landed on the sands\nnear the dark grey Castillo de la Luz, in the Port of Light. Thence we\nhad to walk, ride, or drive–when a carriage was to be hired–over the\nfour kilomètres which separated us from the city. We passed the Castles\nof San Fernando and La Catalina to the villas and the gardens planted\nwith thin trees that outlie the north; and we entered the capital by a\nneat bridge thrown over the Barranco de la Mata, where a wall from the\nupper castle once kept out the doughty aborigines. Thence we fell into\nthe northern quarter, La Triana, and found shabby rooms and shocking\nfare either at the British Hotel (Mrs. Bishop) or the Hôtel Monson–both\nno more. Now we land conveniently, thanks to Dons Santiago Verdugo and\nJuan Leon y Castilhos, at a spur of the new pier with the red light, to\nthe north of the city, and find ourselves at once in the streets. For\nmany years this comfortable mole excited the strongest opposition: it\nwas wasting money, and the stones, carelessly thrown in, would at once\nbe carried off by the sea and increase the drenching breakers which\noutlie the beach. Time has, as usual, settled the dispute. It is now\nbeing prolonged eastwards; but again they say that the work is swept\naway as soon as done; that the water is too deep, and even that sinking\na ship loaded with stones would not resist the strong arm of Eurus, who\nburies everything in surf. The mole is provided with the normal\nSanidad, or health office, with solid magazines, and with a\ncivilised tramway used to transport the huge cubes of concrete. At the\ntongue-root is a neat little garden, wanting only shade: two\ndragon-trees here attract the eye. Thence we pass at once into the main\nline, La Triana, which bisects the commercial town. This reminiscence of\nthe Seville suburb begins rather like a road than a street, but it ends\nwith the inevitable cobble-stones. The trottoirs, we remark, are\nof flags disposed lengthways; in the rival Island they lie\ncrosswise. The thoroughfares are scrupulously named, after Spanish\nfashion; in Fernando Po they labelled even the bush-roads. The\nsubstantial houses with green balconies are white, bound in brown\nedgings of trachyte, basalt, and lava: here and there a single story of\nrude construction stands like a dwarf by the side of its giant\nneighbour.",
        "The huge and still unfinished cathedral is well worth a visit. It is\ncalled after Santa Ana, a personage in this island. When Grand Canary\nhad been attacked successively and to scant purpose by De Béthencourt\n(1402), by Diego de Herrera (1464), and by Diego de Silva, the Catholic\nQueen and King sent, on January 24, 1474, Don Juan Rejon to finish the\nwork. This Conquistador, a morose and violent man, was marching\nupon the west of the island, where his reception would have been of the\nwarmest, when he was met at the site of the present Ermita de San\nAntonio by an old fisherman, who advised him of his danger. He took\nwarning, fortified his camp, which occupied the site of the present\ncity, beat off the enemy, and defeated, at the battle of Giniguada, a\nleague of chiefs headed by the valiant and obstinate Doramas. The\nfisherman having suddenly disappeared, incontinently became a miraculous\napparition of the Virgin’s mother. Rejon founded the cathedral in her\nhonour; but he was not destined to rest in it. He was recalled to\nSpain. He attacked Grand Canary three times, and as often failed; at\nlast he left it, and after all his campaigns he was killed and buried at\nGomera. Nor, despite Saint Anne, did the stout islanders yield to Pedro\nde Vera (1480-83) till they had fought an eighty years’ fight for\nindependence.",
        "The cathedral, which Mr. P. Barker Webb compares with the Church of\nSt. Sulpice, is built of poor schiste and bad sandstone-rubble, revetted\nwith good lava and basalt. The latter material here takes in age a fine\nmellow creamy coat, as in the ’giant cities’ of the Hauran, the absurd\ntitle of Mr. Porter. The order is Ionic below, Corinthian above, and the\npile sadly wants a dome instead of a pepper-caster domelet. One of the\ntowers was finished only forty-five years ago, and a Scotch merchant\nadded, much to his disgust, a weather-cock. In the interior green, blue,\nand yellow glass tempers the austerity of the whitewashed walls and the\ngloom of the grey basaltic columns, bindings, and ceiling-ribbings.\nConcerning the ceiling, which prettily imitates an archwork\nof trees, they tell the following tale. The Bishop and Chapter,\nhaving resolved in 1500 to repair the work of Don Diego Montaude,\nentrusted the work to Don Diego Nicholas Eduardo, of Laguna, an\nHispano-Hibernian–according to the English. This young architect built\nwith so light a hand that the masons struck work till he encouraged them\nby sitting beneath his own creation. The same, they say, was done at\nBelem, Lisbon. The interior is Gothic, unlike all others in the islands;\nand the piers, lofty and elegant, imitate palm-fronds, a delicate\nflattery to ’Las Palmas’ and a good specimen of local invention. There\nare a nave and two aisles: four noble transversal columns sustaining the\nchoir-vault adorn the walls. The pulpit and high altar are admirable as\nthe choir; the only eyesores are the diminutive organ and the eleven\nside-chapels with their caricatures of high art. The large and\nheavily-railed choir in mid-nave, so common in the mother country,\nbreaks the unity of the place and dwarfs its grand proportions. After\nthe manner of Spanish churches, which love to concentrate dazzling\ncolour at the upper end, the high altar is hung with crimson velvet\ncurtains; and its massive silver lamps (one Italian, presented by\nCardinal Ximenes), salvers, altar-facings, and other fixings are said to\nhave cost over 24,000 francs. The lectern is supposed to have been\npreserved from the older cathedral.",
        "There are other curiosities in this building. The sacristy, supported by\nside-walls on the arch principle, and ceilinged with stone instead of\nwood, is shown as a minor miracle. The vestry contains gigantic\nwardrobes, full of ladies’ delights–marvellous vestments, weighted with\nmassive braidings of gold and silver, most delicate handwork in every\nimaginable colour and form. There are magnificent donations of\ncrucifixes and candlesticks, cups, goblets, and other vessels required\nby the church services–all the result of private piety. In the Chapel\nof St. Catherine, built at his own expense, lies buried Cairasco, the\nbard whom Cervantes recognised as his master in style. His epitaph,\ndating A.D. 1610, reads–",
        "A statue to him was erected opposite the old ’Cairasco Theatre’ in\n1876. Under the grand altar, with other dignitaries of the cathedral,\nare the remains of the learned and amiable historian of the isles, Canon\nJosé de Viera y Clavigo, born at Lanzarote, poet, ’elegant translator’\nof Buffon, lexicographer, and honest man.",
        "Directly facing the cathedral-façade is the square, headed by the\nAyuntamiento, an Ionic building which would make a first-rate\nhotel. Satirical Britishers declare that it was copied from one of Day\nand Martin’s labels. The old townhall was burnt in 1842, and of its\nvaluable documents nothing was saved. On the right of the plaza is an\nhumble building, the episcopal palace, founded in 1578 by Bishop\nCristobal de la Vega. It was rebuilt by his successor, Cristobal de la\nCamara, who forbade the pretty housekeeper, prohibited his priests from\nentering nunneries, and prescribed public confessionals–a measure still\nmuch to be desired. But he must have been a man of extreme views, for he\nactually proscribed gossip. This was some thirty years after Admiral van\nder Does and his Dutchmen fired upon the city and were beaten off with a\nloss of 2,000 men.",
        "South of the cathedral, and in Colegio Street (so called from the\nAugustine college, [Footnote: There is still a college of that name\nwhere meteorological observations are regularly made.] now converted\ninto a tribunal), we find a small old house with heavily barred\nwindows–the ex-Inquisition. This also has been desecrated into\nutility. The Holy Office began in 1504, and became a free tribunal in\n1567. Its palace was here founded in 1659 by Don José Balderan, and\nrestored in 1787 by Don Diego Nicholas Eduardo, whose fine fronting\nstaircase has been much admired. The Holy Tribunal broke up in 1820,\nwhen, the Constitution proving too strong for St. Dominic, the\ncollege-students mounted the belfry; and, amid the stupefaction of the\nshuddering multitude, joyously tolled its death-knell. All the material\nwas sold, even the large leather chairs with gilt nails used for\necclesiastical sitting. ’God defend us from its resurrection,’ mutters\nthe civil old huissier, as he leads us to the dungeons below through the\nmean court with its poor verandah propped on wooden posts. Part of it\nfacing the magistrates’ chapel was turned into a prison for petty\nmalefactors; and the two upper salas were converted into a\nprovisional Audiencia, or supreme court, large halls hung with\nthe portraits of the old governors. The new Audiencia at the\nbottom of Colegio Street, built by M. Botta at an expense of 20,000\ndollars, has a fine court with covered cloisters above and an open\ngallery below, supported by thin pillars of basalt.",
        "Resuming our walk down La Triana southwards, we note the grand new\ntheatre, not unlike that of Dresden: it wants only opening and a\ncompany. Then we cross the Giniguada wady by a bridge with a wooden\nfloor, iron railings, and stone piers, and enter the Viñeta, or\nofficial, as opposed to the commercial, town. On the south side is the\nfish-market, new, pretty, and gingerbread. It adjoins the general\nmarket, a fine, solid old building like that of Santa Cruz, containing\nbakers’ and butchers’ stalls, and all things wanted by the\nhousekeeper. A little beyond it the Triana ends in an archway leading to\na square court, under whose shaded sides mules and asses are\ntethered. We turn to the right and gain Balcones Street, where stands\nthe comfortable hotel of Don Ramon Lopez. Most soothing to the eye is\nthe cool green-grown patio after the prospect of the hot and\nbarren highlands which back the Palm-City.",
        "Walking up the right flank of the Giniguada Ribeira, we cross the old\nstone bridge with three arches and marble statues of the four\nseasons. It places us in the Plazuela, the irregular space which leads\nto the Mayor de Triana, the square of the old theatre. The western side\nis occupied by a huge yellow building, the old Church and Convent of San\nFrancisco, now turned into barracks. In parts it is battlemented; and\nits belfry, a wall of basalt pierced with a lancet-arch to hang bells,\nhints at earthquakes. An inscription upon the old theatre, the usual\nneat building of white and grey-brown basalt, informs us that it was\nbuilt in 1852, ad honorem of two deputies. But Santa Cruz, the\nmodern capital, has provided herself with a larger and a better house;\nergo Las Palmas, the old capital, must fain do the same. The\nmetropolis of Grand Canary, moreover, claims to count more noses than\nthat of Tenerife. To the west of the older theatre, in the same block,\nis the casino, club, and ball-room, with two French billiard-tables and\nsmoking-rooms. The old hotel attached to the theatre has now ceased to\nexist.",
        "On the opposite side of the square lies the little Alameda promenade,\nthe grounds once belonging to St. Francis. The raised walk, shaded by a\npretty arch-way of palm-trees, is planted with myrtles, dahlias, and\nbignonias. It has all the requisites of its kind–band-stand,\ngreen-posted oil-lamps, and scrolled seats of brown basalt. Round this\nsquare rise the best houses, mostly new; as in the Peninsula, however,\nas well as in both archipelagos, all have shops below. We are beginning\nto imitate this excellent practice of utilising the unwholesome\nground-floor in the big new hotels of London. Two large houses are, or\nwere, painted to mimic brick, things as hideous as anything further\nnorth.",
        "In this part of the Triana lived the colony of English merchants, once\nso numerous that they had their own club and gymnasium. All had taken\nthe local colouring, and were more Spanish than the Spaniards. A\ncelebrated case of barratry was going on in 1863, the date of my first\nvisit, when Lloyds sent out a detective and my friend Capt. Heathcote,\nI.N., to conduct the legal proceedings. I innocently asked why the\nBritish vice-consul was not sufficient, and was assured that no resident\ncould interfere, alias dared do his duty, under pain of social\nostracism and a host of enmities. In those days a man who gained his\nlawsuit went about weaponed and escorted, as in modern Ireland, by a\ntroop of armed servants. Landlord-potting also was by no means unknown;\nand the murder of the Marquess de las Palmas caused memorable sensation.",
        "Indescribable was the want of hospitality which characterised the\nHispano-Englishmen of Las Palmas. I have called twice upon a\nfellow-countryman without his dreaming of asking me upstairs. Such\nshyness may be understood in foreigners, who often entertain wild ideas\nconcerning what an Englishman expects. But these people were wealthy;\nnor were they wholly expatriated. Finally, it was with the utmost\ndifficulty that I obtained from one of them a pound of home-grown\narrowroot for the sick child of a friend.",
        "On the other hand, I have ever met with the greatest civility from the\nSpanish Canarians. I am especially indebted to Don J. B. Carlo, the\npacket-agent, who gave me copies of ’El Museo Canario, Revista de la\nSociedad del mismo nombre’ (Las Palmas)–the transactions published by\nthe Museum of Las Palmas. Two mummies of Canarian origin have lately\nbeen added to the collection, and the library has become\nrespectable. The steamers are now so hurried that I had no time to\ninspect it, nor to call upon Don Gregorio Chil y Naranjo, President of\nthe Anthropological Society. This savant, whose name has become well\nknown in Paris, is printing at Las Palmas his ’Estudios Historicos,’\n&c., the outcome of a life’s labour. Don Agustin Millares is also\npublishing ’La Historia de las Islas Canarias,’ in three volumes, each\nof 400 to 450 pages.",
        "I made three short excursions in Grand Canary to Telde, to the Caldera,\nand to Doramas, which showed me the formation of the island. My notes\ntaken at the time must now be quoted. En route for the former, we\ndrove past the large city-hospital: here in old times was another strong\nwall, defending the southern part, and corresponding with the northern\nor Barranco line. The road running to the south-south-west was\npeculiarly good; the tunnel through the hill-spur suggested classical\nand romantic Posilippo. It was well parapeted near the sea, and it had\nheavy cuttings in the white tosca, a rock somewhat resembling the\ncalcaire grossier of the Paris basin. This light pumice-like\nstone, occasionally forming a conglomerate or pudding, and slightly\neffervescing with acids, is fertile where soft, and where hard quite\nsterile. Hereabouts lay Gando, one of the earliest forts built by the\nConquistadores. We then bent inland, or westward, crossed barren\nstony ground, red and black, and entered the pretty and fertile valley\nwith its scatter of houses known as La Vega de Ginamar.",
        "I obtained a guide, and struck up the proper right of a modern lava-bed\nwhich does not reach the sea. The path wound around rough hills, here\nand there scattered with fig-trees and vines, with lupines, euphorbias,\nand other wild growths. From the summit of the southern front we sighted\nthe Cima de Ginamar, popularly called El Pozo (the Well). It is a\nvolcanic blowing-hole of oval shape, about fifty feet in long diameter,\nand the elliptical mouth discharged to the north the lava-bed before\nseen. Apparently it is connected with the Bandana Peak, further\nwest. Here the aborigines martyred sundry friars before the\nConquistadores ’divided land and water’ amongst them. The guide\ndeclared that the hole must reach the sea, which lies at least 1,200\nfeet below; that the sound of water is often to be heard in it, and that\nmen, let down to recover the corpses of cattle, had been frightened away\nby strange sights and sounds. He threw in stones, explaining that they\nmust be large, otherwise they lodge upon the ledges. I heard them dash,\ndash, dash from side to side, at various intervals of different depths,\ntill the pom-om-m subsided into silence. The crevasses showed no sign of\nthe rock-pigeon (Columba livia), a bird once abounding. Nothing\ncould be weirder than the effect of the scene in clear moonlight: the\ncontrast of snowy beams and sable ground perfectly suited the uncanny\nlook and the weird legends of the site.",
        "Beyond the Cima we made the gay little town of Telde, which lodges some\n4,000 souls, entering it by a wide fiumara, over which a bridge\nwas then building. The streets were mere lines of scattered houses, and\nthe prominent buildings were the white dome of San Pedro and San Juan\nwith its two steeples of the normal grey basalt. Near the latter lay the\nlittle Alameda, beggar-haunted as usual. On the north side of the\nBarranco rose a caverned rock inhabited by the poor. We shall see this\ntroglodytic feature better developed elsewhere.",
        "To visit the Caldera de Bandana, three miles from the city, we hired a\ncarriage with the normal row of three lean rats, which managed, however,\nto canter or gallop the greater part of the way. The boy-driver,\nAgustin, was a fair specimen of his race, obstinate as a Berber or a\nmule. As it was Sunday he wanted to halt at every venta (pub),\ncurioseando–that is, admiring the opposite sex. Some of the\nyounger girls are undoubtedly pretty, yet they show unmistakable signs\nof Guanche blood. The toilette is not becoming: here the shawl takes the\nplace of the mantilla, and the head-covering, as in Tenerife, is capped\nby the hideous billycock. To all my remonstrances Don Agustin curtly\nreplied with the usual island formula, ’Am I a slave?’ This class has a\nsurly, grumbling way, utterly wanting the dignity of the lower-order\nSpaniard and the Moor; and it is to be managed only by threatening to\nwithhold the propinas (tip). But the jarvey, like the bath-man,\nthe barber, and generally the body-servant and the menial classes which\nwait upon man’s person, are not always models of civility.",
        "We again passed the hospital and ascended the new zigzag to the right of\nthe Giniguada. The torrent-bed, now bright green with arum and pepper,\ngrows vegetables, maize, and cactus. Its banks bear large plantations of\nthe dates from which Las Palmas borrows her pretty Eastern names. In\nmost places they are mere brabs, and, like the olive, they fail to\nfruit. The larger growths are barbarously docked, as in Catholic\ncountries generally; and the fronds are reduced to mere brooms and\nrats’-tails. The people are not fond of palms; the shade and the roots,\nthey say, injure their crops, and the tree is barely worth one dollar\nper annum.",
        "At the top of the Cuesta de San Roque, which reminded me of its namesake\nnear Gibraltar, I found a barren ridge growing only euphorbia. The\nBarranco Seco, on the top, showed in the sole a conspicuously big house\nwhich has no other view but the sides of a barren trough. This was the\n’folly’ of an eccentric nobleman, who preferred the absence to the\ncompany of his friends.",
        "Half an hour’s cold, bleak drive placed us at the Tafira village. Here\nthe land yields four crops a year, two of maize and two of\npotatoes. Formerly worth $100 per acre, the annual value had been raised\nby cochineal to $500. All, however, depends upon water, which is\nenormously dear. The yelping curs have mostly bushy tails, like those\nwhich support the arms of the Canary Islands. The grey and green finches\nrepresent our ’domestic warbler’ (Fringilla canaria), which\nreached England about 1500, when a ship with a few birds on board had\nbeen wrecked off Elba.",
        "[Footnote: The canary bird builds, on tall bushes rather than trees, a\nnest of moss, roots, feathers and rubbish, where it lays from four to\nsix pale-blue eggs. It moults in August and September; pairs in\nFebruary, and sometimes hatches six times in a season. The natives\ndeclare that the wild birds rarely survive the second year of captivity;\nyet they do not seem to suffer from it, as they begin to sing at once\nwhen caged. Mr. Addison describes the note as ’between that of the\nskylark and the nightingale,’ and was surprised to find that each flock\nhas a different song–an observation confirmed by the people and noted\nby Humboldt (p. 87).]",
        "The country folk were habited in shirts, drawers derived from the Moors,\nand tasseled caps of blue stuff, big enough for carpet-bags. The vine\nstill covered every possible slope of black soil, and the aloes, crowned\nwith flowers, seemed to lord it over the tamarisks, the hemlocks, and\nthe nightshades.",
        "Upon this monte, or wooded height, most of the gentry have\ncountry-houses, the climate being 12 degrees (Fahr.) cooler than by the\nsea. La Brigida commands a fine view of the Isleta, with its black sand\nand white foam, leek-green waters upon the reefs, and deep offing of\nsteely blue.",
        "Leaving the carriage at the forking road, I mounted, after a bad\ndescent, a rough hill, and saw to the left the Pico de Bandana, a fine\nregular cone 1,850 feet high. A group of a few houses, El Pueblo de la\nCaldera, leads to the famous Cauldron, which Sir Charles Lyell visited\nby mistake for that of Palma. Travellers compare it with the lakes of\nNemi and Albano: I found it tame after the cup of Fernando Po with its\nbeautiful lining of hanging woods. It has only the merit of\nregularity. The unbroken upper rim measures about half a mile in\ndiameter, and the lower funnel 3,000 feet in circumference. The sides of\npiedra pomez (pumice) are lined and ribbed with rows of\nscoriaceous rock as regular as amphitheatre-seats, full 1,000 feet deep,\nand slope easily into a flat sole, which some are said to have reached\non horseback. A copious fountain, springing from the once fiery inside,\nis collected below for the use of the farm-house, El Fondo de la\nCaldera. The fields have the effect of a little Alpine tarn of bright\ngreen. Here wild pigeons are sometimes caught at night, and rabbits and\npartridges are or were not extinct. I ascended Bandana Peak to the\nnorth-north-east, the piton of this long extinct volcano, and\nenjoyed the prospect of the luxuriant vegetation, the turquoise sea, and\nthe golden sands about Maspalomas, the southernmost extremity of Grand\nCanary.",
        "Returning to the road-fork, I mounted a hill on the right hand and\nsighted the Atalaya, another local lion. Here a perpendicular face of\ncalcareous rock fronts a deep valley, backed by a rounded hill, with the\nblue chine of El Cumbre in the distance: this is the highest of the\nridge, measuring 8,500 feet. The wall is pierced, like the torrent-side\nof Mar Saba (Jerusalem), with caves that shelter a troglodyte population\nnumbering some 2,000 souls. True to their Berber origin, they seek\nrefuge in the best of savage lodgings from heat, cold, and wind. The\nsite rises some 2,000 feet above sea-level, and the strong wester twists\nthe trees. Grand Canary preserves more of these settlements than\nTenerife; they are found in many parts of the island, and even close to\nthe capital. Madeira, on the other hand, affects them but little. We\nmust not forget that they still exist at St. Come, within two hours’\nrail of Paris, where my learned and lamented friend Dr. Broca had a\ncountry-house.",
        "Descending a rough, steep slope, I entered the upper tier of the\nsettlement, where the boxes were built up with whitewashed fronts. The\ncaves are mostly divided by matting into ’buts’ and ’bens.’ Heaps of\npots, antiquated in shape and somewhat like the Etruscan, showed the\ntrade of the place, and hillocks of potatoes the staff of life. The\nside-walls were hollowed for shelves, and a few prints of the Virgin and\nother sacred subjects formed the decoration. Settles and rude tables\ncompleted the list of movables; and many had the huge bed affected by\nthe Canarian cottager, which must be ascended with a run and a jump. The\npredatory birds, gypsies and others, flocked down from their nests,\nclamouring for cuartitos and taking no refusal.",
        "It occupies a week to ride round the island, whose circumference\nmeasures about 120 miles. I contented myself with a last excursion to\nDoramas, which then supplied meat, cheese, and grain to Tenerife. My\nguide was old Antonio Martinez, who assured me that he was the ’most\nclassical man’ in the island; and with two decent hill-ponies we struck\nto the north-west. There is little to describe in the tour. The Cuesta\nBlanca showed us the regular cones of Arúcas. Beyond Tenoya town I\ninspected a crateriform ravine, and Monte Cardones boasted a honeycomb\nof caves like the Atalaya. The fine rich vega of Arúcas, a long\nwhite settlement before whose doors rose drying heaps of maize and black\ncochineal, was a pleasant, smiling scene. All the country settlements\nare built pretty much upon the same plan: each has its Campo Santo with\nwhite walls and high grey gate, through which the coffin is escorted by\nGaucho-like riders, who dismount to enter. Doramas proved to be a fine\nmonte, with tree-stumps, especially chestnuts, somewhat\nsurprising in a region of ferns and furze. Near the little village of\nFriga I tasted an agua agria, a natural sodawater, which the\npeople hold to be of sovereign value for beast as well as man. It\nincreases digestion and makes happy mothers, like the fountain of\nVillaflor on the Tenerifan ’Pike ’-slope. I found it resembling an\neau gazeuse left in the open all night. We then pushed on to\nTeror, famous for turkeys, traversed the high and forested northern\nplateau, visited Galdar and Guia of the cheeses, and rode back by\nBañaderos Bay and the Cuesta da Silva, renowned in olden island story.",
        "These three days gave me a fair general view of Grand Canary. The\nCumbre, or central plateau, whose apex is Los Pexos (6,400 feet), well\nwooded with pines and Alpines, collects moisture in abundance. From this\nplateau barrancos, or ravine-valleys, said to number 103, radiate\nquaquaversally. Their bottoms, becoming more and more level as they near\nthe sea, are enriched by gushing founts, and are unrivalled for\nfertility, while the high and stony intervening ridges are barren as\nArabia Deserta. Even sun and rain cannot fertilise the dividing walls of\nthe rich and riant vegas. Here, as at Madeira, and showing even a\nbetter likeness, the tierra caliente is Egypt, the mediania\n(middle-heights) are Italy, and the upper mesetas, the cloud-compelling\ntable-lands, are the bleak north of Europe plus a quasi-tropical sun.",
        "THE COCHINEAL–THE ’GALLO’–CANARY ’SACK’–ADIEU TO THE CANARIES.",
        "I must not leave the Jezirát el-Bard (of Gold), or Jezirát el-Khálidát\n(Happy Islands), without some notice of their peculiar institutions, the\ncochineal, the gallo, and Canary ’sack.’",
        "The nopal or tunal plant (Opuntia Tuna or Cactus\ncochinellifera) is indigenous on these islands as well as on the\nmainland of Africa. But the native growth is woody and lean-leaved; and\nits cooling fruit, which we clumsily term a ’prickly pear’ or ’fig,’ is\neverywhere a favourite in hot climates. There are now sundry claimants\nto the honour of having here fathered the modern industry. Some say that\nin 1823 a retired intendant introduced from Mexico the true\nterciopelo, or velvet-leaf, together with the Mexican cochineal,\nthe coccus cacti hemipter, [Footnote: The male insect is winged\nfor flight. The female never stirs from the spot where she begins to\nfeed: she lays her eggs, which are innumerable and microscopic, and she\nleaves them in the membrane or hardened envelope which she has\nsecreted.] so called from the old Greek KÓKKOS, a berry, or the\nneo-Greek KOKKIVOS, red, scarlet. It is certain that Don Santiago\nde la Cruz brought both plant and ’bug’ from Guatemala or Honduras in\n1835; and that an Englishman, who has advanced a right even in writing,\nlabours under a not uncommon hallucination.",
        "But the early half of the present century was the palmy day of the\nvine. The people resisted the cactus-innovation as the English labourer\ndid the introduction of machinery, and tore up the plants. Enough,\nhowever, remained in the south of Tenerife for the hour of\nneed. Travellers in search of the picturesque still lament that the ugly\nstranger has ousted the trellised vine and the wild, free myrtles. But\npublic opinion changed when fortunes were made by selling the\ninsect. Greedy as the agriculturist in general, the people would refuse\nthe value of a full crop of potatoes or maize if they suspected that the\nofferer intended to grow cochineal. No dye was prepared on the islands,\nand the peasants looked upon it as a manner of mystery.",
        "The best tuneras (cochineal-plantations) lay in Grand Canary,\nwhere they could be most watered. Wherever maize thrives, producing a\ngood dark leaf and grain in plenty, there cochineal also succeeds. The\nsoil is technically called mina de tosca, a whitish, pumice-like\nstone, often forming a gravel conglomerate under a rocky stratum:\nhardening by exposure, it is good for building. Immense labour is\nrequired to prepare such ground for the cactus. The earth must be taken\nfrom below the surface-rock, as at Malta; spread in terraced beds, and\ncleared of loose stones, which are built up in walls or in\nmolleras, cubes or pyramids. Such ground sold for $150 per acre;\n$600 were paid for mètre-deep soil unencumbered by stone. Where the\nchalk predominates, it must be mixed with the volcanic sand locally\ncalled zahorra. In all cases the nopals are set at distances of\nhalf a yard, in trenches at least three feet deep. The ’streets,’ or\nintervals, must measure nearly two yards, so that water may flow freely\nand sunshine may not be arrested. Good ground, if irrigated in winter\nand kept clear of weeds by the haçada (hoe), produces a cactus\ncapable of being ’seeded’ after the second year; if poor, a third is\nrequired. The plant lasts, with manure to defend it from exhaustion, a\nfull decade. [Footnote: The compost was formerly natural, dry or liquid\nas in Switzerland; but for some years the costly guano and chemicals\nhave been introduced. Formerly also potatoes were set between the stems;\nand well-watered lands gave an annual grain-crop as well as a green\ncrop.]",
        "I now translate the memoir sent in MS. to me by my kind friend\nDundas. It is the work of Don Abel de Aguilar, Consul Impérial de\nRussie, a considerable producer of the ’bug.’",
        "The semillado, or cochineal-sowing, is divided into three\ncosechas (crops), according to the several localities in the\nislands.",
        "The abuelas (grandmothers) are those planted in\nOctober-November. Their seed gives a new growth set in February-March,\nand called madres (mothers). Thirdly, those planted in June-July,\ngathered in September-October, and serving to begin with the\nabuelas, are called la cosecha (the crop). The first and\nsecond may be planted on the seaboard; the last is confined to the\nmidlands and uplands, on account of the heat and the hot winds,\nespecially the souther and the south-south-easter, which asphyxiate the\ninsect.",
        "And now of the abuelas, as cultivated in the maritime regions\nof Santa Cruz, Tenerife.",
        "Every cochineal-plantation must have a house with windows facing the\nsouth, and freely admitting the light–an indispensable condition. The\ncuarto del semillado (breeding-room) should be heated by stoves\nto a regular temperature of 30°-32° (R.). At this season the proportion\nof seed is calculated at 30 boxes of 40 lbs. each, or a total of 1,200\nlbs. per fanega, the latter being equivalent to a half-hectare.\nThe cochineal is placed in large wooden trays lined with\ncloth, and containing about 15 lbs. of the recently gathered seed. When\nfilled without crowding, the trays are covered with squares of\ncotton-cloth (raw muslin), measuring 12-16 inches. Usually the\nfanega requires 20-30 quintals (128 lbs., or a cwt.), each\ncosting $15 to $17. The newly born insects (hijuelos) adhere to\nthe cochineal-rags, and these are carried to the tunera, in\ncovered baskets.",
        "The operation is repeated with fresh rags till the parturition is\ncompleted. The last born, after 12-15 days, are the weakest. They are\nknown by their dark colour, the earlier seed being grey-white, like\ncigar-ashes. The cochineal which has produced all its insects is known\nin the markets as ’zacatillas.’ It commanded higher prices, because the\nwatery parts had disappeared and only the colouring matter remained. Now\nits value is that of the white or cosecha.",
        "The cochineal-rags are then carried by women and girls to the\ntunera, and are attached to the cactus-leaves by passing the\ncloths round them and by pinning them on with the thorns. This\noperation, requires great care, judgment, and experience. The good\nresults of the crop depend upon the judicious distribution of the\n’bugs;’ and error is easy when making allowance for their loss by wind,\nrain, or change of temperature. The insects walk over the whole leaf,\nand choose their places sheltered as much as possible, although still\ncovered by the rags. After 8-10 days they insert the proboscis into the\ncactus, and never stir till gathered. At the end of three and a half to\nfour months they become ’grains of cochineal,’ not unlike wheat, but\nsmaller, rounder, and thicker. The sign of maturity is the appearance of\nnew insects upon the leaf. The rags are taken off, as they were put on,\nby women and girls, and the cochineal is swept into baskets with brushes\nof palm-frond. As the abuelas grow in winter there is great loss\nof life. For each pound sown the cultivator gets only two to two and a\nhalf, innumerable insects being lost either in the house or out of\ndoors.",
        "The crop thus gathered produces the madres (mothers): the latter\nare sown in February-March, and are gathered in May-June. The only\ndifference of treatment is that the rags are removed when the weather is\nsafe and the free draught benefits the insects. The produce is\ngreater–three and a half to four pounds for one.",
        "The cosecha of the madres produces most abundantly, on\naccount of the settled weather. The cochineal breeds better in the\nhouse, where there is more light and a higher temperature. The result is\nthat 8 to 10 lbs. become 100. It is cheaper too: as a lesser proportion\nof rag is wanted for the field, and it is kept on only till the insect\nadheres. Thus a small quantity goes a long way. At this season there is\nno need of the cuarto, and bags of pierced paper or of\nrengue (loose gauze), measuring 10 inches long by 2 broad, are\npreferred. A spoonful of grain, about 4 ounces, is put into each bag and\nis hung to the leaves: the young ones crawl through the holes or meshes\ntill the plant is sufficiently populated. In hot weather they may be\nchanged eight times a day with great economy of labour. This is the most\nfavourable form; the insects go straight to the leaves, and it is easy\nto estimate the proportions.",
        "So far Don Abel. He concludes with saying that cochineal, which in other\ndays made the fortune of his native islands, will soon be completely\nabandoned. Let us hope not.",
        "The cosecha-insects, shell-like in form, grey-coloured, of light\nweight, but all colouring matter, are either sold for breeding\nabuelas or are placed upon trays and killed in stoves by a heat\nof 150°-160° (Fahr.). The drying process is managed by reducing the\ntemperature to 140°. The time varies from twenty-four to forty-eight\nhours: when hurried it injures the crop. Ninety full-grown insects weigh\nsome forty-eight grains, and there is a great reduction by drying; some\n27,000 yield one pound of the prepared cochineal. The shiny black\ncochineal, which looks like small beetles, is produced by sun-drying,\nand by shaking the insect in a linen bag or in a small ’merry-go-round,’\nso as to remove the white powder. [Footnote: Mr. H. Vizetelly (p. 210)\nsays that black metallic sand is used to give it brilliancy.] The form,\nhowever, must be preserved. It sells 6d. per lb. higher than the\ncochinilla de plata, or silver cochineal. Lastly, the dried crop\nis packed in bags, covered with mats, and is then ready for exportation.",
        "The traffic began about 1835 with an export of only 1,275 lbs.; and\nbetween 1850 and 1860 the lb. was worth at least ten francs. Admiral\nRobinson [Footnote: Sea-drift, a volume published by subscription.\nPitman, London, 1852.] in 1852 makes the export one million of\nlbs. at one dollar each, or a total of 250,000l. During the\nrage of the oïdium the cultivation was profitable and raised\nthe Canaries high in the scale of material prosperity. In 1862\nthe islands exported 10,000 quintals, or hundred-weights, the\ntotal value being still one million of dollars. In 1877-78\nthe produce was contained in 20,000 to 25,000 bags, each\naveraging 175 lbs., at a value of half a crown per lb.: it was then\nstated that, owing to the increased expense of irrigation and of guano\nor chemical manures, nothing under two shillings would repay the\ncultivator. In 1878-79 the total export amounted to 5,045,007 lbs. In\n1879-80 this figure had fallen off to 4,036,871 lbs., a decrease of\n5,482 bags, or 1,008,136 lbs.; moreover the prices, which had been\nforced up by speculation, declined from 2s. 6d.-3s. 4d.\nto 1s. 8d. and 1s. 10d. [Footnote: These figures are taken\nfrom the able Consular Report of Mr. Consul Dundas, printed in Part\nviii., 1881.] When I last visited Las Palmas (April 1880), cochineal,\nunder the influence of magenta and mineral dyes, was selling at\n1s. 4d. instead of one to two dollars.",
        "It is to be feared that the palmy days of cochineal are over, and that\nits chief office, besides staining liqueurs and tooth-powders, will be\nto keep down the price of the chemicals. With regret I see this handsome\nand harmless colour being gradually superseded by the economical\nanilines, whose poisonous properties have not yet been fully recognised\nby the public. The change is a pregnant commentary upon the good and\nhomely old English saying, ’Cheap and nasty.’",
        "The fall of cochineal throughout the Canaries brought many successors\ninto the field, but none can boast of great success. Silk, woven and\nspun, was tried; unfortunately, the worms were fed on tartago (a\nricinus), instead of the plentiful red and white mulberries. The\nharvest was abundant, but not admired by manufacturers. In fact, the\nmoderns have failed where their predecessors treated the stuff so well\nthat Levantines imported silks to resell them in Italy. Formerly\nTenerife contained a manufactory whose lasting and brilliant produce was\nhighly appreciated in Spain as in Havana. At Palma crimson waist-sashes\nused to sell for an ounce of gold.",
        "Tobacco-growing was patronised by Government in 1878, probably with the\nview of mixing it in their monopoly-manufactories with the growths of\nCuba and Manilla. But on this favour being withdrawn the next year’s\nharvest fell to one-fourth (354,640 lbs. to 36,978). The best sites were\nin Hierro (Ferro) and Adejo, in the south of Tenerife. The chief\nobstacles to success are imperfect cultivation, the expense of skilled\nlabour, and deficiency of water to irrigate the deep black soil. Both\nVirginia and Havana leaves were grown, and good brands sold from eight\nto sixteen dollars per 100 lbs. The customers in order of quantity are\nGermany, England, France, South America, and the West Coast of Africa,\nwhere the cigars are now common. One brand (Republicanos) is so good\nthat I should not wish to smoke better. At home they sell for twelve\ndollars per 1,000; a price which rises, I am told, in England to one\nshilling each. They are to be procured through Messieurs Davidson, of\nSanta Cruz.",
        "The Canarians now talk of sugar-growing; but the cane will inevitably\nfare worse for want of water than either silk or tobacco.",
        "Next to cochineal in the Canary Islands, especially in Tenerife, ranks\nthe gallo, or fighting-cock. Cockfighting’ amongst ourselves is\nredolent of foul tobacco, bad beer, and ruffianism in low places. This\nis not the case in Spain and her colonies, where the classical sport of\nGreece and Rome still holds its ground. I have pleasant reminiscences of\nthe good Padre in the Argentine Republic who after mass repaired\nregularly to the pit, wearing his huge canoe-like hat and carrying under\nhis arm a well-bred bird instead of a breviary. Here too I was told that\nthe famous Derby breed of the twelfth Earl had extended in past times\nthroughout the length and breadth of the land; and the next visit to\nKnowsley convinced me that the legend was based on fact. As regards\ncruelty, all popular sports, fox-hunting and pigeon-shooting, are\ncruel. Grallus, however, has gained since the days of Cock-Mondays and\nCock-Fridays, when he was staked down to be killed by ’cock-sticks’ or\nwas whipped to his death by blindfolded carters. He leads the life of a\nfriar; he is tended carefully as any babe; he is permitted to indulge\nhis pugnacity, which it would be harsh to restrain, and at worst he dies\nfighting like a gentleman. A Tenerifan would shudder at the horror of\nour fashionable sport, where ruffians gouge or blind the pigeon with a\npin, squeeze it to torture, wrench out its tail, and thrust the upper\nthrough the lower mandible.",
        "The bird in Tenerife surpasses those of the other Canary Islands, and\nmore than once has carried off the prizes at Seville. A moderately\nwell-bred specimen may be bought for two dollars, but first-rate cocks\nbelonging to private fanciers have no price.",
        "Many proprietors, as at Hyderabad, in the Dakhan, will not part with\neven the eggs. The shape of the Canarian bird is rather that of a\npheasant than a ’rooster.’ The coat varies; it is black and red with\nyellow shanks, black and yellow, white and gold, and a grey, hen-like\ncolour, our ’duck-wing,’ locally called gallinho. Here, as in\nmany other places, the ’white feather’ is no sign of bad blood. The\ntoilet is peculiar. Comb and wattles are ’dubbed’ (clean shaven), and\nthe circumvental region is depilated or clipped with scissors, leaving\nonly the long tail-feathers springing from a naked surface. The skin is\ndaily rubbed, after negro fashion, with lemon-juice, inducing a fiery\nred hue: this is done for cleanliness, and is supposed also to harden\nthe cuticle. Altogether the appearance is coquet, sportsmanlike, and\ndecidedly appropriate.",
        "The game-chicks are sent to the country, like town-born babes in France\nor the sons of Arabian cities to the Bedawin’s black tents. The cockerel\nbegins fighting in his second, and is not a ’stale bird’ till his fifth\nor sixth, year. In early spring aspirants to the honours of the arena\nare brought to the towns for education and for training, which lasts\nsome six weeks. I was invited to visit a walk belonging to a wealthy\nproprietor at Orotava, who obligingly answered all my questions. Some\nfifty birds occupied the largest room of a deserted barrack, which\nproclaimed its later use at the distance of half a mile. The gladiators\nwere disposed in four long, parallel rows of cages, open cane-work,\nmeasuring three feet square. Each had a short wooden trestle placed\noutside during the day and serving by night as a perch. They were fed\nand watered at 2 P.M. The fattening maize was first given, and then\nwheat, with an occasional cram of bread-crumb and water by way of\nphysic. The masálá and multifarious spices of the Hindostani\ntrainer are here ignored.",
        "The birds are not allowed, as in India, to become so fierce that they\nattack men: this is supposed to render them too hot and headstrong in\ncombat. Every third day there is a Pecha, or spurring-match,\nwhich proves the likeliest lot. The pit for exercise is a matted circle\nabout 6 feet in diameter. A well-hodded bird is placed in it, and the\nassistant holds up a second, waving it to and fro and provoking No. 1 to\ntake his exercise by springing to the attack. The Indian style of\ngalloping the cock by showing a hen at either end of the walk is looked\nupon with disfavour, because the sight of the sex is supposed to cause\ndisease during high condition. The elaborate Eastern shampooing for\nhours has apparently never been heard of. After ten minutes’ hard\nrunning and springing the bird is sponged with Jamaica rum and water, to\nprevent chafing; the lotion is applied to the head and hind quarters, to\nthe tender and dangerous parts under the wings, and especially to the\nleg-joints. The lower mandible is then held firmly between the left\nthumb and forefinger, and a few drops are poured into the beak. Every\nalternate day the cage is placed on loose ground in sun and wind; and\nonce a week there is a longer sparring-bout with thick leather hods, or\nspur-pads.",
        "Cock-fighting takes place once a year, when the birds are in fittest\nfeather; it begins on Easter Sunday and ends with the following\nWednesday.",
        "  The bird that warned Peter of his fall",
        "has then, if victorious, a pleasant, easy twelve months of life before\nhim. He has won many a gold ounce for his owner: I have heard of a man\npouching 400l. in a contest between Orotava and La Laguna, which\nhas a well-merited celebrity for these exhibitions. The Canarians ignore\nall such refinements as rounds or Welsh mains; the birds are fairly\nmatched in pairs. Navajas, or spurs, either of silver or steel,\nare unused, if not unknown. The natural weapon is sharpened to a\nneedle-like point, and then blood and condition win. The cock-pit,\nsomewhat larger than the training-pit, is in the Casa de la Galera;\nthere is a ring for betters, and the spectators are ranged on upper\nseats.",
        "Lastly of the wine Canary, now unknown to the English market, where it\nhad a local habitation and a name as early as madeira and sherry, all\nclaiming ’Shakespearean recognition.’ The Elizabethans constantly allude\nto cups of cool Canary, and Mr. Vizetelly quotes Howell’s ’Familiar\nLetters,’ wherein he applies to this far-famed sack the dictum ’Good\nwine sendeth a man to heaven.’ But I cannot agree with the learned\noenologist, or with the ’tradition of Tenerife,’ when told that ’the\noriginal canary was a sweet and not a dry wine, as those who derive\n\"sack” from the French word “sec” would have us believe.’ ’Sherris sack’\n(jerez seco) was a harsh, dry wine, which was sugared as we\nsweeten tea. Hence Poins addresses Falstaff as ’Sir John Sack and\nSugar;’ and the latter remarks, ’If sack and sugar be a fault, God help\nthe wicked!’ And the island probably had two growths–the saccharine\nMalvasia, [Footnote: As we find in Leake (p. 197 Researches in\nGreece) and Henderson (History of Wines) ’Malvasia’ is an\nItalian corruption of ’Monemvasia’ ([Greek: monae embasia]–a\nsingle entrance), the neo-Greek name for the Minoa promontory or island\nconnected by a bridge with the Laconian Coast. Hence the French\nMalvoisie and our Malmsey. Prof. Azevedo (loc. cit.) opines that\nthe date of the wine’s introduction disproves the legend of that\n’maudlin Clarence in his Malmsey butt.’] whose black grape was almost a\nraisin, and a harsh produce like that of the modern Gual, with\ngreat volume and alcoholic strength, but requiring time to make it\npalatable.",
        "The Canaries mostly grew white wines; that is, the liquors were\nfermented without skins and stalks. Thus they did not contain all the\nconstituents of the fruit, and they were inferior in remedial and\nrestorative virtues to red wines. Indeed, a modern authority tells us\nthat none but the latter deserve the name, and that white wines are\nrather grape-ciders than real wines.",
        "The best Tenerife brands were produced on the northern slopes from\nSauzal and La Victoria to Garachico and Ycod de los Vinos. The latter,\nfamed for its malmsey, has lost its vines and kept its name. The\ncultivation extended some 1,500 feet above the sea, and the plant was\ntreated after the fashion of Madeira and Carniola (S. Austria). The\nlatadas, or trellises, varied in height, some being so low that\nthe peasant had to creep under them. All, however, had the same defect:\nthe fruit got the shade and the leaves the sun, unless trimmed away by\nthe cultivator, who was unwilling to remove these lungs in too great\nquantities. The French style, the pruned plant supported by a stake, was\nused only for the old and worn-out, and none dreamt of the galvanised\nwires along which Mr. Leacock, of Funchal, trains his vines. In Grand\nCanary I have seen the grape-plant thrown over swathes of black stone,\nlike those which, bare of fruit, stretch for miles across the fertile\nwastes of the Syrian Haurán. By heat and evaporation the grapes become\nraisins; and, as in Dalmatia, one pipe required as much fruit as\nsufficed for three or four of ordinary.",
        "The favourite of the Canaries is, or was, the vidonia, a juicy\nberry, mostly white, seldom black: the same is the case with the\nmuscadels. The Malvasia is rarely cultivated, as it suffered\ninordinately from the vine-disease. The valuable Verdelho,\npreferred at Madeira, is, or was, a favourite; and there are, or were,\nhalf a dozen others. The vendange usually began in the lowlands\nabout the end of August, and in the uplands a fortnight or three weeks\nlater. The grape was carried in large baskets by men, women, and\nchildren, to the lagar, or wooden press, and was there trodden\ndown, as in Madeira, Austria, and Italy. The Canarians, like other\nneo-Latins an unmechanical race, care little for economising labour. The\nvinification resembled that of the Isle of Wood, with one important\nexception–the stove. This artificial heating to hasten maturity seems\nto have been soon abandoned.",
        "Mr. Vizetelly is of opinion that the pure juice was apt to grow harsh,\nor become ropy, with age. They remedied the former defect by adding a\nlittle gloria, a thin, sweet wine kept in store from the\npreceding vendange; this was done in April or in May, when the\nvintage was received at headquarters. Ropiness was cured by repeated\nrackings and by brandying, eight gallons per pipe being the normal\nratio. That distinguished connoisseur found in an old malmsey of 1859\nall the aroma and lusciousness of a good liqueur; the ’London\nparticular’ of 1865 tasted remarkably soft, with a superior nose; an\n1871-72, made for the Russian market, had an oily richness with a\nconsiderable aroma; an 1872 was mellow and aromatic, and an 1875 had a\ngood vinous flavour.",
        "’Canary’ possessed its own especial charác-ter, as Jonathan says. If it\ndeveloped none of the highest qualities of its successful rivals, it\nbecame, after eight to twelve years’ keeping, a tolerable wine, which\nmany in England have drunk, paying for good madeira. The shorter period\nsufficed to mature it, and it was usually shipped when three to four\nyears old. It kept to advantage in wood for a quarter of a century, and\nin bottle it improved faster. My belief is that the properest use of\nTenerife was to ’lengthen out’ the finer growths. I found Canary bearing\nthe same relation to madeira as marsala bears to sherry: the best\nspecimens almost equalled the second or third-rate madeiras. Moreover,\nthese wines are even more heady and spirituous than those of the\nnorthern island; and there will be greater difficulty in converting them\nto the category vino de pasto, a light dinner-wine.",
        "Before 1810 Tenerife exported her wines not from Santa Cruz, but from\nOrotava, the centre of commerce. Here, since the days of Charles II.,\nthere was an English Factory with thirty to forty British subjects,\nProtestants, under the protection of the Captain-General; and their\ncemetery lay at the west end of El Puerto, whose palmy days were in\n1812-15. The trade was then transferred to the modern capital, where\nthere are, and have been for years, only two English wine-shipping\nfirms, Messieurs Hamilton and Messieurs Davidson. The seniors of both\nfamilies have all passed away; but their sons and grandsons still\ninhabit the picturesque old houses on the ’Marina.’  In 1812-15 the\nannual export of wine was 8,000 to 11,000 pipes. The Peace of 1815 was a\nsevere blow to the trade. Between 1830 and 1840, however, the vintage of\nthe seven chief islands averaged upwards of 46,000; of these Tenerife\nsupplied between 4,000 and 5,000, equivalent to the total produce since\nthe days of the oïdium. In 1852 Admiral Robinson reduced the number of\npipes to 20,000, worth 200,000l. In 1860-65 I saw the grape in a\npiteous plight: the huge bunches were composed of dwarfed and wilted\nberries, furred and cobwebbed with the foul mycelium. The produce fell\nto 100-150 pipes, and at present only some 200 to 300 are exported. The\nPeninsula and the West African coast take the bulk; England and Germany\nranking next, and lastly Spain, which used the import largely in\nmaking-up wines. The islanders now mostly drink the harsh, coarse\nCatalonians; they still, however, make for home consumption a cheap\nwhite wine, which improves with age. It is regretable that fears of the\noïdium and the phylloxera prevent the revival of the industry, for which\nthe Islands are admirably fitted. Potatoes and other produce have also\nsuffered; but that is no obstacle to their being replanted.",
        "I left Santa Cruz and Las Palmas, after two short visits, with the\nconviction that both are on the highway of progress, and much edified by\ntheir contrast with Funchal. The difference is that of a free port and a\nclosed port. In the former there is commercial, industrial, and literary\nactivity: Las Palmas can support two museums. In the latter there is\nneither this, that, nor the other. Madeira also suffers from repressed\nemigration. The Canaries wisely allow their sons to make gold ounces\nabroad for spending at home.",
        "Spain also, a few years ago so backward in the race, is fast regaining\nher place amongst the nations. She is now reaping the benefit of her\ntruly liberal (not Liberal) policy. Such were the abolition of the\nmorgado (primogeniture) in 1834, the closing of the 1,800\nconvents in 1836-37, and the disamortizacion, or suppression of\nChurch property and granting liberty of belief, in 1855. Finally, the\nvigour infused by a short–which will lead to a longer–trial of\ndemocracy and of republican institutions have given her a new life. She\nis no longer the Gallio of the Western world.",
        "THE RUINED RIVER-PORT AND THE TATTERED FLAG.",
        "On the night of January 10 we steamed out of Las Palmas to cover the\nlong line of 940 miles between Grand Canary and Bathurst. The\nA. S. S. generously abandons the monopoly of the Gambia to its rival,\nthe B. and A., receiving in exchange the poor profits of the Isles de\nLos. Consequently the old Company’s ships, when homeward-bound, run\ndirectly from Sierra Leone to Grand Canary, a week’s work of 1,430\nknots.",
        "Hardly had we lost sight of the brown and barren island and Las Palmas\nin her magpie suit, than we ran out of the Brisa Parda, or grey\nnorth-east Trade, into calm and cool Harmatan [Footnote: The word is of\ndisputed origin. Ahalabata, or ahalalata, on the Gold Coast\nis a foreign term denoting the dry norther or north-easter that blows\nfrom January to March or April (Zimmerman). Christalier makes\nharamata, ’Spanish harmatan, an Arabic word.’] weather. We\nbegrudged the voyage this lovely season, which should have been kept for\nthe journey. After the damp warmth of Madeira the still and windless air\nfelt dry, but not too dry; cold, but not too cold; decidedly fresh in\nearly morning, and never warm except at 3 P.M. The sun was pale and\nshorn, as in England, seldom showing a fiery face before 10 A.M. or\nafter 5 P.M. The sea at night appeared slightly milky, like the white\nwaters so often seen off the western coast of India. Every traveller\ndescribes the Harmatan, and most travellers transcribe the errors\ntouching the infusoria and their coats which Ehrenberg found at sea in\nthe impalpable powder near the Cape Verde islands. The dry cold blast is\npurely local, not cosmical. There is a fine reddish-yellow sand in the\nlower air-strata; we see it, we feel it, and we know that it comes from\nthe desert-tracts of northern Africa. The air rises en masse from\nthe Great Sahara; the vacuum is speedily filled by the heavier and\ncooler indraught from the north or south, and the higher strata form the\nupper current flowing from the Equator to the Poles. But ’siliceous\ndust’ will not wholly account for the veiling of the sun and the\nopaqueness of the higher atmosphere. This arises simply from the want of\nhumidity; the air is denser, and there is no vapour to refract and\nreflect the light-rays. Hence the haze which even in England appears to\noverhang the landscape when there is unusually droughty weather; and\nhence, conversely, as all know, the view is clearest before and after\nheavy showers, when the atmosphere is saturated or supersaturated.",
        "On my return in early April we caught the northeast Trades shortly after\nturning Cape Palmas, and kept them till close upon Grand Canary. They\nwere a complete contrast with the Harmatan, the firmament looking\nexceptionally high, and the sun shining hot, while a crisp, steady gale\nmade the ’herds of Proteus’ gambol and disport themselves over the long\nridges thrown up by the cool plain of bright cerulean. The horizon, when\nclear, had a pinkish hue, and near coast and islands puffy folds of\ndazzling white, nearly 5,000 feet high, were based upon dark-grey\nstreaks of cloudland simulating continents and archipelagoes. Within the\ntropics the heavens appear lower, and we never sight blue or purple\nwater save after a tornado. The normal colour is a dirty, brassy\nyellow-brown, here and there transparent, but ever unsightly in the\nextreme. It must depend upon some unexplained atmospheric conditions;\nand the water-aspect is often at its ugliest when the skies are\nclearest. I have often seen the same tints when approaching Liverpool.",
        "Through the Harmatan-haze we failed to sight Cape Juby, opposite\nFuerteventura; and at Santa Cruz I missed Mr. Mackenzie, the energetic\nflooder of the Sahará. He has, they say, given up this impossibility and\nopened a comptoir: its presence is very unpleasant to the French\nmonopolists, who seem to ’monopole’ more every year. South of Juby comes\nhistoric Cape Bojador, the ’Gorbellied,’ and Cabo Blanco, which is to\nnorthern what Cabo Negro is to southern Africa. The sole remarkable\nevents in its life are, firstly, its being named by Ptolemy Granaria\nExtrema, whence the Canarii peoples south-west of the Moroccan Atlas and\nour corrupted ’Canaries;’ and, secondly, its rediscovery by one Gonçalez\nBaldeza in 1440.",
        "On the afternoon of Saturday (January 14) we sighted in the offing the\ntwo paps of Ovedec, or Cabo Verde, the Hesperou Keras, the Hesperium or\nArsenarium Promontorium of Pliny, the trouvaille of Diniz\nFernandez in 1446. The name is sub judice. Some would derive it\nfrom the grassy green slope clad with baobabs (Adansonia\ndigitata), megatherium-like monsters, topping the precipitous\nsea-wall which falls upon patches of yellow sand. Others would borrow it\nfrom the Sargasso (baccifera), Golfão, or Gulf-weed, which here\nbecomes a notable feature. Cape Verde, the Prasum Promontorium of West\nAfrica, is the ’Trafalgar,’ the westernmost projection, of the Dark\nContinent ’fiery yet gloomy;’ measuring 17° 3’ from the meridian of\nGreenwich. The coast is exceedingly dangerous; consequently shipwrecks\nare rare. The owners, as their national wont is, have done their best to\nmake it safe. Two lighthouses to the north of the true Cape mark and\ndefine a long shoal with a heavy break, the Almadies rocks, a ledge\nmostly sunk, but here and there rising above the foam in wicked-looking\ndiabolitos (devilings), or black fangs, of which the largest is\ndie-shaped. A third pharos, also brilliantly whitewashed, crowns the\nCape, and by its side is a lower sea-facing building, the sanatorium;\nfinally, there is a light at the mole-end of Dakar.",
        "Steaming past the Madeleine rocks, here and there capped with green and\nwhitened by sea-fowl, we sight, through an opening in the curtain of\ncoast, the red citadel and the subject town of Goree, the Gibraltar of\nwestern Africa, and the harbour of St. Louis, capital of Senegambia. The\nisland is now the only port, the headquarters having suffered from the\nsand-bar at the mouth of the Senegal. Here our quondam rivals have made\nthe splendid harbour of Dakar, whose jetties accommodate 180,000 tons of\nshipping at the same time. This powerful and warlike colony, distant\nonly twelve hours’ steaming from Bathurst, has her fleet of steamers for\nriver navigation; her Tirailleurs du Sénégal, and her large force of\nfighting native troops. Fortified stations defend the course of the\nriver, even above the falls, from the hostile and treacherous Moors. The\nsubject and protected territories exceed Algeria in extent, and the\nposition will link the French possessions in the Mediterranean with the\nrich mineral lands proposed for conquest in the south.",
        "We English hug to ourselves the idea that the French are bad colonists:\nif so, France, like China and India, is improving at a pace which\npromises trouble. Algeria, Senegambia, and Siam should considerably\nmodify the old judgment. Our neighbours have, and honestly own to, two\ngrand faults–an excessive bureaucracy and a military, or rather a\nmartinet, discipline, which interferes with civil life and which governs\ntoo much. On the other side England rules too little. She is at present\nbetween the two proverbial stools. She has lost the norm of honour,\nAristocracy; and she has lost it for ever. But she has not yet acquired\nthe full strength of democracy. This is part secret of that\ndisorganisation which is causing such wonder upon the continent of\nEurope. Moreover, Colonial England has caught the disease of\nnon-interference and the infection of economy, the spawn of Liberalism;\nwhile her savings, made by starving her establishments, are of the\ncategory popularly described as penny-wise and pound-foolish. France has\nadopted the contrary policy. She spends her money freely in making ports\nand roads and in opening communication through adjacent countries. She\nlately sent a cruiser to Madeira, proposing to connect Dakar by\ntelegraph with the Cape Verde islands. She is assiduous in forming\nfriendly, or rather peaceable, relations with the people. She begins on\nthe right principle by officering her colonies with her best men, naval\nand military. In England anyone is good enough for West Africa. She\nimpresses the natives, before beginning to treat, by an overwhelming\ndisplay of force; and, if necessary, by hard knocks. She educates the\nchildren of the chiefs, and compels all her lieges, under a penalty, to\nlearn, and if possible to speak, French. So far from practising\nnon-interference, she allows no one to fight but herself. This\nimperious, warlike, imperial attitude is what Africa wants. It reverses\nour Quaker-like ’fad’ for peace. We allow native wars to rage ad\nlibitum even at Porto Loko, almost within cannon-shot of Sierra\nLeone. On the Gambia River the natives have sneeringly declared that\nthey will submit to the French, who are men, but not to us, who are\n------. Later still, the chiefs of Futa-Jalon went, not to London, but\nto Paris.",
        "In 1854 France commenced a new and systematic course of colonial\npolicy. She first beat the Pulos (Fulahs), once so bold, and then she\norganised and gave flags to them. She checked, with a strong hand, the\nattacks of the Moors upon the gum-gatherers of the Sahará. And now,\nafter drawing away from us the Gambia trade, she has begun a railway\nintended to connect the Senegal with the Niger and completely to\noutflank us. This line will annex the native regions behind our\nsettlements, and make Bathurst and Sierra Leone insignificant\ndependencies upon the continent of Gallic rule. The total distance is at\nleast 820 miles, and the whole will be guarded by a line of forts. It\nbegins with a section of 260 kilometres, which will transport valuable\ngoods now injured by ass and camel-carriage. The natives, wearied with\nincessant petty wars, are ready to welcome the new comers. The western\nSúdán, or Niger-basin, has a population estimated at forty millions,\nready, if a market be opened, to flock to it with agricultural and\nindustrial products, including iron, copper, and gold. Meanwhile the\nJoliba (Black Water), with the Benuwe and other tributaries, offers a\nready-made waterway for thousands of miles. Sierra Leone lies only 400\nmiles, less than half, from the Niger; but what would the Colonial\nOffice say if a similar military line were proposed? Nor can we console\nourselves by the feeble excuse that Senegal has a climate superior to\nthat of our ’pest-houses.’ On the contrary, she suffers severely from\nyellow fever, which has never yet visited the British Gold Coast. Her\nmortality is excessive, but she simply replaces her slain. She has none\nof that mawkish, hysterical humanitarianism which of late years has\nbecome a salient feature in our campaigning. During the Ashanti affair\nthe main object seems to have been, not the destruction of the enemy,\nbut to save as many privates as possible from ague and fever, sunstroke\nand dysentery.",
        "Ninety miles beyond Cape Verde placed us in the Gambia waters, off the\nlands of the Guinea region. I will not again attempt a history of the\ndisputed word which Barbot derives from Ginahoa, the first negro region\nvisited by the Portuguese; others from Ghana, the modern Kano; from the\nJenneh or Jinne of Mungo Park; from Jenna, a coast-town once of note,\ngoverned by an officer under the ’King’ of Gambia-land, and, in fine,\nfrom the Italian Genoa.",
        "The s.s. Senegal spent the night of the 14th on the soft and\nslippery mud, awaiting the dawn. What can the Hydrographic Department of\nthe Admiralty be doing? What is the use of the three cruisers that still\nrepresent the old ’Coffin Squadron’? This coast has not had a survey\nsince 1830, yet it changes more or less every year, and half a century\nmakes every map and plan obsolete. But perhaps it would be wrong to risk\nseamen’s lives by exposure in open boats to ’insolation,’ showers, and\nsurf.",
        "From sunrise the sea had changed its Harmatan-grey for a dull, muddy,\ndirty green; and the leadsman, who is now too civilised to ’sing out’ in\nthe good old style, calmly announced that the channel was\nshallowing. ’Gambia,’ or ’Gambi,’ the Gamboa and Gambic of Barbot\n(Chapter VII.), is said to mean clear water, here a perfect misnomer; it\nis miry as the Mersey. The ’molten gold of the Gambia River’ is only the\nfine phrase of some poetic traveller. Low land loomed on both sides,\nwith rooty and tufted mangroves, apparently based upon the waves,\nshowing that we approached an estuary, which soon narrowed from thirty\nmiles to seven and to two. Three buoys, the outermost red, then the\n’fairway’ with chequers and cage, and lastly white without cage, all at\na considerable distance off the land, marked the river-bar, and\npresently a black pilot came on board from his cutter. We made some\neasting running along shore, and gave a wide berth to the Horseshoe Bank\nand St. Mary’s shoal portwards, to African Knoll and Middle Ground\nstarboardwards, and to a crowd of other pleasant patches, where the\nwater was dancing a breakdown in the liveliest way.",
        "As we drew in shore the now burning sun shone with a sickly African heat\nthrough the scirocco-clouds and the thick yellow swamp-reek. ’It will be\nworse when we land,’ said the normal Job’s comforter. Six knots to\nstarboard, (west), on high and healthy Cape St. Mary, rose a whitewashed\nbuilding from a dwarf red cliff. To port on the river’s proper right\nbank (east) lay Fort Bullen, an outpost upon a land-tongue, dead-green\nas paint, embosomed in tall bentangs, or bombax-trees (Pullom\nCeiba). This ’silk-cotton-tree’ differs greatly in shape from its\ncongener in Eastern Africa. The bole bears sharp, broad-based thorns;\nthe wings or flying buttresses are larger; several trunks rarely\nanastomose; the branches seldom stand out horizontally, nor are the\nleaves disposed in distinct festoons. It is, however, a noble growth,\nuseful for shade and supplying a soft wood for canoes and stuffing for\npillows. Fort Bullen, about one hour’s row from Bathurst, formerly\nlodged a garrison of seventeen men under the ’Commandant and Governor of\nthe Queen’s Possessions in the Barra Country.’ Now the unwholesome site\nhas been abandoned.",
        "The island and station of St. Mary, Bathurst, of old a graveyard, now\nstart up to starboard. The site was chosen apparently for its superior\ndevelopment of mud and mangrove, miasma and malaria. It is an island\nwithin an island. St. Mary the Greater is the northernmost of that mass\nof riverine holms and continental islands which, formed by the Cachéo\nand other great drains, extends south to the Rio Grande. Measuring some\ntwenty miles from north to south, by six from east to west, it is\nembraced by the two arms of the Gambia delta, and is marked in old maps\nas the Combo, Forni, and Felúp country. St. Mary the Less, upon which\nstands the settlement facing east, is bounded eastward by the main mouth\nand westward by Oyster Creek, a lagoon-like branch: it is a mere\nsand-patch of twenty-one square miles, clothed by potent heats and\nflooding rains with a vivid and violent vegetation. Water is found\neverywhere three feet below the surface, but it is bad and\nbrackish. There is hardly any versant or shed; in places the land sinks\nbelow the water-level; and, despite the excellent brick sewers, the\nshowers prefer to sop and sod the soil. And, lest the island should be\nbodily carried away by man, there is a penalty for removing even a\npailful of sand from the beach.",
        "Bathurst was unknown in the days of Mungo Park, when traders ran up\nstream to Jilifri, nearly opposite Fort James, and to Pisania, the end\nof river-navigation. St. Mary’s Island, together with British Combo,\nAlbreda, and the land called the ’Ceded,’ or ’English Mile,’ were bought\nfrom the Mandenga chief of the Combo province. First christened\nSt. Leopold, and then Bathurst, after the minister of that name, the\nactual town owes its existence to an order issued by Sir Charles\nMacarthy. That ill-starred Governor of Sierra Leone (1814-24) is still\nremembered in Ashanti and on the Gold Coast: he is immortalised by a\npestiferous island in the Upper Gambia well described by Winwood\nReade. The settlement, designed for the use of liberated Africans, was\nbuilt in 1816 by Lieutenant-Colonel Brereton and by Captain Alexander\nGrant. In 1821 it was made, like the Gold Coast, a dependency of Sierra\nLeone, whose jurisdiction, after the African Company was abolished in\n1820,",
        "[Footnote: The first African Company was established by Queen Elizabeth,\nand in 1688 was allowed to trade with Guinea. The Royal African Company,\nor Guinea Company of Royal Adventurers of England trading to Africa, was\nincorporated under Charles II. on January 20, 1663. A third was patented\non September 27, 1672. The ’African Company’ (1722-24) was not allowed\nto interfere with ’interlopers.’  On May 7,1820, it was abolished, after\nbankruptcy, and its possessions passed over to the Crown.]",
        "extended from N. lat. 20° to S. lat. 20°. I found it an independent\ngovernment, one of four, in 1860 to 1865. In 1866 it again passed under\nthe rule of Sierra Leone; in 1874 this ill-advised measure was\nwithdrawn, and the Gambia was placed under an Administrator and a\nLegislative Council, the former subject to the Governor-in-Chief of\nSierra Leone. A score of years ago it was garrisoned by some 300 men of\nthe West African Corps. Now it is reduced to 100 armed policemen: the\nGambia militia, composed of the Combo and Macarthy’s Island forces, is\nnever called out. The population of the twenty-one square miles is given\nby Whittaker for 1881 as 14,150, including 105 whites. The Wesleyans\nhere, as everywhere, preponderating on the Coast, number 1,405 souls;\nthe Catholics 500, and the Episcopalians 200.",
        "Another half-hour placed before us Bathurst in full view. The first\nsalient point is the graveyard, where the station began and where the\nstationed end. Wags declare that the first question is, ’Have you seen\nour burial-ground?’ A few tomb-stones, mostly without inscriptions, are\nscattered so near the shore that corpses and coffins have been washed\naway by the waves. If New Orleans be a normal ’wet grave,’ this\neverywhere save near the sea is dry with a witness, the depth and\nlooseness of the sand making the excavation a crumbling hole. Four\ngovernors, a list greatly to be prolonged, ’lie here interred.’ But\nmatters of climate are becoming too serious for over-attention to such\nplaces or subjects.",
        "The first aspect of this pest-house from afar is not unpleasant. A long\nline of scattered houses leads to the mass of the settlement, faced by\nits Marine Parade, and the tall trees give it a home-look; some have\ncompared the site with ’parts of the park at Cheltenham.’  At a nearer\nview the town of some 5,000 head suggests the idea of a small European\nwatering-place. The execrable position has none of those undulations\nwhich make heaps of men’s homes picturesque; everything is low, flat,\nand straight-lined as a yard of pump-water. The houses might be those of\nByculla, Bombay; in fact, they date from the same epoch. They are\nexcellent of their kind, large uncompact piles of masonry,\nglistening-white or dull-yellow, with blistered paint, and slates,\ntiles, or shingles, which last curl up in the sun like feathers. A\nnearer glance shows the house-walls stained and gangrened with rot and\nmildew, the river-floods often shaking hands with the rains in the\nground-floors. The European ends in beehive native huts, rising from the\nswamp and sand; and these gradually fine off and end up-stream, becoming\nsmall by degrees and hideously less.",
        "Bathurst has one compensating feature, the uncommon merit of an\nesplanade; the noble line of silk-cotton trees separating houses from\nriver is apparently the only flourishing item. We remark that while some\nof these giants are clad in their old leaves others are bright green\nwith new foliage, while others are bare and broomy as English woods in\nmidwinter. They are backed by a truly portentous vegetation of red and\nwhite mangroves, palms, plantains, and baobabs, rank guinea-grass\nfilling up every gap with stalks and blades ten feet tall.",
        "Nor was the scene in the river-harbour at all more lively. The old\nAlbert, of Nigerian fame, has returned to mother Earth; but we\nstill note H.M.S. Dover, a venerable caricature, with funnel long\nand thin, which steams up stream when not impotent–her chronic\ncondition. There are two large Frenchmen loading ground-nuts, but ne’er\nan Englishman. The foreshore is defaced by seven miserable wharves,\nshaky mangrove-piles, black with age and white with oystershells, driven\ninto the sand and loosely planked over. There is an eighth, the\ngunpowder pier, on the north face of the island; and we know by its\ndilapidation that it is Government property. These stages are intended\nnot for landing–oh, no!–but only for loading ships; stairs are\nwanting, and passengers must be carried ashore ’pick-a-back.’ The\nlabourers are mainly, if not wholly, ’Golah’ women of British Combo,\nwhose mates live upon the proceeds of their labours. To-day being\nSunday, the juvenile piscators of Bathurst muster strong upon the piers,\nand no policeman bids them move on.",
        "When the mail-bags were ready, we received a visit from the black\nhealth-officer, and we reflected severely on the exceeding ’cheek’ of\ninspecting, as a rule, new comers from old England at this yellow Home\nof Pestilence. But in the healthy time of the year we rarely see the\nlistless, emaciated whites with skins stained by unoxygenised carbon, of\nwhom travellers tell. Despite the sun, all the Bathurstians save the\nGovernment officials–now few, too few–flocked on board. Mail-days are\nhere, as in other places down-coast, high days and holidays. But times\nare changed, and the ruined river-port can no longer afford the old\ntraditional hospitality.",
        "Cameron and I landed under Brown’s Wharf, the southernmost pier opposite\nthe red roof and the congeries of buildings belonging to the late\nproprietor. We then walked up the High Street, or esplanade, which is\nopen to the river except where the shore is cumbered with boats, hides,\nlumber, and beach-negroes. This is a kind of open-air market where men\nand women sit in the shade, spinning, weaving, and selling fruits and\nvegetables with one incessant flux of tongue. Here, too, amongst the\nheaps, and intimately mixed with the naked infantry, stray small goats,\npretty and deer-shaped, and gaunt pigs, sharp-snouted and long-legged as\nthe worst Irisher.",
        "Several thoroughfares, upper and lower, run parallel with the river; all\nare connected, like a chess-board, by cross-lanes at right angles, and\ntheir grass-grown centres are lined by open drains of masonry, now\nbone-dry. The pavement is composed of stone and dust, which during the\nrains becomes mud; the trottoirs are in some places of brick, in\nothers of asphalte, in others of cracked slabs. Mostly, however, we walk\non sand and gravel, which fills our boots with something harder than\nunboiled peas. The multiplicity of useless walls, the tree-clumps, and\nthe green sward faintly suggested memories of a semi-deserted\nsingle-company station in Western India; and the decayed, tumble-down\nlook of all around was a deadly-lively illustration of the Hebrew\nIchabod.",
        "I passed, with a sense of profound sadness, the old Commissariat\nquarters, now degraded to a custom-house. The roomy, substantial edifice\nof stone and lime, with large, open verandahs, here called piazzas,\nlofty apartments, galleries, terraced roofs, and, in fact, everything an\nAfrican house should have, still stood there; but all shut up, as if the\nantique domus were in mourning for the past. What Homeric feeds,\nwhat noctes coenoeque deorum, we have had there in joyous past\ntimes! But now that most hospitable of West-Coasters, Commissary Blanc,\nhas been laid in the sandy cemetery; and where, oh! where are the rest\nof the jovial crew, Martin and Sherwood? I found only one relic of the\nbygone–and a well-favoured relic he is–Mr. W. N. Corrie, with whom to\nexchange condolences and to wail over the ruins.",
        "Passing the post-office and the French, Spanish, Portuguese, and\nAmerican consulates, poor copies of the dear old Commissariat, we halted\noutside at Mr. Goddard’s, and obtained from Mr. R. E. Cole a copy of his\nlecture, ’The River Gambia,’ read at York, September 1881. It gave me\npleasure to find in it, ’The man that is wanted throughout the West\nCoast of Africa is not the negro, but the Chinaman; and should he ever\nturn his steps in its direction he will find an extensive and\nremunerating field for the exercise of his industry and intelligence.’",
        "We then turned our attention from the town to the townspeople. They have\nnot improved in demeanour during the last twenty years. Even then the\n’liberateds’ and ’recaptives,’ chiefly Akus and Ibos, had begun the\n’high jinks,’ which we shall find at their highest in Sierra Leone. They\nhad organised ’Companies,’ the worst of trade-unions, elected headmen,\nindulged in strikes, and more than once had come into serious collision\nwith the military. The Mandengas, whom Mungo Park calls Mandingoes and\ncharacterises as a ’wild, sociable, and obliging people,’ soon waxed\nturbulent and unruly. This is to be expected; a race of warriors must be\ngoverned by the sword. They would prefer for themselves military law to\nall the blessings of a constitution or a plébiscite. But philanthropy\nwills otherwise, and in these days the English authorities do not keep\nup that state whose show secures the respect of barbarians. Where the\nGovernor walks about escortless, like a private individual, he must\nexpect to be ’treated as such.’",
        "There is no difficulty in distinguishing at first sight Moslem from\nKafir. Besides the gypsy-like Pulo, the ’brown race,’ our older Fúlahs\nand Fellalahs, whose tongue is said to be a congener of the Nubian; and\nthe wild, half-naked pagan Jolu, the principal tribes, are two, the\nMandengas and the Wólofs. The former, whom Europeans divide into the\nMarabút, who does not drink, and the Soninki, who does, inhabit a\ntriangle, its base being the line from the south of the Senegal to the\nGambia River, and its apex the Niger; it has even extended to near\nTin-Bukhtu (the Well of Bukhtu), our Timbuctoo. In old Mohammedan works\ntheir territory is called Wángara. This race of warmen and horsemen\nsurprisingly resembles the Somal, who hold the same parallels of\nlatitude in Eastern Africa, as to small heads, semi-Caucasian features,\nAsiatic above the nose-tip and African below; tall lithe figures, high\nshoulders, and long limbs, especially the forearm.",
        "There is the usual Negro-land variety in the picturesque toilette; no\ntwo men are habited alike. A Phrygian bonnet, Glengarry or Liberty-cap\nof dark, indigo-dyed cotton, and sometimes a Kan-top or ear-calotte of\nIndia and Hausa-land, surmount their clean-shaven heads. For this they\nsubstitute, when travelling, ’country umbrellas,’ thatches of plaited\npalm-leaves in umbrella-shape; further down coast we shall find the\nregular sun-hat of Madeira, with an addition of loose straw-ends which\nwould commend itself to Ophelia. The decent body-garb is a kamís,\na nightgown of long-cloth, and wide, short drawers; the whole is covered\nwith a sleeveless abá, or burnous, and sometimes with a\nhalf-sleeved caftan–here termed ’tobe’–garnished with a huge\nbreast-pocket. It is generally indigo-stained, with marblings or\nbroad-narrow stripes of lighter tint than the groundwork. An essential\narticle, hung round the neck or slung to the body, is the grigri,\nta’awíz, or talisman, a Koranic verse or a magic diagram enclosed\nin a leathern roll or in a flat square. Of these prophylactics, which\nanswer to European medals and similar fetish, a ’serious person’ will\nwear dozens; and they are held to be such ’strong medicine’ that even\npagans will barter or pay for them. Blacksmiths, weavers, and spinners\nwork out of doors. Contrary to the general Moslem rule, these Mandengas\nhonour workers in iron and leather, and the king’s blacksmith and\ncobbler are royal councillors.",
        "Some of the motley crowd sit reading what the incurious stranger tells\nyou is ’the Alcoran;’ they are perusing extracts and prayers written in\nthe square, semi-Cufic Maghrabi character, which would take a learned\nMeccan a week to decipher. Others, polluted by a license which calls\nitself liberty, squat gambling shamelessly with pegs stuck in the\nground. Now and then fighting-looking fellows ride past us, with the\nArabic ring-bit and the heavy Mandenga demi-pique. The nags are ponies\nsome ten hands high, ragged and angular, but hardy and sure-footed. As\nmost of the equines in this part of Africa, they are, when well fed,\nintensely vicious and quarrelsome. Like the Syrians, they have only\nthree paces, the walk, the lazy loping canter, and the brisk hard\ngallop; the trot is a provisional passage from slow to fast. Yet with\nall their shortcomings I should prefer them to the stunted bastard barb,\nlocally called an Arab and priced between 20l. and 40l.\nThe latter generally dies early from chills and checked\nperspiration, which bring on ’loin-disease,’ paralysis of the\nhind-quarters, or from a fatal swelling of the stomach, the result of\nbad forage. Most of the men carried knives, daggers, and crooked swords\nin curious leather scabbards. This practice should never be permitted in\nAfrica. Natives entering a station should be compelled to leave their\nweapons with the policeman at the nearest guard-house.",
        "The Wólofs, a name formerly written Joloff, also dwell in Senegambia,\nbetween the Senegal and the Gambia, and their habitat is divided into\nsundry petty kingdoms. As early as 1446 they were known to the\nPortuguese, and one Bemoy, of princely house, soon afterwards visited\nLisbon, was baptised, and did homage to D. João II. More like the\nAbyssinians than their Mandenga neighbours, they are remarkable for good\nlooks, pendent ringlets, and tasteful dress and decorations. ’Black but\ncomely,’ with long, oval faces, finely formed features, straight noses\nand glossy jetty skins, in character they are brave and dignified, and\nthey are distinctly negroids, not negroes. This small maritime tribe,\nwho make excellent sailors, is interesting and civilisable; many have\nbeen Christianised, especially by the Roman Catholic missioners. The\nonly native tongue spoken by European residents at Bathurst is the\nWólof. As M. Dard remarks in his ’Grammaire Wolof,’ the [Footnote: He\nwas Instituteur de l’École Wolof-Française du Sénégal, and published in\n1826. It is still said that no one will speak Wolof like him, the result\nof the new régíme of compulsory French instruction. I printed 226\nof his proverbs in Wit and Wisdom from West Africa (London,\nTinsleys, 1865). It is curious to compare them with those of the pagan\nnegroes further south.]",
        "language is widely spread: Mungo Park often uses expressions which he\ndeems Mandenga, but which belong to the ’Jews of West Africa,’ as the\nWólofs are sometimes called, their extensive commercial dealings between\nthe coast and the western Sudan being the only point of likeness. For\ninstance, in the tale of ’poor Nealee’ the cry ’Kang-tegi!’ (’Cut her\nthroat!’) is the Wólof ’Kung-akateke!’ (’Let her head be cut off!’), and\n’Nealee affeeleeata!’ (’Nealee is lost!’)  appears equally corrupted by\nauthor or printer from ’Nealu afeyleata!’ (’Nealee breathes no more!’)",
        "Pursuing our peregrinations, we reach No. 1 Fort, at the northern angle\nof the town, north-eastern corner of the islet St. Mary the Less. This\nold round battery is surmounted by three 32-pounders, en\nbarbette, with iron carriages and traversing platforms, but without\nracers: a single 7-inch shell would smash the whole affair. Thence we\nbent westward and passed the once neat ’Albert Market’ with its metal\nroof, built in 1854-56 by Governor Luke O’Connor and Isaac Bage. We did\nnot enter; the place swarms with both sexes in blue: African indigo\nyields a charming purple, but one soon learns to prefer white\nclothing. Nor need I describe the stuff exposed for sale: there will be\na greater variety at Sierra Leone.",
        "Passing the market we come upon the engineer’s yard, which a hand-bill\nsternly forbids us to enter. It contains a chapel, where the\nRev. Mr. Nicol officiates: this loose box is more hideous than anything\nI have yet seen, a perfect study of architectural deformity. The\ncracked bell and the nasal chant, at times rising to a howl as of\nanguish, were completely in character. As the service ended issued a\nstream of worshippers, mostly women, attired in costumes which will be\nnoticed further on; most of them led negrolings suggesting the dancing\ndog. Meanwhile the police, armed only with side-arms, sword-bayonets,\nand looking more like Sierra Leone convicts reformed and uniformed,\nfollowed a band composed of drums, cymbals, and a haughty black\nsergeant, a mulatto noncommissioned, bringing up the rear. They went\nround and round the barrack square, a vast space occupied chiefly by\ngrass and drains; in the back-ground is the large jaundiced building\nupon whose clock-tower floated, or rather depended, the flag of\nSt. George. The white building by its side is the Colonial Hospital: it\nhas also seen ’better days.’",
        "We resolved to call upon Mr. Administrator V. S. Goulsbury, M.D. and\nC.M.G. He had lately been subjected to an attack, of course anonymous,\nin the ’African Times;’ an attack the more ungentlemanly and cowardly\nbecause it reflected upon his private not public life; and consequently\nhe could neither notice it nor answer it, nor bring an action for\nlibel. This scandalous print, which has revived the old ’Satirist’ in\nits most infamous phase, habitually inserts any tissue of falsehoods\nsuggested to proceed from a ’native,’ an ’African,’ a ’negro,’ and\ncarefully writes down to the lowest level of its readers. It attracts\nattention by the cant of charity, and shows its devotion to ’the Bible,\nand nothing but the Bible,’ by proving that the earth, having ’four\ncorners,’ is flat, and that the sun, which once ’stood still,’ must move\nround its parasite. The manner of this pestilence is right worthy of its\nmatter, and the style would be scouted in a decent housekeeper’s\nroom. All well-meaning men, of either colony, declare that it has done\nmore harm in West Africa than the grossest abuse yet written. Its tactic\nis to set black against white, to pander for the public love of scandal,\nand systematically to abuse all the employés of Government. And the sole\nobject of this vile politic, loudly proclaimed to be philanthropic and\nnegrophile, has been low lucre–in fact, an attempt to butter its bread\nwith ’black brother.’",
        "We inspected the second or western fort, a similar battery of six\n32-pounders, with two 10-inch mortars, fit only to pound ’fúfú,’ or\nbanana-paste; add a single brass field-piece, useful as a morning and\nevening gun for this highly military station. Then we came to Government\nHouse, apparently deserted, flying a frayed and tattered white and blue\nflag, which might have been used on board H.M.S. Dover, but which\nought to have been supplanted on shore by a Union Jack. After waiting a\nquarter of an hour, we managed, with the assistance of a sentinel, whose\nfeet were in slippers and whose artillery carbine was top-heavy with a\nfixed sword-bayonet, to arouse a negro servant, by whom we sent in our\ncards to H.E. the Administrator. An old traveller on the Gold Coast, and\nlately returned from a long expedition into the interior, [Footnote:\nGambia: Expedition to the Upper Gambia. London: Eyre and\nSpottiswoode, 1882.] he had much to tell us. His knowledge of\nAshanti-land, however, induced him to place the Kong Mountains in that\nmeridian too far north; he held the distance from the seaboard to be at\nleast 500 miles. But he quite agreed with us about the necessity of\nimporting Chinese coolies. Here no free man works. The people say, ’When\na slave gets his liberty he will drink rainwater’–rather than draw it\nfrom a well. The chief cargo of the S.S. Senegal was Chinese\nrice, when almost every acre of the lower Gambia would produce a cereal\nsuperior in flavour and bolder in grain. Hands, however, are wanting;\nand all the women are employed in loading and unloading ships.",
        "The Residency is a fine large building in an advanced stage of\ndecomposition; the glorious vegetation around it–cotton-trees,\ncaoutchouc-figs, and magnificent oleanders–making the pile look grimmer\nand grislier. And here we realised, to the fullest extent, how\nthoroughly ruined is the hapless settlement. The annual income is about\n24,500l., the expenditure is 20,000l. in round numbers,\nand the economies are said to reach 25,000l. This sum is\nforwarded to the colonial chest, instead of being expended in local\nimprovements; and, practically, when some petty war-storm breaks it is\nwasted like water. The local officials are not to be blamed for this\nmiserable system, this niggardly colonial policy of the modern\neconomical school, which contrasts so poorly with the lavish republican\nexpenditure in French Senegambia. They have, to their honour be it said,\noften protested against the taxes raised from struggling merchants and a\nstarveling population, poor as Hindûs, being expended upon an ’imperial\npolicy.’ But economy is the order of the day at home, and an\nAdministrator inclined to parsimony gladly seizes the opportunity of\npleasing his ’office.’ The result is truly melancholy. I complained in\n1862 that the ’civil establishment’ at Bathurst cost 7,075l. I\nnow complain that it has been reduced to 2,600l. [Footnote:\nAdministrator = 1,300l;.; Chief Magistrate = 600l.;\nCollector and Treasurer = 700l. Thus there is no Colonial\nSecretary, and, curious to say, no Colonial Chaplain. I formerly\nrecommended the establishment to be reduced by at least one-half, and\nthat half to be far better paid (Wanderings in West Africa,\ni. 182).] The whole establishment is starved; decay appears in every\noffice, public and private; and ruin is writ large upon the whole\nstation. An Englishman who loves his country must blush when he walks\nthrough Bathurst. Even John Bull would be justified in wishing that he\nhad been born a Frenchman in West Africa.",
        "We returned to the s.s. Senegal anything but edified; and there\nanother displeasure awaited us. Our gallant captain must have known that\nhe could not load and depart that day. Yet, diplomatically mysterious,\nhe would not say so. Consequently we missed a visit to Cape St. Mary,\nthe breezy cliff of which I retain the most agreeable memory. The\nscenery had appeared to me positively beautiful after the foul swamps of\nSt. Mary’s Island;–stubbles of Guinea-corn, loved by quails; a velvety\nexpanse of green grass sloping inland, with here and there a goodly\npalmyra grander than the columns of Ba’albek; palms necklaced with\nwine-calabashes, and a grove of baobab and other forest trees cabled\nwith the most picturesque llianas, where birds of gorgeous plume sit and\nsing. We could easily have hired hammocks or horses, or, these failing,\nhave walked the distance, six or seven miles. True, Oyster Creek, the\nshallow western outlet of the Gambia, has still a ferry: a bridge was\nlately built, but it fell before it was finished. It would, however,\nhave been pleasurable to pass a night away from the fever-haunts of\nBathurst.",
        "During one of my many visits to Bathurst I resolved to inspect old Fort\nJames: one thirsts for a bit of antiquity in these African lands, so\nbare of all but modern ruins. Like Bance Island, further south, it is\nthe parent of the modern settlement; and so far it has the ’charm of\norigin.’ My companion was Captain Philippi, then well known at Lagos:\nthe last time we met was unexpectedly at Solingen. A boat with four\nKrumen was easily found; but our friends warned us that the\nascensus would be easy and the descensus the reverse; the\nlatter has sometimes taken a day and a night.",
        "The Gambia River here opens its mouth directly to the north; and, after\na great elbow, assumes its normal east-west course. We ran before a\nnine-knot breeze, and shortly before noon, after two hours’ southing, we\nwere off the half-way house, reef-girt Dog Island, and Dog Point, in the\nBarra country. The dull green stream sparkled in the sun, and the fringe\nof mangroves appeared deciduous: some trees were bare, as if dead;\nothers were clothed with bright foliage. Presently we passed British\nAlbreda, where our territory now ends. This small place has made a fuss\nin its day. It was founded by the French in 1700 as a dependency of\nGoree, and it carried on a slave-trade highly detrimental to English\ninterests. In 1783 the owners had abandoned all right to its occupation,\nand in 1858 they ceded it to their English rivals. The landing is bad,\nespecially when the miry ebb-tide is out. The old village of the French\ncompany was reduced when we visited it to a few huts and two whitewashed\nand red-roofed houses, occupied by a Frenchwoman in native dress and by\nan English subject, Mr. Hughes. The latter did the honours of the place\nand showed us the only ’punkah’ at that time known to the West African\ncoast.",
        "From Dog Island we bent to the east and passed the Jilifri or Grilofre\nvillage, in the Badibu country, a place well known during the days of\nPark. Then bending south-east, after a total of four hours, covering\nseventeen to eighteen knots, we landed upon James Island, the site of\nFort James. The scrap of ground has a history. First the Portuguese here\nbuilt a factory: Captain Jobson found this fact to his cost when (1621)\nhe sailed up in search of gold to Satico, then the last point of\nnavigation. A few words in the native dialects–’alcalde,’ for\ninstance–preserve the memory of the earliest owners. It passed\nalternately into the hands of the Dutch, French, and English, who\nexchanged some shrewd blows upon the matter of possession. In 1695 it\nwas destroyed by M. de Gennes, and was rebuilt by the Royal African\nCompany, which had monopolised the traffic. It fell again in 1702 to\nCapitaine de la Roque, and cost the conqueror his life. In 1709 it was\nattacked for the third time by M. Parent, commanding four privateering\nfrigates. About 1730 we have from Mr. Superintendent Francis Moore a\nnotice of it amongst the Company’s establishments on the Gambia\nRiver. The island is described as being situated in mid-stream, here\nthree to four miles broad, thirty miles from the mouth: the extent was\n200 yards long by fifty broad. The factory had a governor and a\ndeputy-governor, two officers, eight factors, thirteen writers, two\ninferior attendants, and thirty-two negro servants. The force consisted\nof a company of soldiers, besides armed sloops and shallops. Compare the\nsame with our starved establishment at the Ruined River-port! In other\nparts of the Gambia valley eight subordinate comptoirs, including\nJilifri or Gilofre, traded for hides and bees’-wax, ivory, slaves, and\ngold. When Mungo Park travelled (1795-97) the opening of the European\ntrade had reduced its exports to a gross value of 20,000l., in\nthree ships voyaging annually. After the African Company was abolished\n(1820) it passed over to the Crown, and the station was transferred to\nits graveyard, Sainte-Marie de Bathurst. Barbot [Footnote:\nLib. i. chap. vii., A Description of the Coasts of North and South\nGuinea, &c., in 1700. Printed in Churchill’s Collection. Also his\nSupplement, ibid. pp. 426-26.] tells us that Fort James was\nfounded (1664), under the names of the Duke of York and the Royal\nAfrican Company, by Commodore Holmes when expeditioning against the\nHollanders in North and South Guinea. It was the head-centre of trade\nand its principal defence. But, he says, the occupants were obliged to\nfetch fresh water from either bank. Had the cistern and the\npowder-magazine been bomb-proof, and drink as well as meat stored\nquant. suff., the fort would have been ’in a manner impregnable,\nif well defended by a suitable garrison.’ The latter in his day\nconsisted of sixty to seventy whites, besides ’Gromettoes,’ free black\nsepoys.",
        "This quasi-venerable site is a little holm a hundred yards in diameter,\nsomewhat larger than the many which line the river’s western bank. We\nfound its stony shingle glazed with a light-green sediment, which\nforbade bathing and which suggested fever. The material is conglomerate,\nfine and coarse, in an iron-reddened matrix; hence old writers call it a\n’sort of gravelly rock, a little above water.’ Salsolaceæ tapestry the\nshore, and fig-trees and young calabashes spring from the stone: the\nground is strewn with white shells, tiles, bricks and iridescent\nbottles–the invariable concomitants and memorials of civilisation. The\nmasonry, lime and ashlar, is excellent, but time and the portentous\ngrowth of the tropics have cracked and fissured the walls. Masses of\nmasonry are fallen, and others are assuming the needle-shape. The great\nquadrangle had lozenge-shaped bastions at each end, then lined with good\nbrick-work: the outliers, which run round the river-holm, were three\nhorseshoe redoubts ’with batteries along the palisades from one to\nanother.’ Four old iron guns remained out of a total of sixty to seventy\npieces. The features were those of the ancient slave-barracoon\n–dwelling-houses, tanks and cisterns, magazines, stores,\nand powder-room, all broken by the treasure-hunter.",
        "The return to Bathurst was a bitter draught. We had wind and water\nagainst us, and the thick mist prevented our taking bearings. Hungry,\nthirsty, weary, cross, and cramped, we reached the steamer at 5 A.M.,\nand slept spitefully as long as we could.",
        "The last displeasure of my latest visit to Bathurst was the crowd of\nnative passengers, daddy, mammy, and piccaninny, embarking for Sierra\nLeone, and the host of friends that came to bid them good-bye. They did\nnot fail to abscond with M. Colonna’s pet terrier and with the steward’s\npotatoes: no surveillance can keep this long-fingered lot from picking\nand stealing. It is a political as well as a social mistake to take\nnegro first-class passengers. A ruling race cannot be too particular in\nsuch matters, and the white man’s position on the Coast would be\nimproved were the black man kept in his proper place. A kind of\nfirst-class second-class might be invented for them. Nothing less\npleasant than their society. The stewards have neglected to serve soup\nto some negro, who at every meal has edged himself higher up the table,\nand whose conversation consists of whispering into the ear of a black\nneighbour, with an occasional guffaw like that of the ’laughing\njackass.’",
        "’I say, daddee, I want my soop. All de passenger he drink ’im\nsoop; me no drink my soop. What he mean dis palaver?’",
        "The sentence ends in a scream; the steward smiles, and the\nfirst-class resumes–",
        "’Ah, you larf. And what for you larf? I no larf, I no drinkee soop!’",
        "Here the dialogue ends, and men confess by their looks that travelling\nsometimes does throw us into the strangest society.",
        "Even in Sierra Leone, where the negro claims to be civilised, a dusky\nbelle, after dropping her napkin at a Government House dinner, has been\nheard to say to her neighbour, ’Please, Mr. Officer-man, pick up my\ntowel.’ The other day a dark dame who missed her parasol thus addressed\nH.E.: ’Grovernah! me come ere wid my umbrellah. Where he be,\nmy umbrellah Give me my umbrelláh: no go widout my\numbrelláh.’",
        "For our black and brown passengers, fore and aft, there is a graduated\nand descending scale of terminology: 1. European, that is, brought up in\nEngland; 2. Civilised man; 3. African; 4. Man of colour, the ’cullered\npussun’ of the United States; 5. Negro; 6. Darkey; and 7. Nigger, which\nhere means slave. All are altogether out of their assiettes. At\nhome they will eat perforce cankey, fufu, kiki, and bad fish, washing\nthem down with mimbo, bamboo-wine, and pitto, hopless beer,\nthe pombe of the East Coast. Here they abuse the best of roast\nmeat, openly sigh for ’palaver-sauce’ and ’palm-oil chop,’ and find\nfault with the claret and champagne. Chez eux they wear\nbreech-cloths and nature’s stockings–eoco tutto. Here both men\nand women must dress like Europeans, and a portentous spectacle it\nis. The horror reaches its height at Sierra Leone, where the pulpit as\nwell as the press should deprecate human beings making such caricatures\nof themselves,",
        "In West Africa we see three styles of dress. The first, or semi-nude, is\nthat of the Kru-races, a scanty pagne, or waist-wrapper, the dark\nskin appearing perfectly decent. The second is the ample flowing robe,\nat once becoming and picturesque, with the shalwar, or wide\ndrawers, of the Moslems from Morocco to the Equator. The third is the\nhideous Frank attire affected by Sierra Leone converts and ’white\nblackmen,’ as their fellow-darkies call them.",
        "Many of the costumes that made the decks of the s.s. Senegal\nhideous are de fantaisie, as if the wearers had stripped pegs in\nEast London with the view of appearing at a fancy-ball. The general\neffect was that of ’perambulating rainbows en petit surmounted by\nsable thunder-clouds.’ One youth, whose complexion unmistakably wore the\nshadowed livery of the burnished sun, crowned his wool with a scarlet\nsmoking-cap, round which he had wound a white gauze veil. The light of\nday was not intense, but his skin was doubtless of most delicate\ntexture. Another paraded the deck in a flowing cotton-velvet\ndressing-gown with huge sleeves, and in bottines of sky-blue\ncloth. Even an Aku Moslem, who read his Koran, printed in Leipzig, and\nwho should have known better, had mimicked Europeans in this most\nunbecoming fashion.",
        "Men of substance sported superfine Saxony with the broadest of\nsilk-velvet collars; but the fit suggested second-hand finery. Other\nelongated cocoa-nuts bore jauntily a black felt of ’pork-pie’ order,\nleek-green billycocks, and anything gaudy, but not neat, in the\n’tile’-line. Their bright azure ribbons and rainbow neckties and scarves\nvied in splendour with the loudest of thunder-and-lightning waistcoats\nfrom the land of Moses and Sons. Pants were worn tight, to show the\ngrand thickness of knee, the delicate leanness of calf, the manly\npurchase of heel, and the waving line of beauty which here distinguishes\nshin-bones. There were monstrous studs upon a glorious expanse of\n’biled’ shirt; a small investment of cheap, tawdry rings set off the\nchimpanzee-like fingers; and, often enough, gloves invested the hands,\nwhose horny, reticulated skin reminded me of the black fowl, or the\nscaly feet of African cranes pacing at ease over the burning sands. Each\ndandy had his badine upon whose nice conduct he prided himself;\nthe toothpick was as omnipresent as the crutch, nor was the\n’quizzing-glass’ quite absent. Lower extremities, of the same category\nas the hands, but slightly superior in point of proportional size, were\ncrammed into patent-leather boots, the latter looking as if they had\nbeen stuffed with some inanimate substance–say the halves of a calf’s\nhead. Why cannot these men adopt some modification of the Chinese\ncostume, felt hat and white shoes, drawers, and upper raiment\nhalf-shirt, half-doublet? It has more common sense than any other in the\nworld.",
        "It is hardly fair to deride a man’s ugliness, but the ugly is fair game\nwhen self-obtruded into notice by personal vanity and conceit. Moreover,\nthis form of negro folly is not to be destroyed by gentle raillery; it\nwants hard words, even as certain tumours require the knife. Such aping\nof Europeans extends from the physical to the moral man, and in general\nonly the bad habits, gambling, drinking, and debauching, are aped.",
        "The worst and not the least hideous were the mulattos, of whom the\nnegroes say they are silver and copper, not gold. It is strange, passing\nstrange, that English blood, both in Africa and in India, mixes so badly\nfor body and mind (brain) with the native. It is not so with the\nneo-Latin nations of Southern Europe and the Portuguese of the\nBrazil. For instance, compare the pretty little coloured girls of\nPondicherry and Mahé with their sister half-castes the Chichis of Bengal\nand Bombay.",
        "As for the section conventionally called ’fair,’ and unpolitely termed\nby Cato the ’chattering, finery-loving, ungovernable sex,’ I despair to\ndepict it. When returning north in the A.S.S. Winnebah, we\ncarried on board a dark novice of the Lyons sisterhood. She looked\nperfectly ladylike in her long black dress and the white wimple which\nbound her hair under the sable mantilla. But the feminines on board the\nSenegal bound for Sierra Leone outrage all our sense of fitness\nby their frightful semi-European gowns of striped cottons and chintzes;\nby their harlequin shawls and scarves thrown over jackets which show\nmore than neck and bare arms to the light of day, and by the head-gear\nwhich looks like devils seen in dreams after a heavy supper of underdone\npork. Africa lurks in the basis: the harsh and wiry hair is gathered\ninto lumps, which to the new comer suggest only bears’ ears, and into\nchignons resembling curled up hedge-hogs. Around it is twisted a\nkerchief of arsenic-green, of sanguineous-crimson, or of sulphur-yellow;\nand this would be unobjectionable if it covered the whole head, like\nthe turban of the Mina negress in Brazilian Bahia. But it must be capped\nwith a hat or bonnet of straw, velvet, satin, or other stuff, shabby in\nthe extreme, and profusely adorned with old and tattered ribbons and\nfeathers, with beads and bugles, with flowers and fruits. The tout\nensemble would scare any crow, however bold.",
        "I am aware that the sex generally is somewhat persistent in its ideas of\npersonal decoration, and that there is truth in the African proverb, ’If\nyour head is not torn off you will wear a head-dress,’ corresponding\nwith our common saying, ’Better out of the world than out of the\nfashion.’ But this nuisance, I repeat, should be abated with a strong\nhand by the preacher as well as by the pressman. The women and the\nchildren are well enough as Nature made them: they make themselves mere\ncaricatures, figures o’ fun, guys, frights. If this fact were brought\nhome to them by those whose opinions they value, they might learn a\nlittle common sense and good taste. And yet–wait a moment–may they not\nsometimes say the same of us? But our monstrosities are original, theirs\nare borrowed.",
        "The ’mammies’ at once grouped themselves upon the main-hatch, as near\nthe quarter-deck and officers’ cabins as possible. I can hardly\nunderstand how Englishmen take a pleasure in ’chaffing’ these grotesque\nbeings, who usually reply with some gross, outrageous insolence. At the\nbest they utter impertinences which, issuing from a big and barbarous\nmouth in a peculiar patois, pass for pleasantry amongst those who\nare not over-nice about the quality of that article. The tone of voice\nis peculiar; it is pitched in the usual savage key, modified by the\ntwang of the chapel and by the cantilene of the Yankee–originally\nPuritan Lancashire. Hence a ’new chum’ may hear the women talking for\nseveral days before he finds out that they are talking English. And they\nspeak two different dialects. The first, used with strangers, is\n’blackman’s English,’intelligible enough despite the liberties it takes\nwith pronunciation, grammar, and syntax. The second is a kind of ’pidgin\nEnglish,’ spoken amongst themselves, like Bolognese or Venetians when\nthey have some reason for not talking Italian. One of the Gospels was\nprinted in it; I need hardly say with what effect. The first verse runs,\n’Lo vo famili va Jesus Christus, pikien. (piccaninny) va David, dissi da\npikien va Abraham.’ [Footnote: Da Njoe Testament, &c. Translated\ninto the negro-English language by the missionaries of the Unitas\nFratrum, &c. Printed by the British and Foreign Bible Society. London:\nW. McDowall, Pemberton Row, 1829.]",
        "This ’pidgin English’ runs down West Africa, except the Gold Coast and\nabout Accra, where the natives have learnt something better. The\nprincipal affirmation is ’Enh,’ pronounced nanny-goat fashion, and they\nalways answer ’Yes’ to a negative question: e.g. Q. ’Didn’t you\ngo then?’ A. ’Yes’ (sub-audi, I did not), thus meaning ’No.’\n’Na,’ apparently an interrogative in origin, is used pleonastically on\nall occasions: ’You na go na steamer?’ ’Enty’ means indeed; ’too much,’\nvery; ’one time,’ once; and the sign of the vocative, as in the Southern\nStates of the Union, follows the, word:’ Daddy, oh!’ ’Mammy, oh!’\n’Puss,’ or ’tittle,’ is a girl, perhaps a pretty girl; ’babboh,’ a\nboy. ’Hear’ is to obey or understand; ’look,’ to see; ’catch,’ to have;\n’lib,’ to live, to be, to be found, or to enjoy good health: it is\napplied equally to inanimates. ’Done lib’ means die; ’sabby’\n(Portuguese) is to know; ’chop,’ to eat; ’cut the cry,’ to end a wake;\n’jam head,’ or ’go for jam head,’ to take counsel; ’palaver (Port.)\nset,’ to end a dispute; to ’cut yamgah’ is to withhold payment, and to\n’make nyanga’ is to junket. ’Yam’ is food; ’tummach’ (Port.) is the\nmetaphorical heart; ’cockerapeak’ is early dawn, when the cock speaks;\nall writing, as well as printing, is a ’book;’ a quarrel is a ’bob;’ and\nall presents are a ’dash,’ ’dassy’ in Barbot, and ’dashs’ in Ogilby. All\nbulls are cows, and when you would specify sex you say ’man-cow’ or\n’woman-cow.’  [Footnote: For amusing specimens of amatory epistles the\nreader will consult Mrs. Melville and the Ten Years’ Wanderings among\nthe Ethiopians (p. 19), by my old colleague, Mr. Consul Hutchinson.]",
        "These peculiarities, especially the grammatical, are not mere\ncorruptions: they literally translate the African dialects now utterly\nforgotten by the people. And they are more interesting than would at\nfirst appear. Pure English, as a language, is too difficult in all\npoints to spread far and wide. ’Pidgin English’ is not. Already the\nChinese have produced a regular lingua franca, and the Japanese\nhave reduced it to a system of grammar. If we want only a medium of\nconversation, a tongue can be reduced to its simplest expression and\nwithal remain intelligible. Thus ’me’ may serve for I, me, my. Verbs\nwant no modal change to be understood. ’Done go’ and ’done eat’\nperfectly express went and ate. Something of the kind is still wanted,\nand must be supplied if we would see our language become that of the\ncommercial world in the East as it is fast becoming in the West.",
        "We left Bathurst more than ever convinced that the sooner we got rid of\nthe wretched station, miscalled a colony, the better. It still supplies\nhides from the tipper country, ivory, bees’-wax, and a little gold. The\nprecious metal is found, they say, in the red clay hills near Macarthy’s\nIsland; but the quality is not pure, nor is the quantity sufficient to\npay labour. The Mandengas, locally called ’gold strangers,’ manage the\ntraffic with the interior, probably the still mysterious range called\nthe ’Kong Mountains.’ They are armed with knives, sabres, and muskets;\nand for viaticum they carry rude rings of pure gold, which, I am told,\nare considered more valuable than the dust.",
        "But the staple export from Bathurst–in fact, nine-tenths of the\ntotal–consists of the arachide, pistache, pea-nut, or ground-nut\n(Arachis hypoga). It is the beat quality known to West Africa;\nand, beginning some half a century ago, large quantities are shipped for\nMarseilles, to assist in making salad-oil. Why this ’olive-oil’ has not\nbeen largely manufactured in England I cannot say. Thus the French have\nmonopolised the traffic of the Gambia; they have five houses, and the\nthree English, Messrs. Brown, Goddard, and Topp, export their purchases\nin French bottoms to French ports.",
        "Moreover, the treaty of 1845, binding the ’high contracting Powers’ to\nrefrain from territorial aggrandisement (much like forbidding a growing\nboy to grow), expired in 1855. Since that time, whilst we have refrained\neven from abating the nuisance of native wars, our very lively\nneighbours have annexed the Casamansa River, with the fine coffee-lands\nextending from the Nunez southwards to the Ponga River, and have made a\ndoughty attempt to absorb Matacong, lying a few miles north of Sierra\nLeone.",
        "Whilst English Gambia is monopolised by the French, French Gaboon is, or\nrather was, in English hands. For a score of years men of sense have\nasked, ’Why not exchange the two?’ When nations so decidedly rivalistic\nmeet, assuredly it is better to separate à l’aimable. Moreover,\nso long as our economical and free-trade ’fads’ endure, it is highly\nadvisable to avoid the neighbourhood of France and invidious comparisons\nbetween its policy and our non-policy, or rather impolicy.",
        "According to the best authorities, the whole of the West African coast\nnorth of Sierra Leone might be ceded with advantage to the French on\ncondition of our occupying the Gaboon and the regions, coast and\nislands, south of it, except where the land belongs to the Portuguese\nand the Spaniards. Some years ago an energetic effort was made to effect\nthe exchange, but it was frustrated by missionary and sentimental\nconsiderations. Those who opposed the idea shuddered at the thought of\nmaking over to a Romanist Power (?) the poor converts of Protestantism;\nthe peoples who had been peaceful and happy so long under the protecting\naegis of Great Britain; the races whom we were bound, by an unwritten\ncontract, not only to defend, but to civilise, to advance in the paths\nof progress. The colonists feared to part with the old effete\npossession, lest the French should oppose, as they have done in Senegal,\nall foreign industry–in fact, ’seal up’ the Gambia. A highly\nrespectable merchant, the late Mr. Brown, contributed not a little, by\nhis persuasive pen, to defeat the proposed measure. And now it is to be\nfeared that we have heard the last of this matter; our rivals have found\nout the high value of their once despised equatorial colony. If ever the\nexchange comes again to be discussed, I hope that we shall secure by\ntreaty or purchase an exclusively British occupation of Grand Bassam and\nthe Assini valley, mere prolongations of our Protectorate on the Gold\nCoast. A future page will show the reason why our imperial policy\nrequires the measure. At present both stations are occupied by French\nhouses or companies, who will claim indemnification, and who can in\njustice demand it.",
        "We steamed out of the Ruined River-port, and left ’this old sandbank in\nAfrica they call St. Mary’s Isle,’ at 11 A.M. on January 16, with a last\nglance at the Commissariat-buildings. Accompanied by a mosquito-fleet of\ncanoes, each carrying two sails, we stood over the bar, sighting the\nheavy breakers which defend the island’s northern face, and passed Cape\nSt. Mary, gradually dimming in the distance. After Bald Cape, some sixty\nmiles south, we ran along the long low shore, distinguished only by the\nmouths and islands of the Casamansa and the Cachéo rivers. Our course\nthen led us by the huge and hideous archipelago off the delta of Jeba\nand the Bolola, the latter being the ’Rio Grande’ of Camoens, which\nPortuguese editors will print with small initials, and which translators\nmistranslate accordingly. [Footnote: The Lusiads, v. 12. I have\nnoticed this error in Camoens: his Life and his Lusiads\n(vol. i. p. 896. London: Quaritch, 1881). It was probably called Grande\nbecause it was generally believed to be the southern outlet of the\nNiger.] These islands are the Bijougas, or Bissagos, the older\n’Biziguiches,’ inhabited by the most ferocious negroes on the coast, who\nmassacred the Portuguese and who murder all castaways. They are said to\nshoot one another as Malays ’run amok,’ and some of their tribal customs\nare peculiar to themselves.",
        "Here, about 350 miles north of Sierra Leone, was established the\nunfortunate Bulama colony. Its first and last governor, the redoubtable\nCaptain Philip Beaver, R.N., has left the queerest description of the\nplace and its people. [Footnote: African Memoranda. Baldwin, London,\n1805.] Within eighteen months only six remained of 269 souls, including\nwomen and children. In 1792 the island was abandoned, despite its wealth\nof ground-nuts. After long ’palavering’ it was again occupied by\nMr. Budge, manager of Waterloo Station, Sierra Leone; but he was not a\nfixture there. It is now, I believe, once more deserted.",
        "Early next morning we were off the Isles de Los, properly Dos Idolos (of\nthe Idols). On my return northwards I had an opportunity of a nearer\nview. The triad of parallel rock-lumps, sixty miles north of Sierra\nLeone, is called Tama, or Footabar, to the west; Ruma, or Crawford, a\ncentral and smaller block of some elevation; and Factory Island, the\nlargest, five or six miles long by one broad, and nearest the\nshore. Their aspect is not unpleasant: the features are those of the\nSierra Leone peninsula, black rocks, reefs, and outliers, underlying\nridges of red soil; and the land is feathered to the summit with palms,\nrising from stubbly grass, here and there patched black by the\nbush-fire. A number of small villages, with thatched huts like beehives,\nare scattered along the shore. The census of 1880 gives the total\nfigures at 1,300 to 1,400, and of these 800 inhabit Factory\nIsland. Mr. J. M. Metzger, the civil and intelligent sub-collector and\ncustom-house officer, a Sierra Leone man, reduced the number to 600,\nhalf of them occupying the easternmost of the three. He had never heard\nof the golden treasures said to have been buried here by Roberts the\npirate, the Captain (Will.) Kidd of these regions.",
        "In our older and more energetic colonial days we had a garrison on the\nIsles de Los. They found the climate inferior to the Banana group, off\nCape Shilling. Factory Island still deserves its name. Here M. Verminck,\nof Marseille, the successor of King Heddle, has a factory on the eastern\nside, an establishment managed by an agent and six clerks, with large\nwhite dwellings, store-houses, surf-boats, and a hulk to receive his\npalm-oil. The latter produces the finest prize-cockroaches I have yet\nseen.",
        "My lack of strength did not allow me to inspect the volcanic craters\nsaid to exist in these strips, or to visit any of the ’devil-houses.’\nMr. G. Neville, agent of the steamers at Lagos, gave me an account of\nhis trip. Landing near the French factory, he walked across the island\nin fifteen minutes, followed the western coast-line, turned to the\nsouth-west, descended a hollow, and found the place of sacrifice. Large\nboulders, that looked as if shaken down by an earthquake, stood near one\nanother. There were neither idols nor signs of paganism, except that the\nfloor, which resembled the dripstone of Tenerife, was smoothed by the\nfeet of the old worshippers. When steaming round the south-western point\nwe saw–at least so it was said–the famous ’devil-house’ which gave the\nislands their Portuguese name.",
        "Factory is divided by a narrow strait from Tumbo Island, and the latter\nfaces the lands occupied by the Susus. These equestrian tribes,\ninhabiting a grassy plain, were originally Mandengas, who migrated south\nto the Mellikuri, Furikaria, and Sumbuyah countries, and who\nintermarried with the aboriginal Bulloms, Tonko-Limbas, and Baggas. All\nare Moslems, and their superior organisation enabled them to prevail\nagainst the pagan Timnis, who in 1858-59 applied to the Government of\nSierra Leone for help, and received it. Of late years the chances of war\nhave changed, and the heathenry are said to have gained the upper\nhand. The Susus are an industrious tribe, and they trade with our colony\nin gum, ground-nuts, and benni, or sesamum-seed.",
        "It is uncommonly pleasant to leave these hotbeds and once more to\nbreathe the cool, keen breath of the Trades, laden with the health of\nthe broad Atlantic.",
        "SIERRA LEONE: THE CHANGE FOR THE BETTER.",
        "After a pleasant run, not in a ’sultry and tedious Pacific,’\ncovering 490 miles from Bathurst, we sighted a heavy cloud banking up\nthe southern horizon. As we approached it resolved itself into its three\ncomponent parts, the airy, the earthy, and the watery; and it turned out\nto be our destination. The old frowze of warm, water-laden nimbus was\nthere; everything looked damp and dank, lacking sweetness and\nsightliness; the air wanted clearing, the ground cleaning, and the sea\nwashing. Such on January 17, 1882, was the first appearance of the\nredoubtable Sierra Leone. It was a contrast to the description by the\nlearned and painstaking Winterbottom. [Footnote: An Account of the\nNative Africans im the Neighbourhood of Sierra Leone, etc. London,\nHatchard, 1803.] ’On a nearer approach the face of the country assumes a\nmore beautiful aspect. The rugged appearance of these mountains is\nsoftened by the lively verdure with which they are constantly crowned\n(?); their majestic forms (?), irregularly advancing and receding,\noccasion huge masses of light and shade to be projected from their\nsides, which add a degree of picturesque grandeur to the scene.’",
        "And first of the name. Pedro de Cintra (1480), following Soeiro da Costa\n(1462-63), is said to have applied ’Sierra Leone’ to the mountain-block\nin exchange for the ’Romarong’ of its Timni owners. He did nothing of\nthe kind: our English term is a mere confusion of two neo-Latin tongues,\n’Sierra’ being Spanish and ’Leone’ Italian. The Portuguese called it\nSerra da Leôa (of the Lioness), not ’Lion Hill.’  [Footnote: So the late\nKeith Johnston, Africa, who assigns to the apex a height of 2,500\nfeet.] Hence Milton is hardly worse than his neighbours when he writes–",
        "  Notus and Afer, black with thund’rous clouds\n  From Serraliona;",
        "and the old French ’Serrelionne’ was the most correct translation. The\nreason is disputed; some invoke the presence of the Queen of the Cats,\nothers the leonine rumbling of the re-echoed thunder. The latter\nsuggested the Montes Claros of the Portuguese. Cà da Mosto in 1505 tells\nus that the explorers ’gave the name of Sierra Leone to the mountain on\naccount of the roaring of thunder heard from the top, which is always\nburied in clouds.’ But the traveller, entering the roadstead, may see in\nthe outline of Leicester Cone a fashion of maneless lion or lioness\ncouchant with averted head, the dexter paw protruding in the shape of a\nground-bulge and the contour of the back and crupper tapering off\nnorth-eastwards. At any rate, it is as fair a resemblance as the French\nlion of Bastia and the British lion of ’Gib.’ Meanwhile those marvellous\nbeings the ’mammies’ call ’the city’ ’Sillyown,’ and the pretty, naughty\nmulatto lady married to the Missing Link termed it ’Sa Leone.’ I shall\ntherefore cleave to the latter, despite ’Mammy Gumbo’s’ box inscribed\n’Sa leone.’",
        "Presently the lighthouse, four to five miles distant from the anchorage,\nwas seen nestling at the base of old Cabo Ledo, the ’Glad Head,’ the\nTimni ’Miyinga,’ now Cape ’Sa Leone.’ Round this western point the sea\nand the discharge of two rivers run like a mill-race. According to\nBarbot (ii. 1) ’the natives call Cabo Ledo (not Liedo) or Tagrin (Cape\nSa Leone) ’Hesperi Cornu,’ the adjoining peoples (who are lamp-black)\nLeucsethiopes, and the mountain up the country Eyssadius Mons.’ All the\nmerest conjecture! Mr. Secretary Griffith, of whom more presently, here\nfinds the terminus of the Periplus of Hanno, the Carthaginian, in the\nsixth century B.C., and the far-famed gorilla-land. [Footnote: This I\nemphatically deny. Hanno describes an eruption, not a bush-fire, and Sa\nLeone never had a volcano within historic times. There is no range fit\nto be called Theôn Ochema (Vehicle of the Gods), which Ptolemy places on\nthe site of Camarones Peak, and there is no Notou Keras, or Horn of the\nSouth. Lastly, there is no island that could support the gorilla: we\nmust go further south for one, to Camarones and Corisoo in the Bight of\nBenin.]",
        "Formerly the red-tipped lantern-tower had attached to it a bungalow,\nwhere invalids resorted for fresh air; it has now fallen to pieces, and\ntwo iron seats have taken its place. Over this western end of the\npeninsula’s northern face the play of the sea-breeze is strong and\nregular; and the wester and north-wester blow, as at Freetown, fifty\ndays out of sixty. The run-in from this point is picturesque in clear\nweather, and it must have been beautiful before the luxuriant forest was\nfelled for fuel, and the land was burnt for plantations which were never\nplanted. A few noble trees linger beside and behind the lighthouse,\nfilling one with regret for the wanton destruction of their\nkind. Lighthouse Hillock, which commands the approach to the port, and\nwhich would sweep the waters as far as the Sá Leone River, will be\nprovided with powerful batteries before the next maritime war. And we\nmust not forget that Sá Leone is our only harbour of refuge, where a\nfleet can water and refit, between the Gambia and the Cape of Good Hope.",
        "The northern face of the Sá Leone peninsula is fretted with little\ncreeks and inlets, bights and lagoons, which were charming in a state of\nnature. Pirate’s Bay, the second after the lighthouse, is a fairy scene\nunder a fine sky; with its truly African tricolor, its blue waters\nreflecting air, its dwarf cliffs of laterite bespread with vivid\nleek-green, and its arc of golden yellow sand, upon which the feathery\ntops of the cocoa-palms look like pins planted in the ground. To the\ntravelled man the view suggests many a nook in the Pacific islands. The\nbathing is here excellent: natural breakwaters of black rock exclude the\nshark. The place derives its gruesome name from olden days, when the\nsmooth waters and the abundant fish and fruit tempted the fiery\nfilibusters to a relache. It was given in 1726 by Mr. Smith, surveyor to\nthe Royal African Company, after Roberts the pirate, who buried ’his\nloot’ in the Isles de Los, had burned an English ship. There is also a\ntradition that Drake chose it for anchoring.",
        "Beyond Pirate’s Bay, and separated by a bushy and wooded point, lies\nAberdeen Creek, a long reach extending far into the interior, and\nmaking, after heavy rains, this portion of the country",
        "  Both land and island twice a day.",
        "The whole site of Sa Leone is quasi-insular. Bunce or Bunch River to the\nnorth, and Calamart or Calmont, usually called Campbell’s Creek, from\nthe south, are said to meet at times behind the mountain-mass; and at\nall seasons a portage of a mile enables canoes to paddle round the\nhill-curtain behind Freetown. This conversion of peninsula into islet is\nby no means rare in the alluvial formations further south.",
        "Aberdeen Creek abounds in sunken rocks, which do not, however, prevent a\nferry-boat crossing it. Governor Rowe began a causeway to connect it\nwith the next village, and about a third of the length has already been\ndone by convict labour. Aberdeen village is a spread of low thatched\nhuts, lining half-cleared roads by courtesy called streets. Murray Town\nand Congo Town bring us to King Tom’s Point. Here is the old Wesleyan\nCollege, a large whitewashed bungalow with shingled roof, upper\njalousies, and lower arches; the band of verdure in front being\ndefended from the waves by a dwarf sea-wall and a few trees still\nlingering around it. The position is excellent: the committee, however,\nsold it because the distance was too great for the boys to walk, and\nbought a fitter place near Battery Point. Thus it became one of the many\nGovernment stores. A deep indentation now shows Upper Town or Kru Town,\nheaps of little thatched hovels divided by remnants of bush. It is,\ndespite its brook, one of the impurest sites in the colony: nothing can\nteach a Kruman cleanliness; a Slav village is neatness itself compared\nwith his. This foul colony settled early in Sá Leone, and in 1816 an\nordinance was passed enabling it to buy its bit of land. The present\nchief is ’King’ Tom Peter, who is also a first-class police-constable\nunder the Colonial Grovernment; and his subjects hold themselves far\nsuperior to their brethren in the old home down coast. ’We men work for\ncash-money; you men work for waist-cloth.’ Again ’pig-iron and tenpenny\nnails!’",
        "Beyond this point, at a bend of the bight, we anchor a few hundred feet\nfrom the shore, and we command a front view of roadstead and ’city.’\nSt. George’s Bay, the older ’Baie de France,’ would be impossible but\nfor the Middle Ground, the Scarcies Bank, and other huge shoals of sand\npinned down by rocks which defend the roadstead from the heavy send of\nthe sea. It is supplied with a tide-rip by the Tagrin, Mitomba, Rokel,\nor Rokelle, the Sá Leone River, which Barbot makes the ancients term Nia\n(Nia), and which the Timni tribe call Robung Dakell, or Stream of\nScales. Hence some identify it with Pliny’s ’flumen Bambotum crocodilis\net hippopotamis refertum.’ Its northern bank is the low Bullom shore, a\nlong flat line of mud and mangrove, on which all the fevers, Tertiana,\nQuartana, and Co., hold their court. The sea-facing dot is Leopard,\nanciently Leopold, Island, where it is said a leopard was once seen: it\nis, however, a headland connected by a sandspit with the leeward-most\npoint of the coast. The Bullom country takes a name after its tribe. A\nscore of years ago I was told they were wild as wild can be: now the\nchief, Alimami (El-Imám) Sanúsi, hospitably receives white faces at his\ncapital, Callamondia. Moreover, a weekly post passes through Natunu to\nKaikonki via Yongro, Proboh, and Bolloh.",
        "Inland (east) of the Bulloms, or lowlanders, dwell the Timnis, who drove\nto seaward the quondam lords of the land. Kissy, Sherbro, and Casamansa\nare all named from their ’Reguli.’ They retain a few traditional words,\nsuch as ’potu,’ meaning a European: similarly in Central Africa the King\nof Portugal is entitled Mueneputo. Butter is also ’Mantinka,’ the\nLusitanian Mantêiga, and a candle is Kandirr. Although ’the\nreligion of Islam seems likely to diffuse itself peaceably over the\nwhole district in which the colony (Sá Leone) is situated, carrying with\nit those advantages which seem ever to have attended its victory over\nnegro superstition,’ [Footnote: Report of Directors of Sierra Leone\nCompany to the House of Commons, quoted by Winterbottom and the\nRev. Mr. Macbriar.] the tribe has remained pagan.",
        "Buttressing the southern shore of the Rokel’s débouchure is a dwarf\nGhaut, a broken line of sea-subtending highlands, stretching\nsouth-south-east some eighteen miles from Cape Sá Leone to Cape\nShilling. Inland of these heights the ground is low. The breadth of the\npeninsula is about twelve miles, which would give it an area of 300\nsquare miles, larger than the Isle of Wight. There are, besides it, the\nKwiah (Quiah) country, British Sherbro, an important annexation dated\n1862; the Isles de Los, the Bananas, and a strip of land on the Bullom\nshore,–additions which more than treble the old extent.",
        "The peninsula is distinctly volcanic, and subject to earthquakes: the\nseismic movement of 1858 extended to the Gold Coast, and was a precursor\nof the ruins of 1862. [Footnote: For the older earthquakes see\nWinterbottom, i, 34-5.] Its appearance, however, is rather that of a\nsandstone region, the effect of the laterite or volcanic mud which, in\nlong past ages, has been poured over the plutonic ejections; and the\nsoftly rounded contours, with here and there a lumpy cone, a tongue of\nland, and a gentle depression, show the long-continued action of water\nand weather. This high background, which arrests the noxious vapours of\nthe lowlands and of the Bullom shore, and which forbids a thorough\ndraught, is the fons malorum, the grand cause of the fevers and malaria\nfor which the land has an eternal ill fame. The ’Sultan’ of the Ghauts\nis Regent Mountain, or Sugarloaf Peak, a kind of lumpy ’parrot’s beak’\nwhich rises nearly 3,000 feet above sea-level: one rarely sees even its\nbase. The trip to the summit occupies two days; and here wild coffee is\nsaid to flourish, as it does at Kwiah and other parts of the\nlowland. The ’Wazir’ is Wilberforce, which supports sundry hamlets set\nin dense bush; and Leicester Cone, the lioness-hill, ranks third. The\nfew reclaimed patches, set in natural shrubbery, are widely scattered:\nthe pure, unsophisticated African is ever ashamed of putting hand to hoe\nor plough; and, where the virgin soil would grow almost everything, we\ncannot see a farm and nothing is rarer than a field. Firing the bush\nalso has been unwisely allowed: hence the destruction of much valuable\ntimber and produce; for instance, tallow-trees and saponaceous\nnut-trees, especially the Pentadesma butyracea, and the noble\nforest which once clothed the land from Sá Leone to the Niger.",
        "Looking towards the Rokel River, we see the Fourah Bay and College, a\nlarge and handsome building, now terribly out of repair. This\nestablishment, the ’Farran’s House’ of old maps, is well known to\nreaders of propagandist works; it opened on February 18, 1828, with six\npupils, one of whom was the ’boy Ajai,’ now Bishop Crowther of the Niger\nterritory. The Church Missionary Society has spent upon it a small\ntreasury of money; at present it ranks as a manner of university, having\nbeen affiliated in May 1876 to that of Durham. Sealed papers are sent\nout from England, but perhaps the local examiners are easy distributors\nof B.A.s and so forth to the golden youth of Sá Leone. It is free to\nall, irrespective of religious denomination, a liberal concession which\ndoes it high honour. The academical twelve-month has three terms; and\nthere are three scholarships, each worth 40l. per annum, open for\ncompetition every year. Not bad for a maximum of sixteen students, whose\ntotal is steadily diminishing. College evening-classes are held for the\nbenefit of those who must work by day; and charges are exceedingly\nmoderate, the admission fee being 10s. 6d. The Society\nproposes, they say, to give it up. It may be wanted half a century\nhence. [Footnote: An annual report is published. Those curious on the\nsubject will consult it.]",
        "West of Fourah College, and separated, longo intervallo, by an\napparently unbroken bush, is Bishop’s Court, where the Right Reverend\nlives as long as he can or will. Nearer the ’city’ lies the deep little\nbight called Susan or Sawpit Bay. It is also known as Destruction Bay–a\ngloomy name–where ships caught carrying ’bales,’ or ’dry goods,’ or\n’blackbirds,’ were broken up. Twenty years ago traces of their ruins\nwere still seen. Susan is now provided with a large factory: here\n’factories’ do not manufacture. A host of boats and dug-outs, a\nswarm of natives like black ants, a long wooden jetty, and some very\ntall houses denote the place where Messrs. Randall and Fisher store and\nsell their Kola-nuts. This astringent, the Gora of old writers\n(Sterculia acuminata), acts in Africa like the Brazilian Guaraná,\nthe Kát (Catha edulis) of southern Arabia, the Betel-nut of\nHindostan, and the opium of China, against which certain bigots, with\nall the presumption of utter ignorance, have been, and still are, waging\nan absurd war. Sá Leone exported 3,445l. worth of Kola-nuts in\n1860; in 1870 10,400l.; and, in 1880, 24,422l. The demand\ntherefore increases and will increase. [Footnote: Mr. Griffith says,\n’The Mohammedans of Africa have a singular belief that if they die with\na portion of this nut in their stomach their everlasting happiness is\nsecured.’ This must be some fanciful Christian tale. Amongst them,\nhowever, the red Kola, when sent to the stranger, denotes war, the white\nKola peace.]",
        "In Susan Bay there is a good coal-shed with a small supply for the use\nof the colonial steamer. A store of compressed coal is on the town-front\nand heaps used to lie about King Tom’s Point. A hulk was proposed and\nrefused. It is now intended to increase the quantity, for the benefit of\nfuture companies, especially the ’Castle Line,’ which talks of sending\ntheir steamers to Sá Leone. I hope they will so do; more competition is\nmuch wanted. But the coal-depôt may prove dangerous. The mineral in the\ntropics produces by its exhalations fatal fevers, especially that\nexaggerated form of bilious-remittent popularly known as ’Yellow Jack.’\nIt is certain that in places like West Indian St. Thomas the\nneighbourhood of the coal-sheds is more unhealthy, without apparent\nreason, than the sites removed from it.",
        "And now we reach Freetown proper, which may be called Cathedral-Town or\nJail-Town. At a distance the ’Liverpool’ or ’London of West Africa,’ as\nthe lieges wildly entitle it, is not unpicturesque; but the style of\nbeauty is that of a baronial castle on the Rhine with an unpensioned\nproprietor, ruinous and tumbledown. After Las Palmas and Santa Cruz it\nlooks like a dingy belle who has seen better and younger days; and who,\nmoreover, has forgotten her paint. She has suffered severely from the\nabolition of the export slave-trade, in whose palmy times she supplied\nmany a squadron, and she will not be comforted for the loss.",
        "The colours of the houses are various; plain white is rare, and the\nprevailing tints are the light-brick of the fresh laterite and the dark\nrusty ochre of the old. But all are the same in one point, the mildewed,\ncankered, gangrened aspect, contrasting so unfavourably with the\nwhitewashed port-towns of the Arabs. The upper stories of wood-work\nbased on masonry, the fronting piazzas or galleries, the huge\nplank-balconies, and the general use of shingle roofs–in fact, the\nquantity of tinder-timber, reminding one of olden Cairo, are real risks:\nsome of the best houses have been destroyed by fire; and, as in\nValparaiso and the flue-warmed castles of England, it is only a question\nof time when the inmates will be houseless. Thanks to the form of\nground, the townlet is well laid out, with a gradual rake towards the\nbay. But there is no marine parade, and the remarkably uneven\nhabitations crowd towards the water-front, like those of Eastern ports,\nthinning off and losing style inland. The best are placed to catch the\n’Doctor,’ or sea-breeze: here, as at Zanzibar, the temperature out of\nthe wind becomes unendurable.",
        "Freetown lies upon a gentle declivity, a slope of laterite and diluvium\nwashed down from the higher levels. The ground is good for drainage, but\nthe soft and friable soil readily absorbs the deluging torrents of rain,\nand as readily returns them to the air in the shape of noxious\nvapours. The shape is triangular. The apex is ’Tower Hill,’ so named\nfrom a ruined martello, supposed to have been built by the Dutch, and\ntill lately used for stores. The barracks, which lodge one of the West\nIndia regiments, are six large blocks crowning the hill-crest and girt\nwith a low and loopholed wall. In winter, or rather in the December\nsummer, the slopes are clad in fine golden stubbles, the only spectacle\nof the kind which this part of the coast affords. Though not more than\nfour hundred feet or so above sea-level, the barracks are free from\nyellow fever; and in the years when the harbour-town has been almost\ndepopulated the only fatal cases were those brought up from\nbelow. Moreover, the disease did not spread. The officers’ quarters,\nwith cool and lofty rooms, twenty feet high, are surrounded by shady and\nairy piazzas or verandahs, where the wind, when there is any, must find\nits way. For many years they had jalousies and half-windows\ninstead of glass, which forced the inmates to sit in outer darkness\nduring tornadoes and the Rains. The garrison, like the town, owes an\neternal debt of gratitude to Governor J. Pope Henessy. Seeing the main\nwant of Sá Leone, he canalised in 1872, with the good aid of\nMr. Engineer Jenkins, a fine fountain rising below ’Heddle’s Farm,’\nenabling the barracks to have a swimming-bath and the townsfolk to lay\non, through smaller pipes, a fair supply of filtered water. For this\nalone he amply deserves a statue; but colonies, like republics, are\nrarely grateful.",
        "The sea-front of the triangle, whose lowest houses are sprinkled by the\nwave-spray, is bounded on the east by Battery Point. It is a grassy flat\nwith a few fine trees, and benches ever black with the native\nlounger. Here the regimental band plays on Wednesdays; an occasional\ncircus pitches its tents, and ’beauty and fashion’ flock to see and be\nseen. The many are on foot; the few use Bath-chairs or machilas,\n–fautenils hung to a pole. The only carriage in the place\nbelongs to the Governor, and he lost no time in losing one of\nhis horses. Riding is apparently unknown.",
        "The Battery is the old Fort Falconbridge. A worm-eaten gun or two, far\nmore dangerous to those in rear than to those in front, rises en\nbarbette. The affair would fall in half an hour before the mildest\nof gunboats. Yet by fortifying three points at an expense of some 6,000£\nto 8,000£ Sá Leone might be decently defended. The first is Lighthouse\nPoint, along which ships entering and leaving perforce must run; the\nsecond would be King Tom’s Point, flanking the harbour-front; and the\nthird would be Johnson’s Battery, where salutes are now fired, a work\nlying above Government House upon a spur of Barrack Hill. Needless to\nsay all three would want the heaviest guns.",
        "Running the eye west of the Battery, a few wooden houses or sheds, some\nof them overhanging the dwarf cliff, the black rocks, and the red-yellow\nsands, lead to Taylor’s warehouses, a huge pile of laterite still\nunfinished. Here the traditional ’man and boy’ may sometimes be seen\nworking in the cooler and more comfortable hours. Beyond it, on a level\nwith the water, stands the new camber, where we shall land. Then comes\nthe huge block built by Mr. Charles Heddle, of Hoy, who by grace of a\nlarge fortune, honourably made at Freetown, has become proprietor of a\nnoble château and broad lands in France. It has now been converted into\nthe Crown commissariat-store. The sea-frontage has a clear fall of\neighty feet, whereas, from the street behind the wooden upper story, it\nappears below the average height. Very mean are the custom-house and\nadjoining coal-shed. Governor ’Dangan’s Wharf,’ a contemptible jetty,\nand its puny lighthouse have at length made way for a quay, along which\nships, despite sunken rocks, were expected to lie; but the sea soon\nbroke down the perpendicular wall, and now it is being rebuilt with a\n’batter.’ A hollow square behind it shows the workmen blasting the\nmaterial, a fine-grained grey granite, which seems here, as at Axim, to\nbe the floor-rock of the land. No wonder that the new harbour-works have\ncost already 70,000l., of which 50,637l. are still owed,\nand that the preposterous wharfage-duty is 10s. per ton. To avoid\nthis and the harbour-dues, ships anchor, whenever they safely can, in\nthe offing, where the shoals are Nature’s breakwaters. West of the\nquarry-hollow, in my day a little grassy square, are the old\nCommissariat-quarters, now a bonded warehouse. This building is also a\nlong low cottage viewed from inland, and a tall, grim structure seen\nfrom the sea. On a higher level stands St. George’s, once a church, but\nyears ago promoted to a cathedral-dignity, making Freetown proud as\nBarchester Towers. We shall presently pass it and its caricature, the\npert little Wesleyan church to its east. The extreme west of the\ntriangle-base is occupied by the gaol. No longer a ’barn-like structure\nfaced by a black wall,’ it is a lengthy scatter of detached buildings,\nlarge enough to accommodate half the population, and distinguished by\nits colour, a light ashen grey. Behind this projecting site lies King\nJimmy’s Bridge, a causeway through whose central arch a stream of\nsparkling water winds its way seawards.",
        "Below King Jimmy’s Bridge is the only antiquity which Sá Leone\nknows. Here, according to some, Sir Francis Drake, the discoverer of\nCalifornia and her gold, the gallant knight of whom the Virgin Queen\nsaid that ’his actions did him more honour than his title,’ left his\nname upon the buttress of primitive rock. Others have (correctly?)\nattributed the inscription to Sir John Hawkins, the old naval worthy\nwhose name still blossoms in the dust at Sá Leone as the ’first slaver.’\nThe waters and the tramp of negro feet have obliterated the epigraph,\nwhich was, they say, legible forty years ago. The rock is covered with\ngriffonages; and here some well-cut square letters easily read–",
        "Near this ’written rock’ is King James’s Well, a pure stream which in\nformer times supplied the shipping.",
        "The scene in the harbour is by no means lively, although the three or\nfour dismantled merchant-craft, dreary as the settlement, have now\ndisappeared. A little white-painted colonial steamer, a dwarf\npaddle-wheeler, the Prince of Wales, lies moping and solitary off\nfoul Krutown Bay. At times a single gunboat puts in an appearance. There\nmay be a French steamer with a blue anchor on a white flag bound for\nSherbro, or the Isles de Los; and a queer Noah’s Ark kind of craft,\nbelonging to Mr. Broadhurst, a partner in Randall and Fisher’s, runs to\nthe river Scarcies and others. These are the grandees of the waters. The\nmiddle class is composed of Porto Loko [Footnote: Porto Loko–not\nLocco–derives its name from a locust-tree, whose fruit is an ingredient\nin ’palaver sauce;’ and Winterbottom (I.4), who calls it Logo, derives\nthe word from the land of that name.] boats, which affect the streams\nand estuaries. Originally canoes, they were improved to the\nfelucca-type of the Portuguese, and the hulls reminded Cameron and\nmyself of the Zanzibarian ’Mtepe.’ A strong standing-awning of wood\noccupies the sternward third; the masts number two or three, with a\nshort jib, and there are six oars on each side, worked by men on foot,\nwho alternately push and pull–a thoroughly novel process in rowing.\nThe Sá Leone boats which carry passengers on shore are carefully named,\nbut apparently never washed: they want the sunshades of the Bathurst\ncraft. The commonalty of the sea is the host of dug-outs, in which the\nsable fisherman, indolently thrown back, props his feet upon the\ngunwales and attaches a line to each big toe. These men land little more\nthan enough for their own subsistence, and the market-supply is\ninfinitesimal compared with what industry and proper appliances might\nproduce.",
        "The background of the ’city’ is a green curtain of grass and\nfruit-trees, amongst which predominate the breadfruit, an early\nintroduction; the prim dark mango, somewhat like an orange multiplied by\ntwo, or three, and palms, ever present in equinoctial lowlands. On the\nheights above the settlement there is room for cool country-seats, where\nEuropean exiles might live comparatively safe from fever and the more\ndeadly dysentery. A white lodge peeping from a densely wooded\nmountain-flank, originally Carnes’s Farm and now Heddle’s Farm, was\ncalled Mount Oriel (Oriole?) by Mrs. Melville, the wife of a pensioned\njudge of the Mixed Customs Court, who lived here seven years. Her sketch\nof a sojourn upon the Lioness Range is not tempting: young gentlemen who\nintend leading brides to the deadly peninsula should hide the book from\ntheir fair intendeds. I cannot, however, but admire the ’word-painting’\nof the scenery and the fidelity of those descriptions concerning which I\nhave a right to form an opinion. The book [Footnote: A Residence in\nSierra Leone. By a Lady. London: Murray, 1849.] was edited by the late\nMrs. Caroline Norton.",
        "Though not more than 550 feet above sea-level, the climate of Heddle’s\nFarm is said to be wholly different from that of the lower town. The\nproperty was bought by Government for a song, and now it occasionally\nlodges a sick governor or a convalescent officer. During my last visit\nthe Sa Leonites spoke of building a sanatorium at Wilberforce village,\nalias Signal Hill, where a flag announces the approach of vessels. The\ntenement rose to nearly the first story, when it stopped short for want\nof funds. Now they talk of a white regiment being stationed at the\n’White Man’s Grave,’ and propose barracks high up the hills beyond sight\nof the town-frontage. The site was pointed out to me where the\nartillery-range now is, and beyond where a dwarf thatch shows the\nmusketry-ground of the West India regiment. We shall sight from afar,\nwhen steaming out southwards, the three white dots which represent\nquarters on Leicester Cone; now they are hidden in frowsy\nfog-clouds. But all these heights have one and the same\ndisadvantage. You live in a Scotch mist, you breathe as much water as\nair, and you exchange fever and dysentery for rheumatism, and lumbago,\nand all that dire cohort.",
        "Presently the health-officer with his blue flag gave us pratique, and\nthe fort-adjutant with his red flag carried off our only soldier. The\nlatter, with a hospitality rare, it is to be hoped, in British\nregiments, would hardly recognise his quondam shipmates. We were duly\ninterviewed, in most civilised style, by a youth who does this work for\nMr. George A. Freeman, manager of the ’West African Reporter.’  Then the\ns.s. Senegal was attacked and captured by a host of sable\nvisitors, some coming to greet their friends, other to do a little\nbusiness in the washing and the shoreboat lines.",
        "The washerwoman lost no time in showing up, although her charges have\nbeen greatly reduced. She formerly demanded nearly treble as much as in\nLondon; now, however, she makes only sixteen to twenty shillings a\nmonth, not bad pay in a place where living costs threepence, and\ncomfortable living sixpence, a day. These nymphs of the wash-tub are\npainfully familiar and plain. The dress is a bright cotton foulard bound\non like the anatomy of a turban and garnished, as were our grandmothers’\nnightcaps, with huge front bows. Gaudy shawls cover white cotton\njackets; and skirts of bright, showy longcloth suggest the parrot or the\ncockatoo. The ornaments are large gold earrings and necklaces of beads\nor coral. I could not but remark the difference of tone. There was none\nof the extreme ’bumptiousness’ and pugnacious impudence of twenty years\nago; indeed, the beach-boys, nowhere a promising class, were rather\ncivil than otherwise. Not a single allusion to the contrast of ’white\nniggahs and black gen’lemen.’ Nor did the unruly, disorderly African\ncharacter ever show itself, as formerly it often did, by fisticuffing,\nhair-pulling, and cursing, with a mixture of English and Dark-Continent\nideas and phraseology, whose tout ensemble was really portentous.",
        "The popular voice ascribes this immense change for the better to the\nenergetic action of Governor S. Rowe (1876); and if so his statue\ndeserves to stand beside that of Pope Henessy. We could not fairly\ncomplain of the inordinate noise, which would have been the death of\na sick traveller. Niger cannot speak without bawling. The charge for\nlanding was only threepence; en revanche the poor fellows\nstole every little thing they could, including my best meerschaum.",
        "Cameron and I went ashore to hire Krumen for the Gold Coast, and herein\nwe notably failed. We disembarked at the camber, a huge pile of masonry,\nwhose weight upon an insecure foundation has already split the sea-wall\nin more than one place. The interior also is silting up so fast that it\nwill constantly require dredging to admit boats. In fact, the colony\nmust deeply repent not having patronised Mr. Jenkins’s project of a\nT-headed pier, on one side of which landing would have been practicable\nin all weathers.",
        "The sun, despite the mist, seemed to burn our backs, and the glare from\nthe red clay soil roasted our eyes as we toiled up the ramp, bad as\nthose of ’Gib.,’ which leads to Water Street, the lower line subtending\nthe shore. Here we could inspect St. George’s Cathedral, built, they\nsay, at a cost of 10,000l. to 15,000l., which would be\nreduced to 5,000l. in England–contracts in such ’colonies’ cost\nmore than stone and slate. The general aspect is that of its Bombay\nbrother, and the order is called, I believe, neo-Gothic, the last insult\nto ecclesiastical architecture. A single rusty tower, with\ntoy-battlements, pins down along ridge-back, evidently borrowed from a\nbarn; the light yellow-wash is mildewed and weather-stained, and the\nwindows show unseemly holes. Surely Bishop Cheetham could have afforded\na few panes of glass when exchanging his diocese for a rectory in\nEngland. Let me here note that the Catholic bishop at Goa and elsewhere\nis expected to die at his post, and that there is an over-worldly look\nin this Protestant form of the ’nolo episcopari.’ East of the cathedral,\nand uncompromisingly ’Oriented’ to the north, stands the unfinished\nshell of a Wesleyan chapel, suggesting that caricature which has\nintruded itself into the shadow of York Minster. Some 5,000l.\nwere spent upon this article by the locals; but the home committee\nwisely determined that it should not be finished, and now they propose\nto pull it down for building-material.",
        "We then entered the fruit and vegetable market, a neat and well-paved\nbazar, surmounted by a flying roof and pierced for glass windows. The\ndead arches in the long walls are externally stone and internally\nbrick. The building was full of fat middle-aged negresses, sitting at\nsquat before their ’blyes,’ or round baskets, which contained a variety\nand confusion of heterogeneous articles. The following is a list almost\nas disorderly as the collection itself.",
        "There were pins and needles, yarn and thread, that have taken the place\nof the wilder thorn and fibre; all kinds of small hardware;\nlooking-glasses in lacquered frames; beads of sorts, cowries and reels\nof cotton; pots of odorous pomatum and shea-butter nuts; feathers of the\nplantain-bird and country snuff-boxes of a chestnut-like fruit (a\nstrychnine?) from which the powder is inhaled, more majorum,\nthrough a quill; physic-nuts (tiglium, or croton), a favourite\nbut painful native remedy; horns of the goat and antelope, possibly\nintended for fetish ’medicine;’ blue-stone, colcothar and other\ndrugs. Amongst the edibles appeared huge achatinae, which make an\nexcellent soup, equal to that of the French snail; ground-nuts; very\npoor rice of four varieties, large and small, red and dark; cheap\nginger, of which the streets are at times redolent, and which makes good\nhome-brewed ’pop;’ the Kolá-nut, here worth a halfpenny and at Bathurst\na penny each; the bitter Kolá, a very different article from the\nesculent; skewered rôts of ground-hog, a rodent that can climb,\ndestroy vegetables, and bite hard if necessary; dried bats and rats,\nwhich the African as well as the Chinese loves, and fish cuits au\nsoleil, preferred when ’high,’ to use the mildest adjective. From\nthe walls hung dry goods, red woollen nightcaps and comforters,\nleopards’ and monkeys’ skins, and the pelt of an animal which might have\nbeen a gazelle.",
        "Upon the long counters or tables were displayed the fruits and\nvegetables. The former were the custard-apple or sweet-sop (Annona\nsquamosa), the sour-sop (A. muricata), the Madeiran\nchirimoya, (A. cherimolia), citrons, sweet and sour limes,\nand oranges, sweet and bitter, grown in the mountains; bananas\n(M. paradisiaca), the staff of life on the Gold Coast, and\nplantains (M. sapientum), the horse-plantains of India;\n[Footnote: The West Indian plantain is apparently unknown or unused]\npine-apples more than half wild; mangoes terribly turpentiney unless the\ntrunk be gashed to let out the gum; ’monkey-plums’ or ’apples’ and\n’governor’s plums.’ The common guavas are rank and harsh, but the\n’strawberry guava,’ as it is locally called, has a delicate, subacid\nflavour not easily equalled. The aguacáte, or alligator-pear\n(Persea gratissima), which was not ’introduced by the\nBasel missionaries from the West Indies,’ is inferior to the\nMexican. Connoisseurs compare its nutty flavour with that of the\nfilbert, and eat it with pepper, salt, and the sauce of Worcester, whose\nfortune was made by the nice conduct of garlic. The papaw [Footnote: The\nleaves are rubbed on meat to make it tender, and a drop of milk from the\nyoung fruit acts as a vermifuge.] should be cooked as a vegetable and\nstuffed with forced meat; the flesh of the granadilla, which resembles\nit, is neglected, while the seeds and their surroundings are flavoured\nwith sherry and sugar. There is an abundance of the Eriobotrya\nJaponica, in Madeira called the loquat and elsewhere the Japanese\nmedlar: it grows wild in the Brazil, where the people distil from\nit. [Footnote: I cannot yet decide whether its birthplace is Japan or\nSouth America, whose plants have now invaded Western India and greatly\naltered the vegetation.]",
        "The chief vegetables were the watercress, grown in private gardens;\nonions, large and mild as the Spanish; calavances, or beans;\nokras or gumbos, the bhendi of India (Hibiscus\nesculentus), the best thickening for soup; bengwas, or\negg-plants; yams (Dioscorea bulbifera) of sorts; bitter Cassada\n(Jatropha manihot) and the sweet variety (Jatropha\njanipha); garlic; kokos (Colocasia esculenta); potatoes,\nwhich the steamers are beginning to bring from England, not from\nMadeira; tomatoes like musket-balls, but very sweet and wholesome; and\nthe batata, (Convolvulus patatus, or sweet potato), which\nwhilom made ’kissing comfits.’  The edibles consisted of’ fufu’\n(plantain-paste); of ’cankey,’ a sour pudding of maize-flour; of\nginger-cake; of cassava-balls finely levigated, and of sweetened\n’agadi,’ native bread in lumps, wrapped up in plantain-leaves. Toddy was\nthe usual drink offered for sale.",
        "The butchers’ yard, near the market, is no longer a ’ragged and\nuncleanly strip of ground.’ The long-horned cattle, small, mostly\nhumpless, and resembling the brindled and dun Alderney cow, are driven\nin from the Pulo (Fulah) country. I have described the beef as tasting\nnot unlike what one imagines a knacker’s establishment to produce, and\nsince that time I have found but scant improvement. It is sold on\nalternate days with mutton, the former costing 6d., the latter\n9d. a pound. Veal, so bad in England and so good in Southern\nEurope, is unknown. The long, lean, hairy black-and-white sheep do not\nsupply an excellent article. Goats and kids are plentiful, and the flesh\nwould be good if it had any taste. Hogs abound, as in Ireland; but no\none eats pork, for the best of reasons. The poultry-list comprises\nsmall tough fowls (l0d. to 2s.), partridges, ducks (2s.\n6d.), geese, especially the spur-winged from Sherbro,\nand the Muscovy or Manilla duck–a hard-fleshed, insipid bird, whose old\nhome was South American Paraguay–turkeys (10s. to 15s.),\nand the arripiada, or frizzly chicken, whose feathers stand on\nend. Milk is scarce and dear. Englishmen raw in the tropics object to\nmilch-goats and often put up with milch-pigs, which are said to be here\nkept for the purpose. I need not tell all the old tale, ’Goat he go die;\npig he go for bush,’ &c. Butter (1s. 8d. in 2-lb. tins) is\noily and rancid, with the general look of cartgrease, in this tropical\ntemperature. It is curious that the Danish and Irish dairies cannot\nsupply the West African public with a more toothsome article.",
        "Near the meat-market is the double row of houses with shops upon the\nground-floor, not unlike a Banyan’s street in outer Bombay, but smaller,\ndirtier, meaner far. Here the stranger can buy dry goods and a few\ncuriosities of Mandenga manufacture–grigris (teraphim or charms), bows,\nspears, and saddles and bridles like those of the Somal, both perfectly\nuseless to white men. The leather, however, is excellent as the\nMoroccan, and the work dates from the days when the Saracens pushed\nsouthwards from the Mediterranean to the Niger-valley. Wild animals are\nat times offered for sale, but Darkey has heard exaggerated accounts of\nprices paid in England for grey parrots, palm-birds, monkeys,\nbush-antelopes, mongooses, ground-pigs, and other ’small deer’ brought\nfrom the rivulets behind Freetown. Sundry snakes were offered for sale,\nthe Mandenga, 4 to 5 feet long, with black marks upon a yellow ground,\nand the spitting serpent, between 5 and 6 feet long, with a long head,\nalso dark above and silvery grey below. I doubted the fact of its\nejecting saliva till assured by the Rev. John Milum that two\nmissionaries at Lagos, Messieurs J. B. Wood and David, had suffered\nseverely from inflamed eyes after the contemptuous ophine\ncrachat. All along the coast is a cerastes (horned snake), whose\narmature is upon the snout and whose short fat form suggests the\npuff-adder. The worst is a venomous-looking cobra, or hooded viper, with\nflat, cordate head, broad like all the more ferocious species. It is the\nonly thanatophid whose bite I will not undertake to cure. We carried on\nthe A.S.S. Winnebah, for the benefit of Mr. Cross, of Liverpool,\na big black ape, which the Sá Leonites called a ’black chimpanzee.’\nThough badly wounded she had cost 27l., and died after a few days\nof the cage. The young chimpanzees were valued at 61.",
        "I looked in vain for the old inn, the only thing in the place, a dirty\nhovel, kept, in 1862, by a Liberian negro, inscribed ’Lunch-house’ on a\nsign-board flanked by the Union Jack and the U.S. ’oysters and\ngridiron.’ Nothing has succeeded to this ’American hotel,’ and visitors\nmust depend upon the hospitality of acquaintances. A Frenchman lately\nopened a Gasthaus, and lost no time in becoming bankrupt. There\nis, however, a manner of boarding-house kept by a Mrs. King.",
        "Turning south from Water Street, we passed the Wilberforce, or rather\nthe ’Willyfoss,’ memorial, a colossal scandal noticed by every visitor\nat Sá Leone, a ’folly’ which has cost 3,000l. Its condition is\nexactly what it was two decads ago–a chapel-like shell of dingy, mouldy\nlaterite with six lancet-windows and metal pillars. Its case is a\ncomplicated concern. The ecclesiastical authorities wanted it for their\npurposes, and so did the secular civilians, and so did the military. At\nlast the Sá Leonites, hopeless of obtaining a Government grant, have set\non foot a subscription which reached 500l.–some say 700l.\nThere are, therefore, certain fitful signs of activity, and\nbricks and fire-bricks now cumber the ground; but it is all a ’flash\nin the pan.’ The present purpose is to make it a library, in place of\nthe fine old collection which went to the dogs. It is also to serve as a\nlecture-room. But who is there in the ’African Liverpool’ that can\nlecture? What is he to lecture about? Who will stand or sit out being\nlectured?",
        "Immediately beyond this grim and grisly reminiscence are the neat\ndwelling-house and the store of the Honourable Mr. Sybille Boyle, so\nnamed from a ship and from her captain, R.N., who served in the\npreventive squadron about 1824. He is an unofficial member of Council\nand a marked exception to the rule of the ’Liberateds.’ Everybody has a\ngood word to say of him. The establishment is the regular colonial,\nwhere you can buy anything between a needle and a sheet-anchor. Bottled\nale is not wanting, and thus steamer-passengers learn to congregate in\nthe back parlour.",
        "We then walked to the top of Gloucester Street, expecting to see the\nDuke of Edinburgh’s memorial. I left it an arch of sticks and timber\nspanning this main cross-line, which leads to Government House. The\ntemporary was to be supplanted by a permanent marble arc de\ntriomphe, commemorating the auspicious occasion when the black\ncolony first looked upon a live white Royal Highness. At once\n700l. was subscribed, and only 800l. was wanting; but all\nthose interested in the matter died, and the 350l. which remained\nin the chest was, I believe, transferred to the ’Willyfoss.’  The august\nday is still kept as a public holiday, for the people are, after their\nfashion, loyal-mouthed in the extreme. But the memorial is clean\nforgotten, and men stare if you ask about it. Half-way up the street is\nthe post-office, whose white chief is not a whit more civil than the\nnegro head in 1862.",
        "Upon this highly interesting spot we stood awhile to note the\npeculiarities of the place and its position. The soil is a loose clay,\ndeep-red or brown, impregnated with iron and, where unclothed with\nhumus, cold and infertile, as the spontaneous aloe shows. The subsoil is\nlaterite, also highly ferruginous. Soft and working well with the axe\nwhile it retains the quarry-water, it soon hardens by exposure; and,\nthus weathered, it forms the best and ugliest of the local building\nmaterials. Embedded in the earth’s surface are blocks and boulders\napparently erratic, dislodged or washed down from the upper heights,\nwhere similar masses are seen. Many are scattered, as if by an eruption;\nothers lie in slab or dome shape upon the shore. The shape is usually\nspheroidal, and the material hypersthene (a hard and close-grained\nbluish granite) or diorite, greenstone-trap blackened by sun and\nrain. In the few cuttings of the higher levels I afterwards remarked\nthat detached ’hardheads’ are puddinged into the friable laterite; but I\nnowhere found the granitic floor-rock protruding above ground. The\nboulders are treated by ditching and surrounding with a hot fire for\nforty-eight hours; cold water, not vinegar, is then poured upon them,\nand causes the heated material suddenly to contract and fracture, when\nit can easily be removed. Magnetic iron also occurs, and specimens have\nbeen sent to England; but veins have not yet been discovered.",
        "Our walk had furnished us with a tolerable idea of ’the city’s’ plan,\nwithout referring to the printed affair. Fronting north with westing, it\nis divided into squares, blocks, and insulae, after the fashion of a\nchessboard. This is one of the oldest as well as the newest mode of\ndistributions. The temples of the classical gods, being centrally\nsituated, required for general view broad, straight approaches. From\nWashington to Buenos Ayres the modern cities of the New World have\nreverted to this ancient system without other reason but a love of\nregularity and simplicity. Here the longer streets flank the sea and the\nshorter run at right angles up the inner slopes. Both are bright red\nlines worn in the vegetation between the houses. The ribbons of green\nare the American or Bahama grass; fine, silky, and creeping along the\nground, it is used to stuff mattresses, and it forms a good substitute\nfor turf. When first imported it was neglected, cut away, and nearly\nkilled out; now it is encouraged, because its velvety plots relieve the\nglaring red surface, it keeps off the ’bush,’ and it clears the surface\nof all other vegetation. Looking upon the city below, we were surprised\nto see the dilapidation of the tenements. Some have tumbled down; others\nwere tumbling down; many of those standing were lumber or board shanties\ncalled ’quarter-frames’ and ’ground-floors;’ sundry large piles rose\ngrisly and fire-charred, and the few good houses looked quite\nmodern. But what can be expected in a place where Europeans never expect\nto outstay the second year, and where Africans, who never yet worked\nwithout compulsion, cannot legally be compelled to work?",
        "We then walked up to Government House, the Fort Thornton of old charts,\nwhose roof, seen from the sea, barely tops the dense curtain of tree and\nshrubbery that girds and hangs around it. Passing under a cool and shady\navenue of mangoes and figs, and the archway, guarded by a porter’s lodge\nand a detachment of the three hundred local police, we came in sight of\nthe large, rambling residence, built piecemeal, like many an English\ncountry-house. There is little to recommend it save the fine view of the\nsea and the surrounding shrubbery-ground. I can well understand how,\nwith the immense variety of flower and fruit suddenly presented to his\neyes, the gentleman fresh from England required six months to recover\nthe free and full use of all his senses and faculties.",
        "A policeman–no longer a Zouave of the West Indian corps–took in our\ncards, and we introduced ourselves to Captain A. E. Havelock,\n’Governor-in-Chief of Sierra Leone and the Gambia.’ He is No. 47 since\nCaptain Day, R.N., first ruled in A.D. 1803. I had much to say to him\nabout sundry of his predecessors. Captain Havelock, who dates only from\n1881, has the reputation of being slightly ’black.’ The Neri and the\nBianchi factions here represent the Buffs and Blues of a land further\nnorth. He is yet in the heyday of popularity, when, in the consecrated\nphrase, the ruler ’gains golden opinions.’ But colonial judgments are\nfickle, and mostly in extremes. After this smiling season the weather\nlowers, the storm breaks, and all is elemental rage, when from being a\nmanner of demigod the unhappy ruler gradually becomes one of the\n’meanest and basest of men.’ Absit omen!",
        "We returned at sunset to Government House and spent a pleasant\nevening. The ’smokes’ had vanished, and with them the frowse and\nhomeliness of morning. The sun, with rays of lilac red, set over a\npanorama of townlet, land, and sea, to which distance added many a\ncharm. Mingling afar with the misty horizon, the nearer waters threw\nout, by their golden and silvery sheen, the headlands, capes, and\ntongues stretching in long perspective below, while the Sugarloaf,\nfather of mountains, rose in solitary grandeur high above his subject\nhills. On the nearer slope of Signal Hill we saw the first of the\ndestructive bush-burnings. They are like prairie-fires in these lands,\nand sometimes they gird Freetown with a wall of flame. Complexion is all\nin all to Sá Leone, and she showed for a few moments a truly beautiful\nprospect.",
        "The Governor has had the courage to bring out Mrs. Havelock, and she has\nhad the courage to stand firm against a rainy season. The climate is\nsimply the worst on the West Coast, despite the active measures of\nsanitation lately taken, the Department of Public Health, the ordinances\nof the Colonial Government in 1879, and the excellent water with which\nthe station is now provided. On a clear sunny day the charnel-house, I\nrepeat, is lovely, mais c’est la mort; it is the terrible beauty\nof death. Mrs. Melville says, with full truth, ’I felt amidst all the\nglory of tropic sunlight and everlasting verdure a sort of ineffable\ndread connected with the climate.’ Even when leaving the ’pestilent\nshore’ she was ’haunted by the shadowy presence.’ This is womanly, but a\nlittle reflection must suggest it to man.",
        "Even half a century ago opinions differed concerning the climate of the\ncolony. Dr. Madden could obtain only contradictory accounts. [Footnote:\nSee Wanderings in West Africa, for details, vol. i. p. 275.]\nThere is a tradition of a Chief Justice applying to the Colonial Office\nfor information touching his pension, the clerks could not answer him,\nand he presently found that none of his predecessors had lived to claim\nit. Mr. Judge Rankin was of opinion that its ill-fame was maintained by\n’policy on the one hand and by ignorance of truth on the other.’ But\nMr. Judge died a few days after. So with Dr. Macpherson, of the African\nColonial Corps. It appears ill-omened to praise the place; and, after\nrepeated visits to it, I no longer wonder that the ’Medical Gazette’ of\nApril 14, 1838, affirmed, ’No statistical writer has yet tried to give\nthe minutest fraction representing the chance of a surgeon’s return from\nSierra Leone.’",
        "On the other hand, Mrs. Falconbridge, whose husband was sent out from\nEngland on colonial business in 1791, and who wrote the first ’lady’s\nbook’ upon the Coast, pointed out at the beginning that sickness was due\nquite as much to want of care as to the climate. In 1830 Mr. John\nCormack, merchant and resident since 1800, stated to a Committee of the\nHouse of Commons that out of twenty-six Europeans in his service seven\nhad died, seven had remained in Africa, and of twelve who returned to\nEngland all save two or three were in good health. We meet with a\nmedical opinion as early as 1836 that ’not one-fourth of the deaths\nresults merely from climate.’ Cases of old residents are quoted–for\ninstance, Governor Kenneth Macaulay, a younger brother of Zachary\nMacaulay, who resisted it for twenty years; Mr. Reffall for fifteen\nyears, and sundry other exceptions.",
        "In this section of the nineteenth century it is the custom to admit that\nthe climate is bad and dangerous; but that it has often been made the\nscape-goat of European recklessness and that much of the sickness and\ndeath might be avoided. The improvement is attributed to the use of\nquinine, unknown to the early settlers, and much is expected from\nsanatoria and from planting the blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus),\nwhich failed, owing to the carelessness and ignorance of the planters. A\npractical appreciation of the improvement is shown by the Star Life\nAssurance Society, which has reduced to five per cent. its former very\nheavy rates. Lastly, the bad health of foreigners is accounted for by\nthe fact that they leave their own country for a climate to which they\nare not accustomed, where the social life and the habits of the people\nare so different from their own, and yet that they continue doing all\nthings as in England.",
        "But how stand the facts at the white man’s Red Grave? Mrs. Havelock and\nthe wife of the officer commanding the garrison are the only Europeans\nin the colony, whereas a score of years ago I remember half a\ndozen. Even the warmest apologisers for the climate will not expose\ntheir wives to it, preferring to leave them at home or in\nMadeira. During last March there were five deaths of white men–that is,\nmore than a third–out of a total of 163. What would the worst of\nEnglish colonies say to a mortality of 350 per thousand per annum? Of\ncourse we are told that it is exceptional, and the case of the insurance\nsocieties is quoted. But they forget to tell us the reason. A mail\nsteamer now calls at Freetown once a week, and the invalid is sent home\nby the first opportunity. Similarly a silly East Indian statistician\nproved, from the rare occurrence of fatal cases, Aden to be one of the\nhealthiest stations under ’the Company.’ He ignored the fact that even a\nscratch justified the surgeons in shipping a man off on sick leave.",
        "I quite agree with the view of Mr. Frederick Evans: [Footnotes: The\nColonies and India, Dec. 24, 1881.] ’Let anyone anxious to test the\nnature of the climate go to Kew Gardens and sit for a week or two in one\nof the tropical houses there; he may be assured that he will by no means\nfeel in robust health when he leaves.’ The simile is perfect. Europeans\nliving in Africa like Europeans as regards clothing and diet are, I\nbelieve, quite right. We tried grass-cloth, instead of broadcloth, in\nWestern India, when general rheumatism was the result. In the matter of\nmeat and drink the Englishman cannot do better than adhere to his old\nmode of life as much as possible, with a few small modifications. Let\nhim return to the meal-times of Queen Elizabeth’s day–",
        "and especially shun the 9 A.M. breakfast, which leads to a heavy tiffin\nat 1 P.M., the hottest and most trying section of the day. With respect\nto diet, if he drinks a bottle of claret in England let him reduce\nhimself in Africa to a pint ’cut’ with, water; if he eats a pound of\nmeat he should be contented with eight ounces and an extra quantity of\nfruit and vegetables. In medicine let him halve his cathartics and\ndouble his dose of tonics.",
        "From its topographical as well as its geographical position the climate\nof Freetown is oppressively hot, damp, and muggy. The annual mean is\n79.5° Fahr.; the usual temperature of the dwellings is from 78° to 86°\nFahr. Its year is divided into two seasons, the Dries and the Rains. The\nwet season begins in May and ends with November; for the last five years\nthe average downfall has been 155 inches, five times greater than in\nrainy England. These five months are times of extreme discomfort. The\ndamp heat, despite charcoal fires in the houses and offices, mildews\neverything–clothes, weapons, books, man himself. It seems to exhaust\nall the positive electricity of the nervous system, and it makes the\npatient feel utterly miserable. It also fills the air with noxious\nvapours during the short bursts of sunshine perpendicularly rained down,\nand breeds a hateful brood of what the Portuguese call immundicies–a\nfoul ’insect-youth.’ Only the oldest residents prefer the wet to the dry\nmonths. The Rains end in the sickliest season of the year, when the sun,\nnow getting the upper hand, sucks the miasmatic vapours from the soil\nand distributes them to mankind in the shape of ague and fever,\ndysentery, and a host of diseases. The Dries last from November to\nApril, often beginning with tornadoes and ending with the Harmatan,\nsmokes or scirocco. The climate is then not unlike Bombay, except that\nit lacks the mild East Indian attempt at a winter, and that barometric\npressure hardly varies.",
        "During my last visit to Sá Leone I secured a boat, and, accompanied by\nDr. Lovegrove, of the A.S.S. Armenian, set out to inspect the\nlower bed of the Rokel and the islands which it waters. Passing along\nFourah Bay, we remarked in the high background a fine brook, cold,\nclear, and pure, affording a delicious bath; it is almost dry in the\nDries, and swells to a fiumara during the Rains. Its extent was then a\ndiminutive rivulet tumbling some hundreds of feet down a shelving bed\ninto Granville Bay, the break beyond Fourah. On the way we passed\nseveral Timni boats, carrying a proportionately immense amount of\n’muslin.’ Of old the lords of the land, they still come down the river\nwith rice and cocoa-nuts from the Kwiah (Quiah) country, from Porto\nLoko, from Waterloo, and other places up stream. They not unfrequently\nconsole themselves for their losses by a little hard fighting; witness\ntheir defence of the Modúka stockade in 1861, when four officers and\ntwenty-three of our men were wounded. [Footnote: Wanderings in West\nAfrica, vol. i pp. 246-47.] Some of the boats are heavy row-barges\nwith a framework of sticks for a stern-awning; an old Mandenga, with\ncottony beard, sits at each helm. They row simplices munditiis.\nAt Sá Leone men are punished for not wearing overalls, and\nthus the ’city’ becomes a rag-fair. The Timni men are dark negroids\nwith the slightest infusion of Semitic blood; some had coated their\neyebrows and part of their faces with chalk for ophthalmia. They\nappeared to be merry fellows enough; and they are certainly the only men\nin the colony who ever pretend to work. A Government official harshly\nsays of them, ’I would willingly ascribe to the nearest of our\nneighbours and their representatives in Freetown, of whom there are\nmany, some virtues if they possessed any; but, unfortunately, taken as a\npeople, they have been truly described by able and observant writers as\ndishonest and depraved.’ Mr. Secretary evidently forgets the\n’civilising’ and infectious example of Sá Leone, versus the\nculture of El-Islam.",
        "Arrived at Bishopscourt, we disembarked and visited the place. Here in\nold days ’satisfaction’ was given and taken; and a satirical medico\ndeclared that forty years of rencontres had not produced a single\ncasualty. He was more witty than wise; I heard of one gentleman who had\nbeen ’paraded’ and ’winged.’ Old Granville Town, which named the bay,\nhas completely disappeared; the ruins of the last house are gone from\nthe broad grassy shelf upon which the first colonists built their homes.",
        "From Granville Bay the traveller may return by the ’Kissy Road.’ Once it\nwas the pet promenade, the Corso, the show-walk of Freetown; now it has\nbecome a Tottenham Court Road, to which Water, Oxford, and Westmoreland\nStreets are preferred. The vegetation becomes splendid, running up to\nthe feet of the hills, which swell suddenly from the shelf-plain. The\napproach to Sá Leone is heralded by a row of shops even smaller and\nmeaner than those near the market-place. There are whole streets of\nthese rabbit-hutches, whose contents ’mammy,’ when day is done, carries\nhome in a ’bly’-basket upon her head, possibly leaving ’titty’ to mount\nguard upon the remnant. The stock in trade may represent a capital of\n4l., and the profits 1s. a day. Yet ’daddy’ styles himself\nmerchant, gets credit, and spends his evenings conversing and smoking\ncigars–as a gentleman should–with his commercial friends.",
        "Passing the easternmost end of the peninsula, and sailing along the\nBullom (’lowland’) shores, we verified Dr. Blyden’s assertion that this\n’home of fevers’ shows no outward and visible sign of exceeding\nunhealthiness. The soil is sandy, the bush is comparatively thin, and\nthe tall trees give it the aspect of a high and dry land. We then turned\nnorth-east and skirted Tasso Island, a strip of river-holm girt with a\nwall of mangroves. It had an old English fort, founded in 1695; the\nfactors traded with the Pulo (Fulah) country for slaves, ivory, and\ngold. It was abandoned after being taken by Van Ruyter, when he restored\nto the Dutch West Indian Company the conquests of Commodore Holmes. The\nrich soil in 1800 supported a fine cotton plantation, and here\nMr. Heddle kept a ’factory.’ The villagers turned out to gaze, not\nhabited like the Wolofs of Albreda, but clad in shady hats and seedy\npantaloons.",
        "After clearing Tasso we advanced merrily, and at the end of two hours’\nand a half actual sailing and pulling we landed upon Bance, which some\ncall Bence’s Island. A ruined jetty with two rusty guns, buried like\nposts, projected from the sand-strip; and a battery, where nine cannon\nstill linger, defended the approach. There is a similar beach to the\nnorth-east, with admirable bathing in the tepid, brackish waves and a\nfine view of the long leonine Sierra. The outlying rocks, capped with\nguano, look like moored boats and awnings. The sea-breeze was delicious;\nthe lapping, dazzling stream made sweet music, and the huge cotton-trees\nwith laminar buttresses gave most grateful shade.",
        "The island resembles Gambian James multiplied by four or five. Behind\nthe battery are the ruins of a huge building, like the palaces of old\nGoa, vast rooms, magazines, barracoons, underground vaults, and all\nmanner of contrivances for the good comfort and entertainment of the\nslaver and the slave. A fine promenade of laterite, which everywhere\nabout Sá Leone builds the best of roads, and a strip of jungle rich in\nthe Guilandina Bonduc, whose medicinal properties are well known\nto the people, leads to the long-deserted graveyard. We pass an old well\nwith water thirty-five feet deep, and enter the enceinte, that\ncontains four tombs; the marble tablets, which would soon disappear in\nIndia for the benefit of curry-stuffs, here remain intact. One long home\nwas tenanted by ’Thomas Knight, Esquire, born in the county of Surrey,\nwho acted eighteen years as agent for the proprietors of this island,\nand who died on August 27 of 1785,’ beloved, of course, by\neverybody. Second came the ’honourable sea-Captain Hiort, born in 1746,\nmarried in 1771 to the virtuous lady Catherine Schive, and died in 1783,\nleaving two good-natured daughters, which his soul is in the hands of\nGod.’ The third was Mr. John Tittle, who departed life in 1776; and the\nlast was Captain Josiah Dory, a ’man of upright character,’ who\nmigrated to the many in 1765.",
        "Barbot (ii. 1) describes Bance’s Island as defended by a small fort on a\nsteep rock of difficult access, ascended only by a sort of stairs cut in\nthe stone, and acting as the store-house of the Royal African\nCompany. The low walls of lime and ashlar had a round ’flanker’ with\nfive guns, a curtain with embrasures for four large cannon, and a\nplatform just before it for six guns, all well mounted. The only good\nbuildings were the slave-booths. Winterbottom, who places it over\neighteen miles above St. George’s Bay (Baie de France) and north\nof Tasso Island, thus describes Bance: ’This is a small barren island\nconsiderably elevated, with a dry, gravelly soil; but being placed as it\nwere in the midst of an archipelago of low marshy islands, the breeze,\nfrom whatever quarter it blows, is impregnated with moisture and marsh\neffluvia, which render it sickly. The air also is very much heated, and\nthe thermometer generally stands 4° or 5° higher on this island than it\ndoes at Freetown.’",
        "We regained the steamer shortly after dark, delighted with our picnic\nand resolved always to take the same advantage of all halts. In those\ndays the interior was most interesting. The rivers Scarcies, Nunez, and\nPonga were unknown; the equestrian Susu tribe had never been visited;\nand, the Timbo country, the great centre whence arise the Niger, the\nRokel, and the Senegal, awaited exploration.",
