        "On the morning of July 1st, the dismounted cavalry, including my\nregiment, stormed Kettle Hill, driving the Spaniards from their\ntrenches. After taking the crest, I made the men under me turn and\nbegin volley-firing at the San Juan Blockhouse and intrenchments\nagainst which Hawkins’ and Kent’s Infantry were advancing. While thus\nfiring, there suddenly smote on our ears a peculiar drumming sound.\nOne or two of the men cried out, “The Spanish machine guns!” but,\nafter listening a moment, I leaped to my feet and called, “It’s the\nGatlings, men! It’s our Gatlings!” Immediately the troopers began to\ncheer lustily, for the sound was most inspiring. Whenever the drumming\nstopped, it was only to open again a little nearer the front. Our\nartillery, using black powder, had not been able to stand within range\nof the Spanish rifles, but it was perfectly evident that the Gatlings\nwere troubled by no such consideration, for they were advancing all\nthe while.",
        "Soon the infantry took San Juan Hill, and, after one false start, we\nin turn rushed the next line of block-houses and intrenchments, and\nthen swung to the left and took the chain of hills immediately\nfronting Santiago. Here I found myself on the extreme front, in\ncommand of the fragments of all six regiments of the cavalry division.\nI received orders to halt where I was, but to hold the hill at all\nhazards. The Spaniards were heavily reinforced and they opened a\ntremendous fire upon us from their batteries and trenches. We laid\ndown just behind the gentle crest of the hill, firing as we got the\nchance, but, for the most part, taking the fire without responding. As\nthe afternoon wore on, however, the Spaniards became bolder, and made\nan attack upon the position. They did not push it home, but they did\nadvance, their firing being redoubled. We at once ran forward to the\ncrest and opened on them, and, as we did so, the unmistakable drumming\nof the Gatlings opened abreast of us, to our right, and the men\ncheered again. As soon as the attack was definitely repulsed, I\nstrolled over to find out about the Gatlings, and there I found Lieut.\nParker with two of his guns right on our left, abreast of our men, who\nat that time were closer to the Spaniards than any others.",
        "From thence on, Parker’s Gatlings were our inseparable companions\nthroughout the siege. They were right up at the front. When we dug our\ntrenches, he took off the wheels of his guns and put them in the\ntrenches. His men and ours slept in the same bomb-proofs and shared\nwith one another whenever either side got a supply of beans or coffee\nand sugar. At no hour of the day or night was Parker anywhere but\nwhere we wished him to be, in the event of an attack. If a troop of my\nregiment was sent off to guard some road or some break in the lines,\nwe were almost certain to get Parker to send a Gatling along, and,\nwhether the change was made by day or by night, the Gatling went.\nSometimes we took the initiative and started to quell the fire of the\nSpanish trenches; sometimes they opened upon us; but, at whatever hour\nof the twenty-four the fighting began, the drumming of the Gatlings\nwas soon heard through the cracking of our own carbines.",
        "I have had too little experience to make my judgment final; but\ncertainly, if I were to command either a regiment or a brigade,\nwhether of cavalry or infantry, I would try to get a Gatling\nbattery–under a good man–with me. I feel sure that the greatest\npossible assistance would be rendered, under almost all circumstances,\nby such a Gatling battery, if well handled; for I believe that it\ncould be pushed fairly to the front of the firing-line. At any rate,\nthis is the way that Lieut. Parker used his battery when he went into\naction at San Juan, and when he kept it in the trenches beside the\nRough Riders before Santiago.",

        "The history of the Gatling Gun Detachment, Fifth Army Corps, is to a\ncertain extent the history of the Santiago campaign. The detachment\nwas organized on the spur of the moment, to utilize material which\nwould otherwise have been useless, and was with the Fifth Corps in all\nthe campaign. It participated in all the fighting of that campaign,\nexcept the fight at La Guasimas, and was disbanded upon the return of\nthe Fifth Corps to Montauk. Whatever hardships were endured by the\nFifth Corps were shared by this detachment; whatever dangers were\nfaced by the Fifth Corps were faced by it also; where the hottest\nfighting occurred this detachment went in and stayed; and at the\nsurrender it was paraded, to use the words of General Shafter, “Upon\nthat portion of the line which it occupied so promptly and defended so\nwell.”",
        "But this memoir is not intended as a history of that campaign nor of\nthe Fifth Corps. The author has not the data available to cover so\nlarge a field, nor the ability to do justice to the courage,\nfortitude, and endurance so heroically displayed by that gallant army.\nThat story will be written by abler pens, and will be the wonder of\nthe world when it is told.",
        "This story is that of an experiment. It is told to lay before the\ngeneral public, as well as the military critic, the work of a little\ndetachment of thirty-seven men, armed with an untried weapon,\norganized in the short space of four days preceding July 1, 1898, and\nwhich without proper equipment, adequate instruction, or previous\ntraining, in the face of discouragements and sneers, and in spite of\nobstacles enough to make the mere retrospect sickening, still achieved\nfor itself a warm place in the hearts of all true soldiers, and\ncovered itself with glory upon the hardest fought battle-field of the\nHispano-American War.",
        "This story is to commemorate the gallantry of the enlisted men who\nhelped to make history and revolutionize tactics at Santiago. It will\ntell of the heroism of the plain American Regular, who, without hope\nof preferment or possibility of reward, boldly undertook to confute\nthe erroneous theories of military compilers, who, without originality\nor reason, have unblushingly cribbed the labored efforts of foreign\nofficers, and foisted these compilations of second-hand opinions upon\nthe American Army as military text-books of authority and weight.\nThese literary soldiers declared, following the lead of their foreign\nguides, that “The value of machine guns on the battle-field is\ndoubtful,” and that “Their offensive value is probably very small.\"\nThey also agreed, with most touching unanimity, that “A direct assault\nupon a fortified position, occupied by good, unshaken infantry, armed\nwith the modern rifle and plentifully supplied with ammunition is sure\nto fail, unless made by overwhelming numbers and prepared by strong\nand accurate fire by artillery.”",
        "These servile imitators of foreign pen soldiers were destined to see\nall their pet theories exploded by the grim old mountain puma from\nCalifornia and his brave Fifth Corps. They were to learn, so far as\nthey are capable of learning, that the American Regular makes tactics\nas he needs them; that the rules of war established by pen soldiers do\nnot form the basis of actual operations in the field; that theories\nmust go to the wall before the stern logic of irrefutable facts; and\nthat deductions based on the drill-made automatons of European armies\nare not applicable to an army composed of American Volunteer Regulars,\nled by our trained officers.",
        "We shall see that an army destitute of cavalry, and hence without\n\"eyes\"; not supported by artillery; in the most difficult country over\nwhich soldiers ever operated, and without maps or reconnaissance–in\ntwenty days shut up and captured an army of twice its own effective\nstrength, in a strongly fortified city, with better served and more\nnumerous artillery.",
        "We shall find that when the “sledge” was not at hand, American\ningenuity was able to use the “mallet” instead, making light machine\nguns perform all the function of artillery, and dispensing altogether,\nso far as any practical results were concerned, with that expensive\nand much overrated arm; that the Regular private is capable of meeting\nall demands upon his intelligence, and that the American non. com. is\nthe superior of foreign officers.",
        "It is also hoped to place before the intelligent American public some\ncorrect ideas of the new arm which was tried thoroughly at Santiago\nfor the first time in the history of the world. The machine gun is the\nlatest practical product of American inventive genius applied to war.\nThe first form of this weapon tried, the mitrailleuse, was not very\nsuccessful. It failed, not on account of faults of construction, or\nimperfect mechanism, but because its proper tactical employment had\nnot been thought out by the French army. Since that time machine guns\nhave been greatly improved, but no one has succeeded in making their\ngreat value appreciated by military authorities. The failures of the\nFrench brought the gun into disfavor, and created a prejudice against\nits employment.",
        "The Artillery of the world, which poses in every country as an\nelite body of scientific fighters, and is often found on the\nbattle-field to be an aggregation of abstruse theorists, were jealous\nand contemptuous. They said, “See how easily the artillery knocked out\nmachine guns at Gravelotte.” The Cavalry of the world, famous\neverywhere for an esprit-du-corps which looks haughtily down on\nall other arms of the service, were too deeply absorbed in the merits\nof saber vs. revolver, and in the proper length of their\nspectacular plumes, to give a second thought to this new, untried, and\ntherefore worthless weapon. The world’s Infantry, resting upon the\nassumption that it is the backbone of all armies, and the only real,\nreliable fighting body under all conditions, left the consideration of\nthese vague dreams of mechanical destructiveness to lunatics, cranks,\nand philanthropists.",
        "In our own country the Ordnance Department, which is the trial court\nbefore which all military inventions must appear, scouted the idea of\nusefulness of machine guns even after war was declared, and adhered to\nthe view that machine guns, in the very nature of things, could never\nbe useful except in the defense of fortified positions; that they\nnever could be brought up on the battlefield, nor used if they were\nbrought up. This view was that of a prominent young officer of that\ndepartment who wrote a report on the subject, and it seemed to express\nthe views of the department.",
        "This view must have been that of our War Department, for it did not\neven acknowledge the receipt of drawings and specifications for a\nmachine gun carriage, offered freely to the Government as a gift by\nthe inventor six months before the war, together with the first\ncorrect tactical outline of the proper use of machine guns ever filed\nin any War Office in the world. This invention was designed to\nfacilitate the use of the machine gun by making its advance with the\nskirmish line possible on the offensive, and was recommended by the\nwhole staff of the Infantry and Cavalry School as a meritorious\ndevice, worthy of trial. The discussion filed with the invention\npointed out, for the first time, the correct tactical employment of\nthe weapon, and staked the military reputation and ability of the\nauthor and inventor on the correctness of his views.",
        "From these facts it may be gathered that there was required a certain\ndegree of originality and energy to get together and organize a\nmachine gun battery for the Santiago campaign.",
        "The project was conceived and executed. The service rendered by this\nbattery has forever set at rest the question of the proper tactical\nuse of the machine gun arm, both on the offensive and defensive. These\nthings are now beyond the realm of theory. They are a demonstrated\nproblem. The solution is universally acknowledged to be correct.",
        "This is the history of that detachment.",
        "From the 26th of April until the 6th of June, Tampa and Port Tampa\nwere the military centers of greatest interest in the United States.\nTroops were rushed into these places on special trains and camped on\navailable sites, pending the organization of a proposed expedition\nto–somewhere. Supplies of every description came pouring in on long\ntrains of express and freight cars; mounted officers and orderlies\nploughed their rushing way through great heaps and dunes of\never-shifting sand, leaving behind them stifling clouds of\nscintillating particles, which filtered through every conceivable\ncrevice and made the effort to breathe a suffocating nightmare. Over\nall the tumultuous scene a torrid sun beat down from a cloudless sky,\nwhile its scorching rays, reflected from the fierce sand under foot,\nproduced a heat so intolerable that even the tropical vegetation\nlooked withered and dying. In this climate officers and men, gathered\nmostly from Northern posts, were to “acclimate” themselves for a\ntropical campaign–somewhere.",
        "They never encountered as deadly a heat, nor a more pernicious\nclimate, in Cuba nor in Porto Rico, than that of southern Florida. Its\nfirst effect upon men just emerging from a bracing Northern winter was\nakin to prostration. Then began to follow a decided tendency to\nlanguor; after this one was liable to sudden attacks of bowel\ntroubles. The deadly malaria began to insidiously prepare the way for\na hospital cot; the patient lost flesh, relish of food became a\nreminiscence, and an hour’s exertion in the sun was enough to put a\nman on his back for the rest of the day. Exposure to the direct action\nof the sun’s rays was frequently followed by nausea, a slight chill,\nand then a high fever. The doctors subsequently called this “thermal\nfever,” which is suspected to be a high-sounding name calculated to\ncover up a very dense ignorance of the nature of the disease, because\nno one ever obtained any relief from it from them. Recurrence of the\nexposure brought recurrence of the fever, and, if persisted in,\nfinally produced a severe illness.",
        "One reason for this was that the troops continued to wear the winter\nclothing they had worn on their arrival. The promised “khaki” did not\nmaterialize. Some regiments drew the brown canvas fatigue uniform, but\nthe only use made of it was to put the white blanket-roll through the\nlegs of the trousers, thereby adding to the weight of the roll,\nwithout perceptible benefit to the soldier.",
        "Such a climate, under such surroundings, was not conducive to original\nthought, prolonged exertion, or sustained study. Everybody felt “mean\"\nand was eager for a change. Nobody wanted to listen to any new\nschemes. The highest ambition seemed to be to get out of it to\nsomewhere with just as little delay and exertion as possible. It was\nat this juncture that the plan of organizing a Gatling gun battery was\nconceived, and the attempt to obtain authority began.",
        "The Gatling gun is one of the two machine guns adopted in the land\nservice of the United States. Not to enter into a technical\ndescription, but merely to convey a general idea of its working and\nuses, it may be described as follows:",
        "The gun is a cluster of rifle barrels, without stocks, arranged around\na rod, and parallel to it. Each barrel has its own lock or bolt, and\nthe whole cluster can be made to revolve by turning a crank. The bolts\nare all covered in a brass case at the breech, and the machine is\nloaded by means of a vertical groove in which cartridges are placed,\ntwenty at a time, and from which they fall into the receivers one at a\ntime. As the cluster of barrels revolves each one is fired at the\nlowest point, and reloaded as it completes the revolution. The gun is\nmounted on a wye-shaped trunnion; the lower end of the wye passes down\ninto a socket in the axle. The gun is pointed by a lever just as one\npoints a garden hose or sprinkler, with the advantage that the gun can\nbe clamped at any instant, and will then continue to sprinkle its\ndrops of death over the same row of plants until the clamps are\nreleased. The axle is hollow and will hold about a thousand\ncartridges. It is horizontal, and on its ends are heavy Archibald\nwheels. There is also a heavy hollow trail, in which tools and\nadditional ammunition can be stored. The limber resembles that used by\nthe Artillery, and is capable of carrying about 9600 rounds of\ncartridges. The whole gun, thus mounted, can be drawn by two mules,\nand worked to good advantage by from six to eight men. It is built of\nvarious calibers, and can fire from 300 to 900 shots per minute. The\nguns used by the Gatling Gun Detachment, Fifth Army Corps, were built\nby the Colt’s Arms Co., were the latest improved model, long\nten-barrel gun, and fired the Krag-Jorgenson ammunition used by the\nRegular Army.",
        "The attempt to obtain authority to organize a machine gun battery met\nwith many discouragements and repeated failures. No one seemed to have\nthought anything about the subject, and Tampa was not a good place nor\nclimate in which to indulge in that form of exercise, apparently.\nPerhaps the climate was one reason why so little thinking was done,\nand everything went “at sixes and sevens.”",
        "The officer who had conceived the scheme was a young man, too. He was\nonly a second lieutenant (\"Second lieutenants are fit for nothing\nexcept to take reveille”), and had never, so far as his military\nsuperiors knew, heard the whistle of a hostile bullet. He had made no\nbrilliant record at the Academy, had never distinguished himself in\nthe service, and was not anybody’s “pet.” He was, apparently, a safe\nman to ignore or snub if occasion or bad temper made it desirable to\nignore or snub somebody, and, above all, had no political friends who\nwould be offended thereby.",
        "“Politics” cut quite a figure in Tampa in some respects. An officer\nwho was known to be a personal friend of Senator Somebody, or protege\nof this or that great man, was regarded with considerable awe and\nreverence by the common herd. It was ludicrous to see the weight\nattached to the crumbs of wisdom that fell from the friends of the\nfriends of somebody. They shone only by a reflected light, it is true;\nbut nobody there at Tampa had a lamp of his own, except the few who\nhad won renown in the Civil War, and reflected light was better than\nnone at all. A very young and green second lieutenant who was able to\nboast that he had declined to be a major in a certain State was at\nonce an oracle to other lieutenants–and to some who were not\nlieutenants. The policy which governed these appointments was not so\nwell understood at that date in the campaign as it is now.",
        "When the court of a reigning favorite was established at the Tampa Bay\nHotel as a brigadier, and people began to get themselves a little\nsettled into the idea that they knew who was in command, they were\nsuddenly disillusioned by the appointment of another and senior\nbrigadier to the command. They settled down to get acquainted with the\nnew authority, and were just beginning to find out who was who, when\nthe telegraph flashed the news that the deposed potentate had been\nmade a major-general, and, of course, was now in command. The thing\nwas becoming interesting. Bets began to be made as to which would come\nin ahead under the wire. The other also became a major-general. Then\ncame a period of uncertainty, because the question of rank hinged upon\nsome obscure and musty record of forgotten service some thirty-four\nyears before. From these facts will be apparent the difficulty under\nwhich a subordinate labored in trying to create anything.",
        "It is hardly worth while in any case of that sort to waste time with\nsubordinates. The projector of an enterprise had better go straight to\nthe one who has the necessary authority to order what is wanted; if\naccess to him can be had, and he can be brought to recognize the\nmerits of the plan–that settles it; if not–that also settles it. In\neither case the matter becomes a settled thing, and one knows what to\ndepend upon.",
        "But who was the man to see there at Tampa? Nobody knew.",
        "The first officer approached was the one in direct line of\nsuperiority, Col. A. T. Smith, 13th Infantry. The idea was to\nascertain his views and try to obtain from him a favorable endorsement\nupon a written plan to be submitted through military channels to the\ncommanding general at Tampa. Perhaps it was the deadly climate; for\nthe reply to a request for a few minutes’ audience on the subject of\nmachine guns was very gruff and curt: “I don’t want to hear anything\nabout it. I don’t believe in it, and I don’t feel like hearing it. If\nyou want to see me about this subject, come to me in office hours.\"\nThat settled it. Any effort to get a written plan through would have\nto carry the weight of official disapproval from the start, and even a\n\"shavey” knows that disapproval at the start is enough to kill a paper\nin the official routine.",
        "The next officers approached were Major William Auman and Capt. H.\nCavanaugh, of the 13th Infantry, who were asked for advice. These two\nofficers, both of whom rendered very distinguished services on the\nbattle-field, listened with interest and were convinced. Their advice\nwas: “Get your plan in tangible shape, typewritten, showing just what\nyou propose; then go straight to the commanding general himself. If he\nlistens to you, he will be the responsible party, and will have waived\nthe informality; if he will not receive you, no harm is done.”",
        "This advice was followed and the following plan prepared:",
        "Scheme for Organization of Division Galling Gun Detachment.\n\"Material:",
        "“Three guns with limbers and caissons; 28 horses and 16 saddles; 6\nsets double harness, wheel, and 6 lead; 1 escort wagon, team and\ndriver; and 100,000 rounds, .30 cal.",
        "“Personnel:",
        "“One first lieutenant, 3 sergeants, 3 corporals, 1 clerk, 1 cook, and\n35 enlisted men selected for their intelligence, activity, and daring;\nvolunteers, if possible to be obtained, as the service will be\nhazardous.",
        "“Equipment:",
        "“Officer: Revolver, saber, or machete, and field-glass.",
        "“Enlisted men: Revolver and knife.",
        "“Fifty rounds to be carried on person for revolver, and 50 in ordnance\ntrain.",
        "“Camp Equipage:",
        "“Four conical wall-tents, 2 ’A’ wall-tents, and the ordinary cooking\noutfit for a company of 41 men.",
        "“Organization:",
        "“In the discretion of the detachment commander, subject to approval of\ndivision commander; probably as follows, subject to modifications by\nexperience:",
        "“Three detachments under a sergeant. A detachment to be composed of 1\ngunner and 7 men. The gunner should be a corporal.",
        "“Administration:",
        "“The Division Gatling Gun Detachment to be subject only to the orders\nof the division commander, or higher authority. Its members are\ncarried on ’d. s.’ in their respective organizations. Its commander\nexercises over it the same authority as a company commander, and keeps\nthe same records. Returns, reports, and other business are transacted\nas in company, except that the detachment commander reports directly\nto and receives orders directly from Division Headquarters. The\ndetachment is not subject to ordinary guard or fatigue. When used as\npart of a guard, whole detachments go with their pieces.",
        "“Instruction:",
        "“The organization is purely experimental; hence the greatest possible\nlatitude must be allowed the detachment commander, and he should be\nheld accountable for the results. He should not be subjected to the\norders or interference of any subordinates, however able, who have\nmade no special study of the tactical use or instruction for machine\nguns, and who may not have faith in the experiment. It will be useless\nto expect efficiency of the proposed organization unless this liberty\nbe accorded its organizer. The field is a new one, not yet well\ndiscussed by even the text-writers. Organization and instruction must\nbe largely experimental, subject to change as the result of\nexperience; but no change from the plans of the organizer should be\nmade except for good and sufficient reasons.",
        "“Tactical Employment:",
        "“This organization is expected to develop:",
        "  “(a) The fire-action of good infantry.",
        "  “(b) The mobility of cavalry.",
        "“Its qualities, therefore, must be rapidity and accuracy, both of fire\nand movement.",
        "“Its employment on the defensive is obvious. On the offensive it is\nexpected to be useful with advance guards, rear guards, outposts,\nraids, and in battle. The last use, novel as it is, will be most\nimportant of all. The flanks of the division can be secured by this\norganization, relieving reserves of this duty; it will give a\nstiffening to the line of support, and at every opportune occasion\nwill be pushed into action on the firing line. The moral effectof its presence will be very great; it will be able to render valuable\nassistance by its fire (over the charging line) in many cases. Last,\nbut very important, the occupation of a captured line by this\norganization at once will supply a powerful, concentrated, and\ncontrolled fire, either to repulse a counter-charge or to fire on a\ndiscomfited, retiring enemy. Being a horsed organization, it can\narrive at the critical point at the vital moment when, the defender’s\nfirst line having been thrust out, our line being disorganized, a\ncounter-charge by the enemy would be most effective, or controlled\nfire by our own troops on him would be most useful.",
        "“It is urged that this last use of machine guns is one of the most\nimportant functions, and one which has been overlooked by writers and\ntacticians.",
        "“There is one vital limitation upon the proposed organization; viz.,\nit must not be pitted against artillery.",
        "“It is urgently suggested that this organization can be perfected here\nand now without difficulty, while it will be very difficult to perfect\nafter the forward movement has begun. Horses and harness can be easily\nprocured at Tampa; there will be no difficulty if some energetic\nofficer be authorized to proceed with the work, and directed to attend\nto the details.",
        "“Believing earnestly in the utility of the proposed organization,\nwhich will convert useless impedimenta into a fourth arm, and\nrealizing the dangerous nature of the proposed service, I respectfully\noffer my services to carry these plans into effect.",
        "“John H. Parker,\n\"2d Lieut. 13th Infty.”",
        "With this plan well digested and with many a plausible argument in its\nfavor all thought out, Col. Arthur McArthur, assistant adjutant-general\nto Gen. Wade, who was at that moment in command, was approached.",
        "Col. McArthur was a very busy man. He was also a very business-like\nman, and one of handsome appearance, easy access, and pleasant\naddress. He sandwiched in a fifteen-minute interview between two\npressing engagements, and manifested both interest and approval. But\nnothing could be done at that time. “Come again a week from to-day,\"\nsaid he, “and I will try to obtain you a hearing before one who can do\nwhat you wish by a single word. I believe in your scheme and will help\nyou if I can.” The week rolled by and a change of commanding generals\noccurred. Gen. Wade was ordered away, taking McArthur with him, and no\nprogress had been made. It was discouraging.",
        "The next step in the plan was by lucky accident. Lieutenant (now\nLieut.-Col.) John T. Thompson, Ordnance Department, who was in charge\nof the Ordnance Depot at Tampa, accidentally met the would-be\nmachine-gun man, and was promptly buttonholed over a dish of ice\ncream. Thompson was himself a young man and a student. His department\nplaced an insuperable obstacle in the way of himself carrying out a\nplan which he, also, had conceived, and he was keen to see the idea,\nwhich he fully believed in, demonstrated on the battle-field. He had,\nmoreover, as ordnance officer, just received an invoice of fifteen\nGatling guns, complete, of the latest model, and he had access to the\ncommanding general by virtue of being a member of his staff. By reason\nof the terrible rush of overwork, he needed an assistant, and it\nseemed practicable to try to kill two birds with one stone. But all he\nsaid was, “I believe in the idea; I have long advocated it. It may be\npossible for me to get you your opportunity, and it may not. If so,\nyou will hear from the matter.”",
        "The attempt to get the thing going had been apparently abandoned,\nwhen, utterly without notice, the regimental commander received orders\nper letter, from Headquarters Fifth Army Corps, which resulted in the\nfollowing orders:",

        "“M. McFarland,\n\"1st Lieut. 13th Infty., Adjutant.”",
        "These men were selected by their company commanders. It is not known\nwhether the selections were made with a view to special fitness or\nnot. They had no notice that the detail was to be anything but a\ntransient character; in fact, one company commander actually detailed\nthe cook of his private mess, and was intensely disgusted when he\nfound that the detail was to be permanent or semi-permanent. The men\nwere sent fully armed and equipped; carrying rifles, knapsacks, etc.,\nand marched down to the Ordnance Depot for instructions. These\ninstructions were to return to camp, turn in their rifles, bayonets,\ncartridges, belts, and knapsacks, and return early the following\nmorning equipped with blanket-roll complete, haversack, and canteen.\nEach man, after full explanation of the hazardous duty, was given a\nchance to withdraw, but all volunteered to stay.",
        "The instructions were obeyed, and the Gatling Gun Detachment was\nborn–a pigmy.",
        "The Ordnance Depot at Tampa was located on Lafayette Street, at the\nend of the bridge over the river, next to the Tampa Bay Hotel. The\nriver washed the sides of the building, which was occupied by the\nTampa Athletic Club, and had formerly been used as a club-house. There\nwere two stories and a basement. The basement was nearly on a level\nwith the river, the main floor on a level with the bridge, and there\nwas also a spacious upper floor. The main floor was used for storage\nof light articles of ordnance; the basement for heavy articles and\nammunition. Hundreds of thousands of rounds of rifle and revolver ball\ncartridges, thousands of rounds of Hotchkiss fixed ammunition, and\nmany hundreds of pounds of powder charges for field artillery and\nmortars were here stored. Miscellaneous assortments were daily coming\nin, generally without any mark on the box by which to learn what were\nthe contents. The name of the arsenal, if from an arsenal, was usually\nstamped on the seal; generally there was no mark whatever to designate\nthe origin or contents of the many boxes which came from ordinary\nposts. The invoices came from a week to ten days behind or in advance\nof the arrival of the boxes, and there was not the slightest clue to\nbe gained from them. Consequently those who had to check up invoices\nand prepare for issues were at their wits’ end to keep things\nstraight. A requisition for so many articles would come in, duly\napproved; unless the boxes containing these articles happened to have\nbeen unpacked, it was uncertain whether they were on hand or not. No\nwholesale merchant of any sense would ship out boxes of goods without\nsome indication of their contents; but that was exactly what was done\nfrom all over the country to the Ordnance Depot at Tampa.",
        "The upper floor consisted of one large room. A rope railing was placed\naround it to preserve clear space around the desks. There were several\nof these for the ordnance officer and the various clerks. A chief\nclerk, an assistant clerk, a stenographer, and two ordnance sergeants\nlooked after the red tape. An overseer with four subordinates and a\ngang of negro stevedores attended to loading and unloading boxes,\nstoring them, counting out articles for issue or receipt, and such\nother duties as they were called on to perform. There was an old\njanitor named McGee, a veteran of the Civil War, whose business it was\nto look after the sweeping and keep the floors clean.",
        "Four guns in their original boxes were issued to the detachment on the\n27th of May. They were new, and apparently had never been assembled.\nOn assembling them it was found that the parts had been constructed\nwith such “scientific” accuracy that the use of a mallet was\nnecessary. The binder-box on the pointing lever was so tight that in\nattempting to depress the muzzle of the gun it was possible to lift\nthe trail off the ground before the binder-box would slide on the\nlever. The axis-pin had to be driven in and out with an axe, using a\nblock of wood, of course, to prevent battering. A truly pretty state\nof affairs for a gun the value of which depends on the ease with which\nit can be pointed in any direction.",
        "Inquiry after the war at the factory where the guns are made disclosed\nthe fact that these parts are rigidly tested by a gauge by the\nGovernment inspectors, and that looseness is regarded as a fatal\ndefect. Even play of half a hundredth of an inch is enough to insure\nthe rejection of a piece. The very first thing done by the Gatling Gun\nDetachment, upon assembling these guns, was to obtain a set of\narmorers’ tools and to file away these parts by hand until the aim of\nthe piece could be changed by the touch of a feather. The detachment\nwas ordered to rely upon the friction clutches for steadiness of aim,\nwhen necessary, and not upon the tight fit of the parts. It was\nordered that there must be no doubt whatever of easy, perfectly free\nmanipulation at any and all times, even if the pointing lever should\nbecome rusted. This precaution proved on July 1st to have been of\ngreat value.",
        "The instruction of the detachment began immediately, and consisted, at\nfirst, of unpacking, mounting, dismounting, and repacking the guns.\nThe four guns were mounted and a drill held each time in the loading\nand firing of the piece. This system of instruction was continued\nuntil the detachment was ordered on board ship on the 6th of June.\nDuring this instruction members of the detachment were designated by\nname to fall out, and the remainder of the detachment required to\nexecute all the maneuvers of the piece as before. In fact, this\ninstruction was carried to such a point that one man alone was\nrequired to load, aim, and fire the gun at designated objects without\nany assistance.",
        "The detachment at once assumed the position of an independent command.\nIt reported directly to Maj.-Gen. W. R. Shafter, commanding the 5th\nCorps, in everything so far as its duties with Gatling guns were\nconcerned, was regarded as an independent command, kept its own\nrecords in the same manner as a company, obtained cooking utensils\nfrom the quartermaster and ran its own mess, and furnished its own\nguard. This status, that of a separate command, continued until the\ndetachment was finally disbanded at Montauk.",
        "On the 27th of May the detachment commander was summoned to Gen.\nWheeler’s headquarters and there requested to explain to the general\nin person his plans for organizing a Gatling gun detachment. Gen.\nWheeler had just assumed command of all the Cavalry belonging to the\n5th Army Corps. His headquarters, instead of being in a suite of rooms\nin the palatial Tampa Bay Hotel, where all the other general officers\nhad their headquarters, were located about half a mile from the hotel\nin a treeless pasture. The cavalry guidon floating from a lance-head\nwas the only indication of headquarters, and the half-dozen “A” tents\nin an irregular line gave no sign that one of the most distinguished\ngenerals in the world had here his headquarters in the field.",
        "The general was easily accessible. The first thing that impressed one\nof him was his extraordinary quickness. His eye seemed to take in\neverything within sight of him at a single glance, and to read one’s\nthoughts before the tongue could give expression to them. He grasped\nideas when they were only half uttered and immediately drew deductions\nfrom mere statements of simple facts, the result of years of careful\nstudy. These deductions, which Gen. Wheeler drew instantly, were in\nevery case correct, and showed a keener and more correct appreciation\nof the proper tactical employment of machine guns than was shown by\nany other officer of the 5th Corps. The result of the interview with\nthe general was that a scheme for the organization of a tactical unit\nto be composed of three Gatling guns and to be employed with the\ncavalry division, was drawn up on the spot, under Gen. Wheeler’s\npersonal direction, and was submitted by him to Gen. Shafter, with the\nrequest that authority be granted for the organization of this command\nfor the purpose indicated.",
        "In the application Gen. Wheeler stated that he believed that such a\nbattery of machine guns, if properly handled, could go anywhere that\ncavalry could go, could take the place of infantry supports, could\ndash up and hold any ground or advantageous position that a body of\ncavalry might seize, could be thrown out to one flank of the enemy and\nassist in his demoralization in preparation for the cavalry charge,\nand would be of particular service in case the enemy attempted to form\ninfantry squares, which were at that time supposed to be the main part\nof the Spanish tactics of battle. This application was disapproved.",
        "On the 30th of May, Gen. Lee sent for the detachment commander for an\ninterview on the subject of Gatling guns. Gen. Lee was at this time\nquartered at the Tampa Bay Hotel, and was engaged in the organization\nof the 7th Army Corps. It was supposed that the 7th Corps was designed\nfor the Havana campaign, and it was believed that the attack upon\nHavana would begin at a very early date. The result of the interview\nwith Gen. Lee was that he directed a scheme for the organization of a\ntactical unit to be composed of 9 guns, 3 batteries of 3 guns each, to\nbe prepared for service with the 7th Army Corps.",
        "It was desired that this organization be a volunteer organization, and\nthe application was therefore made for authority from the President,\nunder that law of Congress authorizing the employment of special\ntroops. Col. Guild, well and favorably known from his connection with\nthe Massachusetts National Guard, was prepared to furnish a volunteer\norganization already in existence, well drilled and already officered,\ncomposed of the flower of the youth of Massachusetts, very largely of\ncollege graduates, who had already been communicated with on the\nsubject, and who were even at that time expecting momentarily a\ntelegram calling them to this duty. Nothing resulted from this effort.",
        "Meantime the drill instruction of the little detachment continued. Its\nmembers had acquired a considerable degree of proficiency in the\nmechanical handling of their guns, and were beginning to appreciate\nthe destructive possibilities of their weapon. They were enjoying a\ndegree of liberty which they had not found in their regimental camp,\nbecause when not on duty they were free to come and go at will, when\nand where they pleased. The hours for instruction were designated in\nthe morning and in the cool of the afternoon, leaving the middle of\nthe day and the evening for the men’s own recreation. The result of\nthis system of treatment was that esprit-du-corps began to be\ndeveloped in the detachment. They began to feel that they were a\nspecial organization, expected to do special work, and that they were\nreceiving very special treatment. They began to be proud of being\nmembers of the Gatling Gun Detachment, to take greater interest in the\nwork, and when on the first of June they received their monthly pay\nnot a single member of the detachment committed any excesses in\nconsequence of this unusual degree of freedom. No one was intoxicated.\nNo one was absent without permission.",
        "The detachment had not been at the Ordnance Depot very long before an\nopportunity occurred for some of its members to exhibit those\nqualities which made the success of the battery so conspicuous on the\nbattle-field afterward. The detachment commander had been detailed by\nverbal orders on the first of June in charge of the issues of ordnance\nproperty to the Santiago expedition. This was in addition to his\nduties with the Gatling guns. The work would commence about 6 o’clock\nin the morning, and from that time until dark there was a continual\nstream of wagons carrying away stores such as rifles, haversacks, meat\nration cans, tin cups, and all the articles needed by troops in the\nfield during a campaign. The ammunition which was issued to the troops\nat this time was drawn at the same place.",
        "When wagons arrived to receive issues, stevedores were directed to\ncount out the different articles under the direction of an overseer,\nand these piles of articles were verified by the officer in charge of\nthe issues. The stevedores then loaded them on the wagons which were\nto haul them to the different camps. Receipts in duplicate were always\ntaken and invoices in duplicate were always given, in the name, of\ncourse, of Lieut. John T. Thompson, who was responsible for the\nstores.",
        "On the 4th of June issues were being made of rifle-ball cartridges.\nThese cartridges came packed in boxes of 1000 rounds each, and each\nbox weighed 78 pounds. A great quantity of it was stored in the\nbasement, where there was also a considerable quantity of fixed\nHotchkiss ammunition, as well as several thousand rounds of powder\ncharges in boxes. The Hotchkiss ammunition, which comes with\nprojectile and powder both set in a brass case, is bad ammunition to\npack; for, no matter how carefully it is handled, there is almost\nalways some leakage of powder from the cartridge case, thus causing a\ncertain amount of loose powder to sift into the box in which it is\npacked.",
        "About half past 11 o’clock on this morning a negro stevedore\naccidentally dropped a box of rifle ammunition near a pile of\nHotchkiss fixed, and the next instant the laborers saw smoke ascending\ntoward the ceiling of the basement. They yelled “Fire! fire!” at the\ntop of their voices, and everybody in the basement at once made a rush\nfor the two doors. It was a panic. The danger was imminent. The smoke\ncurled up to the ceiling and then curled down again, and the excited,\npanic-stricken faces of the negroes as they rushed through the door\nmade an awful picture of human terror. People on the outside of the\nbuilding began to shout “Fire!”",
        "At this juncture McGee, the old janitor, who had just reached the\ndoor, cried out, “Lieutenant, there is a box in here on fire!\"\nspeaking to Lieut. Parker, who was verifying issues just outside the\ndoor. The lieutenant replied, “Let’s throw it into the river,” and\ndashed toward the box through the door, pushing the excited negroes to\neach side in order to assist McGee, who had instantly started for the\nbox. When Lieut. Parker reached the box, he found that McGee had\nalready taken it up, and was staggering under its weight. He placed\none arm around McGee’s shoulder and with the other assisted him to\nsupport the box, from which the smoke was still ascending, and the two\nrushed for the door, throwing the whole momentum of their weight and\nspeed against the crowd of frightened negroes, who were falling over\neach other in their panic-stricken efforts to escape. Priv. Greenberg,\nof the 13th Infantry, a member of the Gatling Gun Detachment, who was\nthe sentinel on post at the time, saw the two men coming with the box,\nand with great presence of mind added his own weight with a rapid rush\nto the shock they had produced, thus enabling them to break their way\nthrough the dense throng at the door. It was only the work of an\ninstant to then throw the box in the river, where it sank in the water\nand for a moment the blue smoke continued to bubble up from the box,\nwhich lay clearly visible on the bed of the river, the water being\nonly about two feet deep at this point, which was, however, enough to\nentirely cover the box and thus extinguish the fire. At the outcry of\n\"Fire!” Lieut. H. L. Kinnison, of the 25th Infantry, who was waiting\noutside of the basement with a wagon, started in at the other door,\nand Serg. Weischaar, acting first sergeant of the Gatling Gun\nDetachment, started for water. Just as the two men emerged from the\ndoor carrying the box, Lieut. Kinnison reached the spot where the fire\nhad originated, and Serg. Weischaar appeared with two buckets of\nwater. He and Lieut. Kinnison at once flooded the floor, seized a\nwoolen cloth which happened to be near, and wetted down the boxes of\nHotchkiss ammunition as a measure of precaution.",
        "McGee, the hero of this episode, is an old veteran of the Civil War,\nhaving served three years in the Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry\nduring the war, and five years in the Regular Army after the war. He\nhas never drawn a pension nor applied for one, although he suffers\nconsiderably from disease and wounds contracted and received during\nthe war, and certainly should be rewarded by a grateful government for\nhis conspicuous heroism. The explosion of this magazine would have\nbrought the whole expedition to a standstill, besides inflicting\ntremendous destruction of property and frightful loss of life.",
        "The same day the Artillery of the army began to draw its material for\nthe campaign, and for a period of thirty-nine hours there was no rest\nfor anybody connected with the issue of ordnance stores. It was at\nthis time that the lack of intelligent marking and packing of the\nboxes was keenly felt. The greatest difficulty was experienced in\nselecting, from the mass of stores in the depot, the stores that were\nrequired by the Artillery. It was especially difficult during the work\nby night, when the only light that could possibly be allowed was a\nsingle lantern, on account of the danger of fire.",
        "At the close of this thirty-nine hours of arduous duty, the officer in\ncommand of the Gatling Gun Detachment learned that orders had been\nissued for the embarkation of the 5th Army Corps at Port Tampa, and\nthat no reference had been made to the Gatling Gun Detachment in these\norders. He at once sought Lieut. Thompson, who could offer no light on\nthe omission, but said, “I have orders to send at once to the\nCherokee 521,000 rounds of rifle-ball cartridges and all the\nrevolver ammunition on hand. This is the reserve ammunition of the 5th\nArmy Corps. I will send you in charge of this ammunition and you will\nsee it to its destination. You may take an escort or not, as you\nplease. The ammunition is to go on the 4 o’clock train and you must\nmake all the arrangements in regard to it. Get box-cars, haul the\nammunition over there and put it in the cars, see that it goes on that\ntrain, and as soon as it arrives at Port Tampa, see that it is\nproperly put on board the Cherokee.”",

        "“Headquarters 5th Army Corps,\n\"Tampa, Fla., June 5, 1898.",
        "“Respectfully returned to Lieut. J. T. Thompson, Ordnance Officer.",
        "“If Lieut. Parker, in charge of the detachment as at present\nconstituted, can make the arrangements suggested within, he may take\naction; but, in view of the limited time remaining, it is thought the\ndetachment already organized will answer.",

        "“Jno. T. Thompson,\n\"1st Lieut., Ordnance Dept, U. S. A.”",
        "It will be seen from the first endorsement that a certain amount of\ndiscretion was left to the detachment commander. He was authorized to\ntake action if he could make the arrangements suggested within. Lieut.\nThompson had authorized an escort for the reserve ammunition, if it\nwas considered necessary. The detachment commander resolved to take\naction by using his whole detachment as an escort, putting it on board\nthe Cherokee, with the reserve ammunition, and accompanying it to its\ndestination–in Cuba, trusting to the future to enable him to complete\nthe detachment according to the first endorsement.",
        "It was now 11 o’clock in the forenoon. Between that time and 4 o’clock\nit was necessary to obtain two freight cars, have them placed upon the\nsiding at a convenient point, have more than twenty wagon-loads of\nammunition, camp equipage, etc., placed in these cars, have the four\nguns with their limbers placed on board, and, more difficult than all\nthe rest, go through the necessary red tape at the quartermaster’s\noffice in order to get the two cars moved to Port Tampa. It was all\naccomplished.",
        "The general freight agent was bluffed into believing that unless the\ntwo cars were instantly set where they were wanted his whole railroad\nwould be tied up. The quartermaster was hypnotized and dropped\nformality, putting all the clerks to work upon papers and making out\nthe necessary bill of lading, invoices, etc., in time to catch the 4\no’clock train. He also issued the necessary transportation for the\nofficer and men of the detachment from Tampa to Port Tampa, accepting\nthe first endorsement above as sufficient orders for that purpose.",
        "One member of the detachment, Priv. Murray, had been very ill with\nwhat we afterward learned to call the Cuban fever, and, while\napparently convalescent, was entirely too weak to accompany the\ndetachment. He was a splendid fellow, and the tears rolled down his\nemaciated face when he was told he must remain behind. He was\nfurnished with a descriptive list and a letter was written to the\nchief surgeon of the Division Hospital, requesting him to send an\nambulance immediately for the sick man. One member of the detachment\ncarried this letter to Tampa Heights, and so sharp was the work of\ngetting away that this man had to board a moving train as it was\npulling out to keep from getting left; but Priv. Murray was taken to\nthe hospital and cared for, and Priv. Bremer did not get left.",
        "The detachment reached Port Tampa about sundown, and Maj. Cushing, who\nhad charge of the loading of the transports, at once authorized the\ncars to be set alongside the Cherokee. The ammunition, guns, camp\nequipage, men, and all were promptly put aboard. The training in\npacking and unpacking the guns was the only thing which enabled the\nwork to be done in the limited time allotted. Not so much as a\nten-penny nail belonging to the detachment was left behind.",
        "During the night the troops that were to occupy the Cherokee came on\nboard, and it was found the next morning that five or six tons of\nregimental baggage had been piled on top of the guns, making it\npractically impossible to disembark, even if such a movement should be\nordered.",
        "",
        "It seemed that the work had been accomplished none too soon, for on\nthe morning of June 7th orders came to the Cherokee to leave the slip\nand proceed down the bay. There were on board at this time, beside the\nlittle Gatling Gun Detachment, the 17th Infantry, under command of\nCol. Haskell, and a battalion of the 12th Infantry, under command of\nCol. Comba, who was the senior officer on board. The ship was\nfrightfully crowded. The berth deck and lower deck had been arranged\nfor the accommodation of the men by nailing rows of two 2x4 scantlings\njust far enough apart to leave room for a man to lie down, and\nfastening three tiers of bunks to these scantlings. The men were\npacked in these bunks like sardines in a box. The ventilation was\nconspicuous by its absence, the heat below deck was frightful and the\nmisery entailed by such accommodations was beyond description. But the\nmen were very cheerful, and, being allowed the privilege of the upper\ndeck, very little in the way of complaint was heard. Everybody was\nanxious to be off. The hope most frequently expressed was for a quick\npassage and a sharp, swift campaign. It was easily foreseen by the\nofficers on board the ship that a long sojourn on shipboard under such\nconditions would have a very bad effect on the men.",
        "The ship dropped down the bay to the quarantine station, starting\nabout noon, and there lay to, waiting, as was supposed, for the\nremainder of the fleet. Suddenly, about 8 p. m., one of the torpedo\ncruisers came tearing down the bay under full steam, and we heard the\nmessage sounded through the megaphone: “Return to port. Three Spanish\ncruisers within three hours’ sail of the offing.” It was a thrilling\nmoment. Officers and men were lounging, taking, as they supposed,\ntheir last view of the American shores, without a suspicion of present\ndanger, when they were rapidly brought to a realizing sense that “war\nis hell,” by a notice that the enemy was upon them. Whether they were\nin danger or not, the danger was deadly real and imminent to them at\nthe time.",
        "The Cherokee had been anchored pretty well inside. She immediately got\nup steam and went out to warn other vessels farther out in the offing,\nand then made safely for the harbor. Officers and men behaved with\nperfect coolness. It was hopeless to attempt to escape by concealment,\nso Col. Comba ordered out the band of the 17th Infantry and the good\nship fled up the bay, in momentary expectation of a smashing shot from\nthe enemy, to the strains of “There’ll be a hot time.” What little\nexcitement there was displayed itself in a feverish searching of the\nbay with field-glasses for signs of the enemy. The older officers,\nupon whom the responsibility was resting, sat upon the quarter-deck,\nsmoking their pipes and discussing the situation. The captains quietly\nmoved about, assigning stations to their companies, in case of attack,\nwith the view of trying the effect of the modern rifle upon the\narmored sides of a Spanish man-of-war, and two of the younger officers\ntook advantage of the catchy air which the band was playing to dance a\ntwo-step on the quarter-deck. So the evening wore away. The moon went\ndown. The myriad little stars came out, twinkling in the deep blue\nsky, and at last both officers and men, tired of looking for an enemy\nwho was never to appear, turned in for such sleep as they could get,\nleaving a small guard on deck to keep a lookout. When they awoke next\nmorning, the ship was in the deepest part of the nearest slip, moored\nfast by her guy-ropes to the dock. Thus ended the first engagement\nwith the enemy.",
        "From the 8th until the 13th, the Cherokee lay at anchor in the slip.\nShe was relieved on the 10th of about 200 men, thus slightly\nlightening her overcrowded condition. In the meantime, this\novercrowded condition of the ship had led to some discussion as to who\ncould best be moved on board some other ship, with some prospect that\nthe Gatling Gun Detachment might be disturbed. The situation was not\nat all satisfactory. With four guns, no mules, no harness, no\nauthority, and only twelve men, the Gatling Gun Detachment did not\nappear to be in a very fair way toward inflicting much damage upon the\nenemy. So on the 11th of June the detachment commander visited Gen.\nShafter at his headquarters, determined to bring the matter to an\nissue, definitely, one way or the other. This was the first time he\nhad met the general, and, under the circumstances, the manner of his\nreception appeared to be doubtful.",
        "Gen. Shafter is a big man. This is not noticed at first glance. He is\nabove the average height, but his corpulent figure does not indicate\nthat he is full five feet nine inches in height, because his girth is\nof like proportion. His hands are big; his arm is big; his head is\nbig. The occiput is especially full, and the width of head just over\nthe ears is noticeable. There is plenty of room for the organs of\ncombativeness. One would think he is probably a lover of children;\nduring this interview he patted the head of an inquisitive dog, which\nevidently belonged somewhere on board the flag-ship, and which strayed\ninto the room. His eyes are big, very full and very keen. As you enter\nhe says curtly, “Take a seat.” He waits, looking down, for you to\nstate your business, then suddenly fixes you with a piercing glance,\nand goes to the heart of the subject by one incisive sentence, which\nleaves no more to be said. This description is a general type of\nseveral interviews with him. On this occasion the general inquired\nconcerning the facts, looking keenly, searchingly, and meditatively at\nthe detachment commander. The machine gun man was “on trial.” Then the\ngeneral broke the silence by one short question, “What do you want?\"\nand the reply was in kind, “Twenty men, general, with the privilege of\nselecting them.” The general suggested the advisability of taking a\ncomplete organization; to which was replied, “That at this late hour\nin the expedition it is imperative to have selected men in order to\nperform the required duty; that men taken at random, as would be the\ncase in a complete organization such as a company, would not be likely\nto have the required characteristics.” The general tersely remarked,\n\"You may have them. Make out your list, name any man in the corps that\nyou want, and hand the list to me. I will send the men to you.” The\ntrial was over, and the Machine Gun Detachment was a settled fact.",
        "Accordingly on the following day Special Orders No. 16 were issued, as\nfollows:",

        "The organization was thus perfected by a single stroke of the\ngeneral’s pen on the 11th of June, theoretically; practically it was\nthe 14th of June before the details from the 12th and 17th Infantry\nreported, and when they did, instead of being equipped as directed,\nthey carried rifles with 100 rounds of ammunition.",
        "Serg. Weigle, of the 9th Infantry, who reported at the same time,\ncarried a revolver. On the 14th a wigwag message was received from the\n13th Infantry, inquiring whether the detail was desired to report at\nonce or not, to which the reply was sent that it was desired to report\nat the earliest possible moment. It did not report.",
        "The detachment was at once organized as well as possible for the trip\non board the transport, and the guns brought up from the hold of the\nship and mounted in such a way that they would be ready for instant\nuse. It was not known but that the detachment might have to\nparticipate in a naval engagement, and the value of machine guns in\nthe navy has long been demonstrated. At any rate, it was determined to\nbe ready to give a warm reception to any torpedo vessel which might\nattempt to attack the Cherokee. One object of getting the guns up was\nto give instruction to the new men who reported on the 14th. Sergt.\nWeigle was well instructed in the use of Gatling guns, but none of the\nother members of the detachment had ever received any instruction, and\nhad been selected rather on the ground of their superior intelligence\nand courage than on any special knowledge of machine guns. They were\ngiven a drill each day in loading and firing the piece, during the\ntime they remained on board the transport, when the weather permitted.",
        "The condition of the troops on board the transport was miserable. The\nfollowing extract from a letter written at that time will convey some\nidea of the crowded, ill-ventilated condition of the vessel:",
        "“We have now been on board the transport a week, and are getting into\na frame of mind suitable for desperate work. If you can imagine 1000\nmen crowded into space needed for 500, and then kept there without\nroom to stand or move or sit for seven days, under a tropical sun, in\nfoul holds utterly without ventilation (just imagine it!), endured\nwithout a single murmur or complaint, not stoically, but patiently and\nintelligently, while every officer on board is kicking as hard and as\noften as possible for the relief of his men, then you will have some\nidea of the situation. The men are very patient, but they know someone\nhas blundered. Talk about the heroism of the Light Brigade! It is\nnothing to the heroism that goes cheerfully and uncomplainingly into\nthe Black Hole of Calcutta (there is nothing else that will compare\nwith these transports), all because it is duty. When will the people\nappreciate the heroism of the Regular Army?”",
        "This was the actual condition of affairs on board the Cherokee\nup to the time of leaving port on the 14th of June, and it was\nmodified only by the hoisting of wind-sails, after we got under way.\nThese were not very efficient and there were only two of them, so very\nlittle relief was given to the overcrowded berth-deck. Most of the men\nspent their time on the upper deck, and one whole company was\nquartered there. At night, after 8 o’clock, Col. Comba authorized the\nmen to sleep on deck, and there was always a rush, when the ship’s\nbell struck the hour, for good places on the quarter-deck. The only\nthing that made the voyage endurable was the good weather which\nprevailed. This prevented seasickness, to a certain extent.",
        "The squadron reached Santiago de Cuba, and after tacking about for\nseveral days, either for the purpose of deceiving the enemy, or of\nwaiting a decision as to the landing-place, finally approached\nBaiquiri, which had been selected for the landing. The troops on the\nCherokee began to land on the 23d of June, the battalion of the\n12th Infantry going first. This was followed by the 17th Infantry, and\nupon its departure the captain of the Cherokee put to sea. The\nreason for this maneuver is not known. The orders issued by Gen.\nShafter in regard to the landing were that the Gatling Gun Detachment\nshould accompany Gen. Lawton’s Division. This movement of the\nCherokee completely blocked the landing of the Gatling guns. The\nship’s captain was finally induced to put back into the bay and speak\nto the Seguransa, and Gen. Shafter directed that the detachment should\nbe taken off the next morning.",
        "An effort was made, therefore, to obtain the use of a lighter which\nwas not at that time in use, but the Commissary Department refused to\nyield the boat, and it remained until 11 o’clock the next morning tied\nup to the wharf with half a load of commissaries on board before it\nbecame available, and then was seized by the Quartermaster’s\nDepartment. An effort was then made to obtain the use of three\npontoons, belonging to the Engineer Department, which had been drawn\nup to the shore and were of no use to anybody. The young engineer\nofficer in charge of these boats, a premature graduate of the class of\n’98, was “afraid the boats might get smashed in the surf,” and could\nnot consent without seeing Col. Derby. Col. Derby could not be found.",
        "A wigwag came from Gen. Shafter, asking whether the Gatling guns had\nbeen landed. The reply, “No; may I use pontoons?” was answered at\nonce, “Use pontoons, and get off immediately.” On returning to shore\nwith a party to work the pontoons, the party was stopped in the act of\nlaunching the first boat by Gen. Sumner, and ordered to proceed to the\nCherokee, take her out into the offing, and order another to take her\nplace to unload. Protesting against this action, and informing Gen.\nSumner of the urgent orders for the Gatling guns to disembark at once,\nthat officer inquired the opinion of the prematurely graduated\nengineer as to the practicability of using the pontoons, and this\nexperienced young man again expressed the fear that the boats might be\ninjured in the surf. To the detachment commander’s indignant\nexclamation, “What the h– were these boats made for, if they are not\nto be used and smashed?” Gen. Sumner responded by a peremptory order\nto warp the Cherokee out from the pier and send the other vessels in.\nThe order was obeyed, and all the circumstances reported to Gen.\nShafter the same evening, with the expression of the opinion that if\nthe general wanted the Gatling guns landed, he would have to attend to\nit personally, because the Gatling gun commander did not have\nsufficient rank to accomplish it in the face of all these obstacles.\nEarly on the morning of June 25th, therefore, Gen. Shafter sent\nperemptory orders to the lighter to lay alongside the Cherokee, take\nthe Gatling guns and detachment on board, and land them on the dock.\nThe transfer began at 8 o’clock in the morning, Gen. Shafter coming\nout in person in his steam launch to see that his order was executed.\nBy 11 o’clock the guns, carriages, 30,000 rounds of ammunition, four\nsets of double harness, and the detachment were on board the lighter.\nThis had been accomplished a mile outside in the offing, with the\nvessel rolling and pitching in the trough of the sea and on the crest\nof the gigantic rollers in so violent a manner that it was almost\nimpossible for men to stand on their feet, much less handle such heavy\nmaterial as guns and ammunition. The lighter was warped to the pier at\n11 o’clock, and the general tied his steam launch alongside to see\nthat it was not disturbed until the debarkation was completed. At 1\no’clock everything was ashore, and, in compliance with the general’s\ninstructions, the best mules in the corral were taken, and as they\nwere led away from the corral-gate, a fat, sleek, black streaked,\nlong-eared specimen, which had been selected for a saddle-mule, set up\na cheerful “Aw! hee haw! haw!” which produced a burst of laughter and\ncheering from the members of the detachment and the soldiers in the\nvicinity. It was a cheerful omen. These Missouri mules were capable of\npulling anything loose at both ends, and four experienced drivers had\nbeen selected from the detachment who were capable of riding anything\nthat walked on four feet, or driving anything from an Arab courser to\na pair of Shetland ponies.",
        "Priv. J. Shiffer had been selected as corral boss of the detachment.\nThe most picturesque figure, the most boyish member, and as brave a\nsoldier as ever shouldered a musket; broad of shoulder, stout of limb,\nfull of joke, as cheerful as a ray of sunlight, this man was the\nincarnation of courage and devotion. He loved a mule. He was proud of\nthe job. With the instinct of a true teamster, he had snapped up the\nbest pair of mules in the whole corral and was out before the\ndetachment commander had selected a single mule. This team was as\nblack as Shiffer’s shoes and as strong as a pair of elephants. They\nwere worked harder than any other team in the 5th Army Corps, and when\nthey were turned in to the quartermaster in August, they were as fat,\nas sleek, as strong, and as hardy as on the day they were taken from\nthe corral in Baiquiri. The other three teamsters were like unto the\nfirst. They were all handy men. They were as capable of fighting or\naiming a gun as of driving a team. Any one of the four could take a\nteam of mules up a mountain-side or down a vertical precipice in\nperfect safety. They could do the impossible with a team of mules, and\nthey had to do it before the detachment reached the firing-line. The\nsuccess of the battery was to depend to a very large degree upon the\ncoolness, good judgment, and perfect bravery of these four teamsters.",
        "It should be noted that the use of mules was an experiment. The\n\"scientific” branch of service has always held that the proper animal\nto draw a field-piece is the horse. They expatiate with great delight\nupon the almost human intelligence and sagacity of that noble animal;\nupon his courage “when he snuffeth the battle afar,” and upon the\nundaunted spirit with which he rushes upon the enemy, and assists his\nmaster to work the destruction of his foes. The Artillery claims that\nmules are entirely too stubborn, too cowardly, and too hard to manage\nfor the purpose of their arm of the service. It was also an experiment\nto use two mules per gun. The Engineer Department had reported that\nthe road to the front was impassable for wheeled vehicles, and even\nthe general had apparently thought that four mules per gun would be\nnecessary. The necessity of economizing mules, and the opinion of the\ndetachment commander that two mules per gun would be sufficient, had\nled to the issue of that number. Those who despise the army mule for\nthe purposes of field artillery know very little of the capacity of\nthis equine product of Missouri when properly handled. It was\ndemonstrated that two mules can pull a Gatling gun with 10,000 rounds\nof ammunition, loaded down with rations and forage, where eight horses\nare required to draw a field-piece; and that mules are equally as easy\nto manage under fire as horses.",
        "The landing was completed and the detachment organized at 3 p. m.,\nhaving rations, forage, and ammunition complete. There was no tentage,\nexcept the shelter-halves which some of the men had brought with them.\nCapt. Henry Marcotte, retired, the correspondent of the Army and Navy\nJournal, requested permission to accompany the detachment, which was\ngranted, and soon all were en route for the front, entrusted with\nthe task of opening the way for wheeled transportation and of\ndemonstrating the practicability of the road for army wagons and field\nartillery.",
        "For the first mile the road was excellent. It lay through one of the\nmost fertile parts of the most fertile island in the world. A little\nstream trickling along the side of the road furnished plenty of water\nfor both men and animals. At the end of the mile the detachment found\na steep hill to descend. The Ordnance Department, which designed and\nbuilt the carriage for the Gatling guns, had never foreseen the\nnecessity for a brake, and it was therefore necessary to cut down\nbushes from the roadside and fasten the rear wheels by placing a stout\npole between the spokes and over the trail of the piece. This locked\nthe wheels, and the guns were thus enabled to slide down the steep\nhill without danger of a runaway. From this point the road became a\nnarrow defile. The rank jungle closed in upon the trail, the long\nbarbed leaves of the Spanish bayonet hung across and lacerated the\nlegs of the mules until the blood trickled down to the hoofs; the\nboughs of the trees hung down over it so that even the men on foot had\nto stoop to pass under them, and the tortuous path winding in and out\namid the dense tropical undergrowth made it impossible to see in\nplaces more than twenty-five or thirty yards ahead at a time.",
        "The advance guard, consisting of all the members of one gun crew, had\nbeen organized at once upon starting, and this guard moved along the\nroad about two hundred and fifty yards in advance of the detachment,\nscouting every path vigilantly to the right and left, and keeping a\nconstant, careful lookout to the front. Their orders were, in case of\nencountering the enemy, to scatter in the underbrush, open fire with\nmagazines, so as to produce the impression upon the enemy that there\nwas a large force, and then slowly fall back upon the battery. The\nplan was, upon the first alarm, to bring the two leading guns into\nbattery upon the road, with the fourth gun ready to be opened to\neither flank, while the gun crew of the third gun, which formed the\nadvance guard, were to act as infantry support to the battery. It was\nhoped that the enemy would follow the advance guard as it retreated,\nand it was believed that the Gatling gun battery could take care of\ntwo or three regiments of Spaniards without help if necessary.",
        "This form for the march had been adopted as the result of mature\nreflection. The general had offered a cavalry escort of two troops,\nand Gen. Sumner had rather urged the use of an escort, but it was\ndesired to demonstrate that a battery of machine guns, properly manned\nand equipped, is capable of independent action, and does not need the\nassistance of either arm of the service. In fact, the Gatling gun men\nwould have been rather pleased than not to have had a brush with the\nenemy without the assistance of either infantry or cavalry. But it was\nnot to be.",
        "The march was continued until darkness fell over the landscape, and\nthe battery arrived at a beautiful camping-place about one mile east\nof Siboney, where a break in the water-pipe near the railroad track\ngave an ample supply of excellent water, and a ruined plantation, now\novergrown with luxuriant sugar-cane, provided ample forage for the\nmules. The two troops of cavalry, which had been offered and refused\nas an escort, had reached this camping-place some time before, so that\nthe wearied members of the detachment found pleasant camp-fires\nalready throwing their weird lights and shadows over the drooping\nbranches of the royal palm.",
        "Here, in the midst of the jungle, they pitched their first camp in\nCuba. The condition of the mules was duly looked to, their shoulders\nwashed down with strong salty water, their feet carefully examined,\nand the animals then tethered to graze their fill on the succulent\nsugar-cane, after having had a bountiful supply of oats. Meantime the\ncamp cooks had a kettle full of coffee simmering, and canned roast\nbeef warming over the fire, and after a hearty meal the tired men\nstretched themselves upon the ground, with no canopy except the stars\nand only one sentinel over the camp, and slept more soundly than they\nhad on board the tossing Cherokee.",
        "At early dawn the battery arose, and, after a quick breakfast, resumed\nthe march. Some half-mile farther on they passed a battery of light\nartillery which had preceded them on the road by some nine hours, and\nwhich had camped at this point awaiting forage. At Siboney the\ndetachment stopped to look after the detail from the 13th Infantry,\nwhich had not yet reported. The detachment commander sought out the\nregimental adjutant, who referred him to the regimental commander,\nCol. Worth. This colonel was at first reluctant to allow the men to\ngo, but, on being informed of the necessity for them, and after\ninquiring about the orders on the subject, he directed the detail to\nreport immediately. All the members of this detail reported at once,\nexcept Corp. Rose, who had been left by his company commander on board\nship.",
        "The road from Siboney to the front was not known. There was no one in\ncamp who even knew its general direction. Application was therefore\nmade to Gen. Castillo, who was in command of a body of Cubans at\nSiboney, for a guide. After a great deal of gesticulation, much\nexcited talk between the general and members of his staff, and\nnumerous messengers had been dispatched hither and thither upon this\nimportant and very difficult business, a Cuban officer was sent with\ninstructions to furnish a guide who could conduct the detachment to\nGen. Wheeler’s headquarters at the front. In the course of some twenty\nminutes, a dirty slouchy, swarthy, lousy-looking vagabond was pointed\nout as the desired guide, and was said to know every by-path and trail\nbetween Siboney and Santiago. He was told to go with the detachment to\nGen. Wheeler’s headquarters and then return, and the detachment\ncommander started for his command followed by his sable guide. Passing\nthrough a group of these brave Cuban heroes, he lost sight of his\nredoubtable guide for an instant, and has never since found that\ngentleman.",
        "It would be just as well to add a description of the patriotic Cuban\nas he was found by the Gatling Gun Detachment during their campaign in\nbehalf of Cuban independence, in the name of humanity; and this\ndescription, it is thought, tallies with the experience of all\nofficers in the expedition.",
        "The valiant Cuban! He strikes you first by his color. It ranges from\nchocolate yellow through all the shades to deepest black with kinky\nhair; but you never by any chance see a white Cuban, except the fat,\nsleek, well-groomed, superbly mounted ones in “khaki,” who loaf around\nheadquarters with high-ranking shoulder-straps. These are all imported\nfrom the United States. They comprise the few wealthy ones of Spanish\ndescent, who are renegade to their own nativity, and are appealing to\nthe good people of the United States to establish them in their status\nof master of peons without any overlord who can exact his tithes for\nthe privilege.",
        "The next thing you notice is the furtive look of the thief. No one has\never yet had a chance to look one of these chocolate-colored Cubans\nstraight in the eye. They sneak along. Their gait has in it something\nof that of the Apache, the same soft moccasined tread, noiseless and\nalways stealthy. Your impressions as to their honesty can be instantly\nconfirmed. Leave anything loose, from a heavy winter overcoat, which\nno one could possibly use in Cuba, to–oh well, anything–and any\nCuban in sight will take great pleasure in dispelling any false\nimpressions that honesty is a native virtue.",
        "Next you notice that he is dirty. His wife does sometimes make a faint\nattempt at personal cleanliness; this is evident, because in one\nbright instance a white dress was seen on a native woman, that had\nbeen washed sometime in her history. But as to his lordship, the proud\nmale citizen of Cuba libre, you would utterly and bitterly insult him\nby the intimation that a man of his dignity ought ever to bathe, put\non clean clothes, or even wash his hands. He is not merely dirty, he\nis filthy. He is infested with things that crawl and creep, often\nvisibly, over his half-naked body, and he is so accustomed to it that\nhe does not even scratch.",
        "Next you observe the intense pride of this Cuban libre. It is\nmanifested the very first time you suggest anything like manual\nlabor–he is incapable of any other–even for such purposes as camp\nsanitation, carrying rations, or for any other purpose. His manly\nchest swells with pride and he exclaims in accents of wounded dignity,\n\"Yo soy soldado!” Still his pride does not by any chance get him\nknowingly under fire. At El Poso some of him did get under fire from\nartillery, accidentally, and it took a strong provost guard to keep\nhim there. If he ever got under fire again there was no officer on the\nfiring-line who knew it.",
        "He is a treacherous, lying cowardly, thieving, worthless, half-breed\nmongrel; born of a mongrel spawn of Europe, crossed upon the fetiches\nof darkest Africa and aboriginal America. He is no more capable of\nself-government than the Hottentots that roam the wilds of Africa or\nthe Bushmen of Australia. He can not be trusted like the Indian, will\nnot work like a negro, and will not fight like a Spaniard; but he will\nlie like a Castilian with polished suavity, and he will stab you in\nthe dark or in the back with all the dexterity of a renegade graduate\nof Carlisle.",
        "Providence has reserved a fairer future for this noble country than to\nbe possessed by this horde of tatterdemalions. Under the impetus of\nAmerican energy and capital, governed by a firm military hand with\neven justice, it will blossom as the rose; and, in the course of three\nor four generations, even the Cuban may be brought to appreciate the\nvirtues of cleanliness, temperance, industry, and honesty.",
        "Our good roads ended at Siboney, and from there on to Gen. Wheeler’s\nheadquarters was some of the worst road ever traveled. Part of it lay\nthrough deep valleys, where the sun was visible scarcely more than an\nhour at noontime, and the wet, fetid soil was tramped into a muck of\nmalarial slime under foot of the mules and men. The jungle became\nranker, the Spanish bayonets longer and their barbs sharper in these\nlow bottom jangles. The larger undergrowth closed in more sharply on\nthe trail, and its boughs overhung so much in some places that it\nbecame necessary to cut them away with axes in order to pass.",
        "These guns were the first wheeled vehicles that had ever disturbed the\nsolitude of this portion of Cuba. The chocolate-colored natives of\nCuba sneak; the white native of Cuba, when he travels at all, goes on\nhorseback. He very seldom travels in Cuba at all, because he is not\noften there. Consequently the roads in Cuba, as a rule, are merely\nsmall paths sufficient for the native to walk along, and they carry\nthe machete in order to open a path if necessary. These low places in\nthe valleys were full of miasmatic odors, yellow fever, agues, and all\nthe ills that usually pertain to the West Indian climate.",
        "At other places the road ran along the tops of the foot-hills from one\nto two hundred feet higher than the bottom of these valleys. Here the\ncountry was much more open. The path was usually wide enough for the\nguns to move with comparative ease. Sometimes one wagon could pass\nanother easily. These parts of the road were usually more or less\nstrewn with boulders. The road was rarely level and frequently the\nupland parts were washed out. Sometimes it was only the boulder-clad\nbottom of a ravine; again the water would have washed out the gully on\none side so deep as to threaten overturning the guns. The portions of\nthe road between the valleys and the top of these foot-hills were the\nworst places the detachment had to pass. These ascents and descents\nwere nearly always steep. While not at all difficult for the man upon\nhorseback or for the man on foot, they were frequently almost too\nsteep for draft, and they were always washed out. In places it was\nnecessary to stop and fill up these washouts by shoveling earth and\nstone into the places before the detachment could pass.",
        "On one of these occasions, while heaving rock to fill up a bad\nwashout, Priv. Jones was stung by a scorpion. Jones did not know what\nhad bitten him, and described it as a little black thing about as long\nas his finger. Fortunately there was a small supply of whisky with the\ndetachment, and this remedy was applied to Jones internally. Some\nsoldier in the detachment suggested that a quid of tobacco externally\nwould be beneficial, so this also was done. It was not a dressing\nfavorable to an aseptic condition of the wound, perhaps, nor was there\nanything in the quid of tobacco calculated to withdraw the poison or\nneutralize its effects, so the doctors may characterize this as a very\nfoolish proceeding; but country people skilled in simples and herb\nremedies might tell some of these ultra scientific surgeons that the\napplication of a quid of tobacco or of a leaf of tobacco to the sting\nof a wasp or the bite of a spider, or even the sting of a scorpion, is\nnearly always attended by beneficial results. In fact, when Jones was\nstung there was a surgeon, a medical officer, who turned up even\nbefore Jones was treated with the whisky cure, and, upon receiving\nJones’ explanation that he had been heaving rock and had been bitten\non the end of the finger by a little black thing, and after hearing\nthe remarks of the men that it was very probably a scorpion sting,\nthis medical officer very sagely diagnosed the accident to that\neffect, but was unable to prescribe any remedy because he had not\nbrought along his emergency case. This medical officer, with his two\nattendant hospital satellites, had left both litter and emergency case\nupon the transport.",
        "The ordinary line officer or soldier who is somewhat accustomed to\ncarrying weights and does not require a hospital drill to teach him to\ncarry a wounded comrade a few yards, looks with a certain degree of\nenvy upon the possession of a hospital litter with its convenient\nstraps for weight-carrying, and would consider this a very convenient\nmeans for carrying a pack. This litter is designed to enable two men,\nhospital attendants or band men, to pick up a wounded soldier weighing\nsome 160 or 180 pounds and carry him from fifty yards to a mile if\nnecessary, to a dressing-station or hospital shack. The medical\nfield-case No. 1 weighs about sixty pounds filled, and field-case No.\n2 weighs about forty pounds. These two cases contain all the medicines\nnecessary to run a division hospital; the case of emergency\ninstruments does not weigh above ten or twelve pounds, and would not\nbe a burden for a child to carry. It is therefore difficult for the\nsmall-minded officer of the line to see why the Medical Department was\nunable to have these medicines up at the front. They had the same\nmeans of locomotion provided for the other soldiers, by Nature, and\nthey had, moreover, no particular necessity for all rushing to the\nextreme front. On the contrary, they had from the 23d of June, when\nthe landing began, at Baiquiri, until the 1st of July, to accomplish a\ndistance of less than twenty miles; and it would seem reasonable that\nthey might have had their medicine-cases up where they were needed by\nthat time.",
        "These gentlemen pose as the most learned, expert, scientific, highly\ntrained body of medical men in the world. They are undoubtedly as well\ntrained, as highly educated, and as thoroughly proficient as the\nmedical officers of any army in the world. A summons of an ordinary\npractitioner would bring with him his saddle-bags of medicines; no\nphysician in the city would pretend to answer even an ambulance call\nwithout having a few simple remedies–in other words, an emergency\ncase; but it was an exception, and a very rare exception at that, to\nfind a medical officer who took the trouble to carry anything upon his\naristocratic back on that march to the front.",
        "A conversation overheard between two medical officers on board a\ntransport just before landing may serve to partially explain the state\nof affairs. Said surgeon No. 1 to surgeon No. 2, “We are going to land\nthis morning; are you going to carry your field-case?” To which\nsurgeon No. 2 indignantly replied, “No, I’m not a pack-mule!” Surgeon\nNo. 1 again inquired, “Are you going to make your hospital men carry\nit?” To which surgeon No. 2 replied, “No; my men are not beasts of\nburden.” Both of these medical officers went ashore; one of them had\nhis field case carried; the other did not. Both of them were up at the\nfiring-line, both did good service in rendering first aid. Both of\nthem worked heroically, both seemed deeply touched by the suffering\nthey were compelled to witness, and both contracted the climatic\nfever. But in the absence of medicines the role of the surgeon can be\ntaken by the private soldier who has been instructed in first aid to\nthe injured; for in the absence of medical cases and surgical\ninstruments the first-aid packet is the only available source of\nrelief, and these first-aid packets were carried by the private\nsoldier, not by the Medical Department.",
        "A little less “theory,” a little less “science,” a little less\ntendency to dwell on the “officer” part of the business, with a little\nmore devotion to the duty of relieving suffering humanity–in short, a\nlittle less insistence upon “rank,” would have vastly improved the\nmedical service of the United States Army in the field at this time.",
        "These remarks do not apply to the heroes like Ebert, Thorpe, Brewer,\nKennedy, Warren, and a few others, who fearlessly exposed their lives\nupon the very firing-line. These men are the very “salt of the earth.\"\nThe escape of even a “frazzle” of the 5th Corps was due to their\nsuperhuman energy and exertions. They did much to redeem the good name\nof their corps and to alleviate suffering.",
        "But Priv. Jones recovered from the sting of the scorpion. In fact,\nsoldiers were heard to exclaim that they would be glad to find a\nscorpion when they saw the character of the remedy applied in Jones’\ncase.",
        "The detachment left Siboney about 10 o’clock in the morning and\ntramped steadily along the road up hill and down until 12; then, upon\nfinding a convenient place, it halted for dinner. The mules were\nunharnessed, coffee prepared, and, just as the detachment was about to\nbegin this noonday meal, two of the peripatetic newspaper fraternity\njoined, en route to the rear. The ubiquitous correspondent had\nfor the first time discovered the Gatling Gun Detachment, and they\nthought it was Artillery.",
        "One of these gentlemen was a long, slim, frayed-out specimen of\nhumanity, with a wearied and expressive droop of the shoulders; the\nother was a short, stout, florid, rotund individual, and his “too, too\nsolid flesh” was in the very visible act of melting. The newspaper\ngentlemen were invited to participate in the noonday meal, and, with\nsome gentle urging, consented. It was only after the meal was over\nthat it was learned that this was the first square meal these men had\nhad in over forty-eight hours. They had been with Gen. Wheeler at La\nGuasimas, had rejoined Wheeler after reporting that fight, in hopes of\nmaking another “scoop,” and were now on their way to Siboney, hoping\nto buy some provisions. Poor devils! They had worked for a “scoop” at\nLa Guasimas; they had gone up on the firing-line and had sent back\nauthentic accounts of that little skirmish; but they did not make the\n\"scoop.” The “scoop” was made by newspaper men who had remained on\nboard the transports, and who took the excited account of a member of\nthe command who had come back delirious with excitement, crazed with\nfear, trembling as though he had a congestive chill–who, in fact, had\ncome back faster than he had gone to the front, and in his excited\ncondition had told the story of an ambuscade; that Wheeler, Wood, and\nRoosevelt were all dead; that the enemy was as thick as the barbs on\nthe Spanish bayonet; and that he, only he, had escaped to tell the\ntale. This was the account of the battle that got back to the\nnewspapers in the form of a “scoop,” and it was nothing more nor less\nthan the excited imagination of the only coward who at that time or\never afterwards was a member of the famous Rough Riders. He was\nconsequently returned to civil life prematurely.",
        "The newspaper correspondent in Cuba was of a distinguished type. You\nrecognized him immediately. He was utterly fearless; he delighted in\ngetting up on the firing-line–that is, a few of him did. Among these\nfew might be mentioned Marshall, and Davis, and Remington, and\nMarcotte, and King, and some half-dozen others; but there was another\ntype of newspaper correspondent in Cuba, who hung around from two\nmiles and a half to three miles in rear of the firing-line, and never\nby any possibility got closer to the enemy than that. The members of\nthis guild of the newspaper fraternity were necessarily nearer the\ncable office than their more daring comrades; in fact, there were a\nfew who were known to have been eight or nine miles nearer to the\ncable office during battles, and those correspondents were the ones\nwho made the great “scoop” in the New York papers, by which a regiment\nthat laid down and skulked in the woods, or ran wildly to the rear,\nwas made to do all the fighting on the first day of July. This latter\nclass of journalists were a menace to the army, a disgrace to their\nprofession, and a blot upon humanity. Even the Cubans were ashamed of\nthem.",
        "The detachment resumed the march at half past 1, and encountered some\nvery difficult road, difficult because it needed repairs. The most\ndifficult places were the ascents and descents of the hills, and in\nnearly every case fifteen or twenty minutes’ careful investigation was\nable to discover a means of getting around the worst places in the\nroad. When it was not practicable to go around, J. Shiffer and his\nthree fellow-teamsters would take a twist of their hands in the manes\nof their long-eared chargers, and apparently lift them down, or up, as\nthe case might be, always landing on their feet and always safely. It\nwas merely a question of good driving and will to go through. The\nworst places were repaired by the detachment before these reckless\nattempts at precipice-scaling were made. At one place there was a\ndetachment of the 24th Infantry engaged in an alleged effort to repair\nthe road. They did not seem to work with much vim. Chaplain Springer,\nhaving in the morning exhorted them to repentance and a better life\nand to doing good works unto their brethren, the enemy, was engaged at\nthis point in the afternoon, it being Sunday, in a practical\ndemonstration of what he considered good works. In other words, the\nchaplain, whose religious enthusiasm no one doubts, was engaged in\nheaving rocks with his own hands to show these colored soldiers how\nthey ought to make good road, and he was doing “good works.”",
        "It is but a just tribute to Chaplains Springer and Swift, of the\nRegulars, to say that they were conspicuous in the hour of danger at\nthe point of greatest peril. In the fearless discharge of their holy\noffice, they faced all the dangers of battle; nor did they neglect the\ncare of the body while ministering to the spiritual needs of the\nsoldiers. Springer, for example, collected wood and made coffee for\nall on the firing-line, within 400 yards of the block-house at El\nCaney; and Swift was equally conspicuous in relieving suffering,\nbinding up wounds, and caring for the sick. There were probably others\nequally as daring; but the author knows of the deeds of these men, and\ndesires to pay a tribute of respect to them. Chaplains of this stamp\nare always listened to with respectful attention when they express\ntheir views of the true course of life to obtain a blessed hereafter.\nThey were in very sharp contrast to the long-visaged clerical\ngentlemen who were so much in evidence at Tampa, and who never got\nwithin 500 miles of danger.",
        "The detachment safely passed all the bad places and obstacles in the\nroad, arriving at Gen. Wheeler’s headquarters about half past 4\no’clock, and reported. It was assigned a position between the advance\noutposts and directed to dispose of its guns in such a manner as to\nsweep the hills on which these outposts were placed. High hills to the\nright at a distance of about 2000 yards were supposed to be infested\nby the enemy, and a blockhouse which stood out against the sky-line\nwas thought to contain a Spanish detachment. A high hill to the left\nat a distance of about 1000 yards had not yet been explored, and it\nwas thought probable that some of the enemy was concealed on this hill\nalso. The detachment commander was directed to report, after posting\nhis battery, in which duty he was assisted by Col. Dorst, to Gen.\nChaffee, who had charge of the outposts. The General inquired what the\nbattery consisted of, and upon being informed that “It consists of\nfour Gatling guns, posted so as to command the neighboring hills,\"\nremarked in a very contemptuous manner, “You can’t command anything.\"\nGen. Chaffee subsequently had reason to revise his opinion, if not to\nregret the expression of it.",
        "At this point in the history of the detachment, it would be well to\ngive some account of the reasoning which led to its formation and the\npersonnel of the detachment.",
        "Since the days of ’65 the armies of the civilized world have adopted a\nrifle whose effective range is more than twice as great as that used\nin the Civil War. Very able discussions have been made upon the\ntheoretical changes of the battle-field thus brought about, but no\nproper conclusion had been reached. It was acknowledged by all\ntext-book writers that the artillery arm of the service would find\nmuch greater difficulty in operating at short ranges, and that\nassaults upon fortified positions would be much more difficult in the\nfuture. But only Gen. Williston, of the United States Artillery, had\never taken the advanced ground that in a machine gun arm would be\nfound a valuable auxiliary as a result of these changed conditions.\nThis theory of Gen. Williston’s was published in the Journal of the\nMilitary Service Institute in the spring of ’86, but never went,\nso far as Gen. Williston was concerned, beyond a mere theory; nor had\nthe detachment commander ever heard of Gen. Williston’s article until\nafter the battle of Santiago.",
        "A study of the science of tactics–not merely drill regulations, but\ntactics in the broader sense of maneuvering bodies of troops upon the\nbattle-field–had led Lieut. Parker to the conclusion that the\nartillery arm of the service had been moved back upon the battle-field\nto ranges not less than 1500 yards. This not because of lack of\ncourage on the part of the Artillery, but as an inherent defect in any\narm of the service which depends upon draft to reach an effective\nposition. It was not believed that animals could live at a shorter\nrange in anything like open country. The problem of supporting an\ninfantry charge by some sort of fire immediately became the great\ntactical problem of the battle-field. Admitting that the assault of a\nfortified position has become much more difficult than formerly, the\nnecessity of artillery support, or its equivalent in some kind of\nfire, became correspondingly more important, while under the\nconditions it became doubly more difficult to bring up this support in\nthe form of artillery fire.",
        "The solution of this problem, then, was the principal difficulty of\nthe modern battle-field; and yet, strange to say, the curtailed\nusefulness of artillery does not seem to have suggested itself to\nanybody else in the service previous to the first day of July. This\nproblem had been made the subject of special study by him for several\nyears, and had led to the conclusion that some form of machine gun\nmust be adopted to take the place of artillery from 1500 yards down.\nThis in turn led to the study of machine guns. The different forms in\nuse in the different armies of the world had been considered, and it\nwas found that there was none in any service properly mounted for the\nparticular use desired. All of them required the service of animals as\npack-mules, or for draft, while the very conditions of the problem\nrequired a gun to be so mounted that the use of animals could be\ndispensed with.",
        "The Maxim gun has been reduced in weight to about 60 pounds, and is\nfurnished with a tripod weighing about the same; but this is too\nheavy, and the supply of ammunition at once becomes a critical\nquestion. The Colt’s automatic rapid-fire gun has been reduced to 40\npounds, with a tripod of equal weight, but here again the same\ndifficulty presents itself. The soldier is capable of carrying only a\nlimited amount of weight; and with his already too heavy pack, his\nthree days’ rations, together with the heat, fatigue and excitement of\nbattle, it did not appear possible for any tripod-mounted gun to be\neffectively used.",
        "The problem therefore resolved itself into the question of carriages:\nA carriage capable of carrying any form of machine gun using\nsmall-caliber ammunition, capable of being moved anywhere by draft,\ncapable of being dismantled and carried on a pack-mule, and, above,\nall, capable of being moved by hand; required also some device for\ngetting the requisite amount of ammunition up to the firing-line. A\ncarriage and ammunition cart was invented fulfilling all these\nconditions and the invention was presented to the adjutant-general of\nthe army for consideration, accompanied by a discussion of the proper\ntactical use of the gun so mounted. This discussion, in part, was as\nfollows:",
        "“It is claimed for this carriage that a machine gun mounted on it can\nbe carried with a firing-line of infantry on the offensive, over\nalmost any kind of ground, into the decisive zone of rifle fire and to\nthe lodgment in the enemy’s line, if one is made.",
        "“On broken ground the piece can be moved forward by draft under cover\nof sheltering features of the terrain to a position so near the enemy\nthat, under cover of its fire, an infantry line can effect a lodgment,\nafter which the piece can be rushed forward by a sudden dash.",
        "“The machine gun, mounted on this carriage, is especially adapted for\nservice with the reserve of a battalion on the offensive, acting\neither alone or in regiment. Its use will enable the commander to\nreduce the reserve, thereby increasing the strength of the\nfighting-line, and yet his flanks will be better protected than\nformerly, while he will still have a more powerful reserve. If the\nfighting-line be driven back, the machine guns will establish a point\nof resistance on which the line can rally, and from which it can not\nbe driven, unless the machine guns be annihilated by artillery fire.",
        "“In case of counter-charge by the enemy, the superior weight and\nintensity of its fire will shake the enemy and so demoralize him that,\nin all probability, a return counter-charge will result in his\ncomplete discomfiture.",
        "“Retiring troops as rear guards have in this weapon par excellencethe weapon for a swift and sharp return with the power of rapidly\nwithdrawing. If the enemy can by any means be enticed within its\nrange, he will certainly suffer great losses. If he cannot be brought\nin range, his distance will be rather respectful.”",
        "This discussion as presented was entirely and absolutely original with\nthe author and the result of his own unaided researches on the\nsubject. It will be seen in the account of the battle how accurately\nthe conditions there laid down were fulfilled.",
        "But the carriage in use by the Gatling Gun Detachment was not the one\nproposed to the War Department. That carriage has not, as yet, been\nbuilt, nor has the War Department in any way recognized the invention\nor even acknowledged the receipt of the communication and drawings.",
        "The problem, therefore, confronting the Gatling Gun Detachment was to\ndemonstrate the above uses of the machine gun, taking the obsolete\nartillery carriage drawn by mules, and endeavor to get the guns into\naction by draft. The personnel of the detachment alone accounts\nfor their success. They got the guns up on the firing-line, not\nbecause of any superiority of the carriage over that in use by the\nartillery, for there was none; not because of aid rendered by other\narms of the service, for they actually went into battle as far as 100\nyards in advance of the infantry skirmishers; but because the Gatling\nGun Detachment was there for the purpose of getting into the fight and\nwas determined to give the guns a trial.",
        "In the first place, all the members of the Gatling Gun Detachment were\nmembers of the Regular Army. All but three of them were natives of the\nUnited States, and those three were American citizens. Every man in\nthe detachment had been selected by the detachment commander, or had\nvoluntarily undertaken to perform this duty, realizing and believing\nthat it was an extremely hazardous duty. Every member of the\ndetachment possessed a common-school education, and some of them were\nwell educated. All of them were men of exceptionally good character\nand sober habits. The drivers were Privs. Shiffer, Correll, Merryman,\nand Chase. The description formerly given of Shiffer applies, with\nslight modifications, to all the four. The first sergeant, Weigle, a\nnative of Gettysburg, a soldier of eight years’ experience in the\nRegular Army, a man of fine natural ability and good educational\nattainments, was worthy to command any company in the United States\nArmy. Thoroughly well instructed in the mechanism of Gatling guns, of\nexceptionally cheerful and buoyant disposition, he was an ideal first\nsergeant for any organization. Steigerwald, acting chief of gun No. 1,\nwas of German birth, well educated. He had chosen the military\nprofession for the love of it; he was a man of wonderfully fine\nphysique, a “dead sure” shot, and one who hardly understood the\nmeaning of the word “fatigue.” He was ambitious, he was an ardent\nbeliever in the Gatling gun, and he was determined to win a commission\non the battle-field.",
        "Corporal Doyle was a magnificent type of the old-time Regular–one of\nthe kind that composed the army before Proctorism tried to convert it\ninto a Sunday-school. In former days Doyle had been a drinking man;\nbut the common opinion as expressed by his company officers even in\nthose days was, “I would rather have Doyle, drunk, than any other\nnon-commissioned officer, sober; because Doyle never gets too drunk to\nattend to duty.” Two years before this Doyle had quit drinking, and\nthe only drawback to this most excellent noncommissioned officer had\nbeen removed. He was a thorough disciplinarian; one of the kind that\ntakes no back talk; one who is prone to using the butt end of a musket\nas a persuader, if necessary; and Doyle was thoroughly devoted to the\ndetachment commander. Corp. Smith was another of the same stamp. Corp.\nSmith loved poker. In fact, his sobriquet was “Poker Smith.” He\nwas one of the kind of poker-players who would “see” a $5 bet on a\npair of deuces, raise it to $25, and generally rake in the “pot.” It\nwas Corp. Smith who thought in this Gatling gun deal he was holding a\npair of deuces, because he didn’t take much stock in Gatling guns, but\nhe was a firm believer in his commanding officer and was prepared to\n\"bluff” the Dons to the limit of the game.",
        "Sergeants Ryder and Weischaar were splendid types of the American\nRegular non-commissioned officer, alert, respectful, attentive to\nduty, resolute, unflinching, determined, magnificent soldiers. Serg.\nGreen was a young man, only twenty-three, the idolized son of his\nparents, in the army because he loved it; enthusiastic over his gun,\nand fully determined to “pot” every Spaniard in sight. Corp. Rose was\nlike unto him. They were eager for nothing so much as a chance to get\ninto action, and equally determined to stay there. The privates of the\ndetachment were like unto the noncommissioned officers. They had\nvolunteered for this duty from a love of adventure, a desire to win\nrecognition, or from their personal attachment to the commanding\nofficer; and there was not a man who was not willing to follow him\ninto the “mouth of hell” if necessary. The gunners were expert shots\nwith the rifle. Numbers 1 and 2, who turned the crank and fed the gun,\nrespectively, were selected for their dexterity and coolness; the\ndrivers, for their skill in handling mules; and each of the other\nmembers of the detachment was placed on that duty which he seemed best\nfitted to perform.",

        "Another element which contributed much to the success of the\ndetachment was the presence with it of Captain Marcotte. This\nexcellent officer had served with great distinction in the Civil War,\nhaving been promoted from a private in the ranks through all of the\ngrades up to a captaincy, for meritorious conduct in battle, and\nhaving failed of higher grades only because he was too badly shot to\npieces to continue with the Army. He joined the detachment on the 25th\nof June, and his valuable advice was always at the disposal not merely\nof the commander, but of any member of the detachment who wished to\nconsult him. He had spent seventeen years in the Cuban climate and was\nthoroughly familiar with all the conditions under which we were\nlaboring. He contributed not a little, by his presence, his example,\nand his precept, to the final success of the organization. When the\nbattery went under fire, Marcotte was with it. It was the first time\nmost of the members had passed through this ordeal, but who could run,\nor even feel nervous, with this gray-haired man skipping about from\npoint to point and taking notes of the engagement as coolly as though\nhe were sitting in the shade of a tree sipping lime-juice cocktails, a\nmile from danger.",
        "Such was the personnel of the detachment. It lay in Camp Wheeler,\nwhich was only about a mile and a half from El Poso, where the first\nengagement occurred on the first of July, until that morning. The\nmules were daily harnessed up and drilled in maneuvering the pieces,\nand the members of the detachment experimentally posted in different\npositions in order to get the most effective service.",
        "On the 27th, Serg. Green was sent back to Siboney with orders to bring\nCorp. Rose or his body. He brought Corp. Rose, and the corporal was\nvery glad to be brought.",
        "The mules were fed with oats and on the juicy sugar-cane. It is worthy\nof mention that no other organization at the front had oats. A feed or\ntwo of oats was given to Gen. Wheeler and Col. Dorst for their horses;\nit was the first time their horses had tasted oats since leaving the\ntransports, and was probably the last time until after the surrender.\nFurthermore, the Gatling Gun Detachment had “grub.” Of course, it was\n\"short” on potatoes, onions, and vegetables generally; these luxuries\nwere not to be well known again until it returned to the United\nStates; but it did have hardtack, bacon, canned roast beef, sugar, and\ncoffee, having drawn all the rations it could carry before leaving\nBaiquiri, and was the only organization which had as much as\ntwenty-four hours’ rations. Gen. Hawkins and his whole brigade were\nliving from hand to mouth, one meal at a time. The same was true of\nGen. Wheeler and the whole cavalry division, and they were depending\nfor that one meal upon the pack-mule train. On the 30th of June a\ncomplete set of muster- and pay-rolls, was prepared for the\ndetachment, and it was duly mustered in the usual form and manner. It\nwas the only organization at the front of which a formal muster was\nmade, and was the only one there which had muster- and pay-rolls.",
        "It rained on the 29th and 30th of June. Not such rains as the people\nof the United States are familiar with, but Cuban rains. It was like\nstanding under a barrel full of water and having the bottom knocked\nout. These rains caused the rifles and carbines of the army to rust,\nand some quickwitted captain bethought himself to beg oil from the\nGatling Gun Detachment. He got it. Another, and another, and still\nanother begged for oil; then regiments began to beg for oil; and\nfinally application was made for oil for a whole brigade.

        "On the 27th of June, Captain Marcotte and the detachment commander\nmade a reconnaissance of a high hill to the left of Camp Wheeler, and,\nhaving gained the top, reconnoitered the city of Santiago and its\nsurrounding defenses with a powerful glass, and as a result reported\nto Gen. Wheeler that the key of Santiago was the Morro mesa, a\npromontory or tableland overlooking the city on the east side at a\ndistance of about a mile and a half and not at that time occupied by\nthe enemy, with the proposition that a detail of a half-dozen men from\nthe detachment should make a rush and capture this plateau, and hold\nit until the guns could be brought up. The general could not authorize\nthe proposed undertaking, as it would have endangered the safety of\nhis army, perhaps by leading to a premature engagement. By the time a\nsufficient reconnaissance had been made and convinced everybody of the\nvalue of this plan, the mesa had been strongly occupied by the enemy.\nIt is still believed that the occupation of this height was\npracticable on the 27th of June, and thought, if it had been\nauthorized, the Gatlings could have occupied and held this position\nagainst all the Spaniards in the city of Santiago. A glance at the map\nwill show the extreme tactical importance of this position.",
        "On the 30th day of June, General Shafter pitched his camp about half a\nmile in advance of Camp Wheeler in a valley, and about five o’clock in\nthe afternoon communicated the plan of battle to the division\ncommanders and to the commander of the Gatling Gun Detachment.",
        "Reconnaissance had developed the fact that the enemy occupied the\nvillage of El Caney, and that their first line of works surrounded the\ncity of Santiago at a distance of about a mile, crowning a\nsemicircular ridge. Between the position occupied by the general’s\ncamp and this ridge, a distance of about two and one-half miles,\nflowed the Aguadores and San Juan rivers, and about one mile from the\nSan Juan River, on the east side, was a ruined plantation and mission\nhouse, called El Poso. Midway between El Caney and the Spanish\nposition was a large handsome mansion, called the Du Cuorot house,\nstanding in the midst of a large plantation and owned by a Frenchman,\nwhich both sides had agreed to respect as neutral property. The\ngeneral plan of the battle as given to these officers on the 30th of\nJune was for one division of the army (Lawton’s), assisted by one\nbattery of artillery (Capron’s), to make an attack at daybreak upon\nthe village of El Caney, and drive the enemy out of it. Another\ndivision (Kent’s) was to make an attack upon the semicircular ridge of\nhills south of El Caney as soon as Lawton was well committed to the\nfight, both for the purpose of preventing reinforcements from going to\nEl Caney and to develop the enemy’s strength. It was expected that\nLawton would capture El Caney about eight or nine o’clock in the\nmorning, and pursue the retreating enemy, by the way of the Du Cuorot\nhouse, toward Santiago. This movement would cause Lawton to execute,\nroughly, a left wheel, and it was intended that in executing this\nmaneuver Kent’s right should join, or nearly join, Lawton’s left,\nafter which the whole line was to move forward according to the\ndevelopments of the fight. Kent’s attack was to be supported by\nGrimes’ Battery from El Poso. The Gatling Gun Detachment was to move\nat daylight on the morning of July 1st, take position at El Poso\nsheltered by the hill, in support of Grimes’ Battery, and there await\norders.",
        "This outline of the battle, as laid down by Gen. Shafter on the 30th\nday of June, was eventually carried out to the letter; its successful\noperation shut up a superior force in the city of Santiago, and\ncompelled the surrender of the city.",
        "Perhaps no better comment can be made upon the generalship of the\ncorps commander, no higher compliment be paid, than the mere statement\nthat he was able, fifteen hours before a shot was fired in the battle,\nto prescribe the movements of the different organizations of his\ncommand, and to outline the plan of battle as it was finally carried\nout, with a degree of precision which can be fully appreciated only by\nthose to whom the plan was communicated in advance. In spite of slight\nchanges, made necessary by local failures and unforeseen\ncircumstances; in spite of the very poor cooperation of the artillery\narm; in spite of the absence of cavalry, which made good\nreconnaissance practically impossible; in spite of the fact that he\nwas operating against a superior force in strong intrenchments–the\nplan of battle thus laid down was finally carried out with perfect\nsuccess in every detail.",
        "The Gatling Gun Detachment was assembled at six o’clock, and so much\nof the plan of battle was explained to them as it was proper to give\nout, with orders that breakfast was to be prepared by four o’clock and\nthe detachment be ready to move at 4:30. The plans were heard with\ncareful attention by the men, and the wisdom of giving to them some\nidea of the work they were expected to do was fully vindicated on the\nfollowing day, when they were compelled to lie nearly three hours\nunder a dropping fire, waiting for “Lawton to become well engaged,\"\nafter which the detachment moved forward, without a man missing, with\nthe utmost steadiness and coolness, to the attack.",
        "There was no nervousness displayed by the men. They knew their work\nwas cut out for them, and each man was eager to play his part in the\ngreat drama of the morrow. There was no excited talk indulged in. None\nof the buzz of preparation nor the hum of anticipation which to the\ncivilian mind should precede a desperate battle, but three or four\nmembers of the detachment took out their soldiers’ hand-books and\nwrote in them their last will and testament, requesting their\ncommander to witness the same and act as executor. The courage evinced\nby these men was not of that brutal order which ignores danger, but of\nthe moral quality which, fully realizing that somebody must get hurt,\nquietly resolves to face whatever may happen in the performance of the\nfull measure of duty.",
        "At four o’clock the guard aroused the members of the detachment\nquietly, and each man found a good hearty breakfast waiting for him,\nconsisting of hardtack, coffee, condensed milk, sugar, bacon, canned\nroast beef, and some canned fruit, which had been obtained somehow and\nwas opened upon this occasion. It was the last square meal they were\nto have for several days. At half past four the camp equipage had all\nbeen packed upon the guns in such a manner as not to interfere with\ntheir instantly getting into action, and the battery started for the\nfront.",
        "The road to El Poso was very good and the mules trotted merrily along,\npreceded and followed by infantry also bound for the front. The\nCubans, too, were in evidence; an irregular, struggling mob of\nundisciplined barbarians, vociferous, clamorous, noisy, turbulent,\nexcited. Presently the Cubans and infantry in front of the battery\nhalted and it passed beyond them, immediately throwing out the crew of\nthe third gun in front as an advance guard. It reached El Poso at six\no’clock, at which time there were no other soldiers there. The battery\ntook position as directed, under cover in rear of the hill and to the\nright front of the El Poso house. The camp equipage and blanket-rolls,\nwere removed and piled neatly upon the ground, and Priv. Hoft was\ndetailed to guard them, as well as one of the spare mules. About half\npast seven o’clock Grimes’ Battery arrived, and Col. McClernand, the\nassistant adjutant-general of the corps. The battery of artillery\nhalted upon the hill near the Gatlings, while its commander, the\nadjutant-general, the Army and Navy Journal correspondent, and the\nGatling gun man climbed to the top of the hill to reconnoiter the\nenemy. They were accompanied by several attaches and a battalion of\nnewspaper correspondents.",
        "To the southwest, at a distance of about 3,000 yards, the city of\nSantiago lay slumbering in the morning sun. The chain of hills which\nsurrounded the city, lying between it and our position, was crowned\nwith rank tropical verdure, and gave no indications of military\nfortifications. There was no sign of life, a gentle land breeze swayed\nthe tops of the royal palms, and the little birds flitted from bough\nto bough caroling their morning songs as though no such events were\nimpending as the bombardment of a city and the death of 400 gallant\nsoldiers. The gentle ripple of the creek, lapping over its pebbly bed\nat the foot of the hill, was distinctly audible.",
        "The artillery officers produced their range-finders and made a\nscientific guess at the distance from the hill to a red brick building\nin the northern edge of Santiago. This guess was 2600 yards. They\nsignalled to the lead piece of Grimes’ Light Battery to ascend the\nhill. It was delayed for a moment while picks and shovels were plied\nupon the top of the hill to make slight emplacements for the guns, and\nat last, at ten minutes before eight o’clock, the first piece started\nthe difficult ascent. The drivers stood up in their stirrups and\nlashed their horses and shouted; the horses plunged and reared and\njumped. The piece stuck half way up the hill. The leaders were turned\nslightly to the right to give new direction and another attempt was\nmade–ten yards gained. The leaders were swung to the left, men and\nofficers standing near by added their shouts and blows from sticks. A\ntall artillery officer, whose red stripes were conspicuous, jumped up\nand down and swore; the team gave a few more jumps, then they wheeled\nthe gun by a left about, with its muzzle pointing toward the city. It\nwas quickly unlimbered and run to its place.",
        "The second piece started up the hill. The drivers of this piece sat\nquietly in their saddles, and, with a cluck, started up the hill at a\nwalk. The tall artillery officer shouted, and a driver muttered under\nhis breath, “Damned fool!” Regardless of the orders to rush their\nhorses, the drivers of this piece continued to walk up the hill. At\nthe steepest part of the hill, they rose slightly in their stirrups,\nas one man, and applied the spur to the lead horses, and, at the same\ntime, a lash of the quirt to the off horses of the team. The horses\nsprang forward, and in an instant the second piece was in battery. The\nthird and fourth pieces were taken up in the same manner as the\nsecond.",
        "The pieces were loaded; a party of newspaper correspondents produced\ntheir lead pencils and pads, and began to take notes; the little birds\ncontinued to sing. The Gatling Gun man, the Army and Navy Journal man,\nand the assistant adjutant-general stepped to the windward a few yards\nto be clear of the smoke. The range was given by the battery\ncommander–2600 yards; the objective was named, a small, almost\nindistinguishable redoubt, below the hospital about 300 yards. The\ncannoneers braced themselves, No. 3 stretched the lanyard taut on his\npiece, and Grimes remarked, in a conversational tone, “Let her go.”",
        "The report of the field-piece burst with startling suddenness upon the\nquiet summer morning, and a dense cloud of grayish-colored smoke\nspurted from the muzzle of the gun. Everybody involuntarily jumped,\nthe sound was so startling, although expected. The piece recoiled\neight or ten feet, and the gunners jumped to the wheels and ran it\nforward again into battery. Field-glasses were glued upon the vicinity\nof the brick hospital. There was a puff of white smoke and an\nexclamation, “A trifle too long!” The second piece was aimed and\nfired. There was no response. The third, and fourth, and fifth, with\nlike results. It was like firing a salute on the Fourth of July. There\nwas no indication of any danger whatever; laugh and jest were\nbeginning to go round.",
        "Suddenly a dull boom was heard from somewhere, the exact direction\ncould not be located. The next thing was a shrill whistle overhead,\nand then a most startling report. The first Spanish shell exploded\nabout twenty feet above the surface of the ground, and about twenty\nyards in rear of the crest of the hill. It exploded in the midst of\nour brave Cuban contingents, killed one and wounded several. The\nvaliant sons of Cuba libre took to their heels, and most of the\nnewspaper correspondents did likewise. The members of Grimes’ Battery,\nwho were not needed at the guns, were sent back to the caissons, and\nanother round of shrapnel was sent in reply. Again a hurtling sound\nrent the air; again there was the fierce crack of a Spanish shell in\nour immediate vicinity, and, on looking around to see where this shell\nstruck, it was observed that it had burst over the Gatling battery.\nLuckily, it had gone six or eight feet beyond the battery before\nexploding. A fragment of the shell had struck Priv. Bremer upon the\nhand, producing quite a severe contusion. The Missouri mules stamped\nthe ground impatiently; one of them uttered the characteristic\nexclamation of his race, “Aw! hee! aw! hee! aw!” and the members of\nthe detachment burst into a merry peal of hearty laughter. It was\nevident that this detachment was not going to run, and it was equally\nevident that the Missouri mules would stand fire.",
        "A third shell whistled over the hill. This one burst fairly over\nGrimes’ third piece, killed the cannoneer, and wounded several men.",
        "The members of the detachment were now directed to lie down under\ntheir guns and limbers, except the drivers, who declined to do so, and\nstill stood at the heads of their mules. Priv. Hoft, disdaining to\ntake cover, shouldered his rifle and walked up and down, sentry\nfashion, over the pile of camp equipage.",
        "Serg. Weigle, who had brought along a small portable camera, with a\nlarge supply of film-rolls, requested permission to photograph the\nnext shot fired by Grimes’ Battery. It was granted. He climbed to the\ntop of the hill, stepped off to the left of the battery, and calmly\nfocused his camera. Grimes fired another salute, and Weigle secured a\ngood picture. A Spanish shell came whistling over the hill; Weigle,\njudging where it would burst from previous observations, focused his\ncamera, and secured a picture of the burst. He then rejoined his\ndetachment, and photographed it as it stood. He seemed chiefly worried\nfor fear he would not get a picture of everything that happened.",
        "The artillery duel continued for some twenty minutes. The infantry\nbegan to pass on, to the front. Grimes no longer needed the support of\nthe Gatling guns, because he now had an infantry support in front of\nhim, and was firing over their heads. Col. McClernand sent orders to\nthe detachment to move to the rear, out of range. The order was\nobeyed.",
        "Private Hoft, with the instinct of a true soldier, continued to tramp\nback and forth guarding the pile of camp equipage. The battery moved\nto the rear at a gentle trot, and, as it turned down the hill into the\nfirst ford by the El Poso house, a Spanish shell whistled over the\nhead of Private Shiffer, who was leading the way, and burst just\nbeyond his off mule. Shiffer didn’t duck and nobody was hurt.\nProvidence was taking care of this experiment. Corporal Doyle and two\nother members of the detachment got lost, and wandered off among the\ncrowd of Cubans, but soon found the battery and rejoined. Orders were\ngiven that as soon as the battery was out of range, it should halt and\nface to the front, at the side of the road.",
        "The battery halted about half a mile to the rear, and the 13th\nInfantry passed it here, on their way to the front. The comments\nbestowed were not calculated to soothe the ruffled feelings of people\nwho had been ordered to retreat. “I told you so.” “Why don’t you go to\nthe front?” “Going to begin firing here?” “Is this the place where you\nshoot?” “Is this all there is of it?” “I knew they would not get into\nthe fight.” “Watch them hang around the rear.” “Going to start in\nraising bananas back here, John Henry?” “What do you think of machine\nguns now?” and similar remarks, of a witty but exasperating nature,\ngreeted the detachment, from both officers and men, as the regiment\npassed on its way to the front. The only thing that could be done was\nto endure it, in the hope of getting a chance to make a retort later\nin the day.",
        "About nine o’clock, the artillery firing ceased, and the Gatling Gun\nBattery returned to El Poso. Grimes’ guns were still up on the hill,\nbut there were no cannoneers; they had ceased to fire, and had left\ntheir guns. Two or three dead men were lying on the side of the hill;\nwounded men were limping around with bandages. Cubans were again\npassing to the front. These fellows were trying to reach El Caney.\nThey never got into the fight. They did reach the vicinity of El\nCaney, and the Spanish fired one volley at them. The Cubans set up a\ngreat howl, accompanied by vociferous gesticulations–and then\n\"skedaddled.”",
        "During all this time the sound of firing had been heard toward El\nCaney. It had been opened up there about half an hour before Grimes\nfirst spoke at El Poso. The fire in this direction sounded like\nranging fire, a shot every two or three minutes, and it was supposed\nthat Capron was trying to locate the enemy. The sharp crack of\nmusketry was heard on our front, it swelled and became continuous. It\nwas evident that quite a fight was going on at El Caney, which was to\nour right about one mile and to our front perhaps half a mile. Kent’s\nDivision kept pushing forward on the El Poso road. Col. McClernand was\nasked for instructions for the Gatling Gun Detachment. He replied,\n\"Find the 71st New York, and go in with them, if you can. If this is\nnot practicable, find the best place you can, and make the best use of\nyour guns that you can.” These were the only instructions received by\nthe Gatling Gun Detachment until one o’clock.",
        "The Gatling Gun Detachment moved forward about half a mile. They found\nthe 71st New York lying down by the side of the road, partially\nblocking it. Troops passing them toward the front were compelled to\nbreak into columns of twos, because the road was crowded by the 71st.\nThe colonel and his adjutant were sought and found, and informed of\nthe detachment’s instructions. Information was requested as to when\nand where the 71st was going into the fight. It appeared that they had\na vague idea that they were going in on the left center of the left\nwing. Lawton’s Division at El Caney will be considered the right wing;\nKent’s Division and Wheeler’s Division the left wing of the army at\nSan Juan. The 71st did not seem to know when it was going to move\ntoward the front, nor just where it was going; and there was no\napparent effort being made to get further down the road to the front.\nWheeler’s Division was also pressing forward on the road, dismounted\ncavalrymen, with no arms in their hands except their carbines without\nbayonets. With these same carbines these men were, a little later, to\nstorm the intrenchments, manned by picked and veteran soldiers, who\nknew how to die at their posts.",
        "With Wheeler’s Division were the Rough Riders, the most unique\naggregation of fighting men ever gathered together in any army. There\nwere cowboys, bankers, brokers, merchants, city clubmen, and society\ndudes; commanded by a doctor, second in command a literary politician;\nbut every man determined to get into the fight. About three-quarters\nof a mile in advance was the first ford, the ford of the Aguadores\nRiver; beyond this a quarter of a mile was another ford, the ford of\nthe San Juan. The road forked about two hundred yards east of the\nAguadores ford, turning sharply to the left. Down the road from El\nPoso crept the military balloon, it halted near this fork–\"Balloon\nFork.” Two officers were in its basket, six or eight hundred feet\nabove the surface of the ground, observing the movements of the troops\nand the disposition of the enemy.",
        "The sharp crackle of the musketry began in front, and still the\nGatling Gun Detachment lay beside the road with the 71st, waiting,\nswearing, broiling, stewing in their own perspiration, mad with\nthirst, and crazed with the fever of the battle. The colonel of the\n71st was again approached, to ascertain whether he was now going to\nthe front, but still there were no signs of any indication to move\nforward. So the long-eared steed was mounted and the ford of the\nAguadores reconnoitered. The bullets were zipping through the rank\ntropical jungle. Two or three men were hit. Those who moved forward\nwere going single file, crouching low, at a dog trot. There was no\nevidence of hesitation or fear here. Some of the “Brunettes” passed,\ntheir blue shirts unbuttoned, corded veins protruding as they slightly\nraised their heads to look forward, great drops of perspiration\nrolling down their sleek, shiny, black skins. There was a level spot,\nslightly open, beyond the ford of the Aguadores, which offered a place\nfor going into battery; from this place the enemy’s works on San Juan\nwere visible, a faint streak along the crest of the hill illumined\nfrom time to time by the flash of Mausers.",
        "On return to the battery, there were no signs of being able to enter\nthe action with the gallant 71st, and, acting under the second clause\nof the instructions, the Gatling battery was moved forward at a\ngallop. Major Sharpe, a mounted member of Gen. Shafter’s staff, helped\nto open a way through this regiment to enable the guns to pass. The\nreception of the battery by these valiant men was very different from\nthat so recently given by the 13th Regulars. “Give ’em hell, boys!\"\n\"Let ’er go, Gallagher!” “Goin’ to let the woodpeckers go off?\"–and\ncheer after cheer went up as the battery passed through. Vain efforts\nwere made to check this vociferous clamor, which was plainly audible\nto the enemy, less than 1500 yards away. The bullets of the enemy\nbegan to drop lower. The cheering had furnished them the clew they\nneeded. They had located our position, and the 71st atoned for this\nthoughtlessness by the loss of nearly eighty men, as it lay cowering\nin the underbrush near Balloon Fork.",
        "Just before reaching the Aguadores ford, the battery was met by Col.\nDerby, who had been observing the disposition of the troops, from the\nballoon, and had afterward ridden to the front on horseback. The\ncolonel was riding along, to push the infantry forward in position\nfrom the rear, as coolly as if on the parade-ground. A blade of grass\nhad gotten twisted around a button of his uniform and hung down like a\nbuttonhole bouquet over his breast. There was a genial smile on his\nhandsome face as he inquired, “Where are you going?” and, on being\ninformed of the orders of the detachment and of the intention to put\nthe battery into action, he replied, “The infantry are not deployed\nenough to take advantage of your fire. I would advise that you wait a\nshort time. I will send you word when the time comes.” The advice was\nacted upon, the guns were turned out by the side of the road, and the\nmen directed to lie down.",
        "During the gallop to the front they had been compelled to run to keep\nup, there not being sufficient accommodation for them to all go\nmounted on the guns. They were panting heavily, and they obeyed the\norder and crept under the guns, taking advantage of such little shade\nas was offered. Troops continued to pass to the front. The crackle of\nmusketry gradually extended to the right and to the left, showing that\nthe deployment was being completed. More men were hit, but no\ncomplaints or groans were heard. A ball struck a limber-chest; a man\nlying on his face in the road, during a momentary pause of one of the\ncompanies, was perforated from head to foot: he never moved–just\ncontinued to lie there; the flies began to buzz around the spot and\nsettle on the clotted blood, that poured out from the fractured skull,\nin the dust of the road. Down at the ford, some twenty-five or thirty\nyards in advance, men were being hit continually.",
        "Shots came down from the trees around. The sharpshooters of the\nSpanish forces, who had been up in the trees during the artillery\nduel, and beyond whom our advance had swept, fully believing that they\nwould be murdered if captured, expecting no quarter, were recklessly\nshooting at everything in sight. They made a special target of every\nman who wore any indication of rank. Some of our heaviest losses\nduring the day, especially among commissioned officers, were caused by\nthese sharpshooters. They shot indiscriminately at wounded, at\nhospital nurses, at medical officers wearing the red cross, and at\nfighting men going to the front.",
        "The firing became too warm, and the Gatling battery was moved back\nabout fifty yards, again halted, and faced to the front. It was now\nnearly one o’clock. The members of the detachment had picked up their\nhaversacks on leaving El Poso, and now began to nibble pieces of\nhardtack. A bullet broke a piece of hardtack which a man was lifting\nto his mouth; without even stopping in the act of lifting it to his\nmouth, he ate the piece, with a jest.",
        "Suddenly the clatter of hoofs was heard from the front. Lieut. Miley\ndashed up and said, “Gen. Shafter directs that you give one piece to\nme, and take the other three beyond the ford, where the dynamite gun\nis, find some position, and go into action.” Sergeant Weigle’s gun was\nplaced at Miley’s disposal, and the other pieces dashed forward at a\ndead run, led by the musical mule who uttered his characteristic\nexclamation as he dashed through the ford of the Aguadores.",
        "The place formerly selected for going into action had been again twice\nreconnoitered during the wait, and a better place had been found about\nthirty yards beyond the ford of the San Juan River. The dynamite gun\nhad stuck in the ford of the Aguadores; a shell had got jammed in it.\nThe Gatlings were compelled to go around it. They dashed through the\nintervening space, across the San Juan ford, and up on the opening\nbeyond. The position for the battery, partially hidden from the view\nof the enemy by a small clump of underbrush, was indicated. The right\npiece, Serg. Green’s, was compelled to go into action in the middle of\nthe road, and in plain sight of the enemy. While the pieces were being\nunlimbered, which was only the work of an instant, an inquiry was made\nof Captain Boughton, of the 3d Cavalry, whose troop had just reached\nthis point, as to the position of our troops and of the enemy, with\nthe further remark that the battery had been under fire since eight\no’clock, and had not seen a Spaniard. “I can show you plenty of\nSpaniards,” replied Boughton, and, raising his hand, pointed toward\nthe San Juan blockhouse and the ridge in its vicinity, sweeping his\nhand toward the right. It was enough. Before his hand had fallen to\nhis side, the pieces were musically singing.",
        "Corp. Steigerwald turned and asked, “What is the range, sir?” To which\nwas instantly replied, “Block-house, 600 yards; the ridge to the\nright, 800 yards,” and Steigerwald’s piece was grinding 500 shots a\nminute within a quarter of a second, playing upon the San Juan\nblock-house. Serg. Green took 800 yards, and began to send his\ncompliments to the ridge beyond the block-house. In an instant Priv.\nSine, at Green’s gun, who was feeding, fell backward dead. At the same\ninstant Priv. Kastner fell out. Sine was shot through the heart,\nKastner through the head and neck. At this time Ryder’s gun began to\ntalk. It spoke very voluble and eloquent orations, which, although not\ndelivered in the Spanish language, were well understood by our\nfriends, the enemy, upon the hill.",
        "Serg. Green, at the right gun, had run back for ammunition, and Corp.\nDoyle, when Sine fell, seized the pointing lever, and was coolly\nturning the crank while he sighted the gun at the same time. He was\nfor the moment the only member of the detachment left at the piece,\nbut was given assistance, and a moment later Green arrived and began\nto feed the gun.",
        "Steigerwald was short-handed. Some of his men had been sun-struck\nduring the run, and he, too, was compelled to work his gun with only\none assistant. Then some of those who had been unable to keep up\narrived at the battery and began to render assistance. Priv. Van\nVaningham, who had gotten lost from his own command, began to pass\nammunition. Priv. Merryman, who was holding his team back in the\nriver, was impressed by a doctor to help carry wounded men, and Priv.\nBurkley, another man lost from his command, stepped into Merryman’s\nplace. Priv. Chase left his team, seeing the piece short-handed, and\nbegan to pass ammunition. The mules merely wagged their ears backward\nand forward and stamped on account of the flies.",
        "All these changes were accomplished, and the pieces had not even\nceased fire. Doyle had fed about 100 rounds, alone. Capt. Landis, of\nthe 1st Cavalry, arrived just at this time, and volunteered to assist\nin observing the effect of the fire. He stood fearlessly out in the\nmiddle of the road, just to the right of Green’s piece, in the very\nbest position for observation, but, at the same time, a most\nconspicuous target for the enemy, and observed the effect of the\nGatling fire, as though he were at target practice, reporting the\nsame, continually, to the battery commander.",
        "For the first two minutes the enemy seemed dazed, then suddenly a\nperfect hell of leaden hail swept through the foliage. The only thing\nthat saved the battery from absolute destruction was that the enemy’s\nshots were a little high. As it was, many of them struck the ground\nbetween the guns, and several hit the pieces. Three members of the\ndetachment were slightly hurt. One mule was shot through the ear. He\nsang the usual song of the mule, shook his head, and was suddenly hit\nagain on the fore leg. He plunged a little, but Priv. Shiffer patted\nhim on the head and he became quiet. A bullet passed by Shiffer’s\nhead, so close that he felt the wind fan his whiskers, and buried\nitself in the saddle on the same mule. This sudden concentration of\nthe enemy’s fire lasted about two minutes.",
        "About the same time the detachment heard a wild cheer start on the\nleft and gradually sweep around to the left and right, until in every\ndirection, sounding high above the din of battle and the crackling of\nthe Mausers, even above the rattle of the Gatling guns, was heard the\nyell of recognition from our own troops. There was, for an instant, a\nfurious fusillade on our right and left, and in a few moments the\nwhole line of our troops had risen and were moving forward to the San\nJuan ridge. While moving forward, they necessarily almost ceased to\nfire, but the fire of the Gatlings continued, deadly and accurate. A\ntroop of the 10th Cavalry, from our right and rear, came up, part of\nthe squadron commanded by Col. Baldwin. Some of this troop did not\nunderstand the Gatling gun drama, and were in the act of firing a\nvolley into our backs, when Lieut. Smith, who was to so heroically\nlose his life within ten minutes afterward, sprang out in front of the\nexcited troopers, and, with tears in his eyes, implored them not to\nfire, that these were “our own Gatlings.” They did not fire in our\ndirection, but they did give a most thrilling and welcome cheer, as\nthe squadron swept forward by our right. Col. Baldwin ran up, and\nshouted that he would place two troops in support of the battery as\nlong as they were needed. It was the first time the battery had ever\nhad a support of any kind.",
        "After a couple of minutes, the enemy’s fire perceptibly slackened. It\nwas evident they were seeking cover from our fire in the bottom of\ntheir ditches, and our fire at this time was being made chiefly from\nthe Gatling battery. This cessation of fire on the part of the enemy\nlasted about two minutes, and then the Gatling gunners observed the\nSpaniards climbing from their trenches. Until that time the Gatling\nbattery had been worked with dogged persistency and grim silence, but\nfrom that moment every member of the battery yelled at the top of his\nvoice until the command “Cease firing” was given. Groups of the enemy,\nas they climbed from their trenches, were caught by the fire of the\nguns, and were seen to melt away like a lump of salt in a glass of\nwater. Bodies the size of a company would practically disappear an\ninstant after a gun had been turned upon them.",
        "This flight of the enemy from their trenches had been caused by the\nfact that the charging line had cut through the barb-wire fences at\nthe foot of the hill, and had started up the slope. The Spaniards were\nunable to stay with their heads above the trenches to fire at the\ncharging-line, because of the missiles of death poured in by the\nmachine guns; and to remain there awaiting the charge was certain\ndeath. They did not have the nerve to wait for the cold steel. They\nwere demoralized because they had been compelled to seek the bottom of\ntheir trenches. American troops would have awaited the charge, knowing\nthat the machine gun fire must cease before contact could occur, but\nthe Spaniards forgot this in their excitement, and made the fatal\nmistake of running.",
        "The Gatlings had the range to perfection. Capt. Boughton, who was one\nof the first officers upon the hill, stated, on the 1st of September\nat Montauk, that he visited a portion of the Spanish trenches\nimmediately upon arriving at the crest, and that the trenches which he\ninspected were literally filled with writhing, squirming, tangled\nmasses of dead and wounded Spaniards, and that the edge of the\ntrenches was covered with wounded and dead Spaniards, who had been\nshot in the act of climbing out. This execution was done mainly by the\nmachine guns, because the infantry and cavalry were not firing much\nwhen it was done; they were running up the hill to the charge.",
        "Colonel Egbert, who commanded the 6th Infantry, states, in his\nofficial report, that when his regiment reached the sharp incline near\nthe top of the hill they were brought to a standstill because the\nGatling bullets were striking along the crest. The officers of the\n13th Infantry state the same thing. It was Lieut. Ferguson, of the\n13th, who when the troops had climbed as high as possible under the\nleaden canopy which the Gatlings made to cover their charge, waved his\nwhite handkerchief as a signal to cease firing. At the same moment\nLandis exclaimed, “Better stop; our men are climbing the hill now.” A\nshrill whistle gave the signal “Cease firing,” and the Gatling Gun\nBattery, to a man, rose to their feet and gazed with absorbing\ninterest as the long, thin, blue line swept forward and crowned the\ncrest of the hill. An instant later an American flag floated proudly\nfrom the San Juan block-house; then the roar of musketry and the\nvolley of rifles indicated that the fleeing enemy was receiving warm\nmessengers as he ran down the hill toward his second line of\nintrenchments.",
        "The next immediate duty confronting the detachment was to take stock\nof losses and to occupy the captured position in case of necessity.",
        "Private Sine had been killed and Private Kastner was supposed to be\nmortally wounded. Private Elkins fell exhausted just as the Stars and\nStripes were run up on the block-house. He had been knocked down by\nthe pole of a limber, which struck him over the kidneys, but had\ncontinued to feed his gun until the very last. He was utterly\nexhausted. Sergeant Green had been wounded slightly in the foot, but\nnot enough to disable him. Private Bremer had been hit early in the\nmorning by the fragment of a shell on the hand. One or two other\nmembers had been merely touched, grazed by balls. Private Greenberg\nhad been overcome by the heat. Merryman, one of the teamsters, as\nstated before, had been seized to carry wounded. Private Lauer was\nmissing and Dellett sunstruck. Private Hoft had joined the battery on\nhearing it go into action, and it was necessary to send someone back\nas guard over the camp equipage. A volunteer was called for, and it\nwas with the utmost difficulty that a member of the detachment,\nPrivate Pyne, was induced to take this duty. He shot four Spanish\nsharpshooters, who were shooting at our wounded and our medical\nofficers, out of trees near El Poso, during the remainder of the day.\nPrivate Chase had sprained his back so badly as to be unable to ride a\nmule; and two places were vacant for drivers. It was necessary to\ninstantly supply this deficiency. Private Burkley, 16th Infantry, who\nhad assisted in passing ammunition during the firing, volunteered to\ndrive one of the teams, and Private Correll the other. Private\nRaymond, 6th Cavalry, and Private Van Vaningham, of the same regiment,\nalso joined the detachment at this point, being separated from their\nown commands.",
        "The pieces were limbered up as soon as these dispositions could be\nmade, except Sergeant Ryder’s gun, which had bent the pintle-pin and\nconsequently could not be limbered quickly. The other two pieces and\nthe limber belonging to Ryder’s gun were moved forward on a run to the\ncaptured position on the San Juan ridge, gun crews riding or following\nas best they could. Both pieces went into action on the right of the\nroad. A limber was then sent back for Ryder’s gun, and it was brought\nup, Priv. Shiffer performing this duty under a perfect hail of\ndropping fire. In advancing from the position at the ford to the\ncaptured position it was necessary to cut three barb-wire fences. The\nmembers of the detachment behaved with the utmost coolness, all\nworking together to remove these obstructions, and not a man sought\nshelter, although a dropping fire was striking around the detachment,\nfrom some source. Where this fire came from it was impossible to tell;\nbut it did not come from the enemy.",
        "The two pieces which first reached the top of the hill were halted\nunder shelter of the crest, while the ground above was reconnoitered.\nIt was instantly observed that the enemy was coming back for a\ncounter-charge. Accordingly the pieces were immediately run to the top\nof the hill, the drivers, Shiffer and Correll, riding boldly up and\nexecuting a left-about on the skirmish line, where the skirmishers\nwere lying down. The pieces were unlimbered and instantly put into\naction at point-blank range, the skirmishers giving way to the right\nand left to make way for the guns. The enemy was less than 300 yards\naway, and apparently bent on recovering the position.",
        "The fire immediately became very hot. A skirmisher, who had thought to\ngain a little cover by lying down beside the wheel of the right gun\n(Green’s), was shot through the arm. “I knowed it,” he growled; “I\nmight have knowed that if I got near that durned gun, I’d get potted.\"\nHe rolled down behind the crest; a soldier produced an emergency\npacket, staunched the blood, and the wounded soldier, finding no bones\nbroken, returned to the firing-line and resumed his work. The enemy,\nat this part of the line, began to waver and again broke toward his\nsecond line of intrenchments.",
        "Just at this moment, Lieut. Traub came up and shouted, “Gen. Wood\norders you to send one or two of your guns over to help Roosevelt.\"\nThe order to move the guns was disregarded, but Traub pointed out the\nenemy, which was menacing Col. Roosevelt’s position, and insisted.\nAbout 600 yards to the right, oblique from the position of the guns\nand perhaps 200 yards, or less, in front of the salient occupied by\nCol. Roosevelt and the 3d Cavalry (afterward called Fort Roosevelt),\nthere was a group of about 400 of the enemy, apparently endeavoring to\ncharge the position. There was no time to notify the second piece.\nSerg. Green’s gun was instantly turned upon this group, at point-blank\nelevation. The group melted away. Capt. Marcotte states that, after\nthe surrender, some Spanish officers, whom he met, and who were\nmembers of this group, described this to him, stating that the enemy\nseen at this point was a body of about 600 escaping from El Caney;\nthat they were struck at this point by machine gun fire so effectively\nthat only forty of them ever got back to Santiago; the rest were\nkilled.",
        "Serg. Green’s gun, already heated to a red heat by the continuous\nfiring of the day, had been worked to its extreme limit of rapidity\nwhile firing at this body of the enemy, and on ceasing to fire,\nseveral cartridges exploded in the gun before they could be withdrawn.\nA ball lodged in one barrel from one of these explosions, and this\npiece was drawn down out of action just as the piece which had been\nleft at the ford returned. Subsequently the disabled piece was sent\nback to the ford, with the idea that that would be a safer place to\noverhaul it than immediately in rear of the firing-line. The piece\nremained at the ford until the night of the 3d of July, when it was\nbrought up to the battery, then at Fort Roosevelt, and on the 4th was\nfinally overhauled and put into action. This led to the impression, on\nthe part of some of the command, that one of the Gatlings had been\nblown up, which was not true. The gun was not injured, except that one\nbarrel could not be used during the remainder of the fighting, but the\ngun was used on the morning of the 4th, and during the whole of the\nengagement on the 10th and 11th, as well as on outpost duty, using\nnine barrels instead of ten.",
        "Following this repulse of the enemy, which occurred about 4:30 p. m.,\nthere was a lull in the firing. Advantage was taken of this to visit\nCol. Roosevelt’s position and inspect the line of battle. Upon\nreaching the salient, Col. Roosevelt was seen walking up and down\nbehind his line, encouraging his men, while a group of them was held,\njust in the rear of the crest, in charge of Maj. Jenkins, to support\nthe firing-line if necessary. On the right of the Rough Riders, the 3d\nCavalry were in the fight, and Capt. Boughton was again encountered.",
        "The firing suddenly began again, and it was remarkable to observe the\ncoolness with which these two officers sauntered up and down the line,\nutterly regardless of the bullets, which were cutting the grass in\nevery direction. There were no soft places on this part of the hill.\nThe enemy’s sharpshooters, up in high trees, were able to see every\npoint of the crest, and were dropping their shots accurately behind it\nat all points.",
        "Just at this moment, Serg. Weigle came up with his gun. Serg. Weigle\nhad had a hard time. His gun had been taken, under direction of Lieut.\nMiley, to a point near the San Juan farm-house, and pulled to the top\nof the hill. Weigle, whose only idea of a battle, at this time, was a\nchance to shoot, had been, to his intense disgust, restrained from\nopening fire. Then the piece had been taken down from the hill and\naround to the left of the line, where Lieut. Miley’s duty as aide had\ncarried him, to observe the progress of the battle, and Weigle had\nbeen again denied the privilege of “potting” a Spaniard. He was the\nmost disgusted man in the American Army; he was furious; he was\nwhite-hot; he was so mad that the tears rolled down his cheeks, as he\nreported with a soldierly salute, “Sir, Serg. Weigle reports, with his\ngun. Lieut. Miley did not allow me to open fire. I would like to have\norders.”",
        "In spite of the critical condition of the engagement, it was extremely\nludicrous; but the reopening of the fire at this moment presented an\nopportunity to accommodate the sergeant to his heart’s content. He was\ndirected to run his piece up on the firing-line, report to the officer\nin charge thereof, and go into action as soon as he pleased. Within\nthirty seconds he was getting his coveted opportunity. He fired until\nhis gun became accidentally jammed, pulled it down behind the crest of\nthe hill and removed the defective cartridge, returned it and repeated\nthis operation, actually bringing the gun down three times, and\nreturning it into action, doing very effective work, and all the time\ndisplaying the utmost coolness and good judgment. A sharpshooter began\nto make a target of Weigle’s gun, and “potted” a couple of men\nbelonging to the cavalry near it. This made Weigle so mad that he\nturned the gun, for a moment, upon the tree in which the sharp-shooter\nwas concealed. That sharpshooter never shot again. Finally, Weigle’s\ngun got so hot, and he himself so cool, that he concluded the piece\nwas too warm for further firing. So he ran it down behind the hill,\nand ran his detachment back on the hill with rifles, and, during the\nremainder of the evening, the members of this crew practiced with\n\"long Toms” upon the Spanish soldiers.",
        "On returning to the other two pieces near the road, they were moved to\nanother position, on the other side of the road. This precaution was\njudicious in order to conceal the pieces, or change their position,\nbecause the enemy had pretty thoroughly located them in the previous\nbrush, and it was rather dangerous to remain at that place. It was now\nnearly sundown. Scarcely had the pieces opened at this new position,\nwhen a battery of the enemy’s artillery, located near the hospital,\nbegan to fire at them. There was a heavy gun, which made a deep\nrumbling sound, and this sound was supplemented by the sharp crack of\na field-piece. A shell came whistling overhead and exploded within\nthirty yards of the battery, just beyond it. Another one came, and\nthis time the enemy’s artillery was located. Quick as a flash, the two\nGatlings were turned upon the enemy’s guns at the 2000-yard range.\nAnother shell came whistling along and exploded about ten feet\noverhead and twenty feet in rear of the battery. It tore up the grass\nin rear of the battery. After this engagement was over, Priv. Shiffer\npicked up the still hot fuse of this last shell. It was a large brass\ncombination fuse, and set at eight seconds, which justified the\nestimated range. This third shell was the last one the enemy was able\nto fire from these pieces. The powerful field-glasses which were used\nin locating the battery revealed the fact that as soon as the Gatling\nguns were turned on it, the Spanish gunners ran away from their\npieces. The big gun turned out to be a 16-centimeter converted bronze\npiece, mounted on a pintle in barbette, rifled and using smokeless\npowder. It was also found that they were firing four 3-inch\nfield-pieces of a similar character in this battery, as well as two\nmountain guns.",
        "It is claimed that this is the first time in the history of land\nfighting that a battery of heavy guns was ever put out of action by\nmachine-gun fire. This battery of the Spanish was never afterward able\nto get into action. Their pieces, which had been loaded for the fourth\nshot, were found on the 18th of July, still loaded, and a Spanish\nofficer gave the information that they had lost more than forty men\ntrying to work that battery, since the 1st of July. This is accounted\nfor by the fact that this Spanish battery was made the subject of\ncritical observation by the Gatling Gun Detachment from this time on.",
        "During this last engagement it had been necessary to obtain more men\nto assist in carrying ammunition, and Capt. Ayers, of the 10th\nCavalry, had furnished a detail, consisting of Serg. Graham and\nPrivates Smith and Taylor, Troop E, 10th Cavalry. These colored\nsoldiers proved to be excellent. They remained with the battery until\nthe end of the fighting on the 17th, and were in every respect the\npeers of any soldier in the detachment. Serg. Graham was recommended\nfor a medal of honor. Privates Smith and Taylor did as good service,\nwere as willing, as obedient, as prompt, and as energetic in the\ndischarge of their duties as any commanding officer could wish to\nhave. It is a great pleasure to be able to give this testimony to the\nmerits of our colored troopers, and to say, in addition, that no\nsoldiers ever fought better than the “Brunettes” of the 9th and 10th\nCavalry, who fought from the 3d of July until the 12th, near or with\nthe Gatlings.",
        "After the firing at the ford had ceased, Capt. Marcotte had returned\nto El Poso to investigate the movements of our artillery. These were\nthen, and have remained, one of those inscrutable and mysterious\nphenomena of a battle; incomprehensible to the ordinary layman, and\ncapable of being understood only by “scientific” soldiers. The charge\nupon the San Juan ridge was practically unsupported by artillery. No\nAmerican shells had struck the San Juan block-house; none had struck\nor burst in its vicinity; not even a moral effect by our artillery had\nassisted in the assault. So Marcotte had gone to investigate the\nartillery arm. He returned at sundown, and brought the information\nthat our baggage was safe at El Poso; that Private Pyne, still alive\nand unhurt, had been doing good work against the enemy’s\nsharpshooters; and, better than all this, had brought back with him a\ncanteen of water from the San Juan River and a pocket full of\nhardtack. He poured out his hardtack, and it was equally distributed\namong the members of the detachment, each man’s share amounting to two\npieces. Each man was also given a sup of water from the canteen, and\nthis constituted their only supper on that night, as they had been\ncompelled to throw away everything to keep up with the guns. Having\ndisposed of that, exhausted Nature could do no more; they lay down in\nthe mud where they stood, and slept so soundly that even the firing\nwhich occurred that night did not arouse them from their slumbers.\nThey were not disturbed until Best’s Battery began to occupy this hill\nabout four o’clock in the morning. They were then aroused and the\nGatling guns were drawn down, and the whole battery moved to the\nsalient occupied by the Rough Riders, because their position was at\nthat time closest to the enemy, and, as was determined by the previous\nday’s reconnaissance, offered a chance to enfilade several of the\nenemy’s trenches with machine gun fire.",
        "To dispose of the subject of artillery, it may be said that Best’s\nBattery and some other artillery occupied the ground vacated by the\nGatlings on the morning of July 2d, fired four shots, and then\nwithdrew with more haste than dignity. They remarked, “This is the\nhottest fire to which artillery has been subjected in modern times,\"\nand lit out to find a cooler place. They found it–so far in rear that\ntheir fire was almost equally dangerous to friends and foes on account\nof the close proximity of the two firing-lines. The obvious conclusion\nis that machine guns can live at close ranges, where artillery can not\nstay. There is no better light artillery in the world than that which\nhad to withdraw from San Juan block-house and its vicinity, on the\nmorning of July 2d.",
        "The situation of affairs on the night of the 1st of July was rather\ncritical. The plan which the general had laid down had been delayed in\nexecution at El Caney, while the impetuousity of the troops had\nprecipitated an unexpected rapidity of movement at San Juan. Capron’s\nBattery had opened at El Caney about half past seven o’clock, with\nbadly aimed and ill-directed fire, which did very little damage to the\nenemy. The troops engaged in this part of the battle were pushed\nforward until, by about eleven o’clock, they had become pretty\nthoroughly deployed around the vicinity of Las Guamas Creek. They had\nalso extended slightly to the right and to the left toward the Du\nCuorot house. The Spanish forts obstinately held out, and the handful\nof Spanish soldiers in El Caney and vicinity stubbornly resisted the\nattack made by our troops.",
        "About nine o’clock, Hamilton’s right piece, No. 3 of Capron’s Battery,\nsucceeded in planting a shell directly in the old stone fort, which\nknocked a hole in the masonry; but, just at this juncture, the battery\nwas ordered to cease firing at the blockhouse, and to shell the\nenemy’s trenches. The enemy forthwith utilized the hole made in the\nwall by the shell as a loop-hole, and continued to fire through it\nuntil the fort was taken by the infantry assault at about half-past\nfour o’clock. No worse commentary than this could possibly be made\nupon the tactical handling of this battery of artillery, because,\nhaving obtained perfectly the range of the enemy’s stronghold, it was\nsimply asinine not to knock that block-house to pieces immediately.",
        "So Lawton’s Division had remained in front of El Caney, held by about\n1000 Spaniards, while the shadows crept from the west to the north,\nfrom the north to the northeast, and from the northeast toward the\neast. It was coming toward night before the artillery was finally\nturned loose. One corner and the roof of this block-house were knocked\noff, but even then the artillery was so poorly handled that the enemy\nhad to be dislodged from this block-house by hand-to-hand fighting, A\nsingle Hotchkiss gun, properly handled, should have converted it into\nruins in thirty minutes.",
        "While these events were transpiring, Kent and Wheeler, constituting\nthe left wing of the army, had moved forward on the El Poso road,\nparallel to the Aguadores River, as far as the San Juan had captured\nthe San Juan farm-house, and had gradually deployed to the right and\nto the left along the San Juan River. About one o’clock their line had\nswept forward and had captured the first ridge between the San Juan\nand the city of Santiago, the “San Juan ridge,” driving the enemy on\nthis portion of the field into their last trenches. But the right\nflank of this wing was entirely unsupported, and the road by the way\nof Fort Canosa to San Juan, passing by the portion of the line\nsubsequently occupied by the dynamite gun, marked the extreme position\nof the right of this wing of the army. The enemy was already well\ntoward its right, and had the excellent El Caney road to move upon. He\nwas thoroughly familiar with the country, while the troops composing\nthis wing were exhausted by the charge. This wing had no reserve that\nthe firing-line knew of, and, as a matter of fact, had none except two\nbattalions of the 71st New York, which had not got into battle, and\nwhich were scattered along the road from the San Juan River to\nSiboney.",
        "The position occupied by the left wing of the army was a strong\nnatural position, but had no protection for the right flank. In this,\nLawton’s Division did not execute the part of the battle assigned to\nit. Thus the officers on the San Juan ridge, who knew anything about\nthe plan of the battle, were constantly directing their gaze, at every\nlull in the fighting, toward El Caney, and to the right of Gen. Wood’s\nposition, but there were no indications of the approach of Gen.\nLawton.",
        "Returning now to the right wing: the San Juan block-house and the\nridge in its vicinity having been captured, a glance at the map will\nshow that the retreat of the Spanish forces at El Caney was in\nimminent danger of being cut off. This capture occurred at 1:23-1/2 p.\nm. The Spanish commander at El Caney had been killed about noon, his\nmen had suffered heavily, and the new commanding officer discovered\nthat his retreat by the El Caney road was threatened. The only other\nline of retreat was by way of the San Miguel and Cuabitas roads. The\nSpanish forces at El Caney were also running low in their ammunition,\nand it was therefore decided to withdraw. Portions of the Spanish\ntroops did withdraw, some by way of the El Caney road toward Santiago;\nthe remainder, some 350 or 400, were crushed in the final charge upon\nEl Caney, between 4 and 4:30 o’clock.",
        "Gen. Lawton’s Division then proceeded down the El Caney road to Santa\nCruz, passing by way of the masonry bridge. This was about dusk. The\ndivision marched in columns of fours, with the artillery in front in\ncolumn of sections, and without even an advance guard thrown out. The\nartillery had passed the masonry bridge and had nearly reached the\nSanta Cruz farm-house, when the order was given to halt. The division\nhalted in the road and began to cook supper. Fires were kindled, and\ncoffee put on to boil. Suddenly, a few shots came scattering over the\nridge and dropped in among the troops. A messenger was sent back to\nGen. Shafter to inform him that further advance in this direction was\nnot practicable, as the enemy had been encountered in force. The\nposition this division was destined, in the beginning, to occupy was\nwithin less than 300 yards of where it halted. There was no large body\nof Spanish troops in that portion of the field. The whole valley\nbetween that ridge and Santiago had been swept by machine gun fire\nduring the afternoon. It is possible that there might hare been a few\nSpanish pickets on the ridge, but this is not believed to be probable.\nThere was some firing about this time from the Spanish trenches near\nFort Canosa, at the 13th Infantry upon the hill where the dynamite gun\nwas subsequently placed. A glance at the map will show that these\nshots, having passed over the hill, would drop in the vicinity of the\nmasonry bridge and the Santa Cruz farm-house. This was the firing that\nalarmed Lawton’s Division and caused the report mentioned to be sent\nback to General Shafter.",
        "This statement of the conditions has been necessary in order to\nunderstand why the counter-march was made by Lawton’s Division. The\nposition at El Caney had ceased to be of any importance as soon as the\nSan Juan block-house and ridge were taken; any Spanish troops\nremaining at El Caney were necessarily victims. But it was vitally\nimportant to hold the position gained by the left wing. The appearance\nof a heavy force of the enemy in front of the masonry bridge could\nsignify only one thing, and that was that the left wing, with its\nright flank in the air, was liable to be doubled up at any moment by a\nheavy force of the enemy striking it upon that flank. Further, that\nGen. Lawton, with this column advancing on the El Caney road as before\nexplained, was liable to be struck at the head of his column and\nsimilarly doubled up. The enemy would thus interpose between the two\nwings of the army, cutting Lawton off, and probably defeating the army\nin detail, unless something be done immediately.",
        "Of course, it is known now that this operation of the enemy was never\nprobable for an instant; but that was the status of affairs at\nmidnight on July 1st, as then reported to the commanding general.",
        "Lawton was, therefore, ordered to withdraw, by way of the El Caney\nroad, back to Gen. Shafter’s headquarters in rear of El Poso, from\nwhich position his division was rushed forward on the El Poso road to\nSan Juan on the 2d of July. His men were marched almost all night,\nalmost all day the next day, and were well-nigh utterly exhausted when\nthey reached a position in rear of the right flank of the left wing.\nIt was supposed, up to this time, at headquarters, that the\ninformation on which this marching was ordered was correct.",
        "During the time that Lawton had been countermarching from Santa Cruz,\nback by way of El Poso, there had been, as before stated, no reserve\nfor the left wing. The independent division of Gen. Bates had been\nordered to the front as rapidly as possible. Part of it had reached\nthe vicinity of El Poso, and from there one or two of the regiments\nhad participated in the fight, late on July 1st; but nobody on the\nfiring line knew anything about Bates’ independent division at this\ntime, and it was too much exhausted to be useful as a reserve. The\nmorning of the 2d it was used to extend the lines. It is therefore\nevident, now that the history of the battle is understood, that the\nGatling guns were the only effective reserve which the left wing of\nthe army had during the night of July 1st and all day on the 2d.",
        "Acting on this belief, the Gatling Gun Battery was placed in reserve,\nin the rear of Fort Roosevelt, on the morning of July 2d, and was held\nthere in reserve all day on July the 2d and 3d. The pieces were placed\nwithin twenty yards of the firing-line, just below the crest of the\nhill. The feed-guides were filled, and the gun crews lay down beside\ntheir pieces. The battery was ready to either support the firing-line\nagainst a charge, or protect its flank against a turning movement. But\nit was not considered necessary or desirable to run the pieces up on\nthe firing-line in the open, and participate in the trench-firing,\nwhich was the only fighting done on July 2d and 3d. It was considered\nthat the battery was too valuable as a reserve to sacrifice any of its\nmen uselessly. Some very well-meaning officers urged that the battery\nbe rushed up on the hill and put into action, but this was stubbornly\nrefused, under the third clause of the instructions given on the 1st\nof July, “to make the best use of the guns possible.” Gen. Wood and\nCol. Roosevelt were consulted, and they concurred with the above\nviews, and the battery remained in reserve.",
        "On the morning of the 2d of July a handsome young soldier, in the\nuniform of a Rough Rider, approached the battery commander, saluted,\nand said, “Col. Roosevelt directs me to report to you with my two\nguns.” Inquiry elicited the fact that the young trooper was Serg.\nWilliam Tiffany, that he had command of two Colt’s automatic\nrapid-fire guns, with a crew consisting of Corp. Stevens and six men,\nand that he had 4,000 rounds of 7-millimeter ammunition. Four thousand\nwas not a very large supply for two guns which could fire at the rate\nof 500 shots each per minute. Fortunately, the Gatling Gun Detachment\nhad found time, on the 1st of July, to collect about 10,000 rounds of\nMauser ammunition in the captured trenches, and a comparison of the\nMauser with the 7-millimeter ammunition at once disclosed the fact\nthat it was precisely the same ammunition which Tiffany had brought\nalong for his guns. The problem of ammunition supply for Tiffany’s\nguns was solved. He now had 14,000 rounds, and his guns became a very\npowerful reinforcement at this point.",
        "Serg. Tiff any and his men had carried these guns from Siboney to the\nfiring-line upon their backs. How they got the four boxes of\nammunition through they themselves could hardly tell. The firing was\ntoo heavy to mount the tripods in the trenches during the daytime, so\nplacing the guns was deferred until night. For some reason it was not\npracticable to place the tripods on the night of the 2d, and they were\nfinally placed on the night of the 3d; Serg. Tiffany, with two of his\nmen, aiding in digging the emplacements.",
        "While digging, suddenly a burst of firing broke out, and it was\nbelieved by many that a serious night attack had been made. During the\nfiring, Capt. Ayers, of the 10th Cavalry, and Col. Roosevelt again\ndisplayed those characteristics of fearless bravery which so endeared\nthese two gallant officers to their men. Some of the troops in the\ntrenches had begun to fire wildly. In fact, all the firing was done\nwild; there was no sense in any of it; there was no occasion for it.\nIntent listening to the enemy’s fire made it absolutely certain that\ntheir firing never approached nearer our lines. There may have been\nsome small body seeking to explore the road, but there was no\nindication of any attack in force. At any rate, Roosevelt and Ayers\ndetermined to stop the firing of our line, and suddenly, above the din\nof battle, these two officers could be heard, tramping up and down the\ntrench in front of their men, haranguing, commanding, ridiculing their\nmen for shooting in the dark. Ayers told his men that they were no\nbetter than the Cubans, upon which the burly black troopers burst into\na loud guffaw, and then stopped firing altogether. Roosevelt told his\nmen that he was ashamed of them. He was ashamed to see them firing\nvaluable ammunition into the darkness of the night, aiming at nothing;\nthat he thought cowboys were men who shot only when they could see the\n\"whites of the other fellow’s eyes.” They also stopped firing. The\nenemy’s bullets continued to whiz by for a few minutes, and they too\nceased firing, and everybody began to laugh at everybody else. Tiffany\nhad joined the two officers in their walk up and down, exposing\nhimself with the utmost coolness. He and his men now succeeded in\nplacing his guns in the trench, and, from that time until the end of\nthe fight, they could hardly be induced to leave them long enough to\neat; they didn’t leave them to sleep–they slept in the trench by the\nguns.",
        "About one o’clock on the 3d there was a lull in the firing, during\nwhich a flag of truce was sent with a communication to General Toral,\nnotifying him that a bombardment would follow unless he surrendered.\nThe firing was resumed and continued until about half past twelve on\nthe 4th of July, at which time another flag of truce went up, and\nthere was no more firing until the 10th of July at about three\no’clock. Troops, however, were compelled to lie on their arms; the\nrelief was constantly in the trenches, and the nervous strain was even\nworse than the actual dangers of battle.",
        "Negotiations for capitulation having failed, firing was resumed about\nthree o’clock on the 10th, and continued until one o’clock on the 11th\nof July. In this firing all four of the Gatling guns were used;\nTiffany’s guns and the dynamite gun under Serg. Borrowe participated.\nThree of the Gatling guns had been placed in the trench on the night\nof July 3d. The wheels were taken off and laid on the ground in the\nrear of the pieces; sand-bag revetments were built up in front of the\nguns, and each crew divided into two reliefs. One relief was required\nto be constantly at the gun and always ready for instant action. The\nfourth gun, the one that had been temporarily disabled, was repaired\non the 4th, thoroughly cleaned, and placed in reserve behind the crest\nof the hill. On the 4th of July, Serg. Borrowe had been directed to\nobey any instructions given him by the Gatling gun commander, and the\ndynamite gun had been placed in position to cooperate with the battery\nof machine guns. There were now, therefore, seven pieces in the\nbattery. It was the most powerful and unique battery ever used in\nbattle.",
        "The Sims-Dudley pneumatic dynamite gun throws a Whitehead torpedo,\ncarrying a charge of four and one-half pounds of explosive gelatine;\nthe effective force of this charge is equal to that of nine pounds of\ndynamite, No. 1. The charge explodes, on striking, by means of a\npercussion fuse, and steadiness of flight is secured by means of a\nvane. The propelling force is a charge of seven ounces of smokeless\npowder. The gun is pointed in the same manner as a mortar, and fired\nin the same manner as a field-piece. During the 10th and 11th\nconsiderable attention was devoted to the tactical cooperation of the\nguns composing this unique battery.",
        "The plan adopted was for the dynamite gun to throw a shell toward a\ndesignated point. Upon the explosion of this shell the Spanish\nsoldiers invariably exposed themselves, and were immediately assailed\nby machine gun fire. Occasionally a dynamite shell would fall with\nsufficient accuracy to do efficient work on its own account. On the\nafternoon of the 10th a dynamite shell fell in a long trench near Fort\nCanosa, clearing out the trench. The Spanish survivors were cut down\nalmost to a man by the machine gun fire, and the Spanish troops were\nunable to occupy this trench until the following morning, when the\noperation was repeated, practically destroying the usefulness of this\ntrench during the whole fight. Capt. Duncan, of the 21st Infantry,\nstates that this relieved his battalion of an enfilading fire, and was\na valuable service to them. Another dynamite shell, on the afternoon\nof the 10th, fell into a Spanish battery of artillery, near the brick\nhospital, and completely destroyed the battery, which consisted of two\n3-inch guns. In all, about a dozen dynamite shells were thrown with\nsome degree of accuracy, and with good effect.",
        "The fourth Gatling gun, which had been held in reserve, was used\nduring the afternoon of July 10th, and all day on the 11th, to pour a\nvertical fire upon the city of Santiago, beyond that portion that was\nvisible to the American troops. Perhaps 6,000 or 7,000 shots were thus\ndropped into the heart of the city, making the streets unsafe,\ncommunication difficult, and striking terror to the hearts of the\nSpanish troops who were held there in reserve. Gen. Toral, in his\nofficial statement to his own government, specifically mentions this\nfire as one of his principal reasons for surrender.",
        "On the afternoon of the 10th and during the 11th of July a battery of\nmortars, under command of Capt. Ennis, posted about half a mile to the\nright of the machine gun battery, threw a few shells at the enemy’s\nintrenchments. There were four of these mortars in action and they\nwere placed behind the ridge in a perfectly safe position. They threw,\nperhaps, twenty-five shells all told. The first eight or ten failed to\nexplode for the reason that the fuses had not been punched. Finally,\nCapt. Ennis discovered that his shells were not exploding, and, on\ninquiry, found that there was no fuse-punch in the battery. He\nsucceeded in finding a brad-awl, which, luckily, some member of the\nbattery had in his pocket, and showed a sergeant how to punch the fuse\nwith a brad-awl. After this the mortar shells exploded all right. None\nof this fire, however, was directed at the city; it was directed at\nthe trenches of the enemy, and not over eight or ten of the shells\nfell with any precision. The mortar fire was effective in the sense\nthat it tended to demoralize the enemy, but its material effect was\nvery small.",
        "There was no firing of field-pieces during all this time of which any\naccount is necessary. The field-pieces were even less useful during\nthis time than they were on the 1st of July, if such a thing could be\npossible.",
        "On the night of the 4th of July the reserve Gatling gun was posted to\ncommand the Fort Canosa road, in support of a picket on that road, and\nfrom that time until the surrender this piece was posted there every\nnight. The members, therefore, of this detachment did practically\ndouble duty. This was the gun in charge of Sergts. Weischaar and\nRyder, referred to in the official report. Luckily, it was not fired,\nbut there can be no doubt of the immense value it would have had if\nits use had been necessary.",
        "Summing up the use of machine guns from the 2d to the 11th of July,\ninclusive, it may be said that they demonstrated the use of the arm as\na tactical reserve and an auxiliary to an outpost, and that, in\ncombination with a dynamite gun, they demonstrated that a new arm of\nthe service had been formed which can live at closer range to the\nenemy, and do far more effective work, than artillery. Nor is this all\nto be considered. It should be remembered that a field-piece throws a\nshell which breaks into 273 fragments. The machine gun throws 1000\nshots, and each of these shots is aimed with absolute precision.\nTherefore, at any effective range, the machine gun is far superior to\na field-piece against anything except material obstacles. Of course\nthe machine guns will not do to batter down stone walls, nor to\ndestroy block-houses. It had already been demonstrated on the 1st of\nJuly that “machine guns can go forward with the charging-line to the\nlodgment in the enemy’s position,” and that “their presence on the\nfield of battle, with a supply of ammunition for ten minutes, is a\ndecisive factor in the engagement.”",
        "These were the principal points claimed for the machine gun in the\ndiscussion of the subject on the 1st of January. The use of the\nmachine gun for advance and rear guards was not demonstrated at\nSantiago, for the reason that no opportunity was presented.",
        "The white flag went up at one o’clock on the 11th, and this was the\nend of the fighting at Santiago. The Rough Riders had been moved from\nthe hill at Fort Roosevelt to a position west of the El Caney road,\nand one of the Gatling guns had been sent with them. This gun was\nbrought back on the 17th after the surrender. Various other movements\nof troops occurred before the 17th, which had been decided upon by the\ngenerals as the last day of grace. Gen. Toral had been notified that\none o’clock on the 17th was the time for either the surrender or the\nsignal for the assault. The hour approached, and still the Spaniard\nattempted to delay. The orders for the assault were issued. The troops\nlay in the trenches with their fingers on the triggers. Gen. Randolph\nhad come and pushed the artillery into better positions. The pieces\nwere loaded and the gunners stood with their lanyards in their hands.\nThe ammunition-boxes were opened. The nervous tension of the line was\nterrific. The troops on the extreme right and left, designated for the\nassault, were only waiting the word to dash forward upon the\nintrenchments of the enemy. Then suddenly from Gen. Wheeler’s\nheadquarters a mounted officer was seen spurring eastward along the\ncrest. He was waving his hat over his head. His horse gathered speed,\nand the foam began to fly from his flanks and nostrils, and as Capt.\nMcKittrick passed he called, “No cheering, please; the city and\nprovince of Santiago have surrendered.”",
        "The members of the Gatling Gun Detachment walked to the top of the\nhill, and, facing toward the gallant enemy who had so valiantly\ndefended the foredoomed city, silently took off their hats.",
        "All along the line the reception of the glorious news was marked by\ncomments upon the gallant defense which had been made. There was no\ndemonstration which could have hurt the feelings of so magnificent a\nfoe. Five minutes after the surrender the American trench was lined by\nAmerican troops on our side and Spanish troops on the other. The\nSpanish troops brought bottles of mescal, aguardiente, and wine. Our\ntroops carried hardtack and canned roast beef. These recent foes began\nat once to exchange the necessaries of life and souvenirs of the siege\nof Santiago. They fraternized as all brave men do after the battle. A\nfew Cubans skulked around the rear of our line, despised by both\nsides.",
        "The next day witnessed the formal surrender of the city. At twelve\no’clock, the preliminary formalities having been complied with, the\n9th Infantry and a battalion of the 13th Infantry, the two regiments\nwhich had been adjudged first honors in the assault, were ready as an\nescort to raise the flag in the heart of the city. All of the other\nregiments were formed upon the ground which they occupied during the\nsiege. As the second-hands of our watches showed the minute of twelve,\nnoon, a field-piece burst upon the stillness of the sultry day, and\nthe band began the strains of “The Star-spangled Banner.” Every hat\nwas taken off, and an instant later, efforts to restrain it being\nineffectual, six miles of solid cheering encompassed the latest\nAmerican city.",
        "Grizzled old soldiers, scarred with wounds from Indian wars, and gay\nrecruits who had arrived too late to join in the fighting, gray-haired\ngenerals and athletic young subalterns, all forgot propriety and the\nsilence usually enjoined in ranks and joined in that tremendous yell.\nFrom over on the right of the El Caney road we could hear the “Rah!\nrah! rah!” of Harvard and the “Rah! rah! rah!” of Yale, mingled with\nthe cowboy yell of the Indian Territory. From the ranks of the\nRegulars came the old Southern yell, mingled with the Northern cheer.\nThe most thrilling and dramatic moment of the Spanish-American War had\npassed into history.",
        "The troops settled themselves down to wait for developments, and while\nthey waited, opportunities were presented for the first time to make\nobservations of the personnel of this heterogeneous army.",
        "The American Regular is a type of his own, and no description of him\nis necessary. He was the fighting strength of the 5th Corps. Only\nthree Volunteer regiments participated in the charges of July 1st-the\n71st New York, the 2d Massachusetts, and the 1st Volunteer Cavalry.",
        "The Volunteers presented many different types: some good, some\notherwise. There should be no sympathy with that servile truckling to\npopular sentiment which speaks of our brave Volunteers indiscriminately,\nas if they were all good and all equally well instructed. There were\nVolunteers who were the equals of the Regulars in fighting and in\nleadership. And there were some who should have been at home pulling\non a nursing-bottle or attending a kindergarten. To praise them\nindiscriminately creates a false impression on the public, and works a\nrank injustice toward those who were really good and efficient in the\nservice. It does even worse than that: it fosters the popular idea\nthat all there is to do to make soldiers is to take so many laborers,\nclerks, hod-carriers, or farmers, and put on them uniforms, arm them\nwith rifles, and call them “gallant Volunteers”! Out upon such an\ninsane delusion!",
        "Fighting is a scientific trade. It would be no more absurd to give an\nidiot a tambourine and call him a musician–he would be an idiot all\nthe same. So with the clerk, the laborer, the hod-carrier, the\nteacher; he remains the same in spite of all the polished arms,\nresplendent uniforms, and pompous titles bestowed upon him. He remains\njust what he was before, until he learns his new trade and becomes a\nsoldier by the acquisition of the necessary knowledge and experience\nto practice his new calling.",
        "It is one of the duties of trained officers to tell these homely\ntruths to the people who have not made a study of the matter, in order\nthat they who foot the bills may understand what they pay for and why\nthey do it. And it is equally the duty of the citizen who has no\nknowledge of the subject to give a fair hearing to such statements,\nand, if he finds them correct after due investigation, to translate\nthe information thus imparted into such laws as will in future supply\nan army composed of soldiers who can fight, instead of a herd of\nignorant incompetents who die like rotten sheep within half an hour’s\nride by rail of their own homes.",
        "These remarks can be illustrated by observations in Cuba.",
        "For example, the 34th Michigan pitched its camp on the hill at Fort\nRoosevelt on the 2d of August. They were in an awful condition. A man\nhad died in one company the day before, and there had not been enough\nable-bodied men in the company to bury him. A detail had to be made\nfrom another company to dig the grave. More than fifty per cent of the\nregiment were sick, and the remainder were far from well. At this\ntime, more than two weeks after the surrender, they were still cooking\nindividually. Within fifteen minutes after their arrival they were\noverrunning the Gatling gun camp, picking up the firewood which had\nbeen gathered by the detachment for cooking purposes. An attempt to\nstop this marauding was received with jeers. A green-looking Wolverine\nat once began to make catcalls, and was ably seconded by his comrades.\nSentinels were then posted over the Gatling gun camp, with orders to\nkeep the Michiganders out; they abused the sentinels in the same\nmanner, and their officers made no effort to restrain them. It became\nnecessary to make a personal matter of it, which was promptly done,\nand one Wolverine was thereafter respectful–so respectful, in fact,\nthat he jumped to attention and took off his hat to even the privates\nof the detachment.",
        "The regiment took a delicate revenge. They had dug neither latrines\nnor sinks. Up to this time they used the surface of the camp-ground\nover their own camp for this purpose. They now took possession of a\ntrench within twenty yards of the battery’s tents. The nuisance was\nintolerable, and was reported to their brigade headquarters. No\nattention was paid to the report. Twelve hours later it was again\nreported, with the same result. Twelve hours after this it was a third\ntime reported, with the same result. In the meantime not a single\nshovelful of dirt had been thrown on the trench and an odor arose from\nit which was not exactly like the perfume of “Araby the blest.”",
        "Forty-five hours after the arrival of the regiment notice was served\nupon the brigade commander thereof that, unless the nuisance was\nabated immediately, a sentinel would be placed over the offending\nditch and notice would be given to General Bates, the division\ncommander, requesting the action of an inspector; notice was further\nserved that if any resistance were made, four Gatling guns would be\nturned loose upon the 34th Michigan and the regiment swept off the\nface of the hill and into Santiago Bay for a much-needed bath. It was\nenough. Officers and men ran instantly for spades and proceeded to\nfill up the trench. Report was then made to Gen. Bates, the division\ncommander, of the offense and action had thereon, with the information\nthat the Gatling gun commander awaited to answer any complaints. An\ninvestigation was immediately made, with the result that such action\nwas sustained.",
        "There were some ignorant Volunteers at Santiago, but of all the\nwillful violation of all the laws of sanitation, camp hygiene, and\nhealth ever seen, these particular Volunteers did the most outrageous\nthings. They threw their kitchen refuse out on the ground anywhere;\nhalf of the time they did not visit the sink at all, but used the\nsurface of the ground anywhere instead; and they continued these\noffenses at Montauk Point. They raked over an abandoned camp of the\nSpanish prisoners on their arrival at Fort Roosevelt, and appropriated\nall the cast-off articles they could find, using the debris for\nbedding. This surgeon, a “family doctor” from the pine woods in\nnorthern Michigan, did not seem to regard these matters as of any\nimportance. His attention was called to them, but he took no action.\nIn short, there was no law of health which these people did not\nutterly ignore, no excess dangerous to health which they did not\ncommit. Three-fourths of them were too sick for duty, and the rest\nlooked like living skeletons. They fairly wallowed in their own filth\n–and cursed the climate of Cuba on account of their sickness.",
        "In sharp contrast to the 34th Michigan was the 1st U. S. Volunteer\nCavalry, the Rough Riders. This was an organization the peer of any in\nthe Regular Army in morale, in fighting, and in every quality that\ngoes to make up a fine body of soldiers. They were picked men; all\nclasses were shown in that organization. The tennis champion was a\nprivate, the champion oarsman of Harvard a corporal. On the 2d of July\na stock-broker of Wall Street who can sign his check for $3,000,000\nwas seen haggling with a cow-puncher from the Indian Territory over a\npiece of hardtack. Both were privates and both were fine soldiers. The\nwhole regiment was just such a medley, but fought like Regulars, and\nendured like Spartans. They hung on like bull-dogs, and charged like\ndemons. They were as strict about the camp police as Regular Army\nsurgeons, and as punctilious about saluting as a K. O. on “official\nrelations.” Withal, they were a clean-mouthed, clean-clad,\nclean-camped lot of gentlemen, each in his way, from the “Hello,\npard!” of the cowboy to the frozen stare of the monocled dude from\nBroadway. And they fought–like Regulars; there is no other just\ncomparison. Roosevelt said: “They are the 11th Cavalry.” He found\nenthusiastic endorsers of this remark in every Regular who saw them\nfight. They were the finest body of Volunteers who ever wore uniform,\nand they were stamped indelibly with the personality of Theodore\nRoosevelt. Pushing, aggressive, resolute, tenacious, but self-contained,\ncool, and restrained, they represented the very best type of what the\nVolunteer ought to be–but often was not.",
        "Above them all, however, shone out three types.",
        "Theodore Roosevelt. He needs no eulogy from my pen. He has done\neverything, and in each occupation has been conspicuously successful.\nHe is, however, a born soldier. His virile frame contains the vigorous\nmind, the keen intellect, the cool judgment, and the unswerving,\nnever-hesitating courage of the natural soldier. He is affable and\ncourteous, or stern and scathing, as circumstances demand. One instant\ngenial smiles overspread his expressive countenance, whereon the\nfaintest emotion writes its legend with instantaneous and responsive\ntouch; the next, on occasion, a Jove-like sternness settles on his\nface, and, with a facility of expression bewildering to less gifted\ntongues, scathing invective, cutting sarcasm, or bitter irony impress\nupon an offender the gravity of a breach of discipline. Withal, he is\nmodest. He appreciates his own power, but there is no undue display of\nthat appreciation, no vainglorious boasting over achievements which\nread like a fairy-tale. Fittest to lead or follow, idol of every true\nsoldier. Who, that knows him as those who fought beside him, does not\nwish to see him at the head of that army and that nation of which he\nis the brightest ornament in every position, civil, military, or\npolitical?",
        "Woodbury Kane–social leader, Fortune’s favorite, aristocratic,\nrefined, cultured, wealthy, haut ton de haut ton, and sabreur sans\npeur et sans reproche–how shall I paint him to you as I learned to\nknow him in those dreadful, delightful seventeen days in which we\nlived only from instant to instant, and every man unconsciously bared\nhis soul to his comrades because he could not help it?",
        "A gentleman–he always looked that in the fullest sense of the word.\nWell groomed; in those days when our bed was a mud-puddle and our\ncanopy the stars, when the music which lulled us to sleep was the hum\nof the Mauser bullets and the vicious popping of the Remingtons, when\nwater to drink had to be brought at the peril of life for every\nmouthful, Kane turned up every morning clean-shaved and neatly\ngroomed, shoes duly polished, neat khaki, fitting like a glove and\nbrushed to perfection, nails polished, and hair parted as nicely as if\nhe were dressed by his valet in his New York apartments. How did he do\nit? We never knew. He kept no servant; he took his regular turn in the\nditches, in the mud, or torrid sun, or smothering rain. No night alarm\ncame that did not find Kane first to spring to the trench–and yet he\ndid it, somehow. The courteous phrases of politest speech fell ever\nfrom his ready lips, as easily as they would have done in the\nboudoir of any belle in the metropolis. The shrieking of a shell or\ntingling hiss of a sharpshooter’s close-aimed bullet never came so\nnear as to interrupt whatever polished expression of thanks, regret,\nor comment he might be uttering. And it was the real thing, too. The\ngentle heart was there. No man was readier to bind a wound or aid a\nsun-struck soldier in the ranks; none more ready to deny himself a\ncomfort or a luxury to help a more needy comrade. A braver man, a\nsurer or more reliable officer, never trod in shoe-leather. A grand\nexample to our pessimistic, socialistic friends and cheap demagogues\nof the sterling worth and noble, chivalric character of a “society man\nof wealth.” He is a living type of “Bel a faire peur,” without the\nidiotic sentimentality of that maudlin hero, and with all his other\ncharacteristics.",
        "Greenway and Tiffany. The one a Harvard football-player, just out,\nplunging into the great game of war with all the zest he formerly\nfound in the great college game. The other the petted son of wealthy\nparents, also a college graduate, and the idolized fiance of his\nchildhood’s sweetheart. Equally ready for fight or fun, they were the\nfinest type of youthful manhood to be found. Endowed by Nature with\nevery gift, educated at the best of colleges, bred in the best of\nsociety, ready to enter upon the most desirable of careers, they threw\nall upon the altar of country’s love. They entered battle as one might\ngo to a game or begin a play. All of unbounded zeal, youthful\nenthusiasm, restless energy, keen enjoyment–everything seemed to be\nequally acceptable to them, and no discomfort ever assumed any guise\nother than that of a novel and untried sensation.",
        "They are the type of our young manhood–our representative American\nyouth–as Roosevelt is of its vigorous manhood. They are the salt of\nthe earth, and Kane–is both salt and spice. All were comrades in\narms, types of American manhood unspoiled by Fortune’s favors, capable\nof anything and everything. Such men mould the destiny of this great\nnation, and in their hands it is safe.",
        "But neither of these two regiments is a fair type of the Volunteers;\nthey are the two extremes. For a type, take the 1st Illinois. They\nwere a Chicago regiment with fifteen years’ service, and they enlisted\nin a body to a man. They reached the firing line on the 10th and\nparticipated in the fight with two battalions, with distinguished\ngallantry. The third battalion was detailed on the necessary but\nunpleasant duty of caring for the yellow fever hospital at Siboney.\nThese city-bred Volunteers peeled off their coats, buried yellow fever\ncorpses, policed the hospital and hospital grounds, and nursed the\nvictims of the scourge. They did not utter a complaint nor ask for a\n\"soft” detail; they did their duty as they found it. Another battalion\nwas detailed immediately after the surrender to guard the Spanish\nprisoners. This most thankless duty was performed by them with\nfidelity and care. The commander of the battalion and half his\nofficers were proficient in the Spanish language as a part of their\npreparation for the campaign, and they soon established cordial\nrelations with the prisoners they were set to guard. It was a trying\nduty, but they performed it faithfully. Sickness visited this\nbattalion, and sometimes guard duty had to be performed with only one\nday off, but they never whimpered. The other battalion was detailed\nafter the surrender to do stevedore work at the commissary depot. The\nslender clerks and soft-handed city men slung boxes of hardtack and\nsacks of bacon and barrels of coffee, and performed manual labor with\nall the faithfulness that would be expected of men accustomed to such\nwork, and with never a complaint. The sanitary measures of this\nregiment were perfect, and they bore themselves like Regulars. It is\nnow recognized that this is a compliment to any Volunteer\norganization.",
        "In such a campaign as that of Santiago, a certain amount of suffering\nis inevitable. In such a climate as that of southern Cuba, a certain\namount of disease is unavoidable. In the very hot-bed of yellow fever\nand malaria, no army could hope to escape without contracting these\ndiseases; and in a campaign conducted with the marvelous celerity of\nthe one at Santiago, some difficulty in forwarding supplies must\nnecessarily be encountered.",
        "The root of all our difficulties lay in the fact that the commanding\ngeneral had under him supply departments whose officers reported to\nheads of bureaus not under control of the corps commander. This caused\nunnecessary delays in obtaining supplies, entailed confusion in their\ndistribution, and led to suffering beyond what was necessarily the\nresult of the climate and the campaign.",
        "A brief description of the method of obtaining supplies will make this\npoint more clear. When a given article was wanted, whether it was\nsoap, quinine, tentage, or transportation, a requisition upon the\nchief of the proper bureau at Washington had to be made, with full\nstatement of the reasons for the request; this requisition had to be\napproved by all intermediate commanders and go through military\nchannels to the chief of the bureau, who might or might not be\nconvinced of the necessity for the article wanted. His action being\nendorsed thereon, the requisition returned through the same devious\nroute, and possibly might be followed in course of time, either by\ninvoices from some distant purchasing agent of the required articles,\nor by directions of the bureau chief to make further explanations. The\nusual length of time allowed for an official communication through\nmilitary channels, in time of peace at home, from any regimental\nheadquarters to Washington and return, is from ten to thirty days.\nHere was the first cause of suffering.",
        "If the heads of the supply departments in the field, beginning at\nTampa, could have acted promptly upon the orders of their respective\ncommanding officers, without the action of any other authority,\nunnecessary delay would have been avoided.",
        "To illustrate this point: The Gatling Gun Detachment was ordered to be\nequipped with revolvers upon reporting to the detachment commander,\nand this order was issued on the 11th of June, before sailing from\nPort Tampa. They did not so report, and it devolved upon the\ndetachment commander to make requisition for the necessary equipment.\nThis was done, but no revolvers arrived. The invoices for revolvers\nreached the detachment commander on the 15th of September, at Fort\nLeavenworth, Kansas, where he was then, on leave of absence, sick, ten\ndays after the detachment was disbanded.",
        "This is an extreme case, but the same difficulty was experienced in\nobtaining supplies of all descriptions. It was, therefore, very\ndifficult for a quartermaster, a commissary, a medical officer, or any\nother officer whose duty it was to obtain supplies, to have the same\nwhen emergency demanded it. The necessity for supplies could not\nalways be foreseen, the quantity desired could not always be estimated\nfor with precision, and it followed that sometimes there was a\ndeficiency when the articles were needed.",
        "Again, the transportation of the 5th Army Corps could not be made\navailable at first to carry supplies up from the landing-place. The\ntroops had drawn travel rations, which lasted them until they\ndisembarked. The first supply problem, upon landing, was that of\nissuing rations; and, at the moment when every available boat was\nengaged in carrying troops ashore, it became necessary to put rations\nashore also. The exigency demanded the speedy disembarkation of the\ngreatest possible number of men. The fight of La Guasimas emphasized\nthe necessity of getting men to the front. It was no time to delay the\nmovement of troops for the purpose of waiting on wagons, tentage, or\nrations. The safety of the expedition, the fate of the whole campaign,\ndepended upon energetic and rapid movement to the front. Consequently\nregiments were put forth with only such amounts of rations and tentage\nas they could carry upon their backs. It will be readily seen that\nthis amount was very limited, and the only tentage possible was the\nshelter tent.",
        "There were 118 wagons in the hold of the Cherokee, but it was not\npracticable to delay the disembarkation of the corps and hazard the\nfate of the whole campaign by utilizing the only wharf and all the\nboats two or three days to land these wagons. By the time they could\nbe taken off, the rains had made the roads almost impassable, and they\ncould not all be used. It was therefore a daily struggle to get enough\nrations forward to feed the fighting-line from day to day. Greatly to\nthe credit of those who performed the duty, it can be said that, with\nrare exceptions, all the soldiers of the 5th Army Corps had every day,\nwhen they could possibly cook the same, hardtack and bacon, roast\nbeef, and coffee. This much was accomplished in the face of\ninsurmountable obstacles by the heroic exertions of the pack-train.\nWhen the 1st of July arrived, and the battle began, it was ordered\nthat all soldiers carry three days’ rations. The heat was intense, the\nfight exceedingly hot, and marching through the jungle extremely\ndifficult. The consequence was that the soldiers threw aside all\nimpedimenta in order to fight more effectively, and, of course, the\nrations went with the blankets and the overcoats. The man who held on\nto a canteen and haversack was fortunate; very many abandoned the\nhaversack, and a considerable number abandoned everything except rifle\nand ammunition. That was what won the fight; but it made hungry men,\nand it caused men to sleep on the wet ground under the open sky,\nwithout blankets or tentage. The pack-train continued its magnificent\nwork. During the fighting it had to bring ammunition. The men were\nsupposed to have three days’ rations. As soon as the deficiency became\nknown to the higher officials, the pack-train began to bring food.\nCommissary depots were established immediately in rear of the\nfiring-line, and issues of hardtack, bacon, and coffee, which were\nabout the only components of the ration that could be brought forward\nin sufficient quantities, were made without formality or red tape. It\nwas almost impossible to get a sufficient quantity of even these\ncomponents to the front. Sometimes the ration was a little short.\nBacon and hardtack for seventeen consecutive days, after three weeks\nof travel ration, do not form the most appetizing diet in the world.\nThe exposure consequent upon the fighting and lack of tentage had its\ninevitable result in sickness.",
        "The same difficulties which had beset the quartermaster and commissary\ndepartments were also encountered by the surgeons. Hospital\naccommodations were scanty, the quantity of medicines available was\nvery limited, the number of wounded men disproportionately large, and,\nwhen sickness was added to the wounds, the small number of surgeons\navailable at the front were not able to give the individual attention\nand scientific treatment which forms a part of our admirable medical\nsystem in time of peace. There were only three or four ambulances\navailable until after the 11th of July. A considerable number of the\nsurgeons were on duty at the general hospitals far in the rear; the\nnumber at the front was not sufficient to attend to all the duties\nwhich devolved upon them. This deplorable condition reacted, causing a\ngreater amount of illness. To add to this difficulty, the Volunteers\nbegan to suffer excessively from the results of their own ignorance\nand carelessness; and when the yellow fever scourge was added to all\nthe other difficulties which beset the 5th Corps, the outlook became\ngloomy.",
        "The attempt has been made in the foregoing exposition of the\nconditions at Santiago to represent fairly the difficulties under\nwhich all parts of the army labored. The fact remains, nevertheless,\nthat there was an appalling amount of suffering due to causes which\nmight have been foreseen and which were easily preventable.",
        "On the 18th day of July the transports entered the harbor of Santiago.\nFrom that day forward there was unlimited wharfage at disposal, and\nthere were excellent macadamized roads leading to all parts of the\ncommand. The fall of Santiago had been foreseen more than a week, and\nif there was not a sufficient quantity of wagons present on board the\nships, there had been ample time to make telegraphic requisition for\nthem to Washington. Up to the surrender, the suffering from sickness\nhad been exceedingly light. There was something stimulating about the\nnervous strain and excitement of the time which kept the men up to\ntheir work; but the inadequacy of the medical supplies on hand had\nbeen amply demonstrated by the 10th. and it had become fully apparent\nthat the medical corps was unable to handle the number of patients on\nhand. The previous remark about the practicability of telegraphing to\nheadquarters for additional force applies to this department also.",
        "The principal sufferings after the surrender were due to four causes:\nfirst, improper clothes; second, improper food; third, lack of\nshelter; fourth, lack of proper medical attention.",
        "In regard to clothing and these other necessaries, it should be borne\nin mind that the corps which went to Santiago was virtually the\nRegular Army. Every regiment which went to Tampa went there ready for\nservice. Its equipment was just as complete on the 26th of April as it\nwas on the 6th of June. There should have been no problems to solve in\nregard to them–and yet there were many.",
        "First–Clothing.",
        "The troops wore the same clothing to Cuba they had brought from\nSheridan, Assinniboine, and Sherman. They wore winter clothing for\ntheir service in the torrid zone, and those who received summer\nclothing at all received it late in August, just in time to return to\nthe bracing breezes of Montauk Point, where, in their enfeebled\ncondition, winter clothing would have been more suitable. It did not\nrequire a professor of hygiene to foresee that the winter clothing\nused in northern Michigan would not be suitable for campaigning in\nsouthern Cuba in July; or that summer clothing suitable for southern\nCuba would be too light for men returning to the northern part of Long\nIsland. Is it to be concluded that it was impossible to obtain summer\nclothing for 18,000 men between the 26th of April and the 6th of June?",
        "Second–Improper Food.",
        "Most of the troops were embarked upon the transports by the 10th of\nJune. Their food on transport consisted of the travel ration: canned\nroast beef, canned baked beans, canned tomatoes, and hardtack, with\ncoffee, were the components. They subsisted upon this food, imprisoned\nin fetid holds of foul transports, unfit for the proper transportation\nof convicts, until the 25th day of June, when they disembarked. On\ndrawing rations for the field it was found that the field ration would\nbe of the same components, with the addition of bacon and minus the\nbaked beans and tomatoes. During the emergency, up to include the 18th\nday of July, this was the ration. Occasionally a few cans of tomatoes\nfound their way to camp, but rarely. The ration was always short,\nsuch as it was, but this the soldiers could have endured and did\nendure without a murmur.",
        "But on the 18th of July, with unlimited wharfage at a distance of two\nmiles and a half, with excellent roads, and with abundance of\ntransportation (see Gen. Shafter’s Official Report), and with\nsurrender foreknown for a sufficient length of time to have brought\nany quantity of vegetables from New York City, the ration continued to\nbe bacon, canned beef, hardtack, and coffee. Finally, about the 25th\nof July, small amounts of soft bread began to be doled out, and an\noccasional issue of frozen fresh beef was made. It was soon\ndemonstrated that not sufficient fresh beef could be made available.\nThe vegetables which had been brought had nearly all spoiled on the\ntransports. Hundreds of barrels of potatoes and onions were unloaded\nupon the docks and were so badly decayed as to make them useless.\nThese vegetables had been drifting about the Caribbean Sea and upon\nthe Atlantic Ocean since the 9th and 10th of June. Occasionally it was\npracticable to get a quarter or a half ration of potatoes and half of\nthe usual allowance of canned tomatoes, but that was all.",
        "It did not require a professor of hygienic dietetics to predict that\nmen fed in the tropics upon a diet suited to the icy shores of\nGreenland would become ill, especially when they were clad in a manner\nsuited to the climate of Labrador. Are we to conclude that it was\nimpossible to get rice, beans, canned fruits, canned corn, and other\nvegetables to take the place of potatoes and onions?",
        "Third–Lack of Shelter.",
        "The allowance of tentage was prescribed for each regiment. Granted\nthat it was impossible to get tentage up until after the surrender;\nyet it should have been practicable to forward tentage over two and\none-half miles of macadamized roads. Yet whole regiments remained\nwithout tentage until they embarked for the United States. The 13th\nInfantry did not get tentage until the 5th of August. The 20th\nInfantry and the 3d Infantry obtained a portion of their tentage about\nthe same time, but a large part of these regiments remained under\nshelter tents until they reembarked. The 1st Illinois and the 34th\nMichigan remained in shelter tents until the 15th of August, at which\ntime the author embarked for the United States. These regiments are\nfair examples.",
        "The Gatling Gun Detachment was provided with shelter-halves and\nremained under them until the 10th of August. Repeated applications\nfor proper tentage were made, accompanied by medical certificates that\nthe issue of tentage was imperatively necessary for the health of the\ncommand. Endorsements thereon by the chief quartermaster of the 5th\nCorps as late as the 5th of August show that there was no available\ntentage for issue. Application was made to the regimental commander,\n13th Infantry, for a portion of regimental tentage for the detachment\nof the 13th Infantry; but, in spite of the fact that the reduced\nregiment had on hand all the canvas prescribed for the full regiment,\nnone could be obtained for the detachment. The detachment commander\nwas entirely without tentage from the 25th of June until the 5th of\nAugust–forty-five days in the rainy season in Cuba, exposed to the\ntorrid sun by day, to chilling dews by night, and the drenching rains\nof the afternoon, without shelter from any inclemencies of the\nweather, and this in spite of repeated applications to proper\nauthorities for the suitable allowance of tentage. Is it any wonder\nthat men grew sick, and that death stalked broadcast through the camp\nof the 5th Corps, under these conditions?",
        "Fourth–Lack of Proper Medical Attendance.",
        "The surgeons who were at the front with the firing-line worked\nheroically, but were burdened beyond their physical powers. Owing to\nthe foregoing causes, great numbers of men became ill as soon as the\nstrain and tension of the battle were relieved. It was not uncommon to\nfind twenty or twenty-five per cent of a command on the sick-report,\nand in some cases the sick-list went as high as fifty per cent. There\nwere no well men in the 5th Army Corps. Those who refused to go on the\nsick-report were, nevertheless, sick. The author has yet to find a\nsingle member of the expedition who did not suffer from the climatic\nfever. The surgeons themselves were not exempt, and the very limited\nsupply of doctors was speedily decreased by sickness. Were there no\ndoctors in the United States who were willing to come to Cuba?",
        "Up to the 25th of July the supply of medicines was very deficient.\nThere was never a sufficient supply of ambulances. The accommodations\nin the hospitals were even worse than those on the firing-line. A sick\nsoldier on the firing-line could always find some comrade who would\ncut green boughs or gather grass for a bed, but the one who went to\nthe hospital had to lie on the ground. The supply of hospital cots was\nridiculously inadequate, and this condition did not improve.",
        "The difficulty of obtaining adequate medical attendance may be\nillustrated by the case of Priv. Fred C. Elkins, of the 17th Infantry,\nmember of the Gatling Gun Detachment. Priv. Elkins had been hurt in\nthe fight on the 1st of July and had been sent to the hospital. He\nfound the accommodations so wretched that he feigned improvement and\nreturned to his detachment. He remained with the detachment until the\n14th of July, improving so far as his injury was concerned, but\ncontracted the climatic fever. During this time he was prescribed for\ntwice by the assistant surgeon with the Rough Riders, Dr. Thorpe,\nprevious to the time this regiment was moved westward on the\nfiring-line. His condition became worse, and on the 12th of July Dr.\nBrewer, 1st lieutenant and assistant surgeon with the 10th Cavalry,\nwas called upon to examine him. This surgeon had then under treatment\nover 100 cases pertaining to his proper command, and was himself ill,\nbut he readily came and inspected the patient. He promised to send\nmedicines for him, but in the rush of overwork forgot to do so, and on\nthe 13th of July he was again summoned. This time he sent a hospital\nattendant to take the patient’s temperature, which was 104 degrees. No\nmedicines were sent. On the 14th of July the patient became delirious.\nThe detachment commander went in person to request the same surgeon to\nattend to the case, he being the only one available at that time. The\nhospital attendant was again ordered to take the temperature. At the\nend of an hour even this had been neglected. The hospital man was\nsick, and had been without sleep for fifty hours. Priv. Elkins was put\nupon a board and carried to Brewer’s tent, with his descriptive list\nin his pocket. The surgeon was told the name of the patient and the\nfacts that he was related to a distinguished family and had been\nrecommended for a commission for gallantry upon the field of battle.\nDr. Brewer was himself suffering at the time, with a temperature of\n103 degrees, but he rose from his own sick-bed and administered\nremedies which relieved the patient. The following day, the third of\nhis illness, Dr. Brewer was found to be suffering from yellow fever,\nand was carried back to the yellow fever hospital at Siboney along\nwith Priv. Elkins. He had been sick all the time, but had done his\nbest. Priv. Elkins improved sufficiently to write a letter to his\ncommanding officer from the hospital at Siboney, on the 25th of July,\nwhich reached that officer at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, on the 12th\nday of September. In spite of the fact that the patient was furnished\nwith descriptive list, and was specially commended to the care of the\nsurgeon as a soldier marked for extreme gallantry, all trace of him\nhad been lost; and although two private detectives were searching for\nhim a month, no further clew had been found to his whereabouts or fate\nas late as the 1st of October. Even if his descriptive list had not\nbeen furnished with this man, the fact that he was alive and rational\nenough on the 25th day of July to write a letter concerning his\napproaching discharge should have made it easy for some record of his\ncase to have been kept.",
        "But this one isolated case sinks into insignificance beside the\ncondition in which some of the sick were left by commands returning to\nthe United States. All cases of yellow fever suspects were left\nbehind, and in the mad scramble to embark for the return voyage many\nof these were left without proper attention or supplies.",
        "Gen. Kent’s Division had left by the 11th of August. The following\nextract from a letter dated Santiago de Cuba, August 12, 1898, will\nconvey some idea of the condition in which the sick of this division\nwere left:",
        "“Yesterday Gen. Kent’s Division left for Montauk, and they left behind\n350 sick, many of them too ill to care for themselves. This humane\ncountry, of course, left ample care for them? There was left one\nsurgeon, one steward, and one case of medicines. Many of these men are\ntoo ill to rise. They are ’suspected’ of having yellow fever. They are\nsuffering from Cuban malaria, and many of them from diarrhea. There\nwas not left a single bed-pan for this battalion of bed-ridden,\nsuffering humanity, nor any well men to nurse the sick. There was not\neven left any to cook food for them. Those left by the 9th Infantry\nhad to bribe marauding, pilfering Cubans, with a part of their\nrations, to carry food to the camp of the 13th, where there were a few\nless ill, to get it cooked.",
        "“They are too sick to dig sinks; some are delirious. When the poor\nemaciated wrecks of manhood have to obey the calls of Nature, they\nmust either wallow in their own filth or stagger a few paces from\ntheir wet beds on the slimy soil to deposit more germs of disease and\ndeath on the surface already reeking with ghastly, joint-racking\nrheums.",
        "“There were left less than fifty cots for these 350 sick men–men\ncompelled by sheer weakness to lie on the ground which will soon lie\non them, if enough strong men are left by that time to cover them\nmercifully over with the loathsome, reeking vegetable detritus which\npasses here for soil, and which is so fairly animate that you can see\nevery spadeful of it writhe and wriggle as you throw it over the\nrotting hour-dead shell of what was a free American citizen and a\nChevalier Bayard.",
        "“When the last man and wagon of the flying division disappeared over\nthe hill toward health and home, a despairing wail went up from the\ndoomed 350 left in this condition of indescribable horror. ’We are\nabandoned to die!’ they cried; ’we are deserted by our own comrades in\nthe hour of danger and left to helplessly perish!’",
        "“These men are those who fought the climate, hunger, and the enemy on\nthe battle-field which has shed so much undying glory on the American\narms. They are the men who have accomplished unheard-of feats of\nendurance and performed incredible feats of valor on the same\nground–not for Cuba, but at the call of duty. They are citizens. They\nare brave soldiers who have done their full duty because it was duty.”",
        "The mail facilities were wretched. Cords of mail were stacked up at\nSiboney for weeks; and although there was more transportation on hand\nthan could be used, the officer detailed to attend to the mail\nbusiness of the corps, Lieut. Saville, of the 10th Infantry, could not\nsucceed in securing a wagon to haul this mail to the front. Since the\ncorps returned to the United States a dozen letters have reached the\nauthor which have chased him by way of Santiago and Montauk, since\ndates between the 1st and 20th of July, inclusive. The person to whom\nthese letters were addressed was well known to every officer and\nemployee in the corps, and if the mail addressed to one so well known\ncould go astray in this manner, what could an unknown private expect?\nThis may seem like a little hardship, but to men in the weakened and\nenfeebled condition of the survivors of the 5th Corps a letter from\nhome was both food and medicine. Scores of men who are to-day rotting\nin Cuban graves died of nostalgia, and might have lived if they had\nreceived the letters from home which were sent to them.",
        "The causes of these conditions are not far to seek. The United States\nhas not had an army since 1866. There has been no such a thing as a\nbrigade, a division, or a corps. There has been no opportunity to\nstudy and practice on a large scale, in a practical way, the problems\nof organization and supply. The Army has been administered as a unit,\nand the usual routine of business gradually became such that not a\nwheel could be turned nor a nail driven in any of the supply\ndepartments without express permission, previously obtained from the\nbureau chief in Washington. The same remarks apply equally to all the\nother staff departments. The administration had become a bureaucracy\nbecause the whole Army for thirty years had been administered as one\nbody, without the subdivisions into organizations which are inevitable\nin war-time and in larger bodies.",
        "War became a reality with great suddenness. Those who have grown gray\nin the service, and whose capacity, honesty, and industry had never\nbeen and can not be impeached, found themselves confronted with the\nproblem of handling nearly three hundred thousand men, without\nauthority to change the system of supply and transportation. The\nminutest acts of officers of these departments are regulated by laws\nof Congress, enacted with a view of the small regular force in time of\npeace, and with no provisions for modifications in war. In authorizing\nthe formation of large volunteer armies, Congress did not authorize\nany change in the system of administration or make any emergency\nprovision. As before, every detail of supply and transportation had to\nbe authorized from the central head.",
        "The administrative bureaus were handicapped to some extent by\nincompetent and ignorant members. Late in the campaign it was learned\nthat the way to a “soft snap” was through the Capitol, and some came\nin that way who would certainly never have entered the Army in any\nother.",
        "There were alleged staff officers who had tried to enter the service\nthrough the regular channels and who had failed, either by lack of\nability or bad conduct, to keep up with the pace set by classmates at\nthe Academy; there were others who were known as failures in civil\nlife and as the “black sheep” of eminent families; and there were some\nwho must have been utterly unknown before the war, as they will be\nafterward.",
        "How these persons ever obtained places high above deserving officers\nof capacity and experience is a question which cries aloud for\nexposure–but in a good many cases they did. Indeed, it is to be\nobserved that, for that matter, the next register of the Army will\nshow a great many more promotions into the Volunteer service, of\nofficers who never heard a hostile bullet during the war, who never\nleft the United States at all, than it will of deserving officers who\nbore the heat and burden of the march and the battle.",
        "The most discouraging thing about it all to a line officer is that\nthis same register will afford no means of determining who did the\nservice and who did the “baby act.” Lieut. Blank will be borne thereon\nas major and subsequently colonel of the Steenth Volunteers (which\nnever left the State rendezvous, probably) during the war with Spain;\nLieut. Blank No. 2 will be carried on the same book as second\nlieutenant, –– Infantry, during the same war. The gentle reader will\nat once “spot” the man who was so highly promoted as a gallant fellow\nwho distinguished himself upon the bloody field; the other will be set\ndown as the man who did nothing and deserved nothing.",
        "Yet–the ones who went received no promotion, and those who staid\nbehind and by their careless incompetence permitted camps amid the\npeaceful scenes of homes and plenty to become the hot-beds of fever\nand disease–these are the ones borne as field and other officers of\nthe Volunteers.",
        "To illustrate some of the material with big titles sent to “assist” in\nrunning the staff departments, two incidents will suffice.",
        "On the 11th of June, at a certain headquarters, it was desired to send\na message, demanding reply, to each transport. A gray-haired officer\nturned to another and said, “Whom shall we send with this? Will\nSo-and-so do?” naming one of the before-mentioned civil appointments.\n\"For heaven’s sake, no! He would tie up the whole business. Send an\norderly,” was the reply. The orderly, an enlisted man of the Regulars,\nwas sent. The officer thus adjudged less competent to carry a message\nthan a private soldier was perhaps actuated by a high sense of duty;\nbut he filled a place which should have been occupied by an\nexperienced and able officer–no, he did not fill it, but he prevented\nsuch a man from doing so.",
        "The second incident was related by an officer on a transport bound for\nhome. Say his name was–oh well, Smith.",
        "Smith went, on the 20th of July, to a certain headquarters in the\nfield on business. Those who could have attended to it were absent,\nbut there was one of the recent arrivals, a high-ranking aide, there,\nand he, sorry for Smith’s worn-out look of hunger, heat, and thirst,\nasked if he would have a drink. Smith, expecting at the best a canteen\nof San Juan River water, said he was a little dry.",
        "The newly-arrived clapped his hands, and, at the summons, a colored\nwaiter in spotless white duck appeared. “Waitah, take this gentleman’s\nordah,” said the host. Smith, greatly astonished, asked what could be\nhad, and was yet more astonished to learn that he could be served with\nCanadian or domestic whisky, claret, champagne, or sherry. Much\nbewildered, and utterly forgetting the awful dangers of liquor in the\ntropics, he called for Canadian Club. When it came, on a\nnapkin-covered tray, he looked for water, and was about to use some\nfrom a bucket full of ice which he at that moment espied. “Aw! hold\non,” exclaimed the host; “we nevah use that, don’t y’ know, except to\ncool the apollinaris. Waitah, bring the gentleman a bottle of\napollinaris to wash down his liquor.”",
        "Within half a mile were soldiers and officers lying sick in hospital\non the ground, eating hardtack and bacon, and drinking San Juan\nstraight, because hospital supplies and rations could not be got to\nthe front!",
        "It was this same officer who explained that he approached his\nheadquarters “by rushes,” upon his arrival, for fear the enemy would\nsee him and consider this reinforcement a violation of the truce.",
        "These are two examples of some of the able assistants from civil life\nwho were sent to help feed, clothe, and transport the 5th Corps.",
        "With such assistants, is it any wonder that, under such extraordinary\ncircumstances as those encountered in Cuba, a system designed for\npeace and 25,000 men weakened in some respects when the attempt was\nmade to apply it to 300,000 in time of war?",
        "The great wonder is that it did the work as well as it did. And this\nwas due to the superhuman exertions of the chief officers of the\nsupply departments and their experienced assistants. These men knew no\nrest. They were untiring and zealous. On their own responsibility they\ncut the red tape to the very smallest limit. Instead of the regular\nreturns and requisitions, the merest form of lead-pencil memorandum\nwas sufficient to obtain the necessary supplies, whenever they were\navailable. This much was absolutely necessary, for these officers were\npersonally responsible for every dollar’s worth of supplies and had to\nprotect themselves in some degree. As it is now, many of them will\nfind it years before their accounts are finally settled, unless some\nprovision be made by law for their relief. This disregard of routine\nwas essential; but how much to be desired is a system suited to the\nexigencies of the service, both in peace and war!",
        "There is a lesson to be learned from these experiences, and it is\nthis: The commanding officer of any army organization should not be\nhampered in the matter of supplies by having to obtain the approval or\ndisapproval of a junior in rank, in a distant bureau, who knows\nnothing about the circumstances. In other words, the system which\ncauses the staff departments of the United States Army to regard a\ncivilian as their head, and makes them virtually independent of their\nline commanders, is an utterly vicious system. If an officer is\ncompetent to command an organization, he should be considered\ncompetent to look after the details of its administration, and should\nbe held responsible, not only for its serviceable condition at all\ntimes, but for the care of its property and for all the other details\nconnected with its service.",
        "The quartermaster, or commissary, or other officer of a supply\ndepartment should not know any authority on earth higher or other than\nthe officer in command of the force he is to serve, except those in\nthe line above such chief, and then only when such orders come through\nhis chief.",
        "The commanding officer having ordered supplies to be procured, there\nshould be no question whatever in regard to their being furnished.\nThey should come at once and without fail. If they were not necessary,\nhold him responsible.",
        "This theory of administration eliminates the bureaucracy which has\ninsidiously crept upon the Army, and relegates to their proper\nposition the supply departments.",
        "The General Staff proper has a higher field of usefulness than the\nmere problems of supply. Its business is to care for the organization,\nmobilization, and strategic disposition of all the forces, both naval\nand military, of the United States. Its head should be the President,\nand the two divisions should be under the general commanding the Army\nand the admiral commanding the Navy. The remainder of this staff\nshould be composed of a small but select personnel, and should limit\nits duties exclusively to those set forth above.",
        "The detachment received permission on the 10th of August to use any\nstanding tentage which it could find, and it was thoroughly under\nshelter an hour after this permission was received. The climate of\nCuba was not so disagreeable when one could look at it through the\ndoor of a tent, but we were not destined to enjoy our tentage very\nlong. On the 15th, at two o’clock, orders were received to go on board\nthe Leona at Santiago, bound for Montauk Point, and at half-past\nfive o’clock men, guns, and equipment were duly stowed for the voyage\nhome.",
        "It was much more agreeable than the one to Cuba, The transport was not\ncrowded, the men had excellent hammocks, which could be rolled up\nduring the day, thus leaving the whole berth deck for exercise and\nventilation, and the Leona was a much better vessel than the Cherokee.",
        "The detachment finally disembarked at Montauk Point on the 23d, passed\nthrough the usual detention camp, and was assigned a camping-place. It\nwas disbanded per instructions from headquarters, Montauk Point, on\nthe 5th of September, the members of the detachment returning to their\nrespective regiments, well satisfied with the work they had done and\nwith each other.",
        "In concluding this memoir the author desires to pay a personal tribute\nof admiration and respect to the brave men composing the detachment,\nboth individually and collectively. Some of them have figured more\nprominently in these pages than others, but there was not a man in the\ndetachment who was not worthy to be called the highest term that can\nbe applied to any man–a brave American soldier.",

        "The successful accomplishment of the campaign against Santiago de\nCuba, resulting in its downfall and surrender of Spanish forces, the\ncapture of large military stores, together with the destruction of the\nentire Spanish fleet in the harbor, which, upon the investment of the\ncity, was forced to leave, is one of which the Army can well be proud.",
        "This has been accomplished through the heroic deeds of the Army and\nits officers and men. The major-general commanding offers his sincere\nthanks for their endurance of hardships heretofore unknown in the\nAmerican Army.",
        "The work you have accomplished may well appeal to the pride of your\ncountrymen and has been rivaled upon but few occasions in the world’s\nhistory. Landing upon an unknown coast, you faced dangers in\ndisembarking and overcame obstacles that even in looking back upon\nseem insurmountable. Seizing, with the assistance of the Navy, the\ntowns of Baiquiri and Siboney, you pushed boldly forth, gallantly\ndriving back the enemy’s outposts in the vicinity of La Guasimas, and\ncompleted the concentration of the army near Sevilla, within sight of\nthe Spanish stronghold at Santiago de Cuba. The outlook from Sevilla\nwas one that might have appalled the stoutest heart. Behind you ran a\nnarrow road made well-nigh impassable by rains, while to the front you\nlooked upon high foot-hills covered with a dense tropical growth,\nwhich could only be traversed by bridle-paths terminating within range\nof the enemy’s guns. Nothing daunted, you responded eagerly to the\norder to close upon the foe, and, attacking at El Caney and San Juan,\ndrove him from work to work until he took refuge within his last and\nstrongest entrenchment immediately surrounding the city. Despite the\nfierce glare of a Southern sun and rains that fell in torrents, you\nvaliantly withstood his attempts to drive you from the position your\nvalor had won, holding in your vise-like grip the army opposed to you.\nAfter seventeen days of battle and siege, you were rewarded by the\nsurrender of nearly 24,000 prisoners, 12,000 being those in your\nimmediate front, the others scattered in the various towns of eastern\nCuba, freeing completely the eastern part of the island from Spanish\ntroops.",
        "This was not done without great sacrifices. The death of 230 gallant\nsoldiers and the wounding of 1,284 others shows but too plainly the\nfierce contest in which you were engaged. The few reported missing are\nundoubtedly among the dead, as no prisoners were taken. For those who\nhave fallen in battle, with you the commanding general sorrows, and\nwith you will ever cherish their memory. Their devotion to duty sets a\nhigh example of courage and patriotism to our fellow-countrymen. All\nwho have participated in the campaign, battle, and siege of Santiago\nde Cuba will recall with pride the grand deeds accomplished, and will\nhold one another dear for having shared great suffering, hardships,\nand triumphs together.",
        "All may well feel proud to inscribe on their banners the name of\nSantiago de Cuba.",

        "Sir,–I have the honor to submit the following report of the campaign\nwhich terminated in the fall of Santiago de Cuba and the adjacent\nterritory, and the establishment of the military government therein.",
        "The expedition was undertaken in compliance with telegraphic\ninstructions of May 30, 1898, from Headquarters of the Army, in which\nit was stated:",
        "“Admiral Schley reports that two cruisers and two torpedo boats have\nbeen seen in the harbor of Santiago. Go with your force to capture\ngarrison at Santiago and assist in capturing harbor and fleet.”",
        "On this date there were a large number of transports in Port Tampa\nBay, which had been collected for the purpose of an expedition which\nit had been previously contemplated I should command, and for such\nother emergencies as might arise. Orders were immediately given for\nloading aboard those transports the necessary subsistence and\nquartermaster supplies, and for the embarkation of the authorized\nnumber of troops and their material. General Orders No. 5, from these\nheadquarters, indicate the organizations it was at first proposed to\ntake.",
        "The order is as follows:",
        "“Headquarters 5th Army Corps,\n\"Tampa, Fla., May 31, 1898.",
        "“The following troops will hold themselves in readiness to move\nimmediately on board transports upon notification from these\nheadquarters:",

        "“2. The Battalion of Engineers.",
        "“3. The detachment of the Signal Corps.",
        "“4. Five squadrons of cavalry, to be selected by the commanding\ngeneral of the cavalry division, in accordance with instructions\npreviously given.",
        "“5. Four batteries of light artillery, to be commanded by a major, to\nbe selected by the commanding officer of the light artillery brigade.",

        "“8. All troops will carry, in addition to the fourteen (14) days’\nfield rations now on hand, ten (10) days’ travel rations.",
        "“9. The minimum allowance of tentage and baggage as prescribed in\nG. O. 54, A. G. O., c. s., will be taken.",
        "“10. In addition to the rations specified in paragraph 8 of this\norder, the chief commissary will provide sixty (60) days’ field\nrations for the entire command.",
        "“11. All recruits and extra baggage, the latter to be stored,\ncarefully piled and covered, will be left in camp in charge of a\ncommissioned officer, to be selected by the regimental commander.\nWhere there are no recruits available, the necessary guard only will\nbe left.",
        "“12. Travel rations will be drawn at once by the several commands, as\nindicated in paragraph 8.",
        "“By command of Maj.-Gen. Shafter.",
        "“E. J. McClernand,\n\"A. A. G.”",
        "This order was afterwards changed to include twelve squadrons of\ncavalry, all of which were dismounted because of lack of\ntransportation for the animals, and because it was believed, from the\nbest sources of information obtainable, that mounted cavalry could not\noperate efficiently in the neighborhood of Santiago. This was found\nsubsequently to be correct.",
        "The facilities at Tampa and Port Tampa for embarking the troops and\nthe large amount of supplies required were inadequate, and with the\nutmost effort it was not possible to accomplish this work as quickly\nas I hoped and desired.",
        "On the evening of June 7th I received orders to sail without delay,\nbut not with less than 10,000 men.",
        "The orders referred to caused one division, composed of Volunteer\ntroops, commanded by Brig.-Gen. Snyder, and which it had been intended\nto include in my command, to be left behind. I was joined, however, by\nBrig.-Gen. Bates, who had already arrived on transports from Mobile,\nAla., with the 3d and 20th Infantry and one squadron of the 2d Cavalry\nwith their horses, the latter being the only mounted troops in my\ncommand.",
        "After some of them had already reached the lower bay, telegraphic\ninstructions were received from the honorable Secretary of War,\ndirecting that the sailing of the expedition be delayed, waiting\nfurther orders. This delay was occasioned by the Navy reporting that a\nSpanish war vessel had been sighted in the Nicholas Channel. The ships\nin the lower bay were immediately recalled. On the next day, in\ncompliance with instructions from the adjutant-general of the Army,\nthe necessary steps were taken to increase the command to the full\ncapacity of the transports, and the expedition sailed on June 14th\nwith 815 officers and 16,072 enlisted men.",
        "The passage to Santiago was generally smooth and uneventful. The\nhealth of the command remained remarkably good, notwithstanding the\nfact that the conveniences on many of the transports, in the nature of\nsleeping accommodations, space for exercise, closet accommodations,\netc., were not all that could have been desired. While commenting upon\nthis subject, it is appropriate to add that the opinion was general\nthroughout the Army that the travel ration should include tomatoes,\nbeginning with the first day, and that a small quantity of canned\nfruit would prove to be a most welcome addition while traveling at sea\nin the tropics. If the future policy of our Government requires much\ntransportation for the military forces by sea, definite arrangements\nshould be determined upon to provide the necessary hammock\naccommodations for sleeping. Hammocks interfere immeasurably less than\nbunks with the proper ventilation of the ships and during the day can\nbe easily removed, thus greatly increasing space for exercise;\nmoreover, they greatly diminish the danger of fire.",
        "While passing along the north coast of Cuba one of the two barges we\nhad in tow broke away during the night, and was not recovered. This\nloss proved to be very serious, for it delayed and embarrassed the\ndisembarkation of the army. On the morning of June 20th we arrived off\nGuantanamo Bay, and about noon reached the vicinity of Santiago, where\nAdmiral Sampson came on board my headquarters transport. It was\narranged between us to visit in the afternoon the Cuban general\n(Garcia) at Aserraderos, about eighteen miles to the west of the\nMorro. During the interview Gen. Garcia offered the services of his\ntroops, comprising about 4,000 men in the vicinity of Aserraderos and\nabout 500, under Gen. Castillo, at the little town of Cujababo, a few\nmiles east of Baiquiri. I accepted his offer, impressing it upon him\nthat I could exercise no military control over him except, such as he\nwould concede, and as long as he served under me I would furnish him\nrations and ammunition.",
        "Ever since the receipt of my orders I had made a study of the terrain\nsurrounding Santiago, gathering information mainly from the former\nresidents of the city, several of whom were on the transports with me.\nAt this interview all the possible points of attack were for the last\ntime carefully weighed, and then, for the information and guidance of\nAdmiral Sampson and Gen. Garcia, I outlined the plan of campaign,\nwhich was as follows:",
        "With the assistance of the small boats of the Navy, the disembarkation\nwas to commence on the morning of the 22d at Baiquiri; on the 21st 500\ninsurgent troops were to be transferred from Aserraderos to Cujababo,\nincreasing the force already there to 1,000 men. This force, under\nGen. Castillo, was to attack the Spanish force at Baiquiri in the rear\nat the time of disembarkation. This movement was successfully made. To\nmislead the enemy as to the real point of our intended landing, I\nrequested Gen. Garcia to send a small force (about 500 men), under\nGen. Rabi, to attack the little town of Cabanas, situated on the coast\na few miles to the west of the entrance to Santiago harbor, and where\nit was reported the enemy had several men intrenched, and from which a\ntrail leads around the west side of the bay to Santiago.",
        "I also requested Admiral Sampson to send several of his warships, with\na number of my transports, opposite this town, for the purpose of\nmaking a show of disembarking there.",
        "In addition, I asked the admiral to cause a bombardment to be made at\nCabanas and also at the forts around the Morro and at the towns of\nAguadores, Siboney, and Baiquiri. The troops under Gen. Garcia\nremaining at Aserraderos were to be transferred to Baiquiri or Siboney\non the 24th. This was successfully accomplished at Siboney.",
        "These movements committed me to approaching Santiago from the east\nover a narrow road, at first in some places not better than a trail,\nrunning from Baiquiri through Siboney and Sevilla, and making attack\nfrom that quarter. This, in my judgment, was the only feasible plan,\nand subsequent information and results confirmed my judgment.",
        "On the morning of the 22d the Army commenced to disembark at Baiquiri.\nThe following general order indicates the manner in which the troops\nleft the transports and the amount of supplies carried immediately\nwith them:",
        "“Headquarters 5th Army Corps,\n\"On board S. S. Seguransa,\n\"At Sea, June 20, 1898.",

        "“1. Under instructions to be communicated to the proper commanders,\ntroops will disembark in the following order:",
        "“First–The 2d Division, 5th Corps (Lawton’s). The Gatling Gun\nDetachment will accompany this division.",
        "“Second–Gen. Bates’ Brigade. This brigade will form as a reserve to\nthe 2d Division, 5th Corps.",

If no\nserious opposition be offered this artillery will be unloaded after\nthe mounted squadron.",
        "“2. All troops will carry on the person the blanket-roll (with\nshelter-tent and poncho), three days’ field rations (with coffee,\nground), canteens filled, and 100 rounds of ammunition per man.\nAdditional ammunition, already issued to the troops, tentage, baggage,\nand company cooking utensils will be left under charge of the\nregimental quartermaster, with one non-commissioned officer and two\nprivates from each company.",

        "“4. The chief quartermaster of the expedition will control all small\nboats and will distribute them to the best advantage to disembark the\ntroops in the order indicated in paragraph 1.",
        "“5. The ordnance officer–2d Lieut. Brooke, 4th Infantry–will put on\nshore at once 100 rounds of ammunition per man, and have it ready for\ndistribution on the firing-line.",
        "“6. The commanding general wishes to impress officers and men with the\ncrushing effect a well-directed fire will have upon the Spanish\ntroops. All officers concerned will rigidly enforce fire discipline,\nand will caution their men to fire only when they can be see the\nenemy.",

        "The small boats belonging to the Navy and the transports, together\nwith a number of steam launches, furnished by the Navy, were brought\nalongside and loaded with troops as prescribed in the order just\nquoted. When Gen. Lawton’s Division was fairly loaded in the small\nboats, the latter were towed in long lines by the steam launches\ntoward the shore. The sea was somewhat rough, but by the exercise of\ncaution and good judgment the beach was reached and the troops\ndisembarked satisfactorily. As a precaution against a possible attack\nupon the part of any Spaniards who might have been hidden in the\nadjacent block-houses and woods, the Navy opened a furious cannonade\non these places while the troops were moving toward the shore. It was\nlearned afterward that the Spanish garrison had retired in the\ndirection of Siboney soon after daylight.",
        "By night about 6,000 troops were on shore. Gen. Lawton was ordered to\npush down a strong force to seize and hold Siboney.",
        "On the 23d the disembarkation was continued and about 6,000 more men\nlanded. Early on this date Gen. Lawton’s advance reached Siboney, the\nSpanish garrison of about 600 men retiring as he came up, and offering\nno opposition except a few scattering shots at long range. Some of the\nCuban troops pursued the retreating Spaniards and skirmished with\nthem. During the afternoon of this date the disembarkation of Kent’s\nDivision was commenced at Siboney, which enabled me to establish a\nbase eight miles nearer Santiago and to continue the unloading of\ntroops and supplies at both points.",
        "The disembarkation was continued throughout the night of the 23d and\n24th, and by the evening of the 24th the disembarkation of my command\nwas practically completed.",
        "The orders for June 24th contemplated Gen. Lawton’s Division taking a\nstrong defensive position a short distance from Siboney, on the road\nto Santiago; Kent’s Division was to be held near Santiago, where he\ndisembarked; Bates’ Brigade was to take position in support of Lawton,\nwhile Wheeler’s Division was to be somewhat to the rear on the road\nfrom Siboney to Baiquiri. It was intended to maintain this situation\nuntil the troops and transportation were disembarked and a reasonable\nquantity of necessary supplies landed. Gen. Young’s Brigade, however,\npassed beyond Lawton on the night of the 23d-24th, thus taking the\nadvance, and on the morning of the latter date became engaged with a\nSpanish force intrenched in a strong position at La Guasima, a point\non the Santiago road about three miles from Siboney. Gen. Young’s\nforce consisted of one squadron of the 1st Cavalry, one of the 10th\nCavalry, and two of the 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry; in all,\n964 officers and men.",
        "The enemy made an obstinate resistance, but were driven from the field\nwith considerable loss. Our own loss was 1 officer and 15 men killed,\n6 officers and 46 men wounded. The reported losses of the Spaniards\nwere 9 killed and 27 wounded. The engagement had an inspiring effect\nupon our men and doubtless correspondingly depressed the enemy, as it\nwas now plainly demonstrated to them that they had a foe to meet who\nwould advance upon them under a heavy fire delivered from\nintrenchments. Gen. Wheeler, division commander, was present during\nthe engagement and reports that our troops, officers and men, fought\nwith the greatest gallantry. His report is attached, marked “A.” This\nengagement gave us a well-watered country farther to the front on\nwhich to encamp our troops.",
        "My efforts to unload transportation and subsistence stores, so that we\nmight have several days’ rations on shore, were continued during the\nremainder of the month. In this work I was ably seconded by\nLieut.-Col. Charles F. Humphrey, deputy Q. M. G., U. S. A., chief\nquartermaster, and Col. John F. Weston, A. O. G. S., chief commissary;\nhut, notwithstanding the utmost efforts, it was difficult to land\nsupplies in excess of those required daily to feed the men and\nanimals, and the loss of the scow, mentioned as having broken away\nduring the voyage, as well as the loss at sea of lighters sent by\nQuartermaster’s Department was greatly felt. Indeed, the lack of steam\nlaunches, lighters, scows, and wharves can only be appreciated by\nthose who were on the ground directing the disembarkation and landing\nof supplies. It was not until nearly two weeks after the army landed\nthat it was possible to place on shore three days’ supplies In excess\nof those required for the daily consumption.",
        "After the engagement at La Guasima, and before the end of the month,\nthe army, including Gen. Garcia’s command, which had been brought on\ntransports to Siboney from Aserraderos, was mostly concentrated at\nSevilla, with the exception of the necessary detachments at Baiquiri\nand Siboney.",
        "On June 30th I reconnoitered the country about Santiago and made my\nplan of attack. From a high hill, from which the city was in plain\nview, I could see the San Juan Hill and the country about El Caney.\nThe roads were very poor, and, indeed, little better than bridle-paths\nuntil the San Juan River and El Caney were reached.",
        "The position of El Caney, to the northeast of Santiago, was of great\nimportance to the enemy as holding the Guantanamo road, as well as\nfurnishing shelter for a strong outpost that might be used to assail\nthe right flank of any force operating against San Juan Hill.",
        "In view of this, I decided to begin the attack next day at El Caney\nwith one division, while sending two divisions on the direct road to\nSantiago, passing by the El Pozo house, and as a diversion to direct a\nsmall force against Aguadores, from Siboney along the railroad by the\nsea, with a view of attracting the attention of the Spaniards in the\nlatter direction and of preventing them from attacking our left flank.",
        "During the afternoon I assembled the division commanders and explained\nto them my general plan of battle. Lawton’s Division, assisted by\nCapron’s Light Battery, was ordered to move out during the afternoon\ntoward El Caney, to begin the attack there early the next morning.\nAfter carrying El Caney, Lawton was to move by the El Caney road\ntoward Santiago, and take position on the right of the line. Wheeler’s\nDivision of dismounted cavalry, and Kent’s Division of infantry, were\ndirected on the Santiago road, the head of the column resting near El\nPozo, toward which heights Grimes’ Battery moved on the afternoon of\nthe 30th, with orders to take position thereon early the next morning,\nand at the proper time prepare the way for the advance of Wheeler and\nKent, on San Juan Hill. The attack at this point was to be delayed\nuntil Lawton’s guns were heard at El Caney and his infantry fire\nshowed he had become well engaged.",
        "The remainder of the afternoon and night was devoted to cutting out\nand repairing the roads, and other necessary preparations for battle.\nThese preparations were far from what I desired them to be, but we\nwere in a sickly climate; our supplies had to be brought forward by a\nnarrow wagon road, which the rains might at any time render\nimpassable; fear was entertained that a storm might drive the vessels\ncontaining our stores to sea, thus separating us from our base of\nsupplies; and, lastly, it was reported that Gen. Pando, with 8,000\nreinforcements for the enemy, was en route from Manzanillo, and\nmight be expected in a few days. Under these conditions, I determined\nto give battle without delay.",
        "Early on the morning of July 1st, Lawton was in position around El\nCaney, Chaffee’s Brigade on the right, across the Guantanamo road,\nMiles’ Brigade in the center, and Ludlow’s on the left. The duty of\ncutting off the enemy’s retreat along the Santiago road was assigned\nto the latter brigade. The artillery opened on the town at 6:15 a. m.\nThe battle here soon became general, and was hotly contested. The\nenemy’s position was naturally strong, and was rendered more so by\nblock-houses, a stone fort, and intrenchments cut in solid rock, and\nthe loop-holing of a solidly built stone church. The opposition\noffered by the enemy was greater than had been anticipated, and\nprevented Lawton from joining the right of the main line during the\nday, as had been intended. After the battle had continued for some\ntime, Bates’ Brigade of two regiments reached my headquarters from\nSiboney. I directed him to move near El Caney, to give assistance if\nnecessary. He did so, and was put in position between Miles and\nChaffee. The battle continued with varying intensity during most of\nthe day and until the place was carried by assault about 4:30 p. m. As\nthe Spaniards endeavored to retreat along the Santiago road, Ludlow’s\nposition enabled him to do very effective work, and to practically cut\noff all retreat in that direction.",
        "After the battle at El Caney was well opened, and the sound of the\nsmall-arm fire caused us to believe that Lawton was driving the enemy\nbefore him, I directed Grimes’ Battery to open fire from the heights\nof El Pozo on the San Juan block-house, which could be seen situated\nin the enemy’s intrenchments extending along the crest of San Juan\nHill. This fire was effective, and the enemy could be seen running\naway from the vicinity of the block-house. The artillery fire from El\nPozo was soon returned by the enemy’s artillery. They evidently had\nthe range of this hill, and their first shells killed and wounded\nseveral men. As the Spaniards used smokeless powder, it was very\ndifficult to locate the position of their pieces, while, on the\ncontrary, the smoke caused by our black powder plainly indicated the\nposition of our battery.",
        "At this time the cavalry division, under Gen. Sumner, which was lying\nconcealed in the general vicinity of the El Pozo house, was ordered\nforward with directions to cross the San Juan River and deploy to the\nright of the Santiago side, while Kent’s Division was to follow\nclosely in its rear and deploy to the left.",
        "These troops moved forward in compliance with orders, but the road was\nso narrow as to render it impracticable to retain the column of fours\nformation at all points, while the undergrowth on either side was so\ndense as to preclude the possibility of deploying skirmishers. It\nnaturally resulted that the progress made was slow, and the long-range\nrifles of the enemy’s infantry killed and wounded a number of our men\nwhile marching along this road, and before there was any opportunity\nto return this fire. At this time Generals Kent and Sumner were\nordered to push forward with all possible haste and place their troops\nin position to engage the enemy. Gen. Kent, with this end in view,\nforced the head of his column alongside of the cavalry column as far\nas the narrow trail permitted, and thus hurried his arrival at the San\nJuan and the formation beyond that stream. A few hundred yards before\nreaching the San Juan the road forks, a fact that was discovered by\nLieut.-Col. Derby of my staff, who had approached well to the front in\na war balloon. This information he furnished to the troops, resulting\nin Sumner moving on the right-hand road, while Kent was enabled to\nutilize the road to the left.",
        "Gen. Wheeler, the permanent commander of the cavalry division, who had\nbeen ill, came forward during the morning, and later returned to duty\nand rendered most gallant and efficient service during the remainder\nof the day.",
        "After crossing the stream, the cavalry moved to the right with a view\nof connecting with Lawton’s left, when he could come up, and with\ntheir left resting near the Santiago road.",
        "In the meantime Kent’s Division, with the exception of two regiments\nof Hawkins’ Brigade, being thus uncovered, moved rapidly to the front\nfrom the forks previously mentioned in the road, utilizing both\ntrails, but more especially the one to the left, and, crossing the\ncreek, formed for attack in front of San Juan Hill. During the\nformation the 2d Brigade suffered severely. While personally\nsuperintending this movement, its gallant commander, Col. Wikoff, was\nkilled. The command of the brigade then devolved upon Lieut.-Col.\nWorth, 13th Infantry, who was soon severely wounded, and next upon\nLieut.-Col. Liscum, 24th Infantry, who, five minutes later, also fell\nunder the terrible fire of the enemy, and the command of the brigade\nthen devolved upon Lieut.-Col. Ewers, 9th Infantry.",
        "While the formation just described was taking place, Gen. Kent took\nmeasures to hurry forward his rear brigade. The 10th and 2d Infantry\nwere ordered to follow. Wikoff’s Brigade, while the 21st was sent on\nthe right-hand road to support the 1st Brigade, under Gen. Hawkins,\nwho had crossed the stream and formed on the right of the division.\nThe 2d and 10th Infantry, Col. E. P. Pearson commanding, moved forward\nin good order on the left of the division, passed over a green knoll,\nand drove the enemy back toward his trenches.",
        "After completing their formation under a destructive fire, and\nadvancing a short distance, both divisions found in their front a wide\nbottom, in which had been placed a barbed-wire entanglement, and\nbeyond which there was a high hill, along the crest of which the enemy\nwas strongly posted. Nothing daunted, these gallant men pushed on to\ndrive the enemy from his chosen position, both divisions losing\nheavily. In this assault Col. Hamilton, Lieuts. Smith and Shipp were\nkilled, and Col. Carroll, Lieuts. Thayer and Myer, all in the cavalry,\nwere wounded.",
        "Great credit is due to Brig.-Gen. H. S. Hawkins, who, placing himself\nbetween his regiments, urged them on by voice and bugle calls to the\nattack so brilliantly executed.",
        "In this fierce encounter words fail to do justice to the gallant\nregimental commanders and their heroic men, for, while the generals\nindicated the formations and the points of attack, it was, after all,\nthe intrepid bravery of the subordinate officers and men that planted\nour colors on the crest of San Juan Hill and drove the enemy from his\ntrenches and block-houses, thus gaining a position which sealed the\nfate of Santiago.",
        "In this action on this part of the field most efficient service was\nrendered by Lieut. John H. Parker, 13th Infantry, and the Gatling Gun\nDetachment under his command. The fighting continued at intervals\nuntil nightfall, but our men held resolutely to the positions gained\nat the cost of so much blood and toil.\nI am greatly indebted to Gen. Wheeler, who, as previously stated,\nreturned from the sick-list to duty during the afternoon. His\ncheerfulness and aggressiveness made itself felt on this part of the\nbattle-field, and the information he furnished to me at various stages\nof the battle proved to be most useful.",
        "My own health was impaired by overexertion in the sun and intense heat\nof the day before, which prevented me from participating as actively\nin the battle as I desired; but from a high hill near my headquarters\nI had a general view of the battle-field, extending from El Caney on\nthe right to the left of our lines on San Juan Hill. His staff\nofficers were stationed at various points on the field, rendering\nfrequent reports, and through them, by the means of orderlies and the\ntelephone, I was enabled to transmit my orders. During the afternoon I\nvisited the position of Grimes’ Battery on the heights of El Pozo, and\nsaw Sumner and Kent in firm possession of San Juan Hill, which I\ndirected should be intrenched during the night. My engineer officer,\nLieut.-Col. Derby, collected and sent forward the necessary tools, and\nduring the night trenches of very considerable strength were\nconstructed.",
        "During the afternoon, Maj. Dillenback, by my order, brought forward\nthe two remaining batteries of his battalion and put them in position\nat El Pozo, to the left of Grimes. Later in the afternoon all three\nbatteries were moved forward to positions near the firing-line, but\nthe nature of the country and the intensity of the enemy’s small-arm\nfire was such that no substantial results were gained by our artillery\nin the new positions. The batteries were intrenched during the night.\nGen. Duffield, with the 33d Michigan, attacked Aguadores, as ordered,\nbut was unable to accomplish more than to detain the Spaniards in that\nvicinity.",
        "After the brilliant and important victory gained at El Caney, Lawton\nstarted his tried troops, who had been fighting all day and marching\nmuch of the night before, to connect with the right of the cavalry\ndivision. Night came on before this movement could be accomplished. In\nthe darkness the enemy’s pickets were encountered, and the division\ncommander, being uncertain of the ground and as to what might be in\nhis front, halted his command and reported the situation to me. This\ninformation was received about 12:30 a. m., and I directed Gen. Lawton\nto return by my headquarters and the El Pozo house as the only certain\nway of gaining his new position.",
        "This was done, and the division took position on the right of the\ncavalry early next morning; Chaffee’s Brigade arriving first, about\nhalf-past seven, and the other brigades before noon.",
        "On the night of July 1st, I ordered Gen. Duffield, at Siboney, to send\nforward the 34th Michigan and the 9th Massachusetts. Both of which had\njust arrived from the United States. These regiments reached the front\nthe next morning. The 34th was placed in rear of Kent, and the 9th was\nassigned to Bates, who placed it on his left.",
        "Soon after daylight on July 2d the enemy opened battle, but because of\nthe intrenchments made during the night, the approach of Lawton’s\nDivision, and the presence of Bates’ Brigade, which had taken position\nduring the night on Kent’s left, little apprehension was felt as to\nour ability to repel the Spaniards.",
        "It is proper here to state that Gen. Bates and his brigade had\nperformed most arduous and efficient service, having marched much of\nthe night of June 30th-July 1st, and a good part of the latter day,\nduring which he also participated in the battle of El Caney, after\nwhich he proceeded, by way of El Pozo, to the left of the line at San\nJuan, reaching his new position about midnight.",
        "All day on the 2d the battle raged with more or less fury, but such of\nour troops as were in position at daylight held their ground, and\nLawton gained a strong and commanding position on the right.",
        "About 10 p. m. the enemy made a vigorous assault to break through my\nlines, but he was repulsed at all points.",
        "On the morning of the 3d the battle was renewed, but the enemy seemed\nto have expended his energy in the assault of the previous night, and\nthe firing along the lines was desultory until stopped by my sending\nthe following letter within the Spanish lines:",
        "“Headquarters U. S. Forces, near San Juan River,\n\"July 3, 1898–8:30 a. m.",
        "“Sir,–I shall be obliged, unless you surrender, to shell Santiago de\nCuba. Please inform the citizens of foreign countries, and all the\nwomen and children, that they should leave the city before 10 o’clock\nto-morrow morning.",
        "“Very respectfully, your obedient servant,",
        "“William R. Shafter,\n\"Maj.-Gen. U. S. Vols.\n\"The Commanding General of the Spanish Forces, Santiago de Cuba.”",
        "To this letter I received the following reply:",
        "“Santiago de Cuba, July 3, 1898.",
        "“His Excellency the General Commanding Forces of the United States,\nnear San Juan River:",
        "“Sir,–I have the honor to reply to your communication of to-day,\nwritten at 8:30 a. m. and received at 1 p. m., demanding the surrender\nof this city, or, in the contrary case, announcing to me that you will\nbombard this city, and that I advise the foreigners, women and\nchildren, that they must leave the city before 10 o’clock to-morrow\nmorning.",
        "“It is my duty to say to you that this city will not surrender, and\nthat I will inform the foreign consuls and inhabitants of the contents\nof your message.",
        "“Very respectfully, Jose Toral,\n\"Commander-in-Chief 4th Corps.”",
        "Several of the foreign consuls came into my lines and asked that the\ntime given for them–the women and children–to depart from the city\nbe extended until 10 o’clock on July 5th. This induced me to write a\nsecond letter, as follows:",
        "“Santiago de Cuba, July 3d, 1898.",
        "“Sir,–In consideration of a request of the consular officers in your\ncity for further delay in carrying out my intentions to fire on the\ncity, and in the interests of the poor women and children who will\nsuffer very greatly by their hasty and enforced departure from the\ncity, I have the honor to announce that I will delay such action,\nsolely in their interests, until noon of the 5th, provided that during\nthe interim your forces make no demonstration whatever upon those of\nmy own.",
        "“I am, with great respect, your obedient servant,",
        "“William R Shafter,\n\"Maj.-Gen. U. S. A.\n\"The Commanding General, Spanish Forces.”",
        "My first message went under a flag of truce at 12:42 p.m. I was of the\nopinion that the Spaniards would surrender if given a little time, and\nI thought this result would be hastened if the men of their army could\nbe made to understand they would be well treated as prisoners of war.\nActing upon this presumption, I determined to offer to return all the\nwounded Spanish officers at El Caney who were able to bear\ntransportation, and who were willing to give their paroles not to\nserve against the forces of the United States until regularly\nexchanged. This offer was made and accepted. These officers, as well\nas several of the wounded Spanish privates, twenty-seven in all, were\nsent to their lines under the escort of some of our mounted cavalry.\nOur troops were received with honors, and I have every reason to\nbelieve the return of the Spanish prisoners produced a good impression\non their comrades.",
        "The cessation of firing about noon on the 3d practically terminated\nthe battle of Santiago; all that occurred after this time may properly\nbe treated under the head of the siege which followed. After deducting\nthe detachments required at Siboney and Baiquiri to render those\ndepots secure from attack, organizations held to protect our flanks,\nothers acting as escorts and guards to light batteries, the members of\nthe Hospital Corps, guards left in charge of blanket-rolls which the\nintense heat caused the men to cast aside before entering battle,\norderlies, etc., it is doubtful if we had more than 12,000 men on the\nfiring-line on July 1, when the battle was fiercest and when the\nimportant and strong positions of El Caney and San Juan were captured.",
        "A few Cubans assisted in the attack at El Caney, and fought valiantly,\nbut their numbers were too small to materially change the strength, as\nindicated above. The enemy confronted us with numbers about equal to\nour own; they fought obstinately in strong and intrenched positions,\nand the results obtained clearly indicate the intrepid gallantry of\nthe company officers and men, and the benefits derived from the\ncareful training and instruction given in the company in the recent\nyears in rifle practice and other battle exercises. Our losses in\nthese battles were 22 officers and 208 men killed, and 81 officers and\n1,203 men wounded; missing, 79. The missing, with few exceptions,\nreported later.",
        "The arrival of Gen. Escario on the night of July 2d, and his entrance\ninto the city was not anticipated, for although it was known, as\npreviously stated, that Gen. Pando had left Manzanillo with\nreinforcements for the garrison of Santiago, it was not believed his\ntroops could arrive so soon. Gen. Garcia, with between 4,000 and 5,000\nCubans, was intrusted with the duty of watching for and intercepting\nthe reinforcement expected. This, however, he failed to do, and\nEscario passed into the city along on my extreme right and near the\nbay. Up to this time I had been unable to complete investment of the\ntown with my own men; but to prevent any more reinforcements coming in\nor the enemy escaping. I extended my lines as rapidly as possible to\nthe extreme right, and completed the investment of the place, leaving\nGen. Garcia’s forces in the rear of my right flank to scout the\ncountry for any approaching Spanish reinforcements, a duty which his\nforces were very competent to perform.",
        "It had been reported that 8,000 Spanish troops had left Holquin for\nSantiago. It was also known that there was a considerable force at San\nLuis, twenty miles to the north.",
        "In the battle of Santiago the Spanish navy endeavored to shell our\ntroops on the extreme right, but the latter were concealed by the\ninequalities of the ground, and the shells did little, if any, harm.\nTheir naval forces also assisted in the trenches, having 1,000 on\nshore, and I am informed they sustained considerable loss; among\nothers, Admiral Cervera’s chief-of-staff was killed. Being convinced\nthat the city would fall, Admiral Cervera determined to put to sea,\ninforming the French consul it was better to die fighting than to sink\nhis ships. The news of the great naval victory which followed was\nenthusiastically received by the Army.",
        "The information of our naval victory was transmitted under flag of\ntruce to the Spanish commander in Santiago on July 4th, and the\nsuggestion again made that he surrender to save needless effusion of\nblood.",
        "On the same date I informed Admiral Sampson that if he would force his\nway into the harbor the city would surrender without any further\nsacrifice of life. Commodore Watson replied that Admiral Sampson was\ntemporarily absent, but that in his (Watson’s) opinion the Navy should\nnot enter the harbor.",
        "In the meanwhile letters passing between Gen. Toral and myself caused\nthe cessation of hostilities to continue. Each army, however,\ncontinued to strengthen its intrenchments. I was still of the opinion\nthe Spaniards would surrender without much more fighting, and on July\n6th called Gen. Toral’s attention to the changed conditions, and at\nhis request gave him time to consult his home government. This he did,\nasking that the British consul, with the employees of the cable\ncompany, be permitted to return from El Caney to the city. This I\ngranted.",
        "The strength of the enemy’s position was such I did not wish to\nassault if it could be avoided.",
        "An examination of the enemy’s works, made after the surrender, fully\njustifies the wisdom of the course adopted. The intrenchments could\nonly have been carried with very great loss of life, probably with not\nless than 6,000 killed and wounded.",
        "On July 8th Gen. Toral offered to march out of the city with arms and\nbaggage, provided he would not be molested before reaching Holquin,\nand to surrender to the American forces the territory then occupied by\nhim. I replied that while I would submit his proposition to my home\ngovernment. I did not think it would be accepted.",
        "In the meanwhile arrangements were made with Admiral Sampson that when\nthe Army again engaged the enemy the Navy would assist by shelling the\ncity from ships stationed off Aguadores, dropping a shell every few\nminutes.",
        "On July 10th the 1st Illinois and the 1st District of Columbia arrived\nand were placed on the line to the right of the Cavalry division. This\nenabled me to push Lawton farther to the right and to practically\ncommand the Cobre road.",
        "On the afternoon of the date last mentioned the truce was broken off\nat 4 p.m., and I determined to open with four batteries of artillery\nand went forward in person to the trenches to give the necessary\norders, but the enemy anticipated us by opening fire with his\nartillery a few minutes after the hour stated. His batteries were\napparently silenced before night, while ours continued playing upon\nhis trenches until dark. During this firing the Navy fired from\nAguadores, most of the shells falling in the city. There was also some\nsmall arms firing. On this afternoon and the next morning, we lost\nCapt. Charles W. Rowell, 2d Infantry, and one man killed, and Lieut.\nLutz, 2d Infantry, and ten men wounded.",
        "On the morning of July 11th the bombardment by the Navy and my field\nguns was renewed, and continued until nearly noon, and on the same day\nI reported to the Adjutant General of the Army that the right of\nLudlow’s brigade of Lawton’s division rested on the bay. Thus our hold\nupon the enemy was complete.",
        "At 2 p. m. on this date, the 11th, the surrender of the city was again\ndemanded. The firing ceased, and was not again renewed. By this date\nthe sickness in the Army was increasing very rapidly, as a result of\nexposure in the trenches to the intense heat of the sun and the heavy\nrains. Moreover, the dews in Cuba are almost equal to rains. The\nweakness of the troops was becoming so apparent I was anxious to bring\nthe siege to an end, but in common with most of the officers of the\nArmy, I did not think an assault would be justifiable, especially as\nthe enemy seemed to be acting in good faith in their preliminary\npropositions to surrender.",
        "On July 11th I wrote to General Toral as follows:",
        "“With the largely increased forces which have come to me and the fact\nthat I have your line of retreat securely in my hands, the time seems\nfitting that I should again demand of your excellency the surrender of\nSantiago and of your excellency’s army. I am authorized to state that\nshould your excellency so desire, the Government of the United States\nwill transport the entire command of your excellency to Spain.”",
        "General Toral replied that he had communicated my proposition to his\nGeneral-in-Chief, General Blanco.",
        "July 12th I informed the Spanish commander that Major General Miles,\nCommander-in-Chief of the American Army, had just arrived in my camp,\nand requested him to grant us a personal interview on the following\nday. He replied he would be pleased to meet us. The interview took\nplace on the 13th, and I informed him his surrender only could be\nconsidered, and that as he was without hope of escape he had no right\nto continue the fight.",
        "On the 14th another interview took place, during which General Toral\nagreed to surrender, upon the basis of his army, the 4th Army Corps,\nbeing returned to Spain, the capitulation embracing all of Eastern\nCuba, east of a line passing from Aserraderos, on the south, to Sagua\nde Tanamo, on the north, via Palma, Soriano. It was agreed\nCommissioners should meet during the afternoon to definitely arrange\nthe terms of surrender, and I appointed Major Generals Wheeler and\nLawton and Lieutenant Miley to represent the United States.",
        "The Spanish Commissioners raised many points, and were especially\ndesirous of retaining their arms. The discussion lasted until late at\nnight and was renewed at 9:30 o’clock next morning. The terms of\nsurrender finally agreed upon included about 12,000 Spanish troops in\nthe city and as many more in the surrendered district.",
        "It was arranged that the formal surrender should take place between\nthe lines on the morning of July 17th, each army being represented by\n100 armed men. At the time appointed, I appeared at the place agreed\nupon, with my general officers, staff, and 100 troopers of the 2d\nCavalry, under Captain Brett. General Toral also arrived with a number\nof his officers and 100 infantry. We met midway between the\nrepresentatives of our two Armies, and the Spanish commander formally\nconsummated the surrender of the city and the 24,000 troops in\nSantiago and the surrendered district.",
        "After this ceremony I entered the city with my staff and escort, and\nat 12 o’clock, noon, the American flag was raised over the Governor’s\npalace with appropriate ceremonies.",
        "The 9th Infantry immediately took possession of the city and perfect\norder was maintained. The surrender included a small gunboat and about\n200 seamen, together with five merchant ships in the harbor. One of\nthese vessels, the Mexico, had been used as a war vessel, and had\nfour guns mounted on it.",
        "In taking charge of the civil government, all officials who were\nwilling to serve were retained in office, and the established order of\ngovernment was preserved as far as consistent with the necessities of\nmilitary rule.",
        "I soon found the number of officials was excessive, and I greatly\nreduced the list, and some departments were entirely abolished.",
        "A collector of customs, Mr. Donaldson, arrived soon after the\nsurrender, and, due to his energy and efficiency, this department was\nsoon working satisfactorily. The total receipts had, up to my\ndeparture, been $102,000.",
        "On August 4th I received orders to begin the embarkation of my command\nand ship them to Montauk Point Long Island, New York. The movement\ncontinued without interruption until August 25th, when I sailed for\nMontauk with the last troops in my command, turning over the command\nof the district to Major General Lawton.",
        "Before closing my report I wish to dwell upon the natural obstacles I\nhad to encounter and which no foresight could have overcome or\nobviated. The rocky and precipitous coast afforded no sheltered\nlanding places, the roads were mere bridle-paths, the effect of the\ntropical sun and rains upon the unacclimated troops was deadly, and a\ndread of strange and unknown diseases had its effect on the Army.",
        "At Baiquiri the landing of the troops and stores was made a small\nwooden wharf, which the Spaniards tried to burn, but unsuccessfully,\nand the animals were pushed into the water and guided to a sandy beach\nabout 200 yards in extent. At Siboney the landing was made on the\nbeach and at a small wharf erected by the engineers.",
        "I had neither the time nor the men to spare to construct permanent\nwharves.",
        "In spite of the fact that I had nearly 1,000 men continuously at work\non the roads, they were at times impassable for wagons.",
        "The San Juan and Aguadores rivers would often suddenly rise so as to\nprevent the passage of wagons, and then the eight pack trains with the\ncommand had to be depended upon for the victualing of my Army, as well\nas the 20,000 refugees, who could not in the interests of humanity be\nleft to starve while we had rations.",
        "Often for days nothing could be moved except on pack trains.",
        "After the great physical strain and exposure of July 1st and 2d, the\nmalarial and other fevers began to rapidly advance throughout the\ncommand, and on July 4th the yellow fever appeared at Siboney. Though\nefforts were made to keep this fact from the Army, it soon became\nknown.",
        "The supply of Quartermaster and Commissary stores during the campaign\nwas abundant, and notwithstanding the difficulties in landing and\ntransporting the ration, the troops on the firing line were at all\ntimes supplied with its coarser components, namely, of bread, meat,\nsugar, and coffee.",
        "There was no lack of transportation, for at no time up to the\nsurrender could all the wagons I had be used.",
        "In reference to the sick and wounded, I have to say that they received\nevery attention that was possible to give them. The medical officers,\nwithout exception, worked night and day to alleviate the suffering,\nwhich was no greater than invariably accompanies a campaign. It would\nhave been better if we had had more ambulances, but as many were taken\nas was thought necessary, judging from previous campaigns.",
        "The discipline of the command was superb, and I wish to invite\nattention to the fact that not an officer was brought to trial by\ncourt martial, and, as far as I know, no enlisted men. This speaks\nvolumes for an Army of this size and in a campaign of such duration.",
        "In conclusion, I desire to express to the members of my staff my\nthanks for their efficient performance of all the duties required of\nthem, and the good judgment and bravery displayed on all occasions\nwhen demanded.",
        "I submit the following recommendations for promotion, which I\nearnestly desire to see made. It is a very little reward to give them\nfor their devotion and fearless exposure of their lives in their\ncountry’s cause:",

        "Adjutant General of the Army, Washington, D. C.",
        "Bivouac, near Santiago, Cuba,\nJuly 23, 1898.\nThe Adjutant-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.",
        "Sir,–In compliance with orders I have the honor to submit the\nfollowing report of my command, the Gatling Gun Detachment, 5th Army\nCorps, covering its operations down to the present date:",
        "1. Organization.–Pursuant to instructions from Gen. Shafter I was\ngiven a detail of two sergeants and ten men on the 26th of May, 1898,\nfrom the 13th Infantry, then in camp near Tampa, Fla., and directed to\nreport to 1st Lieut. John T. Thompson, O. D., ordinance officer,\nTampa, “for duty with Gatling guns.” I was placed in charge of four\nguns, model 1895, cal. 30, and at once began the instruction of the\ndetachment. On June 1st I received verbal instruction to assist Lieut.\nThompson in his work at the ordinance depot, and performed this duty\nin addition to my duties with the guns until June 6, 1898,\nsuperintending issues to the expedition (5th Corps) then fitting out\nfor Cuba.",
        "On June 6th I took my men and guns aboard the transport Cherokee, and\non June 11th, per special orders No. 16 of that date, my detail was\nincreased to thirty-seven men, all told, of whom one was left sick in\nhospital at Tampa. About twelve of these did not join me, however,\nuntil after debarkation at Baiquiri, Cuba. On June 25th I received\nverbal instructions from Gen. Shafter to disembark at once, select the\nnecessary number of mules (two per gun), and get to the front as soon\nas possible, reporting on my arrival there to Gen. Wheeler, then in\ncommand of all the troops at the front. I was unable to obtain any\ntentage for myself, and had only shelter-tents for my men.",
        "I was joined on June 25th by Capt. Henry Marcotte, 17th Infantry,\nretired, regularly authorized correspondent of the Army and Navy\nJournal, who has been with me ever since, enduring all the\nvicissitudes of the season with Spartan fortitude, although equally\ndestitute of cover as myself and 60 years of age. I desire to express\nhere officially and fully, my sincere gratitude for the kindness which\npermitted him to accompany my command, and the great appreciation of\nthe valuable advice and assistance which he has given continually. His\nlarge experience of war, his clear head and good judgment have always\nbeen at hand to aid, and his cool example to myself and my men under\nfire did much to steady us and keep us up to our work when we were\nfirst called on to face that ordeal.",
        "All of the detachments, who had not previously joined me, did so on\nJune 26th, on which day I reached the extreme front and reported to\nGen. Wheeler. The guns were posted in a position to sweep the\nneighboring hills toward the enemy, and I went into camp, remaining\nthere until the morning of July 1st.",
        "Summing up the organization, it should be stated here that the\ndetachment was organized at the first, and has ever since remained an\nindependent command, receiving its orders directly from the corps\ncommander. It has had its own records, returns, rolls, etc., and has\nbeen rationed separately all the time, and is composed of men selected\nby myself from various regiments.",
        "2. The Battery in Action.–On the morning of July 1st, I broke camp at\n4:30 a.m., and pursuant to instructions from Gen. Shafter, proceeded\nto El Poso, placing my battery, as I shall henceforth call it, in\nsupport behind the position taken by a battery of artillery. I took\nthis position about 6 a.m., and soon after the artillery arrived, went\non to battery and opened fire at Santiago, the range being 2,600\nyards. After some time the enemy replied with a well-directed fire,\nthe second shell bursting directly over my battery in rear of\nartillery. Neither my men nor mules showed any signs of disturbance,\nand we remained in our perilous position nearly twenty minutes, the\nenemy’s shells bursting all around us, until ordered to the rear by\nthe chief-of-staff. The battery went to the rear under fire quietly\nuntil out of range, and remained there until the artillery fire\nceased, at about 9 a.m. Private Hoft, Company D, 13th Infantry, a\nmember of the detachment who had been detailed to guard the camp\nequipage at El Poso, remained at his post during the whole of the\nartillery fight, and deserves great credit therefor, his battery\nhaving been ordered to the rear. At 9 a.m. I returned to El Poso, and\nthere received the following instructions from Col. McClernand, A. A.\nG., 5th Corps: “Find the 71st N. Y. V. and go on with them, if you\ncan. If this is not practical, find the best position you can, and use\nyour guns to the best advantage.” Pursuant to these instructions, I\nwent forward about a half-mile and found the 71st N. Y. V. halting to\nlearn what their instructions were. I could get no clear idea of what\nthey were going to do, but waited about fifteen minutes in their rear\nto find out. Meantime troops continually passed us toward the front.\nThen, about 10:15, firing began in front. I rode forward alone along\nthe rode, which was a narrow defile through the jungle, and found that\nabout a half-mile in front was a creek, upon the crossing of which the\nenemy’s fire seemed concentrated. In front of this crossing seemed to\nbe a level plain of about 400 to 800 yards, beyond which was a\nsemi-circular ridge crowned with Spanish trenches from which the\nSpanish fire seemed to come. Men were being hit continually at this\nplace (the ford), but it seemed to me to be a good place to work my\nbattery effectively.",
        "I rode back, finding the Seventy-first still lying beside the road\nwithout any apparent intention of moving. I determined to leave them\nand go into action. Taking a gallop I moved the battery forward nearly\nto the ford (about 150 yards), where I met Col. Derby of Gen.\nShafter’s staff, who informed me that the troops were not yet\nsufficiently deployed to take advantage of my fire, and advised me to\nwait. The bullets were cutting through all around, and, as we learned\nafterward, the enemy’s sharpshooters were actually in the woods near\nus, up in tall trees, picking off officers and men. It should be\nstated here that the sudden increase of the enemy’s fire at this time\nwas caused by a wild cheering set up by the 71st N. Y. V., as the\nbattery passed them on its way to the front. The cheering located our\nposition for the enemy and drew his fire. Many a brave soldier who had\ngone to the front was put forever beyond the possibility of cheering\nby this outburst of ignorant enthusiasm.",
        "I acted on Col. Derby’s advice, and he promised to send me word when\nthe moment for proper action came. This was necessary, as I knew only\npart of the plan of battle and might have jeopardized other parts of\nprematurely exposing our strength at this point. The gun crews lay\ndown under their guns and steadily remained at this posts. The fire\nfinally grew so hot that I moved about 100 yards back. This was about\n12, noon. At 1 p. m., or about that time, I received a message sent by\nCol. Derby, I think, as follows: “Gen. Shafter directs that you give\none of your guns to Lieut. Miley, take the others forward beyond the\nford where the dynamite gun is, and go into action at the best point\nyou can find.” I obeyed the order, giving Lieut. Miley Sergeant\nWeigle’s gun and crew and moving the rest forward at a gallop to the\npoint beyond the ford, which I had already selected as a good place.\nThe battery opened with three guns simultaneously at ranges of 600 to\n800 yards at 1:15 p. m. The enemy at first concentrated his fire upon\nus, but soon weakened and in five minutes was clambering from his\ntrenches and running to the rear. We fired as rapidly as possible upon\nthe groups thus presented until I saw a white handkerchief waved by\nsome one of my own regiment, the 13th Infantry, and at the same moment\nCapt. Landis, 1st Cavalry, who had voluntarily assisted me throughout,\nsaid: “Better stop; our own men are climbing up the ridge.” I ordered\nthe fire to cease at 1:23 1/2 p.m., and a moment later saw our own\ntroops occupy the crest of the hill. The firing had been, continued by\nthe battery until our own troops were within 150 yards of the enemy’s\ntrench, a fact made possible by the steep slope of the hill upon which\nthe enemy had been.",
        "At the time when my battery went into action I had no support, and the\nposition I took was at least 100 yards in front of any of our troops\nalong this part of the line. About the time I ceased firing\nLieut.-Col. Baldwin, 10th Cavalry, put two troops in support of my\nbattery.",
        "I have advanced in a letter to the Adjutant General from Fort\nLeavenworth, dated January 1st, 1898, the theory that such guns as\nthese can be used offensively. The conditions of this assault were\nfavorable, the morale of my men superb, and the use made of the guns\nfollowed the theory therein set forth with the exactness of a\nmathematical demonstration. The infantry and cavalry had been pounding\naway for two hours on these positions; in eight and one-half minutes\nafter the Gatlings opened the works were ours. Inspired by the\nfriendly rattle of the machine guns, our own troops rose to the\ncharge; while the enemy amazed by our sudden and tremendous increase\nof fire, first diverted his fire to my battery, and then, unable to\nwithstand the hail of bullets, augmented by the moral effect of our\nbattery fire and the charging line, broke madly from his safe trenches\nand was mercilessly cut by fire from these guns during his flight.",
        "I at once limbered up and took stock of my losses. One man was killed,\none badly wounded, one mule hit twice, but not much injured, and\nseveral men were missing.",
        "Suddenly the fire was resumed at the front. I moved my three pieces\nforward again at a gallop, and went into action on the skirmish line\non top of the captured position, with two pieces to the right and one\nto the left of the main road from El Poso to Santiago. I was compelled\nto make the skirmishers give way to the right and left in order to get\nroom for my guns on the firing-line, and to impress stragglers to\ncarry ammunition. Capt. Ayres, 10th Cavalry, gave me a detail of one\nsergeant and two privates, all of whom did fine service. It seemed to\nme that the enemy was trying to retake the position. About 4 to 4:14\np. m. I saw a body, apparently about 400, of the enemy to the right\nfront of my position, apparently in front of the position occupied by\nLieut.-Col. Roosevelt with the 1st Volunteer Cavalry. I turned a\nGatling gun on them, using 600-yard range, and they disappeared. Soon\nafter the firing sensibly slackened.",
        "In the rapid fire on this last body of the enemy I had overheated one\npiece, and it went temporarily out of action. I went over to Col.\nRoosevelt’s position, about a quarter of a mile to the right of a\nsalient, and reconnoitered. While there Sergeant Weigle reported to me\nwith his piece, informing me that Lieut. Miley had not put it into\naction, and asked for instructions. This was about the hour of 5 p.\nm., and the fire became warmer at that moment. I directed Sergeant\nWeigle to run his piece up on the firing-line and to report to the\nofficer in charge thereof. He did so and went into action at once.\nCol. Roosevelt, who was and remained present, informs me that the gun\nwas very effectively used. I rejoined my other two guns and put both\nof them on the line at the left of the El Poso road. At sundown the\nenemy made a sharp attack, and all three of my guns were effectively\nused. During the fight a battery in the city opened on my two guns,\nfiring 16 cm. shells. I at once turned my guns on it and kept up so\nwarm a fire that the cannoneers left their battery and did not return.\nIn all they had fired three shells at us, all of which broke just over\nor beyond the battery. I secured the fuse of one, still warm, and\nafter the surrender visited the battery which had fired at us and\nexamined the gun. It is a 16 cm. (6.2992 inches) bronze rifle gun in\nbarbette on a pintle. This is probably the first time in land fighting\nthat such a piece was ever silenced by machine-gun fire. The range I\nused was 2,000 yards (estimated).",
        "The guns were used during the remainder of the fighting in the\ntrenches. I took off the wheels and put the guns on the carriages in\nemplacements, erecting a sandbag parapet in front as cover during the\nnight of July 4th. The disabled gun was brought up and repaired,\nsubsequently participating in the fighting. The dynamite gun, under\nSergeant Borrowe, 1st Volunteer Cavalry, cooperated with the battery\nthus formed, and the whole battery, including the two Colt automatic\nrapid-fire guns under Lieut. Tiffany, 1st United States Volunteer\nCavalry, did good work in all the subsequent fighting. I supplied\nabout eight thousand rounds of captured Mauser cartridges to Tiffany,\nwhich had been captured by my battery, and which he used effectively\nin his Colt’s guns. I had a strong fire directed upon a battery of\nseven pieces of the enemy’s artillery at a distance of 1,500 yards in\nfront every time any attempt was made to use this battery. The result\nwas that only three shots were fired from these guns after July 4th. I\nvisited this battery after the surrender and found every gun in\nworking order, the 16 cm. gun being actually loaded. As no\norganization, except my battery, of which I had general direction, had\nsuch orders, so far as I can learn, the conclusion is that this\nbattery of machine guns kept out of action seven pieces of the enemy’s\nartillery by making it too warm for his gunners to stay in their\nbatteries.",
        "I have made certain recommendations in hasty reports for gallantry,\nwhich I personally witnessed. They were as follows:",
        "Capt. J. R. F. Landis, 1st Cavalry, medal of honor. Volunteered to\nassist observation of fire July 1st, and rendered great service at\nimminent peril of his life made necessary in order to render such\nservice.",
        "Sergeant John N. Weigle, 9th Infantry, 2d Lieutenant U. S. Army\n(regulars). For conspicuous daring, intelligence, and coolness in\naction, July 1st.",
        "Corporal Charles C. Steigenwald, 13th Infantry, 2d Lieutenant U. S.\nArmy (regulars). For coolness and judgment in keeping his gun in\naction with only one man to help on July 1st.",
        "Private Fred C. Elkins, 17th Infantry, 2d Lieutenant United States\nVolunteers. For conspicuous daring and courage in action. Although\nwounded, he remained at his post until he fell from exhaustion, July\n1st.",
        "Corporal Matthew Doyle, 13th Infantry, medal of honor. Conspicuous\ngallantry and coolness in action. When, two men had been shot down by\nhis side he continued to work his gun effectively alone until\nassistance arrived, July 1st.",
        "Sergt. Green, Company H, 13th Infantry, medal of honor. Conspicuous\ncoolness and steadiness in handling his piece under hot fire, July\n1st.",
        "Sergt. John Graham, 10th Cavalry, medal of honor. Conspicuous coolness\nand steadiness under fire, July 1st.",
        "Sergt. Weischaar, Company A, 13th Infantry, certificate of merit.\nParticularly meritorious steadiness, night of July 6th. Being put on\noutpost duty with a Gatling gun in time of truce, and having been\nalarmed by a sentinel, whose duty it was to warn him of the enemy’s\napproach, he coolly reserved his fire for personal investigation and\nprevented a violation of the truce.",
        "Sergt. Ryder, Company G, 13th Infantry, certificate of merit.\nParticularly meritorious steadiness, night of July 6th. Being on\noutpost duty with a Gatling gun in time of truce, and having been\nalarmed by a sentinel, whose duty it was to warn him of the enemy’s\napproach, he coolly held his fire for personal investigation and\nprevented a violation of the truce.",
        "In making these recommendations, I have limited myself to those which\nI personally observed. If I recommended for every deserving act, there\nis not a man in my whole detachment who has not deserved a certificate\nof merit. They were selected in the beginning from an army corps for\nwhat I knew of them, and they have abundantly justified my confidence\nin them. With a less efficient personnel it would have been absolutely\nimpossible to organize, equip and instruct the first battery of\nGatling guns ever used in the history of war, in the short space of\ntime allotted me, and put it in efficient fighting shape. They fought\ntheir guns on the skirmish line and in advance of it, standing boldly\nup to do it when the skirmishers themselves lay down close for cover.\nMy loss, as footed up on the night of July 1st, was 33 1-3 per cent,\nkilled, wounded, and missing. The efficiency of the work of my guns\nwas attested to me by numerous Spanish officers and prisoners. Their\nfavorite expression was: “It was terrible when your guns opened,\nalways. They went b-r-r-r-r, like a lawn mower cutting the grass over\nour trenches. We could not stick a finger up when you fired without\ngetting it cut off–so!”",
        "The work of this experimental battery proves that in this weapon we\nhave a new arm supplementary to infantry and cavalry, independent of\nboth as one arm is of another, and more nearly capable of independent\naction than any other arm of the service. It is equally demonstrated\nthat this new arm is entirely different from artillery in its\nfunctions, and can live where the latter is compelled to retire.",
        "It should, therefore, be organized as a separate arm. I have, at the\nrequest of General Wheeler, drawn up a scheme of such an organization\nand submitted it to him.",
        "Experience shows me that the carriage is too heavy. I can only renew\nthe representations contained in my letter of January 1, 1898, to the\nAdjutant General, accompanying drawing, etc., of my proposed carriage\nfor machine guns. I would now, based on experience, modify my theory\nof organization as then proposed, and would make several changes in\nthe model of carriage then proposed without departing from the general\nprinciples.",
        "If any expression of such views is desired, I shall be very glad to\nsubmit them when called upon by the War Department to do so.",
        "Very respectfully,",
