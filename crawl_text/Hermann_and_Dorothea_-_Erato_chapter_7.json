        "Like as the traveller, who, when the sun is approaching its setting,\nFixes his eyes on it once again ere quickly it vanish,\nThen on the sides of the rocks, and on all the darkening bushes,\nSees its hovering image; whatever direction he look in\nThat hastes before, and flickers and gleams in radiant colors,—\nSo before Hermann’s eyes moved the beautiful shape of the maiden\nSoftly, and seeming to follow the path that led into the cornfield.\nBut he aroused from his wildering dream and turned himself slowly\nTowards where the village lay and was wildered again; for again came\nMoving to meet him the lofty form of the glorious maiden.\nFixedly gazed he upon her; herself it was and no phantom.\nBearing in either hand a larger jar and a smaller,\nEach by the handle, with busy step she came on to the fountain.\nJoyfully then he hastened to meet her; the sight of her gave him\nCourage and strength; and thus the astonished girl he accosted:\n“Do I then find thee, brave-hearted maiden, so soon again busy,\nRendering aid unto others, and happy in bringing them comfort?\nSay why thou comest alone to this well which lies at such a distance,\nWhen all the rest are content with the water they find in the village?\nThis has peculiar virtues, ’tis true; and the taste is delicious.\nThou to that mother wouldst bring it, I trow, whom thy faithfulness rescued.”",
        "Straightway with cordial greeting the kindly maiden made answer:\n“Here has my walk to the spring already been amply rewarded,\nSince I have found the good friend who bestowed so abundantly on us;\nFor a pleasure not less than the gifts is the sight of the giver.\nCome, I pray thee, and see for thyself who has tasted thy bounty;\nCome, and the quiet thanks receive of all it has solaced.\nBut that thou straightway the reason mayst know for which I am hither\nCome to draw, where pure and unfailing the water is flowing,\nThis I must tell thee,—that all the water we have in the village\nHas by improvident people been troubled with horses and oxen\nWading direct through the source which brings the inhabitants water.\nAnd furthermore they have also made foul with their washings and rinsings\nAll the troughs of the village, and all the fountains have sullied;\nFor but one thought is in all, and that how to satisfy quickest\nSelf and the need of the moment, regardless of what may come after.”",
        "Thus she spoke, and the broad stone steps meanwhile had descended\nWith her companion beside her, and on the low wall of the fountain\nBoth sat them down. She bent herself over to draw, and he also\nTook in his hand the jar that remained, and bent himself over,\nAnd in the blue of the heavens, they, seeing their image reflected,\nFriendly greetings and nods exchanged in the quivering mirror.",
        "“Give me to drink,” the youth thereupon in his gladness petitioned,\nAnd she handed the pitcher. Familiarly sat they and rested,\nBoth leaning over their jars, till she presently asked her companion:\n“Tell me, why I find thee here, and without thy horses and wagon,\nFar from the place where I met thee at first? how camest thou hither?”",
        "Thoughtful he bent his eyes on the ground, then quietly raised them\nUp to her face, and, meeting with frankness the gaze of the maiden,\nFelt himself solaced and stilled. But then impossible was it,\nThat he of love should speak; her eye told not of affection,\nOnly of clear understanding, requiring intelligent answer.\nAnd he composed himself quickly, and cordially said to the maiden:\nHearken to me, my child, and let me reply to thy question.\n’Twas for thy sake that hither I came; why seek to conceal it?\nKnow I live happy at home with both my affectionate parents,\nFaithfully giving my aid their house and estates in directing,\nBeing an only son, and because our affairs are extensive.\nMine is the charge of the farm; my father bears rule in the household;\nWhile the presiding spirit of all is the diligent mother.\nBut thine experience doubtless has taught thee how grievously servants,\nNow through deceit, and now through their carelessness, harass the mistress,\nForcing her ever to change and replace one fault with another.\nLong for that reason my mother has wished for a maid in the household,\nWho not with hand alone, but with heart, too, will lend her assistance,\nTaking the daughter’s place, whom, alas! she was early deprived of.\nHow when to-day by the wagon I saw thee, so ready and cheerful,\nWitnessed the strength of thine arms, and thy limbs of such healthful proportion,\nWhen thy intelligent speech I heard, I was smitten with wonder.\nHastening homeward, I there to my parents and neighbors the stranger\nPraised as she well deserved. But I now am come hither to tell thee\nWhat is their wish as mine.—Forgive me my stammering language.”",
        "“Hesitate not,” she, answering, said, “to tell me what follows.\nThou dost not give me offence; I have listened with gratitude to thee:\nSpeak it out honestly therefore; the sound of it will not alarm me.\nThou wouldst engage me as servant to wait on thy father and mother,\nAnd to look after the welt-ordered house of which ye are the owners;\nAnd thou thinkest in me to find them a capable servant,\nOne who is skilled in her work, and not of a rude disposition.\nShort thy proposal has been, and short shall be also my answer.\nYes, I will go with thee home, and the call of fate I will follow.\nHere my duty is done: I have brought the newly made mother\nBack to her kindred again, who are all in her safety rejoicing.\nMost of our people already are gathered; the others will follow.\nAll think a few days more will certainly see them returning\nUnto their homes; for such is the exile’s constant delusion.\nBut by no easy hope do I suffer myself to be cheated\nDuring these sorrowful days which promise yet more days of sorrow.\nAll the bands of the world have been loosed, and what shall unite them,\nSaving alone the need, the need supreme, that is on us?\nIf in a good man’s house I can earn my living by service,\nUnder the eye of an excellent mistress, I gladly will do it;\nSince of doubtful repute, must be always a wandering maiden.\nYes, I will go with thee, soon as I first shall have carried the pitchers\nBack to my friends, and prayed the good people to give me their blessing.\nCome thou must see them thyself, and from their hands must receive me.”",
        "Joyfully hearkened the youth to the willing maiden’s decision,\nDoubtful whether he ought not at once to make honest confession.\nYet it appeared to him best to leave her awhile in her error,\nNor for her love to sue, before leading her home to his dwelling.\nAh! and the golden ring he perceived on the hand of the maiden,\nWherefore he let her speak on, and gave diligent ear to her language.",
        "“Come,” she presently said, “Let us back to the village; for maidens\nAlways are sure to be blamed if they tarry too long at the fountain.\nYet how delightful it is to chat by the murmuring water!”",
        "Then from their seats they rose, and both of them turned to the fountain\nOne more look behind, and a tender longing possessed them.\nBoth of the water-jars then in silence she took by the handle,\nCarried them up the steps, while behind her followed her lover.\nOne of the pitchers he begged her to give him to lighten the burden.\n“Nay, let it be!” she said: “I carry them better so balanced.\nNor shall the master, who is to command, be doing me service.\nLook not so gravely upon me, as thinking my fortune a hard one.\nEarly a woman should learn to serve, for that is her calling;\nSince through service alone she finally comes to the headship,\nComes to the due command that is hers of right in the household.\nEarly the sister must wait on her brother, and wait on her parents;\nLife must be always with her a perpetual coming and going,\nOr be a fetching and carrying, making and doing for others.\nHappy for her be she wonted to think no way is too grievous,\nAnd if the hours of the night be to her as the hours of the daytime;\nIf she find never a needle too fine, nor a labor too trifling;\nWholly forgetful of self, and caring to live but in others!\nFor she will surely, as mother, have need of every virtue,\nWhen, in the time of her illness, the cries of her infant arouse her\nCalling for food from her weakness, and cares are to suffering added.\nTwenty men bound into one were not able to bear such a burden;\nNor is it meant that they should, yet should they with gratitude view it.”",
        "Thus she spoke, and was come, meanwhile, with her silent companion,\nFar as the floor of the barn, at the furthermost end of the garden,\nWhere was the sick woman lying, whom, glad, she had left with her daughters,\nThose late rescued maidens: fair pictures of innocence were they.\nBoth of them entered the barn; and, e’en as they did so, the justice,\nLeading a child in each hand, came in from the other direction.\nThese had been lost, hitherto, from the sight of their sorrowing mother;\nBut in the midst of the crowd the old man now had descried them.\nJoyfully sprang they forward to meet their dear mother’s embraces,\nAnd to salute with delight their brother, their unknown companion.\nNext upon Dorothea they sprang with affectionate greeting,\nAsking for bread and fruit, but more than all else for some water.\nSo then she handed the water about; and not only the children\nDrank, but the sick woman too, and her daughters, and with them the justice.\nAll were refreshed, and highly commended the glorious water;\nAcid it was to the taste, and reviving, and wholesome to drink of.",
        "Then with a serious face the maiden replied to them, saying:\n“Friends, for the last time now to your mouth have I lifted my pitcher;\nAnd for the last time by me have your lips been moistened with water.\nBut henceforth in the heat of the clay when the draught shall refresh you,\nWhen in the shade ye enjoy your rest beside a clear fountain,\nThink of me then sometimes and of all my affectionate service,\nPrompted more by my love than the duty I owed you as kindred.\nI shall acknowledge as long as I live the kindness ye’ve shown me.\n’Tis with regret that I leave you; but every one now is a burden,\nMore than a help to his neighbor, and all must be finally scattered\nFar through a foreign land, if return to our homes be denied us.\nSee, here stands the youth to whom we owe thanks for the presents.\nHe gave the cloak for the baby, and all these welcome provisions.\nNow he is come, and has asked me if I will make one in his dwelling,\nThat I may serve therein his wealthy and excellent parents.\nAnd I refuse not the offer; for maidens must always be serving;\nBurdensome were it for them to rest and be served in the household.\nTherefore I follow him gladly. A youth of intelligence seems he,\nAnd so will also the parents be, as becometh the wealthy.\nSo then farewell, dear friend; and mayst thou rejoice in thy nursling,\nLiving, and into thy face already so healthfully looking!\nWhen thou shalt press him against thy breast in these gay-colored wrappings,\nOh, then remember the kindly youth who bestowed them upon us,\nAnd who me also henceforth, thy sister, will shelter and nourish.\nThou, too, excellent man!” she said as she turned to the justice;\n“Take my thanks that in many a need I have found thee a father.\"\nThen she knelt down on the floor by the side of the newly made mother,\nKissing the weeping woman, and taking her low-whispered blessing.\nThou, meanwhile, worshipful justice, wast speaking to Hermann and saying:\n“Justly mayst thou, my friend, be counted among the good masters,\nCareful to manage their household affairs with capable servants.\nFor I have often observed how in sheep, as in horses and oxen,\nMen conclude never a bargain without making closest inspection,\nWhile with a servant who all things preserves, if honest and able,\nAnd who will every thing lose and destroy, if he set to work falsely,\nHim will a chance or an accident make us admit to our dwelling,\nAnd we are left, when too late, to repent an o’er hasty decision.\nThou understandest the matter it seems; because thou hast chosen,\nThee and thy parents to serve in the house, a maid who is honest.\nHold her with care; for as long as thy household is under her keeping,\nThou shalt not want for a sister, nor yet for a daughter thy parents.”",
        "Many were come, meanwhile, near relatives all of the mother,\nBringing her various gifts, and more suitable quarters announcing.\nAll of them, hearing the maiden’s decision, gave Hermann their blessing,\nCoupled with glances of meaning, while each made his special reflections.\nHastily one and another would say in the ear of his neighbor:\n“If in the master a lover she find, right well were she cared for.\"\nHermann took her at last by the hand, and said as he did so:\n“Let us be going; the day is declining, and distant the city.\"\nEager and voluble then the women embraced Dorothea;\nHermann drew her away; but other adieus must be spoken:\nLastly the children with cries fell upon her and terrible weeping,\nClung to her garments, and would not their dear second mother should leave them.\nBut in a tone of command the women said, one and another:\n“Hush now, children, she’s going to the town, and will presently bring you\nPlenty of nice sweet cake that was by your brother bespoken\nWhen by the stork just now he was brought past the shop of the baker.\nSoon you will see her come back with sugar-plums splendidly gilded.\"\nThen did the little ones loose their hold, and Hermann, though hardly,\nTore her from further embraces away, and far-waving kerchiefs.",
