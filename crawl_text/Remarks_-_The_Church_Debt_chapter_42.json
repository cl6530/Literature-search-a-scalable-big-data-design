        "I have been thinking the matter over seriously and I have decided that if\nI had my life to live over again, I would like to be an eccentric\nmillionaire.",
        "I have eccentricity enough, but I cannot successfully push it without more\nmeans.",
        "I have a great many plans which I would like to carry out, in case I could\nunite the two necessary elements for the production of the successful\neccentric millionaire.",
        "Among other things, I would be willing to bind myself and give proper\nsecurity to any one who would put in money to offset my eccentricity, that\nI would ultimately die. We all know how seldom the eccentric millionaire\nnow dies. I would be willing to inaugurate a reform in that direction.",
        "I think now that I would endow a home for men whose wives are no longer\nable to support them. In many cases the wife who was at first able to\nsupport her husband comfortably, finally shoulders a church debt, and in\ntrying to lift that she overworks and impairs her health so that she\nbecomes an invalid, while hor husband is left to pine away in solitude or\ndependent on the cold charities of the world.",
        "My heart goes out toward those men even now, and in case I should fill the\ngrave of the eccentric millionaire, I am sure that I would do the square\nthing by them.",
        "The method by which our wives in America are knocking the church debt\nsilly, by working up their husbands’ groceries into “angel food” and\nselling them below actual cost, is deserving of the attention of our\nnational financiers.",
        "The church debt itself is deserving of notice in this country. It\ncertainly thrives better under a republican form of government than any\nother feature of our boasted civilization. Western towns spring up\neverywhere, and the first anxiety is to name the place, the second to\nincur a church debt and establish a roller rink.",
        "After that a general activity in trade is assured. Of course the general\nhostility of church and rink will prevent ennui and listlessness, and\nthe church debt will encourage a business boom. Naturally the church debt\ncannot be paid without what is generally known through the West as the\n“festival and hooraw.” This festival is an open market where the ladies\ntrade the groceries of their husbands to other ladies’ husbands, and\neverybody has a “perfectly lovely time.” The church clears $2.30, and\nthirteen ladies are sick all the next day.",
        "This makes a boom for the physicians and later on for the undertaker and\ngeneral tombist. So it will be seen that the Western town is right in\nestablishing a church debt as soon as the survey is made and the town\nproperly named. After the first church debt has been properly started,\nothers will rapidly follow, so that no anxiety need be felt if the church\nwill come forward the first year and buy more than it can pay for.",
        "The church debt is a comparatively modern appliance, and yet it has been\nproductive of many peculiar features. For instance, we call to mind the\nclergyman who makes a specialty of going from place to place as a\nsuccessful debt demolisher. He is a part of the general system, just as\nmuch as the ice cream freezer or the buttonhole bouquet.",
        "Then there is a row or social knock-down-and-drag-out which goes along\nwith the church debt. All these things add to the general interest, and to\nacquire interest in one way or another is the mission of the c.d.",
        "I once knew a most exemplary woman who became greatly interested in the\nwiping out of a church debt, and who did finally succeed in wiping out the\ndebt, but in its last expiring death struggle it gave her a wipe from\nwhich she never recovered. She had succeeded in begging the milk and the\ncream, and the eggs and the sandwiches, and the use of the dishes and the\nsugar, and the loan of an oyster, and the use of a freezer and fifty\nbutton-hole bouquets to be sold to men who were not in the habit of wearing\nbouquets, but she could not borrow a circular artist to revolve the crank\nof the freezer, so she agitated it herself. Her husband had to go away\nprior to the festivities, but he ordered her not to crank the freezer. He\nhad very little influence with her, however, and so to-day he is a\nwidower. The church debt was revived in the following year, and now there\nisn’t a more thriving church debt anywhere in the country. Only last week\nthat church traded off $75 worth of groceries, in the form of asbestos\ncake and celluloid angel food, in such a way that if the original cost of\nthe groceries and the work were not considered, the clear profit was $13,\nafter the hall rent was paid. And why should the first cost of the\ngroceries be reckoned, when we stop to think that they were involuntarily\nfurnished by the depraved husband and father.",
        "I must add, also, that in the above estimate doctors’ bills and funeral\nexpenses are not reckoned.",
