        "[Footnote: Extract from an article entitled ’A World of Pure\nExperience,’ in the Journal of Philosophy, etc., September 29,1904.]",
        " Throughout the history of philosophy the subject and its object\nhave been treated as absolutely discontinuous entities; and\nthereupon the presence of the latter to the former, or\nthe ’apprehension’ by the former of the latter, has assumed a\nparadoxical character which all sorts of theories had to be invented\nto overcome. Representative theories put a mental ’representation,’\n’image,’ or ’content’ into the gap, as a sort of intermediary.\nCommonsense theories left the gap untouched, declaring our mind able\nto clear it by a self-transcending leap. Transcendentalist theories\nleft it impossible to traverse by finite knowers, and brought an\nabsolute in to perform the saltatory act. All the while, in the very\nbosom of the finite experience, every conjunction required to make\nthe relation intelligible is given in full. Either the knower and\nthe known are:",
        "(1) the self-same piece of experience taken twice over in different\ncontexts; or they are",
        "(2) two pieces of ACTUAL experience belonging to the same subject,\nwith definite tracts of conjunctive transitional experience\nbetween them; or",
        "(3) the known is a POSSIBLE experience either of that subject or\nanother, to which the said conjunctive transitions WOULD lead,\nif sufficiently prolonged.",
        "To discuss all the ways in which one experience may function as the\nknower of another, would be incompatible with the limits of\nthis essay. I have treated of type 1, the kind of knowledge called\nperception, in an article in the Journal of Philosophy, for\nSeptember 1, 1904, called ’Does consciousness exist?’ This is the\ntype of case in which the mind enjoys direct ’acquaintance’ with a\npresent object. In the other types the mind has ’knowledge-about’\nan object not immediately there. Type 3 can always formally and\nhypothetically be reduced to type 2, so that a brief description of\nthat type will now put the present reader sufficiently at my point\nof view, and make him see what the actual meanings of the\nmysterious cognitive relation may be.",
        "Suppose me to be sitting here in my library at Cambridge, at ten\nminutes’ walk from ’Memorial Hall,’ and to be thinking truly of\nthe latter object. My mind may have before it only the name, or it\nmay have a clear image, or it may have a very dim image of the\nhall, but such an intrinsic difference in the image makes no\ndifference in its cognitive function. Certain extrinsic phenomena,\nspecial experiences of conjunction, are what impart to the image, be\nit what it may, its knowing office.",
        "For instance, if you ask me what hall I mean by my image, and I can\ntell you nothing; or if I fail to point or lead you towards the\nHarvard Delta; or if, being led by you, I am uncertain whether the\nHall I see be what I had in mind or not; you would rightly deny that\nI had ’meant’ that particular hall at all, even tho my mental image\nmight to some degree have resembled it. The resemblance would\ncount in that case as coincidental merely, for all sorts of things\nof a kind resemble one another in this world without being held for\nthat reason to take cognizance of one another.",
        "On the other hand, if I can lead you to the hall, and tell you of\nits history and present uses; if in its presence I feel my idea,\nhowever imperfect it may have been, to have led hither and to be now\nTERMINATED; if the associates of the image and of the felt hall\nrun parallel, so that each term of the one context corresponds\nserially, as I walk, with an answering term of the other; why then\nmy soul was prophetic, and my idea must be, and by common consent\nwould be, called cognizant of reality. That percept was what I\nMEANT, for into it my idea has passed by conjunctive experiences of\nsameness and fulfilled intention. Nowhere is there jar, but every\nlater moment continues and corroborates an earlier one.",
        "In this continuing and corroborating, taken in no transcendental\nsense, but denoting definitely felt transitions, LIES ALL THAT THE\nKNOWING OF A PERCEPT BY AN IDEA CAN POSSIBLY CONTAIN OR SIGNIFY.\nWherever such transitions are felt, the first experience KNOWS the\nlast one. Where they do not, or where even as possibles they can\nnot, intervene, there can be no pretence of knowing. In this latter\ncase the extremes will be connected, if connected at all, by\ninferior relations–bare likeness or succession, or by ’withness’\nalone. Knowledge of sensible realities thus comes to life inside the\ntissue of experience. It is MADE; and made by relations that unroll\nthemselves in time. Whenever certain intermediaries are given, such\nthat, as they develop towards their terminus, there is\nexperience from point to point of one direction followed, and\nfinally of one process fulfilled, the result is that THEIR STARTING-\nPOINT THEREBY BECOMES A KNOWER AND THEIR TERMINUS AN OBJECT MEANT\nOR KNOWN. That is all that knowing (in the simple case considered)\ncan be known-as, that is the whole of its nature, put into\nexperiential terms. Whenever such is the sequence of our experiences\nwe may freely say that we had the terminal object ’in mind’ from the\noutset, even altho AT the outset nothing was there in us but a flat\npiece of substantive experience like any other, with no self-\ntranscendency about it, and no mystery save the mystery of coming\ninto existence and of being gradually followed by other pieces of\nsubstantive experience, with conjunctively transitional\nexperiences between. That is what we MEAN here by the object’s being\n’in mind.’ Of any deeper more real way of its being in mind we have\nno positive conception, and we have no right to discredit our actual\nexperience by talking of such a way at all.",
        "I know that many a reader will rebel at this. ’Mere intermediaries,’\nhe will say, ’even tho they be feelings of continuously\ngrowing fulfilment, only SEPARATE the knower from the known, whereas\nwhat we have in knowledge is a kind of immediate touch of the one\nby the other, an “apprehension” in the etymological sense of the\nword, a leaping of the chasm as by lightning, an act by which\ntwo terms are smitten into one over the head of their distinctness.\nAll these dead intermediaries of yours are out of each other, and\noutside of their termini still.’",
        "But do not such dialectic difficulties remind us of the dog dropping\nhis bone and snapping at its image in the water? If we knew any\nmore real kind of union aliunde, we might be entitled to brand all\nour empirical unions as a sham. But unions by continuous\ntransition are the only ones we know of, whether in this matter of a\nknowledge-about that terminates in an acquaintance, whether in\npersonal identity, in logical prediction through the copula ’is,’ or\nelsewhere. If anywhere there were more absolute unions, they could\nonly reveal themselves to us by just such conjunctive results. These\nare what the unions are worth, these are all that we can ever\npractically mean by union, by continuity. Is it not time to\nrepeat what Lotze said of substances, that to act like one is to be\none? Should we not say here that to be experienced as continuous is\nto be really continuous, in a world where experience and reality\ncome to the same thing? In a picture gallery a painted hook will\nserve to hang a painted chain by, a painted cable will hold a\npainted ship. In a world where both the terms and their distinctions\nare affairs of experience, conjunctions that are experienced must be\nat least as real as anything else. They will be ’absolutely’ real\nconjunctions, if we have no transphenomenal absolute ready,\nto derealize the whole experienced world by, at a stroke.",
        "So much for the essentials of the cognitive relation where the\nknowledge is conceptual in type, or forms knowledge ’about’ an\nobject. It consists in intermediary experiences (possible, if not\nactual) of continuously developing progress, and, finally, of\nfulfilment, when the sensible percept which is the object is\nreached. The percept here not only VERIFIES the concept, proves its\nfunction of knowing that percept to be true, but the percept’s\nexistence as the terminus of the chain of intermediaries CREATES the\nfunction. Whatever terminates that chain was, because it now proves\nitself to be, what the concept ’had in mind.’",
        "The towering importance for human life of this kind of knowing lies\nin the tact that an experience that knows another can figure as its\nREPRESENTATIVE, not in any quasi-miraculous ’epistemological’ sense,\nbut in the definite, practical sense of being its substitute in\nvarious operations, sometimes physical and sometimes mental, which\nlead us to its associates and results. By experimenting on our\nideas of reality, we may save ourselves the trouble of experimenting\non the real experiences which they severally mean. The ideas form\nrelated systems, corresponding point for point to the systems which\nthe realities form; and by letting an ideal term call up its\nassociates systematically, we may be led to a terminus which\nthe corresponding real term would have led to in case we had\noperated on the real world. And this brings us to the general\nquestion of substitution.",
        "What, exactly, in a system of experiences, does the ’substitution’\nof one of them for another mean?",
        "According to my view, experience as a whole is a process in time,\nwhereby innumerable particular terms lapse and are superseded\nby others that follow upon them by transitions which, whether\ndisjunctive or conjunctive in content, are themselves experiences,\nand must in general be accounted at least as real as the terms which\nthey relate. What the nature of the event called ’superseding’\nsignifies, depends altogether on the kind of transition\nthat obtains. Some experiences simply abolish their predecessors\nwithout continuing them in any way. Others are felt to increase or\nto enlarge their meaning, to carry out their purpose, or to bring us\nnearer to their goal. They ’represent’ them, and may fulfil their\nfunction better than they fulfilled it themselves. But to ’fulfil a\nfunction’ in a world of pure experience can be conceived and defined\nin only one possible way. In such a world transitions and arrivals\n(or terminations) are the only events that happen, tho they happen\nby so many sorts of path. The only function that one experience can\nperform is to lead into another experience; and the only fulfilment\nwe can speak of is the reaching of a certain experienced end. When\none experience leads to (or can lead to) the same end as another,\nthey agree in function. But the whole system of experiences as they\nare immediately given presents itself as a quasi-chaos through which\none can pass out of an initial term in many directions and yet\nend in the same terminus, moving from next to next by a great many\npossible paths.",
        "Either one of these paths might be a functional substitute for\nanother, and to follow one rather than another might on occasion be\nan advantageous thing to do. As a matter of fact, and in a general\nway, the paths that run through conceptual experiences, that\nis, through ’thoughts’ or ’ideas’ that ’know’ the things in which\nthey terminate, are highly advantageous paths to follow. Not only do\nthey yield inconceivably rapid transitions; but, owing to the\n’universal’ character [Footnote: Of which all that need be said in\nthis essay is that it also an be conceived as functional, and\ndefined in terms of transitions, or of the possibility of such.]\nwhich they frequently possess, and to their capacity for association\nwith one another in great systems, they outstrip the tardy\nconsecutions of the things themselves, and sweep us on towards our\nultimate termini in a far more labor-saving way than the following\nof trains of sensible perception ever could. Wonderful are the\nnew cuts and the short-circuits the thought-paths make. Most\nthought-paths, it is true, are substitutes for nothing actual; they\nend outside the real world altogether, in wayward fancies,\nutopias, fictions or mistakes. But where they do re-enter reality\nand terminate therein, we substitute them always; and with these\nsubstitutes we pass the greater number of our hours. [Footnote: This\nis why I called our experiences, taken all together, a quasi-chaos.\nThere is vastly more discontinuity in the sum total of experiences\nthan we commonly suppose. The objective nucleus of every man’s\nexperience, his own body, is, it is true, a continuous percept; and\nequally continuous as a percept (though we may be inattentive to it)\nis the material environment of that body, changing by gradual\ntransition when the body moves. But the distant parts of the\nphysical world are at all times absent from us, and form conceptual\nobjects merely, into the perceptual reality of which our life\ninserts itself at points discrete and relatively rare. Round their\nseveral objective nuclei, partly shared and common partly discrete\nof the real physical world, innumerable thinkers, pursuing their\nseveral lines of physically true cogitation, trace paths that\nintersect one another only at discontinuous perceptual points, and\nthe rest of the time are quite incongruent; and around all the\nnuclei of shared ’reality’ floats the vast cloud of experiences that\nare wholly subjective, that are non-substitutional, that find not\neven an eventual ending for themselves in the perceptual world–the\nmere day-dreams and joys and sufferings and wishes of the individual\nminds. These exist WITH one another, indeed, and with the objective\nnuclei, but out of them it is probable that to all eternity no\ninter-related system of any kind will ever be made.]",
        "Whosoever feels his experience to be something substitutional even\nwhile he has it, may be said to have an experience that\nreaches beyond itself. From inside of its own entity it says ’more,’\nand postulates reality existing elsewhere. For the\ntranscendentalist, who holds knowing to consist in a salto\nmotale across an ’epistemological chasm,’ such an idea presents no\ndifficulty; but it seems at first sight as if it might be\ninconsistent with an empiricism like our own. Have we not explained\nthat conceptual knowledge is made such wholly by the existence of\nthings that fall outside of the knowing experience itself–by\nintermediary experiences and by a terminus that fulfils?",
        "Can the knowledge be there before these elements that constitute its\nbeing have come? And, if knowledge be not there, how can\nobjective reference occur?",
        "The key to this difficulty lies in the distinction between knowing\nas verified and completed, and the same knowing as in transit and on\nits way. To recur to the Memorial Hall example lately used, it is\nonly when our idea of the Hall has actually terminated in\nthe percept that we know ’for certain’ that from the beginning it\nwas truly cognitive of THAT. Until established by the end of the\nprocess, its quality of knowing that, or indeed of knowing anything,\ncould still be doubted; and yet the knowing really was there, as the\nresult now shows. We were VIRTUAL knowers of the Hall long before we\nwere certified to have been its actual knowers, by the percept’s\nretroactive validating power. Just so we are ’mortal’ all the time,\nby reason of the virtuality of the inevitable event which will make\nus so when it shall have come.",
        "Now the immensely greater part of all our knowing never gets beyond\nthis virtual stage. It never is completed or nailed down. I\nspeak not merely of our ideas of imperceptibles like ether-waves or\ndissociated ’ions,’ or of ’ejects’ like the contents of our\nneighbors’ minds; I speak also of ideas which we might verify if\nwe would take the trouble, but which we hold for true altho\nunterminated perceptually, because nothing says ’no’ to us, and\nthere is no contradicting truth in sight. TO CONTINUE\nTHINKING UNCHALLENGED IS, NINETY-NINE TIMES OUT OF A HUNDRED, OUR\nPRACTICAL SUBSTITUTE FOR KNOWING IN THE COMPLETED SENSE. As each\nexperience runs by cognitive transition into the next one, and\nwe nowhere feel a collision with what we elsewhere count as truth or\nfact, we commit ourselves to the current as if the port were sure.\nWe live, as it, were, upon the front edge of an advancing wave-\ncrest, and our sense of a determinate direction in falling forward\nis all we cover of the future of our path. It is as if a\ndifferential quotient should be conscious and treat itself as an\nadequate substitute for a traced-out curve. Our experience, inter\nalia, is of variations of rate and of direction, and lives in these\ntransitions more than in the journey’s end. The experiences of\ntendency are sufficient to act upon–what more could we have DONE\nat those moments even if the later verification comes complete?",
        "This is what, as a radical empiricist, I say to the charge that the\nobjective reference which is so flagrant a character of our\nexperiences involves a chasm and a mortal leap. A\npositively conjunctive transition involves neither chasm nor leap.\nBeing the very original of what we mean by continuity, it makes a\ncontinuum wherever it appears. Objective reference is an incident of\nthe fact that so much of our experience comes as an insufficient\nand consists of process and transition. Our fields of experience\nhave no more definite boundaries than have our fields of view. Both\nare fringed forever by a MORE that continuously develops, and that\ncontinuously supersedes them as life proceeds. The relations,\ngenerally speaking, are as real here as the terms are, and the only\ncomplaint of the transcendentalist’s with which I could at all\nsympathize would be his charge that, by first making knowledge to\nconsist in external relations as I have done, and by then confessing\nthat nine-tenths of the time these are not actually but only\nvirtually there, I have knocked the solid bottom out of the whole\nbusiness, and palmed off a substitute of knowledge for the genuine\nthing. Only the admission, such a critic might say, that our ideas\nare self-transcendent and ’true’ already; in advance of the\nexperiences that are to terminate them, can bring solidity back to\nknowledge in a world like this, in which transitions and\nterminations are only by exception fulfilled.",
        "This seems to me an excellent place for applying the pragmatic\nmethod. What would the self-transcendency affirmed to exist in\nadvance of all experiential mediation or termination, be KNOWN-AS?\nWhat would it practically result in for US, were it true?",
        "It could only result in our orientation, in the turning of our\nexpectations and practical tendencies into the right path; and the\nright path here, so long as we and the object are not yet face to\nface (or can never get face to face, as in the case of ejects),\nwould be the path that led us into the object’s\nnearest neighborhood. Where direct acquaintance is\nlacking, ’knowledge about’ is the next best thing, and an\nacquaintance with what actually lies about the ’object, and is most\nclosely related to it, puts such knowledge within our grasp. Ether-\nwaves and your anger, for example, are things in which my thoughts\nwill never PERCTEPTUALLY terminate, but my concepts of them lead me\nto their very brink, to the chromatic fringes and to the hurtful\nwords and deeds which are their really next effects.",
        "Even if our ideas did in themselves possess the postulated self-\ntranscendency, it would still remain true that their putting us\ninto possession of such effects WOULD BE THE SOLE CASH-VALUE OF THE\nSELF-TRANSCENDENCY FOR US. And this cash-value, it is needless to\nsay, is verbatim et liberatim what our empiricist account pays in.\nOn pragmatist principles therefore, a dispute over self-\ntranscendency is a pure logomachy. Call our concepts of ejective\nthings self-transcendent or the reverse, it makes no difference, so\nlong as we don’t differ about the nature of that exalted virtue’s\nfruits–fruits for us, of course, humanistic fruits.",
        "The transcendentalist believes his ideas to be self-transcendent\nonly because he finds that in fact they do bear fruits. Why need\nhe quarrel with an account of knowledge that insists on naming this\neffect? Why not treat the working of the idea from next to next\nas the essence of its self-transcendency? Why insist that knowing is\na static relation out of time when it practically seems so much\na function of our active life? For a thing to be valid, says Lotze,\nis the same as to make itself valid. When the whole universe seems\nonly to be making itself valid and to be still incomplete (else why\nits ceaseless changing?) why, of all things, should knowing be\nexempt? Why should it not be making itself valid like everything\nelse? That some parts of it may be already valid or verified beyond\ndispute; the empirical philosopher, of course, like any one else,\nmay always hope.",
