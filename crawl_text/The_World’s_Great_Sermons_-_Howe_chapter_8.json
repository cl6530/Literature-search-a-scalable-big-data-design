        "THE REDEEMER’S TEARS OVER LOST SOULS",
        "John Howe, a leading writer and divine under the Commonwealth, was\nborn in 1630, at Loughborough, in Leicestershire, England. He was\neducated at Cambridge and Oxford, and ordained by Charles Herle,\nrector of Winwick, whom he styled, “a primitive bishop.” He became\nchaplain to Cromwell and his son Richard. Among his contributions to\nPuritan theology are “The Good Man the Living Temple of God,” and\n“Vanity of Men as Mortal,” He was a man of intellect and imagination.\nHis sermons, tho often long and cumbersome, are marked by warmth of\nfancy and a sublimity of spirit superior to his style. Howe was a\nleading spirit in the effort made for the union of the Congregational\nand Presbyterian bodies. He died in 1705.",

        "THE REDEEMER’S TEARS OVER LOST SOULS",
        "And when He was come near, He beheld the city, and wept over it,\nsaying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the\nthings which belong to thy peace! But now they are hid from thine\neyes.–Luke six., 41, 42.",
        "Such as live tinder the gospel have a day, or a present opportunity,\nfor the obtaining the knowledge of those things immediately belonging\nto their peace, and of whatsoever is besides necessary thereunto. I\nsay nothing what opportunities they have who never lived under the\ngospel, who yet no doubt might generally know more than they do, and\nknow better what they do know. It suffices who enjoy the gospel to\nunderstand our own advantages thereby. Nor, as to those who do enjoy\nit, is every one’s day of equal clearness. How few, in comparison,\nhave ever seen such a day as Jerusalem at this time did I made by\nthe immediate beams of the Sun of Righteousness! our Lord Himself\nvouchsafing to be their Instructor, so speaking as never man did, and\nwith such authority as far outdid their other teachers, and astonished\nthe hearers. In what transports did He use to leave those that heard\nHim, wheresoever He came, wondering at the gracious words that came\nout of His mouth! And with what mighty and beneficial works was He\nwent to recommend His doctrine, shining in the glorious power and\nsavoring of the abundant mercy of Heaven, so that every apprehensive\nmind might see the Deity was incarnate. God was come down to entreat\nwith men, and allure them into the knowledge and love of Himself. The\nWord was made flesh. What unprejudiced mind might not perceive it to\nbe so? He was there manifested and vailed at once; both expressions\nare made concerning the same matter. The divine beams were somewhat\nobscured, but did yet ray through that vail; so that His glory was\nbeheld of the only-begotten Son of His Father, full of grace and\ntruth.",
        "This Sun shone with a mild and benign, but with a powerful, vivifying\nlight. In Him was life, and that life was the light of men. Such a\nlight created unto the Jews this their day. Happy Jews, if they had\nunderstood their own happiness! And the days that followed to them\n(for a while) and the Gentile world were not inferior, in some\nrespects brighter and more glorious (the more copious gift of the\nHoly Ghost being reserved unto the crowning and enthroning of the\nvictorious Redeemer), when the everlasting gospel flew like lightning\nto the uttermost ends of the earth, and the word which began to be\nspoken by the Lord Himself was confirmed by them that heard Him, God\nalso Himself bearing them witness with signs, and wonders, and gifts\nof the Holy Ghost. No such day hath been seen this many an age. Yet\nwhithersoever this same gospel, for substance, comes, it also makes a\nday of the same kind, and affords always true tho diminished light,\nwhereby, however, the things of our peace might be understood and\nknown. The written gospel varies not, and if it be but simply and\nplainly proposed tho to some it be proposed with more advantage, to\nsome with less, still we have the same things immediately relating to\nour peace extant before our eyes ...",
        "This day hath its bounds and limits, so that when it is over and lost\nwith such, the things of their peace are forever hid from their eyes.\nAnd that this day is not infinite and endless, we see in the present\ninstance. Jerusalem had her day; but that day had its period, we see\nit comes to this at last, that now the things of her peace are hid\nfrom her eyes. We generally see the same thing, in that sinners are so\nearnestly prest to make use of the present time. To-day if you will\nhear His voice, harden not your hearts. They are admonished to seek\nthe Lord while He may be found, to call upon Him when He is nigh. It\nseems some time He will not be found, and will be far off. They are\ntold this is the accepted time, this is the day of salvation ... As it\nis certain death ends the day of grace with every unconverted person,\nsoit is very possible that it may end with divers before they die; by\ntheir total loss of all external means, or by the departure of the\nblest Spirit of God from them; so as to return and visit them no more.",
        "How the day of grace may end with a person, is to be understood by\nconsidering what it is that makes up and constitutes such a day. There\nmust become measure and proportion of time to make up this (or any)\nday, which is as the substratum and ground fore-laid. Then there must\nbe light superadded, otherwise it differs not from night, which may\nhave the same measure of mere time. The gospel revelation some way or\nother, must be had, as being the light of such a day. And again there\nmust be some degree of liveliness, and vital influence, the more usual\nconcomitant of light; the night doth more dispose men to drowsiness.\nThe same sun that enlightens the world disseminates also an\ninvigorating influence. If the Spirit of the living God do no way\nanimate the gospel revelation, and breathe in it, we have no day of\ngrace. It is not only a day of light, but a day of power, wherein\nsouls can be wrought upon, and a people made willing to become the\nLord’s. As the Redeemer revealed in the gospel, is the light of the\nworld, so He is life to it too, tho neither are planted or do take\nroot everywhere. In Him was life and that life was the light of men.\nThat light that rays from Him is vital light in itself, and in its\ntendency and design, tho it be disliked and not entertained by the\nmost. Whereas therefore these things must concur to make up such a\nday; if either a man’s time, his life on earth, expire, or if light\nquite fail him, or if all gracious influence be withheld, so as to be\ncommunicated no more, his day is done, the season of grace is over\nwith him. Now it is plain that many a one may lose the gospel before\nhis life end; and possible that all gracious influence may be\nrestrained, while as yet the external dispensation of the gospel\nremains. A sinner may have hardened his heart to that degree that God\nwill attempt him no more, in any kind, with any design of kindness to\nhim, not in that more inward, immediate way at all–i.e., by the\nmotions of His Spirit, which peculiarly can impart nothing but\nfriendly inclination, as whereby men are personally applied unto,\nso that can not be meant; nor by the voice of the gospel, which may\neither be continued for the sake of others, or they contained under\nit, but for their heavier doom at length. Which, tho it may seem\nsevere, is not to be thought strange, much less unrighteous.",
        "It is not to be thought strange to them that read the Bible, which so\noften speaks this sense; as when it warns and threatens men with so\nmuch terror. For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the\nknowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,\nbut a fearful looking for judgment, and fiery indignation, which shall\ndevour the adversaries. He that despised Moses’s law died without\nmercy, under two or three witnesses; of how much sorer punishment,\nsuppose ye, shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden under foot the\nSon of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith He\nwas sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit\nof grace? And when It tells us, after many overtures made to men in\nvain, of His having given them up. “But my people would not hearken to\nmy voice; and Israel would none of me; so I gave them up unto their\nown hearts’ lust: and they walked in their own counsels;” and\npronounces, “Let him that is unjust be unjust still, and let him which\nis filthy be filthy still,” and says, “In thy filthiness is lewdness,\nbecause I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged; thou shalt not\nbe purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to\nrest upon thee.” Which passages seem to imply a total desertion of\nthem, and retraction of all gracious influence. And when it speaks of\nletting them be under the gospel, and the ordinary means of salvation,\nfor the most direful purpose: as that, “This child (Jesus) was set\nfor the fall, as well as for the rising, of many in Israel\"; as that,\n“Behold, I lay in Zion a stumbling, and a rock of offense\"; and, “The\nstone which the builders refused, is made a stone of stumbling, and\na rock of offense, even to them which, stumble at the word, being\ndisobedient, whereunto also they were appointed\"; with that of our\nSavior Himself, “For judgment I am come into this world, that they\nwhich see not might see; and that they which see, might be made\nblind.” And most agreeable to those former places is that of the\nprophet, “But the word of the Lord was unto them precept upon precept,\nline upon line, here a little and there a little; that they might go,\nand fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.” And we may\nadd, that our God hath put us out of doubt that there is such a sin as\nthat which is eminently called the sin against the Holy Ghost; that\na man in such circumstances, and to such a degree, sin against that\nSpirit, that He will never move or breathe upon him more, but leave\nhim to a hopeless ruin; tho I shall not in this discourse determine\nor discuss the nature of it. But I doubt not it is somewhat else than\nfinal impenitency and infidelity; and that every one that dies, not\nhaving sincerely repented and believed, is not guilty of it, tho every\none that is guilty of it dies impenitent and unbelieving, but was\nguilty of it before; so it is not the mere want of time that makes\nhim guilty. Whereupon, therefore, that such may outlive their day of\ngrace, is out of the question ...",
        "Wherefore, no man can certainly know, or ought to conclude, concerning\nhimself or others, as long as they live, that the season of grace\nis quite over with them. As we can conceive no rule God hath set to\nHimself to proceed by, in ordinary cases of this nature; so nor is\nthere any He hath set unto us to judge by, in this case. It were to no\npurpose, and could be of no use to men to know so much; therefore it\nwere unreasonable to expect God should have settled and declared any\nrule, by which they might come to the knowledge of it. As the case is\nthen, viz.: there being no such rule, no such thing can be concluded;\nfor who can tell what an arbitrary, sovereign, free agent will do, if\nhe declare not his own purpose himself? How should it be known, when\nthe Spirit of God hath been often working upon the soul of man, that\nthis or that shall be the last act, and that he will never put forth\nanother? And why should God make it known? To the person himself whose\ncase it is, ’tis manifest it could be of no benefit. Nor is it to\nbe thought the Holy God will ever so alter the course of His own\nproceedings but that it shall be finally seen to all the world that\nevery man’s destruction was entirely, and to the last, of himself. If\nGod had made it evident to a man that he were finally rejected, he\nwere obliged to believe it. But shall it ever be said, God hath made\nanything a man’s duty which were inconsistent with his felicity. The\nhaving sinned himself into such a condition wherein he is forsaken\nof God is indeed inconsistent with it. And so the case is to\nstand–i.e., that his perdition be in immediate connection with\nhis sin, not with his duty; as it would be in immediate, necessary\nconnection with his duty, if he were bound to believe himself finally\nforsaken and a lost creature. For that belief makes him hopeless, and\na very devil, justifies his unbelief in the gospel, toward himself, by\nremoving and shutting up, toward himself, the object of such a faith,\nand consequently brings the matter to this state that he perishes, not\nbecause he doth not believe God reconcilable to man, but because, with\nparticular application to himself, he ought not so to believe. And it\nwere most unfit, and of very pernicious consequence, that such a thing\nshould be generally known concerning others....",
        "But tho none ought to conclude that their day or season of grace is\nquite expired, yet they ought to deeply apprehend the danger, lest\nit should expire before their necessary work be done and their peace\nmade. For tho it can be of no use for them to know the former, and\ntherefore they have no means appointed them by which to know it, ’tis\nof great use to apprehend the latter; and they have sufficient ground\nfor the apprehension. All the cautions and warnings wherewith the Holy\nSpirit abounds, of the kind with those already mentioned, have that\nmanifest design. And nothing can be more important, or opposite to\nthis purpose, than that solemn charge of the great apostle: “Work out\nyour own salvation with fear and trembling\"; considered together with\nthe subjoined ground of it; “For it is God that worketh in you to will\nand to do of his own good pleasure.” How correspondent is the one with\nthe other; work for He works: there were no working at all to any\npurpose, or with any hope, if He did not work. And work with fear and\ntrembling, for He works of His own good pleasure, q.d., “’Twere the\ngreatest folly imaginable to trifle with One that works at so perfect\nliberty, under no obligation, that may desist when He will; to impose\nupon so absolutely sovereign and arbitrary an Agent, that owes you\nnothing; and from whose former gracious operations not complied with\nyou can draw no argument, unto any following ones, that because He\ndoth, therefore He will. As there is no certain connection between\npresent time and future, but all time is made up of undepending, not\nstrictly coherent, moments, so as no man can be sure, because one\nnow exists, another shall; there is also no more certain connection\nbetween the arbitrary acts of a free agent within such time; so that\nI can not be sure, because He now darts in light upon me, is now\nconvincing me, now awakening me, therefore He will still do so, again\nand again.” Upon this ground then, what exhortation could be more\nproper than this? “Work out your salvation with fear and trembling.\"\nWhat could be more awfully monitory and enforcing of it than that He\nworks only of mere good will and pleasured How should I tremble to\nthink, if I should be negligent, or undutiful, He may give out the\nnext moment, may let the work fall, and me perish? And there is more\nespecial cause for such an apprehension upon the concurrence of such\nthings as these:",
        "1. If the workings of God’s Spirit upon the soul of a man have been\nmore than ordinarily strong and urgent, and do not now cease: if\nthere have been more powerful convictions, deeper humiliations, more\nawakened fears, more formed purposes of a new life, more fervent\ndesires that are now vanished, and the sinner returns to his dead and\ndull temper.",
        "2. If there be no disposition to reflect and consider the difference,\nno sense of his loss, but he apprehends such workings of spirit in him\nunnecessary troubles to him, and thinks it well he is delivered and\neased of them.",
        "3. If in the time when he was under such workings of the Spirit he\nhad made known his case to his minister, or any godly friend, whose\ncompany he now shuns, as not willing to be put in mind, or hear any\nmore of such matters.",
        "4. If, hereupon he hath more indulged sensual inclination, taken more\nliberty, gone against the check of his own conscience, broken former\ngood resolutions, involved himself in the guilt of any grosser sins.",
        "5. If conscience, so baffled, be now silent, lets him alone, grows\nmore sluggish and weaker, which it must as his lusts grow stronger.",
        "6. If the same lively, powerful ministry which before affected him\nmuch, now moves him not.",
        "7. If especially he is grown into a dislike of such preaching–if\nserious godliness, and what tends to it, are become distasteful to\nhim–if discourses of God, and of Christ, of death and judgment, and\nof a holy life, are reckoned superflous and needless, are unsavory and\ndisrelished–if he have learned to put disgraceful names upon\nthings of this import, and the persons that most value them live\naccordingly–if he hath taken the seat of the scorner, and makes it\nhis business to deride what he had once a reverence for, or took some\ncomplacency in.",
        "8. If, upon all this, God withdraw such a ministry, so that he is now\nwarned, admonished, exhorted and striven with, as formerly, no more.\nOh, the fearful danger of that man’s case! Hath he no cause to fear\nlest the things of his peace should be forever hid from his eyes?\nSurely he hath much cause of fear, but mot of despair. Fear in this\ncase would be his great duty, and might yet prove the means of saving\nhim–despair would be his very heinous and destroying sin. If yet he\nwould be stirred up to consider his case, whence he is fallen, and\nwhither he is falling, and set himself to serious seekings of God,\ncast down himself before Him, abase himself, cry for mercy as for his\nlife, there is yet hope in his case. God may make here an instance\nwhat He can obtain of Himself to do for a perishing wretch. But if\nwith any that have lived under the gospel, their day is quite expired,\nand the things of their peace now forever hid from their eyes, this is\nin itself a most deplorable case, and much lamented by our Lord Jesus\nHimself. That the case is in itself most deplorable, who sees not? A\nsoul lost! a creature capable of God! upon its way to Him! near to the\nkingdom of God! shipwrecked in the port! Oh, sinner, from how high a\nhope art thou fallen! into what depths of misery and we! And that it\nwas lamented by our Lord is in the text. He beheld the city (very\ngenerally, we have reason to apprehend, inhabited by such wretched\ncreatures) and wept over it. This was a very affectionate lamentation.\nWe lament often, very heartily, many a sad case for which we do not\nshed tears. But tears, such tears, falling from such eyes! the issues\nof the purest and best-governed passion that ever was, showed the true\ngreatness of the cause. Here could be no exorbitancy or unjust excess,\nnothing more than was proportional to the occasion. There needs no\nother proof that this is a sad case than that our Lord lamented it\nwith tears, which that He did we are plainly told, so that, touching\nthat, there is no place for doubt. All that is liable to question is,\nwhether we are to conceive in Him any like resentments of such cases,\nin His present glorified state? Indeed, we can not think heaven a\nplace or state of sadness or lamentation, and must take heed of\nconceiving anything there, especially on the throne of glory,\nunsuitable to the most perfect nature, and the most glorious state. We\nare not to imagine tears there, which, in that happy region are wiped\naway from inferior eyes–no grief, sorrow, or sighing, which are all\nfled away, and shall be no more, as there can be no other turbid\npassion of any kind. But when expressions that import anger or grief\nare used, even concerning God Himself, we must sever in our conception\neverything of imperfection, and ascribe everything of real perfection.\nWe are not to think such expressions signify nothing, that they have\nno meaning, or that nothing at all is to be attributed to Him under\nthem. Nor are we again to think they signify the same thing with what\nwe find in ourselves, and are wont to express by those names. In the\ndivine nature there may be real, and yet most serene, complacency and\ndisplacency–viz., that, unaccompanied by the least commotion, that\nimpart nothing of imperfection, but perfection rather, as it is a\nperfection to apprehend things suitably to what in themselves they\nare. The holy Scriptures frequently speak of God as angry, and grieved\nfor the sins of men, and their miseries which ensue therefrom. And\na real aversion and dislike is signified thereby, and by many other\nexpressions, which in us would signify vehement agitations of\naffection, that we are sure can have no place in Him. We ought,\ntherefore, in our own thoughts to ascribe to Him that calm aversion of\nwill, in reference to the sins and miseries of men in general; and in\nour own apprehensions to remove to the utmost distance from Him all\nsuch agitations of passion or affection, even tho some expressions\nthat occur carry a great appearance thereof, should they be understood\naccording to human measures, as they are human forms of speech. As, to\ninstance in what is said by the glorious God Himself, and very near in\nsense to what we have in the text, what can be more pathetic than that\nlamenting wish, “Oh, that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel\nhad walked in my ways!” But we must take heed lest, under the pretense\nthat we can not ascribe everything to God that such expressions seem\nto import, we therefore ascribe nothing. We ascribe nothing, if we do\nnot ascribe a real unwillingness that men should sin on, and perish,\nand consequently a real willingness that they should turn to Him,\nand live, which so many plain texts assert. And therefore it is\nunavoidably imposed upon us to believe that God is truly unwilling of\nsome things which He doth not think fit to interpose His omnipotency\nto hinder, and is truly willing of some things which He doth not put\nforth His omnipotency to effect.",
        "We can not, therefore, doubt but that,",
        "1. He distinctly comprehends the truth of any such case. He beholds,\nfrom the throne of His glory above, all the treaties which are held\nand managed with sinners in His name, and what their deportments are\ntherein. His eyes are as a flame of fire, wherewith He searcheth\nhearts and trieth reins. He hath seen therefore, sinner, all along\nevery time an offer of grace hath been made to thee, and been\nrejected; when thou hast slighted counsels and warnings that have been\ngiven thee, exhortations and treaties that have been prest upon thee\nfor many years together, and how thou hast hardened thy heart against\nreproofs and threatenings, against promises and allurements, and\nbeholds the tendency of all this, what is like to come to it, and\nthat, if thou persist, it will be bitterness in the end.",
        "2. That He hath a real dislike of the sinfulness of thy course. It is\nnot indifferent to Him whether thou obeyest or disobeyest the gospel,\nwhether thou turn and repent or no; that He is truly displeased at thy\ntrifling, sloth, negligence, impenitency, hardness of heart, stubborn\nobstinacy, and contempt of His grace, and takes real offense at them.",
        "3. He hath real kind propensions toward thee, and is ready to receive\nthy returning soul, and effectually to mediate with the offended\nmajesty of Heaven for thee, as long as there is any hope in thy case.",
        "4. When He sees there is no hope, He pities thee, while thou seest it\nnot, and dost not pity thyself. Pity and mercy above are not names\nonly; ’tis a great reality that is signified by them, and that hath\nplace here in far higher excellency and perfection than it can with us\npoor mortals here below. Ours is but borrowed and participated\nfrom that first fountain and original above. Thou dost not perish\nunlamented even with the purest heavenly pity, tho thou hast made thy\ncase incapable of remedy; as the well tempered judge bewails the sad\nend of the malefactor, whom justice obliges him not to spare or save.",
        "And that thou mayst not throw away thy soul and so great a hope,\nthrough mere sloth and loathness to be at some pains for thy life, let\nthe text, which hath been thy directory about the things that belong\nto thy peace, be also thy motive, as it gives thee to behold the Son\nof God weeping over such as would not know those things. Shall not the\nRedeemer’s tears move thee? O hard heart! Consider what these tears\nimport to this purpose.",
        "1. They signify the real depth and greatness of the misery into\nwhich thou are falling. They drop from an intellectual and most\ncomprehensive eye, that sees far and pierces deep into things, hath a\nwide and large prospect; takes the comfort of that forlorn state into\nwhich unreconcilable sinners are hastening, in all the horror of it.\nThe Son of God did not weep vain and causeless tears, or for a light\nmatter; nor did He for Himself either spend His own or desire\nthe profusion of others’ tears. “Weep not for me, O daughters of\nJerusalem,” etc. He knows the value of souls, the weight of guilt, and\nhow low it will press and sink them; the severity of God’s justice and\nthe power of His anger, and what the fearful effects of them will\nbe when they finally fall. If thou understandest not these things\nthyself, believe Him that did; at least believe His tears.",
        "2. They signify the sincerity of His love and pity, the truth and\ntenderness of His compassion. Canst thou think His deceitful tears?\nHis, who never knew guile? Was this like the rest of His course? And\nremember that He who shed tears did, from the same fountain of love\nand mercy, shed blood too! Was that also done to deceive? Thou makest\nthyself a very considerable thing indeed, if thou thinkest the Son of\nGod counted it worth His while to weep, and bleed, and die, to deceive\nthee into a false esteem of Him and His love. But if it be the\ngreatest madness imaginable to entertain any such thought but that His\ntears were sincere and unartificial, the natural, genuine expression\nof undissembled benignity and pity, thou art then to consider what\nlove and compassion thou art now sinning against; what bowels thou\nspurnest; and that if thou perishest, ’tis under such guilt as the\ndevils themselves are not liable to, who never had a Redeemer bleeding\nfor them, nor, that we ever find, weeping over them.",
        "3. They show the remedilessness of thy case if thou persist in\nimpenitency and unbelief till the things of thy peace be quite hid\nfrom thine eyes. These tears will then be the last issues of (even\ndefeated) love, of love that is frustrated of its kind design. Thou\nmayst perceive in these tears the steady, unalterable laws of\nheaven, the inflexibleness of the divine justice, that holds thee in\nadamantine bonds, and hath sealed thee up, if thou prove incurably\nobstinate and impenitent, unto perdition; so that even the Redeemer\nHimself, He that is mighty to save, can not at length save thee, but\nonly weep over thee, drop tears into thy flame, which assuage it not;\nbut (tho they have another design, even to express true compassion) do\nyet unavoidably heighten and increase the fervor of it, and will do so\nto all eternity. He even tells thee, sinner, “Thou hast despised My\nblood; thou shalt yet have My tears.” That would have saved thee,\nthese do only lament thee lost. But the tears wept over others, as\nlost and past hope, why should they not yet melt thee, while as yet\nthere is hope in thy case? If thou be effectually melted in thy very\nsoul, and looking to Him whom thou hast pierced, dost truly mourn over\nHim, thou mayst assure thyself the prospect His weeping eye had of\nlost souls did not include thee. His weeping over thee would argue thy\ncase forlorn and hopeless; thy mourning over Him will make it safe and\nhappy. That it may be so, consider, further, that,",
        "4. They signify how very intent He is to save souls, and how gladly\nHe would save thine, if yet thou wilt accept of mercy while it may be\nhad. For if He weep over them that will not be saved, from the same\nlove that is the spring of these tears, would saving mercies proceed\nto those that are become willing to receive them. And that love that\nwept over them that were lost, how will it glory in them that are\nsaved! There His love is disappointed and vexed, crossed in its\ngracious intendment; but here, having compassed it, how will He joy\nover thee with singing, and rest in His love! And thou also, instead\nof being revolved in a like ruin with the unreconciled sinners of old\nJerusalem, shalt be enrolled among the glorious citizens of the new,\nand triumph together with them in glory.",
