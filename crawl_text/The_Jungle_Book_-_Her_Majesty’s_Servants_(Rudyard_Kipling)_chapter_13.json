        "  You can work it out by Fractions or by simple Rule of Three,\n  But the way of Tweedle-dum is not the way of Tweedle-dee.\n  You can twist it, you can turn it, you can plait it till you drop,\n  But the way of Pilly Winky’s not the way of Winkie Pop!",
        "It had been raining heavily for one whole month–raining on a\ncamp of thirty thousand men and thousands of camels, elephants,\nhorses, bullocks, and mules all gathered together at a place\ncalled Rawal Pindi, to be reviewed by the Viceroy of India.  He\nwas receiving a visit from the Amir of Afghanistan–a wild king\nof a very wild country.  The Amir had brought with him for a\nbodyguard eight hundred men and horses who had never seen a camp\nor a locomotive before in their lives–savage men and savage\nhorses from somewhere at the back of Central Asia.  Every night a\nmob of these horses would be sure to break their heel ropes and\nstampede up and down the camp through the mud in the dark, or the\ncamels would break loose and run about and fall over the ropes of\nthe tents, and you can imagine how pleasant that was for men\ntrying to go to sleep.  My tent lay far away from the camel lines,\nand I thought it was safe.  But one night a man popped his head in\nand shouted, “Get out, quick!  They’re coming!  My tent’s gone!”",
        "I knew who “they” were, so I put on my boots and waterproof\nand scuttled out into the slush.  Little Vixen, my fox terrier,\nwent out through the other side; and then there was a roaring and\na grunting and bubbling, and I saw the tent cave in, as the pole\nsnapped, and begin to dance about like a mad ghost.  A camel had\nblundered into it, and wet and angry as I was, I could not help\nlaughing.  Then I ran on, because I did not know how many camels\nmight have got loose, and before long I was out of sight of the\ncamp, plowing my way through the mud.",
        "At last I fell over the tail-end of a gun, and by that knew I\nwas somewhere near the artillery lines where the cannon were\nstacked at night.  As I did not want to plowter about any more in\nthe drizzle and the dark, I put my waterproof over the muzzle of\none gun, and made a sort of wigwam with two or three rammers that\nI found, and lay along the tail of another gun, wondering where\nVixen had got to, and where I might be.",
        "Just as I was getting ready to go to sleep I heard a jingle of\nharness and a grunt, and a mule passed me shaking his wet ears.\nHe belonged to a screw-gun battery, for I could hear the rattle of\nthe straps and rings and chains and things on his saddle pad.  The\nscrew-guns are tiny little cannon made in two pieces, that are\nscrewed together when the time comes to use them.  They are taken\nup mountains, anywhere that a mule can find a road, and they are\nvery useful for fighting in rocky country.",
        "Behind the mule there was a camel, with his big soft feet\nsquelching and slipping in the mud, and his neck bobbing to and\nfro like a strayed hen’s.  Luckily, I knew enough of beast\nlanguage–not wild-beast language, but camp-beast language, of\ncourse–from the natives to know what he was saying.",
        "He must have been the one that flopped into my tent, for he\ncalled to the mule, “What shall I do?  Where shall I go?  I have\nfought with a white thing that waved, and it took a stick and hit\nme on the neck.”  (That was my broken tent pole, and I was very\nglad to know it.)  “Shall we run on?”",
        "“Oh, it was you,” said the mule, “you and your friends, that\nhave been disturbing the camp?  All right.  You’ll be beaten for\nthis in the morning.  But I may as well give you something on\naccount now.”",
        "I heard the harness jingle as the mule backed and caught the\ncamel two kicks in the ribs that rang like a drum.  “Another\ntime,” he said, “you’ll know better than to run through a mule\nbattery at night, shouting `Thieves and fire!’  Sit down, and keep\nyour silly neck quiet.”",
        "The camel doubled up camel-fashion, like a two-foot rule, and\nsat down whimpering.  There was a regular beat of hoofs in the\ndarkness, and a big troop-horse cantered up as steadily as though\nhe were on parade, jumped a gun tail, and landed close to the\nmule.",
        "“It’s disgraceful,” he said, blowing out his nostrils.  “Those\ncamels have racketed through our lines again–the third time\nthis week.  How’s a horse to keep his condition if he isn’t\nallowed to sleep.  Who’s here?”",
        "“I’m the breech-piece mule of number two gun of the First\nScrew Battery,” said the mule, “and the other’s one of your\nfriends.  He’s waked me up too.  Who are you?”",
        "“Number Fifteen, E troop, Ninth Lancers–Dick Cunliffe’s\nhorse.  Stand over a little, there.”",
        "“Oh, beg your pardon,” said the mule.  “It’s too dark to see\nmuch.  Aren’t these camels too sickening for anything?  I walked\nout of my lines to get a little peace and quiet here.”",
        "“My lords,” said the camel humbly, “we dreamed bad dreams in\nthe night, and we were very much afraid.  I am only a baggage\ncamel of the 39th Native Infantry, and I am not as brave as you\nare, my lords.”",
        "“Then why didn’t you stay and carry baggage for the 39th\nNative Infantry, instead of running all round the camp?” said the\nmule.",
        "“They were such very bad dreams,” said the camel.  “I am\nsorry.  Listen!  What is that?  Shall we run on again?”",
        "“Sit down,” said the mule, “or you’ll snap your long\nstick-legs between the guns.”  He cocked one ear and listened.\n“Bullocks!” he said.  “Gun bullocks.  On my word, you and your\nfriends have waked the camp very thoroughly.  It takes a good deal\nof prodding to put up a gun-bullock.”",
        "I heard a chain dragging along the ground, and a yoke of the\ngreat sulky white bullocks that drag the heavy siege guns when the\nelephants won’t go any nearer to the firing, came shouldering\nalong together.  And almost stepping on the chain was another\nbattery mule, calling wildly for “Billy.”",
        "“That’s one of our recruits,” said the old mule to the troop\nhorse.  “He’s calling for me.  Here, youngster, stop squealing.\nThe dark never hurt anybody yet.”",
        "The gun-bullocks lay down together and began chewing the cud,\nbut the young mule huddled close to Billy.",
        "“Things!” he said.  “Fearful and horrible, Billy!  They came\ninto our lines while we were asleep.  D’you think they’ll kill\nus?”",
        "“I’ve a very great mind to give you a number-one kicking,\"\nsaid Billy.  “The idea of a fourteen-hand mule with your training\ndisgracing the battery before this gentleman!”",
        "“Gently, gently!” said the troop-horse.  “Remember they are\nalways like this to begin with.  The first time I ever saw a man\n(it was in Australia when I was a three-year-old) I ran for half a\nday, and if I’d seen a camel, I should have been running still.”",
        "Nearly all our horses for the English cavalry are brought to\nIndia from Australia, and are broken in by the troopers\nthemselves.",
        "“True enough,” said Billy.  “Stop shaking, youngster.  The\nfirst time they put the full harness with all its chains on my\nback I stood on my forelegs and kicked every bit of it off.  I\nhadn’t learned the real science of kicking then, but the battery\nsaid they had never seen anything like it.”",
        "“But this wasn’t harness or anything that jingled,” said the\nyoung mule.  “You know I don’t mind that now, Billy.  It was\nThings like trees, and they fell up and down the lines and\nbubbled; and my head-rope broke, and I couldn’t find my driver,\nand I couldn’t find you, Billy, so I ran off with–with these\ngentlemen.”",
        "“H’m!” said Billy.  “As soon as I heard the camels were loose\nI came away on my own account.  When a battery–a screw-gun mule\ncalls gun-bullocks gentlemen, he must be very badly shaken up.\nWho are you fellows on the ground there?”",
        "The gun bullocks rolled their cuds, and answered both\ntogether:  “The seventh yoke of the first gun of the Big Gun\nBattery.  We were asleep when the camels came, but when we were\ntrampled on we got up and walked away.  It is better to lie quiet\nin the mud than to be disturbed on good bedding.  We told your\nfriend here that there was nothing to be afraid of, but he knew so\nmuch that he thought otherwise.  Wah!”",
        "They went on chewing.",
        "“That comes of being afraid,” said Billy.  “You get laughed at\nby gun-bullocks.  I hope you like it, young un.”",
        "The young mule’s teeth snapped, and I heard him say something\nabout not being afraid of any beefy old bullock in the world.  But\nthe bullocks only clicked their horns together and went on\nchewing.",
        "“Now, don’t be angry after you’ve been afraid.  That’s the\nworst kind of cowardice,” said the troop-horse.  “Anybody can be\nforgiven for being scared in the night, I think, if they see\nthings they don’t understand.  We’ve broken out of our pickets,\nagain and again, four hundred and fifty of us, just because a new\nrecruit got to telling tales of whip snakes at home in Australia\ntill we were scared to death of the loose ends of our head-ropes.”",
        "“That’s all very well in camp,” said Billy.  “I’m not above\nstampeding myself, for the fun of the thing, when I haven’t been\nout for a day or two.  But what do you do on active service?”",
        "“Oh, that’s quite another set of new shoes,” said the troop\nhorse.  “Dick Cunliffe’s on my back then, and drives his knees\ninto me, and all I have to do is to watch where I am putting my\nfeet, and to keep my hind legs well under me, and be bridle-wise.”",
        "“What’s bridle-wise?” said the young mule.",
        "“By the Blue Gums of the Back Blocks,” snorted the\ntroop-horse, “do you mean to say that you aren’t taught to be\nbridle-wise in your business?  How can you do anything, unless you\ncan spin round at once when the rein is pressed on your neck?  It\nmeans life or death to your man, and of course that’s life and\ndeath to you.  Get round with your hind legs under you the instant\nyou feel the rein on your neck.  If you haven’t room to swing\nround, rear up a little and come round on your hind legs.  That’s\nbeing bridle-wise.”",
        "“We aren’t taught that way,” said Billy the mule stiffly.\n“We’re taught to obey the man at our head: step off when he says\nso, and step in when he says so.  I suppose it comes to the same\nthing.  Now, with all this fine fancy business and rearing, which\nmust be very bad for your hocks, what do you do?”",
        "“That depends,” said the troop-horse.  “Generally I have to go\nin among a lot of yelling, hairy men with knives–long shiny\nknives, worse than the farrier’s knives–and I have to take care\nthat Dick’s boot is just touching the next man’s boot without\ncrushing it.  I can see Dick’s lance to the right of my right eye,\nand I know I’m safe.  I shouldn’t care to be the man or horse that\nstood up to Dick and me when we’re in a hurry.”",
        "“Don’t the knives hurt?” said the young mule.",
        "“Well, I got one cut across the chest once, but that wasn’t\nDick’s fault–”",
        "“A lot I should have cared whose fault it was, if it hurt!\"\nsaid the young mule.",
        "“You must,” said the troop horse.  “If you don’t trust your\nman, you may as well run away at once.  That’s what some of our\nhorses do, and I don’t blame them.  As I was saying, it wasn’t\nDick’s fault.  The man was lying on the ground, and I stretched\nmyself not to tread on him, and he slashed up at me.  Next time I\nhave to go over a man lying down I shall step on him–hard.”",
        "“H’m!” said Billy.  “It sounds very foolish.  Knives are dirty\nthings at any time.  The proper thing to do is to climb up a\nmountain with a well-balanced saddle, hang on by all four feet and\nyour ears too, and creep and crawl and wriggle along, till you\ncome out hundreds of feet above anyone else on a ledge where\nthere’s just room enough for your hoofs.  Then you stand still and\nkeep quiet–never ask a man to hold your head, young un–keep\nquiet while the guns are being put together, and then you watch\nthe little poppy shells drop down into the tree-tops ever so far\nbelow.”",
        "“Don’t you ever trip?” said the troop-horse.",
        "“They say that when a mule trips you can split a hen’s ear,\"\nsaid Billy.  “Now and again perhaps a badly packed saddle will\nupset a mule, but it’s very seldom.  I wish I could show you our\nbusiness.  It’s beautiful.  Why, it took me three years to find\nout what the men were driving at.  The science of the thing is\nnever to show up against the sky line, because, if you do, you may\nget fired at.  Remember that, young un.  Always keep hidden as\nmuch as possible, even if you have to go a mile out of your way.\nI lead the battery when it comes to that sort of climbing.”",
        "“Fired at without the chance of running into the people who\nare firing!” said the troop-horse, thinking hard.  “I couldn’t\nstand that.  I should want to charge–with Dick.”",
        "“Oh, no, you wouldn’t.  You know that as soon as the guns are\nin position they’ll do all the charging.  That’s scientific and\nneat.  But knives–pah!”",
        "The baggage-camel had been bobbing his head to and fro for\nsome time past, anxious to get a word in edgewise.  Then I heard\nhim say, as he cleared his throat, nervously:",
        "“I–I–I have fought a little, but not in that climbing\nway or that running way.”",
        "“No.  Now you mention it,” said Billy, “you don’t look as\nthough you were made for climbing or running–much.  Well, how\nwas it, old Hay-bales?”",
        "“The proper way,” said the camel.  “We all sat down–”",
        "“Oh, my crupper and breastplate!” said the troop-horse under\nhis breath.  “Sat down!”",
        "“We sat down–a hundred of us,” the camel went on, “in a big\nsquare, and the men piled our packs and saddles, outside the\nsquare, and they fired over our backs, the men did, on all sides\nof the square.”",
        "“What sort of men?  Any men that came along?” said the\ntroop-horse.  “They teach us in riding school to lie down and let\nour masters fire across us, but Dick Cunliffe is the only man I’d\ntrust to do that.  It tickles my girths, and, besides, I can’t see\nwith my head on the ground.”",
        "“What does it matter who fires across you?” said the camel.\n“There are plenty of men and plenty of other camels close by, and\na great many clouds of smoke.  I am not frightened then.  I sit\nstill and wait.”",
        "“And yet,” said Billy, “you dream bad dreams and upset the\ncamp at night.  Well, well!  Before I’d lie down, not to speak of\nsitting down, and let a man fire across me, my heels and his head\nwould have something to say to each other.  Did you ever hear\nanything so awful as that?”",
        "There was a long silence, and then one of the gun bullocks\nlifted up his big head and said, “This is very foolish indeed.\nThere is only one way of fighting.”",
        "“Oh, go on,” said Billy.  “Please don’t mind me.  I suppose\nyou fellows fight standing on your tails?”",
        "“Only one way,” said the two together.  (They must have been\ntwins.)  “This is that way.  To put all twenty yoke of us to the\nbig gun as soon as Two Tails trumpets.”  (\"Two Tails” is camp\nslang for the elephant.)",
        "“What does Two Tails trumpet for?” said the young mule.",
        "“To show that he is not going any nearer to the smoke on the\nother side.  Two Tails is a great coward.  Then we tug the big gun\nall together–Heya–Hullah!  Heeyah!  Hullah!  We do not climb\nlike cats nor run like calves.  We go across the level plain,\ntwenty yoke of us, till we are unyoked again, and we graze while\nthe big guns talk across the plain to some town with mud walls,\nand pieces of the wall fall out, and the dust goes up as though\nmany cattle were coming home.”",
        "“Oh!  And you choose that time for grazing?” said the young\nmule.",
        "“That time or any other.  Eating is always good.  We eat till\nwe are yoked up again and tug the gun back to where Two Tails is\nwaiting for it.  Sometimes there are big guns in the city that\nspeak back, and some of us are killed, and then there is all the\nmore grazing for those that are left.  This is Fate.  None the\nless, Two Tails is a great coward.  That is the proper way to\nfight.  We are brothers from Hapur.  Our father was a sacred bull\nof Shiva.  We have spoken.”",
        "“Well, I’ve certainly learned something tonight,” said the\ntroop-horse.  “Do you gentlemen of the screw-gun battery feel\ninclined to eat when you are being fired at with big guns, and Two\nTails is behind you?”",
        "“About as much as we feel inclined to sit down and let men\nsprawl all over us, or run into people with knives.  I never heard\nsuch stuff.  A mountain ledge, a well-balanced load, a driver you\ncan trust to let you pick your own way, and I’m your mule.  But–\nthe other things–no!” said Billy, with a stamp of his foot.",
        "“Of course,” said the troop horse, “everyone is not made in\nthe same way, and I can quite see that your family, on your\nfather’s side, would fail to understand a great many things.”",
        "“Never you mind my family on my father’s side,” said Billy\nangrily, for every mule hates to be reminded that his father was a\ndonkey.  “My father was a Southern gentleman, and he could pull\ndown and bite and kick into rags every horse he came across.\nRemember that, you big brown Brumby!”",
        "Brumby means wild horse without any breeding.  Imagine the\nfeelings of Sunol if a car-horse called her a “skate,” and you can\nimagine how the Australian horse felt.  I saw the white of his eye\nglitter in the dark.",
        "“See here, you son of an imported Malaga jackass,” he said\nbetween his teeth, “I’d have you know that I’m related on my\nmother’s side to Carbine, winner of the Melbourne Cup, and where I\ncome from we aren’t accustomed to being ridden over roughshod by\nany parrot-mouthed, pig-headed mule in a pop-gun pea-shooter\nbattery.  Are you ready?”",
        "“On your hind legs!” squealed Billy.  They both reared up\nfacing each other, and I was expecting a furious fight, when a\ngurgly, rumbly voice, called out of the darkness to the right–\n“Children, what are you fighting about there?  Be quiet.”",
        "Both beasts dropped down with a snort of disgust, for neither\nhorse nor mule can bear to listen to an elephant’s voice.",
        "“It’s Two Tails!” said the troop-horse.  “I can’t stand him.\nA tail at each end isn’t fair!”",
        "“My feelings exactly,” said Billy, crowding into the\ntroop-horse for company.  “We’re very alike in some things.”",
        "“I suppose we’ve inherited them from our mothers,” said the\ntroop horse.  “It’s not worth quarreling about.  Hi!  Two Tails,\nare you tied up?”",
        "“Yes,” said Two Tails, with a laugh all up his trunk.  “I’m\npicketed for the night.  I’ve heard what you fellows have been\nsaying.  But don’t be afraid.  I’m not coming over.”",
        "The bullocks and the camel said, half aloud, “Afraid of Two\nTails–what nonsense!”  And the bullocks went on, “We are sorry\nthat you heard, but it is true.  Two Tails, why are you afraid of\nthe guns when they fire?”",
        "“Well,” said Two Tails, rubbing one hind leg against the\nother, exactly like a little boy saying a poem, “I don’t quite\nknow whether you’d understand.”",
        "“We don’t, but we have to pull the guns,” said the bullocks.",
        "“I know it, and I know you are a good deal braver than you\nthink you are.  But it’s different with me.  My battery captain\ncalled me a Pachydermatous Anachronism the other day.”",
        "“That’s another way of fighting, I suppose?” said Billy, who\nwas recovering his spirits.",
        "“You don’t know what that means, of course, but I do.  It\nmeans betwixt and between, and that is just where I am.  I can see\ninside my head what will happen when a shell bursts, and you\nbullocks can’t.”",
        "“I can,” said the troop-horse.  “At least a little bit.  I try\nnot to think about it.”",
        "“I can see more than you, and I do think about it.  I know\nthere’s a great deal of me to take care of, and I know that nobody\nknows how to cure me when I’m sick.  All they can do is to stop my\ndriver’s pay till I get well, and I can’t trust my driver.”",
        "“Ah!” said the troop horse.  “That explains it.  I can trust\nDick.”",
        "“You could put a whole regiment of Dicks on my back without\nmaking me feel any better.  I know just enough to be\nuncomfortable, and not enough to go on in spite of it.”",
        "“We do not understand,” said the bullocks.",
        "“I know you don’t.  I’m not talking to you.  You don’t know\nwhat blood is.”",
        "“We do,” said the bullocks.  “It is red stuff that soaks into\nthe ground and smells.”",
        "The troop-horse gave a kick and a bound and a snort.",
        "“Don’t talk of it,” he said.  “I can smell it now, just\nthinking of it.  It makes me want to run–when I haven’t Dick on\nmy back.”",
        "“But it is not here,” said the camel and the bullocks.  “Why\nare you so stupid?”",
        "“It’s vile stuff,” said Billy.  “I don’t want to run, but I\ndon’t want to talk about it.”",
        "“There you are!” said Two Tails, waving his tail to explain.",
        "“Surely.  Yes, we have been here all night,” said the\nbullocks.",
        "Two Tails stamped his foot till the iron ring on it jingled.\n“Oh, I’m not talking to you.  You can’t see inside your heads.”",
        "“No.  We see out of our four eyes,” said the bullocks.  “We\nsee straight in front of us.”",
        "“If I could do that and nothing else, you wouldn’t be needed\nto pull the big guns at all.  If I was like my captain–he can\nsee things inside his head before the firing begins, and he shakes\nall over, but he knows too much to run away–if I was like him I\ncould pull the guns.  But if I were as wise as all that I should\nnever be here.  I should be a king in the forest, as I used to be,\nsleeping half the day and bathing when I liked.  I haven’t had a\ngood bath for a month.”",
        "“That’s all very fine,” said Billy.  “But giving a thing a\nlong name doesn’t make it any better.”",
        "“H’sh!” said the troop horse.  “I think I understand what Two\nTails means.”",
        "“You’ll understand better in a minute,” said Two Tails\nangrily.  “Now you just explain to me why you don’t like this!”",
        "He began trumpeting furiously at the top of his trumpet.",
        "“Stop that!” said Billy and the troop horse together, and I\ncould hear them stamp and shiver.  An elephant’s trumpeting is\nalways nasty, especially on a dark night.",
        "“I shan’t stop,” said Two Tails.  “Won’t you explain that,\nplease?  Hhrrmph!  Rrrt!  Rrrmph!  Rrrhha!”  Then he stopped\nsuddenly, and I heard a little whimper in the dark, and knew that\nVixen had found me at last.  She knew as well as I did that if\nthere is one thing in the world the elephant is more afraid of\nthan another it is a little barking dog.  So she stopped to bully\nTwo Tails in his pickets, and yapped round his big feet.  Two\nTails shuffled and squeaked.  “Go away, little dog!” he said.\n“Don’t snuff at my ankles, or I’ll kick at you.  Good little dog\n–nice little doggie, then!  Go home, you yelping little beast!\nOh, why doesn’t someone take her away?  She’ll bite me in a\nminute.”",
        "“Seems to me,” said Billy to the troop horse, “that our friend\nTwo Tails is afraid of most things.  Now, if I had a full meal for\nevery dog I’ve kicked across the parade-ground I should be as fat\nas Two Tails nearly.”",
        "I whistled, and Vixen ran up to me, muddy all over, and licked\nmy nose, and told me a long tale about hunting for me all through\nthe camp.  I never let her know that I understood beast talk, or\nshe would have taken all sorts of liberties.  So I buttoned her\ninto the breast of my overcoat, and Two Tails shuffled and stamped\nand growled to himself.",
        "“Extraordinary!  Most extraordinary!” he said.  “It runs in\nour family.  Now, where has that nasty little beast gone to?”",
        "I heard him feeling about with his trunk.",
        "“We all seem to be affected in various ways,” he went on,\nblowing his nose.  “Now, you gentlemen were alarmed, I believe,\nwhen I trumpeted.”",
        "“Not alarmed, exactly,” said the troop-horse, “but it made me\nfeel as though I had hornets where my saddle ought to be.  Don’t\nbegin again.”",
        "“I’m frightened of a little dog, and the camel here is\nfrightened by bad dreams in the night.”",
        "“It is very lucky for us that we haven’t all got to fight in\nthe same way,” said the troop-horse.",
        "“What I want to know,” said the young mule, who had been quiet\nfor a long time–\"what I want to know is, why we have to fight\nat all.”",
        "“Because we’re told to,” said the troop-horse, with a snort of\ncontempt.",
        "“Orders,” said Billy the mule, and his teeth snapped.",
        "“Hukm hai!” (It is an order!), said the camel with a gurgle,\nand Two Tails and the bullocks repeated, “Hukm hai!”",
        "“Yes, but who gives the orders?” said the recruit-mule.",
        "“The man who walks at your head–Or sits on your back–Or\nholds the nose rope–Or twists your tail,” said Billy and the\ntroop-horse and the camel and the bullocks one after the other.",
        "“But who gives them the orders?”",
        "“Now you want to know too much, young un,” said Billy, “and\nthat is one way of getting kicked.  All you have to do is to obey\nthe man at your head and ask no questions.”",
        "“He’s quite right,” said Two Tails.  “I can’t always obey,\nbecause I’m betwixt and between.  But Billy’s right.  Obey the man\nnext to you who gives the order, or you’ll stop all the battery,\nbesides getting a thrashing.”",
        "The gun-bullocks got up to go.  “Morning is coming,” they\nsaid.  “We will go back to our lines.  It is true that we only see\nout of our eyes, and we are not very clever.  But still, we are\nthe only people to-night who have not been afraid.  Good-night,\nyou brave people.”",
        "Nobody answered, and the troop-horse said, to change the\nconversation, “Where’s that little dog?  A dog means a man\nsomewhere about.”",
        "“Here I am,” yapped Vixen, “under the gun tail with my man.\nYou big, blundering beast of a camel you, you upset our tent.  My\nman’s very angry.”",
        "“Phew!” said the bullocks.  “He must be white!”",
        "“Of course he is,” said Vixen.  “Do you suppose I’m looked\nafter by a black bullock-driver?”",
        "“Huah!  Ouach!  Ugh!” said the bullocks.  “Let us get away\nquickly.”",
        "They plunged forward in the mud, and managed somehow to run\ntheir yoke on the pole of an ammunition wagon, where it jammed.",
        "“Now you have done it,” said Billy calmly.  “Don’t struggle.\nYou’re hung up till daylight.  What on earth’s the matter?”",
        "The bullocks went off into the long hissing snorts that Indian\ncattle give, and pushed and crowded and slued and stamped and\nslipped and nearly fell down in the mud, grunting savagely.",
        "“You’ll break your necks in a minute,” said the troop-horse.\n“What’s the matter with white men?  I live with ’em.”",
        "“They–eat–us!  Pull!” said the near bullock.  The yoke\nsnapped with a twang, and they lumbered off together.",
        "I never knew before what made Indian cattle so scared of\nEnglishmen.  We eat beef–a thing that no cattle-driver touches\n–and of course the cattle do not like it.",
        "“May I be flogged with my own pad-chains!  Who’d have thought\nof two big lumps like those losing their heads?” said Billy.",
        "“Never mind.  I’m going to look at this man.  Most of the\nwhite men, I know, have things in their pockets,” said the\ntroop-horse.",
        "“I’ll leave you, then.  I can’t say I’m over-fond of ’em\nmyself.  Besides, white men who haven’t a place to sleep in are\nmore than likely to be thieves, and I’ve a good deal of Government\nproperty on my back.  Come along, young un, and we’ll go back to\nour lines.  Good-night, Australia!  See you on parade to-morrow, I\nsuppose.  Good-night, old Hay-bale!–try to control your\nfeelings, won’t you?  Good-night, Two Tails!  If you pass us on\nthe ground tomorrow, don’t trumpet.  It spoils our formation.”",
        "Billy the Mule stumped off with the swaggering limp of an old\ncampaigner, as the troop-horse’s head came nuzzling into my\nbreast, and I gave him biscuits, while Vixen, who is a most\nconceited little dog, told him fibs about the scores of horses\nthat she and I kept.",
        "“I’m coming to the parade to-morrow in my dog-cart,” she said.\n“Where will you be?”",
        "“On the left hand of the second squadron.  I set the time for\nall my troop, little lady,” he said politely.  “Now I must go back\nto Dick.  My tail’s all muddy, and he’ll have two hours’ hard work\ndressing me for parade.”",
        "The big parade of all the thirty thousand men was held that\nafternoon, and Vixen and I had a good place close to the Viceroy\nand the Amir of Afghanistan, with high, big black hat of astrakhan\nwool and the great diamond star in the center.  The first part of\nthe review was all sunshine, and the regiments went by in wave\nupon wave of legs all moving together, and guns all in a line,\ntill our eyes grew dizzy.  Then the cavalry came up, to the\nbeautiful cavalry canter of “Bonnie Dundee,” and Vixen cocked her\near where she sat on the dog-cart.  The second squadron of the\nLancers shot by, and there was the troop-horse, with his tail like\nspun silk, his head pulled into his breast, one ear forward and\none back, setting the time for all his squadron, his legs going as\nsmoothly as waltz music.  Then the big guns came by, and I saw Two\nTails and two other elephants harnessed in line to a forty-pounder\nsiege gun, while twenty yoke of oxen walked behind.  The seventh\npair had a new yoke, and they looked rather stiff and tired.  Last\ncame the screw guns, and Billy the mule carried himself as though\nhe commanded all the troops, and his harness was oiled and\npolished till it winked.  I gave a cheer all by myself for Billy\nthe mule, but he never looked right or left.",
        "The rain began to fall again, and for a while it was too misty\nto see what the troops were doing.  They had made a big half\ncircle across the plain, and were spreading out into a line.  That\nline grew and grew and grew till it was three-quarters of a mile\nlong from wing to wing–one solid wall of men, horses, and guns.\nThen it came on straight toward the Viceroy and the Amir, and as\nit got nearer the ground began to shake, like the deck of a\nsteamer when the engines are going fast.",
        "Unless you have been there you cannot imagine what a\nfrightening effect this steady come-down of troops has on the\nspectators, even when they know it is only a review.  I looked at\nthe Amir.  Up till then he had not shown the shadow of a sign of\nastonishment or anything else.  But now his eyes began to get\nbigger and bigger, and he picked up the reins on his horse’s neck\nand looked behind him.  For a minute it seemed as though he were\ngoing to draw his sword and slash his way out through the English\nmen and women in the carriages at the back.  Then the advance\nstopped dead, the ground stood still, the whole line saluted, and\nthirty bands began to play all together.  That was the end of the\nreview, and the regiments went off to their camps in the rain, and\nan infantry band struck up with–",
        "              The animals went in two by two,\n                     Hurrah!\n                  The animals went in two by two,\n                  The elephant and the battery mul’,\n                  and they all got into the Ark\n                     For to get out of the rain!",
        "Then I heard an old grizzled, long-haired Central Asian chief,\nwho had come down with the Amir, asking questions of a native\nofficer.",
        "“Now,” said he, “in what manner was this wonderful thing\ndone?”",
        "And the officer answered, “An order was given, and they\nobeyed.”",
        "“But are the beasts as wise as the men?” said the chief.",
        "“They obey, as the men do.  Mule, horse, elephant, or bullock,\nhe obeys his driver, and the driver his sergeant, and the sergeant\nhis lieutenant, and the lieutenant his captain, and the captain\nhis major, and the major his colonel, and the colonel his\nbrigadier commanding three regiments, and the brigadier the\ngeneral, who obeys the Viceroy, who is the servant of the Empress.\nThus it is done.”",
        "“Would it were so in Afghanistan!” said the chief, “for there\nwe obey only our own wills.”",
        "“And for that reason,” said the native officer, twirling his\nmustache, “your Amir whom you do not obey must come here and take\norders from our Viceroy.”",
