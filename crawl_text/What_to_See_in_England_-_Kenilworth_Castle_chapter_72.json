        "Kenilworth is a small town, situated midway between Coventry and\nWarwick, about 5 miles from either town. It is chiefly noted for the\nruins of the famous castle, so celebrated from its association with Sir\nWalter Scott’s romance. The castle was built in the reign of Henry I.,\nthe site having been granted to Geoffrey de Clinton, Lord Chief Justice\nof England. The fortress at one time belonged to Simon de Montfort, who\nimprisoned Henry III. and his son Edward during the War of the Barons.\nEdward II. also was forced to sign his abdication there. Queen Elizabeth\ngave the castle as a present to her favourite, Robert Dudley, Earl of\nLeicester, who spent large sums in making great alterations and\nadditions, and entertained the Queen on four different occasions. The\nmemorable visit that has been described by Scott took place in 1575,\nwhen Dudley not only lodged Queen Elizabeth, her court, and 400 servants\nfor seventeen days, but provided a series of pageants and festivities to\nplease his royal mistress. During the Civil War the castle was taken by\nCromwell and given by him to Colonel Hawkesworth and some other officers\nbelonging to his army. They destroyed the place very much, draining the\nlake, besides pulling down walls and towers. The estate now belongs to\nthe Earl of Clarendon, to whose ancestor, Lawrence Hyde, Earl of\nRochester, it was given by Charles II. The only building which has still\npreserved its roof is the gatehouse, built by Robert Dudley. It is now\nused as a dwelling-house, and contains some beautiful panelling and also\na wonderful chimney-piece. The rest of the castle is very ruined, but\nthe remains are of great interest, being sufficient to convey an\nimpression of the castle as it originally stood. Close to the parish\nchurch are the ruins of the priory, which was founded at the same time\nas the castle, by Geoffrey de Clinton. At the Dissolution it was\ncompletely destroyed, and only the gatehouse remains.",
