        "Master Percy Edgar Smith James.  Mrs. James (of Sutton) visits us\nagain and introduces “Spiritual Seances.”",
        "\nMay 26, Sunday. - We went to Sutton after dinner to have meat-tea\nwith Mr. and Mrs. James.  I had no appetite, having dined well at\ntwo, and the entire evening was spoiled by little Percy - their\nonly son - who seems to me to be an utterly spoiled child.",
        "Two or three times he came up to me and deliberately kicked my\nshins.  He hurt me once so much that the tears came into my eyes.\nI gently remonstrated with him, and Mrs. James said:  “Please don’t\nscold him; I do not believe in being too severe with young\nchildren.  You spoil their character.”",
        "Little Percy set up a deafening yell here, and when Carrie tried to\npacify him, he slapped her face.",
        "I was so annoyed, I said:  “That is not my idea of bringing up\nchildren, Mrs. James.”",
        "Mrs. James said.  “People have different ideas of bringing up\nchildren - even your son Lupin is not the standard of perfection.”",
        "A Mr. Mezzini (an Italian, I fancy) here took Percy in his lap.\nThe child wriggled and kicked and broke away from Mr. Mezzini,\nsaying:  “I don’t like you - you’ve got a dirty face.”",
        "A very nice gentleman, Mr. Birks Spooner, took the child by the\nwrist and said:  “Come here, dear, and listen to this.”",
        "He detached his chronometer from the chain and made his watch\nstrike six.",
        "To our horror, the child snatched it from his hand and bounced it\ndown upon the ground like one would a ball.",
        "Mr. Birks Spooner was most amiable, and said he could easily get a\nnew glass put in, and did not suppose the works were damaged.",
        "To show you how people’s opinions differ, Carrie said the child was\nbad-tempered, but it made up for that defect by its looks, for it\nwas - in her mind - an unquestionably beautiful child.",
        "I may be wrong, but I do not think I have seen a much uglier child\nmyself.  That is MY opinion.",
        "May 30. - I don’t know why it is, but I never anticipate with any\npleasure the visits to our house of Mrs. James, of Sutton.  She is\ncoming again to stay for a few days.  I said to Carrie this\nmorning, as I was leaving:  “I wish, dear Carrie, I could like Mrs.\nJames better than I do.”",
        "Carrie said:  “So do I, dear; but as for years I have had to put up\nwith Mr. Gowing, who is vulgar, and Mr. Cummings, who is kind but\nmost uninteresting, I am sure, dear, you won’t mind the occasional\nvisits of Mrs. James, who has more intellect in her little finger\nthan both your friends have in their entire bodies.”",
        "I was so entirely taken back by this onslaught on my two dear old\nfriends, I could say nothing, and as I heard the ’bus coming, I\nleft with a hurried kiss - a little too hurried, perhaps, for my\nupper lip came in contact with Carrie’s teeth and slightly cut it.\nIt was quite painful for an hour afterwards.  When I came home in\nthe evening I found Carrie buried in a book on Spiritualism, called\nTHERE IS NO BIRTH, by Florence Singleyet.  I need scarcely say the\nbook was sent her to read by Mrs. James, of Sutton.  As she had not\na word to say outside her book, I spent the rest of the evening\naltering the stair-carpets, which are beginning to show signs of\nwear at the edges.",
        "Mrs. James arrived and, as usual, in the evening took the entire\nmanagement of everything.  Finding that she and Carrie were making\nsome preparations for table-turning, I thought it time really to\nput my foot down.  I have always had the greatest contempt for such\nnonsense, and put an end to it years ago when Carrie, at our old\nhouse, used to have seances every night with poor Mrs. Fussters\n(who is now dead).  If I could see any use in it, I would not care.\nAs I stopped it in the days gone by, I determined to do so now.",
        "I said:  “I am very sorry Mrs. James, but I totally disapprove of\nit, apart from the fact that I receive my old friends on this\nevening.”",
        "Mrs. James said:  “Do you mean to say you haven’t read THERE IS NO\nBIRTH?”  I said:  “No, and I have no intention of doing so.”  Mrs.\nJames seemed surprised and said:  “All the world is going mad over\nthe book.”  I responded rather cleverly:  “Let it.  There will be\none sane man in it, at all events.”",
        "Mrs. James said she thought it was very unkind, and if people were\nall as prejudiced as I was, there would never have been the\nelectric telegraph or the telephone.",
        "I said that was quite a different thing.",
        "Mrs. James said sharply:  “In what way, pray - in what way?”",
        "I said:  “In many ways.”",
        "Mrs. James said:  “Well, mention ONE way.”",
        "I replied quietly:  “Pardon me, Mrs. James; I decline to discuss\nthe matter.  I am not interested in it.”",
        "Sarah at this moment opened the door and showed in Cummings, for\nwhich I was thankful, for I felt it would put a stop to this\nfoolish table-turning.  But I was entirely mistaken; for, on the\nsubject being opened again, Cummings said he was most interested in\nSpiritualism, although he was bound to confess he did not believe\nmuch in it; still, he was willing to be convinced.",
        "I firmly declined to take any part in it, with the result that my\npresence was ignored.  I left the three sitting in the parlour at a\nsmall round table which they had taken out of the drawing-room.  I\nwalked into the hall with the ultimate intention of taking a little\nstroll.  As I opened the door, who should come in but Gowing!",
        "On hearing what was going on, he proposed that we should join the\ncircle and he would go into a trance.  He added that he KNEW a few\nthings about old Cummings, and would INVENT a few about Mrs. James.\nKnowing how dangerous Gowing is, I declined to let him take part in\nany such foolish performance.  Sarah asked me if she could go out\nfor half an hour, and I gave her permission, thinking it would be\nmore comfortable to sit with Gowing in the kitchen than in the cold\ndrawing-room.  We talked a good deal about Lupin and Mr. and Mrs.\nMurray Posh, with whom he is as usual spending the evening.  Gowing\nsaid:  “I say, it wouldn’t be a bad thing for Lupin if old Posh\nkicked the bucket.”",
        "My heart gave a leap of horror, and I rebuked Gowing very sternly\nfor joking on such a subject.  I lay awake half the night thinking\nof it - the other hall was spent in nightmares on the same subject.",
        "May 31. - I wrote a stern letter to the laundress.  I was rather\npleased with the letter, for I thought it very satirical.  I said:\n“You have returned the handkerchiefs without the colour.  Perhaps\nyou will return either the colour or the value of the\nhandkerchiefs.”  I shall be rather curious to know what she will\nhave to say.",
        "More table-turning in the evening.  Carrie said last night was in a\nmeasure successful, and they ought to sit again.  Cummings came in,\nand seemed interested.  I had the gas lighted in the drawing-room,\ngot the steps, and repaired the cornice, which has been a bit of an\neyesore to me.  In a fit of unthinkingness - if I may use such an\nexpression, - I gave the floor over the parlour, where the seance\nwas taking place, two loud raps with the hammer.  I felt sorry\nafterwards, for it was the sort of ridiculous, foolhardy thing that\nGowing or Lupin would have done.",
        "However, they never even referred to it, but Carrie declared that a\nmessage came through the table to her of a wonderful description,\nconcerning someone whom she and I knew years ago, and who was quite\nunknown to the others.",
        "When we went to bed, Carrie asked me as a favour to sit to-morrow\nnight, to oblige her.  She said it seemed rather unkind and\nunsociable on my part.  I promised I would sit once.",
        "June 1. - I sat reluctantly at the table in the evening, and I am\nbound to admit some curious things happened.  I contend they were\ncoincidences, but they were curious.  For instance, the table kept\ntilting towards me, which Carrie construed as a desire that I\nshould ask the spirit a question.  I obeyed the rules, and I asked\nthe spirit (who said her name was Lina) if she could tell me the\nname of an old aunt of whom I was thinking, and whom we used to\ncall Aunt Maggie.  The table spelled out C A T.  We could make\nnothing out of it, till I suddenly remembered that her second name\nwas Catherine, which it was evidently trying to spell.  I don’t\nthink even Carrie knew this.  But if she did, she would never\ncheat.  I must admit it was curious.  Several other things\nhappened, and I consented to sit at another seance on Monday.",
        "June 3. - The laundress called, and said she was very sorry about\nthe handkerchiefs, and returned ninepence.  I said, as the colour\nwas completely washed out and the handkerchiefs quite spoiled,\nninepence was not enough.  Carrie replied that the two\nhandkerchiefs originally only cost sixpence, for she remembered\nbring them at a sale at the Holloway BON MARCHE.  In that case, I\ninsisted that threepence buying should be returned to the\nlaundress.  Lupin has gone to stay with the Poshs for a few days.\nI must say I feel very uncomfortable about it.  Carrie said I was\nridiculous to worry about it.  Mr. Posh was very fond of Lupin,\nwho, after all, was only a mere boy.",
        "In the evening we had another seance, which, in some respects, was\nvery remarkable, although the first part of it was a little\ndoubtful.  Gowing called, as well as Cummings, and begged to be\nallowed to join the circle.  I wanted to object, but Mrs. James,\nwho appears a good Medium (that is, if there is anything in it at\nall), thought there might be a little more spirit power if Gowing\njoined; so the five of us sat down.",
        "The moment I turned out the gas, and almost before I could get my\nhands on the table, it rocked violently and tilted, and began\nmoving quickly across the room.  Gowing shouted out:  “Way oh!\nsteady, lad, steady!”  I told Gowing if he could not behave himself\nI should light the gas, and put an end to the seance.",
        "To tell the truth, I thought Gowing was playing tricks, and I\nhinted as much; but Mrs. James said she had often seen the table go\nright off the ground.  The spirit Lina came again, and said, “WARN\"\nthree or four times, and declined to explain.  Mrs. James said\n“Lina” was stubborn sometimes.  She often behaved like that, and\nthe best thing to do was to send her away.",
        "She then hit the table sharply, and said:  “Go away, Lina; you are\ndisagreeable.  Go away!”  I should think we sat nearly three-\nquarters of an hour with nothing happening.  My hands felt quite\ncold, and I suggested we should stop the seance.  Carrie and Mrs.\nJames, as well as Cummings, would not agree to it.  In about ten\nminutes’ time there was some tilting towards me.  I gave the\nalphabet, and it spelled out S P O O F.  As I have heard both\nGowing and Lupin use the word, and as I could hear Gowing silently\nlaughing, I directly accused him of pushing the table.  He denied\nit; but, I regret to say, I did not believe him.",
        "Gowing said:  “Perhaps it means ’Spook,’ a ghost.”",
        "I said:  “YOU know it doesn’t mean anything of the sort.”",
        "Gowing said:  “Oh! very well - I’m sorry I ’spook,’” and he rose\nfrom the table.",
        "No one took any notice of the stupid joke, and Mrs. James suggested\nhe should sit out for a while.  Gowing consented and sat in the\narm-chair.",
        "The table began to move again, and we might have had a wonderful\nseance but for Gowing’s stupid interruptions.  In answer to the\nalphabet from Carrie the table spelt “NIPUL,” then the “WARN” three\ntimes.  We could not think what it meant till Cummings pointed out\nthat “NIPUL” was Lupin spelled backwards.  This was quite exciting.\nCarrie was particularly excited, and said she hoped nothing\nhorrible was going to happen.",
        "Mrs. James asked if “Lina” was the spirit.  The table replied\nfirmly, “No,” and the spirit would not give his or her name.  We\nthen had the message, “NIPUL will be very rich.”",
        "Carrie said she felt quite relieved, but the word “WARN” was again\nspelt out.  The table then began to oscillate violently, and in\nreply to Mrs. James, who spoke very softly to the table, the spirit\nbegan to spell its name.  It first spelled “DRINK.”",
        "Gowing here said:  “Ah! that’s more in my line.”",
        "I asked him to be quiet as the name might not be completed.",
        "The table then spelt “WATER.”",
        "Gowing here interrupted again, and said:  “Ah! that’s NOT in my\nline.  OUTSIDE if you like, but not inside.”",
        "Carrie appealed to him to be quiet.",
        "The table then spelt “CAPTAIN,” and Mrs. James startled us by\ncrying out, “Captain Drinkwater, a very old friend of my father’s,\nwho has been dead some years.”",
        "This was more interesting, and I could not help thinking that after\nall there must be something in Spiritualism.",
        "Mrs. James asked the spirit to interpret the meaning of the word\n“Warn” as applied to “NIPUL.”  The alphabet was given again, and we\ngot the word “BOSH.”",
        "Gowing here muttered:  “So it is.”",
        "Mrs. James said she did not think the spirit meant that, as Captain\nDrinkwater was a perfect gentleman, and would never have used the\nword in answer to a lady’s question.  Accordingly the alphabet was\ngiven again.",
        "This time the table spelled distinctly “POSH.”  We all thought of\nMrs. Murray Posh and Lupin.  Carrie was getting a little\ndistressed, and as it was getting late we broke up the circle.",
        "We arranged to have one more to-morrow, as it will be Mrs. James’\nlast night in town.  We also determined NOT to have Gowing present.",
        "Cummings, before leaving, said it was certainly interesting, but he\nwished the spirits would say something about him.",
        "June 4. - Quite looking forward to the seance this evening.  Was\nthinking of it all the day at the office.",
        "Just as we sat down at the table we were annoyed by Gowing entering\nwithout knocking.",
        "He said:  “I am not going to stop, but I have brought with me a\nsealed envelope, which I know I can trust with Mrs. Pooter.  In\nthat sealed envelope is a strip of paper on which I have asked a\nsimple question.  If the spirits can answer that question, I will\nbelieve in Spiritualism.”",
        "I ventured the expression that it might be impossible.",
        "Mrs. James said:  “Oh no! it is of common occurrence for the\nspirits to answer questions under such conditions - and even for\nthem to write on locked slates.  It is quite worth trying.  If\n’Lina’ is in a good temper, she is certain to do it.”",
        "Gowing said:  “All right; then I shall be a firm believer.  I shall\nperhaps drop in about half-past nine or ten, and hear the result.”",
        "He then left and we sat a long time.  Cummings wanted to know\nsomething about some undertaking in which he was concerned, but he\ncould get no answer of any description whatever - at which he said\nhe was very disappointed and was afraid there was not much in\ntable-turning after all.  I thought this rather selfish of him.\nThe seance was very similar to the one last night, almost the same\nin fact.  So we turned to the letter.  “Lina” took a long time\nanswering the question, but eventually spelt out “ROSES, LILIES,\nAND COWS.”  There was great rocking of the table at this time, and\nMrs. James said:  “If that is Captain Drinkwater, let us ask him\nthe answer as well?”",
        "It was the spirit of the Captain, and, most singular, he gave the\nsame identical answer:  “ROSES, LILIES, AND COWS.”",
        "I cannot describe the agitation with which Carrie broke the seal,\nor the disappointment we felt on reading the question, to which the\nanswer was so inappropriate.  The question was, “WHAT’S OLD\nPOOTER’S AGE?”",
        "This quite decided me.",
        "As I had put my foot down on Spiritualism years ago, so I would\nagain.",
        "I am pretty easy-going as a rule, but I can be extremely firm when\ndriven to it.",
        "I said slowly, as I turned up the gas:  “This is the last of this\nnonsense that shall ever take place under my roof.  I regret I\npermitted myself to be a party to such tomfoolery.  If there is\nanything in it - which I doubt - it is nothing of any good, and I\nWON’T HAVE IT AGAIN.  That is enough.”",
        "Mrs. James said:  “I think, Mr. Pooter, you are rather over-\nstepping - “",
        "I said:  “Hush, madam.  I am master of this house - please\nunderstand that.”",
        "Mrs. James made an observation which I sincerely hope I was\nmistaken in.  I was in such a rage I could not quite catch what she\nsaid.  But if I thought she said what it sounded like, she should\nnever enter the house again.",
