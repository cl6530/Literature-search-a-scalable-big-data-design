        "When Mary Lennox was sent to Misselthwaite Manor\nto live with her uncle everybody said she was the most\ndisagreeable-looking child ever seen.  It was true, too.\nShe had a little thin face and a little thin body,\nthin light hair and a sour expression.  Her hair was yellow,\nand her face was yellow because she had been born in\nIndia and had always been ill in one way or another.\nHer father had held a position under the English\nGovernment and had always been busy and ill himself,\nand her mother had been a great beauty who cared only\nto go to parties and amuse herself with gay people.\nShe had not wanted a little girl at all, and when Mary\nwas born she handed her over to the care of an Ayah,\nwho was made to understand that if she wished to please\nthe Mem Sahib she must keep the child out of sight as much\nas possible.  So when she was a sickly, fretful, ugly little\nbaby she was kept out of the way, and when she became\na sickly, fretful, toddling thing she was kept out of\nthe way also.  She never remembered seeing familiarly\nanything but the dark faces of her Ayah and the other\nnative servants, and as they always obeyed her and gave\nher her own way in everything, because the Mem Sahib\nwould be angry if she was disturbed by her crying,\nby the time she was six years old she was as tyrannical\nand selfish a little pig as ever lived.  The young English\ngoverness who came to teach her to read and write disliked\nher so much that she gave up her place in three months,\nand when other governesses came to try to fill it they\nalways went away in a shorter time than the first one.\nSo if Mary had not chosen to really want to know how\nto read books she would never have learned her letters at all.",
        "One frightfully hot morning, when she was about nine\nyears old, she awakened feeling very cross, and she became\ncrosser still when she saw that the servant who stood\nby her bedside was not her Ayah.",
        "“Why did you come?” she said to the strange woman.\n“I will not let you stay.  Send my Ayah to me.”",
        "The woman looked frightened, but she only stammered\nthat the Ayah could not come and when Mary threw herself\ninto a passion and beat and kicked her, she looked only\nmore frightened and repeated that it was not possible\nfor the Ayah to come to Missie Sahib.",
        "There was something mysterious in the air that morning.\nNothing was done in its regular order and several of the\nnative servants seemed missing, while those whom Mary\nsaw slunk or hurried about with ashy and scared faces.\nBut no one would tell her anything and her Ayah did not come.\nShe was actually left alone as the morning went on,\nand at last she wandered out into the garden and began\nto play by herself under a tree near the veranda.\nShe pretended that she was making a flower-bed, and she stuck\nbig scarlet hibiscus blossoms into little heaps of earth,\nall the time growing more and more angry and muttering\nto herself the things she would say and the names she\nwould call Saidie when she returned.",
        "“Pig! Pig! Daughter of Pigs!” she said, because to call\na native a pig is the worst insult of all.",
        "She was grinding her teeth and saying this over and over\nagain when she heard her mother come out on the veranda\nwith some one.  She was with a fair young man and they stood\ntalking together in low strange voices.  Mary knew the fair\nyoung man who looked like a boy.  She had heard that he\nwas a very young officer who had just come from England.\nThe child stared at him, but she stared most at her mother.\nShe always did this when she had a chance to see her,\nbecause the Mem Sahib–Mary used to call her that oftener\nthan anything else–was such a tall, slim, pretty person\nand wore such lovely clothes.  Her hair was like curly\nsilk and she had a delicate little nose which seemed\nto be disdaining things, and she had large laughing eyes.\nAll her clothes were thin and floating, and Mary said they\nwere “full of lace.” They looked fuller of lace than ever\nthis morning, but her eyes were not laughing at all.\nThey were large and scared and lifted imploringly to the fair\nboy officer’s face.",
        "“Is it so very bad? Oh, is it?” Mary heard her say.",
        "“Awfully,” the young man answered in a trembling voice.\n“Awfully, Mrs. Lennox.  You ought to have gone to the hills\ntwo weeks ago.”",
        "The Mem Sahib wrung her hands.",
        "“Oh, I know I ought!” she cried.  “I only stayed to go\nto that silly dinner party.  What a fool I was!”",
        "At that very moment such a loud sound of wailing broke\nout from the servants’ quarters that she clutched the young\nman’s arm, and Mary stood shivering from head to foot.\nThe wailing grew wilder and wilder.  “What is it? What is it?\"\nMrs. Lennox gasped.",
        "“Some one has died,” answered the boy officer.  “You did\nnot say it had broken out among your servants.”",
        "“I did not know!” the Mem Sahib cried.  “Come with me!\nCome with me!” and she turned and ran into the house.",
        "After that, appalling things happened, and the mysteriousness\nof the morning was explained to Mary.  The cholera had\nbroken out in its most fatal form and people were dying\nlike flies.  The Ayah had been taken ill in the night,\nand it was because she had just died that the servants\nhad wailed in the huts.  Before the next day three other\nservants were dead and others had run away in terror.\nThere was panic on every side, and dying people in all\nthe bungalows.",
        "During the confusion and bewilderment of the second day Mary\nhid herself in the nursery and was forgotten by everyone.\nNobody thought of her, nobody wanted her, and strange things\nhappened of which she knew nothing.  Mary alternately cried\nand slept through the hours.  She only knew that people were\nill and that she heard mysterious and frightening sounds.\nOnce she crept into the dining-room and found it empty,\nthough a partly finished meal was on the table and chairs\nand plates looked as if they had been hastily pushed\nback when the diners rose suddenly for some reason.\nThe child ate some fruit and biscuits, and being thirsty\nshe drank a glass of wine which stood nearly filled.\nIt was sweet, and she did not know how strong it was.\nVery soon it made her intensely drowsy, and she went back\nto her nursery and shut herself in again, frightened by cries\nshe heard in the huts and by the hurrying sound of feet.\nThe wine made her so sleepy that she could scarcely keep her\neyes open and she lay down on her bed and knew nothing more\nfor a long time.",
        "Many things happened during the hours in which she slept\nso heavily, but she was not disturbed by the wails and the\nsound of things being carried in and out of the bungalow.",
        "When she awakened she lay and stared at the wall.\nThe house was perfectly still.  She had never known\nit to be so silent before.  She heard neither voices\nnor footsteps, and wondered if everybody had got well of\nthe cholera and all the trouble was over.  She wondered\nalso who would take care of her now her Ayah was dead.\nThere would be a new Ayah, and perhaps she would know\nsome new stories.  Mary had been rather tired of the\nold ones.  She did not cry because her nurse had died.\nShe was not an affectionate child and had never cared much\nfor any one.  The noise and hurrying about and wailing\nover the cholera had frightened her, and she had been angry\nbecause no one seemed to remember that she was alive.\nEveryone was too panic-stricken to think of a little\ngirl no one was fond of.  When people had the cholera\nit seemed that they remembered nothing but themselves.\nBut if everyone had got well again, surely some one would\nremember and come to look for her.",
        "But no one came, and as she lay waiting the house seemed\nto grow more and more silent.  She heard something rustling\non the matting and when she looked down she saw a little\nsnake gliding along and watching her with eyes like jewels.\nShe was not frightened, because he was a harmless little\nthing who would not hurt her and he seemed in a hurry\nto get out of the room.  He slipped under the door as she\nwatched him.",
        "“How queer and quiet it is,” she said.  “It sounds as\nif there were no one in the bungalow but me and the snake.”",
        "Almost the next minute she heard footsteps in the compound,\nand then on the veranda.  They were men’s footsteps,\nand the men entered the bungalow and talked in low voices.\nNo one went to meet or speak to them and they seemed\nto open doors and look into rooms.  “What desolation!\"\nshe heard one voice say.  “That pretty, pretty woman!\nI suppose the child, too.  I heard there was a child,\nthough no one ever saw her.”",
        "Mary was standing in the middle of the nursery when they\nopened the door a few minutes later.  She looked an ugly,\ncross little thing and was frowning because she was\nbeginning to be hungry and feel disgracefully neglected.\nThe first man who came in was a large officer she had once\nseen talking to her father.  He looked tired and troubled,\nbut when he saw her he was so startled that he almost\njumped back.",
        "“Barney!” he cried out.  “There is a child here! A child\nalone! In a place like this! Mercy on us, who is she!”",
        "“I am Mary Lennox,” the little girl said, drawing herself\nup stiffly.  She thought the man was very rude to call her\nfather’s bungalow “A place like this!” “I fell asleep when\neveryone had the cholera and I have only just wakened up.\nWhy does nobody come?”",
        "“It is the child no one ever saw!” exclaimed the man,\nturning to his companions.  “She has actually been forgotten!”",
        "“Why was I forgotten?” Mary said, stamping her foot.\n“Why does nobody come?”",
        "The young man whose name was Barney looked at her very sadly.\nMary even thought she saw him wink his eyes as if to wink\ntears away.",
        "“Poor little kid!” he said.  “There is nobody left to come.”",
        "It was in that strange and sudden way that Mary found\nout that she had neither father nor mother left;\nthat they had died and been carried away in the night,\nand that the few native servants who had not died also had\nleft the house as quickly as they could get out of it,\nnone of them even remembering that there was a Missie Sahib.\nThat was why the place was so quiet.  It was true that there\nwas no one in the bungalow but herself and the little\nrustling snake.",
