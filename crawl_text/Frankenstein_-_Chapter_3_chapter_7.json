        "When I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that I\nshould become a student at the university of Ingolstadt.  I had\nhitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it\nnecessary for the completion of my education that I should be made\nacquainted with other customs than those of my native country.  My\ndeparture was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day\nresolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life\noccurred–an omen, as it were, of my future misery.  Elizabeth had\ncaught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was in the\ngreatest danger.  During her illness many arguments had been urged to\npersuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her.  She had at\nfirst yielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of\nher favourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. She\nattended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the\nmalignity of the distemper–Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences\nof this imprudence were fatal to her preserver.  On the third day my\nmother sickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming\nsymptoms, and the looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the\nworst event.  On her deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best\nof women did not desert her.  She joined the hands of Elizabeth and\nmyself.  “My children,” she said, “my firmest hopes of future happiness\nwere placed on the prospect of your union.  This expectation will now\nbe the consolation of your father.  Elizabeth, my love, you must supply\nmy place to my younger children.  Alas!  I regret that I am taken from\nyou; and, happy and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you\nall?  But these are not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to\nresign myself cheerfully to death and will indulge a hope of meeting\nyou in another world.”",
        "She died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death.\nI need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent\nby that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the\nsoul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance.  It is so\nlong before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day\nand whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed\nforever–that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been\nextinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear\ncan be hushed, never more to be heard.  These are the reflections of\nthe first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the\nevil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences.  Yet from whom has\nnot that rude hand rent away some dear connection?  And why should I\ndescribe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel?  The time at\nlength arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and\nthe smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a\nsacrilege, is not banished.  My mother was dead, but we had still\nduties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with the\nrest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the\nspoiler has not seized.",
        "My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events,\nwas now again determined upon.  I obtained from my father a respite of\nsome weeks.  It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose,\nakin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of\nlife.  I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me.  I was\nunwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me, and above\nall, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled.",
        "She indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all.\nShe looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and\nzeal.  She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call\nher uncle and cousins.  Never was she so enchanting as at this time,\nwhen she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us.\nShe forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.",
        "The day of my departure at length arrived.  Clerval spent the last\nevening with us.  He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit\nhim to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain.  His\nfather was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the\naspirations and ambition of his son.  Henry deeply felt the misfortune\nof being debarred from a liberal education.  He said little, but when\nhe spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a\nrestrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details\nof commerce.",
        "We sat late.  We could not tear ourselves away from each other nor\npersuade ourselves to say the word “Farewell!”  It was said, and we\nretired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the\nother was deceived; but when at morning’s dawn I descended to the\ncarriage which was to convey me away, they were all there–my father\nagain to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to\nrenew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the last\nfeminine attentions on her playmate and friend.",
        "I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged\nin the most melancholy reflections.  I, who had ever been surrounded by\namiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow\nmutual pleasure–I was now alone.  In the university whither I was\ngoing I must form my own friends and be my own protector.  My life had\nhitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me\ninvincible repugnance to new countenances.  I loved my brothers,\nElizabeth, and Clerval; these were “old familiar faces,” but I believed\nmyself totally unfitted for the company of strangers.  Such were my\nreflections as I commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits\nand hopes rose.  I ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge.  I\nhad often, when at home, thought it hard to remain during my youth\ncooped up in one place and had longed to enter the world and take my\nstation among other human beings.  Now my desires were complied with,\nand it would, indeed, have been folly to repent.",
        "I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my\njourney to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing.  At length the\nhigh white steeple of the town met my eyes.  I alighted and was\nconducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased.",
        "The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a\nvisit to some of the principal professors.  Chance–or rather the evil\ninfluence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway\nover me from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father’s\ndoor–led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy.  He\nwas an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science. He\nasked me several questions concerning my progress in the different\nbranches of science appertaining to natural philosophy.  I replied\ncarelessly, and partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my\nalchemists as the principal authors I had studied.  The professor\nstared.  “Have you,” he said, “really spent your time in studying such\nnonsense?”",
        "I replied in the affirmative.  “Every minute,” continued M. Krempe with\nwarmth, “every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly\nand entirely lost.  You have burdened your memory with exploded systems\nand useless names.  Good God!  In what desert land have you lived,\nwhere no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you\nhave so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they\nare ancient?  I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific\nage, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus.  My dear\nsir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.”",
        "So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books\ntreating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and\ndismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following\nweek he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural\nphilosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow\nprofessor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he\nomitted.",
        "I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long\nconsidered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I\nreturned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any\nshape.  M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a\nrepulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in\nfavour of his pursuits.  In rather a too philosophical and connected a\nstrain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come\nto concerning them in my early years.  As a child I had not been\ncontent with the results promised by the modern professors of natural\nscience.  With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my\nextreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the\nsteps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the\ndiscoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten\nalchemists.  Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural\nphilosophy.  It was very different when the masters of the science\nsought immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand;\nbut now the scene was changed.  The ambition of the inquirer seemed to\nlimit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest\nin science was chiefly founded.  I was required to exchange chimeras of\nboundless grandeur for realities of little worth.",
        "Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my\nresidence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming\nacquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new\nabode.  But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information\nwhich M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures.  And although I\ncould not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver\nsentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M.\nWaldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.",
        "Partly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the\nlecturing room, which M. Waldman entered shortly after.  This professor\nwas very unlike his colleague.  He appeared about fifty years of age,\nbut with an aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey\nhairs covered his temples, but those at the back of his head were\nnearly black.  His person was short but remarkably erect and his voice\nthe sweetest I had ever heard.  He began his lecture by a\nrecapitulation of the history of chemistry and the various improvements\nmade by different men of learning, pronouncing with fervour the names\nof the most distinguished discoverers.  He then took a cursory view of\nthe present state of the science and explained many of its elementary\nterms.  After having made a few preparatory experiments, he concluded\nwith a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I shall\nnever forget:  “The ancient teachers of this science,” said he,\n“promised impossibilities and performed nothing.  The modern masters\npromise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and\nthat the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose\nhands seem only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the\nmicroscope or crucible, have indeed performed miracles.  They penetrate\ninto the recesses of nature and show how she works in her\nhiding-places.  They ascend into the heavens; they have discovered how\nthe blood circulates, and the nature of the air we breathe.  They have\nacquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can command the thunders\nof heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the invisible world with\nits own shadows.”",
        "Such were the professor’s words–rather let me say such the words of\nthe fate–enounced to destroy me.  As he went on I felt as if my soul\nwere grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were\ntouched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was\nsounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception,\none purpose.  So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of\nFrankenstein–more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps\nalready marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and\nunfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.",
        "I closed not my eyes that night.  My internal being was in a state of\ninsurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I\nhad no power to produce it.  By degrees, after the morning’s dawn,\nsleep came.  I awoke, and my yesternight’s thoughts were as a dream. \nThere only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to\ndevote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a\nnatural talent.  On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit.  His\nmanners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public,\nfor there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in\nhis own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness.  I\ngave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had\ngiven to his fellow professor.  He heard with attention the little\nnarration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius\nAgrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had\nexhibited. He said that “These were men to whose indefatigable zeal\nmodern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their\nknowledge.  They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names\nand arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a\ngreat degree had been the instruments of bringing to light.  The\nlabours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever\nfail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.”  I\nlistened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption\nor affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my\nprejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured\nterms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his\ninstructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have\nmade me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended\nlabours.  I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to\nprocure.",
        "“I am happy,” said M. Waldman, “to have gained a disciple; and if your\napplication equals your ability, I have no doubt of your success.\nChemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest\nimprovements have been and may be made; it is on that account that I\nhave made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not\nneglected the other branches of science.  A man would make but a very\nsorry chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge\nalone.  If your wish is to become really a man of science and not\nmerely a petty experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every\nbranch of natural philosophy, including mathematics.”  He then took me\ninto his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his various\nmachines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and promising me\nthe use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in the\nscience not to derange their mechanism.  He also gave me the list of\nbooks which I had requested, and I took my leave.",
        "Thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.",
