        "The United States of America has been from the beginning in a\nperpetual change. The physical and mental restlessness of the\nAmerican and the temporary nature of many of his arrangements\nare largely due to the experimental character of the exploration\nand development of this continent. The new energies released by\nthe settlement of the colonies were indeed guided by stern\ndetermination, wise forethought, and inventive skill; but no one\nhas ever really known the outcome of the experiment. It is a\nstory of faith, of",
        "   Effort, and expectation, and desire,\n   And something evermore about to be.",
        "An Alexander Hamilton may urge with passionate force the adoption\nof the Constitution, without any firm conviction as to its\npermanence. The most clear-sighted American of the Civil War\nperiod recognized this element of uncertainty in our American\nadventure when he declared: “We are now testing whether this\nnation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long\nendure.” More than fifty years have passed since that war rearmed\nthe binding force of the Constitution and apparently sealed the\nperpetuity of the Union. Yet the gigantic economic and social\nchanges now in progress are serving to show that the United\nStates has its full share of the anxieties which beset all human\ninstitutions in this daily altering world.",
        "“We are but strangers in an inn, but passengers in a ship,” said\nRoger Williams. This sense of the transiency of human effort, the\nperishable nature of human institutions, was quick in the\nconsciousness of the gentleman adventurers and sober Puritan\ncitizens who emigrated from England to the New World. It had been\na familiar note in the poetry of that Elizabethan period which\nhad followed with such breathless interest the exploration of\nAmerica. It was a conception which could be shared alike by a\nsaint like John Cotton or a soldier of fortune like John Smith.\nMen are tent-dwellers. Today they settle here, and tomorrow they\nhave struck camp and are gone. We are strangers and sojourners,\nas all our fathers were.",
        "This instinct of the camper has stamped itself upon American life\nand thought. Venturesomeness, physical and moral daring,\nresourcefulness in emergencies, indifference to negligible\ndetails, wastefulness of materials, boundless hope and confidence\nin the morrow, are characteristics of the American. It is\nscarcely an exaggeration to say that the “good American” has been\nhe who has most resembled a good camper. He has had robust\nhealth–unless or until he has abused it,–a tolerant\ndisposition, and an ability to apply his fingers or his brain to\nmany unrelated and unexpected tasks. He is disposed to blaze his\nown trail. He has a touch of prodigality, and, withal, a knack of\nkeeping his tent or his affairs in better order than they seem.\nAbove all, he has been ever ready to break camp when he feels the\nimpulse to wander. He likes to be “foot-loose.” If he does not\nbuild his roads as solidly as the Roman roads were built, nor his\nhouses like the English houses, it is because he feels that he is\nhere today and gone tomorrow. If he has squandered the physical\nresources of his neighborhood, cutting the forests recklessly,\nexhausting the soil, surrendering water power and minerals into a\nfew far-clutching fingers, he has done it because he expects,\nlike Voltaire’s Signor Pococurante, “to have a new garden\ntomorrow, built on a nobler plan.” When New York State grew too\ncrowded for Cooper’s Leather-Stocking, he shouldered his pack,\nwhistled to his dog, glanced at the sun, and struck a bee-line\nfor the Mississippi. Nothing could be more typical of the first\nthree hundred years of American history.",
        "The traits of the pioneer have thus been the characteristic\ntraits of the American in action. The memories of successive\ngenerations have tended to stress these qualities to the neglect\nof others. Everyone who has enjoyed the free life of the woods\nwill confess that his own judgment upon his casual summer\nassociates turns, quite naturally and almost exclusively, upon\ntheir characteristics as woodsmen. Out of the woods, these\ngentlemen may be more or less admirable divines, pedants, men of\naffairs; but the verdict of their companions in the forest is\nbased chiefly upon the single question of their adaptability to\nthe environment of the camp. Are they quick of eye and foot,\nskillful with rod and gun, cheerful on rainy days, ready to do a\nlittle more than their share of drudgery? If so, memory holds\nthem.",
        "Some such unconscious selection as this has been at work in the\nclassification of our representative men. The building of the\nnation and the literary expression of its purpose and ideals are\ntasks which have called forth the strength of a great variety of\nindividuals. Some of these men have proved to be peculiarly\nfitted for a specific service, irrespective of the question of\ntheir general intellectual powers, or their rank as judged by the\nstandard of European performance in the same field. Thus the\nbattle of New Orleans, in European eyes a mere bit of frontier\nfighting, made Andrew Jackson a “hero” as indubitably as if he\nhad defeated Napoleon at Waterloo. It gave him the Presidency.",
        "The analogy holds in literature. Certain expressions of American\nsentiment or conviction have served to summarize or to clarify\nthe spirit of the nation. The authors of these productions have\nfrequently won the recognition and affection of their\ncontemporaries by means of prose and verse quite unsuited to\nsustain the test of severe critical standards. Neither\nLongfellow’s “Excelsior” nor Poe’s “Bells” nor Whittier’s “Maud\nMuller” is among the best poems of the three writers in question,\nyet there was something in each of these productions which caught\nthe fancy of a whole American generation. It expressed one phase\nof the national mind in a given historical period.",
        "The historian of literature is bound to take account of this\nquestion of literary vogue, as it is highly significant of the\ntemper of successive generations in any country. But it is of\npeculiar interest to the student of the literature produced in\nthe United States. Is this literature “American,” or is it\n\"English literature in America,” as Professor Wendell and other\nscholars have preferred to call it? I should be one of the last\nto minimize the enormous influence of England upon the mind and\nthe writing of all the English-speaking countries of the globe.\nYet it will be one of the purposes of the present book to\nindicate the existence here, even in colonial times, of a point\nof view differing from that of the mother country, and destined\nto differ increasingly with the lapse of time. Since the\nformation of our Federal Union, in particular, the books produced\nin the United States have tended to exhibit certain\ncharacteristics which differentiate them from the books produced\nin other English speaking countries. We must beware, of course,\nof what the late Charles Francis Adams once called the\n\"filiopietistic” fallacy. The “American” qualities of our\nliterature must be judged in connection with its conformity to\nuniversal standards of excellence. Tested by any universal\nstandard, “The Scarlet Letter” is a notable romance. It has won a\nsecure place among the literature written by men of English blood\nand speech. Yet to overlook the peculiarly local or provincial\ncharacteristics of this remarkable story is to miss the secret of\nits inspiration. It could have been written only by a New\nEnglander, in the atmosphere of a certain epoch.",
        "Our task, then, in this rapid review of the chief interpreters of\nthe American spirit in literature, is a twofold one. We are\nprimarily concerned with a procession of men, each of whom is\ninteresting as an individual and as a writer. But we cannot watch\nthe individuals long without perceiving the general direction of\ntheir march, the ideas that animate them, the common hopes and\nloyalties that make up the life of their spirit. To become aware\nof these general tendencies is to understand the “American” note\nin our national writing.",
        "Our historians have taught us that the history of the United\nStates is an evolution towards political unity. The separatist,\nparticularist movements are gradually thrust to one side. In\nliterary history, likewise, we best remember those authors who\nfall into line with what we now perceive to have been the course\nof our literary development. The erratic men and women, the\n\"sports” of the great experiment, are ultimately neglected by the\ncritics, unless, like the leaders of political insurrections,\nthose writing men and women have raised a notable standard of\nrevolt. No doubt the apparently unique literary specimens, if\nclearly understood in their origins and surroundings, would be\nfound rooted in the general laws of literary evolution. But these\nlaws are not easy to codify and we must avoid the temptation to\ndiscover, in any particular period, more of unity than there\nactually was. And we must always remember that there will be\nbeautiful prose and verse unrelated to the main national\ntendencies save as “the literature of escape.” We owe this lesson\nto the genius of Edgar Allan Poe.",
        "Let us test these principles by applying them to the earliest\ncolonists. The first book written on the soil of what is now the\nUnited States was Captain John Smith’s “True Relation” of the\nplanting of the Virginia colony in 1607. It was published in\nLondon in 1608. The Captain was a typical Elizabethan adventurer,\nwith a gift, like so many of his class, for picturesque\nnarrative. In what sense, if at all, may his writings on American\ntopics be classified as “American” literary productions? It is\nclear that his experiences in the New World were only one phase\nof the variegated life of this English soldier of fortune. But\nthe American imagination has persistently claimed him as\nrepresenting something peculiarly ours, namely, a kind of pioneer\nhardihood, resourcefulness, leadership, which was essential to\nthe exploration and conquest of the wilderness. Most of Smith’s\ncompanions were unfitted for the ordeal which he survived. They\nperished miserably in the “starving time.” But he was of the\nstuff from which triumphant immigrants have ever been made, and\nit is our recognition of the presence of these qualities in the\nCaptain which makes us think of his books dealing with America as\nif they were “American books.” There are other narratives by\ncolonists temporarily residing in the Virginia plantations which\ngratify our historical curiosity, but which we no more consider a\npart of American literature than the books written by Stevenson,\nKipling, and Wells during their casual visits to this country.\nBut Captain Smith’s “True Relation” impresses us, like Mark\nTwain’s “Roughing It,” with being somehow true to type. In each\nof these books the possible unveracities in detail are a\nconfirmation of their representative American character.",
        "In other words, we have unconsciously formulated, in the course\nof centuries, a general concept of “the pioneer.” Novelists,\npoets, and historians have elaborated this conception. Nothing is\nmore inevitable than our reaching back to the beginning of the\nseventeenth century and endeavoring to select, among the\nthousands of Englishmen who emigrated or even thought of\nemigrating to this country, those who possessed the genuine heart\nand sinew of the permanent settler.",
        "Oliver Cromwell, for instance, is said to have thought of\nemigrating hither in 1637. If he had joined his friends John\nCotton and Roger Williams in New England, who can doubt that the\npersonal characteristics of “my brave Oliver” would today be\nidentified with the “American” qualities which we discover in\n1637 on the shores of Massachusetts Bay? And what an American\nsettler Cromwell would have made!",
        "If we turn from physical and moral daring to the field of\ntheological and political speculation, it is easy today to\nselect, among the writings of the earliest colonists, certain\nradical utterances which seem to presage the very temper of the\nlate eighteenth century. Pastor John Robinson’s farewell address\nto the Pilgrims at Leyden in 1620 contained the famous words:\n\"The Lord has more truth yet to break forth out of His holy Word.\nI cannot sufficiently bewail the condition of the reformed\nchurches, who are come to a period in religion. . . . Luther and\nCalvin were great and shining lights in their times, yet they\npenetrated not into the whole counsel of God.” Now John Robinson,\nlike Oliver Cromwell, never set foot on American soil, but he is\nidentified, none the less, with the spirit of American liberalism\nin religion.",
        "In political discussion, the early emergence of that type of\nindependence familiar to the decade 1765-75 is equally striking.\nIn a letter written in 1818, John Adams insisted that “the\nprinciples and feelings which produced the Revolution ought to be\ntraced back for two hundred years, and sought in the history of\nthe country from the first plantations in America.” “I have\nalways laughed,” he declared in an earlier letter, “at the\naffectation of representing American independence as a novel\nidea, as a modern discovery, as a late invention. The idea of it\nas a possible thing, as a probable event, nay as a necessary and\nunavoidable measure, in case Great Britain should assume an\nunconstitutional authority over us, has been familiar to\nAmericans from the first settlement of the country.”",
        "There is, then, a predisposition, a latent or potential\nAmericanism which existed long before the United States came into\nbeing. Now that our political unity has become a fact, the\npredisposition is certain to be regarded by our own and by future\ngenerations as evidence of a state of mind which made our\nseparate national life inevitable. Yet to Thomas Hutchinson, a\nsound historian and honest man, the last Royal Governor of\nMassachusetts, a separate national life seemed in 1770 an\nunspeakable error and calamity.",
        "The seventeenth-century colonists were predominantly English, in\nblood, in traditions, and in impulses. Whether we look at\nVirginia or Plymouth or at the other colonies that were planted\nin swift succession along the seaboard, it is clear that we are\ndealing primarily with men of the English race. Most of them\nwould have declared, with as much emphasis as Francis Hopkinson a\ncentury later, “We of America are in all respects Englishmen.\"\nProfessor Edward Channing thinks that it took a century of\nexposure to colonial conditions to force the English in America\naway from the traditions and ideals of those who continued to\nlive in the old land. But the student of literature must keep\nconstantly in mind that these English colonizers represented no\nsingle type of the national character. There were many men of\nmany minds even within the contracted cabin of the Mayflower. The\n\"sifted wheat” was by no means all of the same variety.",
        "For Old England was never more torn by divergent thought and\nsubversive act than in the period between the death of Elizabeth\nin 1603 and the Revolution of 1688. In this distracted time who\ncould say what was really “English”? Was it James the First or\nRaleigh? Archbishop Laud or John Cotton? Charles the First or\nCromwell? Charles the Second or William Penn? Was it Churchman,\nPresbyterian, Independent, Separatist, Quaker? One is tempted to\nsay that the title of Ben Jonson’s comedy “Every Man in his\nHumour” became the standard of action for two whole generations\nof Englishmen, and that there is no common denominator for\nemigrants of such varied pattern as Smith and Sandys of Virginia,\nMorton of Merrymount, John Winthrop, “Sir” Christopher Gardiner\nand Anne Hutchinson of Boston, and Roger Williams of Providence.\nThey seem as miscellaneous as “Kitchener’s Army.”",
        "It is true that we can make certain distinctions. Virginia, as\nhas often been said, was more like a continuation of English\nsociety, while New England represented a digression from English\nsociety. There were then, as now, “stand-patters” and\n\"progressives.” It was the second class who, while retaining very\nconservative notions about property, developed a fearless\nintellectual radicalism which has written itself into the history\nof the United States. But to the student of early American\nliterature all such generalizations are of limited value. He is\ndealing with individual men, not with “Cavalier” or “Roundhead\"\nas such. He has learned from recent historians to distrust any\nsuch facile classification of the first colonists. He knows by\nthis time that there were aristocrats in Massachusetts and\ncommoners in Virginia; that the Pilgrims of Plymouth were more\ntolerant than the Puritans of Boston, and that Rhode Island was\nmore tolerant than either. Yet useful as these general\nstatements may be, the interpreter of men of letters must always\ngo back of the racial type or the social system to the individual\nperson. He recognizes, as a truth for him, that theory of\ncreative evolution which holds that in the ascending progress of\nthe race each thinking person becomes a species by himself.",
        "While something is gained, then, by remembering that the racial\ninstincts and traditions of the first colonists were\noverwhelmingly English, and that their political and ethical\nviews were the product of a turbulent and distraught time, it is\neven more important to note how the physical situation of the\ncolonists affected their intellectual and moral, as well as their\npolitical problems. Among the emigrants from England, as we have\nseen, there were great varieties of social status, religious\nopinion, individual motive. But at least they all possessed the\nphysical courage and moral hardihood to risk the dangerous\nvoyage, the fearful hardships, and the vast uncertainties of the\nnew life. To go out at all, under the pressure of any motive, was\nto meet triumphantly a searching test. It was in truth a\n\"sifting,” and though a few picturesque rascals had the courage\nto go into exile while a few saints may have been deterred, it is\na truism to say that the pioneers were made up of brave men and\nbraver women.",
        "It cannot be asserted that their courage was the result of any\nsingle, dominating motive, equally operative in all of the\ncolonies. Mrs. Hemans’s familiar line about seeking “freedom to\nworship God” was measurably true of the Pilgrims of Plymouth,\nabout whom she was writing. But the far more important Puritan\nemigration to Massachusetts under Winthrop aimed not so much at\n\"freedom” as at the establishment of a theocracy according to the\nScriptures. These men straightway denied freedom of worship, not\nonly to newcomers who sought to join them, but to those members\nof their own company who developed independent ways of thinking.\nThe list of motives for emigration ran the whole gamut, from\nmissionary fervor for converting the savages, down through a\ncommendable desire for gain, to the perhaps no less praiseworthy\nwish to escape a debtor’s prison or the pillory. A few of the\ncolonists were rich. Some were beggars or indentured servants.\nMost of them belonged to the middle class. John Harvard was the\nson of a butcher; Thomas Shepard, the son of a grocer; Roger\nWilliams, the son of a tailor. But all three were university bred\nand were natural leaders of men.",
        "Once arrived in the wilderness, the pioneer life common to all of\nthe colonists began instantly to exert its slow, irresistible\npressure upon their minds and to mould them into certain ways of\nthinking and feeling. Without some perception of these modes of\nthought and emotion a knowledge of the spirit of our literature\nis impossible. Take, for instance, the mere physical situation of\nthe first colonists, encamped on the very beach of the wide ocean\nwith an illimitable forest in their rear. Their provisions were\nscanty. They grew watchful of the strange soil, of the new skies,\nof the unknown climate. Even upon the voyage over, John Winthrop\nthought that “the declination of the pole star was much, even to\nthe view, beneath that it is in England,” and that “the new moon,\nwhen it first appeared, was much smaller than at any time he had\nseen it in England.” Here was a man evidently using his eyes with\na new interest in natural phenomena. Under these changed skies\nthe mind began gradually to change also.",
        "At first the colonists felt themselves an outpost of Europe, a\nforlorn hope of the Protestant Reformation. “We shall be as a\ncity upon a hill,” said Winthrop. “The eyes of all people are\nupon us.” Their creed was Calvinism, then in its third generation\nof dominion and a European doctrine which was not merely\ntheological but social and political. The emigrant Englishmen\nwere soon to discover that it contained a doctrine of human\nrights based upon human needs. At the beginning of their novel\nexperience they were doubtless unaware of any alteration in their\ntheories. But they were facing a new situation, and that new\nsituation became an immense factor in their unconscious growth.\nTheir intellectual and moral problems shifted, as a boat shifts\nher ballast when the wind blows from a new quarter. The John\nCotton preaching in a shed in the new Boston had come to “suffer\na sea-change” from the John Cotton who had been rector of St.\nBotolph’s splendid church in Lincolnshire. The “church without a\nbishop” and the “state without a king” became a different church\nand state from the old, however loyally the ancient forms and\nphrases were retained.",
        "If the political problems of equality which were latent in\nCalvinism now began to take on a different meaning under the\ndemocratic conditions of pioneer life, the inner, spiritual\nproblems of that amazing creed were intensified. “Fallen” human\nnature remained the same, whether in the crowded cosmopolitan\nstreets of Holland and London, or upon the desolate shores of\nCape Cod. But the moral strain of the old insoluble conflict\nbetween “fixed fate” and “free will” was heightened by the\nphysical loneliness of the colonists. Each soul must fight its\nown unaided, unending battle. In that moral solitude, as in the\nphysical solitude of the settlers upon the far northwestern\nprairies of a later epoch, many a mind snapped. Unnatural tension\nwas succeeded by unnatural crimes. But for the stronger\nintellects New England Calvinism became a potent spiritual\ngymnastic, where, as in the Swedish system of bodily training,\none lifts imaginary and ever-increasing weights with imaginary\nand ever-increasing effort, flexor and extensor muscles pulling\nagainst one another, driven by the will. Calvinism bred athletes\nas well as maniacs.",
        "The new situation, again, turned many of the theoretical\nspeculations of the colonists into practical issues. Here, for\nexample, was the Indian. Was he truly a child of God, possessing\na soul, and, if so, had he partaken of the sin of Adam? These\nquestions perplexed the saintly Eliot and the generous Roger\nWilliams. But before many years the query as to whether a Pequot\nwarrior had a soul became suddenly less important than the\npractical question as to whether the Pequot should be allowed any\nfurther chances of taking the white man’s scalp. On this last\nissue the colonists were unanimous in the negative.",
        "It would be easy to multiply such instances of a gradual change\nof view. But beneath all the changes and all the varieties of\nindividual behavior in the various colonies that began to dot the\nseaboard, certain qualities demanded by the new surroundings are\nfelt in colonial life and in colonial writings. One of these is\nthe instinct for order, or at least that degree of order\nessential to the existence of a camp. It was not in vain that\nJohn Smith sought to correct the early laxness at Jamestown by\nthe stern edict: “He that will not work, neither shall he eat.\"\nDutch and Quaker colonies taught the same inexorable maxim of\nthrift. Soon there was work enough for all, at good wages, but\nthe lesson had been taught. It gave Franklin’s “Poor Richard\"\nmottoes their flavor of homely, experienced truth.",
        "Order in daily life led straight to political order, just as the\nequality and resourcefulness of the frontier, stimulated by\nisolation from Europe, led to political independence. The pioneer\nlearned to make things for himself instead of sending to London\nfor them, and by and by he grew as impatient of waiting for a\npolitical edict from London as he would become in waiting for a\nLondon plough. “This year,” wrote one colonist, “ye will go to\ncomplain to the Parliament, and the next year they will send to\nsee how it is, and the third year the government is changed.” The\ntime was coming when no more complaints would be sent.",
        "One of the most startling instances of this colonial instinct for\nself-government is the case of Thomas Hooker. Trained in Emmanuel\nCollege of the old Cambridge, he arrived in the new Cambridge in\n1633. He grew restless under its theocratic government, being, it\nwas said, “a person who when he was doing his Master’s work,\nwould put a king into his pocket.” So he led the famous migration\nof 1636 from Massachusetts to Hartford, and there helped to\ncreate a federation of independent towns which made their own\nconstitution without mentioning any king, and became one of the\ncorner-stones of American democracy. In May, 1638, Hooker\ndeclared in a sermon before the General Court “that the choice of\npublic magistrates belongs unto the people by God’s own\nallowance,” and “that they who have the power to appoint officers\nand magistrates, it is in their power, also, to set the bounds\nand limitations of the power and place into which they call\nthem.” The reason of this is: “Because the foundation of\nauthority is laid, firstly, in the free consent of the people.\"\nThis high discourse antedates the famous pamphlets on liberty by\nMilton. It is a half-century earlier than Locke’s “Treatise on\nGovernment,” a century and a quarter earlier than Rousseau’s\n\"Contrat Social,” and it precedes by one hundred and thirty-eight\nyears the American Declaration of Independence.",
        "But the slightest acquaintance with colonial writings will reveal\nthe fact that such political radicalism as Thomas Hooker’s was\naccompanied by an equally striking conservatism in other\ndirections. One of these conservative traits was the pioneer’s\nrespect for property, and particularly for the land cleared by\nhis own toil. Gladstone once spoke of possession of the soil as\nthe most important and most operative of all social facts.\nFree-footed as the pioneer colonist was, he was disinclined to\npart with his land without a substantial price for it. The land\nat his disposal was practically illimitable, but he showed a very\nEnglish tenacity in safeguarding his hold upon his own portion.",
        "Very English, likewise, was his attachment to the old country as\n\"home.” The lighter and the more serious writings of the\ncolonists are alike in their respect for the past. In the New\nEngland settlements, although not at first in Virginia, there was\nrespect for learning and for an educated clergy. The colonists\nrevered the Bible. They maintained a stubborn regard for the\nCommon Law of England. Even amid all the excitement of a\nsuccessful rebellion from the mother country, this Common Law\nstill held the Americans to the experience of the inescapable\npast.",
        "Indeed, as the reader of today lifts his eyes from the pages of\nthe books written in America during the seventeenth century, and\ntries to meditate upon the general difference between them and\nthe English books written during the same period, he will be\naware of the firmness with which the conservative forces held on\nthis side of the Atlantic. It was only one hundred years from the\nGreat Armada of 1588 to the flight of James Second, the last of\nthe Stuart Kings. With that Revolution of 1688 the struggles\ncharacteristic of the seventeenth century in England came to an\nend. A new working basis is found for thought, politics, society,\nliterature. But while those vast changes had been shaking\nEngland, two generations of American colonists had cleared their\nforests, fought the savages, organized their townships and their\ntrade, put money in their purses, and lived, though as yet hardly\nsuspecting it, a life that was beginning to differentiate them\nfrom the men of the Old World. We must now glance at the various\naspects of this isolated life of theirs, as it is revealed in\ntheir books.",
        "The simplest and oldest group of colonial writings is made up of\nrecords of exploration and adventure. They are like the letters\nwritten from California in 1849 to the “folks back East.\"\nAddressed to home-keeping Englishmen across the sea, they\ndescribe the new world, explain the present situation of the\ncolonists, and express their hopes for the future. Captain John\nSmith’s “True Relation,” already alluded to, is the typical\nproduction of this class: a swift marching book, full of eager\nenergy, of bluff and breezy picturesqueness, and of triumphant\ninstinct for the main chance. Like most of the Elizabethans, he\ncannot help poetizing in his prose. Codfishing is to him a\n\"sport\"; “and what sport doth yeald a more pleasing content, and\nlesse hurt or charge then angling with a hooke, and crossing the\nsweete ayre from Isle to Isle, over the silent streams of a calme\nSea?” But the gallant Captain is also capable of very plain\nspeech, Cromwellian in its simplicity, as when he writes back to\nthe London stockholders of the Virginia Company: “When you send\nagain, I entreat you rather send but thirty carpenters,\nhusbandmen, gardeners, fishermen, blacksmiths, masons, and\ndiggers up of trees’ roots, well provided, than a thousand of\nsuch as we have.”",
        "America was but an episode in the wide wanderings of Captain\nSmith, but he owes his place in human memory today to the\nphysical and mental energy with which he met the demands of a new\nsituation, and to the vividness with which he dashed down in\nwords whatever his eyes had seen. Whether, in that agreeable\npassage about Pocahontas, he was guilty of romancing a little, no\none really knows, but the Captain, as the first teller of this\npeculiarly American type of story, will continue to have an\nindulgent audience.",
        "But other exiles in Virginia were skillful with the pen. William\nStrachey’s “True Reportory of the Wrack of Sir Thomas Gates, Kt.,\nvpon and from the islands of the Bermudas” may or may not have\ngiven a hint to Shakespeare for the storm-scene in “The Tempest.\"\nIn either case it is admirable writing, flexible, sensitive,\nshrewdly observant. Whitaker, the apostle of Virginia, mingles,\nlike many a missionary of the present day, the style of an\nexhorter with a keen discernment of the traits of the savage\nmind. George Percy, fresh from Northumberland, tells in a\nlanguage as simple as Defoe’s the piteous tale of five months of\nillness and starvation, watched by “those wild and cruel Pagans.\"\nJohn Pory, of “the strong potations,” who thinks that “good\ncompany is the soul of this life,” nevertheless comforts himself\nin his solitude among the “crystal rivers and odoriferous woods\"\nby reflecting that he is escaping envy and expense. George\nSandys, scholar and poet, finds his solace during a Virginia\nexile in continuing his translation of Ovid’s “Metamorphoses.\"\nColonel Norwood, an adventurer who belongs to a somewhat later\nday, since he speaks of having “read Mr. Smith’s travels,” draws\nthe long bow of narrative quite as powerfully as the redoubtable\nSmith, and far more smoothly, as witness his accounts of\nstarvation on shipboard and cannibalism on shore. This Colonel is\nan artist who would have delighted Stevenson.",
        "All of these early tellers of Virginia tales were Englishmen, and\nmost of them returned to England, where their books were printed\nand their remaining lives were passed. But far to the north east\nof Virginia there were two colonies of men who earned the right\nto say, in William Bradford’s quiet words, “It is not with us as\nwith other men, whom small things can discourage, or small\ndiscontentments cause to wish themselves at home again.” One was\nthe colony of Pilgrims at Plymouth, headed by Bradford himself.\nThe other was the Puritan colony of Massachusetts Bay, with John\nWinthrop as governor.",
        "Bradford and Winthrop have left journals which are more than\nchronicles of adventure. They record the growth and government of\na commonwealth. Both Bradford and Winthrop were natural leaders\nof men, grave, dignified, solid, endowed with a spirit that bred\nconfidence. Each was learned. Winthrop, a lawyer and man of\nproperty, had a higher social standing than Bradford, who was one\nof the Separatists of Robinson’s flock at Leyden. But the Pilgrim\nof the Mayflower and the well-to-do Puritan of the Bay Colony\nboth wrote their annals like gentlemen and scholars. Bradford’s\n\"History of Plymouth Plantation” runs from 1620 to 1647.\nWinthrop’s diary, now printed as the “History of New England,\"\nbegins with his voyage in 1630 and closes in the year of his\ndeath, 1649. As records of an Anglo-Saxon experiment in\nself-government under pioneer conditions these books are\npriceless; as human documents, they illuminate the Puritan\ncharacter; as for “literary\" value in the narrow sense of that\nword, neither Bradford nor Winthrop seems to have thought of\nliterary effect. Yet the leader of the Pilgrims has passages of\ngrave sweetness and charm, and his sketch of his associate, Elder\nBrewster, will bear comparison with the best English biographical\nwriting of that century. Winthrop is perhaps more varied in tone,\nas he is in matter, but he writes throughout as a ruler of men\nshould write, with “decent plainness and manly freedom.” His best\nknown pages, justly praised by Tyler and other historians of\nAmerican thought, contain his speech before the General Court in\n1645 on the nature of true liberty. No paragraphs written in\nAmerica previous to the Revolution would have given more pleasure\nto Abraham Lincoln, but it is to be feared that Lincoln never saw\nGovernor Winthrop’s book, though his own ancestor, Samuel Lincoln\nof Hingham, lived under Winthrop’s jurisdiction.",
        "The theory of government held by the dominant party of the first\ntwo generations of New England pioneers has often been called a\n\"theocracy,” that is to say, a government according to the Word\nof God as expounded and enforced by the clergy. The experiment\nwas\ndoomed to ultimate failure, for it ran counter to some of the\nnoblest instincts of human nature. But its administration was in\nthe hands of able men. The power of the clergy was well-nigh\nabsolute. The political organization of the township depended\nupon the ecclesiastical organization as long as the right to vote\nwas confined to church members. How sacrosanct and awful was the\nposition of the clergyman may be perceived from Hawthorne’s “The\nMinister’s Black Veil” and “The Scarlet Letter.”",
        "Yet it must be said that men like Hooker and Cotton, Shepard and\nNorton, had every instinct and capacity for leadership. With the\nnotable exception of Hooker, such men were aristocrats, holding\nJohn Winthrop’s opinion that “Democracy is, among most civil\nnations, accounted the meanest and worst form of government.\"\nThey were fiercely intolerant. The precise reason for the Hooker\nmigration from Cambridge to Hartford in 1636–the very year of\nthe founding of Harvard–was prudently withheld, but it is now\nthought to be the instinct of escape from the clerical architects\nof the Cambridge Platform. Yet no one would today call Thomas\nHooker a liberal in religion, pioneer in political liberty though\nhe proved to be. His extant sermons have the steady stroke of a\ngreat hammer; smiting at the mind and heart. “Others because they\nhave felt the heavy hand of God . . . upon these grounds they\nbuild their hopes: ’I have had my hell in this life, and I hope\nto have heaven in the world to come; I hope the worst is over.’\"\nNot so, thunders the preacher in reply: “Sodom and Gomorrah they\nburnt in brimstone and they shall burn in hell.” One of Hooker’s\nsuccessors has called him “a son of thunder and a son of\nconsolation by turns.” The same may be said of Thomas Shepard,\nanother graduate of Emmanuel College in the old Cambridge, who\nbecame the “soul-melting preacher” of the newer Cambridge by the\nCharles. Pure, ravishing notes of spiritual devotion still sing\nthemselves in his pages. He is wholly Calvinist. He thinks “the\ntruth is a poor mean thing in itself” and that the human reason\ncannot be “the last resolution of all doubts,” which must be\nsought only in the written Word of God. He holds it “a tough\nwork, a wonderful hard matter to be saved.” “Jesus Christ is not\ngot with a wet finger.” Yet, like so many mystics, he yearns to\nbe “covered with God, as with a cloud,” to be “drowned, plunged,\nand swallowed up with God.” One hundred years later we shall find\nthis same rhapsodic ecstasy in the meditations of Jonathan\nEdwards.",
        "John Cotton, the third of the mighty men in the early Colonial\npulpit, owes his fame more to his social and political influence\nthan to his literary power. Yet even that was thought commanding.\nTrained, like Hooker and Shepard, at Emmanuel College, and fresh\nfrom the rectorship of St. Botolph’s in the Lincolnshire Boston,\nJohn Cotton dominated that new Boston which was named in his\nhonor. He became the Pope of the theocracy; a clever Pope and not\nan unkindly one. He seems to have shared some of the opinions of\nAnne Hutchinson, though he “pronounced the sentence of\nadmonition” against her, says Winthrop, with much zeal and\ndetestation of her errors. Hawthorne, in one of his ironic moods,\nmight have done justice to this scene. Cotton was at heart too\nliberal for his role of Primate, and fate led him to persecute a\nman whose very name has become a symbol of victorious tolerance,\nRoger Williams.",
        "Williams, known today as a friend of Cromwell, Milton, and Sir\nHarry Vane, had been exiled from Massachusetts for maintaining\nthat the civil power had no jurisdiction over conscience. This\ndoctrine was fatal to the existence of a theocratic state\ndominated by the church. John Cotton was perfectly logical in\n\"enlarging” Roger Williams into the wilderness, but he showed\nless than his usual discretion in attacking the quick-tempered\nWelshman in pamphlets. It was like asking Hotspur if he would\nkindly consent to fight. Back and forth the books fly, for\nWilliams loves this game. His “Bloody Tenet of Persecution for\nCause of Conscience” calls forth Mr. Cotton’s “Bloody Tenet\nwashed and made white in the Blood of the Lamb;” and this in turn\nprovokes the torrential flood of Williams’s masterpiece, “The\nBloody Tenet yet more Bloody, by Mr. Cotton’s endeavor to wash it\nwhite in the Blood of the Lamb.” There is glorious writing here,\nand its effect cannot be suggested by quoting sentences. But\nthere is one sentence in a letter written by Williams in his old\nage to his fellow-townsmen of Providence which points the whole\nmoral of the terrible mistake made by the men who sought\nspiritual liberty in America for themselves, only to deny that\nsame liberty to others. “I have only one motion and petition,\"\nbegs this veteran pioneer who had forded many a swollen stream\nand built many a rude bridge in the Plantations: “it is this,\nthat after you have got over the black brook of some soul bondage\nyourselves, you tear not down the bridge after you.”",
        "It is for such wise and humane counsels as this that Roger\nWilliams is remembered. His opponents had mightier intellects\nthan his, but the world has long since decided against them.\nColonial sermon literature is read today chiefly by antiquarians\nwho have no sympathy for the creed which once gave it vitality.\nIts theology, like the theology of “Paradise Lost or the Divine\nComedy,” has sunk to the bottom of the black brook. But we cannot\njudge fairly the contemporary effect of this pulpit literature\nwithout remembering the passionate faith that made pulpit and\npews copartners in a supreme spiritual struggle. Historians\nproperly insist upon the aesthetic poverty of the New England\nPuritans; that their rule of life cut them off from an enjoyment\nof the dramatic literature of their race, then just closing its\nmost splendid epoch; that they had little poetry or music and no\narchitecture and plastic art. But we must never forget that to\nmen of their creed the Sunday sermons and the week-day “lectures\"\nserved as oratory, poetry, and drama. These outpourings of the\nmind and heart of their spiritual leaders were the very stuff of\nhuman passion in its intensest forms. Puritan churchgoers,\npassing hours upon hours every week in rapt absorption with the\nnoblest of all poetry and prose in the pages of their chief book,\nthe Bible, were at least as sensitive to the beauty of words and\nthe sweep of emotions as our contemporaries upon whose\nbook-shelves Spenser and Milton stand unread.",
        "It is only by entering into the psychology of the period that we\ncan estimate its attitude towards the poetry written by the\npioneers themselves. The “Bay Psalm Book” (1640), the first book\nprinted in the colonies, is a wretched doggerel arrangement of\nthe magnificent King James Version of the Psalms, designed to be\nsung in churches. Few of the New England churches could sing more\nthan half-a-dozen tunes, and a pitch-pipe was for a long time the\nonly musical instrument allowed. Judged as hymnology or poetry,\nthe Bay “Psalm Book” provokes a smile. But the men and women who\nused it as a handbook of devotion sang it with their hearts\naflame. In judging such a popular seventeenth-century poem as\nWigglesworth’s “Day of Doom” one must strip oneself quite free\nfrom the twentieth century, and pretend to be sitting in the\nchimney-corner of a Puritan kitchen, reading aloud by that\nfirelight which, as Lowell once humorously suggested, may have\nadded a “livelier relish” to the poet’s “premonitions of eternal\ncombustion.” Lowell could afford to laugh about it, having\ncrossed that particular black brook. But for several generations\nthe boys and girls of New England had read the “Day of Doom” as\nif Mr. Wigglesworth, the gentle and somewhat sickly minister of\nMalden, had veritably peeped into Hell. It is the present fashion\nto underestimate the power of Wigglesworth’s verse. At its best\nit has a trampling, clattering shock like a charge of cavalry and\na sound like clanging steel. Mr. Kipling and other cunning\nballad-makers have imitated the peculiar rhyme structure chosen\nby the nervous little parson. But no living poet can move his\nreaders to the fascinated horror once felt by the Puritans as\nthey followed Wigglesworth’s relentless gaze into the future of\nthe soul’s destiny.",
        "Historical curiosity may still linger, of course, over other\nverse-writers of the period. Anne Bradstreet’s poems, for\ninstance, are not without grace and womanly sweetness, in spite\nof their didactic themes and portentous length. But this lady,\nborn in England, the daughter of Governor Dudley and later the\nwife of Governor Bradstreet, chose to imitate the more fantastic\nof the moralizing poets of England and France. There is little in\nher hundreds of pages which seems today the inevitable outcome of\nher own experience in the New World. For readers who like roughly\nmischievous satire, of a type initiated in England by Bishop Hall\nand Donne, there is “The Simple Cobbler of Agawam” written by the\nroving clergyman Nathaniel Ward. But he lived only a dozen years\nin Massachusetts, and his satirical pictures are scarcely more\n\"American” than the satire upon German professors in “Sartor\nResartus” is “German.” Like Charles Dickens’s “American Notes,\"\nWard’s give the reaction of a born Englishman in the presence of\nthe sights and the talk and the personages of the transatlantic\nworld.",
        "Of all the colonial writings of the seventeenth century, those\nthat have lost least of their interest through the lapse of years\nare narratives of struggles with the Indians. The image of the\n\"bloody savage” has always hovered in the background of the\nAmerican imagination. Our boys and girls have “played Indian\"\nfrom the beginning, and the actual Indian is still found, as for\nthree hundred years past, upon the frontier fringe of our\ncivilization. Novelists like Cooper, historians like Parkman,\npoets like Longfellow, have dealt with the rich material offered\nby the life of the aborigines, but the long series begins with\nthe scribbled story of colonists. Here are comedy and tragedy,\nplain narratives of trading and travel, missionary zeal and\ntriumphs; then the inevitable alienation of the two races and the\ndoom of the native.",
        "The “noble savage” note may be found in John Rolfe, the husband\nof Pocahontas, with whom, poor fellow, his “best thoughts are so\nintangled and enthralled.” Other Virginians, like Smith,\nStrachey, and Percy, show close naturalistic observation, touched\nwith the abounding Elizabethan zest for novelties. To Alexander\nWhitaker, however, these “naked slaves of the devil” were “not so\nsimple as some have supposed.” He yearned and labored over their\nsouls, as did John Eliot and Roger Williams and Daniel Gookin of\nNew England. In the Pequot War of 1637 the grim settlers resolved\nto be rid of that tribe once for all, and the narratives of\nCaptain Edward Johnson and Captain John Mason, who led in the\nstorming and slaughter at the Indians’ Mystic Fort, are as\npiously relentless as anything in the Old Testament. Cromwell at\nDrogheda, not long after, had soldiers no more merciless than\nthese exterminating Puritans, who wished to plough their fields\nhenceforth in peace. A generation later the storm broke again in\nKing Philip’s War. Its tales of massacre, captivity, and\nsingle-handed fighting linger in the American imagination still.\nTypical pamphlets are Mary Rowlandson’s thrilling tale of the\nLancaster massacre and her subsequent captivity, and the\nloud-voiced Captain Church’s unvarnished description of King\nPhilip’s death. The King, shot down like a wearied bull-moose in\nthe deep swamp, “fell upon his face in the mud and water, with\nhis gun under him.” They “drew him through the mud to the upland;\nand a doleful, great, naked dirty beast he looked like.” The head\nbrought only thirty shillings at Plymouth: “scanty reward and\npoor encouragement,” thought Captain Church. William Hubbard, the\nminister of Ipswich, wrote a comprehensive “Narrative of the\nTroubles with the Indians in New England,” bringing the history\ndown to 1677. Under the better known title of “Indian Wars,” this\nfervid and dramatic tale, penned in a quiet parsonage, has\nstirred the pulses of every succeeding generation. The close of\nKing Philip’s War, 1676, coinciding as it does with Bacon’s\nRebellion in Virginia, marks an era in the development of our\nindependent life. The events of that year, in the words of\nProfessor Tyler, “established two very considerable facts,\nnamely, that English colonists in America could be so provoked as\nto make physical resistance to the authority of England, and,\nsecond, that English colonists in America could, in the last\nresort, put down any combination of Indians that might be formed\nagainst them. In other words, it was then made evident that\nEnglish colonists would certainly be safe in the new world, and\nalso that they would not always be colonists.”",
        "While the end of an historical or literary era cannot always be\nthus conveniently indicated by a date, there is no doubt that the\nfinal quarter of the seventeenth century witnessed deep changes\nin the outward life and the inner temper of the colonists. The\n\"first fine careless rapture” was over. Only a few aged men could\nrecall the memory of the first settlements. Between the founding\nof Jamestown and the rebellion under the leadership of Nathaniel\nBacon almost seventy years had intervened, an interval\ncorresponding to that which separates us from the Mexican War.\nRoger Williams ended his much-enduring and beneficent life in the\nflourishing town of Providence in 1684. He had already outlived\nCotton and Hooker, Shepard and Winthrop, by more than thirty\nyears. Inevitably men began, toward the end of the century, to\ntake stock of the great venture of colonization, to scrutinize\ntheir own history and present position, to ask searching\nquestions of themselves. “You have better food and raiment than\nwas in former times,” wrote the aged Roger Clark, in 1676; “but\nhave you better hearts than your forefathers had?” Thomas\nWalley’s “Languishing Commonwealth” maintains that “Faith is\ndead, and Love is cold, and Zeal is gone.” Urian Oakes’s election\nsermon of 1670 in Cambridge is a condemnation of the prevalent\nworldliness and ostentation. This period of critical inquiry and\nassessment, however, also gives grounds for just pride. History,\nbiography, eulogy, are flourishing. The reader is reminded of\nthat epoch, one hundred and fifty years later, when the deaths of\nJohn Adams and of Thomas Jefferson, falling upon the same\nanniversary day, the Fourth of July, 1826, stirred all Americans\nto a fresh recognition of the services wrought by the Fathers of\nthe Republic. So it was in the colonies at the close of the\nseventeenth century. Old England, in one final paroxysm of\npolitical disgust, cast out the last Stuart in 1688. That\nRevolution marks, as we have seen, the close of a long and tragic\nstruggle which began in the autocratic theories of James the\nFirst and in the absolutism of Charles. Almost every phase of\nthat momentous conflict had its reverberation across the\nAtlantic, as the history of the granting and withdrawal of\ncolonial charters witnesses abundantly. The American pioneers\nwere quite aware of what was going on in England, and they\npraised God or grumbled, thriftily profited by the results or\nquietly nullified them, as the case might be. But all the time,\nwhile England was rocked to its foundations, the colonists struck\nsteadily forward into their own independent life.",
        "When the eighteenth century opened, many signs of change were in\nthe air. The third generation of native-born Americans was\nbecoming secularized. The theocracy of New England had failed. In\nthe height of the tragic folly over the supposed “witchcraft” in\nSalem, Increase Mather and his son Cotton had held up the hands\nof the judges in their implacable work. But before five years had\npassed, Judge Sewall does public penance in church for his share\nof the awful blunder, desiring “to take the shame and blame of\nit.” Robert Calef’s cool pamphlet exposing the weakness of the\nprosecutors’ case is indeed burned by Increase Mather in the\nHarvard Yard, but the liberal party are soon to force Mather from\nthe Presidency and to refuse that office to his son. In the town\nof Boston, once hermetically sealed against heresy, there are\nBaptist and Episcopal churches–and a dancing-master. Young\nBenjamin Franklin, born in 1706, professes a high respect for the\nMathers, but he does not go to church, “Sunday being my studying\nday,” and neither the clerical nor the secular arm of Boston is\nlong enough and strong enough to compel that industrious\napprentice into piety.",
        "If such was the state of New England, the laxity of New York and\nVirginia needs little evidence. Contemporary travelers found the\nNew Yorkers singularly attached to the things of this present\nworld. Philadelphia was prosperous and therewith content.\nVirginia was a paradise with no forbidden fruit. Hugh Jones,\nwriting of it in 1724, considers North Carolina “the refuge of\nrunaways,” and South Carolina “the delight of buccaneers and\npirates,” but Virginia “the happy retreat of true Britons and\ntrue Churchmen.” Unluckily these Virginians, well nourished “by\nthe plenty of the country,” have “contemptible notions of\nEngland!” We shall hear from them again. In the meantime the\nwitty William Byrd of Westover describes for us his amusing\nsurvey of the Dismal Swamp, and his excursions into North\nCarolina and to Governor Spotswood’s iron mines, where he reads\naloud to the Widow Fleming, on a rainy autumn day, three acts of\nthe “Beggars’ Opera,” just over from London. So runs the world\naway, south of the Potomac. Thackeray paints it once for all, no\ndoubt, in the opening chapters of “The Virginians.”",
        "To discover any ambitious literary effort in this period, we must\nturn northward again. In the middle colonies, and especially in\nPhiladelphia, which had now outgrown Boston in population, there\nwas a quickened interest in education and science. But the New\nEnglanders were still the chief makers of books. Three great\nnames will sufficiently represent the age: Cotton Mather, a\nprodigy of learning whose eyes turn back fondly to the provincial\npast; Jonathan Edwards, perhaps the most consummate intellect of\nthe eighteenth century; and Benjamin Franklin, certainly the most\nperfect exponent of its many-sided life.",
        "When Cotton Mather was graduated from Harvard in 1678, in his\nsixteenth year, he was publicly complimented by President Oakes,\nin fulsome Latin, as the grandson of Richard Mather and John\nCotton. This atmosphere of flattery, this consciousness of\ncontinuing in his own person the famous local dynasty, surrounded\nand sustained him to the end. He had a less commanding\npersonality than his father Increase. His nervous sensibility was\nexcessive. His natural vanity was never subdued, though it was\noften chastened by trial and bitter disappointment. But, like his\nfather, he was an omnivorous reader and a facile producer of\nbooks, carrying daily such burdens of mental and spiritual\nexcitement as would have crushed a normal man. Increase Mather\npublished some one hundred and fifty books and pamphlets: Cotton\nMather not less than four hundred. The Rev. John Norton, in his\nsketch of John Cotton, remarks that “the hen, which brings not\nforth without uncessant sitting night and day, is an apt emblem\nof students.” Certainly the hen is an apt emblem of the\n\"uncessant” sitter, the credulous scratcher, the fussy cackler\nwho produced the “Magnalia.”",
        "Yet he had certain elements of greatness. His tribal loyalty was\nperfect. His ascetic devotion to his conception of religious\ntruth was absolute. His Diary, which has recently been published\nin full, records his concern for the chief political events in\nEurope in his day, no less than his brooding solicitude for the\nwelfare of his townspeople, and his agony of spirit over the\nlapses of his wayward eldest son. A “sincere” man, then, as\nCarlyle would say, at bottom; but overlaid with such “Jewish old\nclothes,” such professional robings and personal plumage as makes\nit difficult, save in the revealing “Diary,” to see the man\nhimself.",
        "The “Magnalia Christi Americana,” treating the history of New\nEngland from 1620 to 1698, was published in a tall London folio\nof nearly 800 pages in 1702. It is divided into seven books, and\nproceeds, by methods entirely unique, to tell of Pilgrim and\nPuritan divines and governors, of Harvard College, of the\nchurches of New England, of marvelous events, of Indian wars; and\nin general to justify, as only a member of the Mather dynasty\ncould justify, the ways of God to Boston men. Hawthorne and\nWhittier, Longfellow and Lowell knew this book well and found\nmuch honey in the vast carcass. To have had four such readers and\na biographer like Barrett Wendell must be gratifying to Cotton\nMather in Paradise.",
        "The “Diary” of Mather’s fellow-townsman Judge Samuel Sewall has\nbeen read more generally in recent years than anything written by\nMather himself. It was begun in 1673, nine years earlier than the\nfirst entry in Mather’s “Diary,” and it ends in 1729, while\nMather’s closes in 1724. As a picture of everyday happenings in\nNew England, Sewall’s “Diary” is as far superior to Mather’s as\nPepys’s “Diary” is to George Fox’s “Journal” in painting the\nEngland of the Restoration. Samuel Sewall was an admirably solid\nfigure, keen, forceful, honest. Most readers of his “Diary\"\nbelieve that he really was in luck when he was rejected by the\nWidow Winthrop on that fateful November day when his eye\nnoted–in spite of his infatuation–that “her dress was not so\nclean as sometime it had been. Jehovah Jireh!”",
        "One pictures Cotton Mather as looking instinctively backward to\nthe Heroic Age of New England with pious nervous exaltation, and\nSamuel Sewall as doing the day’s work uprightly without taking\nanxious thought of either past or future. But Jonathan Edwards is\nset apart from these and other men. He is a lonely seeker after\nspiritual perfection, in quest of that city “far on the world’s\nrim,” as Masefield says of it, the city whose builder and maker\nis God.",
        "The story of Edwards’s career has the simplicity and dignity of\ntragedy. Born in a parsonage in the quiet Connecticut valley in\n1703–the year of John Wesley’s birth–he is writing at the age\nof ten to disprove the doctrine of the materiality of the soul.\nAt twelve he is studying “the wondrous way of the working of the\nspider,” with a precision and enthusiasm which would have made\nhim a great naturalist. At fourteen he begins his notes on “The\nMind” and on “Natural Science.” He is graduated from Yale in\n1720, studies theology, and at twenty-four becomes the colleague\nof his famous grandfather, Solomon Stoddard, in the church at\nNorthampton. He marries the beautiful Sarah Pierrepont, whom he\ndescribes in his journal in a prose rhapsody which, like his\nmystical rhapsodies on religion in the same youthful period,\nglows with a clear unearthly beauty unmatched in any English\nprose of that century. For twenty-three years he serves the\nNorthampton church, and his sermons win him the rank of the\nforemost preacher in New England. John Wesley reads at Oxford his\naccount of the great revival of 1735. Whitefield comes to visit\nhim at Northampton. Then, in 1750, the ascetic preacher alienates\nhis church over issues pertaining to discipline and to the\nadministration of the sacrament. He is dismissed. He preaches his\n\"farewell sermon,” like Wesley, like Emerson, like Newman, and\nmany another still unborn. He removes to Stockbridge, then a\nhamlet in the wilderness, preaches to the Indians, and writes\ntreatises on theology and metaphysics, among them the world\nfamous “Freedom of the Will.” In 1757, upon the death of his\nson-in-law, President Aaron Burr of Princeton, Edwards is called\nto the vacant Presidency. He is reluctant to go, for though he is\nonly fifty-four, his health has never been robust, and he has his\ngreat book on the “History of Redemption” still to write. But he\naccepts, finds the smallpox raging in Princeton upon his arrival\nin January, 1758, is inoculated, and dies of the disease in\nMarch–his dreams unfulfilled, his life-work once more thwarted.\nClose by the tomb of this saint is the tomb of his grandson,\nAaron Burr, who killed Hamilton.",
        "The literary reputation of Jonathan Edwards has turned, like the\nvicissitudes of his life, upon factors that could not be\nforeseen. His contemporary fame was chiefly as a preacher, and\nwas due to sermons like those upon “God Glorified in Man’s\nDependence” and “The Reality of Spiritual Life,” rather than to\nsuch discourses as the Enfield sermon, “Sinners in the Hands of\nan Angry God,” which in our own day is the best known of his\ndeliverances. Legends have grown up around this terrific Enfield\nsermon. Its fearful power over its immediate hearers cannot be\ngainsaid, and it will long continue to be quoted as an example of\nthe length to which a Calvinistic logician of genius was\ncompelled by his own scheme to go. We still see the tall,\nsweet-faced man, worn by his daily twelve hours of intense mental\ntoil, leaning on one elbow in the pulpit and reading from\nmanuscript, without even raising his gentle voice, those words\nwhich smote his congregation into spasms of terror and which seem\nto us sheer blasphemy.",
        "Yet the “Farewell Sermon of 1750” gives a more characteristic\nview of Edwards’s mind and heart, and conveys an ineffaceable\nimpression of his nobility of soul. His diction, like\nWordsworth’s, is usually plain almost to bareness; the formal\nframework of his discourses is obtruded; and he hunts objections\nto their last hiding place with wearisome pertinacity. Yet his\nlogic is incandescent. Steel sometimes burns to the touch like\nthis, in the bitter winters of New England, and one wonders\nwhether Edwards’s brain was not of ice, so pitiless does it seem.\nHis treatise denying the freedom of the will has given him a\nEuropean reputation comparable with that enjoyed by Franklin in\nscience and Jefferson in political propaganda. It was really a\npolemic demonstrating the sovereignty of God, rather than pure\ntheology or metaphysics. Edwards goes beyond Augustine and Calvin\nin asserting the arbitrary will of the Most High and in “denying\nto the human will any self-determining power.” He has been\nrefuted by events and tendencies, such as the growth of\nhistorical criticism and the widespread acceptance of the\ndoctrine of evolution, rather than by the might of any single\nantagonist. So, too, the Dred Scott decision of Chief Justice\nTaney, holding that the slave was not a citizen, was not so much\nanswered by opponents as it was superseded by the arbitrament of\nwar. But the idealism of this lonely thinker has entered deeply\nand permanently into the spiritual life of his countrymen, and he\nwill continue to be read by a few of those who still read Plato\nand Dante.",
        "“My mother grieves,” wrote Benjamin Franklin to his father in\n1738, “that one of her sons is an Arian, another an Arminian.\nWhat an Arminian or an Arian is, I cannot say that I very well\nknow. The truth is I make such distinctions very little my\nstudy.” To understand Franklin’s indifference to such\ndistinctions, we must realize how completely he represents the\nsecularizing tendencies of his age. What a drama of worldly\nadventure it all was, this roving life of the tallow-chandler’s\nson, who runs away from home, walks the streets of Philadelphia\nwith the famous loaves of bread under his arm, is diligent in\nbusiness, slips over to London, where he gives lessons in\nswimming and in total abstinence, slips back to Philadelphia and\nbecomes its leading citizen, fights the long battle of the\nAmerican colonies in London, sits in the Continental Congress,\nsails to Europe to arrange that French Alliance which brought our\nRevolution to a successful issue, and comes home at last, full of\nyears and honors, to a bland and philosophical exit from the\nstage!",
        "He broke with every Puritan tradition. The Franklins were\nrelatively late comers to New England. They sprang from a long\nline of blacksmiths at Ecton in Northamptonshire. The seat of the\nWashingtons was not far away, and Franklin’s latest biographer\npoints out that the pink-coated huntsmen of the Washington gentry\nmay often have stopped at Ecton to have their horses shod at the\nFranklin smithy. Benjamin’s father came out in 1685, more than\nfifty years after the most notable Puritan emigration. Young\nBenjamin, born in 1706, was as untouched by the ardors of that\nelder generation as he would have been by the visions of\nDante–an author, by the way, whom he never mentions, even as he\nnever mentions Shakespeare. He had no reverence for Puritan New\nEngland. To its moral beauty, its fine severity, he was wholly\nblind. As a boy he thriftily sold his Pilgrim’s “Progress.” He\nbecame, in the new fashion of that day, a Deist. Like a true\nchild of the eighteenth century, his attitude toward the\nseventeenth was that of amused or contemptuous superiority.\nThackeray has somewhere a charming phrase about his own love for\nthe back seat of the stage-coach, the seat which, in the old\ncoaching days, gave one a view of the receding landscape.\nThackeray, like Burke before him, loved historical associations,\nhistorical sentiment, the backward look over the long road which\nhumanity has traveled. But Franklin faced the other way. He would\nhave endorsed his friend Jefferson’s scornful sentence, “The dead\nhave no rights.” He joined himself wholly to that eighteenth\ncentury in which his own lot was cast, and, alike in his\nqualities and in his defects, he became one of its most perfect\nrepresentatives.",
        "To catch the full spirit of that age, turn for an instant to the\nLondon of 1724–the year of Franklin’s arrival. Thirty-six years\nhave elapsed since the glorious Revolution of 1688; the Whig\nprinciples, then triumphant, have been tacitly accepted by both\npolitical parties; the Jacobite revolt of 1715 has proved a\nfiasco; the country has accepted the House of Hanover and a\ngovernment by party leadership of the House of Commons, and it\ndoes not care whether Sir Robert Walpole buys a few rotten\nboroughs, so long as he maintains peace with Europe and\nprosperity at home. England is weary of seventeenth century\n\"enthusiasm,” weary of conflict, sick of idealism. She has found\nin the accepted Whig principles a satisfactory compromise, a\nworking theory of society, a modus vivendi which nobody supposes\nis perfect but which will answer the prayer appointed to be read\nin all the churches, “Grant us peace in our time, O Lord.” The\ntheories to which men gave their lives in the seventeenth century\nseem ghostly in their unreality; but the prize turnips on Sir\nRobert’s Norfolk farm, and the wines in his cellar, and the\noffices at his disposal–these are very real indeed. London\nmerchants are making money; the squire and the parson are\ntranquilly ruling the country parishes; the philosophy of John\nLocke is everywhere triumphant. Mr. Pope is the poet of the hour,\nand his “Essay on Man,” counseling acceptance of our mortal\nsituation, is considered to be the last word of human wisdom and\nof poetical elegance. In prose, the style of the “Spectator\"\nrules–an admirable style, Franklin thought, and he imitated it\npatiently until its ease and urbanity had become his own. And\nindeed, how much of that London of the third decade of the\ncentury passed into the mind of the inquisitive, roving,\nloose-living printer’s apprentice from Philadelphia! It taught\nhim that the tangible world is the real world, and that nothing\nsucceeds like success; but it never even whispered to him that\nsometimes nothing damns like success.",
        "In his limitations, no less than in his power of assimilation,\nFranklin was the representative man of his era. He had no\nartistic interests, no liking for metaphysics after his brief\ndevotion, in early manhood, to the dialogues of Plato. He taught\nhimself some Latin, but he came to believe that the classics had\nlittle significance and that they should be superseded by the\nmodern languages. For the mediaeval world he had no patience or\nunderstanding. To these defects of his century we must add some\nfailings of his own. He was not always truthful. He had an\nindelible streak of coarseness. His conception of the “art of\nvirtue” was mechanical. When Carlyle called Franklin the “father\nof all the Yankees,” we must remember that the Scotch prophet\nhated Yankees and believed that Franklin’s smooth, plausible,\ntrader type of morality was only a broad way to the everlasting\nbonfire.",
        "But it is folly to linger over the limitations of the tallow-\nchandler’s son. The catalogue of his beneficent activity is a\nvast one. Balzac once characterized him as the man who invented\nthe lightning-rod, the hoax, and the republic. His contributions\nto science have to do with electricity, earthquakes, geology,\nmeteorology, physics, chemistry, astronomy, mathematics,\nnavigation of air and water, agriculture, medicine, and hygiene.\nIn some of these fields he did pioneer work of lasting\nsignificance. His teachings of thrift and prudence, as formulated\nin the maxims of Poor Richard, gave him a world-wide reputation.\nHe attacked war, like Voltaire, not so much for its wickedness as\nfor its folly, and cheerfully gave up many years of a long life\nto the effort to promote a better understanding among the nations\nof the world.",
        "It is perhaps needless to add what all persons who love good\nwriting know, that Benjamin Franklin was a most delightful\nwriter. His letters cover an amusing and extraordinary variety of\ntopics. He ranges from balloons to summer hats, and from the\nadvantages of deep ploughing to bifocal glasses, which, by the\nway, he invented. He argues for sharp razors and cold baths, and\nfor fresh air in the sleeping-room. He discusses the morals of\nthe game of chess, the art of swimming, the evils of smoky\nchimneys, the need of reformed spelling. Indeed, his passion for\nimprovement led him not only to try his hand upon an abridgment\nof the Book of Common Prayer, but to go even so far as to propose\nseriously a new rendering of the Lord’s Prayer. His famous\nproposal for a new version of the Bible, however, which Matthew\nArnold solemnly held up to reprobation, was only a joke which\nMatthew Arnold did not see-the new version of Job being, in fact,\na clever bit of political satire against party leadership in\nEngland. Even more brilliant examples of his skill in political\nsatire are his imaginary “Edict of the King of Prussia against\nEngland,” and his famous “Rules for Reducing a Great Empire to a\nSmall One.\"But I must not try to call the roll of all the good\nthings in Franklin’s ten volumes. I will simply say that those\nwho know Franklin only in his “Autobiography,” charming as that\nclassic production is, have made but an imperfect acquaintance\nwith the range, the vitality, the vigor of this admirable\ncraftsman who chose a style “smooth, clear, and short,” and made\nit serve every purpose of his versatile and beneficent mind.",
        "When the passage of the Stamp Act in 1765 startled the American\ncolonies out of their provincial sense of security and made them\naware of their real attitude toward the mother country, Franklin\nwas in London. Eleven years earlier, in 1754, he had offered a\nplan for the “Union of the Colonies,” but this had not\ncontemplated separation from England. It was rather what we\nshould call a scheme for imperial federation under the British\nCrown. We may use his word union, however, in a different field\nfrom that of politics. How much union of sentiment, of mental and\nmoral life, of literary, educational, and scientific endeavor,\nwas there in the colonies when the hour of self-examination came?\nOnly the briefest summary may be attempted here. As to race,\nthese men of the third and fourth generation since the planting\nof the colonies were by no means so purely English as the first\nsettlers. The 1,600,000 colonists in 1760 were mingled of many\nstocks, the largest non-English elements being German and\nScotch-Irish–that is, Scotch who had settled for a while in\nUlster before emigrating to America. “About one-third of the\ncolonists in 1760,” says Professor Channing, “were born outside\nof America.” Crevecoeur’s “Letters from an American Farmer” thus\ndefined the Americans: “They are a mixture of English, Scotch,\nIrish, French, Dutch, Germans, and Swedes. From this promiscuous\nbreed that race now called Americans has arisen.” The Atlantic\nseaboard, with a narrow strip inland, was fairly well covered by\nlocal communities, differing in blood, in religion, in political\norganization–a congeries of separate experiments or young\nutopias, waiting for that most utopian experiment of all, a\nfederal union. But the dominant language of the “promiscuous\nbreed” was English, and in the few real centers of intellectual\nlife the English tradition was almost absolute.",
        "The merest glance at colonial journalism will confirm this\nestimate. The “Boston News-Letter,” begun in 1704, was the first\nof the journals, if we omit the single issue of “Publick\nOccurrences” in the same town in 1690. By 1765 there were nearly\nfifty colonial newspapers and several magazines. Their influence\nmade for union, in Franklin’s sense of that word, and their\nliterary models, like their paper, type, and even ink, were found\nin London. The “New England Courant,” established in Boston in\n1721 by James Franklin, is full of imitations of the “Tatler,\"\n\"Spectator,” and “Guardian.” What is more, the “Courant” boasted\nof its office collection of books, including Shakespeare, Milton,\nthe “Spectator,” and Swift’s “Tale of a Tub.\"* This was in 1722.\nIf we remember that no allusion to Shakespeare has been\ndiscovered in the colonial literature of the seventeenth century,\nand scarcely an allusion to the Puritan poet Milton, and that the\nHarvard College Library in 1723 had nothing of Addison, Steele,\nBolingbroke, Dryden, Pope, and Swift, and had only recently\nobtained copies of Milton and Shakespeare, we can appreciate the\nvalue of James Franklin’s apprenticeship in London. Perhaps we\ncan even forgive him for that attack upon the Mathers which threw\nthe conduct of the “Courant,” for a brief period, into the hands\nof his brother Benjamin, whose turn at a London apprenticeship\nwas soon to come.",
        "* Cook, E. C. “Literary Influences in Colonial Newspapers,\n1704-1750.” N. Y., 1912.",
        "If we follow this younger brother to Philadelphia and to\nBradford’s “American Mercury” or to Franklin’s own “Pennsylvania\nGazette,” or if we study the “Gazettes” of Maryland, Virginia,\nand South Carolina, the impression is still the same. The\nliterary news is still chiefly from London, from two months to a\nyear late. London books are imported and reprinted. Franklin\nreprints Pamela, and his Library Company of Philadelphia has two\ncopies of “Paradise Lost “for circulation in 1741, whereas there\nhad been no copy of that work in the great library of Cotton\nMather. American journalism then, as now, owed its vitality to a\nsecular spirit of curiosity about the actual world. It followed\nEngland as its model, but it was beginning to develop a temper of\nits own.",
        "Colonial education and colonial science were likewise chiefly\nindebted to London, but by 1751 Franklin’s papers on electricity\nbegan to repay the loan. A university club in New York in 1745\ncould have had but fifteen members at most, for these were all\nthe “academics” in town. Yet Harvard had then been sending forth\nher graduates for more than a century. William and Mary was\nfounded in 1693, Yale in 1701, Princeton in 1746, King’s (now\nColumbia) in 1754, the University of Pennsylvania in 1755, and\nBrown in 1764. These colonial colleges were mainly in the hands\nof clergymen. They tended to reproduce a type of scholarship\nbased upon the ancient languages. The curriculum varied but\nlittle in the different colonies, and this fact helped to produce\na feeling of fellowship among all members of the republic of\nletters. The men who debated the Stamp Act were, with a few\nstriking exceptions, men trained in Latin and Greek, familiar\nwith the great outlines of human history, accustomed to the\ndiscipline of academic disputation. They knew the ideas and the\nvocabulary of cultivated Europe and were conscious of no\nprovincial inferiority. In the study of the physical sciences,\nlikewise, the colonials were but little behind the mother\ncountry. The Royal Society had its distinguished members here.\nThe Mathers, the Dudleys, John Winthrop of Connecticut, John\nBartram, James Logan, James Godfrey, Cadwallader Colden, and\nabove all, Franklin himself, were winning the respect of European\nstudents, and were teaching Americans to use their eyes and their\nminds not merely upon the records of the past but in searching\nout the inexhaustible meanings of the present. There is no more\nfascinating story than that of the beginnings of American science\nin and outside of the colleges, and this movement, like the\ninfluence of journalism and of the higher education, counted for\ncolonial union.",
        "Professor Tyler, our foremost literary student of the period,\nsummarizes the characteristics of colonial literature in these\nwords: “Before the year 1765, we find in this country, not one\nAmerican people, but many American peoples . . . . No cohesive\nprinciple prevailed, no centralizing life; each little nation was\nworking out its own destiny in its own fashion.” But he adds that\nwith that year the colonial isolation came to an end, and that\nthe student must thereafter “deal with the literature of one\nmultitudinous people, variegated, indeed, in personal traits, but\nsingle in its commanding ideas and in its national destinies.” It\nis easy to be wise after the event. Yet there was living in\nLondon in 1765, as the agent for Pennsylvania, a shrewd and bland\nColonial–an honorary M. A. from both Harvard and Yale, a D.C.L.\nof Oxford and an LL.D. of St. Andrews who was by no means sure\nthat the Stamp Act meant the end of Colonialism. And Franklin’s\nuncertainty was shared by Washington. When the tall Virginian\ntook command of the Continental Army as late as 1775, he\n\"abhorred the idea of independence.” Nevertheless John Jay,\nwriting the second number of the “Federalist” in 1787, only\ntwelve years later, could say: “Providence has been pleased to\ngive this one connected country to one united people; a people\ndescended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language,\nprofessing the same religion, attached to the same principles of\ngovernment.”",
        "If we turn, however, to the literature produced in America\nbetween the passage of the Stamp Act in 1765 and the adoption of\nthe Constitution in 1787, we perceive that it is a literature of\ndiscord and passion. Its spirit is not that of “one united\npeople.” Washington could indeed declare in his “Farewell\nAddress” of 1796, “With slight shades of difference, you have the\nsame religion, manners, habits, and political principles\"; yet no\none knew better than Washington upon what a slender thread this\npolitical unity had often hung, and how impossible it had been to\nforesee the end from the beginning.",
        "It is idle to look in the writings of the Revolutionary period\nfor the literature of beauty, for a quiet harmonious unfolding of\nthe deeper secrets of life. It was a time of swift and pitiless\nchange, of action rather than reflection, of the turning of many\nseparate currents into one headlong stream. “We must, indeed, all\nhang together,” runs Franklin’s well-known witticism in\nIndependence Hall, “or, most assuredly, we shall all hang\nseparately.” Excellently spoken, Doctor! And that homely, cheery,\ndaring sentence gives the keynote of much of the Revolutionary\nwriting that has survived. It may be heard in the state papers of\nSamuel Adams, the oratory of Patrick Henry, the pamphlets of\nThomas Paine, the satires of Freneau and Trumbull, and in the\nsubtle, insinuating, thrilling paragraphs of Thomas Jefferson.",
        "We can only glance in passing at the literature of the Lost\nCause, the Loyalist or “Tory” pleadings for allegiance to\nBritain. It was written by able and honest men, like Boucher and\nOdell, Seabury, Leonard and Galloway. They distrusted what\nSeabury called “our sovereign Lord the Mob.” They represented, in\nJohn Adams’s opinion, nearly one-third of the people of the\ncolonies, and recent students believe that this estimate was too\nlow. In some colonies the Loyalists were clearly in the majority.\nIn all they were a menacing element, made up of the conservative,\nthe prosperous, the well-educated, with a mixture, of course, of\nmere placemen and tuft-hunters. They composed weighty pamphlets,\neloquent sermons, and sparkling satire in praise of the old order\nof things. When their cause was lost forever, they wrote gossipy\nletters from their exile in London or pathetic verses in their\nnew home in Nova Scotia and Ontario. Their place in our national\nlife and literature has never been filled, and their talents and\nvirtues are never likely to receive adequate recognition. They\ntook the wrong fork of the road.",
        "There were gentle spirits, too, in this period, endowed with\ndelicate literary gifts, but quite unsuited for the clash of\ncontroversy–members, in Crevecoeur’s touching words, of the\n\"secret communion among good men throughout the world.” “I am a\nlover of peace, what must I do?” asks Crevecoeur in his “Letters\nfrom an American Farmer.” “I was happy before this unfortunate\nRevolution. I feel that I am no longer so, therefore I regret the\nchange. My heart sometimes seems tired with beating, it wants\nrest like my eyelids, which feel oppressed with so many\nwatchings.” Crevecoeur, an immigrant from Normandy, was certainly\nno weakling, but he felt that the great idyllic American\nadventure which he described so captivatingly in his chapter\nentitled “What is an American\"–was ending tragically in civil\nwar. Another whitesouled itinerant of that day was John Woolman\nof New Jersey, whose “Journal,” praised by Charles Lamb and\nChanning and edited by Whittier, is finding more readers in the\ntwentieth century than it won in the nineteenth. “A man\nunlettered,” said Whittier, “but with natural refinement and\ndelicate sense of fitness, the purity of whose heart enters into\nhis language.” Woolman died at fifty-two in far-away York,\nEngland, whither he had gone to attend a meeting of the Society\nof Friends.",
        "The three tall volumes of the Princeton edition of the poems of\nPhilip Freneau bear the sub-title, “Poet of the American\nRevolution.” But our Revolution, in truth, never had an adequate\npoet. The prose-men, such as Jefferson, rose nearer the height of\nthe great argument than did the men of rhyme. Here and there the\nstruggle inspired a brisk ballad like Francis Hopkinson’s “Battle\nof the Kegs,” a Hudibrastic satire like Trumbull’s “McFingal,” or\na patriotic song like Timothy Dwight’s “Columbia.” Freneau\npainted from his own experience the horrors of the British\nprison-ship, and celebrated, in cadences learned from Gray and\nCollins, the valor of the men who fell at Eutaw Springs. There\nwas patriotic verse in extraordinary profusion, but its literary\nvalue is slight, and it reveals few moods of the American mind\nthat are not more perfectly conveyed through oratory, the\npamphlet, and the political essay. The immediate models of this\nRevolutionary verse were the minor British bards of the\neighteenth century, a century greatly given to verse-writing, but\nendowed by Heaven with the “prose-reason” mainly. The reader of\nBurton E. Stevenson’s collection of “Poems of American History\"\ncan easily compare the contemporary verse inspired by the events\nof the Revolution with the modern verse upon the same historic\nthemes. He will see how slenderly equipped for song were most of\nthe later eighteenth-century Americans and how unfavorable to\npoetry was the tone of that hour.",
        "Freneau himself suffered, throughout his long career, from the\ndepressing indifference of his public to the true spirit of\npoetry. “An old college mate of mine,” said James Madison–who\nwas by tradition Freneau’s roommate at Princeton in the class of\n1771–\"a poet and man of literary and refined tastes, knowing\nnothing of the world.” When but three years out of college, the\ncautious Madison wrote to another friend: “Poetry wit and\nCriticism Romances Plays &c captivated me much: but I begin to\ndiscover that they deserve but a moderate portion of a mortal’s\nTime and that something more substantial more durable more\nprofitable befits our riper age.” Madison was then at the ripe\nage of twenty-three! Professor Pattee, Freneau’s editor, quotes\nthese words to illustrate the “common sense” atmosphere of the\nage which proved fatal to Freneau’s development. Yet the sturdy\nyoung New Yorker, of Huguenot descent, is a charming figure, and\nhis later malevolence was shown only to his political foes. After\nleaving Princeton he tries teaching, the law, the newspaper, the\nsea; he is aflame with patriotic zeal; he writes, like most\nAmerican poets, far too much for his own reputation. As the\neditor of the “National Gazette” in Philadelphia, he becomes\ninvolved in the bitter quarrel between his chief, Jefferson, and\nAlexander Hamilton. His attachment to the cause of the French\nRevolution makes him publish baseless attacks upon Washington. By\nand by he retires to a New Jersey farm, still toying with\njournalism, still composing verses. He turns patriotic poet once\nmore in the War of 1812; but the public has now forgotten him. He\nlives on in poverty and seclusion, and in his eightieth year\nloses his way in a snowstorm and perishes miserably–this in\n1832, the year of the death of the great Sir Walter Scott, who\nonce had complimented Freneau by borrowing one of his best lines\nof poetry.",
        "It is in the orations and pamphlets and state papers inspired by\nthe Revolutionary agitation that we find the most satisfactory\nexpression of the thought and feeling of that generation. Its\ntypical literature is civic rather than aesthetic, a sort of\nwriting which has been incidental to the accomplishing of some\npolitical, social, or moral purpose, and which scarcely regards\nitself as literature at all. James Otis’s argument against the\nWrits of Assistance in Massachusetts in 1761, and Patrick Henry’s\nspeech in the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1765, mark epochs in\nthe emotional life of these communities. They were reported\nimperfectly or not at all, but they can no more be ignored in an\nassessment of our national experience than editorials, sermons,\nor conversations which have expressed the deepest feelings of a\nday and then have perished beyond resurrection.",
        "Yet if natural orators like Otis and Henry be denied a strictly\n\"literary” rating because their surviving words are obviously\ninadequate to account for the popular effect of their speeches,\nit is still possible to measure the efficiency of the\npamphleteer. When John Adams tells us that “James Otis was Isaiah\nand Ezekiel united,” we must take his word for the impression\nwhich Otis’s oratory left upon his mind. But John Adams’s own\nwritings fill ten stout volumes which invite our judgment. The\n\"truculent and sarcastic splendor” of his hyperboles need not\nblind us to his real literary excellencies, such as clearness,\ncandor, vigor of phrase, freshness of idea. A testy, rugged,\n\"difficult” person was John Adams, but he grew mellower with age,\nand his latest letters and journals are full of whimsical charm.",
        "John Adams’s cousin Samuel was not precisely a charming person.\nBigoted, tireless, secretive, this cunning manipulator of\npolitical passions followed many tortuous paths. His ability for\nadroit misstatement of an adversary’s position has been equaled\nbut once in our history. But to the casual reader of his four\nvolumes, Samuel Adams seems ever to be breathing the liberal air\nof the town-meeting: everything is as plainly obvious as a good\ncitizen can make it. He has, too, the large utterance of the\nEuropean liberalism of his day. “Resolved,” read his Resolutions\nof the House of Representatives of Massachusetts in 1765, “that\nthere are certain essential rights of the British constitution of\ngovernment which are founded in the law of God and nature and are\nthe common rights of mankind.” In his statement of the Rights of\nthe Colonists (1772) we are assured that “among the natural\nrights of the colonists are these, First, a right to Life;\nsecondly to Liberty; thirdly to Property .... All men have a\nRight to remain in a State of Nature as long as they please . . .\n. When Men enter into Society, it is by voluntary consent.\"\nJean-Jacques himself could not be more bland, nor at heart more\nfiercely demagogic.",
        "“Tom” Paine would have been no match for “Sam” Adams in a\ntown-meeting, but he was an even greater pamphleteer. He had\narrived from England in 1774, at the age of thirty-eight, having\nhitherto failed in most of his endeavors for a livelihood.\n\"Rebellious Staymaker; unkempt,” says Carlyle; but General\nCharles Lee noted that there was “genius in his eyes,” and he\nbore a letter of introduction from Franklin commending him as an\n\"ingenious, worthy young man,” which obtained for him a position\non the “Pennsylvania Magazine.” Before he had been a year on\nAmerican soil, Paine was writing the most famous pamphlet of our\npolitical literature, “Common Sense,” which appeared in January,\n1776. “A style hitherto unknown on this side of the Atlantic,\"\nwrote Edmund Randolph. Yet this style of familiar talk to the\ncrowd had been used seventy years earlier by Defoe and Swift, and\nit was to be employed again by a gaunt American frontiersman who\nwas born in 1809, the year of Thomas Paine’s death. “The Crisis,\"\na series of thirteen pamphlets, of which the first was issued in\nDecember, 1776, seemed to justify the contemporary opinion that\nthe “American cause owed as much to the pen of Paine as to the\nsword of Washington. “Paine, who was now serving in the army,\nmight have heard his own words, “These are the times that try\nmen’s souls,” read aloud, by Washington’s orders, to the ragged\ntroops just before they crossed the Delaware to win the victory\nof Trenton. The best known productions of Paine’s subsequent\ncareer, “The Rights of Man” and “The Age of Reason,” were written\nin Europe, but they were read throughout America. The reputation\nof the “rebellious Staymaker” has suffered from certain grimy\nhabits and from the ridiculous charge of atheism. He was no more\nan atheist than Franklin or Jefferson. In no sense an original\nthinker, he could impart to outworn shreds of deistic controversy\nand to shallow generalizations about democracy a personal fervor\nwhich transformed them and made his pages gay and bold and clear\nas a trumpet.",
        "Clear and bold and gay was Alexander Hamilton likewise; and his\nliterary services to the Revolution are less likely to be\nunderestimated than Thomas Paine’s. They began with that boyish\nspeech in “the Fields” of New York City in 1774 and with “The\nFarmer Refuted,” a reply to Samuel Seabury’s “Westchester\nFarmer.” They were continued in extraordinary letters, written\nduring Hamilton’s military career, upon the defects of the\nArticles of Confederation and of the finances of the\nConfederation. Hamilton contributed but little to the actual\nstructure of the new Constitution, but as a debater he fought\nmagnificently and triumphantly for its adoption by the Convention\nof the State of New York in 1788. Together with Jay and Madison\nhe defended the fundamental principles of the Federal Union in\nthe remarkable series of papers known as the “Federalist.” These\neighty-five papers, appearing over the signature “Publius” in two\nNew York newspapers between October, 1787, and April, 1788, owed\ntheir conception largely to Hamilton, who wrote more than half of\nthem himself. In manner they are not unlike the substantial Whig\nliterature of England, and in political theory they have little\nin common with the Revolutionary literature which we have been\nconsidering. The reasoning is close, the style vigorous but\nneither warmed by passion nor colored by the individual emotions\nof the author. The “Federalist” remains a classic example of the\ncivic quality of our post-Revolutionary American political\nwriting, broadly social in its outlook, well informed as to the\npast, confident–but not reckless–of the future. Many Americans\nstill read it who would be shocked by Tom Paine and bored with\nEdmund Burke. It has none of the literary genius of either of\nthose writers, but its formative influence upon successive\ngenerations of political thinking has been steadying and sound.",
        "In fact, our citizen literature cannot be understood aright if\none fails to observe that its effect has often turned, not upon\nmere verbal skill, but upon the weight of character behind the\nwords. Thus the grave and reserved George Washington says of the\nConstitution of 1787: “Let us raise a standard to which the wise\nand the honest can repair; the event is in the hand of God.” The\nwhole personality of the great Virginian is back of that simple,\nperfect sentence. It brings us to our feet, like a national\nanthem.",
        "One American, no doubt our most gifted man of letters of that\ncentury, passed most of the Revolutionary period abroad, in the\nservice of his country. Benjamin Franklin was fifty-nine in the\nyear of the Stamp Act. When he returned from France in 1785 he\nwas seventy-nine, but he was still writing as admirably as ever\nwhen he died at eighty-four. We cannot dismiss this singular,\nvaried, and fascinating American better than by quoting the\nletter which George Washington wrote to him in September, 1789.\nIt has the dignity and formality of the eighteenth century, but\nit is warm with tested friendship and it glows with deep human\nfeeling: “If to be venerated for benevolence, if to be admired\nfor talents, if to be esteemed for patriotism, if to be beloved\nfor philanthropy, can gratify the human mind, you must have the\npleasing consolation to know that you have not lived in vain. And\nI flatter myself that it will not be ranked among the least\ngrateful occurrences of your life to be assured, that, so long as\nI retain my memory, you will be recollected with respect,\nveneration, and affection by your sincere friend, George\nWashington.”",
        "There remains another Virginian, the symbol of the Revolutionary\nage, the author of words more widely known around the globe than\nany other words penned by an American. “Thomas Jefferson,” writes\nthe latest of his successors in the Presidency, “was not a man of\nthe people, but he was a man of such singular insight that he saw\nthat all the roots of generous power come from the people.” On\nhis father’s side Jefferson came from sound yeoman stock, in\nwhich Welsh blood ran. His mother was a Virginia Randolph. Born\nin Albemarle County, near the “little\nmountain\"–Monticello–where he built a mansion for his bride and\nwhere he lies buried, the tall, strong, red-haired, gray-eyed,\ngifted boy was reputed the best shot, the best rider, the best\nfiddle-player in the county. He studied hard at William and Mary\nover his Greek, Latin, French, Italian, and Spanish, but he also\nfrequented the best society of the little capital. He learned to\ncall himself a Deist and to theorize about ideal commonwealths.\nThere was already in him that latent radicalism which made him\nstrike down, as soon as he had the power, two of the fundamental\nprinciples of the society into which he was born, the principle\nof entailed property and that of church establishment.",
        "Such was the youth of twenty-two who was thrilled in 1765 by the\nStamp Act. In the ten years of passionate discussion which\nfollowed, two things became clear: first, that there had long\nexisted among the colonists very radical theoretical notions of\npolitical freedom; and second, that there was everywhere a spirit\nof practical conservatism. Jefferson illustrates the union of\nthese two tendencies.",
        "He took his seat in the Continental Congress in June, 1775. He\nwas only thirty-two, but he had already written, in the summer of\n1774, “A Summary View of the Rights of British America” which had\nbeen published in England by Burke, himself a judge of good\nwriting and sound politics. Jefferson had also prepared in 1775\nthe “Address of the Virginia House of Burgesses.” For these\nreasons he was placed at the head of the Committee for drafting\nthe Declaration of Independence. We need not linger over the\nfamiliar circumstances of its composition. Everybody knows how\nFranklin and Adams made a few verbal alterations in the first\ndraft, how the committee of five then reported it to the\nCongress, which proceeded to cut out about one-fourth of the\nmatter, while Franklin tried to comfort the writhing author with\nhis cheerful story about the sign of John Thompson the hatter.\nForty-seven years afterwards, in reply to the charge of lack of\noriginality brought against the Declaration by Timothy Pickering\nand John Adams–charges which have been repeated at intervals\never since–Jefferson replied philosophically: “Whether I\ngathered my ideas from reading or reflection I do not know. I\nknow only that I turned neither to book nor pamphlet while\nwriting it. I did not consider it as any part of my charge to\ninvent new ideas altogether and to offer no sentiment which had\never been expressed before.” O wise young man, and fundamentally\nAnglo-Saxon young man, to turn his back, in that crisis, to the\ndevil of mere cleverness, and stick to recognized facts and\naccepted sentiments! But his pen retains its cunning in spite of\nhim; and the drop of hot Welsh blood tells; and the cosmopolitan\nreading and thinking tell; and they transform what Pickering\ncalled a “commonplace compilation, its sentiments hackneyed in\nCongress for two years before,” into an immortal manifesto to\nmankind.",
        "Its method is the simplest. The preamble is philosophical,\ndealing with “self-evident” truths. Today the men who dislike or\ndoubt these truths dismiss the preamble as “theoretical,” or, to\nuse another term of derogation favored by reactionaries,\n\"French.” But if the preamble be French and philosophical, the\nspecific charges against the King are very English and practical.\nHere are certain facts, presented no doubt with consummate\nrhetorical skill, but facts, undeniably. The Anglo-Saxon in\nJefferson is basal, racial; the turn for academic philosophizing\nafter the French fashion is personal, acquired; but the range and\nsweep and enduring vitality of this matchless state paper lie in\nits illumination of stubborn facts by general principles, its\ndecent respect to the opinions of mankind, its stately and noble\nutterance of national sentiments and national reasons to a\n\"candid world.”",
        "It has long been the fashion, among a certain school of\nhalf-hearted Americans–and unless I am mistaken, the teaching\nhas increased during the last decades–to minimize the value of\nJefferson’s “self-evident truths.” Rufus Choate, himself a\nconsummate rhetorician, sneered at those “glittering\ngeneralities,” and countless college-bred men, some of them\noccupying the highest positions, have echoed the sneer. The\nessence of the objection to Jefferson’s platform lies of course\nin his phrase, “all men are created equal,” with the subsidiary\nphrase about governments “deriving their just powers from the\nconsent of the governed.” Editors and congressmen and even\ncollege professors have proclaimed themselves unable to assent to\nthese phrases of the Declaration, and unable even to understand\nthem. These objectors belong partly, I think, in Jefferson’s\ncategory of “nervous persons\"–\"anti-republicans,” as he goes on\nto define them–\"whose languid fibres have more analogy with a\npassive than an active state of things.” Other objectors to the\nphrase “all men are created equal” have had an obvious personal\nor political motive for refusing assent to the proposition. But\n\"no intelligent man,” says one of Jefferson’s biographers, “has\never misconstrued it [the Declaration] except intentionally.”",
        "Nobody would claim today that Thomas Jefferson’s statement of the\nsentiments and reasons for the independence of the thirteen\nBritish colonies in 1776 was an adequate handbook of political\nwisdom, fit for all the exigencies of contemporary American\ndemocracy. It is not that. It is simply, in Lincoln’s phrase, one\nof “the standard maxims of free society” which no democracy can\nsafely disregard.",
        "Jefferson’s long life, so varied, so flexible, so responsive to\nthe touch of popular forces, illustrates the process by which the\nVirginia mind of 1743 became the nationalized, unionized mind of\n1826. It is needless here to dwell upon the traits of his\npersonal character: his sweetness of spirit, his\nstout-heartedness in disaster, his scorn of money, his love for\nthe intellectual life. “I have no ambition to govern men,” he\nwrote to Edward Rutledge. He was far happier talking about Greek\nand Anglo-Saxon with Daniel Webster before the fire-place of\nMonticello than he ever was in the presidential chair. His\ncorrespondence was enormous. His writings fill twenty volumes. In\nhis theories of education he was fifty years ahead of his time;\nin his absolute trust in humanity he was generations ahead of it.\n\"I am not one of those who fear the people,” he declared proudly.\nIt is because of this touching faith, this invincible and\nmatchless ardor, that Jefferson is today remembered. He\nforeshadowed Lincoln. His belief in the inarticulate common\npeople is rewarded by their obstinate fidelity to his name as a\ntype and symbol. “I know of no safe depository of the ultimate\npowers of society but the people themselves,” wrote Jefferson,\nand with the people themselves is the depository of his fame.",
        "The Fourth of July orator for 1826 in Cambridge, Massachusetts,\nwas Edward Everett. Although only thirty-two he was already a\ndistinguished speaker. In the course of his oration he\napostrophized John Adams and Thomas Jefferson as venerable\nsurvivors of that momentous day, fifty years earlier, which had\nwitnessed our Declaration of Independence. But even as Everett\nwas speaking, the aged author of the Declaration breathed his\nlast at Monticello, and in the afternoon of that same day Adams\ndied also, murmuring, it is said, with his latest breath, and as\nif with the whimsical obstinacy of an old man who hated to be\nbeaten by his ancient rival, “Thomas Jefferson still lives.” But\nJefferson was already gone.",
        "On the first of August, Everett commemorated the career of the\ntwo Revolutionary leaders, and on the following day a greater\nthan Everett, Daniel Webster, pronounced the famous eulogy in\nFaneuil Hall. Never were the thoughts and emotions of a whole\ncountry more adequately voiced than in this commemorative\noratory. Its pulse was high with national pride over the\naccomplishments of half a century. “I ask,” Everett declared,\n\"whether more has not been done to extend the domain of\ncivilization, in fifty years, since the Declaration of\nIndependence, than would have been done in five centuries of\ncontinued colonial subjection?” Webster asserted in his\nperoration: “It cannot be denied, but by those who would dispute\nagainst the sun, that with America, and in America, a new era\ncommences in human affairs. This era is distinguished by free\nrepresentative governments, by entire religious liberty, by\nimproved systems of national intercourse, by a newly awakened and\nan unconquerable spirit of free enquiry, and by a diffusion of\nknowledge through the community such as has been before\naltogether unknown and unheard of.”",
        "Was this merely the “tall talk” then so characteristic of\nAmerican oratory and soon to be satirized in “Martin Chuzzlewit”?\nOr was it prompted by a deep and true instinct for the\nsignificance of the vast changes that had come over American life\nsince 1776? The external changes were familiar enough to\nWebster’s auditors: the opening of seemingly illimitable\nterritory through the Louisiana Purchase, the development of\nroads, canals, and manufactures; a rapid increase in wealth and\npopulation; a shifting of political power due to the rise of the\nnew West–in a word, the evidences of irrepressible national\nenergy. But this energy was inadequately expressed by the\nnational literature. The more cultivated Americans were quite\naware of this deficiency. It was confessed by the pessimistic\nFisher Ames and by the ardent young men who in 1815 founded “The\nNorth American Review.” British critics in “The Edinburgh” and\n\"The Quarterly,” commenting upon recent works of travel in\nAmerica, pointed out the literary poverty of the American soil.\nSydney Smith, by no means the most offensive of these critics,\ndeclared in 1820: “During the thirty or forty years of their\nindependence they have done absolutely nothing for the sciences,\nfor the arts, for literature . . . . In the four quarters of the\nglobe, who reads an American book? or goes to an American play?\nor looks at an American picture or statue?”",
        "Sydney Smith’s question “Who reads an American book?” has\noutlived all of his own clever volumes. Even while he was asking\nit, London was eagerly reading Irving’s “Sketch Book.” In 1821\ncame Fenimore Cooper’s Spy and Bryant’s “Poems,” and by 1826,\nwhen Webster was announcing in his rolling orotund that Adams and\nJefferson were no more, the London and Paris booksellers were\ncovering their stalls with Cooper’s “The Last of the Mohicans.\"\nIrving, Cooper, and Bryant are thus the pioneers in a new phase\nof American literary activity, often called, for convenience in\nlabeling, the Knickerbocker Group because of the identification\nof these men with New York. And close behind these leaders come a\nyounger company, destined likewise, in the shy boyish words of\nHawthorne, one of the number, “to write books that would be read\nin England.” For by 1826 Hawthorne and Longfellow were out of\ncollege and were trying to learn to write. Ticknor, Prescott, and\nBancroft, somewhat older men, were settling to their great tasks.\nEmerson was entering upon his duties as a minister. Edgar Allan\nPoe, at that University of Virginia which Jefferson had just\nfounded, was doubtless revising “Tamerlane and Other Poems” which\nhe was to publish in Boston in the following year. Holmes was a\nHarvard undergraduate. Garrison had just printed Whittier’s first\npublished poem in the Newburyport “Free Press.” Walt Whitman was\na barefooted boy on Long Island, and Lowell, likewise seven years\nof age, was watching the birds in the treetops of Elmwood. But it\nwas Washington Irving who showed all of these men that nineteenth\ncentury England would be interested in American books.",
        "The very word Knickerbocker is one evidence of the vitality of\nIrving’s happy imaginings. In 1809 he had invented a mythical\nDutch historian of New York named Diedrich Knickerbocker and\nfathered upon him a witty parody of Dr. Mitchill’s grave “Picture\nof New York.” To read Irving’s chapters today is to witness one\nof the rarest and most agreeable of phenomena, namely, the actual\nbeginning of a legend which the world is unwilling to let die.\nThe book made Sir Walter Scott’s sides ache with laughter, and\nreminded him of the humor of Swift and Sterne. But certain New\nYorkers were slow to see the joke.",
        "Irving was himself a New Yorker, born just at the close of the\nRevolution, of a Scotch father and English mother. His youth was\npleasantly idle, with a little random education, much\ntheater-going, and plentiful rambles with a gun along the Hudson\nRiver. In 1804 he went abroad for his health, returned and helped\nto write the light social satire of the “Salmagundi Papers,” and\nbecame, after the publication of the “Knickerbocker History,” a\nlocal celebrity. Sailing for England in 1815 on business, he\nstayed until 1832 as a roving man of letters in England and Spain\nand then as Secretary of the American Legation in London. “The\nSketch Book,” “Bracebridge Hall,” and “Tales of a Traveler” are\nthe best known productions of Irving’s fruitful residence in\nEngland. The “Life of Columbus,” the “Conquest of Granada,” and\n\"The Alhambra” represent his first sojourn in Spain. After his\nreturn to America he became fascinated with the Great West, made\nthe travels described in his “Tour of the Prairies,” and told the\nstory of roving trappers and the fur trade in “Captain\nBonneville” and “Astoria.” For four years he returned to Spain as\nAmerican Minister. In his last tranquil years at Sunnyside on the\nHudson, where he died in 1859, he wrote graceful lives of\nGoldsmith and of Washington.",
        "Such a glance at the shelf containing Irving’s books suggests but\nlittle of that personal quality to which he owes his significance\nas an interpreter of America to the Old World. This son of a\nnarrow, hard, Scotch dealer in cutlery, this drifter about town\nwhen New York was only a big slovenly village, this light-hearted\nscribbler of satire and sentiment, was a gentleman born. His\nboyhood and youth were passed in that period of\nPost-Revolutionary reaction which exhibits the United States in\nsome of its most unlovely aspects. Historians like Henry Adams\nand McMaster have painted in detail the low estate of education,\nreligion, and art as the new century began. The bitter feeling of\nthe nascent nation toward Great Britain was intensified by the\nWar of 1812. The Napoleonic Wars had threatened to break the last\nthreads of our friendship for France, and suspicion of the Holy\nAlliance led to an era of national self-assertion of which the\nMonroe Doctrine was only one expression. The raw Jacksonism of\nthe West seemed to be gaining upon the older civilizations\nrepresented by Virginia and Massachusetts. The self-made type of\nman began to pose as the genuine American. And at this moment\ncame forward a man of natural lucidity and serenity of mind, of\nperfect poise and good temper, who knew both Europe and America\nand felt that they ought to know one another better and to like\none another more. That was Irving’s service as an international\nmediator. He diffused sweetness and light in an era marked by\nbitterness and obscuration. It was a triumph of character as well\nas of literary skill.",
        "But the skill was very noticeable also. Irving’s prose is not\nthat of the Defoe-Swift-Franklin-Paine type of plain talk to the\ncrowd. It is rather an inheritance from that other eighteenth\ncentury tradition, the conversation of the select circle. Its\naccents were heard in Steele and Addison and were continued in\nGoldsmith, Sterne, Cowper, and Charles Lamb. Among Irving’s\nsuccessors, George William Curtis and Charles Dudley Warner and\nWilliam Dean Howells have been masters of it likewise. It is\nmellow human talk, delicate, regardful, capable of exquisite\nmodulation. With instinctive artistic taste, Irving used this old\nand sound style upon fresh American material. In “Rip van Winkle\"\nand “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow” he portrayed his native valley\nof the Hudson, and for a hundred years connoisseurs of style have\nperceived the exquisite fitness of the language to the images and\nideas which Irving desired to convey. To render the Far West of\nthat epoch this style is perhaps not “big” and broad enough, but\nwhen used as Irving uses it in describing Stratford and\nWestminster Abbey and an Old English Christmas, it becomes again\na perfect medium. Hawthorne adopted it for “Our Old Home,” and\nEnglishmen recognized it at once as a part of their own\ninheritance, enriched, like certain wines, by the voyage across\nthe Atlantic and home again. Irving wrote of England, Mr. Warner\nonce said, as Englishmen would have liked to write about it. When\nhe described the Alhambra and Granada and the Moors, it was the\nstyle, rich both in physical sensation and in dreamlike reverie,\nwhich revealed to the world the quick American appreciation of\nforeign scenes and characters. Its key is sympathy.",
        "Irving’s popularity has endured in England. It suffered during\nthe middle of the century in his own country, for the strongest\nNew England authors taught the public to demand more thought and\npassion than were in Irving’s nature. Possibly the nervous,\njournalistic style of the twentieth century allows too scanty\nleisure of mind for the full enjoyment of the Knickerbocker\nflavor. Yet such changes as these in literary fashion scarcely\naffect the permanent service of Irving to our literature. He\nimmortalized a local type–the New York Dutchman–and local\nlegends, like that of Rip van Winkle; he used the framework of\nthe narrative essay to create something almost like the perfected\nshort story of Poe and Hawthorne; he wrote prose with unfailing\ncharm in an age when charm was lacking; and, if he had no\nmessage, it should be remembered that some of the most useful\nambassadors have had none save to reveal, with delicacy and tact\nand humorous kindness, the truth that foreign persons have\nfeelings precisely like our own.",
        "Readers of Sir Walter Scott’s “Journal” may remember his account\nof an evening party in Paris in 1826 where he met Fenimore\nCooper, then in the height of his European reputation. “So the\nScotch and American lions took the field together,” wrote Sir\nWalter, who loved to be generous. “The Last of the Mohicans,\"\nthen just published, threatened to eclipse the fame of “Ivanhoe.\"\nCooper, born in 1789, was eighteen years younger than the Wizard\nof the North, and was more deeply indebted to him than he knew.\nFor it was Scott who had created the immense nineteenth century\naudience for prose fiction, and who had evolved a kind of formula\nfor the novel, ready for Cooper’s use. Both men were natural\nstory-tellers. Scott had the richer mind and the more fully\ndeveloped historical imagination. Both were out-of-doors men,\nlovers of manly adventure and of natural beauty. But the American\nhad the good fortune to be able to utilize in his books his\npersonal experiences of forest and sea and to reveal to Europe\nthe real romance of the American wilderness.",
        "That Cooper was the first to perceive the artistic possibilities\nof this romance, no one would claim. Brockden Brown, a Quaker\nyouth of Philadelphia, a disciple of the English Godwin, had\ntried his hand at the very end of the eighteenth century upon\nAmerican variations of the Gothic romance then popular in\nEngland. Brown had a keen eye for the values of the American\nlandscape and even of the American Indian. He had a knack for\npassages of ghastly power, as his descriptions of maniacs,\nmurderers, sleep-walkers, and solitaries abundantly prove. But he\nhad read too much and lived too little to rival the masters of\nthe art of fiction. And there was a traveled Frenchman,\nChateaubriand, surely an expert in the art of eloquent prose, who\nhad transferred to the pages of his American Indian stories,\n\"Atala” and “Rene,” the mystery and enchantment of our dark\nforests\nand endless rivers. But Chateaubriand, like Brockden Brown, is\nfeverish. A taint of old-world eroticism and despair hovers like\na miasma over his magnificent panorama of the wilderness. Cooper,\nlike Scott, is masculine.",
        "He was a Knickerbocker only by adoption. Born in New Jersey, his\nchildhood was spent in the then remote settlement of Cooperstown\nin Central New York. He had a little schooling at Albany, and a\nbrief and inglorious career at Yale with the class of 1806. He\nwent to sea for two years, and then served for three years in the\nUnited States Navy upon Lakes Ontario and Champlain, the very\nscene of some of his best stories. In 1811 he married, resigned\nfrom the Navy, and settled upon a little estate in Westchester\nCounty, near New York. Until the age of thirty, he was not in the\nleast a bookman, but a healthy, man of action. Then, as the\nwell-known anecdote goes, he exclaims to his wife, after reading\na stupid English novel, “I believe I could write a better story\nmyself.” “Precaution” (1820) was the result, but whether it was\nbetter than the unknown English book, no one can now say. It was\nbad enough. Yet the next year Cooper published “The Spy,” one of\nthe finest of his novels, which was instantly welcomed in England\nand translated in France. Then came, in swift succession, “The\nPioneers,” the first Leather-Stocking tale in order of\ncomposition, and “The Pilot,” to show that Scott’s “Pirate” was\nwritten by a landsman! “Lionel Lincoln” and “The Last of the\nMohicans” followed. The next seven years were spent in Europe,\nmainly in France, where “The Prairie” and “The Red Rover” were\nwritten. Cooper now looked back upon his countrymen with eyes of\ncritical detachment, and made ready to tell them some of their\nfaults. He came home to Cooperstown in 1833, the year after\nIrving’s return to America. He had won, deservedly, a great fame,\nwhich he proceeded to imperil by his combativeness with his\nneighbors and his harsh strictures upon the national character,\ndue mainly to his lofty conception of the ideal America. He\ncontinued to spin yarns of sea and shore, and to write naval\nhistory. The tide of fashion set against him in the\neighteen-forties when Bulwer and Dickens rode into favor, but the\nstouthearted old pioneer could afford to bide his time. He died\nin 1851, just as Mrs. Stowe was writing “Uncle Tom’s Cabin.”",
        "Two generations have passed since then, and Cooper’s place in our\nliterature remains secure. To have written our first historical\nnovel, “The Spy,” our first sea-story, “The Pilot,” and to have\ncreated the Leather-Stocking series, is glory enough. In his\nperception of masculine character, Cooper ranks with Fielding.\nHis sailors, his scouts and spies, his good and bad Indians, are\nas veritable human figures as Squire Western. Long Tom Coffin,\nHarvey Birch, Hawk-Eye, and Chingachgook are physically and\nmorally true to life itself. Read the Leather-Stocking books in\nthe order of the events described, beginning with “The\nDeerslayer,” then “The Last of the Mohicans,” “The Pathfinder,\"\n\"The Pioneers”, and ending with the vast darkening horizon of\n\"The Prairie” and the death of the trapper, and one will feel how\nnatural and inevitable are the fates of the personages and the\nalterations in the life of the frontier. These books vary in\ntheir poetic quality and in the degree of their realism, but to\nwatch the evolution of the leading figure is to see human life in\nits actual texture.",
        "Clever persons and pedantic persons have united to find fault\nwith certain elements of Cooper’s art. Mark Twain, in one of his\nleast inspired moments, selected Cooper’s novels for attack.\nEvery grammar school teacher is ready to point out that his style\nis often prolix and his sentences are sometimes ungrammatical.\nAmateurs even criticize Cooper’s seamanship, although it seemed\nimpeccable to Admiral Mahan. No doubt one must admit the\n\"helplessness, propriety, and incapacity” of most of Cooper’s\nwomen, and the dreadfulness of his bores, particularly the\nScotchmen, the doctors, and the naturalists. Like Sir Walter,\nCooper seems to have taken but little pains in the deliberate\nplanning of his plots. Frequently he accepts a ready-made formula\nof villain and hero, predicament and escape, renewed crisis and\nrescue, mystification and explanation, worthy of a third-rate\nnovelist. His salvation lies in his genius for action, the beauty\nand grandeur of his landscapes, the primitive veracity of his\nchildren of nature. Cooper was an elemental man, and he\ncomprehended, by means of something deeper than mere artistic\ninstinct, the feelings of elemental humanity in the presence of\nthe wide ocean or of the deep woods. He is as healthy and sane as\nFielding, and he possesses an additional quality which all of the\npurely English novelists lack. It was the result of his youthful\nsojourn in the wilderness. Let us call it the survival in him of\nan aboriginal imagination. Cooper reminds one somehow of a\nmoose–an ungraceful creature perhaps, but indubitably big, as\nmany a hunter has suddenly realized when he has come unexpectedly\nupon a moose that whirled to face him in the twilight silence of\na northern wood.",
        "Something of this far-off and gigantic primitivism inheres also\nin the poetry of William Cullen Bryant. His portrait, with the\nsweeping white beard and the dark folds of the cloak, suggests\nthe Bard as the Druids might have known him. But in the\neighteen-thirties and forties, Mr. Bryant’s alert, clean-shaven\nface, and energetic gait as he strode down Broadway to the\n\"Evening Post” office, suggested little more than a vigorous and\nsomewhat radical editor of an increasingly prosperous Democratic\nnewspaper. There was nothing of the Fringed Gentian or Yellow\nViolet about him. Like so many of the Knickerbockers, Bryant was\nan immigrant to New York; in fact, none of her adopted men of\nletters have represented so perfectly the inherited traits of the\nNew England Puritan. To understand his long, and honorable public\nlife it is necessary to know something of the city of his choice,\nbut to enter into the spirit of his poetry one must go back to\nthe hills of western Massachusetts.",
        "Bryant had a right to his cold-weather mind. He came from\nMayflower stock. His father, Dr. Peter Bryant of Cummington, was\na sound country physician, with liberal preferences in theology,\nFederalist views in politics, and a library of seven hundred\nvolumes, rich in poetry. The poet’s mother records his birth in\nher diary in terse words which have the true Spartan tang: “Nov.\n3, 1794. Stormy, wind N. E. Churned. Seven in the evening a son\nborn.” Two days later the November wind shifted. “Nov. 5, 1794.\nClear, wind N. W. Made Austin a coat. Sat up all day. Went into\nthe kitchen.” The baby, it appears, had an abnormally large head\nand was dipped, day after day, in rude hydropathy, into an icy\nspring. A precocious childhood was followed by a stern, somewhat\nunhappy, but aspiring boyhood. The little fellow, lying prone\nwith his brothers before the firelight of the kitchen, reading\nEnglish poetry from his father’s library, used to pray that he\ntoo might become a poet. At thirteen he produced a satire on\nJefferson, “The Embargo,” which his proud Federalist father\nprinted\nat Boston in 1808. The youth had nearly one year at Williams\nCollege, over the mountain ranges to the west. He wished to\ncontinue his education at Yale, but his father had no money for\nthis greater venture, and the son remained at home. There, in the\nautumn of 1811, on the bleak hills, he composed the first draft\nof “Thanatopsis.” He was seventeen, and he had been reading\nBlair’s “Grave” and the poems of the consumptive Henry Kirke\nWhite.\nHe hid his verses in a drawer, and five years later his father\nfound them, shed tears over them, and sent them to the “North\nAmerican Review,” where they were published in September, 1817.",
        "In the meantime the young man had studied law, though with\ndislike of it, and with the confession that he sometimes read\n\"The Lyrical Ballads” when he might have been reading Blackstone.\nOne December afternoon in 1815, he was walking from Cummington to\nPlainfield–aged twenty-one, and looking for a place in which to\nsettle as a lawyer. Across the vivid sunset flew a black duck, as\nsolitary and homeless as himself. The bird seemed an image of his\nown soul, “lone wandering but not lost.” Before he slept that\nnight he had composed the poem “To a Waterfowl.” No more\nauthentic inspiration ever visited a poet, and though Bryant\nwrote verse for more than sixty years after that crimson sky had\npaled into chill December twilight, his lines never again\nvibrated with such communicative passion.",
        "Bryant’s ensuing career revealed the steady purpose, the\nstoicism, the reticence of the Puritan. It was highly successful,\njudged even by material standards. “Thanatopsis” had been\ninstantly regarded in 1817 as the finest poem yet produced in\nAmerica. The author was invited to contribute to the “North\nAmerican Review” an essay on American poetry, and this, like all\nof Bryant’s prose work, was admirably written. He delivered his\nHarvard Phi Beta Kappa poem, “The Ages,” in 1821, the year of\nEmerson’s graduation. After a brief practice of the law in Great\nBarrington, he entered in 1826 into the unpromising field of\njournalism in New York. While other young Knickerbockers wasted\ntheir literary strength on trifles and dissipated their moral\nenergies, Bryant held steadily to his daily task. His life in\ntown was sternly ascetic, but he allowed himself long walks in\nthe country, and he continued to meditate a somewhat thankless\nMuse. In 1832 he visited his brothers on the Illinois prairies,\nand stopped one day to chat with a “tall awkward uncouth lad” of\nracy conversational powers, who was leading his company of\nvolunteers into the Black Hawk War. The two men were destined to\nmeet again in 1860, when Bryant presided at that Cooper Union\naddress of Lincoln’s which revealed to New York and to the\ncountry that the former captain of volunteers was now a king of\nmen. Lincoln was embarrassed on that occasion, it is said, by\nBryant’s fastidious, dignified presence. Not so Nathaniel\nHawthorne, who had seen the poet in Rome, two years before.\n\"There was a weary look in his face,” wrote Hawthorne, “as if he\nwere tired of seeing things and doing things. . . .He uttered\nneither passion nor poetry, but excellent good sense, and\naccurate information, on whatever subject transpired; a very\npleasant man to associate with, but rather cold, I should\nimagine, if one should seek to touch his heart with one’s own.\"\nSuch was the impression Bryant made upon less gifted men than\nHawthorne, as he lived out his long and useful life in the\nKnickerbocker city. Toward the close of it he was in great demand\nfor public occasions; and it was after delivering a speech\ndedicating a statue to Mazzini in Central Park in 1878, when\nBryant was eighty-four, that a fit of dizziness caused a fall\nwhich proved fatal to the venerable poet. It was just seventy\nyears since Dr. Peter Bryant had published his boy’s verses on\n\"The Embargo.”",
        "Although Bryant’s poetry has never roused any vociferous\nexcitement, it has enduring qualities. The spiritual\npreoccupations of many a voiceless generation of New England\nPuritans found a tongue at last in this late-born son of theirs.\nThe determining mood of his best poems, from boyhood to old age,\nwas precisely that thought of transiency, “the eternal flow of\nthings,” which colored the imaginations of the first colonists.\nThis is the central motive of “Thanatopsis,” “To a Waterfowl,\"\n\"The Rivulet,” “A Forest Hymn,” “An Evening Revery,” “The Crowded\nStreet,” “The Flood of Years.” All of these tell the same story\nof endless change and of endless abiding, of varying eddies in\nthe same mighty stream of human existence. Bryant faced the\nthought as calmly, as majestically, at seventeen as when he wrote\n\"The Flood of Years” at eighty-two. He is a master of\ndescription, though he has slight gift for narrative or drama,\nand he rarely sounds the clear lyric note. But everywhere in his\nverse there is that cold purity of the winter hills in Western\nMassachusetts, something austere and elemental which reaches\nkindred spirits below the surface on which intellect and passion\nhave their play, something more primitive, indeed, than human\nintellect or passion and belonging to another mode of being,\nsomething “rock-ribbed and ancient as the sun.”",
        "A picture of the Knickerbocker era is not complete without its\nportraits of the minor figures in the literary life of New York\nup to the time of the Civil War. But the scope of the present\nvolume does not permit sketches of Paulding and Verplanck, of\nHalleck and his friend Drake, of N. P. Willis and Morris and\nWoodworth. Some of these are today only “single-poem” men, like\nPayne, the author of “Home Sweet Home,” just as Key, the author\nof “The Star-Spangled Banner,” is today a “single-poem” man of an\nearlier generation. Their names will be found in such limbos of\nthe dead as Griswold’s “Poets and Poetry of America” and Poe’s\n\"Literati.” They knew “the town” in their day, and pleased its\nvery easily pleased taste. The short-lived literary magazines of\nthe eighteen-forties gave them their hour of glory. As\nrepresentatives of passing phases of the literary history of New\nYork their careers are not without sentimental interest, but few\nof them spoke to or for the country as a whole. Two figures,\nindeed, stand out in sharp contrast with those habitual strollers\non Broadway and frequenters of literary gatherings, though each\nof them was for a while a part of Knickerbocker New York. To all\nappearances they were only two more Bohemians like the rest, but\nthe curiosity of the twentieth century sets them apart from their\nforgotten contemporaries. They are two of the unluckiest–and yet\nluckiest–authors who ever tried to sell a manuscript along\nBroadway. One of them is Edgar Allan Poe and the other is Walt\nWhitman. They shall have a chapter to themselves.",
        "But before turning to that chapter, we must look back to New\nEngland once more and observe the blossoming-time of its ancient\ncommonwealths. During the thirty years preceding the Civil War\nNew England awoke to a new life of the spirit. So varied and rich\nwas her literary productiveness in this era that it still remains\nher greatest period, and so completely did New England writers of\nthis epoch voice the ideals of the nation that the great majority\nof Americans, even today, regard these New Englanders as the\ntruest literary exponents of the mind and soul of the United\nStates. We must take a look at them.",
        "To understand the literary leadership of New England during the\nthirty years immediately preceding the Civil War it is necessary\nto recall the characteristics of a somewhat isolated and peculiar\npeople. The mental and moral traits of the New England colonists,\nalready glanced at in an earlier chapter, had suffered little\nessential modification in two hundred years. The original racial\nstock was still dominant. As compared with the middle and\nsouthern colonies, there was relatively little immigration, and\nthis was easily assimilated. The physical remoteness of New\nEngland from other sections of the country, and the stubborn\nloyalty with which its inhabitants maintained their own standards\nof life, alike contributed to their sense of separateness. It is\ntrue, of course, that their mode of thinking and feeling had\nundergone certain changes. They were among the earliest theorists\nof political independence from Great Britain, and had done their\nshare, and more, in the Revolution. The rigors of their early\ncreed had somewhat relaxed, as we have seen, by the end of the\nseventeenth century, and throughout the eighteenth there was a\ngradual progress toward religious liberalism. The population\nsteadily increased, and New England’s unremitting struggle with a\nnot too friendly soil, her hardihood upon the seas, and her\nkeenness in trade, became proverbial throughout the country. Her\nseaport towns were wealthy. The general standards of living\nremained frugal, but extreme poverty was rare. Her people still\nmade, as in the earliest days of the colonies, silent and\nunquestioned sacrifices for education, and her chief seats of\nlearning, Harvard and Yale, remained the foremost educational\ncenters of America. But there was still scant leisure for the\nquest of beauty, and slender material reward for any practitioner\nof the fine arts. Oratory alone, among the arts of expression,\ncommanded popular interest and applause. Daniel Webster’s\naudiences at Plymouth in 1820 and at Bunker Hill in 1825 were not\ninferior to similar audiences of today in intelligence and in\nresponsiveness. Perhaps they were superior. Appreciation of the\nspoken word was natural to men trained by generations of\nthoughtful listening to “painful” preaching and by participation\nin the discussions of town-meeting. Yet appreciation of secular\nliterature was rare, and interest in the other arts was almost\nnon-existent.",
        "Then, beginning in the eighteen-twenties, and developing rapidly\nafter 1830, came a change, a change so startling as to warrant\nthe term of “the Renascence of New England.” No single cause is\nsufficient to account for this “new birth.” It is a good\nillustration of that law of “tension and release,” which the late\nProfessor Shaler liked to demonstrate in all organic life. A long\nperiod of strain was followed by an age of expansion, freedom,\nrelease of energy. As far as the mental life of New England was\nconcerned, something of the new stimulus was due directly to the\ninfluence of Europe. Just as the wandering scholars from Italy\nhad brought the New Learning, which was a revival of the old\nlearning, into England in the sixteenth century, so now young New\nEngland college men like Edward Everett and George Ticknor\nbrought home from the Continent the riches of German and French\nscholarship. Emerson’s description of the impression made by\nEverett’s lectures in 1820, after his return from Germany, gives\na vivid picture of the new thirst for foreign culture. “The North\nAmerican Review” and other periodicals, while persistently urging\nthe need of a distinctively national literature, insisted also\nupon the value of a deeper knowledge of the literature of the\nContinent. This was the burden of Channing’s once famous article\non “A National Literature” in 1823: it was a plea for an\nindependent American school of writers, but these writers should\nknow the best that Europe had to teach.",
        "The purely literary movement was connected, as the great name of\nChanning suggests, with a new sense of freedom in philosophy and\nreligion. Calvinism had mainly done its work in New England. It\nhad bred an extraordinary type of men and women, it had, helped\nto lay some of the permanent foundations of our democracy, and it\nwas still destined to have a long life in the new West and in the\nSouth. But in that stern section of the country where its\ninfluence had been most marked there was now an increasingly\nsharp reaction against its determinism and its pessimism. Early\nin the nineteenth century the most ancient and influential\nchurches in Boston and the leading professors at Harvard had\naccepted the new form of religious liberalism known as\nUnitarianism. The movement spread throughout Eastern\nMassachusetts and made its way to other States. Orthodox and\nliberal Congregational churches split apart, and when Channing\npreached the ordination sermon for Jared Sparks in Baltimore in\n1819, the word Unitarian, accepted by the liberals with some\nmisgiving, became the recognized motto of the new creed. It is\nonly with its literary influence that we are here concerned, yet\nthat literary influence became so potent that there is scarcely a\nNew England writer of the first rank, from Bryant onward, who\nremained untouched by it.",
        "The most interesting and peculiar phase of the new liberalism has\nlittle directly to do with the specific tenets of theological\nUnitarianism, and in fact marked a revolt against the more\nprosaic and conventional pattern of English and American\nUnitarian thought. But this movement, known as Transcendentalism,\nwould have been impossible without a preliminary and liberalizing\nstirring of the soil. It was a fascinating moment of release for\nsome of the most brilliant and radical minds of New England. Its\nforemost representative in our literature was Ralph Waldo\nEmerson, as its chief exponents in England were Coleridge and\nCarlyle. We must understand its meaning if we would perceive the\nquality of much of the most noble and beautiful writing produced\nin New England during the Golden Age.",
        "What then is the significance of the word Transcendental?\nDisregarding for the moment the technical development of this\nterm as used by German and English philosophers, it meant for\nEmerson and his friends simply this: whatever transcends or goes\nbeyond the experience of the senses. It stressed intuition rather\nthan sensation, direct perception of ultimate truth rather than\nthe processes of logic. It believed in man’s ability to apprehend\nthe absolute ideas of Truth, Rectitude, Goodness. It resembled\nthe Inner Light of the Quaker, though the Quaker traced this to a\nsupernatural illumination of the Holy Spirit, while the\nTranscendentalist believed that a vision of the eternal realities\nwas a natural endowment of the human mind. It had only to be\ntrusted. Stated in this form, it is evident that we have here a\nvery ancient doctrine, well known in the literature of India and\nof Greece. It has been held by countless persons who have never\nheard of the word Transcendentalism. We need go no further back\nthan Alexander Pope, a Roman Catholic, whom we find declaring: “I\nam so certain of the soul’s being immortal that I seem to feel it\nwithin me, as it were by intuition.” Pope’s friend Swift, a dean\nof the Church of England and assuredly no Transcendentalist,\ndefined vision as seeing the things that are invisible.",
        "Now turn to some of the New England men. Dr. C. A. Bartol, a\ndisciple of Emerson, maintained that “the mistake is to make the\neverlasting things subjects of argument instead of sight.\"\nTheodore Parker declared to his congregation:",
        "“From the primitive facts of consciousness given by the power of\ninstinctive intuition, I endeavored to deduce the true notion of\nGod, of justice and futurity . . . . I found most help in the\nworks of Immanuel Kant, one of the profoundest thinkers of the\nworld, though one of the worst writers, even in Germany; if he\ndid not always furnish conclusions I could rest in, he yet gave\nme the true method, and put me on the right road. I found certain\ngreat primal Intuitions of Human Nature, which depend on no\nlogical process of demonstration, but are rather facts of\nconsciousness given by the instinctive action of human nature\nitself. I will mention only the three most important which\npertain to Religion. 1. The Instinctive Intuition of the Divine,\nthe consciousness that there is a God. 2. The Instinctive\nIntuition of the Just and Right, a consciousness that there is a\nMoral Law, independent of our will, which we ought to keep. 3.\nThe Instinctive Intuition of the Immortal, a consciousness that\nthe Essential Element of man, the principle of Individuality,\nnever dies.”",
        "This passage dates from 1859, and readers of Bergson may like to\ncompare it with the contemporary Frenchman’s saying: “The\nanalytical faculties can give us no realities.”",
        "Let us next hear Emerson himself, first in an early letter to his\nbrother Edward: “Do you draw the distinction of Milton,\nColeridge, and the Germans between Reason and Understanding? I\nthink it a philosophy itself, and, like all truth, very\npractical. Reason is the highest faculty of the soul, what we\nmean often by the soul itself: it never reasons, never proves, it\nsimply perceives, it is vision. The understanding toils all the\ntime, compares, contrives, adds, argues; near-sighted, but\nstrong-sighted, dwelling in the present, the expedient, the\ncustomary.” And in 1833, after he had left the Unitarian pulpit,\nEmerson made in his diary this curious attempt to reconcile the\nscriptural language of his ancestral profession to the new\nvocabulary of Transcendentalism: “Jesus Christ was a minister of\nthe pure Reason. The beatitudes of the Sermon on the Mount are\nall utterances of the mind contemning the phenomenal world . . .\n. The understanding can make nothing of it. ’Tis all nonsense.\nThe Reason affirms its absolute verity . . . . St. Paul marks the\ndistinction by the terms natural man and spiritual man. When\nNovalis says, ’It is the instinct of the Understanding to\ncontradict the Reason,’ he only translates into a scientific\nformula the doctrine of St. Paul, ’The Carnal Mind is enmity\nagainst God.’”",
        "One more quotation must suffice. It is from a poem by a forgotten\nTranscendentalist, F. G. Tuckerman.",
        "“No more thy meaning seek, thine anguish plead;\nBut, leaving straining thought and stammering word,\nAcross the barren azure pass to God;\nShooting the void in silence, like a bird–\nA bird that shuts his wings for better speed!”",
        "It is obvious that this “contemning the phenomenal world,” this\n\"revulsion against the intellect as the sole source of truth,” is\nhighly dangerous to second-class minds. If one habitually prints\nthe words Insight, Instinct, Intuition, Consciousness with\ncapitals, and relegates equally useful words like senses,\nexperience, fact, logic to lower-case type, one may do it because\nhe is a Carlyle or an Emerson, but the chances are that he is\nneither. Transcendentalism, like all idealistic movements, had\nits “lunatic fringe,” its camp-followers of excitable, unstable\nvisionaries. The very name, like the name Methodist, was probably\nbestowed upon it in mockery, and this whole perturbation of staid\nNew England had its humorous side. Witness the career of Bronson\nAlcott. It is also true that the glorious affirmations of these\nseers can be neither proved nor disproved. They made no\nexamination and they sought no validation of consciousness. An\nexplorer in search of the North Pole must bring back proofs of\nhis journey, but when a Transcendentalist affirms that he has\nreached the far heights of human experience and even caught sight\nof the gods sitting on their thrones, you and I are obliged to\ntake his word for it. Sometimes we hear such a man gladly, but it\ndepends upon the man, not upon the trustworthiness of the method.\nFinally it should be observed that the Transcendental movement\nwas an exceedingly complex one, being both literary, philosophic,\nand religious; related also to the subtle thought of the Orient,\nto mediaeval mysticism, and to the English Platonists; touched\nthroughout by the French Revolutionary theories, by the Romantic\nspirit, by the new zeal for science and pseudo-science, and by\nthe unrest of a fermenting age.",
        "Our present concern is with the impact of this cosmopolitan\ncurrent upon the mind and character of a few New England writers.\nChanning and Theodore Parker, Margaret Fuller and Alcott, Thoreau\nand Emerson, are all representative of the best thought and the\nnoblest ethical impulses of their generation. Let us choose first\nthe greatest name: a sunward-gazing spirit, and, it may be, one\nof the very Sun-Gods.",
        "The pilgrim to Concord who stops for a moment in the village\nlibrary to study French’s statue of Emerson will notice the\nasymmetrical face. On one side it is the face of a keen Yankee\nfarmer, but seen from the other side it is the countenance of a\nseer, a world’s man. This contrast between the parochial Emerson\nand the greater Emerson interprets many a puzzle in his career.\nHalf a mile beyond the village green to the north, close to the\n\"rude bridge” of the famous Concord fight in 1775, is the Old\nManse, once tenanted and described by Hawthorne. It was built by\nEmerson’s grandfather, a patriot chaplain in the Revolution, who\ndied of camp-fever at Ticonderoga. His widow married Dr. Ezra\nRipley, and here Ralph Waldo Emerson and his brothers passed many\na summer in their childhood. Half a mile east of the village, on\nthe Cambridge turnpike, is Emerson’s own house, still sheltered\nby the pines which Thoreau helped him to plant in 1838. Within\nthe house everything is unchanged: here are the worn books, pen\nand inkstand, the favorite pictures upon the wall. Over the ridge\nto the north lies the Sleepy Hollow cemetery where the poet\nrests, with the gravestones of Hawthorne and the Alcotts, Thoreau\nand William James close by.",
        "But although Concord is the Emerson shrine, he was born in\nBoston, in 1803. His father, named William like the grandfather,\nwas also, like the Emerson ancestors for many generations, a\nclergyman–eloquent, liberal, fond of books and music, highly\nhonored by his alma mater Harvard and by the town of Boston,\nwhere he ministered to the First Church. His premature death in\n1811 left his widow with five sons–one of them feebleminded–and\na daughter to struggle hard with poverty. With her husband’s\nsister, the Calvinistic “Aunt Mary Moody” Emerson, she held,\nhowever, that these orphaned boys had been “born to be educated.\"\nArid educated the “eager blushing boys” were, at the Boston Latin\nSchool and at Harvard College, on a regimen of “toil and want and\ntruth and mutual faith.” There are many worse systems of pedagogy\nthan this. Ralph was thought less persistent than his steady\nolder brother William, and far less brilliant than his gifted,\nshort-lived younger brothers, Edward and Charles. He had an\nundistinguished career at Harvard, where he was graduated in\n1821, ranking thirtieth in a class of fifty-nine. Lovers of irony\nlike to remember that he was the seventh choice of his classmates\nfor the position of class poet. After some desultory teaching to\nhelp his brothers, he passed irregularly through the Divinity\nSchool, his studies often interrupted by serious ill-health. “If\nthey had examined me,” he said afterward of the kindly professors\nin the Divinity School, “they never would have passed me.” But\napprove him they did, in 1826, and he entered decorously upon the\nprofession of his ancestors, as associate minister of the Second\nChurch in Boston. His “Journals,” which are a priceless record of\nhis inner life, at this and later periods, reveal the rigid\nself-scrutiny, the tender idealism, with which he began his\nministerial career.",
        "But as a scheme of life for Ralph Waldo Emerson this vocation\nwould not satisfy. The sexton of the Second Church thought that\nthe young man was not at his best at funerals. Father Taylor, the\neccentric Methodist, whom Emerson assisted at a sailor’s Bethel\nnear Long Wharf, considered him “one of the sweetest souls God\never made,” but as ignorant of the principles of the New\nTestament as Balaam’s ass was of Hebrew grammar. By and by came\nan open difference with his congregation over the question of\nadministering the Communion. “I am not interested in it,” Emerson\nadmitted, and he wrote in his “Journal” the noble words: “It is\nmy desire, in the office of a Christian minister, to do nothing\nwhich I cannot do with my whole heart.” His resignation was\naccepted in 1832. His young wife had died of consumption in the\nsame year. He now sailed for Italy, France, and England, a\nmemorable journey which gave him an acquaintance with Landor,\nWordsworth, Coleridge, and Carlyle, but which was even more\nsignificant in sending him, as he says, back to himself, to the\nresources of his own nature. “When shows break up,” wrote Whitman\nafterward, “what but oneself is sure?” In 1834 and 1835 we find\nEmerson occupying a room in the Old Manse at Concord, strolling\nin the quiet fields, lecturing or preaching if he were invited to\ndo so, but chiefly absorbed in a little book which he was\nbeginning to write–a new utterance of a new man.",
        "This book, the now famous “Nature” of 1836, contains the essence\nof Emerson’s message to his generation. It is a prose essay, but\nwritten in the ecstatic mood of a poet. The theme of its\nmeditation is the soul as related to Nature and to God. The soul\nis primal; Nature, in all its bountiful and beautiful\ncommodities, exists for the training of the soul; it is the\nsoul’s shadow. And every soul has immediate access to Deity. Thus\nthe utility and beauty and discipline of Nature lift the soul\nGodward. The typical sentence of the book is this: “The sun\nshines today also\"; that is to say: the world is still alive and\nfair; let us lift up our hearts! Only a few Americans of 1836\nbought this singular volume, but Emerson went serenely forward.\nHe had found his path.",
        "In 1837 he delivered the well-known Phi Beta Kappa oration at\nHarvard on “The American Scholar.” Emerson was now thirty-four;\nhe had married a second time, had bought a house of his own in\nConcord, and purposed to make a living by lecturing and writing.\nHis address in Cambridge, though it contained no reference to\nhimself, was after all a justification of the way of life he had\nchosen: a declaration of intellectual independence for himself\nand his countrymen, an exhortation of self-trust to the\nindividual thinking man. “If the single man plant himself\nindomitably on his instincts and there abide, the huge world will\ncome round to him.” Such advice to cut loose from the moorings of\nthe past was not unknown in Phi Beta Kappa orations, though it\nhad never been so brilliantly phrased; but when Emerson applied\nprecisely the same doctrine, in 1838, to the graduating class at\nthe Harvard Divinity School, he roused a storm of disapproval. “A\ntempest in our washbowl,” he wrote coolly to Carlyle, but it was\nmore than that. The great sentence of the Divinity School\naddress, “God is, not was; he speaketh, not spake,” was the\nemphasis of a superb rhetorician upon the immediacy of the soul’s\naccess to God. It has been the burden of a thousand prophets in\nall religions. The young priests of the Divinity School, their\neyes wearied with Hebrew and Greek, seem to have enjoyed\nEmerson’s injunction to turn away from past records and\nhistorical authorities and to drink from the living fountain of\nthe divine within themselves; but to the professors, “the stern\nold war-gods,” this relative belittlement of historical\nChristianity seemed blasphemy. A generation passed before Emerson\nwas again welcomed by his alma mater.",
        "The reader who has mastered those three utterances by the Concord\nTranscendentalist in 1836, 1837, and 1838 has the key to Emerson.\nHe was a seer, not a system-maker. The constitution of his mind\nforbade formal, consecutive, logical thought. He was not a\nphilosopher in the accepted sense, though he was always\nphilosophizing, nor a metaphysician in spite of his curious\nsearchings in the realm of metaphysics. He sauntered in books as\nhe sauntered by Walden Pond, in quest of what interested him; he\n\"fished in Montaigne,” he said, as he fished in Plato and Goethe.\nHe basketed the day’s luck, good or bad as it might be, into the\npages of his private “Journal,” which he called his savings-bank,\nbecause from this source he drew most of the material for his\nbooks. The “Journal” has recently been printed, in ten volumes.\nNo American writing rewards the reader more richly. It must be\nremembered that Emerson’s “Essays,” the first volume of which\nappeared in 1841, and the last volumes after his death in 1882,\nrepresent practically three stages of composition: first the\ndetached thoughts of the “Journal;” second, the rearrangement of\nthis material for use upon the lecture platform; and finally, the\nessays in their present form. The oral method thus predominates:\na series of oracular thoughts has been shaped for oratorical\nutterance, not oratorical in the bombastic, popular American\nsense, but cunningly designed, by a master of rhetoric, to\ncapture the ear and then the mind of the auditor.",
        "Emerson’s work as a lecturer coincided with the rise of that\nLyceum system which brought most of the American authors, for\nmore than a generation, into intimate contact with the public,\nand which proved an important factor in the aesthetic and moral\ncultivation of our people. No lecturer could have had a more\nauspicious influence than Emerson, with his quiet dignity, his\nserene spiritual presence, his tonic and often electrifying\nforce. But if he gave his audiences precious gifts, he also\nlearned much from them. For thirty years his lecturing trips to\nthe West brought him, more widely than any New England man of\nletters, into contact with the new, virile America of the great\nMississippi valley. Unlike many of his friends, he was not\nrepelled by the “Jacksonism of the West\"; he rated it a\nwholesome, vivifying force in our national thought and life. The\n\"Journal” reveals the essential soundness of his Americanism.\nThough surrounded all his life by reformers, he was himself\nscarcely a reformer, save upon the single issue of anti-slavery.\nPerhaps he was at bottom too much of a radical to be swept off\nhis feet by any reform.",
        "To our generation, of course, Emerson presents himself as an\nauthor of books, and primarily as an essayist, rather than as a\nwinning, entrancing speaker. His essays have a greater variety of\ntone than is commonly recognized. Many of them, like “Manners,\"\n\"Farming,” “Books,” “Eloquence,” “Old Age,” exhibit a shrewd\nprudential wisdom, a sort of Yankee instinct for “the milk in the\npan,” that reminds one of Ben Franklin. Like most of the greater\nNew England writers, he could be, on occasion, an admirable local\nhistorian. See his essays on “Life and Letters in New England,\"\n\"New England Reformers,” “Politics,” and the successive entries\nin his “Journal\" relating to Daniel Webster. He had the happiest\ngift of portraiture, as is witnessed by his sketches of\nMontaigne, of Napoleon, of Socrates (in the essay on Plato), of\nhis aunt Mary Moody Emerson, of Thoreau, and of various types of\nEnglishmen in his “English Traits.” But the great essays, no\ndoubt, are those like “Self-Reliance,” “Compensation,” “The\nOver-Soul,” “Fate,” “Power,” “Culture,” “Worship,” and\n\"Illusions.” These will puzzle no one who has read carefully that\nfirst book on “Nature.” They all preach the gospel of intuition,\ninstinctive trust in the Universe, faith in the ecstatic moment\nof vision into the things that are unseen by the physical eye.\nSelf-reliance, as Emerson’s son has pointed out, means really\nGod-reliance; the Over-Soul–always a stumbling-block to\nPhilistines–means that high spiritual life into which all men\nmay enter and in which they share the life of Deity. Emerson is\nstern enough in expounding the laws of compensation that run\nthrough the universe, but to him the chief law is the law of the\never-ascending, victorious soul.",
        "This radiant optimism permeates his poems. By temperament a\nsinger as well as a seer and sayer, Emerson was nevertheless\ndeficient in the singing voice. He composed no one great poem,\nhis verse presents no ideas that are not found in his prose. In\nmetre and rhyme he is harsh and willful. Yet he has marvelous\nsingle phrases and cadences. He ejaculates transports and\necstasies, and though he cannot organize and construct in verse,\nhe is capable here and there of the true miracle of transforming\nfact and thought into true beauty. Aldrich used to say that he\nwould rather have written Emerson’s “Bacchus” than any American\npoem.",
        "That the pure, high, and tonic mind of Emerson was universal in\nits survey of human forces, no one would claim. Certain\nlimitations in interest and sympathy are obvious. “That horrid\nburden and impediment of the soul which the churches call sin,\"\nto use John Morley’s words, occupied his attention but little.\nLike a mountain climber in a perilous pass, he preferred to look\nup rather than down. He does not stress particularly those old\nhuman words, service and sacrifice. “Anti-scientific, antisocial,\nanti-Christian” are the terms applied to him by one of his most\npenetrating critics. Yet I should prefer to say “un-scientific,\"\n\"unsocial,” and “non-Christian,” in the sense in which Plato and\nIsaiah are non-Christian. Perhaps it would be still nearer the\ntruth to say, as Mrs. Lincoln said of her husband, “He was not a\ntechnical Christian.” He tends to underestimate institutions of\nevery kind; history, except as a storehouse of anecdote, and\nculture as a steady mental discipline. This is the price he pays\nfor his transcendental insistence upon the supreme value of the\nNow, the moment of insight. But after all these limitations are\nproperly set down, the personality of Ralph Waldo Emerson remains\na priceless possession to his countrymen. The austere serenity of\nhis life, and the perfection with which he represents the highest\ntype of his province and his era, will ultimately become blended\nwith the thought of his true Americanism. A democrat and\nliberator, like Lincoln, he seems also destined like Lincoln to\nbecome increasingly a world’s figure, a friend and guide to\naspiring spirits everywhere. Differences of race and creed are\nnegligible in the presence of such superb confidence in God and\nthe soul.",
        "Citizens of Concord in May, 1862, hearing that Henry Thoreau, the\neccentric bachelor, had just died of consumption in his mother’s\nhouse on Main Street, in his forty-fifth year, would have smiled\ncannily at the notion that after fifty years their townsman’s\nliterary works would be published in a sumptuous twenty-volume\nedition, and that critics in his own country and in Europe would\nrank him with Ralph Waldo Emerson. Yet that is precisely what has\nhappened. Our literature has no more curious story than the\nevolution of this local crank into his rightful place of\nmastership. In his lifetime he printed only two books, “A Week on\nthe Concord and Merrimac Rivers\"–which was even more completely\nneglected by the public than Emerson’s “Nature\"–and “Walden,\"\nnow one of the classics, but only beginning to be talked about\nwhen its shy, proud author penned his last line and died with the\nwords “moose” and “Indian” on his lips.",
        "Thoreau, like all thinkers who reach below the surface of human\nlife, means many different things to men of various temperaments.\nCollectors of human novelties, like Stevenson, rejoice in his\nuniqueness of flavor; critics, like Lowell, place him, not\nwithout impatient rigor. To some readers he is primarily a\nnaturalist, an observer, of the White of Selborne school; to\nothers an elemental man, a lover of the wild, a hermit of the\nwoods. He has been called the poet-naturalist, to indicate that\nhis powers of observation were accompanied, like Wordsworth’s, by\na gift of emotional interpretation of the meaning of phenomena.\nLovers of literature celebrate his sheer force and penetration of\nphrase. But to the student of American thought Thoreau’s prime\nvalue lies in the courage and consistency with which he\nendeavored to realize the gospel of Transcendentalism in his own\ninner life.",
        "Lovers of racial traits like to remember that Thoreau’s\ngrandfather was an immigrant Frenchman from the island of Jersey,\nand that his grandmother was Scotch and Quaker. His father made\nlead pencils and ground plumbago in his own house in Concord. The\nmother was from New Hampshire. It was a high-minded family. All\nthe four children taught school and were good talkers. Henry,\nborn in 1817, was duly baptized by good Dr. Ripley of the Old\nManse, studied Greek and Latin, and was graduated at Harvard in\n1837, the year of Emerson’s Phi Beta Kappa address. Even in\ncollege the young man was a trifle difficult. “Cold and\nunimpressible,” wrote a classmate. “The touch of his hand was\nmoist and indifferent. He did not care for people.” “An\nunfavorable opinion has been entertained of his disposition to\nexert himself,” wrote President Quincy confidentially to Emerson\nin 1837, although the kindly President, a year later, in\nrecommending Thoreau as a school-teacher, certified that “his\nrank was high as a scholar in all the branches and his morals and\ngeneral conduct unexceptionable and exemplary.”",
        "Ten years passed. The young man gave up school-keeping, thinking\nit a loss of time. He learned pencil-making, surveying, and farm\nwork, and found that by manual labor for six weeks in the year he\ncould meet all the expenses of living. He haunted the woods and\npastures, explored rivers and ponds, built the famous hut on\nEmerson’s wood-lot with the famous axe borrowed from Alcott, was\nput in jail for refusal to pay his polltax, and, to sum up much\nin little, “signed off” from social obligations. “I, Henry D.\nThoreau, have signed off, and do not hold myself responsible to\nyour multifarious uncivil chaos named Civil Government.” When his\ncollege class held its tenth reunion in 1847, and each man was\nasked to send to the secretary a record of achievement, Thoreau\nwrote: “My steadiest employment, if such it can be called, is to\nkeep myself at the top of my condition and ready for whatever may\nturn up in heaven or on earth.” There is the motto of\nTranscendentalism, stamped upon a single coin.",
        "For “to be ready for whatever may turn up” is Thoreau’s racier,\nhomelier version of Emerson’s “endless seeker\"; and Thoreau, more\neasily than Emerson, could venture to stake everything upon the\nquest. The elder man had announced the programme, but by 1847 he\nwas himself almost what Thoreau would call a “committed man,\"\nwith family and household responsibilities, with a living to\nearn, and bound, like every professional writer and speaker, to\nhave some measure of regard for his public. But Thoreau was ready\nto travel lightly and alone. If he should fail in the great\nadventure for spiritual perfection, it was his own affair. He had\nno intimates, no confidant save the multitudinous pages of his\n\"Journal,” from which–and here again he followed Emerson’s\nexample–his future books were to be compiled. Many of his most\nloyal admirers will admit that such a quest is bound, by the very\nconditions of the problem, to be futile. Hawthorne allegorized it\nin “Ethan Brand,” and his quaint illustration of the folly of\nromantic expansion of the self apart from the common interests of\nhuman kind is the picture of a dog chasing its own tail. “It is\ntime now that I begin to live,” notes Thoreau in the “Journal,\"\nand he continued to say it in a hundred different ways until the\nend of all his journalizing, but he never quite captured the\nfugitive felicity. The haunting pathos of his own allegory has\nmoved every reader of “Walden:” “I long ago lost a hound, a bay\nhorse, and a turtle-dove, and am still on their trail.” Precisely\nwhat he meant it is now impossible to say, but surely he betrays\na doubt in the ultimate efficacy of his own system of life. He\nbends doggedly to the trail, for Henry Thoreau is no quitter, but\nthe trail leads nowhere, and in the latest volumes of the\n\"Journals” he seems to realize that he has been pursuing a\nphantom. He dived fearlessly and deep into himself, but somehow\nhe failed to grasp that pearl of great price which all the\ntranscendental prophets assured him was to be had at the cost of\ndiving.",
        "This is not to say that this austere and strenuous athlete came\nup quite empty-handed. Far from it. The byproducts of his toil\nwere enough to have enriched many lesser men, and they have given\nThoreau a secure fame. From his boyhood he longed to make himself\na writer, and an admirable writer he became. “For along time,” he\nsays in “Walden,” “I was reporter to a journal, of no very wide\ncirculation, whose editor has never seen fit to print the bulk of\nmy contributions, and, as is too common with writers, I got only\nmy labor for my pains. However, in this case my pains were their\nreward.” Like so many solitaries, he experienced the joy of\nintense, long-continued effort in composition, and he was artist\nenough to know that his pages, carefully assembled from his note\nbooks, had pungency, form, atmosphere. No man of his day, not\neven Lowell the “last of the bookmen,” abandoned himself more\nunreservedly to the delight of reading. Thoreau was an\naccomplished scholar in the Greek and Roman classics, as his\ntranslations attest. He had some acquaintance with several modern\nlanguages, and at one time possessed the best collection of books\non Oriental literature to be found in America. He was drenched in\nthe English poetry of the seventeenth century. His critical\nessays in the “Dial,” his letters and the bookish allusions\nthroughout his writings, are evidence of rich harvesting in the\nrecords of the past. He left some three thousand manuscript pages\nof notes on the American Indians, whose history and character had\nfascinated him from boyhood. Even his antiquarian hobbies gave\nhim durable satisfaction. Then, too, he had deep delight in his\nlife-long studies in natural history, in his meticulous\nmeasurements of river currents, in his notes upon the annual\nflowering of plants and the migration of birds. The more\nthoroughly trained naturalists of our own day detect him now and\nagain in error as to his birds and plants, just as specialists in\nMaine woodcraft discover that he made amusing, and for him\nunaccountable, blunders when he climbed Katahdin. But if he was\nnot impeccable as a naturalist or woodsman, who has ever had more\nfun out of his enthusiasm than Thoreau, and who has ever\nstimulated as many men and women in the happy use of their eyes?\nHe would have had slight patience with much of the sentimental\nnature study of our generation, and certainly an intellectual\ncontempt for much that we read and write about the call of the\nwild; but no reader of his books can escape his infection for the\nfreedom of the woods, for the stark and elemental in nature.\nThoreau’s passion for this aspect of life may have been selfish,\nwolflike, but it is still communicative.",
        "Once, toward the close of his too brief life, Thoreau “signed on\"\nagain to an American ideal, and no man could have signed more\nnobly. It was the cause of Freedom, as represented by John Brown\nof Harper’s Ferry. The French and Scotch blood in the furtive\nhermit suddenly grew hot. Instead of renouncing in disgust the\n\"uncivil chaos called Civil Government,” Thoreau challenged it to\na fight. Indeed he had already thrown down the gauntlet in\n\"Slavery in Massachusetts,” which Garrison had published in the\n\"Liberator” in 1854. And now the death upon the scaffold of the\nold fanatic of Ossawatomie changed Thoreau into a complete\ncitizen, arguing the case and glorifying to his neighbors the\ndead hero. “It seems as if no man had ever died in America\nbefore; for in order to die you must first have lived . . . . I\nhear a good many pretend that they are going to die . . . .\nNonsense! I’ll defy them to do it. They haven’t got life enough\nin them. They’ll deliquesce like fungi, and keep a hundred\neulogists mopping the spot where they left off. Only half a dozen\nor so have died since the world began.” Such passages as this\nreveal a very different Thoreau from the Thoreau who is supposed\nto have spent his days in the company of swamp-blackbirds and\nwoodchucks. He had, in fact, one of the highest qualifications\nfor human society, an absolute honesty of mind. “We select\ngranite,” he says, “for the underpinning of our houses and barns;\nwe build fences of stone; but we do not ourselves rest on an\nunderpinning of granite truth, the lowest primitive rock. Our\nsills are rotten . . . . In proportion as our inward life fails,\nwe go more constantly and desperately to the postoffice. You may\ndepend upon it, that the poor fellow who walks away with the\ngreatest number of letters, proud of his extensive\ncorrespondence, has not heard from himself this long time.”",
        "This hard, basic individualism was for Thoreau the foundation of\nall enduring social relations, and the dullest observer of\ntwentieth century America can see that Thoreau’s doctrine is\nneeded as much as ever. His sharp-edged personality provokes\ncuriosity and pricks the reader into dissent or emulation as the\ncase may be, but its chief ethical value to our generation lies\nin the fact that here was a Transcendentalist who stressed, not\nthe life of the senses, though he was well aware of their\nseductiveness, but the stubborn energy of the will.",
        "The scope of the present book prevents more than a glimpse at the\nother members of the New England Transcendental group. They are a\nvery mixed company, noble, whimsical, queer, impossible. “The\ngood Alcott,” wrote Carlyle, “with his long, lean face and\nfigure, with his gray worn temples and mild radiant eyes; all\nbent on saving the world by a return to acorns and the golden\nage; he comes before one like a venerable Don Quixote, whom\nnobody can laugh at without loving.” These words paint a whole\ncompany, as well as a single man. The good Alcott still awaits an\nadequate biographer. Connecticut Yankee, peddler in the South,\nschool-teacher in Boston and elsewhere, he descended upon\nConcord, flitted to the queer community of Fruitlands, was\nstarved back to Concord, inspired and bored the patient Emerson,\ntalked endlessly, wrote ineffective books, and had at last his\napotheosis in the Concord School of Philosophy, but was chiefly\nknown for the twenty years before his death in 1888 as the father\nof the Louisa Alcott who wrote “Little Women.” “A tedious\narchangel,” was Emerson’s verdict, and it is likely to stand.",
        "Margaret Fuller, though sketched by Hawthorne, analyzed by\nEmerson, and painted at full length by Thomas Wentworth\nHigginson, is now a fading figure–a remarkable woman, no doubt,\none of the first of American feminists, suggesting George Eliot\nin her physical unattractiveness, her clear brain, her touch of\nsensuousness. She was an early-ripe, over-crammed scholar in the\nclassics and in modern European languages. She did loyal, unpaid\nwork as the editor of the “Dial,” which from 1840 to 1844 was the\norgan of Transcendentalism. She joined the community at Brook\nFarm, whose story has been so well told by Lindsay Swift. For a\nwhile she served as literary editor of the “New York Tribune\"\nunder Horace Greeley. Then she went abroad, touched Rousseau’s\nmanuscripts at Paris with trembling, adoring fingers, made a\nsecret marriage in Italy with the young Marquis Ossoli, and\nperished by shipwreck, with her husband and child, off Fire\nIsland in 1850.",
        "Theodore Parker, like Alcott and “Margaret,” an admirable Greek\nscholar, an idealist and reformer, still lives in Chadwick’s\nbiography, in Colonel Higginson’s delightful essay, and in the\nmemories of a few liberal Bostonians who remember his tremendous\nsermons on the platform of the old Music Hall. He was a Lexington\nfarmer’s son, with the temperament of a blacksmith, with\nenormous, restless energy, a good hater, a passionate lover of\nall excellent things save meekness. He died at fifty, worn out,\nin Italy.",
        "But while these three figures were, after Emerson and Thoreau,\nthe most representative of the group, the student of the\nTranscendental period will be equally interested in watching its\ninfluence upon many other types of young men: upon future\njournalists and publicists like George William Curtis, Charles A.\nDana, and George Ripley; upon religionists like Orestes Brownson,\nFather Hecker, and James Freeman Clarke; and upon poets like\nJones Very, Christopher. P. Cranch, and Ellery Channing. There\nwas a sunny side of the whole movement, as T. W. Higginson and F.\nB. Sanborn, two of the latest survivors of the ferment, loved to\nemphasize in their talk and in their books; and it was shadowed\nalso by tragedy and the pathos of unfulfilled desires. But as one\nlooks back at it, in the perspective of three-quarters of a\ncentury, it seems chiefly something touchingly fine. For all\nthese men and women tried to hitch their wagon to a star.",
        "Moving in and out of the Transcendentalist circles, in that great\ngeneration preceding the Civil War, were a company of other\nmen–romancers, poets, essayists, historians–who shared in the\nintellectual liberalism of the age, but who were more purely\nartists in prose and verse than they were seekers after the\nunattainable. Hawthorne, for example, sojourned at Concord and at\nBrook Farm with some of the most extreme types of transcendental\nextravagance. The movement interested him artistically and he\nutilized it in his romances, but personally he maintained an\nattitude of cool detachment from it. Longfellow was too much of\nan artist to lose his head over philosophical abstractions;\nWhittier, at his best, had a too genuine poetic instinct for the\nconcrete; and Lowell and Holmes had the saving gift of humor.\nCultivated Boston gentlemen like Prescott, Motley, and Parkman\npreferred to keep their feet on the solid earth and write\nadmirable histories. So the mellow years went by. Most of the\nwidely-read American books were being produced within twenty\nmiles of the Boston State House. The slavery issue kept growling,\nfar away, but it was only now and then, as in the enforcement of\nthe Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, that it was brought sharply home\nto the North. The “golden forties” were as truly golden for New\nEngland as for idle California. There was wealth, leisure, books,\na glow of harvest-time in the air, though the spirit of the\nwriters is the spirit of youth.",
        "Nathaniel Hawthorne, our greatest writer of pure romance, was\nPuritan by inheritance and temperament, though not in doctrine or\nin sympathy. His literary affiliations were with the English and\nGerman Romanticists, and he possessed, for professional use, the\nideas and vocabulary of his transcendental friends. Born in Salem\nin 1804, he was descended from Judge Hawthorne of Salem\nWitchcraft fame, and from a long line of sea-faring ancestors. He\ninherited a morbid solitariness, redeemed in some measure by a\nphysical endowment of rare strength and beauty. He read Spenser,\nRousseau, and the “Newgate Calendar,” was graduated at Bowdoin,\nwith Longfellow, in the class of 1825, and returned to Salem for\nthirteen brooding lonely years in which he tried to teach himself\nthe art of story-writing. His earliest tales, like Irving’s, are\nessays in which characters emerge; he is absorbed in finding a\nsetting for a preconceived “moral\"; he is in love with allegory\nand parable. His own words about his first collection of stories,\n\"Twice-Told Tales,” have often been quoted: “They have the pale\ntint of flowers that blossomed in too retired a shade.” Yet they\nare for the most part exquisitely written. After a couple of\nyears in the Boston Custom-House, and a residence at the\nsocialistic community of Brook Farm, Hawthorne made the happiest\nof marriages to Sophia Peabody, and for nearly four years dwelt\nin the Old Manse at Concord. He described it in one of the ripest\nof his essays, the Preface to “Mosses from an Old Manse,” his\nsecond collection of stories. After three years in the\nCustom-House at Salem, his dismissal in 1849 gave him leisure to\nproduce his masterpiece, “The Scarlet Letter,” published in 1850.\nHe was now forty-six. In 1851, he published “The House of the\nSeven Gables,” “The Wonder-Book,” and “The Snow Image, and Other\nTales.” In 1852 came “The Blithedale Romance,” a rich ironical\nstory drawn from his Brook Farm experience. Four years in the\nAmerican Consulate at Liverpool and three subsequent years of\nresidence upon the Continent saw no literary harvest except\ncarefully filled notebooks and the deeply imaginative moral\nromance, “The Marble Faun.” Hawthorne returned home in 1860 and\nsettled in the Wayside at Concord, busying himself with a new,\nand, as was destined, a never completed story about the elixir of\nimmortality. But his vitality was ebbing, and in May, 1864, he\npassed away in his sleep. He rests under the pines in Sleepy\nHollow, near the Alcotts and the Emersons.",
        "It is difficult for contemporary Americans to assess the value of\nsuch a man, who evidently did nothing except to write a few\nbooks. His rare, delicate genius was scarcely touched by passing\nevents. Not many of his countrymen really love his writings, as\nthey love, for instance the writings of Dickens or Thackeray or\nStevenson. Everyone reads, at some time of his life, “The Scarlet\nLetter,” and trembles at its passionate indictment of the sin of\nconcealment, at its agonized admonition, “Be true! Be true!\"\nPerhaps the happiest memories of Hawthorne’s readers, as of\nKipling’s readers, hover about his charming stories for children;\nto have missed “The Wonder-Book” is like having grown old without\never catching the sweetness of the green world at dawn. But our\npublic has learned to enjoy a wholly different kind of style,\ntaught by the daily journals, a nervous, graphic, sensational,\nphysical style fit for describing an automobile, a department\nstore, a steamship, a lynching party. It is the style of our day,\nand judged by it Hawthorne, who wrote with severity, conscience,\nand good taste, seems somewhat old-fashioned, like Irving or\nAddison. He is perhaps too completely a New Englander to be\nunderstood by men of other stock, and has never, like Poe and\nWhitman, excited strong interest among European minds.",
        "Yet no American is surer, generation after generation, of finding\na fit audience. Hawthorne’s genius was meditative rather than\ndramatic. His artistic material was moral rather than physical;\nhe brooded over the soul of man as affected by this and that\ncondition and situation. The child of a new analytical age, he\nthought out with rigid accuracy the precise circumstances\nsurrounding each one of his cases and modifying it. Many of his\nsketches and short stories and most of his romances deal with\nhistorical facts, moods, and atmospheres, and he knew the past of\nNew England as few men have ever known it. There is solid\nhistorical and psychological stuff as the foundation of his\nair-castles. His latent radicalism furnished him with a\ntouchstone of criticism as he interpreted the moral standards of\nancient communities; no reader of “The Scarlet Letter” can forget\nHawthorne’s implicit condemnation of the unimaginative harshness\nof the Puritans. His own judgment upon the deep matters of the\nhuman conscience was stern enough, but it was a universalized\njudgment, and by no means the result of a Calvinism which he\nhated. Over-fond as he was in his earlier tales of elaborate,\nfanciful, decorative treatment of themes that promised to point a\nmoral, in his finest short stories, such as “The Ambitious\nGuest,” “The Gentle Boy,” “Young Goodman Brown,” “The Snow\nImage,\"\n\"The Great Stone Face,” “Drowne’s Wooden Image,” “Rappacini’s\nDaughter,” the moral, if there be one, is not obtruded. He loves\nphysical symbols for mental and moral states, and was poet and\nTranscendentalist enough to retain his youthful affection for\nparables; but his true field as a story-teller is the erring,\nquesting, aspiring, shadowed human heart.",
        "“The Scarlet Letter,” for instance, is a study of a universal\ntheme, the problem of concealed sin, punishment, redemption. Only\nthe setting is provincial. The story cannot be rightly estimated,\nit is true, without remembering the Puritan reverence for\nphysical purity, the Puritan reverence for the\nmagistrate-minister–differing so widely from the respect of\nLatin countries for the priest–the Puritan preoccupation with\nthe\nlife of the soul, or, as more narrowly construed by Calvinism,\nthe problem of evil. The word Adultery, although suggestively\nenough present in one of the finest symbolical titles ever\ndevised by a romancer, does not once occur in the book. The sins\ndealt with are hypocrisy and revenge. Arthur Dimmesdale, Hester\nPrynne, and Roger Chillingworth are developing, suffering, living\ncreatures, caught inextricably in the toils of a moral situation.\nBy an incomparable succession of pictures Hawthorne exhibits the\ntravail of their souls. In the greatest scene of all, that\nbetween Hester and Arthur in the forest, the Puritan framework of\nthe story gives way beneath the weight of human passion, and we\nseem on the verge of another and perhaps larger solution than was\nactually worked out by the logic of succeeding events. But\nthough the book has been called Christless, prayerless, hopeless,\nno mature person ever reads it without a deepened sense of the\nimpotence of all mechanistic theories of sin, and a new vision of\nthe intense reality of spiritual things. “The law we broke,” in\nDimmesdale’s ghostly words, was a more subtle law than can be\ngraven on tables of stone and numbered as the Seventh\nCommandment.",
        "The legacy of guilt is likewise the theme of “The House of the\nSeven Gables,” which Hawthorne himself was inclined to think a\nbetter book than “The Scarlet Letter.” Certainly this story of\nold Salem is impeccably written and its subtle handling of tone\nand atmosphere is beyond dispute. An ancestral curse, the\nvisitation of the sins of the fathers upon the children, the\ngradual decay of a once sound stock, are motives that Ibsen might\nhave developed. But the Norseman would have failed to rival\nHawthorne’s delicate manipulation of his shadows, and the no less\nmasterly deftness of the ultimate mediation of a dark inheritance\nthrough the love of the light-hearted Phoebe for the latest\ndescendant of the Maules. In “The Blithedale Romance” Hawthorne\nstood for once, perhaps, too near his material to allow the rich\natmospheric effects which he prefers, and in spite of the\nunforgetable portrait of Zenobia and powerful passages of\nrealistic description, the book is not quite focussed. In “The\nMarble Faun” Hawthorne comes into his own again. Its central\nproblem is one of those dark insoluble ones that he loves: the\ninfluence of a crime upon the development of a soul. Donatello,\nthe Faun, is a charming young creature of the natural sunshine\nuntil his love for the somber Miriam tempts him to the commission\nof murder: then begins the growth of his mind and character.\nPerhaps the haunting power of the main theme of the book has\ncontributed less to its fame than the felicity of its\ndescriptions of Rome and Italy. For Hawthorne possessed, like\nByron, in spite of his defective training in the appreciation of\nthe arts, a gift of romantic discernment which makes “The Marble\nFaun,” like “Childe Harold,” a glorified guide-book to the\nEternal City.",
        "All of Hawthorne’s books, in short, have a central core of\npsychological romance, and a rich surface finish of description.\nHis style, at its best, has a subdued splendor of coloring which\nis only less wonderful than the spiritual perceptions with which\nthis magician was endowed. The gloom which haunts many of his\npages, as I have said elsewhere, is the long shadow cast by our\nmortal destiny upon a sensitive soul. The mystery is our mystery,\nperceived, and not created, by that finely endowed mind and\nheart. The shadow is our shadow; the gleams of insight, the soft\nradiance of truth and beauty, are his own.",
        "A college classmate of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow summed up the\nPortland boy’s character in one sentence: “It appeared easy for\nhim to avoid the unworthy.” Born in 1807, of Mayflower stock that\nhad distinguished itself for bravery and uprightness, the youth\nwas graduated from Bowdoin at eighteen. Like his classmate\nHawthorne, he had been a wide and secretly ambitious reader, and\nhad followed the successive numbers of Irving’s “Sketch Book,” he\ntells us, “with ever increasing wonder and delight.” His college\noffered him in 1826 a professorship of the modern languages, and\nhe spent three happy years in Europe in preparation. He taught\nsuccessfully at Bowdoin for five or six years, and for eighteen\nyears, 1836 to 1854, served as George Ticknor’s successor at\nHarvard, ultimately surrendering the chair to Lowell. He early\npublished two prose volumes, “Hyperion” and “Outre-mer,\"\nIrvingesque romances of European travel. Then came, after ten\nyears of teaching and the death of his young wife, the sudden\nimpulse to write poetry, and he produced, “softly excited, I know\nnot why,” “The Reaper and the Flowers, a Psalm of Death.” From\nthat December morning in 1838 until his death in 1882 he was\nLongfellow the Poet.",
        "His outward life, like Hawthorne’s, was barren of dramatic\nincident, save the one tragic accident by which his second wife,\nthe mother of his children, perished before his eyes in 1861. He\nbore the calamity with the quiet courage of his race and\nbreeding. But otherwise his days ran softly and gently, enriched\nwith books and friendships, sheltered from the storms of\ncircumstance. He had leisure to grow ripe, to remember, and to\ndream. But he never secluded himself, like Tennyson, from normal\ncontacts with his fellowmen. The owner of the Craigie House was a\ngood neighbor, approachable and deferential. He was even\ninterested in local Cambridge politics. On the larger political\nissues of his day his Americanism was sound and loyal. “It is\ndisheartening,” he wrote in his Cambridge journal for 1851, “to\nsee how little sympathy there is in the hearts of the young men\nhere for freedom and great ideas.” But his own sympathy never\nwavered. His linguistic talent helped him to penetrate the\nsecrets of alien ways of thought and speech. He understood Italy\nand Spain, Holland and France and Germany. He had studied them on\nthe lips of their living men and women and in the books where\nsoldier and historian, priest and poet, had inscribed the record\nof five hundred years. From the Revival of Learning to the middle\nof the nineteenth century, Longfellow knew the soul of Europe as\nfew men have known it, and he helped to translate Europe to\nAmerica. His intellectual receptivity, his quick eye for color\nand costume and landscape, his ear for folklore and ballad, his\nown ripe mastery of words, made him the most resourceful of\ninternational interpreters. And this lover of children, walking\nin quiet ways, this refined and courteous host and gentleman,\nscholar and poet, exemplified without self-advertisement the\nricher qualities of his own people. When Couper’s statue of\nLongfellow was dedicated in Washington, Hamilton Mabie said: “His\nfreedom from the sophistication of a more experienced country;\nhis simplicity, due in large measure to the absence of social\nself-consciousness; his tranquil and deep-seated optimism, which\nis the effluence of an unexhausted soil; his happy and confident\nexpectation, born of a sense of tremendous national vitality; his\nlove of simple things in normal relations to world-wide interests\nof the mind; his courage in interpreting those deeper experiences\nwhich craftsmen who know art but who do not know life call\ncommonplaces; the unaffected and beautiful democracy of his\nspirit–these are the delicate flowers of our new world, and as\nmuch a part of it as its stretches of wilderness and the\ncontinental roll of its rivers.”",
        "Longfellow’s poetic service to his countrymen has thus become a\nnational asset, and not merely because in his three best known\nnarrative poems, “Evangeline,” “Hiawatha,” and “The Courtship of\nMiles Standish,” he selected his themes from our own history.\n\"The Building of the Ship,” written with full faith in the\ntroubled year of 1849, is a national anthem. “It is a wonderful\ngift,” said Lincoln, as he listened to it, his eyes filled with\ntears, “to be able to stir men like that.” “The Skeleton in\nArmor,” “A Ballad of the French Fleet,” “Paul Revere’s Ride,\"\n\"The Wreck of the Hesperus,” are ballads that stir men still. For\nall of his skill in story-telling in verse–witness the “Tales of\na Wayside Inn\"–Longfellow was not by nature a dramatist, and his\ntrilogy now published under the title of “Christus,” made up of\n\"The Divine Tragedy,” “The Golden Legend,” and “New England\nTragedies,” added little to a reputation won in other fields. His\nsonnets, particularly those upon “Chaucer,” “Milton,” “The Divina\nCommedia,” “A Nameless Grave,” “Felton,” “Sumner,” “Nature,” “My\nBooks,” are among the imperishable treasures of the English\nlanguage. In descriptive pieces like “Keramos” and “The Hanging\nof the Crane,” in such personal and occasional verses as “The\nHerons of Elmwood,” “The Fiftieth Birthday of Agassiz,” and the\nnoble “Morituri Salutamus” written for his classmates in 1875, he\nexhibits his tenderness of affection and all the ripeness of his\ntechnical skill. But it was as a lyric poet, after all, that he\nwon and held his immense audience throughout the English-speaking\nworld. Two of the most popular of all his early pieces, “The\nPsalm of Life” and “Excelsior,” have paid the price of a too apt\nadjustment to the ethical mood of an earnest moment in our\nnational life. We have passed beyond them. And many readers may\nhave outgrown their youthful pleasure in “Maidenhood,” “The Rainy\nDay,” “The Bridge,” “The Day is Done,” verses whose simplicity\nlent themselves temptingly to parody. Yet such poems as “The\nBelfry of Bruges,” “Seaweed,” “The Fire of Driftwood,” “The\nArsenal at Springfield,” “My Lost Youth,” “The Children’s Hour,\"\nand many another lyric, lose nothing with the lapse of time.\nThere is fortunately infinite room for personal preference in\nthis whole matter of poetry, but the confession of a lack of\nregard for Longfellow’s verse must often be recognized as a\nconfession of a lessening love for what is simple, graceful, and\nrefined. The current of contemporary American taste, especially\namong consciously clever, half-trained persons, seems to be\nrunning against Longfellow. How soon the tide may turn, no one\ncan say. Meanwhile he has his tranquil place in the Poet’s Corner\nof Westminster Abbey. The Abbey must be a pleasant spot to wait\nin, for the Portland boy.",
        "Oddly enough, some of the over-sophisticated and\nunder-experienced people who affect to patronize Longfellow\nassume toward John Greenleaf Whittier an air of deference. This\nattitude would amuse the Quaker poet. One can almost see his dark\neyes twinkle and the grim lips tighten in that silent laughter in\nwhich the old man so much resembled Cooper’s Leather-Stocking.\nWhittier knew that his friend Longfellow was a better artist than\nhimself, and he also knew, by intimate experience as a maker of\npublic opinion, how variable are its judgments. Whittier\nrepresents a stock different from that of the Longfellows, but\nequally American, equally thoroughbred: the Essex County Quaker\nfarmer of Massachusetts. The homestead in which he was born in\n1807, at East Haverhill, had been built by his\ngreat-great-grandfather in 1688. Mount Vernon in Virginia and the\nCraigie House in Cambridge are newer than this by two\ngenerations. The house has been restored to the precise aspect it\nhad in Whittier’s boyhood: and the garden, lawn, and brook, even\nthe door-stone and bridle-post and the barn across the road are\nwitnesses to the fidelity of the descriptions in “Snow-Bound.\"\nThe neighborhood is still a lonely one. The youth grew up in\nseclusion, yet in contact with a few great ideas, chief among\nthem Liberty. “My father,” he said, “was an old-fashioned\nDemocrat, and really believed in the Preamble of the Bill of\nRights which reaffirmed the Declaration of Independence.” The\ntaciturn father transmitted to his sons a hatred of kingcraft and\npriestcraft, the inward moral freedom of the Quaker touched with\nhumanitarian passion. The spirit of a boyhood in this homestead\nis veraciously told in “The Barefoot Boy,” “School-Days,\"\n\"Snow-Bound,” “Ramoth Hill,” and “Telling the Bees.” It was a\nchance copy of Burns that revealed to the farmer lad his own\ndesire and capacity for verse-writing. When he was nineteen, his\nsister sent his “Exile’s Departure” to William Lloyd Garrison,\nthen twenty, and the editor of the “Newburyport Free Press.” The\nneighbors liked it, and the tall frail author was rewarded with a\nterm at the Haverhill Academy, where he paid his way, in old\nEssex County fashion, by making shoes.",
        "He had little more formal schooling than this, was too poor to\nenter college, but had what he modestly called a “knack at\nrhyming,” and much facility in prose. He turned to journalism and\npolitics, for which he possessed a notable instinct. For a while\nhe thought he had “done with poetry and literature.” Then in\n1833, at twenty-six, came Garrison’s stirring letter bidding him\nenlist in the cause of Anti-Slavery. He obeyed the call, not\nknowing that this new allegiance to the service of humanity was\nto transform him from a facile local verse-writer into a national\npoet. It was the ancient miracle of losing one’s life and finding\nit. For the immediate sacrifice was very real to a youth trained\nin quietism and non-resistance, and well aware, as a Whig\njournalist, of the ostracism visited upon the active\nAbolitionists. Whittier entered the fight with absolute courage\nand with the shrewdest practical judgment of weapons and tactics.\nHe forgot himself. He turned aside from those pleasant fields of\nNew England legend and history to which he was destined to return\nafter his warfare was accomplished. He had read the prose of\nMilton and of Burke. He perceived that negro emancipation in the\nUnited States was only a single and immediate phase of a\nuniversal movement of liberalism. The thought kindled his\nimagination. He wrote, at white heat, political and social verse\nthat glowed with humanitarian passion: lyrics in praise of\nfellow-workers, salutes to the dead, campaign songs, hymns,\nsatires against the clergy and the capitalists, superb sectional\npoems like “Massachusetts to Virginia,” and, more nobly still,\npoems embodying what Wordsworth called “the sensation and image\nof country and the human race.”",
        "Whittier had now “found himself” as a poet. It is true that his\nstyle remained diffuse and his ear faulty, but his countrymen,\nthen as now uncritical of artistic form, overlooked the blemishes\nof his verse, and thought only of his vibrant emotion, his scorn\nof cowardice and evil, his prophetic exaltation. In 1847 came the\nfirst general collection of his poems, and here were to be found\nnot merely controversial verses, but spirited “Songs of Labor,\"\npictures of the lovely Merrimac countryside, legends written in\nthe mood of Hawthorne or Longfellow, and bright bits of foreign\nlore and fancy. For though Whittier never went abroad, his quiet\nlife at Amesbury gave him leisure for varied reading, and he\nfollowed contemporary European politics with the closest\ninterest. He emerged more and more from the atmosphere of faction\nand section, and, though he retained to the last his Quaker\ncreed, he held its simple tenets in such undogmatic and winning\nfashion that his hymns are sung today in all the churches.",
        "When “The Atlantic Monthly” was established in 1857, Whittier was\nfifty. He took his place among the contributors to the new\nmagazine not as a controversialist but as a man of letters, with\nsuch poems as “Tritemius,” and “Skipper Ireson’s Ride.\"\nCharacteristic productions of this period are “My Psalm,\"\n\"Cobbler Keezar’s Vision,” “Andrew Rykman’s Prayer,” “The Eternal\nGoodness\"–poems grave, sweet, and tender. But it was not until\nthe publication of “Snow-Bound” in 1866 that Whittier’s work\ntouched its widest popularity. He had never married, and the\ndeaths of his mother and sister Elizabeth set him brooding, in\nthe desolate Amesbury house, over memories of his birthplace, six\nmiles away in East Haverhill. The homestead had gone out of the\nhands of the Whittiers, and the poet, nearing sixty, set himself\nto compose an idyll descriptive of the vanished past. No artist\ncould have a theme more perfectly adapted to his mood and to his\npowers. There are no novel ideas in “Snow-Bound,” nor is there\nany need of them, but the thousands of annual pilgrims to the old\nfarmhouse can bear witness to the touching intimacy, the homely\ncharm, the unerring rightness of feeling with which Whittier’s\ngenius recreated his own lost youth and painted for all time a\ntrue New England hearthside.",
        "Whittier was still to write nearly two hundred more poems, for he\nlived to be eighty-five, and he composed until the last. But his\ncreative period was now over. He rejoiced in the friendly\nrecognition of his work that came to him from every section of a\nreunited country. His personal friends were loyal in their\ndevotion. He followed the intricacies of American politics with\nthe keen zest of a veteran in that game, for in his time he had\nmade and unmade governors and senators. “The greatest politician\nI have ever met,” said James G. Blaine, who had certainly met\nmany. He had an income from his poems far in excess of his needs,\nbut retained the absolute simplicity of his earlier habits. When\nhis publishers first proposed the notable public dinner in honor\nof his seventieth birthday he demurred, explaining to a member of\nhis family that he did not want the bother of “buying a new pair\nof pants\"–a petty anecdote, but somehow refreshing. So the\nrustic, shrewd, gentle old man waited for the end. He had known\nwhat it means to toil, to fight, to renounce, to eat his bread in\ntears, and to see some of his dreams come true. We have had, and\nshall have, more accomplished craftsmen in verse, but we have\nnever bred a more genuine man than Whittier, nor one who had more\nkinship with the saints.",
        "A few days before Whittier’s death, he wrote an affectionate poem\nin celebration of the eighty-third birthday of his old friend of\nthe Saturday Club, Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes. This was in 1892.\nThe little Doctor, rather lonely in his latest years, composed\nsome tender obituary verses at Whittier’s passing. He had already\nperformed the same office for Lowell. He lingered himself until\nthe autumn of 1894, in his eighty-sixth year–\"The Last Leaf,” in\ntruth, of New England’s richest springtime.",
        "“No, my friends,” he had said in “The Autocrat of the Breakfast\nTable,” “I go (always, other things being equal) for the man who\ninherits family traditions and the cumulative humanities of at\nleast four or five generations.” The Doctor came naturally by his\npreference for a “man of family,” being one himself. He was a\ndescendant of Anne Bradstreet, the poetess. “Dorothy Q.,” whom he\nhad made the most picturesque of the Quincys, was his\ngreat-grandmother. Wendell Phillips was his cousin. His father,\nthe Rev. Abiel Holmes, a Yale graduate, was the minister of the\nFirst Church in Cambridge, and it was in its “gambrel-roofed\"\nparsonage that Oliver Wendell was born in 1809.",
        "“Know old Cambridge? Hope you do–\nBorn there? Don’t say so! I was, too.\nNicest place that was ever seen–\nColleges red and Common green.”",
        "So he wrote, in scores of passages of filial devotion, concerning\nthe village of his boyhood and the city of Boston. His best-known\nprose sentence is: “Boston State House is the hub of the Solar\nSystem.” It is easy to smile, as indeed he did himself, at such\nfond provinciality, but the fact remains that our literature as a\nwhole sadly needs this richness of local atmosphere. A nation of\nrestless immigrants, here today and “moved on” tomorrow, has the\nfibres of its imagination uprooted, and its artists in their\neager quest of “local color” purchase brilliancy at the cost of\nthinness of tone, poverty of association. Philadelphia and\nBoston, almost alone among the larger American cities, yield the\nsense of intimacy, or what the Autocrat would call “the\ncumulative humanities. “",
        "Young Holmes became the pet and the glory of his class of 1829 at\nHarvard. It was only in 1838 that their reunions began, but\nthereafter they held fifty-six meetings, of which Holmes attended\nfifty and wrote poems for forty-three. Many of “the Boys” whom he\ncelebrated became famous in their own right, but they remain “the\nBoys” to all lovers of Holmes’s verses. His own career as a poet\nhad begun during his single year in the Law School. His later\nyears brought him some additional skill in polishing his lines\nand a riper human wisdom, but his native verse-making talent is\nas completely revealed in “Old Ironsides,” published when he was\ntwenty-one, and in “The Last Leaf,” composed a year or two later,\nas in anything he was to write during the next half-century. In\nmany respects he was a curious survival of the cumulative\nhumanities of the eighteenth century. He might have been, like\ngood Dr. Arbuthnot, an ornament of the Augustan age. He shared\nwith the English Augustans a liking for the rhymed couplet, an\ninstinctive social sense, a feeling for the presence of an\nimaginary audience of congenial listeners. One still catches the\n\"Hear! Hear!” between his clever lines. In many of the traits of\nhis mind this “Yankee Frenchman” resembled such a typical\neighteenth century figure as Voltaire. Like Voltaire, he was\ntolerant–except toward Calvinism and Homeopathy. In some of the\ntricks of his prose style he is like a kindlier Sterne. His knack\nfor vers de societe was caught from Horace, but he would not have\nbeen a child of his own age without the additional gift of\nrhetoric and eloquence which is to be seen in his patriotic poems\nand his hymns. For Holmes possessed, in spite of all his\nlimitations in poetic range, true devotion, patriotism, humor,\nand pathos.",
        "His poetry was in the best sense of the word “occasional,” and\nhis prose was only an incidental or accidental harvest of a long\ncareer in which his chief duty was that of a professor of anatomy\nin the Harvard Medical School. He had studied in Paris under\nsound teachers, and after some years of private practice won the\nappointment which he held, as active and emeritus professor, for\nforty-seven years. He was a faithful, clear, and amusing\nlecturer, and printed two or three notable medical essays, but\nhis chief Boston reputation, in the eighteen-fifties, was that of\na wit and diner-out and writer of verses for occasions. Then came\nhis great hour of good luck in 1857, when Lowell, the editor of\nthe newly-established “Atlantic Monthly,” persuaded him to write\n\"The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table.” It was the public’s luck\nalso, for whoever had been so unfortunate as not to be born in\nBoston could now listen–as if across the table–to Boston’s best\ntalker. Few volumes of essays during the last sixty years have\ngiven more pleasure to a greater variety of readers than is\nyielded by “The Autocrat.” It gave the Doctor a reputation in\nEngland which he naturally prized, and which contributed to his\ntriumphal English progress, many years later, recorded pleasantly\nin “Our Hundred Days.” “The Professor at the Breakfast Table” and\n\"The Poet at the Breakfast Table” are less successful variations\nof “The Autocrat.” Neither professors nor poets are at their best\nat this meal. Holmes wrote three novels–of which “Elsie Venner,\"\na somewhat too medical story, is the best remembered–memoirs of\nhis friends Emerson and Motley, and many miscellaneous essays.\nHis life was exceptionally happy, and his cheery good opinion of\nhimself is still contagious. To pronounce the words Doctor Holmes\nin any company of intelligent Americans is the prologue to a\nsmile of recognition, comprehension, sympathy. The word Goldsmith\nhas now lost, alas, this provocative quality; the word Stevenson\nstill possesses it. The little Doctor, who died in the same year\nas Stevenson, belonged like him to the genial race of friends of\nmankind, and a few of his poems, and some gay warm-hearted pages\nof his prose, will long preserve his memory. But the Boston which\nhe loved has vanished as utterly as Sam Johnson’s London.",
        "James Russell Lowell was ten years younger than Holmes, and\nthough he died three years before the Doctor, he seems, for other\nreasons than those of chronology, to belong more nearly to the\npresent. Although by birth as much of a New England Brahmin as\nHolmes, and in his later years as much of a Boston and Cambridge\nidol, he nevertheless touched our universal American life on many\nsides, represented us worthily in foreign diplomacy, argued the\ncase of Democracy with convincing power, and embodied, as more\nperfect artists like Hawthorne and Longfellow could never have\ndone, the subtleties and potencies of the national temperament.\nHe deserves and reveals the closest scrutiny, but his personality\nis difficult to put on paper. Horace Scudder wrote his biography\nwith careful competence, and Ferris Greenslet has made him the\nsubject of a brilliant critical study. Yet readers differ widely\nin their assessment of the value of his prose and verse, and in\ntheir understanding of his personality.",
        "The external facts of his career are easy to trace and must be\nset down here with brevity. A minister’s son, and descended from\na very old and distinguished family, he was born at Elmwood in\nCambridge in 1819. After a somewhat turbulent course, he was\ngraduated from Harvard in 1838, the year of Emerson’s “Divinity\nSchool Address.” He studied law, turned Abolitionist, wrote\npoetry, married the beautiful and transcendental Maria White, and\ndid magazine work in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. He was\nthought by his friends in the eighteen-fifties to be “the most\nShakespearian” man in America. When he was ten years out of\ncollege, in 1848, he published “The Biglow Papers” (First\nSeries), “A Fable for Critics,” and “The Vision of Sir Launfal.\"\nAfter a long visit to Europe and the death of his wife, he gave\nsome brilliant Lowell Institute lectures in Boston, and was\nappointed Longfellow’s successor at Harvard. He went to Europe\nagain to prepare himself, and after entering upon his work as a\nteacher made a happy second marriage, served for four years as\nthe first editor of “The Atlantic,” and helped his friend Charles\nEliot Norton edit “The North American Review.” The Civil War\ninspired a second series of “Biglow Papers” and the magnificent\n\"Commemoration Ode” of 1865. Then came volume after volume of\nliterary essays, such as “Among My Books” and “My Study Windows,\"\nand an occasional book of verse. Again he made a long sojourn in\nEurope, resigned his Harvard professorship, and in 1877 was\nappointed Minister to Spain. After three years he was transferred\nto the most important post in our diplomatic service, London. He\nperformed his duties with extraordinary skill and success until\n1885, when he was relieved. His last years were spent in Elmwood,\nthe Cambridge house where he was born, and he was still writing,\nin almost as rich a vein as ever, when the end came in 1891.",
        "Here was certainly a full and varied life, responsive to many\npersonal moods and many tides of public feeling. Lowell drew\nintellectual stimulus from enormously wide reading in classical\nand modern literatures. Puritanically earnest by inheritance, he\nseems also to have inherited a strain of levity which he could\nnot always control, and, through his mother’s family, a dash of\nmysticism sometimes resembling second sight. His physical and\nmental powers were not always in the happiest mutual adjustment:\nhe became easily the prey of moods and fancies, and knew the\nalternations from wild gaiety of spirits to black despair. The\nfirm moral consistency of Puritanism was always his, yet his\nplayful remark about belonging in a hospital for incurable\nchildren had a measure of truth in it also.",
        "Both his poetry and his prose reveal a nature never quite\nintegrated into wholeness of structure, into harmony with itself.\nHis writing, at its best, is noble and delightful, full of human\ncharm, but it is difficult for him to master a certain\nwaywardness and to sustain any note steadily. This temperamental\nflaw does not affect the winsomeness of his letters, unless to\nadd to it. It is lost to view, often, in the sincerity and pathos\nof his lyrics, but it is felt in most of his longer efforts in\nprose, and accounts for a certain dissatisfaction which many\ngrateful and loyal readers nevertheless feel in his criticism.\nLowell was more richly endowed by nature and by breadth of\nreading than Matthew Arnold, for instance, but in the actual\nperformance of the critical function he was surpassed in method\nby Arnold and perhaps in inerrant perception, in a limited field,\nby Poe.",
        "It was as a poet, however, that he first won his place in our\nliterature, and it is by means of certain passages in the “Biglow\nPapers” and the “Commemoration Ode” that he has most moved his\ncountrymen. The effectiveness of The “Present Crisis” and “Sir\nLaunfal,” and of the “Memorial Odes,” particularly the “Ode to\nAgassiz,” is likewise due to the passion, sweetness, and splendor\nof certain strophes, rather than to the perfection of these poems\nas artistic wholes. Lowell’s personal lyrics of sorrow, such as\n\"The Changeling,” “The First SnowFall,” “After the Burial,” have\ntouched many hearts.",
        "His later lyrics are more subtle, weighted with thought, tinged\nwith autumnal melancholy. He was a most fertile composer, and,\nlike all the men of his time and group, produced too much. Yet\nhis patriotic verse was so admirable in feeling and is still so\ninspiring to his readers that one cannot wish it less in\nquantity; and in the field of political satire, such as the two\nseries of “Biglow Papers,” he had a theme and a method precisely\nsuited to his temperament. No American has approached Lowell’s\nsuccess in this difficult genre: the swift transitions from rural\nYankee humor to splendid scorn of evil and to noblest idealism\nreveal the full powers of one of our most gifted men. The\npreacher lurked in this Puritan from first to last, and the war\nagainst Mexico and the Civil War stirred him to the depths.",
        "His prose, likewise, is a school of loyalty. There was much of\nEurope in his learning, as his memorable Dante essay shows, and\nthe traditions of great English literature were the daily\ncompanions of his mind. He was bookish, as a bookman should be,\nand sometimes the very richness and whimsicality of his bookish\nfancies marred the simplicity and good taste of his pages. But\nthe fundamental texture of his thought and feeling was American,\nand his most characteristic style has the raciness of our soil.\nNature lovers like to point out the freshness and delicacy of his\nreaction to the New England scene. Thoreau himself, whom Lowell\ndid not like, was not more veracious an observer than the author\nof “Sunthin’ in the Pastoral Line,” “Cambridge Thirty Years Ago,\"\nand “My Garden Acquaintance.” Yet he watched men as keenly as he\ndid “laylocks” and bobolinks, and no shrewder American essay has\nbeen written than his “On a Certain Condescension in Foreigners.\"\nWit and humor and wisdom made him one of the best talkers of his\ngeneration. These qualities pervade his essays and his letters,\nand the latter in particular reveal those ardors and fidelities\nof friendship which men like Emerson and Thoreau longed after\nwithout ever quite experiencing. Lowell’s cosmopolitan\nreputation, which was greatly enhanced in the last decade of his\nlife, seemed to his old associates of the Saturday Club only a\nfit recognition of the learning, wit, and fine imagination which\nhad been familiar to them from the first. To hold the old friends\nthroughout his lifetime, and to win fresh ones of a new\ngeneration through his books, is perhaps the greatest of Lowell’s\npersonal felicities.",
        "While there are no other names in the literature of New England\nquite comparable with those that have just been discussed, it\nshould be remembered that the immediate effectiveness and\npopularity of these representative poets and prose writers were\ndependent upon the existence of an intelligent and responsive\nreading public. The lectures of Emerson, the speeches of Webster,\nthe stories of Hawthorne, the political verse of Whittier and\nLowell, presupposed a keen, reflecting audience, mentally and\nmorally exigent. The spread of the Lyceum system along the line\nof westward emigration from New England as far as the Mississippi\nis one tangible evidence of the high level of popular\nintelligence. That there was much of the superficial and the\nspread-eagle in the American life of the eighteen-forties is\napparent enough without the amusing comments of such English\ntravellers as Dickens, Miss Martineau, and Captain Basil Hall.\nBut there was also genuine intellectual curiosity and a general\nreading habit which are evidenced not only by a steady growth of\nnewspapers and magazines but also by the demand for substantial\nbooks. Biography and history began to be widely read, and it was\nnatural that the most notable productiveness in historical\nwriting should manifest itself in that section of the country\nwhere there were libraries, wealth, leisure for the pursuits of\nscholarship, a sense of intimate concern with the great issues\nof the past, and a diffusion of intellectual tastes throughout\nthe community. It was no accident that Sparks and Ticknor,\nBancroft and Prescott, Motley and Parkman, were Massachusetts\nmen.",
        "Jared Sparks, it is true, inherited neither wealth nor leisure.\nHe was a furious, unwearied toiler in the field of our national\nhistory. Born in 1789, by profession a Unitarian minister, he\nbegan collecting the papers of George Washington by 1825. John\nMarshall, the great jurist, had published his five-volume life of\nhis fellow Virginian a score of years earlier. But Sparks\nproceeded to write another biography of Washington and to edit\nhis writings. He also edited a “Library of American Biography,\"\nwrote lives of Franklin and Gouverneur Morris, was professor of\nhistory and President of Harvard, and lived to be seventy-seven.\nAs editor of the writings of Franklin and Washington, he took\nwhat we now consider unpardonable liberties in altering the text,\nand this error of judgment has somewhat clouded his just\nreputation as a pioneer in historical research.",
        "George Bancroft, who was born in 1800, and died, a\nhorseback-riding sage, at ninety-one, inherited from his\nclergyman father a taste for history. He studied in Germany after\nleaving Harvard, turned schoolmaster, Democratic politician and\noffice-holder, served as Secretary of the Navy, Minister to\nEngland and then to the German Empire, and won distinction in\neach of his avocations, though the real passion of his life was\nhis “History of the United States,” which he succeeded in\nbringing down to the adoption of the Constitution. The first\nvolume, which appeared in 1834, reads today like a stump speech\nby a sturdy Democratic orator of the Jacksonian period. But there\nwas solid stuff in it, nevertheless, and as Bancroft proceeded,\ndecade after decade, he discarded some of his rhetoric and\nphilosophy of democracy and utilized increasingly the vast stores\nof documents which his energy and his high political positions\nhad made it possible for him to obtain. Late in life he condensed\nhis ten great volumes to six. Posterity will doubtless condense\nthese in turn, as posterity has a way of doing, but Bancroft the\nhistorian realized his own youthful ambition with a completeness\nrare in the history of human effort and performed a monumental\nservice to his country. He was less of an artist, however, than\nPrescott, the eldest and in some ways the finest figure of the\nwell-known Prescott-Motley-Parkman group of Boston historians.\nAll of these men, together with their friend George Ticknor, who\nwrote the “History of Spanish Literature” and whose own “Life and\nLetters” pictures a whole generation, had the professional\nadvantages of inherited wealth, and the opportunity to make\ndeliberate choice of a historical field which offered freshness\nand picturesqueness of theme. All were tireless workers in spite\nof every physical handicap; all enjoyed social security and the\nrich reward of full recognition by their contemporaries. They had\ntheir world as in their time, as Chaucer makes the Wife of Bath\nsay of herself, and it was a pleasant world to live in.",
        "Grandson of “Prescott the Brave” of Bunker Hill, and son of the\nrich Judge Prescott of Salem, William Hickling Prescott was born\nin 1796, and was graduated from Harvard in 1814. An accident in\ncollege destroyed the sight of one eye, and left him but a\nprecarious use of the other. Nevertheless he resolved to emulate\nGibbon, whose “Autobiography” had impressed him, and to make\nhimself “an historian in the best sense of the term.” He studied\narduously in Europe, with the help of secretaries, and by 1826,\nafter a long hesitation, decided upon a “History of the Reign of\nFerdinand and Isabella.” In ten years the three volumes were\nfinished. “Pursuing the work in this quiet, leisurely way,\nwithout over-exertion or fatigue,” wrote Prescott, “or any sense\nof obligation to complete it in a given time, I have found it a\ncontinual source of pleasure.” It was published at his own\nexpense on Christmas Day, 1837, and met with instantaneous\nsuccess. “My market and my reputation rest principally with\nEngland,” he wrote in 1838–a curious footnote, by the way, to\nEmerson’s Phi Beta Kappa Address of the year before. But America\njoined with England, in praising the new book. Then Prescott\nturned to the “Conquest of Mexico,” the “Conquest of Peru,” and\nfinally to his unfinished “History of the Reign of Philip II.” He\nhad, as Dean Milman wrote him, “the judgment to choose noble\nsubjects.” He wrote with serenity and dignity, with fine balance\nand proportion. Some of the Spanish documents upon which he\nrelied have been proved less trustworthy than he thought, but\nthis unsuspected defect in his materials scarcely impaired the\nskill with which this unhasting, unresting painter filled his\ngreat canvases. They need retouching, perhaps, but the younger\nhistorians are incompetent for the task. Prescott died in 1859,\nin the same year as Irving, and he already seems quite as remote\nfrom the present hour.",
        "His young friend Motley, of “Dutch Republic” fame, was another\nBoston Brahmin, born in the year of Prescott’s graduation from\ncollege. He attended George Bancroft’s school, went to Harvard in\ndue course, where he knew Holmes, Sumner, and Wendell Phillips,\nand at Gottingen became a warm friend of a dog-lover and duelist\nnamed Bismarck. Young Motley wrote a couple of unsuccessful\nnovels, dabbled in diplomacy, politics, and review-writing, and\nfinally, encouraged by Prescott, settled down upon Dutch history,\nwent to Europe to work up his material in 1851, and, after five\nyears, scored an immense triumph with his “Rise of the Dutch\nRepublic.” He was a brilliant partisan, hating Spaniards and\nCalvinists; and wrote all the better for this bias. He was an\nadmirable sketcher of historical portraits, and had Macaulay’s\nskill in composing special chapters devoted to the tendencies and\nqualities of an epoch or to the characteristics of a dynasty.\nBetween 1860 and 1868 he produced the four volumes of the\n\"History of the United Netherlands.” During the Civil War he\nserved usefully as American minister to Vienna, and in 1869 was\nappointed minister to London. Both of these appointments ended\nunhappily for him. Dr. Holmes, his loyal admirer and biographer,\ndoes not conceal the fact that a steadier, less excitable type of\npublic servant might have handled both the Vienna situation and\nthe London situation without incurring a recall. Motley continued\nto live in England, where his daughters had married, and where,\nin spite of his ardent Americanism, he felt socially at home. His\nlast book was “The Life and Death of John of Barneveld.” His\n\"Letters,” edited after his death in 1877 by George William\nCurtis, give a fascinating picture of English life among the\ncultivated and leisurely classes. The Boston merchant’s son was a\nhigh-hearted gentleman, and his cosmopolitan experiences used to\nmake his stay-at-home friend, Oliver Wendell Holmes, feel rather\ndull and provincial in comparison. Both were Sons of Liberty, but\nMotley had had the luck to find in “brave little Holland” a\nsubject which captivated the interest of Europe and gave the\nhistorian international fame. He had more eloquence than the\nDoctor, and a far more varied range of prose, but there may be\nhere and there a Yankee guesser about the taste of future\ngenerations who will bet on “The Autocrat,” after all.",
        "The character and career of Francis Parkman afford curious\nmaterial to the student of New England’s golden age. In the\nseventy years of his heroic life, from 1823 to 1893, all the\ncharacteristic forces of the age reached their culmination and\ndecline, and his own personality indicates some of the violent\nreactions produced by the over-strain of Transcendentalism. For\nhere was a descendant of John Cotton, and a clergyman’s son, who\ndetested Puritanism and the clergy; who, coming to manhood in the\neighteen-forties, hated the very words Transcendentalism,\nPhilosophy, Religion, Reform; an inheritor of property, trained\nat Harvard, and an Overseer and Fellow of his University, who\ndisliked the ideals of culture and refinement; a member of the\nSaturday Club who was bored with literary talk and literary\npeople; a staunch American who despised democracy as thoroughly\nas Alexander Hamilton, and thought suffrage a failure; a\nnineteenth century historian who cared nothing for philosophy,\nscience, or the larger lessons of history itself; a fascinating\nrealistic writer who admired Scott, Byron, and Cooper for their\ntales of action, and despised Wordsworth and Thoreau as\neffeminate sentimentalists who were preoccupied with themselves.\nIn Parkman “the wheel has come full circle,” and a movement that\nbegan with expansion of self ended in hard Spartan repression,\neven in inhibition of emotion.",
        "Becoming “enamoured of the woods” at sixteen, Parkman chose his\nlife work at eighteen, and he was a man who could say proudly: “I\nhave not yet abandoned any plan which I ever formed.” “Before the\nend of the sophomore year,” he wrote in his autobiography, “my\nvarious schemes had crystallized into a plan of writing the story\nof what was then known as the ’Old French War,’ that is, the war\nthat ended in the conquest of Canada, for here, as it seemed to\nme, the forest drama was more stirring and the forest stage more\nthronged with appropriate actors than in any other passage of our\nhistory. It was not till some years later that I enlarged the\nplan to include the whole course of the American conflict between\nFrance and England, or, in other words, the history of the\nAmerican forest: for this was the light in which I regarded it.\nMy theme fascinated me, and I was haunted with wilderness images\nday and night.” To understand “the history of the American\nforest” young Parkman devoted his college vacations to long trips\nin the wilderness, and in 1846, two years after graduation, he\nmade the epoch-making journey described in his first book, “The\nOregon Trail.”",
        "“The Conspiracy of Pontiac,” a highly-colored narrative in two\nvolumes appearing in 1851, marks the first stage of his\nhistorical writing. Then came the tragedy of shattered health,\nand for fourteen years Parkman fought for life and sanity, and\nproduced practically nothing. He had had to struggle from his\ncollege days with an obscure disorder of the brain, aggravated by\nthe hardships of his Oregon Trail journey, and by ill-considered\nefforts to harden his bodily frame by over-exertion. His disease\ntook many forms–insomnia, arthritis, weakness of sight,\nincapacity for sustained thought. His biographer Farnham says\nthat “he never saw a perfectly well day during his entire\nliterary career.” Even when aided by secretaries and copyists,\nsix lines a day was often the limit of his production. His own\nStoic words about the limitations of his eyesight are\ncharacteristic: “By reading for one minute, and then resting for\nan equal time, this alternate process may gradually be continued\nfor about half an hour. Then, after a sufficient interval, it may\nbe repeated, often three or four times in the course of the day.\nBy this means nearly the whole of the volume now offered has been\ncomposed.” There is no more piteous or inspiring story of a fight\nagainst odds in the history of literature.",
        "For after his fortieth year the enemy gave way a little, and book\nafter book somehow got itself written. There they stand upon the\nshelves, a dozen of them–\"The Pioneers of France,” “The Jesuits\nin North America,” “La Salle,” “The Old Regime,” “Frontenac,\"\n\"Montcalm and Wolfe,” “A Half-Century of Conflict\"–the boy’s\ndream realized, the man’s long warfare accomplished. The history\nof the forest, as Parkman saw it, was a pageant with the dark\nwilderness for a background, and, for the actors, taciturn\nsavages, black-robed Jesuits, intrepid explorers, soldiers of\nFrance–all struggling for a vast prize, all changing, passing,\nwith a pomp and color unknown to wearied Europe. It was a superb\ntheme, better after all for an American than the themes chosen by\nPrescott and Ticknor and Motley, and precisely adapted to the\npictorial and narrative powers of the soldier-minded, soldier-\nhearted author.",
        "The quality which Parkman admired most in men–though he never\nseems to have loved men deeply, even his own heroes–was strength\nof will. That was the secret of his own power, and the sign, it\nmust be added, of the limitations of this group of historians who\ncame at the close of the golden age. Whatever a New England will\ncan accomplish was wrought manfully by such admirable men as\nPrescott and Parkman. Trained intelligence, deliberate selection\nof subject, skillful cultivation of appropriate story-telling and\npicture-painting style, all these were theirs. But the “wild\necstasy” that thrilled the young Emerson as he crossed the bare\nCommon at sunset, the “supernal beauty” of which Poe dreamed in\nthe Fordham cottage, the bay horse and hound and turtle-dove\nwhich Thoreau lost long ago and could not find in his but at\nWalden, these were something which our later Greeks of the New\nEngland Athens esteemed as foolishness.",
        "Enter now two egotists, who have little in common save their\negotism, two outsiders who upset most of the conventional\nAmerican rules for winning the literary race, two men of genius,\nin short, about whom we are still quarreling, and whose\ndistinctive quality is more accurately perceived in Europe than\nit has ever been in the United States.",
        "Both Poe and Whitman were Romanticists by temperament. Both\nshared in the tradition and influence of European Romanticism.\nBut they were also late comers, and they were caught in the more\nmorbid and extravagant phases of the great European movement\nwhile its current was beginning to ebb. Their acquaintance with\nits literature was mainly at second-hand and through the medium\nof British and American periodicals. Poe, who was older than\nWhitman by ten years, was fifteen when Byron died, in 1824. He\nwas untouched by the nobler mood of Byron, though his verse was\ncolored by the influence of Byron, Moore, and Shelley. His prose\nmodels were De Quincey, Disraeli, and Bulwer. Yet he owed more to\nColeridge than to any of the Romantics. He was himself a sort of\nColeridge without the piety, with the same keen penetrating\ncritical intelligence, the same lovely opium-shadowed dreams,\nand, alas, with something of the same reputation as a deadbeat.",
        "A child of strolling players, Poe happened to be born in Boston,\nbut he hated “Frog-Pondium\"–his favorite name for the city of\nhis nativity–as much as Whistler hated his native town of\nLowell. His father died early of tuberculosis, and his mother,\nafter a pitiful struggle with disease and poverty, soon followed\nher husband to the grave. The boy, by physical inheritance a\nneurasthenic, though with marked bodily activity in youth, was\nadopted by the Allans, a kindly family in Richmond, Virginia. Poe\nliked to think of himself as a Southerner. He was sent to school\nin England, and in 1826, at seventeen, he attended for nearly a\nyear the newly founded University of Virginia. He was a dark,\nshort, bow-legged boy, with the face of his own Roderick Usher.\nHe made a good record in French and Latin, read, wrote and\nrecited poetry, tramped on the Ragged Mountains, and did not\nnotably exceed his companions in drinking and gambling. But his\nScotch foster-father disapproved of his conduct and withdrew him\nfrom the University. A period of wandering followed. He enlisted\nin the army and was stationed in Boston in 1827, when his first\nvolume, “Tamerlane,” was published. In 1829 he was in Fortress\nMonroe, and published “Al Aaraf” at Baltimore. He entered West\nPoint in 1830, and was surely, except Whistler, the strangest of\nall possible cadets. When he was dismissed in 1831, he had\nwritten the marvellous lines “To Helen,” “Israfel,” and “The City\nin the Sea.” That is enough to have in one’s knapsack at the age\nof twenty-two.",
        "In the eighteen years from 1831 to 1849, when Poe’s unhappy life\ncame to an end in a Baltimore hospital, his literary activity was\nchiefly that of a journalist, critic, and short story writer. He\nlived in Baltimore, Richmond, Philadelphia, and New York. Authors\nwho now exploit their fat bargains with their publishers may have\nforgotten that letter which Poe wrote back to Philadelphia the\nmorning after he arrived with his child-wife in New York: “We are\nboth in excellent spirits . . . . We have now got four dollars\nand a half left. To-morrow I am going to try and borrow three\ndollars, so that I may have a fortnight to go upon.” When the\nchild-wife died in the shabby cottage at Fordham, her wasted body\nwas covered with the old army overcoat which Poe had brought from\nWest Point. If Poe met some of the tests of practical life\ninadequately, it must be remembered that his health failed at\ntwenty-five, that he was pitiably poor, and that the slightest\nindulgence in drink set his overwrought nerves jangling.\nFerguson, the former office-boy of the “Literary Messenger,\"\njudged this man of letters with an office-boy’s firm and\nexperienced eye: “Mr. Poe was a fine gentleman when he was sober.\nHe was ever kind and courtly, and at such times everyone liked\nhim. But when he was drinking he was about one of the most\ndisagreeable men I have ever met.” “I am sorry for him,” wrote C.\nF. Briggs to Lowell. “He has some good points, but taken\naltogether, he is badly made up.” “Badly made up,” no doubt, both\nin body and mind, but all respectable and prosperous Pharisees\nshould be reminded that Poe did not make himself; or rather, that\nhe could not make himself over. Very few men can. Given Poe’s\ntemperament, and the problem is insoluble. He wrote to Lowell in\n1844: “I have been too deeply conscious of the mutability and\nevanescence of temporal things to give any continuous effort to\nanything–to be consistent in anything. My life has been\nWHIM–impulse–passion–a longing for solitude–a scorn of all\nthings present in an earnest desire for the future.” It is the\npathetic confession of a dreamer. Yet this dreamer was also a\nkeen analyzer, a tireless creator of beautiful things. In them he\nsought and found a refuge from actuality. The marvel of his\ncareer is, as I have said elsewhere, that this solitary,\nembittered craftsman, out of such hopeless material as negations\nand abstractions, shadows and superstitions, out of disordered\nfancies and dreams of physical horror and strange crime, should\nhave wrought structures of imperishable beauty.",
        "Let us notice the critical instinct which he brought to the task\nof creation. His theory of verse is simple, in fact too simple to\naccount for all of the facts. The aim of poetry, according to\nPoe, is not truth but pleasure–the rhythmical creation of\nbeauty. Poetry should be brief, indefinite, and musical. Its\nchief instrument is sound. A certain quaintness or grotesqueness\nof tone is a means for satisfying the thirst for supernal beauty.\nHence the musical lyric is to Poe the only true type of poetry; a\nlong poem does not exist. Readers who respond more readily to\nauditory than to visual or motor stimulus are therefore Poe’s\nchosen audience. For them he executes, like Paganini, marvels\nupon his single string. He has easily recognizable devices: the\ndominant note, the refrain, the “repetend,” that is to say the\nphrase which echoes, with some variation, a phrase or line\nalready used. In such poems as “To Helen,” “Israfel,” “The\nHaunted Palace,” “Annabel Lee,” the theme, the tone, the melody\nall weave their magic spell; it is like listening to a\nlute-player in a dream.",
        "That the device often turns into a trick is equally true. In “The\nBells” and “The Raven” we detect the prestidigitator. It is\njugglery, though such juggling as only a master-musician can\nperform. In “Ulalume” and other showpieces the wires get crossed\nand the charm snaps, scattering tinsel fragments of nonsense\nverse. Such are the dangers of the technical temperament\nunenriched by wide and deep contact with human feeling.",
        "Poe’s theory of the art of the short story is now familiar\nenough. The power of a tale, he thought, turned chiefly if not\nsolely upon its unity, its harmony of effect. This is illustrated\nin all of his finest stories. In “The Fall of the House of Usher\"\nthe theme is Fear; the opening sentence strikes the key and the\nclosing sentence contains the climax. In the whole composition\nevery sentence is modulated to the one end in view. The autumn\nlandscape tones with the melancholy house; the somber chamber\nframes the cadaverous face of Roderick Usher; the face is an\nindex of the tumultuous agitation of a mind wrestling with the\ngrim phantom Fear and awaiting the cumulative horror of the final\nmoment. In “Ligeia,” which Poe sometimes thought the best of all\nhis tales, the theme is the ceaseless life of the will, the\npotency of the spirit of the beloved and departed woman. The\nunity of effect is absolute, the workmanship consummate. So with\nthe theme of revenge in “The Cask of Amontillado,” the theme of\nmysterious intrigue in “The Assignation.” In Poe’s detective\nstories, or tales of ratiocination as he preferred to call them,\nhe takes to pieces for our amusement a puzzle which he has\ncunningly put together. “The Gold Bug” is the best known of\nthese, “The Purloined Letter” the most perfect, “The Murders in\nthe Rue Morgue” the most sensational. Then there are the tales\nupon scientific subjects or displaying the pretence of scientific\nknowledge, where the narrator loves to pose as a man without\nimagination and with “habits of rigid thought.” And there are\ntales of conscience, of which “The Black Cat” is the most fearful\nand “William Wilson” the most subtle; and there are landscape\nsketches and fantasies and extravaganzas, most of these poor\nstuff.",
        "It is ungrateful and perhaps unnecessary to dwell upon Poe’s\nlimitations. His scornful glance caught certain aspects of the\nhuman drama with camera-like precision. Other aspects of life,\nand nobler, he never seemed to perceive. The human comedy\nsometimes moved him to laughter, but his humor is impish and his\nwit malign. His imagination fled from the daylight; he dwelt in\nthe twilight among the tombs. He closed his eyes to dream, and\ncould not see the green sunlit earth, seed-time and harvest, man\ngoing forth to his toil and returning to his hearthstone, the\nAmerica that laughs as it labors. He wore upon his finger the\nmagic ring and the genii did his bidding. But we could wish that\nthe palaces they reared for him were not in such a somber land,\nwith such infernal lights gleaming in their windows, and crowded\nwith such horror-haunted forms. We could wish that his\nimagination dealt less often with those primitive terrors that\nbelong to the childhood of our race. Yet when his spell is upon\nus we lapse back by a sort of atavism into primal savagery and\nshudder with a recrudescence of long forgotten fears. No doubt\nPoe was ignorant of life, in the highest sense. He was caged in\nby his ignorance, Yet he had beautiful dusky wings that bruised\nthemselves against his prison.",
        "Poe was a tireless critic of his own work, and both his standards\nof workmanship and his critical precepts have been of great\nservice to his careless countrymen. He turned out between four\nand five short stories a year, was poorly paid for them, and\nindeed found difficulty in selling them at all. Yet he was\nconstantly correcting them for the better. His best poems were\nlikewise his latest. He was tantalized with the desire for\nartistic perfection. He became the pathbreaker for a long file of\nmen in France, Italy, England, and America. He found the way and\nthey brought back the glory and the cash.",
        "I have sometimes imagined Poe, with four other men and one woman,\nseated at a dinner-table laid for six, and talking of their art\nand of themselves. What would the others think of Poe? I fancy\nthat Thackeray would chat with him courteously, but would not\ngreatly care for him. George Eliot, woman-like, would pity him.\nHawthorne would watch him with those inscrutable eyes and\nunderstand him better than the rest. But Stevenson would be\nimmensely interested; he would begin an essay on Poe before he\nwent to sleep. And Mr. Kipling would look sharply at him: he has\nseen that man before, in “The Gate of a Hundred Sorrows.” All of\nthem would find in him something to praise, a great deal to\nmarvel at, and perhaps not much to love. And the sensitive,\nshabby, lonely Poe–what would he think of them? He might not\ncare much for the other guests, but I think he would say to\nhimself with a thrill of pride: “I belong at this table.” And he\ndoes.",
        "Walt Whitman, whom his friend O’Connor dubbed the “good gray\npoet,” offers a bizarre contrast to Edgar Allan Poe. There was\nnothing distinctively American about Poe except his ingenuity; he\nhad no interest in American history or in American ideas; he was\na timeless, placeless embodiment of technical artistry. But\nWhitman had a passion for his native soil; he was hypnotized by\nthe word America; he spent much of his mature life in brooding\nover the question, “What, after all, is an American, and what\nshould an American poet be in our age of science and democracy?\"\nIt is true that he was as untypical as Poe of the average citizen\nof “these states.” His personality is unique. In many respects he\nstill baffles our curiosity. He repels many of his countrymen\nwithout arousing the pity which adds to their romantic interest\nin Poe. Whatever our literary students may feel, and whatever\nforeign critics may assert, it must be acknowledged that to the\nvast majority of American men and women “good old Walt” is still\nan outsider.",
        "Let us try to see first the type of mind with which we are\ndealing. It is fundamentally religious, perceiving the unity and\nkinship and glory of all created things. It is this passion of\nworship which inspired St. Francis of Assisi’s “Canticle to the\nSun.” It cries, “Benedicite, Omnia opera Domini: All ye Green\nThings upon the Earth, bless ye the Lord!” That is the real motto\nfor Whitman’s “Leaves of Grass.” Like St. Francis, and like his\nown immediate master, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Whitman is a mystic.\nHe cannot argue the ultimate questions; he asserts them. Instead\nof marshaling and sifting the proofs for immortality, he chants\n\"I know I am deathless.” Like Emerson again, Whitman shares that\npeculiarly American type of mysticism known as Transcendentalism,\nbut he came at the end of this movement instead of at the\nbeginning of it. In his Romanticism, likewise, he is an end of an\nera figure. His affiliations with Victor Hugo are significant;\nand a volume of Scott’s poems which he owned at the age of\nsixteen became his “inexhaustible mine and treasury for more than\nsixty years.” Finally, and quite as uncompromisingly as Emerson,\nThoreau, and Poe, Whitman is an individualist. He represents the\nassertive, Jacksonian period of our national existence. In a\nthousand similes he makes a declaration of independence for the\nseparate person, the “single man” of Emerson’s Phi Beta Kappa\naddress. “I wear my hat as I please, indoors and out.” Sometimes\nthis is mere swagger. Sometimes it is superb.",
        "So much for the type. Let us turn next to the story of Whitman’s\nlife. It must here be told in the briefest fashion, for Whitman’s\nown prose and poetry relate the essentials of his biography. He\nwas born on Long Island, of New England and Dutch ancestry, in\n1819. Lowell, W. W. Story, and Charles A. Dana were born in that\nyear, as was also George Eliot. Whitman’s father was a carpenter,\nwho “leaned to the Quakers.” There were many children. When\nlittle “Walt\"–as he was called, to distinguish him from his\nfather, Walter–was four, the family moved to Brooklyn. The boy\nhad scanty schooling, and by the time he was twenty had tried\ntypesetting, teaching, and editing a country newspaper on Long\nIsland. He was a big, dark-haired fellow, sensitive, emotional,\nextraordinarily impressible.",
        "The next sixteen years were full of happy vagrancy. At twenty-two\nhe was editing a paper in New York, and furnishing short stories\nto the “Democratic Review,” a literary journal which numbered\nBryant, Longfellow, Whittier, Poe, Hawthorne, and Thoreau among\nits contributors. He wrote a novel on temperance, “mostly in the\nreading-room of Tammany Hall,” and tried here and there an\nexperiment in free verse. He was in love with the pavements of\nNew York and the Brooklyn ferryboats, in love with Italian opera\nand with long tramps over Long Island. He left his position on\n\"The Brooklyn Eagle” and wandered south to New Orleans. By and by\nhe drifted back to New York, tried lecturing, worked at the\ncarpenter’s trade with his father, and brooded over a book–\"a\nbook of new things.”",
        "This was the famous “Leaves of Grass.” He set the type himself,\nin a Brooklyn printing-office, and printed about eight hundred\ncopies. The book had a portrait of the author–a meditative,\ngray-bearded poet in workman’s clothes–and a confused preface on\nAmerica as a field for the true poet. Then followed the new\ngospel, “I celebrate myself,” chanted in long lines of free\nverse, whose patterns perplexed contemporary readers. For the\nmost part it was passionate speech rather than song, a\nrhapsodical declamation in hybrid rhythms. Very few people bought\nthe book or pretended to understand what it was all about. Some\nwere startled by the frank sexuality of certain poems. But\nEmerson wrote to Whitman from Concord: “I find it the most\nextraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet\ncontributed.”",
        "Until the Civil War was half over, Whitman remained in Brooklyn,\npatiently composing new poems for successive printings of his\nbook. Then he went to the front to care for a wounded brother,\nand finally settled down in a Washington garret to spend his\nstrength as an army hospital nurse. He wrote “Drum Taps” and\nother magnificent poems about the War, culminating in his\nthrenody on Lincoln’s death, “When Lilacs last in the Dooryard\nBloomed.” Swinburne called this “the most sonorous nocturn ever\nchanted in the church of the world.” After the war had ended,\nWhitman stayed on in Washington as a government clerk, and saw\nmuch of John Burroughs and W. D. O’Connor. John Hay was a staunch\nfriend. Some of the best known poets and critics of England and\nthe Continent now began to recognize his genius. But his health\nhad been permanently shattered by his heroic service as a nurse,\nand in 1873 he suffered a paralytic stroke which forced him to\nresign his position in Washington and remove to his brother’s\nhome in Camden, New Jersey.",
        "He was only fifty-four, but his best work was already done, and\nhis remaining years, until his death in 1892, were those of\npatient and serene invalidism. He wrote some fascinating prose in\nthis final period, and his cluttered chamber in Camden became the\nshrine of many a literary pilgrim, among them some of the\nforemost men of letters of this country and of Europe. He was\ncared for by loyal friends. Occasionally he appeared in public, a\nmagnificent gray figure of a man. And then, at seventy-three, the\n\"Dark mother always gliding near” enfolded him.",
        "There are puzzling things in the physical and moral constitution\nof Walt Whitman, and the obstinate questions involved in his\ntheory of poetry and in his actual poetical performance are still\nfar from solution. But a few points concerning him are by this\ntime fairly clear. They must be swiftly summarized.",
        "The first obstacle to the popular acceptance of Walt Whitman is\nthe formlessness or alleged formlessness of “Leaves of Grass.\"\nThis is a highly technical question, involving a more accurate\nnotation than has thus far been made of the patterns and tunes of\nfree verse and of emotional prose. Whitman’s “new and national\ndeclamatory expression,” as he termed it, cannot receive a final\ntechnical valuation until we have made more scientific progress\nin the analysis of rhythms. As regards the contents of his verse,\nit is plain that he included much material unfused and\nuntransformed by emotion. These elements foreign to the nature of\npoetry clog many of his lines. The enumerated objects in his\ncatalogue or inventory poems often remain inert objects only.\nLike many mystics, he was hypnotized by external phenomena, and\nhe often fails to communicate to his reader the trancelike\nemotion which he himself experienced. This imperfect transfusion\nof his material is a far more significant defect in Whitman’s\npoetry than the relatively few passages of unashamed sexuality\nwhich shocked the American public in 1855.",
        "The gospel or burden of “Leaves of Grass” is no more difficult of\ncomprehension than the general drift of Emerson’s essays, which\nhelped to inspire it. The starting point of the book is a\nmystical illumination regarding the unity and blessedness of the\nuniverse, an insight passing understanding, but based upon the\nrevelatory experience of love. In the light of this experience,\nall created things are recognized as divine. The starting-point\nand center of the Whitman world is the individual man, the\n\"strong person,” imperturbable in mind, athletic in body,\nunconquerable, and immortal. Such individuals meet in\ncomradeship, and pass together along the open roads of the world.\nNo one is excluded because of his poverty or his sins; there is\nroom in the ideal America for everybody except the doubter and\nsceptic. Whitman does not linger over the smaller groups of human\nsociety, like the family. He is not a fireside poet. He passes\ndirectly from his strong persons, meeting freely on the open\nroad, to his conception of “these States.” One of his typical\nvisions of the breadth and depth and height of America will be\nfound in “By Blue Ontario’s Shore.” In this and in many similar\nrhapsodies Whitman holds obstinately to what may be termed the\nthree points of his national creed. The first is the newness of\nAmerica, and its expression is in his well-known chant of\n\"Pioneers, O Pioneers.” Yet this new America is subtly related to\nthe past; and in Whitman’s later poems, such as “Passage to\nIndia,” the spiritual kinship of orient and occident is\nemphasized. The second article of the creed is the unity of\nAmerica. Here he voices the conceptions of Hamilton, Clay,\nWebster, and Lincoln. In spite of all diversity in external\naspects the republic is “one and indivisible.” This unity, in\nWhitman’s view, was cemented forever by the issue of the Civil\nWar. Lincoln, the “Captain,” dies indeed on the deck of the\n\"victor ship,” but the ship comes into the harbor “with object\nwon.” Third and finally, Whitman insists upon the solidarity of\nAmerica with all countries of the globe. Particularly in his\nyearning and thoughtful old age, the poet perceived that humanity\nhas but one heart and that it should have but one will. No\nAmerican poet has ever prophesied so directly and powerfully\nconcerning the final issue involved in that World War which he\ndid not live to see.",
        "Whitman, like Poe, had defects of character and defects of art.\nHis life and work raise many problems which will long continue to\nfascinate and to baffle the critics. But after all of them have\nhad their say, it will remain true that he was a seer and a\nprophet, far in advance of his own time, like Lincoln, and like\nLincoln, an inspired interpreter of the soul of this republic.",
        "“There is what I call the American idea,” declared Theodore\nParker in the Anti-Slavery Convention of 1850. “This idea\ndemands, as the proximate organization thereof, a democracy–that\nis, a government of all the people, by all the people, for all\nthe people; of course, a government on the principle of eternal\njustice, the unchanging law of God; for shortness’ sake, I will\ncall it the idea of Freedom.”",
        "These are noble words, and they are thought to have suggested a\nfamiliar phrase of Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, thirteen years\nlater. Yet students of literature, no less than students of\npolitics, recognize the difficulty of summarizing in words a\nnational “idea.” Precisely what was the Greek “idea”? What is\ntoday the French “idea”? No single formula is adequate to express\nsuch a complex of fact, theories, moods–not even the famous\n\"Liberty, Fraternity, Equality.” The existence of a truly\nnational life and literature presupposes a certain degree of\nunity, an integration of race, language, political institutions,\nand social ideals. It is obvious that this problem of national\nintegration meets peculiar obstacles in the United States.\nDivergencies of race, tradition, and social theory, and clashing\ninterests of different sections have been felt from the beginning\nof the nation’s life. There was well-nigh complete solidarity in\nthe single province of New England during a portion of the\nseventeenth century, and under the leadership of the great\nVirginians there was sufficient national fusion to make the\nRevolution successful. But early in the nineteenth century, the\nopening of the new West, and the increasing economic importance\nof Slavery as a peculiar institution of the South, provoked again\nthe ominous question of the possibility of an enduring Union.\n>From 1820 until the end of the Civil War, it was the chief\npolitical issue of the United States. The aim of the present\nchapter is to show how the theme of Union and Liberty affected\nour literature.",
        "To appreciate the significance of this theme we must remind\nourselves again of what many persons have called the civic note\nin our national writing. Franklin exemplified it in his day. It\nis far removed from the pure literary art of a Poe, a Hawthorne,\na Henry James. It aims at action rather than beauty. It seeks to\npersuade, to convince, to bring things to pass. We shall observe\nit in the oratory of Clay and Webster, as they pleaded for\ncompromise; in the editorials of Garrison, a foe to compromise\nand like Calhoun an advocate, if necessary, of disunion; in the\nepochmaking novel of Harriet Beecher Stowe; in the speeches of\nWendell Phillips, in verse white-hot with political passion, and\nsermons blazing with the fury of attack and defense of principles\ndear to the human heart. We must glance, at least, at the lyrics\nproduced by the war itself, and finally, we shall observe how\nAbraham Lincoln, the inheritor of the ideas of Jefferson, Clay,\nand Webster, perceives and maintains, in the noblest tones of our\ncivic speech, the sole conditions of our continuance as a nation.",
        "Let us begin with oratory, an American habit, and, as many\nbesides Dickens have thought, an American defect. We cannot argue\nthat question adequately here. It is sufficient to say that in\nthe pioneer stages of our existence oratory was necessary as a\nstimulus to communal thought and feeling. The speeches of Patrick\nHenry and Samuel Adams were as essential to our winning\nindependence as the sessions of statesmen and the armed conflicts\nin the field. And in that new West which came so swiftly and\ndramatically into existence at the close of the Revolution, the\norator came to be regarded as the normal type of intellectual\nleadership. The stump grew more potent than schoolhouse and\nchurch and bench.",
        "The very pattern, and, if one likes, the tragic victim of this\nglorification of oratory was Henry Clay, “Harry of the West,” the\nglamour of whose name and the wonderful tones of whose voice\nbecame for a while a part of the political system of the United\nStates. Union and Liberty were the master-passions of Clay’s\nlife, but the greater of these was Union. The half-educated young\nimmigrant from Virginia hazarded his career at the outset by\nchampioning Anti-Slavery in the Kentucky Constitutional\nConvention; the last notable act of his life was his successful\nmanagement, at the age of seventy-three, of the futile Compromise\nof 1850. All his life long he fought for national issues; for the\nWar of 1812, for a protective tariff and an “American system,\"\nfor the Missouri Compromise of 1820 as a measure for national\nsafety; and he had plead generously for the young South American\nrepublics and for struggling Greece. He had become the perpetual\ncandidate of his party for the Presidency, and had gone down\nagain and again in unforeseen and heart-rending defeat. Yet he\ncould say honorably: “If any one desires to know the leading and\nparamount object of my public life, the preservation of this\nunion will furnish him the key.” One could wish that the speeches\nof this fascinating American were more readable today. They seem\nthin, facile, full of phrases–such adroit phrases as would catch\nthe ear of a listening, applauding audience. Straight, hard\nthinking was not the road to political preferment in Clay’s day.\nCalhoun had that power, as Lincoln had it. Webster had the\ncapacity for it, although he was too indolent to employ his great\ngifts steadily. Yet it was Webster who analyzed kindly and a\nlittle sadly, for he was talking during Clay’s last illness and\njust before his own, his old rival’s defect in literary quality:\n\"He was never a man of books . . . . I could never imagine him\nsitting comfortably in his library and reading quietly out of the\ngreat books of the past. He has been too fond of excitement–he\nhas lived upon it; he has been too fond of company, not enough\nalone; and has had few resources within himself.” Were the\nlimitations of a typical oratorical temperament ever touched more\nunerringly than in these words?",
        "When Webster himself thundered, at the close of his reply to\nHayne in 1830, “Union AND Liberty, now and forever, one and\ninseparable,” the words sank deeper into the consciousness of the\nAmerican people than any similar sentiment uttered by Henry Clay.\nFor Webster’s was the richer, fuller nature, nurtured by “the\ngreat books of the past,” brooding, as Lincoln was to brood\nlater, over the seemingly insoluble problem of preserving a union\nof States half slave, half free. On the fateful seventh of March,\n1850, Webster, like Clay, cast the immense weight of his\npersonality and prestige upon the side of compromise. It was the\nruin of his political fortune, for the mood of the North was\nchanging, and the South preferred other candidates for the\nPresidency. Yet the worst that can fairly be said against that\nspeech today is that it lacked moral imagination to visualize, as\nMrs. Stowe was soon to visualize, the human results of slavery.\nAs a plea for the transcendent necessity of maintaining the old\nUnion it was consistent with Webster’s whole development of\npolitical thought.",
        "What were the secrets of that power that held Webster’s hearers\nliterally spellbound, and made the North think of him, after that\nalienation of 1850, as a fallen angel? No one can say fully, for\nwe touch here the mysteries of personality and of the spoken\nword. But enough survives from the Webster legend, from his\ncorrespondence and political and legal oratory, to bring us into\nthe presence of a superman. The dark Titan face, painted by such\nmasters as Carlyle, Hawthorne, and Emerson; the magical voice,\nremembered now but by a few old men; the bodily presence, with\nits leonine suggestion of sleepy power only half put forth–these\naided Webster to awe men or allure them into personal idolatry.\nYet outside of New England he was admired rather than loved.\nThere is still universal recognition of the mental capacity of\nthis foremost lawyer and foremost statesman of his time. He was\nunsurpassed in his skill for direct, simple, limpid statement;\nbut he could rise at will to a high Roman stateliness of diction,\na splendid sonorousness of cadence. His greatest public\nappearances were in the Dartmouth College Case before the Supreme\nCourt, the Plymouth, Bunker Hill, and Adams-Jefferson\ncommemorative orations, the Reply to Hayne, and the Seventh of\nMarch speeches in the Senate. Though he exhibited in his private\nlife something of the prodigal recklessness of the pioneer, his\nmental operations were conservative, constructive. His lifelong\nantagonist Calhoun declared that “The United States are not a\nnation.” Webster, in opposition to this theory of a confederation\nof states, devoted his superb talents to the demonstration of the\nthesis that the United States “IS,” not “are.” Thus he came to be\nknown as the typical expounder of the Constitution. When he\nreached, in 1850, the turning point of his career, his countrymen\nknew by heart his personal and political history, the New\nHampshire boyhood and education, the rise to mastery at the New\nEngland bar, the service in the House of Representatives and the\nSenate and as Secretary of State. His speeches were already in\nthe schoolbooks, and for twenty years boys had been declaiming\nhis arguments against nullification. He had helped to teach\nAmerica to think and to feel. Indeed it was through his oratory\nthat many of his fellow-citizens had gained their highest\nconception of the beauty, the potency, and the dignity of human\nspeech. And in truth he never exhibited his logical power and\ndemonstrative skill more superbly than in the plea of the seventh\nof March for the preservation of the status quo, for the\navoidance of mutual recrimination between North and South, for\nobedience to the law of the land. It was his supreme effort to\nreconcile an irreconcilable situation.",
        "It failed, as we know. Whittier, Emerson, Theodore Parker, and\nindeed most of the voters of New England, believed that Webster\nhad bartered his private convictions in the hope of securing the\nPresidential nomination in 1852. They assailed him savagely, and\nWebster died, a broken man, in the autumn of the Presidential\nyear. “I have given my life to law and politics,” he wrote to\nProfessor Silliman. “Law is uncertain and politics are utterly\nvain.” The dispassionate judgment of the present hour frees him\nfrom the charge of conscious treachery to principle. He was\nrather a martyr to his own conception of the obligations imposed\nby nationality. When these obligations run counter to human\nrealities, the theories of statesmen must give way. Emerson could\nnot refute that logic of Webster’s argument for the Fugitive\nSlave Law, but he could at least record in his private Journal:\n\"I WILL NOT OBEY IT, BY GOD!” So said hundreds of thousands of\nobscure men in the North, but Webster did not or could not hear\nthem.",
        "While no other orator of that period was so richly endowed as\nDaniel Webster, the struggle for Union and Liberty enlisted on\nboth sides many eloquent men. John C. Calhoun’s acute, ingenious,\nmasterly political theorizing can still be studied in speeches\nthat have lost little of their effectiveness through the lapse of\ntime. The years have dealt roughly with Edward Everett, once\nthought to be the pattern of oratorical gifts and graces. In\ncommemorative oratory, indeed, he ranked with Webster, but the\ndust is settling upon his learned and ornate pages. Rufus Choate,\nanother conservative Whig in politics, and a leader, like Wirt\nand Pinkney, at the bar, had an exotic, almost Oriental fancy, a\ngorgeousness of diction, and an intensity of emotion unrivaled\namong his contemporaries. His Dartmouth College eulogy of Webster\nin 1853 shows him at his best. The Anti-Slavery orators, on the\nother hand, had the advantage of a specific moral issue in which\nthey led the attack. Wendell Phillips was the most polished, the\nmost consummate in his air of informality, and his example did\nmuch to puncture the American tradition of high-flown oratory. He\nwas an expert in virulent denunciation, passionately unfair\nbeneath his mask of conversational decorum, an aristocratic\ndemagogue. He is still distrusted and hated by the Brahmin class\nof his own city, still adored by the children and grandchildren\nof slaves. Charles Sumner, like Edward Everett, seems sinking\ninto popular oblivion, in spite of the statues and portraits and\nmassive volumes of erudite and caustic and high-minded orations.\nHe may be seen at his best in such books as Longfellow’s “Journal\nand Correspondence” and the “Life and Letters” of George Ticknor.\nThere one has a pleasant picture of a booklover, traveler, and\nfriend. But in his public speech he was arrogant, unsympathetic,\ndomineering. “Sumner is my idea of a bishop,” said Lincoln\ntentatively. There are bishops and bishops, however, and if Henry\nWard Beecher, whom Lincoln and hosts of other Americans admired,\nhad only belonged to the Church of England, what an admirable\nVictorian bishop he might have made! Perhaps his best service to\nthe cause of union was rendered by his speeches in England, where\nhe fairly mobbed the mob and won them by his wit, courage, and by\nhis appeal to the instinct of fair play. Beecher’s oratory, in\nand out of the pulpit, was temperamental, sentimental in the\nbetter sense, and admirably human in all its instincts. He had an\nimmense following, not only in political and humanitarian fields,\nbut as a lovable type of the everyday American who can say\nundisputed things not only solemnly, if need be, but by\npreference with an infectious smile. The people who loved Mr.\nBeecher are the people who understand Mr. Bryan.",
        "Foremost among the journalists of the great debate were William\nLloyd Garrison and Horace Greeley. Garrison was a perfect example\nof the successful journalist as described by Zola–the man who\nkeeps on pounding at a single idea until he has driven it into\nthe head of the public. Everyone knows at least the sentence from\nhis salutatory editorial in “The Liberator” on January 1, 1831:\n\"I am in earnest–I will not retreat a single inch–AND I WILL BE\nHEARD.” He kept this vow, and he also kept the accompanying and\nhighly characteristic promise: “I will be as harsh as truth and\nas uncompromising as justice. On this subject, I do not wish to\nthink, or write, or speak, with moderation.” But there would be\nlittle political literature in the world if its production were\nentrusted to the moderate type of man, and the files of “The\nLiberator,” though certainly harsh and full of all\nuncharitableness towards slave-owners, make excellent reading for\nthe twentieth century American who perceives that in spite of the\ntriumph of emancipation, in which Garrison had his fair share of\nglory, many aspects of our race-problem remain unsolved. Horace\nGreeley, the founder and editor of the “New York Tribune” was a\nfarmer’s boy who learned early to speak and write the vocabulary\nof the plain people. Always interested in new ideas, even in\nTranscendentalism and Fourierism, his courage and energy and\njournalistic vigor gave him leadership in the later phases of the\nmovement for enfranchisement. He did not hesitate to offer\nunasked advice to Lincoln on many occasions, and Lincoln enriched\nour literature by his replies. Greeley had his share of faults\nand fatuities, but in his best days he had an impressively loyal\nfollowing among both rural and city-bred readers of his paper,\nand he remains one of the best examples of that obsolescent\npersonal journalism which is destined to disappear under modern\nconditions of newspaper production. Readers really used to care\nfor “what Greeley said” and “Dana said” and “Sam Bowles said,\"\nand all of these men, with scores of others, have left their\nstamp upon the phrases and the tone of our political writing.",
        "In the concrete issue of Slavery, however, it must be admitted\nthat the most remarkable literary victory was scored, not by any\norator or journalist, but by an almost unknown little woman, the\nauthor of “Uncle Tom’s Cabin.” No American novel has had so\ncurious a history and so great or so immediate an influence in\nthis country and in Europe. In spite of all that has been written\nabout it, its author’s purpose is still widely misunderstood,\nparticularly in the South, and the controversy over this one\nepoch-making novel has tended to obscure the literary reputation\nwhich Mrs. Stowe won by her other books.",
        "Harriet Beecher, the daughter and the sister of famous clergymen,\nwas born in Litchfield, Connecticut, in 1811. For seventeen\nyears, from 1832 to 1849, she lived in the border city of\nCincinnati, within sight of slave territory, and in daily contact\nwith victims of the slave system. While her sympathies, like\nthose of her father Lyman Beecher, were anti-slavery, she was not\nan Abolitionist in the Garrisonian sense of that word. At twenty\nfive she had married a widowed professor, Calvin Stowe, to whom\nshe bore many children. She had written a few sketches of New\nEngland life, and her family thought her a woman of genius. Such\nwas the situation in the winter of 1849-1850, when the Stowes\nmigrated to Brunswick, Maine, where the husband had been\nappointed to a chair at Bowdoin. Pitiably poor, and distracted by\nhousehold cares which she had to face single-handed–for the\nProfessor was a “feckless body\"–Mrs. Stowe nevertheless could\nnot be indifferent to the national crisis over the Fugitive Slave\nLaw. She had seen its working. When her sister-in-law wrote to\nher: “If I could use a pen as you can, I would write something\nthat would make this whole nation feel what an accursed thing\nslavery is,” Mrs. Stowe exclaimed: “God helping me, I will write\nsomething; I will if I live.”",
        "“Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” begun in the spring of 1850, was a woman’s\nanswer to Webster’s seventh of March speech. Its object was\nplainly stated to be “to awaken sympathy and feeling for the\nAfrican race; to show, their wrongs and sorrows, under a system\nso necessarily cruel and unjust as to defeat and do away the good\neffects of all that can be attempted for them, by their best\nfriends under it.” The book was permeated with what we now call\nthe 1848 anti-aristocratic sentiment, the direct heritage of the\nFrench Revolution. “There is a dies irae coming on, sooner or\nlater,” admits St. Clare in the story. “The same thing is\nworking, in Europe, in England, and in this country.” There was\nno sectional hostility in Mrs. Stowe’s heart. “The people of the\nfree states have defended, encouraged, and participated [in\nslavery]; and are more guilty for it, before God, than the South,\nin that they have NOT the apology of education or custom. If the\nmothers of the free states had all felt as they should in times\npast, the sons of the free states would not have been the\nholders, and proverbially the hardest masters, of slaves; the\nsons of the free states would not have connived at the extension\nof slavery in our national body.” “Your book is going to be the\ngreat pacificator,” wrote a friend of Mrs. Stowe; “it will unite\nNorth and South.” But the distinctly Christian and fraternal\nintention of the book was swiftly forgotten in the storm of\ncontroversy that followed its appearance. It had been written\nhastily, fervidly, in the intervals of domestic toil at\nBrunswick, had been printed as a serial in “The National Era\"\nwithout attracting much attention, and was issued in book form in\nMarch, 1852. Its sudden and amazing success was not confined to\nthis country. The story ran in three Paris newspapers at once,\nwas promptly dramatized, and has held the stage in France ever\nsince. It was placed upon the “Index” in Italy, as being\nsubversive of established authority. Millions of copies were sold\nin Europe, and “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” more than any other cause,\nheld the English working men in sympathy with the North in the\nEnglish cotton crisis of our Civil War.",
        "It is easy to see the faults of this masterpiece and impossible\nnot to recognize its excellencies. “If our art has not scope\nenough to include a book of this kind,” said Madame George Sand,\n\"we had better stretch the terms of our art a little.” For the\nbook proved to be, as its author had hoped, a “living dramatic\nreality.” Topsy, Chloe, Sam and Andy, Miss Ophelia and Legree are\nalive. Mrs. St. Clare might have been one of Balzac’s indolent,\nsensuous women. Uncle Tom himself is a bit too good to be true,\nand readers no longer weep over the death of little Eva–nor, for\nthat matter, over the death of Dickens’s little Nell. There is\nsome melodrama, some religiosity, and there are some absurd\nrecognition scenes at the close. Nevertheless with an instinctive\ngenius which Zola would have envied, Mrs. Stowe embodies in men\nand women the vast and ominous system of slavery. All the tragic\nforces of necessity, blindness, sacrifice, and retribution are\nhere: neither Shelby, nor Eliza, nor the tall Kentuckian who aids\nher, nor John Bird, nor Uncle Tom himself in the final act of his\ndrama, can help himself. For good or evil they are the products\nand results of the system; and yet they have and they give the\nillusion of volition.",
        "Mrs. Stowe lived to write many another novel and short story,\namong them “Dred,” “The Minister’s Wooing,” “Oldtown Folks,\"\n\"Oldtown Fireside Stories.” In the local short story she deserves\nthe honors due to one of the pioneers, and her keen affectionate\nobservation, her humor, and her humanity, would have given her a\nliterary reputation quite independent of her masterpiece. But she\nis likely to pay the penalty of that astounding success, and to\ngo down to posterity as the author of a single book. She would\nnot mind this fate.",
        "The poetry of the idea of Freedom and of the sectional struggle\nwhich was necessary before that idea could be realized in\nnational policy is on the whole not commensurate with the\nsignificance of the issue itself. Any collection of American\npolitical verse produced during this period exhibits spirited and\nsincere writing, but the combination of mature literary art and\nimpressive general ideas is comparatively rare. There are single\npoems of Whittier, Lowell, and Whitman which meet every test of\neffective political and social verse, but the main body of\npoetry, both sectional and national, written during the thirty\nyears ending with 1865 lacks breadth, power, imaginative daring.\nThe continental spaciousness and energy which foreign critics\nthought they discovered in Whitman is not characteristic of our\npoetry as a whole. Victor Hugo and Shelley and Swinburne have\nwritten far more magnificent republican poetry than ours. The\npassion for freedom has been very real upon this side of the\nAtlantic; it pulsed in the local loyalty of the men who sang\n\"Dixie” as well as in their antagonists who chanted “John Brown’s\nBody” and “The Battle Hymn of the Republic;” but this passion has\nnot yet lifted and ennobled any notable mass of American verse.\nEven the sentiment of union was more adequately voiced in\neditorials and sermons and orations, even in a short\nstory–Edward Everett Hale’s “Man Without a Country\"–than by\nmost\nof the poets who attempted to glorify that theme.",
        "Nevertheless the verse of these thirty years is rich in\nprovincial and sectional loyalties. It has earnestness and\npathos. We have, indeed, no adequate national anthem, even yet,\nfor neither the words nor the music of “The Star-Spangled Banner\"\nfully express what we feel while we are trying to sing it, as the\n\"Marseillaise,” for example, does express the very spirit of\nrevolutionary republicanism. But in true pioneer fashion we get\nalong with a makeshift until something better turns up. The lyric\nand narrative verse of the Civil War itself was great in\nquantity, and not more inferior in quality than the war verse of\nother nations has often proved to be when read after the\nimmediate occasion for it has passed. Single lyrics by Timrod and\nPaul Hayne, Boker, H. H. Brownell, Read, Stedman, and other men\nare still full of fire. Yet Mrs. Howe’s “Battle Hymn,” scribbled\nhastily in the gray dawn, interpreted, as no other lyric of the\nwar quite succeeded in interpreting, the mystical glory of\nsacrifice for Freedom. Soldiers sang it in camp; women read it\nwith tears; children repeated it in school, vaguely but truly\nperceiving in it, as their fathers had perceived in Webster’s\n\"Reply to Hayne” thirty years before, the idea of union made\n\"simple, sensuous, passionate.” No American poem has had a more\ndramatic and intense life in the quick breathing imagination of\nmen.",
        "More and more, however, the instinct of our people is turning to\nthe words of Abraham Lincoln as the truest embodiment in\nlanguage, as his life was the truest embodiment in action, of our\nnational ideal. It is a curious reversal of contemporary\njudgments that thus discovers in the homely phrases of a frontier\nlawyer the most perfect literary expression of the deeper spirit\nof his time. “How knoweth this man letters, having never\nlearned?” asked the critical East. The answer is that he had\nlearned in a better school than the East afforded. The story of\nLincoln’s life is happily too familiar to need retelling here,\nbut some of the elements in his growth in the mastery of speech\nmay at least be summarized.",
        "Lincoln had a slow, tireless mind, capable of intense\nconcentration. It was characteristic of him that he rarely took\nnotes when trying a law case, saying that the notes distracted\nhis attention. When his partner Herndon was asked when Lincoln\nhad found time to study out the constitutional history of the\nUnited States, Herndon expressed the opinion that it was when\nLincoln was lying on his back on the office sofa, apparently\nwatching the flies upon the ceiling. This combination of bodily\nrepose with intense mental and spiritual activity is familiar to\nthose who have studied the biography of some of the great\nmystics. Walter Pater pointed it out in the case of Wordsworth.",
        "In recalling the poverty and restriction of Lincoln’s boyhood and\nhis infrequent contact with schoolhouses, it is well to remember\nthat he managed nevertheless to read every book within twenty\nmiles of him. These were not many, it is true, but they included\n\"The Bible,” “Aesop’s Fables,” “Pilgrim’s Progress,” “Robinson\nCrusoe,” and, a little later, Burns and Shakespeare. Better food\nthan this for the mind of a boy has never been found. Then he\ncame to the history of his own country since the Declaration of\nIndependence and mastered it. “I am tolerably well acquainted\nwith the history of the country,” he remarked in his Chicago\nspeech of 1858; and in the Cooper Union speech of 1860 he\nexhibited a familiarity with the theory and history of the\nConstitution which amazed the young lawyers who prepared an\nannotated edition of the address. “He has wit, facts, dates,\"\nsaid Douglas, in extenuation of his own disinclination to enter\nupon the famous joint debates, and, when Douglas returned to\nWashington after the debates were over, he confessed to the young\nHenry Watterson that “he is the greatest debater I have ever met,\neither here or anywhere else.” Douglas had won the senatorship\nand could afford to be generous, but he knew well enough that his\nopponent’s facts and dates had been unanswerable. Lincoln’s\nmental grip, indeed, was the grip of a born wrestler. “I’ve got\nhim,” he had exclaimed toward the end of the first debate, and\nthe Protean Little Giant, as Douglas was called, had turned and\ntwisted in vain, caught by “that long-armed creature from\nIllinois.” He would indeed win the election of 1858, but he had\nbeen forced into an interpretation of the Dred Scott decision\nwhich cost him the Presidency in 1860.",
        "Lincoln’s keen interest in words and definitions, his patience in\nsearching the dictionary, is known to every student of his life.\nPart of his singular discrimination in the use of language is due\nto his legal training, but his style was never professionalized.\nNeither did it have anything of that frontier glibness and\nbanality which was the curse of popular oratory in the West and\nSouth. Words were weapons in the hands of this self-taught\nfighter for ideas: he kept their edges sharp, and could if\nnecessary use them with deadly accuracy. He framed the “Freeport\ndilemma” for the unwary feet of Douglas as cunningly as a\nfox-hunter lays his trap. “Gentlemen,” he had said of an earlier\neffort, “Judge Douglas informed you that this speech of mine was\nprobably carefully prepared. I ADMIT THAT IT WAS.”",
        "The story, too, was a weapon of attack and defense for this\nmaster fabulist. Sometimes it was a readier mode of argument than\nany syllogism; sometimes it gave him, like the traditional\ndiplomatist’s pinch of snuff, an excuse for pausing while he\nstudied his adversary or made up his own mind; sometimes, with\nthe instinct of a poetic soul, he invented a parable and gravely\ngave it a historic setting “over in Sangamon County.” For\nalthough upon his intellectual side the man was a subtle and\nsevere logician, on his emotional side he was a lover of the\nconcrete and human. He was always, like John Bunyan, dreaming and\nseeing “a man” who symbolized something apposite to the occasion.\nThus even his invented stories aided his marvelous capacity for\nstatement, for specific illustration of a general law. Lincoln’s\ndestiny was to be that of an explainer, at first to a local\naudience in store or tavern or courtroom, then to upturned\nserious faces of Illinois farmers who wished to hear national\nissues made clear to them, then to a listening nation in the\nagony of civil war, and ultimately to a world which looks to\nLincoln as an exponent and interpreter of the essence of\ndemocracy.",
        "As the audience increased, the style took on beauty and breadth,\nas if the man’s soul were looking through wider and wider windows\nat the world. But it always remained the simplest of styles. In\nan offhand reply to a serenade by an Indiana regiment, or in\nanswering a visiting deputation of clergymen at the White House,\nLincoln could summarize and clarify a complicated national\nsituation with an ease and orderliness and fascination that are\nthe despair of professional historians. He never wasted a word.\n\"Go to work is the only cure for your case,” he wrote to John D.\nJohnston. There are ten words in that sentence and none of over\nfour letters. The “Gettysburg Address” contains but two hundred\nand seventy words, in ten sentences. “It is a flat failure,” said\nLincoln despondently; but Edward Everett, who had delivered “the\"\noration of that day, wrote to the President: “I should be glad if\nI could flatter myself that I came as near to the central idea of\nthe occasion in two hours as you did in two minutes.” Today the\n\"Address” reads as if Lincoln knew that it would ultimately be\nstamped in bronze.",
        "Yet the real test of Lincoln’s supremacy in our distinctly civic\nliterature lies not so much in his skill in the manipulation of\nlanguage, consummate as that was, but rather in those large\nelements of his nature which enabled him to perceive the true\nquality and ideal of American citizenship and its significance to\nthe world. There was melancholy in that nature, else there had\nbeen a less rich humor; there was mysticism and a sense of\nreligion which steadily deepened as his responsibilities\nincreased. There was friendliness, magnanimity, pity for the\nsorrowful, patience for the slow of brain and heart, and an\nexpectation for the future of humanity which may best be\ndescribed in the old phrase “waiting for the Kingdom of God.” His\nrecurrent dream of the ship coming into port under full sail,\nwhich preluded many important events in his own life–he had it\nthe night before he was assassinated–is significant not only of\nthat triumph of a free nation which he helped to make possible,\nbut also of the victory of what he loved to call “the whole\nfamily of man.” “That is the real issue,” he had declared in\nclosing the debates with Douglas; “that is the issue that will\ncontinue in this country when these poor tongues of Judge Douglas\nand myself shall be silent. It is the eternal struggle between\nthese two principles–right and wrong–throughout the world. They\nare the two principles that have stood face to face from the\nbeginning of time; and will ever continue to struggle. The one is\nthe common right of humanity, and the other the divine right of\nkings.”",
        "For this representative Anglo-Saxon man, developed under purely\nAmerican conditions, maturing slowly, keeping close to facts,\ndying, like the old English saint, while he was “still learning,\"\nhad none of the typical hardness and selfishness of the\nAnglo-Saxon. A brooder and idealist, he was one of those\n\"prophetic souls of the wide world dreaming on things to come,\"\nwith sympathies and imagination that reached out beyond the\nimmediate urgencies of his race and nation to comprehend the\nuniversal task and discipline of the sons of men. In true\nfraternity and democracy this Westerner was not only far in\nadvance of his own day, but he is also far in advance of ours\nwhich raises statues to his memory. Yet he was used to loneliness\nand to the long view, and even across the welter of the World War\nof the twentieth century Lincoln would be tall enough to see that\nship coming into the harbor under full sail.",
        "The changes that have come over the inner spirit and the outward\nexpression of American life since Lincoln’s day are enough to\nstartle the curiosity of the dullest observer. Yet they have been\naccomplished within the lifetime of a single man of letters. The\nauthor of one of the many campaign biographies of Lincoln in 1860\nwas William Dean Howells, then an Ohio journalist of\ntwenty-three. In 1917, at the age of eighty, Mr. Howells is still\nadding to his long row of charming and memorable books. Every\nphase of American writing since the middle of the last century\nhas fallen under the keen and kindly scrutiny of this loyal\nfollower of the art of literature. As producer, editor, critic,\nand friend of the foremost writers of his epoch, Mr. Howells has\nknown the books of our new national era as no one else could have\nknown them. Some future historian of the period may piece\ntogether, from no other sources than Mr. Howells’s writings, an\nunrivaled picture of our book-making during more than sixty\nyears. All that the present historian can attempt is to sketch\nwith bungling fingers a few men and a few tendencies which seem\nto characterize the age.",
        "One result of the Civil War was picturesquely set forth in\nEmerson’s “Journal.” The War had unrolled a map of the Union, he\nsaid, and hung it in every man’s house. There was a universal\nshifting of attention, if not always from the province or section\nto the image of the nation itself, at least a shift of focus from\none section to another. The clash of arms had meant many other\nthings besides the triumph of Union and the freedom of the\nslaves. It had brought men from every state into rude jostling\ncontact with one another and had developed a new social and human\ncuriosity. It may serve as another illustration of Professor\nShaler’s law of tension and release. The one overshadowing issue\nwhich had absorbed so much thought and imagination and energy had\nsuddenly disappeared. Other shadows were to gather, of course.\nReconstruction of the South was one of them, and the vast\neconomic and industrial changes that followed the opening of the\nNew West were to bring fresh problems almost as intricate as the\nquestion of slavery had been. But for the moment no one thought\nof these things. The South accepted defeat as superbly as she had\nfought, and began to plough once more. The jubilant North went\nback to work–to build transcontinental railroads, to organize\ngreat industries, and to create new states.",
        "The significant American literature of the first decade after the\nclose of the War is not in the books dealing directly with themes\ninvolved in the War itself. It is rather the literature of this\nnew release of energy, the new curiosity as to hitherto unknown\nsections, the new humor and romance. Fred Lewis Pattee, the\nauthor of an admirable “History of American Literature since\n1870,” uses scarcely too strong a phrase when he entitles this\nperiod “The Second Discovery of America\"; and he quotes\neffectively from Mark Twain, who was himself one of these\ndiscoverers: “The eight years in America from 1860 to 1868\nuprooted institutions that were centuries old, changed the\npolitics of a people, transformed the social life of half the\ncountry, and wrought so profoundly upon the entire national\ncharacter that the influence cannot be measured short of two or\nthree generations.”",
        "Let us begin with the West, and with that joyous stage-coach\njourney of young Samuel L. Clemens across the plains to Nevada in\n1861, which he describes in “Roughing It.” Who was this Argonaut\nof the new era, and what makes him representative of his\ncountrymen in the epoch of release? Born in Missouri in 1835, the\nson of an impractical emigrant from Virginia, the youth had lived\nfrom his fourth until his eighteenth year on the banks of the\nMississippi. He had learned the printer’s trade, had wandered\neast and back again, had served for four years as a river-pilot\non the Mississippi, and had tried to enter the Confederate army.\nThen came the six crowded years, chiefly as newspaper reporter,\nin the boom times of Nevada and California. His fame began with\nthe publication in New York in 1867 of “The Celebrated Jumping\nFrog of Calaveras County.” A newspaper now sent him to Europe to\nrecord “what he sees with his own eyes.” He did so in “Innocents\nAbroad,” and his countrymen shouted with laughter. This, then,\nwas “Europe” after all–another “fake” until this shrewd river\npilot who signed himself “Mark Twain” took its soundings! Then\ncame a series of far greater books–\"Roughing It,” “Life on the\nMississippi,” “The Gilded Age (in collaboration ), and “Tom\nSawyer” and “Huckleberry Finn\"–books that make our American\n\"Odyssey”, rich in the spirit of romance and revealing the magic\nof the great river as no other pages can ever do again. Gradually\nMark Twain became a public character; he retrieved on the lecture\nplatform the loss of a fortune earned by his books; he enjoyed\nhis honorary D. Litt. from Oxford University. Every reader of\nAmerican periodicals came to recognize the photographs of that\nthick shock of hair, those heavy eyebrows, the gallant drooping\nlittle figure, the striking clothes, the inevitable cigar: all\nthese things seemed to go with the part of professional humorist,\nto be like the caressing drawl of Mark’s voice. The force of\nadvertisement could no further go. But at bottom he was far other\nthan a mere maker of boisterous jokes for people with frontier\npreferences in humor. He was a passionate, chivalric lover of\nthings fair and good, although too honest to pretend to see\nbeauty and goodness where he could not personally detect\nthem–and\nan equally passionate hater of evil. Read “The Man Who Corrupted\nHadleyburg” and “The Mysterious Stranger.” In his last years,\ntorn by private sorrows, he turned as black a philosophical\npessimist as we have bred. He died at his new country seat in\nConnecticut in 1910. Mr. Paine has written his life in three\ngreat volumes, and there is a twenty-five volume edition of his\n\"Works.”",
        "All the evidence seems to be in. Yet the verdict of the public\nseems not quite made up. It is clear that Mark Twain the writer\nof romance is gaining upon Mark Twain the humorist. The\ninexhaustible American appetite for frontier types of humor\nseizes upon each new variety, crunches it with huge satisfaction,\nand then tosses it away. John Phoenix, Josh Billings, Jack\nDowning, Bill Arp, Petroleum V. Nasby, Artemus Ward, Bill Nye–\nthese are already obsolescent names. If Clemens lacked something\nof Artemus Ward’s whimsical delicacy and of Josh Billings’s\ntested human wisdom, he surpassed all of his competitors in a\ncertain rude, healthy masculinity, the humor of river and\nmining-camp and printing-office, where men speak without\ncensorship. His country-men liked exaggeration, and he\nexaggerated; they liked irreverence, and he had turned iconoclast\nin “Innocents Abroad.” As a professional humorist, he has paid\nthe obligatory tax for his extravagance, over-emphasis, and\nundisciplined taste, but such faults are swiftly forgotten when\none turns to Huckleberry Finn and the negro Jim and Pudd’nhead\nWilson, when one feels Mark Twain’s power in sheer description\nand episode, his magic in evoking landscape and atmosphere, his\nblazing scorn at injustice and cruelty, his contempt for quacks.",
        "Bret Harte, another discoverer of the West, wears less well than\nMark Twain as a personal figure, but has a sure place in the\nevolution of the American short story, and he did for the\nmining-camps of California what Clemens wrought for the\nMississippi River: he became their profane poet. Yet he was never\nreally of them. He was the clever outsider, with a prospector’s\neye, looking for literary material, and finding a whole rich mine\nof it–a bigger and richer, in fact, than he was really qualified\nto work. But he located a golden vein of it with an instinct that\ndid credit to his dash of Hebrew blood. Born in Albany, a\nteacher’s son, brought up on books and in many cities, Harte\nemigrated to California in 1854 at the age of sixteen. He became\nin turn a drug-clerk, teacher, type-setter, editor, and even\nSecretary of the California Mint–his nearest approach,\napparently, to the actual work of the mines. In 1868, while\neditor of “The Overland Monthly,” he wrote the short story which\nwas destined to make him famous in the East and to release him\nfrom California forever. It was “The Luck of Roaring Camp.” He\nhad been writing romantic sketches in prose and verse for years;\nhe had steeped himself in Dickens, like everybody else in the\neighteen-sixties; and now he saw his pay-gravel shining back into\nhis own shining eyes. It was a pocket, perhaps, rather than a\nlead, but Bret Harte worked to the end of his career this\nmaterial furnished by the camps, this method of the short story.\nHe never returned to California after his joyous exit in 1871.\nFor a few years he tried living in New York, but from 1878 until\nhis death in 1902 Bret Harte lived in Europe, still turning out\nCalifornia stories for an English and American public which\ninsisted upon that particular pattern.",
        "That the pattern was arbitrary, theatrical, sentimental, somewhat\nmeretricious in design, in a word insincere like its inventor,\nhas been repeated at due intervals ever since 1868. The charge is\ntrue; yet it is far from the whole truth concerning Bret Harte’s\nartistry. In mastery of the technique of the short story he is\nfairly comparable with Poe, though less original, for it was Poe\nwho formulated, when Bret Harte was a child of six, the\nwell-known theory of the unity of effect of the brief tale. This\nunity Harte secured through a simplification, often an\ninsulation, of his theme, the omission of quarreling details, an\natmosphere none the less novel for its occasional theatricality,\nand characters cunningly modulated to the one note they were\nintended to strike. “Tennessee’s Partner,” “The Outcast of Poker\nFlat,” and all the rest are triumphs of selective skill–as\nbright nuggets as ever glistened in the pan at the end of a hard\nday’s labor. That they do not adequately represent the actual\nCalifornia of the fifties, as old Californians obstinately\ninsist, is doubtless true, but it is beside the point. Here is no\nTolstoi painting the soul of his race in a few pages: Harte is\nsimply a disciple of Poe and Dickens, turning the Poe\nconstruction trick gracefully, with Dickensy characters and\nconsistently romantic action.",
        "The West has been rediscovered many a time since that decade\nwhich witnessed the first literary bonanza of Mark Twain and Bret\nHarte. It will continue to be discovered, in its fresh sources of\nappeal to the imagination, as long as Plains and Rockies and\nCoast endure, as long as there is any glow upon a distant\nhorizon. It is not places that lose romantic interest: the\nimmemorial English counties and the Bay of Naples offer\nthemselves freely to the artist, generation after generation.\nWhat is lost is the glamour of youth, the specific atmosphere of\na given historical epoch. Colonel W. F. Cody (\"Buffalo Bill”) has\ntypified to millions of American boys the great period of the\nPlains, with its Indian fighting, its slaughter of buffaloes, its\nrobbing of stage-coaches, its superb riders etched against the\nsky. But the Wild West was retreating, even in the days of Daniel\nBoone and Davy Crockett. The West of the cowboys, as Theodore\nRoosevelt and Owen Wister knew it and wrote of it in the eighties\nand nineties, has disappeared, though it lives on in fiction and\non the screen.",
        "Jack London, born in California in 1876, was forced to find his\nWest in Alaska–and in alcohol. He was what he and his followers\nliked to call the virile or red-blooded type, responsive to the\n\"Call of the Wild,” “living life naked and tensely.” In his talk\nJack London was simple and boyish, with plenty of humor over his\nown literary and social foibles. His books are very uneven, but\nhe wrote many a hard-muscled, clean-cut page. If the Bret Harte\ntheory of the West was that each man is at bottom, a\nsentimentalist, Jack London’s formula was that at bottom every\nman is a brute. Each theory gave provender enough for a\nshort-story writer to carry on his back, but is hardly adequate,\nby itself, for a very long voyage over human life.",
        "“Joaquin” (Cincinnatus Heine) Miller, who was born in 1841 and\ndied in 1918, had even less of a formula for the West than Jack\nLondon. He was a word-painter of its landscapes, a rider over its\nsurfaces. Cradled “in a covered wagon pointing West,” mingling\nwith wild frontier life from Alaska to Nicaragua, miner, Indian\nfighter, hermit, poseur in London and Washington, then hermit\nagain in California, the author of “Songs of the Sierras” at\nleast knew his material. Byron, whom he adored and imitated,\ncould have invented nothing more romantic than Joaquin’s life;\nbut though Joaquin inherited Scotch intensity, he had nothing of\nthe close mental grip of the true Scot and nothing of his humor.\nVast stretches of his poetry are empty; some of it is grandiose,\nelemental, and yet somehow artificial, as even the Grand Canyon\nitself looks at certain times.",
        "John Muir, another immigrant Scot who reached California in 1868,\nhad far more stuff in him than Joaquin Miller. He had studied\ngeology, botany, and chemistry at the new University of\nWisconsin, and then for years turned explorer of forests, peaks,\nand glaciers, not writing, at first, except in his “Journal,” but\nforever absorbing and worshiping sublimity and beauty with no\nthought of literary schemes. Yet his every-day talk about his\nfavorite trees and glaciers had more of the glow of poetry in it\nthan any talk I have ever heard from men of letters, and his\nbooks and “Journal” will long perpetuate this thrilling sense of\npersonal contact with wild, clean, uplifted things–blossoms in\ngiant tree-tops and snow-eddies blowing round the shoulders of\nAlaskan peaks. Here is a West as far above Jack London’s and\nFrank Norris’s as the snow-line is higher than the jungle.",
        "The rediscovery of the South was not so much an exploration of\nfresh or forgotten geographical territory, as it was a new\nperception of the romantic human material offered by a peculiar\ncivilization. Political and social causes had long kept the South\nin isolation. A few writers like Wirt, Kennedy, Longstreet,\nSimms, had described various aspects of its life with grace or\nvivacity, but the best picture of colonial Virginia had been\ndrawn, after all, by Thackeray, who had merely read about it in\nbooks. Visitors like Fanny Kemble and Frederick Law Olmsted\nsketched the South of the mid-nineteenth century more vividly\nthan did the sons of the soil. There was no real literary public\nin the South for a native writer like Simms. He was as dependent\nupon New York and the Northern market as a Virginian\ntobacco-planter of 1740 had been upon London. But within a dozen\nyears after the close of the War and culminating in the\neighteen-nineties, there came a rich and varied harvest of\nSouthern writing, notably in the field of fiction. The public for\nthese stories, it is true, was still largely in the North and\nWest, and it was the magazines and publishing-houses of New York\nand Boston that gave the Southern authors their chief stimulus\nand support. It was one of the happy proofs of the solidarity of\nthe new nation.",
        "The romance of the Spanish and French civilization of New\nOrleans, as revealed in Mr. Cable’s fascinating “Old Creole\nDays,” was recognized, not as something merely provincial in its\nsignificance, but as contributing to the infinitely variegated\npattern of our national life. Irwin Russell, Joel Chandler\nHarris, and Thomas Nelson Page portrayed in verse and prose the\nhumorous, pathetic, unique traits of the Southern negro, a type\nhitherto chiefly sketched in caricature or by strangers. Page,\nHopkinson Smith, Grace King, and a score of other artists began\nto draw affectionate pictures of the vanished Southern mansion of\nplantation days, when all the women were beautiful and all the\nmen were brave, when the very horses were more spirited and the\ndogs lazier and the honeysuckles sweeter and the moonlight more\nentrancing than today. Miss Murfree (\"C. E. Craddock”) charmed\ncity-dwellers and country-folk alike by her novels of the\nTennessee mountains. James Lane Allen painted lovingly the\nhemp-fields and pastures of Kentucky. American magazines of the\ndecade from 1880 to 1890 show the complete triumph of dialect and\nlocal color, and this movement, so full of interest to students\nof the immense divergence of American types, owed much of its\nvitality to the talent of Southern writers.",
        "But the impulse spread far beyond the South. Early in the\nseventies Edward Eggleston wrote “The Hoosier Schoolmaster” and\n\"The Circuit Rider,” faithful and moving presentations of genuine\npioneer types which were destined to pass with the frontier\nsettlements. Soon James Whitcomb Riley was to sing of the next\ngeneration of Hoosiers, who frequented “The Old Swimmin’ Hole\"\nand rejoiced “When the Frost is on the Punkin.” It was the era of\nDenman Thompson’s plays, “Joshua Whitcomb” and “The Old\nHomestead.” Both the homely and the exotic marched under this\nbanner of local color: Hamlin Garland presented Iowa barnyards\nand cornfields, Helen Hunt Jackson dreamed the romance of the\nMission Indian in “Ramona,” and Lafcadio Hearn, Irish and Greek\nby blood, resident of New Orleans and not yet an adopted citizen\nof Japan, tantalized American readers with his “Chinese Ghosts\"\nand “Chita.” A fascinating period it seems, as one looks back\nupon it, and it lasted until about the end of the century, when\nthe suddenly discovered commercial value of the historical novel\nand the ensuing competition in best sellers misled many a fine\nartistic talent and coarsened the public taste. The New South\nthen played the literary market as recklessly as the New West.",
        "Let us glance back to “the abandoned farm of literature,” as a\nwitty New Yorker once characterized New England. The last quarter\nof the nineteenth century witnessed a decline in the direct\ninfluence of that province over the country as a whole. Its\nstrength sapped by the emigration of its more vigorous sons, its\ntypical institutions sagging under the weight of immense\nimmigrations from Europe, its political importance growing more\nand more negligible, that ancient promontory of ideas has\ncontinued to lose its relative literary significance. In one\nfield of literature only has New England maintained its rank\nsince the Civil War, and that is in the local short story. Here\nwomen have distinguished themselves beyond the proved capacity of\nNew England men. Mrs. Stowe and Rose Terry Cooke, women of\ndemocratic humor, were the pioneers; then came Harriet Prescott\nSpofford and Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, women with nerves; and\nfinally the three artists who have written, out of the material\noffered by a decadent New England, as perfect short stories as\nFrance or Russia can produce–Sarah Orne Jewett, Mary Wilkins\nFreeman, and Alice Brown. These gifted writers portrayed, with\nvarying technique and with singular differences in their\ninstinctive choice of material, the dominant qualities of an\nisolated, in-bred race, still proud in its decline; still\ninquisitive and acquisitive, versatile yet stubborn, with thrift\npassing over into avarice, and mental power degenerating into\nsmartness; cold and hard under long repression of emotion, yet\ncapable of passion and fanaticism; at worst, a mere trader, a\ncrank, a grim recluse; at best, endowed with an austere physical\nand moral beauty. Miss Jewett preferred to touch graciously the\nsunnier slopes of this provincial temperament, to linger in its\nancient dignities and serenities. Miss Brown has shown the pathos\nof its thwarted desires, its hunger for a beauty and a happiness\ndenied. Mary Wilkins Freeman revealed its fundamental tragedies\nof will.",
        "Two of the best known writers of New England fiction in this\nperiod were not natives of the soil, though they surpassed most\nnative New Englanders in their understanding of the type. They\nwere William Dean Howells and Henry James. Mr. Howells, who, in\nhis own words, “can reasonably suppose that it is because of the\nmixture of Welsh, German, and Irish in me that I feel myself so\ntypically American,” came to “the Holy Land at Boston” as a\n\"passionate pilgrim from the West.” “A Boy’s Town,” “My Literary\nPassions,” and “Years of my Youth” make clear the image of the\nyoung poet-journalist who returned from his four years in Venice\nand became assistant editor of “The Atlantic Monthly” in 1866. In\n1871 he succeeded Fields in the editorship, but it was not until\nafter his resignation in 1881 that he could put his full strength\ninto those realistic novels of contemporary New England which\nestablished his fame as a writer. “A Modern Instance” and “The\nRise of Silas Lapham” are perhaps the finest stories of this\ngroup; and the latter novel may prove to be Mr. Howells’s chief\n\"visiting-card to posterity.” We cannot here follow him to New\nYork and to a new phase of novel writing, begun with “A Hazard of\nNew Fortunes,” nor can we discuss the now antiquated debate upon\nrealism which was waged in the eighteen-eighties over the books\nof Howells and James. We must content ourselves with saying that\na knowledge of Mr. Howells’s work is essential to the student of\nthe American provincial novel, as it is also to the student of\nour more generalized types of story-writing, and that he has\nnever in his long career written an insincere, a slovenly, or an\ninfelicitous page. “My Literary Friends and Acquaintance” gives\nthe most charming picture ever drawn of the elder Cambridge,\nConcord, and Boston men who ruled over our literature when young\nHowells came out of the West, and “My Mark Twain” is his\nmemorable portrait of another type of sovereign, perhaps the\ndynasty that will rule the future.",
        "Although Henry James, like Mr. Howells, wrote at one time acute\nstudies of New England character, he was never, in his relations\nto that section, or, for that matter, to any locality save\npossibly London, anything more than a “visiting mind.” His\ngrandfather was an Irish merchant in Albany. His father, Henry\nJames, was a philosopher and wit, a man of comfortable fortune,\nwho lived at times in Newport, Concord, and Boston, but who was\nresiding in New York when his son Henry was born in 1843. No\nchild was ever made the subject of a more complete theory of\nderacination. Transplanted from city to city, from country to\ncountry, without a family or a voting-place, without college or\nchurch or creed or profession or responsibility of any kind save\nto his own exigent ideals of truth and beauty, Henry James came\nto be the very pattern of a cosmopolitan. Avoiding his native\ncountry for nearly thirty years and then returning for a few\nmonths to write some intricate pages about that “American Scene\"\nwhich he understood far less truly than the average immigrant, he\ndied in 1916 in London, having just renounced his American\ncitizenship and become a British subject in order to show his\nsympathy with the Empire, then at war. It was the sole evidence\nof political emotion in a lifetime of seventy-three years.\nAmerican writing men are justly proud, nevertheless, of this\nexpatriated craftsman. The American is inclined to admire good\nworkmanship of any kind, as far as he can understand the\nmechanism of it. The task of really understanding Henry James has\nbeen left chiefly to clever women and to a few critics, but ever\nsince “A Passionate Pilgrim” and “Roderick Hudson” appeared in,\n1875, it has been recognized that here was a master, in his own\nfashion. What that fashion is may now be known by anyone who will\ntake the pains to read the author’s prefaces to the New York\nedition of his revised works. Never, not even in the Paris which\nJames loved, has an artist put his intentions and his\nself-criticism more definitively upon paper. The secret of Henry\nJames is told plainly enough here: a specially equipped\nintelligence, a freedom from normal responsibilities, a consuming\ndesire to create beautiful things, and, as life unfolded its\ncomplexities and nuances before his vision, an increasing passion\nto seek the beauty which lies entangled and betrayed, a beauty\noften adumbrated rather than made plastic, stories that must be\nhinted at rather than told, raptures that exist for the initiated\nonly. The much discussed early and middle and later manners of\nJames are only various campaigns of this one questing spirit,\nchanging his procedure as the elusive object of his search hid\nitself by this or that device of protective coloration or swift\nescape. It is as if a collector of rare butterflies had one\nmethod of capturing them in Madagascar, another for the Orinoco,\nand still another for Japan–though Henry James found his\nJapan–and Orinoco and Madagascar all in London town!",
        "No one who ever had the pleasure of hearing him discourse about\nthe art of fiction can forget the absolute seriousness of his\nprofessional devotion; it was as though a shy celebrant were to\nturn and explain, with mystical intensity and a mystic’s\ninvolution and reversal of all the values of vulgar speech, the\nceremonial of some strange, high altar. His own power as a\ncreative artist was not always commensurate with his intellectual\nendowment or with his desire after beauty, and his frank contempt\nfor the masses of men made it difficult for him to write English.\nHe preferred, as did Browning, who would have liked to reach the\nmasses, a dialect of his own, and he used it increasingly after\nhe was fifty. It was a dialect capable of infinite gradations of\ntone, endless refinements of expression. In his threescore books\nthere are delicious poignant moments where the spirit of life\nitself flutters like a wild creature, half-caught, half-escaping.\nIt is for the beauty and thrill of these moments that the pages\nof Henry James will continue to be cherished by a few thousand\nreaders scattered throughout the Republic to which he was ever an\nalien.",
        "No poet of the new era has won the national recognition enjoyed\nby the veterans. It will be recalled that Bryant survived until\n1878, Longfellow and Emerson until 1882, Lowell until 1891,\nWhittier and Whitman until 1892, and Holmes until 1894. Compared\nwith these men the younger writers of verse seemed overmatched.\nThe “National Ode” for the Centennial celebration in 1876 was\nintrusted to Bayard Taylor, a hearty person, author of capital\nbooks of travel, plentiful verse, and a skilful translation of\n\"Faust.” But an adequate “National Ode” was not in him. Sidney\nLanier, who was writing in that year his “Psalm of the West” and\nwas soon to compose “The Marshes of Glynn,” had far more of the\ndivine fire. He was a bookish Georgia youth who had served with\nthe Confederate army, and afterward, with broken health and in\ndire poverty, gave his brief life to music and poetry. He had\nrich capacities for both arts, but suffered in both from the lack\nof discipline and from an impetuous, restless imagination which\ndrove him on to over-ambitious designs. Whatever the flaws in his\naffluent verse, it has grown constantly in popular favor, and he\nis, after Poe, the best known poet of the South. The late Edmund\nClarence Stedman, whose “American Anthology” and critical\narticles upon American poets did so much to enhance the\nreputation of other men, was himself a maker of ringing lyrics\nand spirited narrative verse. His later days were given\nincreasingly to criticism, and his “Life and Letters” is a\nstorehouse of material bearing upon the growth of New York as a\nliterary market-place during half a century. Richard Watson\nGilder was another admirably fine figure, poet, editor, and\nleader of public opinion in many a noble cause. His “Letters,\"\nlikewise, give an intimate picture of literary New York from the\nseventies to the present. Through his editorship of “Scribner’s\nMonthly” and “The Century Magazine” his sound influence made\nitself felt upon writers in every section. His own lyric vein had\nan opaline intensity of fire, but in spite of its glow his verse\nsometimes refused to sing.",
        "The most perfect poetic craftsman of the period–and, many think,\nour one faultless worker in verse–was Thomas Bailey Aldrich. His\nfirst volume of juvenile verse had appeared in 1855, the year of\nWhittier’s “Barefoot Boy” and Whitman’s “Leaves of Grass.” By\n1865 his poems were printed in the then well-known Blue and Gold\nedition, by Ticknor and Fields. In 1881 he succeeded Howells in\nthe editorship of the “Atlantic.” Aldrich had a versatile talent\nthat turned easily to adroit prose tales, but his heart was in\nthe filing of his verses. Nothing so daintily perfect as his\nlighter pieces has been produced on this side of the Atlantic,\nand the deeper notes and occasional darker questionings of his\nlater verse are embodied in lines of impeccable workmanship.\nAloof from the social and political conflicts of his day, he gave\nhimself to the fastidious creation of beautiful lines, believing\nthat the beautiful line is the surest road to Arcady, and that\nHerrick, whom he idolized, had shown the way.",
        "To some readers of these pages it may seem like profanation to\npass over poets like Sill, George Woodberry, Edith Thomas,\nRichard Hovey, William Vaughn Moody, Madison Cawein–to mention\nbut half a dozen distinguished names out of a larger company–and\nto suggest that James Whitcomb Riley, more completely than any\nAmerican poet since Longfellow, succeeded in expressing the\nactual poetic feelings of the men and women who composed his\nimmense audience. Riley, like Aldrich, went to school to Herrick,\nKeats, Tennyson, and Longfellow, but when he began writing\nnewspaper verse in his native Indiana he was guided by two\nimpulses which gave individuality to his work. “I was always\ntrying to write of the kind of people I knew, and especially to\nwrite verse that I could read just as if it were spoken for the\nfirst time.” The first impulse kept him close to the wholesome\nHoosier soil. The second is an anticipation of Robert Frost’s\ntheory of speech tones as the basis of verse, as well as a\nrevival of the bardic practice of reciting one’s own poems. For\nRiley had much of the actor and platform-artist in him, and\ncomprehended that poetry might be made again a spoken art,\ndirected to the ear rather than to the eye. His vogue, which at\nhis death in 1915 far surpassed that of any living American poet,\nis inexplicable to those persons only who forget the sentimental\ntraditions of our American literature and its frank appeal to the\nemotions of juvenility, actual and recollected. Riley’s best\n\"holt” as a poet was his memory of his own boyhood and his\nperception that the child-mind lingers in every adult reader.\nGenius has often been called the gift of prolonged adolescence,\nand in this sense, surely, there was genius in the warm and\ngentle heart of this fortunate provincial who held that “old\nIndianapolis” was “high Heaven’s sole and only understudy.” No\none has ever had the audacity to say that of New York.",
        "We have had American drama for one hundred and fifty years,* but\nmuch of it, like our popular fiction and poetry, has been\nsubliterary, more interesting to the student of social life and\nnational character than to literary criticism in the narrow sense\nof that term. Few of our best known literary men have written for\nthe stage. The public has preferred melodrama to poetic tragedy,\nalthough perhaps the greatest successes have been scored by plays\nwhich are comedies of manners rather than melodrama, and\ncharacter studies of various American types, built up around the\nknown capabilities of a particular actor. The twentieth century\nhas witnessed a marked activity in play-writing, in the technical\nstudy of the drama, and in experiment with dramatic production,\nparticularly with motion pictures and the out-of-doors pageant.\nAt no time since “The Prince of Parthia” was first acted in\nPhiladelphia in 1767 has such a large percentage of Americans\nbeen artistically and commercially interested in the drama, but\nas to the literary results of the new movement it is too soon to\nspeak.",

        "Nor is it possible to forecast the effect of a still more\nstriking movement of contemporary taste, the revival of interest\nin poetry and the experimentation with new poetical forms. Such\nrevival and experiment have often, in the past, been the preludes\nof great epochs of poetical production. Living Americans have\ncertainly never seen such a widespread demand for contemporary\nverse, such technical curiosity as to the possible forms of\npoetry, or such variety of bold innovation. Imagism itself is\nhardly as novel as its contemporary advocates appear to maintain;\nand free verse goes back far in our English speech and song. But\nthe new generation believes that it has made a discovery in\nreverting to sensations rather than thought, to the naive\nreproduction of retinal and muscular impressions, as if this were\nthe end of the matter.",
        "The self-conscious, self-defending side of the new poetic impulse\nmay soon pass, as it did in the case of Wordsworth and of Victor\nHugo.

        "American fiction seems just now, on the contrary, to be marking\ntime and not to be getting noticeably forward. Few names unknown\nten years ago have won wide recognition in the domain of the\nnovel. The short story has made little technical advance since\nthe first successes of “O. Henry,” though the talent of many\nobservers has dealt with new material offered by the racial\ncharacteristics of European immigrants and by new phases of\ncommerce and industry. The enormous commercial demand of the\nfive-cent weeklies for short stories of a few easily recognized\npatterns has resulted too often in a substitution of\nstencil-plate generalized types instead of delicately and\npowerfully imagined individual characters. Short stories have\nbeen assembled, like Ford cars, with amazing mechanical\nexpertness, but with little artistic advance in design. The same\ntemporary arrest of progress has been noted in France and\nEngland, however, where different causes have been at work.

        "Perhaps the truth is that although we are a reading people we are\nnot yet a book-loving people. The American newspaper and magazine\nhave been successful in making their readers fancy that newspaper\nand magazine are an equivalent for books. Popular orators and\npopular preachers confirm this impression, and colleges and\nuniversities have often emphasized a vocational choice of\nbooks–in other words, books that are not books at all, but\ntreatises. It is not, of course, that American journalism,\nwhether of the daily or monthly sort, has consciously set itself\nto supplant the habit of book-reading. A thousand social and\neconomic factors enter into such a problem. But few observers\nwill question the assertion that the influence of the American\nmagazine, ever since its great period of national literary\nservice in the eighties and nineties, has been more marked in\nthe field of conduct and of artistic taste than in the\nstimulation of a critical literary judgment: An American\nschoolhouse of today owes its improvement in appearance over the\nschoolhouse of fifty years ago largely to the popular diffusion,\nthrough the illustrated magazines, of better standards of\nartistic taste. But–whether the judgment of school-teachers and\nschoolchildren upon a piece of literature is any better than it\nwas in the red schoolhouse of fifty years ago is a disputable\nquestion.",

The\nfundamental problem of our literature, as this book has attempted\nto trace it, has been to obtain from a mixed population dwelling\nin sections as widely separated as the peoples of Northern and\nSouthern Europe, an integral intellectual and spiritual activity\nwhich could express, in obedience to the laws of beauty and\ntruth, the motions stimulated by our national life. It has been\nassumed in the preceding chapters that American literature is\nsomething different from English literature written in America.\nCanadian and Australian literatures have indigenous qualities of\ntheir own, but typically they belong to the colonial literature\nof Great Britain. This can scarcely be said of the writings of\nFranklin and Jefferson, and it certainly cannot be said of the\nwritings of Cooper, Hawthorne, Emerson, Thoreau, Whitman, Lowell,\nLincoln, Mark Twain, and Mr. Howells. In the pages of these men\nand of hundreds of others less distinguished, there is a\nrevelation of a new national type. That the full energies of this\nnation have been back of our books, giving them a range and\nvitality and unity commensurate with the national existence, no\none would claim. There are other spheres of effort in which\nAmerican character has been more adequately expressed than in\nwords. Nevertheless the books are here, in spite of every defect\nin national discipline, every flaw in national character; and\nthey deserve the closest attention from all those who are trying\nto understand the American mind.",
        "If the effort toward an expression of a peculiarly complex\nnational experience has been the problem of our literary past,\nthe literary problem of the future is the expression of the\nadjustment of American ideals to the standards of civilization.\n\"Patriotism,” said the martyred Edith Cavell just before her\ndeath, “is not enough.” Nationality and the instincts of national\nseparatism now seem essential to the preservation of the\npolitical units of the world-state, precisely as a healthy\nindividualism must be the basis of all enduring social\nfellowship. Yet it is clear that civilization is a larger, more\nultimate term than nationality. Chauvinism is nowhere more\nrepellent than in the things of the mind. It is difficult for\nsome Americans to think internationally even in political\naffairs–to construe our national policy and duty in terms of\nobligation to civilization. Nevertheless the task must be faced,\nand we are slowly realizing it.",
        "In the field of literature, likewise, Americanism is not a final\nword either of blame or praise. It is a word of useful\ncharacterization. Only American books, and not books written in\nEnglish in America, can adequately represent our national\ncontribution to the world’s thinking and feeling. So argued\nEmerson and Whitman, long ago. But the younger of these two poets\ncame to realize in his old age that the New World and the Old\nWorld are fundamentally one. The literature of the New World will\ninevitably have an accent of its own, but it must speak the\nmother-language of civilization, share in its culture, accept its\ndiscipline.",
        "It has been said disparagingly of Longfellow and his friends:\n\"The houses of the Brahmins had only eastern windows. The souls\nof the whole school lived in the old lands of culture, and they\nvisited these lands as often as they could, and, returning,\nbrought back whole libraries of books which they eagerly\ntranslated.” But even if Longfellow and his friends had been\nnothing more than translators and diffusers of European culture,\ntheir task would have been justified. They kept the ideals of\ncivilization from perishing in this new soil. Through those\neastern windows came in, and still comes in, the sunlight to\nillumine the American spirit. To decry the literatures of the\nOrient and of Greece and Rome as something now outgrown by\nAmerica, is simply to close the eastern windows, to narrow our\nconception of civilization to merely national and contemporaneous\nterms. It is as provincial to attempt this restriction in\nliterature as it would be in world-politics. We must have all the\nwindows open in our American writing, free access to ideas,\nknowledge of universal standards, perception of universal law.",
