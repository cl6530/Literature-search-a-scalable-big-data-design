        "Once upon a time there lived seven brothers and a sister. The brothers\nwere married, but their wives did not do the cooking for the family. It\nwas done by their sister, who stopped at home to cook. The wives for\nthis reason bore their sister-in-law much ill-will, and at length they\ncombined together to oust her from the office of cook and general\nprovider, so that one of themselves might obtain it. They said, “She\ndoes not go out to the fields to work, but remains quietly at home, and\nyet she has not the meals ready at the proper time.” They then called\nupon their Bonga, and vowing vows unto him they secured his good-will\nand assistance; then they said to the Bonga, “At midday, when our\nsister-in-law goes to bring water, cause it thus to happen, that on\nseeing her pitcher, the water shall vanish, and again slowly re-appear.\nIn this way she will be delayed. Let the water not flow into her\npitcher, and you may keep the maiden as your own.”",
        "At noon when she went to bring water, it suddenly dried up before her,\nand she began to weep. Then after a while the water began slowly to\nrise. When it reached her ankles she tried to fill her pitcher, but it\nwould not go under the water. Being frightened she began to wail and\ncry to her brother:",
        "  “Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my ankles,\n  Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip.”",
        "The water continued to rise until it reached her knee, when she began\nto wail again:",
        "  “Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my knee,\n  Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip.”",
        "The water continued to rise, and when it reached her waist, she cried\nagain:",
        "  “Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my waist,\n  Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip.”",
        "The water still rose, and when it reached her neck she kept on crying:",
        "  “Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my neck,\n  Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip.”",
        "At length the water became so deep that she felt herself drowning, then\nshe cried aloud:",
        "  “Oh! my brother, the water measures a man’s height,\n  Oh! my brother, the pitcher begins to fill.”",
        "The pitcher filled with water, and along with it she sank and was\ndrowned. The Bonga then transformed her into a Bonga like himself, and\ncarried her off.",
        "After a time she re-appeared as a bamboo growing on the embankment of\nthe tank in which she had been drowned. When the bamboo had grown to an\nimmense size, a Jogi, who was in the habit of passing that way, seeing\nit, said to himself, “This will make a splendid fiddle.” So one day he\nbrought an axe to cut it down; but when he was about to begin, the\nbamboo called out, “Do not cut at the root, cut higher up.” When he\nlifted his axe to cut high up the stem, the bamboo cried out, “Do not\ncut near the top, cut at the root.” When the Jogi again prepared\nhimself to cut at the root as requested, the bamboo said, “Do not cut\nat the root, cut higher up;” and when he was about to cut higher up, it\nagain called out to him, “Do not cut high up, cut at the root.” The\nJogi by this time felt sure that a Bonga was trying to frighten him, so\nbecoming angry he cut down the bamboo at the root, and taking it away\nmade a fiddle out of it. The instrument had a superior tone and\ndelighted all who heard it. The Jogi carried it with him when he went\na-begging, and through the influence of its sweet music he returned\nhome every evening with a full wallet.",
        "He now and then visited, when on his rounds, the house of the Bonga\ngirl’s brothers, and the strains of the fiddle affected them greatly.\nSome of them were moved even to tears, for the fiddle seemed to wail as\none in bitter anguish. The elder brother wished to purchase it, and\noffered to support the Jogi for a whole year if he would consent to\npart with his wonderful instrument. The Jogi, however, knew its value,\nand refused to sell it.",
        "It so happened that the Jogi some time after went to the house of a\nvillage chief, and after playing a tune or two on his fiddle asked for\nsomething to eat. They offered to buy his fiddle and promised a high\nprice for it, but he refused to sell it, as his fiddle brought to him\nhis means of livelihood. When they saw that he was not to be prevailed\nupon, they gave him food and a plentiful supply of liquor. Of the\nlatter he drank so freely that he presently became intoxicated. While\nhe was in this condition, they took away his fiddle, and substituted\ntheir own old one for it. When the Jogi recovered, he missed his\ninstrument, and suspecting that it had been stolen asked them to return\nit to him. They denied having taken it, so he had to depart, leaving\nhis fiddle behind him. The chief’s son, being a musician, used to play\non the Jogi’s fiddle, and in his hands the music it gave forth\ndelighted the ears of all who heard it.",
        "When all the household were absent at their labours in the fields, the\nBonga girl used to come out of the bamboo fiddle, and prepared the\nfamily meal. Having eaten her own share, she placed that of the chief’s\nson under his bed, and covering it up to keep off the dust, re-entered\nthe fiddle. This happening every day, the other members of the\nhousehold thought that some girl friend of theirs was in this manner\nshowing her interest in the young man, so they did not trouble\nthemselves to find out how it came about. The young chief, however, was\ndetermined to watch, and see which of his girl friends was so attentive\nto his comfort. He said in his own mind, “I will catch her to-day, and\ngive her a sound beating; she is causing me to be ashamed before the\nothers.” So saying, he hid himself in a corner in a pile of firewood.\nIn a short time the girl came out of the bamboo fiddle, and began to\ndress her hair. Having completed her toilet, she cooked the meal of\nrice as usual, and having eaten some herself, she placed the young\nman’s portion under his bed, as before, and was about to enter the\nfiddle again, when he, running out from his hiding-place, caught her in\nhis arms. The Bonga girl exclaimed, “Fie! Fie! you may be a Dom, or you\nmay be a Hadi of some other caste with whom I cannot marry.” He said,\n“No. But from to-day, you and I are one.” So they began lovingly to\nhold converse with each other. When the others returned home in the\nevening, they saw that she was both a human being and a Bonga, and they\nrejoiced exceedingly.",
        "Now in course of time the Bonga girl’s family became very poor, and her\nbrothers on one occasion came to the chief’s house on a visit.",
        "The Bonga girl recognised them at once, but they did not know who she\nwas. She brought them water on their arrival, and afterwards set cooked\nrice before them. Then sitting down near them, she began in wailing\ntones to upbraid them on account of the treatment she had been\nsubjected to by their wives. She related all that had befallen her, and\nwound up by saying, “You must have known it all, and yet you did not\ninterfere to save me.” And that was all the revenge she took.",
