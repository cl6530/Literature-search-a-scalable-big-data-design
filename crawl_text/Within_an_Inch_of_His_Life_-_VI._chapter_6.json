        "There was nothing more to be done for the magistrate, the commonwealth\nattorney, or the mayor. The doctor might assuredly have used more\npolite language; but people were accustomed to his brutal ways; for it\nis surprising with what readiness men are tolerated in France, under\nthe pretext that they are as they are, and that they must be taken as\nthey are. The three gentlemen, therefore, left the room, after having\nbid farewell to the countess, and after having promised to send the\ncount news of all that might be discovered.",
        "The fire was going out for want of fuel. A few hours had sufficed to\ndestroy all that the hard work and incessant cares of many years had\naccomplished. This charming and much envied estate presented now\nnothing but a few half calcined walls, heaps of black and gray ashes,\nand still glowing timbers, from which columns of smoke were slowly\nrising upward. Thanks to Capt. Parenteau, all that they had been able\nto save had been carried to a distance, and safely stored away under\nthe shelter of the ruins of the old castle. There, furniture and other\narticles were piled up pell-mell. There, carts and agricultural\nmachines were standing about, empty casks, and sacks of oats and rye.\nThere, also, the cattle were gathered, that had been drawn from their\nstalls with infinite labor, and at great risk of life,–horses, oxen,\nsome sheep, and a dozen cows, who lowed piteously. Few of the people\nhad left as yet. With greater zeal than ever the firemen, aided by the\npeasants, deluged the remains of the dwelling-house with water. They\nhad nothing to fear from the fire; but they desired to keep the bodies\nof their unfortunate companions from being entirely consumed.",
        "“What a terrible scourge fire is!” said M. Seneschal.",
        "Neither M. Galpin nor the mayor made any answer. They also felt their\nhearts oppressed by the sad sight before them, in spite of all the\nintense excitement before; for a fire is nothing as long as the\nfeverish excitement, and the hope of saving something, continue to\nkeep us up, and as long as the red flames illumine the horizon; but\nthe next day, when all is over, then we realize the extent of the\nmisfortune.",
        "The firemen recognized the mayor, and greeted him with cheers. He went\nrapidly towards them; and, for the first time since the alarm had been\nraised, the magistrate and the attorney were alone. They were standing\nclose by each other, and for a moment kept silent, while each one\ntried to read in the other’s eyes the secret of his thoughts. At last\nM. Daubigeon asked,–",
        "“Well?”",
        "M. Galpin trembled.",
        "“This is a fearful calamity,” he said.",
        "“What is your opinion?”",
        "“Ah! do I know it myself? I have lost my head: the whole thing looks\nto me like a nightmare.”",
        "“You cannot really believe that M. de Boiscoran is guilty?”",
        "“I believe nothing. My reason tells me he is innocent. I feel he must\nbe innocent; and yet I see terrible evidence rising against him.”",
        "The attorney was overwhelmed.",
        "“Alas!” he said, “why did you, contrary to everybody’s opinion, insist\nupon examining Cocoleu, a poor idiotic wretch?”",
        "But the magistrate remonstrated–",
        "“You do not mean to reproach me, sir, for having followed the impulses\nof my conscience?”",
        "“I reproach you for nothing.”",
        "“A horrible crime has been committed; and my duty compelled me to do\nall that lies in the power of man to discover the culprit.”",
        "“Yes; and the man who is accused of the crime is your friend, and only\nyesterday you spoke of his friendship as your best chance of success\nin life.”",
        "“Sir?”",
        "“Are you surprised to find me so well informed? Ah, you do not know\nthat nothing escapes the idle curiosity of a village. I know that your\ndearest hope was to become a member of M. de Boiscoran’s family, and\nthat you counted upon him to back you in your efforts to obtain the\nhand of one of his cousins.”",
        "“I do not deny that.”",
        "“Unfortunately, you have been tempted by the prestige you might gain\nin a great and famous trial. You have laid aside all prudence; and\nyour projects are forgotten. Whether M. de Boiscoran is innocent or\nguilty, his family will never forgive you your interference. If he is\nguilty, they will blame you for having handed him over to justice: if\nhe is innocent, they will blame you even more for having suspected\nhim.”",
        "M. Galpin hung his head as if to conceal his trouble. Then he asked,–",
        "“And what would you do in my place?”",
        "“I would withdraw from the case, although it is rather late.”",
        "“If I did so, I should risk my career.”",
        "“Even that would be better for you than to engage in an affair in\nwhich you cannot feel the calmness nor the impartiality which are the\nfirst and indispensable virtues of an upright magistrate.”",
        "The latter was becoming impatient. He exclaimed,–",
        "“Sir, do you think I am a man to be turned aside from my duty by\nconsiderations of friendship or personal interest?”",
        "“I said nothing of the kind.”",
        "“Did you not see just now how I carried on the inquiry? Did you see me\nstart when Cocoleu first mentioned M. de Boiscoran’s name? If he had\ndenounced any one else, I should probably have let the matter rest\nthere. But precisely because M. de Boiscoran is a friend of mine, and\nbecause I have great expectations from him, I have insisted and\npersisted, and I do so still.”",
        "The commonwealth attorney shrugged his shoulders.",
        "“That is it exactly,” he said. “Because M. de Boiscoran is a friend of\nyours, you are afraid of being accused of weakness; and you are going\nto be hard, pitiless, unjust even, against him. Because you had great\nexpectations from him, you will insist upon finding him guilty. And\nyou call yourself impartial?”",
        "M. Galpin assumed all his usual rigidity, and said solemnly,–",
        "“I am sure of myself!”",
        "“Have a care!”",
        "“My mind is made up, sir.”",
        "It was time for M. Seneschal to join them again: he returned,\naccompanied by Capt. Parenteau.",
        "“Well, gentlemen,” he asked, “what have you resolved?”",
        "“We are going to Boiscoran,” replied the magistrate.",
        "“What! Immediately?”",
        "“Yes: I wish to find M. de Boiscoran in bed. I am so anxious about it,\nthat I shall do without my clerk.”",
        "Capt. Parenteau bowed, and said,–",
        "“Your clerk is here, sir: he was but just inquiring for you.\"\nThereupon he called out as loud as he could,–",
        "“Mechinet, Mechinet!”",
        "A small gray-haired man, jovial and cheerful, came running up, and at\nonce proceeded to tell at full length how a neighbor had told him what\nhad happened, and how the magistrate had left town, whereupon he,\nalso, had started on foot, and come after him as fast as he could.",
        "“Now will you go to Boiscoran?” asked the mayor.",
        "“I do not know yet. Mechinet will have to look for some conveyance.”",
        "Quick like lightning, the clerk was starting off, when M. Seneschal\nheld him back, saying,–",
        "“Don’t go. I place my horse and my carriage at your disposal. Any one\nof these peasants can drive you. Capt. Parenteau and I will get into\nsome farmer’s wagon, and thus get back to Sauveterre; for we ought to\nbe back as soon as possible. I have just heard alarming news. There\nmay be some disorder. The peasant-women who attend the market have\nbrought in most exciting reports, and exaggerated the calamities of\nlast night. They have started reports that ten or twelve men have been\nkilled, and that the incendiary, M. de Boiscoran, has been arrested.\nThe crowd has gone to poor Guillebault’s widow; and there have been\ndemonstrations before the houses of several of the principal\ninhabitants of Sauveterre.”",
        "In ordinary times, M. Seneschal would not have intrusted his famous\nhorse, Caraby, for any thing in the world, to the hands of a stranger.\nHe considered it the best horse in the province. But he was evidently\nterribly upset, and betrayed it in his manner, and by the very efforts\nhe made to regain his official dignity and self-possession.",
        "He made a sign, and his carriage was brought up, all ready. But, when\nhe asked for somebody to drive, no one came forward. All these good\npeople who had spent the night abroad were in great haste to return\nhome, where their cattle required their presence. When young Ribot saw\nthe others hesitate, he said,–",
        "“Well, I’ll drive the justice.”",
        "And, taking hold of the whip and the reins, he took his seat on the\nfront-bench, while the magistrate, the commonwealth attorney, and the\nclerk filled the vehicle.",
        "“Above all, take care of Caraby,” begged M. Seneschal, who at the last\nmoment felt almost overcome with anxiety for his favorite.",
        "“Don’t be afraid, sir,” replied the young man, as he started the\nhorse. “If I strike too hard, M. Mechinet will stop me.”",
        "This Mechinet, the magistrate’s clerk, was almost a power in\nSauveterre; and the greatest personages there paid their court to him.\nHis official duties were of very humble nature, and ill paid; but he\nknew how to eke out his income by other occupations, of which the\ncourt took no notice; and these added largely both to his importance\nin the community and to his modest income.",
        "As he was a skilful lithographer, he printed all the visiting-cards\nwhich the people of Sauveterre ordered at the principal printing-\noffice of Sauveterre, where “The Independent” was published. An able\naccountant, he kept books and made up accounts for some of the\nprincipal merchants in town. Some of the country people who were fond\nof litigation came to him for legal advice; and he drew up all kinds\nof law papers. For many years now, he had been director of the\nfiremen’s band, and manager of the Orpheon. He was a correspondent of\ncertain Paris societies, and thus obtained free admission to the\ntheatre not only, but also to the sacred precincts behind the scenes.\nFinally he was always ready to give writing-lessons, French lessons to\nlittle girls, or music-lessons on the flute and the horn, to amateurs.",
        "These varied talents had drawn upon him the hostility of all the other\nteachers and public servants of the community, especially that of the\nmayor’s clerk, and the clerks of the bank and great institutions of\nSauveterre. But all these enemies he had gradually conquered by the\nunmistakable superiority of his ability; so that they fell in with the\nuniversal habit, and, when any thing special happened, said to each\nother,–",
        "“Let us go and consult Mechinet.”",
        "He himself concealed, under an appearance of imperturbable good\nnature, the ambition by which he was devoured: he wanted to become\nrich, and to rise in the world. In fact, Mechinet was a diplomat,\nworking in secret, but as cunning as Talleyrand. He had succeeded\nalready in making himself the one great personage of Sauveterre. The\ntown was full of him; nothing was done without him; and yet he had not\nan enemy in the place.",
        "The fact is, people were afraid of him, and dreaded his terrible\ntongue. Not that he had ever injured anybody, he was too wise for\nthat; but they knew the harm he might do, if he chose, as he was\nmaster of every important secret in Sauveterre, and the best informed\nman in town as regarded all their little intrigues, their private\nfoibles, and their dark antecedents.",
        "This gave him quite an exceptional position. As he was unmarried, he\nlived with his sisters, the Misses Mechinet, who were the best\ndressmakers in town, and, moreover, devout members of all kinds of\nreligious societies. Through them he heard all that was going on in\nsociety, and was able to compare the current gossip with what he heard\nin court, or at the newspaper office. Thus he could say pleasantly,–",
        "“How could any thing escape me, when I have the church and the press,\nthe court and the theatre, to keep me informed?”",
        "Such a man would have considered himself disgraced if he had not known\nevery detail of M. de Boiscoran’s private affairs. He did not\nhesitate, therefore, while the carriage was rolling along on an\nexcellent road, in the fresh spring morning, to explain to his\ncompanions the “case,” as he called it, of the accused nobleman.",
        "M. de Boiscoran, called Jacques by his friends, was rarely on his\nestate, and then only staid a month or so there. He was living in\nParis, where his family owned a comfortable house in University\nStreet. His parents were still alive.",
        "His father, the Marquis de Boiscoran, the owner of a large landed\nestate, a deputy under Louis Philippe, a representative in 1848, had\nwithdrawn from public life when the Second Empire was established, and\nspent, since that time, all his money, and all his energies, in\ncollecting rare old books, and especially costly porcelain, on which\nhe had written a monograph.",
        "His mother, a Chalusse by birth, had enjoyed the reputation of being\none of the most beautiful and most gifted ladies at the court of the\nCitizen King. At a certain period in her life, unfortunately, slander\nhad attacked her; and about 1845 or 1846, it was reported that she had\nhad a remarkable affair with a young lawyer of distinction, who had\nsince become one of the austerest and most renowned judges. As she\ngrew old, the marchioness devoted herself more and more to politics,\nas other women become pious. While her husband boasted that he had not\nread a newspaper for ten years, she had made her /salon/ a kind of\nparliamentary centre, which had its influence on political affairs.",
        "Although Jacques de Boiscoran’s parents were still alive, he possessed\na considerable fortune of his own–five or six thousand dollars a\nyear. This fortune, which consisted of the Chateau of Boiscoran, the\nfarms, meadows, and forests belonging to it, had been left to him by\none of his uncles, the oldest brother of his father, who had died a\nwidower, and childless, in 1868. M. de Boiscoran was at this moment\nabout twenty-six or twenty-seven years old, dark complexion, tall,\nstrong, well made, not exactly a handsome man, but having, what was\nworth more, one of those frank, intelligent faces which prepossess one\nat first sight.",
        "His character was less well known at Sauveterre than his person. Those\nwho had had any business with him described him as an honorable,\nupright man: his companions spoke of him as cheerful and gay, fond of\npleasure, and always in good humor. At the time of the Prussian\ninvasion, he had been made a captain of one of the volunteer companies\nof the district. He had led his men bravely under fire, and conducted\nhimself so well on the battlefield, that Gen. Chanzy had rewarded him,\nwhen wounded, with the cross of the legion of honor.",
        "“And such a man should have committed such a crime at Valpinson,” said\nM. Daubigeon to the magistrate. “No, it is impossible! And no doubt he\nwill very easily scatter all our doubts to the four winds.”",
        "“And that will be done at once,” said young Ribot; “for here we are.”",
        "In many of the provinces of France the name of /chateau/ is given to\nalmost any little country-house with a weathercock on its pointed\nroof. But Boiscoran was a real chateau. It had been built towards the\nend of the seventeenth century, in wretched taste, but massively, like\na fortress. Its position is superb. It is surrounded on all sides by\nwoods and forests; and at the foot of the sloping garden flows a\nlittle river, merrily splashing over its pebbly bed, and called the\nMagpie on account of its perpetual babbling.",
