        "The white flag went up at one o’clock on the 11th, and this was the\nend of the fighting at Santiago. The Rough Riders had been moved from\nthe hill at Fort Roosevelt to a position west of the El Caney road,\nand one of the Gatling guns had been sent with them. This gun was\nbrought back on the 17th after the surrender. Various other movements\nof troops occurred before the 17th, which had been decided upon by the\ngenerals as the last day of grace. Gen. Toral had been notified that\none o’clock on the 17th was the time for either the surrender or the\nsignal for the assault. The hour approached, and still the Spaniard\nattempted to delay. The orders for the assault were issued. The troops\nlay in the trenches with their fingers on the triggers. Gen. Randolph\nhad come and pushed the artillery into better positions. The pieces\nwere loaded and the gunners stood with their lanyards in their hands.\nThe ammunition-boxes were opened. The nervous tension of the line was\nterrific. The troops on the extreme right and left, designated for the\nassault, were only waiting the word to dash forward upon the\nintrenchments of the enemy. Then suddenly from Gen. Wheeler’s\nheadquarters a mounted officer was seen spurring eastward along the\ncrest. He was waving his hat over his head. His horse gathered speed,\nand the foam began to fly from his flanks and nostrils, and as Capt.\nMcKittrick passed he called, “No cheering, please; the city and\nprovince of Santiago have surrendered.”",
        "The members of the Gatling Gun Detachment walked to the top of the\nhill, and, facing toward the gallant enemy who had so valiantly\ndefended the foredoomed city, silently took off their hats.",
        "All along the line the reception of the glorious news was marked by\ncomments upon the gallant defense which had been made. There was no\ndemonstration which could have hurt the feelings of so magnificent a\nfoe. Five minutes after the surrender the American trench was lined by\nAmerican troops on our side and Spanish troops on the other. The\nSpanish troops brought bottles of mescal, aguardiente, and wine. Our\ntroops carried hardtack and canned roast beef. These recent foes began\nat once to exchange the necessaries of life and souvenirs of the siege\nof Santiago. They fraternized as all brave men do after the battle. A\nfew Cubans skulked around the rear of our line, despised by both\nsides.",
        "The next day witnessed the formal surrender of the city. At twelve\no’clock, the preliminary formalities having been complied with, the\n9th Infantry and a battalion of the 13th Infantry, the two regiments\nwhich had been adjudged first honors in the assault, were ready as an\nescort to raise the flag in the heart of the city. All of the other\nregiments were formed upon the ground which they occupied during the\nsiege. As the second-hands of our watches showed the minute of twelve,\nnoon, a field-piece burst upon the stillness of the sultry day, and\nthe band began the strains of “The Star-spangled Banner.” Every hat\nwas taken off, and an instant later, efforts to restrain it being\nineffectual, six miles of solid cheering encompassed the latest\nAmerican city.",
        "Grizzled old soldiers, scarred with wounds from Indian wars, and gay\nrecruits who had arrived too late to join in the fighting, gray-haired\ngenerals and athletic young subalterns, all forgot propriety and the\nsilence usually enjoined in ranks and joined in that tremendous yell.\nFrom over on the right of the El Caney road we could hear the “Rah!\nrah! rah!” of Harvard and the “Rah! rah! rah!” of Yale, mingled with\nthe cowboy yell of the Indian Territory. From the ranks of the\nRegulars came the old Southern yell, mingled with the Northern cheer.\nThe most thrilling and dramatic moment of the Spanish-American War had\npassed into history.",
        "The troops settled themselves down to wait for developments, and while\nthey waited, opportunities were presented for the first time to make\nobservations of the personnel of this heterogeneous army.",
        "The American Regular is a type of his own, and no description of him\nis necessary. He was the fighting strength of the 5th Corps. Only\nthree Volunteer regiments participated in the charges of July 1st-the\n71st New York, the 2d Massachusetts, and the 1st Volunteer Cavalry.",
        "The Volunteers presented many different types: some good, some\notherwise. There should be no sympathy with that servile truckling to\npopular sentiment which speaks of our brave Volunteers indiscriminately,\nas if they were all good and all equally well instructed. There were\nVolunteers who were the equals of the Regulars in fighting and in\nleadership. And there were some who should have been at home pulling\non a nursing-bottle or attending a kindergarten. To praise them\nindiscriminately creates a false impression on the public, and works a\nrank injustice toward those who were really good and efficient in the\nservice. It does even worse than that: it fosters the popular idea\nthat all there is to do to make soldiers is to take so many laborers,\nclerks, hod-carriers, or farmers, and put on them uniforms, arm them\nwith rifles, and call them “gallant Volunteers”! Out upon such an\ninsane delusion!",
        "Fighting is a scientific trade. It would be no more absurd to give an\nidiot a tambourine and call him a musician–he would be an idiot all\nthe same. So with the clerk, the laborer, the hod-carrier, the\nteacher; he remains the same in spite of all the polished arms,\nresplendent uniforms, and pompous titles bestowed upon him. He remains\njust what he was before, until he learns his new trade and becomes a\nsoldier by the acquisition of the necessary knowledge and experience\nto practice his new calling.",
        "It is one of the duties of trained officers to tell these homely\ntruths to the people who have not made a study of the matter, in order\nthat they who foot the bills may understand what they pay for and why\nthey do it. And it is equally the duty of the citizen who has no\nknowledge of the subject to give a fair hearing to such statements,\nand, if he finds them correct after due investigation, to translate\nthe information thus imparted into such laws as will in future supply\nan army composed of soldiers who can fight, instead of a herd of\nignorant incompetents who die like rotten sheep within half an hour’s\nride by rail of their own homes.",
        "These remarks can be illustrated by observations in Cuba.",
        "For example, the 34th Michigan pitched its camp on the hill at Fort\nRoosevelt on the 2d of August. They were in an awful condition. A man\nhad died in one company the day before, and there had not been enough\nable-bodied men in the company to bury him. A detail had to be made\nfrom another company to dig the grave. More than fifty per cent of the\nregiment were sick, and the remainder were far from well. At this\ntime, more than two weeks after the surrender, they were still cooking\nindividually. Within fifteen minutes after their arrival they were\noverrunning the Gatling gun camp, picking up the firewood which had\nbeen gathered by the detachment for cooking purposes. An attempt to\nstop this marauding was received with jeers. A green-looking Wolverine\nat once began to make catcalls, and was ably seconded by his comrades.\nSentinels were then posted over the Gatling gun camp, with orders to\nkeep the Michiganders out; they abused the sentinels in the same\nmanner, and their officers made no effort to restrain them. It became\nnecessary to make a personal matter of it, which was promptly done,\nand one Wolverine was thereafter respectful–so respectful, in fact,\nthat he jumped to attention and took off his hat to even the privates\nof the detachment.",
        "The regiment took a delicate revenge. They had dug neither latrines\nnor sinks. Up to this time they used the surface of the camp-ground\nover their own camp for this purpose. They now took possession of a\ntrench within twenty yards of the battery’s tents. The nuisance was\nintolerable, and was reported to their brigade headquarters. No\nattention was paid to the report. Twelve hours later it was again\nreported, with the same result. Twelve hours after this it was a third\ntime reported, with the same result. In the meantime not a single\nshovelful of dirt had been thrown on the trench and an odor arose from\nit which was not exactly like the perfume of “Araby the blest.”",
        "Forty-five hours after the arrival of the regiment notice was served\nupon the brigade commander thereof that, unless the nuisance was\nabated immediately, a sentinel would be placed over the offending\nditch and notice would be given to General Bates, the division\ncommander, requesting the action of an inspector; notice was further\nserved that if any resistance were made, four Gatling guns would be\nturned loose upon the 34th Michigan and the regiment swept off the\nface of the hill and into Santiago Bay for a much-needed bath. It was\nenough. Officers and men ran instantly for spades and proceeded to\nfill up the trench. Report was then made to Gen. Bates, the division\ncommander, of the offense and action had thereon, with the information\nthat the Gatling gun commander awaited to answer any complaints. An\ninvestigation was immediately made, with the result that such action\nwas sustained.",
        "There were some ignorant Volunteers at Santiago, but of all the\nwillful violation of all the laws of sanitation, camp hygiene, and\nhealth ever seen, these particular Volunteers did the most outrageous\nthings. They threw their kitchen refuse out on the ground anywhere;\nhalf of the time they did not visit the sink at all, but used the\nsurface of the ground anywhere instead; and they continued these\noffenses at Montauk Point. They raked over an abandoned camp of the\nSpanish prisoners on their arrival at Fort Roosevelt, and appropriated\nall the cast-off articles they could find, using the debris for\nbedding. This surgeon, a “family doctor” from the pine woods in\nnorthern Michigan, did not seem to regard these matters as of any\nimportance. His attention was called to them, but he took no action.\nIn short, there was no law of health which these people did not\nutterly ignore, no excess dangerous to health which they did not\ncommit. Three-fourths of them were too sick for duty, and the rest\nlooked like living skeletons. They fairly wallowed in their own filth\n–and cursed the climate of Cuba on account of their sickness.",
        "In sharp contrast to the 34th Michigan was the 1st U. S. Volunteer\nCavalry, the Rough Riders. This was an organization the peer of any in\nthe Regular Army in morale, in fighting, and in every quality that\ngoes to make up a fine body of soldiers. They were picked men; all\nclasses were shown in that organization. The tennis champion was a\nprivate, the champion oarsman of Harvard a corporal. On the 2d of July\na stock-broker of Wall Street who can sign his check for $3,000,000\nwas seen haggling with a cow-puncher from the Indian Territory over a\npiece of hardtack. Both were privates and both were fine soldiers. The\nwhole regiment was just such a medley, but fought like Regulars, and\nendured like Spartans. They hung on like bull-dogs, and charged like\ndemons. They were as strict about the camp police as Regular Army\nsurgeons, and as punctilious about saluting as a K. O. on “official\nrelations.” Withal, they were a clean-mouthed, clean-clad,\nclean-camped lot of gentlemen, each in his way, from the “Hello,\npard!” of the cowboy to the frozen stare of the monocled dude from\nBroadway. And they fought–like Regulars; there is no other just\ncomparison. Roosevelt said: “They are the 11th Cavalry.” He found\nenthusiastic endorsers of this remark in every Regular who saw them\nfight. They were the finest body of Volunteers who ever wore uniform,\nand they were stamped indelibly with the personality of Theodore\nRoosevelt. Pushing, aggressive, resolute, tenacious, but self-contained,\ncool, and restrained, they represented the very best type of what the\nVolunteer ought to be–but often was not.",
        "Above them all, however, shone out three types.",
        "Theodore Roosevelt. He needs no eulogy from my pen. He has done\neverything, and in each occupation has been conspicuously successful.\nHe is, however, a born soldier. His virile frame contains the vigorous\nmind, the keen intellect, the cool judgment, and the unswerving,\nnever-hesitating courage of the natural soldier. He is affable and\ncourteous, or stern and scathing, as circumstances demand. One instant\ngenial smiles overspread his expressive countenance, whereon the\nfaintest emotion writes its legend with instantaneous and responsive\ntouch; the next, on occasion, a Jove-like sternness settles on his\nface, and, with a facility of expression bewildering to less gifted\ntongues, scathing invective, cutting sarcasm, or bitter irony impress\nupon an offender the gravity of a breach of discipline. Withal, he is\nmodest. He appreciates his own power, but there is no undue display of\nthat appreciation, no vainglorious boasting over achievements which\nread like a fairy-tale. Fittest to lead or follow, idol of every true\nsoldier. Who, that knows him as those who fought beside him, does not\nwish to see him at the head of that army and that nation of which he\nis the brightest ornament in every position, civil, military, or\npolitical?",
        "Woodbury Kane–social leader, Fortune’s favorite, aristocratic,\nrefined, cultured, wealthy, haut ton de haut ton, and sabreur sans\npeur et sans reproche–how shall I paint him to you as I learned to\nknow him in those dreadful, delightful seventeen days in which we\nlived only from instant to instant, and every man unconsciously bared\nhis soul to his comrades because he could not help it?",
        "A gentleman–he always looked that in the fullest sense of the word.\nWell groomed; in those days when our bed was a mud-puddle and our\ncanopy the stars, when the music which lulled us to sleep was the hum\nof the Mauser bullets and the vicious popping of the Remingtons, when\nwater to drink had to be brought at the peril of life for every\nmouthful, Kane turned up every morning clean-shaved and neatly\ngroomed, shoes duly polished, neat khaki, fitting like a glove and\nbrushed to perfection, nails polished, and hair parted as nicely as if\nhe were dressed by his valet in his New York apartments. How did he do\nit? We never knew. He kept no servant; he took his regular turn in the\nditches, in the mud, or torrid sun, or smothering rain. No night alarm\ncame that did not find Kane first to spring to the trench–and yet he\ndid it, somehow. The courteous phrases of politest speech fell ever\nfrom his ready lips, as easily as they would have done in the\nboudoir of any belle in the metropolis. The shrieking of a shell or\ntingling hiss of a sharpshooter’s close-aimed bullet never came so\nnear as to interrupt whatever polished expression of thanks, regret,\nor comment he might be uttering. And it was the real thing, too. The\ngentle heart was there. No man was readier to bind a wound or aid a\nsun-struck soldier in the ranks; none more ready to deny himself a\ncomfort or a luxury to help a more needy comrade. A braver man, a\nsurer or more reliable officer, never trod in shoe-leather. A grand\nexample to our pessimistic, socialistic friends and cheap demagogues\nof the sterling worth and noble, chivalric character of a “society man\nof wealth.” He is a living type of “Bel a faire peur,” without the\nidiotic sentimentality of that maudlin hero, and with all his other\ncharacteristics.",
        "Greenway and Tiffany. The one a Harvard football-player, just out,\nplunging into the great game of war with all the zest he formerly\nfound in the great college game. The other the petted son of wealthy\nparents, also a college graduate, and the idolized fiance of his\nchildhood’s sweetheart. Equally ready for fight or fun, they were the\nfinest type of youthful manhood to be found. Endowed by Nature with\nevery gift, educated at the best of colleges, bred in the best of\nsociety, ready to enter upon the most desirable of careers, they threw\nall upon the altar of country’s love. They entered battle as one might\ngo to a game or begin a play. All of unbounded zeal, youthful\nenthusiasm, restless energy, keen enjoyment–everything seemed to be\nequally acceptable to them, and no discomfort ever assumed any guise\nother than that of a novel and untried sensation.",
        "They are the type of our young manhood–our representative American\nyouth–as Roosevelt is of its vigorous manhood. They are the salt of\nthe earth, and Kane–is both salt and spice. All were comrades in\narms, types of American manhood unspoiled by Fortune’s favors, capable\nof anything and everything. Such men mould the destiny of this great\nnation, and in their hands it is safe.",
        "But neither of these two regiments is a fair type of the Volunteers;\nthey are the two extremes. For a type, take the 1st Illinois. They\nwere a Chicago regiment with fifteen years’ service, and they enlisted\nin a body to a man. They reached the firing line on the 10th and\nparticipated in the fight with two battalions, with distinguished\ngallantry. The third battalion was detailed on the necessary but\nunpleasant duty of caring for the yellow fever hospital at Siboney.\nThese city-bred Volunteers peeled off their coats, buried yellow fever\ncorpses, policed the hospital and hospital grounds, and nursed the\nvictims of the scourge. They did not utter a complaint nor ask for a\n“soft” detail; they did their duty as they found it. Another battalion\nwas detailed immediately after the surrender to guard the Spanish\nprisoners. This most thankless duty was performed by them with\nfidelity and care. The commander of the battalion and half his\nofficers were proficient in the Spanish language as a part of their\npreparation for the campaign, and they soon established cordial\nrelations with the prisoners they were set to guard. It was a trying\nduty, but they performed it faithfully. Sickness visited this\nbattalion, and sometimes guard duty had to be performed with only one\nday off, but they never whimpered. The other battalion was detailed\nafter the surrender to do stevedore work at the commissary depot. The\nslender clerks and soft-handed city men slung boxes of hardtack and\nsacks of bacon and barrels of coffee, and performed manual labor with\nall the faithfulness that would be expected of men accustomed to such\nwork, and with never a complaint. The sanitary measures of this\nregiment were perfect, and they bore themselves like Regulars. It is\nnow recognized that this is a compliment to any Volunteer\norganization.",
