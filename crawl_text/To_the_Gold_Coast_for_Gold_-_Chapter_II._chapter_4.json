        "FROM LISBON TO MADEIRA.",
        "My allotted week in Lisbon came to an end only too soon: in the society\nof friends, and in the Camonian room (Bibliotheca Nacional), which\ncontains nearly 300 volumes, I should greatly have enjoyed a month. The\ns.s. Luso (Captain Silva), of the ’Empresa Insulana,’ one of the\nvery few Portuguese steamers, announced her departure for December 20;\nand I found myself on board early in the morning, with a small but\nhighly select escort to give me God-speed.",
        "Unfortunately the ’May weather’ had made way for the cacimbas\n(mists) of a rainy sou’-wester. The bar broke and roared at us; Cintra,\nthe apex of Lisbon’s extinct volcano and the Mountain of the (Sun and)\nMoon, hid her beautiful head, and even the Rock of Lisbon disdained the\nnormal display of sturdy flank. Then set in a brise carabinée,\nwhich lasted during our voyage of 525 miles, and the Luso,\nrolling like a moribund whale, proved so lively that most of the\nfourteen passengers took refuge in their berths. A few who resisted the\nsea-fiend’s assaults found no cause of complaint: the captain and\nofficers were exceedingly civil and obliging, and food and wines were\ngood and not costly.",
        "From Madeira the Luso makes, once a month, the tour of the\nAzores, touching at each island–a great convenience–and returning in\nten days.",
        "Early on Thursday, the 22nd, the lumpy, churning sea began to subside,\nand the invisible balm seduced all the sufferers to the\nquarter-deck. They were wild to sight Madeira as children to see the\nrising of the pantomime-curtain. There was not much to gaze at; but what\nwill not attract man’s stare at sea?–a gull, a turtle, a flying fish!\nBy the by, Captain Tuckey, of the Congo Expedition, remarked the\n’extraordinary absence of sea-birds in the vicinity of Madeira and the\nCanaries:’ they have since learned the way thither. Porto Santo appeared\nas a purple lump of three knobs, a manner of ’gizzard island,’ backed by\na deeper gloom of clouds–Madeira. Then it lit up with a pale glimmer as\nof snow, the effect of the sun glancing upon the thin greens of the\nnorthern flank; and, lastly, it broke into two masses–northern and\nsouthern–of peaks and precipices connected by a strip of lowland.",
        "It is generally held that the discovery of the Madeiran group (1418-19)\nwas the first marking feature of the century which circumnavigated\nAfrica, and that Porto Santo was ’invented ’by the Portuguese before\nMadeira. The popular account, however, goes lame. For instance, the\nstory that tried and sturdy soldiers and seamen were deterred from\nadvancing a few miles, and were driven back to Portugal by the ’thick\nimpenetrable darkness which was guarded by a strange noise,’ and by\nanile fancies about the ’Mouth of Hell’ and ’Cipango,’ reads like mere\nstuff and nonsense. Again, great are the difficulties in determining the\nnationality of the explorers, and settling the conflicting claims of the\nFrench, Genoese, Portuguese, Spanish, English, and Arabs. History, and\nperhaps an aptitude for claiming, have assigned the honour exclusively\nto Lusitania: and every guide-book tells the same old tale. But I have\nlived long enough to have seen how history is written; and the discovery\nwas, at best, a mere re-discovery, as we learn from Pliny (vi. 36),\nwhose ’insulae purpurariae’ cannot be confounded [Footnote: Mr. Major,\nhowever, would identify the Purple Islands with Oanarian Fuerteventura\nand Lanzarote, both possibly Continental.] with the Fortunate Islands,\nor Canaries. The ’Gaetulian dye’ of King Juba in the Augustan age is\nnot known. Its origin has been found in the orchilla still growing upon\nthe Desertas; but this again appears unlikely enough. Ptolemy (iv. 1,16)\nalso mentions ’Erythía,’ the Red Isle–’red,’ possibly, for the same\nreason; and Plutarch (in Suet.) may allude to the Madeiran group when he\nrelates of the Fortunate Islands: ’They are two, separated only by a\nnarrow channel, and at a distance of 400 leagues (read 320 miles) from\nthe African coast.’",
        "The Jesuit, Antonio Cordeyro, [Footnote: Historia insulana das Ilhas\na Portugal sugoytas, pp. 61-96. Lisbon, 1717.] who borrows from the\nlearned and trustworthy Dr. Gaspar Fructuoso, [Footnote: As Saudades\nda Terra, lib. i. ch. iii, Historia das Ilhas, &c. This\nlettered and conscientious chronicler, the first who wrote upon the\nPortuguese islands, was born (A.D. 1522) at Ponta Delgada (Thin Point)\nof St. Michael, Azores. He led a life of holiness and good works,\ncomposed his history in 1590, left many ’sons of his soul,’ as he called\nhis books, and died in his natal place, A.D. 1591. The Madeiran portion\nof the two huge folios (some 4,000 pages of MS.) has been printed at\nFunchal, with copious notes by Dr. A. Rodrigues de Azevedo, Professor of\nLiterature, &c., at the National Lyceum; and a copy was kindly lent to\nme, during the author’s absence in Lisbon, by Governor Viscount de Villa\nMendo.] declares in 1590: ’The first discoverers of the Porto Santo\nIsland, many say, were those Frenchmen and Castilians (Spaniards) who\nwent forth from Castile to conquer the Canaries; these, when either\noutward or homeward bound, came upon the said island, and, for that they\nfound it uninhabited and small, they abandoned it; but as they had\nweathered a storm and saved themselves there, they named it Port Holy.’\nFructuoso (i. 5) expressly asserts that the Portuguese sailed from\nLisbon in June 1419 for ’the Isle of Porto Sancto’(in 32° N. lat.),\nwhich two years before had been discovered by some Castilian ships\nmaking the Canaries, the latter having been occupied a short time\npreviously by the French; wherefore the pilot took that route.’ The\nJesuit chronicler continues to relate that after the formally proclaimed\nannexation of the Canaries by the Normans and Castilians (A.D. 1402-18),\nPrince Henry, the Navigator, despatched from Lagos, in 1417, an\nexpedition to explore Cape Bojador, the ’gorbellied.’ The three ships\nwere worked by the Italian master-seaman Bertholomeu Palestrello or\nPalestro, commonly called Perestrello. The soldiers, corresponding to\nour marines, were commanded by the ’sweet warman,’ João Gonçales da\nCamara, nicknamed ’O Zargo,’ the Cyclops, not the squint-eyed;\n[Footnote: Curious to say, Messieurs White and Johnson, the writers of\nthe excellent guide-book, will translate the word ’squint-eyed:’ they\nmight have seen the portrait in Government House.] his companion was\nTristão Vaz Teyxeyra, called in honour ’the Tristam.’ Azurara,\n[Footnote: Chronica do Descobrimento de Guiné. By Gomes Eannes de\nAzurara, written between A.D. 1452-53, and quoted by Prof. Azevedo,\nNotes, p. 830.] a contemporary, sends the ’two noble squires,’ Zarco and\nTristam, ’who in bad weather were guided by God to the isle now called\nPorto Sancto’ (June 1419). They returned home (marvellous to relate)\nwithout touching at Madeira, only twenty-three miles distant; and next\nyear (1420) Prince Henry commissioned Palestrello also.",
        "The Spaniards prefer to believe that after Jehan de Béthencourt’s attack\nupon the Canaries (A.D. 1403), his soldier Lancelot, who named Lanzarote\nIsland, touched at Porto Santo in 1417; and presently, sailing to the\nsouth-west, discovered Madeira. This appears reasonable enough.",
        "Patriotic Barbot (1700), in company with the mariner Villault de\nBelfons, Père Labat, and Ernest de Fréville, [Footnote: Mémoire sur\nle Commerce Maritime de Rouen.] claims the honour for France.\nAccording to that ’chief factor for the African Company,’ the\nmerchants of Dieppe first traded to West Africa for cardamoms and\nivory. This was during the reign of Charles V., and between 1364 and\n1430, or half a century before the Portuguese. Their chief stations were\nGoree of Cape Verde, Sierra Leone, Cape Mount, the Kru or Liberian\ncoast, then called ’of Grain,’ from the ’Guinea grains’ or Malaguetta\npepper (Amomum granum Paradisi), and, lastly, the Gold\nCoast. Here they founded ’Petit Paris’ upon the Baie de France, at\n’Serrelionne;’ ’Petit Dieppe,’ at the mouth of the St. John’s River,\nnear Grand Bassá, south of Monrovia; and ’Cestro’ [Footnote: Now\ngenerally called Grand Sestros, and popularly derived from the\nPortuguese cestos–pepper.] or ’Sestro Paris,’ where, three\ncenturies afterwards, the natives retained a few words of French. Hence\nAdmiral Bouet-Willaumez explains the Great and Little ’Boutoo’ of our\ncharts by butteau, from butte, the old Norman word still\npreserved in the great western prairies.",
        "Barbot resumes that in 1383 the Rouen traders, combining with the Dieppe\nmen, sent upon an exploring voyage three ships, one of which, La\nVierge, ran down coast as far as where Commenda (Komenda or Komání)\nand Elmina now stand. At the latter place they built a fort and factory\njust one century before it was occupied by the Portuguese. The Frenchman\ndeclares that one of the Elmina castles was called Bastion de France,\nand ’on it are still to be seen some old arithmetical numbers, which are\nanno 13’ (i.e. 1383); ’the rest being defaced by weather.’ This\nfirst factory was afterwards incorporated with the modern building; and\nin 1387 it was enlarged with the addition of a chapel to lodge more than\nten or twelve men, the original garrison.",
        "In 1670 Ogilvy [Footnote: London: Printed by Tho. Johnson for the\nauthor, and to be had at his house in White Fryers, MDCLXX.] notes: ’The\ncastle (Elmina) was judged to be an Antient Building from several marks\nof Antiquity about it; as first by a decay’d Battery, which the\nDutch repaired some years ago, retaining the name of the\nFrench Battery, because it seems to have been built by the\nFrench; who, as the Inhabitants say, before the coming of the\nPortugals harbour’d there. The Dutch when they won it,\nfound the numerical Figures of the year thirteen hundred; but were not\nable to make anything of the two following Characters. In a small place\nwithin also, may be seen a Writing carved in Stone between two old\nPillars, but so impair’d and worn out by the weather that it is not\nlegible.’ At Groree, too, similar remains were reported.",
        "The adventurers, it is said, carried on a good trade till 1430-90, when\nthe civil wars distracting France left her without stomach for distant\nadventure; and in 1452 Portugal walked over the course. M. d’Avezac, who\nfound Porto Santo in a French map of the fourteenth century, [Footnote:\nBulletin de la Société de Géographie, cinquième série, tome\nv. p. 260. Also ’Iles de l’Afrique,’ in the Univers. Paris,\n1868.] seems inclined to take the part of ’quelques précurseurs\nméconnus contre les prétentions trop exclusives des découvreurs\nofficiels.’",
        "Barbot’s details are circumstantial, but they have not been confirmed by\ncontemporary evidence or by local tradition. The Portuguese indignantly\ndeny the whole, and M. Valdez in his ’Complete Maritime Handbook’\n[Footnote: Six Years of a Traveller’s Life in Western Africa.\nLondon, Hurst & Blackett, 1861.] alludes contemptuously to ’Norman\npirates.’ They point out that Diego d’Azembuja, the chief captain, sent\nin 1481 to found São Jorje da Mina, our ’Elmina Castle,’ saw no traces\nof previous occupation. But had he done so, would he have dared to\npublish the fact? Professor Azevedo relies upon the silence of Azurara,\nBarros, and Camoens concerning the French, the Spaniards, and the\nEnglish in the person of Robert à Machim. But this is also at best a\nnegative argument: the ’Livy of Portugal’ never mentions the great\nmathematician, Martin Behaim, who accompanied Diego Cam to his discovery\nof the Congo. In those days fair play was not a jewel.",
        "The truth is that it would be as easy to name the discoverer of\ngunpowder or steam-power as to find the first circumnavigator of the\nAfrican continent. I have no difficulty in believing that the\nPhoenicians and Carthaginians were capable of making the voyage. They\nwere followed to West Africa in early days, according to El-Idrisi and\nIbn. el-Wardi, by the Arabs. The former (late eleventh century) relates\nthat an Arab expedition sailed from Lisbon, shortly after the eighth\ncentury, and named Madeira and Porto Santo the ’Islands El-Ghanam and\nRákah.’ However that may be, the first Portuguese occupants found\nneither men nor ruins nor large quadrupeds upon any of the group.",
        "The English accident of hitting upon Madeira, and the romantic tale of\nMaster Robert à Machim, or Machin, or Macham, and Mistress Anne d’Arfet,\nor Darby, or Dorset, which would have suited Camoens, and which I have\ntold elsewhere, [Footnote: Wanderings in West Africa, vol. i,\np. 17. Chapter II., ’A Day at Madeira,’ was written after my second and\nbefore my third visit.] and need not repeat, was probably an ’ingenious\naccount’ invented for politico-international ends or to flatter Dom\nEnrique, a Britisher by the distaff-side. It is told with a thousand\nvariants, and ignored by the learned Fructuoso. According to the\napocryphal manuscript of Francisco Alcoforado, the squire who\naccompanied the Zargo, this elopement took place in the earlier days of\nEdward III. (A.D. 1327-77). The historian Antonio Galvão fixes upon\nSeptember 1344, the date generally accepted. Thus the interval between\nMachim’s death and the Zargo’s discovery would be seventy-four years;\nand–pace Mr. Major–the Castilian pilot, Juan Damores (de\nAmores), popularly called Morales, could not have met the remnant\nof the Bristol crew in their Moroccan prison, and could not have\ntold the tale to the Portuguese explorers.",
        "M. d’Avezac (loc. cit. p. 116) supports the claims of the\nGenoese, quoting the charts and portulans of the fourteenth century in\nwhich appear Italian names, as Insule dello Legname (of wood,\nmateria, Madeira), Porto Sancto, Insule Deserte, and Insule\nSelvaggie. Mr. R. H. Major replies that these Italian navigators\nwere commandants of expeditions fitted out by the Portuguese; and that\nthis practice dated from 1341, when two ships officered by Genoese, with\ncrews of [footnote: Amongst the ’ridiculous little blots, which are\n“nuts” to the old resident,’ I must confess to killing Robert Machim in\n1334 instead of 1344; ’Collegio’ was also translated ’College’ instead\nof ’Jesuit Church.’] Italians, Castilians, and Hispani (Spanish\nand Portuguese), were seat to explore the Canaries.",
        "’Holy Port’ began badly. The first governor, Perestrello, fled from the\nprogeny of his own she-rabbit. This imprudence was also committed at\nDeserta Grande; and, presently, the cats introduced by way of cure ran\nwild. A grass-clad rock in the Fiume Gulf can tell the same tale: sheep\nand lambs were effectually eaten out by rabbits and cats. It will be\nremembered that Columbus married Philippa, third daughter of the\nnavigator Perestrello, lived as a mapper with his father-in-law, and\nthence travelled, between 1470 and 1484, to Guinea, where he found that\nthe equatorial regions are not uninhabitable by reason of the heat. He\ninherited the old seaman’s papers, and thus arose the legend of his\nlearning from a castaway pilot the way to the New World. [Footnote:\nFructuoso writes that in 1486 Columbus gave food and shelter to the crew\nof a shattered Biscayan ship; the pilot dying bequeathed to him papers,\ncharts and valuable observations made on the Western Ocean.]",
        "Long years rolled by before Porto Santo learnt to bear the vine, to\nbreed large herds of small cattle, and to produce cereals whose yield is\nsaid to have been 60 to 1. Meanwhile it cut down for bowls, mortars, and\ncanoes, as the Guanches did for shields, its thin forest of ’Dragons.’\nThe Dragoeiro (Dracaena Draco Linn., Palma canariensis\nTourn.), which an Irish traveller called a ’dragon-palm,’ owed its\nvulgar name to the fancy that the fruit contained the perfect figure of\na standing dragon with gaping mouth and long neck, spiny back and\ncrocodile’s tail. It is a quaint tree of which any ingenious carpenter\ncould make a model. The young trunk is somewhat like that of the\nOreodoxa regia, or an asparagus immensely magnified; but it\nfrequently grows larger above than below. At first it bears only\nbristly, ensiform leaves, four feet long by one to three inches broad,\nand sharp-pointed, crowning the head like a giant broom. Then it puts\nforth gouty fingers, generally five, standing stiffly up and still\ncapped by the thick yucca-like tufts. Lastly the digitations grow to\nenormous arms, sometimes eighteen feet in girth, of light and porous,\nsoft and spongy wood. The tree then resembles the baobab or calabash,\nthe elephant or hippopotamus of the vegetable kingdom.",
        "Amongst the minor uses of this ’Dragon,’ the sweet yellowish berries\ncalled masainhas were famous for fattening pigs. The splinters\nmade tooth-picks which, dipped in the juice, secured health for human\ngums. But the great virtue resided in the Sanguis Draconis, the\n’Indian Cinnabaris’ of Pliny, [Footnote: N.H. xxxiii. 38.] who\nholds it to be the sanies of the dragon mixed with the blood of the\ndying elephant. The same semi-mystical name is given to the sap by the\nArab pharmists: in the Middle Ages this strong astringent resin was a\nsovereign cure for all complaints; now it is used chiefly for\nvarnishes. The gum forms great gouts like blood where the bark is\nwounded or fissured: at first it is soft as that of the cherry, but it\nhardens by exposure to a dry red lump somewhat like ’mummy.’ It has no\nspecial taste: when burnt the smell is faintly balsamic. The produce was\ncollected in canes, and hence the commercial name ’Dragon’s blood in\nreeds.’",
        "Mr. P. Barker Webb believed the Dragoeiro to be a species peculiar to\nthe Madeiras and Canaries. But its chief point of interest is its\nextending through Morocco as far as Arabo-African Socotra, and through\nthe Khamiesberg Range of Southern Africa, where it is called the\nKokerboom. As it is utterly African, like the hippopotamus, the zebra,\nand the giraffe, we must account, by transplantation from Socotra, for\nthe D. Draco seen by Cruttenden in the mountains behind Dhofar and on\nthe hills of El-Yemen. [Footnote: Journ. R. Geogr. Soc. p. 279,\nvol. viii. of 1838.] The line of growth, like the coffee-shrub and the\ncopal-tree, suggests a connection across the Dark Continent: thus the\nsimilar flora of Fernando Po Peak, of Camarones volcano, and of the\nhighlands of Abyssinia seems to prove a latitudinal range traversing the\nequatorial regions, where the glacial epoch banished for ever the\nhardier plants from the lower levels. When Humboldt determined it to be\na purely Indian growth, he seems to have confounded the true ’dragon’\nwith a palm or some other tree supplying the blood. It was a ’dazzling\ntheory,’ but unsound: the few specimens in Indus-land, ’its real\ncountry,’ are comparatively young, and are known to have been imported.",
        "The endogenous monster, indigenous to the Elysian Fields, is to the\nsurrounding vegetation what the cockatrice is to the cock, the wyvern to\nthe python. I should say ’was,’ for all the replants at Madeira and the\nCanaries are modern, and resemble only big toothsticks. But ’dragons’\nproper have existed, and perhaps memories of these portents long\nlingered in the brain of protohistoric man. Even if they had been\naltogether fabulous, the fanciful Hellenic mind would easily have\ncreated them. The Dragoeiro with its boa-like bole, its silvery,\nlight-glancing skin, and its scars stained with red blood, growing in a\nwild garden of glowing red-yellow oranges, would easily become the fiery\nsaurian guarding the golden apples of the Hesperides.",
        "Porto Santo and Madeira, though near neighbours, are contrasts in most\nrespects. The former has yellow sands and brackish water, full of\nmagnesia and lime, which blacken the front teeth; the latter sweet water\nand black shingles. The islet is exceedingly dry, the island damp as\nDevonshire. Holy Port prefers wheeled conveyances: Wood-and-Fennel-land\ncorsas or sledges, everywhere save on the New Road. Finally, the\nwines of the northern mite are comparatively light and acidulous; of the\nsouthern, luscious and heady.",
        "Both scraps of ground are of kindred although disputed\norigin. Classicists [Footnote: Plato, Timaeus, ii. 517. His\n’fruit with a hard rind, affording meat, drink, and ointment,’ is\nevidently the cocoanut. The cause of the lost empire and the identity of\nits site with the Dolphin’s Ridge and the shallows noted by\nH.M.S. Challenger, have been ably pleaded in Atlantis, &c.,\nby Ignatius Donnelly (London, Sampson Low, 1882).] find in these sons of\nVulcan, the débris of Platonic Atlantis, a drowned continent, a\n’Kingdom of Nowhere,’ which some cataclysm whelmed beneath the waters,\nleaving, for all evidence, three shattered groups of outcrops, like the\nChannel Islands, fragments of a lost empire, the ’bones of a wasted\nbody.’ Geologists, noting that volcanoes almost always fringe mainlands,\nbelieve them destined, together with the Cape Verdes, to rampart in\nfuture ages the Dark Continent with a Ghaut-chain higher than the\nAndes. Other theorists hold to a recent connection of the Madeiras with\nMount Atlas, although the former rise from a narrow oceanic trough some\n13,000 to 15,000 feet deep. Others again join them to Southern Europe\nand to Northern America. The old Portuguese and certain modern realists\nmake them a continuation of the Serra de Monchique in the Algarves, even\nas the Azores prolong Cintra; and this opinion is somewhat justified by\nthe flora, which resembles in many points the tertiary and extinct\ngrowths of Europe. [Footnote: Such is the opinion of M. Pégot-Ogier in\nThe Fortunate Islands, translated by Frances Locock (London,\nBentleys, 1871). Moquet set the example in 1601 by including Madeira\nalso in the ’Elysian Fields and Earthly Paradise’ of the ancients.]",
        "Porto Santo was till lately distinguished only for pride, poverty, and\npurity of blood. Her soil, according to the old chroniclers, has never\nbeen polluted, like São Thomé and other colonies, by convicts, Jews, or\nother ’infected peoples.’ She was populated by Portuguese ’noble and\ntaintless’–Palestrellos, Calaças, Pinas, Vieyras, Rabaçaes, Crastos,\nNunes, Pestanas, and Concellos. And yet not a little scandal was caused\nby Holiport when the ’Prophet Fernando’ and the ’Prophetess Philippa’\n(Nunes), ’instigated by the demon and the deceitfulness of mankind,’\ninduced the ecclesiastics to introduce into the introit, with the names\nof St. Peter and St. Paul, the ’Blessed Prophet Fernando.’ The tale of\nmurder is told with holy horror by Dr. Gaspar Fructuoso, and the\nislanders are still nicknamed ’prophetas.’  Foreigners, however, who\nhave lately visited them, speak highly of their simple primitive ways.",
        "I boated to the Holy Port in 1862, when Messieurs Blandy’s steamship\nFalcon was not in existence. And now as the Luso steamed\nalong shore, no external change appeared. A bird’s-eye view of the islet\nsuggests a podão or Madeiran billhook, about six miles by\nthree. The tool’s broken point is the Ilha da Cima, facing to\nnorth-east, a contorted pile which resembles a magnified cinder. The\nhandle is the Ilheu Baixo, to the south; and the blade is the tract of\nyellow sandy lowlands–the sole specimen of its sort in the\nMadeiras–connecting the extremities. Three tall cones at once disclose\nvulcanism; the Pico de Facho, or Beacon Peak (1,660 feet), the Pico de\nAnna Ferreira (910 feet), and the sugarloaf Pico de Castello (1,447\nfeet). The latter rises immediately north of the single town, and its\nhead still shows in white points the ruins of the fort which more than\nonce saved the population from the ’Moors.’ The lower levels are\nterraced, as usual in this archipelago, and the valleys are green with\nvines and cereals. The little white Villa Baleira is grouped\naround its whiter church, and dotted with dark vegetation, trees, and\nhouses, straggling off into open country. Here lodge the greater part of\nthe islanders, now nearly 1,750 souls. The population is far too\nthick. But the law of Portugal has, till lately, forbidden emigration to\nthe islanders unless a substitute for military service be provided; the\nforce consists of only 250 men, and the term of service is three years;\nyet a remplaçant costs upwards of 50l. Every emigrant was,\ntherefore, an energetic stowaway, who landed at Honolulu or Demerara\nwithout shoes and stockings, and returned in a few years with pounds\nsterling enough to purchase an estate and a pardon. Half-a-dozen boats,\nsome of them neat little feluccas with three masts, are drawn up on the\nbeach: there is not much fishing; the vine-disease has raged, and the\nstaple export consists of maize in some quantities; of cantaria,\na grey trachyte which works more freely than the brown or black basalt,\nand of an impure limestone from Ilheu Baixo, the only calcaire\nused in Funchal. This rock is apparently an elevated coral-reef: it also\nproduces moulds of sea-shells, delicately traced and embedded in blocks\nof apparently unbroken limestone. Of late a fine vein of manganese has\nbeen found in the northern or mountainous part of the island: specimens\nshown to me by Mr. J. Blandy appeared remarkably rich.",
        "Under the lee of Porto Santo we enjoyed a dry deck and a foretaste of\nthe soft and sensuous Madeiran ’Embate,’ the wester opposed to the\nLeste, Harmattan, Khammasin, or Scirocco, the dry wind which brings\nwet. [Footnote: The popular proverb is, ’A Leste never dies thirsty.’]\nThen we rolled over the twenty-five geographical miles separating us\nfrom our destination. Familiar sites greeted my eyes: here the ’Isle of\nWood’ projects a dwarf tail composed of stony vertebræ: seen upon the\nmap it looks like the thin handle of a broad chopper. The outermost or\nextreme east is the Ilha de Fora, where the A.S.S. Forerunner and\nthe L. and H. Newton came to grief: a small light, one of the\nmany on this shore, now warns the careless skipper; but apparently\nnothing is easier than to lose ships upon the safest coasts. Inside it\nis the Ponta de São Lourenço, where the Zargo, when startled, called\nupon his patron Saint of the Gridiron; others say it was named after his\ngood ship. It has now a lighthouse and a telegraph-station. [Footnote:\nThe line runs all along the southern shore as far as the Ponta do Pargo\n(of the ’braise-fish,’ Pargus vulgaris), the extreme west. At\nFunchal the cable lands north of Fort São Thiago Minor, where ships are\nrequested not to anchor. It is used chiefly for signalling arrivals from\nnorth and south; and there is talk of extending it to the Porto da Cruz,\na bay on the north-eastern side. It would be of great advantage to\nMadeira if steamers could here land their mails when prevented from\ntouching at Funchal by the south winds, which often last a\nweek. Accordingly a breakwater has been proposed, and Messieurs Blandy\nare taking interest in the improvement.] The innermost of this sharp\nline of serrated basaltic outliers is the Pedra do Furado, which\nEnglishmen call the Arch-Rock.",
        "The substantial works of the Gonçalo-Machico highway, the\ntelegraph-posts, and the yellow-green lines of sugar-cane, were the only\nchanges I could detect in Eastern Madeira. Nothing more charming than\nthe variety and contrast of colours after the rusty-brown raiment which\nSouthern Europe dons in mid-December. Even the barren, arid, and\nwindswept eastern slopes glowed bright with the volcanic muds locally\ncalled laterites, and the foliated beds of saibros and maçapés,\ndecomposed tufas oxidised red and yellow. As we drew nearer to Funchal,\nwhich looks like a giant plate-bande, tilted up at an angle of\n40°, we were startled by the verdure of every shade and tint; the\nyellow-green of the sugar and common cane (Arundo sagittata), of\nthe light-leaved aloe, banana, and hibiscus; the dark orange, myrtle,\nand holm-oak; the gloomy cypress, and the dull laurels and bay-trees,\nwhile waving palms, growing close to stiff pines and junipers (Oedro\nda Serra), showed the contrast and communion of north and south.",
        "Lines of plane-trees, with foliage now blighted yellow and bright green\nin February, define the embouchures of the three grim black ravines\nradiating from the upper heights, and broadening out as they approach\nthe bay. The rounded grassy hill-heads setting off the horizontal\ncurtains of dry stone, ’horticultural fortifications’ which guard the\nslopes, and which rise to a height of 3,000 feet; the lower monticules\nand parasitic craters, Signal Hill, Race-course Hill, São Martinho and\nSanto Antonio, telling the tale of throes perhaps to be renewed; the\nstern basaltic cliff-walls supporting the island and prolonged in black\njags through the glassy azure of the transparent sea; the gigantic\nheadlands forming abutments for the upper arch; the chequered lights and\nshades and the wavy play of sunshine and cloudlet flitting over the face\nof earth; the gay tenements habited in white and yellow, red, green,\nand, not unfrequently, blue; the houses built after the model of\ncigar-boxes set on edge, with towers, belvederes, and gazebos so tall\nthat no one ascends them, and with flat roofs bearing rooms of glass,\nsparkling like mirrors where they catch the eye of day; the toy-forts,\nsuch as the Fortaleza do Pico de São João, built by the Spaniards, an\nupper work which a single ironclad would blow to powder with a\nbroadside; the mariner’s landmark, 2,000 feet high, Nossa Senhora do\nMonte, white-framed in brown-black and backed by its feathery pines,\ndistance-dwarfed to mere shrubs, where the snow-winds sport; the\ncloud-cap, a wool-pack, iris-tinted by the many-hued western sky, and\nthe soft sweet breath of the serre-chaude below, profusely\nscented with flower and fruit, all combined to form an ensemble\nwhose first sight Northern travellers long remember. Here everyone\nquotes, and so will I:–",
        "   Hic ver assiduum atque alienis mensibus æstas.",
        "Though it be midwinter, the land is gorgeous with blossoms; with glowing\nrose, fuchsia, and geranium; with snowy datura, jasmine, belladonna,\nstephanotis, lily, and camelia; with golden bignonia and grevillea; with\npurple passion-creeper; with scarlet coral and poinciana; with blue\njacaranda (rosewood), solanum and lavender; and with\nsight-dazzling bougainvillea of five varieties, in mauve, pink, and\norange sheets. Nor have the upper heights been wholly bared. The\nmountain-flanks are still bushy and tufty with broom, gorse, and furze;\nwith myrtle, bilberry and whortleberry; with laurels; with heaths 20\nfeet high, and with the imported pine.",
        "We spin round fantastic Garajáo, [Footnote: Not the meaningless Garajão,\nas travellers will write it.] the wart-nosed cliff of ’terns’ or\n’sea-swallows’ (Sterna hirundo), by the northern barbarian\ntermed, from its ruddy tints, Brazen Head. Here opens the well-known\nview perpetuated by every photographer–first the blue bay, then the\nsheet of white houses gradually rising in the distance. We anchor in the\nopen roadstead fronting the Fennel-field (’Funchal’), concerning which\nthe Spaniard spitefully says–",
        "   Donde crece la escola\n   Nace el asno que la roya.",
        "[Footnote:",
        "  Wheresoe’er the fennel grows\n  Lives the ass that loves to browse.]",
        "And there, straight before us, lies the city, softly couched against the\nhill-side that faces the southern sea, and enjoying her ’kayf’ in the\nsinking sun. Her lower zone, though in the Temperates, is sub-tropical:\nTuscany is found in the mid-heights, while it is Scotland in the bleak\nwolds about Pico Ruivo (6,100 feet) and the Paül (Moorland) da Serra. I\nnow see some change since 1865. East of the yellow-washed, brown-bound\nfort of São Thiago Minor, the island patron, rises a huge white pile, or\nrather piles, the Lazaretto, with its three-arched bridge spanning the\nWady Gonçalo Ayres. The fears of the people forbid its being used,\nalthough separated from them by a mile of open space. This over-caution\nat Madeira, as at Tenerife, often causes great inconvenience to foreign\nresidents; moreover, it is directly opposed to treaty. There is a neat\ngroup, meat-market, abattoir, and fish-market–where there is ne’er a\nflat fish save those who buy–near those dreariest of academic groves,\nthe Praça Academica, at the east end proper, or what an Anglo-Indian\nwould term the ’native town.’ Here we see the joint mouth of the\ntorrent-beds Santa Luzia and João Gomes which has more than once deluged\nFunchal. Timid Funchalites are expecting another flood: the first was in\n1803, the second in 1842, and thus they suspect a cycle of forty\nyears. [Footnote: The guide-books make every twenty-fifth year a season\nof unusual rain, the last being 1879-80.] The lately repaired Sé\n(cathedral) in the heart of the mass is conspicuous for its steeple of\nazulejos, or varnished tiles, and for the ruddy painting of the\nblack basaltic façade, contrasting less violently with the huge\nsplotches of whitewash, the magpie-suit in which the church-architecture\nof the Madeiras and the Canaries delights. The São Francisco convent,\nwith its skull-lined walls, and the foundations of its proposed\nsuccessor, the law courts, have disappeared from the space adjoining the\nmain square; this chief promenade, the Praça da Constituição, is grown\nwith large magnolias, vinhaticos, or native mahogany (Persea\nIndica), and til-trees (Oreodaphne foetens), and has been\nsupplemented by the dwarf flower-garden (Jardim Novo) lately opened to\nthe west. The latter, I regret to say, caused the death of many noble\nold trees, including a fine palm; but Portuguese, let me repeat, have\nscant sympathy with such growth. The waste ground now belonging to the\ncity will be laid out as a large public garden with fountains and\nband-stands. Finally, that soundly abused ’Tower of Babel,’ alias\n’Benger’s Folly,’ built in 1796, has in the evening of its days been\nutilised by conversion into a signal-tower. So far so good.",
        "But the stump of caes, or jetty, which was dashed to pieces more\nthan a score of years ago, remains as it was; The landing-place calls\nloudly for a T-headed pier of concrete blocks, or a gangway supported\nupon wooden piles and metal pilasters: one does not remark the want in\nfine weather; one does bitterly on bad days. There has been no attempt\nto make a port or even a débarcadère by connecting the basaltic\nlump Loo (Ilheu) Fort with the Pontinha, the curved scorpion’s tail of\nrock and masonry, Messieurs Blandy’s coal stores, to the west. Big ships\nmust still roll at anchor in a dangerous open roadstead far off shore;\nand, during wet weather, ladies, well drenched by the surf, must be\nlanded with the aid of a crane in what should be the inner harbour. The\nbroken-down circus near Reid’s is to become a theatre, but whence the\nmoney is to come no one knows. The leper hospital cannot afford to make\nup more than nine or ten beds. The jail is in its old disgraceful state,\nand sadly wants reform: here the minimum of punishment would suffice; I\nnever saw the true criminal face, and many of the knick-knacks bought in\nMadeira are the work of these starving wretches. The Funchal Club gives\nperiodically a subscription ball, ’to ameliorate, if possible, the\ncondition of the prisoners at the Funchal jail’–asking strangers, in\nfact, to do the work of Government. The Praça da Rainha, a dwarf walk\nfacing the huge yellow Government House, alias Palacio de São Lourenço,\nhas been grown with mulberries intended for sericulture. Unfortunately,\nwhatever may here be done by one party (the ’ins’) is sure to be undone\nwhen the ’outs’ become ’ins.’ There has been no change in the ’Palace,’\nexcept that the quaint portraits of one-eyed Zargo, who has left many\ndescendants in the island, and of the earlier Captains-General,\ndignitaries who were at once civil and military, have been sent to the\nLisbon Exhibition. The queer old views of Machim’s landing and of\nFunchal Bay still amuse visitors. Daily observations for meteorology are\nhere taken at 9 A.M. and 3 and 9 P.M.; the observatory standing eighty\nfeet above sea-level.",
        "As our anchor rattles downwards, two excise boats with the national flag\ntake up their stations to starboard and port; and the boatmen are\ncarefully watched with telescopes from the shore. The wiser Spaniards\nhave made Santa Cruz, Tenerife, a free port. The health-officer\npresently gives us pratique, and we welcome the good ’monopolist,’\nMr. William Reid, and his son. The former, an Ayrshire\nman, has made himself proprietor of the four chief hostelries. Yates’s\nor Hollway’s in the Entrada da Cidade, or short avenue running\nnorth from the landing-place, has become a quasi-ruinous\ntelegraph-station. Reid’s has blossomed into the ’Royal Edinburgh;’ it\nis rather a tavern than an hotel, admitting the ’casuals’ from passing\nsteamers and men who are not welcome elsewhere. One of these, who called\nhimself a writer for the press, and who waxed insultingly drunk, made\nour hours bitter; but the owner has a satisfactory and sovereign way of\ndealing with such brutes. Miles’s has become the Carmo, and Schlaff’s\nthe ’German.’ The fourth, Santa Clara, retains her maiden name; the\nestablishment is somewhat collet monté, but I know none in Europe\nmore comfortable. There are many others of the second rank; and the\nHôtel Central, with its café-billiard and estaminet at the\ncity-entrance, is a good institution which might be made better.",
        "We throw a few coppers to the diving-boys, who are expert as the Somali\nsavages of Aden, and we quit our water prison in the three-keeled boats,",
        "  Magno telluris amore\n  Egressi",
        "’Tellus,’ however, is represented at Funchal by chips and pebbles of\nblack basalt like petrified kidneys, stuck on edge, often upon a base of\nbare rock. They are preferred to the slabs of Trieste and Northern\nItaly, which here, with the sole exception of the short Rua de\nBettencourt, are confined to flights of steps. The surfaces are greased\nby rags and are polished by the passage of ’cars’ or coach-sleighs,\nwhich irreverents call ’cow-carts;’ these vehicles, evidently suggested\nby the corsa, or common sleigh, consist of a black-curtained\ncarriage-body mounted on runners. The queer cobble-pavement, that\nresembles the mosaics of clams and palm-nuts further south, has sundry\nadvantages. It is said to relieve the horses’ back sinews; it is never\ndusty; the heaviest rain flows off it at once; nor is it bad walking\nwhen the kidney-stones are small. The black surface is sometimes\ndiapered with white pebbles, lime from Porto Santo. Very strange is the\nglare of moonlight filtered through the foliage; the beams seem to fall\nupon patches of iced water.",
        "We had not even the formality of a visit to the Custom-house: our\nunopened boxes were expected to pay only a small fee, besides the hire\nof boat, porters, and sledges. A cedula interina, costing 200\nreis (11d.), was the sole expense for a permit to reside. What a\ncontrast with London and Liverpool, where I have seen a uniform-case and\na cocked hat-box subjected to the ’perfect politeness’ of certain\nunpleasant officials: where collections of natural history are plundered\nby paid thieves, [Footnote: When we last landed at Liverpool (May 22),\nthe top tray of my wife’s trunk reached us empty, and some of the\nchoicest birds shot by Cameron and myself were stolen. Since the days of\nWaterton the Liverpudlian custom-house has been a scandal and a national\ndisgrace.] and where I have been obliged to drop my solitary bottle of\nSyrian raki!",
        "I was hotelled at the ’Royal Edinburgh,’ and enjoyed once more the\nrestful calm of a quasi-tropical night, broken only by the Christmas\ntwanging of the machete (which is to the guitar what kit is to fiddle);\nby the clicking of the pebbles on the shore, and by the gentle murmuring\nof the waves under the window.",
        "NOTE.–The Madeiran Archipelago consists of five islands disposed in a\nscalene triangle, whose points are Porto Santo (23 miles, north-east),\nMadeira (west), and the three Desertas (11 miles, south-east). The Great\nand Little Piton of the Selvagens, or Salvages (100 miles, south),\nthough belonging to Portugal and to the district of Funchal, are\ngeographically included in the Canarian group. Thus, probably, we may\nexplain the ’Aprositos,’ or Inaccessible Island, which Ptolemy",
        "[Footnote: The great Alexandrian is here (iv. 6, §§ 33-4) sadly out of\nhis reckoning. He places the group of six islands adjacent to Libya many\ndegrees too far south (N. lat. 10°-16°), and assigns one meridian (0° 0’\n0”) to Aprositos, Pluitana (Pluvialia? Hierro?), Caspeiria (Capraria?\nLanzarote?), and another and the same (1° 0’ 0”) to Pintouaria (Nivaria?\nTenerife?), Hera (Junonia? Gomera?), and Canaria.]",
        "includes in his Six Fortunates; and the Isle of SS. Borondon and\nMaclovius the Welshman (St. Malo). The run from Lizard’s Point is laid\ndown at 1,164 miles; from Lisbon, 535; from Cape Cantin, 320; from\nMogador (9° 40’ west long.), 380; and 260 from Santa Cruz, Tenerife. The\nmain island lies between N. lat. 32° 49’ 44” and 32° 37’ 18\"; the\nparallel is that of Egypt, of Upper India, of Nankin, and of\nCalifornia. Its longitude is included within 16° 39’ 30” and 17° 16’ 38\"\nwest of Greenwich. The extreme length is thus 37-1/2 (usually set down\nas 33 to 54) miles; the breadth, 12-1/2 (popularly 15-16 1/2); the\ncircumference, 72; the coast-line, about 110; and the area, 240–nearly\nthe size of Huntingdonshire, a little smaller than the Isle of Man, and\na quarter larger than the Isle of Wight. Pico Ruivo, the apex of the\ncentral volcanic ridge, rises 6,050-6,100 feet, with a slope of 1 in\n3.75; the perpetual snow-line being here 11,500. Madeira is supposed to\ntower from a narrow oceanic trough, ranging between 13,200 and 16,800\nfeet deep. Of 340 days, there are 263 of north-east winds, 8 of north, 7\nof east, and 62 of west. The rainfall averages only 29.82 to 30.62\ninches per annum. The over-humidity of the climate arises from its lying\nin the Guinea Gulf Stream, which bends southward, about the Azores, from\nits parent the great Gulf Stream, striking the Canaries and flowing\nalong the Guinea shore. (White and Johnson’s Guide-Book, and ’Du Climat\nde Madère,’ &c., par A. C. Mourão-Pitta, Montpellier, 1859, the latter\nably pleading a special cause.)",
