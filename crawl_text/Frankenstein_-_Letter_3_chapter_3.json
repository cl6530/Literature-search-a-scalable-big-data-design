        "I write a few lines in haste to say that I am safe–and well advanced\non my voyage.  This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on\nits homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not\nsee my native land, perhaps, for many years.  I am, however, in good\nspirits:  my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do the\nfloating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers\nof the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them.

Why not\nstill proceed over the untamed yet obedient element?  What can stop the\ndetermined heart and resolved will of man?",
        "My swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus.  But must\nfinish.  Heaven bless my beloved sister!",
