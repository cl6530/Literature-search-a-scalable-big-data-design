        "The earliest accounts of Southampton are vague and uncertain. On the\nopposite bank of the Itchen, at Bitterne, was the Roman station of\nClausentum, but Southampton itself seems to have been originally a\nsettlement of the West Saxons. In the reign of William the Conqueror,\nSouthampton, owing to its situation, became the principal port of\nembarkation for Normandy. In 1295 it first returned representatives to\nParliament, and in 1345 was strongly fortified, and able to contribute\ntwenty-one ships to the Royal Navy, Portsmouth only supplying five. Many\nexpeditions for Normandy embarked here during the reigns of the\nPlantagenets, and the men who fought and won at Crecy and Agincourt must\nhave passed, on the way to their ships, under the old West Gate, which\nstill remains much as it was in those stirring times.",
        "The town is full of interesting relics of every description, one of the\nmost remarkable being the old wall, of which a considerable portion\nremains; that known as The Arcades, built in a series of arches, being\nspecially noticeable. Close by, in Blue Anchor Lane, is a Norman house,\nreputed to be King John’s palace, and claiming, with several others, to\nbe the oldest house in England.",
        "The town was formerly entered by several gates, two of which, Westgate\nand Bargate, are still in a good state of preservation.",
        "The Bargate stands in the centre of the High Street, and is an excellent\nexample of mediaeval fortification.",
        "At the head of Blue Anchor Lane is the remarkably picturesque and\nsubstantial Tudor house, once the residence of Henry VIII. and Anne\nBoleyn, and nearly opposite rises the tall tower of St. Michael’s, the\noldest church in Southampton. The building is open all day (the keys\nbeing obtainable on inquiry), and contains a remarkable carved black\nmarble font, reputed to be of Byzantine origin, and a fine eagle lectern\nof the fifteenth century.",
