        "Ambleside, situated in the very centre of the Lake District, is by many\nregarded as the most tempting spot in the whole region.",
        "It is a long and straggling town of about 2000 inhabitants. The old\nchurch stands up the hill, in the more picturesque part of the town. The\nold ceremony of “rush-bearing,” dating from the time of Gregory IV., is\nstill, in a modified form, an annual function in Ambleside, which, with\none or two Westmorland villages, can claim the custom as unique.",
        "About a mile south from Ambleside is the northern extremity of Lake\nWindermere, 10-1/2 miles long, and varying in breadth from a mile in the\nwidest part to a few hundred yards in the narrowest. The surrounding\nscenery is magnificent, of a soft and graceful beauty, which forms a\nwonderful contrast to the wild and sublime grandeur of other parts of\nthe Lake District. There are a number of beautiful islands in the lake,\nwhich is very plentifully stocked with fish.",
        "The little lake at Grasmere, a village to the north of Ambleside, is one\nof the gems of the Lakeland scenery; indeed, Grasmere is an excellent\ncentre from which to visit some of the points of interest in the\ndistrict. Wordsworth’s cottage stands half a mile outside the village.",
        "Within easy reach of Ambleside are Coniston village and lake, upon which\na little steamer plies. Near the head of the lake is Coniston Hall, now\na farmhouse, but for long the seat of the Le Flemings, a well-known\nWestmorland family.",
        "Among the numerous other places of interest near Ambleside are\nHawkshead, the scene of Wordsworth’s school life, and a most charmingly\npicturesque village; Patterdale and the surrounding district; Langdale\nPikes, Shap Fells, and Stockgill Force, a fine waterfall 150 feet high.",
