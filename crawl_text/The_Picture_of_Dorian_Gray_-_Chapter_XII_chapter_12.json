        "At nine o’clock the next morning his servant came in with a\ncup of chocolate on a tray, and opened the shutters.  Dorian was\nsleeping quite peacefully, lying on his right side, with one hand\nunderneath his cheek.  He looked like a boy who had been tired out\nwith play, or study.",
        "The man had to touch him twice on the shoulder before he woke, and as\nhe opened his eyes a faint smile passed across his lips, as though he\nhad been having some delightful dream.  Yet he had not dreamed at\nall.  His night had been untroubled by any images of pleasure or of\npain.  But youth smiles without any reason.  It is one of its\nchiefest charms.",
        "He turned round, and, leaning on his elbow, began to drink his\nchocolate.  The mellow November sun was streaming into the room.  The\nsky was bright blue, and there was a genial warmth in the air.  It\nwas almost like a morning in May.",
        "Gradually the events of the preceding night crept with silent blood-\nstained feet into his brain, and reconstructed themselves there with\nterrible distinctness.  He winced at the memory of all that he had\nsuffered, and for a moment the same curious feeling of loathing for\nBasil Hallward, that had made him kill him as he sat in the chair,\ncame back to him, and he grew cold with passion.  The dead man was\nstill sitting there, too, and in the sunlight now.  How horrible that\nwas!  Such hideous things were for the darkness, not for the day.",
        "He felt that if he brooded on what he had gone through he would\nsicken or grow mad.  There were sins whose fascination was more in\nthe memory than in the doing of them, strange triumphs that gratified\nthe pride more than the passions, and gave to the intellect a\nquickened sense of joy, greater than any joy they brought, or could\never bring, to the senses.  But this was not one of them.  It was a\nthing to be driven out of the mind, to be drugged with poppies, to be\nstrangled lest it might strangle one itself.",
        "He passed his hand across his forehead, and then got up hastily, and\ndressed himself with even more than his usual attention, giving a\ngood deal of care to the selection of his necktie and scarf-pin, and\nchanging his rings more than once.",
        "He spent a long time over breakfast, tasting the various dishes,\ntalking to his valet about some new liveries that he was thinking of\n[87] getting made for the servants at Selby, and going through his\ncorrespondence.  Over some of the letters he smiled.  Three of them\nbored him.  One he read several times over, and then tore up with a\nslight look of annoyance in his face.  “That awful thing, a woman’s\nmemory!” as Lord Henry had once said.",
        "When he had drunk his coffee, he sat down at the table, and wrote two\nletters.  One he put in his pocket, the other he handed to the valet.",
        "“Take this round to 152, Hertford Street, Francis, and if Mr.\nCampbell is out of town, get his address.”",
        "As soon as he was alone, he lit a cigarette, and began sketching upon\na piece of paper, drawing flowers, and bits of architecture, first,\nand then faces.  Suddenly he remarked that every face that he drew\nseemed to have an extraordinary likeness to Basil Hallward.  He\nfrowned, and, getting up, went over to the bookcase and took out a\nvolume at hazard.  He was determined that he would not think about\nwhat had happened, till it became absolutely necessary to do so.",
        "When he had stretched himself on the sofa, he looked at the title-\npage of the book.  It was Gautier’s “Emaux et Camées,” Charpentier’s\nJapanese-paper edition, with the Jacquemart etching.  The binding was\nof citron-green leather with a design of gilt trellis-work and dotted\npomegranates.  It had been given to him by Adrian Singleton.  As he\nturned over the pages his eye fell on the poem about the hand of\nLacenaire, the cold yellow hand “du supplice encore mal lavée,” with\nits downy red hairs and its “doigts de faune.”  He glanced at his own\nwhite taper fingers, and passed on, till he came to those lovely\nverses upon Venice:",
        "     Sur une gamme chromatique,\n        Le sein de perles ruisselant,\n     La Vénus de l’Adriatique\n        Sort de l’eau son corps rose et blanc.\n\n     Les dômes, sur l’azur des ondes\n        Suivant la phrase au pur contour,\n     S’enflent comme des gorges rondes\n        Que soulève un soupir d’amour.\n\n     L’esquif aborde et me dépose,\n        Jetant son amarre au pilier,\n     Devant une façade rose,\n        Sur le marbre d’un escalier.",
        "How exquisite they were!  As one read them, one seemed to be floating\ndown the green water-ways of the pink and pearl city, lying in a\nblack gondola with silver prow and trailing curtains.  The mere lines\nlooked to him like those straight lines of turquoise-blue that follow\none as one pushes out to the Lido.  The sudden flashes of color\nreminded him of the gleam of the opal-and-iris-throated birds that\nflutter round the tall honey-combed Campanile, or stalk, with such\nstately grace, through the dim arcades.  Leaning back with half-\nclosed eyes, he kept saying over and over to himself,–",
        "     Devant une façade rose,\n     Sur le marbre d’un escalier.",
        "[88] The whole of Venice was in those two lines.  He remembered the\nautumn that he had passed there, and a wonderful love that had\nstirred him to delightful fantastic follies.  There was romance in\nevery place.  But Venice, like Oxford, had kept the background for\nromance, and background was everything, or almost everything.  Basil\nhad been with him part of the time, and had gone wild over Tintoret.\nPoor Basil! what a horrible way for a man to die!",
        "He sighed, and took up the book again, and tried to forget.  He read\nof the swallows that fly in and out of the little café at Smyrna\nwhere the Hadjis sit counting their amber beads and the turbaned\nmerchants smoke their long tasselled pipes and talk gravely to each\nother; of the Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde that weeps tears of\ngranite in its lonely sunless exile, and longs to be back by the hot\nlotus-covered Nile, where there are Sphinxes, and rose-red ibises,\nand white vultures with gilded claws, and crocodiles, with small\nberyl eyes, that crawl over the green steaming mud; and of that\ncurious statue that Gautier compares to a contralto voice, the\n“monstre charmant” that couches in the porphyry-room of the Louvre.\nBut after a time the book fell from his hand.  He grew nervous, and a\nhorrible fit of terror came over him.  What if Alan Campbell should\nbe out of England?  Days would elapse before he could come back.\nPerhaps he might refuse to come.  What could he do then?  Every\nmoment was of vital importance.",
        "They had been great friends once, five years before,–almost\ninseparable, indeed.  Then the intimacy had come suddenly to an end.\nWhen they met in society now, it was only Dorian Gray who smiled:\nAlan Campbell never did.",
        "He was an extremely clever young man, though he had no real\nappreciation of the visible arts, and whatever little sense of the\nbeauty of poetry he possessed he had gained entirely from Dorian.\nHis dominant intellectual passion was for science.  At Cambridge he\nhad spent a great deal of his time working in the Laboratory, and had\ntaken a good class in the Natural Science tripos of his year.\nIndeed, he was still devoted to the study of chemistry, and had a\nlaboratory of his own, in which he used to shut himself up all day\nlong, greatly to the annoyance of his mother, who had set her heart\non his standing for Parliament and had a vague idea that a chemist\nwas a person who made up prescriptions.  He was an excellent\nmusician, however, as well, and played both the violin and the piano\nbetter than most amateurs.  In fact, it was music that had first\nbrought him and Dorian Gray together,–music and that indefinable\nattraction that Dorian seemed to be able to exercise whenever he\nwished, and indeed exercised often without being conscious of it.\nThey had met at Lady Berkshire’s the night that Rubinstein played\nthere, and after that used to be always seen together at the Opera,\nand wherever good music was going on.  For eighteen months their\nintimacy lasted.  Campbell was always either at Selby Royal or in\nGrosvenor Square.  To him, as to many others, Dorian Gray was the\ntype of everything that is wonderful and fascinating in life.\nWhether or not a quarrel had taken place between them no one ever\nknew.  But suddenly people remarked that they scarcely spoke when\n[89] they met, and that Campbell seemed always to go away early from\nany party at which Dorian Gray was present.  He had changed, too,–\nwas strangely melancholy at times, appeared almost to dislike hearing\nmusic of any passionate character, and would never himself play,\ngiving as his excuse, when he was called upon, that he was so\nabsorbed in science that he had no time left in which to practise.\nAnd this was certainly true.  Every day he seemed to become more\ninterested in biology, and his name appeared once or twice in some of\nthe scientific reviews, in connection with certain curious\nexperiments.",
        "This was the man that Dorian Gray was waiting for, pacing up and down\nthe room, glancing every moment at the clock, and becoming horribly\nagitated as the minutes went by.  At last the door opened, and his\nservant entered.",
        "“Mr. Alan Campbell, sir.”",
        "A sigh of relief broke from his parched lips, and the color came back\nto his cheeks.",
        "“Ask him to come in at once, Francis.”",
        "The man bowed, and retired.  In a few moments Alan Campbell walked\nin, looking very stern and rather pale, his pallor being intensified\nby his coal-black hair and dark eyebrows.",
        "“Alan! this is kind of you.  I thank you for coming.”",
        "“I had intended never to enter your house again, Gray.  But you said\nit was a matter of life and death.”  His voice was hard and cold.  He\nspoke with slow deliberation.  There was a look of contempt in the\nsteady searching gaze that he turned on Dorian.  He kept his hands in\nthe pockets of his Astrakhan coat, and appeared not to have noticed\nthe gesture with which he had been greeted.",
        "“It is a matter of life and death, Alan, and to more than one person.\nSit down.”",
        "Campbell took a chair by the table, and Dorian sat opposite to him.\nThe two men’s eyes met.  In Dorian’s there was infinite pity.  He\nknew that what he was going to do was dreadful.",
        "After a strained moment of silence, he leaned across and said, very\nquietly, but watching the effect of each word upon the face of the\nman he had sent for, “Alan, in a locked room at the top of this\nhouse, a room to which nobody but myself has access, a dead man is\nseated at a table.  He has been dead ten hours now.  Don’t stir, and\ndon’t look at me like that.  Who the man is, why he died, how he\ndied, are matters that do not concern you.  What you have to do is\nthis–”",
        "“Stop, Gray.  I don’t want to know anything further.  Whether what\nyou have told me is true or not true, doesn’t concern me.  I entirely\ndecline to be mixed up in your life.  Keep your horrible secrets to\nyourself.  They don’t interest me any more.”",
        "“Alan, they will have to interest you.  This one will have to\ninterest you.  I am awfully sorry for you, Alan.  But I can’t help\nmyself.  You are the one man who is able to save me.  I am forced to\nbring you into the matter.  I have no option.  Alan, you are a\nscientist.  You know about chemistry, and things of that kind.  You\nhave made experiments.  What you have got to do is to destroy the\n[90] thing that is up-stairs,–to destroy it so that not a vestige\nwill be left of it.  Nobody saw this person come into the house.\nIndeed, at the present moment he is supposed to be in Paris.  He will\nnot be missed for months.  When he is missed, there must be no trace\nof him found here.  You, Alan, you must change him, and everything\nthat belongs to him, into a handful of ashes that I may scatter in\nthe air.”",
        "“You are mad, Dorian.”",
        "“Ah!  I was waiting for you to call me Dorian.”",
        "“You are mad, I tell you,–mad to imagine that I would raise a finger\nto help you, mad to make this monstrous confession.  I will have\nnothing to do with this matter, whatever it is.  Do you think I am\ngoing to peril my reputation for you?  What is it to me what devil’s\nwork you are up to?”",
        "“It was a suicide, Alan.”",
        "“I am glad of that.  But who drove him to it?  You, I should fancy.”",
        "“Do you still refuse to do this, for me?”",
        "“Of course I refuse.  I will have absolutely nothing to do with it.\nI don’t care what shame comes on you.  You deserve it all.  I should\nnot be sorry to see you disgraced, publicly disgraced.  How dare you\nask me, of all men in the world, to mix myself up in this horror?  I\nshould have thought you knew more about people’s characters.  Your\nfriend Lord Henry Wotton can’t have taught you much about psychology,\nwhatever else he has taught you.  Nothing will induce me to stir a\nstep to help you.  You have come to the wrong man.  Go to some of\nyour friends.  Don’t come to me.”",
        "“Alan, it was murder.  I killed him.  You don’t know what he had made\nme suffer.  Whatever my life is, he had more to do with the making or\nthe marring of it than poor Harry has had.  He may not have intended\nit, the result was the same.”",
        "“Murder!  Good God, Dorian, is that what you have come to?  I shall\nnot inform upon you.  It is not my business.  Besides, you are\ncertain to be arrested, without my stirring in the matter.  Nobody\never commits a murder without doing something stupid.  But I will\nhave nothing to do with it.”",
        "“All I ask of you is to perform a certain scientific experiment.  You\ngo to hospitals and dead-houses, and the horrors that you do there\ndon’t affect you.  If in some hideous dissecting-room or fetid\nlaboratory you found this man lying on a leaden table with red\ngutters scooped out in it, you would simply look upon him as an\nadmirable subject.  You would not turn a hair.  You would not believe\nthat you were doing anything wrong.  On the contrary, you would\nprobably feel that you were benefiting the human race, or increasing\nthe sum of knowledge in the world, or gratifying intellectual\ncuriosity, or something of that kind.  What I want you to do is\nsimply what you have often done before.  Indeed, to destroy a body\nmust be less horrible than what you are accustomed to work at.  And,\nremember, it is the only piece of evidence against me.  If it is\ndiscovered, I am lost; and it is sure to be discovered unless you\nhelp me.”",
        "[91] “I have no desire to help you.  You forget that.  I am simply\nindifferent to the whole thing.  It has nothing to do with me.”",
        "“Alan, I entreat you.  Think of the position I am in.  Just before\nyou came I almost fainted with terror.  No! don’t think of that.\nLook at the matter purely from the scientific point of view.  You\ndon’t inquire where the dead things on which you experiment come\nfrom.  Don’t inquire now.  I have told you too much as it is.  But I\nbeg of you to do this.  We were friends once, Alan.”",
        "“Don’t speak about those days, Dorian: they are dead.”",
        "“The dead linger sometimes.  The man up-stairs will not go away.  He\nis sitting at the table with bowed head and outstretched arms.  Alan!\nAlan! if you don’t come to my assistance I am ruined.  Why, they will\nhang me, Alan!  Don’t you understand?  They will hang me for what I\nhave done.”",
        "“There is no good in prolonging this scene.  I refuse absolutely to\ndo anything in the matter.  It is insane of you to ask me.”",
        "“You refuse absolutely?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "The same look of pity came into Dorian’s eyes, then he stretched out\nhis hand, took a piece of paper, and wrote something on it.  He read\nit over twice, folded it carefully, and pushed it across the table.\nHaving done this, he got up, and went over to the window.",
        "Campbell looked at him in surprise, and then took up the paper, and\nopened it.  As he read it, his face became ghastly pale, and he fell\nback in his chair.  A horrible sense of sickness came over him.  He\nfelt as if his heart was beating itself to death in some empty\nhollow.",
        "After two or three minutes of terrible silence, Dorian turned round,\nand came and stood behind him, putting his hand upon his shoulder.",
        "“I am so sorry, Alan,” he murmured, “but you leave me no alternative.\nI have a letter written already.  Here it is.  You see the address.\nIf you don’t help me, I must send it.  You know what the result will\nbe.  But you are going to help me.  It is impossible for you to\nrefuse now.  I tried to spare you.  You will do me the justice to\nadmit that.  You were stern, harsh, offensive.  You treated me as no\nman has ever dared to treat me,–no living man, at any rate.  I bore\nit all.  Now it is for me to dictate terms.”",
        "Campbell buried his face in his hands, and a shudder passed through\nhim.",
        "“Yes, it is my turn to dictate terms, Alan.  You know what they are.\nThe thing is quite simple.  Come, don’t work yourself into this\nfever.  The thing has to be done.  Face it, and do it.”",
        "A groan broke from Campbell’s lips, and he shivered all over.  The\nticking of the clock on the mantel-piece seemed to him to be dividing\ntime into separate atoms of agony, each of which was too terrible to\nbe borne.  He felt as if an iron ring was being slowly tightened\nround his forehead, and as if the disgrace with which he was\nthreatened had already come upon him.  The hand upon his shoulder\nweighed like a hand of lead.  It was intolerable.  It seemed to crush\nhim.",
        "“Come, Alan, you must decide at once.”",
        "[92] He hesitated a moment.  “Is there a fire in the room up-stairs?\"\nhe murmured.",
        "“Yes, there is a gas-fire with asbestos.”",
        "“I will have to go home and get some things from the laboratory.”",
        "“No, Alan, you need not leave the house.  Write on a sheet of note-\npaper what you want, and my servant will take a cab and bring the\nthings back to you.”",
        "Campbell wrote a few lines, blotted them, and addressed an envelope\nto his assistant.  Dorian took the note up and read it carefully.\nThen he rang the bell, and gave it to his valet, with orders to\nreturn as soon as possible, and to bring the things with him.",
        "When the hall door shut, Campbell started, and, having got up from\nthe chair, went over to the chimney-piece.  He was shivering with a\nsort of ague.  For nearly twenty minutes, neither of the men spoke.\nA fly buzzed noisily about the room, and the ticking of the clock was\nlike the beat of a hammer.",
        "As the chime struck one, Campbell turned around, and, looking at\nDorian Gray, saw that his eyes were filled with tears.  There was\nsomething in the purity and refinement of that sad face that seemed\nto enrage him.  “You are infamous, absolutely infamous!” he muttered.",
        "“Hush, Alan: you have saved my life,” said Dorian.",
        "“Your life?  Good heavens! what a life that is!  You have gone from\ncorruption to corruption, and now you have culminated in crime.  In\ndoing what I am going to do, what you force me to do, it is not of\nyour life that I am thinking.”",
        "“Ah, Alan,” murmured Dorian, with a sigh, “I wish you had a\nthousandth part of the pity for me that I have for you.”  He turned\naway, as he spoke, and stood looking out at the garden.  Campbell\nmade no answer.",
        "After about ten minutes a knock came to the door, and the servant\nentered, carrying a mahogany chest of chemicals, with a small\nelectric battery set on top of it.  He placed it on the table, and\nwent out again, returning with a long coil of steel and platinum wire\nand two rather curiously-shaped iron clamps.",
        "“Shall I leave the things here, sir?” he asked Campbell.",
        "“Yes,” said Dorian.  “And I am afraid, Francis, that I have another\nerrand for you.  What is the name of the man at Richmond who supplies\nSelby with orchids?”",
        "“Harden, sir.”",
        "“Yes,–Harden.  You must go down to Richmond at once, see Harden\npersonally, and tell him to send twice as many orchids as I ordered,\nand to have as few white ones as possible.  In fact, I don’t want any\nwhite ones.  It is a lovely day, Francis, and Richmond is a very\npretty place, otherwise I wouldn’t bother you about it.”",
        "“No trouble, sir.  At what time shall I be back?”",
        "Dorian looked at Campbell.  “How long will your experiment take,\nAlan?” he said, in a calm, indifferent voice.  The presence of a\nthird person in the room seemed to give him extraordinary courage.",
        "Campbell frowned, and bit his lip.  “It will take about five hours,\"\nhe answered.",
        "[93] “It will be time enough, then, if you are back at half-past\nseven, Francis.  Or stay: just leave my things out for dressing.  You\ncan have the evening to yourself.  I am not dining at home, so I\nshall not want you.”",
        "“Thank you, sir,” said the man, leaving the room.",
        "“Now, Alan, there is not a moment to be lost.  How heavy this chest\nis!  I’ll take it for you.  You bring the other things.”  He spoke\nrapidly, and in an authoritative manner.  Campbell felt dominated by\nhim.  They left the room together.",
        "When they reached the top landing, Dorian took out the key and turned\nit in the lock.  Then he stopped, and a troubled look came into his\neyes.  He shuddered.  “I don’t think I can go in, Alan,” he murmured.",
        "“It is nothing to me.  I don’t require you,” said Campbell, coldly.",
        "Dorian half opened the door.  As he did so, he saw the face of the\nportrait grinning in the sunlight.  On the floor in front of it the\ntorn curtain was lying.  He remembered that the night before, for the\nfirst time in his life, he had forgotten to hide it, when he crept\nout of the room.",
        "But what was that loathsome red dew that gleamed, wet and glistening,\non one of the hands, as though the canvas had sweated blood?  How\nhorrible it was!–more horrible, it seemed to him for the moment,\nthan the silent thing that he knew was stretched across the table,\nthe thing whose grotesque misshapen shadow on the spotted carpet\nshowed him that it had not stirred, but was still there, as he had\nleft it.",
        "He opened the door a little wider, and walked quickly in, with half-\nclosed eyes and averted head, determined that he would not look even\nonce upon the dead man.  Then, stooping down, and taking up the gold-\nand-purple hanging, he flung it over the picture.",
        "He stopped, feeling afraid to turn round, and his eyes fixed\nthemselves on the intricacies of the pattern before him.  He heard\nCampbell bringing in the heavy chest, and the irons, and the other\nthings that he had required for his dreadful work.  He began to\nwonder if he and Basil Hallward had ever met, and, if so, what they\nhad thought of each other.",
        "“Leave me now,” said Campbell.",
        "He turned and hurried out, just conscious that the dead man had been\nthrust back into the chair and was sitting up in it, with Campbell\ngazing into the glistening yellow face.  As he was going downstairs\nhe heard the key being turned in the lock.",
        "It was long after seven o’clock when Campbell came back into the\nlibrary.  He was pale, but absolutely calm.  “I have done what you\nasked me to do,” he muttered.  “And now, good-by.  Let us never see\neach other again.”",
        "“You have saved me from ruin, Alan.  I cannot forget that,” said\nDorian, simply.",
        "As soon as Campbell had left, he went up-stairs.  There was a\nhorrible smell of chemicals in the room.  But the thing that had been\nsitting at the table was gone.",
