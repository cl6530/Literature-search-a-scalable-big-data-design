        "And now the day was ended / and nearing was the night.\nCame then the thought with longing / unto each way-worn knight,\nWhen that they might rest them / and to their beds be shown.\n’Twas mooted first by Hagen / and straight was answer then made known.",
        "1819",
        "To Etzel spake then Gunther: / “Fair days may God thee give!\nTo bed we’ll now betake us, / an be it by thy leave;\nWe’ll come betimes at morning, / if so thy pleasure be.\"\nFrom his guests the monarch / parted then full courteously.",
        "1820",
        "Upon the guests on all sides / the Huns yet rudely pressed,\nWhereat the valiant Volker / these words to them addressed:\n“How dare ye ’fore these warriors / thus beset the way?\nIf that ye desist not, / rue such rashness soon ye may.",
        "1821",
        "“Let fall will I on some one / such stroke of fiddle-bow,\nThat eyes shall fill with weeping / if he hath friend to show.\nWhy make not way before us, / as fitting were to do!\nKnights by name ye all are, / but knighthood’s ways unknown to you.”",
        "1822",
        "When outspake the Fiddler / thus so wrathfully\nBackward glanced bold Hagen / to see what this might be.\nQuoth he: “He redes you rightly, / this keen minstrel knight.\nYe followers of Kriemhild, / now pass to rest you for the night.",
        "1823",
        "“The thing whereof ye’re minded / will none dare do, I ween.\nIf aught ye purpose ’gainst us, / on the morrow be that seen,\nAnd let us weary strangers / the night in quiet pass;\nI ween, with knights of honor / such evermore the custom was.”",
        "1824",
        "Then were led the strangers / into a spacious hall\nWhere they found prepared / for the warriors one and all\nBeds adorned full richly, / that were both wide and long.\nYet planned the Lady Kriemhild / to work on them the direst wrong.",
        "1825",
        "Rich quilted mattress covers / of Arras saw ye there\nLustrous all and silken, / and spreading sheets there were\nWrought of silk of Araby, / the best might e’er be seen.\nO’er them lay rich embroidered / stuffs that cast a brilliant sheen.",
        "1826",
        "Coverlets of ermine / full many might ye see,\nWith sullen sable mingled, / whereunder peacefully\nThey should rest the night through / till came the shining day.\nA king with all retinue / ne’er, I ween, so stately lay.",
        "1827",
        "“Alack for these night-quarters!\" / quoth young Giselher,\n“Alack for my companions / who this our journey share!\nHow kind so e’er my sister’s / hospitality,\nDead by her devising, / I fear me, are we doomed to be.”",
        "1828",
        "“Let now no fears disturb you,\" / Hagen gave reply;\n“Through the hours of sleeping / keep the watch will I.\nI trust full well to guard you / until return the day,\nThereof be never fearful; / let then preserve him well who may.”",
        "1829",
        "Inclined they all before him / thereat to give him grace.\nThen sought they straight their couches; / in sooth ’twas little space\nUntil was softly resting / every stately man.\nBut Hagen, valiant hero, / the while to don his armor gan.",
        "1830",
        "Spake then to him the Fiddler, / Volker a doughty thane:\n“I’ll be thy fellow, Hagen, / an wilt thou not disdain,\nWhile watch this night thou keepest, / until do come the morn.\"\nRight heartily the hero / to Volker then did thanks return.",
        "1831",
        "“God in heaven requite thee, / Volker, trusty fere.\nIn all my time of trouble / wished I none other near,\nNone other but thee only, / when dangers round me throng.\nI’ll well repay that favor, / if death withhold its hand so long.”",
        "1832",
        "Arrayed in glittering armor / both soon did ready stand;\nEach did take unto him / a mighty shield in hand,\nAnd passed without the portal / there to keep the way.\nThus were the strangers guarded, / and trusty watchers eke had they.",
        "1833",
        "Volker the valiant, / as he sat before the hall,\nLeaned his trusty buckler / meanwhile against the wall,\nThen took in hand his fiddle / as he was wont to do:\nAll times the thane would render / unto his friends a service true.",
        "1834",
        "Beneath the hall’s wide portal / he sat on bench of stone;\nThan he a bolder fiddler / was there never none.\nAs from his chords sweet echoes / resounded through the hall,\nThanks for glad refreshment / had Volker from the warriors all.",
        "1835",
        "Then from the strings an echo / the wide hall did fill,\nFor in his fiddle-playing / the knight had strength and skill.\nSofter then and sweeter / to fiddle he began\nAnd wiled to peaceful slumber / many an anxious brooding man.",
        "1836",
        "When they were wrapped in slumber / and he did understand,\nThen took again the warrior / his trusty shield in hand\nAnd passed without the portal / to guard the entrance tower,\nAnd safe to keep his fellows / where Kriemhild’s crafty men did lower.",
        "1837",
        "About the hour of midnight, / or earlier perchance,\nThe eye of valiant Volker / did catch a helmet’s glance\nAfar from out the darkness: / the men of Kriemhild sought\nHow that upon the strangers / might grievous scathe in stealth be\n      wrought.",
        "1838",
        "Quoth thereat the Fiddler: / “Friend Hagen, ’tis full clear\nThat we do well together / here this watch to share.\nI see before us yonder / men armed for the fight;\nI ween they will attack us, / if I their purpose judge aright.”",
        "1839",
        "“Be silent, then,” spake Hagen, / “and let them come more nigh.\nEre that they perceive us / shall helmets sit awry,\nBy good swords disjointed / that in our hands do swing.\nTale of vigorous greeting / shall they back to Kriemhild bring.”",
        "1840",
        "Amid the Hunnish warriors / one full soon did see,\nThat well the door was guarded; / straightway then cried he:\n“The thing we here did purpose / ’tis need we now give o’er,\nFor I behold the Fiddler / standing guard before the door.",
        "1841",
        "“Upon his head a helmet / of glancing light is seen,\nWelded strong and skilful, / dintless, of clearest sheen.\nThe mail-rings of his armor / do sparkle like the fire,\nBeside him stands eke Hagen; / safe are the strangers from our ire.”",
        "1842",
        "Straightway they back returned. / When Volker that did see,\nUnto his companion / wrathfully spake he:\n“Now let me to those caitiffs / across the court-yard go;\nWhat mean they by such business, / from Kriemhild’s men I fain would\n      know.”",
        "1843",
        "“No, as thou dost love me,\" / Hagen straight replied;\n“If from this hall thou partest, / such ill may thee betide\nAt hands of these bold warriors / and from the swords they bear,\nThat I must haste to help thee, / though here our kinsmen’s bane it were.",
        "1844",
        "“Soon as we two together / have joined with them in fight,\nA pair or two among them / will surely hasten straight\nHither to this hall here, / and work such havoc sore\nUpon our sleeping brethren, / as must be mourned evermore.”",
        "1845",
        "Thereto gave answer Volker: / “So much natheless must be,\nThat they do learn full certain / how I the knaves did see,\nThat the men of Kriemhild / hereafter not deny\nWhat they had wrought full gladly / here with foulest treachery.”",
        "1846",
        "Straightway then unto them / aloud did Volker call:\n“How go ye thus in armor, / ye valiant warriors all?\nOr forth, perchance, a-robbing, / Kriemhild’s men, go ye?\nMyself and my companion / shall ye then have for company.”",
        "1847",
        "Thereto no man gave answer. / Wrathful grew his mood:\n“Fie, ye caitiff villains,\" / spake the hero good,\n“Would ye us so foully / have murdered while we slept?\nWith knights so high in honor / full seldom thus hath faith been kept.”",
        "1848",
        "Then unto Queen Kriemhild / were the tidings borne,\nHow her men did fail their purpose: / ’twas cause for her to mourn.\nYet otherwise she wrought it, / for grim she was of mood:\nAnon through her must perish / full many a valorous knight and good.",
