        "The day after the wedding, as Arthur was going home from work, he saw\nRoss on the lofty seat of a dogcart, driving toward him along lower\nMonroe Street. His anger instantly flamed and flared; he crushed an oath\nbetween his teeth and glanced about for some way to avoid the humiliating\nmeeting. But there was no cross street between him and the on-coming\ncart. Pride, or vanity, came to his support, as soon as he was convinced\nthat escape was impossible. With an air that was too near to defiance to\ncreate the intended impression of indifference, he swung along and, just\nas the cart was passing, glanced at his high-enthroned former friend.",
        "Ross had not seen him until their eyes met. He drew his horse in so\nsharply that it reared and pawed in amazement and indignation at the\nbit’s coarse insult to thoroughbred instincts for courteous treatment. He\nknew Arthur was at work in the factory; but he did not expect to see him\nin workman’s dress, with a dinner pail in his hand. And from his height,\nhe, clad in the carefully careless, ostentatiously unostentatious\ngarments of the “perfect gentleman,” gazed speechless at the spectacle.\nArthur reddened violently. Not all the daily contrasts thrust upon him in\nthose months at the cooperage had so brought home to his soul the\ndifferences of caste. And there came to him for the first time that\nhatred of inequalities which, repulsive though it is in theory, is yet\nthe true nerver of the strong right arm of progress. It is as\ncharacteristic of the homely, human countenance of Democracy as the\nsupercilious smirk is of the homely, inhuman countenance of caste.\nArthur did not want to get up where Ross was seated in such elegant\nstate; he wanted to tear Ross, all the Rosses down. “The damn fool!” he\nfumed. “He goes lounging about, wasting the money we make. It’s all\nwrong. And if we weren’t a herd of tame asses, we wouldn’t permit it.”",
        "And now he began to feel that he was the superior of this showy idler,\nthat his own garments and dinner pail and used hands were the titles to a\nnobility which could justly look down upon those who filched from the\ntreasury of the toiler the means to buzz and flit and glitter in\ndronelike ease. “As for these Whitneys,” he thought, “mother’s right\nabout them.” Then he called out in a tone of good-natured contempt, which\nhis stature and his powerful frame and strong, handsome face made\neffective: “Hello, Ross! When did you come to town?”",
        "“This morning,” replied Ross. “I heard you were working, but I had no\nidea it was–I’ve just been to your house, looking for you, and was on\nthe way to the factory. Father told me to see that you get a suitable\nposition. I’m going to Howells and arrange it. You know, father’s been in\nthe East and very busy.”",
        "“Don’t bother,” said Arthur, and there was no pretense in his air of\nease. “I’ve got just what I want. I am carrying out father’s plan, and\nI’m far enough into it to see that he was right.”",
        "In unbelieving silence Ross looked down at his former equal with\ncondescending sympathy; how well Arthur knew that look! And he remembered\nthat he had once, so short a time before, regarded it as kindly, and the\nthoughts behind it as generous!",
        "“I like my job,” he continued. “It gives me a sense of doing something\nuseful–of getting valuable education. Already I’ve had a thousand\ndamn-fool ideas knocked out of my head.”",
        "“I suppose it is interesting,” said Ross, with gracious encouragement.\n“The associations must be rather trying.”",
        "“They were rather trying,” replied Arthur with a smile. “Trying to the\nother men, until I got my bearings and lost the silliest of the silly\nideas put in my head by college and that sort of thing. But, now that I\nrealize I’m an apprentice and not a gentleman deigning to associate with\nthe common herd, I think I’m less despicable–and less ridiculous. Still,\nI’m finding it hard to get it through my head that practically everything\nI learned is false and must be unlearned.”",
        "“Don’t let your bitterness over the injustice to you swing you too far\nthe other way, Artie,” said Ross with a faint smile in his eyes and a\nsuspicious, irritating friendliness in his voice. “You’ll soon work out\nof that class and back where you belong.”",
        "Arthur was both angry and amused. No doubt Ross was right as to the\norigin of this new breadth of his; but a wrong motive may start a man\nright just as readily as a right motive may start him wrong. Arthur would\nhave admitted frankly his first feelings about his changed position,\nwould have admitted that those feelings still lingered, still seemed to\ninfluence him, as grown people often catch themselves thinking in terms\nof beliefs impressed on them in childhood, but exploded and abandoned at\nthe very threshold of youth. But he knew, also, that his present beliefs\nand resolves and aspirations were sincere, were sane, were final–the\nexpression of the mind and heart that were really himself. Of what use,\nhowever, to argue with Ross? “I could no more convince him,” thought\nArthur, “than I could myself have been convinced less than a year ago.\"\nBesides, of what importance were Ross’s beliefs about him or about his\nviews? So he said to him, and his tone and manner were now convincing:\n“Well, we’ll see. However, as long as I’m a workman, I’ll stand with my\nclass–just as you stand with your class. And while you are pretending to\nbe generous to us, we’ll pretend to be contemptuous of you. You’ll think\nwe are living off of your money; we’ll think you are living off of our\nwork. You’ll say we’re earning less than half what we get; we’ll say\nyou’re stealing more than half what you get. It may amuse you to hear\nthat I am one of the organizers of the trades union that’s starting. I’m\non the committee on wages. So some day you and I are likely to meet.”",
        "“I don’t know much about those things,” said Ross politely. “I can\nsee that you’re right to ingratiate yourself with those working\nchaps. It will stand you in good stead when you get on top and have\nto manage them.”",
        "Arthur laughed, and so did Ross. They eyed each the other with covert\nhostility. “Poor creature!” thought Ross. And “Pup!” thought Arthur. “How\ncould I have wanted Del to marry him?” He wished to pass on, but was\ndetained by some suggestion in Ross’s manner that he had not yet\ndischarged his mind of its real burden.",
        "“I was glad to see your mother so well,” said Ross.",
        "“I wish she were,” replied Arthur. “She seemed to be better while the\nexcitement about Del’s wedding was on; but as soon as Del and Dory went,\nshe dropped back again. I think the only thing that keeps her from–from\njoining father is the feeling that, if she were to go, the family income\nwould stop. I feel sure we’d not have her, if father had left us well\nprovided for, as they call it.”",
        "“That is true,” said Ross, the decent side of his nature now full to the\nfore. “I can’t tell you what a sense of loss I had when your father died.\nArtie, he was a splendid gentleman. And there is a quality in your mother\nthat makes me feel very humble indeed before her.”",
        "Arthur passed, though he noted, the unconscious superciliousness in this\ntribute; he felt that it was a genuine tribute, that, for all its\ndiscoloration in its passage through the tainted outer part of Ross’s\nnature, it had come from the unspoiled, untainted, deepest part.\nFortunately for us all, the gold in human nature remains gold, whatever\nits alloys from base contacts; and it is worth the mining, though there\nbe but a grain of it to the ton of dross. As Ross spoke Arthur warmed to\nhim. “You must come to see us,” he said cordially.",
        "Ross became embarrassed, so embarrassed that all his ability to command\nhis feelings went for nothing. “Thank you,” said he hurriedly, “but I’m\nhere only for a few hours. I go away to-night. I came about a matter\nthat–that–I want to get back as soon as possible.”",
        "Arthur was mystified by the complete transformation of the\nself-complacent, superior Ross of a few minutes before. He now noted that\nRoss was looking almost ill, his eyes sunken, the lids red at the edges,\nas if from loss of sleep. Under Arthur’s scrutiny his embarrassment\nincreased to panic. He nervously shifted the reins, made the horse\nrestless, shook hands with Arthur, reined in, tried to speak, said only,\n“I must be off–my horse is getting nervous,” and was gone.",
        "Arthur looked after him. “That’s the sort of chap I was on the way to\nbeing when father pulled me up,” he reflected. “I wonder if I’ll ever get\nsense enough not to have a sneaking envy of him–and regret?”",
        "If he could have looked in upon Ross’s mind, he might have been abruptly\nthrust far along the toilsome road toward his goal. In this world, roses\nand thorns have a startling, preposterous way of suddenly exchanging\nnatures so that what was thorn becomes fairest rose, and what was rose\nbecomes most poisonous of thorns. Ross had just fallen an amazed and\nincredulous victim to this alchemy. Though somewhat uncomfortable and\ndownright unhappy at times, he had been, on the whole, well pleased with\nhimself and his prospects until he heard that Adelaide was actually about\nto marry Dory. His content collapsed with the foundation on which it was\nbuilt–the feeling that Adelaide was for no other man, that if at any\ntime he should change his mind he would find her waiting to welcome him\ngratefully. He took train for Saint X, telling himself that after he got\nthere he could decide what to do. In fact, when he had heard that the\nwedding was about to be, it was over and Adelaide and Dory were off for\nNew York and Europe; but he did not find this out until he reached Saint\nX. The man who gave him that final and overwhelming news noticed no\nchange in his face, though looking for signs of emotion; nor did Ross\nleave him until he had confirmed the impression of a heart at ease. Far\nalong the path between the Country Club and Point Helen he struck into\nthe woods and, with only the birds and the squirrels as witnesses, gave\nway to his feelings.",
        "Now, now that she was irrevocably gone, he knew. He had made a hideous\nmistake; he had been led on by his vanity, led on and on until the trap\nwas closed and sprung; and it was too late. He sat there on a fallen tree\nwith his head aching as if about to explode, with eyes, dry and burning\nand a great horror of heart-hunger sitting before him and staring at him.\nIn their sufferings from defeated desire the selfish expiate their sins.",
        "He had forgotten his engagement to Theresa Howland, the wedding only\ntwo weeks away. It suddenly burst in upon his despair like a shout\nof derisive laughter. “I’ll not marry her!” he cried aloud. “I\ncan’t do it!”",
        "But even as he spoke he knew that he could, and would, and must. He had\nbeen a miserable excuse for a lover to Theresa; but Theresa had never had\nlove. All the men who had approached her with “intentions” had been\nfighting hard against their own contempt of themselves for seeking a wife\nfor the sake of her money, and their efforts at love-making had been tame\nand lame; but Theresa, knowing no better, simply thought men not up to\nthe expectations falsely raised by the romances and the songs. She\nbelieved she could not but get as good a quality of love as there was\ngoing; and Ross, with his delightful, aristocratic indifference, was\nperfectly satisfactory. Theresa had that thrice-armored self-complacence\nwhich nature so often relentingly gives, to more than supply the lack of\nthe charms withheld. She thought she was fascinating beyond any woman of\nher acquaintance, indeed, of her time. She spent hours in admiring\nherself, in studying out poses for her head and body and arms, especially\nher arms, which she regarded as nature’s last word on that kind of\nbeauty–a not wholly fanciful notion, as they were not bad, if a bit too\nshort between elbow and wrist, and rather fat at the shoulders. She\nalways thought and, on several occasions in bursts of confidence, had\nimparted to girl friends that “no man who has once cared for me can ever\ncare for another woman.” Several of her confidantes had precisely the\nsame modest opinion of their own powers; but they laughed at\nTheresa–behind her back.",
        "Ross knew how vain she was. To break with her, he would have to tell her\nflatly that he would not marry her. “I’d be doing her no injury,” thought\nhe. “Her vanity would root out some explanation which would satisfy her\nthat, whatever might be the cause, it wasn’t lack of love for her on my\npart.” But–To break off was unthinkable. The invitations out; the\narrangements for the wedding all made; quantities of presents\narrived–\"I’ve got to go through with it. I’ve got to marry her,” said\nRoss. “But God help me, how I shall hate her!”",
        "And, stripped clean of the glamour of her wealth, she rose before\nhim–her nose that was red and queer in the mornings; her little personal\nhabits that got on the nerves, especially a covert self-infatuated smile\nthat flitted over her face at any compliment, however obviously\nperfunctory; her way of talking about every trivial thing she did–and\nwhat did she do that was not trivial?–as if some diarist ought to take\nit down for the delight of ages to come. As Ross looked at the\nnew-created realistic image of her, he was amazed. “Why, I’ve always\ndisliked her!” he cried. “I’ve been lying to myself. I am too low for\nwords,” he groaned. “Was there ever such a sneaking cur?” Yes, many a\none, full as unconscious of his own qualities as he himself had been\nuntil that moment; nor could he find consolation in the fact that he had\ncompany, plenty of company, and it of the world’s most “gentlemanly” and\nmost “ladylike.”",
        "The young man who left that wood, the young man whom Arthur saw that day,\nhad in his heart a consciousness, an ache, of lonely poverty that dress\nand dogcarts and social position could do little–something, but\nlittle–to ease.",
        "He stopped at Chicago and sent word to Windrift that he was ill–not\nseriously ill, but in such a state that he thought it best to take care\nof himself, with the wedding so near. Theresa was just as well pleased\nto have him away, as it gave her absolute freedom to plan and to\nsuperintend her triumph. For the wedding was to be her individual and\nexclusive triumph, with even Ross as part of the background–the most\nconspicuous part, but still simply background for her personal splendor.",
        "Old Howland–called Bill until his early career as a pedlar and keeper of\na Cheap Jack bazaar was forgotten and who, after the great fire, which\nwiped out so many pasts and purified and pedigreed Chicago’s present\naristocracy, called himself William G. Howland, merchant prince, had, in\nhis ideal character for a wealth-chaser, one weakness–a doting fondness\nfor his daughter. When she came into the world, the doctors told him his\nwife would have no more children; thereafter his manner was always\ninsulting, and usually his tone and words, whenever and of whatever he\nspoke to her. Women were made by the Almighty solely to bear children to\nmen; his woman had been made to bear him a son. Now that she would never\nhave a son, she was of no use, and it galled him that he could find no\nplausibly respectable excuse for casting her off, as he cast off worn-out\nservants in his business. But as the years passed and he saw the various\nvarieties of thorns into which the sons of so many of his fellow-princes\ndeveloped, he became reconciled to Theresa–not to his wife. That\nunfortunate woman, the daughter of a drunkard and partially deranged by\nillness and by grief over her husband’s brutality toward her, became–or\nrather, was made by her insistent doctor–what would have been called a\ndrunkard, had she not been the wife of a prince. Her “dipsomania” took an\nunaggressive form, as she was by nature gentle and sweet; she simply used\nto shut herself in and drink until she would cry herself into a timid,\nsuppressed hysteria. So secret was she that Theresa never knew the truth\nabout these “spells.”",
        "Howland did not like Ross; but when Theresa told him she was going to\nmarry him she had only to cry a little and sit in the old man’s lap and\ntease. “Very well, then,” said her father, “you can have him. But he’s a\ngambler, like his father. They call it finance, but changing the name of\na thing only changes the smell of it, not the thing itself. I’m going to\ntie my money up so that he can’t get at it.”",
        "“I want you to, papa,” replied Theresa, giving him a kiss and a great hug\nfor emphasis. “I don’t want anybody to be able to touch my property.”",
        "For the wedding, Howland gave Theresa a free hand. “I’ll pay the bills,\nno matter what they are,” said he. “Give yourself a good time.” And\nTheresa, who had been brought up to be selfish, and was prudent about her\nimpulses only where she suspected them of being generous, proceeded to\narrange for herself the wedding that is still talked about in Chicago\n“society” and throughout the Middle West. A dressmaker from the Rue de la\nPaix came over with models and samples, and carried back a huge order and\na plaster reproduction of Theresa’s figure, and elaborate notes on the\ncolor of her skin, hair, eyes, and her preferences in shapes of hats. A\njeweler, also of the Rue de la Paix, came with jewels–nearly a million\ndollars’ worth–for her to make selections. Her boots and shoes and\nslippers she got from Rowney, in Fifth Avenue, who, as everybody knows,\nmakes nothing for less than thirty-five dollars, and can put a hundred\ndollars worth of price, if not of value, into a pair of evening slippers.\nTheresa was proud of her feet; they were short and plump, and had those\nabrupt, towering insteps that are regarded by the people who have them as\nunfailing indications of haughty lineage, just as the people who have\nflat feet dwell fondly upon the flat feet of the Wittlesbachs, kings in\nBavaria. She was not easy to please in the matter of casements for those\nfeet; also, as she was very short in stature, she had to get three and a\nhalf extra inches of height out of her heels; and to make that sort of\nheel so that it can even be hobbled upon is not easy or cheap. Once\nTheresa, fretting about her red-ended nose and muddy skin, had gone to a\nspecialist. “Let me see your foot,” said he; and when he saw the heel, he\nexclaimed: “Cut that tight, high-heeled thing out or you’ll never get a\ndecent skin, and your eyes will trouble you by the time you are thirty.\"\nBut Theresa, before adopting such drastic measures, went to a beauty\ndoctor. He assured her that she could be cured without the sacrifice of\nthe heel, and that the weakness of her eyes would disappear a year or so\nafter marriage. And he was soon going into ecstasies over her\nimprovement, over the radiance of her beauty. She saw with his eyes and\nceased to bother about nose or skin–they were the least beautiful of her\nbeauties, but–\"One can’t expect to be absolutely perfect. Besides, the\nabsolutely perfect kind of beauty might be monotonous.”",
        "The two weeks before the wedding were the happiest of her life. All day\nlong, each day, vans were thundering up to the rear doors of Windrift,\neach van loaded to bursting with new and magnificent, if not beautiful\ncostliness. The house was full of the employees of florists, dressmakers,\ndecorators, each one striving to outdo the other in servility. Theresa\nwas like an autocratic sovereign, queening it over these menials and\nfancying herself adored. They showed so plainly that they were awed by\nher and were in ecstasies of admiration over her taste. And, as the\ngrounds and the house were transformed, Theresa’s exaltation grew until\nshe went about fairly dizzy with delight in herself.",
        "The bridesmaids and ushers came. They were wealth-worshipers all, and\ntheir homage lifted Theresa still higher. They marched and swept about in\nher train, lording it over the menials and feeling that they were not a\nwhit behind the grand ladies and gentlemen of the French courts of the\neighteenth century. They had read the memoirs of that idyllic period\ndiligently, had read with minds only for the flimsy glitter which hid the\nvulgarity and silliness and shame as a gorgeous robe hastily donned by a\ndirty chambermaid might conceal from a casual glance the sardonic and\nrepulsive contrast. The wedding day approached all too swiftly for\nTheresa and her court. True, that would be the magnificent climax; but\nthey knew it would also dissipate the spell–after the wedding, life in\ntwentieth century America again.",
        "“If only it don’t rain!” said Harry Legendre.",
        "“It won’t,” replied Theresa with conviction–and her look of command\ntoward the heavens made the courtiers exchange winks and smiles behind\nher back. They were courtiers to wealth, not to Theresa, just as their\nEuropean prototypes are awed before a “king’s most excellent Majesty,\"\nnot before his swollen body and shrunken brain.",
        "And it did not rain. Ross arrived in the red sunset of the wedding eve,\nTom Glenning, his best man, coming with him. They were put, with the\nushers, in rooms at the pavilion where were the squash courts and winter\ntennis courts and the swimming baths. Theresa and Ross stood on the front\nporch alone in the moonlight, looking out over the enchantment-like scene\ninto which the florists and decorators had transformed the terraces and\ngardens. She was a little alarmed by his white face and sunken eyes; but\nshe accepted his reassurances without question–she would have\ndisbelieved anything which did not fit in with her plans. And now, as\nthey gazed out upon that beauty under the soft shimmer of the moonlight,\nher heart suddenly expanded in tenderness. “I am so happy,” she\nmurmured, slipping an arm through his.",
        "Her act called for a return pressure. He gave it, much as a woman’s\nsalutation would have made him unconsciously move to lift his hat.",
        "“While Adele was dressing me for dinner–” she began.",
        "At that name, he moved so that her arm dropped from his; but she did not\nconnect her maid with her former bosom friend.",
        "“I got to thinking about those who are not so well off as we,” she went\non; “about the poor. And so, I’ve asked papa to give all his employees\nand the servants nice presents, and I’ve sent five thousand dollars to be\ndivided among the churches in the town, down there–for the poor. Do you\nthink I did wrong? I’m always afraid of encouraging those kind of people\nto expect too much of us.”",
        "She had asked that he might echo the eulogies she had been bestowing\nupon herself. But he disappointed her. “Oh, I guess it was well\nenough,” he replied. “I must go down to the pavilion. I’m fagged, and\nyou must be, too.”",
        "The suggestion that he might not be looking his best on the morrow was\nenough to change the current of her thoughts. “Yes, do, dear!” she\nurged. “And don’t let Tom and Harry and the rest keep you up.”",
        "They did not even see him. He sat in the shed at the end of the\nboat-landing, staring out over the lake until the moon set. Then he went\nto the pavilion. It was all dark; he stole in, and to bed, but not to\nsleep. Before his closed but seeing eyes floated a vision of two\nwomen–Adelaide as he had last seen her, Theresa as she looked in the\nmornings, as she had looked that afternoon.",
        "He was haggard next day. But it was becoming to him, gave the\nfinishing touch to his customary bored, distinguished air; and he\nwas dressed in a way that made every man there envy him. As Theresa, on\ninsignificant-looking little Bill Howland’s arm, advanced to meet him at\nthe altar erected under a canopy of silk and flowers in the bower of\nlilies and roses into which the big drawing-room had been transformed,\nshe thrilled with pride. There was a man one could look at with\ndelight, as one said, “My husband!”",
        "It was a perfect day–perfect weather, everything going forward without\nhitch, everybody looking his and her best, and “Mama” providentially\ncompelled by one of her “spells” to keep to her room. Those absences of\nhers were so frequent and so much the matter of course that no one gave\nthem a second thought. Theresa had studied up the customs at fashionable\nEnglish and French weddings, and had combined the most aristocratic\nfeatures of both. Perhaps the most successful feature was when she and\nRoss, dressed for the going away, walked, she leaning upon his arm,\nacross the lawns to the silk marquee where the wedding breakfast was\nserved. Before them, walking backward, were a dozen little girls from the\nvillage school, all in white, strewing roses from beribboned baskets, and\nsinging, “Behold! The bride in beauty comes!”",
        "“Well, I’m glad it’s all over,” said Theresa as she settled back in a\nchair in the private car that was to take them to Wilderness Lodge, in\nnorthern Wisconsin for the honeymoon.",
        "“So am I,” Ross disappointed her by saying. “I’ve felt like a damn fool\never since I began to face that gaping gang.”",
        "“But you must admit it was beautiful,” objected Theresa pouting.",
        "Ross shut his teeth together to keep back a rude reply. He was\nunderstanding how men can be brutal to women. To look at her was to have\nan all but uncontrollable impulse to rise up and in a series of noisy and\nprofane explosions reveal to her the truth that was poisoning him. After\na while, a sound from her direction made him glance at her. She was\nsobbing. He did not then know that, to her, tears were simply the means\nto getting what she wanted; so his heart softened. While she was thinking\nthat she was looking particularly well and femininely attractive, he was\npitying her as a forlorn creature, who could never inspire love and ought\nto be treated with consideration, much as one tries to hide by an\neffusive show of courtesy the repulsion deformity inspires.",
        "“Don’t cry, Theresa,” he said gently, trying to make up his mind to touch\nher. But he groaned to himself, “I can’t! I must wait until I can’t see\nher.” And he ordered the porter to bring him whisky and soda.",
        "“Won’t you join me?” he said.",
        "“You know, I never touch anything to drink,” she replied. “Papa and Dr.\nMassey both made me promise not to.”",
        "Ross’s hand, reaching out for the bottle of whisky, drew slowly back. He\naverted his face that she might not see. He knew about her mother–and\nknew Theresa did not. It had never entered his head that the weakness of\nthe mother might be transmitted to the daughter. Now–Just before they\nleft, Dr. Massey had taken him aside and, in a manner that would have\nimpressed him instantly but for his mood, had said: “Mr. Whitney, I want\nyou never to forget that Theresa must not be depressed. You must take the\ngreatest care of her. We must talk about it again–when you return.”",
        "And this was what he meant!",
        "He almost leaped to his feet at Theresa’s softly interrupting voice, “Are\nyou ill, dear?”",
        "“A little–the strain–I’ll be all right–” And leaving the whisky\nuntouched, he went into his own compartment. As he was closing the door,\nhe gave a gasp of dismay. “She might begin now!” he muttered. He rang for\nthe porter. “Bring that bottle,” he said. Then, as an afterthought of\n“appearances,” “And the soda and a glass.”",
        "“I can get you another, sir,” said the porter.",
        "“No–that one,” ordered Ross.",
        "Behind the returning porter came Theresa. “Can’t I do something for you,\ndear? Rub your head, or fix the pillows?”",
        "Ross did not look at her. “Do, please–fix the pillows,” he said. “Then\nif I can sleep a little, I’ll be all right, and will soon rejoin you.”",
        "“Can’t I fix your drink for you?” she asked, putting her hand on\nthe bottle.",
        "Ross restrained an impulse to snatch it away from her. “Thanks,\nno–dear,” he answered. “I’ve decided to swear off–with you. Is it a\ngo?”",
        "She laughed. “Silly!” she murmured, bending and kissing him. “If\nyou wish.”",
        "“That settles it,” said Ross, with a forced, pained smile. “We’ll neither\nof us touch it. I was getting into the habit of taking too much–not\nreally too much–but–Oh, you understand.”",
        "“That’s the way father feels about it,” said Theresa, laughing. “We never\ndrink at home–except mother when she has a spell, and has to be kept up\non brandy.”",
        "Ross threw his arm up to hide his face. “Let me sleep, do,” he\nsaid gently.",
