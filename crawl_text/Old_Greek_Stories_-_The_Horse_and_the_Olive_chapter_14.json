        "On a steep stony hill in Greece there lived in early times a few very\npoor people who had not yet learned to build houses. They made their\nhomes in little caves which they dug in the earth or hollowed out among\nthe rocks; and their food was the flesh of wild animals, which they\nhunted in the woods, with now and then a few berries or nuts. They did\nnot even know how to make bows and arrows, but used slings and clubs and\nsharp sticks for weapons; and the little clothing which they had was\nmade of skins. They lived on the top of the hill, because they were safe\nthere from the savage beasts of the great forest around them, and safe\nalso from the wild men who sometimes roamed through the land. The hill\nwas so steep on every side that there was no way of climbing it save by\na single narrow footpath which was always guarded by some one at the\ntop.",
        "One day when the men were hunting in the woods, they found a strange\nyouth whose face was so fair and who was dressed so beautifully that\nthey could hardly believe him to be a man like themselves. His body was\nso slender and lithe, and he moved so nimbly among the trees, that they\nfancied him to be a serpent in the guise of a human being; and they\nstood still in wonder and alarm. The young man spoke to them, but they\ncould not understand a word that he said; then he made signs to them\nthat he was hungry, and they gave him something to eat and were no\nlonger afraid. Had they been like the wild men of the woods, they might\nhave killed him at once. But they wanted their women and children to see\nthe serpent man, as they called him, and hear him talk; and so they took\nhim home with them to the top of the hill. They thought that after they\nhad made a show of him for a few days, they would kill him and offer his\nbody as a sacrifice to the unknown being whom they dimly fancied to have\nsome sort of control over their lives.",
        "But the young man was so fair and gentle that, after they had all taken\na look at him, they began to think it would be a great pity to harm him.\nSo they gave him food and treated him kindly; and he sang songs to them\nand played with their children, and made them happier than they had been\nfor many a day. In a short time he learned to talk in their language;\nand he told them that his name was Cecrops, and that he had been\nshipwrecked on the seacoast not far away; and then he told them many\nstrange things about the land from which he had come and to which he\nwould never be able to return. The poor people listened and wondered;\nand it was not long until they began to love him and to look up to him\nas one wiser than themselves. Then they came to ask him about everything\nthat was to be done, and there was not one of them who refused to do his\nbidding.",
        "So Cecrops–the serpent man, as they still called him–became the king\nof the poor people on the hill. He taught them how to make bows and\narrows, and how to set nets for birds, and how to take fish with hooks.\nHe led them against the savage wild men of the woods, and helped them\nkill the fierce beasts that had been so great a terror to them. He\nshowed them how to build houses of wood and to thatch them with the\nreeds which grew in the marshes. He taught them how to live in families\ninstead of herding together like senseless beasts as they had always\ndone before. And he told them about great Jupiter and the Mighty Folk\nwho lived amid the clouds on the mountain top.",
        "By and by, instead of the wretched caves among the rocks, there was a\nlittle town on the top of the hill, with neat houses and a market place;\nand around it was a strong wall with a single narrow gate just where the\nfootpath began to descend to the plain. But as yet the place had no\nname.",
        "One morning while the king and his wise men were sitting together in the\nmarket place and planning how to make, the town become a rich, strong\ncity, two strangers were seen in the street. Nobody could tell how they\ncame there. The guard at the gate had not seen them; and no man had ever\ndared to climb the narrow footway without his leave. But there the two\nstrangers stood. One was a man, the other a woman; and they were so\ntall, and their faces were so grand and noble, that those who saw them\nstood still and wondered and said not a word.",
        "The man had a robe of purple and green wrapped round his body, and he\nbore in one hand a strong staff with three sharp spear points at one\nend. The woman was not beautiful, but she had wonderful gray eyes; and\nin one hand she carried a spear and in the other a shield of curious\nworkmanship.",
        "“What is the name of this town?” asked the man.",
        "The people stared at him in wonder, and hardly understood his meaning.\nThen an old man answered and said, “It has no name. We who live on this\nhill used to be called Cranae; but since King Cecrops came, we have been\nso busy that we have had no time to think of names.”",
        "“Where is this King Cecrops?” asked the woman.",
        "“He is in the market place with the wise men,” was the answer.",
        "“Lead us to him at once,” said the man.",
        "When Cecrops saw the two strangers coming into the market place, he\nstood up and waited for them to speak. The man spoke first:",
        "“I am Neptune,” said he, “and I rule the sea.”",
        "“And I am Athena,” said the woman, “and I give wisdom to men.”",
        "“I hear that you are planning to make your town become a great city,\"\nsaid Neptune, “and I have come to help you. Give my name to the place,\nand let me be your protector and patron, and the wealth of the whole\nworld shall be yours. Ships from every land shall bring you merchandise\nand gold and silver; and you shall be the masters of the sea.”",
        "“My uncle makes you fair promises,” said Athena; “but listen to me.\nGive my name to your city, and let me be your patron, and I will give\nyou that which gold cannot buy: I will teach you how to do a thousand\nthings of which you now know nothing. I will make your city my favorite\nhome, and I will give you wisdom that shall sway the minds and hearts of\nall men until the end of time.”",
        "The king bowed, and turned to the people, who had all crowded into the\nmarket place. “Which of these mighty ones shall we elect to be the\nprotector and patron of our city?” he asked. “Neptune offers us wealth;\nAthena promises us wisdom. Which shall we choose?”",
        "“Neptune and wealth!” cried many.",
        "“Athena and wisdom!” cried as many others.",
        "At last when it was plain that the people could not agree, an old man\nwhose advice was always heeded stood up and said:",
        "“These mighty ones have only given us promises, and they have promised\nthings of which we are ignorant. For who among us knows what wealth is\nor what wisdom is? Now, if they would only give us some real gift, right\nnow and right here, which we can see and handle, we should know better\nhow to choose.”",
        "“That is true! that is true!” cried the people.",
        "“Very well, then,” said the strangers, “we will each give you a gift,\nright now and right here, and then you may choose between us.”",
        "Neptune gave the first gift. He stood on the highest point of the hill\nwhere the rock was bare, and bade the people see his power. He raised\nhis three-pointed spear high in the air, and then brought it down with\ngreat force. Lightning flashed, the earth shook, and the rock was split\nhalf way down to the bottom of the hill. Then out of the yawning crevice\nthere sprang a wonderful creature, white as milk, with long slender\nlegs, an arching neck, and a mane and tail of silk.",
        "The people had never seen anything like it before, and they thought it a\nnew kind of bear or wolf or wild boar that had come out of the rock to\ndevour them. Some of them ran and hid in their houses, while others\nclimbed upon the wall, and still others grasped their weapons in alarm.\nBut when they saw the creature stand quietly by the side of Neptune,\nthey lost their fear and came closer to see and admire its beauty.",
        "“This is my gift,” said Neptune. “This animal will carry your burdens\nfor you; he will draw your chariots; he will pull your wagons and your\nplows; he will let you sit on his back and will run with you faster than\nthe wind.”",
        "“What is his name?” asked the king.",
        "“His name is Horse,” answered Neptune.",
        "Then Athena came forward. She stood a moment on a green grassy plot\nwhere the children of the town liked to play in the evening. Then she\ndrove the point of her spear deep down in the soil. At once the air was\nfilled with music, and out of the earth there sprang a tree with slender\nbranches and dark green leaves and white flowers and violet green fruit.",
        "“This is my gift,” said Athena. “This tree will give you food when you\nare hungry; it will shelter you from the sun when you are faint; it will\nbeautify your city; and the oil from its fruit will be sought by all the\nworld.”",
        "“What is it called?” asked the king.",
        "“It is called Olive,” answered Athena.",
        "Then the king and his wise men began to talk about the two gifts.",
        "“I do not see that Horse will be of much use to us,” said the old man\nwho had spoken before. “For, as to the chariots and wagons and plows, we\nhave none of them, and indeed do not know what they are; and who among\nus will ever want to sit on this creature’s back and be borne faster\nthan the wind? But Olive will be a thing of beauty and a joy for us and\nour children forever.”",
        "“Which shall we choose?” asked the king, turning to the people.",
        "“Athena has given us the best gift,” they all cried, “and we choose\nAthena and wisdom!”",
        "“Be it so,” said the king, “and the name of our city shall be Athens.”",
        "From that day the town grew and spread, and soon there was not room on\nthe hilltop for all the people. Then houses were built in the plain\naround the foot of the hill, and a great road was built to the sea,\nthree miles away; and in all the world there was no city more fair than\nAthens.",
        "In the old market place on the top of the hill the people built a temple\nto Athena, the ruins of which may still be seen. The olive tree grew and\nnourished; and, when you visit Athens, people will show you the very\nspot where it stood. Many other trees sprang from it, and in time became\na blessing both to Greece and to all the other countries round the great\nsea. As for the horse, he wandered away across the plains towards the\nnorth and found a home at last in distant Thessaly beyond the River\nPeneus. And I have heard it said that all the horses in the world have\ndescended from that one which Neptune brought out of the rock; but of\nthe truth of this story there may be some doubts.",
