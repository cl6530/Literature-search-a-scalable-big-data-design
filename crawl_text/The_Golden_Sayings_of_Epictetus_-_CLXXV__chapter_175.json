        "Never call yourself a Philosopher nor talk much among the\nunlearned about Principles, but do that which follows from them.\nThus at a banquet, do not discuss how people ought to eat; but\neat as you ought. Remember that Socrates thus entirely avoided\nostentation. Men would come to him desiring to be recommended to\nphilosophers, and he would conduct them thither himselfâ€”so well\ndid he bear being overlooked. Accordingly if any talk concerning\nprinciples should arise among the unlearned, be you for the most\npart silent. For you run great risk of spewing up what you have\nill digested. And when a man tells you that you know nothing and\nyou are not nettled at it, then you may be sure that you have\nbegun the work.",
