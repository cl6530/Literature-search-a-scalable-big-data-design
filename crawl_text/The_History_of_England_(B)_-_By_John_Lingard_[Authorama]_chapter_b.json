        "In the preceding chapter we have followed the fortunes of Charles Stuart,\nfrom his landing in Scotland to his defeat at Worcester and his escape to\nthe continent; we may now look back and direct our attention to some of the\nmore important events which occurred during the same period, in England and\nIreland.",
        "1. The reader is aware that the form of government established in England\nwas an oligarchy. A few individuals, under the cover of a nominal\nparliament, ruled the kingdom with the power of the sword. Could the sense\nof the nation have been collected, there cannot be a doubt that the old\nroyalists of the Cavalier, and the new royalists of the Presbyterian party,\nwould have formed a decided majority; but they were awed into silence and\nsubmission by the presence of a standing army of forty-five thousand men;\nand the maxim that “power gives right” was held out as a sufficient reason\nwhy they should swear fidelity to the commonwealth.[1] This numerous army,",

        "the real source of their security, proved, however, a cause of constant\nsolicitude to the leaders. The pay of the officers and men was always in\narrear; the debentures which they received could be seldom exchanged for\nmoney without a loss of fifty, sixty, or seventy per cent.; and the plea of\nnecessity was accepted as an excuse for the illegal claim of free quarters\nwhich they frequently exercised. To supply their wants, recourse was\ntherefore had to additional taxation, with occasional grants from the\nexcise, and large sales of forfeited property;[1] and, to appease\nthe discontent of the people, promises were repeatedly made, that a\nconsiderable portion of the armed force should be disbanded, and the\npractice of free quarter be abolished. But of these promises, the first\nproved a mere delusion; for, though some partial reductions were made, on\nthe whole the amount of the army continued to increase; the second was\nfulfilled; but in return, the burthen of taxation was augmented; for the\nmonthly assessment on the counties gradually swelled from sixty to ninety,\nto one hundred and twenty, and in conclusion, to one hundred and sixty\nthousand pounds.[2]",
        "Another subject of disquietude sprung out of those principles of liberty\nwhich, even after the suppression of the late mutiny, were secretly\ncherished and occasionally avowed, by the soldiery. Many, indeed, confided\nin the patriotism, and submitted to the judgment, of their officers; but\nthere were also many who condemned the existing government as a desertion\nof the",

By the latter Lilburne\nwas revered as an apostle and a martyr; they read with avidity the\npublications which repeatedly issued from his cell; and they condemned as\npersecutors and tyrants the men who had immured him and his companions in\nthe Tower. Preparations had been made[a] to bring them to trial as the\nauthors of the late mutiny; but, on more mature deliberation, the project\nwas abandoned,[b] and an act was passed making it treason to assert that\nthe government was tyrannical, usurped, or unlawful. No enactments,\nhowever, could check the hostility of Lilburne; and a new pamphlet from his\npen,[c] in vindication of “The Legal Fundamental Liberties of the People,\"\nput to the test the resolution of his opponents. They shrunk from the\nstruggle; it was judged more prudent to forgive, or more dignified to\ndespise, his efforts; and, on his petition for leave to visit his sick\nfamily, he obtained his discharge.[1]",

A new mutiny broke out at Oxford; its speedy suppression\nemboldened the council; the demagogue was reconducted[e] to his cell in the\nTower; and Keble, with forty other commissioners, was appointed[f] to\ntry him for his last offence on the recent statute of treasons.

He subscribed the engagement, and, though he openly explained it\nin a sense conformable to his own principles, yet the parliament made to\nhim out of the forfeited lands of the deans and chapters the grant[b] of\na valuable estate, as a compensation for the cruel treatment which he had\nformerly suffered from the court of the Star-Chamber.[2] Their bounty,\nhowever, wrought no change in his character. He was still the indomitable\ndenouncer of oppression wherever he found it, and before the end of the\nnext year he drew upon himself the vengeance of the men in power, by the\ndistribution[c] of a pamphlet which charged Sir Arthur Hazlerig and the\ncommissioners at Haberdashers’-hall with injustice and tyranny. This by the\nhouse was voted a breach of privilege, and the offender was condemned[d]\nin a fine of seven thousand pounds with banishment for life.

        "The Levellers had boldly avowed their object; the royalists worked in the\ndark and by stealth; yet the council by its vigilance and promptitude\nproved a match for the open hostility of the one and the secret\nmachinations of the other. A doubt may, indeed, be raised of the policy of\nthe “engagement,” a promise of fidelity to the commonwealth without king or\nhouse of lords. As long as it was confined to those who held office under\nthe government, it remained a mere question of choice; but when it was\nexacted from all Englishmen above seventeen years of age, under the penalty\nof incapacity to maintain an action in any court of law, it became to\nnumbers a matter of necessity, and served rather to irritate than\nto produce security.[2] A more efficient measure was the permanent\nestablishment of a high court of justice to inquire into offences against\nthe state, to which was added the organization of a system of espionage by\nCaptain Bishop, under the direction of Scot, a member of the council. The\nfriends of monarchy, encouraged by the clamour of the Levellers and the\nprofessions of the Scots, had begun to hold meetings,",

Then followed an active\ncorrespondence both with Charles soon after his arrival in Scotland, and\nwith the earl of Newcastle, the Lord Hopton, and a council of exiles; first\nat Utrecht, and afterwards at the Hague. By the plan ultimately adopted, it\nwas proposed that Charles himself or Massey, leaving a sufficient force\nto occupy the English army in Scotland, should, with a strong corps of\nCavalry, cross[a] the borders between the kingdoms; that at the same time\nthe royalists in the several associations should rise in arms, and that\nthe exiles in Holland, with five thousand English and German adventurers,\nshould land in Kent, surprise Dover, and hasten to join their Presbyterian\nassociates, in the capital.[1] But, to arrange and insure the co-operation\nof all the parties concerned required the employment of numerous agents, of\nwhom, if several were actuated by principle, many were of doubtful faith\nand desperate fortunes. Some of these betrayed their trust; some undertook\nto serve both parties, and deceived each; and it is a curious fact that,\nwhile the letters of the agents for the royalists often passed through the\nhands of Bishop himself, his secret papers belonging to the council of\nstate were copied and forwarded to the king.[2] This consequence however\nfollowed,",

While the king was on his\nway to Scotland, a number of blank commissions had been seized in the\npossession of Dr. Lewen, a civilian, who suffered[a] the penalty of death.\nSoon afterwards Sir John Gell, Colonel Eusebius Andrews, and Captain\nBenson, were arraigned on the charge of conspiring the destruction of\nthe government established by law. They opposed three objections to the\njurisdiction of the court: it was contrary to Magna Charta, which gave\nto every freeman the right of being tried by his peers; contrary to the\npetition of right, by which courts-martial (and the present court was most\ncertainly a court-martial) had been forbidden; and contrary to the many\ndeclarations of parliament, that the laws, the rights of the people, and\nthe courts of justice, should be maintained. But the court repelled[b] the\nobjections; Andrews and Benson suffered death, and Gell, who had not\nbeen an accomplice, but only cognizant of the plot, was condemned[c] to\nperpetual imprisonment, with the forfeiture of his property.[1]",

But this hope quickly vanished. The resources of the\ncommonwealth were seen to multiply with its wants; and its army in Ireland\nwas daily augmented by recruits in the island, and by reinforcements from\nEngland.

Misfortune had put an end to his\nauthority; his enemies remarked that whether he were a real friend or a\nsecret foe, the cause of the confederates had never prospered under his\nguidance; and the bishops conjured him,[a] now that the very existence of\nthe nation was at stake, to adopt measures which might heal the public\ndissensions and unite all true Irishmen in the common defence. Since\nthe loss of Munster by the defection of Inchiquin’s forces, they had\nentertained an incurable distrust of their English allies; and to appease\ntheir jealousy, he dismissed the few Englishmen who yet remained in the\nservice. Finding them rise in their demands, he called a general assembly\nat Loughrea, announced his intention, or pretended intention, of quitting\nthe kingdom; and then, at the general request, and after some demur,\nconsented to remain. Hitherto the Irish had cherished the expectation that\nthe young monarch would, as he had repeatedly promised, come to Ireland,\nand take the reins of government into his hands; they now, to their\ndisappointment, learned that he had accepted the invitation of the Scots,\ntheir sworn and inveterate enemies. In a short time, the conditions to\nwhich he had subscribed began to transpire; that he had engaged to annul\nthe late pacification between Ormond and the Catholics, and had bound\nhimself by oath,[b] not only not to permit the exercise of the Catholic\nworship, but to root out the Catholic religion wherever it existed in any\nof his dominions.

Without, however, waiting for his answer, they\nproceeded to frame[b] a declaration, in which they charged Ormond with\nnegligence, incapacity, and perfidy; protested that, though they were\ncompelled by the great duty of self-preservation to withdraw from the\ngovernment of the king’s lieutenant, they had no intention to derogate from\nthe royal authority; and pronounced that, in the existing circumstances,\nthe Irish people were no longer bound by the articles of the pacification,\nbut by the oath under which they had formerly associated for their\ncommon protection. To this, the next day[c] they appended a form of\nexcommunication equally affecting all persons who should abet either\nOrmond or Ireton, in opposition to the real interests of the Catholic\nconfederacy.[1]",

In this excited temper of\nmind, the committee appointed by the bishops published both the declaration\nand the excommunication. A single night intervened; their passions had\nleisure to cool; they repented[b] of their precipitancy; and, by the advice\nof the prelates in the town of Galway, they published a third paper,\nsuspending the effect of the other two.",

A second message[c] informed him that it was\ngenuine, but ought to be considered of no force, as far as it concerned\nIreland, because it had been issued without the advice of the Irish privy\ncouncil.[1] This communication encouraged",

They\nmade proposals[b] to the prelates, and received for answer, that protection\nand obedience were correlative; and, therefore, since the king had\npublicly excluded them, under the designation of “bloody rebels,” from\nhis protection, they could not understand how any officer acting by his\nauthority could lay claim to their obedience.[1]",

Wherever he cast\nhis eyes he was appalled by the prospect before him.

He required an acknowledgment, that it was not in\nthe power of any body of men to discharge the people from their obedience\nto the lord deputy, as long as the royal authority was vested in him;\nand at length obtained[d] a declaration to that effect, but with a\nprotestation, that by it “the confederates did not waive their right to the\nfaithful observance of the articles of pacification, nor bind themselves to\nobey every chief governor who might be unduly nominated by the king, during\nhis unfree condition among the Scots.\"[2]",

They\nmaintained that nothing but a general negotiation could put an end to those\nprivate treaties which daily thinned their numbers, and exposed the more\nresolute to inevitable ruin; that the conditions held out were better than\nthey had reason to expect now, infinitely better than they could expect\nhereafter. Let them put the sincerity of their enemies to the test. If\nthe treaty should succeed, the nation would be saved; if it did not, the\nfailure would unite all true Irishmen in the common cause, who, if they\nmust fall, would not fall unrevenged. There was much force in this\nreasoning; and it was strengthened by the testimony of officers from\nseveral quarters, who represented that, to negotiate with the parliament\nwas the only expedient for the preservation of the people. But Clanricard\ntreated the proposal with contempt. To entertain it was an insult to him,\nan act of treason against the king; and he was seconded by the eloquence\nand authority of Castlehaven, who affected to despise the power of the\nenemy, and attributed his success to their own divisions. Had the assembly\nknown the motives which really actuated these noblemen; that they had been\nsecretly instructed by Charles to continue the contest at every risk, as\nthe best means of enabling him to make head against Cromwell; that this,\nprobably the last opportunity of saving the lives",

Some of the officers declared that the parliament must be\ndissolved “one way or other;” but the general checked their indiscretion\nand precipitancy; and the assembly broke up at midnight, with an\nunderstanding that the leading men on each side should resume the subject\nin the morning.[2]",

        "At this eventful moment, big with the most important consequences both to\nhimself and his country, whatever were the workings of Cromwell’s mind, he\nhad the art to conceal them from the eyes of the beholders. Leaving the\nmilitary in the lobby, he entered the house, and composedly seated himself\non one of the outer benches. His dress was a plain suit of black cloth,\nwith grey worsted stockings. For a while he seemed to listen with interest\nto the debate; but, when the speaker was going to put the question, he\nwhispered to Harrison, “This is the time: I must do it;” and rising, put\noff his hat to address the house. At first his language was decorous and\neven laudatory. Gradually he became more warm and animated: at last\nhe assumed all the vehemence of passion, and indulged in personal\nvituperation.

But their time was come; the Lord had disowned\nthem; he had chosen more worthy instruments to perform his work. Here the\norator was interrupted by Sir Peter Wentworth, who declared that he\nnever before heard language so unparliamentary, language, too, the more\noffensive, because it was addressed to them by their own servant, whom they\nhad too fondly cherished, and whom, by their unprecedented bounty, they had\nmade what he was. At these words Cromwell put on his hat, and, springing\nfrom his place, exclaimed, “Come, come, sir, I will put an end to your\nprating.” For a few seconds, apparently in the most violent agitation, he\npaced forward and backward, and then, stamping on the floor, added, “You\nare no parliament. I say you are no parliament: bring them in, bring them\nin.” Instantly the door opened, and Colonel Worseley entered, followed by\nmore than twenty musketeers. “This,” cried Sir Henry Vane, “is not honest.\nIt is against morality and common honesty.” “Sir Henry Vane,” replied\nCromwell, “O Sir Henry Vane! The Lord deliver me from Sir Henry Vane! He\nmight have prevented this. But he is a juggler, and has not common honesty\nhimself.” From Vane he directed his discourse to Whitelock, on whom he\npoured a torrent of abuse; then, pointing to Challoner, “There,” he\ncried, “sits a drunkard;” next, to Marten and Wentworth, “There are two\nwhoremasters:” and afterwards, selecting different members in succession,\ndescribed them as dishonest and corrupt livers, a shame and a scandal to\nthe profession of the gospel. Suddenly, however, checking himself, he\nturned to the guard, and ordered them to clear the house. At these words\nColonel Harrison took the speaker by the hand, and led him from the chair;\nAlgernon Sidney was next compelled to quit his seat; and the other members,\neighty in number, on the approach of the military, rose and moved towards\nthe door. Cromwell now resumed his discourse. “It is you,” he exclaimed,\n\"that have forced me to do this. I have sought the Lord both day and night,\nthat he would rather slay me, than put me on the doing of this work.\"\nAlderman Allen took advantage of these words to observe, that it was not\nyet too late to undo what had been done; but Cromwell instantly charged him\nwith peculation, and gave him into custody. When all were gone, fixing his\neye on the mace, “What,” said he, “shall we do with this fool’s bauble?\nHere, carry it away.” Then, taking the act of dissolution from the clerk,\nhe ordered the doors to be locked, and, accompanied by the military,\nreturned to Whitehall.",
        "That afternoon the members of the council assembled in their usual place of\nmeeting. Bradshaw had just taken the chair, when the lord-general entered,\nand told them, that if they were there as private individuals, they\nwere welcome; but, if as the council of state, they must know that the\nparliament was dissolved, and with it also the council. “Sir,” replied\nBradshaw, with the spirit of an ancient Roman, “we have heard what you did\nat the house this morning, and before many hours all England will know it.\nBut, sir, you are mistaken to think that the parliament is dissolved. No\npower under heaven can dissolve them but themselves. Therefore take you\nnotice of that.” After this protest they withdrew.[1]",

It fell without a\nstruggle or a groan, unpitied and unregretted. The members slunk away to\ntheir homes, where they sought by submission to purchase the forbearance\nof their new master; and their partisans, if partisans they had, reserved\nthemselves in silence for a day of retribution, which came not before\nCromwell slept in his grave. The royalists congratulated each other on an\nevent which they deemed a preparatory step to the restoration of the king;\nthe army and navy, in numerous addresses, declared that they would live or\ndie, stand or fall, with the lord-general, and in every part of the country\nthe congregations of the saints magnified the arm of the Lord which had\nbroken the mighty, that in lieu of the sway of mortal men, “the fifth\nmonarchy, the reign of Christ, might be established upon earth.\"[2]",

To this\nhabit of procrastination was perhaps owing the extinction of its authority.\nIt disappointed the hopes of the country, and supplied Cromwell with the\nmost plausible argument in defence of his conduct.",

But\nin dissolving the late parliament he had deviated from this his ordinary\ncourse: he had been compelled to come boldly forward by the obstinacy or\nthe policy of his opponents, who during twelve months had triumphed over\nhis intrigues, and were preparing to pass an act which would place new\nobstacles in his path. Now, however, that he had forcibly taken into his\nown hands the reins of government, it remained for him to determine whether\nhe should retain them in his grasp, or deliver them over to others. He\npreferred the latter for the maturity of time was not yet come: he saw\nthat, among the officers who blindly submitted to be the tools of his\nambition, there were several who would abandon the idol of their worship,\nwhenever they should suspect him of a design to subvert the public liberty.\nBut if he parted with power for the moment, it was in such manner as to\nwarrant the hope that it would shortly return to him under another form,\nnot as won by the sword of the military, but as deposited in his hands by\nthe judgment of parliament.",

Their first measure was to publish a Vindication of their\nProceedings.[1] The long parliament they pronounced[a] incapable “of\nanswering those ends which God, his people, and the whole nation,\nexpected.” Had it been permitted to sit a day longer, it would “at one blow\nhave laid in the dust the interest of all honest men and of their glorious\ncause.” In its place the council of war would “call to the government\npersons of approved fidelity and honesty;” and therefore required “public\nofficers and ministers to proceed in their respective places,” and conjured\n\"those who feared and loved the name of the Lord, to be instant with him\nday and night in their behalf.\"[2]",

They invited\nhim with four of his officers to sit as a member among them; and they made\nhim the offer of the palace of Hampton Court in exchange for his house of\nNewhall.

Receiving no answer,\nhe came[a] over at his own risk,–a bold but imprudent step; for what\nindulgence could he expect from that powerful adventurer, whom he had so\noften denounced to the nation as “a thief, a robber, an usurper, and a\nmurderer?” On the day after his arrival in the capital he was committed to\nNewgate.

Lilburne petitioned the new parliament; his\nwife petitioned; his friends from the neighbouring counties petitioned;\nthe apprentices in London did not only petition, they threatened.

But he would not permit them to\nsit, and yet disown the authority by which they sat. For this purpose\nhe had prepared a recognition which he required them to sign. Those who\nrefused would be excluded the house; the rest would find admission, and\nmight exercise their legislative power without control, for his negative\nremained in force no longer than twenty days.

        "About this time an extraordinary accident occurred. Among the presents\nwhich Cromwell had received from foreign princes, were six Friesland\ncoach-horses from the duke of Oldenburg. One day,[a] after he had dined\nwith Thurloe under the shade in the park, the fancy took him to try the\nmettle of the horses. The secretary was compelled to enter the carriage;\nthe protector, forgetful of his station, mounted the box. The horses at\nfirst appeared obedient to the hand of the new coachman; but the too\nfrequent application of the lash drove them into a gallop, and the\nprotector was suddenly precipitated from his seat. At first, he lay\nsuspended by the pole with his leg entangled in the harness; and the\nexplosion of a loaded pistol in one of his pockets added to the fright and\nthe rapidity of the horses; but a fortunate jerk extricated his foot from\nhis shoe, and he fell under the body of the carriage without meeting with\ninjury from the wheels. He was immediately taken up by his guards, who\nfollowed at full speed, and conveyed to Whitehall; Thurloe leaped from the\ndoor of the carriage, and escaped with a sprained ancle and some severe\nbruises.

This bold step subdued the\nreluctance of the protector. He abandoned the lofty hopes to which he had\nso long, so pertinaciously clung, despatched Fleetwood to the house to\nprevent a debate, and shortly afterwards summoned the members to meet him\nat Whitehall. Addressing them with more than his usual embarrassment, he\nsaid, that neither his own reflections nor the reasoning of the committee\nhad convinced him that he ought to accept the title of king. If he were to\naccept it, it would be doubtingly; if he did it doubtingly, it would not be\nof faith; and if it were not of faith, it would be a sin. “Wherefore,” he\nconcluded, “I cannot undertake this government with that title of king, and\nthis is mine answer to this great and weighty business.\"[1]",

As soon as the oath\nhad been administered, Manton, his chaplain, pronounced a long and fervent\nprayer for a blessing on the protector, the parliament, and the people.\nRising from prayer, Cromwell seated himself in a chair: on the right, at\nsome distance, sat the French, on the left, the Dutch ambassador; on one\nside stood the earl of Warwick with the sword of the commonwealth, on\nthe other, the lord mayor, with that of the city; and behind arranged\nthemselves the members of the protector’s family, the lords of the council,\nand Lisle, Whitelock, and Montague, each of the three bearing a drawn\nsword.

The two houses\nof parliament were restored; but, as if it were meant to allude to his\npast conduct, he was bound to leave to the House of Commons the right of\nexamining the qualifications and determining the claims of the several\nrepresentatives. To him was given the power of nominating the members of\nthe “other house” (he dared not yet term it the House of Lords); but, in\nthe first instance, the persons so nominated were to be approved by the\nhouse of representatives, and afterwards by the other house itself. The\nprivilege of voting by proxy was abolished, and the right of judicature\nrestrained within reasonable limits. In the appointment of councillors,\nthe great officers of state, and the commanders of the forces, many of the\nrestrictions sought to be introduced by the long parliament were enforced.\nIn point of religion, it was enacted that a confession of faith should be\nagreed upon between the protector and the two houses; but that dissenters\nfrom it should enjoy liberty of conscience, and the free exercise of their\nworship, unless they should reject the mystery of the Trinity, or the\ninspiration of the Scriptures, or profess prelatic, or popish, or\nblasphemous doctrines. The yearly revenue was fixed at one million three\nhundred thousand pounds, of which no part was to be raised by a land-tax;\nand of this sum one million was devoted to the support of the army and\nnavy, and three hundred thousand pounds to the expenses of the civil list;\nbut, on the remonstrance of the protector, that with so small a revenue it\nwould be impossible to continue the war, an additional grant of six\nhundred thousand pounds was voted for the three following years.

Was it to be borne that\nthe children should assume the superiority over their parents; that the\nnominees of the protector should control the representatives of the people,\nthe depositaries of the supreme power of the nation? It was answered\nthat the protector had called them lords; that it was the object of “the\npetition and advice” to re-establish the “second estate;” and that, if any\ndoubt remained, it were best to amend the “instrument” by giving to the\nmembers of the other house the title of lords, and to the protector that\nof king.[a] Cromwell sought to soothe these angry spirits. He read to them\nlectures on the benefit, the necessity, of unanimity. Let them look abroad.\nThe papists threatened to swallow up all the Protestants of Europe. England\nwas the only stay, the last hope of religion.

Stapeley, who, to save\nhis own life, swore against him, proved an unwilling witness; and Mallory,\nwho was to have supported the evidence of Stapeley, had four days before\nbeen bribed to abscond. This deficiency was gladly laid hold of by the\nmajority of the judges, who gave their opinion[a] that his guilt was not\nproved; and, for similar reasons, some days later acquitted two other\nconspirators, Sir Humphrey Bennet and Captain Woodcock. The fact is, they\nwere weary of an office which exposed them to the censure of the public;\nfor the court was viewed with hatred by the people. It abolished the trial\nby jury; it admitted no inquest or presentment by the oaths of good and\nfaithful men; it deprived the accused of the benefit of challenge; and its\nproceedings were contrary to the law of treason, the petition of right, and\nthe very oath of government taken by the protector.

By the Spaniards the intelligence\nwas received with surprise and apprehension. Deceived by false information,\nthey had employed all their efforts to provide for the safety of Cambray.\nThe repeated warnings given by Charles had been neglected; the extensive\nworks at Dunkirk remained in an unfinished state; and the defence of the\nplace had been left to its ordinary garrison of no more than one thousand\nmen, and these but scantily supplied with stores and provisions. To repair\nhis error, Don Juan, with the consent of his mentor, the Marquess Caracena,\nresolved to hazard a battle; and, collecting a force of six thousand\ninfantry and four thousand cavalry, encamped between the village of Zudcote\nand the lines of the besiegers. But Turenne, aware of the defective\norganization of the Spanish armies, resolved to prevent the threatened\nattack; and the very next morning, before the Spanish cannon and ammunition\nhad reached the camp, the allied force was seen advancing in battle array.\nDon Juan hastily placed his men along a ridge of sand-hills which extended\nfrom the sea coast to the canal, giving the command of the right wing to\nthe duke of York, of the left to the prince of Condé, and reserving\nthe centre to himself. The battle was begun by the English, who found\nthemselves opposed to their countryman, the duke of York. They were led\nby Major-General Morgan; for Lockhart, who acted both as ambassador and\ncommander-in-chief, was confined by indisposition to his carriage. Their\nardour to distinguish themselves in the presence of the two rival nations\ncarried them considerably in advance of their allies; but, having halted\nto gain breath at the foot of the opposite sand-hill, they mounted with\nimpetuosity, received the fire of the enemy, and, at the point of the pike,\ndrove them from their position. The duke immediately charged at the head\nof the Spanish cavalry; but one half of his men were mowed down by a\nwell-directed fire of musketry; and James himself owed the preservation of\nhis life to the temper of his armour. The advantage, however, was dearly\npurchased: in Lockhart’s regiment scarcely an officer remained to take the\ncommand.",

The centre was never engaged; for the regiment, on its\nextreme left, seeing itself flanked by the French in pursuit of Condé,\nprecipitately abandoned its position, and the example was successively\nimitated by the whole line. But, in the meanwhile, the duke of York had\nrallied his broken infantry, and while they faced the English, he charged\nthe latter in flank at the head of his company of horse-guards. Though\nthrown into disorder, they continued to fight, employing the butt-ends of\ntheir muskets against the swords of their adversaries, and in a few minutes\nseveral squadrons of French cavalry arrived to their aid. James was\nsurrounded; and, in despair of saving himself by flight, he boldly assumed\nthe character of a French officer; rode at the head of twenty troopers\ntoward the right of their army; and, carefully threading the different\ncorps, arrived without exciting suspicion at the bank of the canal, by\nwhich he speedily effected his escape to Furnes.[1] The victory on the part\nof the allies was complete. The Spanish cavalry made no effort to protect\nthe retreat of their infantry; every regiment of which was successively\nsurrounded by the pursuers, and compelled to surrender. By Turenne and his\nofficers the chief merit of this brilliant success was cheerfully allotted\nto the courage and steadiness of the English regiments; at Whitehall it was\nattributed to the prayers of the lord-protector, who, on that very day,\nobserved with his council a solemn fast to implore the blessing of heaven\non the operations of the allied army.[2]",

Though the last parliament had made\nprovision, ample provision, as it was then thought, for the splendour of\nhis establishment, and for all the charges of the war, he had already\ncontracted enormous debts; his exchequer was frequently drained to the last\nshilling; and his ministers were compelled to go a-begging–such is the\nexpression of the secretary of state–for the temporary loan of a few\nthousand pounds, with the cheerless anticipation of a refusal.[1] He\nlooked on the army, the greater part of which he had quartered in the\nneighbourhood of the metropolis, as his chief–his only support against his\nenemies; and while the soldiers were comfortably clothed and fed, he might\nwith confidence rely on their attachment; but now that their pay was in\narrear, he had reason to apprehend that discontent might induce them to\nlisten to the suggestions of those officers who sought to subvert his\npower. On former occasions, indeed, he had relieved himself from similar\nembarrassments by the imposition of taxes by his own authority; but this\npractice was so strongly reprobated in the petition and advice, and he had\nrecently abjured it with so much solemnity, that he dared not repeat\nthe experiment. He attempted to raise a loan among the merchants and\ncapitalists in the city; but his credit and popularity were gone; he had,\nby plunging into",

The application\nwas eluded by a demand of security on the landed property belonging to\ncountry gentlemen. There remained a third expedient,–an application to\nparliament. But Cromwell, like the first Charles, had learned to dread\nthe very name of a parliament. Three of these assemblies he had moulded\naccording to his own plan, and yet not one of them could he render\nobsequious to his will. Urged, however, by the ceaseless importunities of\nThurloe, he appointed[a] nine councillors to inquire into the means of\ndefeating the intrigues of the republicans in a future parliament; the\nmanner of raising a permanent revenue from the estates of the royalists;\nand the best method of determining the succession to the protectorate. But\namong the nine were two who, aware of his increasing infirmities, began to\ncherish projects of their own aggrandizement, and who, therefore, made it\ntheir care to perplex and to prolong the deliberations. The committee sat\nthree weeks. On the two first questions they came to no conclusion; with\nrespect to the third, they voted, on a division, that the choice between\nan elective and an hereditary succession was a matter of indifference.\nSuspicious of their motives, Cromwell dissolved[b] the committee.[2] But he\nsubstituted no",

On this selection Henry Cromwell observes: “The wise men\nwere but seven; it seems you have made them nine. And having heard their\nnames, I think myself better able to guess what they’ll do than a much\nwiser man; for no very wise man can ever imagine it” (p. 217).]",

It is certainly extraordinary that, while so many\nconspiracies are said to have been formed, no attempt was actually made\nagainst his person; but the fact that such designs had existed, and the\nknowledge that his death was of the first importance to his enemies,\nconvinced him that he could never be secure from danger.

It might have been expected that a man of his\nreligious disposition would have felt some compunctious visitings, when\nfrom the bed of death he looked back on the strange eventful career of his\npast life. But he had adopted a doctrine admirably calculated to lull and\ntranquillize the misgivings of conscience. “Tell me,” said he to Sterry,\none of his chaplains, “Is it possible to fall from grace?” “It is not\npossible,” replied the minister. “Then,” exclaimed the dying man, “I am\nsafe; for I know that I was once in grace.” Under this impression he\nprayed, not for himself, but for God’s people. “Lord,” he said, “though a\nmiserable and wretched creature, I am in covenant with thee through thy\ngrace, and may and will come to thee for thy people. Thou hast made me a\nmean instrument to do them some good, and thee service. Many of them set\ntoo high a value upon me, though others would be glad of my death.

It was his fortunate day, the 3rd of September, a\ncircumstance from which his sorrowing relatives derived a new source\nof consolation. It was, they observed, on the 3rd of September that he\novercame the Scots at Dunbar; on that day, he also overcame the royalists\nat Worcester; and on the same day, he was destined to overcome his\nspiritual enemies, and to receive the crown of victory in heaven.\nAbout four in the afternoon he breathed his last, amidst the tears and\nlamentations of his attendants. “Cease to weep,” exclaimed the fanatical\nSterry, “you have more reason to rejoice.

The object of this\narrangement was plain: to make void the declaration of the military, to\nweed out men of doubtful fidelity, and to render the others dependent\nfor their situations on the pleasure of the house.

The house, to gratify the soldiers, had advanced their daily\npay; and with the view of discharging their arrears, had raised[c] the\nmonthly assessment from thirty-five thousand pounds to one hundred thousand\npounds.[2] But the military leaders were not to be diverted from their\npurpose. Meetings were daily and nightly held at Wallingford House; and\nanother petition with two hundred and thirty signatures was presented by\nDesborough, accompanied by all the field-officers in the metropolis; In\nmost points it was similar to the former; but it contained a demand that,\nwhosoever should afterwards “groundlessly and causelessly inform the house\nagainst their servants, thereby creating jealousies, and casting scandalous\nimputations upon them, should be",

Three regiments, through the medium of their officers, had already\nmade the tender of their services for the protection of the house; Monk,\nfrom Scotland, and Ludlow, from Ireland, wrote that their respective armies\nwere animated with similar sentiments; and a vote was passed and ordered\nto be published,[a] declaring it to be treason to levy money on the people\nwithout the previous consent of parliament, a measure which, as all the\nexisting taxes were to expire on the first day of the ensuing year, made\nthe military dependent for their future subsistence on the pleasure of\nthe party. Hazlerig, thus fortified, deemed himself a match for his\nadversaries; the next morning he boldly threw down the gauntlet;[b] by one\nvote, Lambert, Desborough, six colonels, and one major, were deprived of\ntheir Commissions for having subscribed the copy of the petition sent to\nColonel Okey; and, by a second, Fleetwood was dismissed from his office\nof commander-in-chief, and made president of a board of seven members\nestablished for the government of the army.

He then marched to Westminster. Meeting the speaker,\nwho was attended by his guard, he ordered the officer on duty to dismount,\ngave the command to Major Creed, one of those who had been deprived of\ntheir commissions by the preceding vote, and scornfully directed him to\nconduct the “lord-general” to Whitehall, whence he was permitted to return\nto his own house. In Westminster, the two parties faced each other; but the\nardour of the privates did not correspond with that of the leaders; and,\nhaving so often fought in the same ranks, they showed no disposition to\nimbrue their hands in each other’s blood. In the mean time the council\nof state assembled: on the one side Lambert and Desborough, on the other\nHazlerig and Morley, appeared to support their pretensions; much time\nwas spent in complaint and recrimination, much in hopeless attempts to\nreconcile the parties; but the cause of the military continued to make\nconverts; the advocates of the “rump,” aware that to resist was fruitless,\nconsented to yield; and it was stipulated that the house should cease to\nsit, that the council of officers should provide for the public peace,\narrange a new form of government, and submit it to the approbation of a new\nparliament. An order, that the forces on both sides should retire to their\nrespective quarters, was gladly obeyed; the men mixed together as friends\nand brothers, and reciprocally promised never more to draw the sword\nagainst each other.[1]",

        "Of all the changes which had surprised and perplexed the nation since\nthe death of the last king, none had been received with such general\ndisapprobation as the present. It was not that men lamented the removal of\nthe Rump; but they feared the capricious and arbitrary rule of the army;\nand, when they contrasted their unsettled state with the tranquillity\nformerly enjoyed under the monarchy, many were not backward in the\nexpression of their wishes for the restoration of the ancient line of their\nprinces. The royalists laboured to improve this favourable disposition; yet\ntheir efforts might have been fruitless, had the military been united among\nthemselves. But among the officers there were several who had already made\ntheir peace with Charles by the promise of their services, and many\nwho secretly retained a strong attachment to Hazlerig and his party in\nopposition to Lambert. In Ireland, Barrow, who had been sent as their\nrepresentative from Wallingford House, found the army so divided and\nwavering, that each faction alternately obtained a short and precarious\nsuperiority; and in Scotland, Cobbet, who arrived there on a similar\nmission, was, with seventeen other officers who approved of his proposals,\nimprisoned by order of Monk.[1]",
        "From this moment the conduct of Monk will claim a considerable share of the\nreader’s attention. Ever since the march of Cromwell in pursuit of the king\nto Worcester he had commanded in Scotland; where, instead of concerning\nhimself with the intrigues and parties in England, he appeared to have no\nother occupation",

His despatches to Cromwell from\nScotland form a striking contrast with those from the other officers of the\ntime. There is in them no parade of piety, no flattery of the protector, no\nsolicitation for favours. They are short, dry, and uninteresting, confined\nentirely to matters of business, and those only of indispensable necessity.\nIn effect, the distinctive characteristic of the man was an impenetrable\nsecrecy.[1] Whatever were his predilections or opinions, his wishes or\ndesigns, he kept them locked up within his own breast. He had no confidant,\nnor did he ever permit himself to be surprised into an unguarded avowal.\nHence all parties, royalists, protectorists, and republicans, claimed him\nfor their own, though that claim was grounded on their hopes, not on\nhis conduct. Charles had been induced to make to him repeatedly the most\ntempting offers, which were supported by the solicitations of his wife and\nhis domestic chaplain; Monk listened to them without displeasure, though he\nnever unbosomed himself to the agents or to his chaplain so far as to put\nhimself in their power. Cromwell had obtained some information of these\nintrigues; but, unable to discover any real ground of suspicion, he\ncontented himself with putting Monk on his guard by a bantering postscript\nto one of his letters. “Tis said,” he added, “there is a cunning fellow in\nScotland,",

To\nundermine his power, Fleetwood ordered two regiments of horse attached\nto the Scottish army to return to England; and the republicans, when the\nmilitary commissions were issued by the speaker, removed a great number of\nhis officers, and supplied their places with creatures of their own. Monk\nfelt these affronts: discontent urged him to seek revenge; and, when he\nunderstood that Booth was at the head of a considerable force, he dictated\na letter to the speaker, complaining of the proceedings of parliament, and\ndeclaring that, as they had abandoned the real principles of the old cause,\nthey must not expect the support of his army. His object was to animate the\ninsurgents and embarrass their adversaries; but, on the very morning\non which the letter was to be submitted for signature to his principal\nofficers, the news of Lambert’s victory arrived;[a] the dangerous\ninstrument was instantly destroyed, and the secret most religiously kept by\nthe few who had been privy to the intention of the general.[2]",
        "To this abortive attempt Monk, notwithstanding his wariness, had been\nstimulated by his brother, a clergyman of Cornwall, who visited him with a\nmessage from Sir John Grenville by commission from Charles Stuart.\nAfter the failure of Booth, the general dismissed him with a letter of\ncongratulation to the parliament, but without any answer to Grenville, and\nunder an oath to keep secret whatever he had learnt",

At\nLeith was held a general council of officers; they approved of his object,\nengaged to stand by him, and announced their determination, by letters\ndirected to Lenthall, the speaker, to the council at Wallingford House, and\nto the commanders of the fleet in the Downs, and of the army in Ireland.\nIt excited, however, no small surprise, that the general, while he thus\nprofessed to espouse the defence of the parliament, cashiered all the\nofficers introduced by the parliament into his army, and restored all\nthose who had been expelled.

        "Monk soon discovered that he was embarked in a most hazardous undertaking.\nThe answers to his letters disapproved of his conduct; and the knowledge of\nthese answers kindled among his followers a spirit of disaffection which\nled to numerous desertions. From the general of an army obedient to his\ncommands, he had dwindled into the leader of a volunteer force, which it\nwas necessary to coax and persuade. Two councils were formed, one of\nthe colonels of the longest standing, the other of all the commissioned\nofficers. The first perused the public despatches received by the general,\nand wrote the answers, which were signed by him as the chairman; the other\nwas consulted on all measures respecting the conduct of the army, and\nconfirmed or rejected the opinion of the colonels by the majority of\nvoices. But if Monk was controlled by this arrangement, it served to screen\nhim from suspicion. The measures adopted were taken as the result of the\ngeneral will.",
        "To the men at Wallingford House it became of the first importance to win\nby intimidation, or to reduce by force, this formidable opponent. Lambert\nmarched against him from London at the head of seven thousand men; but the\nmind of the major-general was distracted by doubts and suspicions; and,\nbefore his departure, he exacted a solemn promise from Fleetwood to agree\nto no accommodation, either with the king, or with Hazlerig, till he had\npreviously received the advice and concurrence of Lambert himself.[1] To\nMonk delay was as necessary as expedition was desirable to his opponents.\nIn point of numbers and experience the force under his command was no\nmatch for that led by Lambert, but his magazines and treasury were amply\nsupplied, while his adversary possessed not money enough to keep his army\ntogether for more than a few weeks. Before the major-general reached\nNewcastle, he met three deputies from Monk on their way to treat with the\ncouncil in the capital. As no arguments could induce them to open the\nnegotiation with him, he allowed them to proceed, and impatiently awaited\nthe result. After much discussion, an agreement was concluded in London;\nbut Monk, instead of ratifying it with his signature, discovered,[a]\nor pretended to discover, in it much that was obscure or ambiguous, or\ncontrary to the instructions received by the deputies; his council agreed\nwith him in opinion; and a second negotiation was opened with Lambert at\nNewcastle, to obtain from him an explanation of the meaning of the officers\nin the metropolis. Thus delay was added to delay; and Monk improved the\ntime to dismiss even the privates whose sentiments were suspected, and to\nfill up the vacancies in the regiments of infantry by levies among the\nScots. At the same time he called a convention of the Scottish estates at\nBerwick, of two representatives from each county and one from each borough,\nrecommended to them the peace of the country during his absence, and\nobtained from them the grant of a year’s arrears of their taxes, amounting\nto sixty thousand pounds, in",

Within\nthe city several encounters had taken place between the military and the\napprentices;[2] a free parliament had become the general cry; and the\ncitizens exhorted each other to pay no taxes imposed by any other\nauthority. Lawson, though he wavered at first, declared against the army,\nand advanced with his squadron up the river as far as Gravesend. Hazlerig\nand Morley were admitted into Portsmouth by the governor, were joined by\nthe force sent against them by Fleetwood, and marched towards London, that\nthey might open a communication with the fleet in the river. Alarm produced\nin the committee of safety the most contradictory councils. A voice\nventured to suggest the restoration of Charles Stuart; but it was replied\nthat their offences against the family of Stuart were of too black a dye to\nbe forgiven; that the king might be lavish of promises now that he stood in\nneed of their services; but that the vengeance of parliament would absolve\nhim from the obligation, when the monarchy should once be established.

This contumacy, in the opinion of the parliamentary\nleaders, called for prompt and exemplary punishment; and it was artfully\nsuggested that, by making Monk the minister of their vengeance, they\nwould open a wide breach between him and their opponents. Two hours after\nmidnight he received[a] an order to march into the city, to arrest eleven\nof the principal citizens, to remove the posts and chains which had lately\nbeen fixed in the streets, and to destroy the portcullises and the gates.\nAfter a moment’s hesitation, he resolved to obey, rather than hazard the\nloss of his commission.

The soldiers loudly proclaimed\ntheir discontent: the general, mortified and ashamed, though he had been\ninstructed to quarter them in the city, led them back to Whitehall.[2]\nThere, on the review of these proceedings, he thought that he discovered\nproofs of a design, first to commit him with the citizens, and then to\ndiscard him entirely.

This is\nall, and the very bottom of what we might have possibly entrusted unto the\nsaid earl of Glamorgan in this affair.\"–Carte’s Ormond, iii. 446. How this\ndeclaration is to be reconciled with the last, I know not.",
        "With this letter to the council he sent two others. One was addressed\nto Ormond, asserting on the word of a Christian that he never intended\nGlamorgan to treat of any thing without Ormond’s knowledge and approbation,\nas he was always diffident of the earl’s judgment, but at the same time\ncommanding him to suspend the execution of any sentence which might be\npronounced against that nobleman.–Carte, ii. App. p. 12. The second, dated\nFeb. 3, was to Glamorgan himself, in these words:–",
        "“Glamorgan,",
        "I must clearly tell you, both you and I have been abused in this business;\nfor you have been drawn to consent to conditions much beyond your\ninstructions, and your treaty had been divulged to all the world. If you\nhad advised with my lord lieutenant, as you promised me, all this had been\nhelped. But we must look forward. Wherefore, in a word, I have commanded\nas much favour to be shewn to you as may possibly stand with my service or\nsafety; and if you will yet trust my advice–which I have commanded Digby\nto give you freely–I will bring you so off that you may still be useful\nto me, and I shall be able to recompence you for your affection; if not,\nI cannot tell what to say.

        "In this letter Charles, in his own defence, pretends to blame Glamorgan;\nprobably as a blind to Ormond and Digby, through whom it was sent. Soon\nafterwards, on February 28th, he despatched Sir J. Winter to him with full\ninstructions, and the following consolatory epistle:–",
        "“Herbert,",

        "If after the perusal of these documents any doubt can remain of the\nauthenticity of Glamorgan’s commission, it must be done away by the\nfollowing passage from Clarendon’s correspondence with secretary Nicholas.\nSpeaking of his intended history, he says, “I must tell you, I care not how\nlittle I say in that business of Ireland, since those strange powers and\ninstructions given to your favourite Glamorgan, which appears to me so\ninexcusable to justice, piety, and prudence. And I fear there is very much\nin that transaction of Ireland, both before and since, that you and I were\nnever thought wise enough to be advised with in. Oh, Mr. Secretary, those\nstratagems have given me more sad hours than all the misfortunes in war\nwhich have befallen the king, and look like the effects of God’s anger\ntowards us.\"–Clarendon Papers, ii. 337.",
        "It appears that the king, even after he had been delivered by the Scots\nto the parliament, still hoped to derive benefit from the exertions of\nGlamorgan. About the beginning of June, 1647, Sir John Somerset, the\nbrother of that nobleman, arrived in Rome with a letter from Charles to\nInnocent X. The letter is not probably in existence; but the answer of the\npontiff shows that the king had solicited pecuniary assistance, and, as an\ninducement, had held out some hint of a disposition on his part to admit\nthe papal supremacy and the Catholic creed. Less than this cannot be\ninferred from the language of Innocent. Literae illae praecipuam tuam\nalacritatem ac propensionem ad obediendum Deo in nobis, qui ejus vices\ngerimus, luculenter declarant ... a majestate tua enixe poscimus, ut\nquod velle coepit, mox et facto perficiat ... ut aliquo id aggrediaris\nargumento, quo te te ad Catholicam fidem recepisse intelligamus.\nUndoubtedly Charles was making the same experiment with the pontiff which\nhe had just made with his Presbyterian subjects; and as, to propitiate\nthem, he had undertaken to study the Presbyterian doctrines, so he hoped\nto draw money from Innocent by professing an inclination in favour of\nthe Catholic creed. But the attempt failed. The answer was, indeed,\ncomplimentary: it expressed the joy of the pontiff at the perusal of his\nletter, and exhorted him to persevere in the inquiry till he should come to\nthe discovery of the truth; but it disposed of his request, as Urban\nhad previously disposed of a similar request, by stating that it was\ninconsistent with the duty of the pope to spend the treasures of his church\nin the support of any but Catholic princes. This answer is dated 29th June,\n1647.",
        "NOTE B, p. 136.",
        "1. The ordinances had distinguished two classes of delinquents, the one\nreligious, the other political. The first comprised all Catholic recusants,\nall persons whomsoever, who, having attained the age of twenty-one, should\nrefuse to abjure upon oath the doctrines peculiar to the Catholic creed.\nThese were reputed papists, and had been made to forfeit two-thirds of\ntheir real and personal estates, which were seized for the benefit of the\nkingdom by the commissioners of sequestration appointed in each particular\ncounty. The second comprehended all persons who were known to have fought\nagainst the parliament, or to have aided the royal party with money, men,\nprovisions, advice, or information; and of these the whole estates, both\nreal and personal, had been sequestrated, with the sole exception of\none-fifth allotted for the support of their wives and children, if the\nlatter were educated in the Protestant religion.–Elsynge’s Ordinances. 3,\n22, et seq.",
        "2. These sequestrated estates not only furnished a yearly income, but also\na ready supply on every sudden emergency. Thus when Colonel Harvey refused\nto march till his regiment had received the arrears of its pay, amounting\nto three thousand pounds, an ordinance was immediately passed to raise\nthe money by the sale of woods belonging to Lord Petre, in the county of\nEssex.–Journals, vi, 519. When a complaint was made of a scarcity of\ntimber for the repairs of the navy, the two houses authorized certain\nshipwrights to fell two thousand five hundred oak trees on the estates\nof delinquents in Kent and Essex.–Ibid, 520. When the Scots demanded a\nmonth’s pay for their army, the committee at Goldsmiths’ Hall procured the\nmoney by offering for sale such property of delinquents as they judged\nexpedient, the lands at eight, the houses at six years’ purchase.–Journals\nof Commons, June 10, 24, 1644.",
        "3. But the difficulty of procuring ready money by sales induced the\ncommissioners to look out for some other expedient; and when the sum of\nfifteen thousand pounds was wanted to put the army of Fairfax in motion,\nit was raised without delay by offering to delinquents the restoration\nof their sequestrated estates, on the immediate payment of a certain\nfine.–Commons’ Journals, Sept. 13, 1644. The success of this experiment\nencouraged them to hold out a similar indulgence to such persons as were\nwilling to quit the royal party, provided they were not Catholics, and\nwould take the oath of abjuration of the Catholic doctrine.–Ibid. March\n6, August 12, 1645; May 4, June 26, Sept. 3, 1646. Afterwards, on the\ntermination of the war, the great majority of the royalists were admitted\nto make their compositions with the committee. Of the fines required, the\ngreater number amounted to one-tenth, many to one-sixth, and a few\nto one-third of the whole property, both real and personal, of the\ndelinquents.–(See the Journals of both houses for the years 1647, 1648.)",
        "NOTE C, p. 241.",
        "On the day after the king’s execution appeared a work, entitled [Greek:\nEIKON BASILIKAe], or the Portraicture of his Sacred Majesty in “his\nSolitude and Sufferings.” It professed to be written by Charles himself;\na faithful exposition of his own thoughts on the principal events of his\nreign, accompanied with such pious effusions as the recollection suggested\nto his mind. It was calculated to create a deep sensation in favour of the\nroyal sufferer, and is said to have passed through fifty editions in the\ncourse of the first year. During the commonwealth, Milton made a feeble\nattempt to disprove the king’s claim to the composition of the book: after\nthe restoration, Dr. Gauden, a clergyman of Bocking, in Essex, came forward\nand declared himself the real author. But he advanced his pretensions with\nsecrecy, and received as the price of his silence, first the bishopric of\nExeter, and afterwards, when he complained of the poverty of that see, the\nricher bishopric of Worcester.",
        "After the death of Gauden his pretensions began to transpire, and became\nthe subject of an interesting controversy between his friends and the\nadmirers of Charles. But many documents have been published since, which\nwere then unknown, particularly the letters of",
        "Gauden to the earl of Clarendon (Clarendon Papers, iii. App. xxvi.-xxxi.,\nxcv.), and others from him to the earl of Bristol (Maty’s Review, ii. 253.\nClarendon Papers, iii. App. xcvi.; and Mr. Todd, Memoirs of Bishop Walton,\ni. 138). These have so firmly established Gauden’s claim, that, whoever\ndenies it must be prepared to pronounce that prelate an impostor, to\nbelieve that the bishops Morley and Duppa gave false evidence in his\nfavour, and, to explain how it happened, that those, the most interested to\nmaintain the right of the king, namely Charles II., his brother the duke of\nYork, and the two earls of Clarendon and Bristol, yielded to the deception.\nThese difficulties, however, have not appalled Dr. Wordsworth, who in\na recent publication of more than four hundred pages, entitled, “Who\nwrote[Greek: EIKON BASILIKAe]” has collected with patient industry every\nparticle of evidence which can bear upon the subject; and after a most\nminute and laborious investigation, has concluded by adjudging the work\nto the king, and pronouncing the bishop an impudent impostor. Still my\nincredulity is not subdued. There is much in the[Greek: EIKON BASILIKAe]\nitself which forbids me to believe that Charles was the real author, though\nthe latter, whoever he were, may have occasionally consulted and copied the\nroyal papers; and the claim of Gauden appears too firmly established to be\nshaken by the imperfect and conjectural improbabilities which have hitherto\nbeen produced against it.",
        "NOTE D, p. 276.",
        "The Massacres at Drogheda and Wexford.",
        "I. Drogheda was taken by storm on the 11th of September, 1649. Cromwell, on\nhis return to Dublin, despatched two official accounts of his success, one\nto Bradshaw, president of the council of state; a second to Lenthall, the\nspeaker of parliament. They were dated on the 16th and 17th of September;\nwhich probably ought to have been the 17th and 18th, for he repeatedly\nmakes such mistakes in numbering the days of that month. These two\ndocuments on several accounts deserve the attention of the reader.",
        "I. Both mention a massacre, but with this difference, that whereas the\nearlier seems to confine it to the men in arms against the commonwealth,\nthe second towards the end notices, incidentally as it were, the additional\nslaughter of a thousand of the townspeople in the church of St. Peter. In\nthe first, Cromwell, as if he doubted how the shedding of so much blood\nwould be taken, appears to shift the origin of the massacre from himself to\nthe soldiery, who considered the refusal of quarter as a matter of course,\nafter the summons which had been sent into the town on the preceding day;\nbut in the next despatch he assumes a bolder tone, and takes upon himself\nall the blame or merit of the proceeding. “Our men were ordered by meto put them all to the sword.\"–\"I forbade them to spare any that were\nin arms.” In the first, to reconcile the council to the slaughter, he\npronounces it a “marvellous great mercy;” for the enemy had lost by it\ntheir best officers and prime soldiers: in the next he openly betrays his\nown misgivings, acknowledging that “such actions cannot but work remorse\nand regret without sufficient grounds,” and alleging as sufficient grounds\nin the present case–1. that it was a righteous judgment of God on\nbarbarous wretches who had imbued their hands in so much innocent blood;\nand 2. that it would tend to prevent the effusion of blood for the future.",
        "2. Now the insinuation conveyed in the first of these reasons, that\nthe major part of the garrison had been engaged in the outbreak of the\nrebellion and its accompanying horrors, was in all probability a falsehood;\nfor the major part of the garrison was not composed of native soldiers,\nbut of Englishmen serving under the marquess of Ormond, the king’s lord\nlieutenant. This is plain from the evidence of persons who cannot be\nsupposed ignorant of the fact; the evidence of the royalist Clarendon\n(History, vol. iii. part i. p. 323), and of the republican Ludlow, who soon\nafterwards was made general of the horse, and became Cromwell’s deputy\nin the government of the island (Ludlow, Memoirs, i. 301). But, however\ngroundless the insinuation might be, it served Cromwell’s purpose; it would\narray in his favour the fanaticism of the more godly of his party.",
        "For the massacre of the townspeople in the church he offers a similar\napology, equally calculated to interest the feelings of the saints. “They\nhad had the insolence on the last Lord’s day to thrust out the Protestants,\nand to have the mass said there.” Now this remark plainly includes a\nparalogism. The persons who had ordered the mass to be said there on the\n9th of September were undoubtedly the civil or military authorities in the\ntown. Theirs was the guilt, if guilt it were, and theirs should have been\nthe punishment. Yet his argument supposes that the unarmed individuals\nwhose blood was shed there on the 12th, were the very persons who had set\nup the mass on the 9th.",
        "3. We know not how far this second massacre was originated or encouraged by\nCromwell. It is well known that in the sack of towns it is not always in\nthe power of the commander to restrain the fury of the assailants, who\nabuse the license of victory to gratify the most brutal of their passions.\nBut here we have no reason to suppose that Cromwell made any effort to save\nthe lives of the unarmed and the innocent. Both the commander and his\nmen had a common religious duty to perform. They were come, in his\nown language, “to ask an account of the innocent blood which had been\nshed,\"–to “do execution on the enemies of God’s cause.” Hence, in the case\nof a resisting city, they included the old man, the female, and the child\nin the same category with the armed combatant, and consigned all to the\nsame fate.",
        "4. Of the proceedings of the victors during that night we are ignorant; but\nit does not suggest a very favourable notion of their forbearance, that\nin the following morning the great church of St. Peter’s was filled with\ncrowds of townspeople of both sexes, and of every age and condition. The\nmajority of the women and children sought protection within the body of the\nchurch; a select party of females, belonging to the first families in the\ntown, procured access to the crypts under the choir, which seemed to offer\nmore favourable chances of concealment and safety. But the sacred edifice\nafforded no asylum to either. The carnage began within the church at an\nearly hour; and, when it was completed, the bloodhounds tracked their prey\ninto the vaults beneath the pavement. Among the men who thus descended into\nthese subterranean recesses, was Thomas Wood, at that time a subaltern,\nafterwards a captain in Ingoldsby’s regiment. He found there, according\nto his own narrative, “the flower and choicest of the women and ladies\nbelonging to the town, amongst whom a most handsome virgin, arrayed in\ncostly and gorgeous apparel, kneeled down to him with tears and prayers to\nsave her life; and being strucken with a profound pitie, he took her under\nhis arme, and went with her out of the church with intentions to put\nher over the works to shift for herself; but a soldier perceiving his\nintention, he ran his sword up her belly or fundament. Whereupon Mr. Wood,\nseeing her gasping, took away her money, jewels, &c., and flung her down\nover the works.” (See the Life of Anthony a Wood, p. xx., in the edition by\nBliss, of 1813. Thomas was the brother of Anthony, the Oxford historian.)\n\"He told them also that 3,000 at least, besides some women and children,\nwere, after the assailants had taken part, and afterwards all the towne,\nput to the sword on the 11th and 12th of September, 1649. He told them\nthat when they were to make their way up to the lofts and galleries of\nthe church, and up to the tower, where the enemy had fled, each of the\nassailants would take up a child, and use as a buckler of defence,\nwhen they ascended the steps, to keep themselves from being shot or\nbrained.\"–Wood, ibid. These anecdotes, from the mouth of one who was an\neyewitness of, probably a participator in, the horrors of that day, will\nenable the reader to form an adequate notion of the thirst for blood which\nstimulated the soldiery, and of the cruelties which they exercised on their\ndefenceless victims.",
        "5. The terms of indignation, and abhorrence in which the sack of Drogheda\nwas described by the royalists of that period are well known. I shall add\nhere another testimony; not that it affords more important information,\nbut because I am not aware that it has ever met the eye of more recent\nhistorians; the testimony of Bruodin, an Irish friar, of great eminence and\nauthority in the Franciscan order. “Quinque diebus continuis haec laniena\n(qua, nullo habito locorum, sexus, religionis aut aetatis discrimine,\njuvenes et virgines lactantes aeque ac senio confecti barbarorum gladiis\nubique trucidati sunt) duravit. Quatuor milia Catholicorum virorum (ut\nde infinita multitudine religiosorum, foeminarum, puerorum, puellarum\net infantium nihil dicam) in civitate gladius impiorum rebellium illa\nexpugnatione devoravit.\"–Propugnaculum Cathol. Veritatis, lib. iv. c. 14,\np. 678.",
        "6. Here another question occurs. How did Cromwell obtain possession of\nDrogheda? for there appears in his despatches a studied evasion of the\nparticulars necessary to give a clear view of the transaction. The\nnarrative is so confused that it provokes a suspicion of cunning and\nconcealment on the part of the writer. The royalists affirmed that\nthe place was won through promises of quarter which were afterwards\nperfidiously violated, and their assertion is supported by the testimony of\nOrmond in an official letter written from the neighbourhood to Lord Byron.\n\"Cromwell,” he says, “having been twice beaten from the breach, carried it\nthe third time, all his officers and soldiers promising quarter to such as\nwould lay down their arms, and performing it as long as any place held\nout, which encouraged others to yield; but when they had all once in their\npower, and feared no hurt that could be done them, then the word no quarter\nwent round, and the soldiers were, many of them, forced against their wills\nto kill their prisoners. The governor and all his officers were killed\nin cold blood, except some few of least consideration that escaped by\nmiracle.\"–Sept. 29, Carte’s Letters, ii. 412. It is possible, though\nnot very probable, that Ormond suffered himself to be misled by false\ninformation. It should, however, be observed, that there is nothing in his\naccount positively contradicted by Cromwell’s despatch. Cromwell had, not\nforbidden the granting of quarter before the storm. It was afterwards, “in\nthe heat of the action,” that he issued this order. But at what part of the\naction? On what account? What had happened to provoke him to issue it?\nHe tells us that within the breach the garrison had thrown up three\nentrenchments; two of which were soon carried, but the third, that on the\nMill-Mount, was exceedingly strong, having a good graft, and strongly\npalisaded. For additional particulars we must have recourse to other\nauthority, from which we learn that within this work was posted a body of\npicked soldiers with every thing requisite for a vigorous defence, so that\nit could not have been taken by force without the loss of some hundreds of\nmen on the part of the assailants. It so happened, however, that the latter\nentered it without opposition, and “Colonel Axtell, with some twelve of\nhis men, went up to the top of the mount, and demanded of the governor the\nsurrender of it, who was very stubborn, speaking very big words, but at\nlength was persuaded to go into the windmill at the top of the mount, and\nas many more of the chiefest of them as it could contain, where they were\ndisarmed, and afterwards all slain.\"–Perfect Diurnal from Oct. 1 to Oct.\n8. Now Cromwell in his despatch says “The governor, Sir Arthur Ashton, and\ndivers considerable officers, being there (on the Mill-Mount), our men,\ngetting up to them, were ordered by me to put them all to the sword.” In my\nopinion this passage affords a strong corroboration of the charge made by\nOrmond. If the reader compare it with the passage already quoted from the\nDiurnal, he will find it difficult to suppress a suspicion that Axtell\nand his men had obtained a footing on the Mill-Mount through the offer of\nquarter; and that this was the reason why Cromwell, when he knew that they\nhad obtained possession, issued an order forbidding the granting of quarter\non any account. The consequence was, that the governor and his officers\nwent into the mill, and were there disarmed, and afterwards all slain. The\nother prisoners were treated in the same manner as their officers.",
        "7. Ormond adds, in the same letter, that the sack of the town lasted during\nfive days, meaning, probably, from September 11 to September 15, or 16,\ninclusively. The same is asserted by most of the royalists. But how could\nthat be, when the storm began on the 11th, and the army marched from\nDrogheda on the 15th? The question may perhaps be solved by a circumstance\naccidentally mentioned by Dr. Bates, that on the departure of the army,\nseveral individuals who had hitherto succeeded in concealing themselves,\ncrept out of their hiding-places, but did not elude the vigilance of the\ngarrison, by whom they were put to the sword.–Bates’s Rise and Progress,\npart ii. p. 27.",
        "II. 1. It did not require many days to transmit intelligence from Dublin to\nthe government; for the admiralty had contracted with a Captain Rich, that\nfor the monthly sum of twenty-two pounds he should constantly have two\nswift-sailing vessels, stationed, one at Holyhead, the other at Dublin,\nready to put to sea on the arrival of despatches for the service of the\nstate.–Lords’ Journ. ix. 617. From an accidental entry in Whitelock, it\nwould appear that the letters from Cromwell reached London on the 27th\nof September; on the 28th, parliament, without any cause assigned in the\nJournals, was adjourned to October 2nd, and on that day the official\naccount of the massacre at Drogheda was made public. At the same time an\norder was obtained from the parliament, that “a letter should be written to\nthe lord lieutenant of Ireland, to be communicated to the officers there,\nthat the house doth approve of the execution done at Drogheda both as\nan act of justice to them and mercy to others, who may be warned by it\"\n(Journals, vi. 301), which are the very reasons alleged by Cromwell in his\ndespatch. His conduct was now sanctioned by the highest authority; and from\nthat moment the saints in the army rejoiced to indulge the yearnings of\ntheir zeal for the cause of God, by shedding the blood of the Irish enemy.\nNor had they long to wait for the opportunity. On the 1st of October he\narrived in the neighbourhood of Wexford; on the 9th he opened a cannonade\non the castle, which completely commanded the town. On the 11th, Synnot,\nthe military governor, offered to capitulate; four commissioners, one of\nwhom was Stafford, the captain of the castle, waited on Cromwell to\narrange the terms. He was dissatisfied with their demands, pronounced them\n\"abominable,” and detained them till he had prepared his answer. By that\nanswer he granted life and liberty to the soldiers; life, but not liberty,\nto the commissioned officers, and freedom from pillage to the inhabitants,\nsubject, however, to the decision of parliament with respect to their real\nproperty. He required an immediate acceptance of these terms, and the\ndelivery to him of six hostages within an hour.–(Compare the letter of\nOctober 16 in the King’s Pamphlets, No. 442, with the document published\nby Mr. Carlyle, ii. 79, which appears to me nothing more than a rough and\nincorrect draft of an intended answer.) But Stafford was a traitor. In the\ninterval, being “fairly treated,” he accepted, without communication with\nthe governor, the terms granted by Cromwell, and opened the gates of the\nfortress to the enemy. From the castle they scaled an undefended wall in\nthe vicinity, and poured into the town. A paper containing the terms was\nnow delivered to the other three commissioners; but “their commissioners\nthis while not having hearts to put themselves into the town again with out\noffer.\"–Ibid. Letter of October 16. Thus Synnot and the other authorities\nremained in ignorance of Cromwell’s decision.",
        "2. At the first alarm the garrison and burghers assembled in the\nmarket-place, to which they were accompanied or followed by crowds of\nold men, women, and children. For a while the progress of the enemy was\nretarded by barricades of cables. At the entrance of the market-place they\nmet with a “stiff resistance,” as it is called by Cromwell. The\naction lasted about an hour; but the assailants receiving continual\nreinforcements, obtained at last fell possession of the place, and put\nto the sword every human being found upon it. The governor and the mayor\nperished with the rest.",
        "3. But how could these bloody proceedings be reconciled with the terms of\ncapitulation which had been already granted? If we may believe Cromwell’s\nofficial account, a matchless specimen of craft and mystification, he was\nnot to blame that they had been broken. He was perfectly innocent of all\nthat had happened. Could he not then have ordered his men to keep within\nthe castle, or have recalled them when they forced an entrance into the\ntown? Undoubtedly he might; but the pious man was unwilling to put himself\nin opposition to God. “His study had been to preserve the place from\nplunder, that it might be of more use to the commonwealth and the army.\"\nBut he saw “that God would not have have it so.” The events which so\nquickly followed each other, were to him a proof that God in his righteous\njudgment had doomed the town and its defendants to destruction; on which\naccount he “thought it not good, nor just, to restrain off the soldiers\nfrom their right of pillage, nor from doing of execution on the\nenemy.\"–Letter of 16th of October. He concludes his despatch to the\ngovernment with these words:–\"Thus it has pleased God to give into your\nhands this other mercy, for which, as for all, we pray God may have all the\nglory. Indeed, your instruments are poor and weak. and can do nothing but\nthrough believing, and that is the gift of God also.\"–Cary’s Memorials,\nii. 180. Did then the fanatic believe that perfidy and cruelty were gifts\nof God? for at Wexford he could not plead, as at Drogheda, that his summons\nhad been contemptuously rejected. It had been accepted, and he had himself\ndictated the terms of capitulation. Was he not obliged to carry them into\nexecution, even if, as was pretended in defiance of all probability, his\nmen had taken possession of the castle, and forced an entrance into the\ntown without his knowledge or connivance? Would any honest man have\nreleased himself from such obligation under the flimsy pretext that it\nwould be acting against the will of God to recall the soldiers and prevent\nthem from doing execution on the enemy?",
        "4. Cromwell’s ministers of the divine will performed their part at Wexford,\nas they had done at Drogheda, doing execution, not on the armed combatants\nonly, but on the women and children also. Of these helpless victims many\nhad congregated round the great cross. It was a natural consequence in such\nan emergency. Hitherto they had been accustomed to kneel at the foot\nof that cross in prayer, now, with life itself at stake, they would\ninstinctively press towards it to escape from the swords of the enemy. But,\nas far an regards the atrocity of the thing, it makes little difference on\nwhat particular spot they were murdered. You cannot relieve the memory\nof Cromwell from the odium of such murder, but by proving, what it is\nimpossible to prove, that at Wexford the women and children were specially\nexcepted out of the general massacre.",
        "5. I have already copied Bruodin’s description of the sack of Drogheda;\nhere I may transcribe his account of the sack of Wexford. “Ipse strategus\nregicidarum terrestri itinere Dublinium praetergressus, Wexfordiam (modicam\nquidem, et maritimam, munitam et opulentam civitatem) versus castra movet,\noccupatoque insperate, proditione cujusdam perfidi ducis castro, quod\nmoenibus imminebat, in civitatem irruit: opposuere se viriliter aggressori\npraesidiarii simul cum civibus, pugnatumque est ardentissime per unius\nhorae spatium inter partes in foro, sed impari congressu, nam cives fere\nomnes una cum militibus, sine status, sexus, aut aetatis discrimine,\nCromweli gladius absumpsit.\"–Bruodin, Propag. 1. iv. c. 14, p. 679. The\nfollowing is a more valuable document, from the “humble petition of the\nancient natives of the town of Wexford,” to Charles II., July 4, 1660. “Yet\nsoe it is, may it please your Majestie, that after all the resistance they\ncould make, the said usurper, having a great armie by sea and land before\nthe said toune, did on the 9th of October, 1649, soe powerfully assault\nthem, that he entered the toune, and put man, woman, and child, to a very\nfew, to the sword, where among the rest the governor lost his life,\nand others of the soldiers and inhabitants to the number of 1,500\npersons.\"–Gale’s Corporation System in Ireland, App. p. cxxvi.",
        "6. My object in these remarks has been to enable the reader to form a\ncorrect notion of the manner in which Cromwell conducted the war in\nIreland. They will give little satisfaction to the worshippers of the\nhero. But his character is not a mere matter of taste or sympathy. It is a\nquestion of historic inquiry. Much indeed has been written to vindicate\nhim from the imputation of cruelty at Drogheda and Wexford; but of the\narguments hitherto adduced in his defence, it will be no presumption\nto affirm that there is not one among them which can bear the test of\ndispassionate investigation.",

        "Principles of Government.",
        "1. The government of England ought to be by laws, and not by men; that is,\nthe laws ought to judge of all offences and offenders, and all punishments\nand penalties to be inflicted upon criminals; nor ought the pleasure of his\nhighness and his council to make whom they please offenders, and punish and\nimprison whom they please, and during pleasure.",
        "2. All laws, levies of moneys, war and peace, ought be made by the people’s\ndeputies in parliament, to be chosen by them successively at certain\nperiods. Therefore there should be no negative of a monarch, because he\nwill frequently by that means consult his own interest or that of his\nfamily, to the prejudice of the people. But it would be well if the\ndeputies of the people were divided into two bodies, one of which should\npropose the laws, and the other adopt or reject them.",
        "3. All persons, without a single exception, should be subject to the law.",
        "4. The people ought to be formed into such a military posture by and under\nthe parliament, that they may be able to compel every man to obey the law,\nand defend the country from foreigners. A mercenary (standing) army is\ndangerous to liberty, and therefore should not be admitted.",
        "Principles of Religion.\n1. The assent of the understanding cannot be compelled. Therefore no man\ncan compel another to be of the true religion.",
        "2. Worship follows from the doctrines admitted by the understanding. No man\ntherefore can bind another to adopt any particular form of worship.",
        "3. Works of righteousness and mercy are part of the worship of God, and so\nfar fall under the civil magistrate, that he ought to restrain men from\nirreligion, that is, injustice, faith-breaking, oppression, and all other\nevil works that are plainly evil.",
        "4. Nothing is more destructive to true religion than quarrels about\nreligion, and the use of punishments to compel one man to believe as\nanother.",

        "That Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper was deeply engaged in the intrigues of this\nbusy time is sufficiently manifest. He appears to have held himself out\nto every party as a friend, and to have finally attached himself to the\nroyalists, when he saw that the royal cause was likely to triumph. Charles\nacknowledged his services in the patent by which he was created Lord\nAshley, mentioning in particular “his prudent and seasonable advice with\nGeneral Monk in order to the king’s restoration.\"–Dugd. ii. 481. From this\npassage we may infer that Cooper was one of Monk’s confidential advisers;\nbut his admirers have gone much farther, attributing to him the whole merit\nof the restoration, and representing the lord-general as a mere puppet in\nthe hands of their hero. In proof they refer to the story told by Locke\n(iii. 471),–a story which cannot easily be reconciled with the more\ncredible and unpretending narrative of Clarges, in Baker’s Chronicle, p.\n602, edit. 1730.

        "2. The council of state was sitting in another room; and Clarges, sending\nfor Sir A.A. Cooper, communicated his suspicion to him.",
        "3. After some consultation it was agreed that, as soon as Monk, having\ndismissed Scot and Hazlerig, should enter the council-room, Cooper should\nmove that the clerks be ordered to withdraw.",
        "4. When this was done, Cooper said that he had received notice of a\ndangerous design; that some seditious persons had made “indecent proposals\"\nto the general; and of such proposals he desired that the council might\nhave a full discovery.",
        "5. Monk, unwilling to expose them, replied that there was very little\ndanger in the case; that some persons had, indeed, been with him to be\nresolved in scruples respecting the present transactions in parliament; but\nthat he had sent them away well satisfied (p. 602).",

Bordeaux offered to Monk through Clarges the aid of Mazarin, whether it\nwere his object to restore the king, or to assume the government himself.\nMonk refused; but consented to receive a visit of civility from the\nambassador, on condition that politics should not be introduced (p. 604).",
        "Locke",
        "1. Bordeaux, the French ambassador, visited Monk one evening, and Mrs.\nMonk, who had secreted herself behind the hangings, heard him offer the\naid of Mazarin to her husband, if he was willing to take the government on\nhimself, which offer the general accepted.",
        "2. Mrs. Monk sent her brother Clarges to communicate the discovery of her\nhusband’s ambitious design to Sir A.A. Cooper.",
        "3. Cooper caused a council to be called, and, when they were met, moved\nthat the clerks should withdraw, because he had matter of consequence to\ncommunicate.",
        "4. He then charged Monk, “not openly, but by insinuation, that he was\nplaying false with them, so that the rest of the council perceived there\nwas something in it, though they knew not what was meant.”",
        "5. Monk replied that he was willing to satisfy them that he was true to\nhis principles. Then, said Ashley, replace certain officers of suspicious\ncharacter by others of known fidelity. This was done on the spot; the\ncommand of the army by the change was virtually taken from Monk; and he was\ncompelled to declare for Charles Stuart",
        "It may be thought that Locke’s narrative derives confirmation from another\nversion of the same story in the Life of Lord Shaftesbury, lately edited by\nMr. Cooke, with the following variations. Bordeaux is made to accompany the\nrepublicans; the greater part of the night is spent in consultation, and\nMonk not only consents to assume the government, but resolves to arrest in\nthe morning Cooper and several other influential individuals (p. 233-235).\nBut that life cannot be considered as an authority; for the documents from\nwhich it is said to have been compiled are neither quoted nor described by\nits author, nor have ever been seen by its present editor.",
