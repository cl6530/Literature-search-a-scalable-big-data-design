        "Then came the night of the first falling star.  It was seen\nearly in the morning, rushing over Winchester eastward, a\nline of flame high in the atmosphere.  Hundreds must have\nseen it, and taken it for an ordinary falling star.  Albin de-\nscribed it as leaving a greenish streak behind it that glowed\nfor some seconds.  Denning, our greatest authority on meteor-\nites, stated that the height of its first appearance was about\nninety or one hundred miles.  It seemed to him that it fell\nto earth about one hundred miles east of him.",
        "I was at home at that hour and writing in my study; and\nalthough my French windows face towards Ottershaw and\nthe blind was up (for I loved in those days to look up at\nthe night sky), I saw nothing of it.  Yet this strangest of all\nthings that ever came to earth from outer space must have\nfallen while I was sitting there, visible to me had I only\nlooked up as it passed.  Some of those who saw its flight say\nit travelled with a hissing sound.  I myself heard nothing\nof that.  Many people in Berkshire, Surrey, and Middlesex\nmust have seen the fall of it, and, at most, have thought\nthat another meteorite had descended.  No one seems to have\ntroubled to look for the fallen mass that night.",
        "But very early in the morning poor Ogilvy, who had seen\nthe shooting star and who was persuaded that a meteorite lay\nsomewhere on the common between Horsell, Ottershaw, and\nWoking, rose early with the idea of finding it.  Find it he did,\nsoon after dawn, and not far from the sand pits.  An enormous\nhole had been made by the impact of the projectile, and the\nsand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction\nover the heath, forming heaps visible a mile and a half away.\nThe heather was on fire eastward, and a thin blue smoke\nrose against the dawn.",
        "The Thing itself lay almost entirely buried in sand, amidst\nthe scattered splinters of a fir tree it had shivered to frag-\nments in its descent.  The uncovered part had the appearance\nof a huge cylinder, caked over and its outline softened by a\nthick scaly dun-coloured incrustation.  It had a diameter of\nabout thirty yards.  He approached the mass, surprised at\nthe size and more so at the shape, since most meteorites\nare rounded more or less completely.  It was, however, still\nso hot from its flight through the air as to forbid his near\napproach.  A stirring noise within its cylinder he ascribed to\nthe unequal cooling of its surface; for at that time it had\nnot occurred to him that it might be hollow.",
        "He remained standing at the edge of the pit that the\nThing had made for itself, staring at its strange appearance,\nastonished chiefly at its unusual shape and colour, and\ndimly perceiving even then some evidence of design in its\narrival.  The early morning was wonderfully still, and the sun,\njust clearing the pine trees towards Weybridge, was already\nwarm.  He did not remember hearing any birds that morning,\nthere was certainly no breeze stirring, and the only sounds\nwere the faint movements from within the cindery cylinder.\nHe was all alone on the common.",
        "Then suddenly he noticed with a start that some of the\ngrey clinker, the ashy incrustation that covered the meteorite,\nwas falling off the circular edge of the end.  It was dropping\noff in flakes and raining down upon the sand.  A large piece\nsuddenly came off and fell with a sharp noise that brought\nhis heart into his mouth.",
        "For a minute he scarcely realised what this meant, and,\nalthough the heat was excessive, he clambered down into\nthe pit close to the bulk to see the Thing more clearly.  He\nfancied even then that the cooling of the body might account\nfor this, but what disturbed that idea was the fact that the\nash was falling only from the end of the cylinder.",
        "And then he perceived that, very slowly, the circular top\nof the cylinder was rotating on its body.  It was such a\ngradual movement that he discovered it only through noticing\nthat a black mark that had been near him five minutes ago\nwas now at the other side of the circumference.  Even then\nhe scarcely understood what this indicated, until he heard a\nmuffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward\nan inch or so.  Then the thing came upon him in a flash.  The\ncylinder was artificial--hollow--with an end that screwed\nout!  Something within the cylinder was unscrewing the top!",
        "“Good heavens!” said Ogilvy.  “There’s a man in it--men\nin it!  Half roasted to death!  Trying to escape!”",
        "At once, with a quick mental leap, he linked the Thing\nwith the flash upon Mars.",
        "The thought of the confined creature was so dreadful to\nhim that he forgot the heat and went forward to the cylinder\nto help turn.  But luckily the dull radiation arrested him before\nhe could burn his hands on the still-glowing metal.  At that\nhe stood irresolute for a moment, then turned, scrambled out\nof the pit, and set off running wildly into Woking.  The time\nthen must have been somewhere about six o’clock.  He met a\nwaggoner and tried to make him understand, but the tale\nhe told and his appearance were so wild--his hat had fallen\noff in the pit--that the man simply drove on.  He was equally\nunsuccessful with the potman who was just unlocking the\ndoors of the public-house by Horsell Bridge.  The fellow\nthought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful\nattempt to shut him into the taproom.  That sobered him a\nlittle; and when he saw Henderson, the London journalist,\nin his garden, he called over the palings and made himself\nunderstood.",
        "“Henderson,” he called, “you saw that shooting star last\nnight?”",
        "“Well?” said Henderson.",
        "“It’s out on Horsell Common now.”",
        "“Good Lord!” said Henderson.  “Fallen meteorite!  That’s\ngood.”",
        "“But it’s something more than a meteorite.  It’s a cylinder\n--an artificial cylinder, man!  And there’s something inside.”",
        "Henderson stood up with his spade in his hand.",
        "“What’s that?” he said.  He was deaf in one ear.",
        "Ogilvy told him all that he had seen.  Henderson was a\nminute or so taking it in.  Then he dropped his spade, snatched\nup his jacket, and came out into the road.  The two men\nhurried back at once to the common, and found the cylinder\nstill lying in the same position.  But now the sounds inside\nhad ceased, and a thin circle of bright metal showed between\nthe top and the body of the cylinder.  Air was either entering\nor escaping at the rim with a thin, sizzling sound.",
        "They listened, rapped on the scaly burnt metal with a\nstick, and, meeting with no response, they both concluded\nthe man or men inside must be insensible or dead.",
        "Of course the two were quite unable to do anything.  They\nshouted consolation and promises, and went off back to the\ntown again to get help.  One can imagine them, covered\nwith sand, excited and disordered, running up the little\nstreet in the bright sunlight just as the shop folks were\ntaking down their shutters and people were opening their\nbedroom windows.  Henderson went into the railway station\nat once, in order to telegraph the news to London.  The\nnewspaper articles had prepared men’s minds for the re-\nception of the idea.",
        "By eight o’clock a number of boys and unemployed men\nhad already started for the common to see the “dead men from\nMars.”  That was the form the story took.  I heard of it first\nfrom my newspaper boy about a quarter to nine when I went out\nto get my DAILY CHRONICLE.  I was naturally startled, and\nlost no time in going out and across the Ottershaw bridge\nto the sand pits.",
