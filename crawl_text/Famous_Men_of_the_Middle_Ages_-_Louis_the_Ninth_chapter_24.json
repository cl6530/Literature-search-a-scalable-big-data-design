        "\nHenry the Second\n",
        "\n\n",
        "After the time of Barbarossa and Richard Cur de Lion lived another\ngreat Crusading king.  This was a grandson of Philip II, named\nLouis IX, who became sovereign of France in 1226.  He was then only\neleven years old, so for some years his mother ruled the kingdom.",
        "A few years after he had begun to reign Louis decided to make his\nbrother Alphonse the governor of a certain part of France.  The\nnobles of the region refused to have Alphonse as governor and\ninvited Henry III of England to help them in a revolt.",
        "Henry crossed to France with an army to support the rebellious\nnobles.  He was duke of Aquitaine and Gascony; so that although he\nwas the king in England he had to do homage to the king of France\nfor his possessions in that country, and fight for him if called\nupon to do so.",
        "Louis gathered an army and hastened to meet the English troops.\nHe drove Henry from place to place, until at last he forced him\nto make terms of peace.  The rebellious nobles who had invited the\nEnglish king to France soon after swore allegiance to Louis and\nafterwards he had little trouble in his kingdom.",
        "Once Louis was dangerously ill and his life was despaired of.\nFinally he was believed to be dying and his wife and chief officials\ngathered round his bed to await the end.  Suddenly he roused himself\nand said in a feeble voice, “The cross!  The cross!”",
        "They laid the cross upon his heart and he clasped it fervently.\nFor a while he slumbered.  When he awoke he appeared much better.\nIn a day or two he was entirely well.  He then made a solemn vow\nthat in thankfulness for his restoration he would go on a Crusade\nto the Holy Land.",
        "Louis lived at a time when everybody was full of the Crusading\nspirit.  A few years before he was born even the children in France\nand Germany started out upon a Crusade of their own.  It is called\nin history the “Children’s Crusade.”  Several thousand left their\nhomes and marched toward the Mediterranean.  They thought that God\nwould open a pathway to the Holy Land for them through its waters.\nA number of them died of cold and hunger when trying to cross the\nAlps.  Some reached Rome, and when the Pope saw them he told them\nto return home and not think of going on a Crusade until they were\ngrown up.",
        "It is easy to understand how in such an age people flocked to\nLouis’ banner when he asked for volunteers to go with him on another\nCrusade.",
        "In a few months forty thousand Crusaders assembled at a French port\non the Mediterranean Sea.  On a bright day in August, 1248, they\nwent on board the fleet which was ready to sail.  The king called\nto the Crusaders, “Sing in the name of God.  Shout forth his praises\nas we sail away.”  Then quickly, on ship after ship, shouts of\npraise burst from the lips of thousands and amid the grand chorus\nthe fleet began its voyage.",
        "The Crusaders went to Damietta (Dam-i-et’-ta), in Egypt.  Louis\nwas so eager to land that he jumped into water up to his waist and\nwaded ashore.  He captured the city without striking a blow.",
        "He had resolved to make war on the Moslems in Egypt rather than in\nthe Holy Land, so when he left Damietta he marched southward.",
        "He supposed there would be no strong force to stop his progress.\nHowever, he was mistaken, for he had not marched forty miles toward\nCairo when he was attacked by a Moslem army led by the sultan of\nEgypt.",
        "A great battle was fought.  The Crusaders were commanded by King\nLouis and throughout the battle showed the utmost bravery, but they\nwere outnumbered.  Thousands were slain and the survivors retreated\ntoward Damietta.",
        "The Moslems pursued them and the Crusaders were obliged to surrender.\nOut of the forty thousand men who had left France only about six\nthousand now remained.  Many had died of disease as well as in\nbattle.",
        "King Louis was among the prisoners, and the sultan of Egypt agreed\nto release him only upon the payment of a large ransom.",
        "When the ransom had been paid a truce was made for ten years between\nLouis and the sultan, and the good king left Egypt.  He then went\nto the Holy Land, and for four years worked to deliver Crusaders\nwho were in Moslem prisons.",
        "During the time that Louis was in the Holy Land his mother ruled\nFrance as regent.  When she died he returned immediately to his\nkingdom and devoted himself to governing it.",
        "In 1252 he took part in the founding of the Sorbonne, the most\nfamous theological college of Europe from the days of St. Louis\ndown to the time of the French Revolution.",
        "He ruled his people so wisely and justly that it is hard to find\nany better king or even one equally as good in the whole line\nof French kings.  He never wronged any man himself, or knowingly\nallowed any man to be wronged by others.",
        "Near his palace there was a grand oak with wide-spreading branches,\nunder which he used to sit on pleasant days in summer.  There\nhe received all persons who had complaints to make, rich and poor\nalike.  Every one who came was allowed to tell his story without\nhindrance.",
        "For hours Louis would listen patiently to all the tales of wrong-doing,\nof hardships and misery that were told him, and he would do what\nhe could to right the wrongs of those who suffered.",
        "When news came of some more dreadful persecutions of Christians by\nthe Moslems in Palestine, Louis again raised an army of Crusaders\nand started with them for Tunis, although he was sick and feeble—so\nsick, indeed, that he had to be carried on a litter.  Upon his\narrival at Tunis he was attacked by fever and died in a few days.",
        "He is better known to the world as Saint Louis than as Louis IX,\nbecause some years after his death Pope Boniface VIII canonized\nhim on account of his pious life and his efforts to rescue the Holy\nLand from the Turks.",
