        "I returned from the City about three o’clock on that May afternoon\npretty well disgusted with life.  I had been three months in the Old\nCountry, and was fed up with it.  If anyone had told me a year ago\nthat I would have been feeling like that I should have laughed at\nhim; but there was the fact.  The weather made me liverish, the talk\nof the ordinary Englishman made me sick, I couldn’t get enough\nexercise, and the amusements of London seemed as flat as soda-\nwater that has been standing in the sun.  ’Richard Hannay,’ I kept\ntelling myself, ’you have got into the wrong ditch, my friend, and\nyou had better climb out.’",
        "It made me bite my lips to think of the plans I had been building\nup those last years in Bulawayo.  I had got my pile–not one of the\nbig ones, but good enough for me; and I had figured out all kinds\nof ways of enjoying myself.  My father had brought me out from\nScotland at the age of six, and I had never been home since; so\nEngland was a sort of Arabian Nights to me, and I counted on\nstopping there for the rest of my days.",
        "But from the first I was disappointed with it.  In about a week I\nwas tired of seeing sights, and in less than a month I had had\nenough of restaurants and theatres and race-meetings.  I had no real\npal to go about with, which probably explains things.  Plenty of\npeople invited me to their houses, but they didn’t seem much\ninterested in me.  They would fling me a question or two about\nSouth Africa, and then get on their own affairs.  A lot of Imperialist\nladies asked me to tea to meet schoolmasters from New Zealand\nand editors from Vancouver, and that was the dismalest business of\nall.  Here was I, thirty-seven years old, sound in wind and limb,\nwith enough money to have a good time, yawning my head off all\nday.  I had just about settled to clear out and get back to the veld,\nfor I was the best bored man in the United Kingdom.",
        "That afternoon I had been worrying my brokers about\ninvestments to give my mind something to work on, and on my\nway home I turned into my club–rather a pot-house, which took\nin Colonial members.  I had a long drink, and read the evening\npapers.  They were full of the row in the Near East, and there was\nan article about Karolides, the Greek Premier.  I rather fancied the\nchap.  From all accounts he seemed the one big man in the show;\nand he played a straight game too, which was more than could be\nsaid for most of them.  I gathered that they hated him pretty blackly\nin Berlin and Vienna, but that we were going to stick by him, and\none paper said that he was the only barrier between Europe and\nArmageddon.  I remember wondering if I could get a job in those\nparts.  It struck me that Albania was the sort of place that might\nkeep a man from yawning.",
        "About six o’clock I went home, dressed, dined at the Cafe Royal,\nand turned into a music-hall.  It was a silly show, all capering\nwomen and monkey-faced men, and I did not stay long.  The night\nwas fine and clear as I walked back to the flat I had hired near\nPortland Place.  The crowd surged past me on the pavements, busy\nand chattering, and I envied the people for having something to\ndo.  These shop-girls and clerks and dandies and policemen had\nsome interest in life that kept them going.  I gave half-a-crown to a\nbeggar because I saw him yawn; he was a fellow-sufferer.  At Oxford\nCircus I looked up into the spring sky and I made a vow.  I would\ngive the Old Country another day to fit me into something; if\nnothing happened, I would take the next boat for the Cape.",
        "My flat was the first floor in a new block behind Langham Place.\nThere was a common staircase, with a porter and a liftman at the\nentrance, but there was no restaurant or anything of that sort, and\neach flat was quite shut off from the others.  I hate servants on the\npremises, so I had a fellow to look after me who came in by the\nday.  He arrived before eight o’clock every morning and used to\ndepart at seven, for I never dined at home.",
        "I was just fitting my key into the door when I noticed a man at\nmy elbow.  I had not seen him approach, and the sudden appearance\nmade me start.  He was a slim man, with a short brown beard and\nsmall, gimlety blue eyes.  I recognized him as the occupant of a flat\non the top floor, with whom I had passed the time of day on the\nstairs.",
        "’Can I speak to you?’ he said.  ’May I come in for a minute?’  He\nwas steadying his voice with an effort, and his hand was pawing my arm.",
        "I got my door open and motioned him in.  No sooner was he\nover the threshold than he made a dash for my back room, where I\nused to smoke and write my letters.  Then he bolted back.",
        "’Is the door locked?’ he asked feverishly, and he fastened the\nchain with his own hand.",
        "’I’m very sorry,’ he said humbly.  ’It’s a mighty liberty, but you\nlooked the kind of man who would understand.  I’ve had you in my\nmind all this week when things got troublesome.  Say, will you do\nme a good turn?’",
        "’I’ll listen to you,’ I said.  ’That’s all I’ll promise.’  I was getting\nworried by the antics of this nervous little chap.",
        "There was a tray of drinks on a table beside him, from which he\nfilled himself a stiff whisky-and-soda.  He drank it off in three\ngulps, and cracked the glass as he set it down.",
        "’Pardon,’ he said, ’I’m a bit rattled tonight.  You see, I happen at\nthis moment to be dead.’",
        "I sat down in an armchair and lit my pipe.",
        "’What does it feel like?’ I asked.  I was pretty certain that I had to\ndeal with a madman.",
        "A smile flickered over his drawn face.  ’I’m not mad–yet.  Say,\nSir, I’ve been watching you, and I reckon you’re a cool customer.  I\nreckon, too, you’re an honest man, and not afraid of playing a bold\nhand.  I’m going to confide in you.  I need help worse than any man\never needed it, and I want to know if I can count you in.’",
        "’Get on with your yarn,’ I said, ’and I’ll tell you.’",
        "He seemed to brace himself for a great effort, and then started on\nthe queerest rigmarole.  I didn’t get hold of it at first, and I had to\nstop and ask him questions.  But here is the gist of it:",
        "He was an American, from Kentucky, and after college, being\npretty well off, he had started out to see the world.  He wrote a bit,\nand acted as war correspondent for a Chicago paper, and spent a\nyear or two in South-Eastern Europe.  I gathered that he was a fine\nlinguist, and had got to know pretty well the society in those parts.\nHe spoke familiarly of many names that I remembered to have seen\nin the newspapers.",
        "He had played about with politics, he told me, at first for the\ninterest of them, and then because he couldn’t help himself.  I read\nhim as a sharp, restless fellow, who always wanted to get down to\nthe roots of things.  He got a little further down than he wanted.",
        "I am giving you what he told me as well as I could make it out.\nAway behind all the Governments and the armies there was a big\nsubterranean movement going on, engineered by very dangerous\npeople.  He had come on it by accident; it fascinated him; he went\nfurther, and then he got caught.  I gathered that most of the people\nin it were the sort of educated anarchists that make revolutions, but\nthat beside them there were financiers who were playing for money.\nA clever man can make big profits on a falling market, and it suited\nthe book of both classes to set Europe by the ears.",
        "He told me some queer things that explained a lot that had\npuzzled me–things that happened in the Balkan War, how one\nstate suddenly came out on top, why alliances were made and\nbroken, why certain men disappeared, and where the sinews of war\ncame from.  The aim of the whole conspiracy was to get Russia and\nGermany at loggerheads.",
        "When I asked why, he said that the anarchist lot thought it\nwould give them their chance.  Everything would be in the melting-\npot, and they looked to see a new world emerge.  The capitalists\nwould rake in the shekels, and make fortunes by buying up wreckage.\nCapital, he said, had no conscience and no fatherland.  Besides,\nthe Jew was behind it, and the Jew hated Russia worse than hell.",
        "’Do you wonder?’ he cried.  ’For three hundred years they have\nbeen persecuted, and this is the return match for the pogroms.  The\nJew is everywhere, but you have to go far down the backstairs to\nfind him.  Take any big Teutonic business concern.  If you have\ndealings with it the first man you meet is Prince von und Zu Something,\nan elegant young man who talks Eton-and-Harrow English.\nBut he cuts no ice.  If your business is big, you get behind him and\nfind a prognathous Westphalian with a retreating brow and the\nmanners of a hog.  He is the German business man that gives your\nEnglish papers the shakes.  But if you’re on the biggest kind of job\nand are bound to get to the real boss, ten to one you are brought up\nagainst a little white-faced Jew in a bath-chair with an eye like a\nrattlesnake.  Yes, Sir, he is the man who is ruling the world just\nnow, and he has his knife in the Empire of the Tzar, because his\naunt was outraged and his father flogged in some one-horse location\non the Volga.’",
        "I could not help saying that his Jew-anarchists seemed to have\ngot left behind a little.",
        "’Yes and no,’ he said.  ’They won up to a point, but they struck a\nbigger thing than money, a thing that couldn’t be bought, the old\nelemental fighting instincts of man.  If you’re going to be killed you\ninvent some kind of flag and country to fight for, and if you\nsurvive you get to love the thing.  Those foolish devils of soldiers\nhave found something they care for, and that has upset the pretty\nplan laid in Berlin and Vienna.  But my friends haven’t played their\nlast card by a long sight.  They’ve gotten the ace up their sleeves,\nand unless I can keep alive for a month they are going to play it\nand win.’",
        "’But I thought you were dead,’ I put in.",
        "’MORS JANUA VITAE,’ he smiled.  (I recognized the quotation: it was\nabout all the Latin I knew.) ’I’m coming to that, but I’ve got to put\nyou wise about a lot of things first.  If you read your newspaper, I\nguess you know the name of Constantine Karolides?’",
        "I sat up at that, for I had been reading about him that\nvery afternoon.",
        "’He is the man that has wrecked all their games.  He is the one\nbig brain in the whole show, and he happens also to be an honest\nman.  Therefore he has been marked down these twelve months\npast.  I found that out–not that it was difficult, for any fool could\nguess as much.  But I found out the way they were going to get\nhim, and that knowledge was deadly.  That’s why I have had to decease.’",
        "He had another drink, and I mixed it for him myself, for I was\ngetting interested in the beggar.",
        "’They can’t get him in his own land, for he has a bodyguard of\nEpirotes that would skin their grandmothers.  But on the 15th day of\nJune he is coming to this city.  The British Foreign Office has taken\nto having International tea-parties, and the biggest of them is due\non that date.  Now Karolides is reckoned the principal guest, and if\nmy friends have their way he will never return to his admiring\ncountrymen.’",
        "’That’s simple enough, anyhow,’ I said.  ’You can warn him and\nkeep him at home.’",
        "’And play their game?’ he asked sharply.  ’If he does not come\nthey win, for he’s the only man that can straighten out the tangle.\nAnd if his Government are warned he won’t come, for he does not\nknow how big the stakes will be on June the 15th.’",
        "’What about the British Government?’ I said.  ’They’re not going\nto let their guests be murdered.  Tip them the wink, and they’ll take\nextra precautions.’",
        "’No good.  They might stuff your city with plain-clothes detectives\nand double the police and Constantine would still be a\ndoomed man.  My friends are not playing this game for candy.  They\nwant a big occasion for the taking off, with the eyes of all Europe\non it.  He’ll be murdered by an Austrian, and there’ll be plenty of\nevidence to show the connivance of the big folk in Vienna and\nBerlin.  It will all be an infernal lie, of course, but the case will look\nblack enough to the world.  I’m not talking hot air, my friend.  I\nhappen to know every detail of the hellish contrivance, and I can\ntell you it will be the most finished piece of blackguardism since the\nBorgias.  But it’s not going to come off if there’s a certain man who\nknows the wheels of the business alive right here in London on the\n15th day of June.  And that man is going to be your servant,\nFranklin P.  Scudder.’",
        "I was getting to like the little chap.  His jaw had shut like a rat-\ntrap, and there was the fire of battle in his gimlety eyes.  If he was\nspinning me a yarn he could act up to it.",
        "’Where did you find out this story?’ I asked.",
        "’I got the first hint in an inn on the Achensee in Tyrol.  That set me\ninquiring, and I collected my other clues in a fur-shop in the Galician\nquarter of Buda, in a Strangers’ Club in Vienna, and in a little\nbookshop off the Racknitzstrasse in Leipsic.  I completed my evidence\nten days ago in Paris.  I can’t tell you the details now, for it’s\nsomething of a history.  When I was quite sure in my own mind I\njudged it my business to disappear, and I reached this city by a mighty\nqueer circuit.  I left Paris a dandified young French-American, and I\nsailed from Hamburg a Jew diamond merchant.  In Norway I was an\nEnglish student of Ibsen collecting materials for lectures, but when I\nleft Bergen I was a cinema-man with special ski films.  And I came\nhere from Leith with a lot of pulp-wood propositions in my pocket to\nput before the London newspapers.  Till yesterday I thought I had\nmuddied my trail some, and was feeling pretty happy.  Then ...’",
        "The recollection seemed to upset him, and he gulped down some\nmore whisky.",
        "’Then I saw a man standing in the street outside this block.  I\nused to stay close in my room all day, and only slip out after dark\nfor an hour or two.  I watched him for a bit from my window, and I\nthought I recognized him ...  He came in and spoke to the porter\n...  When I came back from my walk last night I found a card in\nmy letter-box.  It bore the name of the man I want least to meet on\nGod’s earth.’",
        "I think that the look in my companion’s eyes, the sheer naked\nscare on his face, completed my conviction of his honesty.  My own\nvoice sharpened a bit as I asked him what he did next.",
        "’I realized that I was bottled as sure as a pickled herring, and that\nthere was only one way out.  I had to die.  If my pursuers knew I\nwas dead they would go to sleep again.’",
        "’How did you manage it?’",
        "’I told the man that valets me that I was feeling pretty bad, and I\ngot myself up to look like death.  That wasn’t difficult, for I’m no\nslouch at disguises.  Then I got a corpse–you can always get a\nbody in London if you know where to go for it.  I fetched it back in\na trunk on the top of a four-wheeler, and I had to be assisted\nupstairs to my room.  You see I had to pile up some evidence for\nthe inquest.  I went to bed and got my man to mix me a sleeping-\ndraught, and then told him to clear out.  He wanted to fetch a\ndoctor, but I swore some and said I couldn’t abide leeches.  When I\nwas left alone I started in to fake up that corpse.  He was my size,\nand I judged had perished from too much alcohol, so I put some\nspirits handy about the place.  The jaw was the weak point in the\nlikeness, so I blew it away with a revolver.  I daresay there will be\nsomebody tomorrow to swear to having heard a shot, but there are\nno neighbours on my floor, and I guessed I could risk it.  So I left\nthe body in bed dressed up in my pyjamas, with a revolver lying on\nthe bed-clothes and a considerable mess around.  Then I got into a\nsuit of clothes I had kept waiting for emergencies.  I didn’t dare to\nshave for fear of leaving tracks, and besides, it wasn’t any kind of\nuse my trying to get into the streets.  I had had you in my mind all\nday, and there seemed nothing to do but to make an appeal to you.\nI watched from my window till I saw you come home, and then\nslipped down the stair to meet you ...  There, Sir, I guess you\nknow about as much as me of this business.’",
        "He sat blinking like an owl, fluttering with nerves and yet\ndesperately determined.  By this time I was pretty well convinced\nthat he was going straight with me.  It was the wildest sort of\nnarrative, but I had heard in my time many steep tales which had\nturned out to be true, and I had made a practice of judging the man\nrather than the story.  If he had wanted to get a location in my flat,\nand then cut my throat, he would have pitched a milder yarn.",
        "’Hand me your key,’ I said, ’and I’ll take a look at the corpse.\nExcuse my caution, but I’m bound to verify a bit if I can.’",
        "He shook his head mournfully.  ’I reckoned you’d ask for that,\nbut I haven’t got it.  It’s on my chain on the dressing-table.  I had to\nleave it behind, for I couldn’t leave any clues to breed suspicions.\nThe gentry who are after me are pretty bright-eyed citizens.  You’ll\nhave to take me on trust for the night, and tomorrow you’ll get\nproof of the corpse business right enough.’",
        "I thought for an instant or two.  ’Right.  I’ll trust you for the\nnight.  I’ll lock you into this room and keep the key.  Just one word,\nMr Scudder.  I believe you’re straight, but if so be you are not I\nshould warn you that I’m a handy man with a gun.’",
        "’Sure,’ he said, jumping up with some briskness.  ’I haven’t the\nprivilege of your name, Sir, but let me tell you that you’re a white\nman.  I’ll thank you to lend me a razor.’",
        "I took him into my bedroom and turned him loose.  In half an\nhour’s time a figure came out that I scarcely recognized.  Only his\ngimlety, hungry eyes were the same.  He was shaved clean, his hair\nwas parted in the middle, and he had cut his eyebrows.  Further, he\ncarried himself as if he had been drilled, and was the very model,\neven to the brown complexion, of some British officer who had\nhad a long spell in India.  He had a monocle, too, which he stuck in\nhis eye, and every trace of the American had gone out of his speech.",
        "’My hat!  Mr Scudder–’ I stammered.",
        "’Not Mr Scudder,’ he corrected; ’Captain Theophilus Digby, of\nthe 40th Gurkhas, presently home on leave.  I’ll thank you to\nremember that, Sir.’",
        "I made him up a bed in my smoking-room and sought my own\ncouch, more cheerful than I had been for the past month.  Things\ndid happen occasionally, even in this God-forgotten metropolis.",
        "I woke next morning to hear my man, Paddock, making the deuce\nof a row at the smoking-room door.  Paddock was a fellow I had\ndone a good turn to out on the Selakwe, and I had inspanned him\nas my servant as soon as I got to England.  He had about as much\ngift of the gab as a hippopotamus, and was not a great hand at\nvaleting, but I knew I could count on his loyalty.",
        "’Stop that row, Paddock,’ I said.  ’There’s a friend of mine,\nCaptain–Captain’ (I couldn’t remember the name) ’dossing down\nin there.  Get breakfast for two and then come and speak to me.’",
        "I told Paddock a fine story about how my friend was a great\nswell, with his nerves pretty bad from overwork, who wanted\nabsolute rest and stillness.  Nobody had got to know he was here,\nor he would be besieged by communications from the India Office\nand the Prime Minister and his cure would be ruined.  I am bound\nto say Scudder played up splendidly when he came to breakfast.  He\nfixed Paddock with his eyeglass, just like a British officer, asked\nhim about the Boer War, and slung out at me a lot of stuff about\nimaginary pals.  Paddock couldn’t learn to call me ’Sir’, but he\n’sirred’ Scudder as if his life depended on it.",
        "I left him with the newspaper and a box of cigars, and went\ndown to the City till luncheon.  When I got back the lift-man had an\nimportant face.",
        "’Nawsty business ’ere this morning, Sir.  Gent in No.  15 been and\nshot ’isself.  They’ve just took ’im to the mortiary.  The police are\nup there now.’",
        "I ascended to No.  15, and found a couple of bobbies and an\ninspector busy making an examination.  I asked a few idiotic questions,\nand they soon kicked me out.  Then I found the man that had\nvaleted Scudder, and pumped him, but I could see he suspected\nnothing.  He was a whining fellow with a churchyard face, and half-\na-crown went far to console him.",
        "I attended the inquest next day.  A partner of some publishing firm\ngave evidence that the deceased had brought him wood-pulp propositions,\nand had been, he believed, an agent of an American business.\nThe jury found it a case of suicide while of unsound mind, and the few\neffects were handed over to the American Consul to deal with.  I gave\nScudder a full account of the affair, and it interested him greatly.  He\nsaid he wished he could have attended the inquest, for he reckoned it\nwould be about as spicy as to read one’s own obituary notice.",
        "The first two days he stayed with me in that back room he was\nvery peaceful.  He read and smoked a bit, and made a heap of\njottings in a note-book, and every night we had a game of chess, at\nwhich he beat me hollow.  I think he was nursing his nerves back to\nhealth, for he had had a pretty trying time.  But on the third day I\ncould see he was beginning to get restless.  He fixed up a list of the\ndays till June 15th, and ticked each off with a red pencil, making\nremarks in shorthand against them.  I would find him sunk in a\nbrown study, with his sharp eyes abstracted, and after those spells\nof meditation he was apt to be very despondent.",
        "Then I could see that he began to get edgy again.  He listened for\nlittle noises, and was always asking me if Paddock could be trusted.\nOnce or twice he got very peevish, and apologized for it.  I didn’t\nblame him.  I made every allowance, for he had taken on a fairly\nstiff job.",
        "It was not the safety of his own skin that troubled him, but the\nsuccess of the scheme he had planned.  That little man was clean grit\nall through, without a soft spot in him.  One night he was very solemn.",
        "’Say, Hannay,’ he said, ’I judge I should let you a bit deeper into\nthis business.  I should hate to go out without leaving somebody\nelse to put up a fight.’  And he began to tell me in detail what I had\nonly heard from him vaguely.",
        "I did not give him very close attention.  The fact is, I was more\ninterested in his own adventures than in his high politics.  I reckoned\nthat Karolides and his affairs were not my business, leaving all that to\nhim.  So a lot that he said slipped clean out of my memory.  I remember\nthat he was very clear that the danger to Karolides would not begin\ntill he had got to London, and would come from the very highest\nquarters, where there would be no thought of suspicion.  He mentioned\nthe name of a woman–Julia Czechenyi–as having something\nto do with the danger.  She would be the decoy, I gathered, to get\nKarolides out of the care of his guards.  He talked, too, about a Black\nStone and a man that lisped in his speech, and he described very\nparticularly somebody that he never referred to without a shudder–\nan old man with a young voice who could hood his eyes like a hawk.",
        "He spoke a good deal about death, too.  He was mortally anxious\nabout winning through with his job, but he didn’t care a rush for\nhis life.",
        "’I reckon it’s like going to sleep when you are pretty well tired\nout, and waking to find a summer day with the scent of hay coming\nin at the window.  I used to thank God for such mornings way back\nin the Blue-Grass country, and I guess I’ll thank Him when I wake\nup on the other side of Jordan.’",
        "Next day he was much more cheerful, and read the life of Stonewall\nJackson much of the time.  I went out to dinner with a mining\nengineer I had got to see on business, and came back about half-past\nten in time for our game of chess before turning in.",
        "I had a cigar in my mouth, I remember, as I pushed open the\nsmoking-room door.  The lights were not lit, which struck me as\nodd.  I wondered if Scudder had turned in already.",
        "I snapped the switch, but there was nobody there.  Then I saw\nsomething in the far corner which made me drop my cigar and fall\ninto a cold sweat.",
        "My guest was lying sprawled on his back.  There was a long knife\nthrough his heart which skewered him to the floor.",
