        "Probably few people have been more successful in the discovering line than\nChristopher Columbus. Living as he did in a day when a great many things\nwere still in an undiscovered state, the horizon was filled with golden\nopportunities for a man possessed of Mr. C.’s pluck and ambition. His life\nat first was filled with rebuffs and disappointments, but at last he grew\nto be a man of importance in his own profession, and the people who wanted\nanything discovered would always bring it to him rather than take it\nelsewhere.",
        "And yet the life of Columbus was a stormy one. Though he discovered a\ncontinent wherein a millionaire attracts no attention, he himself was very\npoor.",
        "Though he rescued from barbarism a broad and beautiful land in whose\nmetropolis the theft of less than half a million of dollars is regarded as\npetty larceny, Chris himself often went to bed hungry. Is it not singular\nthat the gray-eyed and gentle Columbus should have added a hemisphere to\nthe history of our globe, a hemisphere, too, where pie is a common thing,\nnot only on Sunday, but throughout the week, and yet that he should have\ngone down to his grave pieless!",
        "Such is the history of progress in all ages and in all lines of thought\nand investigation. Such is the meagre reward of the pioneer in new fields\nof action.",
        "I presume that America to-day has a larger pie area than any other land in\nwhich the Cockney English language is spoken. Right here where millions of\nnative born Americans dwell, many of whom are ashamed of the fact that\nthey were born here and which shame is entirely mutual between the Goddess\nof Liberty and themselves, we have a style of pie that no other land can\nboast of.",
        "From the bleak and acid dried apple pie of Maine to the irrigated mince\npie of the blue Pacific, all along down the long line of igneous, volcanic\nand stratified pie, America, the land of the freedom bird with the high\ninstep to his nose, leads the world.",
        "Other lands may point with undissembled pride to their polygamy and their\ncholera, but we reck not. Our polygamy here is still in its infancy and\nour leprosy has had the disadvantage of a cold, backward spring, but look\nat our pie.",
        "Throughout a long and disastrous war, sometimes referred to as a\nfratricidal war, during which this fair land was drenched in blood, and\nalso during which aforesaid war numerous frightful blunders were made\nwhich are fast coming to the surface–through the courtesy of participants\nin said war who have patiently waited for those who blundered to die off,\nand now admit that said participants who are dead did blunder exceedingly\nthroughout all this long and deadly struggle for the supremacy of liberty\nand right–as I was about to say when my mind began to wobble, the\nAmerican pie has shown forth resplendent in the full glare of a noonday\nsun or beneath the pale-green of the electric light, and she stands forth\nproudly to-day with her undying loyalty to dyspepsia untrammeled and her\ndeep and deadly gastric antipathy still fiercely burning in her breast.",
        "That is the proud history of American pie. Powers, principalities,\nkingdoms and hand-made dynasties may crumble, but the republican form of\npie does not crumble. Tyranny may totter on its throne, but the American\npie does not totter. Not a tot. No foreign threat has ever been able to\nmake our common chicken pie quail. I do not say this because it is smart;\nI simply say it to fill up.",
        "But would it not do Columbus good to come among us to-day and look over\nour free institutions? Would it not please him to ride over this continent\nwhich has been rescued by his presence of mind from the thraldom of\nbarbarism and forked over to the genial and refining influences of\nprohibition and pie?",
        "America fills no mean niche in the great history of nations, and if you\nlisten carefully for a few moments you will hear some American, with his\nmouth full of pie, make that remark. The American is always frank and\nperfectly free to state that no other country can approach this one. We\nallow no little two-for-a-quarter monarchy to excel us in the size of our\nfailures or in the calm and self-poised deliberation with which we erect a\nmonument to the glory of a worthy citizen who is dead, and therefore\npolitically useless.",
        "The careless student of the career of Columbus will find much in these\nlines that he has not yet seen. He will realize when he comes to read this\nlittle sketch the pains and the trouble and the research necessary before\nsuch an article on the life and work of Columbus could be written, and he\nwill thank me for it; but it is not for that that I have done it. It is a\npleasure for me to hunt up and arrange historical and biographical data in\na pleasing form for the student and savant. I am only too glad to please\nand gratify the student and the savant. I was that way myself once and I\nknow how to sympathize with them,",
        "P.S.–I neglected to state that Columbus was a married man. Still, he did\nnot murmur or repine.",
