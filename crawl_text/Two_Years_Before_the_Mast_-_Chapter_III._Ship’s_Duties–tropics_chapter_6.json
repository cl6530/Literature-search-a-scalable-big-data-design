        "As we had now a long “spell” of fine weather, without any incident\nto break the monotony of our lives, there can be no better place to\ndescribe the duties, regulations, and customs of an American merchantman,\nof which ours was a fair specimen.",
        "The captain, in the first place, is lord paramount.  He stands no watch,\ncomes and goes when he pleases, and is accountable to no one, and must\nbe obeyed in everything, without a question, even from his chief officer.\nHe has the power to turn his officers off duty, and even to break them\nand make them do duty as sailors in the forecastle.  When there are no\npassengers and no supercargo, as in our vessel, he has no companion\nbut his own dignity, and no pleasures, unless he differs from most\nof his kind, but the consciousness of possessing supreme power, and,\noccasionally, the exercise of it.",
        "The prime minister, the official organ, and the active and superintending\nofficer, is the chief mate.  He is first lieutenant, boatswain,\nsailing-master, and quarter-master.  The captain tells him what\nhe wishes to have done, and leaves to him the care of overseeing,\nof allotting the work, and also the responsibility of its being\nwell done.  The mate (as he is always called, par excellence)\nalso keeps the log-book, for which he is responsible to the owners\nand insurers, and has the charge of the stowage, safe keeping, and\ndelivery of the cargo.  He is also, ex-officio, the wit of the crew;\nfor the captain does not condescend to joke with the men, and the\nsecond mate no one cares for; so that when “the mate” thinks fit to\nentertain “the people” with a coarse joke or a little practical wit,\nevery one feels bound to laugh.",
        "The second mate’s is proverbially a dog’s berth.  He is neither\nofficer nor man.  The men do not respect him as an officer, and he\nis obliged to go aloft to reef and furl the topsails, and to put\nhis hands into the tar and slush, with the rest.  The crew call\nhim the “sailor’s waiter,” as he has to furnish them with spun-yarn,\nmarline, and all other stuffs that they need in their work, and has\ncharge of the boatswain’s locker, which includes serving-boards,\nmarline-spikes, etc.  He is expected by the captain to maintain\nhis dignity and to enforce obedience, and still is kept at a great\ndistance from the mate, and obliged to work with the crew.  He is\none to whom little is given and of whom much is required.  His wages\nare usually double those of a common sailor, and he eats and sleeps\nin the cabin; but he is obliged to be on deck nearly all the time,\nand eats at the second table, that is, makes a meal out of what the\ncaptain and chief mate leave.",
        "The steward is the captain’s servant, and has charge of the pantry,\nfrom which every one, even the mate himself, is excluded.  These\ndistinctions usually find him an enemy in the mate, who does not\nlike to have any one on board who is not entirely under his control;\nthe crew do not consider him as one of their number, so he is left\nto the mercy of the captain.",
        "The cook is the patron of the crew, and those who are in his favor\ncan get their wet mittens and stockings dried, or light their pipes\nat the galley on the night watch.  These two worthies, together\nwith the carpenter and sailmaker, if there be one, stand no watch,\nbut, being employed all day, are allowed to “sleep in” at night,\nunless all hands are called.",
        "The crew are divided into two divisions, as equally as may be, called\nthe watches.  Of these the chief mate commands the larboard, and the\nsecond mate the starboard.  They divide the time between them, being\non and off duty, or, as it is called, on deck and below, every other\nfour hours.  If, for instance, the chief mate with the larboard watch\nhave the first night-watch from eight to twelve; at the end of the\nfour hours, the starboard watch is called, and the second mate takes\nthe deck, while the larboard watch and the first mate go below until\nfour in the morning, when they come on deck again and remain until\neight; having what is called the morning watch.  As they will have\nbeen on deck eight hours out of the twelve, while those who had the\nmiddle watch–from twelve to four, will only have been up four hours,\nthey have what is called a “forenoon watch below,” that is, from\neight, A.M., till twelve, M.  In a man-of-war, and in some merchantmen,\nthis alteration of watches is kept up throughout the twenty-four hours;\nbut our ship, like most merchantmen, had “all hands” from twelve o’clock\ntill dark, except in bad weather, when we had “watch and watch.”",
        "An explanation of the “dog watches” may, perhaps, be of use to one\nwho has never been at sea.  They are to shift the watches each\nnight, so that the same watch need not be on deck at the same hours.\nIn order to effect this, the watch from four to eight, P.M.,\nis divided into two half, or dog watches, one from four to six,\nand the other from six to eight.  By this means they divide the\ntwenty-four hours into seven watches instead of six, and thus\nshift the hours every night.  As the dog watches come during twilight,\nafter the day’s work is done, and before the night watch is set, they\nare the watches in which everybody is on deck.  The captain is up,\nwalking on the weather side of the quarter-deck, the chief mate is\non the lee side, and the second mate about the weather gangway.\nThe steward has finished his work in the cabin, and has come up to\nsmoke his pipe with the cook in the galley.  The crew are sitting on\nthe windlass or lying on the forecastle, smoking, singing, or telling\nlong yarns.  At eight o’clock, eight bells are struck, the log is hove,\nthe watch set, the wheel relieved, the galley shut up, and the other\nwatch goes below.",
        "The morning commences with the watch on deck’s “turning-to” at\nday-break and washing down, scrubbing, and swabbing the decks.\nThis, together with filling the “scuttled butt” with fresh water,\nand coiling up the rigging, usually occupies the time until seven\nbells, (half after seven,) when all hands get breakfast.  At eight,\nthe day’s work begins, and lasts until sun-down, with the exception\nof an hour for dinner.",
        "Before I end my explanations, it may be well to define a day’s work,\nand to correct a mistake prevalent among landsmen about a sailor’s\nlife.  Nothing is more common than to hear people say–\"Are not sailors\nvery idle at sea?–what can they find to do?”  This is a very natural\nmistake, and being very frequently made, it is one which every sailor\nfeels interested in having corrected.  In the first place, then, the\ndiscipline of the ship requires every man to be at work upon something\nwhen he is on deck, except at night and on Sundays.  Except at these\ntimes, you will never see a man, on board a well-ordered vessel,\nstanding idle on deck, sitting down, or leaning over the side.\nIt is the officers’ duty to keep every one at work, even if there\nis nothing to be done but to scrape the rust from the chain cables.\nIn no state prison are the convicts more regularly set to work, and\nmore closely watched.  No conversation is allowed among the crew at\ntheir duty, and though they frequently do talk when aloft, or when\nnear one another, yet they always stop when an officer is nigh.",
        "With regard to the work upon which the men are put, it is a matter\nwhich probably would not be understood by one who has not been at\nsea.  When I first left port, and found that we were kept regularly\nemployed for a week or two, I supposed that we were getting the vessel\ninto sea trim, and that it would soon be over, and we should have\nnothing to do but sail the ship; but I found that it continued so\nfor two years, and at the end of the two years there was as much to\nbe done as ever.  As has often been said, a ship is like a lady’s\nwatch, always out of repair.  When first leaving port, studding-sail\ngear is to be rove, all the running rigging to be examined, that\nwhich is unfit for use to be got down, and new rigging rove in its\nplace: then the standing rigging is to be overhauled, replaced,\nand repaired, in a thousand different ways; and wherever any of\nthe numberless ropes or the yards are chafing or wearing upon it,\nthere “chafing gear,” as it is called, must be put on.  This chafing\ngear consists of worming, parcelling, roundings, battens, and service\nof all kinds–both rope-yarns, spun-yarn, marline and seizing-stuffs.\nTaking off, putting on, and mending the chafing gear alone, upon a\nvessel, would find constant employment for two or three men, during\nworking hours, for a whole voyage.",
        "The next point to be considered is, that all the “small stuffs” which\nare used on board a ship–such as spun-yarn, marline, seizing-stuff,\netc.–are made on board.  The owners of a vessel buy up incredible\nquantities of “old junk,” which the sailors unlay, after drawing out\nthe yarns, knot them together, and roll them up in balls.  These\n“rope-yarns” are constantly used for various purposes, but the\ngreater part is manufactured into spun-yarn.  For this purpose\nevery vessel is furnished with a “spun-yarn winch;” which is very\nsimple, consisting of a wheel and spindle.  This may be heard\nconstantly going on deck in pleasant weather; and we had employment,\nduring a great part of the time, for three hands in drawing and\nknotting yarns, and making them spun-yarn.",
        "Another method of employing the crew is, “setting up” rigging.\nWhenever any of the standing rigging becomes slack, (which is\ncontinually happening), the seizings and coverings must be taken\noff, tackles got up, and after the rigging is bowsed well taught,\nthe seizings and coverings replaced; which is a very nice piece of work.\nThere is also such a connection between different parts of a vessel,\nthat one rope can seldom be touched without altering another.\nYou cannot stay a mast aft by the back stays, without slacking up\nthe head stays, etc.  If we add to this all the tarring, greasing,\noiling, varnishing, painting, scraping, and scrubbing which is\nrequired in the course of a long voyage, and also remember this\nis all to be done in addition to watching at night, steering,\nreefing, furling, bracing, making and setting sail, and pulling,\nhauling, and climbing in every direction, one will hardly ask,\n“What can a sailor find to do at sea?”",
        "If, after all this labor–after exposing their lives and limbs in\nstorms, wet and cold,",
        "   “Wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch;\n    The lion and the belly-pinched wolf\n    Keep their fur dry;–”",
        "the merchants and captain think that they have not earned their\ntwelve dollars a month, (out of which they clothe themselves,) and\ntheir salt beef and hard bread, they keep them picking oakum–\nad infinitum.  This is the usual resource upon a rainy day, for\nthen it will not do to work upon rigging; and when it is pouring\ndown in floods, instead of letting the sailors stand about in\nsheltered places, and talk, and keep themselves comfortable,\nthey are separated to different parts of the ship and kept at\nwork picking oakum.  I have seen oakum stuff placed about in\ndifferent parts of the ship, so that the sailors might not be\nidle in the snatches between the frequent squalls upon crossing\nthe equator.  Some officers have been so driven to find work for\nthe crew in a ship ready for sea, that they have set them to\npounding the anchors (often done) and scraping the chain cables.\nThe “Philadelphia Catechism” is,",
        "“Six days shalt thou labor and do all thou art able,\n And on the seventh–holystone the decks and scrape the cable.”",
        "This kind of work, of course, is not kept up off Cape Horn,\nCape of Good Hope, and in extreme north and south latitudes;\nbut I have seen the decks washed down and scrubbed, when the\nwater would have frozen if it had been fresh; and all hands\nkept at work upon the rigging, when we had on our pea-jackets,\nand our hands so numb that we could hardly hold our marline-spikes.",
        "I have here gone out of my narrative course in order that any who\nread this may form as correct an idea of a sailor’s life and duty\nas possible.  I have done it in this place because, for some time,\nour life was nothing but the unvarying repetition of these duties,\nwhich can be better described together.  Before leaving this\ndescription, however, I would state, in order to show landsmen how\nlittle they know of the nature of a ship, that a ship-carpenter\nis kept in constant employ during good weather on board vessels\nwhich are in, what is called, perfect sea order.",
