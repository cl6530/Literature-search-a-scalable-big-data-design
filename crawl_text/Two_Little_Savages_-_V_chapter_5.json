        "The Collarless Stranger",
        "  Oh, sympathy! the noblest gift of God to man.\n  The greatest bond there is twixt man and man.\n  The strongest link in any friendship chain.\n  The single lasting hold in kinship’s claim.\n  The only incorrosive strand in marriage bonds.\n  The blazing torch where genius lights her lamp.\n  The ten times noble base of noblest love.\n  More deep than love–more strong than hate–the biggest thing\n  in all the universe–the law of laws.\n  Grant but this greatest gift of God to man–this single link\n  concatenating grant, and all the rest are worthless or comprised.",
        "Each year the ancient springtime madness came more strongly on Yan.\nEach year he was less inclined to resist it, and one glorious day of\nlate April in its twelfth return he had wandered northward along to a\nlittle wood a couple of miles from the town. It was full of unnamed\nflowers and voices and mysteries. Every tree and thicket had a\nvoice–a long ditch full of water had many that called to him.\n“_Peep-peep-peep,” they seemed to say in invitation for him to\ncome and see. He crawled again and again to the ditch and watched\nand waited. The loud whistle would sound only a few rods away,\n“_Peep-peep-peep,” but ceased at each spot when he came\nnear–sometimes before him, sometimes behind, but never where he was.\nHe searched through a small pool with his hands, sifted out sticks and\nleaves, but found nothing else. A farmer going by told him it was only\na “spring Peeper,” whatever that was, “some kind of a critter in the\nwater.”",
        "Under a log not far away Yan found a little Lizard that tumbled out of\nsight into a hole. It was the only living thing there, so he decided\nthat the “Peeper” must be a “Whistling Lizard.” But he was determined\nto see them when they were calling. How was it that the ponds all\naround should be full of them calling to him and playing hide and seek\nand yet defying his most careful search? The voices ceased as soon as\nhe came near, to be gradually renewed in the pools he had left. His\npresence was a husher. He lay for a long time watching a pool, but\nnone of the voices began again in range of his eye. At length, after\nrealizing that they were avoiding him, he crawled to a very noisy pond\nwithout showing himself, and nearer and yet nearer until he was within\nthree feet of a loud peeper in the floating grass. He located the spot\nwithin a few inches and yet could see nothing. He was utterly baffled,\nand lay there puzzling over it, when suddenly all the near Peepers\nstopped, and Yan was startled by a footfall; and looking around, he\nsaw a man within a few feet, watching him.",
        "Yan reddened–a stranger was always an enemy; he had a natural\naversion to all such, and stared awkwardly as though caught in crime.",
        "The man, a curious looking middle-aged person, was in shabby clothes\nand wore no collar. He had a tin box strapped on his bent shoulders,\nand in his hands was a long-handled net. His features, smothered in a\ngrizzly beard, were very prominent and rugged. They gave evidence of\nintellectual force, with some severity, but his gray-blue eyes had a\nkindly look.",
        "He had on a common, unbecoming, hard felt hat, and when he raised it\nto admit the pleasant breeze Yan saw that the wearer had hair like his\nown–a coarse, paleolithic mane, piled on his rugged brow, like a mass\nof seaweed lodged on some storm-beaten rock.",
        "“F’what are ye fynding, my lad?” said he in tones whose gentleness was\nin no way obscured by a strong Scottish tang.",
        "Still resenting somewhat the stranger’s presence, Yan said:",
        "“I’m not finding anything; I am only trying to see what that Whistling\nLizard is like.”",
        "The stranger’s eyes twinkled. “Forty years ago Ah was laying by a pool\njust as Ah seen ye this morning, looking and trying hard to read the\nriddle of the spring Peeper. Ah lay there all day, aye, and mony\nanither day, yes, it was nigh onto three years before Ah found it oot.\nAh’ll be glad to save ye seeking as long as Ah did, if that’s yer\nmind. Ah’ll show ye the Peeper.”",
        "Then he raked carefully among the leaves near the ditch, and soon\ncaptured a tiny Frog, less than an inch long.",
        "“Ther’s your Whistling Lizard: he no a Lizard at all, but a Froggie.\nBook men call him Hyla pickeringii, an’ a gude Scotchman he’d\nmake, for ye see the St. Andrew’s cross on his wee back. Ye see the\nwhistling ones in the water put on’y their beaks oot an’ is hard to\nsee. Then they sinks to the bottom when ye come near. But you tak\nthis’n home and treat him well and ye’ll see him blow out his throat\nas big as himsel’ an’ whistle like a steam engine.”",
        "Yan thawed out now. He told about the Lizard he had seen.",
        "“That wasna a Lizard; Ah niver see thim aboot here. It must a been\na two-striped Spelerpes. A Spelerpes is nigh kin to a\nFrog–a kind of dry-land tadpole, while a Lizard is only a Snake with\nlegs.”",
        "This was light from heaven. All Yan’s distrust was gone. He warmed to\nthe stranger. He plied him with questions; he told of his getting the\nBird Book. Oh, how the stranger did snort at “that driveling trash.\"\nYan talked of his perplexities. He got a full hearing and intelligent\nanswers. His mystery of the black ground-bird with a brown mate was\nresolved into the Common Towhee. The unknown wonderful voice in the\nspring morning, sending out its ’cluck, cluck, cluck, clucker,\"\nin the distant woods, the large gray Woodpecker that bored in some\nhigh stub and flew in a blaze of gold, and the wonderful spotted bird\nwith red head and yellow wings and tail in the taxidermist’s window,\nwere all resolved into one and the same–the Flicker or Golden-winged\nWoodpecker. The Hang-nest and the Oriole became one. The unknown\npoisonous-looking blue Hornet, that sat on the mud with palpitating\nbody, and the strange, invisible thing that made the mud-nests inside\nold outbuildings and crammed them with crippled Spiders, were both\nidentified as the Mud-wasp or Pelopæus.",
        "A black Butterfly flew over, and Yan learned that it was a Camberwell\nBeauty, or, scientifically, a Vanessa antiopa, and that this\none must have hibernated to be seen so early in the spring, and yet\nmore, that this beautiful creature was the glorified spirit of the\ncommon brown and black spiney Caterpillar.",
        "The Wild Pigeons were flying high above them in great flocks as they\nsat there, and Yan learned of their great nesting places in the far\nSouth, and of their wonderful but exact migrations without regard to\nanything but food; their northward migration to gather the winged nuts\nof the Slippery Elm in Canada; their August flight to the rice-fields\nof Carolina; their Mississippi Valley pilgrimage when the acorns and\nbeech-mast were falling ripe.",
        "What a rich, full morning that was. Everything seemed to turn up for\nthem. As they walked over a piney hill, two large birds sprang from\nthe ground and whirred through the trees.",
        "“Ruffed Grouse or ’patridge’, as the farmers call them. There’s a pair\nlives nigh aboots here. They come on this bank for the Wintergreen\nberries.”",
        "And Yan was quick to pull and taste them. He filled his pockets with\nthe aromatic plant–berries and all–and chewed it as he went. While\nthey walked, a faint, far drum-thump fell on their ears. “What’s\nthat?” he exclaimed, ever on the alert. The stranger listened and\nsaid:",
        "“That’s the bird ye ha’ just seen; that’s the Cock Partridge drumming\nfor his mate.”",
        "The Pewee of his early memories became the Phoebe of books. That day\nhis brookside singer became the Song-sparrow; the brown triller, the\nVeery Thrush. The Trilliums, white and red, the Dogtooth Violet, the\nSpring-beauty, the Trailing Arbutus–all for the first time got\nnames and became real friends, instead of elusive and beautiful, but\ndepressing mysteries.",
        "The stranger warmed, too, and his rugged features glowed; he saw in\nYan one minded like himself, tormented with the knowledge-hunger, as\nin youth he himself had been; and now it was a priceless privilege to\nsave the boy some of what he had suffered. His gratitude to Yan grew\nfervid, and Yan–he took in every word; nothing that he heard was\nforgotten. He was in a dream, for he had found at last the greatest\nthing on earth–sympathy–broad, intelligent, comprehensive sympathy.",
        "That spring morning was ever after like a new epoch in Yan’s mind–not\nhis memory, that was a thing of the past–but in his mind, his living\npresent.",
        "And the strongest, realest thing in it all was, not the rugged\nstranger with his kind ways, not the new birds and plants, but the\nsmell of the Wintergreen.",
        "Smell’s appeal to the memory is far better, stronger, more real than\nthat of any other sense. The Indians know this; many of them, in time,\nfind out the smell that conjures up their happiest hours, and keep it\nby them in the medicine bag. It is very real and dear to them–that\nhandful of Pine needles, that lump of Rat-musk, or that piece of\nSpruce gum. It adds the crown of happy memory to their reveries.",
        "And yet this belief is one of the first attacked by silly White-men,\nwho profess to enlighten the Red-man’s darkness. They, in their\nignorance, denounce it as absurd, while men of science know its simple\ntruth.",
        "Yan did not know that he had stumbled on a secret of the Indian\nmedicine bag. But ever afterward that wonderful day was called back to\nhim, conjured up by his “medicine,” this simple, natural magic, the\nsmell of the Wintergreen.",
        "He appreciated that morning more than he could tell, and yet he did a\ncharacteristic foolish thing, that put him in a wrong light and left\nhim so in the stranger’s mind.",
        "It was past noon. They had long lingered; the Stranger spoke of the\nmany things he had at home; then at length said he must be going.\n“Weel, good-by, laddie; Ah hope Ah’ll see you again.” He held out his\nhand. Yan shook it warmly; but he was dazed with thinking and with\nreaction; his diffidence and timidity were strong; he never rose to\nthe stranger’s veiled offer. He let him go without even learning his\nname or address.",
        "When it was too late, Yan awoke to his blunder. He haunted all those\nwoods in hopes of chancing on him there again, but he never did.",
