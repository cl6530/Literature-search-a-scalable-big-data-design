        "VIRTUE is like a rich stone, best plain set; and\nsurely virtue is best, in a body that is comely,\nthough not of delicate features; and that hath\nrather dignity of presence, than beauty of aspect.\nNeither is it almost seen, that very beautiful persons are otherwise of great virtue; as if nature were\nrather busy, not to err, than in labor to produce\nexcellency.  And therefore they prove accomplished, but not of great spirit; and study rather\nbehavior, than virtue.  But this holds not always:\nfor Augustus Caesar, Titus Vespasianus, Philip le\nBelle of France, Edward the Fourth of England,\nAlcibiades of Athens, Ismael the Sophy of Persia,\nwere all high and great spirits; and yet the most\nbeautiful men of their times.  In beauty, that of\nfavor, is more than that of color; and that of decent\nand gracious motion, more than that of favor.  That\nis the best part of beauty, which a picture cannot\nexpress; no, nor the first sight of the life.  There is no\nexcellent beauty, that hath not some strangeness\nin the proportion.  A man cannot tell whether\nApelles, or Albert Durer, were the more trifler;\nwhereof the one, would make a personage by geometrical proportions; the other, by taking the best\nparts out of divers faces, to make one excellent.\nSuch personages, I think, would please nobody,\nbut the painter that made them.  Not but I think a\npainter may make a better face than ever was; but\nhe must do it by a kind of felicity (as a musician\nthat maketh an excellent air in music), and not by\nrule.  A man shall see faces, that if you examine\nthem part by part, you shall find never a good;\nand yet altogether do well.  If it be true that the\nprincipal part of beauty is in decent motion, certainly it is no marvel, though persons in years\nseem many times more amiable; pulchrorum\nautumnus pulcher; for no youth can be comely\nbut by pardon, and considering the youth, as to\nmake up the comeliness.  Beauty is as summer\nfruits,) which are easy to corrupt, and cannot last;\nand for the most part it makes a dissolute youth,\nand an age a little out of countenance; but yet certainly again, if it light well, it maketh virtue shine,\nand vices blush.",
