        "Beyond Good and Evil\nBy Friedrich Nietzsche\nPresented by\nAuthorama\nPublic Domain Books View chapter by chapter ...\n\nPreface\nSUPPOSING that Truth is a woman—what then? Is there not ground\nfor suspecting that all philosophers, in so far as they have been\ndogmatists, have failed to understand women—that the terrible\nseriousness and clumsy importunity with which they have usually\npaid their addresses to Truth, have been unskilled and unseemly\nmethods for winning a woman? Certainly she has never allowed\nherself to be won; and at present every kind of dogma stands with\nsad and discouraged mien—IF, indeed, it stands at all! For there\nare scoffers who maintain that it has fallen, that all dogma lies\non the ground—nay more, that it is at its last gasp. But to\nspeak seriously, there are good grounds for hoping that all\ndogmatizing in philosophy, whatever solemn, whatever conclusive\nand decided airs it has assumed, may have been only a noble\npuerilism and tyronism; and probably the time is at hand when it\nwill be once and again understood WHAT has actually sufficed for\nthe basis of such imposing and absolute philosophical edifices as\nthe dogmatists have hitherto reared: perhaps some popular\nsuperstition of immemorial time (such as the soul-superstition,\nwhich, in the form of subject- and ego-superstition, has not yet\nceased doing mischief): perhaps some play upon words, a deception\non the part of grammar, or an audacious generalization of very\nrestricted, very personal, very human—all-too-human facts. The\nphilosophy of the dogmatists, it is to be hoped, was only a\npromise for thousands of years afterwards, as was astrology in\nstill earlier times, in the service of which probably more\nlabour, gold, acuteness, and patience have been spent than on any\nactual science hitherto: we owe to it, and to its “super-\nterrestrial” pretensions in Asia and Egypt, the grand style of\narchitecture. It seems that in order to inscribe themselves upon\nthe heart of humanity with everlasting claims, all great things\nhave first to wander about the earth as enormous and awe-\ninspiring caricatures: dogmatic philosophy has been a caricature\nof this kind—for instance, the Vedanta doctrine in Asia, and\nPlatonism in Europe. Let us not be ungrateful to it, although it\nmust certainly be confessed that the worst, the most tiresome,\nand the most dangerous of errors hitherto has been a dogmatist\nerror—namely, Plato’s invention of Pure Spirit and the Good in\nItself. But now when it has been surmounted, when Europe, rid of\nthis nightmare, can again draw breath freely and at least enjoy a\nhealthier—sleep, we, WHOSE DUTY IS WAKEFULNESS ITSELF, are the\nheirs of all the strength which the struggle against this error\nhas fostered. It amounted to the very inversion of truth, and the\ndenial of the PERSPECTIVE—the fundamental condition—of life, to\nspeak of Spirit and the Good as Plato spoke of them; indeed one\nmight ask, as a physician: “How did such a malady attack that\nfinest product of antiquity, Plato? Had the wicked Socrates\nreally corrupted him? Was Socrates after all a corrupter of\nyouths, and deserved his hemlock?” But the struggle against\nPlato, or—to speak plainer, and for the “people\"—the struggle\nagainst the ecclesiastical oppression of millenniums of\nChristianity (FOR CHRISITIANITY IS PLATONISM FOR THE “PEOPLE”),\nproduced in Europe a magnificent tension of soul, such as had not\nexisted anywhere previously; with such a tensely strained bow one\ncan now aim at the furthest goals. As a matter of fact, the\nEuropean feels this tension as a state of distress, and twice\nattempts have been made in grand style to unbend the bow: once by\nmeans of Jesuitism, and the second time by means of democratic\nenlightenment—which, with the aid of liberty of the press and\nnewspaper-reading, might, in fact, bring it about that the spirit\nwould not so easily find itself in “distress”! (The Germans\ninvented gunpowder-all credit to them! but they again made things\nsquare—they invented printing.) But we, who are neither Jesuits,\nnor democrats, nor even sufficiently Germans, we GOOD EUROPEANS,\nand free, VERY free spirits—we have it still, all the distress\nof spirit and all the tension of its bow! And perhaps also the\narrow, the duty, and, who knows? THE GOAL TO AIM AT. . . .\nSils Maria Upper Engadine, JUNE, 1885.\nChapter I: Prejudices of Philosophers\n\n1. The Will to Truth, which is to tempt us to many a hazardous\nenterprise, the famous Truthfulness of which all philosophers\nhave hitherto spoken with respect, what questions has this Will\nto Truth not laid before us! What strange, perplexing,\nquestionable questions! It is already a long story; yet it seems\nas if it were hardly commenced. Is it any wonder if we at last\ngrow distrustful, lose patience, and turn impatiently away? That\nthis Sphinx teaches us at last to ask questions ourselves? WHO is\nit really that puts questions to us here? WHAT really is this\n\"Will to Truth” in us? In fact we made a long halt at the\nquestion as to the origin of this Will—until at last we came to\nan absolute standstill before a yet more fundamental question. We\ninquired about the VALUE of this Will. Granted that we want the\ntruth: WHY NOT RATHER untruth? And uncertainty? Even ignorance?\nThe problem of the value of truth presented itself before us—or\nwas it we who presented ourselves before the problem? Which of us\nis the Oedipus here? Which the Sphinx? It would seem to be a\nrendezvous of questions and notes of interrogation. And could it\nbe believed that it at last seems to us as if the problem had\nnever been propounded before, as if we were the first to discern\nit, get a sight of it, and RISK RAISING it? For there is risk in\nraising it, perhaps there is no greater risk.\n2. “HOW COULD anything originate out of its opposite? For\nexample, truth out of error? or the Will to Truth out of the will\nto deception? or the generous deed out of selfishness? or the\npure sun-bright vision of the wise man out of covetousness? Such\ngenesis is impossible; whoever dreams of it is a fool, nay, worse\nthan a fool; things of the highest value must have a different\norigin, an origin of THEIR own—in this transitory, seductive,\nillusory, paltry world, in this turmoil of delusion and cupidity,\nthey cannot have their source. But rather in the lap of Being, in\nthe intransitory, in the concealed God, in the ’Thing-in-itself—\nTHERE must be their source, and nowhere else!\"—This mode of\nreasoning discloses the typical prejudice by which metaphysicians\nof all times can be recognized, this mode of valuation is at the\nback of all their logical procedure; through this “belief” of\ntheirs, they exert themselves for their “knowledge,” for\nsomething that is in the end solemnly christened “the Truth.” The\nfundamental belief of metaphysicians is THE BELIEF IN ANTITHESES\nOF VALUES. It never occurred even to the wariest of them to doubt\nhere on the very threshold (where doubt, however, was most\nnecessary); though they had made a solemn vow, “DE OMNIBUS\nDUBITANDUM.” For it may be doubted, firstly, whether antitheses\nexist at all; and secondly, whether the popular valuations and\nantitheses of value upon which metaphysicians have set their\nseal, are not perhaps merely superficial estimates, merely\nprovisional perspectives, besides being probably made from some\ncorner, perhaps from below—\"frog perspectives,” as it were, to\nborrow an expression current among painters. In spite of all the\nvalue which may belong to the true, the positive, and the\nunselfish, it might be possible that a higher and more\nfundamental value for life generally should be assigned to\npretence, to the will to delusion, to selfishness, and cupidity.\nIt might even be possible that WHAT constitutes the value of\nthose good and respected things, consists precisely in their\nbeing insidiously related, knotted, and crocheted to these evil\nand apparently opposed things—perhaps even in being essentially\nidentical with them. Perhaps! But who wishes to concern himself\nwith such dangerous “Perhapses”! For that investigation one must\nawait the advent of a new order of philosophers, such as will\nhave other tastes and inclinations, the reverse of those hitherto\nprevalent—philosophers of the dangerous “Perhaps” in every sense\nof the term. And to speak in all seriousness, I see such new\nphilosophers beginning to appear.\n3. Having kept a sharp eye on philosophers, and having read\nbetween their lines long enough, I now say to myself that the\ngreater part of conscious thinking must be counted among the\ninstinctive functions, and it is so even in the case of\nphilosophical thinking; one has here to learn anew, as one\nlearned anew about heredity and “innateness.” As little as the\nact of birth comes into consideration in the whole process and\nprocedure of heredity, just as little is “being-conscious\"\nOPPOSED to the instinctive in any decisive sense; the greater\npart of the conscious thinking of a philosopher is secretly\ninfluenced by his instincts, and forced into definite channels.\nAnd behind all logic and its seeming sovereignty of movement,\nthere are valuations, or to speak more plainly, physiological\ndemands, for the maintenance of a definite mode of life For\nexample, that the certain is worth more than the uncertain, that\nillusion is less valuable than “truth” such valuations, in spite\nof their regulative importance for US, might notwithstanding be\nonly superficial valuations, special kinds of maiserie, such as\nmay be necessary for the maintenance of beings such as ourselves.\nSupposing, in effect, that man is not just the “measure of\nthings.”\n4. The falseness of an opinion is not for us any objection to it:\nit is here, perhaps, that our new language sounds most strangely.\nThe question is, how far an opinion is life-furthering, life-\npreserving, species-preserving, perhaps species-rearing, and we\nare fundamentally inclined to maintain that the falsest opinions\n(to which the synthetic judgments a priori belong), are the most\nindispensable to us, that without a recognition of logical\nfictions, without a comparison of reality with the purely\nIMAGINED world of the absolute and immutable, without a constant\ncounterfeiting of the world by means of numbers, man could not\nlive—that the renunciation of false opinions would be a\nrenunciation of life, a negation of life. TO RECOGNISE UNTRUTH AS\nA CONDITION OF LIFE; that is certainly to impugn the traditional\nideas of value in a dangerous manner, and a philosophy which\nventures to do so, has thereby alone placed itself beyond good\nand evil.\n5. That which causes philosophers to be regarded half-\ndistrustfully and half-mockingly, is not the oft-repeated\ndiscovery how innocent they are—how often and easily they make\nmistakes and lose their way, in short, how childish and childlike\nthey are,—but that there is not enough honest dealing with them,\nwhereas they all raise a loud and virtuous outcry when the\nproblem of truthfulness is even hinted at in the remotest manner.\nThey all pose as though their real opinions had been discovered\nand attained through the self-evolving of a cold, pure, divinely\nindifferent dialectic (in contrast to all sorts of mystics, who,\nfairer and foolisher, talk of “inspiration”), whereas, in fact, a\nprejudiced proposition, idea, or “suggestion,” which is generally\ntheir heart’s desire abstracted and refined, is defended by them\nwith arguments sought out after the event. They are all advocates\nwho do not wish to be regarded as such, generally astute\ndefenders, also, of their prejudices, which they dub “truths,\"—\nand VERY far from having the conscience which bravely admits this\nto itself, very far from having the good taste of the courage\nwhich goes so far as to let this be understood, perhaps to warn\nfriend or foe, or in cheerful confidence and self-ridicule. The\nspectacle of the Tartuffery of old Kant, equally stiff and\ndecent, with which he entices us into the dialectic by-ways that\nlead (more correctly mislead) to his “categorical imperative\"—\nmakes us fastidious ones smile, we who find no small amusement in\nspying out the subtle tricks of old moralists and ethical\npreachers. Or, still more so, the hocus-pocus in mathematical\nform, by means of which Spinoza has, as it were, clad his\nphilosophy in mail and mask—in fact, the “love of HIS wisdom,\"\nto translate the term fairly and squarely—in order thereby to\nstrike terror at once into the heart of the assailant who should\ndare to cast a glance on that invincible maiden, that Pallas\nAthene:—how much of personal timidity and vulnerability does\nthis masquerade of a sickly recluse betray!\n6. It has gradually become clear to me what every great\nphilosophy up till now has consisted of—namely, the confession\nof its originator, and a species of involuntary and unconscious\nauto-biography; and moreover that the moral (or immoral) purpose\nin every philosophy has constituted the true vital germ out of\nwhich the entire plant has always grown. Indeed, to understand\nhow the abstrusest metaphysical assertions of a philosopher have\nbeen arrived at, it is always well (and wise) to first ask\noneself: “What morality do they (or does he) aim at?\"\nAccordingly, I do not believe that an “impulse to knowledge” is\nthe father of philosophy; but that another impulse, here as\nelsewhere, has only made use of knowledge (and mistaken\nknowledge!) as an instrument. But whoever considers the\nfundamental impulses of man with a view to determining how far\nthey may have here acted as INSPIRING GENII (or as demons and\ncobolds), will find that they have all practiced philosophy at\none time or another, and that each one of them would have been\nonly too glad to look upon itself as the ultimate end of\nexistence and the legitimate LORD over all the other impulses.\nFor every impulse is imperious, and as SUCH, attempts to\nphilosophize. To be sure, in the case of scholars, in the case of\nreally scientific men, it may be otherwise—\"better,” if you\nwill; there there may really be such a thing as an “impulse to\nknowledge,” some kind of small, independent clock-work, which,\nwhen well wound up, works away industriously to that end, WITHOUT\nthe rest of the scholarly impulses taking any material part\ntherein. The actual “interests” of the scholar, therefore, are\ngenerally in quite another direction—in the family, perhaps, or\nin money-making, or in politics; it is, in fact, almost\nindifferent at what point of research his little machine is\nplaced, and whether the hopeful young worker becomes a good\nphilologist, a mushroom specialist, or a chemist; he is not\nCHARACTERISED by becoming this or that. In the philosopher, on\nthe contrary, there is absolutely nothing impersonal; and above\nall, his morality furnishes a decided and decisive testimony as\nto WHO HE IS,—that is to say, in what order the deepest impulses\nof his nature stand to each other.\n7. How malicious philosophers can be! I know of nothing more\nstinging than the joke Epicurus took the liberty of making on\nPlato and the Platonists; he called them Dionysiokolakes. In its\noriginal sense, and on the face of it, the word signifies\n\"Flatterers of Dionysius\"—consequently, tyrants’ accessories and\nlick-spittles; besides this, however, it is as much as to say,\n\"They are all ACTORS, there is nothing genuine about them” (for\nDionysiokolax was a popular name for an actor). And the latter is\nreally the malignant reproach that Epicurus cast upon Plato: he\nwas annoyed by the grandiose manner, the mise en scene style of\nwhich Plato and his scholars were masters—of which Epicurus was\nnot a master! He, the old school-teacher of Samos, who sat\nconcealed in his little garden at Athens, and wrote three hundred\nbooks, perhaps out of rage and ambitious envy of Plato, who\nknows! Greece took a hundred years to find out who the garden-god\nEpicurus really was. Did she ever find out?\n8. There is a point in every philosophy at which the “conviction\"\nof the philosopher appears on the scene; or, to put it in the\nwords of an ancient mystery:\nAdventavit asinus, Pulcher et fortissimus.\n9. You desire to LIVE “according to Nature”? Oh, you noble\nStoics, what fraud of words! Imagine to yourselves a being like\nNature, boundlessly extravagant, boundlessly indifferent, without\npurpose or consideration, without pity or justice, at once\nfruitful and barren and uncertain: imagine to yourselves\nINDIFFERENCE as a power—how COULD you live in accordance with\nsuch indifference? To live—is not that just endeavouring to be\notherwise than this Nature? Is not living valuing, preferring,\nbeing unjust, being limited, endeavouring to be different? And\ngranted that your imperative, “living according to Nature,” means\nactually the same as “living according to life\"—how could you do\nDIFFERENTLY? Why should you make a principle out of what you\nyourselves are, and must be? In reality, however, it is quite\notherwise with you: while you pretend to read with rapture the\ncanon of your law in Nature, you want something quite the\ncontrary, you extraordinary stage-players and self-deluders! In\nyour pride you wish to dictate your morals and ideals to Nature,\nto Nature herself, and to incorporate them therein; you insist\nthat it shall be Nature “according to the Stoa,” and would like\neverything to be made after your own image, as a vast, eternal\nglorification and generalism of Stoicism! With all your love for\ntruth, you have forced yourselves so long, so persistently, and\nwith such hypnotic rigidity to see Nature FALSELY, that is to\nsay, Stoically, that you are no longer able to see it otherwise—\nand to crown all, some unfathomable superciliousness gives you\nthe Bedlamite hope that BECAUSE you are able to tyrannize over\nyourselves—Stoicism is self-tyranny—Nature will also allow\nherself to be tyrannized over: is not the Stoic a PART of\nNature? . . . But this is an old and everlasting story: what\nhappened in old times with the Stoics still happens today, as\nsoon as ever a philosophy begins to believe in itself. It always\ncreates the world in its own image; it cannot do otherwise;\nphilosophy is this tyrannical impulse itself, the most spiritual\nWill to Power, the will to “creation of the world,” the will to\nthe causa prima.\n10. The eagerness and subtlety, I should even say craftiness,\nwith which the problem of “the real and the apparent world” is\ndealt with at present throughout Europe, furnishes food for\nthought and attention; and he who hears only a “Will to Truth” in\nthe background, and nothing else, cannot certainly boast of the\nsharpest ears. In rare and isolated cases, it may really have\nhappened that such a Will to Truth—a certain extravagant and\nadventurous pluck, a metaphysician’s ambition of the forlorn\nhope—has participated therein: that which in the end always\nprefers a handful of “certainty” to a whole cartload of beautiful\npossibilities; there may even be puritanical fanatics of\nconscience, who prefer to put their last trust in a sure nothing,\nrather than in an uncertain something. But that is Nihilism, and\nthe sign of a despairing, mortally wearied soul, notwithstanding\nthe courageous bearing such a virtue may display. It seems,\nhowever, to be otherwise with stronger and livelier thinkers who\nare still eager for life. In that they side AGAINST appearance,\nand speak superciliously of “perspective,” in that they rank the\ncredibility of their own bodies about as low as the credibility\nof the ocular evidence that “the earth stands still,” and thus,\napparently, allowing with complacency their securest possession\nto escape (for what does one at present believe in more firmly\nthan in one’s body?),—who knows if they are not really trying to\nwin back something which was formerly an even securer possession,\nsomething of the old domain of the faith of former times, perhaps\nthe “immortal soul,” perhaps “the old God,” in short, ideas by\nwhich they could live better, that is to say, more vigorously and\nmore joyously, than by “modern ideas”? There is DISTRUST of these\nmodern ideas in this mode of looking at things, a disbelief in\nall that has been constructed yesterday and today; there is\nperhaps some slight admixture of satiety and scorn, which can no\nlonger endure the BRIC-A-BRAC of ideas of the most varied origin,\nsuch as so-called Positivism at present throws on the market; a\ndisgust of the more refined taste at the village-fair motleyness\nand patchiness of all these reality-philosophasters, in whom\nthere is nothing either new or true, except this motleyness.\nTherein it seems to me that we should agree with those skeptical\nanti-realists and knowledge-microscopists of the present day;\ntheir instinct, which repels them from MODERN reality, is\nunrefuted . . . what do their retrograde by-paths concern us!\nThe main thing about them is NOT that they wish to go “back,\"\nbut that they wish to get AWAY therefrom. A little MORE strength,\nswing, courage, and artistic power, and they would be OFF—and\nnot back!\n11. It seems to me that there is everywhere an attempt at present\nto divert attention from the actual influence which Kant\nexercised on German philosophy, and especially to ignore\nprudently the value which he set upon himself. Kant was first and\nforemost proud of his Table of Categories; with it in his hand he\nsaid: “This is the most difficult thing that could ever be\nundertaken on behalf of metaphysics.” Let us only understand this\n\"could be”! He was proud of having DISCOVERED a new faculty in\nman, the faculty of synthetic judgment a priori. Granting that he\ndeceived himself in this matter; the development and rapid\nflourishing of German philosophy depended nevertheless on his\npride, and on the eager rivalry of the younger generation to\ndiscover if possible something—at all events “new faculties\"—of\nwhich to be still prouder!—But let us reflect for a moment—it\nis high time to do so. “How are synthetic judgments a priori\nPOSSIBLE?” Kant asks himself—and what is really his answer? “BY\nMEANS OF A MEANS (faculty)\"—but unfortunately not in five words,\nbut so circumstantially, imposingly, and with such display of\nGerman profundity and verbal flourishes, that one altogether\nloses sight of the comical niaiserie allemande involved in such\nan answer. People were beside themselves with delight over this\nnew faculty, and the jubilation reached its climax when Kant\nfurther discovered a moral faculty in man—for at that time\nGermans were still moral, not yet dabbling in the “Politics of\nhard fact.” Then came the honeymoon of German philosophy. All the\nyoung theologians of the Tubingen institution went immediately\ninto the groves—all seeking for “faculties.” And what did they\nnot find—in that innocent, rich, and still youthful period of\nthe German spirit, to which Romanticism, the malicious fairy,\npiped and sang, when one could not yet distinguish between\n\"finding” and “inventing”! Above all a faculty for the\n\"transcendental\"; Schelling christened it, intellectual\nintuition, and thereby gratified the most earnest longings of the\nnaturally pious-inclined Germans. One can do no greater wrong to\nthe whole of this exuberant and eccentric movement (which was\nreally youthfulness, notwithstanding that it disguised itself so\nboldly, in hoary and senile conceptions), than to take it\nseriously, or even treat it with moral indignation. Enough,\nhowever—the world grew older, and the dream vanished. A time\ncame when people rubbed their foreheads, and they still rub them\ntoday. People had been dreaming, and first and foremost—old\nKant. “By means of a means (faculty)\"—he had said, or at least\nmeant to say. But, is that—an answer? An explanation? Or is it\nnot rather merely a repetition of the question? How does opium\ninduce sleep? “By means of a means (faculty), “namely the virtus\ndormitiva, replies the doctor in Moliere,\n    Quia est in eo virtus dormitiva, \n    Cujus est natura sensus assoupire.\nBut such replies belong to the realm of comedy, and it is high\ntime to replace the Kantian question, “How are synthetic\njudgments a PRIORI possible?” by another question, “Why is belief\nin such judgments necessary?\"—in effect, it is high time that we\nshould understand that such judgments must be believed to be\ntrue, for the sake of the preservation of creatures like\nourselves; though they still might naturally be false judgments!\nOr, more plainly spoken, and roughly and readily—synthetic\njudgments a priori should not “be possible” at all; we have no\nright to them; in our mouths they are nothing but false\njudgments. Only, of course, the belief in their truth is\nnecessary, as plausible belief and ocular evidence belonging to\nthe perspective view of life. And finally, to call to mind the\nenormous influence which “German philosophy\"—I hope you\nunderstand its right to inverted commas (goosefeet)?—has\nexercised throughout the whole of Europe, there is no doubt that\na certain VIRTUS DORMITIVA had a share in it; thanks to German\nphilosophy, it was a delight to the noble idlers, the virtuous,\nthe mystics, the artiste, the three-fourths Christians, and the\npolitical obscurantists of all nations,  to find an antidote to\nthe still overwhelming sensualism which overflowed from the last\ncentury into this, in short—\"sensus assoupire.” . . .\n12. As regards materialistic atomism, it is one of the best-\nrefuted theories that have been advanced, and in Europe there is\nnow perhaps no one in the learned world so unscholarly as to\nattach serious signification to it, except for convenient\neveryday use (as an abbreviation of the means of expression)—\nthanks chiefly to the Pole Boscovich: he and the Pole Copernicus\nhave hitherto been the greatest and most successful opponents of\nocular evidence. For while Copernicus has persuaded us to\nbelieve, contrary to all the senses, that the earth does NOT\nstand fast, Boscovich has taught us to abjure the belief in the\nlast thing that “stood fast” of the earth—the belief in\n\"substance,” in “matter,” in the earth-residuum, and particle-\natom: it is the greatest triumph over the senses that has\nhitherto been gained on earth. One must, however, go still\nfurther, and also declare war, relentless war to the knife,\nagainst the “atomistic requirements” which still lead a dangerous\nafter-life in places where no one suspects them, like the more\ncelebrated “metaphysical requirements”: one must also above all\ngive the finishing stroke to that other and more portentous\natomism which Christianity has taught best and longest, the SOUL-\nATOMISM. Let it be permitted to designate by this expression the\nbelief which regards the soul as something indestructible,\neternal, indivisible, as a monad, as an atomon: this belief ought\nto be expelled from science! Between ourselves, it is not at all\nnecessary to get rid of “the soul” thereby, and thus renounce one\nof the oldest and most venerated hypotheses—as happens\nfrequently to the clumsiness of naturalists, who can hardly touch\non the soul without immediately losing it. But the way is open\nfor new acceptations and refinements of the soul-hypothesis; and\nsuch conceptions as “mortal soul,” and “soul of subjective\nmultiplicity,” and “soul as social structure of the instincts and\npassions,” want henceforth to have legitimate rights in science.\nIn that the NEW psychologist is about to put an end to the\nsuperstitions which have hitherto flourished with almost tropical\nluxuriance around the idea of the soul, he is really, as it were,\nthrusting himself into a new desert and a new distrust—it is\npossible that the older psychologists had a merrier and more\ncomfortable time of it; eventually, however, he finds that\nprecisely thereby he is also condemned to INVENT—and, who knows?\nperhaps to DISCOVER the new.\n13. Psychologists should bethink themselves before putting down\nthe instinct of self-preservation as the cardinal instinct of an\norganic being. A living thing seeks above all to DISCHARGE its\nstrength—life itself is WILL TO POWER; self-preservation is only\none of the indirect and most frequent RESULTS thereof. In short,\nhere, as everywhere else, let us beware of SUPERFLUOUS\nteleological principles!—one of which is the instinct of self-\npreservation (we owe it to Spinoza’s inconsistency). It is thus,\nin effect, that method ordains, which must be essentially economy\nof principles.\n14. It is perhaps just dawning on five or six minds that natural\nphilosophy is only a world-exposition and world-arrangement\n(according to us, if I may say so!) and NOT a world-explanation;\nbut in so far as it is based on belief in the senses, it is\nregarded as more, and for a long time to come must be regarded as\nmore—namely, as an explanation. It has eyes and fingers of its\nown, it has ocular evidence and palpableness of its own: this\noperates fascinatingly, persuasively, and CONVINCINGLY upon an\nage with fundamentally plebeian tastes—in fact, it follows\ninstinctively the canon of truth of eternal popular sensualism.\nWhat is clear, what is “explained”? Only that which can be seen\nand felt—one must pursue every problem thus far. Obversely,\nhowever, the charm of the Platonic mode of thought, which was an\nARISTOCRATIC mode, consisted precisely in RESISTANCE to obvious\nsense-evidence—perhaps among men who enjoyed even stronger and\nmore fastidious senses than our contemporaries, but who knew how\nto find a higher triumph in remaining masters of them: and this\nby means of pale, cold, grey conceptional networks which they\nthrew over the motley whirl of the senses—the mob of the senses,\nas Plato said. In this overcoming of the world, and interpreting\nof the world in the manner of Plato, there was an ENJOYMENT\ndifferent from that which the physicists of today offer us—and\nlikewise the Darwinists and anti-teleologists among the\nphysiological workers, with their principle of the “smallest\npossible effort,” and the greatest possible blunder. “Where there\nis nothing more to see or to grasp, there is also nothing more\nfor men to do\"—that is certainly an imperative different from\nthe Platonic one, but it may notwithstanding be the right\nimperative for a hardy, laborious race of machinists and bridge-\nbuilders of the future, who have nothing but ROUGH work to\nperform.\n15. To study physiology with a clear conscience, one must insist\non the fact that the sense-organs are not phenomena in the sense\nof the idealistic philosophy; as such they certainly could not be\ncauses! Sensualism, therefore, at least as regulative hypothesis,\nif not as heuristic principle. What? And others say even that the\nexternal world is the work of our organs? But then our body, as a\npart of this external world, would be the work of our organs! But\nthen our organs themselves would be the work of our organs! It\nseems to me that this is a complete REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM, if the\nconception CAUSA SUI is something fundamentally absurd.\nConsequently, the external world is NOT the work of our organs—?\n16. There are still harmless self-observers who believe that\nthere are “immediate certainties\"; for instance, “I think,” or as\nthe superstition of Schopenhauer puts it, “I will\"; as though\ncognition here got hold of its object purely and simply as “the\nthing in itself,” without any falsification taking place either\non the part of the subject or the object. I would repeat it,\nhowever, a hundred times, that “immediate certainty,” as well as\n\"absolute knowledge” and the “thing in itself,” involve a\nCONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO; we really ought to free ourselves from\nthe misleading significance of words! The people on their part\nmay think that cognition is knowing all about things, but the\nphilosopher must say to himself: “When I analyze the process that\nis expressed in the sentence, ’I think,’ I find a whole series of\ndaring assertions, the argumentative proof of which would be\ndifficult, perhaps impossible: for instance, that it is I who\nthink, that there must necessarily be something that thinks, that\nthinking is an activity and operation on the part of a being who\nis thought of as a cause, that there is an ’ego,’ and finally,\nthat it is already determined what is to be designated by\nthinking—that I KNOW what thinking is. For if I had not already\ndecided within myself what it is, by what standard could I\ndetermine whether that which is just happening is not perhaps\n’willing’ or ’feeling’? In short, the assertion ’I think,’\nassumes that I COMPARE my state at the present moment with other\nstates of myself which I know, in order to determine what it is;\non account of this retrospective connection with further\n’knowledge,’ it has, at any rate, no immediate certainty for\nme.\"—In place of the “immediate certainty” in which the people\nmay believe in the special case, the philosopher thus finds a\nseries of metaphysical questions presented to him, veritable\nconscience questions of the intellect, to wit: “Whence did I get\nthe notion of ’thinking’? Why do I believe in cause and effect?\nWhat gives me the right to speak of an ’ego,’ and even of an\n’ego’ as cause, and finally of an ’ego’ as cause of thought?” He\nwho ventures to answer these metaphysical questions at once by an\nappeal to a sort of INTUITIVE perception, like the person who\nsays, “I think, and know that this, at least, is true, actual,\nand certain\"—will encounter a smile and two notes of\ninterrogation in a philosopher nowadays. “Sir,” the philosopher\nwill perhaps give him to understand, “it is improbable that you\nare not mistaken, but why should it be the truth?”\n17. With regard to the superstitions of logicians, I shall never\ntire of emphasizing a small, terse fact, which is unwillingly\nrecognized by these credulous minds—namely, that a thought comes\nwhen “it” wishes, and not when “I” wish; so that it is a\nPERVERSION of the facts of the case to say that the subject “I\"\nis the condition of the predicate “think.” ONE thinks; but that\nthis “one” is precisely the famous old “ego,” is, to put it\nmildly, only a supposition, an assertion, and assuredly not an\n\"immediate certainty.” After all, one has even gone too far with\nthis “one thinks\"—even the “one” contains an INTERPRETATION of\nthe process, and does not belong to the process itself. One\ninfers here according to the usual grammatical formula—\"To think\nis an activity; every activity requires an agency that is active;\nconsequently” . . . It was pretty much on the same lines that the\nolder atomism sought, besides the operating “power,” the material\nparticle wherein it resides and out of which it operates—the\natom. More rigorous minds, however, learnt at last to get along\nwithout this “earth-residuum,” and perhaps some day we shall\naccustom ourselves, even from the logician’s point of view, to\nget along without the little “one” (to which the worthy old “ego\"\nhas refined itself).\n18. It is certainly not the least charm of a theory that it is\nrefutable; it is precisely thereby that it attracts the more\nsubtle minds. It seems that the hundred-times-refuted theory of\nthe “free will” owes its persistence to this charm alone; some\none is always appearing who feels himself strong enough to refute\nit.\n19. Philosophers are accustomed to speak of the will as though it\nwere the best-known thing in the world; indeed, Schopenhauer has\ngiven us to understand that the will alone is really known to us,\nabsolutely and completely known, without deduction or addition.\nBut it again and again seems to me that in this case Schopenhauer\nalso only did what philosophers are in the habit of doing-he\nseems to have adopted a POPULAR PREJUDICE and exaggerated it.\nWilling-seems to me to be above all something COMPLICATED,\nsomething that is a unity only in name—and it is precisely in a\nname that popular prejudice lurks, which has got the mastery over\nthe inadequate precautions of philosophers in all ages. So let us\nfor once be more cautious, let us be “unphilosophical”: let us\nsay that in all willing there is firstly a plurality of\nsensations, namely, the sensation of the condition “AWAY FROM\nWHICH we go,” the sensation of the condition “TOWARDS WHICH we\ngo,” the sensation of this “FROM” and “TOWARDS” itself, and then\nbesides, an accompanying muscular sensation, which, even without\nour putting in motion “arms and legs,” commences its action by\nforce of habit, directly we “will” anything. Therefore, just as\nsensations (and indeed many kinds of sensations) are to be\nrecognized as ingredients of the will, so, in the second place,\nthinking is also to be recognized; in every act of the will there\nis a ruling thought;—and let us not imagine it possible to sever\nthis thought from the “willing,” as if the will would then remain\nover! In the third place, the will is not only a complex of\nsensation and thinking, but it is above all an EMOTION, and in\nfact the emotion of the command. That which is termed “freedom of\nthe will” is essentially the emotion of supremacy in respect to\nhim who must obey: “I am free, ’he’ must obey\"—this\nconsciousness is inherent in every will; and equally so the\nstraining of the attention, the straight look which fixes itself\nexclusively on one thing, the unconditional judgment that “this\nand nothing else is necessary now,” the inward certainty that\nobedience will be rendered—and whatever else pertains to the\nposition of the commander. A man who WILLS commands something\nwithin himself which renders obedience, or which he believes\nrenders obedience. But now let us notice what is the strangest\nthing about the will,—this affair so extremely complex, for\nwhich the people have only one name. Inasmuch as in the given\ncircumstances we are at the same time the commanding AND the\nobeying parties, and as the obeying party we know the sensations\nof constraint, impulsion, pressure, resistance, and motion, which\nusually commence immediately after the act of will; inasmuch as,\non the other hand, we are accustomed to disregard this duality,\nand to deceive ourselves about it by means of the synthetic term\n\"I”: a whole series of erroneous conclusions, and consequently of\nfalse judgments about the will itself, has become attached to the\nact of willing—to such a degree that he who wills believes\nfirmly that willing SUFFICES for action. Since in the majority of\ncases there has only been exercise of will when the effect of the\ncommand—consequently obedience, and therefore action—was to be\nEXPECTED, the APPEARANCE has translated itself into the\nsentiment, as if there were a NECESSITY OF EFFECT; in a word, he\nwho wills believes with a fair amount of certainty that will and\naction are somehow one; he ascribes the success, the carrying out\nof the willing, to the will itself, and thereby enjoys an\nincrease of the sensation of power which accompanies all success.\n\"Freedom of Will\"—that is the expression for the complex state\nof delight of the person exercising volition, who commands and at\nthe same time identifies himself with the executor of the order—\nwho, as such, enjoys also the triumph over obstacles, but thinks\nwithin himself that it was really his own will that overcame\nthem. In this way the person exercising volition adds the\nfeelings of delight of his successful executive instruments, the\nuseful “underwills” or under-souls—indeed, our body is but a\nsocial structure composed of many souls—to his feelings of\ndelight as commander. L’EFFET C’EST MOI. what happens here is\nwhat happens in every well-constructed and happy commonwealth,\nnamely, that the governing class identifies itself with the\nsuccesses of the commonwealth. In all willing it is absolutely a\nquestion of commanding and obeying, on the basis, as already\nsaid, of a social structure composed of many “souls”, on which\naccount a philosopher should claim the right to include willing-\nas-such within the sphere of morals—regarded as the doctrine of\nthe relations of supremacy under which the phenomenon of “life\"\nmanifests itself.\n20. That the separate philosophical ideas are not anything\noptional or autonomously evolving, but grow up in connection and\nrelationship with each other, that, however suddenly and\narbitrarily they seem to appear in the history of thought, they\nnevertheless belong just as much to a system as the collective\nmembers of the fauna of a Continent—is betrayed in the end by\nthe circumstance: how unfailingly the most diverse philosophers\nalways fill in again a definite fundamental scheme of POSSIBLE\nphilosophies. Under an invisible spell, they always revolve once\nmore in the same orbit, however independent of each other they\nmay feel themselves with their critical or systematic wills,\nsomething within them leads them, something impels them in\ndefinite order the one after the other—to wit, the innate\nmethodology and relationship of their ideas. Their thinking is,\nin fact, far less a discovery than a re-recognizing, a\nremembering, a return and a home-coming to a far-off, ancient\ncommon-household of the soul, out of which those ideas formerly\ngrew: philosophizing is so far a kind of atavism of the highest\norder. The wonderful family resemblance of all Indian, Greek, and\nGerman philosophizing is easily enough explained. In fact, where\nthere is affinity of language, owing to the common philosophy of\ngrammar—I mean owing to the unconscious domination and guidance\nof similar grammatical functions—it cannot but be that\neverything is prepared at the outset for a similar development\nand succession of philosophical systems, just as the way seems\nbarred against certain other possibilities of world-\ninterpretation. It is highly probable that philosophers within\nthe domain of the Ural-Altaic languages (where the conception of\nthe subject is least developed) look otherwise “into the world,\"\nand will be found on paths of thought different from those of the\nIndo-Germans and Mussulmans, the spell of certain grammatical\nfunctions is ultimately also the spell of PHYSIOLOGICAL\nvaluations and racial conditions.—So much by way of rejecting\nLocke’s superficiality with regard to the origin of ideas.\n21. The CAUSA SUI is the best self-contradiction that has yet\nbeen conceived, it is a sort of logical violation and\nunnaturalness; but the extravagant pride of man has managed to\nentangle itself profoundly and frightfully with this very folly.\nThe desire for “freedom of will” in the superlative, metaphysical\nsense, such as still holds sway, unfortunately, in the minds of\nthe half-educated, the desire to bear the entire and ultimate\nresponsibility for one’s actions oneself, and to absolve God, the\nworld, ancestors, chance, and society therefrom, involves nothing\nless than to be precisely this CAUSA SUI, and, with more than\nMunchausen daring, to pull oneself up into existence by the hair,\nout of the slough of nothingness. If any one should find out in\nthis manner the crass stupidity of the celebrated conception of\n\"free will” and put it out of his head altogether, I beg of him\nto carry his “enlightenment” a step further, and also put out of\nhis head the contrary of this monstrous conception of “free\nwill”: I mean “non-free will,” which is tantamount to a misuse of\ncause and effect. One should not wrongly MATERIALISE “cause” and\n\"effect,” as the natural philosophers do (and whoever like them\nnaturalize in thinking at present), according to the prevailing\nmechanical doltishness which makes the cause press and push until\nit “effects” its end; one should use “cause” and “effect” only as\npure CONCEPTIONS, that is to say, as conventional fictions for\nthe purpose of designation and mutual understanding,—NOT for\nexplanation. In “being-in-itself” there is nothing of “casual-\nconnection,” of “necessity,” or of “psychological non-freedom\";\nthere the effect does NOT follow the cause, there “law” does not\nobtain. It is WE alone who have devised cause, sequence,\nreciprocity, relativity, constraint, number, law, freedom,\nmotive, and purpose; and when we interpret and intermix this\nsymbol-world, as “being-in-itself,” with things, we act once more\nas we have always acted—MYTHOLOGICALLY. The “non-free will” is\nmythology; in real life it is only a question of STRONG and WEAK\nwills.—It is almost always a symptom of what is lacking in\nhimself, when a thinker, in every “causal-connection” and\n\"psychological necessity,” manifests something of compulsion,\nindigence, obsequiousness, oppression, and non-freedom; it is\nsuspicious to have such feelings—the person betrays himself. And\nin general, if I have observed correctly, the “non-freedom of the\nwill” is regarded as a problem from two entirely opposite\nstandpoints, but always in a profoundly PERSONAL manner: some\nwill not give up their “responsibility,” their belief in\nTHEMSELVES, the personal right to THEIR merits, at any price (the\nvain races belong to this class); others on the contrary, do not\nwish to be answerable for anything, or blamed for anything, and\nowing to an inward self-contempt, seek to GET OUT OF THE\nBUSINESS, no matter how. The latter, when they write books, are\nin the habit at present of taking the side of criminals; a sort\nof socialistic sympathy is their favourite disguise. And as a\nmatter of fact, the fatalism of the weak-willed embellishes\nitself surprisingly when it can pose as “la religion de la\nsouffrance humaine\"; that is ITS “good taste.”\n22. Let me be pardoned, as an old philologist who cannot desist\nfrom the mischief of putting his finger on bad modes of\ninterpretation, but “Nature’s conformity to law,” of which you\nphysicists talk so proudly, as though—why, it exists only owing\nto your interpretation and bad “philology.” It is no matter of\nfact, no “text,” but rather just a naively humanitarian\nadjustment and perversion of meaning, with which you make\nabundant concessions to the democratic instincts of the modern\nsoul! “Everywhere equality before the law—Nature is not\ndifferent in that respect, nor better than we”: a fine instance\nof secret motive, in which the vulgar antagonism to everything\nprivileged and autocratic—likewise a second and more refined\natheism—is once more disguised. “Ni dieu, ni maitre\"—that,\nalso, is what you want; and therefore “Cheers for natural law!\"—\nis it not so? But, as has been said, that is interpretation, not\ntext; and somebody might come along, who, with opposite\nintentions and modes of interpretation, could read out of the\nsame “Nature,” and with regard to the same phenomena, just the\ntyrannically inconsiderate and relentless enforcement of the\nclaims of power—an interpreter who should so place the\nunexceptionalness and unconditionalness of all “Will to Power\"\nbefore your eyes, that almost every word, and the word “tyranny\"\nitself, would eventually seem unsuitable, or like a weakening and\nsoftening metaphor—as being too human; and who should,\nnevertheless, end by asserting the same about this world as you\ndo, namely, that it has a “necessary” and “calculable” course,\nNOT, however, because laws obtain in it, but because they are\nabsolutely LACKING, and every power effects its ultimate\nconsequences every moment. Granted that this also is only\ninterpretation—and you will be eager enough to make this\nobjection?—well, so much the better.\n23. All psychology hitherto has run aground on moral prejudices\nand timidities, it has not dared to launch out into the depths.\nIn so far as it is allowable to recognize in that which has\nhitherto been written, evidence of that which has hitherto been\nkept silent, it seems as if nobody had yet harboured the notion\nof psychology as the Morphology and DEVELOPMENT-DOCTRINE OF THE\nWILL TO POWER, as I conceive of it. The power of moral prejudices\nhas penetrated deeply into the most intellectual world, the world\napparently most indifferent and unprejudiced, and has obviously\noperated in an injurious, obstructive, blinding, and distorting\nmanner. A proper physio-psychology has to contend with\nunconscious antagonism in the heart of the investigator, it has\n\"the heart” against it even a doctrine of the reciprocal\nconditionalness of the “good” and the “bad” impulses, causes (as\nrefined immorality) distress and aversion in a still strong and\nmanly conscience—still more so, a doctrine of the derivation of\nall good impulses from bad ones. If, however, a person should\nregard even the emotions of hatred, envy, covetousness, and\nimperiousness as life-conditioning emotions, as factors which\nmust be present, fundamentally and essentially, in the general\neconomy of life (which must, therefore, be further developed if\nlife is to be further developed), he will suffer from such a view\nof things as from sea-sickness. And yet this hypothesis is far\nfrom being the strangest and most painful in this immense and\nalmost new domain of dangerous knowledge, and there are in fact a\nhundred good reasons why every one should keep away from it who\nCAN do so! On the other hand, if one has once drifted hither with\none’s bark, well! very good! now let us set our teeth firmly! let\nus open our eyes and keep our hand fast on the helm! We sail away\nright OVER morality, we crush out, we destroy perhaps the remains\nof our own morality by daring to make our voyage thither—but\nwhat do WE matter. Never yet did a PROFOUNDER world of insight\nreveal itself to daring travelers and adventurers, and the\npsychologist who thus “makes a sacrifice\"—it is not the\nsacrifizio dell’ intelletto, on the contrary!—will at least be\nentitled to demand in return that psychology shall once more be\nrecognized as the queen of the sciences, for whose service and\nequipment the other sciences exist. For psychology is once more\nthe path to the fundamental problems.\nChapter II: The Free Spirit\n\n24. O sancta simplicitiatas! In what strange simplification and\nfalsification man lives! One can never cease wondering when once\none has got eyes for beholding this marvel! How we have made\neverything around us clear and free and easy and simple! how we\nhave been able to give our senses a passport to everything\nsuperficial, our thoughts a godlike desire for wanton pranks and\nwrong inferences!—how from the beginning, we have contrived to\nretain our ignorance in order to enjoy an almost inconceivable\nfreedom, thoughtlessness, imprudence, heartiness, and gaiety—in\norder to enjoy life! And only on this solidified, granitelike\nfoundation of ignorance could knowledge rear itself hitherto, the\nwill to knowledge on the foundation of a far more powerful will,\nthe will to ignorance, to the uncertain, to the untrue! Not as\nits opposite, but—as its refinement! It is to be hoped, indeed,\nthat LANGUAGE, here as elsewhere, will not get over its\nawkwardness, and that it will continue to talk of opposites where\nthere are only degrees and many refinements of gradation; it is\nequally to be hoped that the incarnated Tartuffery of morals,\nwhich now belongs to our unconquerable “flesh and blood,” will\nturn the words round in the mouths of us discerning ones. Here\nand there we understand it, and laugh at the way in which\nprecisely the best knowledge seeks most to retain us in this\nSIMPLIFIED, thoroughly artificial, suitably imagined, and\nsuitably falsified world: at the way in which, whether it will or\nnot, it loves error, because, as living itself, it loves life!\n25. After such a cheerful commencement, a serious word would fain\nbe heard; it appeals to the most serious minds. Take care, ye\nphilosophers and friends of knowledge, and beware of martyrdom!\nOf suffering “for the truth’s sake”! even in your own defense! It\nspoils all the innocence and fine neutrality of your conscience;\nit makes you headstrong against objections and red rags; it\nstupefies, animalizes, and brutalizes, when in the struggle with\ndanger, slander, suspicion, expulsion, and even worse\nconsequences of enmity, ye have at last to play your last card as\nprotectors of truth upon earth—as though “the Truth” were such\nan innocent and incompetent creature as to require protectors!\nand you of all people, ye knights of the sorrowful countenance,\nMessrs Loafers and Cobweb-spinners of the spirit! Finally, ye\nknow sufficiently well that it cannot be of any consequence if YE\njust carry your point; ye know that hitherto no philosopher has\ncarried his point, and that there might be a more laudable\ntruthfulness in every little interrogative mark which you place\nafter your special words and favourite doctrines (and\noccasionally after yourselves) than in all the solemn pantomime\nand trumping games before accusers and law-courts! Rather go out\nof the way! Flee into concealment! And have your masks and your\nruses, that ye may be mistaken for what you are, or somewhat\nfeared! And pray, don’t forget the garden, the garden with golden\ntrellis-work! And have people around you who are as a garden—or\nas music on the waters at eventide, when already the day becomes\na memory. Choose the GOOD solitude, the free, wanton, lightsome\nsolitude, which also gives you the right still to remain good in\nany sense whatsoever! How poisonous, how crafty, how bad, does\nevery long war make one, which cannot be waged openly by means of\nforce! How PERSONAL does a long fear make one, a long watching of\nenemies, of possible enemies! These pariahs of society, these\nlong-pursued, badly-persecuted ones—also the compulsory\nrecluses, the Spinozas or Giordano Brunos—always become in the\nend, even under the most intellectual masquerade, and perhaps\nwithout being themselves aware of it, refined vengeance-seekers\nand poison-Brewers (just lay bare the foundation of Spinoza’s\nethics and theology!), not to speak of the stupidity of moral\nindignation, which is the unfailing sign in a philosopher that\nthe sense of philosophical humour has left him. The martyrdom of\nthe philosopher, his “sacrifice for the sake of truth,” forces\ninto the light whatever of the agitator and actor lurks in him;\nand if one has hitherto contemplated him only with artistic\ncuriosity, with regard to many a philosopher it is easy to\nunderstand the dangerous desire to see him also in his\ndeterioration (deteriorated into a “martyr,” into a stage-and-\ntribune-bawler). Only, that it is necessary with such a desire to\nbe clear WHAT spectacle one will see in any case—merely a\nsatyric play, merely an epilogue farce, merely the continued\nproof that the long, real tragedy IS AT AN END, supposing that\nevery philosophy has been a long tragedy in its origin.\n26. Every select man strives instinctively for a citadel and a\nprivacy, where he is FREE from the crowd, the many, the majority—\nwhere he may forget “men who are the rule,” as their exception;—\nexclusive only of the case in which he is pushed straight to\nsuch men by a still stronger instinct, as a discerner in the\ngreat and exceptional sense. Whoever, in intercourse with men,\ndoes not occasionally glisten in all the green and grey colours\nof distress, owing to disgust, satiety, sympathy, gloominess, and\nsolitariness, is assuredly not a man of elevated tastes;\nsupposing, however, that he does not voluntarily take all this\nburden and disgust upon himself, that he persistently avoids it,\nand remains, as I said, quietly and proudly hidden in his\ncitadel, one thing is then certain: he was not made, he was not\npredestined for knowledge. For as such, he would one day have to\nsay to himself: “The devil take my good taste! but ’the rule’ is\nmore interesting than the exception—than myself, the exception!\"\nAnd he would go DOWN, and above all, he would go “inside.” The\nlong and serious study of the AVERAGE man—and consequently much\ndisguise, self-overcoming, familiarity, and bad intercourse (all\nintercourse is bad intercourse except with one’s equals):—that\nconstitutes a necessary part of the life-history of every\nphilosopher; perhaps the most disagreeable, odious, and\ndisappointing part. If he is fortunate, however, as a favourite\nchild of knowledge should be, he will meet with suitable\nauxiliaries who will shorten and lighten his task; I mean so-\ncalled cynics, those who simply recognize the animal, the\ncommonplace and “the rule” in themselves, and at the same time\nhave so much spirituality and ticklishness as to make them talk\nof themselves and their like BEFORE WITNESSES—sometimes they\nwallow, even in books, as on their own dung-hill. Cynicism is the\nonly form in which base souls approach what is called honesty;\nand the higher man must open his ears to all the coarser or finer\ncynicism, and congratulate himself when the clown becomes\nshameless right before him, or the scientific satyr speaks out.\nThere are even cases where enchantment mixes with the disgust—\nnamely, where by a freak of nature, genius is bound to some such\nindiscreet billy-goat and ape, as in the case of the Abbe\nGaliani, the profoundest, acutest, and perhaps also filthiest man\nof his century—he was far profounder than Voltaire, and\nconsequently also, a good deal more silent. It happens more\nfrequently, as has been hinted, that a scientific head is placed\non an ape’s body, a fine exceptional understanding in a base\nsoul, an occurrence by no means rare, especially among doctors\nand moral physiologists. And whenever anyone speaks without\nbitterness, or rather quite innocently, of man as a belly with\ntwo requirements, and a head with one; whenever any one sees,\nseeks, and WANTS to see only hunger, sexual instinct, and vanity\nas the real and only motives of human actions; in short, when any\none speaks “badly\"—and not even “ill\"—of man, then ought the\nlover of knowledge to hearken attentively and diligently; he\nought, in general, to have an open ear wherever there is talk\nwithout indignation. For the indignant man, and he who\nperpetually tears and lacerates himself with his own teeth (or,\nin place of himself, the world, God, or society), may indeed,\nmorally speaking, stand higher than the laughing and self-\nsatisfied satyr, but in every other sense he is the more\nordinary, more indifferent, and less instructive case. And no one\nis such a LIAR as the indignant man.\n27. It is difficult to be understood, especially when one thinks\nand lives gangasrotogati [Footnote: Like the river Ganges:\npresto.] among those only who think and live otherwise—namely,\nkurmagati [Footnote: Like the tortoise: lento.], or at best\n\"froglike,” mandeikagati [Footnote: Like the frog: staccato.] (I\ndo everything to be “difficultly understood” myself!)—and one\nshould be heartily grateful for the good will to some refinement\nof interpretation. As regards “the good friends,” however, who\nare always too easy-going, and think that as friends they have a\nright to ease, one does well at the very first to grant them a\nplay-ground and romping-place for misunderstanding—one can thus\nlaugh still; or get rid of them altogether, these good friends—\nand laugh then also!\n28. What is most difficult to render from one language into\nanother is the TEMPO of its style, which has its basis in the\ncharacter of the race, or to speak more physiologically, in the\naverage TEMPO of the assimilation of its nutriment. There are\nhonestly meant translations, which, as involuntary\nvulgarizations, are almost falsifications of the original, merely\nbecause its lively and merry TEMPO (which overleaps and obviates\nall dangers in word and expression) could not also be rendered. A\nGerman is almost incapacitated for PRESTO in his language;\nconsequently also, as may be reasonably inferred, for many of the\nmost delightful and daring NUANCES of free, free-spirited\nthought. And just as the buffoon and satyr are foreign to him in\nbody and conscience, so Aristophanes and Petronius are\nuntranslatable for him. Everything ponderous, viscous, and\npompously clumsy, all long-winded and wearying species of style,\nare developed in profuse variety among Germans—pardon me for\nstating the fact that even Goethe’s prose, in its mixture of\nstiffness and elegance, is no exception, as a reflection of the\n\"good old time” to which it belongs, and as an expression of\nGerman taste at a time when there was still a “German taste,\"\nwhich was a rococo-taste in moribus et artibus. Lessing is an\nexception, owing to his histrionic nature, which understood much,\nand was versed in many things; he who was not the translator of\nBayle to no purpose, who took refuge willingly in the shadow of\nDiderot and Voltaire, and still more willingly among the Roman\ncomedy-writers—Lessing loved also free-spiritism in the TEMPO,\nand flight out of Germany. But how could the German language,\neven in the prose of Lessing, imitate the TEMPO of Machiavelli,\nwho in his “Principe” makes us breathe the dry, fine air of\nFlorence, and cannot help presenting the most serious events in a\nboisterous allegrissimo, perhaps not without a malicious artistic\nsense of the contrast he ventures to present—long, heavy,\ndifficult, dangerous thoughts, and a TEMPO of the gallop, and of\nthe best, wantonest humour? Finally, who would venture on a\nGerman translation of Petronius, who, more than any great\nmusician hitherto, was a master of PRESTO in invention, ideas,\nand words? What matter in the end about the swamps of the sick,\nevil world, or of the “ancient world,” when like him, one has the\nfeet of a wind, the rush, the breath, the emancipating scorn of a\nwind, which makes everything healthy, by making everything RUN!\nAnd with regard to Aristophanes—that transfiguring,\ncomplementary genius, for whose sake one PARDONS all Hellenism\nfor having existed, provided one has understood in its full\nprofundity ALL that there requires pardon and transfiguration;\nthere is nothing that has caused me to meditate more on PLATO’S\nsecrecy and sphinx-like nature, than the happily preserved petit\nfait that under the pillow of his death-bed there was found no\n\"Bible,” nor anything Egyptian, Pythagorean, or Platonic—but a\nbook of Aristophanes. How could even Plato have endured life—a\nGreek life which he repudiated—without an Aristophanes!\n29. It is the business of the very few to be independent; it is a\nprivilege of the strong. And whoever attempts it, even with the\nbest right, but without being OBLIGED to do so, proves that he is\nprobably not only strong, but also daring beyond measure. He\nenters into a labyrinth, he multiplies a thousandfold the dangers\nwhich life in itself already brings with it; not the least of\nwhich is that no one can see how and where he loses his way,\nbecomes isolated, and is torn piecemeal by some minotaur of\nconscience. Supposing such a one comes to grief, it is so far\nfrom the comprehension of men that they neither feel it, nor\nsympathize with it. And he cannot any longer go back! He cannot\neven go back again to the sympathy of men!\n30. Our deepest insights must—and should—appear as follies, and\nunder certain circumstances as crimes, when they come\nunauthorizedly to the ears of those who are not disposed and\npredestined for them. The exoteric and the esoteric, as they were\nformerly distinguished by philosophers—among the Indians, as\namong the Greeks, Persians, and Mussulmans, in short, wherever\npeople believed in gradations of rank and NOT in equality and\nequal rights—are not so much in contradistinction to one another\nin respect to the exoteric class, standing without, and viewing,\nestimating, measuring, and judging from the outside, and not from\nthe inside; the more essential distinction is that the class in\nquestion views things from below upwards—while the esoteric\nclass views things FROM ABOVE DOWNWARDS. There are heights of the\nsoul from which tragedy itself no longer appears to operate\ntragically; and if all the woe in the world were taken together,\nwho would dare to decide whether the sight of it would\nNECESSARILY seduce and constrain to sympathy, and thus to a\ndoubling of the woe? . . . That which serves the higher class of\nmen for nourishment or refreshment, must be almost poison to an\nentirely different and lower order of human beings. The virtues\nof the common man would perhaps mean vice and weakness in a\nphilosopher; it might be possible for a highly developed man,\nsupposing him to degenerate and go to ruin, to acquire qualities\nthereby alone, for the sake of which he would have to be honoured\nas a saint in the lower world into which he had sunk. There are\nbooks which have an inverse value for the soul and the health\naccording as the inferior soul and the lower vitality, or the\nhigher and more powerful, make use of them. In the former case\nthey are dangerous, disturbing, unsettling books, in the latter\ncase they are herald-calls which summon the bravest to THEIR\nbravery. Books for the general reader are always ill-smelling\nbooks, the odour of paltry people clings to them. Where the\npopulace eat and drink, and even where they reverence, it is\naccustomed to stink. One should not go into churches if one\nwishes to breathe PURE air.\n31. In our youthful years we still venerate and despise without\nthe art of NUANCE, which is the best gain of life, and we have\nrightly to do hard penance for having fallen upon men and things\nwith Yea and Nay. Everything is so arranged that the worst of all\ntastes, THE TASTE FOR THE UNCONDITIONAL, is cruelly befooled and\nabused, until a man learns to introduce a little art into his\nsentiments, and prefers to try conclusions with the artificial,\nas do the real artists of life. The angry and reverent spirit\npeculiar to youth appears to allow itself no peace, until it has\nsuitably falsified men and things, to be able to vent its passion\nupon them: youth in itself even, is something falsifying and\ndeceptive. Later on, when the young soul, tortured by continual\ndisillusions, finally turns suspiciously against itself—still\nardent and savage even in its suspicion and remorse of\nconscience: how it upbraids itself, how impatiently it tears\nitself, how it revenges itself for its long self-blinding, as\nthough it had been a voluntary blindness! In this transition one\npunishes oneself by distrust of one’s sentiments; one tortures\none’s enthusiasm with doubt, one feels even the good conscience\nto be a danger, as if it were the self-concealment and lassitude\nof a more refined uprightness; and above all, one espouses upon\nprinciple the cause AGAINST “youth.\"—A decade later, and one\ncomprehends that all this was also still—youth!\n32. Throughout the longest period of human history—one calls it\nthe prehistoric period—the value or non-value of an action was\ninferred from its CONSEQUENCES; the action in itself was not\ntaken into consideration, any more than its origin; but pretty\nmuch as in China at present, where the distinction or disgrace of\na child redounds to its parents, the retro-operating power of\nsuccess or failure was what induced men to think well or ill of\nan action. Let us call this period the PRE-MORAL period of\nmankind; the imperative, “Know thyself!” was then still unknown.\n—In the last ten thousand years, on the other hand, on certain\nlarge portions of the earth, one has gradually got so far, that\none no longer lets the consequences of an action, but its origin,\ndecide with regard to its worth: a great achievement as a whole,\nan important refinement of vision and of criterion, the\nunconscious effect of the supremacy of aristocratic values and of\nthe belief in “origin,” the mark of a period which may be\ndesignated in the narrower sense as the MORAL one: the first\nattempt at self-knowledge is thereby made. Instead of the\nconsequences, the origin—what an inversion of perspective! And\nassuredly an inversion effected only after long struggle and\nwavering! To be sure, an ominous new superstition, a peculiar\nnarrowness of interpretation, attained supremacy precisely\nthereby: the origin of an action was interpreted in the most\ndefinite sense possible, as origin out of an INTENTION; people\nwere agreed in the belief that the value of an action lay in the\nvalue of its intention. The intention as the sole origin and\nantecedent history of an action: under the influence of this\nprejudice moral praise and blame have been bestowed, and men have\njudged and even philosophized almost up to the present day.—Is\nit not possible, however, that the necessity may now have arisen\nof again making up our minds with regard to the reversing and\nfundamental shifting of values, owing to a new self-consciousness\nand acuteness in man—is it not possible that we may be standing\non the threshold of a period which to begin with, would be\ndistinguished negatively as ULTRA-MORAL: nowadays when, at least\namong us immoralists, the suspicion arises that the decisive\nvalue of an action lies precisely in that which is NOT\nINTENTIONAL, and that all its intentionalness, all that is seen,\nsensible, or “sensed” in it, belongs to its surface or skin—\nwhich, like every skin, betrays something, but CONCEALS still\nmore? In short, we believe that the intention is only a sign or\nsymptom, which first requires an explanation—a sign, moreover,\nwhich has too many interpretations, and consequently hardly any\nmeaning in itself alone: that morality, in the sense in which it\nhas been understood hitherto, as intention-morality, has been a\nprejudice, perhaps a prematureness or preliminariness, probably\nsomething of the same rank as astrology and alchemy, but in any\ncase something which must be surmounted. The surmounting of\nmorality, in a certain sense even the self-mounting of morality—\nlet that be the name for the long-secret labour which has been\nreserved for the most refined, the most upright, and also the\nmost wicked consciences of today, as the living touchstones of\nthe soul.\n33. It cannot be helped: the sentiment of surrender, of sacrifice\nfor one’s neighbour, and all self-renunciation-morality, must be\nmercilessly called to account, and brought to judgment; just as\nthe aesthetics of “disinterested contemplation,” under which the\nemasculation of art nowadays seeks insidiously enough to create\nitself a good conscience. There is far too much witchery and\nsugar in the sentiments “for others” and “NOT for myself,” for\none not needing to be doubly distrustful here, and for one asking\npromptly: “Are they not perhaps—DECEPTIONS?\"—That they PLEASE—\nhim who has them, and him who enjoys their fruit, and also the\nmere spectator—that is still no argument in their FAVOUR, but\njust calls for caution. Let us therefore be cautious!\n34. At whatever standpoint of philosophy one may place oneself\nnowadays, seen from every position, the ERRONEOUSNESS of the\nworld in which we think we live is the surest and most certain\nthing our eyes can light upon: we find proof after proof thereof,\nwhich would fain allure us into surmises concerning a deceptive\nprinciple in the “nature of things.” He, however, who makes\nthinking itself, and consequently “the spirit,” responsible for\nthe falseness of the world—an honourable exit, which every\nconscious or unconscious advocatus dei avails himself of—he who\nregards this world, including space, time, form, and movement, as\nfalsely DEDUCED, would have at least good reason in the end to\nbecome distrustful also of all thinking; has it not hitherto been\nplaying upon us the worst of scurvy tricks? and what guarantee\nwould it give that it would not continue to do what it has always\nbeen doing? In all seriousness, the innocence of thinkers has\nsomething touching and respect-inspiring in it, which even\nnowadays permits them to wait upon consciousness with the request\nthat it will give them HONEST answers: for example, whether it be\n\"real” or not, and why it keeps the outer world so resolutely at\na distance, and other questions of the same description. The\nbelief in “immediate certainties” is a MORAL NAIVETE which does\nhonour to us philosophers; but—we have now to cease being\n\"MERELY moral” men! Apart from morality, such belief is a folly\nwhich does little honour to us! If in middle-class life an ever-\nready distrust is regarded as the sign of a “bad character,” and\nconsequently as an imprudence, here among us, beyond the middle-\nclass world and its Yeas and Nays, what should prevent our being\nimprudent and saying: the philosopher has at length a RIGHT to\n\"bad character,” as the being who has hitherto been most befooled\non earth—he is now under OBLIGATION to distrustfulness, to the\nwickedest squinting out of every abyss of suspicion.—Forgive me\nthe joke of this gloomy grimace and turn of expression; for I\nmyself have long ago learned to think and estimate differently\nwith regard to deceiving and being deceived, and I keep at least\na couple of pokes in the ribs ready for the blind rage with which\nphilosophers struggle against being deceived. Why NOT? It is\nnothing more than a moral prejudice that truth is worth more than\nsemblance; it is, in fact, the worst proved supposition in the\nworld. So much must be conceded: there could have been no life at\nall except upon the basis of perspective estimates and\nsemblances; and if, with the virtuous enthusiasm and stupidity of\nmany philosophers, one wished to do away altogether with the\n\"seeming world\"—well, granted that YOU could do that,—at least\nnothing of your “truth” would thereby remain! Indeed, what is it\nthat forces us in general to the supposition that there is an\nessential opposition of “true” and “false”? Is it not enough to\nsuppose degrees of seemingness, and as it were lighter and darker\nshades and tones of semblance—different valeurs, as the painters\nsay? Why might not the world WHICH CONCERNS US—be a fiction? And\nto any one who suggested: “But to a fiction belongs an\noriginator?\"—might it not be bluntly replied: WHY? May not this\n\"belong” also belong to the fiction? Is it not at length\npermitted to be a little ironical towards the subject, just as\ntowards the predicate and object? Might not the philosopher\nelevate himself above faith in grammar? All respect to\ngovernesses, but is it not time that philosophy should renounce\ngoverness-faith?\n35. O Voltaire! O humanity! O idiocy! There is something ticklish\nin “the truth,” and in the SEARCH for the truth; and if man goes\nabout it too humanely—\"il ne cherche le vrai que pour faire le\nbien\"—I wager he finds nothing!\n36. Supposing that nothing else is “given” as real but our world\nof desires and passions, that we cannot sink or rise to any other\n\"reality” but just that of our impulses—for thinking is only a\nrelation of these impulses to one another:—are we not permitted\nto make the attempt and to ask the question whether this which is\n\"given” does not SUFFICE, by means of our counterparts, for the\nunderstanding even of the so-called mechanical (or “material”)\nworld? I do not mean as an illusion, a “semblance,” a\n\"representation” (in the Berkeleyan and Schopenhauerian sense),\nbut as possessing the same degree of reality as our emotions\nthemselves—as a more primitive form of the world of emotions, in\nwhich everything still lies locked in a mighty unity, which\nafterwards branches off and develops itself in organic processes\n(naturally also, refines and debilitates)—as a kind of\ninstinctive life in which all organic functions, including self-\nregulation, assimilation, nutrition, secretion, and change of\nmatter, are still synthetically united with one another—as a\nPRIMARY FORM of life?—In the end, it is not only permitted to\nmake this attempt, it is commanded by the conscience of LOGICAL\nMETHOD. Not to assume several kinds of causality, so long as the\nattempt to get along with a single one has not been pushed to its\nfurthest extent (to absurdity, if I may be allowed to say so):\nthat is a morality of method which one may not repudiate\nnowadays—it follows “from its definition,” as mathematicians\nsay. The question is ultimately whether we really recognize the\nwill as OPERATING, whether we believe in the causality of the\nwill; if we do so—and fundamentally our belief IN THIS is just\nour belief in causality itself—we MUST make the attempt to posit\nhypothetically the causality of the will as the only causality.\n\"Will” can naturally only operate on “will\"—and not on “matter\"\n(not on “nerves,” for instance): in short, the hypothesis must be\nhazarded, whether will does not operate on will wherever\n\"effects” are recognized—and whether all mechanical action,\ninasmuch as a power operates therein, is not just the power of\nwill, the effect of will. Granted, finally, that we succeeded in\nexplaining our entire instinctive life as the development and\nramification of one fundamental form of will—namely, the Will to\nPower, as my thesis puts it; granted that all organic functions\ncould be traced back to this Will to Power, and that the solution\nof the problem of generation and nutrition—it is one problem—\ncould also be found therein: one would thus have acquired the\nright to define ALL active force unequivocally as WILL TO POWER.\nThe world seen from within, the world defined and designated\naccording to its “intelligible character\"—it would simply be\n\"Will to Power,” and nothing else.\n37. “What? Does not that mean in popular language: God is\ndisproved, but not the devil?\"—On the contrary! On the contrary,\nmy friends! And who the devil also compels you to speak\npopularly!\n38. As happened finally in all the enlightenment of modern times\nwith the French Revolution (that terrible farce, quite\nsuperfluous when judged close at hand, into which, however, the\nnoble and visionary spectators of all Europe have interpreted\nfrom a distance their own indignation and enthusiasm so long and\npassionately, UNTIL THE TEXT HAS DISAPPEARED UNDER THE\nINTERPRETATION), so a noble posterity might once more\nmisunderstand the whole of the past, and perhaps only thereby\nmake ITS aspect endurable.—Or rather, has not this already\nhappened? Have not we ourselves been—that “noble posterity”?\nAnd, in so far as we now comprehend this, is it not—thereby\nalready past?\n39. Nobody will very readily regard a doctrine as true merely\nbecause it makes people happy or virtuous—excepting, perhaps,\nthe amiable “Idealists,” who are enthusiastic about the good,\ntrue, and beautiful, and let all kinds of motley, coarse, and\ngood-natured desirabilities swim about promiscuously in their\npond. Happiness and virtue are no arguments. It is willingly\nforgotten, however, even on the part of thoughtful minds, that to\nmake unhappy and to make bad are just as little counter-\narguments. A thing could be TRUE, although it were in the highest\ndegree injurious and dangerous; indeed, the fundamental\nconstitution of existence might be such that one succumbed by a\nfull knowledge of it—so that the strength of a mind might be\nmeasured by the amount of “truth” it could endure—or to speak\nmore plainly, by the extent to which it REQUIRED truth\nattenuated, veiled, sweetened, damped, and falsified. But there\nis no doubt that for the discovery of certain PORTIONS of truth\nthe wicked and unfortunate are more favourably situated and have\na greater likelihood of success; not to speak of the wicked who\nare happy—a species about whom moralists are silent. Perhaps\nseverity and craft are more favourable conditions for the\ndevelopment of strong, independent spirits and philosophers than\nthe gentle, refined, yielding good-nature, and habit of taking\nthings easily, which are prized, and rightly prized in a learned\nman. Presupposing always, to begin with, that the term\n\"philosopher” be not confined to the philosopher who writes\nbooks, or even introduces HIS philosophy into books!—Stendhal\nfurnishes a last feature of the portrait of the free-spirited\nphilosopher, which for the sake of German taste I will not omit\nto underline—for it is OPPOSED to German taste. “Pour etre bon\nphilosophe,” says this last great psychologist, “il faut etre\nsec, clair, sans illusion. Un banquier, qui a fait fortune, a une\npartie du caractere requis pour faire des decouvertes en\nphilosophie, c’est-a-dire pour voir clair dans ce qui est.”\n40. Everything that is profound loves the mask: the profoundest\nthings have a hatred even of figure and likeness. Should not the\nCONTRARY only be the right disguise for the shame of a God to go\nabout in? A question worth asking!—it would be strange if some\nmystic has not already ventured on the same kind of thing. There\nare proceedings of such a delicate nature that it is well to\noverwhelm them with coarseness and make them unrecognizable;\nthere are actions of love and of an extravagant magnanimity after\nwhich nothing can be wiser than to take a stick and thrash the\nwitness soundly: one thereby obscures his recollection. Many a\none is able to obscure and abuse his own memory, in order at\nleast to have vengeance on this sole party in the secret: shame\nis inventive. They are not the worst things of which one is most\nashamed: there is not only deceit behind a mask—there is so much\ngoodness in craft. I could imagine that a man with something\ncostly and fragile to conceal, would roll through life clumsily\nand rotundly like an old, green, heavily-hooped wine-cask: the\nrefinement of his shame requiring it to be so. A man who has\ndepths in his shame meets his destiny and his delicate decisions\nupon paths which few ever reach, and with regard to the existence\nof which his nearest and most intimate friends may be ignorant;\nhis mortal danger conceals itself from their eyes, and equally so\nhis regained security. Such a hidden nature, which instinctively\nemploys speech for silence and concealment, and is inexhaustible\nin evasion of communication, DESIRES and insists that a mask of\nhimself shall occupy his place in the hearts and heads of his\nfriends; and supposing he does not desire it, his eyes will some\nday be opened to the fact that there is nevertheless a mask of\nhim there—and that it is well to be so. Every profound spirit\nneeds a mask; nay, more, around every profound spirit there\ncontinually grows a mask, owing to the constantly false, that is\nto say, SUPERFICIAL interpretation of every word he utters, every\nstep he takes, every sign of life he manifests.\n41. One must subject oneself to one’s own tests that one is\ndestined for independence and command, and do so at the right\ntime. One must not avoid one’s tests, although they constitute\nperhaps the most dangerous game one can play, and are in the end\ntests made only before ourselves and before no other judge. Not\nto cleave to any person, be it even the dearest—every person is\na prison and also a recess. Not to cleave to a fatherland, be it\neven the most suffering and necessitous—it is even less\ndifficult to detach one’s heart from a victorious fatherland. Not\nto cleave to a sympathy, be it even for higher men, into whose\npeculiar torture and helplessness chance has given us an insight.\nNot to cleave to a science, though it tempt one with the most\nvaluable discoveries, apparently specially reserved for us. Not\nto cleave to one’s own liberation, to the voluptuous distance and\nremoteness of the bird, which always flies further aloft in order\nalways to see more under it—the danger of the flier. Not to\ncleave to our own virtues, nor become as a whole a victim to any\nof our specialties, to our “hospitality” for instance, which is\nthe danger of dangers for highly developed and wealthy souls, who\ndeal prodigally, almost indifferently with themselves, and push\nthe virtue of liberality so far that it becomes a vice. One must\nknow how TO CONSERVE ONESELF—the best test of independence.\n42. A new order of philosophers is appearing; I shall venture to\nbaptize them by a name not without danger. As far as I understand\nthem, as far as they allow themselves to be understood—for it is\ntheir nature to WISH to remain something of a puzzle—these\nphilosophers of the future might rightly, perhaps also wrongly,\nclaim to be designated as “tempters.” This name itself is after\nall only an attempt, or, if it be preferred, a temptation.\n43. Will they be new friends of “truth,” these coming\nphilosophers? Very probably, for all philosophers hitherto have\nloved their truths. But assuredly they will not be dogmatists. It\nmust be contrary to their pride, and also contrary to their\ntaste, that their truth should still be truth for every one—that\nwhich has hitherto been the secret wish and ultimate purpose of\nall dogmatic efforts. “My opinion is MY opinion: another person\nhas not easily a right to it\"—such a philosopher of the future\nwill say, perhaps. One must renounce the bad taste of wishing to\nagree with many people. “Good” is no longer good when one’s\nneighbour takes it into his mouth. And how could there be a\n\"common good”! The expression contradicts itself; that which can\nbe common is always of small value. In the end things must be as\nthey are and have always been—the great things remain for the\ngreat, the abysses for the profound, the delicacies and thrills\nfor the refined, and, to sum up shortly, everything rare for the\nrare.\n\n44. Need I say expressly after all this that they will be free,\nVERY free spirits, these philosophers of the future—as certainly\nalso they will not be merely free spirits, but something more,\nhigher, greater, and fundamentally different, which does not wish\nto be misunderstood and mistaken? But while I say this, I feel\nunder OBLIGATION almost as much to them as to ourselves (we free\nspirits who are their heralds and forerunners), to sweep away\nfrom ourselves altogether a stupid old prejudice and\nmisunderstanding, which, like a fog, has too long made the\nconception of “free spirit” obscure. In every country of Europe,\nand the same in America, there is at present something which\nmakes an abuse of this name a very narrow, prepossessed,\nenchained class of spirits, who desire almost the opposite of\nwhat our intentions and instincts prompt—not to mention that in\nrespect to the NEW philosophers who are appearing, they must\nstill more be closed windows and bolted doors. Briefly and\nregrettably, they belong to the LEVELLERS, these wrongly named\n\"free spirits\"—as glib-tongued and scribe-fingered slaves of the\ndemocratic taste and its “modern ideas” all of them men without\nsolitude, without personal solitude, blunt honest fellows to whom\nneither courage nor honourable conduct ought to be denied, only,\nthey are not free, and are ludicrously superficial, especially in\ntheir innate partiality for seeing the cause of almost ALL human\nmisery and failure in the old forms in which society has hitherto\nexisted—a notion which happily inverts the truth entirely! What\nthey would fain attain with all their strength, is the universal,\ngreen-meadow happiness of the herd, together with security,\nsafety, comfort, and alleviation of life for every one, their two\nmost frequently chanted songs and doctrines are called “Equality\nof Rights” and “Sympathy with All Sufferers\"—and suffering\nitself is looked upon by them as something which must be DONE\nAWAY WITH. We opposite ones, however, who have opened our eye and\nconscience to the question how and where the plant “man” has\nhitherto grown most vigorously, believe that this has always\ntaken place under the opposite conditions, that for this end the\ndangerousness of his situation had to be increased enormously,\nhis inventive faculty and dissembling power (his “spirit”) had to\ndevelop into subtlety and daring under long oppression and\ncompulsion, and his Will to Life had to be increased to the\nunconditioned Will to Power—we believe that severity, violence,\nslavery, danger in the street and in the heart, secrecy,\nstoicism, tempter’s art and devilry of every kind,—that\neverything wicked, terrible, tyrannical, predatory, and\nserpentine in man, serves as well for the elevation of the human\nspecies as its opposite—we do not even say enough when we only\nsay THIS MUCH, and in any case we find ourselves here, both with\nour speech and our silence, at the OTHER extreme of all modern\nideology and gregarious desirability, as their anti-podes\nperhaps? What wonder that we “free spirits” are not exactly the\nmost communicative spirits? that we do not wish to betray in\nevery respect WHAT a spirit can free itself from, and WHERE\nperhaps it will then be driven? And as to the import of the\ndangerous formula, “Beyond Good and Evil,” with which we at least\navoid confusion, we ARE something else than “libres-penseurs,\"\n\"liben pensatori” “free-thinkers,” and whatever these honest\nadvocates of “modern ideas” like to call themselves. Having been\nat home, or at least guests, in many realms of the spirit, having\nescaped again and again from the gloomy, agreeable nooks in which\npreferences and prejudices, youth, origin, the accident of men\nand books, or even the weariness of travel seemed to confine us,\nfull of malice against the seductions of dependency which he\nconcealed in honours, money, positions, or exaltation of the\nsenses, grateful even for distress and the vicissitudes of\nillness, because they always free us from some rule, and its\n\"prejudice,” grateful to the God, devil, sheep, and worm in us,\ninquisitive to a fault, investigators to the point of cruelty,\nwith unhesitating fingers for the intangible, with teeth and\nstomachs for the most indigestible, ready for any business that\nrequires sagacity and acute senses, ready for every adventure,\nowing to an excess of “free will”, with anterior and posterior\nsouls, into the ultimate intentions of which it is difficult to\npry, with foregrounds and backgrounds to the end of which no foot\nmay run, hidden ones under the mantles of light, appropriators,\nalthough we resemble heirs and spendthrifts, arrangers and\ncollectors from morning till night, misers of our wealth and our\nfull-crammed drawers, economical in learning and forgetting,\ninventive in scheming, sometimes proud of tables of categories,\nsometimes pedants, sometimes night-owls of work even in full day,\nyea, if necessary, even scarecrows—and it is necessary nowadays,\nthat is to say, inasmuch as we are the born, sworn, jealous\nfriends of SOLITUDE, of our own profoundest midnight and midday\nsolitude—such kind of men are we, we free spirits! And perhaps\nye are also something of the same kind, ye coming ones? ye NEW\nphilosophers?\nChapter III: The Religious Mood\n\n45. The human soul and its limits, the range of man’s inner\nexperiences hitherto attained, the heights, depths, and distances\nof these experiences, the entire history of the soul UP TO THE\nPRESENT TIME, and its still unexhausted possibilities: this is\nthe preordained hunting-domain for a born psychologist and lover\nof a “big hunt”. But how often must he say despairingly to\nhimself: “A single individual! alas, only a single individual!\nand this great forest, this virgin forest!” So he would like to\nhave some hundreds of hunting assistants, and fine trained\nhounds, that he could send into the history of the human soul, to\ndrive HIS game together. In vain: again and again he experiences,\nprofoundly and bitterly, how difficult it is to find assistants\nand dogs for all the things that directly excite his curiosity.\nThe evil of sending scholars into new and dangerous hunting-\ndomains, where courage, sagacity, and subtlety in every sense are\nrequired, is that they are no longer serviceable just when the\n\"BIG hunt,” and also the great danger commences,—it is precisely\nthen that they lose their keen eye and nose. In order, for\ninstance, to divine and determine what sort of history the\nproblem of KNOWLEDGE AND CONSCIENCE has hitherto had in the souls\nof homines religiosi, a person would perhaps himself have to\npossess as profound, as bruised, as immense an experience as the\nintellectual conscience of Pascal; and then he would still\nrequire that wide-spread heaven of clear, wicked spirituality,\nwhich, from above, would be able to oversee, arrange, and\neffectively formulize this mass of dangerous and painful\nexperiences.—But who could do me this service! And who would\nhave time to wait for such servants!—they evidently appear too\nrarely, they are so improbable at all times! Eventually one must\ndo everything ONESELF in order to know something; which means\nthat one has MUCH to do!—But a curiosity like mine is once for\nall the most agreeable of vices—pardon me! I mean to say that\nthe love of truth has its reward in heaven, and already upon\nearth.\n46. Faith, such as early Christianity desired, and not\ninfrequently achieved in the midst of a skeptical and southernly\nfree-spirited world, which had centuries of struggle between\nphilosophical schools behind it and in it, counting besides the\neducation in tolerance which the Imperium Romanum gave—this\nfaith is NOT that sincere, austere slave-faith by which perhaps a\nLuther or a Cromwell, or some other northern barbarian of the\nspirit remained attached to his God and Christianity, it is much\nrather the faith of Pascal, which resembles in a terrible manner\na continuous suicide of reason—a tough, long-lived, worm-like\nreason, which is not to be slain at once and with a single blow.\nThe Christian faith from the beginning, is sacrifice the\nsacrifice of all freedom, all pride, all self-confidence of\nspirit, it is at the same time subjection, self-derision, and\nself-mutilation. There is cruelty and religious Phoenicianism in\nthis faith, which is adapted to a tender, many-sided, and very\nfastidious conscience, it takes for granted that the subjection\nof the spirit is indescribably PAINFUL, that all the past and all\nthe habits of such a spirit resist the absurdissimum, in the form\nof which “faith” comes to it. Modern men, with their obtuseness\nas regards all Christian nomenclature, have no longer the sense\nfor the terribly superlative conception which was implied to an\nantique taste by the paradox of the formula, “God on the Cross”.\nHitherto there had never and nowhere been such boldness in\ninversion, nor anything at once so dreadful, questioning, and\nquestionable as this formula: it promised a transvaluation of all\nancient values—It was the Orient, the PROFOUND Orient, it was\nthe Oriental slave who thus took revenge on Rome and its noble,\nlight-minded toleration, on the Roman “Catholicism” of non-faith,\nand it was always not the faith, but the freedom from the faith,\nthe half-stoical and smiling indifference to the seriousness of\nthe faith, which made the slaves indignant at their masters and\nrevolt against them. “Enlightenment” causes revolt, for the slave\ndesires the unconditioned, he understands nothing but the\ntyrannous, even in morals, he loves as he hates, without NUANCE,\nto the very depths, to the point of pain, to the point of\nsickness—his many HIDDEN sufferings make him revolt against the\nnoble taste which seems to DENY suffering. The skepticism with\nregard to suffering, fundamentally only an attitude of\naristocratic morality, was not the least of the causes, also, of\nthe last great slave-insurrection which began with the French\nRevolution.\n47. Wherever the religious neurosis has appeared on the earth so\nfar, we find it connected with three dangerous prescriptions as\nto regimen: solitude, fasting, and sexual abstinence—but without\nits being possible to determine with certainty which is cause and\nwhich is effect, or IF any relation at all of cause and effect\nexists there. This latter doubt is justified by the fact that one\nof the most regular symptoms among savage as well as among\ncivilized peoples is the most sudden and excessive sensuality,\nwhich then with equal suddenness transforms into penitential\nparoxysms, world-renunciation, and will-renunciation, both\nsymptoms perhaps explainable as disguised epilepsy? But nowhere\nis it MORE obligatory to put aside explanations around no other\ntype has there grown such a mass of absurdity and superstition,\nno other type seems to have been more interesting to men and even\nto philosophers—perhaps it is time to become just a little\nindifferent here, to learn caution, or, better still, to look\nAWAY, TO GO AWAY—Yet in the background of the most recent\nphilosophy, that of Schopenhauer, we find almost as the problem\nin itself, this terrible note of interrogation of the religious\ncrisis and awakening. How is the negation of will POSSIBLE? how\nis the saint possible?—that seems to have been the very question\nwith which Schopenhauer made a start and became a philosopher.\nAnd thus it was a genuine Schopenhauerian consequence, that his\nmost convinced adherent (perhaps also his last, as far as Germany\nis concerned), namely, Richard Wagner, should bring his own life-\nwork to an end just here, and should finally put that terrible\nand eternal type upon the stage as Kundry, type vecu, and as it\nloved and lived, at the very time that the mad-doctors in almost\nall European countries had an opportunity to study the type close\nat hand, wherever the religious neurosis—or as I call it, “the\nreligious mood\"—made its latest epidemical outbreak and display\nas the “Salvation Army\"—If it be a question, however, as to what\nhas been so extremely interesting to men of all sorts in all\nages, and even to philosophers, in the whole phenomenon of the\nsaint, it is undoubtedly the appearance of the miraculous\ntherein—namely, the immediate SUCCESSION OF OPPOSITES, of states\nof the soul regarded as morally antithetical: it was believed\nhere to be self-evident that a “bad man” was all at once turned\ninto a “saint,” a good man. The hitherto existing psychology was\nwrecked at this point, is it not possible it may have happened\nprincipally because psychology had placed itself under the\ndominion of morals, because it BELIEVED in oppositions of moral\nvalues, and saw, read, and INTERPRETED these oppositions into the\ntext and facts of the case? What? “Miracle” only an error of\ninterpretation? A lack of philology?\n48. It seems that the Latin races are far more deeply attached to\ntheir Catholicism than we Northerners are to Christianity\ngenerally, and that consequently unbelief in Catholic countries\nmeans something quite different from what it does among\nProtestants—namely, a sort of revolt against the spirit of the\nrace, while with us it is rather a return to the spirit (or non-\nspirit) of the race.\nWe Northerners undoubtedly derive our origin from barbarous\nraces, even as regards our talents for religion—we have POOR\ntalents for it. One may make an exception in the case of the\nCelts, who have theretofore furnished also the best soil for\nChristian infection in the North: the Christian ideal blossomed\nforth in France as much as ever the pale sun of the north would\nallow it. How strangely pious for our taste are still these later\nFrench skeptics, whenever there is any Celtic blood in their\norigin! How Catholic, how un-German does Auguste Comte’s\nSociology seem to us, with the Roman logic of its instincts! How\nJesuitical, that amiable and shrewd cicerone of Port Royal,\nSainte-Beuve, in spite of all his hostility to Jesuits! And even\nErnest Renan: how inaccessible to us Northerners does the\nlanguage of such a Renan appear, in whom every instant the merest\ntouch of religious thrill throws his refined voluptuous and\ncomfortably couching soul off its balance! Let us repeat after\nhim these fine sentences—and what wickedness and haughtiness is\nimmediately aroused by way of answer in our probably less\nbeautiful but harder souls, that is to say, in our more German\nsouls!—\"DISONS DONC HARDIMENT QUE LA RELIGION EST UN PRODUIT DE\nL’HOMME NORMAL, QUE L’HOMME EST LE PLUS DANS LE VRAI QUANT IL EST\nLE PLUS RELIGIEUX ET LE PLUS ASSURE D’UNE DESTINEE INFINIE. . . .\nC’EST QUAND IL EST BON QU’IL VEUT QUE LA VIRTU CORRESPONDE A UN\nORDER ETERNAL, C’EST QUAND IL CONTEMPLE LES CHOSES D’UNE MANIERE\nDESINTERESSEE QU’IL TROUVE LA MORT REVOLTANTE ET ABSURDE. COMMENT\nNE PAS SUPPOSER QUE C’EST DANS CES MOMENTS-LA, QUE L’HOMME VOIT\nLE MIEUX?” . . . These sentences are so extremely ANTIPODAL to my\nears and habits of thought, that in my first impulse of rage on\nfinding them, I wrote on the margin, “LA NIAISERIE RELIGIEUSE PAR\nEXCELLENCE!\"—until in my later rage I even took a fancy to them,\nthese sentences with their truth absolutely inverted! It is so\nnice and such a distinction to have one’s own antipodes!\n49. That which is so astonishing in the religious life of the\nancient Greeks is the irrestrainable stream of GRATITUDE which it\npours forth—it is a very superior kind of man who takes SUCH an\nattitude towards nature and life.—Later on, when the populace\ngot the upper hand in Greece, FEAR became rampant also in\nreligion; and Christianity was preparing itself.\n50. The passion for God: there are churlish, honest-hearted, and\nimportunate kinds of it, like that of Luther—the whole of\nProtestantism lacks the southern DELICATEZZA. There is an\nOriental exaltation of the mind in it, like that of an\nundeservedly favoured or elevated slave, as in the case of St.\nAugustine, for instance, who lacks in an offensive manner, all\nnobility in bearing and desires. There is a feminine tenderness\nand sensuality in it, which modestly and unconsciously longs for\na UNIO MYSTICA ET PHYSICA, as in the case of Madame de Guyon. In\nmany cases it appears, curiously enough, as the disguise of a\ngirl’s or youth’s puberty; here and there even as the hysteria of\nan old maid, also as her last ambition. The Church has frequently\ncanonized the woman in such a case.\n51. The mightiest men have hitherto always bowed reverently\nbefore the saint, as the enigma of self-subjugation and utter\nvoluntary privation—why did they thus bow? They divined in him—\nand as it were behind the questionableness of his frail and\nwretched appearance—the superior force which wished to test\nitself by such a subjugation; the strength of will, in which they\nrecognized their own strength and love of power, and knew how to\nhonour it: they honoured something in themselves when they\nhonoured the saint. In addition to this, the contemplation of the\nsaint suggested to them a suspicion: such an enormity of self-\nnegation and anti-naturalness will not have been coveted for\nnothing—they have said, inquiringly. There is perhaps a reason\nfor it, some very great danger, about which the ascetic might\nwish to be more accurately informed through his secret\ninterlocutors and visitors? In a word, the mighty ones of the\nworld learned to have a new fear before him, they divined a new\npower, a strange, still unconquered enemy:—it was the “Will to\nPower” which obliged them to halt before the saint. They had to\nquestion him.\n52. In the Jewish “Old Testament,” the book of divine justice,\nthere are men, things, and sayings on such an immense scale, that\nGreek and Indian literature has nothing to compare with it. One\nstands with fear and reverence before those stupendous remains of\nwhat man was formerly, and one has sad thoughts about old Asia\nand its little out-pushed peninsula Europe, which would like, by\nall means, to figure before Asia as the “Progress of Mankind.” To\nbe sure, he who is himself only a slender, tame house-animal, and\nknows only the wants of a house-animal (like our cultured people\nof today, including the Christians of “cultured” Christianity),\nneed neither be amazed nor even sad amid those ruins—the taste\nfor the Old Testament is a touchstone with respect to “great” and\n\"small”: perhaps he will find that the New Testament, the book of\ngrace, still appeals more to his heart (there is much of the\nodour of the genuine, tender, stupid beadsman and petty soul in\nit). To have bound up this New Testament (a kind of ROCOCO of\ntaste in every respect) along with the Old Testament into one\nbook, as the “Bible,” as “The Book in Itself,” is perhaps the\ngreatest audacity and “sin against the Spirit” which literary\nEurope has upon its conscience.\n53. Why Atheism nowadays? “The father” in God is thoroughly\nrefuted; equally so “the judge,” “the rewarder.” Also his “free\nwill”: he does not hear—and even if he did, he would not know\nhow to help. The worst is that he seems incapable of\ncommunicating himself clearly; is he uncertain?—This is what I\nhave made out (by questioning and listening at a variety of\nconversations) to be the cause of the decline of European theism;\nit appears to me that though the religious instinct is in\nvigorous growth,—it rejects the theistic satisfaction with\nprofound distrust.\n54. What does all modern philosophy mainly do? Since Descartes—\nand indeed more in defiance of him than on the basis of his\nprocedure—an ATTENTAT has been made on the part of all\nphilosophers on the old conception of the soul, under the guise\nof a criticism of the subject and predicate conception—that is\nto say, an ATTENTAT on the fundamental presupposition of\nChristian doctrine. Modern philosophy, as epistemological\nskepticism, is secretly or openly ANTI-CHRISTIAN, although (for\nkeener ears, be it said) by no means anti-religious. Formerly, in\neffect, one believed in “the soul” as one believed in grammar and\nthe grammatical subject: one said, “I” is the condition, “think\"\nis the predicate and is conditioned—to think is an activity for\nwhich one MUST suppose a subject as cause. The attempt was then\nmade, with marvelous tenacity and subtlety, to see if one could\nnot get out of this net,—to see if the opposite was not perhaps\ntrue: “think” the condition, and “I” the conditioned; “I,\"\ntherefore, only a synthesis which has been MADE by thinking\nitself. KANT really wished to prove that, starting from the\nsubject, the subject could not be proved—nor the object either:\nthe possibility of an APPARENT EXISTENCE of the subject, and\ntherefore of “the soul,” may not always have been strange to\nhim,—the thought which once had an immense power on earth as the\nVedanta philosophy.\n55. There is a great ladder of religious cruelty, with many\nrounds; but three of these are the most important. Once on a time\nmen sacrificed human beings to their God, and perhaps just those\nthey loved the best—to this category belong the firstling\nsacrifices of all primitive religions, and also the sacrifice of\nthe Emperor Tiberius in the Mithra-Grotto on the Island of Capri,\nthat most terrible of all Roman anachronisms. Then, during the\nmoral epoch of mankind, they sacrificed to their God the\nstrongest instincts they possessed, their “nature\"; THIS festal\njoy shines in the cruel glances of ascetics and “anti-natural\"\nfanatics. Finally, what still remained to be sacrificed? Was it\nnot necessary in the end for men to sacrifice everything\ncomforting, holy, healing, all hope, all faith in hidden\nharmonies, in future blessedness and justice? Was it not\nnecessary to sacrifice God himself, and out of cruelty to\nthemselves to worship stone, stupidity, gravity, fate,\nnothingness? To sacrifice God for nothingness—this paradoxical\nmystery of the ultimate cruelty has been reserved for the rising\ngeneration; we all know something thereof already.\n56. Whoever, like myself, prompted by some enigmatical desire,\nhas long endeavoured to go to the bottom of the question of\npessimism and free it from the half-Christian, half-German\nnarrowness and stupidity in which it has finally presented itself\nto this century, namely, in the form of Schopenhauer’s\nphilosophy; whoever, with an Asiatic and super-Asiatic eye, has\nactually looked inside, and into the most world-renouncing of all\npossible modes of thought—beyond good and evil, and no longer\nlike Buddha and Schopenhauer, under the dominion and delusion of\nmorality,—whoever has done this, has perhaps just thereby,\nwithout really desiring it, opened his eyes to behold the\nopposite ideal: the ideal of the most world-approving, exuberant,\nand vivacious man, who has not only learnt to compromise and\narrange with that which was and is, but wishes to have it again\nAS IT WAS AND IS, for all eternity, insatiably calling out de\ncapo, not only to himself, but to the whole piece and play; and\nnot only the play, but actually to him who requires the play—and\nmakes it necessary; because he always requires himself anew—and\nmakes himself necessary.—What? And this would not be—circulus\nvitiosus deus?\n57. The distance, and as it were the space around man, grows with\nthe strength of his intellectual vision and insight: his world\nbecomes profounder; new stars, new enigmas, and notions are ever\ncoming into view. Perhaps everything on which the intellectual\neye has exercised its acuteness and profundity has just been an\noccasion for its exercise, something of a game, something for\nchildren and childish minds. Perhaps the most solemn conceptions\nthat have caused the most fighting and suffering, the conceptions\n\"God” and “sin,” will one day seem to us of no more importance\nthan a child’s plaything or a child’s pain seems to an old man;—\nand perhaps another plaything and another pain will then be\nnecessary once more for “the old man\"—always childish enough, an\neternal child!\n58. Has it been observed to what extent outward idleness, or\nsemi-idleness, is necessary to a real religious life (alike for\nits favourite microscopic labour of self-examination, and for its\nsoft placidity called “prayer,” the state of perpetual readiness\nfor the “coming of God”), I mean the idleness with a good\nconscience, the idleness of olden times and of blood, to which\nthe aristocratic sentiment that work is DISHONOURING—that it\nvulgarizes body and soul—is not quite unfamiliar? And that\nconsequently the modern, noisy, time-engrossing, conceited,\nfoolishly proud laboriousness educates and prepares for\n\"unbelief” more than anything else? Among these, for instance,\nwho are at present living apart from religion in Germany, I find\n\"free-thinkers” of diversified species and origin, but above all\na majority of those in whom laboriousness from generation to\ngeneration has dissolved the religious instincts; so that they no\nlonger know what purpose religions serve, and only note their\nexistence in the world with a kind of dull astonishment. They\nfeel themselves already fully occupied, these good people, be it\nby their business or by their pleasures, not to mention the\n\"Fatherland,” and the newspapers, and their “family duties\"; it\nseems that they have no time whatever left for religion; and\nabove all, it is not obvious to them whether it is a question of\na new business or a new pleasure—for it is impossible, they say\nto themselves, that people should go to church merely to spoil\ntheir tempers. They are by no means enemies of religious customs;\nshould certain circumstances, State affairs perhaps, require\ntheir participation in such customs, they do what is required, as\nso many things are done—with a patient and unassuming\nseriousness, and without much curiosity or discomfort;—they live\ntoo much apart and outside to feel even the necessity for a FOR\nor AGAINST in such matters. Among those indifferent persons may\nbe reckoned nowadays the majority of German Protestants of the\nmiddle classes, especially in the great laborious centres of\ntrade and commerce; also the majority of laborious scholars, and\nthe entire University personnel (with the exception of the\ntheologians, whose existence and possibility there always gives\npsychologists new and more subtle puzzles to solve). On the part\nof pious, or merely church-going people, there is seldom any idea\nof HOW MUCH good-will, one might say arbitrary will, is now\nnecessary for a German scholar to take the problem of religion\nseriously; his whole profession (and as I have said, his whole\nworkmanlike laboriousness, to which he is compelled by his modern\nconscience) inclines him to a lofty and almost charitable\nserenity as regards religion, with which is occasionally mingled\na slight disdain for the “uncleanliness” of spirit which he takes\nfor granted wherever any one still professes to belong to the\nChurch. It is only with the help of history (NOT through his own\npersonal experience, therefore) that the scholar succeeds in\nbringing himself to a respectful seriousness, and to a certain\ntimid deference in presence of religions; but even when his\nsentiments have reached the stage of gratitude towards them, he\nhas not personally advanced one step nearer to that which still\nmaintains itself as Church or as piety; perhaps even the\ncontrary. The practical indifference to religious matters in the\nmidst of which he has been born and brought up, usually\nsublimates itself in his case into circumspection and\ncleanliness, which shuns contact with religious men and things;\nand it may be just the depth of his tolerance and humanity which\nprompts him to avoid the delicate trouble which tolerance itself\nbrings with it.—Every age has its own divine type of naivete,\nfor the discovery of which other ages may envy it: and how much\nnaivete—adorable, childlike, and boundlessly foolish naivete is\ninvolved in this belief of the scholar in his superiority, in the\ngood conscience of his tolerance, in the unsuspecting, simple\ncertainty with which his instinct treats the religious man as a\nlower and less valuable type, beyond, before, and ABOVE which he\nhimself has developed—he, the little arrogant dwarf and mob-man,\nthe sedulously alert, head-and-hand drudge of “ideas,” of “modern\nideas”!\n59. Whoever has seen deeply into the world has doubtless divined\nwhat wisdom there is in the fact that men are superficial. It is\ntheir preservative instinct which teaches them to be flighty,\nlightsome, and false. Here and there one finds a passionate and\nexaggerated adoration of “pure forms” in philosophers as well as\nin artists: it is not to be doubted that whoever has NEED of the\ncult of the superficial to that extent, has at one time or\nanother made an unlucky dive BENEATH it. Perhaps there is even an\norder of rank with respect to those burnt children, the born\nartists who find the enjoyment of life only in trying to FALSIFY\nits image (as if taking wearisome revenge on it), one might guess\nto what degree life has disgusted them, by the extent to which\nthey wish to see its image falsified, attenuated, ultrified, and\ndeified,—one might reckon the homines religiosi among the\nartists, as their HIGHEST rank. It is the profound, suspicious\nfear of an incurable pessimism which compels whole centuries to\nfasten their teeth into a religious interpretation of existence:\nthe fear of the instinct which divines that truth might be\nattained TOO soon, before man has become strong enough, hard\nenough, artist enough. . . . Piety, the “Life in God,” regarded in\nthis light, would appear as the most elaborate and ultimate\nproduct of the FEAR of truth, as artist-adoration and artist-\nintoxication in presence of the most logical of all\nfalsifications, as the will to the inversion of truth, to untruth\nat any price. Perhaps there has hitherto been no more effective\nmeans of beautifying man than piety, by means of it man can\nbecome so artful, so superficial, so iridescent, and so good,\nthat his appearance no longer offends.\n60. To love mankind FOR GOD’S SAKE—this has so far been the\nnoblest and remotest sentiment to which mankind has attained.\nThat love to mankind, without any redeeming intention in the\nbackground, is only an ADDITIONAL folly and brutishness, that the\ninclination to this love has first to get its proportion, its\ndelicacy, its gram of salt and sprinkling of ambergris from a\nhigher inclination—whoever first perceived and “experienced\"\nthis, however his tongue may have stammered as it attempted to\nexpress such a delicate matter, let him for all time be holy and\nrespected, as the man who has so far flown highest and gone\nastray in the finest fashion!\n61. The philosopher, as WE free spirits understand him—as the\nman of the greatest responsibility, who has the conscience for\nthe general development of mankind,—will use religion for his\ndisciplining and educating work, just as he will use the\ncontemporary political and economic conditions. The selecting and\ndisciplining influence—destructive, as well as creative and\nfashioning—which can be exercised by means of religion is\nmanifold and varied, according to the sort of people placed under\nits spell and protection. For those who are strong and\nindependent, destined and trained to command, in whom the\njudgment and skill of a ruling race is incorporated, religion is\nan additional means for overcoming resistance in the exercise of\nauthority—as a bond which binds rulers and subjects in common,\nbetraying and surrendering to the former the conscience of the\nlatter, their inmost heart, which would fain escape obedience.\nAnd in the case of the unique natures of noble origin, if by\nvirtue of superior spirituality they should incline to a more\nretired and contemplative life, reserving to themselves only the\nmore refined forms of government (over chosen disciples or\nmembers of an order), religion itself may be used as a means for\nobtaining peace from the noise and trouble of managing GROSSER\naffairs, and for securing immunity from the UNAVOIDABLE filth of\nall political agitation. The Brahmins, for instance, understood\nthis fact. With the help of a religious organization, they\nsecured to themselves the power of nominating kings for the\npeople, while their sentiments prompted them to keep apart and\noutside, as men with a higher and super-regal mission. At the\nsame time religion gives inducement and opportunity to some of\nthe subjects to qualify themselves for future ruling and\ncommanding the slowly ascending ranks and classes, in which,\nthrough fortunate marriage customs, volitional power and delight\nin self-control are on the increase. To them religion offers\nsufficient incentives and temptations to aspire to higher\nintellectuality, and to experience the sentiments of\nauthoritative self-control, of silence, and of solitude.\nAsceticism and Puritanism are almost indispensable means of\neducating and ennobling a race which seeks to rise above its\nhereditary baseness and work itself upwards to future supremacy.\nAnd finally, to ordinary men, to the majority of the people, who\nexist for service and general utility, and are only so far\nentitled to exist, religion gives invaluable contentedness with\ntheir lot and condition, peace of heart, ennoblement of\nobedience, additional social happiness and sympathy, with\nsomething of transfiguration and embellishment, something of\njustification of all the commonplaceness, all the meanness, all\nthe semi-animal poverty of their souls. Religion, together with\nthe religious significance of life, sheds sunshine over such\nperpetually harassed men, and makes even their own aspect\nendurable to them, it operates upon them as the Epicurean\nphilosophy usually operates upon sufferers of a higher order, in\na refreshing and refining manner, almost TURNING suffering TO\nACCOUNT, and in the end even hallowing and vindicating it. There\nis perhaps nothing so admirable in Christianity and Buddhism as\ntheir art of teaching even the lowest to elevate themselves by\npiety to a seemingly higher order of things, and thereby to\nretain their satisfaction with the actual world in which they\nfind it difficult enough to live—this very difficulty being\nnecessary.\n62. To be sure—to make also the bad counter-reckoning against\nsuch religions, and to bring to light their secret dangers—the\ncost is always excessive and terrible when religions do NOT\noperate as an educational and disciplinary medium in the hands of\nthe philosopher, but rule voluntarily and PARAMOUNTLY, when they\nwish to be the final end, and not a means along with other means.\nAmong men, as among all other animals, there is a surplus of\ndefective, diseased, degenerating, infirm, and necessarily\nsuffering individuals; the successful cases, among men also, are\nalways the exception; and in view of the fact that man is THE\nANIMAL NOT YET PROPERLY ADAPTED TO HIS ENVIRONMENT, the rare\nexception. But worse still. The higher the type a man represents,\nthe greater is the improbability that he will SUCCEED; the\naccidental, the law of irrationality in the general constitution\nof mankind, manifests itself most terribly in its destructive\neffect on the higher orders of men, the conditions of whose lives\nare delicate, diverse, and difficult to determine. What, then, is\nthe attitude of the two greatest religions above-mentioned to the\nSURPLUS of failures in life? They endeavour to preserve and keep\nalive whatever can be preserved; in fact, as the religions FOR\nSUFFERERS, they take the part of these upon principle; they are\nalways in favour of those who suffer from life as from a disease,\nand they would fain treat every other experience of life as false\nand impossible. However highly we may esteem this indulgent and\npreservative care (inasmuch as in applying to others, it has\napplied, and applies also to the highest and usually the most\nsuffering type of man), the hitherto PARAMOUNT religions—to give\na general appreciation of them—are among the principal causes\nwhich have kept the type of “man” upon a lower level—they have\npreserved too much THAT WHICH SHOULD HAVE PERISHED. One has to\nthank them for invaluable services; and who is sufficiently rich\nin gratitude not to feel poor at the contemplation of all that\nthe “spiritual men” of Christianity have done for Europe\nhitherto! But when they had given comfort to the sufferers,\ncourage to the oppressed and despairing, a staff and support to\nthe helpless, and when they had allured from society into\nconvents and spiritual penitentiaries the broken-hearted and\ndistracted: what else had they to do in order to work\nsystematically in that fashion, and with a good conscience, for\nthe preservation of all the sick and suffering, which means, in\ndeed and in truth, to work for the DETERIORATION OF THE EUROPEAN\nRACE? To REVERSE all estimates of value—THAT is what they had to\ndo! And to shatter the strong, to spoil great hopes, to cast\nsuspicion on the delight in beauty, to break down everything\nautonomous, manly, conquering, and imperious—all instincts which\nare natural to the highest and most successful type of “man\"—\ninto uncertainty, distress of conscience, and self-destruction;\nforsooth, to invert all love of the earthly and of supremacy over\nthe earth, into hatred of the earth and earthly things—THAT is\nthe task the Church imposed on itself, and was obliged to impose,\nuntil, according to its standard of value, “unworldliness,\"\n\"unsensuousness,” and “higher man” fused into one sentiment. If\none could observe the strangely painful, equally coarse and\nrefined comedy of European Christianity with the derisive and\nimpartial eye of an Epicurean god, I should think one would never\ncease marvelling and laughing; does it not actually seem that\nsome single will has ruled over Europe for eighteen centuries in\norder to make a SUBLIME ABORTION of man? He, however, who, with\nopposite requirements (no longer Epicurean) and with some divine\nhammer in his hand, could approach this almost voluntary\ndegeneration and stunting of mankind, as exemplified in the\nEuropean Christian (Pascal, for instance), would he not have to\ncry aloud with rage, pity, and horror: “Oh, you bunglers,\npresumptuous pitiful bunglers, what have you done! Was that a\nwork for your hands? How you have hacked and botched my finest\nstone! What have you presumed to do!\"—I should say that\nChristianity has hitherto been the most portentous of\npresumptions. Men, not great enough, nor hard enough, to be\nentitled as artists to take part in fashioning MAN; men, not\nsufficiently strong and far-sighted to ALLOW, with sublime self-\nconstraint, the obvious law of the thousandfold failures and\nperishings to prevail; men, not sufficiently noble to see the\nradically different grades of rank and intervals of rank that\nseparate man from man:—SUCH men, with their “equality before\nGod,” have hitherto swayed the destiny of Europe; until at last a\ndwarfed, almost ludicrous species has been produced, a gregarious\nanimal, something obliging, sickly, mediocre, the European of the\npresent day.\nChapter IV: Apophthegms and Interludes\n\n63.

When one trains one’s conscience, it kisses one while it\nbites.\n99. THE DISAPPOINTED ONE SPEAKS—\"I listened for the echo and I\nheard only praise”.\n100. We all feign to ourselves that we are simpler than we are,\nwe thus relax ourselves away from our fellows.\n101. A discerning one might easily regard himself at present as\nthe animalization of God.\n102. Discovering reciprocal love should really disenchant the\nlover with regard to the beloved. “What! She is modest enough to\nlove even you? Or stupid enough? Or—or—-”\n103. THE DANGER IN HAPPINESS.—\"Everything now turns out best for\nme, I now love every fate:—who would like to be my fate?”\n104. Not their love of humanity, but the impotence of their love,\nprevents the Christians of today—burning us.\n105. The pia fraus is still more repugnant to the taste (the\n\"piety”) of the free spirit (the “pious man of knowledge”) than\nthe impia fraus. Hence the profound lack of judgment, in\ncomparison with the Church, characteristic of the type “free\nspirit\"—as ITS non-freedom.\n106. By means of music the very passions enjoy themselves.\n107. A sign of strong character, when once the resolution has\nbeen taken, to shut the ear even to the best counter-arguments.\nOccasionally, therefore, a will to stupidity.\n108. There is no such thing as moral phenomena, but only a moral\ninterpretation of phenomena.\n109. The criminal is often enough not equal to his deed: he\nextenuates and maligns it.\n110. The advocates of a criminal are seldom artists enough to\nturn the beautiful terribleness of the deed to the advantage of\nthe doer.\n111. Our vanity is most difficult to wound just when our pride\nhas been wounded.\n112. To him who feels himself preordained to contemplation and\nnot to belief, all believers are too noisy and obtrusive; he\nguards against them.\n113. “You want to prepossess him in your favour? Then you must be\nembarrassed before him.”\n114. The immense expectation with regard to sexual love, and the\ncoyness in this expectation, spoils all the perspectives of women\nat the outset.\n115. Where there is neither love nor hatred in the game, woman’s\nplay is mediocre.\n116. The great epochs of our life are at the points when we gain\ncourage to rebaptize our badness as the best in us.\n117. The will to overcome an emotion, is ultimately only the will\nof another, or of several other, emotions.\n118. There is an innocence of admiration: it is possessed by him\nto whom it has not yet occurred that he himself may be admired\nsome day.\n119. Our loathing of dirt may be so great as to prevent our\ncleaning ourselves—\"justifying” ourselves.\n120. Sensuality often forces the growth of love too much, so that\nits root remains weak, and is easily torn up.\n121. It is a curious thing that God learned Greek when he wished\nto turn author—and that he did not learn it better.\n122. To rejoice on account of praise is in many cases merely\npoliteness of heart—and the very opposite of vanity of spirit.\n123. Even concubinage has been corrupted—by marriage.\n124. He who exults at the stake, does not triumph over pain, but\nbecause of the fact that he does not feel pain where he expected\nit. A parable.\n125.

A nation is a detour of nature to arrive at six or seven\ngreat men.—Yes, and then to get round them.\n127. In the eyes of all true women science is hostile to the\nsense of shame.

The more abstract the truth you wish to teach, the more must\nyou allure the senses to it.\n129. The devil has the most extensive perspectives for God; on\nthat account he keeps so far away from him:—the devil, in\neffect, as the oldest friend of knowledge.\n130. What a person IS begins to betray itself when his talent\ndecreases,—when he ceases to show what he CAN do. Talent is also\nan adornment; an adornment is also a concealment.\n131. The sexes deceive themselves about each other: the reason is\nthat in reality they honour and love only themselves (or their\nown ideal, to express it more agreeably). Thus man wishes woman\nto be peaceable: but in fact woman is ESSENTIALLY unpeaceable,\nlike the cat, however well she may have assumed the peaceable\ndemeanour.\n132. One is punished best for one’s virtues.\n133. He who cannot find the way to HIS ideal, lives more\nfrivolously and shamelessly than the man without an ideal.\n134.

Pharisaism is not a deterioration of the good man; a\nconsiderable part of it is rather an essential condition of being\ngood.\n136. The one seeks an accoucheur for his thoughts, the other\nseeks some one whom he can assist: a good conversation thus\noriginates.\n137. In intercourse with scholars and artists one readily makes\nmistakes of opposite kinds: in a remarkable scholar one not\ninfrequently finds a mediocre man; and often, even in a mediocre\nartist, one finds a very remarkable man.\n138. We do the same when awake as when dreaming: we only invent\nand imagine him with whom we have intercourse—and forget it\nimmediately.\n139. In revenge and in love woman is more barbarous than man.\n140. ADVICE AS A RIDDLE.—\"If the band is not to break, bite it\nfirst—secure to make!”\n141.

Our vanity would like what we do best to pass precisely for\nwhat is most difficult to us.—Concerning the origin of many\nsystems of morals.\n144. When a woman has scholarly inclinations there is generally\nsomething wrong with her sexual nature. Barrenness itself\nconduces to a certain virility of taste; man, indeed, if I may\nsay so, is “the barren animal.”\n145. Comparing man and woman generally, one may say that woman\nwould not have the genius for adornment, if she had not the\ninstinct for the SECONDARY role.\n146.

To seduce their neighbour to a favourable opinion, and\nafterwards to believe implicitly in this opinion of their\nneighbour—who can do this conjuring trick so well as women?\n149. That which an age considers evil is usually an unseasonable\necho of what was formerly considered good—the atavism of an old\nideal.\n150. Around the hero everything becomes a tragedy; around the\ndemigod everything becomes a satyr-play; and around God\neverything becomes—what? perhaps a “world”?\n151. It is not enough to possess a talent: one must also have\nyour permission to possess it;—eh, my friends?\n152. “Where there is the tree of knowledge, there is always\nParadise”: so say the most ancient and the most modern serpents.\n153. What is done out of love always takes place beyond good and\nevil.\n154. Objection, evasion, joyous distrust, and love of irony are\nsigns of health; everything absolute belongs to pathology.\n155. The sense of the tragic increases and declines with\nsensuousness.\n156. Insanity in individuals is something rare—but in groups,\nparties, nations, and epochs it is the rule.\n157. The thought of suicide is a great consolation: by means of\nit one gets successfully through many a bad night.\n158. Not only our reason, but also our conscience, truckles to\nour strongest impulse—the tyrant in us.\n159. One MUST repay good and ill; but why just to the person who\ndid us good or ill?\n160. One no longer loves one’s knowledge sufficiently after one\nhas communicated it.\n161. Poets act shamelessly towards their experiences: they\nexploit them.\n162. “Our fellow-creature is not our neighbour, but our\nneighbour’s neighbour”:—so thinks every nation.\n163. Love brings to light the noble and hidden qualities of a\nlover—his rare and exceptional traits: it is thus liable to be\ndeceptive as to his normal character.\n164. Jesus said to his Jews: “The law was for servants;—love God\nas I love him, as his Son! What have we Sons of God to do with\nmorals!”\n165.

In praise there is more obtrusiveness than in blame.\n171. Pity has an almost ludicrous effect on a man of knowledge,\nlike tender hands on a Cyclops.\n172. One occasionally embraces some one or other, out of love to\nmankind (because one cannot embrace all); but this is what one\nmust never confess to the individual.\n173. One does not hate as long as one disesteems, but only when\none esteems equal or superior.\n174. Ye Utilitarians—ye, too, love the UTILE only as a VEHICLE\nfor your inclinations,—ye, too, really find the noise of its\nwheels insupportable!\n175.

The moral sentiment in Europe at present is perhaps as\nsubtle, belated, diverse, sensitive, and refined, as the “Science\nof Morals” belonging thereto is recent, initial, awkward, and\ncoarse-fingered:—an interesting contrast, which sometimes\nbecomes incarnate and obvious in the very person of a moralist.\nIndeed, the expression, “Science of Morals” is, in respect to\nwhat is designated thereby, far too presumptuous and counter to\nGOOD taste,—which is always a foretaste of more modest\nexpressions. One ought to avow with the utmost fairness WHAT is\nstill necessary here for a long time, WHAT is alone proper for\nthe present: namely, the collection of material, the\ncomprehensive survey and classification of an immense domain of\ndelicate sentiments of worth, and distinctions of worth, which\nlive, grow, propagate, and perish—and perhaps attempts to give a\nclear idea of the recurring and more common forms of these living\ncrystallizations—as preparation for a THEORY OF TYPES of\nmorality. To be sure, people have not hitherto been so modest.\nAll the philosophers, with a pedantic and ridiculous seriousness,\ndemanded of themselves something very much higher, more\npretentious, and ceremonious, when they concerned themselves with\nmorality as a science: they wanted to GIVE A BASIC to morality—\nand every philosopher hitherto has believed that he has given it\na basis; morality itself, however, has been regarded as something\n\"given.”  How far from their awkward pride was the seemingly\ninsignificant problem—left in dust and decay—of a description\nof forms of morality, notwithstanding that the finest hands and\nsenses could hardly be fine enough for it! It was precisely owing\nto moral philosophers’ knowing the moral facts imperfectly, in an\narbitrary epitome, or an accidental abridgement—perhaps as the\nmorality of their environment, their position, their church,\ntheir Zeitgeist, their climate and zone—it was precisely because\nthey were badly instructed with regard to nations, eras, and past\nages, and were by no means eager to know about these matters,\nthat they did not even come in sight of the real problems of\nmorals—problems which only disclose themselves by a comparison\nof MANY kinds of morality. In every “Science of Morals” hitherto,\nstrange as it may sound, the problem of morality itself has been\nOMITTED: there has been no suspicion that there was anything\nproblematic there! That which philosophers called “giving a basis\nto morality,” and endeavoured to realize, has, when seen in a\nright light, proved merely a learned form of good FAITH in\nprevailing morality, a new means of its EXPRESSION, consequently\njust a matter-of-fact within the sphere of a definite morality,\nyea, in its ultimate motive, a sort of denial that it is LAWFUL\nfor this morality to be called in question—and in any case the\nreverse of the testing, analyzing, doubting, and vivisecting of\nthis very faith. Hear, for instance, with what innocence—almost\nworthy of honour—Schopenhauer represents his own task, and draw\nyour conclusions concerning the scientificness of a “Science\"\nwhose latest master still talks in the strain of children and old\nwives: “The principle,” he says (page 136 of the Grundprobleme\nder Ethik), [Footnote: Pages 54-55 of Schopenhauer’s Basis of\nMorality, translated by Arthur B. Bullock, M.A. (1903).] “the\naxiom about the purport of which all moralists are PRACTICALLY\nagreed: neminem laede, immo omnes quantum potes juva—is REALLY\nthe proposition which all moral teachers strive to establish,\n. . . the REAL basis of ethics which has been sought, like\nthe philosopher’s stone, for centuries.\"—The difficulty of\nestablishing the proposition referred to may indeed be great—it\nis well known that Schopenhauer also was unsuccessful in his\nefforts; and whoever has thoroughly realized how absurdly false\nand sentimental this proposition is, in a world whose essence is\nWill to Power, may be reminded that Schopenhauer, although a\npessimist, ACTUALLY—played the flute . . . daily after dinner:\none may read about the matter in his biography. A question by the\nway: a pessimist, a repudiator of God and of the world, who MAKES\nA HALT at morality—who assents to morality, and plays the flute\nto laede-neminem morals, what? Is that really—a pessimist?\n187. Apart from the value of such assertions as “there is a\ncategorical imperative in us,” one can always ask: What does such\nan assertion indicate about him who makes it? There are systems\nof morals which are meant to justify their author in the eyes of\nother people; other systems of morals are meant to tranquilize\nhim, and make him self-satisfied; with other systems he wants to\ncrucify and humble himself, with others he wishes to take revenge,\nwith others to conceal himself, with others to glorify himself and\ngave superiority and distinction,—this system of morals helps its\nauthor to forget, that system makes him, or something of him,\nforgotten, many a moralist would like to exercise power and\ncreative arbitrariness over mankind, many another, perhaps, Kant\nespecially, gives us to understand by his morals that “what is\nestimable in me, is that I know how to obey—and with you it SHALL\nnot be otherwise than with me!” In short, systems of morals are\nonly a SIGN-LANGUAGE OF THE EMOTIONS.\n188. In contrast to laisser-aller, every system of morals is a\nsort of tyranny against “nature” and also against “reason”, that\nis, however, no objection, unless one should again decree by some\nsystem of morals, that all kinds of tyranny and unreasonableness\nare unlawful What is essential and invaluable in every system of\nmorals, is that it is a long constraint. In order to understand\nStoicism, or Port Royal, or Puritanism, one should remember the\nconstraint under which every language has attained to strength\nand freedom—the metrical constraint, the tyranny of rhyme and\nrhythm. How much trouble have the poets and orators of every\nnation given themselves!—not excepting some of the prose writers\nof today, in whose ear dwells an inexorable conscientiousness—\n\"for the sake of a folly,” as utilitarian bunglers say, and\nthereby deem themselves wise—\"from submission to arbitrary\nlaws,” as the anarchists say, and thereby fancy themselves\n\"free,” even free-spirited. The singular fact remains, however,\nthat everything of the nature of freedom, elegance, boldness,\ndance, and masterly certainty, which exists or has existed,\nwhether it be in thought itself, or in administration, or in\nspeaking and persuading, in art just as in conduct, has only\ndeveloped by means of the tyranny of such arbitrary law, and in\nall seriousness, it is not at all improbable that precisely this\nis “nature” and “natural\"—and not laisser-aller! Every artist\nknows how different from the state of letting himself go, is his\n\"most natural” condition, the free arranging, locating,\ndisposing, and constructing in the moments of “inspiration\"—and\nhow strictly and delicately he then obeys a thousand laws, which,\nby their very rigidness and precision, defy all formulation by\nmeans of ideas (even the most stable idea has, in comparison\ntherewith, something floating, manifold, and ambiguous in it).\nThe essential thing “in heaven and in earth” is, apparently (to\nrepeat it once more), that there should be long OBEDIENCE in the\nsame direction, there thereby results, and has always resulted in\nthe long run, something which has made life worth living; for\ninstance, virtue, art, music, dancing, reason, spirituality—\nanything whatever that is transfiguring, refined, foolish, or\ndivine. The long bondage of the spirit, the distrustful\nconstraint in the communicability of ideas, the discipline which\nthe thinker imposed on himself to think in accordance with the\nrules of a church or a court, or conformable to Aristotelian\npremises, the persistent spiritual will to interpret everything\nthat happened according to a Christian scheme, and in every\noccurrence to rediscover and justify the Christian God:—all this\nviolence, arbitrariness, severity, dreadfulness, and\nunreasonableness, has proved itself the disciplinary means\nwhereby the European spirit has attained its strength, its\nremorseless curiosity and subtle mobility; granted also that much\nirrecoverable strength and spirit had to be stifled, suffocated,\nand spoilt in the process (for here, as everywhere, “nature\"\nshows herself as she is, in all her extravagant and INDIFFERENT\nmagnificence, which is shocking, but nevertheless noble). That\nfor centuries European thinkers only thought in order to prove\nsomething-nowadays, on the contrary, we are suspicious of every\nthinker who “wishes to prove something\"—that it was always\nsettled beforehand what WAS TO BE the result of their strictest\nthinking, as it was perhaps in the Asiatic astrology of former\ntimes, or as it is still at the present day in the innocent,\nChristian-moral explanation of immediate personal events “for the\nglory of God,” or “for the good of the soul”:—this tyranny, this\narbitrariness, this severe and magnificent stupidity, has\nEDUCATED the spirit; slavery, both in the coarser and the finer\nsense, is apparently an indispensable means even of spiritual\neducation and discipline. One may look at every system of morals\nin this light: it is “nature” therein which teaches to hate the\nlaisser-aller, the too great freedom, and implants the need for\nlimited horizons, for immediate duties—it teaches the NARROWING\nOF PERSPECTIVES, and thus, in a certain sense, that stupidity is\na condition of life and development. “Thou must obey some one,\nand for a long time; OTHERWISE thou wilt come to grief, and lose\nall respect for thyself\"—this seems to me to be the moral\nimperative of nature, which is certainly neither “categorical,\"\nas old Kant wished (consequently the “otherwise”), nor does it\naddress itself to the individual (what does nature care for the\nindividual!), but to nations, races, ages, and ranks; above all,\nhowever, to the animal “man” generally, to MANKIND.\n189. Industrious races find it a great hardship to be idle: it\nwas a master stroke of ENGLISH instinct to hallow and begloom\nSunday to such an extent that the Englishman unconsciously\nhankers for his week—and work-day again:—as a kind of cleverly\ndevised, cleverly intercalated FAST, such as is also frequently\nfound in the ancient world (although, as is appropriate in\nsouthern nations, not precisely with respect to work). Many kinds\nof fasts are necessary; and wherever powerful influences and\nhabits prevail, legislators have to see that intercalary days are\nappointed, on which such impulses are fettered, and learn to\nhunger anew. Viewed from a higher standpoint, whole generations\nand epochs, when they show themselves infected with any moral\nfanaticism, seem like those intercalated periods of restraint and\nfasting, during which an impulse learns to humble and submit\nitself—at the same time also to PURIFY and SHARPEN itself;\ncertain philosophical sects likewise admit of a similar\ninterpretation (for instance, the Stoa, in the midst of Hellenic\nculture, with the atmosphere rank and overcharged with\nAphrodisiacal odours).—Here also is a hint for the explanation\nof the paradox, why it was precisely in the most Christian period\nof European history, and in general only under the pressure of\nChristian sentiments, that the sexual impulse sublimated into\nlove (amour-passion).\n190. There is something in the morality of Plato which does not\nreally belong to Plato, but which only appears in his philosophy,\none might say, in spite of him: namely, Socratism, for which he\nhimself was too noble. “No one desires to injure himself, hence\nall evil is done unwittingly. The evil man inflicts injury on\nhimself; he would not do so, however, if he knew that evil is\nevil. The evil man, therefore, is only evil through error; if one\nfree him from error one will necessarily make him—good.\"—This\nmode of reasoning savours of the POPULACE, who perceive only the\nunpleasant consequences of evil-doing, and practically judge that\n\"it is STUPID to do wrong\"; while they accept “good” as identical\nwith “useful and pleasant,” without further thought. As regards\nevery system of utilitarianism, one may at once assume that it\nhas the same origin, and follow the scent: one will seldom err.—\nPlato did all he could to interpret something refined and noble\ninto the tenets of his teacher, and above all to interpret\nhimself into them—he, the most daring of all interpreters, who\nlifted the entire Socrates out of the street, as a popular theme\nand song, to exhibit him in endless and impossible modifications\n—namely, in all his own disguises and multiplicities. In jest,\nand in Homeric language as well, what is the Platonic Socrates,\nif not— [Greek words inserted here.]\n191. The old theological problem of “Faith” and “Knowledge,” or\nmore plainly, of instinct and reason—the question whether, in\nrespect to the valuation of things, instinct deserves more\nauthority than rationality, which wants to appreciate and act\naccording to motives, according to a “Why,” that is to say, in\nconformity to purpose and utility—it is always the old moral\nproblem that first appeared in the person of Socrates, and had\ndivided men’s minds long before Christianity. Socrates himself,\nfollowing, of course, the taste of his talent—that of a\nsurpassing dialectician—took first the side of reason; and, in\nfact, what did he do all his life but laugh at the awkward\nincapacity of the noble Athenians, who were men of instinct, like\nall noble men, and could never give satisfactory answers\nconcerning the motives of their actions? In the end, however,\nthough silently and secretly, he laughed also at himself: with\nhis finer conscience and introspection, he found in himself the\nsame difficulty and incapacity. “But why\"—he said to himself—\n\"should one on that account separate oneself from the instincts!\nOne must set them right, and the reason ALSO—one must follow the\ninstincts, but at the same time persuade the reason to support\nthem with good arguments.” This was the real FALSENESS of that\ngreat and mysterious ironist; he brought his conscience up to the\npoint that he was satisfied with a kind of self-outwitting: in\nfact, he perceived the irrationality in the moral judgment.—\nPlato, more innocent in such matters, and without the craftiness\nof the plebeian, wished to prove to himself, at the expenditure\nof all his strength—the greatest strength a philosopher had ever\nexpended—that reason and instinct lead spontaneously to one\ngoal, to the good, to “God\"; and since Plato, all theologians and\nphilosophers have followed the same path—which means that in\nmatters of morality, instinct (or as Christians call it, “Faith,\"\nor as I call it, “the herd”) has hitherto triumphed. Unless one\nshould make an exception in the case of Descartes, the father of\nrationalism (and consequently the grandfather of the Revolution),\nwho recognized only the authority of reason: but reason is only a\ntool, and Descartes was superficial.\n192. Whoever has followed the history of a single science, finds\nin its development a clue to the understanding of the oldest and\ncommonest processes of all “knowledge and cognizance”: there, as\nhere, the premature hypotheses, the fictions, the good stupid\nwill to “belief,” and the lack of distrust and patience are first\ndeveloped—our senses learn late, and never learn completely, to\nbe subtle, reliable, and cautious organs of knowledge. Our eyes\nfind it easier on a given occasion to produce a picture already\noften produced, than to seize upon the divergence and novelty of\nan impression: the latter requires more force, more “morality.\"\nIt is difficult and painful for the ear to listen to anything\nnew; we hear strange music badly. When we hear another language\nspoken, we involuntarily attempt to form the sounds into words\nwith which we are more familiar and conversant—it was thus, for\nexample, that the Germans modified the spoken word ARCUBALISTA\ninto ARMBRUST (cross-bow). Our senses are also hostile and averse\nto the new; and generally, even in the “simplest” processes of\nsensation, the emotions DOMINATE—such as fear, love, hatred, and\nthe passive emotion of indolence.—As little as a reader nowadays\nreads all the single words (not to speak of syllables) of a page\n—he rather takes about five out of every twenty words at random,\nand “guesses” the probably appropriate sense to them—just as\nlittle do we see a tree correctly and completely in respect to\nits leaves, branches, colour, and shape; we find it so much\neasier to fancy the chance of a tree. Even in the midst of the\nmost remarkable experiences, we still do just the same; we\nfabricate the greater part of the experience, and can hardly be\nmade to contemplate any event, EXCEPT as “inventors” thereof. All\nthis goes to prove that from our fundamental nature and from\nremote ages we have been—ACCUSTOMED TO LYING. Or, to express it\nmore politely and hypocritically, in short, more pleasantly—one\nis much more of an artist than one is aware of.—In an animated\nconversation, I often see the face of the person with whom I am\nspeaking so clearly and sharply defined before me, according to\nthe thought he expresses, or which I believe to be evoked in his\nmind, that the degree of distinctness far exceeds the STRENGTH of\nmy visual faculty—the delicacy of the play of the muscles and of\nthe expression of the eyes MUST therefore be imagined by me.\nProbably the person put on quite a different expression, or none\nat all.\n193. Quidquid luce fuit, tenebris agit: but also contrariwise.\nWhat we experience in dreams, provided we experience it often,\npertains at last just as much to the general belongings of our\nsoul as anything “actually” experienced; by virtue thereof we are\nricher or poorer, we have a requirement more or less, and\nfinally, in broad daylight, and even in the brightest moments of\nour waking life, we are ruled to some extent by the nature of our\ndreams. Supposing that someone has often flown in his dreams, and\nthat at last, as soon as he dreams, he is conscious of the power\nand art of flying as his privilege and his peculiarly enviable\nhappiness; such a person, who believes that on the slightest\nimpulse, he can actualize all sorts of curves and angles, who\nknows the sensation of a certain divine levity, an “upwards\"\nwithout effort or constraint, a “downwards” without descending or\nlowering—without TROUBLE!—how could the man with such dream-\nexperiences and dream-habits fail to find “happiness” differently\ncoloured and defined, even in his waking hours! How could he\nfail—to long DIFFERENTLY for happiness? “Flight,” such as is\ndescribed by poets, must, when compared with his own “flying,” be\nfar too earthly, muscular, violent, far too “troublesome” for\nhim.\n194. The difference among men does not manifest itself only in\nthe difference of their lists of desirable things—in their\nregarding different good things as worth striving for, and being\ndisagreed as to the greater or less value, the order of rank, of\nthe commonly recognized desirable things:—it manifests itself\nmuch more in what they regard as actually HAVING and POSSESSING a\ndesirable thing. As regards a woman, for instance, the control\nover her body and her sexual gratification serves as an amply\nsufficient sign of ownership and possession to the more modest\nman; another with a more suspicious and ambitious thirst for\npossession, sees the “questionableness,” the mere apparentness of\nsuch ownership, and wishes to have finer tests in order to know\nespecially whether the woman not only gives herself to him, but\nalso gives up for his sake what she has or would like to have—\nonly THEN does he look upon her as “possessed.” A third, however,\nhas not even here got to the limit of his distrust and his desire\nfor possession: he asks himself whether the woman, when she gives\nup everything for him, does not perhaps do so for a phantom of\nhim; he wishes first to be thoroughly, indeed, profoundly well\nknown; in order to be loved at all he ventures to let himself be\nfound out. Only then does he feel the beloved one fully in his\npossession, when she no longer deceives herself about him, when\nshe loves him just as much for the sake of his devilry and\nconcealed insatiability, as for his goodness, patience, and\nspirituality. One man would like to possess a nation, and he\nfinds all the higher arts of Cagliostro and Catalina suitable for\nhis purpose. Another, with a more refined thirst for possession,\nsays to himself: “One may not deceive where one desires to\npossess\"—he is irritated and impatient at the idea that a mask\nof him should rule in the hearts of the people: “I must,\ntherefore, MAKE myself known, and first of all learn to know\nmyself!” Among helpful and charitable people, one almost always\nfinds the awkward craftiness which first gets up suitably him who\nhas to be helped, as though, for instance, he should “merit\"\nhelp, seek just THEIR help, and would show himself deeply\ngrateful, attached, and subservient to them for all help. With\nthese conceits, they take control of the needy as a property,\njust as in general they are charitable and helpful out of a\ndesire for property. One finds them jealous when they are crossed\nor forestalled in their charity. Parents involuntarily make\nsomething like themselves out of their children—they call that\n\"education\"; no mother doubts at the bottom of her heart that the\nchild she has borne is thereby her property, no father hesitates\nabout his right to HIS OWN ideas and notions of worth. Indeed, in\nformer times fathers deemed it right to use their discretion\nconcerning the life or death of the newly born (as among the\nancient Germans). And like the father, so also do the teacher,\nthe class, the priest, and the prince still see in every new\nindividual an unobjectionable opportunity for a new possession.\nThe consequence is . . .\n195. The Jews—a people “born for slavery,” as Tacitus and the\nwhole ancient world say of them; “the chosen people among the\nnations,” as they themselves say and believe—the Jews performed\nthe miracle of the inversion of valuations, by means of which\nlife on earth obtained a new and dangerous charm for a couple of\nmillenniums. Their prophets fused into one the expressions\n\"rich,” “godless,” “wicked,” “violent,” “sensual,” and for the\nfirst time coined the word “world” as a term of reproach. In this\ninversion of valuations (in which is also included the use of the\nword “poor” as synonymous with “saint” and “friend”) the\nsignificance of the Jewish people is to be found; it is with THEM\nthat the SLAVE-INSURRECTION IN MORALS commences.\n196. It is to be INFERRED that there are countless dark bodies\nnear the sun—such as we shall never see. Among ourselves, this\nis an allegory; and the psychologist of morals reads the whole\nstar-writing merely as an allegorical and symbolic language in\nwhich much may be unexpressed.\n197. The beast of prey and the man of prey (for instance, Caesar\nBorgia) are fundamentally misunderstood, “nature” is\nmisunderstood, so long as one seeks a “morbidness” in the\nconstitution of these healthiest of all tropical monsters and\ngrowths, or even an innate “hell” in them—as almost all\nmoralists have done hitherto. Does it not seem that there is a\nhatred of the virgin forest and of the tropics among moralists?\nAnd that the “tropical man” must be discredited at all costs,\nwhether as disease and deterioration of mankind, or as his own\nhell and self-torture? And why? In favour of the “temperate\nzones”? In favour of the temperate men? The “moral”? The\nmediocre?—This for the chapter: “Morals as Timidity.”\n198. All the systems of morals which address themselves with a\nview to their “happiness,” as it is called—what else are they\nbut suggestions for behaviour adapted to the degree of DANGER\nfrom themselves in which the individuals live; recipes for their\npassions, their good and bad propensities, insofar as such have\nthe Will to Power and would like to play the master; small and\ngreat expediencies and elaborations, permeated with the musty\nodour of old family medicines and old-wife wisdom; all of them\ngrotesque and absurd in their form—because they address\nthemselves to “all,” because they generalize where generalization\nis not authorized; all of them speaking unconditionally, and\ntaking themselves unconditionally; all of them flavoured not\nmerely with one grain of salt, but rather endurable only, and\nsometimes even seductive, when they are over-spiced and begin to\nsmell dangerously, especially of “the other world.” That is all\nof little value when estimated intellectually, and is far from\nbeing “science,” much less “wisdom\"; but, repeated once more, and\nthree times repeated, it is expediency, expediency, expediency,\nmixed with stupidity, stupidity, stupidity—whether it be the\nindifference and statuesque coldness towards the heated folly of\nthe emotions, which the Stoics advised and fostered; or the no-\nmore-laughing and no-more-weeping of Spinoza, the destruction of\nthe emotions by their analysis and vivisection, which he\nrecommended so naively; or the lowering of the emotions to an\ninnocent mean at which they may be satisfied, the Aristotelianism\nof morals; or even morality as the enjoyment of the emotions in a\nvoluntary attenuation and spiritualization by the symbolism of\nart, perhaps as music, or as love of God, and of mankind for\nGod’s sake—for in religion the passions are once more\nenfranchised, provided that . . . ; or, finally, even the complaisant\nand wanton surrender to the emotions, as has been taught by Hafis\nand Goethe, the bold letting-go of the reins, the spiritual and\ncorporeal licentia morum in the exceptional cases of wise old\ncodgers and drunkards, with whom it “no longer has much danger.\"\n—This also for the chapter: “Morals as Timidity.”\n199. Inasmuch as in all ages, as long as mankind has existed,\nthere have also been human herds (family alliances, communities,\ntribes, peoples, states, churches), and always a great number who\nobey in proportion to the small number who command—in view,\ntherefore, of the fact that obedience has been most practiced and\nfostered among mankind hitherto, one may reasonably suppose that,\ngenerally speaking, the need thereof is now innate in every one,\nas a kind of FORMAL CONSCIENCE which gives the command “Thou\nshalt unconditionally do something, unconditionally refrain from\nsomething”, in short, “Thou shalt”. This need tries to satisfy\nitself and to fill its form with a content, according to its\nstrength, impatience, and eagerness, it at once seizes as an\nomnivorous appetite with little selection, and accepts whatever\nis shouted into its ear by all sorts of commanders—parents,\nteachers, laws, class prejudices, or public opinion. The\nextraordinary limitation of human development, the hesitation,\nprotractedness, frequent retrogression, and turning thereof, is\nattributable to the fact that the herd-instinct of obedience is\ntransmitted best, and at the cost of the art of command. If one\nimagine this instinct increasing to its greatest extent,\ncommanders and independent individuals will finally be lacking\naltogether, or they will suffer inwardly from a bad conscience,\nand will have to impose a deception on themselves in the first\nplace in order to be able to command just as if they also were\nonly obeying. This condition of things actually exists in Europe\nat present—I call it the moral hypocrisy of the commanding\nclass. They know no other way of protecting themselves from their\nbad conscience than by playing the role of executors of older and\nhigher orders (of predecessors, of the constitution, of justice,\nof the law, or of God himself), or they even justify themselves\nby maxims from the current opinions of the herd, as “first\nservants of their people,” or “instruments of the public weal”.\nOn the other hand, the gregarious European man nowadays assumes\nan air as if he were the only kind of man that is allowable, he\nglorifies his qualities, such as public spirit, kindness,\ndeference, industry, temperance, modesty, indulgence, sympathy,\nby virtue of which he is gentle, endurable, and useful to the\nherd, as the peculiarly human virtues. In cases, however, where\nit is believed that the leader and bell-wether cannot be\ndispensed with, attempt after attempt is made nowadays to replace\ncommanders by the summing together of clever gregarious men all\nrepresentative constitutions, for example, are of this origin. In\nspite of all, what a blessing, what a deliverance from a weight\nbecoming unendurable, is the appearance of an absolute ruler for\nthese gregarious Europeans—of this fact the effect of the\nappearance of Napoleon was the last great proof the history of\nthe influence of Napoleon is almost the history of the higher\nhappiness to which the entire century has attained in its\nworthiest individuals and periods.\n200. The man of an age of dissolution which mixes the races with\none another, who has the inheritance of a diversified descent in\nhis body—that is to say, contrary, and often not only contrary,\ninstincts and standards of value, which struggle with one another\nand are seldom at peace—such a man of late culture and broken\nlights, will, on an average, be a weak man. His fundamental\ndesire is that the war which is IN HIM should come to an end;\nhappiness appears to him in the character of a soothing medicine\nand mode of thought (for instance, Epicurean or Christian); it is\nabove all things the happiness of repose, of undisturbedness, of\nrepletion, of final unity—it is the “Sabbath of Sabbaths,” to\nuse the expression of the holy rhetorician, St. Augustine, who\nwas himself such a man.—Should, however, the contrariety and\nconflict in such natures operate as an ADDITIONAL incentive and\nstimulus to life—and if, on the other hand, in addition to their\npowerful and irreconcilable instincts, they have also inherited\nand indoctrinated into them a proper mastery and subtlety for\ncarrying on the conflict with themselves (that is to say, the\nfaculty of self-control and self-deception), there then arise\nthose marvelously incomprehensible and inexplicable beings, those\nenigmatical men, predestined for conquering and circumventing\nothers, the finest examples of which are Alcibiades and Caesar\n(with whom I should like to associate the FIRST of Europeans\naccording to my taste, the Hohenstaufen, Frederick the Second),\nand among artists, perhaps Leonardo da Vinci. They appear\nprecisely in the same periods when that weaker type, with its\nlonging for repose, comes to the front; the two types are\ncomplementary to each other, and spring from the same causes.\n201. As long as the utility which determines moral estimates is\nonly gregarious utility, as long as the preservation of the\ncommunity is only kept in view, and the immoral is sought\nprecisely and exclusively in what seems dangerous to the\nmaintenance of the community, there can be no “morality of love\nto one’s neighbour.” Granted even that there is already a little\nconstant exercise of consideration, sympathy, fairness,\ngentleness, and mutual assistance, granted that even in this\ncondition of society all those instincts are already active which\nare latterly distinguished by honourable names as “virtues,” and\neventually almost coincide with the conception “morality”: in\nthat period they do not as yet belong to the domain of moral\nvaluations—they are still ULTRA-MORAL. A sympathetic action, for\ninstance, is neither called good nor bad, moral nor immoral, in\nthe best period of the Romans; and should it be praised, a sort\nof resentful disdain is compatible with this praise, even at the\nbest, directly the sympathetic action is compared with one which\ncontributes to the welfare of the whole, to the RES PUBLICA.\nAfter all, “love to our neighbour” is always a secondary matter,\npartly conventional and arbitrarily manifested in relation to our\nFEAR OF OUR NEIGHBOUR. After the fabric of society seems on the\nwhole established and secured against external dangers, it is\nthis fear of our neighbour which again creates new perspectives\nof moral valuation. Certain strong and dangerous instincts, such\nas the love of enterprise, foolhardiness, revengefulness,\nastuteness, rapacity, and love of power, which up till then had\nnot only to be honoured from the point of view of general\nutility—under other names, of course, than those here given—but\nhad to be fostered and cultivated (because they were perpetually\nrequired in the common danger against the common enemies), are\nnow felt in their dangerousness to be doubly strong—when the\noutlets for them are lacking—and are gradually branded as\nimmoral and given over to calumny. The contrary instincts and\ninclinations now attain to moral honour, the gregarious instinct\ngradually draws its conclusions. How much or how little\ndangerousness to the community or to equality is contained in an\nopinion, a condition, an emotion, a disposition, or an endowment—\nthat is now the moral perspective, here again fear is the mother\nof morals. It is by the loftiest and strongest instincts, when\nthey break out passionately and carry the individual far above\nand beyond the average, and the low level of the gregarious\nconscience, that the self-reliance of the community is destroyed,\nits belief in itself, its backbone, as it were, breaks,\nconsequently these very instincts will be most branded and\ndefamed. The lofty independent spirituality, the will to stand\nalone, and even the cogent reason, are felt to be dangers,\neverything that elevates the individual above the herd, and is a\nsource of fear to the neighbour, is henceforth called EVIL, the\ntolerant, unassuming, self-adapting, self-equalizing disposition,\nthe MEDIOCRITY of desires, attains to moral distinction and\nhonour. Finally, under very peaceful circumstances, there is\nalways less opportunity and necessity for training the feelings\nto severity and rigour, and now every form of severity, even in\njustice, begins to disturb the conscience, a lofty and rigorous\nnobleness and self-responsibility almost offends, and awakens\ndistrust, “the lamb,” and still more “the sheep,” wins respect.\nThere is a point of diseased mellowness and effeminacy in the\nhistory of society, at which society itself takes the part of him\nwho injures it, the part of the CRIMINAL, and does so, in fact,\nseriously and honestly. To punish, appears to it to be somehow\nunfair—it is certain that the idea of “punishment” and “the\nobligation to punish” are then painful and alarming to people.\n\"Is it not sufficient if the criminal be rendered HARMLESS? Why\nshould we still punish? Punishment itself is terrible!\"—with\nthese questions gregarious morality, the morality of fear, draws\nits ultimate conclusion. If one could at all do away with danger,\nthe cause of fear, one would have done away with this morality at\nthe same time, it would no longer be necessary, it WOULD NOT\nCONSIDER ITSELF any longer necessary!—Whoever examines the\nconscience of the present-day European, will always elicit the\nsame imperative from its thousand moral folds and hidden\nrecesses, the imperative of the timidity of the herd “we wish\nthat some time or other there may be NOTHING MORE TO FEAR!” Some\ntime or other—the will and the way THERETO is nowadays called\n\"progress” all over Europe.\n202. Let us at once say again what we have already said a hundred\ntimes, for people’s ears nowadays are unwilling to hear such\ntruths—OUR truths. We know well enough how offensive it sounds\nwhen any one plainly, and without metaphor, counts man among the\nanimals, but it will be accounted to us almost a CRIME, that it\nis precisely in respect to men of “modern ideas” that we have\nconstantly applied the terms “herd,” “herd-instincts,” and such\nlike expressions. What avail is it? We cannot do otherwise, for\nit is precisely here that our new insight is. We have found that\nin all the principal moral judgments, Europe has become\nunanimous, including likewise the countries where European\ninfluence prevails in Europe people evidently KNOW what Socrates\nthought he did not know, and what the famous serpent of old once\npromised to teach—they “know” today what is good and evil. It\nmust then sound hard and be distasteful to the ear, when we\nalways insist that that which here thinks it knows, that which\nhere glorifies itself with praise and blame, and calls itself\ngood, is the instinct of the herding human animal, the instinct\nwhich has come and is ever coming more and more to the front, to\npreponderance and supremacy over other instincts, according to\nthe increasing physiological approximation and resemblance of\nwhich it is the symptom. MORALITY IN EUROPE AT PRESENT IS\nHERDING-ANIMAL MORALITY, and therefore, as we understand the\nmatter, only one kind of human morality, beside which, before\nwhich, and after which many other moralities, and above all\nHIGHER moralities, are or should be possible. Against such a\n\"possibility,” against such a “should be,” however, this morality\ndefends itself with all its strength, it says obstinately and\ninexorably “I am morality itself and nothing else is morality!\"\nIndeed, with the help of a religion which has humoured and\nflattered the sublimest desires of the herding-animal, things\nhave reached such a point that we always find a more visible\nexpression of this morality even in political and social\narrangements: the DEMOCRATIC movement is the inheritance of the\nChristian movement. That its TEMPO, however, is much too slow and\nsleepy for the more impatient ones, for those who are sick and\ndistracted by the herding-instinct, is indicated by the\nincreasingly furious howling, and always less disguised teeth-\ngnashing of the anarchist dogs, who are now roving through the\nhighways of European culture. Apparently in opposition to the\npeacefully industrious democrats and Revolution-ideologues, and\nstill more so to the awkward philosophasters and fraternity-\nvisionaries who call themselves Socialists and want a “free\nsociety,” those are really at one with them all in their thorough\nand instinctive hostility to every form of society other than\nthat of the AUTONOMOUS herd (to the extent even of repudiating\nthe notions “master” and “servant\"—ni dieu ni maitre, says a\nsocialist formula); at one in their tenacious opposition to every\nspecial claim, every special right and privilege (this means\nultimately opposition to EVERY right, for when all are equal, no\none needs “rights” any longer); at one in their distrust of\npunitive justice (as though it were a violation of the weak,\nunfair to the NECESSARY consequences of all former society); but\nequally at one in their religion of sympathy, in their compassion\nfor all that feels, lives, and suffers (down to the very animals,\nup even to “God\"—the extravagance of “sympathy for God” belongs\nto a democratic age); altogether at one in the cry and impatience\nof their sympathy, in their deadly hatred of suffering generally,\nin their almost feminine incapacity for witnessing it or ALLOWING\nit; at one in their involuntary beglooming and heart-softening,\nunder the spell of which Europe seems to be threatened with a new\nBuddhism; at one in their belief in the morality of MUTUAL\nsympathy, as though it were morality in itself, the climax, the\nATTAINED climax of mankind, the sole hope of the future, the\nconsolation of the present, the great discharge from all the\nobligations of the past; altogether at one in their belief in the\ncommunity as the DELIVERER, in the herd, and therefore in\n\"themselves.”\n203. We, who hold a different belief—we, who regard the\ndemocratic movement, not only as a degenerating form of political\norganization, but as equivalent to a degenerating, a waning type\nof man, as involving his mediocrising and depreciation: where\nhave WE to fix our hopes? In NEW PHILOSOPHERS—there is no other\nalternative: in minds strong and original enough to initiate\nopposite estimates of value, to transvalue and invert “eternal\nvaluations\"; in forerunners, in men of the future, who in the\npresent shall fix the constraints and fasten the knots which will\ncompel millenniums to take NEW paths. To teach man the future of\nhumanity as his WILL, as depending on human will, and to make\npreparation for vast hazardous enterprises and collective\nattempts in rearing and educating, in order thereby to put an end\nto the frightful rule of folly and chance which has hitherto gone\nby the name of “history” (the folly of the “greatest number” is\nonly its last form)—for that purpose a new type of philosopher\nand commander will some time or other be needed, at the very idea\nof which everything that has existed in the way of occult,\nterrible, and benevolent beings might look pale and dwarfed. The\nimage of such leaders hovers before OUR eyes:—is it lawful for\nme to say it aloud, ye free spirits? The conditions which one\nwould partly have to create and partly utilize for their genesis;\nthe presumptive methods and tests by virtue of which a soul\nshould grow up to such an elevation and power as to feel a\nCONSTRAINT to these tasks; a transvaluation of values, under the\nnew pressure and hammer of which a conscience should be steeled\nand a heart transformed into brass, so as to bear the weight of\nsuch responsibility; and on the other hand the necessity for such\nleaders, the dreadful danger that they might be lacking, or\nmiscarry and degenerate:—these are OUR real anxieties and\nglooms, ye know it well, ye free spirits! these are the heavy\ndistant thoughts and storms which sweep across the heaven of OUR\nlife. There are few pains so grievous as to have seen, divined,\nor experienced how an exceptional man has missed his way and\ndeteriorated; but he who has the rare eye for the universal\ndanger of “man” himself DETERIORATING, he who like us has\nrecognized the extraordinary fortuitousness which has hitherto\nplayed its game in respect to the future of mankind—a game in\nwhich neither the hand, nor even a “finger of God” has\nparticipated!—he who divines the fate that is hidden under the\nidiotic unwariness and blind confidence of “modern ideas,” and\nstill more under the whole of Christo-European morality-suffers\nfrom an anguish with which no other is to be compared. He sees at\na glance all that could still BE MADE OUT OF MAN through a\nfavourable accumulation and augmentation of human powers and\narrangements; he knows with all the knowledge of his conviction\nhow unexhausted man still is for the greatest possibilities, and\nhow often in the past the type man has stood in presence of\nmysterious decisions and new paths:—he knows still better from\nhis painfulest recollections on what wretched obstacles promising\ndevelopments of the highest rank have hitherto usually gone to\npieces, broken down, sunk, and become contemptible. The UNIVERSAL\nDEGENERACY OF MANKIND to the level of the “man of the future\"—as\nidealized by the socialistic fools and shallow-pates—this\ndegeneracy and dwarfing of man to an absolutely gregarious animal\n(or as they call it, to a man of “free society”), this\nbrutalizing of man into a pigmy with equal rights and claims, is\nundoubtedly POSSIBLE! He who has thought out this possibility to\nits ultimate conclusion knows ANOTHER loathing unknown to the\nrest of mankind—and perhaps also a new MISSION!\nChapter VI: We Scholars\n\n204. At the risk that moralizing may also reveal itself here as\nthat which it has always been—namely, resolutely MONTRER SES\nPLAIES, according to Balzac—I would venture to protest against\nan improper and injurious alteration of rank, which quite\nunnoticed, and as if with the best conscience, threatens nowadays\nto establish itself in the relations of science and philosophy. I\nmean to say that one must have the right out of one’s own\nEXPERIENCE—experience, as it seems to me, always implies\nunfortunate experience?—to treat of such an important question\nof rank, so as not to speak of colour like the blind, or AGAINST\nscience like women and artists (\"Ah! this dreadful science!” sigh\ntheir instinct and their shame, “it always FINDS THINGS OUT!”).\nThe declaration of independence of the scientific man, his\nemancipation from philosophy, is one of the subtler after-effects\nof democratic organization and disorganization: the self-\nglorification and self-conceitedness of the learned man is now\neverywhere in full bloom, and in its best springtime—which does\nnot mean to imply that in this case self-praise smells sweet.\nHere also the instinct of the populace cries, “Freedom from all\nmasters!” and after science has, with the happiest results,\nresisted theology, whose “hand-maid” it had been too long, it now\nproposes in its wantonness and indiscretion to lay down laws for\nphilosophy, and in its turn to play the “master\"—what am I\nsaying! to play the PHILOSOPHER on its own account. My memory—\nthe memory of a scientific man, if you please!—teems with the\nnaivetes of insolence which I have heard about philosophy and\nphilosophers from young naturalists and old physicians (not to\nmention the most cultured and most conceited of all learned men,\nthe philologists and schoolmasters, who are both the one and the\nother by profession). On one occasion it was the specialist and\nthe Jack Horner who instinctively stood on the defensive against\nall synthetic tasks and capabilities; at another time it was the\nindustrious worker who had got a scent of OTIUM and refined\nluxuriousness in the internal economy of the philosopher, and\nfelt himself aggrieved and belittled thereby. On another occasion\nit was the colour-blindness of the utilitarian, who sees nothing\nin philosophy but a series of REFUTED systems, and an extravagant\nexpenditure which “does nobody any good”. At another time the\nfear of disguised mysticism and of the boundary-adjustment of\nknowledge became conspicuous, at another time the disregard of\nindividual philosophers, which had involuntarily extended to\ndisregard of philosophy generally. In fine, I found most\nfrequently, behind the proud disdain of philosophy in young\nscholars, the evil after-effect of some particular philosopher,\nto whom on the whole obedience had been foresworn, without,\nhowever, the spell of his scornful estimates of other\nphilosophers having been got rid of—the result being a general\nill-will to all philosophy. (Such seems to me, for instance, the\nafter-effect of Schopenhauer on the most modern Germany: by his\nunintelligent rage against Hegel, he has succeeded in severing\nthe whole of the last generation of Germans from its connection\nwith German culture, which culture, all things considered, has\nbeen an elevation and a divining refinement of the HISTORICAL\nSENSE, but precisely at this point Schopenhauer himself was poor,\nirreceptive, and un-German to the extent of ingeniousness.) On\nthe whole, speaking generally, it may just have been the\nhumanness, all-too-humanness of the modern philosophers\nthemselves, in short, their contemptibleness, which has injured\nmost radically the reverence for philosophy and opened the doors\nto the instinct of the populace. Let it but be acknowledged to\nwhat an extent our modern world diverges from the whole style of\nthe world of Heraclitus, Plato, Empedocles, and whatever else all\nthe royal and magnificent anchorites of the spirit were called,\nand with what justice an honest man of science MAY feel himself\nof a better family and origin, in view of such representatives of\nphilosophy, who, owing to the fashion of the present day, are\njust as much aloft as they are down below—in Germany, for\ninstance, the two lions of Berlin, the anarchist Eugen Duhring\nand the amalgamist Eduard von Hartmann. It is especially the\nsight of those hotch-potch philosophers, who call themselves\n\"realists,” or “positivists,” which is calculated to implant a\ndangerous distrust in the soul of a young and ambitious scholar\nthose philosophers, at the best, are themselves but scholars and\nspecialists, that is very evident! All of them are persons who\nhave been vanquished and BROUGHT BACK AGAIN under the dominion of\nscience, who at one time or another claimed more from themselves,\nwithout having a right to the “more” and its responsibility—and\nwho now, creditably, rancorously, and vindictively, represent in\nword and deed, DISBELIEF in the master-task and supremacy of\nphilosophy After all, how could it be otherwise? Science\nflourishes nowadays and has the good conscience clearly visible\non its countenance, while that to which the entire modern\nphilosophy has gradually sunk, the remnant of philosophy of the\npresent day, excites distrust and displeasure, if not scorn and\npity Philosophy reduced to a “theory of knowledge,” no more in\nfact than a diffident science of epochs and doctrine of\nforbearance a philosophy that never even gets beyond the\nthreshold, and rigorously DENIES itself the right to enter—that\nis philosophy in its last throes, an end, an agony, something\nthat awakens pity. How could such a philosophy—RULE!\n205. The dangers that beset the evolution of the philosopher are,\nin fact, so manifold nowadays, that one might doubt whether this\nfruit could still come to maturity. The extent and towering\nstructure of the sciences have increased enormously, and\ntherewith also the probability that the philosopher will grow\ntired even as a learner, or will attach himself somewhere and\n\"specialize” so that he will no longer attain to his elevation,\nthat is to say, to his superspection, his circumspection, and his\nDESPECTION. Or he gets aloft too late, when the best of his\nmaturity and strength is past, or when he is impaired, coarsened,\nand deteriorated, so that his view, his general estimate of\nthings, is no longer of much importance. It is perhaps just the\nrefinement of his intellectual conscience that makes him hesitate\nand linger on the way, he dreads the temptation to become a\ndilettante, a millepede, a milleantenna, he knows too well that\nas a discerner, one who has lost his self-respect no longer\ncommands, no longer LEADS, unless he should aspire to become a\ngreat play-actor, a philosophical Cagliostro and spiritual rat-\ncatcher—in short, a misleader. This is in the last instance a\nquestion of taste, if it has not really been a question of\nconscience. To double once more the philosopher’s difficulties,\nthere is also the fact that he demands from himself a verdict, a\nYea or Nay, not concerning science, but concerning life and the\nworth of life—he learns unwillingly to believe that it is his\nright and even his duty to obtain this verdict, and he has to\nseek his way to the right and the belief only through the most\nextensive (perhaps disturbing and destroying) experiences, often\nhesitating, doubting, and dumbfounded. In fact, the philosopher\nhas long been mistaken and confused by the multitude, either with\nthe scientific man and ideal scholar, or with the religiously\nelevated, desensualized, desecularized visionary and God-\nintoxicated man; and even yet when one hears anybody praised,\nbecause he lives “wisely,” or “as a philosopher,” it hardly means\nanything more than “prudently and apart.” Wisdom: that seems to\nthe populace to be a kind of flight, a means and artifice for\nwithdrawing successfully from a bad game; but the GENUINE\nphilosopher—does it not seem so to US, my friends?—lives\n\"unphilosophically” and “unwisely,” above all, IMPRUDENTLY, and\nfeels the obligation and burden of a hundred attempts and\ntemptations of life—he risks HIMSELF constantly, he plays THIS\nbad game.\n206. In relation to the genius, that is to say, a being who\neither ENGENDERS or PRODUCES—both words understood in their\nfullest sense—the man of learning, the scientific average man,\nhas always something of the old maid about him; for, like her, he\nis not conversant with the two principal functions of man. To\nboth, of course, to the scholar and to the old maid, one concedes\nrespectability, as if by way of indemnification—in these cases\none emphasizes the respectability—and yet, in the compulsion of\nthis concession, one has the same admixture of vexation. Let us\nexamine more closely: what is the scientific man? Firstly, a\ncommonplace type of man, with commonplace virtues: that is to\nsay, a non-ruling, non-authoritative, and non-self-sufficient\ntype of man; he possesses industry, patient adaptableness to rank\nand file, equability and moderation in capacity and requirement;\nhe has the instinct for people like himself, and for that which\nthey require—for instance: the portion of independence and green\nmeadow without which there is no rest from labour, the claim to\nhonour and consideration (which first and foremost presupposes\nrecognition and recognisability), the sunshine of a good name,\nthe perpetual ratification of his value and usefulness, with\nwhich the inward DISTRUST which lies at the bottom of the heart\nof all dependent men and gregarious animals, has again and again\nto be overcome. The learned man, as is appropriate, has also\nmaladies and faults of an ignoble kind: he is full of petty envy,\nand has a lynx-eye for the weak points in those natures to whose\nelevations he cannot attain. He is confiding, yet only as one who\nlets himself go, but does not FLOW; and precisely before the man\nof the great current he stands all the colder and more reserved—\nhis eye is then like a smooth and irresponsive lake, which is no\nlonger moved by rapture or sympathy. The worst and most dangerous\nthing of which a scholar is capable results from the instinct of\nmediocrity of his type, from the Jesuitism of mediocrity, which\nlabours instinctively for the destruction of the exceptional man,\nand endeavours to break—or still better, to relax—every bent\nbow To relax, of course, with consideration, and naturally with\nan indulgent hand—to RELAX with confiding sympathy that is the\nreal art of Jesuitism, which has always understood how to\nintroduce itself as the religion of sympathy.\n207. However gratefully one may welcome the OBJECTIVE spirit—and\nwho has not been sick to death of all subjectivity and its\nconfounded IPSISIMOSITY!—in the end, however, one must learn\ncaution even with regard to one’s gratitude, and put a stop to\nthe exaggeration with which the unselfing and depersonalizing of\nthe spirit has recently been celebrated, as if it were the goal\nin itself, as if it were salvation and glorification—as is\nespecially accustomed to happen in the pessimist school, which\nhas also in its turn good reasons for paying the highest honours\nto “disinterested knowledge” The objective man, who no longer\ncurses and scolds like the pessimist, the IDEAL man of learning\nin whom the scientific instinct blossoms forth fully after a\nthousand complete and partial failures, is assuredly one of the\nmost costly instruments that exist, but his place is in the hand\nof one who is more powerful He is only an instrument, we may say,\nhe is a MIRROR—he is no “purpose in himself” The objective man\nis in truth a mirror accustomed to prostration before everything\nthat wants to be known, with such desires only as knowing or\n\"reflecting” implies—he waits until something comes, and then\nexpands himself sensitively, so that even the light footsteps and\ngliding-past of spiritual beings may not be lost on his surface\nand film Whatever “personality” he still possesses seems to him\naccidental, arbitrary, or still oftener, disturbing, so much has\nhe come to regard himself as the passage and reflection of\noutside forms and events He calls up the recollection of\n\"himself” with an effort, and not infrequently wrongly, he\nreadily confounds himself with other persons, he makes mistakes\nwith regard to his own needs, and here only is he unrefined and\nnegligent Perhaps he is troubled about the health, or the\npettiness and confined atmosphere of wife and friend, or the lack\nof companions and society—indeed, he sets himself to reflect on\nhis suffering, but in vain! His thoughts already rove away to the\nMORE GENERAL case, and tomorrow he knows as little as he knew\nyesterday how to help himself He does not now take himself\nseriously and devote time to himself he is serene, NOT from lack\nof trouble, but from lack of capacity for grasping and dealing\nwith HIS trouble The habitual complaisance with respect to all\nobjects and experiences, the radiant and impartial hospitality\nwith which he receives everything that comes his way, his habit\nof inconsiderate good-nature, of dangerous indifference as to Yea\nand Nay: alas! there are enough of cases in which he has to atone\nfor these virtues of his!—and as man generally, he becomes far\ntoo easily the CAPUT MORTUUM of such virtues. Should one wish\nlove or hatred from him—I mean love and hatred as God, woman,\nand animal understand them—he will do what he can, and furnish\nwhat he can. But one must not be surprised if it should not be\nmuch—if he should show himself just at this point to be false,\nfragile, questionable, and deteriorated. His love is constrained,\nhis hatred is artificial, and rather UNN TOUR DE FORCE, a slight\nostentation and exaggeration. He is only genuine so far as he can\nbe objective; only in his serene totality is he still “nature\"\nand “natural.” His mirroring and eternally self-polishing soul no\nlonger knows how to affirm, no longer how to deny; he does not\ncommand; neither does he destroy. “JE NE MEPRISE PRESQUE RIEN\"—\nhe says, with Leibniz: let us not overlook nor undervalue the\nPRESQUE! Neither is he a model man; he does not go in advance of\nany one, nor after, either; he places himself generally too far\noff to have any reason for espousing the cause of either good or\nevil. If he has been so long confounded with the PHILOSOPHER,\nwith the Caesarian trainer and dictator of civilization, he has\nhad far too much honour, and what is more essential in him has\nbeen overlooked—he is an instrument, something of a slave,\nthough certainly the sublimest sort of slave, but nothing in\nhimself—PRESQUE RIEN! The objective man is an instrument, a\ncostly, easily injured, easily tarnished measuring instrument and\nmirroring apparatus, which is to be taken care of and respected;\nbut he is no goal, not outgoing nor upgoing, no complementary man\nin whom the REST of existence justifies itself, no termination—\nand still less a commencement, an engendering, or primary cause,\nnothing hardy, powerful, self-centred, that wants to be master;\nbut rather only a soft, inflated, delicate, movable potter’s-\nform, that must wait for some kind of content and frame to\n\"shape” itself thereto—for the most part a man without frame and\ncontent, a “selfless” man. Consequently, also, nothing for women,\nIN PARENTHESI.\n208. When a philosopher nowadays makes known that he is not a\nskeptic—I hope that has been gathered from the foregoing\ndescription of the objective spirit?—people all hear it\nimpatiently; they regard him on that account with some\napprehension, they would like to ask so many, many questions . . .\nindeed among timid hearers, of whom there are now so many, he is\nhenceforth said to be dangerous. With his repudiation of\nskepticism, it seems to them as if they heard some evil-\nthreatening sound in the distance, as if a new kind of explosive\nwere being tried somewhere, a dynamite of the spirit, perhaps a\nnewly discovered Russian NIHILINE, a pessimism BONAE VOLUNTATIS,\nthat not only denies, means denial, but-dreadful thought!\nPRACTISES denial. Against this kind of “good-will\"—a will to the\nveritable, actual negation of life—there is, as is generally\nacknowledged nowadays, no better soporific and sedative than\nskepticism, the mild, pleasing, lulling poppy of skepticism; and\nHamlet himself is now prescribed by the doctors of the day as an\nantidote to the “spirit,” and its underground noises. “Are not\nour ears already full of bad sounds?” say the skeptics, as lovers\nof repose, and almost as a kind of safety police; “this\nsubterranean Nay is terrible! Be still, ye pessimistic moles!\"\nThe skeptic, in effect, that delicate creature, is far too easily\nfrightened; his conscience is schooled so as to start at every\nNay, and even at that sharp, decided Yea, and feels something\nlike a bite thereby. Yea! and Nay!—they seem to him opposed to\nmorality; he loves, on the contrary, to make a festival to his\nvirtue by a noble aloofness, while perhaps he says with\nMontaigne: “What do I know?” Or with Socrates: “I know that I\nknow nothing.” Or: “Here I do not trust myself, no door is open\nto me.” Or: “Even if the door were open, why should I enter\nimmediately?” Or: “What is the use of any hasty hypotheses? It\nmight quite well be in good taste to make no hypotheses at all.\nAre you absolutely obliged to straighten at once what is crooked?\nto stuff every hole with some kind of oakum? Is there not time\nenough for that? Has not the time leisure? Oh, ye demons, can ye\nnot at all WAIT? The uncertain also has its charms, the Sphinx,\ntoo, is a Circe, and Circe, too, was a philosopher.\"—Thus does a\nskeptic console himself; and in truth he needs some consolation.\nFor skepticism is the most spiritual expression of a certain\nmany-sided physiological temperament, which in ordinary language\nis called nervous debility and sickliness; it arises whenever\nraces or classes which have been long separated, decisively and\nsuddenly blend with one another. In the new generation, which has\ninherited as it were different standards and valuations in its\nblood, everything is disquiet, derangement, doubt, and\ntentativeness; the best powers operate restrictively, the very\nvirtues prevent each other growing and becoming strong,\nequilibrium, ballast, and perpendicular stability are lacking in\nbody and soul. That, however, which is most diseased and\ndegenerated in such nondescripts is the WILL; they are no longer\nfamiliar with independence of decision, or the courageous feeling\nof pleasure in willing—they are doubtful of the “freedom of the\nwill” even in their dreams Our present-day Europe, the scene of a\nsenseless, precipitate attempt at a radical blending of classes,\nand CONSEQUENTLY of races, is therefore skeptical in all its\nheights and depths, sometimes exhibiting the mobile skepticism\nwhich springs impatiently and wantonly from branch to branch,\nsometimes with gloomy aspect, like a cloud over-charged with\ninterrogative signs—and often sick unto death of its will!\nParalysis of will, where do we not find this cripple sitting\nnowadays! And yet how bedecked oftentimes’ How seductively\nornamented! There are the finest gala dresses and disguises for\nthis disease, and that, for instance, most of what places itself\nnowadays in the show-cases as “objectiveness,” “the scientific\nspirit,” “L’ART POUR L’ART,” and “pure voluntary knowledge,” is\nonly decked-out skepticism and paralysis of will—I am ready to\nanswer for this diagnosis of the European disease—The disease of\nthe will is diffused unequally over Europe, it is worst and most\nvaried where civilization has longest prevailed, it decreases\naccording as “the barbarian” still—or again—asserts his claims\nunder the loose drapery of Western culture It is therefore in the\nFrance of today, as can be readily disclosed and comprehended,\nthat the will is most infirm, and France, which has always had a\nmasterly aptitude for converting even the portentous crises of\nits spirit into something charming and seductive, now manifests\nemphatically its intellectual ascendancy over Europe, by being\nthe school and exhibition of all the charms of skepticism The\npower to will and to persist, moreover, in a resolution, is\nalready somewhat stronger in Germany, and again in the North of\nGermany it is stronger than in Central Germany, it is\nconsiderably stronger in England, Spain, and Corsica, associated\nwith phlegm in the former and with hard skulls in the latter—not\nto mention Italy, which is too young yet to know what it wants,\nand must first show whether it can exercise will, but it is\nstrongest and most surprising of all in that immense middle\nempire where Europe as it were flows back to Asia—namely, in\nRussia There the power to will has been long stored up and\naccumulated, there the will—uncertain whether to be negative or\naffirmative—waits threateningly to be discharged (to borrow\ntheir pet phrase from our physicists) Perhaps not only Indian\nwars and complications in Asia would be necessary to free Europe\nfrom its greatest danger, but also internal subversion, the\nshattering of the empire into small states, and above all the\nintroduction of parliamentary imbecility, together with the\nobligation of every one to read his newspaper at breakfast I do\nnot say this as one who desires it, in my heart I should rather\nprefer the contrary—I mean such an increase in the threatening\nattitude of Russia, that Europe would have to make up its mind to\nbecome equally threatening—namely, TO ACQUIRE ONE WILL, by means\nof a new caste to rule over the Continent, a persistent, dreadful\nwill of its own, that can set its aims thousands of years ahead;\nso that the long spun-out comedy of its petty-statism, and its\ndynastic as well as its democratic many-willed-ness, might\nfinally be brought to a close. The time for petty politics is\npast; the next century will bring the struggle for the dominion\nof the world—the COMPULSION to great politics.\n209. As to how far the new warlike age on which we Europeans have\nevidently entered may perhaps favour the growth of another and\nstronger kind of skepticism, I should like to express myself\npreliminarily merely by a parable, which the lovers of German\nhistory will already understand. That unscrupulous enthusiast for\nbig, handsome grenadiers (who, as King of Prussia, brought into\nbeing a military and skeptical genius—and therewith, in reality,\nthe new and now triumphantly emerged type of German), the\nproblematic, crazy father of Frederick the Great, had on one\npoint the very knack and lucky grasp of the genius: he knew what\nwas then lacking in Germany, the want of which was a hundred\ntimes more alarming and serious than any lack of culture and\nsocial form—his ill-will to the young Frederick resulted from\nthe anxiety of a profound instinct. MEN WERE LACKING; and he\nsuspected, to his bitterest regret, that his own son was not man\nenough. There, however, he deceived himself; but who would not\nhave deceived himself in his place? He saw his son lapsed to\natheism, to the ESPRIT, to the pleasant frivolity of clever\nFrenchmen—he saw in the background the great bloodsucker, the\nspider skepticism; he suspected the incurable wretchedness of a\nheart no longer hard enough either for evil or good, and of a\nbroken will that no longer commands, is no longer ABLE to\ncommand. Meanwhile, however, there grew up in his son that new\nkind of harder and more dangerous skepticism—who knows TO WHAT\nEXTENT it was encouraged just by his father’s hatred and the icy\nmelancholy of a will condemned to solitude?—the skepticism of\ndaring manliness, which is closely related to the genius for war\nand conquest, and made its first entrance into Germany in the\nperson of the great Frederick. This skepticism despises and\nnevertheless grasps; it undermines and takes possession; it does\nnot believe, but it does not thereby lose itself; it gives the\nspirit a dangerous liberty, but it keeps strict guard over the\nheart. It is the GERMAN form of skepticism, which, as a continued\nFredericianism, risen to the highest spirituality, has kept\nEurope for a considerable time under the dominion of the German\nspirit and its critical and historical distrust Owing to the\ninsuperably strong and tough masculine character of the great\nGerman philologists and historical critics (who, rightly\nestimated, were also all of them artists of destruction and\ndissolution), a NEW conception of the German spirit gradually\nestablished itself—in spite of all Romanticism in music and\nphilosophy—in which the leaning towards masculine skepticism was\ndecidedly prominent whether, for instance, as fearlessness of\ngaze, as courage and sternness of the dissecting hand, or as\nresolute will to dangerous voyages of discovery, to spiritualized\nNorth Pole expeditions under barren and dangerous skies. There\nmay be good grounds for it when warm-blooded and superficial\nhumanitarians cross themselves before this spirit, CET ESPRIT\nFATALISTE, IRONIQUE, MEPHISTOPHELIQUE, as Michelet calls it, not\nwithout a shudder. But if one would realize how characteristic is\nthis fear of the “man” in the German spirit which awakened Europe\nout of its “dogmatic slumber,” let us call to mind the former\nconception which had to be overcome by this new one—and that it\nis not so very long ago that a masculinized woman could dare,\nwith unbridled presumption, to recommend the Germans to the\ninterest of Europe as gentle, goodhearted, weak-willed, and\npoetical fools. Finally, let us only understand profoundly enough\nNapoleon’s astonishment when he saw Goethe it reveals what had\nbeen regarded for centuries as the “German spirit” “VOILA UN\nHOMME!\"—that was as much as to say “But this is a MAN! And I\nonly expected to see a German!”\nSupposing, then, that in the picture of the philosophers of the\nfuture, some trait suggests the question whether they must not\nperhaps be skeptics in the last-mentioned sense, something in\nthem would only be designated thereby—and not they themselves.\nWith equal right they might call themselves critics, and\nassuredly they will be men of experiments. By the name with which\nI ventured to baptize them, I have already expressly emphasized\ntheir attempting and their love of attempting is this because, as\ncritics in body and soul, they will love to make use of\nexperiments in a new, and perhaps wider and more dangerous sense?\nIn their passion for knowledge, will they have to go further in\ndaring and painful attempts than the sensitive and pampered taste\nof a democratic century can approve of?—There is no doubt these\ncoming ones will be least able to dispense with the serious and\nnot unscrupulous qualities which distinguish the critic from the\nskeptic I mean the certainty as to standards of worth, the\nconscious employment of a unity of method, the wary courage, the\nstanding-alone, and the capacity for self-responsibility, indeed,\nthey will avow among themselves a DELIGHT in denial and\ndissection, and a certain considerate cruelty, which knows how to\nhandle the knife surely and deftly, even when the heart bleeds\nThey will be STERNER (and perhaps not always towards themselves\nonly) than humane people may desire, they will not deal with the\n\"truth” in order that it may “please” them, or “elevate” and\n\"inspire” them—they will rather have little faith in “TRUTH\"\nbringing with it such revels for the feelings. They will smile,\nthose rigourous spirits, when any one says in their presence\n\"That thought elevates me, why should it not be true?” or “That\nwork enchants me, why should it not be beautiful?” or “That\nartist enlarges me, why should he not be great?” Perhaps they\nwill not only have a smile, but a genuine disgust for all that is\nthus rapturous, idealistic, feminine, and hermaphroditic, and if\nany one could look into their inmost hearts, he would not easily\nfind therein the intention to reconcile “Christian sentiments\"\nwith “antique taste,” or even with “modern parliamentarism” (the\nkind of reconciliation necessarily found even among philosophers\nin our very uncertain and consequently very conciliatory\ncentury). Critical discipline, and every habit that conduces to\npurity and rigour in intellectual matters, will not only be\ndemanded from themselves by these philosophers of the future,\nthey may even make a display thereof as their special adornment—\nnevertheless they will not want to be called critics on that\naccount. It will seem to them no small indignity to philosophy to\nhave it decreed, as is so welcome nowadays, that “philosophy\nitself is criticism and critical science—and nothing else\nwhatever!” Though this estimate of philosophy may enjoy the\napproval of all the Positivists of France and Germany (and\npossibly it even flattered the heart and taste of KANT: let us\ncall to mind the titles of his principal works), our new\nphilosophers will say, notwithstanding, that critics are\ninstruments of the philosopher, and just on that account, as\ninstruments, they are far from being philosophers themselves!\nEven the great Chinaman of Konigsberg was only a great critic.\n211. I insist upon it that people finally cease confounding\nphilosophical workers, and in general scientific men, with\nphilosophers—that precisely here one should strictly give “each\nhis own,” and not give those far too much, these far too little.\nIt may be necessary for the education of the real philosopher\nthat he himself should have once stood upon all those steps upon\nwhich his servants, the scientific workers of philosophy, remain\nstanding, and MUST remain standing he himself must perhaps have\nbeen critic, and dogmatist, and historian, and besides, poet, and\ncollector, and traveler, and riddle-reader, and moralist, and\nseer, and “free spirit,” and almost everything, in order to\ntraverse the whole range of human values and estimations, and\nthat he may BE ABLE with a variety of eyes and consciences to\nlook from a height to any distance, from a depth up to any\nheight, from a nook into any expanse. But all these are only\npreliminary conditions for his task; this task itself demands\nsomething else—it requires him TO CREATE VALUES. The\nphilosophical workers, after the excellent pattern of Kant and\nHegel, have to fix and formalize some great existing body of\nvaluations—that is to say, former DETERMINATIONS OF VALUE,\ncreations of value, which have become prevalent, and are for a\ntime called “truths\"—whether in the domain of the LOGICAL, the\nPOLITICAL (moral), or the ARTISTIC. It is for these investigators\nto make whatever has happened and been esteemed hitherto,\nconspicuous, conceivable, intelligible, and manageable, to\nshorten everything long, even “time” itself, and to SUBJUGATE the\nentire past: an immense and wonderful task, in the carrying out\nof which all refined pride, all tenacious will, can surely find\nsatisfaction. THE REAL PHILOSOPHERS, HOWEVER, ARE COMMANDERS AND\nLAW-GIVERS; they say: “Thus SHALL it be!” They determine first\nthe Whither and the Why of mankind, and thereby set aside the\nprevious labour of all philosophical workers, and all subjugators\nof the past—they grasp at the future with a creative hand, and\nwhatever is and was, becomes for them thereby a means, an\ninstrument, and a hammer. Their “knowing” is CREATING, their\ncreating is a law-giving, their will to truth is—WILL TO POWER.\n—Are there at present such philosophers? Have there ever been\nsuch philosophers? MUST there not be such philosophers some day?\n. . .\n212. It is always more obvious to me that the philosopher, as a\nman INDISPENSABLE for the morrow and the day after the morrow,\nhas ever found himself, and HAS BEEN OBLIGED to find himself, in\ncontradiction to the day in which he lives; his enemy has always\nbeen the ideal of his day. Hitherto all those extraordinary\nfurtherers of humanity whom one calls philosophers—who rarely\nregarded themselves as lovers of wisdom, but rather as\ndisagreeable fools and dangerous interrogators—have found their\nmission, their hard, involuntary, imperative mission (in the end,\nhowever, the greatness of their mission), in being the bad\nconscience of their age. In putting the vivisector’s knife to the\nbreast of the very VIRTUES OF THEIR AGE, they have betrayed their\nown secret; it has been for the sake of a NEW greatness of man, a\nnew untrodden path to his aggrandizement. They have always\ndisclosed how much hypocrisy, indolence, self-indulgence, and\nself-neglect, how much falsehood was concealed under the most\nvenerated types of contemporary morality, how much virtue was\nOUTLIVED, they have always said “We must remove hence to where\nYOU are least at home” In the face of a world of “modern ideas,\"\nwhich would like to confine every one in a corner, in a\n\"specialty,” a philosopher, if there could be philosophers\nnowadays, would be compelled to place the greatness of man, the\nconception of “greatness,” precisely in his comprehensiveness and\nmultifariousness, in his all-roundness, he would even determine\nworth and rank according to the amount and variety of that which\na man could bear and take upon himself, according to the EXTENT\nto which a man could stretch his responsibility Nowadays the\ntaste and virtue of the age weaken and attenuate the will,\nnothing is so adapted to the spirit of the age as weakness of\nwill consequently, in the ideal of the philosopher, strength of\nwill, sternness, and capacity for prolonged resolution, must\nspecially be included in the conception of “greatness”, with as\ngood a right as the opposite doctrine, with its ideal of a silly,\nrenouncing, humble, selfless humanity, was suited to an opposite\nage—such as the sixteenth century, which suffered from its\naccumulated energy of will, and from the wildest torrents and\nfloods of selfishness In the time of Socrates, among men only of\nworn-out instincts, old conservative Athenians who let themselves\ngo—\"for the sake of happiness,” as they said, for the sake of\npleasure, as their conduct indicated—and who had continually on\ntheir lips the old pompous words to which they had long forfeited\nthe right by the life they led, IRONY was perhaps necessary for\ngreatness of soul, the wicked Socratic assurance of the old\nphysician and plebeian, who cut ruthlessly into his own flesh, as\ninto the flesh and heart of the “noble,” with a look that said\nplainly enough “Do not dissemble before me! here—we are equal!\"\nAt present, on the contrary, when throughout Europe the herding-\nanimal alone attains to honours, and dispenses honours, when\n\"equality of right” can too readily be transformed into equality\nin wrong—I mean to say into general war against everything rare,\nstrange, and privileged, against the higher man, the higher soul,\nthe higher duty, the higher responsibility, the creative\nplenipotence and lordliness—at present it belongs to the\nconception of “greatness” to be noble, to wish to be apart, to be\ncapable of being different, to stand alone, to have to live by\npersonal initiative, and the philosopher will betray something of\nhis own ideal when he asserts “He shall be the greatest who can\nbe the most solitary, the most concealed, the most divergent, the\nman beyond good and evil, the master of his virtues, and of\nsuper-abundance of will; precisely this shall be called\nGREATNESS: as diversified as can be entire, as ample as can be\nfull.” And to ask once more the question: Is greatness POSSIBLE—\nnowadays?\n213. It is difficult to learn what a philosopher is, because it\ncannot be taught: one must “know” it by experience—or one should\nhave the pride NOT to know it. The fact that at present people\nall talk of things of which they CANNOT have any experience, is\ntrue more especially and unfortunately as concerns the\nphilosopher and philosophical matters:—the very few know them,\nare permitted to know them, and all popular ideas about them are\nfalse. Thus, for instance, the truly philosophical combination of\na bold, exuberant spirituality which runs at presto pace, and a\ndialectic rigour and necessity which makes no false step, is\nunknown to most thinkers and scholars from their own experience,\nand therefore, should any one speak of it in their presence, it\nis incredible to them. They conceive of every necessity as\ntroublesome, as a painful compulsory obedience and state of\nconstraint; thinking itself is regarded by them as something slow\nand hesitating, almost as a trouble, and often enough as “worthy\nof the SWEAT of the noble\"—but not at all as something easy and\ndivine, closely related to dancing and exuberance! “To think” and\nto take a matter “seriously,” “arduously\"—that is one and the\nsame thing to them; such only has been their “experience.\"—\nArtists have here perhaps a finer intuition; they who know only\ntoo well that precisely when they no longer do anything\n\"arbitrarily,” and everything of necessity, their feeling of\nfreedom, of subtlety, of power, of creatively fixing, disposing,\nand shaping, reaches its climax—in short, that necessity and\n\"freedom of will” are then the same thing with them. There is, in\nfine, a gradation of rank in psychical states, to which the\ngradation of rank in the problems corresponds; and the highest\nproblems repel ruthlessly every one who ventures too near them,\nwithout being predestined for their solution by the loftiness and\npower of his spirituality. Of what use is it for nimble, everyday\nintellects, or clumsy, honest mechanics and empiricists to press,\nin their plebeian ambition, close to such problems, and as it\nwere into this “holy of holies\"—as so often happens nowadays!\nBut coarse feet must never tread upon such carpets: this is\nprovided for in the primary law of things; the doors remain\nclosed to those intruders, though they may dash and break their\nheads thereon. People have always to be born to a high station,\nor, more definitely, they have to be BRED for it: a person has\nonly a right to philosophy—taking the word in its higher\nsignificance—in virtue of his descent; the ancestors, the\n\"blood,” decide here also. Many generations must have prepared\nthe way for the coming of the philosopher; each of his virtues\nmust have been separately acquired, nurtured, transmitted, and\nembodied; not only the bold, easy, delicate course and current of\nhis thoughts, but above all the readiness for great\nresponsibilities, the majesty of ruling glance and contemning\nlook, the feeling of separation from the multitude with their\nduties and virtues, the kindly patronage and defense of whatever\nis misunderstood and calumniated, be it God or devil, the delight\nand practice of supreme justice, the art of commanding, the\namplitude of will, the lingering eye which rarely admires, rarely\nlooks up, rarely loves. . . .\nChapter VII: Our Virtues\n\n214. OUR Virtues?—It is probable that we, too, have still our\nvirtues, althoughnaturally they are not those sincere and massive\nvirtues on account of which we hold our grandfathers in esteem\nand also at a little distance from us. We Europeans of the day\nafter tomorrow, we firstlings of the twentieth century—with all\nour dangerous curiosity, our multifariousness and art of\ndisguising, our mellow and seemingly sweetened cruelty in sense\nand spirit—we shall presumably, IF we must have virtues, have\nthose only which have come to agreement with our most secret and\nheartfelt inclinations, with our most ardent requirements: well,\nthen, let us look for them in our labyrinths!—where, as we know,\nso many things lose themselves, so many things get quite lost!\nAnd is there anything finer than to SEARCH for one’s own virtues?\nIs it not almost to BELIEVE in one’s own virtues? But this\n\"believing in one’s own virtues\"—is it not practically the same\nas what was formerly called one’s “good conscience,” that long,\nrespectable pigtail of an idea, which our grandfathers used to\nhang behind their heads, and often enough also behind their\nunderstandings? It seems, therefore, that however little we may\nimagine ourselves to be old-fashioned and grandfatherly\nrespectable in other respects, in one thing we are nevertheless\nthe worthy grandchildren of our grandfathers, we last Europeans\nwith good consciences: we also still wear their pigtail.—Ah! if\nyou only knew how soon, so very soon—it will be different!\n215. As in the stellar firmament there are sometimes two suns\nwhich determine the path of one planet, and in certain cases suns\nof different colours shine around a single planet, now with red\nlight, now with green, and then simultaneously illumine and flood\nit with motley colours: so we modern men, owing to the\ncomplicated mechanism of our “firmament,” are determined by\nDIFFERENT moralities; our actions shine alternately in different\ncolours, and are seldom unequivocal—and there are often cases,\nalso, in which our actions are MOTLEY-COLOURED.\n216. To love one’s enemies? I think that has been well learnt: it\ntakes place thousands of times at present on a large and small\nscale; indeed, at times the higher and sublimer thing takes\nplace:—we learn to DESPISE when we love, and precisely when we\nlove best; all of it, however, unconsciously, without noise,\nwithout ostentation, with the shame and secrecy of goodness,\nwhich forbids the utterance of the pompous word and the formula\nof virtue. Morality as attitude—is opposed to our taste\nnowadays. This is ALSO an advance, as it was an advance in our\nfathers that religion as an attitude finally became opposed to\ntheir taste, including the enmity and Voltairean bitterness\nagainst religion (and all that formerly belonged to freethinker-\npantomime). It is the music in our conscience, the dance in our\nspirit, to which Puritan litanies, moral sermons, and goody-\ngoodness won’t chime.\n217. Let us be careful in dealing with those who attach great\nimportance to being credited with moral tact and subtlety in\nmoral discernment! They never forgive us if they have once made a\nmistake BEFORE us (or even with REGARD to us)—they inevitably\nbecome our instinctive calumniators and detractors, even when\nthey still remain our “friends.\"—Blessed are the forgetful: for\nthey “get the better” even of their blunders.\n218. The psychologists of France—and where else are there still\npsychologists nowadays?—have never yet exhausted their bitter\nand manifold enjoyment of the betise bourgeoise, just as\nthough . . . in short, they betray something thereby. Flaubert,\nfor instance, the honest citizen of Rouen, neither saw, heard, nor\ntasted anything else in the end; it was his mode of self-torment\nand refined cruelty. As this is growing wearisome, I would now\nrecommend for a change something else for a pleasure—namely, the\nunconscious astuteness with which good, fat, honest mediocrity\nalways behaves towards loftier spirits and the tasks they have to\nperform, the subtle, barbed, Jesuitical astuteness, which is a\nthousand times subtler than the taste and understanding of the\nmiddle-class in its best moments—subtler even than the\nunderstanding of its victims:—a repeated proof that “instinct” is\nthe most intelligent of all kinds of intelligence which have\nhitherto been discovered. In short, you psychologists, study the\nphilosophy of the “rule” in its struggle with the “exception”:\nthere you have a spectacle fit for Gods and godlike malignity! Or,\nin plainer words, practise vivisection on “good people,” on the\n\"homo bonae voluntatis,” ON YOURSELVES!\n219. The practice of judging and condemning morally, is the\nfavourite revenge of the intellectually shallow on those who are\nless so, it is also a kind of indemnity for their being badly\nendowed by nature, and finally, it is an opportunity for\nacquiring spirit and BECOMING subtle—malice spiritualises. They\nare glad in their inmost heart that there is a standard according\nto which those who are over-endowed with intellectual goods and\nprivileges, are equal to them, they contend for the “equality of\nall before God,” and almost NEED the belief in God for this\npurpose. It is among them that the most powerful antagonists of\natheism are found. If any one were to say to them “A lofty\nspirituality is beyond all comparison with the honesty and\nrespectability of a merely moral man\"—it would make them\nfurious, I shall take care not to say so. I would rather flatter\nthem with my theory that lofty spirituality itself exists only as\nthe ultimate product of moral qualities, that it is a synthesis\nof all qualities attributed to the “merely moral” man, after they\nhave been acquired singly through long training and practice,\nperhaps during a whole series of generations, that lofty\nspirituality is precisely the spiritualising of justice, and the\nbeneficent severity which knows that it is authorized to maintain\nGRADATIONS OF RANK in the world, even among things—and not only\namong men.\n220. Now that the praise of the “disinterested person” is so\npopular one must—probably not without some danger—get an idea\nof WHAT people actually take an interest in, and what are the\nthings generally which fundamentally and profoundly concern\nordinary men—including the cultured, even the learned, and\nperhaps philosophers also, if appearances do not deceive. The\nfact thereby becomes obvious that the greater part of what\ninterests and charms higher natures, and more refined and\nfastidious tastes, seems absolutely “uninteresting” to the\naverage man—if, notwithstanding, he perceive devotion to these\ninterests, he calls it desinteresse, and wonders how it is\npossible to act “disinterestedly.” There have been philosophers\nwho could give this popular astonishment a seductive and\nmystical, other-worldly expression (perhaps because they did not\nknow the higher nature by experience?), instead of stating the\nnaked and candidly reasonable truth that “disinterested\" action\nis very interesting and “interested\" action, provided that. . .\n\"And love?\"—What! Even an action for love’s sake shall be\n\"unegoistic”? But you fools—! “And the praise of the self-\nsacrificer?\"—But whoever has really offered sacrifice knows that\nhe wanted and obtained something for it—perhaps something from\nhimself for something from himself; that he relinquished here in\norder to have more there, perhaps in general to be more, or even\nfeel himself “more.” But this is a realm of questions and answers\nin which a more fastidious spirit does not like to stay: for here\ntruth has to stifle her yawns so much when she is obliged to\nanswer. And after all, truth is a woman; one must not use force\nwith her.\n221. “It sometimes happens,” said a moralistic pedant and trifle-\nretailer, “that I honour and respect an unselfish man: not,\nhowever, because he is unselfish, but because I think he has a\nright to be useful to another man at his own expense. In short,\nthe question is always who HE is, and who THE OTHER is. For\ninstance, in a person created and destined for command, self-\ndenial and modest retirement, instead of being virtues, would be\nthe waste of virtues: so it seems to me. Every system of\nunegoistic morality which takes itself unconditionally and\nappeals to every one, not only sins against good taste, but is\nalso an incentive to sins of omission, an ADDITIONAL seduction\nunder the mask of philanthropy—and precisely a seduction and\ninjury to the higher, rarer, and more privileged types of men.\nMoral systems must be compelled first of all to bow before the\nGRADATIONS OF RANK; their presumption must be driven home to\ntheir conscience—until they thoroughly understand at last that\nit is IMMORAL to say that ’what is right for one is proper for\nanother.’\"—So said my moralistic pedant and bonhomme. Did he\nperhaps deserve to be laughed at when he thus exhorted systems of\nmorals to practise morality? But one should not be too much in\nthe right if one wishes to have the laughers on ONE’S OWN side; a\ngrain of wrong pertains even to good taste.\n222. Wherever sympathy (fellow-suffering) is preached nowadays—\nand, if I gather rightly, no other religion is any longer\npreached—let the psychologist have his ears open through all the\nvanity, through all the noise which is natural to these preachers\n(as to all preachers), he will hear a hoarse, groaning, genuine\nnote of SELF-CONTEMPT. It belongs to the overshadowing and\nuglifying of Europe, which has been on the increase for a century\n(the first symptoms of which are already specified documentarily\nin a thoughtful letter of Galiani to Madame d’Epinay)—IF IT IS\nNOT REALLY THE CAUSE THEREOF! The man of “modern ideas,” the\nconceited ape, is excessively dissatisfied with himself-this is\nperfectly certain. He suffers, and his vanity wants him only “to\nsuffer with his fellows.”\n223. The hybrid European—a tolerably ugly plebeian, taken all in\nall—absolutely requires a costume: he needs history as a\nstoreroom of costumes. To be sure, he notices that none of the\ncostumes fit him properly—he changes and changes. Let us look at\nthe nineteenth century with respect to these hasty preferences\nand changes in its masquerades of style, and also with respect to\nits moments of desperation on account of “nothing suiting” us. It\nis in vain to get ourselves up as romantic, or classical, or\nChristian, or Florentine, or barocco, or “national,” in moribus\net artibus: it does not “clothe us”! But the “spirit,” especially\nthe “historical spirit,” profits even by this desperation: once\nand again a new sample of the past or of the foreign is tested,\nput on, taken off, packed up, and above all studied—we are the\nfirst studious age in puncto of “costumes,” I mean as concerns\nmorals, articles of belief, artistic tastes, and religions; we\nare prepared as no other age has ever been for a carnival in the\ngrand style, for the most spiritual festival—laughter and\narrogance, for the transcendental height of supreme folly and\nAristophanic ridicule of the world. Perhaps we are still\ndiscovering the domain of our invention just here, the domain\nwhere even we can still be original, probably as parodists of the\nworld’s history and as God’s Merry-Andrews,—perhaps, though\nnothing else of the present have a future, our laughter itself\nmay have a future!\n224. The historical sense (or the capacity for divining quickly\nthe order of rank of the valuations according to which a people,\na community, or an individual has lived, the “divining instinct\"\nfor the relationships of these valuations, for the relation of\nthe authority of the valuations to the authority of the operating\nforces),—this historical sense, which we Europeans claim as our\nspecialty, has come to us in the train of the enchanting and mad\nsemi-barbarity into which Europe has been plunged by the\ndemocratic mingling of classes and races—it is only the\nnineteenth century that has recognized this faculty as its sixth\nsense. Owing to this mingling, the past of every form and mode of\nlife, and of cultures which were formerly closely contiguous and\nsuperimposed on one another, flows forth into us “modern souls\";\nour instincts now run back in all directions, we ourselves are a\nkind of chaos: in the end, as we have said, the spirit perceives\nits advantage therein. By means of our semi-barbarity in body and\nin desire, we have secret access everywhere, such as a noble age\nnever had; we have access above all to the labyrinth of imperfect\ncivilizations, and to every form of semi-barbarity that has at\nany time existed on earth; and in so far as the most considerable\npart of human civilization hitherto has just been semi-barbarity,\nthe “historical sense” implies almost the sense and instinct for\neverything, the taste and tongue for everything: whereby it\nimmediately proves itself to be an IGNOBLE sense. For instance,\nwe enjoy Homer once more: it is perhaps our happiest acquisition\nthat we know how to appreciate Homer, whom men of distinguished\nculture (as the French of the seventeenth century, like Saint-\nEvremond, who reproached him for his ESPRIT VASTE, and even\nVoltaire, the last echo of the century) cannot and could not so\neasily appropriate—whom they scarcely permitted themselves to\nenjoy. The very decided Yea and Nay of their palate, their\npromptly ready disgust, their hesitating reluctance with regard\nto everything strange, their horror of the bad taste even of\nlively curiosity, and in general the averseness of every\ndistinguished and self-sufficing culture to avow a new desire, a\ndissatisfaction with its own condition, or an admiration of what\nis strange: all this determines and disposes them unfavourably\neven towards the best things of the world which are not their\nproperty or could not become their prey—and no faculty is more\nunintelligible to such men than just this historical sense, with\nits truckling, plebeian curiosity. The case is not different with\nShakespeare, that marvelous Spanish-Moorish-Saxon synthesis of\ntaste, over whom an ancient Athenian of the circle of Eschylus\nwould have half-killed himself with laughter or irritation: but\nwe—accept precisely this wild motleyness, this medley of the\nmost delicate, the most coarse, and the most artificial, with a\nsecret confidence and cordiality; we enjoy it as a refinement of\nart reserved expressly for us, and allow ourselves to be as\nlittle disturbed by the repulsive fumes and the proximity of the\nEnglish populace in which Shakespeare’s art and taste lives, as\nperhaps on the Chiaja of Naples, where, with all our senses\nawake, we go our way, enchanted and voluntarily, in spite of the\ndrain-odour of the lower quarters of the town. That as men of the\n\"historical sense” we have our virtues, is not to be disputed:—\nwe are unpretentious, unselfish, modest, brave, habituated to\nself-control and self-renunciation, very grateful, very patient,\nvery complaisant—but with all this we are perhaps not very\n\"tasteful.” Let us finally confess it, that what is most\ndifficult for us men of the “historical sense” to grasp, feel,\ntaste, and love, what finds us fundamentally prejudiced and\nalmost hostile, is precisely the perfection and ultimate maturity\nin every culture and art, the essentially noble in works and men,\ntheir moment of smooth sea and halcyon self-sufficiency, the\ngoldenness and coldness which all things show that have perfected\nthemselves. Perhaps our great virtue of the historical sense is\nin necessary contrast to GOOD taste, at least to the very bad\ntaste; and we can only evoke in ourselves imperfectly,\nhesitatingly, and with compulsion the small, short, and happy\ngodsends and glorifications of human life as they shine here and\nthere: those moments and marvelous experiences when a great power\nhas voluntarily come to a halt before the boundless and\ninfinite,—when a super-abundance of refined delight has been\nenjoyed by a sudden checking and petrifying, by standing firmly\nand planting oneself fixedly on still trembling ground.\nPROPORTIONATENESS is strange to us, let us confess it to\nourselves; our itching is really the itching for the infinite,\nthe immeasurable. Like the rider on his forward panting horse, we\nlet the reins fall before the infinite, we modern men, we semi-\nbarbarians—and are only in OUR highest bliss when we—ARE IN\nMOST DANGER.\n225. Whether it be hedonism, pessimism, utilitarianism, or\neudaemonism, all those modes of thinking which measure the worth\nof things according to PLEASURE and PAIN, that is, according to\naccompanying circumstances and secondary considerations, are\nplausible modes of thought and naivetes, which every one\nconscious of CREATIVE powers and an artist’s conscience will look\ndown upon with scorn, though not without sympathy. Sympathy for\nyou!—to be sure, that is not sympathy as you understand it: it\nis not sympathy for social “distress,” for “society” with its\nsick and misfortuned, for the hereditarily vicious and defective\nwho lie on the ground around us; still less is it sympathy for\nthe grumbling, vexed, revolutionary slave-classes who strive\nafter power—they call it “freedom.” OUR sympathy is a loftier\nand further-sighted sympathy:—we see how MAN dwarfs himself, how\nYOU dwarf him! and there are moments when we view YOUR sympathy\nwith an indescribable anguish, when we resist it,—when we regard\nyour seriousness as more dangerous than any kind of levity. You\nwant, if possible—and there is not a more foolish “if possible\"\n—TO DO AWAY WITH SUFFERING; and we?—it really seems that WE\nwould rather have it increased and made worse than it has ever\nbeen! Well-being, as you understand it—is certainly not a goal;\nit seems to us an END; a condition which at once renders man\nludicrous and contemptible—and makes his destruction DESIRABLE!\nThe discipline of suffering, of GREAT suffering—know ye not that\nit is only THIS discipline that has produced all the elevations\nof humanity hitherto? The tension of soul in misfortune which\ncommunicates to it its energy, its shuddering in view of rack and\nruin, its inventiveness and bravery in undergoing, enduring,\ninterpreting, and exploiting misfortune, and whatever depth,\nmystery, disguise, spirit, artifice, or greatness has been\nbestowed upon the soul—has it not been bestowed through\nsuffering, through the discipline of great suffering? In man\nCREATURE and CREATOR are united: in man there is not only matter,\nshred, excess, clay, mire, folly, chaos; but there is also the\ncreator, the sculptor, the hardness of the hammer, the divinity\nof the spectator, and the seventh day—do ye understand this\ncontrast? And that YOUR sympathy for the “creature in man\"\napplies to that which has to be fashioned, bruised, forged,\nstretched, roasted, annealed, refined—to that which must\nnecessarily SUFFER, and IS MEANT to suffer? And our sympathy—do\nye not understand what our REVERSE sympathy applies to, when it\nresists your sympathy as the worst of all pampering and\nenervation?—So it is sympathy AGAINST sympathy!—But to repeat\nit once more, there are higher problems than the problems of\npleasure and pain and sympathy; and all systems of philosophy\nwhich deal only with these are naivetes.\n226. WE IMMORALISTS.-This world with which WE are concerned, in\nwhich we have to fear and love, this almost invisible, inaudible\nworld of delicate command and delicate obedience, a world of\n\"almost” in every respect, captious, insidious, sharp, and\ntender—yes, it is well protected from clumsy spectators and\nfamiliar curiosity! We are woven into a strong net and garment of\nduties, and CANNOT disengage ourselves—precisely here, we are\n\"men of duty,” even we! Occasionally, it is true, we dance in our\n\"chains” and betwixt our “swords\"; it is none the less true that\nmore often we gnash our teeth under the circumstances, and are\nimpatient at the secret hardship of our lot. But do what we will,\nfools and appearances say of us: “These are men WITHOUT duty,\"—\nwe have always fools and appearances against us!\n227. Honesty, granting that it is the virtue of which we cannot\nrid ourselves, we free spirits—well, we will labour at it with\nall our perversity and love, and not tire of “perfecting\"\nourselves in OUR virtue, which alone remains: may its glance some\nday overspread like a gilded, blue, mocking twilight this aging\ncivilization with its dull gloomy seriousness! And if,\nnevertheless, our honesty should one day grow weary, and sigh,\nand stretch its limbs, and find us too hard, and would fain have\nit pleasanter, easier, and gentler, like an agreeable vice, let\nus remain HARD, we latest Stoics, and let us send to its help\nwhatever devilry we have in us:—our disgust at the clumsy and\nundefined, our “NITIMUR IN VETITUM,” our love of adventure, our\nsharpened and fastidious curiosity, our most subtle, disguised,\nintellectual Will to Power and universal conquest, which rambles\nand roves avidiously around all the realms of the future—let us\ngo with all our “devils” to the help of our “God”! It is probable\nthat people will misunderstand and mistake us on that account:\nwhat does it matter! They will say: “Their ’honesty’—that is\ntheir devilry, and nothing else!” What does it matter! And even\nif they were right—have not all Gods hitherto been such\nsanctified, re-baptized devils? And after all, what do we know of\nourselves? And what the spirit that leads us wants TO BE CALLED?\n(It is a question of names.) And how many spirits we harbour? Our\nhonesty, we free spirits—let us be careful lest it become our\nvanity, our ornament and ostentation, our limitation, our\nstupidity! Every virtue inclines to stupidity, every stupidity to\nvirtue; “stupid to the point of sanctity,” they say in Russia,—\nlet us be careful lest out of pure honesty we eventually become\nsaints and bores! Is not life a hundred times too short for us—\nto bore ourselves? One would have to believe in eternal life in\norder to . . . \n228. I hope to be forgiven for discovering that all moral\nphilosophy hitherto has been tedious and has belonged to the\nsoporific appliances—and that “virtue,” in my opinion, has been\nMORE injured by the TEDIOUSNESS of its advocates than by anything\nelse; at the same time, however, I would not wish to overlook\ntheir general usefulness. It is desirable that as few people as\npossible should reflect upon morals, and consequently it is very\ndesirable that morals should not some day become interesting! But\nlet us not be afraid! Things still remain today as they have\nalways been: I see no one in Europe who has (or DISCLOSES) an\nidea of the fact that philosophizing concerning morals might be\nconducted in a dangerous, captious, and ensnaring manner—that\nCALAMITY might be involved therein. Observe, for example, the\nindefatigable, inevitable English utilitarians: how ponderously\nand respectably they stalk on, stalk along (a Homeric metaphor\nexpresses it better) in the footsteps of Bentham, just as he had\nalready stalked in the footsteps of the respectable Helvetius!\n(no, he was not a dangerous man, Helvetius, CE SENATEUR\nPOCOCURANTE, to use an expression of Galiani). No new thought,\nnothing of the nature of a finer turning or better expression of\nan old thought, not even a proper history of what has been\npreviously thought on the subject: an IMPOSSIBLE literature,\ntaking it all in all, unless one knows how to leaven it with some\nmischief. In effect, the old English vice called CANT, which is\nMORAL TARTUFFISM, has insinuated itself also into these moralists\n(whom one must certainly read with an eye to their motives if one\nMUST read them), concealed this time under the new form of the\nscientific spirit; moreover, there is not absent from them a\nsecret struggle with the pangs of conscience, from which a race\nof former Puritans must naturally suffer, in all their scientific\ntinkering with morals. (Is not a moralist the opposite of a\nPuritan? That is to say, as a thinker who regards morality as\nquestionable, as worthy of interrogation, in short, as a problem?\nIs moralizing not-immoral?) In the end, they all want English\nmorality to be recognized as authoritative, inasmuch as mankind,\nor the “general utility,” or “the happiness of the greatest\nnumber,\"—no! the happiness of ENGLAND, will be best served\nthereby. They would like, by all means, to convince themselves\nthat the striving after English happiness, I mean after COMFORT\nand FASHION (and in the highest instance, a seat in Parliament),\nis at the same time the true path of virtue; in fact, that in so\nfar as there has been virtue in the world hitherto, it has just\nconsisted in such striving. Not one of those ponderous,\nconscience-stricken herding-animals (who undertake to advocate\nthe cause of egoism as conducive to the general welfare) wants to\nhave any knowledge or inkling of the facts that the “general\nwelfare” is no ideal, no goal, no notion that can be at all\ngrasped, but is only a nostrum,—that what is fair to one MAY NOT\nat all be fair to another, that the requirement of one morality\nfor all is really a detriment to higher men, in short, that there\nis a DISTINCTION OF RANK between man and man, and consequently\nbetween morality and morality. They are an unassuming and\nfundamentally mediocre species of men, these utilitarian\nEnglishmen, and, as already remarked, in so far as they are\ntedious, one cannot think highly enough of their utility. One\nought even to ENCOURAGE them, as has been partially attempted in\nthe following rhymes:—\n    Hail, ye worthies, barrow-wheeling, \n    “Longer—better,” aye revealing,\n\n    Stiffer aye in head and knee; \n    Unenraptured, never jesting,\n    Mediocre everlasting,\n\nSANS GENIE ET SANS ESPRIT!\n229. In these later ages, which may be proud of their humanity,\nthere still remains so much fear, so much SUPERSTITION of the\nfear, of the “cruel wild beast,” the mastering of which\nconstitutes the very pride of these humaner ages—that even\nobvious truths, as if by the agreement of centuries, have long\nremained unuttered, because they have the appearance of helping\nthe finally slain wild beast back to life again. I perhaps risk\nsomething when I allow such a truth to escape; let others capture\nit again and give it so much “milk of pious sentiment\"\n[FOOTNOTE: An expression from Schiller’s William Tell, Act IV,\nScene 3.] to drink, that it will lie down quiet and forgotten, in\nits old corner.—One ought to learn anew about cruelty, and open\none’s eyes; one ought at last to learn impatience, in order that\nsuch immodest gross errors—as, for instance, have been fostered\nby ancient and modern philosophers with regard to tragedy—may no\nlonger wander about virtuously and boldly. Almost everything that\nwe call “higher culture” is based upon the spiritualising and\nintensifying of CRUELTY—this is my thesis; the “wild beast” has\nnot been slain at all, it lives, it flourishes, it has only been—\ntransfigured. That which constitutes the painful delight of\ntragedy is cruelty; that which operates agreeably in so-called\ntragic sympathy, and at the basis even of everything sublime, up\nto the highest and most delicate thrills of metaphysics, obtains\nits sweetness solely from the intermingled ingredient of cruelty.\nWhat the Roman enjoys in the arena, the Christian in the\necstasies of the cross, the Spaniard at the sight of the faggot\nand stake, or of the bull-fight, the present-day Japanese who\npresses his way to the tragedy, the workman of the Parisian\nsuburbs who has a homesickness for bloody revolutions, the\nWagnerienne who, with unhinged will, “undergoes” the performance\nof “Tristan and Isolde\"—what all these enjoy, and strive with\nmysterious ardour to drink in, is the philtre of the great Circe\n\"cruelty.” Here, to be sure, we must put aside entirely the\nblundering psychology of former times, which could only teach\nwith regard to cruelty that it originated at the sight of the\nsuffering of OTHERS: there is an abundant, super-abundant\nenjoyment even in one’s own suffering, in causing one’s own\nsuffering—and wherever man has allowed himself to be persuaded\nto self-denial in the RELIGIOUS sense, or to self-mutilation, as\namong the Phoenicians and ascetics, or in general, to\ndesensualisation, decarnalisation, and contrition, to Puritanical\nrepentance-spasms, to vivisection of conscience and to Pascal-\nlike SACRIFIZIA DELL’ INTELLETO, he is secretly allured and\nimpelled forwards by his cruelty, by the dangerous thrill of\ncruelty TOWARDS HIMSELF.—Finally, let us consider that even the\nseeker of knowledge operates as an artist and glorifier of\ncruelty, in that he compels his spirit to perceive AGAINST its\nown inclination, and often enough against the wishes of his\nheart:—he forces it to say Nay, where he would like to affirm,\nlove, and adore; indeed, every instance of taking a thing\nprofoundly and fundamentally, is a violation, an intentional\ninjuring of the fundamental will of the spirit, which\ninstinctively aims at appearance and superficiality,—even in\nevery desire for knowledge there is a drop of cruelty.\n230. Perhaps what I have said here about a “fundamental will of\nthe spirit” may not be understood without further details; I may\nbe allowed a word of explanation.—That imperious something which\nis popularly called “the spirit,” wishes to be master internally\nand externally, and to feel itself master; it has the will of a\nmultiplicity for a simplicity, a binding, taming, imperious, and\nessentially ruling will. Its requirements and capacities here,\nare the same as those assigned by physiologists to everything\nthat lives, grows, and multiplies. The power of the spirit to\nappropriate foreign elements reveals itself in a strong tendency\nto assimilate the new to the old, to simplify the manifold, to\noverlook or repudiate the absolutely contradictory; just as it\narbitrarily re-underlines, makes prominent, and falsifies for\nitself certain traits and lines in the foreign elements, in every\nportion of the “outside world.” Its object thereby is the\nincorporation of new “experiences,” the assortment of new things\nin the old arrangements—in short, growth; or more properly, the\nFEELING of growth, the feeling of increased power—is its object.\nThis same will has at its service an apparently opposed impulse\nof the spirit, a suddenly adopted preference of ignorance, of\narbitrary shutting out, a closing of windows, an inner denial of\nthis or that, a prohibition to approach, a sort of defensive\nattitude against much that is knowable, a contentment with\nobscurity, with the shutting-in horizon, an acceptance and\napproval of ignorance: as that which is all necessary according\nto the degree of its appropriating power, its “digestive power,\"\nto speak figuratively (and in fact “the spirit” resembles a\nstomach more than anything else). Here also belong an occasional\npropensity of the spirit to let itself be deceived (perhaps with\na waggish suspicion that it is NOT so and so, but is only allowed\nto pass as such), a delight in uncertainty and ambiguity, an\nexulting enjoyment of arbitrary, out-of-the-way narrowness and\nmystery, of the too-near, of the foreground, of the magnified,\nthe diminished, the misshapen, the beautified—an enjoyment of\nthe arbitrariness of all these manifestations of power. Finally,\nin this connection, there is the not unscrupulous readiness of\nthe spirit to deceive other spirits and dissemble before them—\nthe constant pressing and straining of a creating, shaping,\nchangeable power: the spirit enjoys therein its craftiness and\nits variety of disguises, it enjoys also its feeling of security\ntherein—it is precisely by its Protean arts that it is best\nprotected and concealed!—COUNTER TO this propensity for\nappearance, for simplification, for a disguise, for a cloak, in\nshort, for an outside—for every outside is a cloak—there\noperates the sublime tendency of the man of knowledge, which\ntakes, and INSISTS on taking things profoundly, variously, and\nthoroughly; as a kind of cruelty of the intellectual conscience\nand taste, which every courageous thinker will acknowledge in\nhimself, provided, as it ought to be, that he has sharpened and\nhardened his eye sufficiently long for introspection, and is\naccustomed to severe discipline and even severe words. He will\nsay: “There is something cruel in the tendency of my spirit”: let\nthe virtuous and amiable try to convince him that it is not so!\nIn fact, it would sound nicer, if, instead of our cruelty,\nperhaps our “extravagant honesty” were talked about, whispered\nabout, and glorified—we free, VERY free spirits—and some day\nperhaps SUCH will actually be our—posthumous glory! Meanwhile—\nfor there is plenty of time until then—we should be least\ninclined to deck ourselves out in such florid and fringed moral\nverbiage; our whole former work has just made us sick of this\ntaste and its sprightly exuberance. They are beautiful,\nglistening, jingling, festive words: honesty, love of truth, love\nof wisdom, sacrifice for knowledge, heroism of the truthful—\nthere is something in them that makes one’s heart swell with\npride. But we anchorites and marmots have long ago persuaded\nourselves in all the secrecy of an anchorite’s conscience, that\nthis worthy parade of verbiage also belongs to the old false\nadornment, frippery, and gold-dust of unconscious human vanity,\nand that even under such flattering colour and repainting, the\nterrible original text HOMO NATURA must again be recognized. In\neffect, to translate man back again into nature; to master the\nmany vain and visionary interpretations and subordinate meanings\nwhich have hitherto been scratched and daubed over the eternal\noriginal text, HOMO NATURA; to bring it about that man shall\nhenceforth stand before man as he now, hardened by the discipline\nof science, stands before the OTHER forms of nature, with\nfearless Oedipus-eyes, and stopped Ulysses-ears, deaf to the\nenticements of old metaphysical bird-catchers, who have piped to\nhim far too long: “Thou art more! thou art higher! thou hast a\ndifferent origin!\"—this may be a strange and foolish task, but\nthat it is a TASK, who can deny! Why did we choose it, this\nfoolish task? Or, to put the question differently: “Why knowledge\nat all?” Every one will ask us about this. And thus pressed, we,\nwho have asked ourselves the question a hundred times, have not\nfound and cannot find any better answer. . . .\n231. Learning alters us, it does what all nourishment does that\ndoes not merely “conserve\"—as the physiologist knows. But at the\nbottom of our souls, quite “down below,” there is certainly\nsomething unteachable, a granite of spiritual fate, of\npredetermined decision and answer to predetermined, chosen\nquestions. In each cardinal problem there speaks an unchangeable\n\"I am this\"; a thinker cannot learn anew about man and woman, for\ninstance, but can only learn fully—he can only follow to the end\nwhat is “fixed” about them in himself. Occasionally we find\ncertain solutions of problems which make strong beliefs for us;\nperhaps they are henceforth called “convictions.” Later on—one\nsees in them only footsteps to self-knowledge, guide-posts to the\nproblem which we ourselves ARE—or more correctly to the great\nstupidity which we embody, our spiritual fate, the UNTEACHABLE in\nus, quite “down below.\"—In view of this liberal compliment which\nI have just paid myself, permission will perhaps be more readily\nallowed me to utter some truths about “woman as she is,” provided\nthat it is known at the outset how literally they are merely—MY\ntruths.\n232. Woman wishes to be independent, and therefore she begins to\nenlighten men about “woman as she is\"—THIS is one of the worst\ndevelopments of the general UGLIFYING of Europe. For what must\nthese clumsy attempts of feminine scientificality and self-\nexposure bring to light! Woman has so much cause for shame; in\nwoman there is so much pedantry, superficiality,\nschoolmasterliness, petty presumption, unbridledness, and\nindiscretion concealed—study only woman’s behaviour towards\nchildren!—which has really been best restrained and dominated\nhitherto by the FEAR of man. Alas, if ever the “eternally tedious\nin woman\"—she has plenty of it!—is allowed to venture forth! if\nshe begins radically and on principle to unlearn her wisdom and\nart-of charming, of playing, of frightening away sorrow, of\nalleviating and taking easily; if she forgets her delicate\naptitude for agreeable desires! Female voices are already raised,\nwhich, by Saint Aristophanes! make one afraid:—with medical\nexplicitness it is stated in a threatening manner what woman\nfirst and last REQUIRES from man. Is it not in the very worst\ntaste that woman thus sets herself up to be scientific?\nEnlightenment hitherto has fortunately been men’s affair, men’s\ngift-we remained therewith “among ourselves\"; and in the end, in\nview of all that women write about “woman,” we may well have\nconsiderable doubt as to whether woman really DESIRES\nenlightenment about herself—and CAN desire it. If woman does not\nthereby seek a new ORNAMENT for herself—I believe ornamentation\nbelongs to the eternally feminine?—why, then, she wishes to make\nherself feared: perhaps she thereby wishes to get the mastery.\nBut she does not want truth—what does woman care for truth? From\nthe very first, nothing is more foreign, more repugnant, or more\nhostile to woman than truth—her great art is falsehood, her\nchief concern is appearance and beauty. Let us confess it, we\nmen: we honour and love this very art and this very instinct in\nwoman: we who have the hard task, and for our recreation gladly\nseek the company of beings under whose hands, glances, and\ndelicate follies, our seriousness, our gravity, and profundity\nappear almost like follies to us. Finally, I ask the question:\nDid a woman herself ever acknowledge profundity in a woman’s\nmind, or justice in a woman’s heart? And is it not true that on\nthe whole “woman” has hitherto been most despised by woman\nherself, and not at all by us?—We men desire that woman should\nnot continue to compromise herself by enlightening us; just as it\nwas man’s care and the consideration for woman, when the church\ndecreed: mulier taceat in ecclesia. It was to the benefit of\nwoman when Napoleon gave the too eloquent Madame de Stael to\nunderstand: mulier taceat in politicis!—and in my opinion, he is\na true friend of woman who calls out to women today: mulier\ntaceat de mulierel.\n233. It betrays corruption of the instincts—apart from the fact\nthat it betrays bad taste—when a woman refers to Madame Roland,\nor Madame de Stael, or Monsieur George Sand, as though something\nwere proved thereby in favour of “woman as she is.” Among men,\nthese are the three comical women as they are—nothing more!—and\njust the best involuntary counter-arguments against feminine\nemancipation and autonomy.\n234. Stupidity in the kitchen; woman as cook; the terrible\nthoughtlessness with which the feeding of the family and the\nmaster of the house is managed! Woman does not understand what\nfood means, and she insists on being cook! If woman had been a\nthinking creature, she should certainly, as cook for thousands of\nyears, have discovered the most important physiological facts,\nand should likewise have got possession of the healing art!\nThrough bad female cooks—through the entire lack of reason in\nthe kitchen—the development of mankind has been longest retarded\nand most interfered with: even today matters are very little\nbetter. A word to High School girls.\n235. There are turns and casts of fancy, there are sentences,\nlittle handfuls of words, in which a whole culture, a whole\nsociety suddenly crystallises itself. Among these is the\nincidental remark of Madame de Lambert to her son: “MON AMI, NE\nVOUS PERMETTEZ JAMAIS QUE DES FOLIES, QUI VOUS FERONT GRAND\nPLAISIR\"—the motherliest and wisest remark, by the way, that was\never addressed to a son.\n236. I have no doubt that every noble woman will oppose what\nDante and Goethe believed about woman—the former when he sang,\n\"ELLA GUARDAVA SUSO, ED IO IN LEI,” and the latter when he\ninterpreted it, “the eternally feminine draws us ALOFT\"; for THIS\nis just what she believes of the eternally masculine.\n237.\nSEVEN APOPHTHEGMS FOR WOMEN\nHow the longest ennui flees, When a man comes to our knees!\nAge, alas! and science staid, Furnish even weak virtue aid.\nSombre garb and silence meet: Dress for every dame—discreet.\nWhom I thank when in my bliss? God!—and my good tailoress!\nYoung, a flower-decked cavern home; Old, a dragon thence doth\nroam.\nNoble title, leg that’s fine, Man as well: Oh, were HE mine!\nSpeech in brief and sense in mass—Slippery for the jenny-ass!\n237A. Woman has hitherto been treated by men like birds, which,\nlosing their way, have come down among them from an elevation: as\nsomething delicate, fragile, wild, strange, sweet, and animating-\n-but as something also which must be cooped up to prevent it\nflying away.\n238. To be mistaken in the fundamental problem of “man and\nwoman,” to deny here the profoundest antagonism and the necessity\nfor an eternally hostile tension, to dream here perhaps of equal\nrights, equal training, equal claims and obligations: that is a\nTYPICAL sign of shallow-mindedness; and a thinker who has proved\nhimself shallow at this dangerous spot—shallow in instinct!—may\ngenerally be regarded as suspicious, nay more, as betrayed, as\ndiscovered; he will probably prove too “short” for all\nfundamental questions of life, future as well as present, and\nwill be unable to descend into ANY of the depths. On the other\nhand, a man who has depth of spirit as well as of desires, and\nhas also the depth of benevolence which is capable of severity\nand harshness, and easily confounded with them, can only think of\nwoman as ORIENTALS do: he must conceive of her as a possession,\nas confinable property, as a being predestined for service and\naccomplishing her mission therein—he must take his stand in this\nmatter upon the immense rationality of Asia, upon the superiority\nof the instinct of Asia, as the Greeks did formerly; those best\nheirs and scholars of Asia—who, as is well known, with their\nINCREASING culture and amplitude of power, from Homer to the time\nof Pericles, became gradually STRICTER towards woman, in short,\nmore Oriental. HOW necessary, HOW logical, even HOW humanely\ndesirable this was, let us consider for ourselves!\n239. The weaker sex has in no previous age been treated with so\nmuch respect by men as at present—this belongs to the tendency\nand fundamental taste of democracy, in the same way as\ndisrespectfulness to old age—what wonder is it that abuse should\nbe immediately made of this respect? They want more, they learn\nto make claims, the tribute of respect is at last felt to be\nwell-nigh galling; rivalry for rights, indeed actual strife\nitself, would be preferred: in a word, woman is losing modesty.\nAnd let us immediately add that she is also losing taste. She is\nunlearning to FEAR man: but the woman who “unlearns to fear\"\nsacrifices her most womanly instincts. That woman should venture\nforward when the fear-inspiring quality in man—or more\ndefinitely, the MAN in man—is no longer either desired or fully\ndeveloped, is reasonable enough and also intelligible enough;\nwhat is more difficult to understand is that precisely thereby—\nwoman deteriorates. This is what is happening nowadays: let us\nnot deceive ourselves about it! Wherever the industrial spirit\nhas triumphed over the military and aristocratic spirit, woman\nstrives for the economic and legal independence of a clerk:\n\"woman as clerkess” is inscribed on the portal of the modern\nsociety which is in course of formation. While she thus\nappropriates new rights, aspires to be “master,” and inscribes\n\"progress” of woman on her flags and banners, the very opposite\nrealises itself with terrible obviousness: WOMAN RETROGRADES.\nSince the French Revolution the influence of woman in Europe has\nDECLINED in proportion as she has increased her rights and\nclaims; and the “emancipation of woman,” insofar as it is desired\nand demanded by women themselves (and not only by masculine\nshallow-pates), thus proves to be a remarkable symptom of the\nincreased weakening and deadening of the most womanly instincts.\nThere is STUPIDITY in this movement, an almost masculine\nstupidity, of which a well-reared woman—who is always a sensible\nwoman—might be heartily ashamed. To lose the intuition as to the\nground upon which she can most surely achieve victory; to neglect\nexercise in the use of her proper weapons; to let-herself-go\nbefore man, perhaps even “to the book,” where formerly she kept\nherself in control and in refined, artful humility; to neutralize\nwith her virtuous audacity man’s faith in a VEILED, fundamentally\ndifferent ideal in woman, something eternally, necessarily\nfeminine; to emphatically and loquaciously dissuade man from the\nidea that woman must be preserved, cared for, protected, and\nindulged, like some delicate, strangely wild, and often pleasant\ndomestic animal; the clumsy and indignant collection of\neverything of the nature of servitude and bondage which the\nposition of woman in the hitherto existing order of society has\nentailed and still entails (as though slavery were a counter-\nargument, and not rather a condition of every higher culture, of\nevery elevation of culture):—what does all this betoken, if not\na disintegration of womanly instincts, a defeminising? Certainly,\nthere are enough of idiotic friends and corrupters of woman among\nthe learned asses of the masculine sex, who advise woman to\ndefeminize herself in this manner, and to imitate all the\nstupidities from which “man” in Europe, European “manliness,\"\nsuffers,—who would like to lower woman to “general culture,\"\nindeed even to newspaper reading and meddling with politics. Here\nand there they wish even to make women into free spirits and\nliterary workers: as though a woman without piety would not be\nsomething perfectly obnoxious or ludicrous to a profound and\ngodless man;—almost everywhere her nerves are being ruined by\nthe most morbid and dangerous kind of music (our latest German\nmusic), and she is daily being made more hysterical and more\nincapable of fulfilling her first and last function, that of\nbearing robust children. They wish to “cultivate” her in general\nstill more, and intend, as they say, to make the “weaker sex\"\nSTRONG by culture: as if history did not teach in the most\nemphatic manner that the “cultivating” of mankind and his\nweakening—that is to say, the weakening, dissipating, and\nlanguishing of his FORCE OF WILL—have always kept pace with one\nanother, and that the most powerful and influential women in the\nworld (and lastly, the mother of Napoleon) had just to thank\ntheir force of will—and not their schoolmasters—for their\npower and ascendancy over men. That which inspires respect in\nwoman, and often enough fear also, is her NATURE, which is more\n\"natural” than that of man, her genuine, carnivora-like, cunning\nflexibility, her tiger-claws beneath the glove, her NAIVETE in\negoism, her untrainableness and innate wildness, the\nincomprehensibleness, extent, and deviation of her desires and\nvirtues. That which, in spite of fear, excites one’s sympathy for\nthe dangerous and beautiful cat, “woman,” is that she seems more\nafflicted, more vulnerable, more necessitous of love, and more\ncondemned to disillusionment than any other creature. Fear and\nsympathy it is with these feelings that man has hitherto stood in\nthe presence of woman, always with one foot already in tragedy,\nwhich rends while it delights—What? And all that is now to be at\nan end? And the DISENCHANTMENT of woman is in progress? The\ntediousness of woman is slowly evolving? Oh Europe! Europe! We\nknow the horned animal which was always most attractive to thee,\nfrom which danger is ever again threatening thee! Thy old fable\nmight once more become “history\"—an immense stupidity might once\nagain overmaster thee and carry thee away! And no God concealed\nbeneath it—no! only an “idea,” a “modern idea”!\nChapter VIII: Peoples and Countries\n\n240. I HEARD, once again for the first time, Richard Wagner’s\noverture to the Mastersinger: it is a piece of magnificent,\ngorgeous, heavy, latter-day art, which has the pride to\npresuppose two centuries of music as still living, in order that\nit may be understood:—it is an honour to Germans that such a\npride did not miscalculate! What flavours and forces, what\nseasons and climes do we not find mingled in it! It impresses us\nat one time as ancient, at another time as foreign, bitter, and\ntoo modern, it is as arbitrary as it is pompously traditional, it\nis not infrequently roguish, still oftener rough and coarse—it\nhas fire and courage, and at the same time the loose, dun-\ncoloured skin of fruits which ripen too late. It flows broad and\nfull: and suddenly there is a moment of inexplicable hesitation,\nlike a gap that opens between cause and effect, an oppression\nthat makes us dream, almost a nightmare; but already it broadens\nand widens anew, the old stream of delight-the most manifold\ndelight,—of old and new happiness; including ESPECIALLY the joy\nof the artist in himself, which he refuses to conceal, his\nastonished, happy cognizance of his mastery of the expedients\nhere employed, the new, newly acquired, imperfectly tested\nexpedients of art which he apparently betrays to us. All in all,\nhowever, no beauty, no South, nothing of the delicate southern\nclearness of the sky, nothing of grace, no dance, hardly a will\nto logic; a certain clumsiness even, which is also emphasized, as\nthough the artist wished to say to us: “It is part of my\nintention\"; a cumbersome drapery, something arbitrarily barbaric\nand ceremonious, a flirring of learned and venerable conceits and\nwitticisms; something German in the best and worst sense of the\nword, something in the German style, manifold, formless, and\ninexhaustible; a certain German potency and super-plenitude of\nsoul, which is not afraid to hide itself under the RAFFINEMENTS\nof decadence—which, perhaps, feels itself most at ease there; a\nreal, genuine token of the German soul, which is at the same time\nyoung and aged, too ripe and yet still too rich in futurity. This\nkind of music expresses best what I think of the Germans: they\nbelong to the day before yesterday and the day after tomorrow—\nTHEY HAVE AS YET NO TODAY.\n241. We “good Europeans,” we also have hours when we allow\nourselves a warm-hearted patriotism, a plunge and relapse into\nold loves and narrow views—I have just given an example of it—\nhours of national excitement, of patriotic anguish, and all other\nsorts of old-fashioned floods of sentiment. Duller spirits may\nperhaps only get done with what confines its operations in us to\nhours and plays itself out in hours—in a considerable time: some\nin half a year, others in half a lifetime, according to the speed\nand strength with which they digest and “change their material.\"\nIndeed, I could think of sluggish, hesitating races, which even\nin our rapidly moving Europe, would require half a century ere\nthey could surmount such atavistic attacks of patriotism and\nsoil-attachment, and return once more to reason, that is to say,\nto “good Europeanism.” And while digressing on this possibility,\nI happen to become an ear-witness of a conversation between two\nold patriots—they were evidently both hard of hearing and\nconsequently spoke all the louder. “HE has as much, and knows as\nmuch, philosophy as a peasant or a corps-student,” said the one—\n\"he is still innocent. But what does that matter nowadays! It is\nthe age of the masses: they lie on their belly before everything\nthat is massive. And so also in politicis. A statesman who rears\nup for them a new Tower of Babel, some monstrosity of empire and\npower, they call ’great’—what does it matter that we more\nprudent and conservative ones do not meanwhile give up the old\nbelief that it is only the great thought that gives greatness to\nan action or affair. Supposing a statesman were to bring his\npeople into the position of being obliged henceforth to practise\n’high politics,’ for which they were by nature badly endowed and\nprepared, so that they would have to sacrifice their old and\nreliable virtues, out of love to a new and doubtful mediocrity;—\nsupposing a statesman were to condemn his people generally to\n’practise politics,’ when they have hitherto had something better\nto do and think about, and when in the depths of their souls they\nhave been unable to free themselves from a prudent loathing of\nthe restlessness, emptiness, and noisy wranglings of the\nessentially politics-practising nations;—supposing such a\nstatesman were to stimulate the slumbering passions and avidities\nof his people, were to make a stigma out of their former\ndiffidence and delight in aloofness, an offence out of their\nexoticism and hidden permanency, were to depreciate their most\nradical proclivities, subvert their consciences, make their minds\nnarrow, and their tastes ’national’—what! a statesman who should\ndo all this, which his people would have to do penance for\nthroughout their whole future, if they had a future, such a\nstatesman would be GREAT, would he?\"—\"Undoubtedly!” replied the\nother old patriot vehemently, “otherwise he COULD NOT have done\nit! It was mad perhaps to wish such a thing! But perhaps\neverything great has been just as mad at its commencement!\"—\n\"Misuse of words!” cried his interlocutor, contradictorily—\n\"strong! strong! Strong and mad! NOT great!\"—The old men had\nobviously become heated as they thus shouted their “truths” in\neach other’s faces, but I, in my happiness and apartness,\nconsidered how soon a stronger one may become master of the\nstrong, and also that there is a compensation for the\nintellectual superficialising of a nation—namely, in the\ndeepening of another.\n242. Whether we call it “civilization,” or “humanising,” or\n\"progress,” which now distinguishes the European, whether we call\nit simply, without praise or blame, by the political formula the\nDEMOCRATIC movement in Europe—behind all the moral and political\nforegrounds pointed to by such formulas, an immense PHYSIOLOGICAL\nPROCESS goes on, which is ever extending the process of the\nassimilation of Europeans, their increasing detachment from the\nconditions under which, climatically and hereditarily, united\nraces originate, their increasing independence of every definite\nmilieu, that for centuries would fain inscribe itself with equal\ndemands on soul and body,—that is to say, the slow emergence of\nan essentially SUPER-NATIONAL and nomadic species of man, who\npossesses, physiologically speaking, a maximum of the art and\npower of adaptation as his typical distinction. This process of\nthe EVOLVING EUROPEAN, which can be retarded in its TEMPO by\ngreat relapses, but will perhaps just gain and grow thereby in\nvehemence and depth—the still-raging storm and stress of\n\"national sentiment” pertains to it, and also the anarchism which\nis appearing at present—this process will probably arrive at\nresults on which its naive propagators and panegyrists, the\napostles of “modern ideas,” would least care to reckon. The same\nnew conditions under which on an average a levelling and\nmediocrising of man will take place—a useful, industrious,\nvariously serviceable, and clever gregarious man—are in the\nhighest degree suitable to give rise to exceptional men of the\nmost dangerous and attractive qualities. For, while the capacity\nfor adaptation, which is every day trying changing conditions,\nand begins a new work with every generation, almost with every\ndecade, makes the POWERFULNESS of the type impossible; while the\ncollective impression of such future Europeans will probably be\nthat of numerous, talkative, weak-willed, and very handy workmen\nwho REQUIRE a master, a commander, as they require their daily\nbread; while, therefore, the democratising of Europe will tend to\nthe production of a type prepared for SLAVERY in the most subtle\nsense of the term: the STRONG man will necessarily in individual\nand exceptional cases, become stronger and richer than he has\nperhaps ever been before—owing to the unprejudicedness of his\nschooling, owing to the immense variety of practice, art, and\ndisguise. I meant to say that the democratising of Europe is at\nthe same time an involuntary arrangement for the rearing of\nTYRANTS—taking the word in all its meanings, even in its most\nspiritual sense.\n243. I hear with pleasure that our sun is moving rapidly towards\nthe constellation Hercules: and I hope that the men on this earth\nwill do like the sun. And we foremost, we good Europeans!\n244. There was a time when it was customary to call Germans\n\"deep” by way of distinction; but now that the most successful\ntype of new Germanism is covetous of quite other honours, and\nperhaps misses “smartness” in all that has depth, it is almost\nopportune and patriotic to doubt whether we did not formerly\ndeceive ourselves with that commendation: in short, whether\nGerman depth is not at bottom something different and worse—and\nsomething from which, thank God, we are on the point of\nsuccessfully ridding ourselves. Let us try, then, to relearn with\nregard to German depth; the only thing necessary for the purpose\nis a little vivisection of the German soul.—The German soul is\nabove all manifold, varied in its source, aggregated and super-\nimposed, rather than actually built: this is owing to its origin.\nA German who would embolden himself to assert: “Two souls, alas,\ndwell in my breast,” would make a bad guess at the truth, or,\nmore correctly, he would come far short of the truth about the\nnumber of souls. As a people made up of the most extraordinary\nmixing and mingling of races, perhaps even with a preponderance\nof the pre-Aryan element as the “people of the centre” in every\nsense of the term, the Germans are more intangible, more ample,\nmore contradictory, more unknown, more incalculable, more\nsurprising, and even more terrifying than other peoples are to\nthemselves:—they escape DEFINITION, and are thereby alone the\ndespair of the French. It IS characteristic of the Germans that\nthe question: “What is German?” never dies out among them.\nKotzebue certainly knew his Germans well enough: “We are known,\"\nthey cried jubilantly to him—but Sand also thought he knew them.\nJean Paul knew what he was doing when he declared himself\nincensed at Fichte’s lying but patriotic flatteries and\nexaggerations,—but it is probable that Goethe thought\ndifferently about Germans from Jean Paul, even though he\nacknowledged him to be right with regard to Fichte. It is a\nquestion what Goethe really thought about the Germans?—But about\nmany things around him he never spoke explicitly, and all his\nlife he knew how to keep an astute silence—probably he had good\nreason for it. It is certain that it was not the “Wars of\nIndependence” that made him look up more joyfully, any more than\nit was the French Revolution,—the event on account of which he\nRECONSTRUCTED his “Faust,” and indeed the whole problem of “man,\"\nwas the appearance of Napoleon. There are words of Goethe in\nwhich he condemns with impatient severity, as from a foreign\nland, that which Germans take a pride in, he once defined the\nfamous German turn of mind as “Indulgence towards its own and\nothers’ weaknesses.” Was he wrong? it is characteristic of\nGermans that one is seldom entirely wrong about them. The German\nsoul has passages and galleries in it, there are caves, hiding-\nplaces, and dungeons therein, its disorder has much of the charm\nof the mysterious, the German is well acquainted with the bypaths\nto chaos. And as everything loves its symbol, so the German loves\nthe clouds and all that is obscure, evolving, crepuscular, damp,\nand shrouded, it seems to him that everything uncertain,\nundeveloped, self-displacing, and growing is “deep”. The German\nhimself does not EXIST, he is BECOMING, he is “developing\nhimself”. “Development” is therefore the essentially German\ndiscovery and hit in the great domain of philosophical formulas,—\na ruling idea, which, together with German beer and German music,\nis labouring to Germanise all Europe. Foreigners are astonished\nand attracted by the riddles which the conflicting nature at the\nbasis of the German soul propounds to them (riddles which Hegel\nsystematised and Richard Wagner has in the end set to music).\n\"Good-natured and spiteful\"—such a juxtaposition, preposterous in\nthe case of every other people, is unfortunately only too often\njustified in Germany one has only to live for a while among\nSwabians to know this! The clumsiness of the German scholar and\nhis social distastefulness agree alarmingly well with his physical\nrope-dancing and nimble boldness, of which all the Gods have\nlearnt to be afraid. If any one wishes to see the “German soul\"\ndemonstrated ad oculos, let him only look at German taste, at\nGerman arts and manners what boorish indifference to “taste”! How\nthe noblest and the commonest stand there in juxtaposition! How\ndisorderly and how rich is the whole constitution of this soul!\nThe German DRAGS at his soul, he drags at everything he\nexperiences. He digests his events badly; he never gets “done\"\nwith them; and German depth is often only a difficult, hesitating\n\"digestion.” And just as all chronic invalids, all dyspeptics like\nwhat is convenient, so the German loves “frankness” and “honesty\";\nit is so CONVENIENT to be frank and honest!—This confidingness,\nthis complaisance, this showing-the-cards of German HONESTY, is\nprobably the most dangerous and most successful disguise which the\nGerman is up to nowadays: it is his proper Mephistophelean art;\nwith this he can “still achieve much”! The German lets himself go,\nand thereby gazes with faithful, blue, empty German eyes—and\nother countries immediately confound him with his\ndressing-gown!—I meant to say that, let “German depth” be what it\nwill—among ourselves alone we perhaps take the liberty to laugh\nat it—we shall do well to continue henceforth to honour its\nappearance and good name, and not barter away too cheaply our old\nreputation as a people of depth for Prussian “smartness,” and\nBerlin wit and sand. It is wise for a people to pose, and LET\nitself be regarded, as profound, clumsy, good-natured, honest, and\nfoolish: it might even be—profound to do so! Finally, we should\ndo honour to our name—we are not called the “TIUSCHE VOLK\"\n(deceptive people) for nothing. . . .\n245. The “good old” time is past, it sang itself out in Mozart—\nhow happy are WE that his ROCOCO still speaks to us, that his\n\"good company,” his tender enthusiasm, his childish delight in\nthe Chinese and its flourishes, his courtesy of heart, his\nlonging for the elegant, the amorous, the tripping, the tearful,\nand his belief in the South, can still appeal to SOMETHING LEFT\nin us! Ah, some time or other it will be over with it!—but who\ncan doubt that it will be over still sooner with the intelligence\nand taste for Beethoven! For he was only the last echo of a break\nand transition in style, and NOT, like Mozart, the last echo of a\ngreat European taste which had existed for centuries. Beethoven\nis the intermediate event between an old mellow soul that is\nconstantly breaking down, and a future over-young soul that is\nalways COMING; there is spread over his music the twilight of\neternal loss and eternal extravagant hope,—the same light in\nwhich Europe was bathed when it dreamed with Rousseau, when it\ndanced round the Tree of Liberty of the Revolution, and finally\nalmost fell down in adoration before Napoleon. But how rapidly\ndoes THIS very sentiment now pale, how difficult nowadays is even\nthe APPREHENSION of this sentiment, how strangely does the\nlanguage of Rousseau, Schiller, Shelley, and Byron sound to our\near, in whom COLLECTIVELY the same fate of Europe was able to\nSPEAK, which knew how to SING in Beethoven!—Whatever German\nmusic came afterwards, belongs to Romanticism, that is to say, to\na movement which, historically considered, was still shorter,\nmore fleeting, and more superficial than that great interlude,\nthe transition of Europe from Rousseau to Napoleon, and to the\nrise of democracy. Weber—but what do WE care nowadays for\n\"Freischutz” and “Oberon”! Or Marschner’s “Hans Heiling” and\n\"Vampyre”! Or even Wagner’s “Tannhauser”! That is extinct,\nalthough not yet forgotten music. This whole music of\nRomanticism, besides, was not noble enough, was not musical\nenough, to maintain its position anywhere but in the theatre and\nbefore the masses; from the beginning it was second-rate music,\nwhich was little thought of by genuine musicians. It was\ndifferent with Felix Mendelssohn, that halcyon master, who, on\naccount of his lighter, purer, happier soul, quickly acquired\nadmiration, and was equally quickly forgotten: as the beautiful\nEPISODE of German music. But with regard to Robert Schumann, who\ntook things seriously, and has been taken seriously from the\nfirst—he was the last that founded a school,—do we not now\nregard it as a satisfaction, a relief, a deliverance, that this\nvery Romanticism of Schumann’s has been surmounted? Schumann,\nfleeing into the “Saxon Switzerland” of his soul, with a half\nWerther-like, half Jean-Paul-like nature (assuredly not like\nBeethoven! assuredly not like Byron!)—his MANFRED music is a\nmistake and a misunderstanding to the extent of injustice;\nSchumann, with his taste, which was fundamentally a PETTY taste\n(that is to say, a dangerous propensity—doubly dangerous among\nGermans—for quiet lyricism and intoxication of the feelings),\ngoing constantly apart, timidly withdrawing and retiring, a noble\nweakling who revelled in nothing but anonymous joy and sorrow,\nfrom the beginning a sort of girl and NOLI ME TANGERE—this\nSchumann was already merely a GERMAN event in music, and no\nlonger a European event, as Beethoven had been, as in a still\ngreater degree Mozart had been; with Schumann German music was\nthreatened with its greatest danger, that of LOSING THE VOICE FOR\nTHE SOUL OF EUROPE and sinking into a merely national affair.\n246. What a torture are books written in German to a reader who\nhas a THIRD ear! How indignantly he stands beside the slowly\nturning swamp of sounds without tune and rhythms without dance,\nwhich Germans call a “book”! And even the German who READS books!\nHow lazily, how reluctantly, how badly he reads! How many Germans\nknow, and consider it obligatory to know, that there is ART in\nevery good sentence—art which must be divined, if the sentence\nis to be understood! If there is a misunderstanding about its\nTEMPO, for instance, the sentence itself is misunderstood! That\none must not be doubtful about the rhythm-determining syllables,\nthat one should feel the breaking of the too-rigid symmetry as\nintentional and as a charm, that one should lend a fine and\npatient ear to every STACCATO and every RUBATO, that one should\ndivine the sense in the sequence of the vowels and diphthongs,\nand how delicately and richly they can be tinted and retinted in\nthe order of their arrangement—who among book-reading Germans is\ncomplaisant enough to recognize such duties and requirements, and\nto listen to so much art and intention in language? After all,\none just “has no ear for it\"; and so the most marked contrasts of\nstyle are not heard, and the most delicate artistry is as it were\nSQUANDERED on the deaf.—These were my thoughts when I noticed\nhow clumsily and unintuitively two masters in the art of prose-\nwriting have been confounded: one, whose words drop down\nhesitatingly and coldly, as from the roof of a damp cave—he\ncounts on their dull sound and echo; and another who manipulates\nhis language like a flexible sword, and from his arm down into\nhis toes feels the dangerous bliss of the quivering, over-sharp\nblade, which wishes to bite, hiss, and cut.\n247. How little the German style has to do with harmony and with\nthe ear, is shown by the fact that precisely our good musicians\nthemselves write badly. The German does not read aloud, he does\nnot read for the ear, but only with his eyes; he has put his ears\naway in the drawer for the time. In antiquity when a man read—\nwhich was seldom enough—he read something to himself, and in a\nloud voice; they were surprised when any one read silently, and\nsought secretly the reason of it. In a loud voice: that is to\nsay, with all the swellings, inflections, and variations of key\nand changes of TEMPO, in which the ancient PUBLIC world took\ndelight. The laws of the written style were then the same as\nthose of the spoken style; and these laws depended partly on the\nsurprising development and refined requirements of the ear and\nlarynx; partly on the strength, endurance, and power of the\nancient lungs. In the ancient sense, a period is above all a\nphysiological whole, inasmuch as it is comprised in one breath.\nSuch periods as occur in Demosthenes and Cicero, swelling twice\nand sinking twice, and all in one breath, were pleasures to the\nmen of ANTIQUITY, who knew by their own schooling how to\nappreciate the virtue therein, the rareness and the difficulty in\nthe deliverance of such a period;—WE have really no right to the\nBIG period, we modern men, who are short of breath in every\nsense! Those ancients, indeed, were all of them dilettanti in\nspeaking, consequently connoisseurs, consequently critics—they\nthus brought their orators to the highest pitch; in the same\nmanner as in the last century, when all Italian ladies and\ngentlemen knew how to sing, the virtuosoship of song (and with it\nalso the art of melody) reached its elevation. In Germany,\nhowever (until quite recently when a kind of platform eloquence\nbegan shyly and awkwardly enough to flutter its young wings),\nthere was properly speaking only one kind of public and\nAPPROXIMATELY artistical discourse—that delivered from the\npulpit. The preacher was the only one in Germany who knew the\nweight of a syllable or a word, in what manner a sentence\nstrikes, springs, rushes, flows, and comes to a close; he alone\nhad a conscience in his ears, often enough a bad conscience: for\nreasons are not lacking why proficiency in oratory should be\nespecially seldom attained by a German, or almost always too\nlate. The masterpiece of German prose is therefore with good\nreason the masterpiece of its greatest preacher: the BIBLE has\nhitherto been the best German book. Compared with Luther’s Bible,\nalmost everything else is merely “literature\"—something which\nhas not grown in Germany, and therefore has not taken and does\nnot take root in German hearts, as the Bible has done.\n248. There are two kinds of geniuses: one which above all\nengenders and seeks to engender, and another which willingly lets\nitself be fructified and brings forth. And similarly, among the\ngifted nations, there are those on whom the woman’s problem of\npregnancy has devolved, and the secret task of forming, maturing,\nand perfecting—the Greeks, for instance, were a nation of this\nkind, and so are the French; and others which have to fructify\nand become the cause of new modes of life—like the Jews, the\nRomans, and, in all modesty be it asked: like the Germans?—\nnations tortured and enraptured by unknown fevers and\nirresistibly forced out of themselves, amorous and longing for\nforeign races (for such as “let themselves be fructified”), and\nwithal imperious, like everything conscious of being full of\ngenerative force, and consequently empowered “by the grace of\nGod.” These two kinds of geniuses seek each other like man and\nwoman; but they also misunderstand each other—like man and\nwoman.\n249. Every nation has its own “Tartuffery,” and calls that its\nvirtue.—One does not know—cannot know, the best that is in one.\n250. What Europe owes to the Jews?—Many things, good and bad,\nand above all one thing of the nature both of the best and the\nworst: the grand style in morality, the fearfulness and majesty\nof infinite demands, of infinite significations, the whole\nRomanticism and sublimity of moral questionableness—and\nconsequently just the most attractive, ensnaring, and exquisite\nelement in those iridescences and allurements to life, in the\naftersheen of which the sky of our European culture, its evening\nsky, now glows—perhaps glows out. For this, we artists among the\nspectators and philosophers, are—grateful to the Jews.\n251. It must be taken into the bargain, if various clouds and\ndisturbances—in short, slight attacks of stupidity—pass over\nthe spirit of a people that suffers and WANTS to suffer from\nnational nervous fever and political ambition: for instance,\namong present-day Germans there is alternately the anti-French\nfolly, the anti-Semitic folly, the anti-Polish folly, the\nChristian-romantic folly, the Wagnerian folly, the Teutonic\nfolly, the Prussian folly (just look at those poor historians,\nthe Sybels and Treitschkes, and their closely bandaged heads),\nand whatever else these little obscurations of the German spirit\nand conscience may be called. May it be forgiven me that I, too,\nwhen on a short daring sojourn on very infected ground, did not\nremain wholly exempt from the disease, but like every one else,\nbegan to entertain thoughts about matters which did not concern\nme—the first symptom of political infection. About the Jews, for\ninstance, listen to the following:—I have never yet met a German\nwho was favourably inclined to the Jews; and however decided the\nrepudiation of actual anti-Semitism may be on the part of all\nprudent and political men, this prudence and policy is not\nperhaps directed against the nature of the sentiment itself, but\nonly against its dangerous excess, and especially against the\ndistasteful and infamous expression of this excess of sentiment;\n—on this point we must not deceive ourselves. That Germany has\namply SUFFICIENT Jews, that the German stomach, the German blood,\nhas difficulty (and will long have difficulty) in disposing only\nof this quantity of “Jew\"—as the Italian, the Frenchman, and the\nEnglishman have done by means of a stronger digestion:—that is\nthe unmistakable declaration and language of a general instinct,\nto which one must listen and according to which one must act.\n\"Let no more Jews come in! And shut the doors, especially towards\nthe East (also towards Austria)!\"—thus commands the instinct of\na people whose nature is still feeble and uncertain, so that it\ncould be easily wiped out, easily extinguished, by a stronger\nrace. The Jews, however, are beyond all doubt the strongest,\ntoughest, and purest race at present living in Europe, they know\nhow to succeed even under the worst conditions (in fact better\nthan under favourable ones), by means of virtues of some sort,\nwhich one would like nowadays to label as vices—owing above all\nto a resolute faith which does not need to be ashamed before\n\"modern ideas”, they alter only, WHEN they do alter, in the same\nway that the Russian Empire makes its conquest—as an empire that\nhas plenty of time and is not of yesterday—namely, according to\nthe principle, “as slowly as possible”! A thinker who has the\nfuture of Europe at heart, will, in all his perspectives\nconcerning the future, calculate upon the Jews, as he will\ncalculate upon the Russians, as above all the surest and\nlikeliest factors in the great play and battle of forces. That\nwhich is at present called a “nation” in Europe, and is really\nrather a RES FACTA than NATA (indeed, sometimes confusingly\nsimilar to a RES FICTA ET PICTA), is in every case something\nevolving, young, easily displaced, and not yet a race, much less\nsuch a race AERE PERENNUS, as the Jews are such “nations” should\nmost carefully avoid all hotheaded rivalry and hostility! It is\ncertain that the Jews, if they desired—or if they were driven to\nit, as the anti-Semites seem to wish—COULD now have the\nascendancy, nay, literally the supremacy, over Europe, that they\nare NOT working and planning for that end is equally certain.\nMeanwhile, they rather wish and desire, even somewhat\nimportunely, to be insorbed and absorbed by Europe, they long to\nbe finally settled, authorized, and respected somewhere, and wish\nto put an end to the nomadic life, to the “wandering Jew”,—and\none should certainly take account of this impulse and tendency,\nand MAKE ADVANCES to it (it possibly betokens a mitigation of the\nJewish instincts) for which purpose it would perhaps be useful\nand fair to banish the anti-Semitic bawlers out of the country.\nOne should make advances with all prudence, and with selection,\npretty much as the English nobility do It stands to reason that\nthe more powerful and strongly marked types of new Germanism\ncould enter into relation with the Jews with the least\nhesitation, for instance, the nobleman officer from the Prussian\nborder it would be interesting in many ways to see whether the\ngenius for money and patience (and especially some intellect and\nintellectuality—sadly lacking in the place referred to) could\nnot in addition be annexed and trained to the hereditary art of\ncommanding and obeying—for both of which the country in question\nhas now a classic reputation But here it is expedient to break\noff my festal discourse and my sprightly Teutonomania for I have\nalready reached my SERIOUS TOPIC, the “European problem,” as I\nunderstand it, the rearing of a new ruling caste for Europe.\n252. They are not a philosophical race—the English: Bacon\nrepresents an ATTACK on the philosophical spirit generally,\nHobbes, Hume, and Locke, an abasement, and a depreciation of the\nidea of a “philosopher” for more than a century. It was AGAINST\nHume that Kant uprose and raised himself; it was Locke of whom\nSchelling RIGHTLY said, “JE MEPRISE LOCKE\"; in the struggle\nagainst the English mechanical stultification of the world, Hegel\nand Schopenhauer (along with Goethe) were of one accord; the two\nhostile brother-geniuses in philosophy, who pushed in different\ndirections towards the opposite poles of German thought, and\nthereby wronged each other as only brothers will do.—What is\nlacking in England, and has always been lacking, that half-actor\nand rhetorician knew well enough, the absurd muddle-head,\nCarlyle, who sought to conceal under passionate grimaces what he\nknew about himself: namely, what was LACKING in Carlyle—real\nPOWER of intellect, real DEPTH of intellectual perception, in\nshort, philosophy. It is characteristic of such an\nunphilosophical race to hold on firmly to Christianity—they NEED\nits discipline for “moralizing” and humanizing. The Englishman,\nmore gloomy, sensual, headstrong, and brutal than the German—is\nfor that very reason, as the baser of the two, also the most\npious: he has all the MORE NEED of Christianity. To finer\nnostrils, this English Christianity itself has still a\ncharacteristic English taint of spleen and alcoholic excess, for\nwhich, owing to good reasons, it is used as an antidote—the\nfiner poison to neutralize the coarser: a finer form of poisoning\nis in fact a step in advance with coarse-mannered people, a step\ntowards spiritualization. The English coarseness and rustic\ndemureness is still most satisfactorily disguised by Christian\npantomime, and by praying and psalm-singing (or, more correctly,\nit is thereby explained and differently expressed); and for the\nherd of drunkards and rakes who formerly learned moral grunting\nunder the influence of Methodism (and more recently as the\n\"Salvation Army”), a penitential fit may really be the relatively\nhighest manifestation of “humanity” to which they can be\nelevated: so much may reasonably be admitted. That, however,\nwhich offends even in the humanest Englishman is his lack of\nmusic, to speak figuratively (and also literally): he has neither\nrhythm nor dance in the movements of his soul and body; indeed,\nnot even the desire for rhythm and dance, for “music.” Listen to\nhim speaking; look at the most beautiful Englishwoman WALKING—in\nno country on earth are there more beautiful doves and swans;\nfinally, listen to them singing! But I ask too much . . .\n253. There are truths which are best recognized by mediocre\nminds, because they are best adapted for them, there are truths\nwhich only possess charms and seductive power for mediocre\nspirits:—one is pushed to this probably unpleasant conclusion,\nnow that the influence of respectable but mediocre Englishmen—I\nmay mention Darwin, John Stuart Mill, and Herbert Spencer—begins\nto gain the ascendancy in the middle-class region of European\ntaste. Indeed, who could doubt that it is a useful thing for SUCH\nminds to have the ascendancy for a time? It would be an error to\nconsider the highly developed and independently soaring minds as\nspecially qualified for determining and collecting many little\ncommon facts, and deducing conclusions from them; as exceptions,\nthey are rather from the first in no very favourable position\ntowards those who are “the rules.” After all, they have more to\ndo than merely to perceive:—in effect, they have to BE something\nnew, they have to SIGNIFY something new, they have to REPRESENT\nnew values! The gulf between knowledge and capacity is perhaps\ngreater, and also more mysterious, than one thinks: the capable\nman in the grand style, the creator, will possibly have to be an\nignorant person;—while on the other hand, for scientific\ndiscoveries like those of Darwin, a certain narrowness, aridity,\nand industrious carefulness (in short, something English) may not\nbe unfavourable for arriving at them.—Finally, let it not be\nforgotten that the English, with their profound mediocrity,\nbrought about once before a general depression of European\nintelligence.\nWhat is called “modern ideas,” or “the ideas of the eighteenth\ncentury,” or “French ideas\"—that, consequently, against which\nthe GERMAN mind rose up with profound disgust—is of English\norigin, there is no doubt about it. The French were only the apes\nand actors of these ideas, their best soldiers, and likewise,\nalas! their first and profoundest VICTIMS; for owing to the\ndiabolical Anglomania of “modern ideas,” the AME FRANCAIS has in\nthe end become so thin and emaciated, that at present one recalls\nits sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, its profound, passionate\nstrength, its inventive excellency, almost with disbelief. One\nmust, however, maintain this verdict of historical justice in a\ndetermined manner, and defend it against present prejudices and\nappearances: the European NOBLESSE—of sentiment, taste, and\nmanners, taking the word in every high sense—is the work and\ninvention of FRANCE; the European ignobleness, the plebeianism of\nmodern ideas—is ENGLAND’S work and invention.\n254. Even at present France is still the seat of the most\nintellectual and refined culture of Europe, it is still the high\nschool of taste; but one must know how to find this “France of\ntaste.” He who belongs to it keeps himself well concealed:—they\nmay be a small number in whom it lives and is embodied, besides\nperhaps being men who do not stand upon the strongest legs, in\npart fatalists, hypochondriacs, invalids, in part persons over-\nindulged, over-refined, such as have the AMBITION to conceal\nthemselves.\nThey have all something in common: they keep their ears closed in\npresence of the delirious folly and noisy spouting of the\ndemocratic BOURGEOIS. In fact, a besotted and brutalized France\nat present sprawls in the foreground—it recently celebrated a\nveritable orgy of bad taste, and at the same time of self-\nadmiration, at the funeral of Victor Hugo. There is also\nsomething else common to them: a predilection to resist\nintellectual Germanizing—and a still greater inability to do so!\nIn this France of intellect, which is also a France of pessimism,\nSchopenhauer has perhaps become more at home, and more indigenous\nthan he has ever been in Germany; not to speak of Heinrich Heine,\nwho has long ago been re-incarnated in the more refined and\nfastidious lyrists of Paris; or of Hegel, who at present, in the\nform of Taine—the FIRST of living historians—exercises an\nalmost tyrannical influence. As regards Richard Wagner, however,\nthe more French music learns to adapt itself to the actual needs\nof the AME MODERNE, the more will it “Wagnerite\"; one can safely\npredict that beforehand,—it is already taking place\nsufficiently! There are, however, three things which the French\ncan still boast of with pride as their heritage and possession,\nand as indelible tokens of their ancient intellectual superiority\nin Europe, in spite of all voluntary or involuntary Germanizing\nand vulgarizing of taste. FIRSTLY, the capacity for artistic\nemotion, for devotion to “form,” for which the expression, L’ART\nPOUR L’ART, along with numerous others, has been invented:—such\ncapacity has not been lacking in France for three centuries; and\nowing to its reverence for the “small number,” it has again and\nagain made a sort of chamber music of literature possible, which\nis sought for in vain elsewhere in Europe.—The SECOND thing\nwhereby the French can lay claim to a superiority over Europe is\ntheir ancient, many-sided, MORALISTIC culture, owing to which one\nfinds on an average, even in the petty ROMANCIERS of the\nnewspapers and chance BOULEVARDIERS DE PARIS, a psychological\nsensitiveness and curiosity, of which, for example, one has no\nconception (to say nothing of the thing itself!) in Germany. The\nGermans lack a couple of centuries of the moralistic work\nrequisite thereto, which, as we have said, France has not\ngrudged: those who call the Germans “naive” on that account give\nthem commendation for a defect. (As the opposite of the German\ninexperience and innocence IN VOLUPTATE PSYCHOLOGICA, which is\nnot too remotely associated with the tediousness of German\nintercourse,—and as the most successful expression of genuine\nFrench curiosity and inventive talent in this domain of delicate\nthrills, Henri Beyle may be noted; that remarkable anticipatory\nand forerunning man, who, with a Napoleonic TEMPO, traversed HIS\nEurope, in fact, several centuries of the European soul, as a\nsurveyor and discoverer thereof:—it has required two generations\nto OVERTAKE him one way or other, to divine long afterwards some\nof the riddles that perplexed and enraptured him—this strange\nEpicurean and man of interrogation, the last great psychologist\nof France).—There is yet a THIRD claim to superiority: in the\nFrench character there is a successful half-way synthesis of the\nNorth and South, which makes them comprehend many things, and\nenjoins upon them other things, which an Englishman can never\ncomprehend. Their temperament, turned alternately to and from the\nSouth, in which from time to time the Provencal and Ligurian\nblood froths over, preserves them from the dreadful, northern\ngrey-in-grey, from sunless conceptual-spectrism and from poverty\nof blood—our GERMAN infirmity of taste, for the excessive\nprevalence of which at the present moment, blood and iron, that\nis to say “high politics,” has with great resolution been\nprescribed (according to a dangerous healing art, which bids me\nwait and wait, but not yet hope).—There is also still in France\na pre-understanding and ready welcome for those rarer and rarely\ngratified men, who are too comprehensive to find satisfaction in\nany kind of fatherlandism, and know how to love the South when in\nthe North and the North when in the South—the born Midlanders,\nthe “good Europeans.” For them BIZET has made music, this latest\ngenius, who has seen a new beauty and seduction,—who has\ndiscovered a piece of the SOUTH IN MUSIC.\n255. I hold that many precautions should be taken against German\nmusic. Suppose a person loves the South as I love it—as a great\nschool of recovery for the most spiritual and the most sensuous\nills, as a boundless solar profusion and effulgence which\no’erspreads a sovereign existence believing in itself—well, such\na person will learn to be somewhat on his guard against German\nmusic, because, in injuring his taste anew, it will also injure\nhis health anew. Such a Southerner, a Southerner not by origin\nbut by BELIEF, if he should dream of the future of music, must\nalso dream of it being freed from the influence of the North; and\nmust have in his ears the prelude to a deeper, mightier, and\nperhaps more perverse and mysterious music, a super-German music,\nwhich does not fade, pale, and die away, as all German music\ndoes, at the sight of the blue, wanton sea and the Mediterranean\nclearness of sky—a super-European music, which holds its own\neven in presence of the brown sunsets of the desert, whose soul\nis akin to the palm-tree, and can be at home and can roam with\nbig, beautiful, lonely beasts of prey . . . I could imagine a music\nof which the rarest charm would be that it knew nothing more of\ngood and evil; only that here and there perhaps some sailor’s\nhome-sickness, some golden shadows and tender weaknesses might\nsweep lightly over it; an art which, from the far distance, would\nsee the colours of a sinking and almost incomprehensible MORAL\nworld fleeing towards it, and would be hospitable enough and\nprofound enough to receive such belated fugitives.\n256. Owing to the morbid estrangement which the nationality-craze\nhas induced and still induces among the nations of Europe, owing\nalso to the short-sighted and hasty-handed politicians, who with\nthe help of this craze, are at present in power, and do not\nsuspect to what extent the disintegrating policy they pursue must\nnecessarily be only an interlude policy—owing to all this and\nmuch else that is altogether unmentionable at present, the most\nunmistakable signs that EUROPE WISHES TO BE ONE, are now\noverlooked, or arbitrarily and falsely misinterpreted. With all\nthe more profound and large-minded men of this century, the real\ngeneral tendency of the mysterious labour of their souls was to\nprepare the way for that new SYNTHESIS, and tentatively to\nanticipate the European of the future; only in their simulations,\nor in their weaker moments, in old age perhaps, did they belong\nto the “fatherlands\"—they only rested from themselves when they\nbecame “patriots.” I think of such men as Napoleon, Goethe,\nBeethoven, Stendhal, Heinrich Heine, Schopenhauer: it must not be\ntaken amiss if I also count Richard Wagner among them, about whom\none must not let oneself be deceived by his own misunderstandings\n(geniuses like him have seldom the right to understand\nthemselves), still less, of course, by the unseemly noise with\nwhich he is now resisted and opposed in France: the fact remains,\nnevertheless, that Richard Wagner and the LATER FRENCH\nROMANTICISM of the forties, are most closely and intimately\nrelated to one another. They are akin, fundamentally akin, in all\nthe heights and depths of their requirements; it is Europe, the\nONE Europe, whose soul presses urgently and longingly, outwards\nand upwards, in their multifarious and boisterous art—whither?\ninto a new light? towards a new sun? But who would attempt to\nexpress accurately what all these masters of new modes of speech\ncould not express distinctly? It is certain that the same storm\nand stress tormented them, that they SOUGHT in the same manner,\nthese last great seekers! All of them steeped in literature to\ntheir eyes and ears—the first artists of universal literary\nculture—for the most part even themselves writers, poets,\nintermediaries and blenders of the arts and the senses (Wagner,\nas musician is reckoned among painters, as poet among musicians,\nas artist generally among actors); all of them fanatics for\nEXPRESSION “at any cost\"—I specially mention Delacroix, the\nnearest related to Wagner; all of them great discoverers in the\nrealm of the sublime, also of the loathsome and dreadful, still\ngreater discoverers in effect, in display, in the art of the\nshow-shop; all of them talented far beyond their genius, out and\nout VIRTUOSI, with mysterious accesses to all that seduces,\nallures, constrains, and upsets; born enemies of logic and of the\nstraight line, hankering after the strange, the exotic, the\nmonstrous, the crooked, and the self-contradictory; as men,\nTantaluses of the will, plebeian parvenus, who knew themselves to\nbe incapable of a noble TEMPO or of a LENTO in life and action—\nthink of Balzac, for instance,—unrestrained workers, almost\ndestroying themselves by work; antinomians and rebels in manners,\nambitious and insatiable, without equilibrium and enjoyment; all\nof them finally shattering and sinking down at the Christian\ncross (and with right and reason, for who of them would have been\nsufficiently profound and sufficiently original for an ANTI-\nCHRISTIAN philosophy?);—on the whole, a boldly daring,\nsplendidly overbearing, high-flying, and aloft-up-dragging class\nof higher men, who had first to teach their century-and it is the\ncentury of the MASSES—the conception “higher man.” . . . Let the\nGerman friends of Richard Wagner advise together as to whether\nthere is anything purely German in the Wagnerian art, or whether\nits distinction does not consist precisely in coming from SUPER-\nGERMAN sources and impulses: in which connection it may not be\nunderrated how indispensable Paris was to the development of his\ntype, which the strength of his instincts made him long to visit\nat the most decisive time—and how the whole style of his\nproceedings, of his self-apostolate, could only perfect itself in\nsight of the French socialistic original. On a more subtle\ncomparison it will perhaps be found, to the honour of Richard\nWagner’s German nature, that he has acted in everything with more\nstrength, daring, severity, and elevation than a nineteenth-\ncentury Frenchman could have done—owing to the circumstance that\nwe Germans are as yet nearer to barbarism than the French;—\nperhaps even the most remarkable creation of Richard Wagner is\nnot only at present, but for ever inaccessible, incomprehensible,\nand inimitable to the whole latter-day Latin race: the figure of\nSiegfried, that VERY FREE man, who is probably far too free, too\nhard, too cheerful, too healthy, too ANTI-CATHOLIC for the taste\nof old and mellow civilized nations. He may even have been a sin\nagainst Romanticism, this anti-Latin Siegfried: well, Wagner\natoned amply for this sin in his old sad days, when—anticipating\na taste which has meanwhile passed into politics—he began, with\nthe religious vehemence peculiar to him, to preach, at least, THE\nWAY TO ROME, if not to walk therein.—That these last words may\nnot be misunderstood, I will call to my aid a few powerful\nrhymes, which will even betray to less delicate ears what I mean\n—what I mean COUNTER TO the “last Wagner” and his Parsifal music:—\n—Is this our mode?—From German heart came this vexed ululating?\nFrom German body, this self-lacerating? Is ours this priestly\nhand-dilation, This incense-fuming exaltation? Is ours this\nfaltering, falling, shambling, This quite uncertain ding-dong-\ndangling? This sly nun-ogling, Ave-hour-bell ringing, This wholly\nfalse enraptured heaven-o’erspringing?—Is this our mode?—Think\nwell!—ye still wait for admission—For what ye hear is ROME—\nROME’S FAITH BY INTUITION!\nChapter IX: What is Noble?\n\n257. EVERY elevation of the type “man,” has hitherto been the\nwork of an aristocratic society and so it will always be—a\nsociety believing in a long scale of gradations of rank and\ndifferences of worth among human beings, and requiring slavery in\nsome form or other. Without the PATHOS OF DISTANCE, such as grows\nout of the incarnated difference of classes, out of the constant\nout-looking and down-looking of the ruling caste on subordinates\nand instruments, and out of their equally constant practice of\nobeying and commanding, of keeping down and keeping at a\ndistance—that other more mysterious pathos could never have\narisen, the longing for an ever new widening of distance within\nthe soul itself, the formation of ever higher, rarer, further,\nmore extended, more comprehensive states, in short, just the\nelevation of the type “man,” the continued “self-surmounting of\nman,” to use a moral formula in a supermoral sense. To be sure,\none must not resign oneself to any humanitarian illusions about\nthe history of the origin of an aristocratic society (that is to\nsay, of the preliminary condition for the elevation of the type\n\"man”): the truth is hard. Let us acknowledge unprejudicedly how\nevery higher civilization hitherto has ORIGINATED! Men with a\nstill natural nature, barbarians in every terrible sense of the\nword, men of prey, still in possession of unbroken strength of\nwill and desire for power, threw themselves upon weaker, more\nmoral, more peaceful races (perhaps trading or cattle-rearing\ncommunities), or upon old mellow civilizations in which the final\nvital force was flickering out in brilliant fireworks of wit and\ndepravity. At the commencement, the noble caste was always the\nbarbarian caste: their superiority did not consist first of all\nin their physical, but in their psychical power—they were more\nCOMPLETE men (which at every point also implies the same as “more\ncomplete beasts”).\n258. Corruption—as the indication that anarchy threatens to\nbreak out among the instincts, and that the foundation of the\nemotions, called “life,” is convulsed—is something radically\ndifferent according to the organization in which it manifests\nitself. When, for instance, an aristocracy like that of France at\nthe beginning of the Revolution, flung away its privileges with\nsublime disgust and sacrificed itself to an excess of its moral\nsentiments, it was corruption:—it was really only the closing\nact of the corruption which had existed for centuries, by virtue\nof which that aristocracy had abdicated step by step its lordly\nprerogatives and lowered itself to a FUNCTION of royalty (in the\nend even to its decoration and parade-dress). The essential\nthing, however, in a good and healthy aristocracy is that it\nshould not regard itself as a function either of the kingship or\nthe commonwealth, but as the SIGNIFICANCE and highest\njustification thereof—that it should therefore accept with a\ngood conscience the sacrifice of a legion of individuals, who,\nFOR ITS SAKE, must be suppressed and reduced to imperfect men, to\nslaves and instruments. Its fundamental belief must be precisely\nthat society is NOT allowed to exist for its own sake, but only\nas a foundation and scaffolding, by means of which a select class\nof beings may be able to elevate themselves to their higher\nduties, and in general to a higher EXISTENCE: like those sun-\nseeking climbing plants in Java—they are called Sipo Matador,—\nwhich encircle an oak so long and so often with their arms, until\nat last, high above it, but supported by it, they can unfold\ntheir tops in the open light, and exhibit their happiness.\n259. To refrain mutually from injury, from violence, from\nexploitation, and put one’s will on a par with that of others:\nthis may result in a certain rough sense in good conduct among\nindividuals when the necessary conditions are given (namely, the\nactual similarity of the individuals in amount of force and\ndegree of worth, and their co-relation within one organization).\nAs soon, however, as one wished to take this principle more\ngenerally, and if possible even as the FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF\nSOCIETY, it would immediately disclose what it really is—namely,\na Will to the DENIAL of life, a principle of dissolution and\ndecay. Here one must think profoundly to the very basis and\nresist all sentimental weakness: life itself is ESSENTIALLY\nappropriation, injury, conquest of the strange and weak,\nsuppression, severity, obtrusion of peculiar forms,\nincorporation, and at the least, putting it mildest,\nexploitation;—but why should one for ever use precisely these\nwords on which for ages a disparaging purpose has been stamped?\nEven the organization within which, as was previously supposed,\nthe individuals treat each other as equal—it takes place in\nevery healthy aristocracy—must itself, if it be a living and not\na dying organization, do all that towards other bodies, which the\nindividuals within it refrain from doing to each other it will\nhave to be the incarnated Will to Power, it will endeavour to\ngrow, to gain ground, attract to itself and acquire ascendancy—\nnot owing to any morality or immorality, but because it LIVES,\nand because life IS precisely Will to Power. On no point,\nhowever, is the ordinary consciousness of Europeans more\nunwilling to be corrected than on this matter, people now rave\neverywhere, even under the guise of science, about coming\nconditions of society in which “the exploiting character” is to\nbe absent—that sounds to my ears as if they promised to invent a\nmode of life which should refrain from all organic functions.\n\"Exploitation” does not belong to a depraved, or imperfect and\nprimitive society it belongs to the nature of the living being as\na primary organic function, it is a consequence of the intrinsic\nWill to Power, which is precisely the Will to Life—Granting that\nas a theory this is a novelty—as a reality it is the FUNDAMENTAL\nFACT of all history let us be so far honest towards ourselves!\n260. In a tour through the many finer and coarser moralities\nwhich have hitherto prevailed or still prevail on the earth, I\nfound certain traits recurring regularly together, and connected\nwith one another, until finally two primary types revealed\nthemselves to me, and a radical distinction was brought to light.\nThere is MASTER-MORALITY and SLAVE-MORALITY,—I would at once\nadd, however, that in all higher and mixed civilizations, there\nare also attempts at the reconciliation of the two moralities,\nbut one finds still oftener the confusion and mutual\nmisunderstanding of them, indeed sometimes their close\njuxtaposition—even in the same man, within one soul. The\ndistinctions of moral values have either originated in a ruling\ncaste, pleasantly conscious of being different from the ruled—or\namong the ruled class, the slaves and dependents of all sorts. In\nthe first case, when it is the rulers who determine the\nconception “good,” it is the exalted, proud disposition which is\nregarded as the distinguishing feature, and that which determines\nthe order of rank. The noble type of man separates from himself\nthe beings in whom the opposite of this exalted, proud\ndisposition displays itself he despises them. Let it at once be\nnoted that in this first kind of morality the antithesis “good\"\nand “bad” means practically the same as “noble” and\n\"despicable”,—the antithesis “good” and “EVIL” is of a different\norigin. The cowardly, the timid, the insignificant, and those\nthinking merely of narrow utility are despised; moreover, also,\nthe distrustful, with their constrained glances, the self-\nabasing, the dog-like kind of men who let themselves be abused,\nthe mendicant flatterers, and above all the liars:—it is a\nfundamental belief of all aristocrats that the common people are\nuntruthful. “We truthful ones\"—the nobility in ancient Greece\ncalled themselves. It is obvious that everywhere the designations\nof moral value were at first applied to MEN; and were only\nderivatively and at a later period applied to ACTIONS; it is a\ngross mistake, therefore, when historians of morals start with\nquestions like, “Why have sympathetic actions been praised?” The\nnoble type of man regards HIMSELF as a determiner of values; he\ndoes not require to be approved of; he passes the judgment: “What\nis injurious to me is injurious in itself;” he knows that it is he\nhimself only who confers honour on things; he is a CREATOR OF\nVALUES. He honours whatever he recognizes in himself: such\nmorality equals self-glorification. In the foreground there is\nthe feeling of plenitude, of power, which seeks to overflow, the\nhappiness of high tension, the consciousness of a wealth which\nwould fain give and bestow:—the noble man also helps the\nunfortunate, but not—or scarcely—out of pity, but rather from\nan impulse generated by the super-abundance of power. The noble\nman honours in himself the powerful one, him also who has power\nover himself, who knows how to speak and how to keep silence, who\ntakes pleasure in subjecting himself to severity and hardness,\nand has reverence for all that is severe and hard. “Wotan placed\na hard heart in my breast,” says an old Scandinavian Saga: it is\nthus rightly expressed from the soul of a proud Viking. Such a\ntype of man is even proud of not being made for sympathy; the\nhero of the Saga therefore adds warningly: “He who has not a hard\nheart when young, will never have one.” The noble and brave who\nthink thus are the furthest removed from the morality which sees\nprecisely in sympathy, or in acting for the good of others, or in\nDESINTERESSEMENT, the characteristic of the moral; faith in\noneself, pride in oneself, a radical enmity and irony towards\n\"selflessness,” belong as definitely to noble morality, as do a\ncareless scorn and precaution in presence of sympathy and the\n\"warm heart.\"—It is the powerful who KNOW how to honour, it is\ntheir art, their domain for invention. The profound reverence for\nage and for tradition—all law rests on this double reverence,—\nthe belief and prejudice in favour of ancestors and unfavourable\nto newcomers, is typical in the morality of the powerful; and if,\nreversely, men of “modern ideas” believe almost instinctively in\n\"progress” and the “future,” and are more and more lacking in\nrespect for old age, the ignoble origin of these “ideas” has\ncomplacently betrayed itself thereby. A morality of the ruling\nclass, however, is more especially foreign and irritating to\npresent-day taste in the sternness of its principle that one has\nduties only to one’s equals; that one may act towards beings of a\nlower rank, towards all that is foreign, just as seems good to\none, or “as the heart desires,” and in any case “beyond good and\nevil”: it is here that sympathy and similar sentiments can have a\nplace. The ability and obligation to exercise prolonged gratitude\nand prolonged revenge—both only within the circle of equals,—\nartfulness in retaliation, RAFFINEMENT of the idea in friendship,\na certain necessity to have enemies (as outlets for the emotions\nof envy, quarrelsomeness, arrogance—in fact, in order to be a\ngood FRIEND): all these are typical characteristics of the noble\nmorality, which, as has been pointed out, is not the morality of\n\"modern ideas,” and is therefore at present difficult to realize,\nand also to unearth and disclose.—It is otherwise with the\nsecond type of morality, SLAVE-MORALITY. Supposing that the\nabused, the oppressed, the suffering, the unemancipated, the\nweary, and those uncertain of themselves should moralize, what\nwill be the common element in their moral estimates? Probably a\npessimistic suspicion with regard to the entire situation of man\nwill find expression, perhaps a condemnation of man, together\nwith his situation. The slave has an unfavourable eye for the\nvirtues of the powerful; he has a skepticism and distrust, a\nREFINEMENT of distrust of everything “good” that is there\nhonoured—he would fain persuade himself that the very happiness\nthere is not genuine. On the other hand, THOSE qualities which\nserve to alleviate the existence of sufferers are brought into\nprominence and flooded with light; it is here that sympathy, the\nkind, helping hand, the warm heart, patience, diligence,\nhumility, and friendliness attain to honour; for here these are\nthe most useful qualities, and almost the only means of\nsupporting the burden of existence. Slave-morality is essentially\nthe morality of utility. Here is the seat of the origin of the\nfamous antithesis “good” and “evil”:—power and dangerousness are\nassumed to reside in the evil, a certain dreadfulness, subtlety,\nand strength, which do not admit of being despised. According to\nslave-morality, therefore, the “evil” man arouses fear; according\nto master-morality, it is precisely the “good” man who arouses\nfear and seeks to arouse it, while the bad man is regarded as the\ndespicable being. The contrast attains its maximum when, in\naccordance with the logical consequences of slave-morality, a\nshade of depreciation—it may be slight and well-intentioned—at\nlast attaches itself to the “good” man of this morality; because,\naccording to the servile mode of thought, the good man must in\nany case be the SAFE man: he is good-natured, easily deceived,\nperhaps a little stupid, un bonhomme. Everywhere that slave-\nmorality gains the ascendancy, language shows a tendency to\napproximate the significations of the words “good” and “stupid.\"-\n-A last fundamental difference: the desire for FREEDOM, the\ninstinct for happiness and the refinements of the feeling of\nliberty belong as necessarily to slave-morals and morality, as\nartifice and enthusiasm in reverence and devotion are the regular\nsymptoms of an aristocratic mode of thinking and estimating.—\nHence we can understand without further detail why love AS A\nPASSION—it is our European specialty—must absolutely be of\nnoble origin; as is well known, its invention is due to the\nProvencal poet-cavaliers, those brilliant, ingenious men of the\n\"gai saber,” to whom Europe owes so much, and almost owes itself.\n261. Vanity is one of the things which are perhaps most difficult\nfor a noble man to understand: he will be tempted to deny it,\nwhere another kind of man thinks he sees it self-evidently. The\nproblem for him is to represent to his mind beings who seek to\narouse a good opinion of themselves which they themselves do not\npossess—and consequently also do not “deserve,\"—and who yet\nBELIEVE in this good opinion afterwards. This seems to him on the\none hand such bad taste and so self-disrespectful, and on the\nother hand so grotesquely unreasonable, that he would like to\nconsider vanity an exception, and is doubtful about it in most\ncases when it is spoken of. He will say, for instance: “I may be\nmistaken about my value, and on the other hand may nevertheless\ndemand that my value should be acknowledged by others precisely\nas I rate it:—that, however, is not vanity (but self-conceit,\nor, in most cases, that which is called ’humility,’ and also\n’modesty’).” Or he will even say: “For many reasons I can delight\nin the good opinion of others, perhaps because I love and honour\nthem, and rejoice in all their joys, perhaps also because their\ngood opinion endorses and strengthens my belief in my own good\nopinion, perhaps because the good opinion of others, even in\ncases where I do not share it, is useful to me, or gives promise\nof usefulness:—all this, however, is not vanity.” The man of\nnoble character must first bring it home forcibly to his mind,\nespecially with the aid of history, that, from time immemorial,\nin all social strata in any way dependent, the ordinary man WAS\nonly that which he PASSED FOR:—not being at all accustomed to\nfix values, he did not assign even to himself any other value\nthan that which his master assigned to him (it is the peculiar\nRIGHT OF MASTERS to create values). It may be looked upon as the\nresult of an extraordinary atavism, that the ordinary man, even\nat present, is still always WAITING for an opinion about himself,\nand then instinctively submitting himself to it; yet by no means\nonly to a “good” opinion, but also to a bad and unjust one\n(think, for instance, of the greater part of the self-\nappreciations and self-depreciations which believing women learn\nfrom their confessors, and which in general the believing\nChristian learns from his Church). In fact, conformably to the\nslow rise of the democratic social order (and its cause, the\nblending of the blood of masters and slaves), the originally\nnoble and rare impulse of the masters to assign a value to\nthemselves and to “think well” of themselves, will now be more\nand more encouraged and extended; but it has at all times an\nolder, ampler, and more radically ingrained propensity opposed to\nit—and in the phenomenon of “vanity” this older propensity\novermasters the younger. The vain person rejoices over EVERY good\nopinion which he hears about himself (quite apart from the point\nof view of its usefulness, and equally regardless of its truth or\nfalsehood), just as he suffers from every bad opinion: for he\nsubjects himself to both, he feels himself subjected to both, by\nthat oldest instinct of subjection which breaks forth in him.—It\nis “the slave” in the vain man’s blood, the remains of the\nslave’s craftiness—and how much of the “slave” is still left in\nwoman, for instance!—which seeks to SEDUCE to good opinions of\nitself; it is the slave, too, who immediately afterwards falls\nprostrate himself before these opinions, as though he had not\ncalled them forth.—And to repeat it again: vanity is an atavism.\n262. A SPECIES originates, and a type becomes established and\nstrong in the long struggle with essentially constant\nUNFAVOURABLE conditions. On the other hand, it is known by the\nexperience of breeders that species which receive super-abundant\nnourishment, and in general a surplus of protection and care,\nimmediately tend in the most marked way to develop variations,\nand are fertile in prodigies and monstrosities (also in monstrous\nvices). Now look at an aristocratic commonwealth, say an ancient\nGreek polis, or Venice, as a voluntary or involuntary contrivance\nfor the purpose of REARING human beings; there are there men\nbeside one another, thrown upon their own resources, who want to\nmake their species prevail, chiefly because they MUST prevail, or\nelse run the terrible danger of being exterminated. The favour,\nthe super-abundance, the protection are there lacking under which\nvariations are fostered; the species needs itself as species, as\nsomething which, precisely by virtue of its hardness, its\nuniformity, and simplicity of structure, can in general prevail\nand make itself permanent in constant struggle with its\nneighbours, or with rebellious or rebellion-threatening vassals.\nThe most varied experience teaches it what are the qualities to\nwhich it principally owes the fact that it still exists, in spite\nof all Gods and men, and has hitherto been victorious: these\nqualities it calls virtues, and these virtues alone it develops\nto maturity. It does so with severity, indeed it desires\nseverity; every aristocratic morality is intolerant in the\neducation of youth, in the control of women, in the marriage\ncustoms, in the relations of old and young, in the penal laws\n(which have an eye only for the degenerating): it counts\nintolerance itself among the virtues, under the name of\n\"justice.” A type with few, but very marked features, a species\nof severe, warlike, wisely silent, reserved, and reticent men\n(and as such, with the most delicate sensibility for the charm\nand nuances of society) is thus established, unaffected by the\nvicissitudes of generations; the constant struggle with uniform\nUNFAVOURABLE conditions is, as already remarked, the cause of a\ntype becoming stable and hard. Finally, however, a happy state of\nthings results, the enormous tension is relaxed; there are\nperhaps no more enemies among the neighbouring peoples, and the\nmeans of life, even of the enjoyment of life, are present in\nsuperabundance. With one stroke the bond and constraint of the\nold discipline severs: it is no longer regarded as necessary, as\na condition of existence—if it would continue, it can only do so\nas a form of LUXURY, as an archaizing TASTE. Variations, whether\nthey be deviations (into the higher, finer, and rarer), or\ndeteriorations and monstrosities, appear suddenly on the scene in\nthe greatest exuberance and splendour; the individual dares to be\nindividual and detach himself. At this turning-point of history\nthere manifest themselves, side by side, and often mixed and\nentangled together, a magnificent, manifold, virgin-forest-like\nup-growth and up-striving, a kind of TROPICAL TEMPO in the\nrivalry of growth, and an extraordinary decay and self-\ndestruction, owing to the savagely opposing and seemingly\nexploding egoisms, which strive with one another “for sun and\nlight,” and can no longer assign any limit, restraint, or\nforbearance for themselves by means of the hitherto existing\nmorality. It was this morality itself which piled up the strength\nso enormously, which bent the bow in so threatening a manner:—it\nis now “out of date,” it is getting “out of date.” The dangerous\nand disquieting point has been reached when the greater, more\nmanifold, more comprehensive life IS LIVED BEYOND the old\nmorality; the “individual” stands out, and is obliged to have\nrecourse to his own law-giving, his own arts and artifices for\nself-preservation, self-elevation, and self-deliverance. Nothing\nbut new “Whys,” nothing but new “Hows,” no common formulas any\nlonger, misunderstanding and disregard in league with each other,\ndecay, deterioration, and the loftiest desires frightfully\nentangled, the genius of the race overflowing from all the\ncornucopias of good and bad, a portentous simultaneousness of\nSpring and Autumn, full of new charms and mysteries peculiar to\nthe fresh, still inexhausted, still unwearied corruption. Danger\nis again present, the mother of morality, great danger; this time\nshifted into the individual, into the neighbour and friend, into\nthe street, into their own child, into their own heart, into all\nthe most personal and secret recesses of their desires and\nvolitions. What will the moral philosophers who appear at this\ntime have to preach? They discover, these sharp onlookers and\nloafers, that the end is quickly approaching, that everything\naround them decays and produces decay, that nothing will endure\nuntil the day after tomorrow, except one species of man, the\nincurably MEDIOCRE. The mediocre alone have a prospect of\ncontinuing and propagating themselves—they will be the men of\nthe future, the sole survivors; “be like them! become mediocre!\"\nis now the only morality which has still a significance, which\nstill obtains a hearing.—But it is difficult to preach this\nmorality of mediocrity! it can never avow what it is and what it\ndesires! it has to talk of moderation and dignity and duty and\nbrotherly love—it will have difficulty IN CONCEALING ITS IRONY!\n263. There is an INSTINCT FOR RANK, which more than anything else\nis already the sign of a HIGH rank; there is a DELIGHT in the\nNUANCES of reverence which leads one to infer noble origin and\nhabits. The refinement, goodness, and loftiness of a soul are put\nto a perilous test when something passes by that is of the\nhighest rank, but is not yet protected by the awe of authority\nfrom obtrusive touches and incivilities: something that goes its\nway like a living touchstone, undistinguished, undiscovered, and\ntentative, perhaps voluntarily veiled and disguised. He whose\ntask and practice it is to investigate souls, will avail himself\nof many varieties of this very art to determine the ultimate\nvalue of a soul, the unalterable, innate order of rank to which\nit belongs: he will test it by its INSTINCT FOR REVERENCE.\nDIFFERENCE ENGENDRE HAINE: the vulgarity of many a nature spurts\nup suddenly like dirty water, when any holy vessel, any jewel\nfrom closed shrines, any book bearing the marks of great destiny,\nis brought before it; while on the other hand, there is an\ninvoluntary silence, a hesitation of the eye, a cessation of all\ngestures, by which it is indicated that a soul FEELS the nearness\nof what is worthiest of respect. The way in which, on the whole,\nthe reverence for the BIBLE has hitherto been maintained in\nEurope, is perhaps the best example of discipline and refinement\nof manners which Europe owes to Christianity: books of such\nprofoundness and supreme significance require for their\nprotection an external tyranny of authority, in order to acquire\nthe PERIOD of thousands of years which is necessary to exhaust\nand unriddle them. Much has been achieved when the sentiment has\nbeen at last instilled into the masses (the shallow-pates and the\nboobies of every kind) that they are not allowed to touch\neverything, that there are holy experiences before which they\nmust take off their shoes and keep away the unclean hand—it is\nalmost their highest advance towards humanity. On the contrary,\nin the so-called cultured classes, the believers in “modern\nideas,” nothing is perhaps so repulsive as their lack of shame,\nthe easy insolence of eye and hand with which they touch, taste,\nand finger everything; and it is possible that even yet there is\nmore RELATIVE nobility of taste, and more tact for reverence\namong the people, among the lower classes of the people,\nespecially among peasants, than among the newspaper-reading\nDEMIMONDE of intellect, the cultured class.\n264. It cannot be effaced from a man’s soul what his ancestors\nhave preferably and most constantly done: whether they were\nperhaps diligent economizers attached to a desk and a cash-box,\nmodest and citizen-like in their desires, modest also in their\nvirtues; or whether they were accustomed to commanding from\nmorning till night, fond of rude pleasures and probably of still\nruder duties and responsibilities; or whether, finally, at one\ntime or another, they have sacrificed old privileges of birth and\npossession, in order to live wholly for their faith—for their\n\"God,\"—as men of an inexorable and sensitive conscience, which\nblushes at every compromise. It is quite impossible for a man NOT\nto have the qualities and predilections of his parents and\nancestors in his constitution, whatever appearances may suggest\nto the contrary. This is the problem of race. Granted that one\nknows something of the parents, it is admissible to draw a\nconclusion about the child: any kind of offensive incontinence,\nany kind of sordid envy, or of clumsy self-vaunting—the three\nthings which together have constituted the genuine plebeian type\nin all times—such must pass over to the child, as surely as bad\nblood; and with the help of the best education and culture one\nwill only succeed in DECEIVING with regard to such heredity.—And\nwhat else does education and culture try to do nowadays! In our\nvery democratic, or rather, very plebeian age, “education” and\n\"culture” MUST be essentially the art of deceiving—deceiving\nwith regard to origin, with regard to the inherited plebeianism\nin body and soul. An educator who nowadays preached truthfulness\nabove everything else, and called out constantly to his pupils:\n\"Be true! Be natural! Show yourselves as you are!\"—even such a\nvirtuous and sincere ass would learn in a short time to have\nrecourse to the FURCA of Horace, NATURAM EXPELLERE: with what\nresults? “Plebeianism” USQUE RECURRET. [FOOTNOTE: Horace’s\n\"Epistles,” I. x. 24.]\n265. At the risk of displeasing innocent ears, I submit that\negoism belongs to the essence of a noble soul, I mean the\nunalterable belief that to a being such as “we,” other beings\nmust naturally be in subjection, and have to sacrifice\nthemselves. The noble soul accepts the fact of his egoism without\nquestion, and also without consciousness of harshness,\nconstraint, or arbitrariness therein, but rather as something\nthat may have its basis in the primary law of things:—if he\nsought a designation for it he would say: “It is justice itself.\"\nHe acknowledges under certain circumstances, which made him\nhesitate at first, that there are other equally privileged ones;\nas soon as he has settled this question of rank, he moves among\nthose equals and equally privileged ones with the same assurance,\nas regards modesty and delicate respect, which he enjoys in\nintercourse with himself—in accordance with an innate heavenly\nmechanism which all the stars understand. It is an ADDITIONAL\ninstance of his egoism, this artfulness and self-limitation in\nintercourse with his equals—every star is a similar egoist; he\nhonours HIMSELF in them, and in the rights which he concedes to\nthem, he has no doubt that the exchange of honours and rights, as\nthe ESSENCE of all intercourse, belongs also to the natural\ncondition of things. The noble soul gives as he takes, prompted\nby the passionate and sensitive instinct of requital, which is at\nthe root of his nature. The notion of “favour” has, INTER PARES,\nneither significance nor good repute; there may be a sublime way\nof letting gifts as it were light upon one from above, and of\ndrinking them thirstily like dew-drops; but for those arts and\ndisplays the noble soul has no aptitude. His egoism hinders him\nhere: in general, he looks “aloft” unwillingly—he looks either\nFORWARD, horizontally and deliberately, or downwards—HE KNOWS\nTHAT HE IS ON A HEIGHT.\n266. “One can only truly esteem him who does not LOOK OUT FOR\nhimself.\"—Goethe to Rath Schlosser.\n267. The Chinese have a proverb which mothers even teach their\nchildren: “SIAO-SIN” (\"MAKE THY HEART SMALL”). This is the\nessentially fundamental tendency in latter-day civilizations. I\nhave no doubt that an ancient Greek, also, would first of all\nremark the self-dwarfing in us Europeans of today—in this\nrespect alone we should immediately be “distasteful” to him.\n268. What, after all, is ignobleness?—Words are vocal symbols\nfor ideas; ideas, however, are more or less definite mental\nsymbols for frequently returning and concurring sensations, for\ngroups of sensations. It is not sufficient to use the same words\nin order to understand one another: we must also employ the same\nwords for the same kind of internal experiences, we must in the\nend have experiences IN COMMON. On this account the people of one\nnation understand one another better than those belonging to\ndifferent nations, even when they use the same language; or\nrather, when people have lived long together under similar\nconditions (of climate, soil, danger, requirement, toil) there\nORIGINATES therefrom an entity that “understands itself\"—namely,\na nation. In all souls a like number of frequently recurring\nexperiences have gained the upper hand over those occurring more\nrarely: about these matters people understand one another rapidly\nand always more rapidly—the history of language is the history\nof a process of abbreviation; on the basis of this quick\ncomprehension people always unite closer and closer. The greater\nthe danger, the greater is the need of agreeing quickly and\nreadily about what is necessary; not to misunderstand one another\nin danger—that is what cannot at all be dispensed with in\nintercourse. Also in all loves and friendships one has the\nexperience that nothing of the kind continues when the discovery\nhas been made that in using the same words, one of the two\nparties has feelings, thoughts, intuitions, wishes, or fears\ndifferent from those of the other. (The fear of the “eternal\nmisunderstanding”: that is the good genius which so often keeps\npersons of different sexes from too hasty attachments, to which\nsense and heart prompt them—and NOT some Schopenhauerian “genius\nof the species”!) Whichever groups of sensations within a soul\nawaken most readily, begin to speak, and give the word of\ncommand—these decide as to the general order of rank of its\nvalues, and determine ultimately its list of desirable things. A\nman’s estimates of value betray something of the STRUCTURE of his\nsoul, and wherein it sees its conditions of life, its intrinsic\nneeds. Supposing now that necessity has from all time drawn\ntogether only such men as could express similar requirements and\nsimilar experiences by similar symbols, it results on the whole\nthat the easy COMMUNICABILITY of need, which implies ultimately\nthe undergoing only of average and COMMON experiences, must have\nbeen the most potent of all the forces which have hitherto\noperated upon mankind. The more similar, the more ordinary\npeople, have always had and are still having the advantage; the\nmore select, more refined, more unique, and difficultly\ncomprehensible, are liable to stand alone; they succumb to\naccidents in their isolation, and seldom propagate themselves.\nOne must appeal to immense opposing forces, in order to thwart\nthis natural, all-too-natural PROGRESSUS IN SIMILE, the evolution\nof man to the similar, the ordinary, the average, the gregarious\n—to the IGNOBLE!—\n269. The more a psychologist—a born, an unavoidable psychologist\nand soul-diviner—turns his attention to the more select cases\nand individuals, the greater is his danger of being suffocated by\nsympathy: he NEEDS sternness and cheerfulness more than any other\nman. For the corruption, the ruination of higher men, of the more\nunusually constituted souls, is in fact, the rule: it is dreadful\nto have such a rule always before one’s eyes. The manifold\ntorment of the psychologist who has discovered this ruination,\nwho discovers once, and then discovers ALMOST repeatedly\nthroughout all history, this universal inner “desperateness” of\nhigher men, this eternal “too late!” in every sense—may perhaps\none day be the cause of his turning with bitterness against his\nown lot, and of his making an attempt at self-destruction—of his\n\"going to ruin” himself. One may perceive in almost every\npsychologist a tell-tale inclination for delightful intercourse\nwith commonplace and well-ordered men; the fact is thereby\ndisclosed that he always requires healing, that he needs a sort\nof flight and forgetfulness, away from what his insight and\nincisiveness—from what his “business\"—has laid upon his\nconscience. The fear of his memory is peculiar to him. He is\neasily silenced by the judgment of others; he hears with unmoved\ncountenance how people honour, admire, love, and glorify, where\nhe has PERCEIVED—or he even conceals his silence by expressly\nassenting to some plausible opinion. Perhaps the paradox of his\nsituation becomes so dreadful that, precisely where he has learnt\nGREAT SYMPATHY, together with great CONTEMPT, the multitude, the\neducated, and the visionaries, have on their part learnt great\nreverence—reverence for “great men” and marvelous animals, for\nthe sake of whom one blesses and honours the fatherland, the\nearth, the dignity of mankind, and one’s own self, to whom one\npoints the young, and in view of whom one educates them. And who\nknows but in all great instances hitherto just the same happened:\nthat the multitude worshipped a God, and that the “God” was only\na poor sacrificial animal! SUCCESS has always been the greatest\nliar—and the “work” itself is a success; the great statesman,\nthe conqueror, the discoverer, are disguised in their creations\nuntil they are unrecognizable; the “work” of the artist, of the\nphilosopher, only invents him who has created it, is REPUTED to\nhave created it; the “great men,” as they are reverenced, are\npoor little fictions composed afterwards; in the world of\nhistorical values spurious coinage PREVAILS. Those great poets,\nfor example, such as Byron, Musset, Poe, Leopardi, Kleist, Gogol\n(I do not venture to mention much greater names, but I have them\nin my mind), as they now appear, and were perhaps obliged to be:\nmen of the moment, enthusiastic, sensuous, and childish, light-\nminded and impulsive in their trust and distrust; with souls in\nwhich usually some flaw has to be concealed; often taking revenge\nwith their works for an internal defilement, often seeking\nforgetfulness in their soaring from a too true memory, often lost\nin the mud and almost in love with it, until they become like the\nWill-o’-the-Wisps around the swamps, and PRETEND TO BE stars—the\npeople then call them idealists,—often struggling with\nprotracted disgust, with an ever-reappearing phantom of\ndisbelief, which makes them cold, and obliges them to languish\nfor GLORIA and devour “faith as it is” out of the hands of\nintoxicated adulators:—what a TORMENT these great artists are\nand the so-called higher men in general, to him who has once\nfound them out! It is thus conceivable that it is just from\nwoman—who is clairvoyant in the world of suffering, and also\nunfortunately eager to help and save to an extent far beyond her\npowers—that THEY have learnt so readily those outbreaks of\nboundless devoted SYMPATHY, which the multitude, above all the\nreverent multitude, do not understand, and overwhelm with prying\nand self-gratifying interpretations. This sympathizing invariably\ndeceives itself as to its power; woman would like to believe that\nlove can do EVERYTHING—it is the SUPERSTITION peculiar to her.\nAlas, he who knows the heart finds out how poor, helpless,\npretentious, and blundering even the best and deepest love is—he\nfinds that it rather DESTROYS than saves!—It is possible that\nunder the holy fable and travesty of the life of Jesus there is\nhidden one of the most painful cases of the martyrdom of\nKNOWLEDGE ABOUT LOVE: the martyrdom of the most innocent and most\ncraving heart, that never had enough of any human love, that\nDEMANDED love, that demanded inexorably and frantically to be\nloved and nothing else, with terrible outbursts against those who\nrefused him their love; the story of a poor soul insatiated and\ninsatiable in love, that had to invent hell to send thither those\nwho WOULD NOT love him—and that at last, enlightened about human\nlove, had to invent a God who is entire love, entire CAPACITY for\nlove—who takes pity on human love, because it is so paltry, so\nignorant! He who has such sentiments, he who has such KNOWLEDGE\nabout love—SEEKS for death!—But why should one deal with such\npainful matters? Provided, of course, that one is not obliged to\ndo so.\n270. The intellectual haughtiness and loathing of every man who\nhas suffered deeply—it almost determines the order of rank HOW\ndeeply men can suffer—the chilling certainty, with which he is\nthoroughly imbued and coloured, that by virtue of his suffering\nhe KNOWS MORE than the shrewdest and wisest can ever know, that\nhe has been familiar with, and “at home” in, many distant,\ndreadful worlds of which “YOU know nothing”!—this silent\nintellectual haughtiness of the sufferer, this pride of the elect\nof knowledge, of the “initiated,” of the almost sacrificed, finds\nall forms of disguise necessary to protect itself from contact\nwith officious and sympathizing hands, and in general from all\nthat is not its equal in suffering. Profound suffering makes\nnoble: it separates.—One of the most refined forms of disguise\nis Epicurism, along with a certain ostentatious boldness of\ntaste, which takes suffering lightly, and puts itself on the\ndefensive against all that is sorrowful and profound. They are\n\"gay men” who make use of gaiety, because they are misunderstood\non account of it—they WISH to be misunderstood. There are\n\"scientific minds” who make use of science, because it gives a\ngay appearance, and because scientificness leads to the\nconclusion that a person is superficial—they WISH to mislead to\na false conclusion. There are free insolent minds which would\nfain conceal and deny that they are broken, proud, incurable\nhearts (the cynicism of Hamlet—the case of Galiani); and\noccasionally folly itself is the mask of an unfortunate OVER-\nASSURED knowledge.—From which it follows that it is the part of\na more refined humanity to have reverence “for the mask,” and not\nto make use of psychology and curiosity in the wrong place.\n271. That which separates two men most profoundly is a different\nsense and grade of purity. What does it matter about all their\nhonesty and reciprocal usefulness, what does it matter about all\ntheir mutual good-will: the fact still remains—they “cannot\nsmell each other!” The highest instinct for purity places him who\nis affected with it in the most extraordinary and dangerous\nisolation, as a saint: for it is just holiness—the highest\nspiritualization of the instinct in question. Any kind of\ncognizance of an indescribable excess in the joy of the bath, any\nkind of ardour or thirst which perpetually impels the soul out of\nnight into the morning, and out of gloom, out of “affliction\"\ninto clearness, brightness, depth, and refinement:—just as much\nas such a tendency DISTINGUISHES—it is a noble tendency—it also\nSEPARATES.—The pity of the saint is pity for the FILTH of the\nhuman, all-too-human. And there are grades and heights where pity\nitself is regarded by him as impurity, as filth.\n272. Signs of nobility: never to think of lowering our duties to\nthe rank of duties for everybody; to be unwilling to renounce or\nto share our responsibilities; to count our prerogatives, and the\nexercise of them, among our DUTIES.\n273. A man who strives after great things, looks upon every one\nwhom he encounters on his way either as a means of advance, or a\ndelay and hindrance—or as a temporary resting-place. His\npeculiar lofty BOUNTY to his fellow-men is only possible when he\nattains his elevation and dominates. Impatience, and the\nconsciousness of being always condemned to comedy up to that\ntime—for even strife is a comedy, and conceals the end, as every\nmeans does—spoil all intercourse for him; this kind of man is\nacquainted with solitude, and what is most poisonous in it.\n274. THE PROBLEM OF THOSE WHO WAIT.—Happy chances are necessary,\nand many incalculable elements, in order that a higher man in\nwhom the solution of a problem is dormant, may yet take action,\nor “break forth,” as one might say—at the right moment. On an\naverage it DOES NOT happen; and in all corners of the earth there\nare waiting ones sitting who hardly know to what extent they are\nwaiting, and still less that they wait in vain. Occasionally,\ntoo, the waking call comes too late—the chance which gives\n\"permission” to take action—when their best youth, and strength\nfor action have been used up in sitting still; and how many a\none, just as he “sprang up,” has found with horror that his limbs\nare benumbed and his spirits are now too heavy! “It is too late,\"\nhe has said to himself—and has become self-distrustful and\nhenceforth for ever useless.—In the domain of genius, may not\nthe “Raphael without hands” (taking the expression in its widest\nsense) perhaps not be the exception, but the rule?—Perhaps\ngenius is by no means so rare: but rather the five hundred HANDS\nwhich it requires in order to tyrannize over the [GREEK INSERTED\nHERE], “the right time\"—in order to take chance by the forelock!\n275. He who does not WISH to see the height of a man, looks all\nthe more sharply at what is low in him, and in the foreground—\nand thereby betrays himself.\n276. In all kinds of injury and loss the lower and coarser soul\nis better off than the nobler soul: the dangers of the latter\nmust be greater, the probability that it will come to grief and\nperish is in fact immense, considering the multiplicity of the\nconditions of its existence.—In a lizard a finger grows again\nwhich has been lost; not so in man.—\n277. It is too bad! Always the old story! When a man has finished\nbuilding his house, he finds that he has learnt unawares\nsomething which he OUGHT absolutely to have known before he—\nbegan to build. The eternal, fatal “Too late!” The melancholia of\neverything COMPLETED!—\n278.—Wanderer, who art thou? I see thee follow thy path without\nscorn, without love, with unfathomable eyes, wet and sad as a\nplummet which has returned to the light insatiated out of every\ndepth—what did it seek down there?—with a bosom that never\nsighs, with lips that conceal their loathing, with a hand which\nonly slowly grasps: who art thou? what hast thou done? Rest thee\nhere: this place has hospitality for every one—refresh thyself!\nAnd whoever thou art, what is it that now pleases thee? What will\nserve to refresh thee? Only name it, whatever I have I offer\nthee! “To refresh me? To refresh me? Oh, thou prying one, what\nsayest thou! But give me, I pray thee—-” What? what? Speak out!\n\"Another mask! A second mask!”\n279. Men of profound sadness betray themselves when they are\nhappy: they have a mode of seizing upon happiness as though they\nwould choke and strangle it, out of jealousy—ah, they know only\ntoo well that it will flee from them!\n280. “Bad! Bad! What? Does he not—go back?” Yes! But you\nmisunderstand him when you complain about it. He goes back like\nevery one who is about to make a great spring.\n281.—\"Will people believe it of me? But I insist that they\nbelieve it of me: I have always thought very unsatisfactorily of\nmyself and about myself, only in very rare cases, only\ncompulsorily, always without delight in ’the subject,’ ready to\ndigress from ’myself,’ and always without faith in the result,\nowing to an unconquerable distrust of the POSSIBILITY of self-\nknowledge, which has led me so far as to feel a CONTRADICTIO IN\nADJECTO even in the idea of ’direct knowledge’ which theorists\nallow themselves:—this matter of fact is almost the most certain\nthing I know about myself. There must be a sort of repugnance in\nme to BELIEVE anything definite about myself.—Is there perhaps\nsome enigma therein? Probably; but fortunately nothing for my own\nteeth.—Perhaps it betrays the species to which I belong?—but\nnot to myself, as is sufficiently agreeable to me.”\n282.—\"But what has happened to you?\"—\"I do not know,” he said,\nhesitatingly; “perhaps the Harpies have flown over my table.\"—It\nsometimes happens nowadays that a gentle, sober, retiring man\nbecomes suddenly mad, breaks the plates, upsets the table,\nshrieks, raves, and shocks everybody—and finally withdraws,\nashamed, and raging at himself—whither? for what purpose? To\nfamish apart? To suffocate with his memories?—To him who has the\ndesires of a lofty and dainty soul, and only seldom finds his\ntable laid and his food prepared, the danger will always be\ngreat—nowadays, however, it is extraordinarily so. Thrown into\nthe midst of a noisy and plebeian age, with which he does not\nlike to eat out of the same dish, he may readily perish of hunger\nand thirst—or, should he nevertheless finally “fall to,” of\nsudden nausea.—We have probably all sat at tables to which we\ndid not belong; and precisely the most spiritual of us, who are\nmost difficult to nourish, know the dangerous DYSPEPSIA which\noriginates from a sudden insight and disillusionment about our\nfood and our messmates—the AFTER-DINNER NAUSEA.\n283. If one wishes to praise at all, it is a delicate and at the\nsame time a noble self-control, to praise only where one DOES NOT\nagree—otherwise in fact one would praise oneself, which is\ncontrary to good taste:—a self-control, to be sure, which offers\nexcellent opportunity and provocation to constant\nMISUNDERSTANDING. To be able to allow oneself this veritable\nluxury of taste and morality, one must not live among\nintellectual imbeciles, but rather among men whose\nmisunderstandings and mistakes amuse by their refinement—or one\nwill have to pay dearly for it!—\"He praises me, THEREFORE he\nacknowledges me to be right\"—this asinine method of inference\nspoils half of the life of us recluses, for it brings the asses\ninto our neighbourhood and friendship.\n284. To live in a vast and proud tranquility; always beyond . . .\nTo have, or not to have, one’s emotions, one’s For and Against,\naccording to choice; to lower oneself to them for hours; to SEAT\noneself on them as upon horses, and often as upon asses:—for one\nmust know how to make use of their stupidity as well as of their\nfire. To conserve one’s three hundred foregrounds; also one’s\nblack spectacles: for there are circumstances when nobody must\nlook into our eyes, still less into our “motives.” And to choose\nfor company that roguish and cheerful vice, politeness. And to\nremain master of one’s four virtues, courage, insight, sympathy,\nand solitude. For solitude is a virtue with us, as a sublime bent\nand bias to purity, which divines that in the contact of man and\nman—\"in society\"—it must be unavoidably impure. All society\nmakes one somehow, somewhere, or sometime—\"commonplace.”\n285. The greatest events and thoughts—the greatest thoughts,\nhowever, are the greatest events—are longest in being\ncomprehended: the generations which are contemporary with them do\nnot EXPERIENCE such events—they live past them. Something\nhappens there as in the realm of stars. The light of the furthest\nstars is longest in reaching man; and before it has arrived man\nDENIES—that there are stars there. “How many centuries does a\nmind require to be understood?\"—that is also a standard, one\nalso makes a gradation of rank and an etiquette therewith, such\nas is necessary for mind and for star.\n286. “Here is the prospect free, the mind exalted.” [FOOTNOTE:\nGoethe’s “Faust,” Part II, Act V. The words of Dr. Marianus.]—\nBut there is a reverse kind of man, who is also upon a height,\nand has also a free prospect—but looks DOWNWARDS.\n287. What is noble? What does the word “noble” still mean for us\nnowadays? How does the noble man betray himself, how is he\nrecognized under this heavy overcast sky of the commencing\nplebeianism, by which everything is rendered opaque and leaden?—\nIt is not his actions which establish his claim—actions are\nalways ambiguous, always inscrutable; neither is it his “works.\"\nOne finds nowadays among artists and scholars plenty of those who\nbetray by their works that a profound longing for nobleness\nimpels them; but this very NEED of nobleness is radically\ndifferent from the needs of the noble soul itself, and is in fact\nthe eloquent and dangerous sign of the lack thereof. It is not\nthe works, but the BELIEF which is here decisive and determines\nthe order of rank—to employ once more an old religious formula\nwith a new and deeper meaning—it is some fundamental certainty\nwhich a noble soul has about itself, something which is not to be\nsought, is not to be found, and perhaps, also, is not to be\nlost.—THE NOBLE SOUL HAS REVERENCE FOR ITSELF.—\n288. There are men who are unavoidably intellectual, let them\nturn and twist themselves as they will, and hold their hands\nbefore their treacherous eyes—as though the hand were not a\nbetrayer; it always comes out at last that they have something\nwhich they hide—namely, intellect. One of the subtlest means of\ndeceiving, at least as long as possible, and of successfully\nrepresenting oneself to be stupider than one really is—which in\neveryday life is often as desirable as an umbrella,—is called\nENTHUSIASM, including what belongs to it, for instance, virtue.\nFor as Galiani said, who was obliged to know it: VERTU EST\nENTHOUSIASME.\n289. In the writings of a recluse one always hears something of\nthe echo of the wilderness, something of the murmuring tones and\ntimid vigilance of solitude; in his strongest words, even in his\ncry itself, there sounds a new and more dangerous kind of\nsilence, of concealment. He who has sat day and night, from\nyear’s end to year’s end, alone with his soul in familiar discord\nand discourse, he who has become a cave-bear, or a treasure-\nseeker, or a treasure-guardian and dragon in his cave—it may be\na labyrinth, but can also be a gold-mine—his ideas themselves\neventually acquire a twilight-colour of their own, and an odour,\nas much of the depth as of the mould, something uncommunicative\nand repulsive, which blows chilly upon every passerby. The\nrecluse does not believe that a philosopher—supposing that a\nphilosopher has always in the first place been a recluse—ever\nexpressed his actual and ultimate opinions in books: are not\nbooks written precisely to hide what is in us?—indeed, he will\ndoubt whether a philosopher CAN have “ultimate and actual\"\nopinions at all; whether behind every cave in him there is not,\nand must necessarily be, a still deeper cave: an ampler,\nstranger, richer world beyond the surface, an abyss behind every\nbottom, beneath every “foundation.” Every philosophy is a\nforeground philosophy—this is a recluse’s verdict: “There is\nsomething arbitrary in the fact that the PHILOSOPHER came to a\nstand here, took a retrospect, and looked around; that he HERE\nlaid his spade aside and did not dig any deeper—there is also\nsomething suspicious in it.” Every philosophy also CONCEALS a\nphilosophy; every opinion is also a LURKING-PLACE, every word is\nalso a MASK.\n290. Every deep thinker is more afraid of being understood than\nof being misunderstood. The latter perhaps wounds his vanity; but\nthe former wounds his heart, his sympathy, which always says:\n\"Ah, why would you also have as hard a time of it as I have?”\n291. Man, a COMPLEX, mendacious, artful, and inscrutable animal,\nuncanny to the other animals by his artifice and sagacity, rather\nthan by his strength, has invented the good conscience in order\nfinally to enjoy his soul as something SIMPLE; and the whole of\nmorality is a long, audacious falsification, by virtue of which\ngenerally enjoyment at the sight of the soul becomes possible.\nFrom this point of view there is perhaps much more in the\nconception of “art” than is generally believed.\n292. A philosopher: that is a man who constantly experiences,\nsees, hears, suspects, hopes, and dreams extraordinary things;\nwho is struck by his own thoughts as if they came from the\noutside, from above and below, as a species of events and\nlightning-flashes PECULIAR TO HIM; who is perhaps himself a storm\npregnant with new lightnings; a portentous man, around whom there\nis always rumbling and mumbling and gaping and something uncanny\ngoing on. A philosopher: alas, a being who often runs away from\nhimself, is often afraid of himself—but whose curiosity always\nmakes him “come to himself” again.\n293. A man who says: “I like that, I take it for my own, and mean\nto guard and protect it from every one\"; a man who can conduct a\ncase, carry out a resolution, remain true to an opinion, keep\nhold of a woman, punish and overthrow insolence; a man who has\nhis indignation and his sword, and to whom the weak, the\nsuffering, the oppressed, and even the animals willingly submit\nand naturally belong; in short, a man who is a MASTER by nature—\nwhen such a man has sympathy, well! THAT sympathy has value! But\nof what account is the sympathy of those who suffer! Or of those\neven who preach sympathy! There is nowadays, throughout almost\nthe whole of Europe, a sickly irritability and sensitiveness\ntowards pain, and also a repulsive irrestrainableness in\ncomplaining, an effeminizing, which, with the aid of religion and\nphilosophical nonsense, seeks to deck itself out as something\nsuperior—there is a regular cult of suffering. The UNMANLINESS\nof that which is called “sympathy” by such groups of visionaries,\nis always, I believe, the first thing that strikes the eye.—One\nmust resolutely and radically taboo this latest form of bad\ntaste; and finally I wish people to put the good amulet, “GAI\nSABER” (\"gay science,” in ordinary language), on heart and neck,\nas a protection against it.\n294. THE OLYMPIAN VICE.—Despite the philosopher who, as a\ngenuine Englishman, tried to bring laughter into bad repute in\nall thinking minds—\"Laughing is a bad infirmity of human nature,\nwhich every thinking mind will strive to overcome” (Hobbes),—I\nwould even allow myself to rank philosophers according to the\nquality of their laughing—up to those who are capable of GOLDEN\nlaughter. And supposing that Gods also philosophize, which I am\nstrongly inclined to believe, owing to many reasons—I have no\ndoubt that they also know how to laugh thereby in an overman-like\nand new fashion—and at the expense of all serious things! Gods\nare fond of ridicule: it seems that they cannot refrain from\nlaughter even in holy matters.\n295. The genius of the heart, as that great mysterious one\npossesses it, the tempter-god and born rat-catcher of\nconsciences, whose voice can descend into the nether-world of\nevery soul, who neither speaks a word nor casts a glance in which\nthere may not be some motive or touch of allurement, to whose\nperfection it pertains that he knows how to appear,—not as he\nis, but in a guise which acts as an ADDITIONAL constraint on his\nfollowers to press ever closer to him, to follow him more\ncordially and thoroughly;—the genius of the heart, which imposes\nsilence and attention on everything loud and self-conceited,\nwhich smoothes rough souls and makes them taste a new longing—to\nlie placid as a mirror, that the deep heavens may be reflected in\nthem;—the genius of the heart, which teaches the clumsy and too\nhasty hand to hesitate, and to grasp more delicately; which\nscents the hidden and forgotten treasure, the drop of goodness\nand sweet spirituality under thick dark ice, and is a divining-\nrod for every grain of gold, long buried and imprisoned in mud\nand sand; the genius of the heart, from contact with which every\none goes away richer; not favoured or surprised, not as though\ngratified and oppressed by the good things of others; but richer\nin himself, newer than before, broken up, blown upon, and sounded\nby a thawing wind; more uncertain, perhaps, more delicate, more\nfragile, more bruised, but full of hopes which as yet lack names,\nfull of a new will and current, full of a new ill-will and\ncounter-current . . . but what am I doing, my friends? Of whom am\nI talking to you? Have I forgotten myself so far that I have not\neven told you his name? Unless it be that you have already\ndivined of your own accord who this questionable God and spirit\nis, that wishes to be PRAISED in such a manner? For, as it\nhappens to every one who from childhood onward has always been on\nhis legs, and in foreign lands, I have also encountered on my\npath many strange and dangerous spirits; above all, however, and\nagain and again, the one of whom I have just spoken: in fact, no\nless a personage than the God DIONYSUS, the great equivocator and\ntempter, to whom, as you know, I once offered in all secrecy and\nreverence my first-fruits—the last, as it seems to me, who has\noffered a SACRIFICE to him, for I have found no one who could\nunderstand what I was then doing. In the meantime, however, I\nhave learned much, far too much, about the philosophy of this\nGod, and, as I said, from mouth to mouth—I, the last disciple\nand initiate of the God Dionysus: and perhaps I might at last\nbegin to give you, my friends, as far as I am allowed, a little\ntaste of this philosophy? In a hushed voice, as is but seemly:\nfor it has to do with much that is secret, new, strange,\nwonderful, and uncanny. The very fact that Dionysus is a\nphilosopher, and that therefore Gods also philosophize, seems to\nme a novelty which is not unensnaring, and might perhaps arouse\nsuspicion precisely among philosophers;—among you, my friends,\nthere is less to be said against it, except that it comes too\nlate and not at the right time; for, as it has been disclosed to\nme, you are loth nowadays to believe in God and gods. It may\nhappen, too, that in the frankness of my story I must go further\nthan is agreeable to the strict usages of your ears? Certainly\nthe God in question went further, very much further, in such\ndialogues, and was always many paces ahead of me . . . Indeed, if\nit were allowed, I should have to give him, according to human\nusage, fine ceremonious tides of lustre and merit, I should have\nto extol his courage as investigator and discoverer, his fearless\nhonesty, truthfulness, and love of wisdom. But such a God does\nnot know what to do with all that respectable trumpery and pomp.\n\"Keep that,” he would say, “for thyself and those like thee, and\nwhoever else require it! I—have no reason to cover my\nnakedness!” One suspects that this kind of divinity and\nphilosopher perhaps lacks shame?—He once said: “Under certain\ncircumstances I love mankind\"—and referred thereby to Ariadne,\nwho was present; “in my opinion man is an agreeable, brave,\ninventive animal, that has not his equal upon earth, he makes his\nway even through all labyrinths. I like man, and often think how\nI can still further advance him, and make him stronger, more\nevil, and more profound.\"—\"Stronger, more evil, and more\nprofound?” I asked in horror. “Yes,” he said again, “stronger,\nmore evil, and more profound; also more beautiful\"—and thereby\nthe tempter-god smiled with his halcyon smile, as though he had\njust paid some charming compliment. One here sees at once that it\nis not only shame that this divinity lacks;—and in general there\nare good grounds for supposing that in some things the Gods could\nall of them come to us men for instruction. We men are—more\nhuman.—\n296. Alas! what are you, after all, my written and painted\nthoughts! Not long ago you were so variegated, young and\nmalicious, so full of thorns and secret spices, that you made me\nsneeze and laugh—and now? You have already doffed your novelty,\nand some of you, I fear, are ready to become truths, so immortal\ndo they look, so pathetically honest, so tedious! And was it ever\notherwise? What then do we write and paint, we mandarins with\nChinese brush, we immortalisers of things which LEND themselves\nto writing, what are we alone capable of painting? Alas, only\nthat which is just about to fade and begins to lose its odour!\nAlas, only exhausted and departing storms and belated yellow\nsentiments! Alas, only birds strayed and fatigued by flight,\nwhich now let themselves be captured with the hand—with OUR\nhand! We immortalize what cannot live and fly much longer, things\nonly which are exhausted and mellow! And it is only for your\nAFTERNOON, you, my written and painted thoughts, for which alone\nI have colours, many colours, perhaps, many variegated\nsoftenings, and fifty yellows and browns and greens and reds;—\nbut nobody will divine thereby how ye looked in your morning, you\nsudden sparks and marvels of my solitude, you, my old, beloved—\nEVIL thoughts!\nFrom the Heights\nBy F W Nietzsche, Translated by L A Magnus\n\n                  1.\n\nMIDDAY of Life!

        "SUPPOSING that Truth is a woman—what then? Is there not ground\nfor suspecting that all philosophers, in so far as they have been\ndogmatists, have failed to understand women—that the terrible\nseriousness and clumsy importunity with which they have usually\npaid their addresses to Truth, have been unskilled and unseemly\nmethods for winning a woman? Certainly she has never allowed\nherself to be won; and at present every kind of dogma stands with\nsad and discouraged mien—IF, indeed, it stands at all! For there\nare scoffers who maintain that it has fallen, that all dogma lies\non the ground—nay more, that it is at its last gasp. But to\nspeak seriously, there are good grounds for hoping that all\ndogmatizing in philosophy, whatever solemn, whatever conclusive\nand decided airs it has assumed, may have been only a noble\npuerilism and tyronism; and probably the time is at hand when it\nwill be once and again understood WHAT has actually sufficed for\nthe basis of such imposing and absolute philosophical edifices as\nthe dogmatists have hitherto reared: perhaps some popular\nsuperstition of immemorial time (such as the soul-superstition,\nwhich, in the form of subject- and ego-superstition, has not yet\nceased doing mischief): perhaps some play upon words, a deception\non the part of grammar, or an audacious generalization of very\nrestricted, very personal, very human—all-too-human facts. The\nphilosophy of the dogmatists, it is to be hoped, was only a\npromise for thousands of years afterwards, as was astrology in\nstill earlier times, in the service of which probably more\nlabour, gold, acuteness, and patience have been spent than on any\nactual science hitherto: we owe to it, and to its “super-\nterrestrial” pretensions in Asia and Egypt, the grand style of\narchitecture. It seems that in order to inscribe themselves upon\nthe heart of humanity with everlasting claims, all great things\nhave first to wander about the earth as enormous and awe-\ninspiring caricatures: dogmatic philosophy has been a caricature\nof this kind—for instance, the Vedanta doctrine in Asia, and\nPlatonism in Europe. Let us not be ungrateful to it, although it\nmust certainly be confessed that the worst, the most tiresome,\nand the most dangerous of errors hitherto has been a dogmatist\nerror—namely, Plato’s invention of Pure Spirit and the Good in\nItself. But now when it has been surmounted, when Europe, rid of\nthis nightmare, can again draw breath freely and at least enjoy a\nhealthier—sleep, we, WHOSE DUTY IS WAKEFULNESS ITSELF, are the\nheirs of all the strength which the struggle against this error\nhas fostered. It amounted to the very inversion of truth, and the\ndenial of the PERSPECTIVE—the fundamental condition—of life, to\nspeak of Spirit and the Good as Plato spoke of them; indeed one\nmight ask, as a physician: “How did such a malady attack that\nfinest product of antiquity, Plato? Had the wicked Socrates\nreally corrupted him? Was Socrates after all a corrupter of\nyouths, and deserved his hemlock?” But the struggle against\nPlato, or—to speak plainer, and for the “people\"—the struggle\nagainst the ecclesiastical oppression of millenniums of\nChristianity (FOR CHRISITIANITY IS PLATONISM FOR THE “PEOPLE”),\nproduced in Europe a magnificent tension of soul, such as had not\nexisted anywhere previously; with such a tensely strained bow one\ncan now aim at the furthest goals. As a matter of fact, the\nEuropean feels this tension as a state of distress, and twice\nattempts have been made in grand style to unbend the bow: once by\nmeans of Jesuitism, and the second time by means of democratic\nenlightenment—which, with the aid of liberty of the press and\nnewspaper-reading, might, in fact, bring it about that the spirit\nwould not so easily find itself in “distress”! (The Germans\ninvented gunpowder-all credit to them! but they again made things\nsquare—they invented printing.) But we, who are neither Jesuits,\nnor democrats, nor even sufficiently Germans, we GOOD EUROPEANS,\nand free, VERY free spirits—we have it still, all the distress\nof spirit and all the tension of its bow! And perhaps also the\narrow, the duty, and, who knows? THE GOAL TO AIM AT. . . .",

        "\n1. The Will to Truth, which is to tempt us to many a hazardous\nenterprise, the famous Truthfulness of which all philosophers\nhave hitherto spoken with respect, what questions has this Will\nto Truth not laid before us! What strange, perplexing,\nquestionable questions! It is already a long story; yet it seems\nas if it were hardly commenced. Is it any wonder if we at last\ngrow distrustful, lose patience, and turn impatiently away? That\nthis Sphinx teaches us at last to ask questions ourselves? WHO is\nit really that puts questions to us here? WHAT really is this\n\"Will to Truth” in us? In fact we made a long halt at the\nquestion as to the origin of this Will—until at last we came to\nan absolute standstill before a yet more fundamental question. We\ninquired about the VALUE of this Will. Granted that we want the\ntruth: WHY NOT RATHER untruth? And uncertainty? Even ignorance?\nThe problem of the value of truth presented itself before us—or\nwas it we who presented ourselves before the problem? Which of us\nis the Oedipus here? Which the Sphinx? It would seem to be a\nrendezvous of questions and notes of interrogation. And could it\nbe believed that it at last seems to us as if the problem had\nnever been propounded before, as if we were the first to discern\nit, get a sight of it, and RISK RAISING it? For there is risk in\nraising it, perhaps there is no greater risk.",
        "2. “HOW COULD anything originate out of its opposite? For\nexample, truth out of error? or the Will to Truth out of the will\nto deception? or the generous deed out of selfishness? or the\npure sun-bright vision of the wise man out of covetousness? Such\ngenesis is impossible; whoever dreams of it is a fool, nay, worse\nthan a fool; things of the highest value must have a different\norigin, an origin of THEIR own—in this transitory, seductive,\nillusory, paltry world, in this turmoil of delusion and cupidity,\nthey cannot have their source. But rather in the lap of Being, in\nthe intransitory, in the concealed God, in the ’Thing-in-itself—\nTHERE must be their source, and nowhere else!\"—This mode of\nreasoning discloses the typical prejudice by which metaphysicians\nof all times can be recognized, this mode of valuation is at the\nback of all their logical procedure; through this “belief” of\ntheirs, they exert themselves for their “knowledge,” for\nsomething that is in the end solemnly christened “the Truth.” The\nfundamental belief of metaphysicians is THE BELIEF IN ANTITHESES\nOF VALUES. It never occurred even to the wariest of them to doubt\nhere on the very threshold (where doubt, however, was most\nnecessary); though they had made a solemn vow, “DE OMNIBUS\nDUBITANDUM.” For it may be doubted, firstly, whether antitheses\nexist at all; and secondly, whether the popular valuations and\nantitheses of value upon which metaphysicians have set their\nseal, are not perhaps merely superficial estimates, merely\nprovisional perspectives, besides being probably made from some\ncorner, perhaps from below—\"frog perspectives,” as it were, to\nborrow an expression current among painters. In spite of all the\nvalue which may belong to the true, the positive, and the\nunselfish, it might be possible that a higher and more\nfundamental value for life generally should be assigned to\npretence, to the will to delusion, to selfishness, and cupidity.\nIt might even be possible that WHAT constitutes the value of\nthose good and respected things, consists precisely in their\nbeing insidiously related, knotted, and crocheted to these evil\nand apparently opposed things—perhaps even in being essentially\nidentical with them. Perhaps! But who wishes to concern himself\nwith such dangerous “Perhapses”! For that investigation one must\nawait the advent of a new order of philosophers, such as will\nhave other tastes and inclinations, the reverse of those hitherto\nprevalent—philosophers of the dangerous “Perhaps” in every sense\nof the term. And to speak in all seriousness, I see such new\nphilosophers beginning to appear.",
        "3. Having kept a sharp eye on philosophers, and having read\nbetween their lines long enough, I now say to myself that the\ngreater part of conscious thinking must be counted among the\ninstinctive functions, and it is so even in the case of\nphilosophical thinking; one has here to learn anew, as one\nlearned anew about heredity and “innateness.” As little as the\nact of birth comes into consideration in the whole process and\nprocedure of heredity, just as little is “being-conscious\"\nOPPOSED to the instinctive in any decisive sense; the greater\npart of the conscious thinking of a philosopher is secretly\ninfluenced by his instincts, and forced into definite channels.\nAnd behind all logic and its seeming sovereignty of movement,\nthere are valuations, or to speak more plainly, physiological\ndemands, for the maintenance of a definite mode of life For\nexample, that the certain is worth more than the uncertain, that\nillusion is less valuable than “truth” such valuations, in spite\nof their regulative importance for US, might notwithstanding be\nonly superficial valuations, special kinds of maiserie, such as\nmay be necessary for the maintenance of beings such as ourselves.\nSupposing, in effect, that man is not just the “measure of\nthings.”",
        "4. The falseness of an opinion is not for us any objection to it:\nit is here, perhaps, that our new language sounds most strangely.\nThe question is, how far an opinion is life-furthering, life-\npreserving, species-preserving, perhaps species-rearing, and we\nare fundamentally inclined to maintain that the falsest opinions\n(to which the synthetic judgments a priori belong), are the most\nindispensable to us, that without a recognition of logical\nfictions, without a comparison of reality with the purely\nIMAGINED world of the absolute and immutable, without a constant\ncounterfeiting of the world by means of numbers, man could not\nlive—that the renunciation of false opinions would be a\nrenunciation of life, a negation of life. TO RECOGNISE UNTRUTH AS\nA CONDITION OF LIFE; that is certainly to impugn the traditional\nideas of value in a dangerous manner, and a philosophy which\nventures to do so, has thereby alone placed itself beyond good\nand evil.",
        "5. That which causes philosophers to be regarded half-\ndistrustfully and half-mockingly, is not the oft-repeated\ndiscovery how innocent they are—how often and easily they make\nmistakes and lose their way, in short, how childish and childlike\nthey are,—but that there is not enough honest dealing with them,\nwhereas they all raise a loud and virtuous outcry when the\nproblem of truthfulness is even hinted at in the remotest manner.\nThey all pose as though their real opinions had been discovered\nand attained through the self-evolving of a cold, pure, divinely\nindifferent dialectic (in contrast to all sorts of mystics, who,\nfairer and foolisher, talk of “inspiration”), whereas, in fact, a\nprejudiced proposition, idea, or “suggestion,” which is generally\ntheir heart’s desire abstracted and refined, is defended by them\nwith arguments sought out after the event. They are all advocates\nwho do not wish to be regarded as such, generally astute\ndefenders, also, of their prejudices, which they dub “truths,\"—\nand VERY far from having the conscience which bravely admits this\nto itself, very far from having the good taste of the courage\nwhich goes so far as to let this be understood, perhaps to warn\nfriend or foe, or in cheerful confidence and self-ridicule. The\nspectacle of the Tartuffery of old Kant, equally stiff and\ndecent, with which he entices us into the dialectic by-ways that\nlead (more correctly mislead) to his “categorical imperative\"—\nmakes us fastidious ones smile, we who find no small amusement in\nspying out the subtle tricks of old moralists and ethical\npreachers. Or, still more so, the hocus-pocus in mathematical\nform, by means of which Spinoza has, as it were, clad his\nphilosophy in mail and mask—in fact, the “love of HIS wisdom,\"\nto translate the term fairly and squarely—in order thereby to\nstrike terror at once into the heart of the assailant who should\ndare to cast a glance on that invincible maiden, that Pallas\nAthene:—how much of personal timidity and vulnerability does\nthis masquerade of a sickly recluse betray!",
        "6. It has gradually become clear to me what every great\nphilosophy up till now has consisted of—namely, the confession\nof its originator, and a species of involuntary and unconscious\nauto-biography; and moreover that the moral (or immoral) purpose\nin every philosophy has constituted the true vital germ out of\nwhich the entire plant has always grown. Indeed, to understand\nhow the abstrusest metaphysical assertions of a philosopher have\nbeen arrived at, it is always well (and wise) to first ask\noneself: “What morality do they (or does he) aim at?\"\nAccordingly, I do not believe that an “impulse to knowledge” is\nthe father of philosophy; but that another impulse, here as\nelsewhere, has only made use of knowledge (and mistaken\nknowledge!) as an instrument. But whoever considers the\nfundamental impulses of man with a view to determining how far\nthey may have here acted as INSPIRING GENII (or as demons and\ncobolds), will find that they have all practiced philosophy at\none time or another, and that each one of them would have been\nonly too glad to look upon itself as the ultimate end of\nexistence and the legitimate LORD over all the other impulses.\nFor every impulse is imperious, and as SUCH, attempts to\nphilosophize. To be sure, in the case of scholars, in the case of\nreally scientific men, it may be otherwise—\"better,” if you\nwill; there there may really be such a thing as an “impulse to\nknowledge,” some kind of small, independent clock-work, which,\nwhen well wound up, works away industriously to that end, WITHOUT\nthe rest of the scholarly impulses taking any material part\ntherein. The actual “interests” of the scholar, therefore, are\ngenerally in quite another direction—in the family, perhaps, or\nin money-making, or in politics; it is, in fact, almost\nindifferent at what point of research his little machine is\nplaced, and whether the hopeful young worker becomes a good\nphilologist, a mushroom specialist, or a chemist; he is not\nCHARACTERISED by becoming this or that. In the philosopher, on\nthe contrary, there is absolutely nothing impersonal; and above\nall, his morality furnishes a decided and decisive testimony as\nto WHO HE IS,—that is to say, in what order the deepest impulses\nof his nature stand to each other.",
        "7. How malicious philosophers can be! I know of nothing more\nstinging than the joke Epicurus took the liberty of making on\nPlato and the Platonists; he called them Dionysiokolakes. In its\noriginal sense, and on the face of it, the word signifies\n\"Flatterers of Dionysius\"—consequently, tyrants’ accessories and\nlick-spittles; besides this, however, it is as much as to say,\n\"They are all ACTORS, there is nothing genuine about them” (for\nDionysiokolax was a popular name for an actor). And the latter is\nreally the malignant reproach that Epicurus cast upon Plato: he\nwas annoyed by the grandiose manner, the mise en scene style of\nwhich Plato and his scholars were masters—of which Epicurus was\nnot a master! He, the old school-teacher of Samos, who sat\nconcealed in his little garden at Athens, and wrote three hundred\nbooks, perhaps out of rage and ambitious envy of Plato, who\nknows! Greece took a hundred years to find out who the garden-god\nEpicurus really was. Did she ever find out?",

        "9. You desire to LIVE “according to Nature”? Oh, you noble\nStoics, what fraud of words! Imagine to yourselves a being like\nNature, boundlessly extravagant, boundlessly indifferent, without\npurpose or consideration, without pity or justice, at once\nfruitful and barren and uncertain: imagine to yourselves\nINDIFFERENCE as a power—how COULD you live in accordance with\nsuch indifference? To live—is not that just endeavouring to be\notherwise than this Nature? Is not living valuing, preferring,\nbeing unjust, being limited, endeavouring to be different? And\ngranted that your imperative, “living according to Nature,” means\nactually the same as “living according to life\"—how could you do\nDIFFERENTLY? Why should you make a principle out of what you\nyourselves are, and must be? In reality, however, it is quite\notherwise with you: while you pretend to read with rapture the\ncanon of your law in Nature, you want something quite the\ncontrary, you extraordinary stage-players and self-deluders! In\nyour pride you wish to dictate your morals and ideals to Nature,\nto Nature herself, and to incorporate them therein; you insist\nthat it shall be Nature “according to the Stoa,” and would like\neverything to be made after your own image, as a vast, eternal\nglorification and generalism of Stoicism! With all your love for\ntruth, you have forced yourselves so long, so persistently, and\nwith such hypnotic rigidity to see Nature FALSELY, that is to\nsay, Stoically, that you are no longer able to see it otherwise—\nand to crown all, some unfathomable superciliousness gives you\nthe Bedlamite hope that BECAUSE you are able to tyrannize over\nyourselves—Stoicism is self-tyranny—Nature will also allow\nherself to be tyrannized over: is not the Stoic a PART of\nNature? . . . But this is an old and everlasting story: what\nhappened in old times with the Stoics still happens today, as\nsoon as ever a philosophy begins to believe in itself. It always\ncreates the world in its own image; it cannot do otherwise;\nphilosophy is this tyrannical impulse itself, the most spiritual\nWill to Power, the will to “creation of the world,” the will to\nthe causa prima.",
        "10. The eagerness and subtlety, I should even say craftiness,\nwith which the problem of “the real and the apparent world” is\ndealt with at present throughout Europe, furnishes food for\nthought and attention; and he who hears only a “Will to Truth” in\nthe background, and nothing else, cannot certainly boast of the\nsharpest ears. In rare and isolated cases, it may really have\nhappened that such a Will to Truth—a certain extravagant and\nadventurous pluck, a metaphysician’s ambition of the forlorn\nhope—has participated therein: that which in the end always\nprefers a handful of “certainty” to a whole cartload of beautiful\npossibilities; there may even be puritanical fanatics of\nconscience, who prefer to put their last trust in a sure nothing,\nrather than in an uncertain something. But that is Nihilism, and\nthe sign of a despairing, mortally wearied soul, notwithstanding\nthe courageous bearing such a virtue may display. It seems,\nhowever, to be otherwise with stronger and livelier thinkers who\nare still eager for life. In that they side AGAINST appearance,\nand speak superciliously of “perspective,” in that they rank the\ncredibility of their own bodies about as low as the credibility\nof the ocular evidence that “the earth stands still,” and thus,\napparently, allowing with complacency their securest possession\nto escape (for what does one at present believe in more firmly\nthan in one’s body?),—who knows if they are not really trying to\nwin back something which was formerly an even securer possession,\nsomething of the old domain of the faith of former times, perhaps\nthe “immortal soul,” perhaps “the old God,” in short, ideas by\nwhich they could live better, that is to say, more vigorously and\nmore joyously, than by “modern ideas”? There is DISTRUST of these\nmodern ideas in this mode of looking at things, a disbelief in\nall that has been constructed yesterday and today; there is\nperhaps some slight admixture of satiety and scorn, which can no\nlonger endure the BRIC-A-BRAC of ideas of the most varied origin,\nsuch as so-called Positivism at present throws on the market; a\ndisgust of the more refined taste at the village-fair motleyness\nand patchiness of all these reality-philosophasters, in whom\nthere is nothing either new or true, except this motleyness.\nTherein it seems to me that we should agree with those skeptical\nanti-realists and knowledge-microscopists of the present day;\ntheir instinct, which repels them from MODERN reality, is\nunrefuted . . . what do their retrograde by-paths concern us!\nThe main thing about them is NOT that they wish to go “back,\"\nbut that they wish to get AWAY therefrom. A little MORE strength,\nswing, courage, and artistic power, and they would be OFF—and\nnot back!",
        "11. It seems to me that there is everywhere an attempt at present\nto divert attention from the actual influence which Kant\nexercised on German philosophy, and especially to ignore\nprudently the value which he set upon himself. Kant was first and\nforemost proud of his Table of Categories; with it in his hand he\nsaid: “This is the most difficult thing that could ever be\nundertaken on behalf of metaphysics.” Let us only understand this\n\"could be”! He was proud of having DISCOVERED a new faculty in\nman, the faculty of synthetic judgment a priori. Granting that he\ndeceived himself in this matter; the development and rapid\nflourishing of German philosophy depended nevertheless on his\npride, and on the eager rivalry of the younger generation to\ndiscover if possible something—at all events “new faculties\"—of\nwhich to be still prouder!—But let us reflect for a moment—it\nis high time to do so. “How are synthetic judgments a priori\nPOSSIBLE?” Kant asks himself—and what is really his answer? “BY\nMEANS OF A MEANS (faculty)\"—but unfortunately not in five words,\nbut so circumstantially, imposingly, and with such display of\nGerman profundity and verbal flourishes, that one altogether\nloses sight of the comical niaiserie allemande involved in such\nan answer. People were beside themselves with delight over this\nnew faculty, and the jubilation reached its climax when Kant\nfurther discovered a moral faculty in man—for at that time\nGermans were still moral, not yet dabbling in the “Politics of\nhard fact.” Then came the honeymoon of German philosophy. All the\nyoung theologians of the Tubingen institution went immediately\ninto the groves—all seeking for “faculties.” And what did they\nnot find—in that innocent, rich, and still youthful period of\nthe German spirit, to which Romanticism, the malicious fairy,\npiped and sang, when one could not yet distinguish between\n\"finding” and “inventing”! Above all a faculty for the\n\"transcendental\"; Schelling christened it, intellectual\nintuition, and thereby gratified the most earnest longings of the\nnaturally pious-inclined Germans. One can do no greater wrong to\nthe whole of this exuberant and eccentric movement (which was\nreally youthfulness, notwithstanding that it disguised itself so\nboldly, in hoary and senile conceptions), than to take it\nseriously, or even treat it with moral indignation. Enough,\nhowever—the world grew older, and the dream vanished. A time\ncame when people rubbed their foreheads, and they still rub them\ntoday. People had been dreaming, and first and foremost—old\nKant. “By means of a means (faculty)\"—he had said, or at least\nmeant to say. But, is that—an answer? An explanation? Or is it\nnot rather merely a repetition of the question? How does opium\ninduce sleep? “By means of a means (faculty), “namely the virtus\ndormitiva, replies the doctor in Moliere,",
        "But such replies belong to the realm of comedy, and it is high\ntime to replace the Kantian question, “How are synthetic\njudgments a PRIORI possible?” by another question, “Why is belief\nin such judgments necessary?\"—in effect, it is high time that we\nshould understand that such judgments must be believed to be\ntrue, for the sake of the preservation of creatures like\nourselves; though they still might naturally be false judgments!\nOr, more plainly spoken, and roughly and readily—synthetic\njudgments a priori should not “be possible” at all; we have no\nright to them; in our mouths they are nothing but false\njudgments. Only, of course, the belief in their truth is\nnecessary, as plausible belief and ocular evidence belonging to\nthe perspective view of life. And finally, to call to mind the\nenormous influence which “German philosophy\"—I hope you\nunderstand its right to inverted commas (goosefeet)?—has\nexercised throughout the whole of Europe, there is no doubt that\na certain VIRTUS DORMITIVA had a share in it; thanks to German\nphilosophy, it was a delight to the noble idlers, the virtuous,\nthe mystics, the artiste, the three-fourths Christians, and the\npolitical obscurantists of all nations,  to find an antidote to\nthe still overwhelming sensualism which overflowed from the last\ncentury into this, in short—\"sensus assoupire.” . . .",
        "12. As regards materialistic atomism, it is one of the best-\nrefuted theories that have been advanced, and in Europe there is\nnow perhaps no one in the learned world so unscholarly as to\nattach serious signification to it, except for convenient\neveryday use (as an abbreviation of the means of expression)—\nthanks chiefly to the Pole Boscovich: he and the Pole Copernicus\nhave hitherto been the greatest and most successful opponents of\nocular evidence. For while Copernicus has persuaded us to\nbelieve, contrary to all the senses, that the earth does NOT\nstand fast, Boscovich has taught us to abjure the belief in the\nlast thing that “stood fast” of the earth—the belief in\n\"substance,” in “matter,” in the earth-residuum, and particle-\natom: it is the greatest triumph over the senses that has\nhitherto been gained on earth. One must, however, go still\nfurther, and also declare war, relentless war to the knife,\nagainst the “atomistic requirements” which still lead a dangerous\nafter-life in places where no one suspects them, like the more\ncelebrated “metaphysical requirements”: one must also above all\ngive the finishing stroke to that other and more portentous\natomism which Christianity has taught best and longest, the SOUL-\nATOMISM. Let it be permitted to designate by this expression the\nbelief which regards the soul as something indestructible,\neternal, indivisible, as a monad, as an atomon: this belief ought\nto be expelled from science! Between ourselves, it is not at all\nnecessary to get rid of “the soul” thereby, and thus renounce one\nof the oldest and most venerated hypotheses—as happens\nfrequently to the clumsiness of naturalists, who can hardly touch\non the soul without immediately losing it. But the way is open\nfor new acceptations and refinements of the soul-hypothesis; and\nsuch conceptions as “mortal soul,” and “soul of subjective\nmultiplicity,” and “soul as social structure of the instincts and\npassions,” want henceforth to have legitimate rights in science.\nIn that the NEW psychologist is about to put an end to the\nsuperstitions which have hitherto flourished with almost tropical\nluxuriance around the idea of the soul, he is really, as it were,\nthrusting himself into a new desert and a new distrust—it is\npossible that the older psychologists had a merrier and more\ncomfortable time of it; eventually, however, he finds that\nprecisely thereby he is also condemned to INVENT—and, who knows?\nperhaps to DISCOVER the new.",
        "13. Psychologists should bethink themselves before putting down\nthe instinct of self-preservation as the cardinal instinct of an\norganic being. A living thing seeks above all to DISCHARGE its\nstrength—life itself is WILL TO POWER; self-preservation is only\none of the indirect and most frequent RESULTS thereof. In short,\nhere, as everywhere else, let us beware of SUPERFLUOUS\nteleological principles!—one of which is the instinct of self-\npreservation (we owe it to Spinoza’s inconsistency). It is thus,\nin effect, that method ordains, which must be essentially economy\nof principles.",
        "14. It is perhaps just dawning on five or six minds that natural\nphilosophy is only a world-exposition and world-arrangement\n(according to us, if I may say so!) and NOT a world-explanation;\nbut in so far as it is based on belief in the senses, it is\nregarded as more, and for a long time to come must be regarded as\nmore—namely, as an explanation. It has eyes and fingers of its\nown, it has ocular evidence and palpableness of its own: this\noperates fascinatingly, persuasively, and CONVINCINGLY upon an\nage with fundamentally plebeian tastes—in fact, it follows\ninstinctively the canon of truth of eternal popular sensualism.\nWhat is clear, what is “explained”? Only that which can be seen\nand felt—one must pursue every problem thus far. Obversely,\nhowever, the charm of the Platonic mode of thought, which was an\nARISTOCRATIC mode, consisted precisely in RESISTANCE to obvious\nsense-evidence—perhaps among men who enjoyed even stronger and\nmore fastidious senses than our contemporaries, but who knew how\nto find a higher triumph in remaining masters of them: and this\nby means of pale, cold, grey conceptional networks which they\nthrew over the motley whirl of the senses—the mob of the senses,\nas Plato said. In this overcoming of the world, and interpreting\nof the world in the manner of Plato, there was an ENJOYMENT\ndifferent from that which the physicists of today offer us—and\nlikewise the Darwinists and anti-teleologists among the\nphysiological workers, with their principle of the “smallest\npossible effort,” and the greatest possible blunder. “Where there\nis nothing more to see or to grasp, there is also nothing more\nfor men to do\"—that is certainly an imperative different from\nthe Platonic one, but it may notwithstanding be the right\nimperative for a hardy, laborious race of machinists and bridge-\nbuilders of the future, who have nothing but ROUGH work to\nperform.",
        "15. To study physiology with a clear conscience, one must insist\non the fact that the sense-organs are not phenomena in the sense\nof the idealistic philosophy; as such they certainly could not be\ncauses! Sensualism, therefore, at least as regulative hypothesis,\nif not as heuristic principle. What? And others say even that the\nexternal world is the work of our organs? But then our body, as a\npart of this external world, would be the work of our organs! But\nthen our organs themselves would be the work of our organs! It\nseems to me that this is a complete REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM, if the\nconception CAUSA SUI is something fundamentally absurd.\nConsequently, the external world is NOT the work of our organs—?",
        "16. There are still harmless self-observers who believe that\nthere are “immediate certainties\"; for instance, “I think,” or as\nthe superstition of Schopenhauer puts it, “I will\"; as though\ncognition here got hold of its object purely and simply as “the\nthing in itself,” without any falsification taking place either\non the part of the subject or the object. I would repeat it,\nhowever, a hundred times, that “immediate certainty,” as well as\n\"absolute knowledge” and the “thing in itself,” involve a\nCONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO; we really ought to free ourselves from\nthe misleading significance of words! The people on their part\nmay think that cognition is knowing all about things, but the\nphilosopher must say to himself: “When I analyze the process that\nis expressed in the sentence, ’I think,’ I find a whole series of\ndaring assertions, the argumentative proof of which would be\ndifficult, perhaps impossible: for instance, that it is I who\nthink, that there must necessarily be something that thinks, that\nthinking is an activity and operation on the part of a being who\nis thought of as a cause, that there is an ’ego,’ and finally,\nthat it is already determined what is to be designated by\nthinking—that I KNOW what thinking is. For if I had not already\ndecided within myself what it is, by what standard could I\ndetermine whether that which is just happening is not perhaps\n’willing’ or ’feeling’? In short, the assertion ’I think,’\nassumes that I COMPARE my state at the present moment with other\nstates of myself which I know, in order to determine what it is;\non account of this retrospective connection with further\n’knowledge,’ it has, at any rate, no immediate certainty for\nme.\"—In place of the “immediate certainty” in which the people\nmay believe in the special case, the philosopher thus finds a\nseries of metaphysical questions presented to him, veritable\nconscience questions of the intellect, to wit: “Whence did I get\nthe notion of ’thinking’? Why do I believe in cause and effect?\nWhat gives me the right to speak of an ’ego,’ and even of an\n’ego’ as cause, and finally of an ’ego’ as cause of thought?” He\nwho ventures to answer these metaphysical questions at once by an\nappeal to a sort of INTUITIVE perception, like the person who\nsays, “I think, and know that this, at least, is true, actual,\nand certain\"—will encounter a smile and two notes of\ninterrogation in a philosopher nowadays. “Sir,” the philosopher\nwill perhaps give him to understand, “it is improbable that you\nare not mistaken, but why should it be the truth?”",
        "17. With regard to the superstitions of logicians, I shall never\ntire of emphasizing a small, terse fact, which is unwillingly\nrecognized by these credulous minds—namely, that a thought comes\nwhen “it” wishes, and not when “I” wish; so that it is a\nPERVERSION of the facts of the case to say that the subject “I\"\nis the condition of the predicate “think.” ONE thinks; but that\nthis “one” is precisely the famous old “ego,” is, to put it\nmildly, only a supposition, an assertion, and assuredly not an\n\"immediate certainty.” After all, one has even gone too far with\nthis “one thinks\"—even the “one” contains an INTERPRETATION of\nthe process, and does not belong to the process itself. One\ninfers here according to the usual grammatical formula—\"To think\nis an activity; every activity requires an agency that is active;\nconsequently” . . . It was pretty much on the same lines that the\nolder atomism sought, besides the operating “power,” the material\nparticle wherein it resides and out of which it operates—the\natom. More rigorous minds, however, learnt at last to get along\nwithout this “earth-residuum,” and perhaps some day we shall\naccustom ourselves, even from the logician’s point of view, to\nget along without the little “one” (to which the worthy old “ego\"\nhas refined itself).",
        "18. It is certainly not the least charm of a theory that it is\nrefutable; it is precisely thereby that it attracts the more\nsubtle minds. It seems that the hundred-times-refuted theory of\nthe “free will” owes its persistence to this charm alone; some\none is always appearing who feels himself strong enough to refute\nit.",
        "19. Philosophers are accustomed to speak of the will as though it\nwere the best-known thing in the world; indeed, Schopenhauer has\ngiven us to understand that the will alone is really known to us,\nabsolutely and completely known, without deduction or addition.\nBut it again and again seems to me that in this case Schopenhauer\nalso only did what philosophers are in the habit of doing-he\nseems to have adopted a POPULAR PREJUDICE and exaggerated it.\nWilling-seems to me to be above all something COMPLICATED,\nsomething that is a unity only in name—and it is precisely in a\nname that popular prejudice lurks, which has got the mastery over\nthe inadequate precautions of philosophers in all ages. So let us\nfor once be more cautious, let us be “unphilosophical”: let us\nsay that in all willing there is firstly a plurality of\nsensations, namely, the sensation of the condition “AWAY FROM\nWHICH we go,” the sensation of the condition “TOWARDS WHICH we\ngo,” the sensation of this “FROM” and “TOWARDS” itself, and then\nbesides, an accompanying muscular sensation, which, even without\nour putting in motion “arms and legs,” commences its action by\nforce of habit, directly we “will” anything. Therefore, just as\nsensations (and indeed many kinds of sensations) are to be\nrecognized as ingredients of the will, so, in the second place,\nthinking is also to be recognized; in every act of the will there\nis a ruling thought;—and let us not imagine it possible to sever\nthis thought from the “willing,” as if the will would then remain\nover! In the third place, the will is not only a complex of\nsensation and thinking, but it is above all an EMOTION, and in\nfact the emotion of the command. That which is termed “freedom of\nthe will” is essentially the emotion of supremacy in respect to\nhim who must obey: “I am free, ’he’ must obey\"—this\nconsciousness is inherent in every will; and equally so the\nstraining of the attention, the straight look which fixes itself\nexclusively on one thing, the unconditional judgment that “this\nand nothing else is necessary now,” the inward certainty that\nobedience will be rendered—and whatever else pertains to the\nposition of the commander. A man who WILLS commands something\nwithin himself which renders obedience, or which he believes\nrenders obedience. But now let us notice what is the strangest\nthing about the will,—this affair so extremely complex, for\nwhich the people have only one name. Inasmuch as in the given\ncircumstances we are at the same time the commanding AND the\nobeying parties, and as the obeying party we know the sensations\nof constraint, impulsion, pressure, resistance, and motion, which\nusually commence immediately after the act of will; inasmuch as,\non the other hand, we are accustomed to disregard this duality,\nand to deceive ourselves about it by means of the synthetic term\n\"I”: a whole series of erroneous conclusions, and consequently of\nfalse judgments about the will itself, has become attached to the\nact of willing—to such a degree that he who wills believes\nfirmly that willing SUFFICES for action. Since in the majority of\ncases there has only been exercise of will when the effect of the\ncommand—consequently obedience, and therefore action—was to be\nEXPECTED, the APPEARANCE has translated itself into the\nsentiment, as if there were a NECESSITY OF EFFECT; in a word, he\nwho wills believes with a fair amount of certainty that will and\naction are somehow one; he ascribes the success, the carrying out\nof the willing, to the will itself, and thereby enjoys an\nincrease of the sensation of power which accompanies all success.\n\"Freedom of Will\"—that is the expression for the complex state\nof delight of the person exercising volition, who commands and at\nthe same time identifies himself with the executor of the order—\nwho, as such, enjoys also the triumph over obstacles, but thinks\nwithin himself that it was really his own will that overcame\nthem. In this way the person exercising volition adds the\nfeelings of delight of his successful executive instruments, the\nuseful “underwills” or under-souls—indeed, our body is but a\nsocial structure composed of many souls—to his feelings of\ndelight as commander. L’EFFET C’EST MOI. what happens here is\nwhat happens in every well-constructed and happy commonwealth,\nnamely, that the governing class identifies itself with the\nsuccesses of the commonwealth. In all willing it is absolutely a\nquestion of commanding and obeying, on the basis, as already\nsaid, of a social structure composed of many “souls”, on which\naccount a philosopher should claim the right to include willing-\nas-such within the sphere of morals—regarded as the doctrine of\nthe relations of supremacy under which the phenomenon of “life\"\nmanifests itself.",
        "20. That the separate philosophical ideas are not anything\noptional or autonomously evolving, but grow up in connection and\nrelationship with each other, that, however suddenly and\narbitrarily they seem to appear in the history of thought, they\nnevertheless belong just as much to a system as the collective\nmembers of the fauna of a Continent—is betrayed in the end by\nthe circumstance: how unfailingly the most diverse philosophers\nalways fill in again a definite fundamental scheme of POSSIBLE\nphilosophies. Under an invisible spell, they always revolve once\nmore in the same orbit, however independent of each other they\nmay feel themselves with their critical or systematic wills,\nsomething within them leads them, something impels them in\ndefinite order the one after the other—to wit, the innate\nmethodology and relationship of their ideas. Their thinking is,\nin fact, far less a discovery than a re-recognizing, a\nremembering, a return and a home-coming to a far-off, ancient\ncommon-household of the soul, out of which those ideas formerly\ngrew: philosophizing is so far a kind of atavism of the highest\norder. The wonderful family resemblance of all Indian, Greek, and\nGerman philosophizing is easily enough explained. In fact, where\nthere is affinity of language, owing to the common philosophy of\ngrammar—I mean owing to the unconscious domination and guidance\nof similar grammatical functions—it cannot but be that\neverything is prepared at the outset for a similar development\nand succession of philosophical systems, just as the way seems\nbarred against certain other possibilities of world-\ninterpretation. It is highly probable that philosophers within\nthe domain of the Ural-Altaic languages (where the conception of\nthe subject is least developed) look otherwise “into the world,\"\nand will be found on paths of thought different from those of the\nIndo-Germans and Mussulmans, the spell of certain grammatical\nfunctions is ultimately also the spell of PHYSIOLOGICAL\nvaluations and racial conditions.—So much by way of rejecting\nLocke’s superficiality with regard to the origin of ideas.",
        "21. The CAUSA SUI is the best self-contradiction that has yet\nbeen conceived, it is a sort of logical violation and\nunnaturalness; but the extravagant pride of man has managed to\nentangle itself profoundly and frightfully with this very folly.\nThe desire for “freedom of will” in the superlative, metaphysical\nsense, such as still holds sway, unfortunately, in the minds of\nthe half-educated, the desire to bear the entire and ultimate\nresponsibility for one’s actions oneself, and to absolve God, the\nworld, ancestors, chance, and society therefrom, involves nothing\nless than to be precisely this CAUSA SUI, and, with more than\nMunchausen daring, to pull oneself up into existence by the hair,\nout of the slough of nothingness. If any one should find out in\nthis manner the crass stupidity of the celebrated conception of\n\"free will” and put it out of his head altogether, I beg of him\nto carry his “enlightenment” a step further, and also put out of\nhis head the contrary of this monstrous conception of “free\nwill”: I mean “non-free will,” which is tantamount to a misuse of\ncause and effect. One should not wrongly MATERIALISE “cause” and\n\"effect,” as the natural philosophers do (and whoever like them\nnaturalize in thinking at present), according to the prevailing\nmechanical doltishness which makes the cause press and push until\nit “effects” its end; one should use “cause” and “effect” only as\npure CONCEPTIONS, that is to say, as conventional fictions for\nthe purpose of designation and mutual understanding,—NOT for\nexplanation. In “being-in-itself” there is nothing of “casual-\nconnection,” of “necessity,” or of “psychological non-freedom\";\nthere the effect does NOT follow the cause, there “law” does not\nobtain. It is WE alone who have devised cause, sequence,\nreciprocity, relativity, constraint, number, law, freedom,\nmotive, and purpose; and when we interpret and intermix this\nsymbol-world, as “being-in-itself,” with things, we act once more\nas we have always acted—MYTHOLOGICALLY. The “non-free will” is\nmythology; in real life it is only a question of STRONG and WEAK\nwills.—It is almost always a symptom of what is lacking in\nhimself, when a thinker, in every “causal-connection” and\n\"psychological necessity,” manifests something of compulsion,\nindigence, obsequiousness, oppression, and non-freedom; it is\nsuspicious to have such feelings—the person betrays himself. And\nin general, if I have observed correctly, the “non-freedom of the\nwill” is regarded as a problem from two entirely opposite\nstandpoints, but always in a profoundly PERSONAL manner: some\nwill not give up their “responsibility,” their belief in\nTHEMSELVES, the personal right to THEIR merits, at any price (the\nvain races belong to this class); others on the contrary, do not\nwish to be answerable for anything, or blamed for anything, and\nowing to an inward self-contempt, seek to GET OUT OF THE\nBUSINESS, no matter how. The latter, when they write books, are\nin the habit at present of taking the side of criminals; a sort\nof socialistic sympathy is their favourite disguise. And as a\nmatter of fact, the fatalism of the weak-willed embellishes\nitself surprisingly when it can pose as “la religion de la\nsouffrance humaine\"; that is ITS “good taste.”",
        "22. Let me be pardoned, as an old philologist who cannot desist\nfrom the mischief of putting his finger on bad modes of\ninterpretation, but “Nature’s conformity to law,” of which you\nphysicists talk so proudly, as though—why, it exists only owing\nto your interpretation and bad “philology.” It is no matter of\nfact, no “text,” but rather just a naively humanitarian\nadjustment and perversion of meaning, with which you make\nabundant concessions to the democratic instincts of the modern\nsoul! “Everywhere equality before the law—Nature is not\ndifferent in that respect, nor better than we”: a fine instance\nof secret motive, in which the vulgar antagonism to everything\nprivileged and autocratic—likewise a second and more refined\natheism—is once more disguised. “Ni dieu, ni maitre\"—that,\nalso, is what you want; and therefore “Cheers for natural law!\"—\nis it not so? But, as has been said, that is interpretation, not\ntext; and somebody might come along, who, with opposite\nintentions and modes of interpretation, could read out of the\nsame “Nature,” and with regard to the same phenomena, just the\ntyrannically inconsiderate and relentless enforcement of the\nclaims of power—an interpreter who should so place the\nunexceptionalness and unconditionalness of all “Will to Power\"\nbefore your eyes, that almost every word, and the word “tyranny\"\nitself, would eventually seem unsuitable, or like a weakening and\nsoftening metaphor—as being too human; and who should,\nnevertheless, end by asserting the same about this world as you\ndo, namely, that it has a “necessary” and “calculable” course,\nNOT, however, because laws obtain in it, but because they are\nabsolutely LACKING, and every power effects its ultimate\nconsequences every moment. Granted that this also is only\ninterpretation—and you will be eager enough to make this\nobjection?—well, so much the better.",
        "23. All psychology hitherto has run aground on moral prejudices\nand timidities, it has not dared to launch out into the depths.\nIn so far as it is allowable to recognize in that which has\nhitherto been written, evidence of that which has hitherto been\nkept silent, it seems as if nobody had yet harboured the notion\nof psychology as the Morphology and DEVELOPMENT-DOCTRINE OF THE\nWILL TO POWER, as I conceive of it. The power of moral prejudices\nhas penetrated deeply into the most intellectual world, the world\napparently most indifferent and unprejudiced, and has obviously\noperated in an injurious, obstructive, blinding, and distorting\nmanner. A proper physio-psychology has to contend with\nunconscious antagonism in the heart of the investigator, it has\n\"the heart” against it even a doctrine of the reciprocal\nconditionalness of the “good” and the “bad” impulses, causes (as\nrefined immorality) distress and aversion in a still strong and\nmanly conscience—still more so, a doctrine of the derivation of\nall good impulses from bad ones. If, however, a person should\nregard even the emotions of hatred, envy, covetousness, and\nimperiousness as life-conditioning emotions, as factors which\nmust be present, fundamentally and essentially, in the general\neconomy of life (which must, therefore, be further developed if\nlife is to be further developed), he will suffer from such a view\nof things as from sea-sickness. And yet this hypothesis is far\nfrom being the strangest and most painful in this immense and\nalmost new domain of dangerous knowledge, and there are in fact a\nhundred good reasons why every one should keep away from it who\nCAN do so! On the other hand, if one has once drifted hither with\none’s bark, well! very good! now let us set our teeth firmly! let\nus open our eyes and keep our hand fast on the helm! We sail away\nright OVER morality, we crush out, we destroy perhaps the remains\nof our own morality by daring to make our voyage thither—but\nwhat do WE matter. Never yet did a PROFOUNDER world of insight\nreveal itself to daring travelers and adventurers, and the\npsychologist who thus “makes a sacrifice\"—it is not the\nsacrifizio dell’ intelletto, on the contrary!—will at least be\nentitled to demand in return that psychology shall once more be\nrecognized as the queen of the sciences, for whose service and\nequipment the other sciences exist. For psychology is once more\nthe path to the fundamental problems.",
        "\n24. O sancta simplicitiatas! In what strange simplification and\nfalsification man lives! One can never cease wondering when once\none has got eyes for beholding this marvel! How we have made\neverything around us clear and free and easy and simple! how we\nhave been able to give our senses a passport to everything\nsuperficial, our thoughts a godlike desire for wanton pranks and\nwrong inferences!—how from the beginning, we have contrived to\nretain our ignorance in order to enjoy an almost inconceivable\nfreedom, thoughtlessness, imprudence, heartiness, and gaiety—in\norder to enjoy life! And only on this solidified, granitelike\nfoundation of ignorance could knowledge rear itself hitherto, the\nwill to knowledge on the foundation of a far more powerful will,\nthe will to ignorance, to the uncertain, to the untrue! Not as\nits opposite, but—as its refinement! It is to be hoped, indeed,\nthat LANGUAGE, here as elsewhere, will not get over its\nawkwardness, and that it will continue to talk of opposites where\nthere are only degrees and many refinements of gradation; it is\nequally to be hoped that the incarnated Tartuffery of morals,\nwhich now belongs to our unconquerable “flesh and blood,” will\nturn the words round in the mouths of us discerning ones. Here\nand there we understand it, and laugh at the way in which\nprecisely the best knowledge seeks most to retain us in this\nSIMPLIFIED, thoroughly artificial, suitably imagined, and\nsuitably falsified world: at the way in which, whether it will or\nnot, it loves error, because, as living itself, it loves life!",
        "25. After such a cheerful commencement, a serious word would fain\nbe heard; it appeals to the most serious minds. Take care, ye\nphilosophers and friends of knowledge, and beware of martyrdom!\nOf suffering “for the truth’s sake”! even in your own defense! It\nspoils all the innocence and fine neutrality of your conscience;\nit makes you headstrong against objections and red rags; it\nstupefies, animalizes, and brutalizes, when in the struggle with\ndanger, slander, suspicion, expulsion, and even worse\nconsequences of enmity, ye have at last to play your last card as\nprotectors of truth upon earth—as though “the Truth” were such\nan innocent and incompetent creature as to require protectors!\nand you of all people, ye knights of the sorrowful countenance,\nMessrs Loafers and Cobweb-spinners of the spirit! Finally, ye\nknow sufficiently well that it cannot be of any consequence if YE\njust carry your point; ye know that hitherto no philosopher has\ncarried his point, and that there might be a more laudable\ntruthfulness in every little interrogative mark which you place\nafter your special words and favourite doctrines (and\noccasionally after yourselves) than in all the solemn pantomime\nand trumping games before accusers and law-courts! Rather go out\nof the way! Flee into concealment! And have your masks and your\nruses, that ye may be mistaken for what you are, or somewhat\nfeared! And pray, don’t forget the garden, the garden with golden\ntrellis-work! And have people around you who are as a garden—or\nas music on the waters at eventide, when already the day becomes\na memory. Choose the GOOD solitude, the free, wanton, lightsome\nsolitude, which also gives you the right still to remain good in\nany sense whatsoever! How poisonous, how crafty, how bad, does\nevery long war make one, which cannot be waged openly by means of\nforce! How PERSONAL does a long fear make one, a long watching of\nenemies, of possible enemies! These pariahs of society, these\nlong-pursued, badly-persecuted ones—also the compulsory\nrecluses, the Spinozas or Giordano Brunos—always become in the\nend, even under the most intellectual masquerade, and perhaps\nwithout being themselves aware of it, refined vengeance-seekers\nand poison-Brewers (just lay bare the foundation of Spinoza’s\nethics and theology!), not to speak of the stupidity of moral\nindignation, which is the unfailing sign in a philosopher that\nthe sense of philosophical humour has left him. The martyrdom of\nthe philosopher, his “sacrifice for the sake of truth,” forces\ninto the light whatever of the agitator and actor lurks in him;\nand if one has hitherto contemplated him only with artistic\ncuriosity, with regard to many a philosopher it is easy to\nunderstand the dangerous desire to see him also in his\ndeterioration (deteriorated into a “martyr,” into a stage-and-\ntribune-bawler). Only, that it is necessary with such a desire to\nbe clear WHAT spectacle one will see in any case—merely a\nsatyric play, merely an epilogue farce, merely the continued\nproof that the long, real tragedy IS AT AN END, supposing that\nevery philosophy has been a long tragedy in its origin.",
        "26. Every select man strives instinctively for a citadel and a\nprivacy, where he is FREE from the crowd, the many, the majority—\nwhere he may forget “men who are the rule,” as their exception;—\nexclusive only of the case in which he is pushed straight to\nsuch men by a still stronger instinct, as a discerner in the\ngreat and exceptional sense. Whoever, in intercourse with men,\ndoes not occasionally glisten in all the green and grey colours\nof distress, owing to disgust, satiety, sympathy, gloominess, and\nsolitariness, is assuredly not a man of elevated tastes;\nsupposing, however, that he does not voluntarily take all this\nburden and disgust upon himself, that he persistently avoids it,\nand remains, as I said, quietly and proudly hidden in his\ncitadel, one thing is then certain: he was not made, he was not\npredestined for knowledge. For as such, he would one day have to\nsay to himself: “The devil take my good taste! but ’the rule’ is\nmore interesting than the exception—than myself, the exception!\"\nAnd he would go DOWN, and above all, he would go “inside.” The\nlong and serious study of the AVERAGE man—and consequently much\ndisguise, self-overcoming, familiarity, and bad intercourse (all\nintercourse is bad intercourse except with one’s equals):—that\nconstitutes a necessary part of the life-history of every\nphilosopher; perhaps the most disagreeable, odious, and\ndisappointing part. If he is fortunate, however, as a favourite\nchild of knowledge should be, he will meet with suitable\nauxiliaries who will shorten and lighten his task; I mean so-\ncalled cynics, those who simply recognize the animal, the\ncommonplace and “the rule” in themselves, and at the same time\nhave so much spirituality and ticklishness as to make them talk\nof themselves and their like BEFORE WITNESSES—sometimes they\nwallow, even in books, as on their own dung-hill. Cynicism is the\nonly form in which base souls approach what is called honesty;\nand the higher man must open his ears to all the coarser or finer\ncynicism, and congratulate himself when the clown becomes\nshameless right before him, or the scientific satyr speaks out.\nThere are even cases where enchantment mixes with the disgust—\nnamely, where by a freak of nature, genius is bound to some such\nindiscreet billy-goat and ape, as in the case of the Abbe\nGaliani, the profoundest, acutest, and perhaps also filthiest man\nof his century—he was far profounder than Voltaire, and\nconsequently also, a good deal more silent. It happens more\nfrequently, as has been hinted, that a scientific head is placed\non an ape’s body, a fine exceptional understanding in a base\nsoul, an occurrence by no means rare, especially among doctors\nand moral physiologists. And whenever anyone speaks without\nbitterness, or rather quite innocently, of man as a belly with\ntwo requirements, and a head with one; whenever any one sees,\nseeks, and WANTS to see only hunger, sexual instinct, and vanity\nas the real and only motives of human actions; in short, when any\none speaks “badly\"—and not even “ill\"—of man, then ought the\nlover of knowledge to hearken attentively and diligently; he\nought, in general, to have an open ear wherever there is talk\nwithout indignation. For the indignant man, and he who\nperpetually tears and lacerates himself with his own teeth (or,\nin place of himself, the world, God, or society), may indeed,\nmorally speaking, stand higher than the laughing and self-\nsatisfied satyr, but in every other sense he is the more\nordinary, more indifferent, and less instructive case.

As regards “the good friends,” however, who\nare always too easy-going, and think that as friends they have a\nright to ease, one does well at the very first to grant them a\nplay-ground and romping-place for misunderstanding—one can thus\nlaugh still; or get rid of them altogether, these good friends—\nand laugh then also!",
        "28. What is most difficult to render from one language into\nanother is the TEMPO of its style, which has its basis in the\ncharacter of the race, or to speak more physiologically, in the\naverage TEMPO of the assimilation of its nutriment. There are\nhonestly meant translations, which, as involuntary\nvulgarizations, are almost falsifications of the original, merely\nbecause its lively and merry TEMPO (which overleaps and obviates\nall dangers in word and expression) could not also be rendered. A\nGerman is almost incapacitated for PRESTO in his language;\nconsequently also, as may be reasonably inferred, for many of the\nmost delightful and daring NUANCES of free, free-spirited\nthought. And just as the buffoon and satyr are foreign to him in\nbody and conscience, so Aristophanes and Petronius are\nuntranslatable for him. Everything ponderous, viscous, and\npompously clumsy, all long-winded and wearying species of style,\nare developed in profuse variety among Germans—pardon me for\nstating the fact that even Goethe’s prose, in its mixture of\nstiffness and elegance, is no exception, as a reflection of the\n\"good old time” to which it belongs, and as an expression of\nGerman taste at a time when there was still a “German taste,\"\nwhich was a rococo-taste in moribus et artibus. Lessing is an\nexception, owing to his histrionic nature, which understood much,\nand was versed in many things; he who was not the translator of\nBayle to no purpose, who took refuge willingly in the shadow of\nDiderot and Voltaire, and still more willingly among the Roman\ncomedy-writers—Lessing loved also free-spiritism in the TEMPO,\nand flight out of Germany. But how could the German language,\neven in the prose of Lessing, imitate the TEMPO of Machiavelli,\nwho in his “Principe” makes us breathe the dry, fine air of\nFlorence, and cannot help presenting the most serious events in a\nboisterous allegrissimo, perhaps not without a malicious artistic\nsense of the contrast he ventures to present—long, heavy,\ndifficult, dangerous thoughts, and a TEMPO of the gallop, and of\nthe best, wantonest humour? Finally, who would venture on a\nGerman translation of Petronius, who, more than any great\nmusician hitherto, was a master of PRESTO in invention, ideas,\nand words? What matter in the end about the swamps of the sick,\nevil world, or of the “ancient world,” when like him, one has the\nfeet of a wind, the rush, the breath, the emancipating scorn of a\nwind, which makes everything healthy, by making everything RUN!\nAnd with regard to Aristophanes—that transfiguring,\ncomplementary genius, for whose sake one PARDONS all Hellenism\nfor having existed, provided one has understood in its full\nprofundity ALL that there requires pardon and transfiguration;\nthere is nothing that has caused me to meditate more on PLATO’S\nsecrecy and sphinx-like nature, than the happily preserved petit\nfait that under the pillow of his death-bed there was found no\n\"Bible,” nor anything Egyptian, Pythagorean, or Platonic—but a\nbook of Aristophanes.

        "30. Our deepest insights must—and should—appear as follies, and\nunder certain circumstances as crimes, when they come\nunauthorizedly to the ears of those who are not disposed and\npredestined for them. The exoteric and the esoteric, as they were\nformerly distinguished by philosophers—among the Indians, as\namong the Greeks, Persians, and Mussulmans, in short, wherever\npeople believed in gradations of rank and NOT in equality and\nequal rights—are not so much in contradistinction to one another\nin respect to the exoteric class, standing without, and viewing,\nestimating, measuring, and judging from the outside, and not from\nthe inside; the more essential distinction is that the class in\nquestion views things from below upwards—while the esoteric\nclass views things FROM ABOVE DOWNWARDS. There are heights of the\nsoul from which tragedy itself no longer appears to operate\ntragically; and if all the woe in the world were taken together,\nwho would dare to decide whether the sight of it would\nNECESSARILY seduce and constrain to sympathy, and thus to a\ndoubling of the woe? . . . That which serves the higher class of\nmen for nourishment or refreshment, must be almost poison to an\nentirely different and lower order of human beings. The virtues\nof the common man would perhaps mean vice and weakness in a\nphilosopher; it might be possible for a highly developed man,\nsupposing him to degenerate and go to ruin, to acquire qualities\nthereby alone, for the sake of which he would have to be honoured\nas a saint in the lower world into which he had sunk. There are\nbooks which have an inverse value for the soul and the health\naccording as the inferior soul and the lower vitality, or the\nhigher and more powerful, make use of them. In the former case\nthey are dangerous, disturbing, unsettling books, in the latter\ncase they are herald-calls which summon the bravest to THEIR\nbravery. Books for the general reader are always ill-smelling\nbooks, the odour of paltry people clings to them. Where the\npopulace eat and drink, and even where they reverence, it is\naccustomed to stink.

        "31. In our youthful years we still venerate and despise without\nthe art of NUANCE, which is the best gain of life, and we have\nrightly to do hard penance for having fallen upon men and things\nwith Yea and Nay. Everything is so arranged that the worst of all\ntastes, THE TASTE FOR THE UNCONDITIONAL, is cruelly befooled and\nabused, until a man learns to introduce a little art into his\nsentiments, and prefers to try conclusions with the artificial,\nas do the real artists of life. The angry and reverent spirit\npeculiar to youth appears to allow itself no peace, until it has\nsuitably falsified men and things, to be able to vent its passion\nupon them: youth in itself even, is something falsifying and\ndeceptive. Later on, when the young soul, tortured by continual\ndisillusions, finally turns suspiciously against itself—still\nardent and savage even in its suspicion and remorse of\nconscience: how it upbraids itself, how impatiently it tears\nitself, how it revenges itself for its long self-blinding, as\nthough it had been a voluntary blindness! In this transition one\npunishes oneself by distrust of one’s sentiments; one tortures\none’s enthusiasm with doubt, one feels even the good conscience\nto be a danger, as if it were the self-concealment and lassitude\nof a more refined uprightness; and above all, one espouses upon\nprinciple the cause AGAINST “youth.\"—A decade later, and one\ncomprehends that all this was also still—youth!",
        "32. Throughout the longest period of human history—one calls it\nthe prehistoric period—the value or non-value of an action was\ninferred from its CONSEQUENCES; the action in itself was not\ntaken into consideration, any more than its origin; but pretty\nmuch as in China at present, where the distinction or disgrace of\na child redounds to its parents, the retro-operating power of\nsuccess or failure was what induced men to think well or ill of\nan action. Let us call this period the PRE-MORAL period of\nmankind; the imperative, “Know thyself!” was then still unknown.\n—In the last ten thousand years, on the other hand, on certain\nlarge portions of the earth, one has gradually got so far, that\none no longer lets the consequences of an action, but its origin,\ndecide with regard to its worth: a great achievement as a whole,\nan important refinement of vision and of criterion, the\nunconscious effect of the supremacy of aristocratic values and of\nthe belief in “origin,” the mark of a period which may be\ndesignated in the narrower sense as the MORAL one: the first\nattempt at self-knowledge is thereby made. Instead of the\nconsequences, the origin—what an inversion of perspective! And\nassuredly an inversion effected only after long struggle and\nwavering! To be sure, an ominous new superstition, a peculiar\nnarrowness of interpretation, attained supremacy precisely\nthereby: the origin of an action was interpreted in the most\ndefinite sense possible, as origin out of an INTENTION; people\nwere agreed in the belief that the value of an action lay in the\nvalue of its intention. The intention as the sole origin and\nantecedent history of an action: under the influence of this\nprejudice moral praise and blame have been bestowed, and men have\njudged and even philosophized almost up to the present day.—Is\nit not possible, however, that the necessity may now have arisen\nof again making up our minds with regard to the reversing and\nfundamental shifting of values, owing to a new self-consciousness\nand acuteness in man—is it not possible that we may be standing\non the threshold of a period which to begin with, would be\ndistinguished negatively as ULTRA-MORAL: nowadays when, at least\namong us immoralists, the suspicion arises that the decisive\nvalue of an action lies precisely in that which is NOT\nINTENTIONAL, and that all its intentionalness, all that is seen,\nsensible, or “sensed” in it, belongs to its surface or skin—\nwhich, like every skin, betrays something, but CONCEALS still\nmore? In short, we believe that the intention is only a sign or\nsymptom, which first requires an explanation—a sign, moreover,\nwhich has too many interpretations, and consequently hardly any\nmeaning in itself alone: that morality, in the sense in which it\nhas been understood hitherto, as intention-morality, has been a\nprejudice, perhaps a prematureness or preliminariness, probably\nsomething of the same rank as astrology and alchemy, but in any\ncase something which must be surmounted. The surmounting of\nmorality, in a certain sense even the self-mounting of morality—\nlet that be the name for the long-secret labour which has been\nreserved for the most refined, the most upright, and also the\nmost wicked consciences of today, as the living touchstones of\nthe soul.",
        "33. It cannot be helped: the sentiment of surrender, of sacrifice\nfor one’s neighbour, and all self-renunciation-morality, must be\nmercilessly called to account, and brought to judgment; just as\nthe aesthetics of “disinterested contemplation,” under which the\nemasculation of art nowadays seeks insidiously enough to create\nitself a good conscience. There is far too much witchery and\nsugar in the sentiments “for others” and “NOT for myself,” for\none not needing to be doubly distrustful here, and for one asking\npromptly: “Are they not perhaps—DECEPTIONS?\"—That they PLEASE—\nhim who has them, and him who enjoys their fruit, and also the\nmere spectator—that is still no argument in their FAVOUR, but\njust calls for caution. Let us therefore be cautious!",
        "34. At whatever standpoint of philosophy one may place oneself\nnowadays, seen from every position, the ERRONEOUSNESS of the\nworld in which we think we live is the surest and most certain\nthing our eyes can light upon: we find proof after proof thereof,\nwhich would fain allure us into surmises concerning a deceptive\nprinciple in the “nature of things.” He, however, who makes\nthinking itself, and consequently “the spirit,” responsible for\nthe falseness of the world—an honourable exit, which every\nconscious or unconscious advocatus dei avails himself of—he who\nregards this world, including space, time, form, and movement, as\nfalsely DEDUCED, would have at least good reason in the end to\nbecome distrustful also of all thinking; has it not hitherto been\nplaying upon us the worst of scurvy tricks? and what guarantee\nwould it give that it would not continue to do what it has always\nbeen doing? In all seriousness, the innocence of thinkers has\nsomething touching and respect-inspiring in it, which even\nnowadays permits them to wait upon consciousness with the request\nthat it will give them HONEST answers: for example, whether it be\n\"real” or not, and why it keeps the outer world so resolutely at\na distance, and other questions of the same description. The\nbelief in “immediate certainties” is a MORAL NAIVETE which does\nhonour to us philosophers; but—we have now to cease being\n\"MERELY moral” men! Apart from morality, such belief is a folly\nwhich does little honour to us! If in middle-class life an ever-\nready distrust is regarded as the sign of a “bad character,” and\nconsequently as an imprudence, here among us, beyond the middle-\nclass world and its Yeas and Nays, what should prevent our being\nimprudent and saying: the philosopher has at length a RIGHT to\n\"bad character,” as the being who has hitherto been most befooled\non earth—he is now under OBLIGATION to distrustfulness, to the\nwickedest squinting out of every abyss of suspicion.—Forgive me\nthe joke of this gloomy grimace and turn of expression; for I\nmyself have long ago learned to think and estimate differently\nwith regard to deceiving and being deceived, and I keep at least\na couple of pokes in the ribs ready for the blind rage with which\nphilosophers struggle against being deceived. Why NOT? It is\nnothing more than a moral prejudice that truth is worth more than\nsemblance; it is, in fact, the worst proved supposition in the\nworld. So much must be conceded: there could have been no life at\nall except upon the basis of perspective estimates and\nsemblances; and if, with the virtuous enthusiasm and stupidity of\nmany philosophers, one wished to do away altogether with the\n\"seeming world\"—well, granted that YOU could do that,—at least\nnothing of your “truth” would thereby remain! Indeed, what is it\nthat forces us in general to the supposition that there is an\nessential opposition of “true” and “false”? Is it not enough to\nsuppose degrees of seemingness, and as it were lighter and darker\nshades and tones of semblance—different valeurs, as the painters\nsay? Why might not the world WHICH CONCERNS US—be a fiction? And\nto any one who suggested: “But to a fiction belongs an\noriginator?\"—might it not be bluntly replied: WHY? May not this\n\"belong” also belong to the fiction? Is it not at length\npermitted to be a little ironical towards the subject, just as\ntowards the predicate and object? Might not the philosopher\nelevate himself above faith in grammar? All respect to\ngovernesses, but is it not time that philosophy should renounce\ngoverness-faith?",
        "35. O Voltaire! O humanity! O idiocy! There is something ticklish\nin “the truth,” and in the SEARCH for the truth; and if man goes\nabout it too humanely—\"il ne cherche le vrai que pour faire le\nbien\"—I wager he finds nothing!",
        "36. Supposing that nothing else is “given” as real but our world\nof desires and passions, that we cannot sink or rise to any other\n\"reality” but just that of our impulses—for thinking is only a\nrelation of these impulses to one another:—are we not permitted\nto make the attempt and to ask the question whether this which is\n\"given” does not SUFFICE, by means of our counterparts, for the\nunderstanding even of the so-called mechanical (or “material”)\nworld? I do not mean as an illusion, a “semblance,” a\n\"representation” (in the Berkeleyan and Schopenhauerian sense),\nbut as possessing the same degree of reality as our emotions\nthemselves—as a more primitive form of the world of emotions, in\nwhich everything still lies locked in a mighty unity, which\nafterwards branches off and develops itself in organic processes\n(naturally also, refines and debilitates)—as a kind of\ninstinctive life in which all organic functions, including self-\nregulation, assimilation, nutrition, secretion, and change of\nmatter, are still synthetically united with one another—as a\nPRIMARY FORM of life?—In the end, it is not only permitted to\nmake this attempt, it is commanded by the conscience of LOGICAL\nMETHOD. Not to assume several kinds of causality, so long as the\nattempt to get along with a single one has not been pushed to its\nfurthest extent (to absurdity, if I may be allowed to say so):\nthat is a morality of method which one may not repudiate\nnowadays—it follows “from its definition,” as mathematicians\nsay. The question is ultimately whether we really recognize the\nwill as OPERATING, whether we believe in the causality of the\nwill; if we do so—and fundamentally our belief IN THIS is just\nour belief in causality itself—we MUST make the attempt to posit\nhypothetically the causality of the will as the only causality.\n\"Will” can naturally only operate on “will\"—and not on “matter\"\n(not on “nerves,” for instance): in short, the hypothesis must be\nhazarded, whether will does not operate on will wherever\n\"effects” are recognized—and whether all mechanical action,\ninasmuch as a power operates therein, is not just the power of\nwill, the effect of will. Granted, finally, that we succeeded in\nexplaining our entire instinctive life as the development and\nramification of one fundamental form of will—namely, the Will to\nPower, as my thesis puts it; granted that all organic functions\ncould be traced back to this Will to Power, and that the solution\nof the problem of generation and nutrition—it is one problem—\ncould also be found therein: one would thus have acquired the\nright to define ALL active force unequivocally as WILL TO POWER.\nThe world seen from within, the world defined and designated\naccording to its “intelligible character\"—it would simply be\n\"Will to Power,” and nothing else.",

As happened finally in all the enlightenment of modern times\nwith the French Revolution (that terrible farce, quite\nsuperfluous when judged close at hand, into which, however, the\nnoble and visionary spectators of all Europe have interpreted\nfrom a distance their own indignation and enthusiasm so long and\npassionately, UNTIL THE TEXT HAS DISAPPEARED UNDER THE\nINTERPRETATION), so a noble posterity might once more\nmisunderstand the whole of the past, and perhaps only thereby\nmake ITS aspect endurable.—Or rather, has not this already\nhappened? Have not we ourselves been—that “noble posterity”?\nAnd, in so far as we now comprehend this, is it not—thereby\nalready past?",
        "39. Nobody will very readily regard a doctrine as true merely\nbecause it makes people happy or virtuous—excepting, perhaps,\nthe amiable “Idealists,” who are enthusiastic about the good,\ntrue, and beautiful, and let all kinds of motley, coarse, and\ngood-natured desirabilities swim about promiscuously in their\npond. Happiness and virtue are no arguments. It is willingly\nforgotten, however, even on the part of thoughtful minds, that to\nmake unhappy and to make bad are just as little counter-\narguments. A thing could be TRUE, although it were in the highest\ndegree injurious and dangerous; indeed, the fundamental\nconstitution of existence might be such that one succumbed by a\nfull knowledge of it—so that the strength of a mind might be\nmeasured by the amount of “truth” it could endure—or to speak\nmore plainly, by the extent to which it REQUIRED truth\nattenuated, veiled, sweetened, damped, and falsified. But there\nis no doubt that for the discovery of certain PORTIONS of truth\nthe wicked and unfortunate are more favourably situated and have\na greater likelihood of success; not to speak of the wicked who\nare happy—a species about whom moralists are silent. Perhaps\nseverity and craft are more favourable conditions for the\ndevelopment of strong, independent spirits and philosophers than\nthe gentle, refined, yielding good-nature, and habit of taking\nthings easily, which are prized, and rightly prized in a learned\nman. Presupposing always, to begin with, that the term\n\"philosopher” be not confined to the philosopher who writes\nbooks, or even introduces HIS philosophy into books!—Stendhal\nfurnishes a last feature of the portrait of the free-spirited\nphilosopher, which for the sake of German taste I will not omit\nto underline—for it is OPPOSED to German taste. “Pour etre bon\nphilosophe,” says this last great psychologist, “il faut etre\nsec, clair, sans illusion. Un banquier, qui a fait fortune, a une\npartie du caractere requis pour faire des decouvertes en\nphilosophie, c’est-a-dire pour voir clair dans ce qui est.”",
        "40. Everything that is profound loves the mask: the profoundest\nthings have a hatred even of figure and likeness. Should not the\nCONTRARY only be the right disguise for the shame of a God to go\nabout in? A question worth asking!—it would be strange if some\nmystic has not already ventured on the same kind of thing. There\nare proceedings of such a delicate nature that it is well to\noverwhelm them with coarseness and make them unrecognizable;\nthere are actions of love and of an extravagant magnanimity after\nwhich nothing can be wiser than to take a stick and thrash the\nwitness soundly: one thereby obscures his recollection. Many a\none is able to obscure and abuse his own memory, in order at\nleast to have vengeance on this sole party in the secret: shame\nis inventive. They are not the worst things of which one is most\nashamed: there is not only deceit behind a mask—there is so much\ngoodness in craft. I could imagine that a man with something\ncostly and fragile to conceal, would roll through life clumsily\nand rotundly like an old, green, heavily-hooped wine-cask: the\nrefinement of his shame requiring it to be so. A man who has\ndepths in his shame meets his destiny and his delicate decisions\nupon paths which few ever reach, and with regard to the existence\nof which his nearest and most intimate friends may be ignorant;\nhis mortal danger conceals itself from their eyes, and equally so\nhis regained security. Such a hidden nature, which instinctively\nemploys speech for silence and concealment, and is inexhaustible\nin evasion of communication, DESIRES and insists that a mask of\nhimself shall occupy his place in the hearts and heads of his\nfriends; and supposing he does not desire it, his eyes will some\nday be opened to the fact that there is nevertheless a mask of\nhim there—and that it is well to be so. Every profound spirit\nneeds a mask; nay, more, around every profound spirit there\ncontinually grows a mask, owing to the constantly false, that is\nto say, SUPERFICIAL interpretation of every word he utters, every\nstep he takes, every sign of life he manifests.",
        "41. One must subject oneself to one’s own tests that one is\ndestined for independence and command, and do so at the right\ntime. One must not avoid one’s tests, although they constitute\nperhaps the most dangerous game one can play, and are in the end\ntests made only before ourselves and before no other judge. Not\nto cleave to any person, be it even the dearest—every person is\na prison and also a recess. Not to cleave to a fatherland, be it\neven the most suffering and necessitous—it is even less\ndifficult to detach one’s heart from a victorious fatherland. Not\nto cleave to a sympathy, be it even for higher men, into whose\npeculiar torture and helplessness chance has given us an insight.\nNot to cleave to a science, though it tempt one with the most\nvaluable discoveries, apparently specially reserved for us. Not\nto cleave to one’s own liberation, to the voluptuous distance and\nremoteness of the bird, which always flies further aloft in order\nalways to see more under it—the danger of the flier. Not to\ncleave to our own virtues, nor become as a whole a victim to any\nof our specialties, to our “hospitality” for instance, which is\nthe danger of dangers for highly developed and wealthy souls, who\ndeal prodigally, almost indifferently with themselves, and push\nthe virtue of liberality so far that it becomes a vice.

        "42. A new order of philosophers is appearing; I shall venture to\nbaptize them by a name not without danger. As far as I understand\nthem, as far as they allow themselves to be understood—for it is\ntheir nature to WISH to remain something of a puzzle—these\nphilosophers of the future might rightly, perhaps also wrongly,\nclaim to be designated as “tempters.” This name itself is after\nall only an attempt, or, if it be preferred, a temptation.",
        "43. Will they be new friends of “truth,” these coming\nphilosophers? Very probably, for all philosophers hitherto have\nloved their truths. But assuredly they will not be dogmatists. It\nmust be contrary to their pride, and also contrary to their\ntaste, that their truth should still be truth for every one—that\nwhich has hitherto been the secret wish and ultimate purpose of\nall dogmatic efforts. “My opinion is MY opinion: another person\nhas not easily a right to it\"—such a philosopher of the future\nwill say, perhaps. One must renounce the bad taste of wishing to\nagree with many people. “Good” is no longer good when one’s\nneighbour takes it into his mouth. And how could there be a\n\"common good”! The expression contradicts itself; that which can\nbe common is always of small value. In the end things must be as\nthey are and have always been—the great things remain for the\ngreat, the abysses for the profound, the delicacies and thrills\nfor the refined, and, to sum up shortly, everything rare for the\nrare.",
        "\n44. Need I say expressly after all this that they will be free,\nVERY free spirits, these philosophers of the future—as certainly\nalso they will not be merely free spirits, but something more,\nhigher, greater, and fundamentally different, which does not wish\nto be misunderstood and mistaken? But while I say this, I feel\nunder OBLIGATION almost as much to them as to ourselves (we free\nspirits who are their heralds and forerunners), to sweep away\nfrom ourselves altogether a stupid old prejudice and\nmisunderstanding, which, like a fog, has too long made the\nconception of “free spirit” obscure. In every country of Europe,\nand the same in America, there is at present something which\nmakes an abuse of this name a very narrow, prepossessed,\nenchained class of spirits, who desire almost the opposite of\nwhat our intentions and instincts prompt—not to mention that in\nrespect to the NEW philosophers who are appearing, they must\nstill more be closed windows and bolted doors. Briefly and\nregrettably, they belong to the LEVELLERS, these wrongly named\n\"free spirits\"—as glib-tongued and scribe-fingered slaves of the\ndemocratic taste and its “modern ideas” all of them men without\nsolitude, without personal solitude, blunt honest fellows to whom\nneither courage nor honourable conduct ought to be denied, only,\nthey are not free, and are ludicrously superficial, especially in\ntheir innate partiality for seeing the cause of almost ALL human\nmisery and failure in the old forms in which society has hitherto\nexisted—a notion which happily inverts the truth entirely! What\nthey would fain attain with all their strength, is the universal,\ngreen-meadow happiness of the herd, together with security,\nsafety, comfort, and alleviation of life for every one, their two\nmost frequently chanted songs and doctrines are called “Equality\nof Rights” and “Sympathy with All Sufferers\"—and suffering\nitself is looked upon by them as something which must be DONE\nAWAY WITH. We opposite ones, however, who have opened our eye and\nconscience to the question how and where the plant “man” has\nhitherto grown most vigorously, believe that this has always\ntaken place under the opposite conditions, that for this end the\ndangerousness of his situation had to be increased enormously,\nhis inventive faculty and dissembling power (his “spirit”) had to\ndevelop into subtlety and daring under long oppression and\ncompulsion, and his Will to Life had to be increased to the\nunconditioned Will to Power—we believe that severity, violence,\nslavery, danger in the street and in the heart, secrecy,\nstoicism, tempter’s art and devilry of every kind,—that\neverything wicked, terrible, tyrannical, predatory, and\nserpentine in man, serves as well for the elevation of the human\nspecies as its opposite—we do not even say enough when we only\nsay THIS MUCH, and in any case we find ourselves here, both with\nour speech and our silence, at the OTHER extreme of all modern\nideology and gregarious desirability, as their anti-podes\nperhaps? What wonder that we “free spirits” are not exactly the\nmost communicative spirits? that we do not wish to betray in\nevery respect WHAT a spirit can free itself from, and WHERE\nperhaps it will then be driven? And as to the import of the\ndangerous formula, “Beyond Good and Evil,” with which we at least\navoid confusion, we ARE something else than “libres-penseurs,\"\n\"liben pensatori” “free-thinkers,” and whatever these honest\nadvocates of “modern ideas” like to call themselves.

The human soul and its limits, the range of man’s inner\nexperiences hitherto attained, the heights, depths, and distances\nof these experiences, the entire history of the soul UP TO THE\nPRESENT TIME, and its still unexhausted possibilities: this is\nthe preordained hunting-domain for a born psychologist and lover\nof a “big hunt”. But how often must he say despairingly to\nhimself: “A single individual! alas, only a single individual!\nand this great forest, this virgin forest!” So he would like to\nhave some hundreds of hunting assistants, and fine trained\nhounds, that he could send into the history of the human soul, to\ndrive HIS game together. In vain: again and again he experiences,\nprofoundly and bitterly, how difficult it is to find assistants\nand dogs for all the things that directly excite his curiosity.\nThe evil of sending scholars into new and dangerous hunting-\ndomains, where courage, sagacity, and subtlety in every sense are\nrequired, is that they are no longer serviceable just when the\n\"BIG hunt,” and also the great danger commences,—it is precisely\nthen that they lose their keen eye and nose. In order, for\ninstance, to divine and determine what sort of history the\nproblem of KNOWLEDGE AND CONSCIENCE has hitherto had in the souls\nof homines religiosi, a person would perhaps himself have to\npossess as profound, as bruised, as immense an experience as the\nintellectual conscience of Pascal; and then he would still\nrequire that wide-spread heaven of clear, wicked spirituality,\nwhich, from above, would be able to oversee, arrange, and\neffectively formulize this mass of dangerous and painful\nexperiences.—But who could do me this service! And who would\nhave time to wait for such servants!—they evidently appear too\nrarely, they are so improbable at all times! Eventually one must\ndo everything ONESELF in order to know something; which means\nthat one has MUCH to do!—But a curiosity like mine is once for\nall the most agreeable of vices—pardon me!

        "46. Faith, such as early Christianity desired, and not\ninfrequently achieved in the midst of a skeptical and southernly\nfree-spirited world, which had centuries of struggle between\nphilosophical schools behind it and in it, counting besides the\neducation in tolerance which the Imperium Romanum gave—this\nfaith is NOT that sincere, austere slave-faith by which perhaps a\nLuther or a Cromwell, or some other northern barbarian of the\nspirit remained attached to his God and Christianity, it is much\nrather the faith of Pascal, which resembles in a terrible manner\na continuous suicide of reason—a tough, long-lived, worm-like\nreason, which is not to be slain at once and with a single blow.\nThe Christian faith from the beginning, is sacrifice the\nsacrifice of all freedom, all pride, all self-confidence of\nspirit, it is at the same time subjection, self-derision, and\nself-mutilation. There is cruelty and religious Phoenicianism in\nthis faith, which is adapted to a tender, many-sided, and very\nfastidious conscience, it takes for granted that the subjection\nof the spirit is indescribably PAINFUL, that all the past and all\nthe habits of such a spirit resist the absurdissimum, in the form\nof which “faith” comes to it. Modern men, with their obtuseness\nas regards all Christian nomenclature, have no longer the sense\nfor the terribly superlative conception which was implied to an\nantique taste by the paradox of the formula, “God on the Cross”.\nHitherto there had never and nowhere been such boldness in\ninversion, nor anything at once so dreadful, questioning, and\nquestionable as this formula: it promised a transvaluation of all\nancient values—It was the Orient, the PROFOUND Orient, it was\nthe Oriental slave who thus took revenge on Rome and its noble,\nlight-minded toleration, on the Roman “Catholicism” of non-faith,\nand it was always not the faith, but the freedom from the faith,\nthe half-stoical and smiling indifference to the seriousness of\nthe faith, which made the slaves indignant at their masters and\nrevolt against them. “Enlightenment” causes revolt, for the slave\ndesires the unconditioned, he understands nothing but the\ntyrannous, even in morals, he loves as he hates, without NUANCE,\nto the very depths, to the point of pain, to the point of\nsickness—his many HIDDEN sufferings make him revolt against the\nnoble taste which seems to DENY suffering. The skepticism with\nregard to suffering, fundamentally only an attitude of\naristocratic morality, was not the least of the causes, also, of\nthe last great slave-insurrection which began with the French\nRevolution.",
        "47. Wherever the religious neurosis has appeared on the earth so\nfar, we find it connected with three dangerous prescriptions as\nto regimen: solitude, fasting, and sexual abstinence—but without\nits being possible to determine with certainty which is cause and\nwhich is effect, or IF any relation at all of cause and effect\nexists there. This latter doubt is justified by the fact that one\nof the most regular symptoms among savage as well as among\ncivilized peoples is the most sudden and excessive sensuality,\nwhich then with equal suddenness transforms into penitential\nparoxysms, world-renunciation, and will-renunciation, both\nsymptoms perhaps explainable as disguised epilepsy? But nowhere\nis it MORE obligatory to put aside explanations around no other\ntype has there grown such a mass of absurdity and superstition,\nno other type seems to have been more interesting to men and even\nto philosophers—perhaps it is time to become just a little\nindifferent here, to learn caution, or, better still, to look\nAWAY, TO GO AWAY—Yet in the background of the most recent\nphilosophy, that of Schopenhauer, we find almost as the problem\nin itself, this terrible note of interrogation of the religious\ncrisis and awakening. How is the negation of will POSSIBLE? how\nis the saint possible?—that seems to have been the very question\nwith which Schopenhauer made a start and became a philosopher.\nAnd thus it was a genuine Schopenhauerian consequence, that his\nmost convinced adherent (perhaps also his last, as far as Germany\nis concerned), namely, Richard Wagner, should bring his own life-\nwork to an end just here, and should finally put that terrible\nand eternal type upon the stage as Kundry, type vecu, and as it\nloved and lived, at the very time that the mad-doctors in almost\nall European countries had an opportunity to study the type close\nat hand, wherever the religious neurosis—or as I call it, “the\nreligious mood\"—made its latest epidemical outbreak and display\nas the “Salvation Army\"—If it be a question, however, as to what\nhas been so extremely interesting to men of all sorts in all\nages, and even to philosophers, in the whole phenomenon of the\nsaint, it is undoubtedly the appearance of the miraculous\ntherein—namely, the immediate SUCCESSION OF OPPOSITES, of states\nof the soul regarded as morally antithetical: it was believed\nhere to be self-evident that a “bad man” was all at once turned\ninto a “saint,” a good man. The hitherto existing psychology was\nwrecked at this point, is it not possible it may have happened\nprincipally because psychology had placed itself under the\ndominion of morals, because it BELIEVED in oppositions of moral\nvalues, and saw, read, and INTERPRETED these oppositions into the\ntext and facts of the case? What? “Miracle” only an error of\ninterpretation? A lack of philology?",
        "48. It seems that the Latin races are far more deeply attached to\ntheir Catholicism than we Northerners are to Christianity\ngenerally, and that consequently unbelief in Catholic countries\nmeans something quite different from what it does among\nProtestants—namely, a sort of revolt against the spirit of the\nrace, while with us it is rather a return to the spirit (or non-\nspirit) of the race.",
        "We Northerners undoubtedly derive our origin from barbarous\nraces, even as regards our talents for religion—we have POOR\ntalents for it. One may make an exception in the case of the\nCelts, who have theretofore furnished also the best soil for\nChristian infection in the North: the Christian ideal blossomed\nforth in France as much as ever the pale sun of the north would\nallow it. How strangely pious for our taste are still these later\nFrench skeptics, whenever there is any Celtic blood in their\norigin! How Catholic, how un-German does Auguste Comte’s\nSociology seem to us, with the Roman logic of its instincts! How\nJesuitical, that amiable and shrewd cicerone of Port Royal,\nSainte-Beuve, in spite of all his hostility to Jesuits! And even\nErnest Renan: how inaccessible to us Northerners does the\nlanguage of such a Renan appear, in whom every instant the merest\ntouch of religious thrill throws his refined voluptuous and\ncomfortably couching soul off its balance! Let us repeat after\nhim these fine sentences—and what wickedness and haughtiness is\nimmediately aroused by way of answer in our probably less\nbeautiful but harder souls, that is to say, in our more German\nsouls!—\"DISONS DONC HARDIMENT QUE LA RELIGION EST UN PRODUIT DE\nL’HOMME NORMAL, QUE L’HOMME EST LE PLUS DANS LE VRAI QUANT IL EST\nLE PLUS RELIGIEUX ET LE PLUS ASSURE D’UNE DESTINEE INFINIE. . . .\nC’EST QUAND IL EST BON QU’IL VEUT QUE LA VIRTU CORRESPONDE A UN\nORDER ETERNAL, C’EST QUAND IL CONTEMPLE LES CHOSES D’UNE MANIERE\nDESINTERESSEE QU’IL TROUVE LA MORT REVOLTANTE ET ABSURDE.

There is an\nOriental exaltation of the mind in it, like that of an\nundeservedly favoured or elevated slave, as in the case of St.\nAugustine, for instance, who lacks in an offensive manner, all\nnobility in bearing and desires. There is a feminine tenderness\nand sensuality in it, which modestly and unconsciously longs for\na UNIO MYSTICA ET PHYSICA, as in the case of Madame de Guyon. In\nmany cases it appears, curiously enough, as the disguise of a\ngirl’s or youth’s puberty; here and there even as the hysteria of\nan old maid, also as her last ambition. The Church has frequently\ncanonized the woman in such a case.",
        "51. The mightiest men have hitherto always bowed reverently\nbefore the saint, as the enigma of self-subjugation and utter\nvoluntary privation—why did they thus bow? They divined in him—\nand as it were behind the questionableness of his frail and\nwretched appearance—the superior force which wished to test\nitself by such a subjugation; the strength of will, in which they\nrecognized their own strength and love of power, and knew how to\nhonour it: they honoured something in themselves when they\nhonoured the saint. In addition to this, the contemplation of the\nsaint suggested to them a suspicion: such an enormity of self-\nnegation and anti-naturalness will not have been coveted for\nnothing—they have said, inquiringly. There is perhaps a reason\nfor it, some very great danger, about which the ascetic might\nwish to be more accurately informed through his secret\ninterlocutors and visitors? In a word, the mighty ones of the\nworld learned to have a new fear before him, they divined a new\npower, a strange, still unconquered enemy:—it was the “Will to\nPower” which obliged them to halt before the saint. They had to\nquestion him.",
        "52. In the Jewish “Old Testament,” the book of divine justice,\nthere are men, things, and sayings on such an immense scale, that\nGreek and Indian literature has nothing to compare with it. One\nstands with fear and reverence before those stupendous remains of\nwhat man was formerly, and one has sad thoughts about old Asia\nand its little out-pushed peninsula Europe, which would like, by\nall means, to figure before Asia as the “Progress of Mankind.” To\nbe sure, he who is himself only a slender, tame house-animal, and\nknows only the wants of a house-animal (like our cultured people\nof today, including the Christians of “cultured” Christianity),\nneed neither be amazed nor even sad amid those ruins—the taste\nfor the Old Testament is a touchstone with respect to “great” and\n\"small”: perhaps he will find that the New Testament, the book of\ngrace, still appeals more to his heart (there is much of the\nodour of the genuine, tender, stupid beadsman and petty soul in\nit). To have bound up this New Testament (a kind of ROCOCO of\ntaste in every respect) along with the Old Testament into one\nbook, as the “Bible,” as “The Book in Itself,” is perhaps the\ngreatest audacity and “sin against the Spirit” which literary\nEurope has upon its conscience.",
        "53. Why Atheism nowadays? “The father” in God is thoroughly\nrefuted; equally so “the judge,” “the rewarder.” Also his “free\nwill”: he does not hear—and even if he did, he would not know\nhow to help. The worst is that he seems incapable of\ncommunicating himself clearly; is he uncertain?—This is what I\nhave made out (by questioning and listening at a variety of\nconversations) to be the cause of the decline of European theism;\nit appears to me that though the religious instinct is in\nvigorous growth,—it rejects the theistic satisfaction with\nprofound distrust.",
        "54. What does all modern philosophy mainly do? Since Descartes—\nand indeed more in defiance of him than on the basis of his\nprocedure—an ATTENTAT has been made on the part of all\nphilosophers on the old conception of the soul, under the guise\nof a criticism of the subject and predicate conception—that is\nto say, an ATTENTAT on the fundamental presupposition of\nChristian doctrine. Modern philosophy, as epistemological\nskepticism, is secretly or openly ANTI-CHRISTIAN, although (for\nkeener ears, be it said) by no means anti-religious. Formerly, in\neffect, one believed in “the soul” as one believed in grammar and\nthe grammatical subject: one said, “I” is the condition, “think\"\nis the predicate and is conditioned—to think is an activity for\nwhich one MUST suppose a subject as cause. The attempt was then\nmade, with marvelous tenacity and subtlety, to see if one could\nnot get out of this net,—to see if the opposite was not perhaps\ntrue: “think” the condition, and “I” the conditioned; “I,\"\ntherefore, only a synthesis which has been MADE by thinking\nitself. KANT really wished to prove that, starting from the\nsubject, the subject could not be proved—nor the object either:\nthe possibility of an APPARENT EXISTENCE of the subject, and\ntherefore of “the soul,” may not always have been strange to\nhim,—the thought which once had an immense power on earth as the\nVedanta philosophy.",
        "55. There is a great ladder of religious cruelty, with many\nrounds; but three of these are the most important. Once on a time\nmen sacrificed human beings to their God, and perhaps just those\nthey loved the best—to this category belong the firstling\nsacrifices of all primitive religions, and also the sacrifice of\nthe Emperor Tiberius in the Mithra-Grotto on the Island of Capri,\nthat most terrible of all Roman anachronisms. Then, during the\nmoral epoch of mankind, they sacrificed to their God the\nstrongest instincts they possessed, their “nature\"; THIS festal\njoy shines in the cruel glances of ascetics and “anti-natural\"\nfanatics. Finally, what still remained to be sacrificed? Was it\nnot necessary in the end for men to sacrifice everything\ncomforting, holy, healing, all hope, all faith in hidden\nharmonies, in future blessedness and justice? Was it not\nnecessary to sacrifice God himself, and out of cruelty to\nthemselves to worship stone, stupidity, gravity, fate,\nnothingness? To sacrifice God for nothingness—this paradoxical\nmystery of the ultimate cruelty has been reserved for the rising\ngeneration; we all know something thereof already.",
        "56. Whoever, like myself, prompted by some enigmatical desire,\nhas long endeavoured to go to the bottom of the question of\npessimism and free it from the half-Christian, half-German\nnarrowness and stupidity in which it has finally presented itself\nto this century, namely, in the form of Schopenhauer’s\nphilosophy; whoever, with an Asiatic and super-Asiatic eye, has\nactually looked inside, and into the most world-renouncing of all\npossible modes of thought—beyond good and evil, and no longer\nlike Buddha and Schopenhauer, under the dominion and delusion of\nmorality,—whoever has done this, has perhaps just thereby,\nwithout really desiring it, opened his eyes to behold the\nopposite ideal: the ideal of the most world-approving, exuberant,\nand vivacious man, who has not only learnt to compromise and\narrange with that which was and is, but wishes to have it again\nAS IT WAS AND IS, for all eternity, insatiably calling out de\ncapo, not only to himself, but to the whole piece and play; and\nnot only the play, but actually to him who requires the play—and\nmakes it necessary; because he always requires himself anew—and\nmakes himself necessary.—What? And this would not be—circulus\nvitiosus deus?",
        "57. The distance, and as it were the space around man, grows with\nthe strength of his intellectual vision and insight: his world\nbecomes profounder; new stars, new enigmas, and notions are ever\ncoming into view. Perhaps everything on which the intellectual\neye has exercised its acuteness and profundity has just been an\noccasion for its exercise, something of a game, something for\nchildren and childish minds. Perhaps the most solemn conceptions\nthat have caused the most fighting and suffering, the conceptions\n\"God” and “sin,” will one day seem to us of no more importance\nthan a child’s plaything or a child’s pain seems to an old man;—\nand perhaps another plaything and another pain will then be\nnecessary once more for “the old man\"—always childish enough, an\neternal child!",
        "58. Has it been observed to what extent outward idleness, or\nsemi-idleness, is necessary to a real religious life (alike for\nits favourite microscopic labour of self-examination, and for its\nsoft placidity called “prayer,” the state of perpetual readiness\nfor the “coming of God”), I mean the idleness with a good\nconscience, the idleness of olden times and of blood, to which\nthe aristocratic sentiment that work is DISHONOURING—that it\nvulgarizes body and soul—is not quite unfamiliar? And that\nconsequently the modern, noisy, time-engrossing, conceited,\nfoolishly proud laboriousness educates and prepares for\n\"unbelief” more than anything else? Among these, for instance,\nwho are at present living apart from religion in Germany, I find\n\"free-thinkers” of diversified species and origin, but above all\na majority of those in whom laboriousness from generation to\ngeneration has dissolved the religious instincts; so that they no\nlonger know what purpose religions serve, and only note their\nexistence in the world with a kind of dull astonishment. They\nfeel themselves already fully occupied, these good people, be it\nby their business or by their pleasures, not to mention the\n\"Fatherland,” and the newspapers, and their “family duties\"; it\nseems that they have no time whatever left for religion; and\nabove all, it is not obvious to them whether it is a question of\na new business or a new pleasure—for it is impossible, they say\nto themselves, that people should go to church merely to spoil\ntheir tempers. They are by no means enemies of religious customs;\nshould certain circumstances, State affairs perhaps, require\ntheir participation in such customs, they do what is required, as\nso many things are done—with a patient and unassuming\nseriousness, and without much curiosity or discomfort;—they live\ntoo much apart and outside to feel even the necessity for a FOR\nor AGAINST in such matters. Among those indifferent persons may\nbe reckoned nowadays the majority of German Protestants of the\nmiddle classes, especially in the great laborious centres of\ntrade and commerce; also the majority of laborious scholars, and\nthe entire University personnel (with the exception of the\ntheologians, whose existence and possibility there always gives\npsychologists new and more subtle puzzles to solve). On the part\nof pious, or merely church-going people, there is seldom any idea\nof HOW MUCH good-will, one might say arbitrary will, is now\nnecessary for a German scholar to take the problem of religion\nseriously; his whole profession (and as I have said, his whole\nworkmanlike laboriousness, to which he is compelled by his modern\nconscience) inclines him to a lofty and almost charitable\nserenity as regards religion, with which is occasionally mingled\na slight disdain for the “uncleanliness” of spirit which he takes\nfor granted wherever any one still professes to belong to the\nChurch. It is only with the help of history (NOT through his own\npersonal experience, therefore) that the scholar succeeds in\nbringing himself to a respectful seriousness, and to a certain\ntimid deference in presence of religions; but even when his\nsentiments have reached the stage of gratitude towards them, he\nhas not personally advanced one step nearer to that which still\nmaintains itself as Church or as piety; perhaps even the\ncontrary. The practical indifference to religious matters in the\nmidst of which he has been born and brought up, usually\nsublimates itself in his case into circumspection and\ncleanliness, which shuns contact with religious men and things;\nand it may be just the depth of his tolerance and humanity which\nprompts him to avoid the delicate trouble which tolerance itself\nbrings with it.—Every age has its own divine type of naivete,\nfor the discovery of which other ages may envy it: and how much\nnaivete—adorable, childlike, and boundlessly foolish naivete is\ninvolved in this belief of the scholar in his superiority, in the\ngood conscience of his tolerance, in the unsuspecting, simple\ncertainty with which his instinct treats the religious man as a\nlower and less valuable type, beyond, before, and ABOVE which he\nhimself has developed—he, the little arrogant dwarf and mob-man,\nthe sedulously alert, head-and-hand drudge of “ideas,” of “modern\nideas”!",
        "59. Whoever has seen deeply into the world has doubtless divined\nwhat wisdom there is in the fact that men are superficial. It is\ntheir preservative instinct which teaches them to be flighty,\nlightsome, and false. Here and there one finds a passionate and\nexaggerated adoration of “pure forms” in philosophers as well as\nin artists: it is not to be doubted that whoever has NEED of the\ncult of the superficial to that extent, has at one time or\nanother made an unlucky dive BENEATH it. Perhaps there is even an\norder of rank with respect to those burnt children, the born\nartists who find the enjoyment of life only in trying to FALSIFY\nits image (as if taking wearisome revenge on it), one might guess\nto what degree life has disgusted them, by the extent to which\nthey wish to see its image falsified, attenuated, ultrified, and\ndeified,—one might reckon the homines religiosi among the\nartists, as their HIGHEST rank. It is the profound, suspicious\nfear of an incurable pessimism which compels whole centuries to\nfasten their teeth into a religious interpretation of existence:\nthe fear of the instinct which divines that truth might be\nattained TOO soon, before man has become strong enough, hard\nenough, artist enough. . . . Piety, the “Life in God,” regarded in\nthis light, would appear as the most elaborate and ultimate\nproduct of the FEAR of truth, as artist-adoration and artist-\nintoxication in presence of the most logical of all\nfalsifications, as the will to the inversion of truth, to untruth\nat any price. Perhaps there has hitherto been no more effective\nmeans of beautifying man than piety, by means of it man can\nbecome so artful, so superficial, so iridescent, and so good,\nthat his appearance no longer offends.",
        "60. To love mankind FOR GOD’S SAKE—this has so far been the\nnoblest and remotest sentiment to which mankind has attained.\nThat love to mankind, without any redeeming intention in the\nbackground, is only an ADDITIONAL folly and brutishness, that the\ninclination to this love has first to get its proportion, its\ndelicacy, its gram of salt and sprinkling of ambergris from a\nhigher inclination—whoever first perceived and “experienced\"\nthis, however his tongue may have stammered as it attempted to\nexpress such a delicate matter, let him for all time be holy and\nrespected, as the man who has so far flown highest and gone\nastray in the finest fashion!",
        "61. The philosopher, as WE free spirits understand him—as the\nman of the greatest responsibility, who has the conscience for\nthe general development of mankind,—will use religion for his\ndisciplining and educating work, just as he will use the\ncontemporary political and economic conditions. The selecting and\ndisciplining influence—destructive, as well as creative and\nfashioning—which can be exercised by means of religion is\nmanifold and varied, according to the sort of people placed under\nits spell and protection. For those who are strong and\nindependent, destined and trained to command, in whom the\njudgment and skill of a ruling race is incorporated, religion is\nan additional means for overcoming resistance in the exercise of\nauthority—as a bond which binds rulers and subjects in common,\nbetraying and surrendering to the former the conscience of the\nlatter, their inmost heart, which would fain escape obedience.\nAnd in the case of the unique natures of noble origin, if by\nvirtue of superior spirituality they should incline to a more\nretired and contemplative life, reserving to themselves only the\nmore refined forms of government (over chosen disciples or\nmembers of an order), religion itself may be used as a means for\nobtaining peace from the noise and trouble of managing GROSSER\naffairs, and for securing immunity from the UNAVOIDABLE filth of\nall political agitation. The Brahmins, for instance, understood\nthis fact. With the help of a religious organization, they\nsecured to themselves the power of nominating kings for the\npeople, while their sentiments prompted them to keep apart and\noutside, as men with a higher and super-regal mission. At the\nsame time religion gives inducement and opportunity to some of\nthe subjects to qualify themselves for future ruling and\ncommanding the slowly ascending ranks and classes, in which,\nthrough fortunate marriage customs, volitional power and delight\nin self-control are on the increase. To them religion offers\nsufficient incentives and temptations to aspire to higher\nintellectuality, and to experience the sentiments of\nauthoritative self-control, of silence, and of solitude.\nAsceticism and Puritanism are almost indispensable means of\neducating and ennobling a race which seeks to rise above its\nhereditary baseness and work itself upwards to future supremacy.\nAnd finally, to ordinary men, to the majority of the people, who\nexist for service and general utility, and are only so far\nentitled to exist, religion gives invaluable contentedness with\ntheir lot and condition, peace of heart, ennoblement of\nobedience, additional social happiness and sympathy, with\nsomething of transfiguration and embellishment, something of\njustification of all the commonplaceness, all the meanness, all\nthe semi-animal poverty of their souls. Religion, together with\nthe religious significance of life, sheds sunshine over such\nperpetually harassed men, and makes even their own aspect\nendurable to them, it operates upon them as the Epicurean\nphilosophy usually operates upon sufferers of a higher order, in\na refreshing and refining manner, almost TURNING suffering TO\nACCOUNT, and in the end even hallowing and vindicating it. There\nis perhaps nothing so admirable in Christianity and Buddhism as\ntheir art of teaching even the lowest to elevate themselves by\npiety to a seemingly higher order of things, and thereby to\nretain their satisfaction with the actual world in which they\nfind it difficult enough to live—this very difficulty being\nnecessary.",
        "62. To be sure—to make also the bad counter-reckoning against\nsuch religions, and to bring to light their secret dangers—the\ncost is always excessive and terrible when religions do NOT\noperate as an educational and disciplinary medium in the hands of\nthe philosopher, but rule voluntarily and PARAMOUNTLY, when they\nwish to be the final end, and not a means along with other means.\nAmong men, as among all other animals, there is a surplus of\ndefective, diseased, degenerating, infirm, and necessarily\nsuffering individuals; the successful cases, among men also, are\nalways the exception; and in view of the fact that man is THE\nANIMAL NOT YET PROPERLY ADAPTED TO HIS ENVIRONMENT, the rare\nexception. But worse still. The higher the type a man represents,\nthe greater is the improbability that he will SUCCEED; the\naccidental, the law of irrationality in the general constitution\nof mankind, manifests itself most terribly in its destructive\neffect on the higher orders of men, the conditions of whose lives\nare delicate, diverse, and difficult to determine. What, then, is\nthe attitude of the two greatest religions above-mentioned to the\nSURPLUS of failures in life? They endeavour to preserve and keep\nalive whatever can be preserved; in fact, as the religions FOR\nSUFFERERS, they take the part of these upon principle; they are\nalways in favour of those who suffer from life as from a disease,\nand they would fain treat every other experience of life as false\nand impossible. However highly we may esteem this indulgent and\npreservative care (inasmuch as in applying to others, it has\napplied, and applies also to the highest and usually the most\nsuffering type of man), the hitherto PARAMOUNT religions—to give\na general appreciation of them—are among the principal causes\nwhich have kept the type of “man” upon a lower level—they have\npreserved too much THAT WHICH SHOULD HAVE PERISHED. One has to\nthank them for invaluable services; and who is sufficiently rich\nin gratitude not to feel poor at the contemplation of all that\nthe “spiritual men” of Christianity have done for Europe\nhitherto! But when they had given comfort to the sufferers,\ncourage to the oppressed and despairing, a staff and support to\nthe helpless, and when they had allured from society into\nconvents and spiritual penitentiaries the broken-hearted and\ndistracted: what else had they to do in order to work\nsystematically in that fashion, and with a good conscience, for\nthe preservation of all the sick and suffering, which means, in\ndeed and in truth, to work for the DETERIORATION OF THE EUROPEAN\nRACE? To REVERSE all estimates of value—THAT is what they had to\ndo! And to shatter the strong, to spoil great hopes, to cast\nsuspicion on the delight in beauty, to break down everything\nautonomous, manly, conquering, and imperious—all instincts which\nare natural to the highest and most successful type of “man\"—\ninto uncertainty, distress of conscience, and self-destruction;\nforsooth, to invert all love of the earthly and of supremacy over\nthe earth, into hatred of the earth and earthly things—THAT is\nthe task the Church imposed on itself, and was obliged to impose,\nuntil, according to its standard of value, “unworldliness,\"\n\"unsensuousness,” and “higher man” fused into one sentiment. If\none could observe the strangely painful, equally coarse and\nrefined comedy of European Christianity with the derisive and\nimpartial eye of an Epicurean god, I should think one would never\ncease marvelling and laughing; does it not actually seem that\nsome single will has ruled over Europe for eighteen centuries in\norder to make a SUBLIME ABORTION of man? He, however, who, with\nopposite requirements (no longer Epicurean) and with some divine\nhammer in his hand, could approach this almost voluntary\ndegeneration and stunting of mankind, as exemplified in the\nEuropean Christian (Pascal, for instance), would he not have to\ncry aloud with rage, pity, and horror: “Oh, you bunglers,\npresumptuous pitiful bunglers, what have you done! Was that a\nwork for your hands? How you have hacked and botched my finest\nstone! What have you presumed to do!\"—I should say that\nChristianity has hitherto been the most portentous of\npresumptions. Men, not great enough, nor hard enough, to be\nentitled as artists to take part in fashioning MAN; men, not\nsufficiently strong and far-sighted to ALLOW, with sublime self-\nconstraint, the obvious law of the thousandfold failures and\nperishings to prevail; men, not sufficiently noble to see the\nradically different grades of rank and intervals of rank that\nseparate man from man:—SUCH men, with their “equality before\nGod,” have hitherto swayed the destiny of Europe; until at last a\ndwarfed, almost ludicrous species has been produced, a gregarious\nanimal, something obliging, sickly, mediocre, the European of the\npresent day.",

        "\n186. The moral sentiment in Europe at present is perhaps as\nsubtle, belated, diverse, sensitive, and refined, as the “Science\nof Morals” belonging thereto is recent, initial, awkward, and\ncoarse-fingered:—an interesting contrast, which sometimes\nbecomes incarnate and obvious in the very person of a moralist.\nIndeed, the expression, “Science of Morals” is, in respect to\nwhat is designated thereby, far too presumptuous and counter to\nGOOD taste,—which is always a foretaste of more modest\nexpressions. One ought to avow with the utmost fairness WHAT is\nstill necessary here for a long time, WHAT is alone proper for\nthe present: namely, the collection of material, the\ncomprehensive survey and classification of an immense domain of\ndelicate sentiments of worth, and distinctions of worth, which\nlive, grow, propagate, and perish—and perhaps attempts to give a\nclear idea of the recurring and more common forms of these living\ncrystallizations—as preparation for a THEORY OF TYPES of\nmorality. To be sure, people have not hitherto been so modest.\nAll the philosophers, with a pedantic and ridiculous seriousness,\ndemanded of themselves something very much higher, more\npretentious, and ceremonious, when they concerned themselves with\nmorality as a science: they wanted to GIVE A BASIC to morality—\nand every philosopher hitherto has believed that he has given it\na basis; morality itself, however, has been regarded as something\n\"given.”  How far from their awkward pride was the seemingly\ninsignificant problem—left in dust and decay—of a description\nof forms of morality, notwithstanding that the finest hands and\nsenses could hardly be fine enough for it! It was precisely owing\nto moral philosophers’ knowing the moral facts imperfectly, in an\narbitrary epitome, or an accidental abridgement—perhaps as the\nmorality of their environment, their position, their church,\ntheir Zeitgeist, their climate and zone—it was precisely because\nthey were badly instructed with regard to nations, eras, and past\nages, and were by no means eager to know about these matters,\nthat they did not even come in sight of the real problems of\nmorals—problems which only disclose themselves by a comparison\nof MANY kinds of morality. In every “Science of Morals” hitherto,\nstrange as it may sound, the problem of morality itself has been\nOMITTED: there has been no suspicion that there was anything\nproblematic there! That which philosophers called “giving a basis\nto morality,” and endeavoured to realize, has, when seen in a\nright light, proved merely a learned form of good FAITH in\nprevailing morality, a new means of its EXPRESSION, consequently\njust a matter-of-fact within the sphere of a definite morality,\nyea, in its ultimate motive, a sort of denial that it is LAWFUL\nfor this morality to be called in question—and in any case the\nreverse of the testing, analyzing, doubting, and vivisecting of\nthis very faith. Hear, for instance, with what innocence—almost\nworthy of honour—Schopenhauer represents his own task, and draw\nyour conclusions concerning the scientificness of a “Science\"\nwhose latest master still talks in the strain of children and old\nwives: “The principle,” he says (page 136 of the Grundprobleme\nder Ethik), [Footnote: Pages 54-55 of Schopenhauer’s Basis of\nMorality, translated by Arthur B. Bullock, M.A. (1903).] “the\naxiom about the purport of which all moralists are PRACTICALLY\nagreed: neminem laede, immo omnes quantum potes juva—is REALLY\nthe proposition which all moral teachers strive to establish,\n. . . the REAL basis of ethics which has been sought, like\nthe philosopher’s stone, for centuries.\"—The difficulty of\nestablishing the proposition referred to may indeed be great—it\nis well known that Schopenhauer also was unsuccessful in his\nefforts; and whoever has thoroughly realized how absurdly false\nand sentimental this proposition is, in a world whose essence is\nWill to Power, may be reminded that Schopenhauer, although a\npessimist, ACTUALLY—played the flute . . . daily after dinner:\none may read about the matter in his biography. A question by the\nway: a pessimist, a repudiator of God and of the world, who MAKES\nA HALT at morality—who assents to morality, and plays the flute\nto laede-neminem morals, what? Is that really—a pessimist?",
        "187. Apart from the value of such assertions as “there is a\ncategorical imperative in us,” one can always ask: What does such\nan assertion indicate about him who makes it? There are systems\nof morals which are meant to justify their author in the eyes of\nother people; other systems of morals are meant to tranquilize\nhim, and make him self-satisfied; with other systems he wants to\ncrucify and humble himself, with others he wishes to take revenge,\nwith others to conceal himself, with others to glorify himself and\ngave superiority and distinction,—this system of morals helps its\nauthor to forget, that system makes him, or something of him,\nforgotten, many a moralist would like to exercise power and\ncreative arbitrariness over mankind, many another, perhaps, Kant\nespecially, gives us to understand by his morals that “what is\nestimable in me, is that I know how to obey—and with you it SHALL\nnot be otherwise than with me!” In short, systems of morals are\nonly a SIGN-LANGUAGE OF THE EMOTIONS.",
        "188. In contrast to laisser-aller, every system of morals is a\nsort of tyranny against “nature” and also against “reason”, that\nis, however, no objection, unless one should again decree by some\nsystem of morals, that all kinds of tyranny and unreasonableness\nare unlawful What is essential and invaluable in every system of\nmorals, is that it is a long constraint. In order to understand\nStoicism, or Port Royal, or Puritanism, one should remember the\nconstraint under which every language has attained to strength\nand freedom—the metrical constraint, the tyranny of rhyme and\nrhythm. How much trouble have the poets and orators of every\nnation given themselves!—not excepting some of the prose writers\nof today, in whose ear dwells an inexorable conscientiousness—\n\"for the sake of a folly,” as utilitarian bunglers say, and\nthereby deem themselves wise—\"from submission to arbitrary\nlaws,” as the anarchists say, and thereby fancy themselves\n\"free,” even free-spirited. The singular fact remains, however,\nthat everything of the nature of freedom, elegance, boldness,\ndance, and masterly certainty, which exists or has existed,\nwhether it be in thought itself, or in administration, or in\nspeaking and persuading, in art just as in conduct, has only\ndeveloped by means of the tyranny of such arbitrary law, and in\nall seriousness, it is not at all improbable that precisely this\nis “nature” and “natural\"—and not laisser-aller! Every artist\nknows how different from the state of letting himself go, is his\n\"most natural” condition, the free arranging, locating,\ndisposing, and constructing in the moments of “inspiration\"—and\nhow strictly and delicately he then obeys a thousand laws, which,\nby their very rigidness and precision, defy all formulation by\nmeans of ideas (even the most stable idea has, in comparison\ntherewith, something floating, manifold, and ambiguous in it).\nThe essential thing “in heaven and in earth” is, apparently (to\nrepeat it once more), that there should be long OBEDIENCE in the\nsame direction, there thereby results, and has always resulted in\nthe long run, something which has made life worth living; for\ninstance, virtue, art, music, dancing, reason, spirituality—\nanything whatever that is transfiguring, refined, foolish, or\ndivine. The long bondage of the spirit, the distrustful\nconstraint in the communicability of ideas, the discipline which\nthe thinker imposed on himself to think in accordance with the\nrules of a church or a court, or conformable to Aristotelian\npremises, the persistent spiritual will to interpret everything\nthat happened according to a Christian scheme, and in every\noccurrence to rediscover and justify the Christian God:—all this\nviolence, arbitrariness, severity, dreadfulness, and\nunreasonableness, has proved itself the disciplinary means\nwhereby the European spirit has attained its strength, its\nremorseless curiosity and subtle mobility; granted also that much\nirrecoverable strength and spirit had to be stifled, suffocated,\nand spoilt in the process (for here, as everywhere, “nature\"\nshows herself as she is, in all her extravagant and INDIFFERENT\nmagnificence, which is shocking, but nevertheless noble). That\nfor centuries European thinkers only thought in order to prove\nsomething-nowadays, on the contrary, we are suspicious of every\nthinker who “wishes to prove something\"—that it was always\nsettled beforehand what WAS TO BE the result of their strictest\nthinking, as it was perhaps in the Asiatic astrology of former\ntimes, or as it is still at the present day in the innocent,\nChristian-moral explanation of immediate personal events “for the\nglory of God,” or “for the good of the soul”:—this tyranny, this\narbitrariness, this severe and magnificent stupidity, has\nEDUCATED the spirit; slavery, both in the coarser and the finer\nsense, is apparently an indispensable means even of spiritual\neducation and discipline. One may look at every system of morals\nin this light: it is “nature” therein which teaches to hate the\nlaisser-aller, the too great freedom, and implants the need for\nlimited horizons, for immediate duties—it teaches the NARROWING\nOF PERSPECTIVES, and thus, in a certain sense, that stupidity is\na condition of life and development. “Thou must obey some one,\nand for a long time; OTHERWISE thou wilt come to grief, and lose\nall respect for thyself\"—this seems to me to be the moral\nimperative of nature, which is certainly neither “categorical,\"\nas old Kant wished (consequently the “otherwise”), nor does it\naddress itself to the individual (what does nature care for the\nindividual!), but to nations, races, ages, and ranks; above all,\nhowever, to the animal “man” generally, to MANKIND.",
        "189. Industrious races find it a great hardship to be idle: it\nwas a master stroke of ENGLISH instinct to hallow and begloom\nSunday to such an extent that the Englishman unconsciously\nhankers for his week—and work-day again:—as a kind of cleverly\ndevised, cleverly intercalated FAST, such as is also frequently\nfound in the ancient world (although, as is appropriate in\nsouthern nations, not precisely with respect to work). Many kinds\nof fasts are necessary; and wherever powerful influences and\nhabits prevail, legislators have to see that intercalary days are\nappointed, on which such impulses are fettered, and learn to\nhunger anew. Viewed from a higher standpoint, whole generations\nand epochs, when they show themselves infected with any moral\nfanaticism, seem like those intercalated periods of restraint and\nfasting, during which an impulse learns to humble and submit\nitself—at the same time also to PURIFY and SHARPEN itself;\ncertain philosophical sects likewise admit of a similar\ninterpretation (for instance, the Stoa, in the midst of Hellenic\nculture, with the atmosphere rank and overcharged with\nAphrodisiacal odours).—Here also is a hint for the explanation\nof the paradox, why it was precisely in the most Christian period\nof European history, and in general only under the pressure of\nChristian sentiments, that the sexual impulse sublimated into\nlove (amour-passion).",
        "190. There is something in the morality of Plato which does not\nreally belong to Plato, but which only appears in his philosophy,\none might say, in spite of him: namely, Socratism, for which he\nhimself was too noble. “No one desires to injure himself, hence\nall evil is done unwittingly. The evil man inflicts injury on\nhimself; he would not do so, however, if he knew that evil is\nevil. The evil man, therefore, is only evil through error; if one\nfree him from error one will necessarily make him—good.\"—This\nmode of reasoning savours of the POPULACE, who perceive only the\nunpleasant consequences of evil-doing, and practically judge that\n\"it is STUPID to do wrong\"; while they accept “good” as identical\nwith “useful and pleasant,” without further thought. As regards\nevery system of utilitarianism, one may at once assume that it\nhas the same origin, and follow the scent: one will seldom err.—\nPlato did all he could to interpret something refined and noble\ninto the tenets of his teacher, and above all to interpret\nhimself into them—he, the most daring of all interpreters, who\nlifted the entire Socrates out of the street, as a popular theme\nand song, to exhibit him in endless and impossible modifications\n—namely, in all his own disguises and multiplicities. In jest,\nand in Homeric language as well, what is the Platonic Socrates,\nif not— [Greek words inserted here.]",
        "191. The old theological problem of “Faith” and “Knowledge,” or\nmore plainly, of instinct and reason—the question whether, in\nrespect to the valuation of things, instinct deserves more\nauthority than rationality, which wants to appreciate and act\naccording to motives, according to a “Why,” that is to say, in\nconformity to purpose and utility—it is always the old moral\nproblem that first appeared in the person of Socrates, and had\ndivided men’s minds long before Christianity. Socrates himself,\nfollowing, of course, the taste of his talent—that of a\nsurpassing dialectician—took first the side of reason; and, in\nfact, what did he do all his life but laugh at the awkward\nincapacity of the noble Athenians, who were men of instinct, like\nall noble men, and could never give satisfactory answers\nconcerning the motives of their actions? In the end, however,\nthough silently and secretly, he laughed also at himself: with\nhis finer conscience and introspection, he found in himself the\nsame difficulty and incapacity. “But why\"—he said to himself—\n\"should one on that account separate oneself from the instincts!\nOne must set them right, and the reason ALSO—one must follow the\ninstincts, but at the same time persuade the reason to support\nthem with good arguments.” This was the real FALSENESS of that\ngreat and mysterious ironist; he brought his conscience up to the\npoint that he was satisfied with a kind of self-outwitting: in\nfact, he perceived the irrationality in the moral judgment.—\nPlato, more innocent in such matters, and without the craftiness\nof the plebeian, wished to prove to himself, at the expenditure\nof all his strength—the greatest strength a philosopher had ever\nexpended—that reason and instinct lead spontaneously to one\ngoal, to the good, to “God\"; and since Plato, all theologians and\nphilosophers have followed the same path—which means that in\nmatters of morality, instinct (or as Christians call it, “Faith,\"\nor as I call it, “the herd”) has hitherto triumphed. Unless one\nshould make an exception in the case of Descartes, the father of\nrationalism (and consequently the grandfather of the Revolution),\nwho recognized only the authority of reason: but reason is only a\ntool, and Descartes was superficial.",
        "192. Whoever has followed the history of a single science, finds\nin its development a clue to the understanding of the oldest and\ncommonest processes of all “knowledge and cognizance”: there, as\nhere, the premature hypotheses, the fictions, the good stupid\nwill to “belief,” and the lack of distrust and patience are first\ndeveloped—our senses learn late, and never learn completely, to\nbe subtle, reliable, and cautious organs of knowledge. Our eyes\nfind it easier on a given occasion to produce a picture already\noften produced, than to seize upon the divergence and novelty of\nan impression: the latter requires more force, more “morality.\"\nIt is difficult and painful for the ear to listen to anything\nnew; we hear strange music badly. When we hear another language\nspoken, we involuntarily attempt to form the sounds into words\nwith which we are more familiar and conversant—it was thus, for\nexample, that the Germans modified the spoken word ARCUBALISTA\ninto ARMBRUST (cross-bow). Our senses are also hostile and averse\nto the new; and generally, even in the “simplest” processes of\nsensation, the emotions DOMINATE—such as fear, love, hatred, and\nthe passive emotion of indolence.—As little as a reader nowadays\nreads all the single words (not to speak of syllables) of a page\n—he rather takes about five out of every twenty words at random,\nand “guesses” the probably appropriate sense to them—just as\nlittle do we see a tree correctly and completely in respect to\nits leaves, branches, colour, and shape; we find it so much\neasier to fancy the chance of a tree. Even in the midst of the\nmost remarkable experiences, we still do just the same; we\nfabricate the greater part of the experience, and can hardly be\nmade to contemplate any event, EXCEPT as “inventors” thereof. All\nthis goes to prove that from our fundamental nature and from\nremote ages we have been—ACCUSTOMED TO LYING. Or, to express it\nmore politely and hypocritically, in short, more pleasantly—one\nis much more of an artist than one is aware of.—In an animated\nconversation, I often see the face of the person with whom I am\nspeaking so clearly and sharply defined before me, according to\nthe thought he expresses, or which I believe to be evoked in his\nmind, that the degree of distinctness far exceeds the STRENGTH of\nmy visual faculty—the delicacy of the play of the muscles and of\nthe expression of the eyes MUST therefore be imagined by me.\nProbably the person put on quite a different expression, or none\nat all.",

Quidquid luce fuit, tenebris agit: but also contrariwise.\nWhat we experience in dreams, provided we experience it often,\npertains at last just as much to the general belongings of our\nsoul as anything “actually” experienced; by virtue thereof we are\nricher or poorer, we have a requirement more or less, and\nfinally, in broad daylight, and even in the brightest moments of\nour waking life, we are ruled to some extent by the nature of our\ndreams. Supposing that someone has often flown in his dreams, and\nthat at last, as soon as he dreams, he is conscious of the power\nand art of flying as his privilege and his peculiarly enviable\nhappiness; such a person, who believes that on the slightest\nimpulse, he can actualize all sorts of curves and angles, who\nknows the sensation of a certain divine levity, an “upwards\"\nwithout effort or constraint, a “downwards” without descending or\nlowering—without TROUBLE!—how could the man with such dream-\nexperiences and dream-habits fail to find “happiness” differently\ncoloured and defined, even in his waking hours! How could he\nfail—to long DIFFERENTLY for happiness? “Flight,” such as is\ndescribed by poets, must, when compared with his own “flying,” be\nfar too earthly, muscular, violent, far too “troublesome” for\nhim.",
        "194. The difference among men does not manifest itself only in\nthe difference of their lists of desirable things—in their\nregarding different good things as worth striving for, and being\ndisagreed as to the greater or less value, the order of rank, of\nthe commonly recognized desirable things:—it manifests itself\nmuch more in what they regard as actually HAVING and POSSESSING a\ndesirable thing. As regards a woman, for instance, the control\nover her body and her sexual gratification serves as an amply\nsufficient sign of ownership and possession to the more modest\nman; another with a more suspicious and ambitious thirst for\npossession, sees the “questionableness,” the mere apparentness of\nsuch ownership, and wishes to have finer tests in order to know\nespecially whether the woman not only gives herself to him, but\nalso gives up for his sake what she has or would like to have—\nonly THEN does he look upon her as “possessed.” A third, however,\nhas not even here got to the limit of his distrust and his desire\nfor possession: he asks himself whether the woman, when she gives\nup everything for him, does not perhaps do so for a phantom of\nhim; he wishes first to be thoroughly, indeed, profoundly well\nknown; in order to be loved at all he ventures to let himself be\nfound out. Only then does he feel the beloved one fully in his\npossession, when she no longer deceives herself about him, when\nshe loves him just as much for the sake of his devilry and\nconcealed insatiability, as for his goodness, patience, and\nspirituality. One man would like to possess a nation, and he\nfinds all the higher arts of Cagliostro and Catalina suitable for\nhis purpose. Another, with a more refined thirst for possession,\nsays to himself: “One may not deceive where one desires to\npossess\"—he is irritated and impatient at the idea that a mask\nof him should rule in the hearts of the people: “I must,\ntherefore, MAKE myself known, and first of all learn to know\nmyself!” Among helpful and charitable people, one almost always\nfinds the awkward craftiness which first gets up suitably him who\nhas to be helped, as though, for instance, he should “merit\"\nhelp, seek just THEIR help, and would show himself deeply\ngrateful, attached, and subservient to them for all help. With\nthese conceits, they take control of the needy as a property,\njust as in general they are charitable and helpful out of a\ndesire for property. One finds them jealous when they are crossed\nor forestalled in their charity. Parents involuntarily make\nsomething like themselves out of their children—they call that\n\"education\"; no mother doubts at the bottom of her heart that the\nchild she has borne is thereby her property, no father hesitates\nabout his right to HIS OWN ideas and notions of worth. Indeed, in\nformer times fathers deemed it right to use their discretion\nconcerning the life or death of the newly born (as among the\nancient Germans). And like the father, so also do the teacher,\nthe class, the priest, and the prince still see in every new\nindividual an unobjectionable opportunity for a new possession.\nThe consequence is . . .",

The Jews—a people “born for slavery,” as Tacitus and the\nwhole ancient world say of them; “the chosen people among the\nnations,” as they themselves say and believe—the Jews performed\nthe miracle of the inversion of valuations, by means of which\nlife on earth obtained a new and dangerous charm for a couple of\nmillenniums. Their prophets fused into one the expressions\n\"rich,” “godless,” “wicked,” “violent,” “sensual,” and for the\nfirst time coined the word “world” as a term of reproach. In this\ninversion of valuations (in which is also included the use of the\nword “poor” as synonymous with “saint” and “friend”) the\nsignificance of the Jewish people is to be found; it is with THEM\nthat the SLAVE-INSURRECTION IN MORALS commences.",
        "196. It is to be INFERRED that there are countless dark bodies\nnear the sun—such as we shall never see. Among ourselves, this\nis an allegory; and the psychologist of morals reads the whole\nstar-writing merely as an allegorical and symbolic language in\nwhich much may be unexpressed.",

The beast of prey and the man of prey (for instance, Caesar\nBorgia) are fundamentally misunderstood, “nature” is\nmisunderstood, so long as one seeks a “morbidness” in the\nconstitution of these healthiest of all tropical monsters and\ngrowths, or even an innate “hell” in them—as almost all\nmoralists have done hitherto. Does it not seem that there is a\nhatred of the virgin forest and of the tropics among moralists?\nAnd that the “tropical man” must be discredited at all costs,\nwhether as disease and deterioration of mankind, or as his own\nhell and self-torture?

        "198. All the systems of morals which address themselves with a\nview to their “happiness,” as it is called—what else are they\nbut suggestions for behaviour adapted to the degree of DANGER\nfrom themselves in which the individuals live; recipes for their\npassions, their good and bad propensities, insofar as such have\nthe Will to Power and would like to play the master; small and\ngreat expediencies and elaborations, permeated with the musty\nodour of old family medicines and old-wife wisdom; all of them\ngrotesque and absurd in their form—because they address\nthemselves to “all,” because they generalize where generalization\nis not authorized; all of them speaking unconditionally, and\ntaking themselves unconditionally; all of them flavoured not\nmerely with one grain of salt, but rather endurable only, and\nsometimes even seductive, when they are over-spiced and begin to\nsmell dangerously, especially of “the other world.” That is all\nof little value when estimated intellectually, and is far from\nbeing “science,” much less “wisdom\"; but, repeated once more, and\nthree times repeated, it is expediency, expediency, expediency,\nmixed with stupidity, stupidity, stupidity—whether it be the\nindifference and statuesque coldness towards the heated folly of\nthe emotions, which the Stoics advised and fostered; or the no-\nmore-laughing and no-more-weeping of Spinoza, the destruction of\nthe emotions by their analysis and vivisection, which he\nrecommended so naively; or the lowering of the emotions to an\ninnocent mean at which they may be satisfied, the Aristotelianism\nof morals; or even morality as the enjoyment of the emotions in a\nvoluntary attenuation and spiritualization by the symbolism of\nart, perhaps as music, or as love of God, and of mankind for\nGod’s sake—for in religion the passions are once more\nenfranchised, provided that . . . ; or, finally, even the complaisant\nand wanton surrender to the emotions, as has been taught by Hafis\nand Goethe, the bold letting-go of the reins, the spiritual and\ncorporeal licentia morum in the exceptional cases of wise old\ncodgers and drunkards, with whom it “no longer has much danger.\"\n—This also for the chapter: “Morals as Timidity.”",
        "199. Inasmuch as in all ages, as long as mankind has existed,\nthere have also been human herds (family alliances, communities,\ntribes, peoples, states, churches), and always a great number who\nobey in proportion to the small number who command—in view,\ntherefore, of the fact that obedience has been most practiced and\nfostered among mankind hitherto, one may reasonably suppose that,\ngenerally speaking, the need thereof is now innate in every one,\nas a kind of FORMAL CONSCIENCE which gives the command “Thou\nshalt unconditionally do something, unconditionally refrain from\nsomething”, in short, “Thou shalt”. This need tries to satisfy\nitself and to fill its form with a content, according to its\nstrength, impatience, and eagerness, it at once seizes as an\nomnivorous appetite with little selection, and accepts whatever\nis shouted into its ear by all sorts of commanders—parents,\nteachers, laws, class prejudices, or public opinion. The\nextraordinary limitation of human development, the hesitation,\nprotractedness, frequent retrogression, and turning thereof, is\nattributable to the fact that the herd-instinct of obedience is\ntransmitted best, and at the cost of the art of command. If one\nimagine this instinct increasing to its greatest extent,\ncommanders and independent individuals will finally be lacking\naltogether, or they will suffer inwardly from a bad conscience,\nand will have to impose a deception on themselves in the first\nplace in order to be able to command just as if they also were\nonly obeying. This condition of things actually exists in Europe\nat present—I call it the moral hypocrisy of the commanding\nclass. They know no other way of protecting themselves from their\nbad conscience than by playing the role of executors of older and\nhigher orders (of predecessors, of the constitution, of justice,\nof the law, or of God himself), or they even justify themselves\nby maxims from the current opinions of the herd, as “first\nservants of their people,” or “instruments of the public weal”.\nOn the other hand, the gregarious European man nowadays assumes\nan air as if he were the only kind of man that is allowable, he\nglorifies his qualities, such as public spirit, kindness,\ndeference, industry, temperance, modesty, indulgence, sympathy,\nby virtue of which he is gentle, endurable, and useful to the\nherd, as the peculiarly human virtues. In cases, however, where\nit is believed that the leader and bell-wether cannot be\ndispensed with, attempt after attempt is made nowadays to replace\ncommanders by the summing together of clever gregarious men all\nrepresentative constitutions, for example, are of this origin. In\nspite of all, what a blessing, what a deliverance from a weight\nbecoming unendurable, is the appearance of an absolute ruler for\nthese gregarious Europeans—of this fact the effect of the\nappearance of Napoleon was the last great proof the history of\nthe influence of Napoleon is almost the history of the higher\nhappiness to which the entire century has attained in its\nworthiest individuals and periods.",
        "200. The man of an age of dissolution which mixes the races with\none another, who has the inheritance of a diversified descent in\nhis body—that is to say, contrary, and often not only contrary,\ninstincts and standards of value, which struggle with one another\nand are seldom at peace—such a man of late culture and broken\nlights, will, on an average, be a weak man. His fundamental\ndesire is that the war which is IN HIM should come to an end;\nhappiness appears to him in the character of a soothing medicine\nand mode of thought (for instance, Epicurean or Christian); it is\nabove all things the happiness of repose, of undisturbedness, of\nrepletion, of final unity—it is the “Sabbath of Sabbaths,” to\nuse the expression of the holy rhetorician, St. Augustine, who\nwas himself such a man.—Should, however, the contrariety and\nconflict in such natures operate as an ADDITIONAL incentive and\nstimulus to life—and if, on the other hand, in addition to their\npowerful and irreconcilable instincts, they have also inherited\nand indoctrinated into them a proper mastery and subtlety for\ncarrying on the conflict with themselves (that is to say, the\nfaculty of self-control and self-deception), there then arise\nthose marvelously incomprehensible and inexplicable beings, those\nenigmatical men, predestined for conquering and circumventing\nothers, the finest examples of which are Alcibiades and Caesar\n(with whom I should like to associate the FIRST of Europeans\naccording to my taste, the Hohenstaufen, Frederick the Second),\nand among artists, perhaps Leonardo da Vinci. They appear\nprecisely in the same periods when that weaker type, with its\nlonging for repose, comes to the front; the two types are\ncomplementary to each other, and spring from the same causes.",
        "201. As long as the utility which determines moral estimates is\nonly gregarious utility, as long as the preservation of the\ncommunity is only kept in view, and the immoral is sought\nprecisely and exclusively in what seems dangerous to the\nmaintenance of the community, there can be no “morality of love\nto one’s neighbour.” Granted even that there is already a little\nconstant exercise of consideration, sympathy, fairness,\ngentleness, and mutual assistance, granted that even in this\ncondition of society all those instincts are already active which\nare latterly distinguished by honourable names as “virtues,” and\neventually almost coincide with the conception “morality”: in\nthat period they do not as yet belong to the domain of moral\nvaluations—they are still ULTRA-MORAL. A sympathetic action, for\ninstance, is neither called good nor bad, moral nor immoral, in\nthe best period of the Romans; and should it be praised, a sort\nof resentful disdain is compatible with this praise, even at the\nbest, directly the sympathetic action is compared with one which\ncontributes to the welfare of the whole, to the RES PUBLICA.\nAfter all, “love to our neighbour” is always a secondary matter,\npartly conventional and arbitrarily manifested in relation to our\nFEAR OF OUR NEIGHBOUR. After the fabric of society seems on the\nwhole established and secured against external dangers, it is\nthis fear of our neighbour which again creates new perspectives\nof moral valuation. Certain strong and dangerous instincts, such\nas the love of enterprise, foolhardiness, revengefulness,\nastuteness, rapacity, and love of power, which up till then had\nnot only to be honoured from the point of view of general\nutility—under other names, of course, than those here given—but\nhad to be fostered and cultivated (because they were perpetually\nrequired in the common danger against the common enemies), are\nnow felt in their dangerousness to be doubly strong—when the\noutlets for them are lacking—and are gradually branded as\nimmoral and given over to calumny. The contrary instincts and\ninclinations now attain to moral honour, the gregarious instinct\ngradually draws its conclusions. How much or how little\ndangerousness to the community or to equality is contained in an\nopinion, a condition, an emotion, a disposition, or an endowment—\nthat is now the moral perspective, here again fear is the mother\nof morals. It is by the loftiest and strongest instincts, when\nthey break out passionately and carry the individual far above\nand beyond the average, and the low level of the gregarious\nconscience, that the self-reliance of the community is destroyed,\nits belief in itself, its backbone, as it were, breaks,\nconsequently these very instincts will be most branded and\ndefamed. The lofty independent spirituality, the will to stand\nalone, and even the cogent reason, are felt to be dangers,\neverything that elevates the individual above the herd, and is a\nsource of fear to the neighbour, is henceforth called EVIL, the\ntolerant, unassuming, self-adapting, self-equalizing disposition,\nthe MEDIOCRITY of desires, attains to moral distinction and\nhonour. Finally, under very peaceful circumstances, there is\nalways less opportunity and necessity for training the feelings\nto severity and rigour, and now every form of severity, even in\njustice, begins to disturb the conscience, a lofty and rigorous\nnobleness and self-responsibility almost offends, and awakens\ndistrust, “the lamb,” and still more “the sheep,” wins respect.\nThere is a point of diseased mellowness and effeminacy in the\nhistory of society, at which society itself takes the part of him\nwho injures it, the part of the CRIMINAL, and does so, in fact,\nseriously and honestly. To punish, appears to it to be somehow\nunfair—it is certain that the idea of “punishment” and “the\nobligation to punish” are then painful and alarming to people.\n\"Is it not sufficient if the criminal be rendered HARMLESS? Why\nshould we still punish? Punishment itself is terrible!\"—with\nthese questions gregarious morality, the morality of fear, draws\nits ultimate conclusion. If one could at all do away with danger,\nthe cause of fear, one would have done away with this morality at\nthe same time, it would no longer be necessary, it WOULD NOT\nCONSIDER ITSELF any longer necessary!—Whoever examines the\nconscience of the present-day European, will always elicit the\nsame imperative from its thousand moral folds and hidden\nrecesses, the imperative of the timidity of the herd “we wish\nthat some time or other there may be NOTHING MORE TO FEAR!” Some\ntime or other—the will and the way THERETO is nowadays called\n\"progress” all over Europe.",
        "202. Let us at once say again what we have already said a hundred\ntimes, for people’s ears nowadays are unwilling to hear such\ntruths—OUR truths. We know well enough how offensive it sounds\nwhen any one plainly, and without metaphor, counts man among the\nanimals, but it will be accounted to us almost a CRIME, that it\nis precisely in respect to men of “modern ideas” that we have\nconstantly applied the terms “herd,” “herd-instincts,” and such\nlike expressions. What avail is it? We cannot do otherwise, for\nit is precisely here that our new insight is. We have found that\nin all the principal moral judgments, Europe has become\nunanimous, including likewise the countries where European\ninfluence prevails in Europe people evidently KNOW what Socrates\nthought he did not know, and what the famous serpent of old once\npromised to teach—they “know” today what is good and evil. It\nmust then sound hard and be distasteful to the ear, when we\nalways insist that that which here thinks it knows, that which\nhere glorifies itself with praise and blame, and calls itself\ngood, is the instinct of the herding human animal, the instinct\nwhich has come and is ever coming more and more to the front, to\npreponderance and supremacy over other instincts, according to\nthe increasing physiological approximation and resemblance of\nwhich it is the symptom. MORALITY IN EUROPE AT PRESENT IS\nHERDING-ANIMAL MORALITY, and therefore, as we understand the\nmatter, only one kind of human morality, beside which, before\nwhich, and after which many other moralities, and above all\nHIGHER moralities, are or should be possible. Against such a\n\"possibility,” against such a “should be,” however, this morality\ndefends itself with all its strength, it says obstinately and\ninexorably “I am morality itself and nothing else is morality!\"\nIndeed, with the help of a religion which has humoured and\nflattered the sublimest desires of the herding-animal, things\nhave reached such a point that we always find a more visible\nexpression of this morality even in political and social\narrangements: the DEMOCRATIC movement is the inheritance of the\nChristian movement. That its TEMPO, however, is much too slow and\nsleepy for the more impatient ones, for those who are sick and\ndistracted by the herding-instinct, is indicated by the\nincreasingly furious howling, and always less disguised teeth-\ngnashing of the anarchist dogs, who are now roving through the\nhighways of European culture. Apparently in opposition to the\npeacefully industrious democrats and Revolution-ideologues, and\nstill more so to the awkward philosophasters and fraternity-\nvisionaries who call themselves Socialists and want a “free\nsociety,” those are really at one with them all in their thorough\nand instinctive hostility to every form of society other than\nthat of the AUTONOMOUS herd (to the extent even of repudiating\nthe notions “master” and “servant\"—ni dieu ni maitre, says a\nsocialist formula); at one in their tenacious opposition to every\nspecial claim, every special right and privilege (this means\nultimately opposition to EVERY right, for when all are equal, no\none needs “rights” any longer); at one in their distrust of\npunitive justice (as though it were a violation of the weak,\nunfair to the NECESSARY consequences of all former society); but\nequally at one in their religion of sympathy, in their compassion\nfor all that feels, lives, and suffers (down to the very animals,\nup even to “God\"—the extravagance of “sympathy for God” belongs\nto a democratic age); altogether at one in the cry and impatience\nof their sympathy, in their deadly hatred of suffering generally,\nin their almost feminine incapacity for witnessing it or ALLOWING\nit; at one in their involuntary beglooming and heart-softening,\nunder the spell of which Europe seems to be threatened with a new\nBuddhism; at one in their belief in the morality of MUTUAL\nsympathy, as though it were morality in itself, the climax, the\nATTAINED climax of mankind, the sole hope of the future, the\nconsolation of the present, the great discharge from all the\nobligations of the past; altogether at one in their belief in the\ncommunity as the DELIVERER, in the herd, and therefore in\n\"themselves.”",
        "203. We, who hold a different belief—we, who regard the\ndemocratic movement, not only as a degenerating form of political\norganization, but as equivalent to a degenerating, a waning type\nof man, as involving his mediocrising and depreciation: where\nhave WE to fix our hopes? In NEW PHILOSOPHERS—there is no other\nalternative: in minds strong and original enough to initiate\nopposite estimates of value, to transvalue and invert “eternal\nvaluations\"; in forerunners, in men of the future, who in the\npresent shall fix the constraints and fasten the knots which will\ncompel millenniums to take NEW paths. To teach man the future of\nhumanity as his WILL, as depending on human will, and to make\npreparation for vast hazardous enterprises and collective\nattempts in rearing and educating, in order thereby to put an end\nto the frightful rule of folly and chance which has hitherto gone\nby the name of “history” (the folly of the “greatest number” is\nonly its last form)—for that purpose a new type of philosopher\nand commander will some time or other be needed, at the very idea\nof which everything that has existed in the way of occult,\nterrible, and benevolent beings might look pale and dwarfed. The\nimage of such leaders hovers before OUR eyes:—is it lawful for\nme to say it aloud, ye free spirits? The conditions which one\nwould partly have to create and partly utilize for their genesis;\nthe presumptive methods and tests by virtue of which a soul\nshould grow up to such an elevation and power as to feel a\nCONSTRAINT to these tasks; a transvaluation of values, under the\nnew pressure and hammer of which a conscience should be steeled\nand a heart transformed into brass, so as to bear the weight of\nsuch responsibility; and on the other hand the necessity for such\nleaders, the dreadful danger that they might be lacking, or\nmiscarry and degenerate:—these are OUR real anxieties and\nglooms, ye know it well, ye free spirits! these are the heavy\ndistant thoughts and storms which sweep across the heaven of OUR\nlife. There are few pains so grievous as to have seen, divined,\nor experienced how an exceptional man has missed his way and\ndeteriorated; but he who has the rare eye for the universal\ndanger of “man” himself DETERIORATING, he who like us has\nrecognized the extraordinary fortuitousness which has hitherto\nplayed its game in respect to the future of mankind—a game in\nwhich neither the hand, nor even a “finger of God” has\nparticipated!—he who divines the fate that is hidden under the\nidiotic unwariness and blind confidence of “modern ideas,” and\nstill more under the whole of Christo-European morality-suffers\nfrom an anguish with which no other is to be compared. He sees at\na glance all that could still BE MADE OUT OF MAN through a\nfavourable accumulation and augmentation of human powers and\narrangements; he knows with all the knowledge of his conviction\nhow unexhausted man still is for the greatest possibilities, and\nhow often in the past the type man has stood in presence of\nmysterious decisions and new paths:—he knows still better from\nhis painfulest recollections on what wretched obstacles promising\ndevelopments of the highest rank have hitherto usually gone to\npieces, broken down, sunk, and become contemptible. The UNIVERSAL\nDEGENERACY OF MANKIND to the level of the “man of the future\"—as\nidealized by the socialistic fools and shallow-pates—this\ndegeneracy and dwarfing of man to an absolutely gregarious animal\n(or as they call it, to a man of “free society”), this\nbrutalizing of man into a pigmy with equal rights and claims, is\nundoubtedly POSSIBLE! He who has thought out this possibility to\nits ultimate conclusion knows ANOTHER loathing unknown to the\nrest of mankind—and perhaps also a new MISSION!",
        "\n204. At the risk that moralizing may also reveal itself here as\nthat which it has always been—namely, resolutely MONTRER SES\nPLAIES, according to Balzac—I would venture to protest against\nan improper and injurious alteration of rank, which quite\nunnoticed, and as if with the best conscience, threatens nowadays\nto establish itself in the relations of science and philosophy. I\nmean to say that one must have the right out of one’s own\nEXPERIENCE—experience, as it seems to me, always implies\nunfortunate experience?—to treat of such an important question\nof rank, so as not to speak of colour like the blind, or AGAINST\nscience like women and artists (\"Ah! this dreadful science!” sigh\ntheir instinct and their shame, “it always FINDS THINGS OUT!”).\nThe declaration of independence of the scientific man, his\nemancipation from philosophy, is one of the subtler after-effects\nof democratic organization and disorganization: the self-\nglorification and self-conceitedness of the learned man is now\neverywhere in full bloom, and in its best springtime—which does\nnot mean to imply that in this case self-praise smells sweet.\nHere also the instinct of the populace cries, “Freedom from all\nmasters!” and after science has, with the happiest results,\nresisted theology, whose “hand-maid” it had been too long, it now\nproposes in its wantonness and indiscretion to lay down laws for\nphilosophy, and in its turn to play the “master\"—what am I\nsaying! to play the PHILOSOPHER on its own account. My memory—\nthe memory of a scientific man, if you please!—teems with the\nnaivetes of insolence which I have heard about philosophy and\nphilosophers from young naturalists and old physicians (not to\nmention the most cultured and most conceited of all learned men,\nthe philologists and schoolmasters, who are both the one and the\nother by profession). On one occasion it was the specialist and\nthe Jack Horner who instinctively stood on the defensive against\nall synthetic tasks and capabilities; at another time it was the\nindustrious worker who had got a scent of OTIUM and refined\nluxuriousness in the internal economy of the philosopher, and\nfelt himself aggrieved and belittled thereby. On another occasion\nit was the colour-blindness of the utilitarian, who sees nothing\nin philosophy but a series of REFUTED systems, and an extravagant\nexpenditure which “does nobody any good”. At another time the\nfear of disguised mysticism and of the boundary-adjustment of\nknowledge became conspicuous, at another time the disregard of\nindividual philosophers, which had involuntarily extended to\ndisregard of philosophy generally. In fine, I found most\nfrequently, behind the proud disdain of philosophy in young\nscholars, the evil after-effect of some particular philosopher,\nto whom on the whole obedience had been foresworn, without,\nhowever, the spell of his scornful estimates of other\nphilosophers having been got rid of—the result being a general\nill-will to all philosophy. (Such seems to me, for instance, the\nafter-effect of Schopenhauer on the most modern Germany: by his\nunintelligent rage against Hegel, he has succeeded in severing\nthe whole of the last generation of Germans from its connection\nwith German culture, which culture, all things considered, has\nbeen an elevation and a divining refinement of the HISTORICAL\nSENSE, but precisely at this point Schopenhauer himself was poor,\nirreceptive, and un-German to the extent of ingeniousness.) On\nthe whole, speaking generally, it may just have been the\nhumanness, all-too-humanness of the modern philosophers\nthemselves, in short, their contemptibleness, which has injured\nmost radically the reverence for philosophy and opened the doors\nto the instinct of the populace. Let it but be acknowledged to\nwhat an extent our modern world diverges from the whole style of\nthe world of Heraclitus, Plato, Empedocles, and whatever else all\nthe royal and magnificent anchorites of the spirit were called,\nand with what justice an honest man of science MAY feel himself\nof a better family and origin, in view of such representatives of\nphilosophy, who, owing to the fashion of the present day, are\njust as much aloft as they are down below—in Germany, for\ninstance, the two lions of Berlin, the anarchist Eugen Duhring\nand the amalgamist Eduard von Hartmann. It is especially the\nsight of those hotch-potch philosophers, who call themselves\n\"realists,” or “positivists,” which is calculated to implant a\ndangerous distrust in the soul of a young and ambitious scholar\nthose philosophers, at the best, are themselves but scholars and\nspecialists, that is very evident! All of them are persons who\nhave been vanquished and BROUGHT BACK AGAIN under the dominion of\nscience, who at one time or another claimed more from themselves,\nwithout having a right to the “more” and its responsibility—and\nwho now, creditably, rancorously, and vindictively, represent in\nword and deed, DISBELIEF in the master-task and supremacy of\nphilosophy After all, how could it be otherwise? Science\nflourishes nowadays and has the good conscience clearly visible\non its countenance, while that to which the entire modern\nphilosophy has gradually sunk, the remnant of philosophy of the\npresent day, excites distrust and displeasure, if not scorn and\npity Philosophy reduced to a “theory of knowledge,” no more in\nfact than a diffident science of epochs and doctrine of\nforbearance a philosophy that never even gets beyond the\nthreshold, and rigorously DENIES itself the right to enter—that\nis philosophy in its last throes, an end, an agony, something\nthat awakens pity. How could such a philosophy—RULE!",
        "205. The dangers that beset the evolution of the philosopher are,\nin fact, so manifold nowadays, that one might doubt whether this\nfruit could still come to maturity. The extent and towering\nstructure of the sciences have increased enormously, and\ntherewith also the probability that the philosopher will grow\ntired even as a learner, or will attach himself somewhere and\n\"specialize” so that he will no longer attain to his elevation,\nthat is to say, to his superspection, his circumspection, and his\nDESPECTION. Or he gets aloft too late, when the best of his\nmaturity and strength is past, or when he is impaired, coarsened,\nand deteriorated, so that his view, his general estimate of\nthings, is no longer of much importance. It is perhaps just the\nrefinement of his intellectual conscience that makes him hesitate\nand linger on the way, he dreads the temptation to become a\ndilettante, a millepede, a milleantenna, he knows too well that\nas a discerner, one who has lost his self-respect no longer\ncommands, no longer LEADS, unless he should aspire to become a\ngreat play-actor, a philosophical Cagliostro and spiritual rat-\ncatcher—in short, a misleader. This is in the last instance a\nquestion of taste, if it has not really been a question of\nconscience. To double once more the philosopher’s difficulties,\nthere is also the fact that he demands from himself a verdict, a\nYea or Nay, not concerning science, but concerning life and the\nworth of life—he learns unwillingly to believe that it is his\nright and even his duty to obtain this verdict, and he has to\nseek his way to the right and the belief only through the most\nextensive (perhaps disturbing and destroying) experiences, often\nhesitating, doubting, and dumbfounded. In fact, the philosopher\nhas long been mistaken and confused by the multitude, either with\nthe scientific man and ideal scholar, or with the religiously\nelevated, desensualized, desecularized visionary and God-\nintoxicated man; and even yet when one hears anybody praised,\nbecause he lives “wisely,” or “as a philosopher,” it hardly means\nanything more than “prudently and apart.” Wisdom: that seems to\nthe populace to be a kind of flight, a means and artifice for\nwithdrawing successfully from a bad game; but the GENUINE\nphilosopher—does it not seem so to US, my friends?—lives\n\"unphilosophically” and “unwisely,” above all, IMPRUDENTLY, and\nfeels the obligation and burden of a hundred attempts and\ntemptations of life—he risks HIMSELF constantly, he plays THIS\nbad game.",
        "206. In relation to the genius, that is to say, a being who\neither ENGENDERS or PRODUCES—both words understood in their\nfullest sense—the man of learning, the scientific average man,\nhas always something of the old maid about him; for, like her, he\nis not conversant with the two principal functions of man. To\nboth, of course, to the scholar and to the old maid, one concedes\nrespectability, as if by way of indemnification—in these cases\none emphasizes the respectability—and yet, in the compulsion of\nthis concession, one has the same admixture of vexation. Let us\nexamine more closely: what is the scientific man? Firstly, a\ncommonplace type of man, with commonplace virtues: that is to\nsay, a non-ruling, non-authoritative, and non-self-sufficient\ntype of man; he possesses industry, patient adaptableness to rank\nand file, equability and moderation in capacity and requirement;\nhe has the instinct for people like himself, and for that which\nthey require—for instance: the portion of independence and green\nmeadow without which there is no rest from labour, the claim to\nhonour and consideration (which first and foremost presupposes\nrecognition and recognisability), the sunshine of a good name,\nthe perpetual ratification of his value and usefulness, with\nwhich the inward DISTRUST which lies at the bottom of the heart\nof all dependent men and gregarious animals, has again and again\nto be overcome. The learned man, as is appropriate, has also\nmaladies and faults of an ignoble kind: he is full of petty envy,\nand has a lynx-eye for the weak points in those natures to whose\nelevations he cannot attain. He is confiding, yet only as one who\nlets himself go, but does not FLOW; and precisely before the man\nof the great current he stands all the colder and more reserved—\nhis eye is then like a smooth and irresponsive lake, which is no\nlonger moved by rapture or sympathy. The worst and most dangerous\nthing of which a scholar is capable results from the instinct of\nmediocrity of his type, from the Jesuitism of mediocrity, which\nlabours instinctively for the destruction of the exceptional man,\nand endeavours to break—or still better, to relax—every bent\nbow To relax, of course, with consideration, and naturally with\nan indulgent hand—to RELAX with confiding sympathy that is the\nreal art of Jesuitism, which has always understood how to\nintroduce itself as the religion of sympathy.",
        "207. However gratefully one may welcome the OBJECTIVE spirit—and\nwho has not been sick to death of all subjectivity and its\nconfounded IPSISIMOSITY!—in the end, however, one must learn\ncaution even with regard to one’s gratitude, and put a stop to\nthe exaggeration with which the unselfing and depersonalizing of\nthe spirit has recently been celebrated, as if it were the goal\nin itself, as if it were salvation and glorification—as is\nespecially accustomed to happen in the pessimist school, which\nhas also in its turn good reasons for paying the highest honours\nto “disinterested knowledge” The objective man, who no longer\ncurses and scolds like the pessimist, the IDEAL man of learning\nin whom the scientific instinct blossoms forth fully after a\nthousand complete and partial failures, is assuredly one of the\nmost costly instruments that exist, but his place is in the hand\nof one who is more powerful He is only an instrument, we may say,\nhe is a MIRROR—he is no “purpose in himself” The objective man\nis in truth a mirror accustomed to prostration before everything\nthat wants to be known, with such desires only as knowing or\n\"reflecting” implies—he waits until something comes, and then\nexpands himself sensitively, so that even the light footsteps and\ngliding-past of spiritual beings may not be lost on his surface\nand film Whatever “personality” he still possesses seems to him\naccidental, arbitrary, or still oftener, disturbing, so much has\nhe come to regard himself as the passage and reflection of\noutside forms and events He calls up the recollection of\n\"himself” with an effort, and not infrequently wrongly, he\nreadily confounds himself with other persons, he makes mistakes\nwith regard to his own needs, and here only is he unrefined and\nnegligent Perhaps he is troubled about the health, or the\npettiness and confined atmosphere of wife and friend, or the lack\nof companions and society—indeed, he sets himself to reflect on\nhis suffering, but in vain! His thoughts already rove away to the\nMORE GENERAL case, and tomorrow he knows as little as he knew\nyesterday how to help himself He does not now take himself\nseriously and devote time to himself he is serene, NOT from lack\nof trouble, but from lack of capacity for grasping and dealing\nwith HIS trouble The habitual complaisance with respect to all\nobjects and experiences, the radiant and impartial hospitality\nwith which he receives everything that comes his way, his habit\nof inconsiderate good-nature, of dangerous indifference as to Yea\nand Nay: alas! there are enough of cases in which he has to atone\nfor these virtues of his!—and as man generally, he becomes far\ntoo easily the CAPUT MORTUUM of such virtues. Should one wish\nlove or hatred from him—I mean love and hatred as God, woman,\nand animal understand them—he will do what he can, and furnish\nwhat he can. But one must not be surprised if it should not be\nmuch—if he should show himself just at this point to be false,\nfragile, questionable, and deteriorated. His love is constrained,\nhis hatred is artificial, and rather UNN TOUR DE FORCE, a slight\nostentation and exaggeration. He is only genuine so far as he can\nbe objective; only in his serene totality is he still “nature\"\nand “natural.” His mirroring and eternally self-polishing soul no\nlonger knows how to affirm, no longer how to deny; he does not\ncommand; neither does he destroy. “JE NE MEPRISE PRESQUE RIEN\"—\nhe says, with Leibniz: let us not overlook nor undervalue the\nPRESQUE! Neither is he a model man; he does not go in advance of\nany one, nor after, either; he places himself generally too far\noff to have any reason for espousing the cause of either good or\nevil. If he has been so long confounded with the PHILOSOPHER,\nwith the Caesarian trainer and dictator of civilization, he has\nhad far too much honour, and what is more essential in him has\nbeen overlooked—he is an instrument, something of a slave,\nthough certainly the sublimest sort of slave, but nothing in\nhimself—PRESQUE RIEN! The objective man is an instrument, a\ncostly, easily injured, easily tarnished measuring instrument and\nmirroring apparatus, which is to be taken care of and respected;\nbut he is no goal, not outgoing nor upgoing, no complementary man\nin whom the REST of existence justifies itself, no termination—\nand still less a commencement, an engendering, or primary cause,\nnothing hardy, powerful, self-centred, that wants to be master;\nbut rather only a soft, inflated, delicate, movable potter’s-\nform, that must wait for some kind of content and frame to\n\"shape” itself thereto—for the most part a man without frame and\ncontent, a “selfless” man. Consequently, also, nothing for women,\nIN PARENTHESI.",
        "208. When a philosopher nowadays makes known that he is not a\nskeptic—I hope that has been gathered from the foregoing\ndescription of the objective spirit?—people all hear it\nimpatiently; they regard him on that account with some\napprehension, they would like to ask so many, many questions . . .\nindeed among timid hearers, of whom there are now so many, he is\nhenceforth said to be dangerous. With his repudiation of\nskepticism, it seems to them as if they heard some evil-\nthreatening sound in the distance, as if a new kind of explosive\nwere being tried somewhere, a dynamite of the spirit, perhaps a\nnewly discovered Russian NIHILINE, a pessimism BONAE VOLUNTATIS,\nthat not only denies, means denial, but-dreadful thought!\nPRACTISES denial. Against this kind of “good-will\"—a will to the\nveritable, actual negation of life—there is, as is generally\nacknowledged nowadays, no better soporific and sedative than\nskepticism, the mild, pleasing, lulling poppy of skepticism; and\nHamlet himself is now prescribed by the doctors of the day as an\nantidote to the “spirit,” and its underground noises. “Are not\nour ears already full of bad sounds?” say the skeptics, as lovers\nof repose, and almost as a kind of safety police; “this\nsubterranean Nay is terrible! Be still, ye pessimistic moles!\"\nThe skeptic, in effect, that delicate creature, is far too easily\nfrightened; his conscience is schooled so as to start at every\nNay, and even at that sharp, decided Yea, and feels something\nlike a bite thereby. Yea! and Nay!—they seem to him opposed to\nmorality; he loves, on the contrary, to make a festival to his\nvirtue by a noble aloofness, while perhaps he says with\nMontaigne: “What do I know?” Or with Socrates: “I know that I\nknow nothing.” Or: “Here I do not trust myself, no door is open\nto me.” Or: “Even if the door were open, why should I enter\nimmediately?” Or: “What is the use of any hasty hypotheses? It\nmight quite well be in good taste to make no hypotheses at all.\nAre you absolutely obliged to straighten at once what is crooked?\nto stuff every hole with some kind of oakum? Is there not time\nenough for that? Has not the time leisure? Oh, ye demons, can ye\nnot at all WAIT? The uncertain also has its charms, the Sphinx,\ntoo, is a Circe, and Circe, too, was a philosopher.\"—Thus does a\nskeptic console himself; and in truth he needs some consolation.\nFor skepticism is the most spiritual expression of a certain\nmany-sided physiological temperament, which in ordinary language\nis called nervous debility and sickliness; it arises whenever\nraces or classes which have been long separated, decisively and\nsuddenly blend with one another. In the new generation, which has\ninherited as it were different standards and valuations in its\nblood, everything is disquiet, derangement, doubt, and\ntentativeness; the best powers operate restrictively, the very\nvirtues prevent each other growing and becoming strong,\nequilibrium, ballast, and perpendicular stability are lacking in\nbody and soul. That, however, which is most diseased and\ndegenerated in such nondescripts is the WILL; they are no longer\nfamiliar with independence of decision, or the courageous feeling\nof pleasure in willing—they are doubtful of the “freedom of the\nwill” even in their dreams Our present-day Europe, the scene of a\nsenseless, precipitate attempt at a radical blending of classes,\nand CONSEQUENTLY of races, is therefore skeptical in all its\nheights and depths, sometimes exhibiting the mobile skepticism\nwhich springs impatiently and wantonly from branch to branch,\nsometimes with gloomy aspect, like a cloud over-charged with\ninterrogative signs—and often sick unto death of its will!\nParalysis of will, where do we not find this cripple sitting\nnowadays! And yet how bedecked oftentimes’ How seductively\nornamented! There are the finest gala dresses and disguises for\nthis disease, and that, for instance, most of what places itself\nnowadays in the show-cases as “objectiveness,” “the scientific\nspirit,” “L’ART POUR L’ART,” and “pure voluntary knowledge,” is\nonly decked-out skepticism and paralysis of will—I am ready to\nanswer for this diagnosis of the European disease—The disease of\nthe will is diffused unequally over Europe, it is worst and most\nvaried where civilization has longest prevailed, it decreases\naccording as “the barbarian” still—or again—asserts his claims\nunder the loose drapery of Western culture It is therefore in the\nFrance of today, as can be readily disclosed and comprehended,\nthat the will is most infirm, and France, which has always had a\nmasterly aptitude for converting even the portentous crises of\nits spirit into something charming and seductive, now manifests\nemphatically its intellectual ascendancy over Europe, by being\nthe school and exhibition of all the charms of skepticism The\npower to will and to persist, moreover, in a resolution, is\nalready somewhat stronger in Germany, and again in the North of\nGermany it is stronger than in Central Germany, it is\nconsiderably stronger in England, Spain, and Corsica, associated\nwith phlegm in the former and with hard skulls in the latter—not\nto mention Italy, which is too young yet to know what it wants,\nand must first show whether it can exercise will, but it is\nstrongest and most surprising of all in that immense middle\nempire where Europe as it were flows back to Asia—namely, in\nRussia There the power to will has been long stored up and\naccumulated, there the will—uncertain whether to be negative or\naffirmative—waits threateningly to be discharged (to borrow\ntheir pet phrase from our physicists) Perhaps not only Indian\nwars and complications in Asia would be necessary to free Europe\nfrom its greatest danger, but also internal subversion, the\nshattering of the empire into small states, and above all the\nintroduction of parliamentary imbecility, together with the\nobligation of every one to read his newspaper at breakfast I do\nnot say this as one who desires it, in my heart I should rather\nprefer the contrary—I mean such an increase in the threatening\nattitude of Russia, that Europe would have to make up its mind to\nbecome equally threatening—namely, TO ACQUIRE ONE WILL, by means\nof a new caste to rule over the Continent, a persistent, dreadful\nwill of its own, that can set its aims thousands of years ahead;\nso that the long spun-out comedy of its petty-statism, and its\ndynastic as well as its democratic many-willed-ness, might\nfinally be brought to a close. The time for petty politics is\npast; the next century will bring the struggle for the dominion\nof the world—the COMPULSION to great politics.",
        "209. As to how far the new warlike age on which we Europeans have\nevidently entered may perhaps favour the growth of another and\nstronger kind of skepticism, I should like to express myself\npreliminarily merely by a parable, which the lovers of German\nhistory will already understand. That unscrupulous enthusiast for\nbig, handsome grenadiers (who, as King of Prussia, brought into\nbeing a military and skeptical genius—and therewith, in reality,\nthe new and now triumphantly emerged type of German), the\nproblematic, crazy father of Frederick the Great, had on one\npoint the very knack and lucky grasp of the genius: he knew what\nwas then lacking in Germany, the want of which was a hundred\ntimes more alarming and serious than any lack of culture and\nsocial form—his ill-will to the young Frederick resulted from\nthe anxiety of a profound instinct. MEN WERE LACKING; and he\nsuspected, to his bitterest regret, that his own son was not man\nenough. There, however, he deceived himself; but who would not\nhave deceived himself in his place? He saw his son lapsed to\natheism, to the ESPRIT, to the pleasant frivolity of clever\nFrenchmen—he saw in the background the great bloodsucker, the\nspider skepticism; he suspected the incurable wretchedness of a\nheart no longer hard enough either for evil or good, and of a\nbroken will that no longer commands, is no longer ABLE to\ncommand. Meanwhile, however, there grew up in his son that new\nkind of harder and more dangerous skepticism—who knows TO WHAT\nEXTENT it was encouraged just by his father’s hatred and the icy\nmelancholy of a will condemned to solitude?—the skepticism of\ndaring manliness, which is closely related to the genius for war\nand conquest, and made its first entrance into Germany in the\nperson of the great Frederick. This skepticism despises and\nnevertheless grasps; it undermines and takes possession; it does\nnot believe, but it does not thereby lose itself; it gives the\nspirit a dangerous liberty, but it keeps strict guard over the\nheart. It is the GERMAN form of skepticism, which, as a continued\nFredericianism, risen to the highest spirituality, has kept\nEurope for a considerable time under the dominion of the German\nspirit and its critical and historical distrust Owing to the\ninsuperably strong and tough masculine character of the great\nGerman philologists and historical critics (who, rightly\nestimated, were also all of them artists of destruction and\ndissolution), a NEW conception of the German spirit gradually\nestablished itself—in spite of all Romanticism in music and\nphilosophy—in which the leaning towards masculine skepticism was\ndecidedly prominent whether, for instance, as fearlessness of\ngaze, as courage and sternness of the dissecting hand, or as\nresolute will to dangerous voyages of discovery, to spiritualized\nNorth Pole expeditions under barren and dangerous skies. There\nmay be good grounds for it when warm-blooded and superficial\nhumanitarians cross themselves before this spirit, CET ESPRIT\nFATALISTE, IRONIQUE, MEPHISTOPHELIQUE, as Michelet calls it, not\nwithout a shudder. But if one would realize how characteristic is\nthis fear of the “man” in the German spirit which awakened Europe\nout of its “dogmatic slumber,” let us call to mind the former\nconception which had to be overcome by this new one—and that it\nis not so very long ago that a masculinized woman could dare,\nwith unbridled presumption, to recommend the Germans to the\ninterest of Europe as gentle, goodhearted, weak-willed, and\npoetical fools. Finally, let us only understand profoundly enough\nNapoleon’s astonishment when he saw Goethe it reveals what had\nbeen regarded for centuries as the “German spirit” “VOILA UN\nHOMME!\"—that was as much as to say “But this is a MAN! And I\nonly expected to see a German!”",
        "Supposing, then, that in the picture of the philosophers of the\nfuture, some trait suggests the question whether they must not\nperhaps be skeptics in the last-mentioned sense, something in\nthem would only be designated thereby—and not they themselves.\nWith equal right they might call themselves critics, and\nassuredly they will be men of experiments. By the name with which\nI ventured to baptize them, I have already expressly emphasized\ntheir attempting and their love of attempting is this because, as\ncritics in body and soul, they will love to make use of\nexperiments in a new, and perhaps wider and more dangerous sense?\nIn their passion for knowledge, will they have to go further in\ndaring and painful attempts than the sensitive and pampered taste\nof a democratic century can approve of?—There is no doubt these\ncoming ones will be least able to dispense with the serious and\nnot unscrupulous qualities which distinguish the critic from the\nskeptic I mean the certainty as to standards of worth, the\nconscious employment of a unity of method, the wary courage, the\nstanding-alone, and the capacity for self-responsibility, indeed,\nthey will avow among themselves a DELIGHT in denial and\ndissection, and a certain considerate cruelty, which knows how to\nhandle the knife surely and deftly, even when the heart bleeds\nThey will be STERNER (and perhaps not always towards themselves\nonly) than humane people may desire, they will not deal with the\n\"truth” in order that it may “please” them, or “elevate” and\n\"inspire” them—they will rather have little faith in “TRUTH\"\nbringing with it such revels for the feelings. They will smile,\nthose rigourous spirits, when any one says in their presence\n\"That thought elevates me, why should it not be true?” or “That\nwork enchants me, why should it not be beautiful?” or “That\nartist enlarges me, why should he not be great?” Perhaps they\nwill not only have a smile, but a genuine disgust for all that is\nthus rapturous, idealistic, feminine, and hermaphroditic, and if\nany one could look into their inmost hearts, he would not easily\nfind therein the intention to reconcile “Christian sentiments\"\nwith “antique taste,” or even with “modern parliamentarism” (the\nkind of reconciliation necessarily found even among philosophers\nin our very uncertain and consequently very conciliatory\ncentury). Critical discipline, and every habit that conduces to\npurity and rigour in intellectual matters, will not only be\ndemanded from themselves by these philosophers of the future,\nthey may even make a display thereof as their special adornment—\nnevertheless they will not want to be called critics on that\naccount. It will seem to them no small indignity to philosophy to\nhave it decreed, as is so welcome nowadays, that “philosophy\nitself is criticism and critical science—and nothing else\nwhatever!” Though this estimate of philosophy may enjoy the\napproval of all the Positivists of France and Germany (and\npossibly it even flattered the heart and taste of KANT: let us\ncall to mind the titles of his principal works), our new\nphilosophers will say, notwithstanding, that critics are\ninstruments of the philosopher, and just on that account, as\ninstruments, they are far from being philosophers themselves!\nEven the great Chinaman of Konigsberg was only a great critic.",
        "211. I insist upon it that people finally cease confounding\nphilosophical workers, and in general scientific men, with\nphilosophers—that precisely here one should strictly give “each\nhis own,” and not give those far too much, these far too little.\nIt may be necessary for the education of the real philosopher\nthat he himself should have once stood upon all those steps upon\nwhich his servants, the scientific workers of philosophy, remain\nstanding, and MUST remain standing he himself must perhaps have\nbeen critic, and dogmatist, and historian, and besides, poet, and\ncollector, and traveler, and riddle-reader, and moralist, and\nseer, and “free spirit,” and almost everything, in order to\ntraverse the whole range of human values and estimations, and\nthat he may BE ABLE with a variety of eyes and consciences to\nlook from a height to any distance, from a depth up to any\nheight, from a nook into any expanse. But all these are only\npreliminary conditions for his task; this task itself demands\nsomething else—it requires him TO CREATE VALUES. The\nphilosophical workers, after the excellent pattern of Kant and\nHegel, have to fix and formalize some great existing body of\nvaluations—that is to say, former DETERMINATIONS OF VALUE,\ncreations of value, which have become prevalent, and are for a\ntime called “truths\"—whether in the domain of the LOGICAL, the\nPOLITICAL (moral), or the ARTISTIC. It is for these investigators\nto make whatever has happened and been esteemed hitherto,\nconspicuous, conceivable, intelligible, and manageable, to\nshorten everything long, even “time” itself, and to SUBJUGATE the\nentire past: an immense and wonderful task, in the carrying out\nof which all refined pride, all tenacious will, can surely find\nsatisfaction. THE REAL PHILOSOPHERS, HOWEVER, ARE COMMANDERS AND\nLAW-GIVERS; they say: “Thus SHALL it be!” They determine first\nthe Whither and the Why of mankind, and thereby set aside the\nprevious labour of all philosophical workers, and all subjugators\nof the past—they grasp at the future with a creative hand, and\nwhatever is and was, becomes for them thereby a means, an\ninstrument, and a hammer. Their “knowing” is CREATING, their\ncreating is a law-giving, their will to truth is—WILL TO POWER.\n—Are there at present such philosophers? Have there ever been\nsuch philosophers? MUST there not be such philosophers some day?\n. . .",
        "212. It is always more obvious to me that the philosopher, as a\nman INDISPENSABLE for the morrow and the day after the morrow,\nhas ever found himself, and HAS BEEN OBLIGED to find himself, in\ncontradiction to the day in which he lives; his enemy has always\nbeen the ideal of his day. Hitherto all those extraordinary\nfurtherers of humanity whom one calls philosophers—who rarely\nregarded themselves as lovers of wisdom, but rather as\ndisagreeable fools and dangerous interrogators—have found their\nmission, their hard, involuntary, imperative mission (in the end,\nhowever, the greatness of their mission), in being the bad\nconscience of their age. In putting the vivisector’s knife to the\nbreast of the very VIRTUES OF THEIR AGE, they have betrayed their\nown secret; it has been for the sake of a NEW greatness of man, a\nnew untrodden path to his aggrandizement. They have always\ndisclosed how much hypocrisy, indolence, self-indulgence, and\nself-neglect, how much falsehood was concealed under the most\nvenerated types of contemporary morality, how much virtue was\nOUTLIVED, they have always said “We must remove hence to where\nYOU are least at home” In the face of a world of “modern ideas,\"\nwhich would like to confine every one in a corner, in a\n\"specialty,” a philosopher, if there could be philosophers\nnowadays, would be compelled to place the greatness of man, the\nconception of “greatness,” precisely in his comprehensiveness and\nmultifariousness, in his all-roundness, he would even determine\nworth and rank according to the amount and variety of that which\na man could bear and take upon himself, according to the EXTENT\nto which a man could stretch his responsibility Nowadays the\ntaste and virtue of the age weaken and attenuate the will,\nnothing is so adapted to the spirit of the age as weakness of\nwill consequently, in the ideal of the philosopher, strength of\nwill, sternness, and capacity for prolonged resolution, must\nspecially be included in the conception of “greatness”, with as\ngood a right as the opposite doctrine, with its ideal of a silly,\nrenouncing, humble, selfless humanity, was suited to an opposite\nage—such as the sixteenth century, which suffered from its\naccumulated energy of will, and from the wildest torrents and\nfloods of selfishness In the time of Socrates, among men only of\nworn-out instincts, old conservative Athenians who let themselves\ngo—\"for the sake of happiness,” as they said, for the sake of\npleasure, as their conduct indicated—and who had continually on\ntheir lips the old pompous words to which they had long forfeited\nthe right by the life they led, IRONY was perhaps necessary for\ngreatness of soul, the wicked Socratic assurance of the old\nphysician and plebeian, who cut ruthlessly into his own flesh, as\ninto the flesh and heart of the “noble,” with a look that said\nplainly enough “Do not dissemble before me! here—we are equal!\"\nAt present, on the contrary, when throughout Europe the herding-\nanimal alone attains to honours, and dispenses honours, when\n\"equality of right” can too readily be transformed into equality\nin wrong—I mean to say into general war against everything rare,\nstrange, and privileged, against the higher man, the higher soul,\nthe higher duty, the higher responsibility, the creative\nplenipotence and lordliness—at present it belongs to the\nconception of “greatness” to be noble, to wish to be apart, to be\ncapable of being different, to stand alone, to have to live by\npersonal initiative, and the philosopher will betray something of\nhis own ideal when he asserts “He shall be the greatest who can\nbe the most solitary, the most concealed, the most divergent, the\nman beyond good and evil, the master of his virtues, and of\nsuper-abundance of will; precisely this shall be called\nGREATNESS: as diversified as can be entire, as ample as can be\nfull.” And to ask once more the question: Is greatness POSSIBLE—\nnowadays?",
        "213. It is difficult to learn what a philosopher is, because it\ncannot be taught: one must “know” it by experience—or one should\nhave the pride NOT to know it. The fact that at present people\nall talk of things of which they CANNOT have any experience, is\ntrue more especially and unfortunately as concerns the\nphilosopher and philosophical matters:—the very few know them,\nare permitted to know them, and all popular ideas about them are\nfalse. Thus, for instance, the truly philosophical combination of\na bold, exuberant spirituality which runs at presto pace, and a\ndialectic rigour and necessity which makes no false step, is\nunknown to most thinkers and scholars from their own experience,\nand therefore, should any one speak of it in their presence, it\nis incredible to them. They conceive of every necessity as\ntroublesome, as a painful compulsory obedience and state of\nconstraint; thinking itself is regarded by them as something slow\nand hesitating, almost as a trouble, and often enough as “worthy\nof the SWEAT of the noble\"—but not at all as something easy and\ndivine, closely related to dancing and exuberance! “To think” and\nto take a matter “seriously,” “arduously\"—that is one and the\nsame thing to them; such only has been their “experience.\"—\nArtists have here perhaps a finer intuition; they who know only\ntoo well that precisely when they no longer do anything\n\"arbitrarily,” and everything of necessity, their feeling of\nfreedom, of subtlety, of power, of creatively fixing, disposing,\nand shaping, reaches its climax—in short, that necessity and\n\"freedom of will” are then the same thing with them. There is, in\nfine, a gradation of rank in psychical states, to which the\ngradation of rank in the problems corresponds; and the highest\nproblems repel ruthlessly every one who ventures too near them,\nwithout being predestined for their solution by the loftiness and\npower of his spirituality. Of what use is it for nimble, everyday\nintellects, or clumsy, honest mechanics and empiricists to press,\nin their plebeian ambition, close to such problems, and as it\nwere into this “holy of holies\"—as so often happens nowadays!\nBut coarse feet must never tread upon such carpets: this is\nprovided for in the primary law of things; the doors remain\nclosed to those intruders, though they may dash and break their\nheads thereon. People have always to be born to a high station,\nor, more definitely, they have to be BRED for it: a person has\nonly a right to philosophy—taking the word in its higher\nsignificance—in virtue of his descent; the ancestors, the\n\"blood,” decide here also. Many generations must have prepared\nthe way for the coming of the philosopher; each of his virtues\nmust have been separately acquired, nurtured, transmitted, and\nembodied; not only the bold, easy, delicate course and current of\nhis thoughts, but above all the readiness for great\nresponsibilities, the majesty of ruling glance and contemning\nlook, the feeling of separation from the multitude with their\nduties and virtues, the kindly patronage and defense of whatever\nis misunderstood and calumniated, be it God or devil, the delight\nand practice of supreme justice, the art of commanding, the\namplitude of will, the lingering eye which rarely admires, rarely\nlooks up, rarely loves. . . .",

OUR Virtues?—It is probable that we, too, have still our\nvirtues, althoughnaturally they are not those sincere and massive\nvirtues on account of which we hold our grandfathers in esteem\nand also at a little distance from us. We Europeans of the day\nafter tomorrow, we firstlings of the twentieth century—with all\nour dangerous curiosity, our multifariousness and art of\ndisguising, our mellow and seemingly sweetened cruelty in sense\nand spirit—we shall presumably, IF we must have virtues, have\nthose only which have come to agreement with our most secret and\nheartfelt inclinations, with our most ardent requirements: well,\nthen, let us look for them in our labyrinths!—where, as we know,\nso many things lose themselves, so many things get quite lost!\nAnd is there anything finer than to SEARCH for one’s own virtues?\nIs it not almost to BELIEVE in one’s own virtues? But this\n\"believing in one’s own virtues\"—is it not practically the same\nas what was formerly called one’s “good conscience,” that long,\nrespectable pigtail of an idea, which our grandfathers used to\nhang behind their heads, and often enough also behind their\nunderstandings? It seems, therefore, that however little we may\nimagine ourselves to be old-fashioned and grandfatherly\nrespectable in other respects, in one thing we are nevertheless\nthe worthy grandchildren of our grandfathers, we last Europeans\nwith good consciences: we also still wear their pigtail.—Ah! if\nyou only knew how soon, so very soon—it will be different!",

As in the stellar firmament there are sometimes two suns\nwhich determine the path of one planet, and in certain cases suns\nof different colours shine around a single planet, now with red\nlight, now with green, and then simultaneously illumine and flood\nit with motley colours: so we modern men, owing to the\ncomplicated mechanism of our “firmament,” are determined by\nDIFFERENT moralities; our actions shine alternately in different\ncolours, and are seldom unequivocal—and there are often cases,\nalso, in which our actions are MOTLEY-COLOURED.",

I think that has been well learnt: it\ntakes place thousands of times at present on a large and small\nscale; indeed, at times the higher and sublimer thing takes\nplace:—we learn to DESPISE when we love, and precisely when we\nlove best; all of it, however, unconsciously, without noise,\nwithout ostentation, with the shame and secrecy of goodness,\nwhich forbids the utterance of the pompous word and the formula\nof virtue. Morality as attitude—is opposed to our taste\nnowadays. This is ALSO an advance, as it was an advance in our\nfathers that religion as an attitude finally became opposed to\ntheir taste, including the enmity and Voltairean bitterness\nagainst religion (and all that formerly belonged to freethinker-\npantomime). It is the music in our conscience, the dance in our\nspirit, to which Puritan litanies, moral sermons, and goody-\ngoodness won’t chime.",

        "218. The psychologists of France—and where else are there still\npsychologists nowadays?—have never yet exhausted their bitter\nand manifold enjoyment of the betise bourgeoise, just as\nthough . . . in short, they betray something thereby. Flaubert,\nfor instance, the honest citizen of Rouen, neither saw, heard, nor\ntasted anything else in the end; it was his mode of self-torment\nand refined cruelty. As this is growing wearisome, I would now\nrecommend for a change something else for a pleasure—namely, the\nunconscious astuteness with which good, fat, honest mediocrity\nalways behaves towards loftier spirits and the tasks they have to\nperform, the subtle, barbed, Jesuitical astuteness, which is a\nthousand times subtler than the taste and understanding of the\nmiddle-class in its best moments—subtler even than the\nunderstanding of its victims:—a repeated proof that “instinct” is\nthe most intelligent of all kinds of intelligence which have\nhitherto been discovered. In short, you psychologists, study the\nphilosophy of the “rule” in its struggle with the “exception”:\nthere you have a spectacle fit for Gods and godlike malignity! Or,\nin plainer words, practise vivisection on “good people,” on the\n\"homo bonae voluntatis,” ON YOURSELVES!",
        "219. The practice of judging and condemning morally, is the\nfavourite revenge of the intellectually shallow on those who are\nless so, it is also a kind of indemnity for their being badly\nendowed by nature, and finally, it is an opportunity for\nacquiring spirit and BECOMING subtle—malice spiritualises. They\nare glad in their inmost heart that there is a standard according\nto which those who are over-endowed with intellectual goods and\nprivileges, are equal to them, they contend for the “equality of\nall before God,” and almost NEED the belief in God for this\npurpose. It is among them that the most powerful antagonists of\natheism are found. If any one were to say to them “A lofty\nspirituality is beyond all comparison with the honesty and\nrespectability of a merely moral man\"—it would make them\nfurious, I shall take care not to say so. I would rather flatter\nthem with my theory that lofty spirituality itself exists only as\nthe ultimate product of moral qualities, that it is a synthesis\nof all qualities attributed to the “merely moral” man, after they\nhave been acquired singly through long training and practice,\nperhaps during a whole series of generations, that lofty\nspirituality is precisely the spiritualising of justice, and the\nbeneficent severity which knows that it is authorized to maintain\nGRADATIONS OF RANK in the world, even among things—and not only\namong men.",
        "220. Now that the praise of the “disinterested person” is so\npopular one must—probably not without some danger—get an idea\nof WHAT people actually take an interest in, and what are the\nthings generally which fundamentally and profoundly concern\nordinary men—including the cultured, even the learned, and\nperhaps philosophers also, if appearances do not deceive. The\nfact thereby becomes obvious that the greater part of what\ninterests and charms higher natures, and more refined and\nfastidious tastes, seems absolutely “uninteresting” to the\naverage man—if, notwithstanding, he perceive devotion to these\ninterests, he calls it desinteresse, and wonders how it is\npossible to act “disinterestedly.” There have been philosophers\nwho could give this popular astonishment a seductive and\nmystical, other-worldly expression (perhaps because they did not\nknow the higher nature by experience?), instead of stating the\nnaked and candidly reasonable truth that “disinterested\" action\nis very interesting and “interested\" action, provided that. . .\n\"And love?\"—What! Even an action for love’s sake shall be\n\"unegoistic”? But you fools—! “And the praise of the self-\nsacrificer?\"—But whoever has really offered sacrifice knows that\nhe wanted and obtained something for it—perhaps something from\nhimself for something from himself; that he relinquished here in\norder to have more there, perhaps in general to be more, or even\nfeel himself “more.” But this is a realm of questions and answers\nin which a more fastidious spirit does not like to stay: for here\ntruth has to stifle her yawns so much when she is obliged to\nanswer. And after all, truth is a woman; one must not use force\nwith her.",
        "221. “It sometimes happens,” said a moralistic pedant and trifle-\nretailer, “that I honour and respect an unselfish man: not,\nhowever, because he is unselfish, but because I think he has a\nright to be useful to another man at his own expense. In short,\nthe question is always who HE is, and who THE OTHER is. For\ninstance, in a person created and destined for command, self-\ndenial and modest retirement, instead of being virtues, would be\nthe waste of virtues: so it seems to me. Every system of\nunegoistic morality which takes itself unconditionally and\nappeals to every one, not only sins against good taste, but is\nalso an incentive to sins of omission, an ADDITIONAL seduction\nunder the mask of philanthropy—and precisely a seduction and\ninjury to the higher, rarer, and more privileged types of men.\nMoral systems must be compelled first of all to bow before the\nGRADATIONS OF RANK; their presumption must be driven home to\ntheir conscience—until they thoroughly understand at last that\nit is IMMORAL to say that ’what is right for one is proper for\nanother.’\"—So said my moralistic pedant and bonhomme. Did he\nperhaps deserve to be laughed at when he thus exhorted systems of\nmorals to practise morality? But one should not be too much in\nthe right if one wishes to have the laughers on ONE’S OWN side; a\ngrain of wrong pertains even to good taste.",

Wherever sympathy (fellow-suffering) is preached nowadays—\nand, if I gather rightly, no other religion is any longer\npreached—let the psychologist have his ears open through all the\nvanity, through all the noise which is natural to these preachers\n(as to all preachers), he will hear a hoarse, groaning, genuine\nnote of SELF-CONTEMPT. It belongs to the overshadowing and\nuglifying of Europe, which has been on the increase for a century\n(the first symptoms of which are already specified documentarily\nin a thoughtful letter of Galiani to Madame d’Epinay)—IF IT IS\nNOT REALLY THE CAUSE THEREOF!

To be sure, he notices that none of the\ncostumes fit him properly—he changes and changes. Let us look at\nthe nineteenth century with respect to these hasty preferences\nand changes in its masquerades of style, and also with respect to\nits moments of desperation on account of “nothing suiting” us. It\nis in vain to get ourselves up as romantic, or classical, or\nChristian, or Florentine, or barocco, or “national,” in moribus\net artibus: it does not “clothe us”! But the “spirit,” especially\nthe “historical spirit,” profits even by this desperation: once\nand again a new sample of the past or of the foreign is tested,\nput on, taken off, packed up, and above all studied—we are the\nfirst studious age in puncto of “costumes,” I mean as concerns\nmorals, articles of belief, artistic tastes, and religions; we\nare prepared as no other age has ever been for a carnival in the\ngrand style, for the most spiritual festival—laughter and\narrogance, for the transcendental height of supreme folly and\nAristophanic ridicule of the world. Perhaps we are still\ndiscovering the domain of our invention just here, the domain\nwhere even we can still be original, probably as parodists of the\nworld’s history and as God’s Merry-Andrews,—perhaps, though\nnothing else of the present have a future, our laughter itself\nmay have a future!",
        "224. The historical sense (or the capacity for divining quickly\nthe order of rank of the valuations according to which a people,\na community, or an individual has lived, the “divining instinct\"\nfor the relationships of these valuations, for the relation of\nthe authority of the valuations to the authority of the operating\nforces),—this historical sense, which we Europeans claim as our\nspecialty, has come to us in the train of the enchanting and mad\nsemi-barbarity into which Europe has been plunged by the\ndemocratic mingling of classes and races—it is only the\nnineteenth century that has recognized this faculty as its sixth\nsense. Owing to this mingling, the past of every form and mode of\nlife, and of cultures which were formerly closely contiguous and\nsuperimposed on one another, flows forth into us “modern souls\";\nour instincts now run back in all directions, we ourselves are a\nkind of chaos: in the end, as we have said, the spirit perceives\nits advantage therein. By means of our semi-barbarity in body and\nin desire, we have secret access everywhere, such as a noble age\nnever had; we have access above all to the labyrinth of imperfect\ncivilizations, and to every form of semi-barbarity that has at\nany time existed on earth; and in so far as the most considerable\npart of human civilization hitherto has just been semi-barbarity,\nthe “historical sense” implies almost the sense and instinct for\neverything, the taste and tongue for everything: whereby it\nimmediately proves itself to be an IGNOBLE sense. For instance,\nwe enjoy Homer once more: it is perhaps our happiest acquisition\nthat we know how to appreciate Homer, whom men of distinguished\nculture (as the French of the seventeenth century, like Saint-\nEvremond, who reproached him for his ESPRIT VASTE, and even\nVoltaire, the last echo of the century) cannot and could not so\neasily appropriate—whom they scarcely permitted themselves to\nenjoy. The very decided Yea and Nay of their palate, their\npromptly ready disgust, their hesitating reluctance with regard\nto everything strange, their horror of the bad taste even of\nlively curiosity, and in general the averseness of every\ndistinguished and self-sufficing culture to avow a new desire, a\ndissatisfaction with its own condition, or an admiration of what\nis strange: all this determines and disposes them unfavourably\neven towards the best things of the world which are not their\nproperty or could not become their prey—and no faculty is more\nunintelligible to such men than just this historical sense, with\nits truckling, plebeian curiosity. The case is not different with\nShakespeare, that marvelous Spanish-Moorish-Saxon synthesis of\ntaste, over whom an ancient Athenian of the circle of Eschylus\nwould have half-killed himself with laughter or irritation: but\nwe—accept precisely this wild motleyness, this medley of the\nmost delicate, the most coarse, and the most artificial, with a\nsecret confidence and cordiality; we enjoy it as a refinement of\nart reserved expressly for us, and allow ourselves to be as\nlittle disturbed by the repulsive fumes and the proximity of the\nEnglish populace in which Shakespeare’s art and taste lives, as\nperhaps on the Chiaja of Naples, where, with all our senses\nawake, we go our way, enchanted and voluntarily, in spite of the\ndrain-odour of the lower quarters of the town. That as men of the\n\"historical sense” we have our virtues, is not to be disputed:—\nwe are unpretentious, unselfish, modest, brave, habituated to\nself-control and self-renunciation, very grateful, very patient,\nvery complaisant—but with all this we are perhaps not very\n\"tasteful.” Let us finally confess it, that what is most\ndifficult for us men of the “historical sense” to grasp, feel,\ntaste, and love, what finds us fundamentally prejudiced and\nalmost hostile, is precisely the perfection and ultimate maturity\nin every culture and art, the essentially noble in works and men,\ntheir moment of smooth sea and halcyon self-sufficiency, the\ngoldenness and coldness which all things show that have perfected\nthemselves. Perhaps our great virtue of the historical sense is\nin necessary contrast to GOOD taste, at least to the very bad\ntaste; and we can only evoke in ourselves imperfectly,\nhesitatingly, and with compulsion the small, short, and happy\ngodsends and glorifications of human life as they shine here and\nthere: those moments and marvelous experiences when a great power\nhas voluntarily come to a halt before the boundless and\ninfinite,—when a super-abundance of refined delight has been\nenjoyed by a sudden checking and petrifying, by standing firmly\nand planting oneself fixedly on still trembling ground.\nPROPORTIONATENESS is strange to us, let us confess it to\nourselves; our itching is really the itching for the infinite,\nthe immeasurable. Like the rider on his forward panting horse, we\nlet the reins fall before the infinite, we modern men, we semi-\nbarbarians—and are only in OUR highest bliss when we—ARE IN\nMOST DANGER.",

Whether it be hedonism, pessimism, utilitarianism, or\neudaemonism, all those modes of thinking which measure the worth\nof things according to PLEASURE and PAIN, that is, according to\naccompanying circumstances and secondary considerations, are\nplausible modes of thought and naivetes, which every one\nconscious of CREATIVE powers and an artist’s conscience will look\ndown upon with scorn, though not without sympathy. Sympathy for\nyou!—to be sure, that is not sympathy as you understand it: it\nis not sympathy for social “distress,” for “society” with its\nsick and misfortuned, for the hereditarily vicious and defective\nwho lie on the ground around us; still less is it sympathy for\nthe grumbling, vexed, revolutionary slave-classes who strive\nafter power—they call it “freedom.” OUR sympathy is a loftier\nand further-sighted sympathy:—we see how MAN dwarfs himself, how\nYOU dwarf him! and there are moments when we view YOUR sympathy\nwith an indescribable anguish, when we resist it,—when we regard\nyour seriousness as more dangerous than any kind of levity. You\nwant, if possible—and there is not a more foolish “if possible\"\n—TO DO AWAY WITH SUFFERING; and we?—it really seems that WE\nwould rather have it increased and made worse than it has ever\nbeen! Well-being, as you understand it—is certainly not a goal;\nit seems to us an END; a condition which at once renders man\nludicrous and contemptible—and makes his destruction DESIRABLE!\nThe discipline of suffering, of GREAT suffering—know ye not that\nit is only THIS discipline that has produced all the elevations\nof humanity hitherto? The tension of soul in misfortune which\ncommunicates to it its energy, its shuddering in view of rack and\nruin, its inventiveness and bravery in undergoing, enduring,\ninterpreting, and exploiting misfortune, and whatever depth,\nmystery, disguise, spirit, artifice, or greatness has been\nbestowed upon the soul—has it not been bestowed through\nsuffering, through the discipline of great suffering? In man\nCREATURE and CREATOR are united: in man there is not only matter,\nshred, excess, clay, mire, folly, chaos; but there is also the\ncreator, the sculptor, the hardness of the hammer, the divinity\nof the spectator, and the seventh day—do ye understand this\ncontrast? And that YOUR sympathy for the “creature in man\"\napplies to that which has to be fashioned, bruised, forged,\nstretched, roasted, annealed, refined—to that which must\nnecessarily SUFFER, and IS MEANT to suffer? And our sympathy—do\nye not understand what our REVERSE sympathy applies to, when it\nresists your sympathy as the worst of all pampering and\nenervation?—So it is sympathy AGAINST sympathy!—But to repeat\nit once more, there are higher problems than the problems of\npleasure and pain and sympathy; and all systems of philosophy\nwhich deal only with these are naivetes.",

And if,\nnevertheless, our honesty should one day grow weary, and sigh,\nand stretch its limbs, and find us too hard, and would fain have\nit pleasanter, easier, and gentler, like an agreeable vice, let\nus remain HARD, we latest Stoics, and let us send to its help\nwhatever devilry we have in us:—our disgust at the clumsy and\nundefined, our “NITIMUR IN VETITUM,” our love of adventure, our\nsharpened and fastidious curiosity, our most subtle, disguised,\nintellectual Will to Power and universal conquest, which rambles\nand roves avidiously around all the realms of the future—let us\ngo with all our “devils” to the help of our “God”!

I hope to be forgiven for discovering that all moral\nphilosophy hitherto has been tedious and has belonged to the\nsoporific appliances—and that “virtue,” in my opinion, has been\nMORE injured by the TEDIOUSNESS of its advocates than by anything\nelse; at the same time, however, I would not wish to overlook\ntheir general usefulness. It is desirable that as few people as\npossible should reflect upon morals, and consequently it is very\ndesirable that morals should not some day become interesting! But\nlet us not be afraid! Things still remain today as they have\nalways been: I see no one in Europe who has (or DISCLOSES) an\nidea of the fact that philosophizing concerning morals might be\nconducted in a dangerous, captious, and ensnaring manner—that\nCALAMITY might be involved therein. Observe, for example, the\nindefatigable, inevitable English utilitarians: how ponderously\nand respectably they stalk on, stalk along (a Homeric metaphor\nexpresses it better) in the footsteps of Bentham, just as he had\nalready stalked in the footsteps of the respectable Helvetius!\n(no, he was not a dangerous man, Helvetius, CE SENATEUR\nPOCOCURANTE, to use an expression of Galiani). No new thought,\nnothing of the nature of a finer turning or better expression of\nan old thought, not even a proper history of what has been\npreviously thought on the subject: an IMPOSSIBLE literature,\ntaking it all in all, unless one knows how to leaven it with some\nmischief. In effect, the old English vice called CANT, which is\nMORAL TARTUFFISM, has insinuated itself also into these moralists\n(whom one must certainly read with an eye to their motives if one\nMUST read them), concealed this time under the new form of the\nscientific spirit; moreover, there is not absent from them a\nsecret struggle with the pangs of conscience, from which a race\nof former Puritans must naturally suffer, in all their scientific\ntinkering with morals. (Is not a moralist the opposite of a\nPuritan? That is to say, as a thinker who regards morality as\nquestionable, as worthy of interrogation, in short, as a problem?\nIs moralizing not-immoral?) In the end, they all want English\nmorality to be recognized as authoritative, inasmuch as mankind,\nor the “general utility,” or “the happiness of the greatest\nnumber,\"—no! the happiness of ENGLAND, will be best served\nthereby. They would like, by all means, to convince themselves\nthat the striving after English happiness, I mean after COMFORT\nand FASHION (and in the highest instance, a seat in Parliament),\nis at the same time the true path of virtue; in fact, that in so\nfar as there has been virtue in the world hitherto, it has just\nconsisted in such striving. Not one of those ponderous,\nconscience-stricken herding-animals (who undertake to advocate\nthe cause of egoism as conducive to the general welfare) wants to\nhave any knowledge or inkling of the facts that the “general\nwelfare” is no ideal, no goal, no notion that can be at all\ngrasped, but is only a nostrum,—that what is fair to one MAY NOT\nat all be fair to another, that the requirement of one morality\nfor all is really a detriment to higher men, in short, that there\nis a DISTINCTION OF RANK between man and man, and consequently\nbetween morality and morality. They are an unassuming and\nfundamentally mediocre species of men, these utilitarian\nEnglishmen, and, as already remarked, in so far as they are\ntedious, one cannot think highly enough of their utility. One\nought even to ENCOURAGE them, as has been partially attempted in\nthe following rhymes:—",
        "229. In these later ages, which may be proud of their humanity,\nthere still remains so much fear, so much SUPERSTITION of the\nfear, of the “cruel wild beast,” the mastering of which\nconstitutes the very pride of these humaner ages—that even\nobvious truths, as if by the agreement of centuries, have long\nremained unuttered, because they have the appearance of helping\nthe finally slain wild beast back to life again. I perhaps risk\nsomething when I allow such a truth to escape; let others capture\nit again and give it so much “milk of pious sentiment\"\n[FOOTNOTE: An expression from Schiller’s William Tell, Act IV,\nScene 3.] to drink, that it will lie down quiet and forgotten, in\nits old corner.—One ought to learn anew about cruelty, and open\none’s eyes; one ought at last to learn impatience, in order that\nsuch immodest gross errors—as, for instance, have been fostered\nby ancient and modern philosophers with regard to tragedy—may no\nlonger wander about virtuously and boldly. Almost everything that\nwe call “higher culture” is based upon the spiritualising and\nintensifying of CRUELTY—this is my thesis; the “wild beast” has\nnot been slain at all, it lives, it flourishes, it has only been—\ntransfigured. That which constitutes the painful delight of\ntragedy is cruelty; that which operates agreeably in so-called\ntragic sympathy, and at the basis even of everything sublime, up\nto the highest and most delicate thrills of metaphysics, obtains\nits sweetness solely from the intermingled ingredient of cruelty.\nWhat the Roman enjoys in the arena, the Christian in the\necstasies of the cross, the Spaniard at the sight of the faggot\nand stake, or of the bull-fight, the present-day Japanese who\npresses his way to the tragedy, the workman of the Parisian\nsuburbs who has a homesickness for bloody revolutions, the\nWagnerienne who, with unhinged will, “undergoes” the performance\nof “Tristan and Isolde\"—what all these enjoy, and strive with\nmysterious ardour to drink in, is the philtre of the great Circe\n\"cruelty.” Here, to be sure, we must put aside entirely the\nblundering psychology of former times, which could only teach\nwith regard to cruelty that it originated at the sight of the\nsuffering of OTHERS: there is an abundant, super-abundant\nenjoyment even in one’s own suffering, in causing one’s own\nsuffering—and wherever man has allowed himself to be persuaded\nto self-denial in the RELIGIOUS sense, or to self-mutilation, as\namong the Phoenicians and ascetics, or in general, to\ndesensualisation, decarnalisation, and contrition, to Puritanical\nrepentance-spasms, to vivisection of conscience and to Pascal-\nlike SACRIFIZIA DELL’ INTELLETO, he is secretly allured and\nimpelled forwards by his cruelty, by the dangerous thrill of\ncruelty TOWARDS HIMSELF.—Finally, let us consider that even the\nseeker of knowledge operates as an artist and glorifier of\ncruelty, in that he compels his spirit to perceive AGAINST its\nown inclination, and often enough against the wishes of his\nheart:—he forces it to say Nay, where he would like to affirm,\nlove, and adore; indeed, every instance of taking a thing\nprofoundly and fundamentally, is a violation, an intentional\ninjuring of the fundamental will of the spirit, which\ninstinctively aims at appearance and superficiality,—even in\nevery desire for knowledge there is a drop of cruelty.",
        "230. Perhaps what I have said here about a “fundamental will of\nthe spirit” may not be understood without further details; I may\nbe allowed a word of explanation.—That imperious something which\nis popularly called “the spirit,” wishes to be master internally\nand externally, and to feel itself master; it has the will of a\nmultiplicity for a simplicity, a binding, taming, imperious, and\nessentially ruling will. Its requirements and capacities here,\nare the same as those assigned by physiologists to everything\nthat lives, grows, and multiplies. The power of the spirit to\nappropriate foreign elements reveals itself in a strong tendency\nto assimilate the new to the old, to simplify the manifold, to\noverlook or repudiate the absolutely contradictory; just as it\narbitrarily re-underlines, makes prominent, and falsifies for\nitself certain traits and lines in the foreign elements, in every\nportion of the “outside world.” Its object thereby is the\nincorporation of new “experiences,” the assortment of new things\nin the old arrangements—in short, growth; or more properly, the\nFEELING of growth, the feeling of increased power—is its object.\nThis same will has at its service an apparently opposed impulse\nof the spirit, a suddenly adopted preference of ignorance, of\narbitrary shutting out, a closing of windows, an inner denial of\nthis or that, a prohibition to approach, a sort of defensive\nattitude against much that is knowable, a contentment with\nobscurity, with the shutting-in horizon, an acceptance and\napproval of ignorance: as that which is all necessary according\nto the degree of its appropriating power, its “digestive power,\"\nto speak figuratively (and in fact “the spirit” resembles a\nstomach more than anything else). Here also belong an occasional\npropensity of the spirit to let itself be deceived (perhaps with\na waggish suspicion that it is NOT so and so, but is only allowed\nto pass as such), a delight in uncertainty and ambiguity, an\nexulting enjoyment of arbitrary, out-of-the-way narrowness and\nmystery, of the too-near, of the foreground, of the magnified,\nthe diminished, the misshapen, the beautified—an enjoyment of\nthe arbitrariness of all these manifestations of power. Finally,\nin this connection, there is the not unscrupulous readiness of\nthe spirit to deceive other spirits and dissemble before them—\nthe constant pressing and straining of a creating, shaping,\nchangeable power: the spirit enjoys therein its craftiness and\nits variety of disguises, it enjoys also its feeling of security\ntherein—it is precisely by its Protean arts that it is best\nprotected and concealed!—COUNTER TO this propensity for\nappearance, for simplification, for a disguise, for a cloak, in\nshort, for an outside—for every outside is a cloak—there\noperates the sublime tendency of the man of knowledge, which\ntakes, and INSISTS on taking things profoundly, variously, and\nthoroughly; as a kind of cruelty of the intellectual conscience\nand taste, which every courageous thinker will acknowledge in\nhimself, provided, as it ought to be, that he has sharpened and\nhardened his eye sufficiently long for introspection, and is\naccustomed to severe discipline and even severe words. He will\nsay: “There is something cruel in the tendency of my spirit”: let\nthe virtuous and amiable try to convince him that it is not so!\nIn fact, it would sound nicer, if, instead of our cruelty,\nperhaps our “extravagant honesty” were talked about, whispered\nabout, and glorified—we free, VERY free spirits—and some day\nperhaps SUCH will actually be our—posthumous glory! Meanwhile—\nfor there is plenty of time until then—we should be least\ninclined to deck ourselves out in such florid and fringed moral\nverbiage; our whole former work has just made us sick of this\ntaste and its sprightly exuberance. They are beautiful,\nglistening, jingling, festive words: honesty, love of truth, love\nof wisdom, sacrifice for knowledge, heroism of the truthful—\nthere is something in them that makes one’s heart swell with\npride. But we anchorites and marmots have long ago persuaded\nourselves in all the secrecy of an anchorite’s conscience, that\nthis worthy parade of verbiage also belongs to the old false\nadornment, frippery, and gold-dust of unconscious human vanity,\nand that even under such flattering colour and repainting, the\nterrible original text HOMO NATURA must again be recognized. In\neffect, to translate man back again into nature; to master the\nmany vain and visionary interpretations and subordinate meanings\nwhich have hitherto been scratched and daubed over the eternal\noriginal text, HOMO NATURA; to bring it about that man shall\nhenceforth stand before man as he now, hardened by the discipline\nof science, stands before the OTHER forms of nature, with\nfearless Oedipus-eyes, and stopped Ulysses-ears, deaf to the\nenticements of old metaphysical bird-catchers, who have piped to\nhim far too long: “Thou art more! thou art higher! thou hast a\ndifferent origin!\"—this may be a strange and foolish task, but\nthat it is a TASK, who can deny! Why did we choose it, this\nfoolish task? Or, to put the question differently: “Why knowledge\nat all?” Every one will ask us about this. And thus pressed, we,\nwho have asked ourselves the question a hundred times, have not\nfound and cannot find any better answer. . . .",
        "231. Learning alters us, it does what all nourishment does that\ndoes not merely “conserve\"—as the physiologist knows. But at the\nbottom of our souls, quite “down below,” there is certainly\nsomething unteachable, a granite of spiritual fate, of\npredetermined decision and answer to predetermined, chosen\nquestions. In each cardinal problem there speaks an unchangeable\n\"I am this\"; a thinker cannot learn anew about man and woman, for\ninstance, but can only learn fully—he can only follow to the end\nwhat is “fixed” about them in himself. Occasionally we find\ncertain solutions of problems which make strong beliefs for us;\nperhaps they are henceforth called “convictions.” Later on—one\nsees in them only footsteps to self-knowledge, guide-posts to the\nproblem which we ourselves ARE—or more correctly to the great\nstupidity which we embody, our spiritual fate, the UNTEACHABLE in\nus, quite “down below.\"—In view of this liberal compliment which\nI have just paid myself, permission will perhaps be more readily\nallowed me to utter some truths about “woman as she is,” provided\nthat it is known at the outset how literally they are merely—MY\ntruths.",
        "232. Woman wishes to be independent, and therefore she begins to\nenlighten men about “woman as she is\"—THIS is one of the worst\ndevelopments of the general UGLIFYING of Europe. For what must\nthese clumsy attempts of feminine scientificality and self-\nexposure bring to light! Woman has so much cause for shame; in\nwoman there is so much pedantry, superficiality,\nschoolmasterliness, petty presumption, unbridledness, and\nindiscretion concealed—study only woman’s behaviour towards\nchildren!—which has really been best restrained and dominated\nhitherto by the FEAR of man. Alas, if ever the “eternally tedious\nin woman\"—she has plenty of it!—is allowed to venture forth! if\nshe begins radically and on principle to unlearn her wisdom and\nart-of charming, of playing, of frightening away sorrow, of\nalleviating and taking easily; if she forgets her delicate\naptitude for agreeable desires! Female voices are already raised,\nwhich, by Saint Aristophanes! make one afraid:—with medical\nexplicitness it is stated in a threatening manner what woman\nfirst and last REQUIRES from man. Is it not in the very worst\ntaste that woman thus sets herself up to be scientific?\nEnlightenment hitherto has fortunately been men’s affair, men’s\ngift-we remained therewith “among ourselves\"; and in the end, in\nview of all that women write about “woman,” we may well have\nconsiderable doubt as to whether woman really DESIRES\nenlightenment about herself—and CAN desire it. If woman does not\nthereby seek a new ORNAMENT for herself—I believe ornamentation\nbelongs to the eternally feminine?—why, then, she wishes to make\nherself feared: perhaps she thereby wishes to get the mastery.\nBut she does not want truth—what does woman care for truth? From\nthe very first, nothing is more foreign, more repugnant, or more\nhostile to woman than truth—her great art is falsehood, her\nchief concern is appearance and beauty. Let us confess it, we\nmen: we honour and love this very art and this very instinct in\nwoman: we who have the hard task, and for our recreation gladly\nseek the company of beings under whose hands, glances, and\ndelicate follies, our seriousness, our gravity, and profundity\nappear almost like follies to us. Finally, I ask the question:\nDid a woman herself ever acknowledge profundity in a woman’s\nmind, or justice in a woman’s heart? And is it not true that on\nthe whole “woman” has hitherto been most despised by woman\nherself, and not at all by us?—We men desire that woman should\nnot continue to compromise herself by enlightening us; just as it\nwas man’s care and the consideration for woman, when the church\ndecreed: mulier taceat in ecclesia. It was to the benefit of\nwoman when Napoleon gave the too eloquent Madame de Stael to\nunderstand: mulier taceat in politicis!—and in my opinion, he is\na true friend of woman who calls out to women today: mulier\ntaceat de mulierel.",
        "233. It betrays corruption of the instincts—apart from the fact\nthat it betrays bad taste—when a woman refers to Madame Roland,\nor Madame de Stael, or Monsieur George Sand, as though something\nwere proved thereby in favour of “woman as she is.” Among men,\nthese are the three comical women as they are—nothing more!—and\njust the best involuntary counter-arguments against feminine\nemancipation and autonomy.",

        "238. To be mistaken in the fundamental problem of “man and\nwoman,” to deny here the profoundest antagonism and the necessity\nfor an eternally hostile tension, to dream here perhaps of equal\nrights, equal training, equal claims and obligations: that is a\nTYPICAL sign of shallow-mindedness; and a thinker who has proved\nhimself shallow at this dangerous spot—shallow in instinct!—may\ngenerally be regarded as suspicious, nay more, as betrayed, as\ndiscovered; he will probably prove too “short” for all\nfundamental questions of life, future as well as present, and\nwill be unable to descend into ANY of the depths. On the other\nhand, a man who has depth of spirit as well as of desires, and\nhas also the depth of benevolence which is capable of severity\nand harshness, and easily confounded with them, can only think of\nwoman as ORIENTALS do: he must conceive of her as a possession,\nas confinable property, as a being predestined for service and\naccomplishing her mission therein—he must take his stand in this\nmatter upon the immense rationality of Asia, upon the superiority\nof the instinct of Asia, as the Greeks did formerly; those best\nheirs and scholars of Asia—who, as is well known, with their\nINCREASING culture and amplitude of power, from Homer to the time\nof Pericles, became gradually STRICTER towards woman, in short,\nmore Oriental. HOW necessary, HOW logical, even HOW humanely\ndesirable this was, let us consider for ourselves!",
        "239. The weaker sex has in no previous age been treated with so\nmuch respect by men as at present—this belongs to the tendency\nand fundamental taste of democracy, in the same way as\ndisrespectfulness to old age—what wonder is it that abuse should\nbe immediately made of this respect? They want more, they learn\nto make claims, the tribute of respect is at last felt to be\nwell-nigh galling; rivalry for rights, indeed actual strife\nitself, would be preferred: in a word, woman is losing modesty.\nAnd let us immediately add that she is also losing taste. She is\nunlearning to FEAR man: but the woman who “unlearns to fear\"\nsacrifices her most womanly instincts. That woman should venture\nforward when the fear-inspiring quality in man—or more\ndefinitely, the MAN in man—is no longer either desired or fully\ndeveloped, is reasonable enough and also intelligible enough;\nwhat is more difficult to understand is that precisely thereby—\nwoman deteriorates. This is what is happening nowadays: let us\nnot deceive ourselves about it! Wherever the industrial spirit\nhas triumphed over the military and aristocratic spirit, woman\nstrives for the economic and legal independence of a clerk:\n\"woman as clerkess” is inscribed on the portal of the modern\nsociety which is in course of formation. While she thus\nappropriates new rights, aspires to be “master,” and inscribes\n\"progress” of woman on her flags and banners, the very opposite\nrealises itself with terrible obviousness: WOMAN RETROGRADES.\nSince the French Revolution the influence of woman in Europe has\nDECLINED in proportion as she has increased her rights and\nclaims; and the “emancipation of woman,” insofar as it is desired\nand demanded by women themselves (and not only by masculine\nshallow-pates), thus proves to be a remarkable symptom of the\nincreased weakening and deadening of the most womanly instincts.\nThere is STUPIDITY in this movement, an almost masculine\nstupidity, of which a well-reared woman—who is always a sensible\nwoman—might be heartily ashamed. To lose the intuition as to the\nground upon which she can most surely achieve victory; to neglect\nexercise in the use of her proper weapons; to let-herself-go\nbefore man, perhaps even “to the book,” where formerly she kept\nherself in control and in refined, artful humility; to neutralize\nwith her virtuous audacity man’s faith in a VEILED, fundamentally\ndifferent ideal in woman, something eternally, necessarily\nfeminine; to emphatically and loquaciously dissuade man from the\nidea that woman must be preserved, cared for, protected, and\nindulged, like some delicate, strangely wild, and often pleasant\ndomestic animal; the clumsy and indignant collection of\neverything of the nature of servitude and bondage which the\nposition of woman in the hitherto existing order of society has\nentailed and still entails (as though slavery were a counter-\nargument, and not rather a condition of every higher culture, of\nevery elevation of culture):—what does all this betoken, if not\na disintegration of womanly instincts, a defeminising? Certainly,\nthere are enough of idiotic friends and corrupters of woman among\nthe learned asses of the masculine sex, who advise woman to\ndefeminize herself in this manner, and to imitate all the\nstupidities from which “man” in Europe, European “manliness,\"\nsuffers,—who would like to lower woman to “general culture,\"\nindeed even to newspaper reading and meddling with politics. Here\nand there they wish even to make women into free spirits and\nliterary workers: as though a woman without piety would not be\nsomething perfectly obnoxious or ludicrous to a profound and\ngodless man;—almost everywhere her nerves are being ruined by\nthe most morbid and dangerous kind of music (our latest German\nmusic), and she is daily being made more hysterical and more\nincapable of fulfilling her first and last function, that of\nbearing robust children. They wish to “cultivate” her in general\nstill more, and intend, as they say, to make the “weaker sex\"\nSTRONG by culture: as if history did not teach in the most\nemphatic manner that the “cultivating” of mankind and his\nweakening—that is to say, the weakening, dissipating, and\nlanguishing of his FORCE OF WILL—have always kept pace with one\nanother, and that the most powerful and influential women in the\nworld (and lastly, the mother of Napoleon) had just to thank\ntheir force of will—and not their schoolmasters—for their\npower and ascendancy over men. That which inspires respect in\nwoman, and often enough fear also, is her NATURE, which is more\n\"natural” than that of man, her genuine, carnivora-like, cunning\nflexibility, her tiger-claws beneath the glove, her NAIVETE in\negoism, her untrainableness and innate wildness, the\nincomprehensibleness, extent, and deviation of her desires and\nvirtues. That which, in spite of fear, excites one’s sympathy for\nthe dangerous and beautiful cat, “woman,” is that she seems more\nafflicted, more vulnerable, more necessitous of love, and more\ncondemned to disillusionment than any other creature. Fear and\nsympathy it is with these feelings that man has hitherto stood in\nthe presence of woman, always with one foot already in tragedy,\nwhich rends while it delights—What? And all that is now to be at\nan end? And the DISENCHANTMENT of woman is in progress? The\ntediousness of woman is slowly evolving? Oh Europe! Europe! We\nknow the horned animal which was always most attractive to thee,\nfrom which danger is ever again threatening thee! Thy old fable\nmight once more become “history\"—an immense stupidity might once\nagain overmaster thee and carry thee away! And no God concealed\nbeneath it—no! only an “idea,” a “modern idea”!",
        "\n240. I HEARD, once again for the first time, Richard Wagner’s\noverture to the Mastersinger: it is a piece of magnificent,\ngorgeous, heavy, latter-day art, which has the pride to\npresuppose two centuries of music as still living, in order that\nit may be understood:—it is an honour to Germans that such a\npride did not miscalculate! What flavours and forces, what\nseasons and climes do we not find mingled in it! It impresses us\nat one time as ancient, at another time as foreign, bitter, and\ntoo modern, it is as arbitrary as it is pompously traditional, it\nis not infrequently roguish, still oftener rough and coarse—it\nhas fire and courage, and at the same time the loose, dun-\ncoloured skin of fruits which ripen too late. It flows broad and\nfull: and suddenly there is a moment of inexplicable hesitation,\nlike a gap that opens between cause and effect, an oppression\nthat makes us dream, almost a nightmare; but already it broadens\nand widens anew, the old stream of delight-the most manifold\ndelight,—of old and new happiness; including ESPECIALLY the joy\nof the artist in himself, which he refuses to conceal, his\nastonished, happy cognizance of his mastery of the expedients\nhere employed, the new, newly acquired, imperfectly tested\nexpedients of art which he apparently betrays to us. All in all,\nhowever, no beauty, no South, nothing of the delicate southern\nclearness of the sky, nothing of grace, no dance, hardly a will\nto logic; a certain clumsiness even, which is also emphasized, as\nthough the artist wished to say to us: “It is part of my\nintention\"; a cumbersome drapery, something arbitrarily barbaric\nand ceremonious, a flirring of learned and venerable conceits and\nwitticisms; something German in the best and worst sense of the\nword, something in the German style, manifold, formless, and\ninexhaustible; a certain German potency and super-plenitude of\nsoul, which is not afraid to hide itself under the RAFFINEMENTS\nof decadence—which, perhaps, feels itself most at ease there; a\nreal, genuine token of the German soul, which is at the same time\nyoung and aged, too ripe and yet still too rich in futurity. This\nkind of music expresses best what I think of the Germans: they\nbelong to the day before yesterday and the day after tomorrow—\nTHEY HAVE AS YET NO TODAY.",
        "241. We “good Europeans,” we also have hours when we allow\nourselves a warm-hearted patriotism, a plunge and relapse into\nold loves and narrow views—I have just given an example of it—\nhours of national excitement, of patriotic anguish, and all other\nsorts of old-fashioned floods of sentiment. Duller spirits may\nperhaps only get done with what confines its operations in us to\nhours and plays itself out in hours—in a considerable time: some\nin half a year, others in half a lifetime, according to the speed\nand strength with which they digest and “change their material.\"\nIndeed, I could think of sluggish, hesitating races, which even\nin our rapidly moving Europe, would require half a century ere\nthey could surmount such atavistic attacks of patriotism and\nsoil-attachment, and return once more to reason, that is to say,\nto “good Europeanism.” And while digressing on this possibility,\nI happen to become an ear-witness of a conversation between two\nold patriots—they were evidently both hard of hearing and\nconsequently spoke all the louder. “HE has as much, and knows as\nmuch, philosophy as a peasant or a corps-student,” said the one—\n\"he is still innocent. But what does that matter nowadays! It is\nthe age of the masses: they lie on their belly before everything\nthat is massive. And so also in politicis. A statesman who rears\nup for them a new Tower of Babel, some monstrosity of empire and\npower, they call ’great’—what does it matter that we more\nprudent and conservative ones do not meanwhile give up the old\nbelief that it is only the great thought that gives greatness to\nan action or affair. Supposing a statesman were to bring his\npeople into the position of being obliged henceforth to practise\n’high politics,’ for which they were by nature badly endowed and\nprepared, so that they would have to sacrifice their old and\nreliable virtues, out of love to a new and doubtful mediocrity;—\nsupposing a statesman were to condemn his people generally to\n’practise politics,’ when they have hitherto had something better\nto do and think about, and when in the depths of their souls they\nhave been unable to free themselves from a prudent loathing of\nthe restlessness, emptiness, and noisy wranglings of the\nessentially politics-practising nations;—supposing such a\nstatesman were to stimulate the slumbering passions and avidities\nof his people, were to make a stigma out of their former\ndiffidence and delight in aloofness, an offence out of their\nexoticism and hidden permanency, were to depreciate their most\nradical proclivities, subvert their consciences, make their minds\nnarrow, and their tastes ’national’—what! a statesman who should\ndo all this, which his people would have to do penance for\nthroughout their whole future, if they had a future, such a\nstatesman would be GREAT, would he?\"—\"Undoubtedly!” replied the\nother old patriot vehemently, “otherwise he COULD NOT have done\nit! It was mad perhaps to wish such a thing! But perhaps\neverything great has been just as mad at its commencement!\"—\n\"Misuse of words!” cried his interlocutor, contradictorily—\n\"strong! strong! Strong and mad! NOT great!\"—The old men had\nobviously become heated as they thus shouted their “truths” in\neach other’s faces, but I, in my happiness and apartness,\nconsidered how soon a stronger one may become master of the\nstrong, and also that there is a compensation for the\nintellectual superficialising of a nation—namely, in the\ndeepening of another.",
        "242. Whether we call it “civilization,” or “humanising,” or\n\"progress,” which now distinguishes the European, whether we call\nit simply, without praise or blame, by the political formula the\nDEMOCRATIC movement in Europe—behind all the moral and political\nforegrounds pointed to by such formulas, an immense PHYSIOLOGICAL\nPROCESS goes on, which is ever extending the process of the\nassimilation of Europeans, their increasing detachment from the\nconditions under which, climatically and hereditarily, united\nraces originate, their increasing independence of every definite\nmilieu, that for centuries would fain inscribe itself with equal\ndemands on soul and body,—that is to say, the slow emergence of\nan essentially SUPER-NATIONAL and nomadic species of man, who\npossesses, physiologically speaking, a maximum of the art and\npower of adaptation as his typical distinction. This process of\nthe EVOLVING EUROPEAN, which can be retarded in its TEMPO by\ngreat relapses, but will perhaps just gain and grow thereby in\nvehemence and depth—the still-raging storm and stress of\n\"national sentiment” pertains to it, and also the anarchism which\nis appearing at present—this process will probably arrive at\nresults on which its naive propagators and panegyrists, the\napostles of “modern ideas,” would least care to reckon. The same\nnew conditions under which on an average a levelling and\nmediocrising of man will take place—a useful, industrious,\nvariously serviceable, and clever gregarious man—are in the\nhighest degree suitable to give rise to exceptional men of the\nmost dangerous and attractive qualities. For, while the capacity\nfor adaptation, which is every day trying changing conditions,\nand begins a new work with every generation, almost with every\ndecade, makes the POWERFULNESS of the type impossible; while the\ncollective impression of such future Europeans will probably be\nthat of numerous, talkative, weak-willed, and very handy workmen\nwho REQUIRE a master, a commander, as they require their daily\nbread; while, therefore, the democratising of Europe will tend to\nthe production of a type prepared for SLAVERY in the most subtle\nsense of the term: the STRONG man will necessarily in individual\nand exceptional cases, become stronger and richer than he has\nperhaps ever been before—owing to the unprejudicedness of his\nschooling, owing to the immense variety of practice, art, and\ndisguise. I meant to say that the democratising of Europe is at\nthe same time an involuntary arrangement for the rearing of\nTYRANTS—taking the word in all its meanings, even in its most\nspiritual sense.",

        "244. There was a time when it was customary to call Germans\n\"deep” by way of distinction; but now that the most successful\ntype of new Germanism is covetous of quite other honours, and\nperhaps misses “smartness” in all that has depth, it is almost\nopportune and patriotic to doubt whether we did not formerly\ndeceive ourselves with that commendation: in short, whether\nGerman depth is not at bottom something different and worse—and\nsomething from which, thank God, we are on the point of\nsuccessfully ridding ourselves. Let us try, then, to relearn with\nregard to German depth; the only thing necessary for the purpose\nis a little vivisection of the German soul.—The German soul is\nabove all manifold, varied in its source, aggregated and super-\nimposed, rather than actually built: this is owing to its origin.\nA German who would embolden himself to assert: “Two souls, alas,\ndwell in my breast,” would make a bad guess at the truth, or,\nmore correctly, he would come far short of the truth about the\nnumber of souls. As a people made up of the most extraordinary\nmixing and mingling of races, perhaps even with a preponderance\nof the pre-Aryan element as the “people of the centre” in every\nsense of the term, the Germans are more intangible, more ample,\nmore contradictory, more unknown, more incalculable, more\nsurprising, and even more terrifying than other peoples are to\nthemselves:—they escape DEFINITION, and are thereby alone the\ndespair of the French. It IS characteristic of the Germans that\nthe question: “What is German?” never dies out among them.\nKotzebue certainly knew his Germans well enough: “We are known,\"\nthey cried jubilantly to him—but Sand also thought he knew them.\nJean Paul knew what he was doing when he declared himself\nincensed at Fichte’s lying but patriotic flatteries and\nexaggerations,—but it is probable that Goethe thought\ndifferently about Germans from Jean Paul, even though he\nacknowledged him to be right with regard to Fichte. It is a\nquestion what Goethe really thought about the Germans?—But about\nmany things around him he never spoke explicitly, and all his\nlife he knew how to keep an astute silence—probably he had good\nreason for it. It is certain that it was not the “Wars of\nIndependence” that made him look up more joyfully, any more than\nit was the French Revolution,—the event on account of which he\nRECONSTRUCTED his “Faust,” and indeed the whole problem of “man,\"\nwas the appearance of Napoleon. There are words of Goethe in\nwhich he condemns with impatient severity, as from a foreign\nland, that which Germans take a pride in, he once defined the\nfamous German turn of mind as “Indulgence towards its own and\nothers’ weaknesses.” Was he wrong? it is characteristic of\nGermans that one is seldom entirely wrong about them. The German\nsoul has passages and galleries in it, there are caves, hiding-\nplaces, and dungeons therein, its disorder has much of the charm\nof the mysterious, the German is well acquainted with the bypaths\nto chaos. And as everything loves its symbol, so the German loves\nthe clouds and all that is obscure, evolving, crepuscular, damp,\nand shrouded, it seems to him that everything uncertain,\nundeveloped, self-displacing, and growing is “deep”. The German\nhimself does not EXIST, he is BECOMING, he is “developing\nhimself”. “Development” is therefore the essentially German\ndiscovery and hit in the great domain of philosophical formulas,—\na ruling idea, which, together with German beer and German music,\nis labouring to Germanise all Europe. Foreigners are astonished\nand attracted by the riddles which the conflicting nature at the\nbasis of the German soul propounds to them (riddles which Hegel\nsystematised and Richard Wagner has in the end set to music).\n\"Good-natured and spiteful\"—such a juxtaposition, preposterous in\nthe case of every other people, is unfortunately only too often\njustified in Germany one has only to live for a while among\nSwabians to know this! The clumsiness of the German scholar and\nhis social distastefulness agree alarmingly well with his physical\nrope-dancing and nimble boldness, of which all the Gods have\nlearnt to be afraid. If any one wishes to see the “German soul\"\ndemonstrated ad oculos, let him only look at German taste, at\nGerman arts and manners what boorish indifference to “taste”! How\nthe noblest and the commonest stand there in juxtaposition! How\ndisorderly and how rich is the whole constitution of this soul!\nThe German DRAGS at his soul, he drags at everything he\nexperiences. He digests his events badly; he never gets “done\"\nwith them; and German depth is often only a difficult, hesitating\n\"digestion.” And just as all chronic invalids, all dyspeptics like\nwhat is convenient, so the German loves “frankness” and “honesty\";\nit is so CONVENIENT to be frank and honest!—This confidingness,\nthis complaisance, this showing-the-cards of German HONESTY, is\nprobably the most dangerous and most successful disguise which the\nGerman is up to nowadays: it is his proper Mephistophelean art;\nwith this he can “still achieve much”! The German lets himself go,\nand thereby gazes with faithful, blue, empty German eyes—and\nother countries immediately confound him with his\ndressing-gown!—I meant to say that, let “German depth” be what it\nwill—among ourselves alone we perhaps take the liberty to laugh\nat it—we shall do well to continue henceforth to honour its\nappearance and good name, and not barter away too cheaply our old\nreputation as a people of depth for Prussian “smartness,” and\nBerlin wit and sand. It is wise for a people to pose, and LET\nitself be regarded, as profound, clumsy, good-natured, honest, and\nfoolish: it might even be—profound to do so! Finally, we should\ndo honour to our name—we are not called the “TIUSCHE VOLK\"\n(deceptive people) for nothing. . . .",
        "245. The “good old” time is past, it sang itself out in Mozart—\nhow happy are WE that his ROCOCO still speaks to us, that his\n\"good company,” his tender enthusiasm, his childish delight in\nthe Chinese and its flourishes, his courtesy of heart, his\nlonging for the elegant, the amorous, the tripping, the tearful,\nand his belief in the South, can still appeal to SOMETHING LEFT\nin us! Ah, some time or other it will be over with it!—but who\ncan doubt that it will be over still sooner with the intelligence\nand taste for Beethoven! For he was only the last echo of a break\nand transition in style, and NOT, like Mozart, the last echo of a\ngreat European taste which had existed for centuries. Beethoven\nis the intermediate event between an old mellow soul that is\nconstantly breaking down, and a future over-young soul that is\nalways COMING; there is spread over his music the twilight of\neternal loss and eternal extravagant hope,—the same light in\nwhich Europe was bathed when it dreamed with Rousseau, when it\ndanced round the Tree of Liberty of the Revolution, and finally\nalmost fell down in adoration before Napoleon. But how rapidly\ndoes THIS very sentiment now pale, how difficult nowadays is even\nthe APPREHENSION of this sentiment, how strangely does the\nlanguage of Rousseau, Schiller, Shelley, and Byron sound to our\near, in whom COLLECTIVELY the same fate of Europe was able to\nSPEAK, which knew how to SING in Beethoven!—Whatever German\nmusic came afterwards, belongs to Romanticism, that is to say, to\na movement which, historically considered, was still shorter,\nmore fleeting, and more superficial than that great interlude,\nthe transition of Europe from Rousseau to Napoleon, and to the\nrise of democracy. Weber—but what do WE care nowadays for\n\"Freischutz” and “Oberon”! Or Marschner’s “Hans Heiling” and\n\"Vampyre”! Or even Wagner’s “Tannhauser”! That is extinct,\nalthough not yet forgotten music. This whole music of\nRomanticism, besides, was not noble enough, was not musical\nenough, to maintain its position anywhere but in the theatre and\nbefore the masses; from the beginning it was second-rate music,\nwhich was little thought of by genuine musicians. It was\ndifferent with Felix Mendelssohn, that halcyon master, who, on\naccount of his lighter, purer, happier soul, quickly acquired\nadmiration, and was equally quickly forgotten: as the beautiful\nEPISODE of German music. But with regard to Robert Schumann, who\ntook things seriously, and has been taken seriously from the\nfirst—he was the last that founded a school,—do we not now\nregard it as a satisfaction, a relief, a deliverance, that this\nvery Romanticism of Schumann’s has been surmounted? Schumann,\nfleeing into the “Saxon Switzerland” of his soul, with a half\nWerther-like, half Jean-Paul-like nature (assuredly not like\nBeethoven! assuredly not like Byron!)—his MANFRED music is a\nmistake and a misunderstanding to the extent of injustice;\nSchumann, with his taste, which was fundamentally a PETTY taste\n(that is to say, a dangerous propensity—doubly dangerous among\nGermans—for quiet lyricism and intoxication of the feelings),\ngoing constantly apart, timidly withdrawing and retiring, a noble\nweakling who revelled in nothing but anonymous joy and sorrow,\nfrom the beginning a sort of girl and NOLI ME TANGERE—this\nSchumann was already merely a GERMAN event in music, and no\nlonger a European event, as Beethoven had been, as in a still\ngreater degree Mozart had been; with Schumann German music was\nthreatened with its greatest danger, that of LOSING THE VOICE FOR\nTHE SOUL OF EUROPE and sinking into a merely national affair.",
        "246. What a torture are books written in German to a reader who\nhas a THIRD ear! How indignantly he stands beside the slowly\nturning swamp of sounds without tune and rhythms without dance,\nwhich Germans call a “book”! And even the German who READS books!\nHow lazily, how reluctantly, how badly he reads! How many Germans\nknow, and consider it obligatory to know, that there is ART in\nevery good sentence—art which must be divined, if the sentence\nis to be understood! If there is a misunderstanding about its\nTEMPO, for instance, the sentence itself is misunderstood! That\none must not be doubtful about the rhythm-determining syllables,\nthat one should feel the breaking of the too-rigid symmetry as\nintentional and as a charm, that one should lend a fine and\npatient ear to every STACCATO and every RUBATO, that one should\ndivine the sense in the sequence of the vowels and diphthongs,\nand how delicately and richly they can be tinted and retinted in\nthe order of their arrangement—who among book-reading Germans is\ncomplaisant enough to recognize such duties and requirements, and\nto listen to so much art and intention in language? After all,\none just “has no ear for it\"; and so the most marked contrasts of\nstyle are not heard, and the most delicate artistry is as it were\nSQUANDERED on the deaf.—These were my thoughts when I noticed\nhow clumsily and unintuitively two masters in the art of prose-\nwriting have been confounded: one, whose words drop down\nhesitatingly and coldly, as from the roof of a damp cave—he\ncounts on their dull sound and echo; and another who manipulates\nhis language like a flexible sword, and from his arm down into\nhis toes feels the dangerous bliss of the quivering, over-sharp\nblade, which wishes to bite, hiss, and cut.",
        "247. How little the German style has to do with harmony and with\nthe ear, is shown by the fact that precisely our good musicians\nthemselves write badly. The German does not read aloud, he does\nnot read for the ear, but only with his eyes; he has put his ears\naway in the drawer for the time. In antiquity when a man read—\nwhich was seldom enough—he read something to himself, and in a\nloud voice; they were surprised when any one read silently, and\nsought secretly the reason of it. In a loud voice: that is to\nsay, with all the swellings, inflections, and variations of key\nand changes of TEMPO, in which the ancient PUBLIC world took\ndelight. The laws of the written style were then the same as\nthose of the spoken style; and these laws depended partly on the\nsurprising development and refined requirements of the ear and\nlarynx; partly on the strength, endurance, and power of the\nancient lungs. In the ancient sense, a period is above all a\nphysiological whole, inasmuch as it is comprised in one breath.\nSuch periods as occur in Demosthenes and Cicero, swelling twice\nand sinking twice, and all in one breath, were pleasures to the\nmen of ANTIQUITY, who knew by their own schooling how to\nappreciate the virtue therein, the rareness and the difficulty in\nthe deliverance of such a period;—WE have really no right to the\nBIG period, we modern men, who are short of breath in every\nsense! Those ancients, indeed, were all of them dilettanti in\nspeaking, consequently connoisseurs, consequently critics—they\nthus brought their orators to the highest pitch; in the same\nmanner as in the last century, when all Italian ladies and\ngentlemen knew how to sing, the virtuosoship of song (and with it\nalso the art of melody) reached its elevation. In Germany,\nhowever (until quite recently when a kind of platform eloquence\nbegan shyly and awkwardly enough to flutter its young wings),\nthere was properly speaking only one kind of public and\nAPPROXIMATELY artistical discourse—that delivered from the\npulpit. The preacher was the only one in Germany who knew the\nweight of a syllable or a word, in what manner a sentence\nstrikes, springs, rushes, flows, and comes to a close; he alone\nhad a conscience in his ears, often enough a bad conscience: for\nreasons are not lacking why proficiency in oratory should be\nespecially seldom attained by a German, or almost always too\nlate. The masterpiece of German prose is therefore with good\nreason the masterpiece of its greatest preacher: the BIBLE has\nhitherto been the best German book. Compared with Luther’s Bible,\nalmost everything else is merely “literature\"—something which\nhas not grown in Germany, and therefore has not taken and does\nnot take root in German hearts, as the Bible has done.",

And similarly, among the\ngifted nations, there are those on whom the woman’s problem of\npregnancy has devolved, and the secret task of forming, maturing,\nand perfecting—the Greeks, for instance, were a nation of this\nkind, and so are the French; and others which have to fructify\nand become the cause of new modes of life—like the Jews, the\nRomans, and, in all modesty be it asked: like the Germans?—\nnations tortured and enraptured by unknown fevers and\nirresistibly forced out of themselves, amorous and longing for\nforeign races (for such as “let themselves be fructified”), and\nwithal imperious, like everything conscious of being full of\ngenerative force, and consequently empowered “by the grace of\nGod.” These two kinds of geniuses seek each other like man and\nwoman; but they also misunderstand each other—like man and\nwoman.",

For this, we artists among the\nspectators and philosophers, are—grateful to the Jews.",
        "251. It must be taken into the bargain, if various clouds and\ndisturbances—in short, slight attacks of stupidity—pass over\nthe spirit of a people that suffers and WANTS to suffer from\nnational nervous fever and political ambition: for instance,\namong present-day Germans there is alternately the anti-French\nfolly, the anti-Semitic folly, the anti-Polish folly, the\nChristian-romantic folly, the Wagnerian folly, the Teutonic\nfolly, the Prussian folly (just look at those poor historians,\nthe Sybels and Treitschkes, and their closely bandaged heads),\nand whatever else these little obscurations of the German spirit\nand conscience may be called. May it be forgiven me that I, too,\nwhen on a short daring sojourn on very infected ground, did not\nremain wholly exempt from the disease, but like every one else,\nbegan to entertain thoughts about matters which did not concern\nme—the first symptom of political infection. About the Jews, for\ninstance, listen to the following:—I have never yet met a German\nwho was favourably inclined to the Jews; and however decided the\nrepudiation of actual anti-Semitism may be on the part of all\nprudent and political men, this prudence and policy is not\nperhaps directed against the nature of the sentiment itself, but\nonly against its dangerous excess, and especially against the\ndistasteful and infamous expression of this excess of sentiment;\n—on this point we must not deceive ourselves. That Germany has\namply SUFFICIENT Jews, that the German stomach, the German blood,\nhas difficulty (and will long have difficulty) in disposing only\nof this quantity of “Jew\"—as the Italian, the Frenchman, and the\nEnglishman have done by means of a stronger digestion:—that is\nthe unmistakable declaration and language of a general instinct,\nto which one must listen and according to which one must act.\n\"Let no more Jews come in! And shut the doors, especially towards\nthe East (also towards Austria)!\"—thus commands the instinct of\na people whose nature is still feeble and uncertain, so that it\ncould be easily wiped out, easily extinguished, by a stronger\nrace. The Jews, however, are beyond all doubt the strongest,\ntoughest, and purest race at present living in Europe, they know\nhow to succeed even under the worst conditions (in fact better\nthan under favourable ones), by means of virtues of some sort,\nwhich one would like nowadays to label as vices—owing above all\nto a resolute faith which does not need to be ashamed before\n\"modern ideas”, they alter only, WHEN they do alter, in the same\nway that the Russian Empire makes its conquest—as an empire that\nhas plenty of time and is not of yesterday—namely, according to\nthe principle, “as slowly as possible”! A thinker who has the\nfuture of Europe at heart, will, in all his perspectives\nconcerning the future, calculate upon the Jews, as he will\ncalculate upon the Russians, as above all the surest and\nlikeliest factors in the great play and battle of forces. That\nwhich is at present called a “nation” in Europe, and is really\nrather a RES FACTA than NATA (indeed, sometimes confusingly\nsimilar to a RES FICTA ET PICTA), is in every case something\nevolving, young, easily displaced, and not yet a race, much less\nsuch a race AERE PERENNUS, as the Jews are such “nations” should\nmost carefully avoid all hotheaded rivalry and hostility! It is\ncertain that the Jews, if they desired—or if they were driven to\nit, as the anti-Semites seem to wish—COULD now have the\nascendancy, nay, literally the supremacy, over Europe, that they\nare NOT working and planning for that end is equally certain.\nMeanwhile, they rather wish and desire, even somewhat\nimportunely, to be insorbed and absorbed by Europe, they long to\nbe finally settled, authorized, and respected somewhere, and wish\nto put an end to the nomadic life, to the “wandering Jew”,—and\none should certainly take account of this impulse and tendency,\nand MAKE ADVANCES to it (it possibly betokens a mitigation of the\nJewish instincts) for which purpose it would perhaps be useful\nand fair to banish the anti-Semitic bawlers out of the country.\nOne should make advances with all prudence, and with selection,\npretty much as the English nobility do It stands to reason that\nthe more powerful and strongly marked types of new Germanism\ncould enter into relation with the Jews with the least\nhesitation, for instance, the nobleman officer from the Prussian\nborder it would be interesting in many ways to see whether the\ngenius for money and patience (and especially some intellect and\nintellectuality—sadly lacking in the place referred to) could\nnot in addition be annexed and trained to the hereditary art of\ncommanding and obeying—for both of which the country in question\nhas now a classic reputation But here it is expedient to break\noff my festal discourse and my sprightly Teutonomania for I have\nalready reached my SERIOUS TOPIC, the “European problem,” as I\nunderstand it, the rearing of a new ruling caste for Europe.",
        "252. They are not a philosophical race—the English: Bacon\nrepresents an ATTACK on the philosophical spirit generally,\nHobbes, Hume, and Locke, an abasement, and a depreciation of the\nidea of a “philosopher” for more than a century. It was AGAINST\nHume that Kant uprose and raised himself; it was Locke of whom\nSchelling RIGHTLY said, “JE MEPRISE LOCKE\"; in the struggle\nagainst the English mechanical stultification of the world, Hegel\nand Schopenhauer (along with Goethe) were of one accord; the two\nhostile brother-geniuses in philosophy, who pushed in different\ndirections towards the opposite poles of German thought, and\nthereby wronged each other as only brothers will do.—What is\nlacking in England, and has always been lacking, that half-actor\nand rhetorician knew well enough, the absurd muddle-head,\nCarlyle, who sought to conceal under passionate grimaces what he\nknew about himself: namely, what was LACKING in Carlyle—real\nPOWER of intellect, real DEPTH of intellectual perception, in\nshort, philosophy. It is characteristic of such an\nunphilosophical race to hold on firmly to Christianity—they NEED\nits discipline for “moralizing” and humanizing. The Englishman,\nmore gloomy, sensual, headstrong, and brutal than the German—is\nfor that very reason, as the baser of the two, also the most\npious: he has all the MORE NEED of Christianity. To finer\nnostrils, this English Christianity itself has still a\ncharacteristic English taint of spleen and alcoholic excess, for\nwhich, owing to good reasons, it is used as an antidote—the\nfiner poison to neutralize the coarser: a finer form of poisoning\nis in fact a step in advance with coarse-mannered people, a step\ntowards spiritualization. The English coarseness and rustic\ndemureness is still most satisfactorily disguised by Christian\npantomime, and by praying and psalm-singing (or, more correctly,\nit is thereby explained and differently expressed); and for the\nherd of drunkards and rakes who formerly learned moral grunting\nunder the influence of Methodism (and more recently as the\n\"Salvation Army”), a penitential fit may really be the relatively\nhighest manifestation of “humanity” to which they can be\nelevated: so much may reasonably be admitted. That, however,\nwhich offends even in the humanest Englishman is his lack of\nmusic, to speak figuratively (and also literally): he has neither\nrhythm nor dance in the movements of his soul and body; indeed,\nnot even the desire for rhythm and dance, for “music.” Listen to\nhim speaking; look at the most beautiful Englishwoman WALKING—in\nno country on earth are there more beautiful doves and swans;\nfinally, listen to them singing!

Indeed, who could doubt that it is a useful thing for SUCH\nminds to have the ascendancy for a time? It would be an error to\nconsider the highly developed and independently soaring minds as\nspecially qualified for determining and collecting many little\ncommon facts, and deducing conclusions from them; as exceptions,\nthey are rather from the first in no very favourable position\ntowards those who are “the rules.” After all, they have more to\ndo than merely to perceive:—in effect, they have to BE something\nnew, they have to SIGNIFY something new, they have to REPRESENT\nnew values! The gulf between knowledge and capacity is perhaps\ngreater, and also more mysterious, than one thinks: the capable\nman in the grand style, the creator, will possibly have to be an\nignorant person;—while on the other hand, for scientific\ndiscoveries like those of Darwin, a certain narrowness, aridity,\nand industrious carefulness (in short, something English) may not\nbe unfavourable for arriving at them.—Finally, let it not be\nforgotten that the English, with their profound mediocrity,\nbrought about once before a general depression of European\nintelligence.",

        "They have all something in common: they keep their ears closed in\npresence of the delirious folly and noisy spouting of the\ndemocratic BOURGEOIS. In fact, a besotted and brutalized France\nat present sprawls in the foreground—it recently celebrated a\nveritable orgy of bad taste, and at the same time of self-\nadmiration, at the funeral of Victor Hugo. There is also\nsomething else common to them: a predilection to resist\nintellectual Germanizing—and a still greater inability to do so!\nIn this France of intellect, which is also a France of pessimism,\nSchopenhauer has perhaps become more at home, and more indigenous\nthan he has ever been in Germany; not to speak of Heinrich Heine,\nwho has long ago been re-incarnated in the more refined and\nfastidious lyrists of Paris; or of Hegel, who at present, in the\nform of Taine—the FIRST of living historians—exercises an\nalmost tyrannical influence. As regards Richard Wagner, however,\nthe more French music learns to adapt itself to the actual needs\nof the AME MODERNE, the more will it “Wagnerite\"; one can safely\npredict that beforehand,—it is already taking place\nsufficiently! There are, however, three things which the French\ncan still boast of with pride as their heritage and possession,\nand as indelible tokens of their ancient intellectual superiority\nin Europe, in spite of all voluntary or involuntary Germanizing\nand vulgarizing of taste. FIRSTLY, the capacity for artistic\nemotion, for devotion to “form,” for which the expression, L’ART\nPOUR L’ART, along with numerous others, has been invented:—such\ncapacity has not been lacking in France for three centuries; and\nowing to its reverence for the “small number,” it has again and\nagain made a sort of chamber music of literature possible, which\nis sought for in vain elsewhere in Europe.—The SECOND thing\nwhereby the French can lay claim to a superiority over Europe is\ntheir ancient, many-sided, MORALISTIC culture, owing to which one\nfinds on an average, even in the petty ROMANCIERS of the\nnewspapers and chance BOULEVARDIERS DE PARIS, a psychological\nsensitiveness and curiosity, of which, for example, one has no\nconception (to say nothing of the thing itself!) in Germany. The\nGermans lack a couple of centuries of the moralistic work\nrequisite thereto, which, as we have said, France has not\ngrudged: those who call the Germans “naive” on that account give\nthem commendation for a defect. (As the opposite of the German\ninexperience and innocence IN VOLUPTATE PSYCHOLOGICA, which is\nnot too remotely associated with the tediousness of German\nintercourse,—and as the most successful expression of genuine\nFrench curiosity and inventive talent in this domain of delicate\nthrills, Henri Beyle may be noted; that remarkable anticipatory\nand forerunning man, who, with a Napoleonic TEMPO, traversed HIS\nEurope, in fact, several centuries of the European soul, as a\nsurveyor and discoverer thereof:—it has required two generations\nto OVERTAKE him one way or other, to divine long afterwards some\nof the riddles that perplexed and enraptured him—this strange\nEpicurean and man of interrogation, the last great psychologist\nof France).—There is yet a THIRD claim to superiority: in the\nFrench character there is a successful half-way synthesis of the\nNorth and South, which makes them comprehend many things, and\nenjoins upon them other things, which an Englishman can never\ncomprehend. Their temperament, turned alternately to and from the\nSouth, in which from time to time the Provencal and Ligurian\nblood froths over, preserves them from the dreadful, northern\ngrey-in-grey, from sunless conceptual-spectrism and from poverty\nof blood—our GERMAN infirmity of taste, for the excessive\nprevalence of which at the present moment, blood and iron, that\nis to say “high politics,” has with great resolution been\nprescribed (according to a dangerous healing art, which bids me\nwait and wait, but not yet hope).—There is also still in France\na pre-understanding and ready welcome for those rarer and rarely\ngratified men, who are too comprehensive to find satisfaction in\nany kind of fatherlandism, and know how to love the South when in\nthe North and the North when in the South—the born Midlanders,\nthe “good Europeans.” For them BIZET has made music, this latest\ngenius, who has seen a new beauty and seduction,—who has\ndiscovered a piece of the SOUTH IN MUSIC.",

Such a Southerner, a Southerner not by origin\nbut by BELIEF, if he should dream of the future of music, must\nalso dream of it being freed from the influence of the North; and\nmust have in his ears the prelude to a deeper, mightier, and\nperhaps more perverse and mysterious music, a super-German music,\nwhich does not fade, pale, and die away, as all German music\ndoes, at the sight of the blue, wanton sea and the Mediterranean\nclearness of sky—a super-European music, which holds its own\neven in presence of the brown sunsets of the desert, whose soul\nis akin to the palm-tree, and can be at home and can roam with\nbig, beautiful, lonely beasts of prey . . . I could imagine a music\nof which the rarest charm would be that it knew nothing more of\ngood and evil; only that here and there perhaps some sailor’s\nhome-sickness, some golden shadows and tender weaknesses might\nsweep lightly over it; an art which, from the far distance, would\nsee the colours of a sinking and almost incomprehensible MORAL\nworld fleeing towards it, and would be hospitable enough and\nprofound enough to receive such belated fugitives.",

Owing to the morbid estrangement which the nationality-craze\nhas induced and still induces among the nations of Europe, owing\nalso to the short-sighted and hasty-handed politicians, who with\nthe help of this craze, are at present in power, and do not\nsuspect to what extent the disintegrating policy they pursue must\nnecessarily be only an interlude policy—owing to all this and\nmuch else that is altogether unmentionable at present, the most\nunmistakable signs that EUROPE WISHES TO BE ONE, are now\noverlooked, or arbitrarily and falsely misinterpreted. With all\nthe more profound and large-minded men of this century, the real\ngeneral tendency of the mysterious labour of their souls was to\nprepare the way for that new SYNTHESIS, and tentatively to\nanticipate the European of the future; only in their simulations,\nor in their weaker moments, in old age perhaps, did they belong\nto the “fatherlands\"—they only rested from themselves when they\nbecame “patriots.” I think of such men as Napoleon, Goethe,\nBeethoven, Stendhal, Heinrich Heine, Schopenhauer: it must not be\ntaken amiss if I also count Richard Wagner among them, about whom\none must not let oneself be deceived by his own misunderstandings\n(geniuses like him have seldom the right to understand\nthemselves), still less, of course, by the unseemly noise with\nwhich he is now resisted and opposed in France: the fact remains,\nnevertheless, that Richard Wagner and the LATER FRENCH\nROMANTICISM of the forties, are most closely and intimately\nrelated to one another. They are akin, fundamentally akin, in all\nthe heights and depths of their requirements; it is Europe, the\nONE Europe, whose soul presses urgently and longingly, outwards\nand upwards, in their multifarious and boisterous art—whither?\ninto a new light? towards a new sun? But who would attempt to\nexpress accurately what all these masters of new modes of speech\ncould not express distinctly? It is certain that the same storm\nand stress tormented them, that they SOUGHT in the same manner,\nthese last great seekers! All of them steeped in literature to\ntheir eyes and ears—the first artists of universal literary\nculture—for the most part even themselves writers, poets,\nintermediaries and blenders of the arts and the senses (Wagner,\nas musician is reckoned among painters, as poet among musicians,\nas artist generally among actors); all of them fanatics for\nEXPRESSION “at any cost\"—I specially mention Delacroix, the\nnearest related to Wagner; all of them great discoverers in the\nrealm of the sublime, also of the loathsome and dreadful, still\ngreater discoverers in effect, in display, in the art of the\nshow-shop; all of them talented far beyond their genius, out and\nout VIRTUOSI, with mysterious accesses to all that seduces,\nallures, constrains, and upsets; born enemies of logic and of the\nstraight line, hankering after the strange, the exotic, the\nmonstrous, the crooked, and the self-contradictory; as men,\nTantaluses of the will, plebeian parvenus, who knew themselves to\nbe incapable of a noble TEMPO or of a LENTO in life and action—\nthink of Balzac, for instance,—unrestrained workers, almost\ndestroying themselves by work; antinomians and rebels in manners,\nambitious and insatiable, without equilibrium and enjoyment; all\nof them finally shattering and sinking down at the Christian\ncross (and with right and reason, for who of them would have been\nsufficiently profound and sufficiently original for an ANTI-\nCHRISTIAN philosophy?);—on the whole, a boldly daring,\nsplendidly overbearing, high-flying, and aloft-up-dragging class\nof higher men, who had first to teach their century-and it is the\ncentury of the MASSES—the conception “higher man.” . . . Let the\nGerman friends of Richard Wagner advise together as to whether\nthere is anything purely German in the Wagnerian art, or whether\nits distinction does not consist precisely in coming from SUPER-\nGERMAN sources and impulses: in which connection it may not be\nunderrated how indispensable Paris was to the development of his\ntype, which the strength of his instincts made him long to visit\nat the most decisive time—and how the whole style of his\nproceedings, of his self-apostolate, could only perfect itself in\nsight of the French socialistic original. On a more subtle\ncomparison it will perhaps be found, to the honour of Richard\nWagner’s German nature, that he has acted in everything with more\nstrength, daring, severity, and elevation than a nineteenth-\ncentury Frenchman could have done—owing to the circumstance that\nwe Germans are as yet nearer to barbarism than the French;—\nperhaps even the most remarkable creation of Richard Wagner is\nnot only at present, but for ever inaccessible, incomprehensible,\nand inimitable to the whole latter-day Latin race: the figure of\nSiegfried, that VERY FREE man, who is probably far too free, too\nhard, too cheerful, too healthy, too ANTI-CATHOLIC for the taste\nof old and mellow civilized nations. He may even have been a sin\nagainst Romanticism, this anti-Latin Siegfried: well, Wagner\natoned amply for this sin in his old sad days, when—anticipating\na taste which has meanwhile passed into politics—he began, with\nthe religious vehemence peculiar to him, to preach, at least, THE\nWAY TO ROME, if not to walk therein.—That these last words may\nnot be misunderstood, I will call to my aid a few powerful\nrhymes, which will even betray to less delicate ears what I mean\n—what I mean COUNTER TO the “last Wagner” and his Parsifal music:—",

This sly nun-ogling, Ave-hour-bell ringing, This wholly\nfalse enraptured heaven-o’erspringing?—Is this our mode?—Think\nwell!—ye still wait for admission—For what ye hear is ROME—\nROME’S FAITH BY INTUITION!",
        "\n257. EVERY elevation of the type “man,” has hitherto been the\nwork of an aristocratic society and so it will always be—a\nsociety believing in a long scale of gradations of rank and\ndifferences of worth among human beings, and requiring slavery in\nsome form or other. Without the PATHOS OF DISTANCE, such as grows\nout of the incarnated difference of classes, out of the constant\nout-looking and down-looking of the ruling caste on subordinates\nand instruments, and out of their equally constant practice of\nobeying and commanding, of keeping down and keeping at a\ndistance—that other more mysterious pathos could never have\narisen, the longing for an ever new widening of distance within\nthe soul itself, the formation of ever higher, rarer, further,\nmore extended, more comprehensive states, in short, just the\nelevation of the type “man,” the continued “self-surmounting of\nman,” to use a moral formula in a supermoral sense. To be sure,\none must not resign oneself to any humanitarian illusions about\nthe history of the origin of an aristocratic society (that is to\nsay, of the preliminary condition for the elevation of the type\n\"man”): the truth is hard. Let us acknowledge unprejudicedly how\nevery higher civilization hitherto has ORIGINATED! Men with a\nstill natural nature, barbarians in every terrible sense of the\nword, men of prey, still in possession of unbroken strength of\nwill and desire for power, threw themselves upon weaker, more\nmoral, more peaceful races (perhaps trading or cattle-rearing\ncommunities), or upon old mellow civilizations in which the final\nvital force was flickering out in brilliant fireworks of wit and\ndepravity. At the commencement, the noble caste was always the\nbarbarian caste: their superiority did not consist first of all\nin their physical, but in their psychical power—they were more\nCOMPLETE men (which at every point also implies the same as “more\ncomplete beasts”).",
        "258. Corruption—as the indication that anarchy threatens to\nbreak out among the instincts, and that the foundation of the\nemotions, called “life,” is convulsed—is something radically\ndifferent according to the organization in which it manifests\nitself. When, for instance, an aristocracy like that of France at\nthe beginning of the Revolution, flung away its privileges with\nsublime disgust and sacrificed itself to an excess of its moral\nsentiments, it was corruption:—it was really only the closing\nact of the corruption which had existed for centuries, by virtue\nof which that aristocracy had abdicated step by step its lordly\nprerogatives and lowered itself to a FUNCTION of royalty (in the\nend even to its decoration and parade-dress). The essential\nthing, however, in a good and healthy aristocracy is that it\nshould not regard itself as a function either of the kingship or\nthe commonwealth, but as the SIGNIFICANCE and highest\njustification thereof—that it should therefore accept with a\ngood conscience the sacrifice of a legion of individuals, who,\nFOR ITS SAKE, must be suppressed and reduced to imperfect men, to\nslaves and instruments. Its fundamental belief must be precisely\nthat society is NOT allowed to exist for its own sake, but only\nas a foundation and scaffolding, by means of which a select class\nof beings may be able to elevate themselves to their higher\nduties, and in general to a higher EXISTENCE: like those sun-\nseeking climbing plants in Java—they are called Sipo Matador,—\nwhich encircle an oak so long and so often with their arms, until\nat last, high above it, but supported by it, they can unfold\ntheir tops in the open light, and exhibit their happiness.",
        "259. To refrain mutually from injury, from violence, from\nexploitation, and put one’s will on a par with that of others:\nthis may result in a certain rough sense in good conduct among\nindividuals when the necessary conditions are given (namely, the\nactual similarity of the individuals in amount of force and\ndegree of worth, and their co-relation within one organization).\nAs soon, however, as one wished to take this principle more\ngenerally, and if possible even as the FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF\nSOCIETY, it would immediately disclose what it really is—namely,\na Will to the DENIAL of life, a principle of dissolution and\ndecay. Here one must think profoundly to the very basis and\nresist all sentimental weakness: life itself is ESSENTIALLY\nappropriation, injury, conquest of the strange and weak,\nsuppression, severity, obtrusion of peculiar forms,\nincorporation, and at the least, putting it mildest,\nexploitation;—but why should one for ever use precisely these\nwords on which for ages a disparaging purpose has been stamped?\nEven the organization within which, as was previously supposed,\nthe individuals treat each other as equal—it takes place in\nevery healthy aristocracy—must itself, if it be a living and not\na dying organization, do all that towards other bodies, which the\nindividuals within it refrain from doing to each other it will\nhave to be the incarnated Will to Power, it will endeavour to\ngrow, to gain ground, attract to itself and acquire ascendancy—\nnot owing to any morality or immorality, but because it LIVES,\nand because life IS precisely Will to Power. On no point,\nhowever, is the ordinary consciousness of Europeans more\nunwilling to be corrected than on this matter, people now rave\neverywhere, even under the guise of science, about coming\nconditions of society in which “the exploiting character” is to\nbe absent—that sounds to my ears as if they promised to invent a\nmode of life which should refrain from all organic functions.\n\"Exploitation” does not belong to a depraved, or imperfect and\nprimitive society it belongs to the nature of the living being as\na primary organic function, it is a consequence of the intrinsic\nWill to Power, which is precisely the Will to Life—Granting that\nas a theory this is a novelty—as a reality it is the FUNDAMENTAL\nFACT of all history let us be so far honest towards ourselves!",
        "260. In a tour through the many finer and coarser moralities\nwhich have hitherto prevailed or still prevail on the earth, I\nfound certain traits recurring regularly together, and connected\nwith one another, until finally two primary types revealed\nthemselves to me, and a radical distinction was brought to light.\nThere is MASTER-MORALITY and SLAVE-MORALITY,—I would at once\nadd, however, that in all higher and mixed civilizations, there\nare also attempts at the reconciliation of the two moralities,\nbut one finds still oftener the confusion and mutual\nmisunderstanding of them, indeed sometimes their close\njuxtaposition—even in the same man, within one soul. The\ndistinctions of moral values have either originated in a ruling\ncaste, pleasantly conscious of being different from the ruled—or\namong the ruled class, the slaves and dependents of all sorts. In\nthe first case, when it is the rulers who determine the\nconception “good,” it is the exalted, proud disposition which is\nregarded as the distinguishing feature, and that which determines\nthe order of rank. The noble type of man separates from himself\nthe beings in whom the opposite of this exalted, proud\ndisposition displays itself he despises them. Let it at once be\nnoted that in this first kind of morality the antithesis “good\"\nand “bad” means practically the same as “noble” and\n\"despicable”,—the antithesis “good” and “EVIL” is of a different\norigin. The cowardly, the timid, the insignificant, and those\nthinking merely of narrow utility are despised; moreover, also,\nthe distrustful, with their constrained glances, the self-\nabasing, the dog-like kind of men who let themselves be abused,\nthe mendicant flatterers, and above all the liars:—it is a\nfundamental belief of all aristocrats that the common people are\nuntruthful. “We truthful ones\"—the nobility in ancient Greece\ncalled themselves. It is obvious that everywhere the designations\nof moral value were at first applied to MEN; and were only\nderivatively and at a later period applied to ACTIONS; it is a\ngross mistake, therefore, when historians of morals start with\nquestions like, “Why have sympathetic actions been praised?” The\nnoble type of man regards HIMSELF as a determiner of values; he\ndoes not require to be approved of; he passes the judgment: “What\nis injurious to me is injurious in itself;” he knows that it is he\nhimself only who confers honour on things; he is a CREATOR OF\nVALUES. He honours whatever he recognizes in himself: such\nmorality equals self-glorification. In the foreground there is\nthe feeling of plenitude, of power, which seeks to overflow, the\nhappiness of high tension, the consciousness of a wealth which\nwould fain give and bestow:—the noble man also helps the\nunfortunate, but not—or scarcely—out of pity, but rather from\nan impulse generated by the super-abundance of power. The noble\nman honours in himself the powerful one, him also who has power\nover himself, who knows how to speak and how to keep silence, who\ntakes pleasure in subjecting himself to severity and hardness,\nand has reverence for all that is severe and hard. “Wotan placed\na hard heart in my breast,” says an old Scandinavian Saga: it is\nthus rightly expressed from the soul of a proud Viking. Such a\ntype of man is even proud of not being made for sympathy; the\nhero of the Saga therefore adds warningly: “He who has not a hard\nheart when young, will never have one.” The noble and brave who\nthink thus are the furthest removed from the morality which sees\nprecisely in sympathy, or in acting for the good of others, or in\nDESINTERESSEMENT, the characteristic of the moral; faith in\noneself, pride in oneself, a radical enmity and irony towards\n\"selflessness,” belong as definitely to noble morality, as do a\ncareless scorn and precaution in presence of sympathy and the\n\"warm heart.\"—It is the powerful who KNOW how to honour, it is\ntheir art, their domain for invention. The profound reverence for\nage and for tradition—all law rests on this double reverence,—\nthe belief and prejudice in favour of ancestors and unfavourable\nto newcomers, is typical in the morality of the powerful; and if,\nreversely, men of “modern ideas” believe almost instinctively in\n\"progress” and the “future,” and are more and more lacking in\nrespect for old age, the ignoble origin of these “ideas” has\ncomplacently betrayed itself thereby. A morality of the ruling\nclass, however, is more especially foreign and irritating to\npresent-day taste in the sternness of its principle that one has\nduties only to one’s equals; that one may act towards beings of a\nlower rank, towards all that is foreign, just as seems good to\none, or “as the heart desires,” and in any case “beyond good and\nevil”: it is here that sympathy and similar sentiments can have a\nplace. The ability and obligation to exercise prolonged gratitude\nand prolonged revenge—both only within the circle of equals,—\nartfulness in retaliation, RAFFINEMENT of the idea in friendship,\na certain necessity to have enemies (as outlets for the emotions\nof envy, quarrelsomeness, arrogance—in fact, in order to be a\ngood FRIEND): all these are typical characteristics of the noble\nmorality, which, as has been pointed out, is not the morality of\n\"modern ideas,” and is therefore at present difficult to realize,\nand also to unearth and disclose.—It is otherwise with the\nsecond type of morality, SLAVE-MORALITY. Supposing that the\nabused, the oppressed, the suffering, the unemancipated, the\nweary, and those uncertain of themselves should moralize, what\nwill be the common element in their moral estimates? Probably a\npessimistic suspicion with regard to the entire situation of man\nwill find expression, perhaps a condemnation of man, together\nwith his situation. The slave has an unfavourable eye for the\nvirtues of the powerful; he has a skepticism and distrust, a\nREFINEMENT of distrust of everything “good” that is there\nhonoured—he would fain persuade himself that the very happiness\nthere is not genuine. On the other hand, THOSE qualities which\nserve to alleviate the existence of sufferers are brought into\nprominence and flooded with light; it is here that sympathy, the\nkind, helping hand, the warm heart, patience, diligence,\nhumility, and friendliness attain to honour; for here these are\nthe most useful qualities, and almost the only means of\nsupporting the burden of existence. Slave-morality is essentially\nthe morality of utility. Here is the seat of the origin of the\nfamous antithesis “good” and “evil”:—power and dangerousness are\nassumed to reside in the evil, a certain dreadfulness, subtlety,\nand strength, which do not admit of being despised. According to\nslave-morality, therefore, the “evil” man arouses fear; according\nto master-morality, it is precisely the “good” man who arouses\nfear and seeks to arouse it, while the bad man is regarded as the\ndespicable being. The contrast attains its maximum when, in\naccordance with the logical consequences of slave-morality, a\nshade of depreciation—it may be slight and well-intentioned—at\nlast attaches itself to the “good” man of this morality; because,\naccording to the servile mode of thought, the good man must in\nany case be the SAFE man: he is good-natured, easily deceived,\nperhaps a little stupid, un bonhomme. Everywhere that slave-\nmorality gains the ascendancy, language shows a tendency to\napproximate the significations of the words “good” and “stupid.\"-\n-A last fundamental difference: the desire for FREEDOM, the\ninstinct for happiness and the refinements of the feeling of\nliberty belong as necessarily to slave-morals and morality, as\nartifice and enthusiasm in reverence and devotion are the regular\nsymptoms of an aristocratic mode of thinking and estimating.—\nHence we can understand without further detail why love AS A\nPASSION—it is our European specialty—must absolutely be of\nnoble origin; as is well known, its invention is due to the\nProvencal poet-cavaliers, those brilliant, ingenious men of the\n\"gai saber,” to whom Europe owes so much, and almost owes itself.",
        "261. Vanity is one of the things which are perhaps most difficult\nfor a noble man to understand: he will be tempted to deny it,\nwhere another kind of man thinks he sees it self-evidently. The\nproblem for him is to represent to his mind beings who seek to\narouse a good opinion of themselves which they themselves do not\npossess—and consequently also do not “deserve,\"—and who yet\nBELIEVE in this good opinion afterwards. This seems to him on the\none hand such bad taste and so self-disrespectful, and on the\nother hand so grotesquely unreasonable, that he would like to\nconsider vanity an exception, and is doubtful about it in most\ncases when it is spoken of. He will say, for instance: “I may be\nmistaken about my value, and on the other hand may nevertheless\ndemand that my value should be acknowledged by others precisely\nas I rate it:—that, however, is not vanity (but self-conceit,\nor, in most cases, that which is called ’humility,’ and also\n’modesty’).” Or he will even say: “For many reasons I can delight\nin the good opinion of others, perhaps because I love and honour\nthem, and rejoice in all their joys, perhaps also because their\ngood opinion endorses and strengthens my belief in my own good\nopinion, perhaps because the good opinion of others, even in\ncases where I do not share it, is useful to me, or gives promise\nof usefulness:—all this, however, is not vanity.” The man of\nnoble character must first bring it home forcibly to his mind,\nespecially with the aid of history, that, from time immemorial,\nin all social strata in any way dependent, the ordinary man WAS\nonly that which he PASSED FOR:—not being at all accustomed to\nfix values, he did not assign even to himself any other value\nthan that which his master assigned to him (it is the peculiar\nRIGHT OF MASTERS to create values). It may be looked upon as the\nresult of an extraordinary atavism, that the ordinary man, even\nat present, is still always WAITING for an opinion about himself,\nand then instinctively submitting himself to it; yet by no means\nonly to a “good” opinion, but also to a bad and unjust one\n(think, for instance, of the greater part of the self-\nappreciations and self-depreciations which believing women learn\nfrom their confessors, and which in general the believing\nChristian learns from his Church). In fact, conformably to the\nslow rise of the democratic social order (and its cause, the\nblending of the blood of masters and slaves), the originally\nnoble and rare impulse of the masters to assign a value to\nthemselves and to “think well” of themselves, will now be more\nand more encouraged and extended; but it has at all times an\nolder, ampler, and more radically ingrained propensity opposed to\nit—and in the phenomenon of “vanity” this older propensity\novermasters the younger. The vain person rejoices over EVERY good\nopinion which he hears about himself (quite apart from the point\nof view of its usefulness, and equally regardless of its truth or\nfalsehood), just as he suffers from every bad opinion: for he\nsubjects himself to both, he feels himself subjected to both, by\nthat oldest instinct of subjection which breaks forth in him.—It\nis “the slave” in the vain man’s blood, the remains of the\nslave’s craftiness—and how much of the “slave” is still left in\nwoman, for instance!—which seeks to SEDUCE to good opinions of\nitself; it is the slave, too, who immediately afterwards falls\nprostrate himself before these opinions, as though he had not\ncalled them forth.—And to repeat it again: vanity is an atavism.",
        "262. A SPECIES originates, and a type becomes established and\nstrong in the long struggle with essentially constant\nUNFAVOURABLE conditions. On the other hand, it is known by the\nexperience of breeders that species which receive super-abundant\nnourishment, and in general a surplus of protection and care,\nimmediately tend in the most marked way to develop variations,\nand are fertile in prodigies and monstrosities (also in monstrous\nvices). Now look at an aristocratic commonwealth, say an ancient\nGreek polis, or Venice, as a voluntary or involuntary contrivance\nfor the purpose of REARING human beings; there are there men\nbeside one another, thrown upon their own resources, who want to\nmake their species prevail, chiefly because they MUST prevail, or\nelse run the terrible danger of being exterminated. The favour,\nthe super-abundance, the protection are there lacking under which\nvariations are fostered; the species needs itself as species, as\nsomething which, precisely by virtue of its hardness, its\nuniformity, and simplicity of structure, can in general prevail\nand make itself permanent in constant struggle with its\nneighbours, or with rebellious or rebellion-threatening vassals.\nThe most varied experience teaches it what are the qualities to\nwhich it principally owes the fact that it still exists, in spite\nof all Gods and men, and has hitherto been victorious: these\nqualities it calls virtues, and these virtues alone it develops\nto maturity. It does so with severity, indeed it desires\nseverity; every aristocratic morality is intolerant in the\neducation of youth, in the control of women, in the marriage\ncustoms, in the relations of old and young, in the penal laws\n(which have an eye only for the degenerating): it counts\nintolerance itself among the virtues, under the name of\n\"justice.” A type with few, but very marked features, a species\nof severe, warlike, wisely silent, reserved, and reticent men\n(and as such, with the most delicate sensibility for the charm\nand nuances of society) is thus established, unaffected by the\nvicissitudes of generations; the constant struggle with uniform\nUNFAVOURABLE conditions is, as already remarked, the cause of a\ntype becoming stable and hard. Finally, however, a happy state of\nthings results, the enormous tension is relaxed; there are\nperhaps no more enemies among the neighbouring peoples, and the\nmeans of life, even of the enjoyment of life, are present in\nsuperabundance. With one stroke the bond and constraint of the\nold discipline severs: it is no longer regarded as necessary, as\na condition of existence—if it would continue, it can only do so\nas a form of LUXURY, as an archaizing TASTE. Variations, whether\nthey be deviations (into the higher, finer, and rarer), or\ndeteriorations and monstrosities, appear suddenly on the scene in\nthe greatest exuberance and splendour; the individual dares to be\nindividual and detach himself. At this turning-point of history\nthere manifest themselves, side by side, and often mixed and\nentangled together, a magnificent, manifold, virgin-forest-like\nup-growth and up-striving, a kind of TROPICAL TEMPO in the\nrivalry of growth, and an extraordinary decay and self-\ndestruction, owing to the savagely opposing and seemingly\nexploding egoisms, which strive with one another “for sun and\nlight,” and can no longer assign any limit, restraint, or\nforbearance for themselves by means of the hitherto existing\nmorality. It was this morality itself which piled up the strength\nso enormously, which bent the bow in so threatening a manner:—it\nis now “out of date,” it is getting “out of date.” The dangerous\nand disquieting point has been reached when the greater, more\nmanifold, more comprehensive life IS LIVED BEYOND the old\nmorality; the “individual” stands out, and is obliged to have\nrecourse to his own law-giving, his own arts and artifices for\nself-preservation, self-elevation, and self-deliverance. Nothing\nbut new “Whys,” nothing but new “Hows,” no common formulas any\nlonger, misunderstanding and disregard in league with each other,\ndecay, deterioration, and the loftiest desires frightfully\nentangled, the genius of the race overflowing from all the\ncornucopias of good and bad, a portentous simultaneousness of\nSpring and Autumn, full of new charms and mysteries peculiar to\nthe fresh, still inexhausted, still unwearied corruption. Danger\nis again present, the mother of morality, great danger; this time\nshifted into the individual, into the neighbour and friend, into\nthe street, into their own child, into their own heart, into all\nthe most personal and secret recesses of their desires and\nvolitions. What will the moral philosophers who appear at this\ntime have to preach? They discover, these sharp onlookers and\nloafers, that the end is quickly approaching, that everything\naround them decays and produces decay, that nothing will endure\nuntil the day after tomorrow, except one species of man, the\nincurably MEDIOCRE. The mediocre alone have a prospect of\ncontinuing and propagating themselves—they will be the men of\nthe future, the sole survivors; “be like them! become mediocre!\"\nis now the only morality which has still a significance, which\nstill obtains a hearing.—But it is difficult to preach this\nmorality of mediocrity! it can never avow what it is and what it\ndesires! it has to talk of moderation and dignity and duty and\nbrotherly love—it will have difficulty IN CONCEALING ITS IRONY!",
        "263. There is an INSTINCT FOR RANK, which more than anything else\nis already the sign of a HIGH rank; there is a DELIGHT in the\nNUANCES of reverence which leads one to infer noble origin and\nhabits. The refinement, goodness, and loftiness of a soul are put\nto a perilous test when something passes by that is of the\nhighest rank, but is not yet protected by the awe of authority\nfrom obtrusive touches and incivilities: something that goes its\nway like a living touchstone, undistinguished, undiscovered, and\ntentative, perhaps voluntarily veiled and disguised. He whose\ntask and practice it is to investigate souls, will avail himself\nof many varieties of this very art to determine the ultimate\nvalue of a soul, the unalterable, innate order of rank to which\nit belongs: he will test it by its INSTINCT FOR REVERENCE.\nDIFFERENCE ENGENDRE HAINE: the vulgarity of many a nature spurts\nup suddenly like dirty water, when any holy vessel, any jewel\nfrom closed shrines, any book bearing the marks of great destiny,\nis brought before it; while on the other hand, there is an\ninvoluntary silence, a hesitation of the eye, a cessation of all\ngestures, by which it is indicated that a soul FEELS the nearness\nof what is worthiest of respect. The way in which, on the whole,\nthe reverence for the BIBLE has hitherto been maintained in\nEurope, is perhaps the best example of discipline and refinement\nof manners which Europe owes to Christianity: books of such\nprofoundness and supreme significance require for their\nprotection an external tyranny of authority, in order to acquire\nthe PERIOD of thousands of years which is necessary to exhaust\nand unriddle them. Much has been achieved when the sentiment has\nbeen at last instilled into the masses (the shallow-pates and the\nboobies of every kind) that they are not allowed to touch\neverything, that there are holy experiences before which they\nmust take off their shoes and keep away the unclean hand—it is\nalmost their highest advance towards humanity. On the contrary,\nin the so-called cultured classes, the believers in “modern\nideas,” nothing is perhaps so repulsive as their lack of shame,\nthe easy insolence of eye and hand with which they touch, taste,\nand finger everything; and it is possible that even yet there is\nmore RELATIVE nobility of taste, and more tact for reverence\namong the people, among the lower classes of the people,\nespecially among peasants, than among the newspaper-reading\nDEMIMONDE of intellect, the cultured class.",
        "264. It cannot be effaced from a man’s soul what his ancestors\nhave preferably and most constantly done: whether they were\nperhaps diligent economizers attached to a desk and a cash-box,\nmodest and citizen-like in their desires, modest also in their\nvirtues; or whether they were accustomed to commanding from\nmorning till night, fond of rude pleasures and probably of still\nruder duties and responsibilities; or whether, finally, at one\ntime or another, they have sacrificed old privileges of birth and\npossession, in order to live wholly for their faith—for their\n\"God,\"—as men of an inexorable and sensitive conscience, which\nblushes at every compromise. It is quite impossible for a man NOT\nto have the qualities and predilections of his parents and\nancestors in his constitution, whatever appearances may suggest\nto the contrary. This is the problem of race. Granted that one\nknows something of the parents, it is admissible to draw a\nconclusion about the child: any kind of offensive incontinence,\nany kind of sordid envy, or of clumsy self-vaunting—the three\nthings which together have constituted the genuine plebeian type\nin all times—such must pass over to the child, as surely as bad\nblood; and with the help of the best education and culture one\nwill only succeed in DECEIVING with regard to such heredity.—And\nwhat else does education and culture try to do nowadays! In our\nvery democratic, or rather, very plebeian age, “education” and\n\"culture” MUST be essentially the art of deceiving—deceiving\nwith regard to origin, with regard to the inherited plebeianism\nin body and soul. An educator who nowadays preached truthfulness\nabove everything else, and called out constantly to his pupils:\n\"Be true! Be natural! Show yourselves as you are!\"—even such a\nvirtuous and sincere ass would learn in a short time to have\nrecourse to the FURCA of Horace, NATURAM EXPELLERE: with what\nresults? “Plebeianism” USQUE RECURRET.

        "265. At the risk of displeasing innocent ears, I submit that\negoism belongs to the essence of a noble soul, I mean the\nunalterable belief that to a being such as “we,” other beings\nmust naturally be in subjection, and have to sacrifice\nthemselves. The noble soul accepts the fact of his egoism without\nquestion, and also without consciousness of harshness,\nconstraint, or arbitrariness therein, but rather as something\nthat may have its basis in the primary law of things:—if he\nsought a designation for it he would say: “It is justice itself.\"\nHe acknowledges under certain circumstances, which made him\nhesitate at first, that there are other equally privileged ones;\nas soon as he has settled this question of rank, he moves among\nthose equals and equally privileged ones with the same assurance,\nas regards modesty and delicate respect, which he enjoys in\nintercourse with himself—in accordance with an innate heavenly\nmechanism which all the stars understand. It is an ADDITIONAL\ninstance of his egoism, this artfulness and self-limitation in\nintercourse with his equals—every star is a similar egoist; he\nhonours HIMSELF in them, and in the rights which he concedes to\nthem, he has no doubt that the exchange of honours and rights, as\nthe ESSENCE of all intercourse, belongs also to the natural\ncondition of things. The noble soul gives as he takes, prompted\nby the passionate and sensitive instinct of requital, which is at\nthe root of his nature. The notion of “favour” has, INTER PARES,\nneither significance nor good repute; there may be a sublime way\nof letting gifts as it were light upon one from above, and of\ndrinking them thirstily like dew-drops; but for those arts and\ndisplays the noble soul has no aptitude. His egoism hinders him\nhere: in general, he looks “aloft” unwillingly—he looks either\nFORWARD, horizontally and deliberately, or downwards—HE KNOWS\nTHAT HE IS ON A HEIGHT.",

        "268. What, after all, is ignobleness?—Words are vocal symbols\nfor ideas; ideas, however, are more or less definite mental\nsymbols for frequently returning and concurring sensations, for\ngroups of sensations. It is not sufficient to use the same words\nin order to understand one another: we must also employ the same\nwords for the same kind of internal experiences, we must in the\nend have experiences IN COMMON. On this account the people of one\nnation understand one another better than those belonging to\ndifferent nations, even when they use the same language; or\nrather, when people have lived long together under similar\nconditions (of climate, soil, danger, requirement, toil) there\nORIGINATES therefrom an entity that “understands itself\"—namely,\na nation. In all souls a like number of frequently recurring\nexperiences have gained the upper hand over those occurring more\nrarely: about these matters people understand one another rapidly\nand always more rapidly—the history of language is the history\nof a process of abbreviation; on the basis of this quick\ncomprehension people always unite closer and closer. The greater\nthe danger, the greater is the need of agreeing quickly and\nreadily about what is necessary; not to misunderstand one another\nin danger—that is what cannot at all be dispensed with in\nintercourse. Also in all loves and friendships one has the\nexperience that nothing of the kind continues when the discovery\nhas been made that in using the same words, one of the two\nparties has feelings, thoughts, intuitions, wishes, or fears\ndifferent from those of the other. (The fear of the “eternal\nmisunderstanding”: that is the good genius which so often keeps\npersons of different sexes from too hasty attachments, to which\nsense and heart prompt them—and NOT some Schopenhauerian “genius\nof the species”!) Whichever groups of sensations within a soul\nawaken most readily, begin to speak, and give the word of\ncommand—these decide as to the general order of rank of its\nvalues, and determine ultimately its list of desirable things. A\nman’s estimates of value betray something of the STRUCTURE of his\nsoul, and wherein it sees its conditions of life, its intrinsic\nneeds. Supposing now that necessity has from all time drawn\ntogether only such men as could express similar requirements and\nsimilar experiences by similar symbols, it results on the whole\nthat the easy COMMUNICABILITY of need, which implies ultimately\nthe undergoing only of average and COMMON experiences, must have\nbeen the most potent of all the forces which have hitherto\noperated upon mankind. The more similar, the more ordinary\npeople, have always had and are still having the advantage; the\nmore select, more refined, more unique, and difficultly\ncomprehensible, are liable to stand alone; they succumb to\naccidents in their isolation, and seldom propagate themselves.\nOne must appeal to immense opposing forces, in order to thwart\nthis natural, all-too-natural PROGRESSUS IN SIMILE, the evolution\nof man to the similar, the ordinary, the average, the gregarious\n—to the IGNOBLE!—",
        "269. The more a psychologist—a born, an unavoidable psychologist\nand soul-diviner—turns his attention to the more select cases\nand individuals, the greater is his danger of being suffocated by\nsympathy: he NEEDS sternness and cheerfulness more than any other\nman. For the corruption, the ruination of higher men, of the more\nunusually constituted souls, is in fact, the rule: it is dreadful\nto have such a rule always before one’s eyes. The manifold\ntorment of the psychologist who has discovered this ruination,\nwho discovers once, and then discovers ALMOST repeatedly\nthroughout all history, this universal inner “desperateness” of\nhigher men, this eternal “too late!” in every sense—may perhaps\none day be the cause of his turning with bitterness against his\nown lot, and of his making an attempt at self-destruction—of his\n\"going to ruin” himself. One may perceive in almost every\npsychologist a tell-tale inclination for delightful intercourse\nwith commonplace and well-ordered men; the fact is thereby\ndisclosed that he always requires healing, that he needs a sort\nof flight and forgetfulness, away from what his insight and\nincisiveness—from what his “business\"—has laid upon his\nconscience. The fear of his memory is peculiar to him. He is\neasily silenced by the judgment of others; he hears with unmoved\ncountenance how people honour, admire, love, and glorify, where\nhe has PERCEIVED—or he even conceals his silence by expressly\nassenting to some plausible opinion. Perhaps the paradox of his\nsituation becomes so dreadful that, precisely where he has learnt\nGREAT SYMPATHY, together with great CONTEMPT, the multitude, the\neducated, and the visionaries, have on their part learnt great\nreverence—reverence for “great men” and marvelous animals, for\nthe sake of whom one blesses and honours the fatherland, the\nearth, the dignity of mankind, and one’s own self, to whom one\npoints the young, and in view of whom one educates them. And who\nknows but in all great instances hitherto just the same happened:\nthat the multitude worshipped a God, and that the “God” was only\na poor sacrificial animal! SUCCESS has always been the greatest\nliar—and the “work” itself is a success; the great statesman,\nthe conqueror, the discoverer, are disguised in their creations\nuntil they are unrecognizable; the “work” of the artist, of the\nphilosopher, only invents him who has created it, is REPUTED to\nhave created it; the “great men,” as they are reverenced, are\npoor little fictions composed afterwards; in the world of\nhistorical values spurious coinage PREVAILS. Those great poets,\nfor example, such as Byron, Musset, Poe, Leopardi, Kleist, Gogol\n(I do not venture to mention much greater names, but I have them\nin my mind), as they now appear, and were perhaps obliged to be:\nmen of the moment, enthusiastic, sensuous, and childish, light-\nminded and impulsive in their trust and distrust; with souls in\nwhich usually some flaw has to be concealed; often taking revenge\nwith their works for an internal defilement, often seeking\nforgetfulness in their soaring from a too true memory, often lost\nin the mud and almost in love with it, until they become like the\nWill-o’-the-Wisps around the swamps, and PRETEND TO BE stars—the\npeople then call them idealists,—often struggling with\nprotracted disgust, with an ever-reappearing phantom of\ndisbelief, which makes them cold, and obliges them to languish\nfor GLORIA and devour “faith as it is” out of the hands of\nintoxicated adulators:—what a TORMENT these great artists are\nand the so-called higher men in general, to him who has once\nfound them out! It is thus conceivable that it is just from\nwoman—who is clairvoyant in the world of suffering, and also\nunfortunately eager to help and save to an extent far beyond her\npowers—that THEY have learnt so readily those outbreaks of\nboundless devoted SYMPATHY, which the multitude, above all the\nreverent multitude, do not understand, and overwhelm with prying\nand self-gratifying interpretations. This sympathizing invariably\ndeceives itself as to its power; woman would like to believe that\nlove can do EVERYTHING—it is the SUPERSTITION peculiar to her.\nAlas, he who knows the heart finds out how poor, helpless,\npretentious, and blundering even the best and deepest love is—he\nfinds that it rather DESTROYS than saves!—It is possible that\nunder the holy fable and travesty of the life of Jesus there is\nhidden one of the most painful cases of the martyrdom of\nKNOWLEDGE ABOUT LOVE: the martyrdom of the most innocent and most\ncraving heart, that never had enough of any human love, that\nDEMANDED love, that demanded inexorably and frantically to be\nloved and nothing else, with terrible outbursts against those who\nrefused him their love; the story of a poor soul insatiated and\ninsatiable in love, that had to invent hell to send thither those\nwho WOULD NOT love him—and that at last, enlightened about human\nlove, had to invent a God who is entire love, entire CAPACITY for\nlove—who takes pity on human love, because it is so paltry, so\nignorant! He who has such sentiments, he who has such KNOWLEDGE\nabout love—SEEKS for death!—But why should one deal with such\npainful matters? Provided, of course, that one is not obliged to\ndo so.",
        "270. The intellectual haughtiness and loathing of every man who\nhas suffered deeply—it almost determines the order of rank HOW\ndeeply men can suffer—the chilling certainty, with which he is\nthoroughly imbued and coloured, that by virtue of his suffering\nhe KNOWS MORE than the shrewdest and wisest can ever know, that\nhe has been familiar with, and “at home” in, many distant,\ndreadful worlds of which “YOU know nothing”!—this silent\nintellectual haughtiness of the sufferer, this pride of the elect\nof knowledge, of the “initiated,” of the almost sacrificed, finds\nall forms of disguise necessary to protect itself from contact\nwith officious and sympathizing hands, and in general from all\nthat is not its equal in suffering. Profound suffering makes\nnoble: it separates.—One of the most refined forms of disguise\nis Epicurism, along with a certain ostentatious boldness of\ntaste, which takes suffering lightly, and puts itself on the\ndefensive against all that is sorrowful and profound. They are\n\"gay men” who make use of gaiety, because they are misunderstood\non account of it—they WISH to be misunderstood. There are\n\"scientific minds” who make use of science, because it gives a\ngay appearance, and because scientificness leads to the\nconclusion that a person is superficial—they WISH to mislead to\na false conclusion. There are free insolent minds which would\nfain conceal and deny that they are broken, proud, incurable\nhearts (the cynicism of Hamlet—the case of Galiani); and\noccasionally folly itself is the mask of an unfortunate OVER-\nASSURED knowledge.—From which it follows that it is the part of\na more refined humanity to have reverence “for the mask,” and not\nto make use of psychology and curiosity in the wrong place.",

What does it matter about all their\nhonesty and reciprocal usefulness, what does it matter about all\ntheir mutual good-will: the fact still remains—they “cannot\nsmell each other!” The highest instinct for purity places him who\nis affected with it in the most extraordinary and dangerous\nisolation, as a saint: for it is just holiness—the highest\nspiritualization of the instinct in question. Any kind of\ncognizance of an indescribable excess in the joy of the bath, any\nkind of ardour or thirst which perpetually impels the soul out of\nnight into the morning, and out of gloom, out of “affliction\"\ninto clearness, brightness, depth, and refinement:—just as much\nas such a tendency DISTINGUISHES—it is a noble tendency—it also\nSEPARATES.—The pity of the saint is pity for the FILTH of the\nhuman, all-too-human. And there are grades and heights where pity\nitself is regarded by him as impurity, as filth.",

I—have no reason to cover my\nnakedness!” One suspects that this kind of divinity and\nphilosopher perhaps lacks shame?—He once said: “Under certain\ncircumstances I love mankind\"—and referred thereby to Ariadne,\nwho was present; “in my opinion man is an agreeable, brave,\ninventive animal, that has not his equal upon earth, he makes his\nway even through all labyrinths. I like man, and often think how\nI can still further advance him, and make him stronger, more\nevil, and more profound.\"—\"Stronger, more evil, and more\nprofound?” I asked in horror. “Yes,” he said again, “stronger,\nmore evil, and more profound; also more beautiful\"—and thereby\nthe tempter-god smiled with his halcyon smile, as though he had\njust paid some charming compliment. One here sees at once that it\nis not only shame that this divinity lacks;—and in general there\nare good grounds for supposing that in some things the Gods could\nall of them come to us men for instruction. We men are—more\nhuman.—",
        "296. Alas! what are you, after all, my written and painted\nthoughts! Not long ago you were so variegated, young and\nmalicious, so full of thorns and secret spices, that you made me\nsneeze and laugh—and now? You have already doffed your novelty,\nand some of you, I fear, are ready to become truths, so immortal\ndo they look, so pathetically honest, so tedious! And was it ever\notherwise? What then do we write and paint, we mandarins with\nChinese brush, we immortalisers of things which LEND themselves\nto writing, what are we alone capable of painting? Alas, only\nthat which is just about to fade and begins to lose its odour!\nAlas, only exhausted and departing storms and belated yellow\nsentiments! Alas, only birds strayed and fatigued by flight,\nwhich now let themselves be captured with the hand—with OUR\nhand! We immortalize what cannot live and fly much longer, things\nonly which are exhausted and mellow! And it is only for your\nAFTERNOON, you, my written and painted thoughts, for which alone\nI have colours, many colours, perhaps, many variegated\nsoftenings, and fifty yellows and browns and greens and reds;—\nbut nobody will divine thereby how ye looked in your morning, you\nsudden sparks and marvels of my solitude, you, my old, beloved—\nEVIL thoughts!",
