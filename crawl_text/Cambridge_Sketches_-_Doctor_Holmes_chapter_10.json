        "I have often been inside the old Holmes house in Cambridge. It served as\na boarding-house during our college days, but afterwards Professor James\nB. Thayer rented it for a term of years, until it was finally swept away\nlike chaff by President Eliot’s broom of reform. The popular notion that\nit was a quaint-looking old mansion of the eighteenth century, which\nseems to have been encouraged by Doctor Holmes himself, is a\nmisconception. It was a two-and-a-half story, low-studied house, such as\nwere built at the beginning of the last century, with a roof at an angle\nof forty-five degrees and a two-story ell on the right side of the front\ndoor. Doctor Holmes says:",
        "Now, any one who looks carefully at the picture of the old Holmes\nhouse, in Morse’s biography of the Doctor, will perceive that this\nwas not the style of roof which the house had,—at least, in its later\nyears.",
        "Doctor Holmes graduated at Harvard in 1829 at the age of twenty. His\nclass has been a celebrated one in Boston, and there were certainly some\ngood men in it,—especially Benjamin Pierce and James Freeman Clarke,—\nbut I think it was Doctor Holmes’s class-poems that gave it its chief\ncelebrity, which, after all, means that it was a good deal talked about.\nIn one of these he said:",
        "He was said to have composed twenty-nine poems for his class, and then\ndeclared that he had reached the proper limit,—that it would not be\nprudent to go beyond the magical number. It was not a dissipated class,\nbut one with a good deal of life in it, much given to late hours and\njokes, practical and unpractical. The Doctor himself is mysteriously\nsilent concerning his college course, and so are his biographers; but we\nmay surmise that it was not very different in general tenor from\nLowell’s; although his Yankee shrewdness would seem to have preserved him\nfrom serious catastrophes.",
        "In the “Autocrat of the Breakfast Table” Doctor Holmes mentions an early\nacquaintance with Margaret Fuller, which is not referred to by Mr. Morse,\nbut must have arisen either at Mrs. Prentiss’s Boston school or at the\nCambridgeport school which young Oliver afterwards attended. Even at that\nage he recognized Margaret’s intellectual gifts, and he was not a little\nemulous of her; for he fancied that he “had also drawn a small prize in\nthe great literary lottery.” He looked into one of her compositions,\nwhich was lying on the teacher’s desk, and felt quite crest-fallen by\ndiscovering a word in it which he did not know the meaning of. This word\nwas trite; and it may he suspected that a good many use it without\nbeing aware of its proper significance.",
        "Margaret Fuller rose to celebrity with the spontaneity of true genius,\nand left her name high upon the natural bridge of American literature.\nHolmes did not come before the public until years after her death; and\nthen perhaps it might not have happened but for James Russell Lowell and\nthe Atlantic. He was a bright man, and possessed a peculiar mental\nquality of his own; but as we think of him now we can hardly call him a\ngenius. He would evidently have liked in his youth to have made a\nprofession of literature; but his verse lacked the charm and universality\nwhich made Longfellow popular so readily; nor did he possess the daring\nspirit of innovation with which Emerson startled and convinced his\ncontemporaries. He first tried the law, and as that did not suit his\ntaste he fell into medicine, but evidently without any natural bent or\ninclination for the profession. He was fond of the university, and when,\nafter a temporary professorship at Dartmouth he was appointed lecturer on\nanatomy at the Harvard Medical-School, his friends realized that he had\nfound his right position.",
        "Lecturing on anatomy is a routine, but by no means a sinecure. It\nrequires a clearness and accuracy of statement which might be compared to\nthe work of an optician. Some idea of it can be derived from the fact\nthat there may be eight or ten points to a human bone, each of which has\na name of eight or ten syllables,—only to be acquired by the hardest\nstudy. Doctor Holmes’s lecturing manner was incisive and sometimes\npungent, like his conversation, but always good-humored and well\ncalculated to make an impression even on the most lymphatic temperaments.\nWhile it may be said that others might have done it as well, it is\ndoubtful if he could have been excelled in his own specialty. His ready\nfund of wit often served to revive the drooping spirits of his audience,\nand many of his jests have become a kind of legendary lore at the\nMedical-School. Most of them, however, were of a too anatomical character\nto be reproduced in print.",
        "So the years rolled over Doctor Holmes’s head; living quietly, working\nsteadily, and accumulating a store of proverbial wisdom by the way. In\nJune, 1840, he married Amelia Lee Jackson, of Boston, an alliance which\nbrought him into relationship with half the families on Beacon Street,\nand which may have exercised a determining influence on the future course\nof his life. Doctor Holmes was always liberally inclined, and ready to\nwelcome such social and political improvements as time might bring; but\nhe never joined any of the liberal or reformatory movements of his time.\nCertain old friends of Emerson affirmed, when Holmes published his\nbiography of the Concord sage in 1885, that no one else was so much given\nto jesting as Emerson in his younger days. This may have been true; but\nit is also undeniable that Emerson himself had changed much during that\ntime, and that the socialistic Emerson of 1840 was largely a different\nperson from the author of “Society and Solitude.” Holmes had already\ncomposed one of the fairest tributes to Emerson’s intellectual quality\nthat has yet been written.",
        "Emerson began his course in direct apposition to the conventional world;\nbut he was the great magnet of the age, and the world could not help\nbeing attracted by him. It modified its course, and Emerson also modified\nhis, so that the final reconciliation might take place. Meanwhile Doctor\nHolmes pursued the even tenor of his way. Concord does not appear to have\nbeen attractive to him. He had a brother, John Holmes, who was reputed by\nhis friends to be as witty as the “Autocrat” himself, but who lived a\nquiet, inconspicuous life. John was an intimate friend of Hon. E. R. Hoar\nand often went to Concord to visit him; but I never heard of the Doctor\nbeing seen there, though it may have happened before my time. He does not\nspeak over-much of Emerson in his letters, and does not mention\nHawthorne, Thoreau or Alcott, so far as we know, at all. They do not\nappear to have attracted his attention.",
        "We are indebted to Lowell for all that Doctor Holmes has given us. The\nDoctor was forty-eight when the Atlantic Monthly appeared before\nthe public, and according to his own confession he had long since given\nup hope of a literary life. We hardly know another instance like it; but\nso much the better for him. He had no immature efforts of early life to\nregret; and when the cask once was tapped, the old wine came forth with a\nfine bouquet. When Phillips & Sampson consulted Lowell in regard to the\neditorship of the Atlantic, he said at once: “We must get\nsomething from Oliver Wendell Holmes.” He was Lowell’s great discovery\nand proved to be his best card,—a clear, shining light, and not an\nignis fatuus.",
        "When the “Autocrat of the Breakfast Table” first appeared few were in the\nsecret of its authorship and everybody asked: “Who is this new luminary?\"\nIt was exactly what the more intelligent public wanted, and Holmes jumped\nat once into the position in literature which he has held ever since.\nReaders were delighted with his wit, surprised at his originality and\nimpressed by his proverbial wisdom. It was the advent of a sound, healthy\nintelligence, not unlike that of President Lincoln, which could deal with\ncommon-place subjects in a significant and characteristic manner. The\nlandlady’s daughter, the schoolmistress, little Boston, and the young man\ncalled John, are as real and tangible as the dramatis personae in\none of Moliere’s plays. They seem more real to us than many of the\ndistinguished men and women whom we read of in the newspapers.",
        "Doctor Holmes is the American Sterne. He did not seek a vehicle for his\nwit in the oddities and mishaps of English middle-class domestic life,\nbut in the contrasts and incongruities of a Boston boarding-house. He\ninforms us at the outset that he much prefers a family with an ancestry—\none that has had a judge or a governor in it, with old family portraits,\nold books and claw-footed furniture; but if Doctor Holmes had depended on\nsuch society for his material he would hardly have interested the public\nwhom he addressed. One of Goethe’s critics complained that the class of\npersons he had introduced in “Wilhelm Meister” did not belong to good\nsociety; and to this the “aristocratic” poet replied: “I have often been\nin society called good, from which I have not been able to obtain an idea\nfor the shortest poem.”",
        "So it is always: the interesting person is the one who struggles. After\nthe struggle is over, and prosperity commences, the moral ends,—young\nCorey and his bride go off to Mexico. The lives of families are\nrepresented by those of its prominent individuals. The ambitious son of\nan old and wealthy family makes a new departure from former precedents,\nthus creating a fresh struggle for himself, and becomes an orator, like\nWendell Philips, or a scientist, like Darwin.",
        "In the “Autocrat” we recognize the dingy wall-paper of the dining-room,\nthe well-worn furniture, the cracked water-pitcher, and the slight aroma\nof previous repasts; but we soon forget this unattractive background, for\nthe scene is full of genuine human life. The men and women who congregate\nthere appear for what they really are. They wear no mental masks and\nother disguises like the people we meet at fashionable entertainments;\nand each acts himself or herself. Boarding-houses, sanitariums, and sea\nvoyages are the places to study human nature. When a man is half seasick\nthe old original Adam shows forth in him through all the wrappings of\neducation, social restraint, imitation and attempts at self-improvement,\nwith which he has covered it over for so many years. Once on a Cunard\nsteamship I heard an architect from San Francisco tell the story of the\nhoop-snake, which takes its tail in its teeth and rolls over the prairies\nat a speed equal to any express train. He evidently believed the story\nhimself, and as I looked round on the company I saw that they all\nbelieved it, too, excepting Captain Martyn, who gave me a sly look from\nthe corner of his eye. “Rocked in the cradle of the deep,” they had\nbecome like children again, and were ready to credit anything that was\ntold in a confident manner. But Doctor Holmes’s digressions are\ninfectious.",
        "The “Autocrat of the Breakfast Table” is an irregular panorama of human\nlife without either a definite beginning or end,—unless the autocrat’s\noffering himself to the schoolmistress (an incident which only took place\non paper) can be considered so; but it is by no means a patchwork. He\ntalks of horse-racing, the Millerites, elm trees, Doctor Johnson, the\ncomposition of poetry and much else; but these subjects are introduced\nand treated with an adroitness that amounts to consummate art. He is\nalways at the boarding-house, and if his remarks sometimes shoot over the\nheads of his auditors, this is only because he intends that they should.\nThe first ten or fifteen pages of the “Autocrat” are written in such a\ncold, formal and pedantic manner that the wonder is that Lowell should\nhave published it. After that the style suddenly changes and the Doctor\nbecomes himself. It is like a convention call which ends in a sympathetic\nconversation.",
        "Doctor Holmes’s humor permeates every sentence that he wrote. Even in his\nmost serious moods we meet with it in a peculiar phrase, or the use of\nsome exceptional word.",
        "Now and then his wit is very brilliant, lighting up its surroundings like\nthe sudden appearance of a meteor. The essence of humor consists in a\ncontrast which places the object or person compared at a disadvantage. If\nthe contrast is a dignified one we have high comedy; but if the reverse,\nlow comedy. Some of Holmes’s comparisons make the reader laugh out aloud.\nHe says that a tedious preacher or lecturer, with an alert listener in\nthe audience, resembles a crow followed by a king-bird,—a spectacle\nwhich of itself is enough to make one smile; and as for an elevated\ncomparison, what could be more so, unless we were to seek one in the\nmoon. There is a threefold wit in it; but the full force of this can only\nbe appreciated in the original text.",
        "Nature commonly sets her own stamp on the face of a humorist. The long\npointed nose of Cervantes is indicative of immeasurable fun, and there\nhave been many similar noses on the faces of less distinguished wits.\nDoctor Holmes ridiculed phrenology as an attempt to estimate the money in\na safe by the knobs on the outside, but he evidently was a believer in\nphysiognomy, and he exemplified this in his own case. His face had a\ncomical expression from boyhood; its profile reminded one of those\nprehistoric images which Di Cesnola brought from Cyprus. As if he were\nconscious of this he asserted his dignity in a more decided manner than a\nman usually does who is confident of the respect of those about him. Thus\nhe acquired a style of his own, different from that of any other person\nin Boston. He was not a man to be treated with disrespect or undue\nfamiliarity.",
        "A medical student named Holyoke once had occasion to call on him, and as\nsoon as he had introduced himself Doctor Holmes said: “There, me friend,\nstand there and let me take an observation of you.” He then fetched an\nold book from his library which contained a portrait of Holyoke’s\ngrandfather, who had also been a physician. He compared the two faces,\nsaying: “Forehead much the same; nose not so full; mouth rather more\nfeminine; chin not quite so strong; but on the whole a very good\nlikeness, and I have no doubt you will make an excellent doctor.” After\nHolyoke had explained his business Doctor Holmes finally said: “I liked\nyour grandfather, and shall always be glad to see you here.”",
        "Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., was class poet of 1861, an honor which\npleased his father very much. Immediately after graduating he went to the\nwar, and came near losing his life at the battle of Antietam. A rifle-\nball passed through both lungs, and narrowly missed his heart. Alexander\nHamilton died of exactly such a wound in seven hours; and yet in three\ndays Captain Holmes was able to write to his father. The Doctor started\nat once for the seat of war, and met with quite a series of small\nadventures which he afterwards described in a felicitous article in the\nAtlantic, called “My Hunt after the Captain.” His friend, Dr.\nHenry P. Bowditch, lost his son in the same battle, and when they met at\nthe railway depot Holmes said: “I would give my house to have your\nfortune like mine.”",
        "In a letter to Motley dated February 3, 1862, he says:",
        "“I was at a dinner at Parker’s the other day where Governor Andrew and\nEmerson, and various unknown dingy-linened friends of progress met to\nhear Mr. Conway, the not unfamous Unitarian minister of Washington,—\nVirginia-born, with seventeen secesh cousins, fathers, and other\nrelatives,—tell of his late experience at the seat of Government. He is\nan out-and-out immediate emancipationist,—believes that is the only way\nto break the strength of the South; that the black man is the life of the\nSouth; that they dread work above all things, and cling to the slave as\nthe drudge that makes life tolerable to them. I do not know if his\nopinion is worth much.”",
        "This was a meeting of the Bird Club which Doctor Holmes attended and the\ndingy-linened friends of progress were such men as Dr. Samuel G. Howe,\nGovernor Washburn, Governor Claflin, Dr. Estes Howe, and Frank B.\nSanborn. It has always been a trick of fashionable society, a trick as\nold as the age of Pericles, to disparage liberalism by accusing it of\nvulgarity; but we regret to find Doctor Holmes falling into line in this\nparticular. He always speaks of Sumner in his letters with something like\na slur—not to Motley, for Motley was Sumner’s friend, but to others who\nmight be more sympathetic. This did not, however, prevent him from going\nto Sumner in 1868 to ask a favor for his second son, who wanted to be\nprivate secretary to the Senator and learn something of foreign affairs.\nSumner granted the request, although he must have been aware that the\nDoctor was not over-friendly to him; but it proved an unfortunate\ncircumstance for Edward J. Holmes, who contracted malaria in Washington,\nand this finally resulted in an early death.",
        "Why is it that members of the medical profession should take an\nexceptional interest in poisonous reptiles? Professor Reichert and Dr. S.\nWeir Mitchell spent a large portion of their leisure hours for several\nyears in experimenting with the virus of rattlesnakes, and of the Gila\nmonster, without, however, quite exhausting the subject. Doctor Holmes\nkept a rattlesnake in a cage for a pet, and was accustomed to stir it up\nwith an ox-goad. A New York doctor lost his life by fooling with a\npoisonous snake, and another in Liverpool frightened a whole congregation\nof scientists with two torpid rattlesnakes which suddenly came to life on\nthe president’s table. Does it arise from their custom of dealing with\ndeadly poisons, or is it because they officiate as the high priests of\nmortality?",
        "Doctor Holmes’s “Elsie Venner” was one of the offshoots of this peculiar\nmedical interest, and when we think of it in that light the story seems\nnatural enough. The idea of a snaky woman is as old as the fable of\nMedusa. I read the novel when I was fifteen, and it made as decided an\nimpression on me as “Ivanhoe” or “Pickwick.” I remember especially a\nproverbial saying of the old doctor who serves as the presiding genius of\nthe plot: he knew “the kind of people who are never sick but what they\nare going to die, and the other kind who never know they are sick until\nthey are dead.” If Doctor Holmes had taken this as his text, and written\na novel on those lines, he might have created a work of far-reaching\nimportance. He appears to have known very little concerning poisonous\nreptiles; had never heard of the terrible fer-de-lance, which infests the\ncane-swamps of Brazil—a snake ten feet in length which strikes without\nwarning and straight as a fencer’s thrust. But “Elsie Venner” and\nHolmes’s second novel, “The Guardian Angel,” are, to use Lowell’s\nexpression on a different subject:",
        "In the autumn of 1865 some Harvard students, radically inclined, obtained\npossession of a religious society in the college called the Christian\nUnion, revolutionized it and changed its name to the Liberal Fraternity.\nThey then invited Emerson, Henry James, Sr., Doctor Holmes, and Colonel\nHigginson to deliver lectures in Cambridge under their auspices. This was\na pretty bold stroke, but Holmes evidently liked it. He said to the\ncommittee that waited upon him: “What is your rank and file? How deep do\nyou go down into the class?” He also promised to lecture, and that he did\nnot was more the fault of the students than his own. He was by no means a\nradical in religious matters, but he hated small sectarian differences—\nthe substitution of dogma for true religious feeling. In his poem at the\ngrand Harvard celebration in 1886 he made a special point of this\nprinciple:",
        "Creeds are necessary, however, and an enlightened education teaches us\nnot to value them above their true worth.",
        "In 1867 Doctor Holmes published a volume of poetry which was generally\nwell received, but was criticised in the Nation with needless and\nunmerciful severity. Rev. Edward Everett Hale and other friends of his\nhad already been attacked in the same periodical, and the Doctor thought\nhe knew the man who did it; but whether he was right in his conjecture\ncannot be affirmed. There can be no doubt that these diatribes were\nwritten by a Harvard professor who owned a large interest in the\nNation, and who was obliged to go to Europe the following year in\norder to escape the odium of an imprudent speech at a public dinner. In\nthis critique Holmes’s poetry was summed up under the heading of\n“versified misfortunes\"; and Holmes himself wrote to Mrs. Stowe that the\nobject of the writer was evidently “to injure at any rate, and to wound\nif possible.”",
        "It was certainly contemptible to treat a man like Doctor Holmes in this\nmanner,—one so universally kind to others, and whose work was always, at\nleast, above mediocrity. He behaved in a dignified manner in regard to\nit, and he made no attempt at self-justification, although the wound was\nevidently long in healing. What recourse has a man who places himself\nbefore the public against the envenomed shafts of an invisible adversary?\nOf this at least we may be satisfied, that whatever is extravagant and\noverwrought always brings its own reaction in due course; and Doctor\nHolmes’s reputation does not appear to have suffered permanently from\nthis attack. The general public, especially the republic of womankind,\nforms its own opinion, and pays slight attention to literary criticisms\nof that description.",
        "Holmes’s poetry rarely rises to eloquence, but neither does it descend to\nsentimentality. It resembles the man’s own life, in which there were no\nbold endeavors, great feats, or desperate struggles; but it was a life so\njudicious, healthful and highly intellectual that we cannot help admiring\nit. “Dorothy Q.” is perhaps the best of his short poems, as it is the\nmost widely known. The name itself is slightly humorous, but it is a\nperfect work of art, and the line,",
        "has the beautiful hush of a sanctuary in it. A finer verse could not be\nwritten. Also for a comic piece nothing equal to “The Wonderful One-hoss\nShay” has appeared since Burns’s “Tam O’Shanter.” It is based on a\nlogical illusion which brings it down to recent times, and the gravity\nwith which the story is narrated makes its impossibility all the more\namusing. The building of the chaise is described with a practical\naccuracy of detail, and yet with a poetical turn to every verse:",
        "I believe that even cultivated readers have found more real satisfaction\nin the “One-Hoss Shay” than in many a more celebrated lyric.",
        "Doctor Holmes lived amid a comparatively narrow circle of friends and\nacquaintances. He attended the Saturday Club, but Lowell appears to have\nbeen the only member of it with whom he was on confidential terms. He was\nrarely seen or heard of in Longfellow’s house. In the winter of 1878 he\nmet Mrs. L. Maria Child for the first time at the Chestnut Street Club.\nIt appears that she did not catch his name when he was introduced to her,\nand stranger still did not recognize his face. When the Doctor inquired\nconcerning her literary occupation she replied that she considered\nherself too old to drive a quill any longer, and then fortunately added:\n“Now, there is Doctor Holmes, I think he shows his customary good\njudgment in retiring from the literary field in proper season.” What the\nDoctor thought of this is unknown, but he still continued to write.",
        "At the age of seventy his alma mater conferred on Doctor Holmes an\nLL.D., and this was followed soon afterwards by Oxford and Cambridge, in\nEngland; but why was it not given ten or fifteen years earlier, when\nHolmes was in his prime? Then it might have been a service and a\nsatisfaction to him; but when a man is seventy such tributes have small\nvalue for him. There had been an Atlantic breakfast for Doctor\nHolmes in Boston, and a Holmes breakfast in New York. He was in the\npublic eye, and by honoring him the University honored itself. So Harvard\nconferred an LL.D. on General Winfield Scott just before the fatal battle\nof Bull Run,—instead of after his brilliant Mexican campaign. If the\ndegree was not conferred on Holmes for his literary work, what reason\ncould be assigned for it; and if he deserved it on that account, Emerson\nand Hawthorne certainly deserved it much more. Let us be thankful that no\nsuch mischief was contemplated. If honorary degrees are to be given in\norder to attract attention to a university, or worse still, for the\npurpose of obtaining legacies, they had better be abolished altogether.",
        "During his last visit to England Doctor Holmes was the guest of F. Max\nMuller at Oxford, and years afterwards Professor Muller wrote to an\nAmerican correspondent concerning him and others:",
        "“Froude was a dear friend of mine, related to my wife; so was Kingsley—\ndear soul. Renan used to fetch books for me when we first met at the\nBibliothique Royale. Emerson stayed at my house on his last visit here.\nBut the best of all my American friends was Wendell Holmes. When he left\nus he said, ’I have talked to thousands of people—you are the only one\nwith whom I have had a conversation.’ We had talked about [Greek: ta\nmegisthta]—the world as the logos, as the thought of God. What a pure\nsoul his was—a real Serene Highness.”",
        "This is trancendentalism from the fountainhead; and here Doctor Holmes\nmay fairly be said to have avenged himself on the Nation’s\nexcoriating critic.",
