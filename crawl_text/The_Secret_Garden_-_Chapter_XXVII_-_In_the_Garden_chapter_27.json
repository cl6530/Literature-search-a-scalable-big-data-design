        "In each century since the beginning of the world wonderful\nthings have been discovered.  In the last century more\namazing things were found out than in any century before.\nIn this new century hundreds of things still more\nastounding will be brought to light.  At first people\nrefuse to believe that a strange new thing can be done,\nthen they begin to hope it can be done, then they see it\ncan be done–then it is done and all the world wonders\nwhy it was not done centuries ago.  One of the new things\npeople began to find out in the last century was that\nthoughts–just mere thoughts–are as powerful as electric\nbatteries–as good for one as sunlight is, or as bad\nfor one as poison.  To let a sad thought or a bad one get\ninto your mind is as dangerous as letting a scarlet fever\ngerm get into your body.  If you let it stay there after\nit has got in you may never get over it as long as you live.",
        "So long as Mistress Mary’s mind was full of disagreeable\nthoughts about her dislikes and sour opinions of people\nand her determination not to be pleased by or interested\nin anything, she was a yellow-faced, sickly, bored and\nwretched child.  Circumstances, however, were very\nkind to her, though she was not at all aware of it.\nThey began to push her about for her own good.  When her\nmind gradually filled itself with robins, and moorland\ncottages crowded with children, with queer crabbed\nold gardeners and common little Yorkshire housemaids,\nwith springtime and with secret gardens coming alive day\nby day, and also with a moor boy and his “creatures,” there\nwas no room left for the disagreeable thoughts which affected\nher liver and her digestion and made her yellow and tired.",
        "So long as Colin shut himself up in his room and thought\nonly of his fears and weakness and his detestation\nof people who looked at him and reflected hourly on\nhumps and early death, he was a hysterical half-crazy\nlittle hypochondriac who knew nothing of the sunshine\nand the spring and also did not know that he could get\nwell and could stand upon his feet if he tried to do it.\nWhen new beautiful thoughts began to push out the old\nhideous ones, life began to come back to him, his blood ran\nhealthily through his veins and strength poured into him\nlike a flood.  His scientific experiment was quite practical\nand simple and there was nothing weird about it at all.\nMuch more surprising things can happen to any one who,\nwhen a disagreeable or discouraged thought comes into his mind,\njust has the sense to remember in time and push it out\nby putting in an agreeable determinedly courageous one.\nTwo things cannot be in one place.",
        "         “Where, you tend a rose, my lad,\n         A thistle cannot grow.”",
        "While the secret garden was coming alive and two children\nwere coming alive with it, there was a man wandering about\ncertain far-away beautiful places in the Norwegian fiords\nand the valleys and mountains of Switzerland and he was\na man who for ten years had kept his mind filled with dark\nand heart-broken thinking.  He had not been courageous;\nhe had never tried to put any other thoughts in the place of\nthe dark ones.  He had wandered by blue lakes and thought them;\nhe had lain on mountain-sides with sheets of deep blue\ngentians blooming all about him and flower breaths filling\nall the air and he had thought them.  A terrible sorrow\nhad fallen upon him when he had been happy and he had\nlet his soul fill itself with blackness and had refused\nobstinately to allow any rift of light to pierce through.\nHe had forgotten and deserted his home and his duties.\nWhen he traveled about, darkness so brooded over him that\nthe sight of him was a wrong done to other people because\nit was as if he poisoned the air about him with gloom.\nMost strangers thought he must be either half mad or a man\nwith some hidden crime on his soul.  He, was a tall man\nwith a drawn face and crooked shoulders and the name he\nalways entered on hotel registers was, “Archibald Craven,\nMisselthwaite Manor, Yorkshire, England.”",
        "He had traveled far and wide since the day he saw Mistress\nMary in his study and told her she might have her “bit\nof earth.” He had been in the most beautiful places in Europe,\nthough he had remained nowhere more than a few days.\nHe had chosen the quietest and remotest spots.\nHe had been on the tops of mountains whose heads were\nin the clouds and had looked down on other mountains\nwhen the sun rose and touched them with such light\nas made it seem as if the world were just being born.",
        "But the light had never seemed to touch himself until\none day when he realized that for the first time in ten\nyears a strange thing had happened.  He was in a wonderful\nvalley in the Austrian Tyrol and he had been walking alone\nthrough such beauty as might have lifted, any man’s soul\nout of shadow.  He had walked a long way and it had not\nlifted his.  But at last he had felt tired and had thrown\nhimself down to rest on a carpet of moss by a stream.\nIt was a clear little stream which ran quite merrily along\non its narrow way through the luscious damp greenness.\nSometimes it made a sound rather like very low laughter\nas it bubbled over and round stones.  He saw birds\ncome and dip their heads to drink in it and then flick\ntheir wings and fly away.  It seemed like a thing alive\nand yet its tiny voice made the stillness seem deeper.\nThe valley was very, very still.",
        "As he sat gazing into the clear running of the water,\nArchibald Craven gradually felt his mind and body\nboth grow quiet, as quiet as the valley itself.\nHe wondered if he were going to sleep, but he was not.\nHe sat and gazed at the sunlit water and his eyes began\nto see things growing at its edge.  There was one lovely\nmass of blue forget-me-nots growing so close to the stream\nthat its leaves were wet and at these he found himself looking\nas he remembered he had looked at such things years ago.\nHe was actually thinking tenderly how lovely it was and\nwhat wonders of blue its hundreds of little blossoms were.\nHe did not know that just that simple thought was slowly\nfilling his mind–filling and filling it until other things\nwere softly pushed aside.  It was as if a sweet clear\nspring had begun to rise in a stagnant pool and had risen\nand risen until at last it swept the dark water away.\nBut of course he did not think of this himself.  He only\nknew that the valley seemed to grow quieter and quieter\nas he sat and stared at the bright delicate blueness.\nHe did not know how long he sat there or what was happening\nto him, but at last he moved as if he were awakening\nand he got up slowly and stood on the moss carpet,\ndrawing a long, deep, soft breath and wondering at himself.\nSomething seemed to have been unbound and released in him,\nvery quietly.",
        "“What is it?” he said, almost in a whisper, and he passed\nhis hand over his forehead.  “I almost feel as if–I\nwere alive!”",
        "I do not know enough about the wonderfulness of undiscovered\nthings to be able to explain how this had happened to him.\nNeither does any one else yet.  He did not understand\nat all himself–but he remembered this strange hour\nmonths afterward when he was at Misselthwaite again\nand he found out quite by accident that on this very day\nColin had cried out as he went into the secret garden:",
        "“I am going to live forever and ever and ever!”",
        "The singular calmness remained with him the rest of the\nevening and he slept a new reposeful sleep; but it was\nnot with him very long.  He did not know that it could\nbe kept.  By the next night he had opened the doors\nwide to his dark thoughts and they had come trooping\nand rushing back.  He left the valley and went on his\nwandering way again.  But, strange as it seemed to him,\nthere were minutes–sometimes half-hours–when, without\nhis knowing why, the black burden seemed to lift itself\nagain and he knew he was a living man and not a dead one.\nSlowly–slowly–for no reason that he knew of–he was\n“coming alive” with the garden.",
        "As the golden summer changed into the deep golden autumn he\nwent to the Lake of Como.  There he found the loveliness\nof a dream.  He spent his days upon the crystal blueness\nof the lake or he walked back into the soft thick verdure\nof the hills and tramped until he was tired so that he\nmight sleep.  But by this time he had begun to sleep better,\nhe knew, and his dreams had ceased to be a terror to him.",
        "“Perhaps,” he thought, “my body is growing stronger.”",
        "It was growing stronger but–because of the rare\npeaceful hours when his thoughts were changed–his soul\nwas slowly growing stronger, too.  He began to think\nof Misselthwaite and wonder if he should not go home.\nNow and then he wondered vaguely about his boy and asked\nhimself what he should feel when he went and stood\nby the carved four-posted bed again and looked down at\nthe sharply chiseled ivory-white face while it slept and,\nthe black lashes rimmed so startlingly the close-shut eyes.\nHe shrank from it.",
        "One marvel of a day he had walked so far that when he\nreturned the moon was high and full and all the world\nwas purple shadow and silver.  The stillness of lake\nand shore and wood was so wonderful that he did not go\ninto the villa he lived in.  He walked down to a little\nbowered terrace at the water’s edge and sat upon a seat\nand breathed in all the heavenly scents of the night.\nHe felt the strange calmness stealing over him and it grew\ndeeper and deeper until he fell asleep.",
        "He did not know when he fell asleep and when he began\nto dream; his dream was so real that he did not feel\nas if he were dreaming.  He remembered afterward how\nintensely wide awake and alert he had thought he was.\nHe thought that as he sat and breathed in the scent of\nthe late roses and listened to the lapping of the water\nat his feet he heard a voice calling.  It was sweet\nand clear and happy and far away.  It seemed very far,\nbut he heard it as distinctly as if it had been at his\nvery side.",
        "“Archie! Archie! Archie!” it said, and then again,\nsweeter and clearer than before, “Archie! Archie!”",
        "He thought he sprang to his feet not even startled.\nIt was such a real voice and it seemed so natural that he\nshould hear it.",
        "“Lilias! Lilias!” he answered.  “Lilias! where are you?”",
        "“In the garden,” it came back like a sound from\na golden flute.  “In the garden!”",
        "And then the dream ended.  But he did not awaken.\nHe slept soundly and sweetly all through the lovely night.\nWhen he did awake at last it was brilliant morning and a\nservant was standing staring at him.  He was an Italian\nservant and was accustomed, as all the servants of the\nvilla were, to accepting without question any strange thing\nhis foreign master might do.  No one ever knew when he\nwould go out or come in or where he would choose to sleep\nor if he would roam about the garden or lie in the boat\non the lake all night.  The man held a salver with some\nletters on it and he waited quietly until Mr. Craven\ntook them.  When he had gone away Mr. Craven sat a few\nmoments holding them in his hand and looking at the lake.\nHis strange calm was still upon him and something more–a\nlightness as if the cruel thing which had been done had\nnot happened as he thought–as if something had changed.\nHe was remembering the dream–the real–real dream.",
        "“In the garden!” he said, wondering at himself.  “In the\ngarden! But the door is locked and the key is buried deep.”",
        "When he glanced at the letters a few minutes later he\nsaw that the one lying at the top of the rest was an\nEnglish letter and came from Yorkshire.  It was directed\nin a plain woman’s hand but it was not a hand he knew.\nHe opened it, scarcely thinking of the writer, but the\nfirst words attracted his attention at once.",
        "“Dear Sir:",
        "I am Susan Sowerby that made bold to speak to you\nonce on the moor.  It was about Miss Mary I spoke.\nI will make bold to speak again.  Please, sir, I would\ncome home if I was you.  I think you would be glad to come\nand–if you will excuse me, sir–I think your lady would\nask you to come if she was here.",
        "                      Your obedient servant,\n                      Susan Sowerby.”",
        "Mr. Craven read the letter twice before he put it back\nin its envelope.  He kept thinking about the dream.",
        "“I will go back to Misselthwaite,” he said.  “Yes, I’ll\ngo at once.”",
        "And he went through the garden to the villa and ordered\nPitcher to prepare for his return to England.",
        "In a few days he was in Yorkshire again, and on his long\nrailroad journey he found himself thinking of his boy\nas he had never thought in all the ten years past.\nDuring those years he had only wished to forget him.\nNow, though he did not intend to think about him,\nmemories of him constantly drifted into his mind.\nHe remembered the black days when he had raved like a madman\nbecause the child was alive and the mother was dead.\nHe had refused to see it, and when he had gone to look\nat it at last it had been, such a weak wretched thing\nthat everyone had been sure it would die in a few days.\nBut to the surprise of those who took care of it the days\npassed and it lived and then everyone believed it would be a\ndeformed and crippled creature.",
        "He had not meant to be a bad father, but he had not felt\nlike a father at all.  He had supplied doctors and nurses\nand luxuries, but he had shrunk from the mere thought\nof the boy and had buried himself in his own misery.\nThe first time after a year’s absence he returned\nto Misselthwaite and the small miserable looking thing\nlanguidly and indifferently lifted to his face the great\ngray eyes with black lashes round them, so like and yet\nso horribly unlike the happy eyes he had adored, he could\nnot bear the sight of them and turned away pale as death.\nAfter that he scarcely ever saw him except when he was asleep,\nand all he knew of him was that he was a confirmed invalid,\nwith a vicious, hysterical, half-insane temper.  He could\nonly be kept from furies dangerous to himself by being\ngiven his own way in every detail.",
        "All this was not an uplifting thing to recall, but as\nthe train whirled him through mountain passes and golden\nplains the man who was “coming alive” began to think\nin a new way and he thought long and steadily and deeply.",
        "“Perhaps I have been all wrong for ten years,\"\nhe said to himself.  “Ten years is a long time.\nIt may be too late to do anything–quite too late.\nWhat have I been thinking of!”",
        "Of course this was the wrong Magic–to begin by saying\n“too late.” Even Colin could have told him that.\nBut he knew nothing of Magic–either black or white.\nThis he had yet to learn.  He wondered if Susan Sowerby\nhad taken courage and written to him only because the\nmotherly creature had realized that the boy was much\nworse–was fatally ill.  If he had not been under the\nspell of the curious calmness which had taken possession\nof him he would have been more wretched than ever.\nBut the calm had brought a sort of courage and hope with it.\nInstead of giving way to thoughts of the worst he actually\nfound he was trying to believe in better things.",
        "“Could it be possible that she sees that I may be able\nto do him good and control him?” he thought.  “I will go\nand see her on my way to Misselthwaite.”",
        "But when on his way across the moor he stopped the carriage\nat the cottage, seven or eight children who were playing\nabout gathered in a group and bobbing seven or eight\nfriendly and polite curtsies told him that their mother\nhad gone to the other side of the moor early in the morning\nto help a woman who had a new baby.  “Our Dickon,\"\nthey volunteered, was over at the Manor working in one\nof the gardens where he went several days each week.",
        "Mr. Craven looked over the collection of sturdy little\nbodies and round red-cheeked faces, each one grinning\nin its own particular way, and he awoke to the fact\nthat they were a healthy likable lot.  He smiled at their\nfriendly grins and took a golden sovereign from his pocket\nand gave it to “our ’Lizabeth Ellen” who was the oldest.",
        "“If you divide that into eight parts there will be half\na crown for each of, you,” he said.",
        "Then amid grins and chuckles and bobbing of curtsies he\ndrove away, leaving ecstasy and nudging elbows and little\njumps of joy behind.",
        "The drive across the wonderfulness of the moor was\na soothing thing.  Why did it seem to give him a sense\nof homecoming which he had been sure he could never feel\nagain–that sense of the beauty of land and sky and purple\nbloom of distance and a warming of the heart at drawing,\nnearer to the great old house which had held those of\nhis blood for six hundred years? How he had driven\naway from it the last time, shuddering to think of its\nclosed rooms and the boy lying in the four-posted bed\nwith the brocaded hangings.  Was it possible that perhaps\nhe might find him changed a little for the better\nand that he might overcome his shrinking from him?\nHow real that dream had been–how wonderful and clear\nthe voice which called back to him, “In the garden–In the\ngarden!”",
        "“I will try to find the key,” he said.  “I will try\nto open the door.  I must–though I don’t know why.”",
        "When he arrived at the Manor the servants who\nreceived him with the usual ceremony noticed that he\nlooked better and that he did not go to the remote\nrooms where he usually lived attended by Pitcher.\nHe went into the library and sent for Mrs. Medlock.\nShe came to him somewhat excited and curious and flustered.",
        "“How is Master Colin, Medlock?” he inquired.  “Well, sir,\"\nMrs. Medlock answered, “he’s–he’s different, in a manner\nof speaking.”",
        "“Worse?” he suggested.",
        "Mrs. Medlock really was flushed.",
        "“Well, you see, sir,” she tried to explain, “neither\nDr. Craven, nor the nurse, nor me can exactly make him out.”",
        "“Why is that?”",
        "“To tell the truth, sir, Master Colin might be better\nand he might be changing for the worse.  His appetite,\nsir, is past understanding–and his ways–”",
        "“Has he become more–more peculiar?” her master, asked,\nknitting his brows anxiously.",
        "“That’s it, sir.  He’s growing very peculiar–when you\ncompare him with what he used to be.  He used to eat nothing\nand then suddenly he began to eat something enormous–and\nthen he stopped again all at once and the meals were sent\nback just as they used to be.  You never knew, sir, perhaps,\nthat out of doors he never would let himself be taken.\nThe things we’ve gone through to get him to go out in\nhis chair would leave a body trembling like a leaf.\nHe’d throw himself into such a state that Dr. Craven said\nhe couldn’t be responsible for forcing him.  Well, sir,\njust without warning–not long after one of his worst\ntantrums he suddenly insisted on being taken out every day\nby Miss Mary and Susan Sowerby’s boy Dickon that could push\nhis chair.  He took a fancy to both Miss Mary and Dickon,\nand Dickon brought his tame animals, and, if you’ll\ncredit it, sir, out of doors he will stay from morning until\nnight.”",
        "“How does he look?” was the next question.",
        "“If he took his food natural, sir, you’d think he was putting\non flesh–but we’re afraid it may be a sort of bloat.\nHe laughs sometimes in a queer way when he’s alone with\nMiss Mary.  He never used to laugh at all.  Dr. Craven\nis coming to see you at once, if you’ll allow him.\nHe never was as puzzled in his life.”",
        "“Where is Master Colin now?” Mr. Craven asked.",
        "“In the garden, sir.  He’s always in the garden–though\nnot a human creature is allowed to go near for fear\nthey’ll look at him.”",
        "Mr. Craven scarcely heard her last words.",
        "“In the garden,” he said, and after he had sent Mrs. Medlock\naway he stood and repeated it again and again.\n“In the garden!”",
        "He had to make an effort to bring himself back to\nthe place he was standing in and when he felt he was\non earth again he turned and went out of the room.\nHe took his way, as Mary had done, through the door in the\nshrubbery and among the laurels and the fountain beds.\nThe fountain was playing now and was encircled by beds\nof brilliant autumn flowers.  He crossed the lawn and\nturned into the Long Walk by the ivied walls.  He did not\nwalk quickly, but slowly, and his eyes were on the path.\nHe felt as if he were being drawn back to the place\nhe had so long forsaken, and he did not know why.\nAs he drew near to it his step became still more slow.\nHe knew where the door was even though the ivy hung thick\nover it–but he did not know exactly where it lay–that\nburied key.",
        "So he stopped and stood still, looking about him,\nand almost the moment after he had paused he started\nand listened–asking himself if he were walking in a dream.",
        "The ivy hung thick over the door, the key was buried\nunder the shrubs, no human being had passed that portal\nfor ten lonely years–and yet inside the garden there\nwere sounds.  They were the sounds of running scuffling\nfeet seeming to chase round and round under the trees,\nthey were strange sounds of lowered suppressed\nvoices–exclamations and smothered joyous cries.\nIt seemed actually like the laughter of young things,\nthe uncontrollable laughter of children who were trying not\nto be heard but who in a moment or so–as their excitement\nmounted–would burst forth.  What in heaven’s name was he\ndreaming of–what in heaven’s name did he hear? Was he\nlosing his reason and thinking he heard things which were\nnot for human ears? Was it that the far clear voice had meant?",
        "And then the moment came, the uncontrollable moment\nwhen the sounds forgot to hush themselves.  The feet ran\nfaster and faster–they were nearing the garden door–there\nwas quick strong young breathing and a wild outbreak\nof laughing shows which could not be contained–and the\ndoor in the wall was flung wide open, the sheet of ivy\nswinging back, and a boy burst through it at full speed and,\nwithout seeing the outsider, dashed almost into his arms.",
        "Mr. Craven had extended them just in time to save him\nfrom falling as a result of his unseeing dash against him,\nand when he held him away to look at him in amazement\nat his being there he truly gasped for breath.",
        "He was a tall boy and a handsome one.  He was glowing\nwith life and his running had sent splendid color leaping\nto his face.  He threw the thick hair back from his forehead\nand lifted a pair of strange gray eyes–eyes full of boyish\nlaughter and rimmed with black lashes like a fringe.\nIt was the eyes which made Mr. Craven gasp for breath.\n“Who–What? Who!” he stammered.",
        "This was not what Colin had expected–this was not what he\nhad planned.  He had never thought of such a meeting.\nAnd yet to come dashing out–winning a race–perhaps it\nwas even better.  He drew himself up to his very tallest.\nMary, who had been running with him and had dashed through\nthe door too, believed that he managed to make himself\nlook taller than he had ever looked before–inches taller.",
        "“Father,” he said, “I’m Colin.  You can’t believe it.\nI scarcely can myself.  I’m Colin.”",
        "Like Mrs. Medlock, he did not understand what his father\nmeant when he said hurriedly:",
        "“In the garden! In the garden!”",
        "“Yes,” hurried on Colin.  “It was the garden that did\nit–and Mary and Dickon and the creatures–and the Magic.\nNo one knows.  We kept it to tell you when you came.\nI’m well, I can beat Mary in a race.  I’m going to be\nan athlete.”",
        "He said it all so like a healthy boy–his face flushed,\nhis words tumbling over each other in his eagerness–that\nMr. Craven’s soul shook with unbelieving joy.",
        "Colin put out his hand and laid it on his father’s arm.",
        "“Aren’t you glad, Father?” he ended.  “Aren’t you glad?\nI’m going to live forever and ever and ever!”",
        "Mr. Craven put his hands on both the boy’s shoulders\nand held him still.  He knew he dared not even try\nto speak for a moment.",
        "“Take me into the garden, my boy,” he said at last.\n“And tell me all about it.”",
        "And so they led him in.",
        "The place was a wilderness of autumn gold and purple\nand violet blue and flaming scarlet and on every side were\nsheaves of late lilies standing together–lilies which were\nwhite or white and ruby.  He remembered well when the\nfirst of them had been planted that just at this season\nof the year their late glories should reveal themselves.\nLate roses climbed and hung and clustered and the sunshine\ndeepening the hue of the yellowing trees made one feel\nthat one, stood in an embowered temple of gold.\nThe newcomer stood silent just as the children had done\nwhen they came into its grayness.  He looked round and round.",
        "“I thought it would be dead,” he said.”",
        "“Mary thought so at first,” said Colin.  “But it came alive.”",
        "Then they sat down under their tree–all but Colin,\nwho wanted to stand while he told the story.",
        "It was the strangest thing he had ever heard, Archibald Craven\nthought, as it was poured forth in headlong boy fashion.\nMystery and Magic and wild creatures, the weird midnight\nmeeting–the coming of the spring–the passion of insulted\npride which had dragged the young Rajah to his feet to defy\nold Ben Weatherstaff to his face.  The odd companionship,\nthe play acting, the great secret so carefully kept.\nThe listener laughed until tears came into his eyes and\nsometimes tears came into his eyes when he was not laughing.\nThe Athlete, the Lecturer, the Scientific Discoverer\nwas a laughable, lovable, healthy young human thing.",
        "“Now,” he said at the end of the story, “it need not be\na secret any more.  I dare say it will frighten them\nnearly into fits when they see me–but I am never going\nto get into the chair again.  I shall walk back with you,\nFather–to the house.”",
        "Ben Weatherstaff’s duties rarely took him away from the gardens,\nbut on this occasion he made an excuse to carry some\nvegetables to the kitchen and being invited into the servants’\nhall by Mrs. Medlock to drink a glass of beer he was on\nthe spot–as he had hoped to be–when the most dramatic\nevent Misselthwaite Manor had seen during the present\ngeneration actually took place.  One of the windows looking\nupon the courtyard gave also a glimpse of the lawn.\nMrs. Medlock, knowing Ben had come from the gardens,\nhoped that he might have caught sight of his master\nand even by chance of his meeting with Master Colin.",
        "“Did you see either of them, Weatherstaff?” she asked.",
        "Ben took his beer-mug from his mouth and wiped his lips\nwith the back of his hand.",
        "“Aye, that I did,” he answered with a shrewdly significant air.",
        "“Both of them?” suggested Mrs. Medlock.",
        "“Both of ’em,” returned Ben Weatherstaff.  “Thank ye kindly,\nma’am, I could sup up another mug of it.”",
        "“Together?” said Mrs. Medlock, hastily overfilling his\nbeer-mug in her excitement.",
        "“Together, ma’am,” and Ben gulped down half of his new\nmug at one gulp.",
        "“Where was Master Colin? How did he look? What did they\nsay to each other?”",
        "“I didna’ hear that,” said Ben, “along o’ only bein’ on th’\nstepladder lookin, over th’ wall.  But I’ll tell thee this.\nThere’s been things goin’ on outside as you house people\nknows nowt about.  An’ what tha’ll find out tha’ll find\nout soon.”",
        "And it was not two minutes before he swallowed the last\nof his beer and waved his mug solemnly toward the window\nwhich took in through the shrubbery a piece of the lawn.",
        "“Look there,” he said, “if tha’s curious.  Look what’s comin’\nacross th’ grass.”",
        "When Mrs. Medlock looked she threw up her hands and gave\na little shriek and every man and woman servant within hearing\nbolted across the servants’ hall and stood looking through\nthe window with their eyes almost starting out of their heads.",
        "Across the lawn came the Master of Misselthwaite and he\nlooked as many of them had never seen him.  And by his,\nside with his head up in the air and his eyes full\nof laughter walked as strongly and steadily as any boy\nin Yorkshire–Master Colin.",
