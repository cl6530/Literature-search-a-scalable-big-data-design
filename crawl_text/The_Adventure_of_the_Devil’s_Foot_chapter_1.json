        "In recording from time to time some of the curious experiences\nand interesting recollections which I associate with my long and\nintimate friendship with Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I have continually\nbeen faced by difficulties caused by his own aversion to\npublicity.  To his sombre and cynical spirit all popular applause\nwas always abhorrent, and nothing amused him more at the end of a\nsuccessful case than to hand over the actual exposure to some\northodox official, and to listen with a mocking smile to the\ngeneral chorus of misplaced congratulation.  It was indeed this\nattitude upon the part of my friend and certainly not any lack of\ninteresting material which has caused me of late years to lay\nvery few of my records before the public.  My participation in\nsome if his adventures was always a privilege which entailed\ndiscretion and reticence upon me.",
        "It was, then, with considerable surprise that I received a\ntelegram from Homes last Tuesday—he has never been known to\nwrite where a telegram would serve—in the following terms:",
        "Why not tell them of the Cornish horror—strangest case I have\nhandled.",
        "I have no idea what backward sweep of memory had brought the\nmatter fresh to his mind, or what freak had caused him to desire\nthat I should recount it; but I hasten, before another cancelling\ntelegram may arrive, to hunt out the notes which give me the\nexact details of the case and to lay the narrative before my\nreaders.",
        "It was, then, in the spring of the year 1897 that Holmes’s iron\nconstitution showed some symptoms of giving way in the face of\nconstant hard work of a most exacting kind, aggravated, perhaps,\nby occasional indiscretions of his own.  In March of that year\nDr. Moore Agar, of Harley Street, whose dramatic introduction to\nHolmes I may some day recount, gave positive injunctions that the\nfamous private agent lay aside all his cases and surrender\nhimself to complete rest if he wished to avert an absolute\nbreakdown.  The state of his health was not a matter in which he\nhimself took the faintest interest, for his mental detachment was\nabsolute, but he was induced at last, on the threat of being\npermanently disqualified from work, to give himself a complete\nchange of scene and air.  Thus it was that in the early spring of\nthat year we found ourselves together in a small cottage near\nPoldhu Bay, at the further extremity of the Cornish peninsula.",
        "It was a singular spot, and one peculiarly well suited to the\ngrim humour of my patient.  From the windows of our little\nwhitewashed house, which stood high upon a grassy headland, we\nlooked down upon the whole sinister semicircle of Mounts Bay,\nthat old death trap of sailing vessels, with its fringe of black\ncliffs and surge-swept reefs on which innumerable seamen have met\ntheir end.  With a northerly breeze it lies placid and sheltered,\ninviting the storm-tossed craft to tack into it for rest and\nprotection.",
        "Then come the sudden swirl round of the wind, the blistering gale\nfrom the south-west, the dragging anchor, the lee shore, and the\nlast battle in the creaming breakers.  The wise mariner stands\nfar out from that evil place.",
        "On the land side our surroundings were as sombre as on the sea.\nIt was a country of rolling moors, lonely and dun-colored, with\nan occasional church tower to mark the site of some old-world\nvillage.  In every direction upon these moors there were traces\nof some vanished race which had passed utterly away, and left as\nit sole record strange monuments of stone, irregular mounds which\ncontained the burned ashes of the dead, and curious earthworks\nwhich hinted at prehistoric strife. The glamour and mystery of\nthe place, with its sinister atmosphere of forgotten nations,\nappealed to the imagination of my friend, and he spent much of\nhis time in long walks and solitary meditations upon the moor.\nThe ancient Cornish language had also arrested his attention, and\nhe had, I remember, conceived the idea that it was akin to the\nChaldean, and had been largely derived from the Phoenician\ntraders in tin.  He had received a consignment of books upon\nphilology and was settling down to develop this thesis when\nsuddenly, to my sorrow and to his unfeigned delight, we found\nourselves, even in that land of dreams, plunged into a problem at\nour very doors which was more intense, more engrossing, and\ninfinitely more mysterious than any of those which had driven us\nfrom London.  Our simple life and peaceful, healthy routine were\nviolently interrupted, and we were precipitated into the midst of\na series of events which caused the utmost excitement not only in\nCornwall but throughout the whole west of England. Many of my\nreaders may retain some recollection of what was called at the\ntime “The Cornish Horror,” though a most imperfect account of the\nmatter reached the London press. Now, after thirteen years, I\nwill give the true details of this inconceivable affair to the\npublic.",
        "I have said that scattered towers marked the villages which\ndotted this part of Cornwall.  The nearest of these was the\nhamlet of Tredannick Wollas, where the cottages of a couple of\nhundred inhabitants clustered round an ancient, moss-grown\nchurch.  The vicar of the parish, Mr. Roundhay, was something of\nan archaeologist, and as such Holmes had made his acquaintance.\nHe was a middle-aged man, portly and affable, with a considerable\nfund of local lore.  At his invitation we had taken tea at the\nvicarage and had come to know, also, Mr. Mortimer Tregennis, an\nindependent gentleman, who increased the clergyman’s scanty\nresources by taking rooms in his large, straggling house.  The\nvicar, being a bachelor, was glad to come to such an arrangement,\nthough he had little in common with his lodger, who was a thin,\ndark, spectacled man, with a stoop which gave the impression of\nactual, physical deformity.  I remember that during our short\nvisit we found the vicar garrulous, but his lodger strangely\nreticent, a sad-faced, introspective man, sitting with averted\neyes, brooding apparently upon his own affairs.",
        "These were the two men who entered abruptly into our little\nsitting-room on Tuesday, March the 16th, shortly after our\nbreakfast hour, as we were smoking together, preparatory to our\ndaily excursion upon the moors.",
        "“Mr. Holmes,” said the vicar in an agitated voice, “the most\nextraordinary and tragic affair has occurred during the night.\nIt is the most unheard-of business.  We can only regard it as a\nspecial Providence that you should chance to be here at the time,\nfor in all England you are the one man we need.”",
        "I glared at the intrusive vicar with no very friendly eyes; but\nHolmes took his pipe from his lips and sat up in his chair like\nan old hound who hears the view-halloa.  He waved his hand to the\nsofa, and our palpitating visitor with his agitated companion sat\nside by side upon it.  Mr. Mortimer Tregennis was more self-\ncontained than the clergyman, but the twitching of his thin hands\nand the brightness of his dark eyes showed that they shared a\ncommon emotion.",
        "“Shall I speak or you?” he asked of the vicar.",
        "“Well, as you seem to have made the discovery, whatever it may\nbe, and the vicar to have had it second-hand, perhaps you had\nbetter do the speaking,” said Holmes.",
        "I glanced at the hastily clad clergyman, with the formally\ndressed lodger seated beside him, and was amused at the surprise\nwhich Holmes’s simple deduction had brought to their faces.",
        "“Perhaps I had best say a few words first,” said the vicar, “and\nthen you can judge if you will listen to the details from Mr.\nTregennis, or whether we should not hasten at once to the scene\nof this mysterious affair.  I may explain, then, that our friend\nhere spent last evening in the company of his two brothers, Owen\nand George, and of his sister Brenda, at their house of\nTredannick Wartha, which is near the old stone cross upon the\nmoor.  He left them shortly after ten o’clock, playing cards\nround the dining-room table, in excellent health and spirits.\nThis morning, being an early riser, he walked in that direction\nbefore breakfast and was overtaken by the carriage of Dr.\nRichards, who explained that he had just been sent for on a most\nurgent call to Tredannick Wartha.  Mr. Mortimer Tregennis\nnaturally went with him.  When he arrived at Tredannick Wartha he\nfound an extraordinary state of things.  His two brothers and his\nsister were seated round the table exactly as he had left them,\nthe cards still spread in front of them and the candles burned\ndown to their sockets.  The sister lay back stone-dead in her\nchair, while the two brothers sat on each side of her laughing,\nshouting, and singing, the senses stricken clean out of them.\nAll three of them, the dead woman and the two demented men,\nretained upon their faces an expression of the utmost horror—a\nconvulsion of terror which was dreadful to look upon.  There was\nno sign of the presence of anyone in the house, except Mrs.\nPorter, the old cook and housekeeper, who declared that she had\nslept deeply and heard no sound during the night.  Nothing had\nbeen stolen or disarranged, and there is absolutely no\nexplanation of what the horror can be which has frightened a\nwoman to death and two strong men out of their senses.  There is\nthe situation, Mr. Holmes, in a nutshell, and if you can help us\nto clear it up you will have done a great work.”",
        "I had hoped that in some way I could coax my companion back into\nthe quiet which had been the object of our journey; but one\nglance at his intense face and contracted eyebrows told me how\nvain was now the expectation.  He sat for some little time in\nsilence, absorbed in the strange drama which had broken in upon\nour peace.",
        "“I will look into this matter,” he said at last.  “On the face of\nit, it would appear to be a case of a very exceptional nature.\nHave you been there yourself, Mr. Roundhay?”",
        "“No, Mr. Holmes.  Mr. Tregennis brought back the account to the\nvicarage, and I at once hurried over with him to consult you.”",
        "“How far is it to the house where this singular tragedy\noccurred?”",
        "“About a mile inland.”",
        "“Then we shall walk over together.  But before we start I must\nask you a few question, Mr. Mortimer Tregennis.”",
        "The other had been silent all this time, but I had observed that\nhis more controlled excitement was even greater than the\nobtrusive emotion of the clergyman.  He sat with a pale, drawn\nface, his anxious gaze fixed upon Holmes, and his thin hands\nclasped convulsively together.  His pale lips quivered as he\nlistened to the dreadful experience which had befallen his\nfamily, and his dark eyes seemed to reflect something of the\nhorror of the scene.",
        "“Ask what you like, Mr. Holmes,” said he eagerly.  “It is a bad\nthing to speak of, but I will answer you the truth.”",
        "“Tell me about last night.”",
        "“Well, Mr. Holmes, I supped there, as the vicar has said, and my\nelder brother George proposed a game of whist afterwards.  We sat\ndown about nine o’clock.  It was a quarter-past ten when I moved\nto go.  I left them all round the table, as merry as could be.”",
        "“Who let you out?”",
        "“Mrs. Porter had gone to bed, so I let myself out.  I shut the\nhall door behind me.  The window of the room in which they sat\nwas closed, but the blind was not drawn down.  There was no\nchange in door or window this morning, or any reason to think\nthat any stranger had been to the house.  Yet there they sat,\ndriven clean mad with terror, and Brenda lying dead of fright,\nwith her head hanging over the arm of the chair.  I’ll never get\nthe sight of that room out of my mind so long as I live.”",
        "“The facts, as you state them, are certainly most remarkable,\"\nsaid Holmes.  “I take it that you have no theory yourself which\ncan in any way account for them?”",
        "“It’s devilish, Mr. Holmes, devilish!” cried Mortimer Tregennis.\n“It is not of this world.  Something has come into that room\nwhich has dashed the light of reason from their minds.  What\nhuman contrivance could do that?”",
        "“I fear,” said Holmes, “that if the matter is beyond humanity it\nis certainly beyond me.  Yet we must exhaust all natural\nexplanations before we fall back upon such a theory as this.  As\nto yourself, Mr. Tregennis, I take it you were divided in some\nway from your family, since they lived together and you had rooms\napart?”",
        "“That is so, Mr. Holmes, though the matter is past and done with.\nWe were a family of tin-miners at Redruth, but we sold our\nventure to a company, and so retired with enough to keep us.  I\nwon’t deny that there was some feeling about the division of the\nmoney and it stood between us for a time, but it was all forgiven\nand forgotten, and we were the best of friends together.”",
        "“Looking back at the evening which you spent together, does\nanything stand out in your memory as throwing any possible light\nupon the tragedy?  Think carefully, Mr. Tregennis, for any clue\nwhich can help me.”",
        "“There is nothing at all, sir.”",
        "“Your people were in their usual spirits?”",
        "“Never better.”",
        "“Were they nervous people?  Did they ever show any apprehension\nof coming danger?”",
        "“Nothing of the kind.”",
        "“You have nothing to add then, which could assist me?”",
        "Mortimer Tregennis considered earnestly for a moment.",
        "“There is one thing occurs to me,” said he at last.  “As we sat\nat the table my back was to the window, and my brother George, he\nbeing my partner at cards, was facing it.  I saw him once look\nhard over my shoulder, so I turned round and looked also.  The\nblind was up and the window shut, but I could just make out the\nbushes on the lawn, and it seemed to me for a moment that I saw\nsomething moving among them.  I couldn’t even say if it was man\nor animal, but I just thought there was something there.  When I\nasked him what he was looking at, he told me that he had the same\nfeeling.  That is all that I can say.”",
        "“Did you not investigate?”",
        "“No; the matter passed as unimportant.”",
        "“You left them, then, without any premonition of evil?”",
        "“None at all.”",
        "“I am not clear how you came to hear the news so early this\nmorning.”",
        "“I am an early riser and generally take a walk before breakfast.\nThis morning I had hardly started when the doctor in his carriage\novertook me.  He told me that old Mrs. Porter had sent a boy down\nwith an urgent message.  I sprang in beside him and we drove on.\nWhen we got there we looked into that dreadful room.  The candles\nand the fire must have burned out hours before, and they had been\nsitting there in the dark until dawn had broken.  The doctor said\nBrenda must have been dead at least six hours.  There were no\nsigns of violence.  She just lay across the arm of the chair with\nthat look on her face.  George and Owen were singing snatches of\nsongs and gibbering like two great apes.  Oh, it was awful to\nsee!  I couldn’t stand it, and the doctor was as white as a\nsheet.  Indeed, he fell into a chair in a sort of faint, and we\nnearly had him on our hands as well.”",
        "“Remarkable—most remarkable!” said Holmes, rising and taking his\nhat.  “I think, perhaps, we had better go down to Tredannick\nWartha without further delay.  I confess that I have seldom known\na case which at first sight presented a more singular problem.”",
        "\nOur proceedings of that first morning did little to advance the\ninvestigation.  It was marked, however, at the outset by an\nincident which left the most sinister impression upon my mind.\nThe approach to the spot at which the tragedy occurred is down a\nnarrow, winding, country lane.  While we made our way along it we\nheard the rattle of a carriage coming towards us and stood aside\nto let it pass.  As it drove by us I caught a glimpse through the\nclosed window of a horribly contorted, grinning face glaring out\nat us.  Those staring eyes and gnashing teeth flashed past us\nlike a dreadful vision.",
        "“My brothers!” cried Mortimer Tregennis, white to his lips.\n“They are taking them to Helston.”",
        "We looked with horror after the black carriage, lumbering upon\nits way.  Then we turned our steps towards this ill-omened house\nin which they had met their strange fate.",
        "It was a large and bright dwelling, rather a villa than a\ncottage, with a considerable garden which was already, in that\nCornish air, well filled with spring flowers.  Towards this\ngarden the window of the sitting-room fronted, and from it,\naccording to Mortimer Tregennis, must have come that thing of\nevil which had by sheer horror in a single instant blasted their\nminds.  Holmes walked slowly and thoughtfully among the flower-\nplots and along the path before we entered the porch.  So\nabsorbed was he in his thoughts, I remember, that he stumbled\nover the watering-pot, upset its contents, and deluged both our\nfeet and the garden path.  Inside the house we were met by the\nelderly Cornish housekeeper, Mrs. Porter, who, with the aid of a\nyoung girl, looked after the wants of the family.  She readily\nanswered all Holmes’s questions.  She had heard nothing in the\nnight.  Her employers had all been in excellent spirits lately,\nand she had never known them more cheerful and prosperous.  She\nhad fainted with horror upon entering the room in the morning and\nseeing that dreadful company round the table.  She had, when she\nrecovered, thrown open the window to let the morning air in, and\nhad run down to the lane, whence she sent a farm-lad for the\ndoctor.  The lady was on her bed upstairs if we cared to see her.\nIt took four strong men to get the brothers into the asylum\ncarriage.  She would not herself stay in the house another day\nand was starting that very afternoon to rejoin her family at St.\nIves.",
